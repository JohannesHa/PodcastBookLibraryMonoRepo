00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
 The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,

00:02.500 --> 00:04.400
 his second time in the podcast.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.840
 He's one of the most innovative scholars

00:06.840 --> 00:09.760
 of martial arts in the modern era.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.780
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:11.780 --> 00:14.980
 Indeed hiring website, Audible audio books,

00:14.980 --> 00:18.780
 ExpressVPN and Element electrolyte drink.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.860
 Click the sponsor links to get a discount

00:20.860 --> 00:22.900
 and to support this podcast.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.960
 As a side note, let me say that I've gotten a chance

00:24.960 --> 00:28.180
 to train with Ryan recently and to both discuss

00:28.180 --> 00:32.480
 and try out on the mat his ideas about grappling and fighting.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.120
 What struck me is his unapologetic drive

00:35.120 --> 00:37.560
 to solve martial arts.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.160
 It reminds me of the ambitious vision and effort

00:40.160 --> 00:43.720
 of Google's DeepMind to solve intelligence.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.320
 In Ryan's case, this isn't some out there

00:46.320 --> 00:48.040
 martial arts guru talk.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.480
 This is a style of thinking about the game of human chess,

00:51.480 --> 00:55.080
 of seeking to define the rules and to engineer ways

00:55.080 --> 00:58.120
 from first principles of escaping the constraints

00:58.120 --> 00:59.560
 of those rules.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.480
 This style of thinking is rare,

01:01.480 --> 01:04.560
 but is ultimately the one that leads to the discovery

01:04.560 --> 01:07.900
 of new revolutionary ideas.

 And now here's my conversation with Ryan Hall.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.160
 You're known as a systems thinker in martial arts,

01:21.160 --> 01:25.520
 but you also, I think, are willing to think

01:25.520 --> 01:28.180
 outside the rules of the game, outside of the system.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.960
 When you're thinking about strategies

01:31.960 --> 01:36.960
 of how to solve the particular problem of an opponent,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.480
 whether that's jiu jitsu or in mixed martial arts,

01:40.480 --> 01:41.840
 what's your process for doing that,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.720
 for figuring out that puzzle?

01:43.720 --> 01:45.720
 I would say, I don't know if I have a specific

01:45.720 --> 01:48.560
 like A to B to C process for that sort of thing.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.280
 I try to do my best to appreciate that.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.260
 I think a lot of the thinking,

01:54.260 --> 01:55.960
 or maybe not all the thinking,

01:55.960 --> 01:58.840
 but a lot of great thinking on conflict,

01:58.840 --> 02:03.720
 on battle, on war, on martial arts has been done already.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.980
 Not that we don't have to do any sort of

02:05.980 --> 02:08.760
 background investigation or reassessing of these ideas

02:08.760 --> 02:10.660
 or axioms that have come down through things

02:10.660 --> 02:13.360
 like the book of five rings or the art of war,

02:13.360 --> 02:16.920
 or like von Clausewitz, even anything like that really,

02:16.920 --> 02:21.680
 but is trying to understand the lessons of the past

02:21.680 --> 02:26.080
 that I think oftentimes we don't take with us problem solving.

02:26.080 --> 02:26.920
 We pay lip service.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.080
 I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.000
 You know, a victorious fighter, the great fighter,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.960
 you know, he knows victory is there,

02:32.960 --> 02:34.640
 then he seeks battle.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.520
 Everyone else is looking for victory in battle.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.360
 Yeah, moving on.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.440
 And that's why I'm gonna double jab and throw my left hand.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.080
 And I think a lot of times our actions

02:42.080 --> 02:45.040
 don't reflect our stated belief structure.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.160
 And I think that oftentimes you can tell

02:47.160 --> 02:48.500
 what I believe really,

02:48.500 --> 02:50.640
 or what my fundamental operating system is

02:50.640 --> 02:52.440
 based on my actions, whether I'm aware,

02:52.440 --> 02:53.960
 I have an operating system internally,

02:53.960 --> 02:55.320
 whether I'm aware of it or not,

02:55.320 --> 02:57.200
 or certainly whether I'm fully aware of it.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.360
 So I guess when it comes to strategy,

03:00.360 --> 03:02.640
 I try to think about how things interact.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.000
 You mentioned systems thinking,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.500
 and I try to do my best to understand how systems exist,

03:07.500 --> 03:09.760
 but I think that systems have a fundamental strength

03:09.760 --> 03:11.280
 and a fundamental weakness.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.120
 They work how they work, and that's great,

03:14.120 --> 03:15.580
 but they're readable.

03:15.580 --> 03:19.140
 So if you are aware, if I am operating on a system

03:19.140 --> 03:21.920
 of which you're not really read into,

03:21.920 --> 03:26.760
 then I think oftentimes I can seem shockingly effective,

03:26.760 --> 03:30.140
 particularly if my system preys on certain weaknesses

03:30.140 --> 03:33.140
 that maybe you're given to.

03:33.140 --> 03:36.580
 But what happens when you've read the same books that I have?

03:36.580 --> 03:38.040
 I think that a lot of times

03:38.040 --> 03:39.400
 that makes me deeply predictable.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.560
 I think about systems in jiu jitsu,

03:41.560 --> 03:46.500
 and a lot of times people think that they're doing jiu jitsu

03:46.500 --> 03:48.640
 when in reality they are doing an expression of it.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.520
 Let's say I'll use, there's the Marcelo Garcia system.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.960
 There is the current Henzo Gracie system.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.520
 There's the old Gracie Baja one.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.640
 There's the Gracie Academy, classic Gracie jiu jitsu.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.180
 There's the art of jiu jitsu, kind of autos approach.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.800
 And there's some crossover between a lot of these,

04:07.800 --> 04:12.800
 but oftentimes I think when it comes to understanding

04:12.880 --> 04:14.480
 how I'm making decisions

04:14.480 --> 04:16.240
 and how my opponent is making decisions,

04:16.240 --> 04:19.000
 I have to appreciate whether or not I'm an end user

04:19.000 --> 04:21.520
 of something, and I'll use my phone as an example.

04:21.520 --> 04:22.960
 I was thinking of this the other day,

04:22.960 --> 04:25.320
 and as an end user of my phone, I can't,

04:25.320 --> 04:27.080
 I have no idea what it does.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.420
 Like Edward Snowden comes up and goes,

04:28.420 --> 04:30.480
 ''Hey guys, you realize your phones are listening to you.''

04:30.480 --> 04:33.120
 I'm like, ''Really, what?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.260
 All right, I believe you.''

04:34.260 --> 04:35.900
 And then of course that comes out,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.680
 but to what extent?

04:37.680 --> 04:38.580
 I have no idea.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.920
 What is my phone capable of?

04:40.920 --> 04:41.960
 I have no idea.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.080
 I can mess with the font though.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.380
 I really like blue screens, not purple screens.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.680
 So as an end user, I can change some of the bells

04:47.680 --> 04:49.060
 and whistles that have nothing to do

04:49.060 --> 04:50.600
 with the underlying source code of it all

04:50.600 --> 04:51.440
 or how it functions.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.440
 The same way in my car, I'm an end user of my car.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.320
 If I do this with the steering wheel, it goes.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.760
 If I push on the gas, it goes.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.600
 I know how to fix it when it's out of gas.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.140
 I know how to fix it when it's out of oil.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.600
 And I know how to fix it when a flat tire comes.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.520
 But short of that, or actually beyond that, I have nothing.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.760
 So I think that oftentimes,

05:09.760 --> 05:11.440
 I've been around in jiu jitsu long enough

05:11.440 --> 05:14.620
 to encounter a new wave of good grapplers.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.200
 And it's very, very interesting sometimes

05:16.200 --> 05:17.740
 how they're running systems

05:17.740 --> 05:19.160
 they don't realize they're running.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.000
 Like, I'm like, oh yeah,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.240
 I trained at Marcelo Garcia's Academy for a long time.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.660
 And a big fan of Marcelo's was a student there.

05:26.540 --> 05:29.240
 Encountered a lot of the auto style jiu jitsu

05:29.240 --> 05:31.040
 a number of years ago.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.200
 Been very, very deep into foot locking and leg attacks

05:35.200 --> 05:38.040
 and whatnot for a long, long time.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.360
 I understand your system better than you do, or I may.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.720
 And let's say you understand my system better than I do.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.640
 That would be a huge issue.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.920
 That was something that I encountered a long time ago,

05:45.920 --> 05:47.120
 trying to come up in jiu jitsu

05:47.120 --> 05:50.460
 where I was trying to utilize systems

05:50.460 --> 05:54.160
 that were created by, let's say Hoffa Mendez

05:54.160 --> 05:55.000
 or someone else.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.720
 And I'm basically trying to do what you're doing.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.640
 I'm just not doing as good of a version of it.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.520
 So not only am I not doing it well,

06:00.520 --> 06:02.340
 but I'm entirely predictable.

06:02.340 --> 06:03.920
 And I think that that can be a big issue.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.620
 So to come back, I think of systems a lot of times now

06:06.620 --> 06:09.240
 in terms of, particularly like end user type of systems,

06:09.240 --> 06:11.760
 like an iPhone is a really, really fast way

06:11.760 --> 06:14.120
 for me to be able to do all sorts of things.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.240
 If you were to take it from me,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.120
 I couldn't recreate any of that.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.320
 So you want to be more the NSA and less the end user.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.240
 Exactly, exactly.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.080
 That way I'm listening to you.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.960
 You want to be the NSA of combat.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.440
 That's right, we're watching UP.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.880
 But basically, I guess what I would come back and say

06:29.880 --> 06:32.280
 is if you understand how things interact

06:32.280 --> 06:35.220
 on a fundamental level and what type of games exist

06:35.220 --> 06:36.840
 and what type of interactions exist,

06:36.840 --> 06:40.020
 then you can transcend a lot of the systems.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.840
 It's almost like a cook versus if I can make certain things

06:42.840 --> 06:45.400
 in the kitchen, but I am not a chef.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.000
 You could give me a bunch of ingredients

06:47.000 --> 06:49.700
 and I could probably cook not well,

06:49.700 --> 06:51.360
 but a couple of different things.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.680
 But a master chef would be aware of the implications

06:55.680 --> 06:57.540
 of all of the things that they're doing,

06:57.540 --> 07:00.240
 extra time in the oven, less time in the oven,

07:00.240 --> 07:03.160
 putting this flavoring or spice in,

07:03.160 --> 07:04.720
 what you're doing with various things.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.960
 And also they could turn all of these ingredients

07:06.960 --> 07:07.800
 into Chinese food.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.120
 They could turn all these ingredients into Italian food

07:09.120 --> 07:10.760
 and they could turn all these Italian food ingredients

07:10.760 --> 07:13.560
 into chicken Parmesan or it could turn into lasagna.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.120
 But they're not limited to a specific thing

07:16.120 --> 07:18.880
 because they have knowledge of how food interacts,

07:18.880 --> 07:20.080
 what it does to create taste,

07:20.080 --> 07:21.440
 what it does to create texture.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.200
 So to come back, let's take rock, paper, scissors.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.760
 Rock, paper, scissors is built on the idea

07:26.760 --> 07:28.040
 of a couple of different things.

07:28.040 --> 07:28.880
 Or actually, I'll tell you what,

07:28.880 --> 07:31.240
 can I ask you a question?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.700
 What's your favorite dinosaur?

07:32.700 --> 07:34.040
 On the same, on three, we'll go.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.120
 One, two, three.

07:37.120 --> 07:37.960
 T. Rex.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.480
 So me too, man, we're gonna be best friends.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.080
 So it's, okay, so what's the first question

07:45.080 --> 07:46.480
 when you say, hey, let's play rock, paper, scissors?

07:46.480 --> 07:47.680
 It's like, hey, is it rock, paper, scissors

07:47.680 --> 07:49.240
 or rock, paper, scissors, shoot?

07:49.240 --> 07:50.680
 And you're like, rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.520
 You're like, okay.

07:51.520 --> 07:55.480
 Because if we go rock, paper, scissors, shoot,

07:55.480 --> 07:58.080
 and I'm like, oh man, I got lucky and I won.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.400
 Imagine I won 100 times in a row.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.240
 Yeah.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.240
 It'd be luck, it'd be luck if I was honestly doing that.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.560
 But now let's say, for instance,

08:05.560 --> 08:08.160
 I go on rock, paper, scissors and you go on shoot.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.600
 Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.840
 Here comes the rock, right?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.760
 If you lose, whose fault is it?

08:15.760 --> 08:17.120
 It's yours.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.920
 This is built on a parody thing

08:18.920 --> 08:22.600
 where I don't get to pick second.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.120
 If I get to pick second,

08:24.120 --> 08:26.320
 it's like being able to investigate your background

08:26.320 --> 08:27.260
 before going to meet you.

08:27.260 --> 08:28.360
 And then I'm like, oh, hi.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.440
 Oh, I too love the New Jersey, you know,

08:30.440 --> 08:32.400
 the New Jersey Nets, which is a statement

08:32.400 --> 08:34.440
 that no one in their right mind would ever make

08:34.440 --> 08:35.760
 when I was growing up.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.880
 So anyway, you'd have to have personal knowledge

08:37.880 --> 08:38.800
 of somebody.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.320
 So anyway, to come back,

08:40.320 --> 08:43.900
 if you understand how games are structured,

08:45.200 --> 08:48.120
 you can start to realize that there's huge gaps

08:48.120 --> 08:51.700
 and huge holes in a lot of the thinking behind all of it.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.000
 And if you can create the illusion of choice,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.240
 I'll play one more if you don't mind.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.080
 This is one of my favorite ones.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.840
 I do this in class all the time.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.840
 Have you seen this before?

08:58.840 --> 08:59.680
 No.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.360
 Okay, may I ask you some questions please?

09:01.360 --> 09:02.200
 Sure.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.040
 Okay, fantastic.

09:03.040 --> 09:03.880
 I'm scared.

09:03.880 --> 09:04.840
 Oh, there's, everybody wins.

09:04.840 --> 09:05.680
 Don't worry.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.520
 All right.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.600
 So could you please?

09:07.600 --> 09:08.760
 I win.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.000
 Could you please pick three fingers

09:11.000 --> 09:12.480
 and tell me what they are?

09:12.480 --> 09:13.320
 Your thumb.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.280
 Okay.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.440
 Your pinky.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.260
 Okay.

09:16.260 --> 09:17.160
 And your middle finger.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.260
 Okay.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.200
 So could you please pick two fingers?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.120
 Your middle finger and your pinky.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.080
 Okay, could you please pick one finger?

09:27.280 --> 09:28.720
 I'll go with the middle finger.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.560
 Woo hoo.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.840
 Okay, could you please pick one finger?

09:31.840 --> 09:32.680
 Pinky.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.360
 Okay, let's play again.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.960
 Can you pick one finger, please?

09:40.320 --> 09:41.720
 Your middle finger.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.480
 Okay, can you pick one finger, please?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.080
 Your thumb.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.400
 Yeah, your pinky.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.360
 Okay, now pick two more fingers, please.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.680
 Your middle finger and your ring finger.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.600
 Okay.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.120
 Could you please pick one more finger?

09:56.120 --> 09:57.060
 Damn it.

09:57.060 --> 09:57.900
 So.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.800
 I thought that enhanced the illusion of choice.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.240
 It's the illusion of choice.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.720
 If I'm asking the questions,

10:04.720 --> 10:07.000
 provided I ask the right questions,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.240
 there can be no correct answer.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.120
 Doesn't mean that, I mean, ultimately,

10:11.120 --> 10:13.080
 if that's what you wanted, let's say,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.320
 like I thought I was guiding you to something I wanted,

10:15.320 --> 10:17.440
 it turns out that was the outcome you wanted.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.140
 Now I'm gonna ask the wrong questions.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.320
 I might not get what I wanted, so.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.560
 Oh, by the way, sorry to interrupt.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.300
 For people that might be just listening to this,

10:25.300 --> 10:28.400
 that no matter what trajectory we took

10:28.400 --> 10:30.640
 through that decision tree that Ryan was presenting,

10:30.640 --> 10:32.360
 it was always ending up with a middle finger,

10:32.360 --> 10:34.120
 ironically enough.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.720
 I was surprised.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.080
 So, and.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.600
 All of us were surprised, and we're both winners.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.400
 Yeah, we all, everyone was.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.640
 I felt like a winner.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.280
 All right, so now I'm gonna,

10:44.280 --> 10:47.080
 now I'll ask some different questions, if you don't mind.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.280
 Can you please pick two fingers to put down?

10:51.840 --> 10:54.080
 Your middle finger and your pinky.

10:54.080 --> 10:54.920
 All right, sorry.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.760
 Oh, that's so awkward.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.600
 That's like the worst finger positions.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.240
 Okay, can you please pick, wait a minute.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.960
 That's, oh, hold on.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.800
 Yeah.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.600
 Well, what if you picked two other fingers to put down?

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
 Your thumb and your pinky.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.840
 Okay, my thumb and my pinky.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.040
 Can you please pick two fingers to put down?

11:11.840 --> 11:12.680
 Well.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.000
 Whatever two you like.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.920
 Okay, your middle finger and your pointy finger.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.880
 Ah, okay, can you pick two fingers to put down?

11:19.880 --> 11:20.720
 What's the name?

11:20.720 --> 11:21.540
 It's index finger.

11:21.540 --> 11:22.380
 Index finger.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.200
 Why did I call it the pointy finger?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.040
 Pointy, it's the pointy one.

11:24.040 --> 11:24.880
 That's the one we usually point.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.340
 It's weird to point with the ring finger.

11:27.340 --> 11:28.180
 Sorry, what?

11:28.180 --> 11:29.580
 Two more to put down, please.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.840
 The middle finger and the ring finger.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.640
 Ah, man.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.040
 What if you pick my ring finger and my index finger?

11:38.040 --> 11:38.880
 Yeah.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.480
 Aha, woohoo, I win.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.240
 So even though I'm asking the questions,

11:42.240 --> 11:45.200
 it's not impossible that I arrive at a good outcome for me,

11:45.200 --> 11:47.000
 but it's no longer guaranteed.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.680
 I went from a situation where I literally can't lose.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.640
 Yeah, it's pretty low probability.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.200
 Right, super low probability.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.960
 And the second you realize what I'm doing,

11:54.960 --> 11:56.320
 you would never let me win

11:56.320 --> 11:58.160
 because the ball's truly in your court.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.640
 So I guess that's kind of what I'm fundamentally trying

12:01.640 --> 12:03.880
 to put into play almost all the time.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.820
 Can I ask the right set of questions?

12:05.820 --> 12:10.520
 Can I develop the ability skills wise, understanding wise,

12:10.520 --> 12:11.920
 and then discipline wise,

12:11.920 --> 12:14.420
 and then have the courage and the constitution

12:14.420 --> 12:16.200
 and the discipline necessary,

12:16.200 --> 12:20.140
 the patience necessary to ask the proper questions

12:20.140 --> 12:22.000
 and wait for the proper answers?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.080
 And if I can,

12:24.080 --> 12:29.080
 assuming the perfect world, I win, period.

12:29.960 --> 12:30.920
 Yeah, so does that make sense?

12:30.920 --> 12:32.080
 Yeah, that totally makes sense.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.760
 So I don't know if you know

12:33.760 --> 12:36.800
 sort of the more mathematical discipline of game theory.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.160
 There's something called mechanism design.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.860
 So game theory is this field where you model

12:43.860 --> 12:46.240
 some kind of interaction between human beings.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.160
 You could model grappling that way.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.080
 You can model nuclear conflict between nations that way.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.080
 And you set up a set of rules and incentives

12:56.080 --> 13:00.160
 and then use math to predict

13:00.160 --> 13:03.840
 what is likely outcome depending over time

13:03.840 --> 13:06.240
 based on the interaction given those rules.

13:06.240 --> 13:11.240
 Mechanism design is the design of games.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.020
 So like the design of systems

13:14.020 --> 13:18.540
 that are likely to lead to a certain outcome.

13:18.540 --> 13:21.060
 And so what you're suggesting is

13:21.060 --> 13:26.060
 you want to discover systems whose decision tree,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.620
 all the possible things that could happen,

13:29.620 --> 13:32.540
 feel like there's choice being made,

13:32.540 --> 13:36.040
 but ultimately one of the parties

13:36.040 --> 13:37.880
 doesn't have any choice

13:37.880 --> 13:39.800
 in what the actual final outcome is.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.700
 You're making them feel like they're playing a game too.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.660
 So it's not like you don't feel trapped.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.500
 It's kind of like.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.880
 Well, the best traps, you don't look very threatening.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.840
 So I'm like, oh, I'll walk over there.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.000
 I guess wouldn't that,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.400
 I guess that's kind of an interesting thing.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.800
 If a lion, when does a lion roar?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.600
 It's an interesting thing when you watch like lions hunting.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.680
 Don't roar when they hunt.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.280
 They want to, when they want to move you back,

14:05.280 --> 14:06.200
 they do stuff like that.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.320
 When they actually want to come and get you,

14:08.320 --> 14:09.320
 they're pretty slinky.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.520
 It's like water covered.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.280
 It's like furry water.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.120
 And I guess like when you keep that in mind,

14:16.440 --> 14:18.960
 it's funny how, like for us a hobby actually,

14:18.960 --> 14:21.040
 a brilliant guy, like one of my MMA coaches

14:21.040 --> 14:22.880
 and the head coach at TriStar,

14:22.880 --> 14:23.800
 he brought this up one time.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.040
 I thought it was a really salient point.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.800
 Said, let's say we have a million person bracket.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.880
 Impossibly huge.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.840
 Like Frank Dukes went in the Kumite level huge bracket.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.920
 He claimed to knock out like 250 consecutive people.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.120
 And you're like, that is all of Hong Kong

14:38.120 --> 14:38.960
 was in that thing.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.360
 And everyone kept their mouth shut.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.680
 But anyway, that's pretty cool.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.360
 But to come back a little improbable, pretty cool.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.000
 So let's say for instance, like there's no cheating going on,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.040
 no cheating going on and we're flipping coins, right?

14:51.040 --> 14:54.520
 Someone is gonna have an unbroken string of victory

14:54.520 --> 14:57.960
 through that bracket, which is pretty insane.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.280
 How many consecutive like toss ups this person won.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.040
 And then at the end of it all,

15:04.040 --> 15:07.480
 imagine like aliens show up and we go,

15:07.480 --> 15:09.880
 hey, they wanna flip a coin for whether or not Earth,

15:09.880 --> 15:12.640
 whether or not Earth gets to continue.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.040
 They'd be like, oh, I'll do it.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.160
 I'm good at this.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.160
 That would be tempting as a person to do.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.960
 You're like, I'm a lucky guy.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.280
 Are you sure?

15:22.280 --> 15:23.680
 Maybe, I mean, maybe effectively you are.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.400
 We could argue that effectively you're incredibly lucky.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.320
 But basically is that an actual ability?

15:27.320 --> 15:28.600
 Is that like a perk in a video game

15:28.600 --> 15:30.120
 or is that just this thing that happened?

15:30.120 --> 15:33.720
 So anyway, how many times are someone,

15:33.720 --> 15:35.760
 you could go through an entire career,

15:35.760 --> 15:37.840
 particularly in a fight sport.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.400
 Well, let's say you get 15 knockouts

15:39.400 --> 15:41.040
 and 15 toss up scenarios.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.360
 Cause you see that happening all the time

15:42.360 --> 15:43.720
 in the fight game, a toss up scenario.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.200
 It's not like you're mounted on me

15:45.200 --> 15:47.480
 and that's not a toss up scenario.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.400
 Many, many, many, many, many striking scenarios.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.240
 A lot of grappling ones,

15:50.240 --> 15:53.120
 but tons of striking scenarios are dead toss ups.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.680
 And somebody wins by knockout.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.520
 They win five times in a row.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.000
 Then they lose a couple of times in a row.

15:58.000 --> 15:58.840
 We go, what happened?

15:58.840 --> 15:59.760
 You're like, what do you mean what happened?

15:59.760 --> 16:00.960
 They were always flipping the coin.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.680
 And then they win five more and they go, ah, back on track.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.520
 Can you imagine that?

16:04.520 --> 16:05.360
 You're flipping a coin.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.760
 I'm like heads, heads, heads, heads, tails.

16:06.760 --> 16:07.600
 What?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.000
 Tails, tails, heads again.

16:09.000 --> 16:09.840
 Oh man, I'm back on it.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.040
 I'm flipping good now.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.840
 That's basically what's going on.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.440
 I think the vast majority of the time

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
 and then humanity's tendency to see a sign

16:17.440 --> 16:20.920
 in almost anything, it starts to present itself.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.600
 And then we build a narrative in our mind

16:22.600 --> 16:25.480
 to convince ourselves that we're in some sort of control.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.880
 When in reality, I was in a marginal situation

16:27.880 --> 16:30.080
 at best the whole time.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.320
 Yeah, without having much control,

16:31.320 --> 16:33.200
 without having a deep understanding of the system.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.120
 The same story is told in the stock market.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.200
 With many of these distributed human systems,

16:38.200 --> 16:40.960
 we start telling narratives and start seeing patterns

16:40.960 --> 16:43.440
 without understanding actually the system

16:43.440 --> 16:44.680
 that's generating these patterns.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.120
 So if we can see the system, that's incredibly valuable,

16:47.120 --> 16:47.960
 but then you go, well,

16:47.960 --> 16:49.920
 what system is above all of the systems?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.320
 And I guess maybe physics, maybe something like game theory

16:52.320 --> 16:54.520
 explains these things with like, I guess what are the,

16:54.520 --> 16:57.000
 what aspects of the system can I put my hands on

16:57.000 --> 16:58.440
 that I can touch and understand?

16:58.440 --> 17:00.120
 And what am I missing?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.160
 What's going on in the world all around me

17:02.160 --> 17:06.080
 to continue to lean on Dune that I don't have,

17:06.080 --> 17:09.320
 you talk to a blind person about the world,

17:09.320 --> 17:12.160
 about the site and talk to someone that doesn't have everyone

17:12.160 --> 17:14.520
 who's got coronavirus now, so no one can taste or smell.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.680
 They're like, this is delicious, like, is it?

17:17.680 --> 17:21.960
 So anyway, you know, again, what senses am I missing

17:21.960 --> 17:23.400
 or what understanding am I missing

17:23.400 --> 17:27.000
 that's preventing me from seeing the dots connect

17:27.000 --> 17:28.640
 in the world all around me?

17:28.640 --> 17:31.360
 And I think sometimes if we are oftentimes

17:31.360 --> 17:33.400
 at least personally, I've screwed this up a lot.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.280
 I'm so nose deep in the trench of trying to understand

17:36.280 --> 17:37.880
 what I'm doing that I can't take a step back

17:37.880 --> 17:40.240
 and realize, you know, that I'm in a forest,

17:40.240 --> 17:42.360
 not just headbutting a tree.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.960
 And I may be doing both, maybe both,

17:43.960 --> 17:45.360
 two things should be true at once.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.000
 But so I would say when it comes to strategy,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.280
 trying to understand that, but then also you go,

17:50.280 --> 17:52.760
 well, okay, well, how can, that sounds cool,

17:52.760 --> 17:54.400
 but how can you actually do that?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.240
 And then I'd say, that's a really good question

17:56.240 --> 17:57.480
 because if I imagine I say, man,

17:57.480 --> 17:58.880
 I should fight like Steven Thompson,

17:58.880 --> 18:00.000
 I should fight like Wonderboy,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.400
 it's like, good idea, go do that.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.200
 I'm like, not the guy.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.320
 I would fight like Khabib Nurmagomedov if I could.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.560
 You know, it seems to work.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.640
 So anyway, you go, well, what if I could develop,

18:11.640 --> 18:14.000
 what if I could take my time developing skills

18:14.000 --> 18:16.960
 so that when these strategies become apparent,

18:16.960 --> 18:19.280
 they are executable to you.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.840
 You actually have the ability to like,

18:21.840 --> 18:24.000
 in or to again, to be the person in the arena,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.480
 to be the person required,

18:25.480 --> 18:26.840
 whereas there's plenty of great ideas

18:26.840 --> 18:29.400
 like dunking a basketball is a fantastic idea.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.960
 Alas, for me, unless there's a small trampoline nearby,

18:31.960 --> 18:33.120
 I'm not the guy.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.240
 But that doesn't make it any less good of an idea.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.720
 I just haven't developed the ability or I lack the ability.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.560
 So anyway, I think a lot of times,

18:40.560 --> 18:42.080
 at least when I watch people in fighting,

18:42.080 --> 18:43.720
 I'll use an example.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.440
 We're so concerned with trying to win early on

18:46.440 --> 18:48.800
 rather than develop skills that I'm going like,

18:48.800 --> 18:50.320
 well, what's the best way to fight

18:50.320 --> 18:51.800
 with my current set of skills?

18:51.800 --> 18:54.560
 And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route,

18:54.560 --> 18:57.160
 like you put on the one ring,

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
 take the damage you need to take to hit that guy.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.520
 And that was something I realized very early on

19:00.520 --> 19:01.440
 in my MMA career was like,

19:01.440 --> 19:03.600
 I'm not that good at striking at that time,

19:03.600 --> 19:05.520
 not a world class striker now,

19:05.520 --> 19:07.080
 but I'm way better at striking

19:07.080 --> 19:08.120
 than I'm given any credit for

19:08.120 --> 19:09.880
 because it helps people sleep at night, I think.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.200
 But I'm serious.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.400
 But...

19:12.400 --> 19:13.920
 Yeah, yeah, you're always introduced

19:13.920 --> 19:17.320
 as like this master grappler.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.640
 I'm like, that's nice of them to say that.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.920
 Maybe I'm not that good at grappling.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.240
 We haven't even seen that.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.280
 But the funny thing is where I'm like,

19:22.280 --> 19:23.440
 just because people almost go like,

19:23.440 --> 19:25.360
 well, Lex, see, you're really good at this,

19:25.360 --> 19:27.080
 but you gotta understand, we're equal, man.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.200
 I'm good at this other thing.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.560
 Maybe you're really good at what you do

19:29.560 --> 19:31.080
 and I'm just mediocre at what I do.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.360
 That's also possible.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.880
 So there's plenty of people that define themselves

19:33.880 --> 19:35.000
 as a striker that do that

19:35.000 --> 19:36.800
 just because that's for lack of other options.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.040
 It's not because they're really good striker.

19:38.040 --> 19:38.880
 I'm a grappler.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.600
 I was a grappler as a blue belt.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.440
 Not really.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.480
 So anyway, I guess to come back,

19:43.480 --> 19:45.080
 if I'm constantly going,

19:45.080 --> 19:47.120
 how can I win with what I've got right now?

19:47.120 --> 19:48.880
 I think oftentimes I never take the time

19:48.880 --> 19:50.520
 to develop the skills that I wanna develop

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
 and I also never take the time

19:51.520 --> 19:53.080
 to develop the strategies that I wanna develop.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.280
 And that has actually been a one big blessing

19:55.280 --> 19:57.320
 of fighting someone frequently,

19:57.320 --> 19:58.440
 which has been really frustrating

19:58.440 --> 20:00.800
 as a result of injuries and time away

20:00.800 --> 20:03.320
 and some of those people being hesitant to get in the game.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.960
 But it gives you so much time to be out of the trenches

20:06.960 --> 20:08.920
 and focus on developing your abilities

20:08.920 --> 20:10.720
 so that now it's almost like developing money

20:10.720 --> 20:11.800
 like you mentioned the stock market

20:11.800 --> 20:13.320
 that you can now put in.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.080
 Imagine you told me Bitcoin was a great idea five years ago

20:16.080 --> 20:17.280
 and I had eight bucks.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.800
 Man, if someone told me Bitcoin was a great idea

20:18.800 --> 20:20.920
 five years ago and I had 50K,

20:20.920 --> 20:23.440
 I'd be like, oh my God, I'd be sleeping in my bed of money

20:23.440 --> 20:24.880
 that I would then set on fire later

20:24.880 --> 20:26.120
 so they had just to do it.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.920
 So due to all the injuries,

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
 you've been mining Bitcoin all this time

20:29.920 --> 20:31.200
 and now you're a rich man.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.320
 Well, no, actually someone told me

20:32.320 --> 20:33.880
 I was trying to mine for Bitcoin,

20:33.880 --> 20:35.560
 actually like in a cave.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.480
 And then I found out recently that it's actually,

20:37.480 --> 20:39.600
 mining is like a figure of speech.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.200
 You misunderstood. Not like a literal thing that you do.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.040
 But I mean, in my defense, I only know what I know.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.800
 English language is difficult.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.200
 It is, it really is.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.440
 Next time talk to me, I'll explain.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.440
 Russian is more, is a rich language.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.640
 You should learn, you should learn Russian.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.480
 I'll help you out.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.560
 I believe you, thank you.

20:54.560 --> 20:59.560
 Can you do a whirlwind overview of your career

20:59.560 --> 21:03.120
 in MMA leading up to this point

21:03.120 --> 21:06.280
 with the injuries and the undefeated record?

21:06.280 --> 21:09.320
 And then what's next since we're on the topic?

21:09.320 --> 21:12.600
 I did my first fight as a blue belt

21:12.600 --> 21:13.960
 and I've been training for about a year and a half.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.360
 I did nine Jiu Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends

21:16.360 --> 21:18.200
 or maybe eight Jiu Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends

21:18.200 --> 21:22.240
 prior to my first fight in April 2006.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.640
 I got punched in the face a whole bunch.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.360
 I didn't realize it was a professional fight

21:25.360 --> 21:27.480
 and found that out like the day beforehand.

21:27.480 --> 21:28.880
 That was great.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.720
 Thanks, coach.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.880
 It was in Atlantic City where another place

21:32.880 --> 21:34.160
 no one ever goes on purpose.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.200
 So that wasn't great.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.960
 I got into three, actually three car accidents

21:38.960 --> 21:42.080
 in the preceding 36 hours before the fight.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.120
 I had my car totaled.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.560
 I wasn't driving for any of them.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.080
 That was great.

21:47.080 --> 21:47.920
 It was 2006?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.120
 It was 2006, yeah.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.240
 You were a blue belt?

21:50.240 --> 21:51.960
 Yeah, yeah, I've been training for about a year and a half.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.120
 So you're a blue belt.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.240
 You're getting, I mean, if you haven't lived,

21:55.240 --> 21:57.720
 if you haven't gotten punched in the face in Atlantic City.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.560
 That's true.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.760
 I mean, I would have loved to have it happen

22:01.760 --> 22:03.000
 for different reasons.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.160
 But yeah, well, what's funny is I remember

22:06.160 --> 22:07.520
 getting punched in the face a bunch,

22:07.520 --> 22:08.960
 trying to do inverted guard.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.840
 I won one round, lost two rounds,

22:10.840 --> 22:12.160
 definitely lost the fight.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.920
 So you went for inverted, sorry to interrupt.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.760
 You went for inverted guard.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.600
 Can you tell the story of that fight real quick?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.440
 Yeah, sure.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.280
 It was three three minute rounds,

22:18.280 --> 22:19.920
 which is not a professional fight length,

22:19.920 --> 22:21.680
 although I don't know if professional fight length

22:21.680 --> 22:22.520
 would have been any better.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.320
 It's just more time to get punched.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.280
 But I found out partway through,

22:26.280 --> 22:27.640
 I was like, I remember walking back to my corner

22:27.640 --> 22:29.200
 in the first round, I'm like, yeah, this guy can't hurt me.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.840
 And he's like, yeah, my corner was my friend, Tom,

22:31.840 --> 22:32.800
 and then someone else.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.520
 And then he's like, yeah, I would still encourage you

22:34.520 --> 22:36.360
 to stop blocking so many punches with your face.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.880
 I'm like, that's a good idea, Tom, I appreciate that.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.200
 I'm gonna try that.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.000
 Anyway, I remember I was not allowed to up kick.

22:43.000 --> 22:43.880
 So I'm like, great.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.880
 I had no martial arts skills, really at all.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.440
 But if I had anything at all, it was jiu jitsu.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.440
 It was very, very little jiu jitsu.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.120
 But definitely no wrestling, definitely no striking.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.160
 I was basically a magnet for punches.

22:55.160 --> 22:59.360
 So that was your time, roughnecking out in Atlantic City

22:59.360 --> 23:01.360
 as we all do once in a while.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.960
 Can we fast forward to when you're actually

23:02.960 --> 23:04.960
 dominating the world as a black belt?

23:04.960 --> 23:05.800
 Well, actually, it's funny,

23:05.800 --> 23:07.200
 because I took a little bit of money that they're like,

23:07.200 --> 23:08.040
 hey, we're paying you.

23:08.040 --> 23:08.880
 I'm like, really?

23:08.880 --> 23:11.960
 It's like Bukowski stories with Ryan Hall.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.440
 Well, then I went to the casino.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.880
 I went to whatever, like the Tropicana

23:14.880 --> 23:16.320
 that was right there, the casino,

23:16.320 --> 23:17.280
 because that was a boardwalk hall.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.400
 I'm like, you know what, man?

23:18.400 --> 23:20.800
 This has been a not great evening.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.440
 I'm gonna win it back.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.360
 This will be great.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.960
 15 minutes later, they had all the money

23:25.960 --> 23:27.840
 that I had from the fight was gone.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.600
 I just remember walking out of the casino super pissed.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.400
 And I don't know what I was thinking.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.640
 I'm not good at gambling.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.400
 This was not gonna make my night better.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.320
 I just thought that there was gonna be

23:36.320 --> 23:37.720
 some sort of cosmic balancing,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.520
 and maybe it was the cosmic balancing all at once

23:39.520 --> 23:40.360
 for things I'd done in the past.

23:40.360 --> 23:43.600
 Longer term, though, the balancing.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.440
 We'll see.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.280
 I hope so.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.960
 We're all dead in the end, though.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.800
 That is true.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.240
 Time will get us all, yeah.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.680
 Well, so that was the first one,

23:51.680 --> 23:54.440
 and that was when I realized I'm terrible at MMA,

23:54.440 --> 23:55.520
 but I like it.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.200
 I should just stop this until I one day

23:57.200 --> 23:58.560
 learn how to actually grapple,

23:58.560 --> 23:59.680
 much less learn how to fight.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.200
 But I remember there was this guy named Dave Kaplan,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.040
 who's the reason my ears are all messed up,

24:03.040 --> 24:05.440
 who was on the Ultimate Fighter and got punched in the face

24:05.440 --> 24:06.640
 and knocked out by Tom Lawler,

24:06.640 --> 24:09.040
 who I'll always appreciate for doing that.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.640
 But anyway.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.720
 Dave or Tom?

24:11.720 --> 24:12.560
 I appreciate Tom.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.400
 I appreciate Dave, too.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.240
 Dave was great.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.080
 Dave was just a huge bully,

24:15.080 --> 24:17.440
 and used to, not completely unmercifully,

24:17.440 --> 24:19.720
 but relatively unmercifully beat the crap out of me.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.360
 And anyway.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.400
 Well, the ears look good, so.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.240
 I appreciate that.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.160
 I tell people it's a tumor that I got,

24:25.160 --> 24:27.880
 and if they want in on a class action lawsuit with AT&T,

24:27.880 --> 24:31.160
 they should send me an email.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.000
 But anyway.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.920
 Well, you're very financially savvy.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.760
 Very good.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.080
 No, I just give the impression.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.600
 Dave basically said, hey, don't worry, man.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.600
 You're never gonna be good at MMA.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.160
 And you're never gonna be good at grappling, either,

24:41.160 --> 24:42.560
 but even if you are good at grappling,

24:42.560 --> 24:45.440
 which, in my opinion, you will never be,

24:45.440 --> 24:46.640
 you will never be good at fighting.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.240
 And I said, Dave, if I do nothing else in my life,

24:50.240 --> 24:52.720
 I'm gonna keep training until I can make you pay for that.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.600
 And now that I can make him pay for that really easily,

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
 he doesn't train anymore.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.440
 But I love Dave.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.280
 Dave's awesome.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.120
 He actually won the singing beat.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.200
 What an interesting dude.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.040
 Super interesting guy.

25:00.040 --> 25:00.880
 But anyway.

25:00.880 --> 25:03.760
 Virginia, like, speaks a couple languages.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.600
 Super interesting guy.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.800
 Like, shockingly good at Jeopardy, too.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.800
 Not that I'm any good, but still shockingly good at Jeopardy.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.600
 So anyway, years later, met Faraz Zahabi.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.760
 Actually, John Danaher, I met John Danaher,

25:13.760 --> 25:15.600
 and he put me in touch with Faraz Zahabi.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.840
 I started training at TriStar.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.920
 I immediately loved working with Faraz

25:18.920 --> 25:19.760
 and learning under Faraz.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.840
 Started training at TriStar.

25:20.840 --> 25:24.000
 And I did my first real professional MMA fight

25:24.000 --> 25:25.680
 as someone that actually does,

25:25.680 --> 25:30.680
 had practiced a little bit prior in, I think, August, 2012.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.840
 And that was against a guy, he was four and five at the time.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.720
 So, you know, had some experience,

25:36.720 --> 25:38.760
 good kind of like first go for me, honestly.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.920
 And I won that fight by TKO.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.760
 And then it was a little bit of a time off.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.280
 And then I did another fight against a tough guy

25:44.280 --> 25:45.880
 named Magid Hamo.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.040
 He was five and two at the time.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.040
 I think he was three and I was amateur.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.280
 So, you know, a good little bit of fighting experience.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.140
 Won that one in the first round of Iron Rear Naked Choke.

25:53.140 --> 25:56.380
 And then started to experience difficulty

25:56.380 --> 25:59.080
 getting fights at that point.

25:59.080 --> 25:59.920
 You know, I...

25:59.920 --> 26:00.760
 Were you continuously introduced

26:00.760 --> 26:04.560
 as like the master of grappling, the submission?

26:04.560 --> 26:05.880
 At least that was my thing.

26:05.880 --> 26:06.720
 I don't know if I was...

26:06.720 --> 26:08.800
 Is that was the source of the fear for people?

26:08.800 --> 26:10.000
 I think so, because, I mean,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.400
 I definitely wasn't much at striking at that point.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.600
 You know, I definitely am a lot,

26:14.600 --> 26:15.920
 I like to think I'm pretty hard to hurt,

26:15.920 --> 26:17.160
 although I try not to lean on that.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.240
 And I played baseball for like 16 years,

26:19.240 --> 26:20.240
 so I can hit things pretty hard.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.640
 I just wasn't able to, I recognized pretty early on

26:23.640 --> 26:26.080
 that I had no idea how to actually hit things hard

26:26.080 --> 26:28.280
 without becoming hitable myself.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.120
 So I think that's kind of the big thing is a lot of times,

26:31.120 --> 26:33.360
 like we almost were mentioning before,

26:33.360 --> 26:36.640
 if you try to go and get people too early,

26:36.640 --> 26:38.700
 you can hit them if they're not that good,

26:38.700 --> 26:40.240
 but you're going to get hit yourself.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.320
 So you're making, you're basically making a wager.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.200
 You're making a trade of your own life

26:44.200 --> 26:45.440
 for the ability to hit them.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.240
 When you watch guys like Israel Adesanya,

26:47.240 --> 26:49.560
 Floyd Mayweather, Steven Thompson,

26:49.560 --> 26:51.780
 Conor McGregor, when he's fighting really well,

26:51.780 --> 26:53.000
 it's not a trade.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.440
 They're not, you're hitting them and they're hitting you.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.840
 It's, they're hitting you,

26:56.840 --> 26:59.280
 but it takes years and years and years and years

26:59.280 --> 27:00.200
 to be able to learn how to do that.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.800
 Ton Lee is another great example of that.

27:01.800 --> 27:02.960
 You know, my closest training partner,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.120
 one of my best friends,

27:04.120 --> 27:06.960
 and currently now one champion,

27:06.960 --> 27:08.560
 one championship in Asia,

27:08.560 --> 27:10.080
 the champion of the featherweight,

27:10.080 --> 27:14.120
 or I guess lightweight featherweight, 155 over there now.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.080
 And he recently defeated Martin Wynn

27:16.080 --> 27:17.240
 in a really great fight.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.520
 And Ton knocked him out, long time champion.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.120
 And Ton doesn't let you hit him.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.260
 He doesn't let you touch him.

27:22.260 --> 27:25.160
 I feel so fortunate to have met guys like Steven and Ton

27:25.160 --> 27:28.900
 to go early on in career and go, holy moly,

27:28.900 --> 27:30.540
 I can't even, it's not even like,

27:30.540 --> 27:32.240
 oh, you'll let me walk over and find you.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.160
 It's like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up

27:34.160 --> 27:36.160
 with a hammer and smokes you in the melon

27:36.160 --> 27:38.000
 and then disappears into the ether again.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.120
 So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking,

27:40.120 --> 27:42.040
 how can I attack without being hit?

27:42.040 --> 27:45.240
 So every strategy, every idea you have

27:45.240 --> 27:46.640
 about what you're going to do

27:46.640 --> 27:51.640
 has to do with like that minimizing the returns.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.280
 Absolutely.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.600
 I mean, that's what all good fighting is done.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.940
 All poor fighting, you know,

27:55.940 --> 27:57.440
 throughout the course of history, most generals,

27:57.440 --> 27:58.440
 whether they're, so I read,

27:58.440 --> 28:01.520
 or, you know, they did battles by attrition.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.920
 You know, it's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys.

28:03.920 --> 28:04.760
 You've got 50.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.760
 You're like, yeah, if 60 of my guys die killing your 50,

28:06.760 --> 28:08.080
 like, that's great for me.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.720
 But that's not so great for the 60 guys that died.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.980
 You know, I hope it's worth it.

28:11.980 --> 28:13.440
 So when you realize that not only,

28:13.440 --> 28:16.360
 you're not just Kobe Bryant and you're Phil Jackson too,

28:16.360 --> 28:17.920
 you got to do everything.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.000
 You know, if you've got to run across the beach in Normandy,

28:21.000 --> 28:21.840
 so be it.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.440
 But that better be, you should have,

28:23.440 --> 28:24.820
 we make sure we thought this through and there's like,

28:24.820 --> 28:26.320
 hey, there's no way we can like, you know,

28:26.320 --> 28:27.920
 walk around the side, huh?

28:27.920 --> 28:30.000
 Because oftentimes there is,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.200
 and I think a lot of times there's a lot of incentives

28:32.200 --> 28:33.800
 in professional fighting too,

28:33.800 --> 28:34.820
 for people to want to do that.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.220
 And we come up with all sorts of,

28:36.220 --> 28:38.420
 well, I'm trying to be exciting.

28:38.420 --> 28:39.260
 Are you?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.280
 Is that really what you came here to do?

28:40.280 --> 28:41.440
 Cause I came here to win.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.120
 And I think that anyone that's really successful

28:44.120 --> 28:44.960
 came there to win.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.600
 And if it ends up being exciting, well, that's fantastic.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.800
 I hope that people enjoy watching something and that's great,

28:48.800 --> 28:51.320
 but that's a qualitative assessment anyway.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.120
 You know, you want to also be able to, you know,

28:54.120 --> 28:55.420
 live the rest of your life.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.620
 I think it's easy, you know, I'll use Meldrick Taylor.

28:57.620 --> 28:58.580
 I'm a big boxing fan.

28:58.580 --> 29:00.880
 Meldrick Taylor was an excellent fighter,

29:00.880 --> 29:05.120
 came this close to a world title and was stopped with like,

29:05.120 --> 29:07.520
 he was in a fight that he was winning with seconds remaining,

29:07.520 --> 29:08.720
 literally seconds remaining.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.240
 And they probably could have just let it go

29:10.240 --> 29:11.400
 and he would have been world champion.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.240
 And it was brutal.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.200
 If you ever watched legendary nights like a HBO boxing show,

29:15.200 --> 29:17.980
 it's great, but it's heartbreaking.

29:17.980 --> 29:18.860
 It's absolutely heartbreaking.

29:18.860 --> 29:21.240
 And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight

29:21.240 --> 29:22.940
 changed him for the rest of his life.

29:22.940 --> 29:25.540
 And also, you know, don't think he'd never been hit before,

29:25.540 --> 29:26.800
 but it was one of those where you go,

29:26.800 --> 29:30.000
 it's all fun and games until you can't remember your name

29:30.000 --> 29:31.800
 at age 44 years old.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.080
 And I didn't come here, what did Patton saying?

29:35.080 --> 29:37.200
 Nobody wins a war by dying for his country.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.260
 You make the other poor bastard die for his.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.500
 And I think that that's kind of what we're shooting for.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.820
 And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage

29:46.820 --> 29:48.280
 and that not being a big deal,

29:48.280 --> 29:49.180
 like you hear that all the time.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.640
 So and so can take shots

29:50.640 --> 29:52.520
 that would put a lesser fighter down.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.720
 What does that even mean?

29:54.720 --> 29:56.200
 You know, like, so let me get this straight.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.040
 Your ability to absorb damage is a part of you.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.240
 I mean, I guess that, don't get me wrong,

30:00.240 --> 30:03.120
 that is an attribute that's nice to have if you need it.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.080
 But there's plenty of people

30:04.080 --> 30:06.260
 that actually have really porous defense

30:06.260 --> 30:08.880
 that are just very, very difficult to hurt

30:08.880 --> 30:10.160
 for whatever reason.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.440
 That's a fascinating fighter's perspective on the thing.

30:12.440 --> 30:17.440
 I mean, the story that is inspiring

30:18.320 --> 30:22.360
 and I know it goes against the artistry of fighting

30:22.360 --> 30:27.240
 is when you have taken the damage to still rise up

30:27.240 --> 30:29.160
 and be able to defeat the opponent.

30:29.160 --> 30:34.160
 So it's, but that's a flip side of a basically

30:35.060 --> 30:38.600
 you failing to defend yourself properly, right?

30:38.600 --> 30:39.440
 I agree.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.920
 But let's say for, I think it's a triumph,

30:40.920 --> 30:42.560
 that's a triumph of humanity.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.080
 That's a triumph, that's amazing.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.440
 To witness such a thing is unbelievable.

30:46.440 --> 30:50.240
 But you still go, this is, there is a cost here.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.200
 It's like, I've been fortunate enough

30:52.200 --> 30:54.280
 to spend some time working with the military

30:54.280 --> 30:56.120
 and I've been like around and read

30:56.120 --> 30:57.920
 Medal of Honor citations, they're unbelievable.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.920
 Like you read the story and you're like, it'll floor you.

31:00.920 --> 31:01.840
 But it's still a cost

31:01.840 --> 31:03.800
 and you don't wanna be paying that cost a long time.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.300
 And most of the time the cost was everything.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.880
 And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah,

31:07.880 --> 31:10.320
 the value here, it's worth everything.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.040
 It's like, I defend your family,

31:12.040 --> 31:14.160
 defend your country under certain circumstances.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.080
 And if that point is extension of your family,

31:16.080 --> 31:17.480
 you're like, hey, this is worth it.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.160
 To casually throw your life away or throw your health away,

31:20.160 --> 31:21.000
 it's foolish.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.720
 There's nothing great about that.

31:22.720 --> 31:26.400
 And like you said, it's still an amazing thing to see, but.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.480
 But it's also amazing to see you not take damage

31:29.480 --> 31:30.440
 as the Floyd Mayweather,

31:30.440 --> 31:32.360
 it's the artistry of like not being hit.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.600
 And I wonder if maybe that's why people

31:33.600 --> 31:35.080
 don't resonate with Floyd as much,

31:35.080 --> 31:37.280
 is obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place,

31:37.280 --> 31:38.880
 a great man for so many different reasons.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.200
 Although it was funny to remember

31:40.200 --> 31:42.080
 like there were times when he wasn't very popular.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.280
 We love him now because of time of context,

31:44.280 --> 31:46.340
 time to move away from some of the nonsense

31:46.340 --> 31:47.340
 he had to deal with.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.980
 But we got to see him struggle.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.000
 And also he had unbelievable sacrifice,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.040
 both in and out of the ring,

31:54.040 --> 31:55.880
 that we all got to witness.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.040
 We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.000
 And granted, obviously Floyd isn't like a civil rights

32:00.000 --> 32:01.660
 figure like Muhammad Ali was,

32:01.660 --> 32:02.820
 it's different time, different place,

32:02.820 --> 32:03.660
 and he's a different man.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.780
 But basically, I wonder if part of the thing

32:06.780 --> 32:09.720
 that made everyone think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest,

32:09.720 --> 32:11.520
 in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things

32:11.520 --> 32:15.080
 that he did out in the world and the stands that he made,

32:15.080 --> 32:17.240
 we saw him struggle in the ring.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.080
 It's almost, it's humanizing.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.600
 You know, it's weird when people respect Khabib,

32:22.600 --> 32:26.720
 but again, we saw GSP lose and GSP came back stronger.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.360
 Khabib is amazing.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.080
 But I wonder how people feel about him longterm.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.360
 Not like they won't think of him as amazing and great.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.840
 And he's been a respectable person and champion.

32:35.840 --> 32:40.840
 But the time, he hasn't had to fall, if that makes sense.

32:41.280 --> 32:46.280
 And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic

32:47.240 --> 32:49.980
 about sort of the way he was in the ring,

32:49.980 --> 32:52.080
 sort of being able to explain the artistry that he,

32:52.080 --> 32:54.140
 I mean, there's like joking as being playful,

32:54.140 --> 32:58.400
 but really he was able to describe the flow,

32:58.400 --> 32:59.720
 like a butterfly sting like a bee.

32:59.720 --> 33:03.120
 Like he was able to actually talk about his strategy

33:03.120 --> 33:06.480
 without talking, without crossing that line

33:06.480 --> 33:07.560
 into the Floyd Mayweather,

33:07.560 --> 33:11.240
 when you're just talking about money and just talking shit.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.080
 That's true.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.680
 Actually Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit,

33:14.680 --> 33:16.840
 it's pretty good at like talking about the art

33:16.840 --> 33:19.480
 of the martial, like the first mug guy.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.360
 And I wish Khabib did the same.

33:22.360 --> 33:27.360
 Actually from like the Setia brothers,

33:27.640 --> 33:30.180
 there's a few, there's a culture of like being poetic

33:30.180 --> 33:35.180
 about like being scholars and also bards or whatever,

33:36.080 --> 33:37.840
 the poets of the game.

33:37.840 --> 33:41.480
 And Khabib was more like just simple

33:41.480 --> 33:44.640
 and he lets his actions speak, which is great too.

33:44.640 --> 33:45.760
 It's a cool thing in its own way.

33:45.760 --> 33:46.640
 Yeah, it's great.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.880
 But it's nice when you can tell stories

33:48.880 --> 33:53.280
 and that's probably why Ali was the great.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.840
 Catch me up to, you went to three fights,

33:56.840 --> 34:00.640
 I think undefeated, BJ Penn,

34:00.640 --> 34:02.640
 we talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.960
 That's an incredible accomplishment,

34:06.960 --> 34:09.080
 but you fought a lot of really tough guys.

34:10.820 --> 34:12.280
 When was your last fight?

34:12.280 --> 34:14.900
 And then catch me up with the injuries.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.120
 A lot of people kept more and more and more

34:17.120 --> 34:20.320
 were unwilling to fight you.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.860
 Yeah, that's been, that was why I was out for two years

34:22.860 --> 34:26.920
 following the Gray Maynard fight between the fighting Gray

34:26.920 --> 34:28.400
 and BJ and the Gray Maynard fight

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
 was actually one I'm really proud of

34:29.400 --> 34:31.400
 because Gray was very tough.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.720
 He's very big, very strong, very experienced.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.720
 I had only five fights at the time

34:36.920 --> 34:38.060
 and I didn't have a lot of skills.

34:38.060 --> 34:40.560
 I don't get to fight Gray with what I have today.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.720
 I had to fight Gray with what I had in December, 2016.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.080
 And that, it really took a lot of discipline,

34:46.080 --> 34:48.320
 a lot of focus, a lot of challenge,

34:48.320 --> 34:50.400
 to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in that fight

34:50.400 --> 34:52.760
 and to win in ultimately dominating fashion,

34:52.760 --> 34:54.960
 just not in the dominating, obvious sense

34:54.960 --> 34:56.600
 that you see when someone runs across

34:56.600 --> 34:58.560
 and just does that to somebody,

34:58.560 --> 35:01.040
 but that wasn't on the list for me at that time.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.640
 So that was an interesting one,

35:03.640 --> 35:05.680
 but the time away again was very frustrating.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.280
 That was incredibly difficult.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.220
 Before that fight?

35:08.220 --> 35:09.360
 After that fight, well,

35:09.360 --> 35:12.040
 because I beat Artem Lobov

35:12.040 --> 35:13.400
 in the final of the Ultimate Fighter

35:13.400 --> 35:15.320
 and Artem is another guy that's tough,

35:15.320 --> 35:19.760
 a lot of experience and he's a funny guy

35:19.760 --> 35:20.940
 and he said some things on the internet,

35:20.940 --> 35:22.680
 so he gets a lot of heat for that.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.860
 But he just knocked out three of my teammates.

35:24.860 --> 35:27.020
 I'm like, he put a couple of people

35:27.020 --> 35:28.460
 in a pretty rough shape at the end of that.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.960
 So he was doing well and that was a tough fight.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.560
 Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now,

35:32.560 --> 35:34.280
 it would be not competitive at all.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.680
 I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time,

35:35.680 --> 35:36.920
 but it was a compelling phase.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.880
 It wasn't close, but it was competitive.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.520
 So you were improving and growing fast.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.360
 Yeah, and it was nice to have time away.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.800
 I wish I'd had more time in the ring,

35:43.800 --> 35:45.600
 but again, I'd only been doing MMA

35:45.600 --> 35:46.840
 for three years at that time.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.400
 So the improvement from doing what,

35:49.400 --> 35:54.400
 the Bitcoin mining was overriding the ring rust.

35:55.120 --> 35:55.960
 I think so.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.720
 I don't really believe in ring rust, if I'm honest.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.240
 I can understand why people could feel a certain way,

36:01.240 --> 36:02.360
 but if anything, it's almost like

36:02.360 --> 36:04.520
 you just kind of forget what competition's like

36:04.520 --> 36:07.120
 and you realize like, oh, you feel butterflies

36:07.120 --> 36:07.940
 or something like that and you go,

36:07.940 --> 36:08.920
 oh my God, this is different versus no,

36:08.920 --> 36:10.280
 that's just your body getting ready to perform.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.600
 It's okay, it's normal.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.400
 How do you not have ring rust?

36:13.400 --> 36:17.360
 I think I try to practice performing no matter what,

36:17.360 --> 36:19.020
 whether it's singing karaoke and I'm very good,

36:19.020 --> 36:21.800
 but like anything, you name it, talking in front of people.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.840
 You embrace the butterflies.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.400
 Yeah, it's almost like, I remember my last fight,

36:26.400 --> 36:29.240
 I'm just staring at the wall and I'm like, huh,

36:29.240 --> 36:31.600
 I guess I'm gonna fight in a couple of minutes.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.640
 I mean, of course we all heard the phrase,

36:34.640 --> 36:36.440
 like you can never walk in the same river twice

36:36.440 --> 36:38.900
 because even if the river's the same,

36:38.900 --> 36:39.940
 you're a different man.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.120
 That's, I think it's a really important thing to understand

36:42.120 --> 36:44.360
 because at various points in my martial arts career,

36:44.360 --> 36:47.080
 I've thought, oh man, how should I feel?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.160
 I remember when I used to do well in competition,

36:49.160 --> 36:50.920
 I would feel, I would think these thoughts,

36:50.920 --> 36:53.200
 listen to this song, think about this.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.120
 I would feel a certain way.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.560
 And then if you don't feel that way,

36:55.560 --> 36:57.640
 I would start to become stressed

36:57.640 --> 37:00.480
 because I was self inflicted versus going,

37:00.480 --> 37:01.640
 you'll feel how you feel.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.520
 Your job is to show up with what you have on the day,

37:04.520 --> 37:05.520
 do your absolute best.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.480
 It's like, I will never quit.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.320
 I can be sure of that.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.320
 I didn't say I can't be beat.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.680
 I can definitely be beat.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.640
 I could have lost every single fight that I've ever had,

37:11.640 --> 37:14.640
 but I control my effort and I control my attitude.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.240
 And that's, I will do my very best,

37:17.240 --> 37:19.240
 execute my game plan and the event's not working.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.320
 If I have to, I'll put my hands up and walk dead forward.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.880
 If I need to, it's somebody,

37:22.880 --> 37:24.240
 we hope that that's not where it goes,

37:24.240 --> 37:27.120
 but like again, that humanizing moment

37:27.120 --> 37:28.880
 where you're shooting for like just the inner,

37:28.880 --> 37:31.280
 like the inner, you sacrifice the outer

37:31.280 --> 37:33.000
 and all you have left is will,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.800
 and you hope it doesn't happen.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.080
 But if it does, you'll be there.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.000
 But I guess to come back,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.280
 like the extra periods of time in between fights,

37:40.280 --> 37:43.840
 I think was valuable because it was deeply challenging.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.640
 It was incredibly, it was heartbreaking sometimes

37:46.640 --> 37:47.480
 if I'm honest, man.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.480
 It's like, I didn't want to.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.400
 It's just waiting.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.960
 Oh my God, dude.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.080
 Is there politics involved?

37:52.080 --> 37:52.920
 There's a.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.320
 Sometimes, you know, like I,

37:56.520 --> 37:59.040
 you know, it's every single time you step into the ring,

37:59.040 --> 38:00.080
 nothing's guaranteed.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.080
 It's, you could be hurt.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.000
 You could hurt somebody.

38:04.000 --> 38:04.960
 You could win.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.600
 You could lose, you know, throwing away,

38:07.600 --> 38:10.040
 just like I said, throwing away your healthier life cheaply

38:10.040 --> 38:12.240
 makes no sense for anyone.

38:12.240 --> 38:16.280
 And, you know, having demonstrating some degree of temperance

38:16.280 --> 38:17.720
 is not cowardly either.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.760
 I mean, but again, if you wait too long, you have nothing.

38:20.760 --> 38:25.160
 So I guess like I was trying and always being,

38:25.160 --> 38:27.800
 I'm always open to fighting the absolute best people possible.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.400
 I'm never turning down fights ever.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.200
 You know, if some random jabroni decides

38:32.200 --> 38:33.720
 that he wants to fight, I'm like, go away.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.000
 If I wanted to just fight randoms,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.600
 I would just start standing on the table at Denny's

38:37.600 --> 38:38.440
 and start yelling.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
 And I'm sure it would have, you know,

38:39.440 --> 38:41.160
 some people would be willing to indulge me.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.640
 But, you know, you want to fight, you know,

38:44.640 --> 38:46.440
 meaningful opponents, challenging opponents,

38:46.440 --> 38:48.160
 and I know who and where they are.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.000
 And sometimes they're so well.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.360
 You did fight in Atlantic City.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.200
 I did.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.920
 So the Denny's, but you put the Denny's behind you.

38:52.920 --> 38:53.760
 I did.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.160
 And, you know, I'll be honest,

38:55.160 --> 38:56.960
 if I'd have stood up after that fight,

38:56.960 --> 38:58.400
 I don't know if I was in great shape

38:58.400 --> 39:00.120
 to expect to win in the other fights that evening,

39:00.120 --> 39:01.320
 but I could have tried it.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.800
 I'm sure there were some takers in the crowd,

39:02.800 --> 39:04.040
 particularly after they watched me fight,

39:04.040 --> 39:05.240
 they're like, yeah, I'll fight that guy.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.560
 So, okay, so when was the last fight that you had?

39:07.560 --> 39:08.720
 That was Darren Elkins.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.240
 That was six months or seven months after the BJ fight,

39:11.240 --> 39:12.240
 which is great because it's, you know,

39:12.240 --> 39:14.760
 I love maybe five really tough, very tough opponent,

39:14.760 --> 39:16.520
 very tough guy, super tough dude.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.480
 And that was in July, 2019.

39:19.480 --> 39:22.360
 And then right when I was about to fight.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.440
 So you were ready to fight regularly after that.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.280
 Yeah.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.760
 You were trying to find a fight.

39:26.760 --> 39:27.600
 Yeah.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
 And we got Ricardo Llamas, so no one else, none of the,

39:29.600 --> 39:31.600
 I was ranked in the top 15 at that point.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.240
 And then people didn't want to fight.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.840
 We were struggling to find an opponent.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.520
 Then Ricardo Llamas, a great, you know,

39:37.520 --> 39:39.880
 former title challenger, you know, MMA, you know,

39:39.880 --> 39:41.880
 really great history in MMA, recently retired,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.240
 but we were supposed to fight in,

39:44.240 --> 39:47.680
 I think May, March, March, May of 2020.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.120
 And then coronavirus happened.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.080
 And so that scrapped the whole show, you know, training.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.040
 We were just scrambling to try to keep the gym alive

39:55.040 --> 39:57.760
 and take care, you know, I have five or six full, five, six,

39:57.760 --> 40:00.080
 I think five full time employees that I, you know,

40:00.080 --> 40:01.200
 they're my responsibility.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.480
 I have to, their livelihood is in my hands and it's,

40:04.480 --> 40:07.520
 they'd be irresponsible of me to not take that seriously.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.480
 So anyway, we were able to navigate through that time.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.520
 And then we were able to reschedule the Llamas fight.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.800
 And that was in August of last year.

40:15.800 --> 40:20.000
 And I got a, a medical like flag, like, oh, hey, you like,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.240
 you, you, you have like a medical condition that we need

40:22.240 --> 40:25.120
 to look into when I got pulled from the fight.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.480
 And I immediately was concerned because of course,

40:27.480 --> 40:30.040
 any serious medical condition you want to go, oh man,

40:30.040 --> 40:31.920
 well, I guess I would like to look at that.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.080
 Yeah, it turns out it was a giant false positive.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.240
 And, you know, we find that out, you know,

40:36.240 --> 40:39.440
 all of five weeks later and you go, you gotta be kidding me.

40:39.440 --> 40:40.280
 That's frustrating.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.080
 And then we're still waiting for a fight,

40:42.080 --> 40:43.440
 waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight,

40:43.440 --> 40:44.280
 waiting for a fight.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.080
 People won't sign up.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.480
 Asked for a number of different opponents, basically said,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.280
 Hey, I'm willing to fight anybody that's,

40:50.280 --> 40:51.880
 that's tough and moving forward.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.440
 Finally got a, you know, a great opponent in Denny Gay

40:57.560 --> 41:01.760
 for, I guess it would have been this, this March.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.120
 And then I was training in January,

41:04.120 --> 41:05.480
 working on working on some stuff.

41:05.480 --> 41:08.280
 I was out training with Raymond Daniels in,

41:08.280 --> 41:11.280
 in California, Raymond's amazing, unbelievable,

41:11.280 --> 41:13.440
 you know, kickboxing, karate style kickboxer,

41:13.440 --> 41:15.440
 fantastic martial artist, great teacher,

41:15.440 --> 41:16.800
 great training partner and good friend.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.480
 And, you know, just really bad luck, you know,

41:19.480 --> 41:21.800
 kind of a fall in the middle of, in the middle of training.

41:21.800 --> 41:25.080
 And I tore my hip flexor halfway off of my femur.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.400
 So that wasn't great.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.320
 And you go like, man, right at the time where you're like,

41:29.320 --> 41:31.520
 oh man, all right, finally moving forward, you know,

41:31.520 --> 41:32.680
 having the opportunity to fight.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.920
 Dan's a really tough guy.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.000
 You know, you have to fight well

41:35.000 --> 41:36.600
 if you want to have a good chance to do well with him.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.240
 If you don't fight well, it's going to be a rough night.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.560
 And I'm like, that's exactly what I signed up for.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.400
 That's what we want with BJ,

41:40.400 --> 41:43.360
 that's what we want with Elkins, that was gray.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.120
 And then the universe goes, hey man, I hear you,

41:45.120 --> 41:46.240
 but there's also this.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.800
 So anyway, unfortunately it's healing up

41:48.800 --> 41:50.440
 and then hopefully I'm trying to,

41:50.440 --> 41:52.760
 looking for May, I think.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.080
 May this year?

41:54.080 --> 41:55.440
 May of this year.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.280
 Yeah.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.120
 So it's been, it's been,

41:57.120 --> 41:58.640
 it's been about five weeks since the injury.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.120
 You'll be able to heal up, you think?

42:00.120 --> 42:01.760
 Yeah, I think it'll be okay by then.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.200
 Like I don't need a big camp at this point.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.040
 I've had years of camp.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
 Not going to curtail my drinking or anything like that.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.480
 Obviously, you know, come on, man.

42:09.480 --> 42:10.480
 Life is meant to be lived.

42:10.480 --> 42:14.560
 And you know, so it's, you know, I'm in good shape.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.720
 I always, I'm always training.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.720
 I'm trying to do my best to train around the injury

42:17.720 --> 42:19.840
 to the extent that I can right now without, you know,

42:19.840 --> 42:21.480
 hurting myself longterm.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.840
 So is there a particular opponents you're thinking about?

42:23.840 --> 42:25.280
 Yeah. Anybody, anybody forward?

42:25.280 --> 42:27.360
 You know, I mean, I tried to, I asked,

42:27.360 --> 42:28.640
 I asked the second that I got hurt,

42:28.640 --> 42:30.280
 I sent a message to Dan and I said, hey man,

42:30.280 --> 42:32.880
 like I just want you to be the first person to know.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.560
 You know, I just was pretty reasonably injured.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.440
 We just got an MRI.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.120
 Doctor says like, hey man, you're out

42:39.120 --> 42:41.000
 and you need to take like three weeks off, off.

42:41.000 --> 42:41.840
 Don't do anything.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.680
 Or you're going to immediately,

42:42.680 --> 42:43.640
 you're going to tear it the whole way.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.040
 And this is going to be surgery.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.280
 And then it's going to be an additional,

42:46.280 --> 42:47.560
 like eight weeks on top of that

42:47.560 --> 42:49.520
 to start to rehab it through PT.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.640
 And anyway, you know, so I let him know,

42:51.640 --> 42:53.200
 hey, if you can push this thing back,

42:53.200 --> 42:55.040
 I would love to keep on the car.

42:55.040 --> 42:55.920
 I would love to keep the fight.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.720
 You know, it's like, I respect you a lot as an opponent.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.560
 And also it's been brutal trying

42:59.560 --> 43:00.600
 to get anybody to sign on.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.440
 So if you're into it, I'm still there.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.880
 Unfortunately, he turned that down.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.480
 I understand he had other things going on

43:05.480 --> 43:07.720
 and he and his wife were expecting a child coming up.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.760
 So he needed to, he needed to fight.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.720
 And anyway, you know, I guess we'll see who's coming forward.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.760
 Is there somebody like super tough

43:15.760 --> 43:18.640
 in the featherweight division that you,

43:18.640 --> 43:21.680
 you seem to like enjoy the difficult puzzles.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.240
 Is there somebody especially difficult

43:23.240 --> 43:25.440
 that you would like to fight?

43:25.440 --> 43:27.040
 I would like to fight.

43:27.040 --> 43:30.640
 I know that I'll need to win at least one fight before this.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.160
 And I look forward to coming back

43:32.160 --> 43:34.000
 and giving my best effort to do that.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.600
 I want to fight to beat Megumin Sharapov.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.120
 I want to fight Yair Rodriguez.

43:38.120 --> 43:41.480
 I want to fight Korean Zombie.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.520
 And you know, this is complicated, man.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.320
 Yeah, that would be fun.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.680
 I would love to see that fight.

43:46.680 --> 43:47.920
 That's a fascinating fight.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.520
 That would be fun.

43:49.520 --> 43:50.520
 He would be very challenging.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.000
 All those guys are very challenging.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
 And so I look forward to just staying healthy

43:55.000 --> 43:56.400
 to the extent that we can coming back

43:56.400 --> 43:58.080
 and I'm going to fight multiple times this year,

43:58.080 --> 43:59.000
 hell or high water.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.400
 Hell yes.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.000
 Hey, by the way, I completely forgot

44:04.000 --> 44:05.440
 because you were talking about the systems

44:05.440 --> 44:08.920
 and decision trees and the illusion of choice

44:08.920 --> 44:12.400
 made me think of Sam Harris and I forgot to mention it.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.560
 So he talks about free will quite a bit

44:14.560 --> 44:18.960
 and that there's an illusion of free will.

44:18.960 --> 44:19.780
 So it's like the.

44:19.780 --> 44:20.620
 Bold claim, Cotton.

44:20.620 --> 44:23.600
 That the, you know, maybe the universe

44:23.600 --> 44:27.560
 constructed that little game where it makes us feel

44:27.560 --> 44:30.120
 like we have a bunch of choices, but we really don't.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.760
 We're really always ending up with a middle finger.

44:32.760 --> 44:33.920
 That would be hilarious.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.120
 Yeah, that's it.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.000
 That's what you see before you die.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.880
 It's just a giant middle finger.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.280
 It's like, oh, fuck.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.120
 I knew it.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.440
 I knew it.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.260
 What do you think?

44:43.260 --> 44:44.100
 Do you think there's a free will?

44:44.100 --> 44:45.960
 Like we feel like we're making choices.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.640
 So you're thinking, again, what we're talking about,

44:48.640 --> 44:51.080
 okay, here's a system of martial arts

44:51.080 --> 44:54.040
 that's Hanzo Gracie, there's different schools

44:54.040 --> 44:56.400
 and whatever, and then you're thinking,

44:56.400 --> 44:58.400
 okay, how can I think outside these systems?

44:58.400 --> 45:03.400
 But then there's also a system that's our human society

45:03.920 --> 45:08.400
 and we feel like there's an actual choice

45:08.400 --> 45:11.000
 being made by us individuals.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.640
 Do you think that choice is real?

45:12.640 --> 45:13.840
 Or is it just an illusion?

45:13.840 --> 45:15.540
 Well, okay, that's a really good question.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.380
 I'm not necessarily equipped to answer this,

45:17.380 --> 45:18.800
 but I'll do my best.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.020
 Okay, I guess I would say to start with,

45:21.020 --> 45:23.240
 sure would be interesting if it wasn't real,

45:23.240 --> 45:25.160
 if the choice wasn't real,

45:25.160 --> 45:27.220
 would be pretty interesting if it is real.

45:27.220 --> 45:29.540
 First off, I would start with facilitative beliefs

45:29.540 --> 45:31.920
 versus not facilitative beliefs.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.520
 It's almost like, I think the world's out to get me.

45:35.540 --> 45:38.440
 True, not true, what next?

45:38.440 --> 45:39.760
 Probably not a facilitative belief.

45:39.760 --> 45:42.920
 Even if you, imagine you believe there's no free will.

45:43.920 --> 45:45.480
 Okay, now what?

45:45.480 --> 45:48.120
 Does that justify every single impulse

45:48.120 --> 45:50.160
 that you're going to give into?

45:50.160 --> 45:51.720
 Or does the belief in free will,

45:51.720 --> 45:55.120
 does the belief in my ability to work hard, to focus,

45:55.120 --> 45:57.240
 to be disciplined, to improve my position,

45:57.240 --> 46:00.000
 improve my situation, whether it's true or not,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.320
 although I think that at least many of us would argue

46:02.320 --> 46:05.060
 that at least whether there's some sort of internal driver

46:05.060 --> 46:06.700
 that allows for that.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.160
 We live in a material world.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.040
 Your actions do affect the world.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.600
 I can choose to pick that water up or not.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.080
 And anyway, I would say a belief strongly

46:17.080 --> 46:20.300
 in the idea of picking facilitative beliefs,

46:21.640 --> 46:24.120
 and going, hey, I will adjust,

46:24.120 --> 46:26.000
 whether this belief system is right or wrong

46:26.000 --> 46:28.080
 on a cosmic level, I'm nowhere near smart enough

46:28.080 --> 46:32.600
 to understand, but I can say me deciding that,

46:32.600 --> 46:33.960
 let's say, for instance, I'm gonna walk over

46:33.960 --> 46:36.080
 to have a conversation with someone in a hotel lobby,

46:36.080 --> 46:38.480
 and I've never met them, and I go over,

46:38.480 --> 46:40.700
 and I start with, oh, this is gonna be interesting,

46:40.700 --> 46:42.180
 and I just walk over there,

46:42.180 --> 46:45.560
 versus in my head, I'm like, what's this asshole want?

46:45.560 --> 46:47.880
 We're about to have two very different conversations.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.160
 I could be right that this person's not very polite

46:50.160 --> 46:52.920
 or thinks negatively of me right from go,

46:52.920 --> 46:56.200
 but I think that that's probably not a facilitative belief.

46:56.200 --> 47:00.000
 People talk about, how is that gonna help me

47:00.000 --> 47:02.440
 navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion?

47:02.440 --> 47:03.840
 And I think about that for,

47:05.900 --> 47:07.100
 let's say, fighting, it's a good example,

47:07.100 --> 47:08.940
 like confidence, plenty of people believe

47:08.940 --> 47:10.440
 plenty of things that aren't real,

47:10.440 --> 47:12.640
 myself included, I'm sure, all the time.

47:12.640 --> 47:16.320
 And anyway, believing that you can do something,

47:16.320 --> 47:17.560
 I'm like, hey, I think I can win,

47:17.560 --> 47:19.120
 doesn't guarantee you a positive outcome,

47:19.120 --> 47:22.160
 but I would say most of us would probably,

47:22.160 --> 47:23.960
 most of us would argue that it helps.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.160
 Think about depression.

47:25.160 --> 47:28.040
 What's depression if not a negative,

47:28.040 --> 47:31.480
 unfacilitative belief that is not always,

47:31.480 --> 47:33.760
 that oftentimes is not reflected by reality,

47:33.760 --> 47:35.760
 but you project it onto reality,

47:35.760 --> 47:37.640
 and it's understandable if it makes you feel like,

47:37.640 --> 47:39.000
 oh, man, this isn't gonna work out,

47:39.000 --> 47:40.800
 I don't think the prospects are going well.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.720
 And then if you feel like you can't get out of that loop,

47:42.720 --> 47:44.360
 that seems pretty rough.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.480
 And I see a lot of things out in society right now

47:46.480 --> 47:48.480
 where you go, whether you agree or disagree

47:48.480 --> 47:50.240
 with various positions on things, you go,

47:50.240 --> 47:51.480
 is that a facilitative belief?

47:51.480 --> 47:55.480
 Even if that is true, which is arguable, anything.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.400
 So what next, man?

47:56.400 --> 47:57.440
 So where does this end?

47:57.440 --> 48:00.340
 When is the positive, what's the happy ending here?

48:00.340 --> 48:01.760
 And if they go, well, there is no happy ending,

48:01.760 --> 48:04.160
 I'm like, okay, so now what?

48:04.160 --> 48:05.080
 So what do we do here?

48:05.080 --> 48:06.240
 And I guess.

48:06.240 --> 48:10.760
 So choose the facilitative belief, and in your intuition,

48:10.760 --> 48:13.480
 believing that free will is real

48:13.480 --> 48:17.440
 is more productive for a successful life.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.880
 Absolutely, because otherwise, how am I not,

48:21.520 --> 48:24.960
 first off, how can society function if it's not real?

48:24.960 --> 48:27.840
 So how can I blame you or anyone else

48:27.840 --> 48:29.680
 or hold anyone responsible for anything

48:29.680 --> 48:31.600
 if free will isn't real?

48:31.600 --> 48:33.360
 Well, no, that's exactly the point.

48:33.360 --> 48:37.080
 But at the surface level, what you're saying is true,

48:37.080 --> 48:40.200
 but perhaps if we truly internalize

48:40.200 --> 48:42.280
 that free will is an illusion,

48:42.280 --> 48:43.720
 we'll start to figure out something

48:43.720 --> 48:47.640
 that transforms the way we see society.

48:47.640 --> 48:51.080
 For example, we are very individual centric,

48:51.080 --> 48:56.080
 so believing that free will is real

48:56.080 --> 48:58.520
 puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people

48:58.520 --> 49:01.240
 when they do something bad.

49:01.240 --> 49:05.720
 Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion,

49:05.720 --> 49:09.480
 we start to think about the system of humans together

49:09.480 --> 49:14.240
 as this mechanism for progress,

49:14.240 --> 49:17.080
 as opposed to where individual people

49:17.080 --> 49:20.280
 are responsible for their actions, good or bad.

49:20.280 --> 49:24.040
 So we remove the value, the weight we assign

49:24.040 --> 49:27.800
 to the accomplishments or the violence,

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
 the negative stuff done by individuals,

49:29.800 --> 49:32.160
 or more look at the progress of society.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.200
 I don't know what that looks like,

49:33.200 --> 49:35.400
 but it's almost like as opposed to focusing

49:35.400 --> 49:37.640
 on the individual ants of an ant colony,

49:37.640 --> 49:40.080
 looking at the entirety of the ant colony.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.440
 So that, I think it makes perfect sense.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.720
 I would just say that that's a reasonable thing to suggest.

49:44.720 --> 49:46.360
 It's a seismic shift, right?

49:46.360 --> 49:49.200
 And it's hard to say whether that would be better or worse,

49:49.200 --> 49:52.080
 but I guess I'll use this as a convenient one for me.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.680
 So I remember the last time we spoke,

49:54.680 --> 49:58.160
 I brought up one of the most reviled evil characters

49:58.160 --> 49:59.280
 in certainly recent history,

49:59.280 --> 50:01.880
 probably human history period, Adolf Hitler.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.440
 Well, I'm a big fan of making people live in the world

50:04.440 --> 50:06.320
 that they wanna believe in.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.200
 Well, if free will doesn't exist,

50:08.200 --> 50:10.160
 and it's just about how things move forward,

50:10.160 --> 50:13.480
 when are we gonna be high fiving this guy or what?

50:13.480 --> 50:14.760
 Because I remember what I said,

50:14.760 --> 50:17.600
 and that actually brings me to something else we discussed.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.400
 Yeah, for people who don't know,

50:20.400 --> 50:23.080
 Ryan brought up, or I brought up,

50:23.080 --> 50:25.480
 there's literally a giant book about Hitler.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.920
 So I've been obsessed with Hitler, World War II,

50:27.920 --> 50:29.480
 and Stalin recently.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.040
 For recently.

50:31.040 --> 50:35.080
 Oh man, this has become like a meme.

50:35.080 --> 50:37.720
 Joe Rogan with like DMT and me with Hitler.

50:37.720 --> 50:40.160
 Can I pick something more positive?

50:40.160 --> 50:41.920
 Like cat in the hat or something, I don't know.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.320
 But you brought up Hitler as an example

50:44.320 --> 50:46.200
 of something particular,

50:46.200 --> 50:48.600
 some philosophical discussions we're having.

50:48.600 --> 50:51.960
 And the excellent, eloquent,

50:51.960 --> 50:56.960
 and the full of integrity MMA journalist

50:56.960 --> 51:00.800
 clipped out something you've said about Hitler

51:00.800 --> 51:05.160
 and said that, I forget what the headlines are,

51:05.160 --> 51:09.520
 but they were the most ridiculous possible implementation.

51:09.520 --> 51:13.080
 Basically, it was intentionally misunderstanding

51:13.080 --> 51:13.920
 what I'm saying.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.680
 Then it's like, I get that they're stupid,

51:15.680 --> 51:16.600
 but I'm stupid too.

51:16.600 --> 51:17.560
 So I know what that's like.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.360
 So I don't have a lot of sympathy for you.

51:19.360 --> 51:20.200
 Yeah, exactly.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.920
 Yeah, exactly, I can't give you a pass on that.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.840
 But basically, intentionally misunderstanding

51:24.840 --> 51:25.800
 what's going on.

51:25.800 --> 51:29.520
 But what I find funny is that,

51:29.520 --> 51:32.000
 hey, we gotta be careful what we believe.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.760
 And again, back to the cancel culture thing

51:33.760 --> 51:35.440
 that we discussed last time as well,

51:35.440 --> 51:37.680
 where would I like to apologize?

51:37.680 --> 51:39.280
 I mean, no, actually something about cancel culture

51:39.280 --> 51:40.640
 that we've been seeing things culturally,

51:40.640 --> 51:43.360
 I'm like, I will be damned if I apologize for anything

51:43.360 --> 51:44.640
 that I don't need to apologize for

51:44.640 --> 51:46.960
 because I was intentionally misunderstood in that instance.

51:46.960 --> 51:50.600
 Now, you could say that I'm not a historical scholar,

51:50.600 --> 51:51.480
 which I would agree immediately.

51:51.480 --> 51:54.200
 And also that I oftentimes in eloquently

51:54.200 --> 51:57.520
 or inarticulately phrase things, which I'll agree is again.

51:57.520 --> 52:01.040
 But ultimately, going, hey, I wanna make you believe,

52:01.040 --> 52:04.680
 live in the world that you're suggesting ought to exist.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.600
 Okay, so if there's no free will,

52:10.400 --> 52:13.120
 how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically

52:13.120 --> 52:15.280
 before we start going, hey, this is good

52:15.280 --> 52:18.840
 because we're experiencing a social reckoning

52:18.840 --> 52:20.600
 in our country at the moment,

52:20.600 --> 52:23.880
 for good and for other probably, I guess.

52:23.880 --> 52:27.120
 And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?

52:27.120 --> 52:30.520
 So that's probably not something that would fly.

52:30.520 --> 52:32.440
 And I think that's a fair thing.

52:32.440 --> 52:33.720
 That's interesting.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.560
 It might not fly from the individual perspective,

52:35.560 --> 52:38.400
 but if you zoom out and think,

52:38.400 --> 52:42.840
 appreciate society as just like an ant colony

52:42.840 --> 52:45.040
 as a beautifully complex system,

52:45.040 --> 52:49.200
 like we kinda, from the individual perspective,

52:49.200 --> 52:52.640
 we value progress, especially progress of the individual,

52:52.640 --> 52:54.840
 but in whole progress of societies.

52:54.840 --> 52:57.280
 But if you accept that this is just a complex system

52:57.280 --> 52:59.760
 that's not necessarily headed anywhere,

52:59.760 --> 53:02.920
 that this is almost like that river is just flowing,

53:02.920 --> 53:07.440
 I think that removes the burden of always striving,

53:07.440 --> 53:10.560
 of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.960
 So it's possible that if we have no control,

53:13.960 --> 53:17.040
 you can like arrive at some kind of other zen state.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.640
 Does that sound very human though?

53:18.640 --> 53:22.920
 That goes against, I think,

53:24.440 --> 53:29.440
 our current human condition as we experience it,

53:29.560 --> 53:31.280
 but we've communicated that to each other.

53:31.280 --> 53:34.440
 Like we've taught, like through these social forces,

53:34.440 --> 53:38.120
 taught each other that our lives matter and so on.

53:38.120 --> 53:40.520
 Maybe if we convince ourselves

53:40.520 --> 53:45.520
 that we're just sort of like little things in a stream

53:45.560 --> 53:47.360
 and ultimately none of it matters,

53:47.360 --> 53:48.720
 there might be some kind of enjoyment

53:48.720 --> 53:50.120
 to be discovered through that process.

53:50.120 --> 53:54.160
 I don't, listen, I'm a capitalist, rah, rah, like.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.120
 But I guess I think you bring up a really important point.

53:56.120 --> 53:58.280
 I guess almost anything like capitalism,

53:58.280 --> 54:01.720
 I only get to experience it as I sit here now

54:01.720 --> 54:03.960
 and I get to live, I was raised in the United States,

54:03.960 --> 54:05.480
 have traveled around the world a little bit,

54:05.480 --> 54:07.840
 have had the good fortune of meeting many people

54:07.840 --> 54:09.200
 from many different places.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.840
 And I'm an end user of capitalism.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.320
 I don't really know how it got here,

54:14.320 --> 54:16.760
 whether it was, I wasn't there at the start of this idea.

54:16.760 --> 54:19.280
 I wasn't there for, hey, how did we come up with this idea?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.120
 How did we arrive?

54:20.120 --> 54:20.960
 And I'm nowhere near well read enough

54:20.960 --> 54:24.920
 to understand any of that really even secondhand.

54:24.920 --> 54:27.360
 And I guess recognizing that communism,

54:27.360 --> 54:30.580
 Marxism, socialism, anarchism, anything is,

54:30.580 --> 54:33.200
 these are all perspectives that all have,

54:33.200 --> 54:35.580
 I guess, various strengths and weaknesses.

54:35.580 --> 54:37.760
 But I guess one thing I'm always,

54:37.760 --> 54:39.080
 I guess I would say the burden,

54:39.080 --> 54:42.280
 it seems to me that if you wanna make a change,

54:42.280 --> 54:45.880
 the burden of proof is on the person

54:45.880 --> 54:47.720
 implying that there needs to be a change.

54:47.720 --> 54:49.860
 And it doesn't mean that there's nothing there,

54:49.860 --> 54:51.840
 but it's like if you wanna create a small shift,

54:51.840 --> 54:52.680
 a ripple, that's fine,

54:52.680 --> 54:55.680
 but a seismic ripping shift in how we exist

54:55.680 --> 54:57.360
 or how we experience the world as human beings.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.460
 And you mentioned fighting,

54:58.460 --> 55:01.120
 why watching someone undergo,

55:01.120 --> 55:05.120
 take abuse on a level in the ring that's just shocking

55:05.120 --> 55:07.800
 and then triumph in spite of it is like,

55:07.800 --> 55:09.200
 this is unbelievable.

55:09.200 --> 55:11.660
 This is part of the magic of combat sports.

55:11.660 --> 55:13.080
 Now, it's part of the magic,

55:13.080 --> 55:13.920
 the other side of the magic

55:13.920 --> 55:15.120
 that doesn't get talked about sometimes

55:15.120 --> 55:19.000
 is that the trajectory of that individual's life later on

55:19.000 --> 55:20.600
 is not always great,

55:20.600 --> 55:22.760
 or let me rephrase, there's a cost for that.

55:22.760 --> 55:27.760
 But if we remember, you mentioned removing the struggle.

55:28.160 --> 55:33.040
 I don't personally, the struggle is what makes life life.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.480
 And also, I guess, something Faraz has brought up to me

55:35.480 --> 55:38.640
 on a number of occasions, and it makes sense to me,

55:38.640 --> 55:42.480
 it's basically humans only understand things

55:42.480 --> 55:43.760
 through relative comparison.

55:43.760 --> 55:47.680
 I only understand heat because I've known cold.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.180
 I only understand, it's like talking to someone

55:50.180 --> 55:52.400
 that's never experienced any sort of hardship

55:52.400 --> 55:54.440
 and then their latte isn't right,

55:54.440 --> 55:56.320
 and then they pitch a fit

55:56.320 --> 55:57.720
 versus someone that's gone through

55:57.720 --> 56:00.940
 a great deal of challenge, struggle in their life.

56:00.940 --> 56:03.680
 They tend to have a little bit more of an even perspective.

56:03.680 --> 56:07.360
 And anyway, and of course, even as a relative thing

56:07.360 --> 56:09.120
 and what I perceive to be even may not be even,

56:09.120 --> 56:10.600
 maybe I'm particularly softer

56:10.600 --> 56:12.680
 or something in the other direction without realizing,

56:12.680 --> 56:14.640
 because I can only understand what I can understand.

56:14.640 --> 56:19.400
 But the idea that we wanna fundamentally alter ourselves

56:19.400 --> 56:21.040
 as a species and as people

56:21.040 --> 56:25.360
 seems like an incredibly, incredibly high bar to prove,

56:25.360 --> 56:27.800
 and also like an incredibly dangerous idea,

56:27.800 --> 56:29.200
 because it always comes back to,

56:29.200 --> 56:31.080
 well, who's gonna be responsible for this?

56:31.080 --> 56:32.600
 Who gets to do the choosing?

56:32.600 --> 56:33.440
 What's a good idea?

56:33.440 --> 56:34.280
 What's not a good idea?

56:34.280 --> 56:36.440
 And I guess that actually brings me kind of to a,

56:36.440 --> 56:38.080
 something I've been encountering recently

56:38.080 --> 56:40.200
 in discussions with friends.

56:40.200 --> 56:42.720
 I feel like there's only two types of people

56:42.720 --> 56:44.600
 that I encounter at this point.

56:46.120 --> 56:48.920
 People with a more or less libertarian tilt

56:48.920 --> 56:51.200
 to their thinking and people without it.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.240
 And when I say libertarian,

56:52.240 --> 56:54.120
 I don't mean that in the political party sense

56:54.120 --> 56:55.400
 or even the belief system.

56:55.400 --> 56:57.880
 Basically, I'm like, hey, you do you buddy.

56:57.880 --> 57:00.320
 It's not my, what you're up to is not my concern

57:00.320 --> 57:01.960
 versus what you're up to is my concern.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.720
 And I guess I've always watched,

57:03.720 --> 57:05.480
 various points in history, people on this side

57:05.480 --> 57:08.800
 or people on that side are more or less,

57:08.800 --> 57:10.920
 I guess, problematic, I guess you could say.

57:10.920 --> 57:13.480
 And I don't mean that in the internet sense,

57:13.480 --> 57:15.160
 you know, more of an issue,

57:15.160 --> 57:18.520
 but the world is always full of people

57:18.520 --> 57:20.920
 that wanna tell you what you need to be doing

57:20.920 --> 57:22.760
 as opposed to more or less doing no harm.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.040
 And I guess that's one of the ones,

57:24.040 --> 57:26.880
 anytime I'm trying to tell other people what to do,

57:26.880 --> 57:28.040
 I better hope I'm right.

57:28.040 --> 57:30.640
 And it's bizarre to me how many people are so confident

57:30.640 --> 57:33.080
 that their side or their position is the one

57:33.080 --> 57:34.320
 that's not only right for them,

57:34.320 --> 57:36.440
 but right enough that they can enforce it on others.

57:36.440 --> 57:38.840
 And that just seems incredibly dangerous to me.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.400
 And I guess that comes back to even Sam's point

57:41.400 --> 57:43.600
 about, oh, we want to,

57:43.600 --> 57:46.240
 trying to spread the idea that free will doesn't exist.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.440
 I'm not saying it's damaging, but it very well may be.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.000
 And plenty of other things could be as well.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
 I'm not, you know, it goes way over my head

57:52.000 --> 57:53.760
 as to the implications of all of these.

57:53.760 --> 57:56.320
 And I guess all of us are in evangelist for something,

57:56.320 --> 58:00.880
 but I guess it's weird that we've gotten this far

58:00.880 --> 58:05.280
 as a species and now we wanna take like sharp, sharp turns.

58:05.280 --> 58:06.840
 Well, we've been taking a bunch of sharp turns

58:06.840 --> 58:07.680
 throughout history.

58:07.680 --> 58:08.520
 Yeah.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.680
 That's what, you know, that's the way,

58:11.680 --> 58:13.960
 you know, okay, humans love power.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.060
 And one way to attain power is to say,

58:16.060 --> 58:18.160
 everything that you guys are doing is wrong

58:18.160 --> 58:19.320
 and I have the right thing

58:19.320 --> 58:21.880
 and I'm gonna build up a giant cult of people

58:21.880 --> 58:23.520
 and I'm gonna overthrow.

58:23.520 --> 58:27.240
 And indirectly what that results in me is me gaining power.

58:27.240 --> 58:30.200
 And that's how you get all the big revolutions

58:30.200 --> 58:32.800
 in human history, saying I'm done with the thing

58:32.800 --> 58:35.160
 that the powerful are currently doing.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.240
 So I'm gonna overthrow.

58:36.240 --> 58:39.800
 That's where probably all the identity politics

58:39.800 --> 58:43.180
 that's happening now is people that didn't have power before

58:43.180 --> 58:45.040
 are looking to gain power.

58:45.040 --> 58:46.580
 And they're also, you know,

58:46.580 --> 58:49.740
 that's where Jordan Peterson criticized identity politics

58:49.740 --> 58:53.920
 is people with the right, with the good intentions,

58:53.920 --> 58:57.960
 I should say, are in seeking power,

58:57.960 --> 59:01.840
 allow power to corrupt them as power always does.

59:01.840 --> 59:06.840
 And so they lose track of like the devils

59:07.280 --> 59:11.360
 that they're fighting by becoming the same kind of devils,

59:11.360 --> 59:13.800
 the same kind of evil that they're fighting.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.960
 And so that's just the progress of human history.

59:15.960 --> 59:20.400
 But hopefully as these power greedy people

59:20.400 --> 59:24.720
 keep attaining power with a progressive mindset,

59:24.720 --> 59:27.080
 over time things get better and better as they have been.

59:27.080 --> 59:27.960
 Like each iteration?

59:27.960 --> 59:29.080
 Each iteration.

59:29.080 --> 59:31.600
 A lot of unfairness happens.

59:31.600 --> 59:35.160
 A lot of hypocrisy happens.

59:35.160 --> 59:38.280
 A lot of people are trampled along the way

59:38.280 --> 59:40.480
 by those who mean well.

59:40.480 --> 59:42.520
 But over time, like lessons are learned

59:42.520 --> 59:46.360
 or like human civilization accumulates lessons

59:46.360 --> 59:49.240
 and in part learns lessons of history

59:49.240 --> 59:50.800
 and it gets better and better over time,

59:50.800 --> 59:52.840
 even though in the short term,

59:52.840 --> 59:55.380
 there's people acting not their best selves.

59:55.380 --> 59:59.840
 And you know, that seems to be the progress

59:59.840 --> 1:00:01.160
 of human history.

1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:05.480
 The idea of internalizing the free will not being real.

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:07.320
 I mean, you're actually making me realize

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:09.320
 that that ultimately leads to a kind of.

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:12.680
 Doesn't that go in a nihilistic direction?

1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:14.660
 Yeah, it's both nihilistic

1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:16.840
 or if you want to make it a political system,

1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:19.820
 then it's more like communist type of a system

1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:22.560
 where like the value of the individual

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:25.960
 is completely reduced, removed.

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.640
 Or another perspective is like the freedom of an individual

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.400
 is not to be valued or protected.

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:35.240
 And so from our current perspective,

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:36.760
 the systems that seem to have worked,

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:39.560
 the United States works pretty damn well,

1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:41.240
 despite all the different criticisms.

1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.040
 It seems like freedom of the individual

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:47.240
 in all its forms seems to be fundamental

1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:49.400
 to the success of the United States.

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:53.560
 And so we should, it's a, however the hell you put it,

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:55.840
 is like, it doesn't matter whether free will

1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:58.040
 is or isn't an illusion.

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:00.920
 The belief that it's real.

1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:02.480
 Protects the individual from the group,

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:04.160
 which is fundamentally, correct me if I'm wrong,

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:06.520
 that always seems like the big issue of history.

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:09.380
 Hey, there's more of me than there is of you.

1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:10.220
 Deal with it.

1:01:10.220 --> 1:01:11.640
 You're like, yikes.

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:12.800
 And you want to be yourself.

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:13.640
 You want to be different.

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:14.840
 You want to have a different religion.

1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:15.960
 You want to be a different skin color.

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:16.800
 You want to do this.

1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:19.040
 All the bad tribal things happen

1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:20.880
 when there's more of me than you.

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:21.720
 Correct me if I'm wrong.

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:23.320
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:24.440
 But then that's always the fundamental

1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:26.120
 power imbalance though, right?

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:28.520
 Well, the interesting thing about the libertarian thinking,

1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:30.000
 I guess I, I don't know.

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:30.840
 Those words are really.

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.080
 Maybe they're all charged, I know actually.

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:33.000
 Yeah, they're all charged.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.760
 I may not scale up, but I mean,

1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:36.320
 more like on a philosophical underpinning

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.480
 where you're like, yeah, basically,

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:39.800
 hey, you feel free to believe I'm a fool.

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.120
 And I mean, plenty of people do, I'm sure.

1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:44.940
 But as long as you don't chase me down the hall

1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:47.240
 and hit me in the back of the head with a textbook,

1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:48.200
 what's the big deal?

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:50.760
 Yeah, so the libertarian viewpoint,

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:53.120
 which I probably espouse, like that's,

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:57.320
 I'm very much like freedom of the individual

1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:00.720
 is very valuable and like leave others the fuck alone

1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:02.960
 unless they're trying to hurt you.

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.920
 The thing is you also have to, I believe,

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:09.640
 put in the work of empathy of understanding

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:13.040
 what others, how, what leaving people

1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:14.880
 the fuck alone means to others.

1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:16.160
 But isn't that an interesting thing?

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.640
 If I believe in freedom of the individual

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.300
 and I take that, like all of these, like you said,

1:02:20.300 --> 1:02:22.960
 you take them past just their first why question.

1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:26.240
 You ask why, why, why, why, or how, how, how, how many times.

1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:28.720
 Should that not extend to respect for you,

1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:29.860
 respect for your position,

1:02:29.860 --> 1:02:32.120
 respect for your individual lived experience,

1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.560
 which could be grossly different than mine.

1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:36.520
 Yeah, this is the problem with saying,

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:38.840
 I'm an individual, I'm not gonna bother you,

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.360
 you don't bother me.

1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.180
 That's just like, that's not actionable.

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:45.680
 Because to be, to make it actionable,

1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.680
 you have to think the why, why, why, why, why,

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:49.560
 you have to do the steps beyond.

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:50.880
 You think, what does that actually mean?

1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:54.840
 That means understanding how even my very existence

1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:57.320
 like hurts others.

1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.120
 Because you have to understand that like,

1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:02.220
 I'm not, you're not just sitting alone in a room.

1:03:02.220 --> 1:03:04.880
 You're using like public transit,

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:06.120
 you're using the police force,

1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:09.080
 you're using firefighters, you're using the,

1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:11.160
 like you're using a lot of resources

1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:12.900
 that are publicly shared.

1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:17.900
 And some of those resources are unfairly distributed.

1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:21.820
 Like we've agreed that we're gonna pay taxes

1:03:21.820 --> 1:03:24.180
 and those taxes are gonna go towards

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.980
 building some kind of infrastructure.

1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:27.740
 So that's already towards social.

1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:31.140
 So you're not a real, you're not a real sort of,

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.220
 I talked to Michael Malice, like anarchist, right?

1:03:33.220 --> 1:03:37.780
 Saying like basically, full, just leave me the fuck alone

1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:40.860
 and I'm going to collaborate with whoever the hell I want.

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:43.900
 We're not, that's not the American society

1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:45.500
 as it stands currently.

1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:47.900
 We've agreed that there's going to be

1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:51.700
 certain social institutions that we pay into.

1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:55.100
 And some of the sort of discussions about race

1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:56.540
 and all those kinds of things

1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:02.780
 is about those institutions being institutionally unfair,

1:04:03.860 --> 1:04:05.980
 whether it's race or gender, all those kinds of things.

1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:09.580
 Listen, I have a bunch of criticisms

1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:11.980
 of the way that conversation carries itself out,

1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:15.580
 but the thing is, what's valuable is to actually listen

1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:16.860
 and empathize.

1:04:16.860 --> 1:04:20.500
 And that's not often talked about

1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:23.340
 with the leave me the fuck alone mindset

1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:28.340
 because you're, it doesn't have that little component

1:04:29.420 --> 1:04:31.580
 which I think could be fundamental

1:04:31.580 --> 1:04:34.220
 to the function of a society, which is like social.

1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:38.900
 Like it's the, what is it, the Obama, you didn't build it

1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:41.220
 or you didn't build it alone or whatever,

1:04:41.220 --> 1:04:42.060
 however that goes.

1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:45.580
 But basically we wouldn't be able to accomplish anything

1:04:45.580 --> 1:04:48.140
 as individuals without the help of others.

1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:50.460
 And to be able to then start to think,

1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:54.940
 okay, so what is my duty?

1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:57.580
 What is my responsibility to other human beings

1:04:57.580 --> 1:05:01.140
 to be respectful, to be loving, to help them

1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:03.020
 as part of this functioning society?

1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:04.860
 That starts, that's actually a lot of work

1:05:04.860 --> 1:05:06.300
 to start to think about that.

1:05:06.300 --> 1:05:07.460
 Because then I have to like think,

1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:09.580
 okay, Ryan, what's his life like?

1:05:09.580 --> 1:05:12.980
 As a business owner during COVID, what's that like?

1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:16.340
 And then he has, there's employees that run the gym.

1:05:16.340 --> 1:05:17.220
 What's that like?

1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:18.620
 What's that stress like?

1:05:18.620 --> 1:05:20.340
 Or about the fighting and the injury and so on.

1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:21.180
 What's that like?

1:05:21.180 --> 1:05:24.380
 That empathy takes a lot of like compute cycles.

1:05:24.380 --> 1:05:26.740
 And also a lot of energy, right?

1:05:26.740 --> 1:05:29.220
 But I have to go through that computation

1:05:29.220 --> 1:05:34.060
 if I want to be an individual that's like,

1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:35.860
 doesn't hurt you.

1:05:35.860 --> 1:05:38.740
 If I may, I guess like to come back to Muhammad Ali,

1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:40.420
 one of the things he said is service to others

1:05:40.420 --> 1:05:43.620
 is the rent that you pay for your,

1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:45.500
 is the price you pay for your rent here on earth.

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:48.620
 And now one of the things that I think that I see

1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:50.060
 as a result of the internet all the time

1:05:50.060 --> 1:05:53.740
 is people talking about global giant problems,

1:05:53.740 --> 1:05:56.540
 social problems that are society wide,

1:05:56.540 --> 1:05:59.060
 that are massive, truly massive.

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:04.060
 And frankly, beyond the power of any of us to solve.

1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:06.060
 That's certainly on an individual level.

1:06:06.060 --> 1:06:08.420
 So I've discussed things with friends.

1:06:08.420 --> 1:06:10.260
 Like my father's an environmental attorney,

1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:12.340
 like has been for a long time

1:06:12.340 --> 1:06:14.220
 and has been an engineer for a long time.

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:17.340
 And so I'm not, barely know anything,

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:19.460
 but I'm read in a little bit of various things.

1:06:19.460 --> 1:06:21.980
 But climate change, oh my God,

1:06:21.980 --> 1:06:23.820
 I'm so concerned about climate change.

1:06:23.820 --> 1:06:25.420
 What am I supposed to do about climate change?

1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:27.540
 I'll tell you what I can do is I can not litter.

1:06:27.540 --> 1:06:30.260
 I can try to conserve energy where I can.

1:06:30.260 --> 1:06:31.340
 I can do whatever I want.

1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:36.340
 What can I personally do about some giant social problem

1:06:36.340 --> 1:06:40.260
 that I didn't start and is out of my control?

1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.780
 I'm like, well, I can be decent to the people around me.

1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:44.620
 I can mention, I can demonstrate empathy

1:06:44.620 --> 1:06:46.180
 and I can demonstrate consideration

1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:47.780
 for the people in my circle.

1:06:47.780 --> 1:06:50.400
 And to the extent that I can the people outside of my circle,

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:53.440
 but yelling at the trees over problems

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:57.220
 that are borderline cosmic, doesn't seem very productive.

1:06:57.220 --> 1:06:59.420
 It just makes me feel like I'm cool and important

1:06:59.420 --> 1:07:00.740
 because I'm talking about something,

1:07:00.740 --> 1:07:02.700
 well, hundreds of years from now, the water will rise.

1:07:02.700 --> 1:07:04.060
 Maybe it will, maybe it won't.

1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:06.180
 It's completely on my head, I know nothing.

1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:09.340
 But focusing on the problems that we can actually solve,

1:07:09.340 --> 1:07:10.480
 it comes back to the same thing.

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:11.420
 I want to win a fight.

1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:13.300
 I would love to win a fight.

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:14.180
 I can't control that.

1:07:14.180 --> 1:07:16.320
 What I can do is I can control each individual step

1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:17.260
 that I take around the ring

1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:19.200
 and try to make the next correct move.

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.420
 I can't look, no, it gets people's,

1:07:22.420 --> 1:07:24.220
 you know, they get all excited.

1:07:24.220 --> 1:07:25.900
 You know, I'm trying to keep my language in check,

1:07:25.900 --> 1:07:28.140
 but they get all excited thinking about, you know,

1:07:28.140 --> 1:07:30.460
 problems that are like Superman

1:07:30.460 --> 1:07:32.340
 couldn't solve these problems.

1:07:32.340 --> 1:07:34.140
 Like you could be that powerful

1:07:34.140 --> 1:07:36.500
 and you can't make all of the bad things go away,

1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:38.380
 but you can absolutely change yourself.

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:40.540
 And I think a lot of the lessons that, you know,

1:07:40.540 --> 1:07:42.860
 like the good lessons from religion that happened,

1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:44.620
 the good lessons from the great men and women

1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:47.340
 throughout history that we're inspired by,

1:07:47.340 --> 1:07:50.020
 that talk about change starting with within,

1:07:50.020 --> 1:07:50.980
 and, you know, again,

1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:52.620
 treating the people around you decently

1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:53.980
 and treating the people around you decently

1:07:53.980 --> 1:07:55.920
 doesn't even necessarily mean the golden rule.

1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:57.940
 Do unto others as you would like them to do to you.

1:07:57.940 --> 1:08:00.220
 I go, well, maybe what I would like

1:08:00.220 --> 1:08:02.060
 and what this person would like aren't the same thing.

1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:03.420
 Well, how am I going to get to the bottom of that?

1:08:03.420 --> 1:08:05.780
 Cause I could be attempting to be decent to this person.

1:08:05.780 --> 1:08:07.300
 And by my standards, I am being decent,

1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:09.820
 but maybe I'm missing the mark by theirs.

1:08:09.820 --> 1:08:13.140
 Well, I can't possibly, if I just interacted with you,

1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:14.180
 like it's like someone talking about

1:08:14.180 --> 1:08:15.540
 some nonsense microaggression.

1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:16.600
 You're like, so let me get this straight.

1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:17.440
 I've never met you before.

1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:18.700
 You never met me before.

1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:20.720
 And you're interpreting some minor comment

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.240
 that I've made in the least charitable way possible.

1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:25.980
 I'm not saying that you couldn't be annoyed,

1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:29.140
 but your expectation for that level of consideration

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:31.960
 is you're going to be disappointed a lot.

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:34.540
 Now, if you, if we're someone that's in your life

1:08:34.540 --> 1:08:35.980
 on a consistent basis and they're like,

1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:37.300
 hey, I really don't appreciate what you're saying

1:08:37.300 --> 1:08:38.140
 or what you're doing here.

1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:40.020
 Do you realize that this is how I'm,

1:08:40.020 --> 1:08:42.340
 this is how I'm perceiving you go, oh man, I'm so sorry.

1:08:42.340 --> 1:08:44.200
 Of course I would hear what you have to say,

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:47.580
 but I guess trying to recognize that, you know,

1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:52.480
 I guess my job is to treat others with dignity in general,

1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:55.060
 but that level of the level of specificity that,

1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.940
 that, that, that requires increases

1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:58.340
 as it gets closer to you.

1:08:58.340 --> 1:08:59.860
 And I have, as a person,

1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:02.820
 I have a very finite amount of resources financially,

1:09:02.820 --> 1:09:05.680
 intellectually, emotionally, physically.

1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:08.480
 If I chuck, you know, 0.001% of it

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.320
 in every single different direction, what am I doing?

1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:12.160
 It's like when people are like,

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:13.820
 oh, I care deeply about Tibet.

1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:15.180
 I'm like, why aren't you over there?

1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:16.460
 Go build a house, man.

1:09:16.460 --> 1:09:18.580
 Get on a plane, go build a house.

1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:19.520
 Oh, you don't want to do that.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.500
 So really what you want to do is post on Facebook

1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:23.160
 and, and, and accept high fives

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:24.680
 for how much of a good guy you are.

1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:25.660
 I got an idea.

1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:27.180
 Go help somebody in your neighborhood.

1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:29.420
 Go be, go play with, go play with some kids.

1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:31.780
 Go be a friend to someone that doesn't have a friend.

1:09:31.780 --> 1:09:33.740
 Read a book, try to educate yourself.

1:09:33.740 --> 1:09:35.460
 And so I guess to, to come back,

1:09:35.460 --> 1:09:38.920
 it's all of these problems aren't solvable on a grand scale,

1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:41.740
 but it's almost like by attempting to address them

1:09:41.740 --> 1:09:43.700
 in our personal lives, we do better.

1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:46.440
 But rather than a giant airing of the grievances

1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:48.300
 on a, on a consistent basis,

1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:49.340
 not that that isn't, you know,

1:09:49.340 --> 1:09:51.300
 sometimes necessary and valuable,

1:09:51.300 --> 1:09:53.740
 but after you air your grievances, you go,

1:09:53.740 --> 1:09:55.380
 hey, how about we, we sort this out?

1:09:55.380 --> 1:09:56.720
 What's the next step?

1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.220
 And, and I guess, again,

1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:01.220
 when we're trying to address it on a giant social level,

1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:02.420
 it just seems unmanageable to me,

1:10:02.420 --> 1:10:04.580
 even if you have the best of intentions.

1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.740
 Yeah, I mean, but nevertheless, there's,

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:09.340
 there's a lot you can do on social networks.

1:10:09.340 --> 1:10:12.980
 I mean, I enjoy tweeting and consuming Twitter.

1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:15.260
 It's just, I apply the exact same principle

1:10:15.260 --> 1:10:19.380
 that you just said, which is free will and discussion,

1:10:19.380 --> 1:10:23.500
 which is like, I approach it in a way

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:27.480
 that I don't get stuck in this loop that's counterproductive.

1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:30.660
 I try to do things that are productive.

1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:32.540
 And like, it's just like you said,

1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:36.420
 that's like, like what kind of things can I do in this world?

1:10:36.420 --> 1:10:38.620
 Whether that's tweeting or building things,

1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:41.040
 those are low effort tweeting,

1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:42.540
 or actually building businesses

1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.700
 or building ideas out as high effort.

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:47.780
 What can I do that will actually solve problems?

1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:49.780
 And that's, that's the way I approach it.

1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:53.020
 And I do wonder if it's possible to at scale,

1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:56.540
 encourage each other to approach like social media

1:10:56.540 --> 1:10:58.980
 and communication with fellow humans in that way.

1:10:58.980 --> 1:10:59.820
 I don't know.

1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:00.940
 How do you think that would be done?

1:11:00.940 --> 1:11:02.140
 I guess, like to improve the,

1:11:02.140 --> 1:11:03.860
 improve the quality of discourse, maybe.

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:04.820
 Like, or even like you said,

1:11:04.820 --> 1:11:07.100
 the empathy or the decency of discourse.

1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:09.020
 I think people should be, you know,

1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:12.100
 incentivized, encouraged to do that.

1:11:12.100 --> 1:11:14.900
 I think most of what's,

1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:18.260
 we see happening on Twitter and Facebook and so on

1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:20.740
 has to do with very small,

1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:25.060
 very powerful implementation details.

1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:27.420
 It goes down to like, what is the source

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:30.500
 of the dopamine rush, the like button,

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.500
 the sharing mechanisms,

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.460
 just even small tweaks in those can fix a lot.

1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:36.300
 Really?

1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:37.140
 I believe so.

1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:39.300
 So like a lot, a lot of the stuff we see now

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:41.940
 is the result of just initial implementations

1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:44.700
 of these systems that we didn't anticipate.

1:11:44.700 --> 1:11:49.220
 So the modernization comes from engagement

1:11:49.220 --> 1:11:54.060
 and the tools we have is clicking like and sharing.

1:11:54.060 --> 1:11:55.740
 It was not always obvious.

1:11:55.740 --> 1:11:57.180
 It was not obvious from the beginning.

1:11:57.180 --> 1:12:00.180
 It wasn't obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew

1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:01.860
 that there's a big dopamine rush

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:05.180
 from getting more followers and likes and shares.

1:12:05.180 --> 1:12:06.980
 So we've gotten addicted to this feeling

1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:08.300
 like how many people are commenting,

1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:12.100
 how many people are saying, like clicking like and so on.

1:12:12.100 --> 1:12:13.420
 So that's that dopamine rush.

1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:16.340
 So we want to say the thing that will get the most likes

1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:19.900
 and like unmasked in society.

1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:22.140
 And then the other thing that was expected

1:12:22.140 --> 1:12:25.780
 is the controversial, the divisive will get the most likes.

1:12:25.780 --> 1:12:28.780
 So it had to do with the initial mechanisms

1:12:28.780 --> 1:12:32.020
 of likes and shares resulting in an outcome

1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:35.740
 that was unpredicted, which is huge amounts of division

1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:40.740
 irrespective of like any of the basics of human connection

1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:43.380
 that we've actually all come to understand

1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:46.500
 that society is valuable at the individual level

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.900
 like we're saying, but unmasked what results

1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:51.460
 is like you throw all that out

1:12:51.460 --> 1:12:55.620
 and it's all just divisive at scale discourse.

1:12:57.820 --> 1:13:02.100
 I think it could be fixed by incentivizing personal growth

1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:05.380
 like incentivizing you to challenge yourself

1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:08.780
 to grows individual and most importantly

1:13:08.780 --> 1:13:11.460
 to be happy at the end of the day.

1:13:11.460 --> 1:13:16.460
 So like incentivize you feeling good

1:13:16.460 --> 1:13:21.460
 in a way that's long lasting longterm.

1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:24.260
 I think what makes people actually feel good

1:13:24.260 --> 1:13:27.540
 is being kind to others longterm.

1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:31.260
 In the short term what feels good is getting a lot of likes.

1:13:31.260 --> 1:13:34.660
 And I think those are just different incentives

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:36.540
 that if implemented correctly

1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:37.960
 you can just build social networks

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:38.900
 that would do much better.

1:13:38.900 --> 1:13:41.060
 So do you think it comes from a structural perspective?

1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:42.820
 I guess at what point does you mention like

1:13:42.820 --> 1:13:44.820
 you mentioned free will and also you mentioned

1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:47.460
 feeling good and again working hard.

1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:51.700
 I know that you have the, I guess the, was it a race or?

1:13:51.700 --> 1:13:54.420
 No, it's the Goggins thing.

1:13:54.420 --> 1:13:57.460
 It's four by four by 48 challenge

1:13:57.460 --> 1:14:00.620
 where you run four miles every four hours for two days.

1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:01.460
 That's awesome.

1:14:01.460 --> 1:14:05.740
 Yeah, it's a bunch of, the challenge of it

1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:07.780
 isn't just the running, the running is very tough

1:14:07.780 --> 1:14:09.860
 but it's mostly the sleep deprivation

1:14:09.860 --> 1:14:11.780
 because you're just training every four hours.

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:13.340
 But it's a struggle, right?

1:14:13.340 --> 1:14:14.860
 But the struggle gives meaning.

1:14:14.860 --> 1:14:17.540
 And ultimately I guess so how can we,

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:19.260
 because you mentioned like you said adjusting things

1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:22.940
 on like a, I guess like a programming level almost,

1:14:22.940 --> 1:14:24.620
 based programming level so that the interface

1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:25.740
 is different for the user.

1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:28.620
 But at what point does the user have a responsibility

1:14:28.620 --> 1:14:31.400
 to as a man or a woman or a person

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:34.300
 to just behave more decently?

1:14:34.300 --> 1:14:37.420
 How can we I guess utilize, what can we do?

1:14:37.420 --> 1:14:40.960
 It seems like our society is so grossly missing

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.360
 like a Martin Luther King right now,

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:44.540
 like the great inspiring characters

1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:46.940
 throughout American history, throughout world history.

1:14:46.940 --> 1:14:48.540
 Where are the great leaders?

1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:51.800
 So leadership is part of it, but that's definitely,

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.740
 where are the great leaders is a very good question.

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.780
 That's more of a question of our political systems

1:14:56.780 --> 1:14:58.940
 why they're not pushing forward the great leaders.

1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:02.780
 But there's also just, okay,

1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:05.460
 there's some just basic engineering shit

1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:10.020
 which is when you and I, when you Ryan and I

1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:13.100
 are in a room alone and we're talking,

1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:15.660
 even if we're strangers, the incentives

1:15:15.660 --> 1:15:17.780
 are for us to get along.

1:15:17.780 --> 1:15:20.420
 Like just when we're together in person,

1:15:20.420 --> 1:15:21.260
 that's what I'm saying.

1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:22.700
 I'm not even saying some kind of profound.

1:15:22.700 --> 1:15:23.780
 But when you remove that.

1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:26.700
 When we remove that, the implementation

1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:30.500
 of social networks as they stand right now

1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:33.920
 in the digital space, a very different set of incentives.

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:38.100
 It's more fun to destroy others, to be shitty to others.

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:43.100
 And it becomes this endless loop, like you were saying,

1:15:43.620 --> 1:15:45.720
 that's ultimately destructive and not productive.

1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:49.480
 And I think it has to do with just the interfaces

1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:54.420
 of making it feel good to be nice to others.

1:15:54.420 --> 1:15:58.220
 Because currently it doesn't feel nearly as good

1:15:58.220 --> 1:16:01.060
 to be nice to others on the internet.

1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:05.800
 And it doesn't feel nearly as bad as it does in real life

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:07.520
 to be shitty to others on the internet.

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:09.380
 So the incentives are just wrong.

1:16:09.380 --> 1:16:13.300
 I think there is a technology solution to this,

1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:15.820
 or at least a solution to improve

1:16:15.820 --> 1:16:17.820
 this communication mechanism.

1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:19.020
 It's not obvious how.

1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:20.780
 I have a bunch of sort of more detailed ideas,

1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:24.540
 but this is fascinating because I've gotten a chance

1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:26.260
 to talk to Jack Dorsey quite a bit.

1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:27.820
 He's the CEO of Twitter.

1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:32.820
 And he is legitimately has, in this conversation,

1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:35.780
 he would agree with everything.

1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:38.620
 And he's a good human being,

1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:41.140
 and he has a lot of really good ideas how to improve things.

1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:44.220
 The question when you're a captain of a ship,

1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:48.020
 whether it's a question whether a CEO is even a captain,

1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:49.960
 how much can you actually steer that ship

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:51.380
 once it's gotten large enough?

1:16:51.380 --> 1:16:53.440
 There's so much momentum, there's so many users,

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.140
 there's so many people who are marketing and PR and lawyers.

1:16:57.140 --> 1:16:59.220
 It's very difficult to change things.

1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:01.740
 Is it difficult because of the fallout,

1:17:01.740 --> 1:17:03.220
 or is it difficult because it's actually

1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:05.860
 like literally out of this power?

1:17:05.860 --> 1:17:09.260
 So power is weird when you have a large organization.

1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:11.340
 This is why the great leaders,

1:17:11.340 --> 1:17:12.780
 this is what great leaders do,

1:17:12.780 --> 1:17:15.500
 whether it's presidents or leaders of companies.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.420
 Steve Jobs, I would argue Musk is that way,

1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:20.740
 is to walk into a room full of people

1:17:20.740 --> 1:17:23.220
 who don't want you to create drama.

1:17:23.220 --> 1:17:24.980
 It's weird, man.

1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:27.420
 When people just kind of want to be nice,

1:17:28.460 --> 1:17:32.140
 the niceness creates momentum and nobody wants to,

1:17:32.140 --> 1:17:33.260
 it's the systems thing.

1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:34.660
 Everybody just behaves in the way

1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:36.600
 they were previously behaving

1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:38.660
 in the way they're supposed to behave,

1:17:38.660 --> 1:17:40.760
 and nobody wants to raise a fuss.

1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:45.300
 It takes a great man or woman leader to step in and say,

1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:48.380
 what we've been doing is bullshit.

1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:50.780
 Okay, you're fired, you're cool.

1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:51.820
 What is it that?

1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:53.140
 I'm out.

1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:56.920
 I think you have to create constant revolutions

1:17:56.920 --> 1:17:59.780
 within a company that's very, very difficult to do.

1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:03.020
 Structurally and psychologically, it's very difficult to do,

1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:05.860
 to be able to sort of, yeah,

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:08.420
 to constantly challenge the way things have been done

1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:13.300
 in the past, which is why another way it's often done

1:18:13.300 --> 1:18:15.380
 is a startup, like a small company,

1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:18.300
 basically a small company becomes really successful

1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:20.660
 and then no longer can turn the ship,

1:18:20.660 --> 1:18:23.540
 so a new startup comes along, a new competitor

1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:25.460
 that then challenges the big ship,

1:18:25.460 --> 1:18:27.180
 and then that starts out the winner.

1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:28.980
 That's like Google came to be,

1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:31.920
 so Twitter came to be, and Facebook, and so on.

1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:36.780
 And Apple has, that was the dream of Steve Jobs

1:18:36.780 --> 1:18:40.820
 is it would succeed for many decades, for like centuries.

1:18:40.820 --> 1:18:44.460
 That was the idea that you would keep creating revolutions,

1:18:44.460 --> 1:18:48.660
 and under Steve Jobs, Apple successfully pivoted

1:18:48.660 --> 1:18:51.640
 a bunch of times, just like reinvented themselves,

1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:53.340
 which is very difficult to do.

1:18:53.340 --> 1:18:54.780
 Because I mean, I've heard, at least I don't know

1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:56.320
 if this is accurate, because I wouldn't know anything,

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:58.900
 but I've heard plenty of people complain about Steve Jobs.

1:18:58.900 --> 1:18:59.740
 Yeah.

1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:03.100
 But in reality, the reason that all of these amazing things

1:19:03.100 --> 1:19:05.220
 were done was because this person was willing to,

1:19:05.220 --> 1:19:06.640
 well obviously brilliant, and then also willing

1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:09.840
 to rattle everyone's cage periodically

1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:12.140
 and say, hey, what's going on is not what we need

1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:13.140
 to be doing.

1:19:13.140 --> 1:19:14.380
 That's a really interesting thing.

1:19:14.380 --> 1:19:17.740
 So he would rattle the cage, but he would also,

1:19:17.740 --> 1:19:20.980
 I don't know if those are intricately connected

1:19:20.980 --> 1:19:22.300
 or always have to be connected,

1:19:22.300 --> 1:19:23.740
 but he would just be a dick.

1:19:24.580 --> 1:19:28.420
 So maybe by his standard, I am lazy and worthless.

1:19:28.420 --> 1:19:29.860
 Well, he would say that to you, right?

1:19:29.860 --> 1:19:32.060
 Is he being a dick though, if by his standard,

1:19:32.060 --> 1:19:33.680
 I mean, again, it's like everyone's stupid

1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:34.960
 compared to somebody.

1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:36.220
 You know, I guess.

1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:39.820
 But, so you apparently are able to take that kind of thing.

1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:46.460
 Sometimes you just, there's ways to cross the line.

1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:49.820
 And I mean, this is, okay, the fascinating thing

1:19:49.820 --> 1:19:53.580
 about being a leader, especially a leader of companies,

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.520
 is it's a people problem.

1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:59.140
 So each individual in a room, so as a leader,

1:19:59.140 --> 1:20:01.380
 you're only really interacting with a small number

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:02.540
 of people because there are leaders

1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:04.400
 of other smaller groups and so on.

1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:07.220
 But each of those individuals in the room

1:20:07.220 --> 1:20:09.580
 have their own different psychology.

1:20:09.580 --> 1:20:11.260
 Some like to be pushed to the limit.

1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:14.580
 Some like to be screamed at.

1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:18.900
 Some are very soft spoken and almost afraid to speak.

1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:23.900
 And they have to be, you have to hear them out.

1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:27.380
 Like there's a, and those could be all superstars.

1:20:27.380 --> 1:20:29.460
 We're not talking about like the C students.

1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:31.080
 We're talking about the A plus students.

1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:32.980
 Well, it's funny that, yeah, but the thing to,

1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:34.700
 the skill to manage all of those people

1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:37.900
 is completely separate from the skill to innovate something.

1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:39.160
 I mean, not that they're not connected,

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:41.380
 but it's funny how it's, it's almost like, you know,

1:20:41.380 --> 1:20:44.340
 why do we have shitty representatives?

1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:46.700
 Well, I mean, the thing that you do to get elected

1:20:46.700 --> 1:20:48.100
 has nothing to do with governance.

1:20:48.100 --> 1:20:49.180
 Yes.

1:20:49.180 --> 1:20:50.020
 Well, that's exactly it.

1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:52.740
 But the great leaders have to have both skills.

1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:55.180
 So like you have to have the boldness of,

1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:59.540
 if you look at the great presidents through history,

1:20:59.540 --> 1:21:03.140
 usually it's in a time of crisis is when they step up,

1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:07.500
 but they basically say, okay, stop this old way

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:10.340
 that Congress works of this bickering,

1:21:10.340 --> 1:21:12.420
 of this like compromise bullshit.

1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:15.260
 Here's a huge plan that costs billions of dollars

1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:18.140
 in today's age, trillions of dollars,

1:21:18.140 --> 1:21:20.320
 no extra pork, no extra additions,

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:22.820
 just like, here's a clear plan.

1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:26.280
 We're going to build the best road network

1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:27.660
 the world has ever seen.

1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:30.040
 We're going to build some huge infrastructure project.

1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:32.240
 We're going to revolutionize internet.

1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:34.600
 Oh, we're going to, for coronavirus,

1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:36.940
 we're going to build the largest like testing facility

1:21:36.940 --> 1:21:38.820
 the world has ever seen in terms of the,

1:21:38.820 --> 1:21:42.160
 we're gonna get everybody tested several times a day,

1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:45.300
 all those kinds of things, huge projects and say,

1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:48.980
 fuck all this, the details that everybody's bickering about,

1:21:48.980 --> 1:21:51.460
 we're going to give everybody $2,000,

1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:54.740
 we can give everybody $3,000, like huge projects.

1:21:54.740 --> 1:21:56.740
 And at the same time, so that's the boldness

1:21:56.740 --> 1:21:58.020
 and the leadership and saying,

1:21:58.020 --> 1:22:01.180
 throw out all the bullshit of the past.

1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:04.880
 And at the same time, be able to get in the room

1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:06.360
 with the leaders of both parties

1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:08.380
 or for the powerful individuals

1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:10.420
 and smooth talk the shit out of them

1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:12.580
 in the way they need to be smooth talked to.

1:22:12.580 --> 1:22:14.500
 So like both of those skills,

1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:16.460
 it seems to be when they're combining one person,

1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:19.060
 that creates great leaders.

1:22:19.060 --> 1:22:21.080
 Musk appears to have that, Elon.

1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:25.420
 I don't know if Steve Jobs, it's interesting.

1:22:25.420 --> 1:22:28.180
 So the criticism of Steve and a little bit on Elon

1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:31.620
 is he misses some of the human part,

1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:35.200
 but maybe it's impossible to have a really,

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:37.980
 you have like Sadia Nadal, who's the CEO of Microsoft,

1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:41.580
 you have, who's really good on the human side,

1:22:41.580 --> 1:22:43.020
 really, really good on the human side,

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:44.860
 like everybody loves him.

1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:49.260
 The CEO of Google and Alphabet is also the same way.

1:22:49.260 --> 1:22:51.860
 So like, I don't know if it's possible to have both.

1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:54.860
 You only get so many stat points.

1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:59.340
 Yeah, you only get, in this RPG of life, yeah.

1:22:59.340 --> 1:23:02.420
 You got very good at jujitsu very fast.

1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:05.540
 So you went, I mean, you told the story of Blue Belt

1:23:05.540 --> 1:23:09.180
 and so on, but you went to Black Belt really quickly

1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:10.740
 and not just in terms of ranks,

1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:12.760
 but in terms of just skill level.

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:15.740
 I mean, you didn't go to Black Belt nearly as fast

1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:17.900
 as your skill set developed.

1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:19.660
 You were like doing extremely well

1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:21.520
 at a high level of competition.

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.220
 So you're a good person to ask,

1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:26.700
 how does one get good at jujitsu?

1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:29.160
 We talked about solving problems at the elite level,

1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:33.300
 but when you're a beginner at the martial arts,

1:23:33.300 --> 1:23:34.740
 how do you get good?

1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:36.420
 How much training should you do?

1:23:36.420 --> 1:23:38.460
 The very basic stuff, like how much training,

1:23:38.460 --> 1:23:40.980
 how much drilling, and then the mental stuff,

1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:44.980
 like where should your mind be?

1:23:44.980 --> 1:23:48.220
 How should you approach it from a mental perspective too?

1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:49.820
 I'll just tell you my perspective on this one.

1:23:49.820 --> 1:23:52.340
 I guess I would say I feel step one,

1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:56.400
 I feel lucky to have found a good training situation,

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.320
 particularly for the time in where I was at.

1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:04.060
 And I drilled a ton.

1:24:04.060 --> 1:24:06.660
 I drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled.

1:24:06.660 --> 1:24:10.420
 And one thing that's really important to understand though,

1:24:10.420 --> 1:24:15.420
 is that I was able to, in a relatively brief period of years,

1:24:15.820 --> 1:24:18.140
 go from zero to reasonably good.

1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:21.740
 But I think I probably crammed more hours

1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:26.620
 in those small years than most people did training,

1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:28.560
 let's say in two or three times the length.

1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:32.540
 So it may masquerade as something else other than it is.

1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:33.380
 I could say.

1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:34.540
 So you have to put in the hours.

1:24:34.540 --> 1:24:35.380
 Yeah.

1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:36.200
 There's no way around that.

1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:37.040
 I think so.

1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:38.020
 But what did you put in those hours?

1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:40.500
 So when you say drilling, can you break that apart

1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:41.340
 a little bit?

1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:42.160
 Sure.

1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.000
 What does drilling look like?

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.040
 Is there any recommendations you can put in?

1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:44.880
 Absolutely.

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:47.300
 Step one, I would say your choices matter.

1:24:47.300 --> 1:24:49.080
 I think one of the really important things

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:50.900
 that I think we should consider about jiu jitsu

1:24:50.900 --> 1:24:52.740
 is that there's a lot of junk in the system right now.

1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:56.180
 It's like jiu jitsu has exploded in terms of

1:24:56.180 --> 1:24:58.320
 the number of positions, techniques, strategies,

1:24:58.320 --> 1:24:59.980
 this, that, rule sets.

1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:01.500
 That's really cool on the one hand.

1:25:01.500 --> 1:25:05.860
 On the other hand, there's probably a just metric shit ton

1:25:05.860 --> 1:25:08.620
 of suboptimal things that are out there

1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:09.720
 that are being taught.

1:25:11.060 --> 1:25:13.260
 Myself included, I've taught things that are looking back

1:25:13.260 --> 1:25:14.780
 five years, three years, two years, one year,

1:25:14.780 --> 1:25:16.900
 where I'm like, oh, I would not do it like that anymore.

1:25:16.900 --> 1:25:18.460
 Straight up, sometimes I wouldn't do it like that.

1:25:18.460 --> 1:25:20.460
 Other times I would literally never do

1:25:20.460 --> 1:25:22.760
 even that particular movement.

1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:25.460
 I don't think the shrimp is a real move.

1:25:25.460 --> 1:25:28.820
 It's a giant spiel and seizure to show in person.

1:25:28.820 --> 1:25:30.260
 But long story short, there's a lot of things

1:25:30.260 --> 1:25:32.020
 that we think of as fundamental

1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:35.320
 that I think that are really pretty negative.

1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:36.700
 And also, you know.

1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:37.980
 That's heresy in jiu jitsu.

1:25:37.980 --> 1:25:38.820
 Isn't it?

1:25:38.820 --> 1:25:39.640
 The shrimp.

1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:40.480
 Exactly.

1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:42.500
 Is like the holy, we all worship the shrimp.

1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:43.540
 We love the shrimp.

1:25:43.540 --> 1:25:45.020
 We love the shrimp.

1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:47.900
 For people who don't do jiu jitsu, and you should,

1:25:47.900 --> 1:25:52.900
 the shrimp is you scoot your butt away from your opponent.

1:25:53.940 --> 1:25:56.780
 Yeah, in a really, it's like a really athletic

1:25:56.780 --> 1:25:58.980
 looking position where you look like someone

1:25:58.980 --> 1:26:00.980
 that's trying to stick their butt out on Instagram,

1:26:00.980 --> 1:26:02.380
 and then you push your hands away,

1:26:02.380 --> 1:26:04.180
 and you expose your face,

1:26:04.180 --> 1:26:05.980
 and then you lay on your side

1:26:05.980 --> 1:26:08.440
 because someone told you to do that.

1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:12.720
 And you look like a, I guess you look like a shrimp.

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.600
 Yeah, it's like that time that someone really credible

1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:17.100
 told me to drink unleaded gasoline,

1:26:17.100 --> 1:26:18.260
 and I did it for a while.

1:26:18.260 --> 1:26:20.420
 And then it got to the point in my life

1:26:20.420 --> 1:26:22.620
 where the next best, the thing that I needed to do

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:24.740
 to really improve my life was stop drinking

1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:26.500
 unleaded gasoline.

1:26:26.500 --> 1:26:29.000
 And I would say that there's a lot of stuff

1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.060
 that's in there that step one is like it's junk.

1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:34.140
 It's actual junk.

1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:37.600
 And it's not only will it waste your time,

1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:41.020
 it will straight up, it will be like an albatross

1:26:41.020 --> 1:26:43.580
 hanging on you because it affects how you think

1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:44.620
 about things going forward.

1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:47.900
 So although it was, it's funny,

1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:50.820
 like the operating assumptions that we work under

1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:53.580
 have a huge, huge, huge influence.

1:26:53.580 --> 1:26:55.240
 You mentioned like growing up in the United States

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.140
 or this being a capitalist society, like woo, all right.

1:26:58.140 --> 1:26:59.140
 Now, of course I think that,

1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:00.860
 I don't really know any different otherwise.

1:27:00.860 --> 1:27:02.300
 And I think that a lot of times people go,

1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:03.560
 oh, communism is better.

1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:04.940
 I'm like, haven't seen it.

1:27:04.940 --> 1:27:06.780
 I haven't read any books about it being better,

1:27:06.780 --> 1:27:08.020
 but it's possible.

1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.660
 I mean, I haven't experienced it much myself either.

1:27:10.660 --> 1:27:12.500
 So I can't dismiss it outright,

1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:14.300
 but I guess I would say it's a fundamentally

1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:17.140
 different operating system underpinning

1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:18.940
 and all of my choices, all of,

1:27:18.940 --> 1:27:21.320
 if I honestly believed in that thing,

1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:23.740
 many of my choices on a moment by moment,

1:27:23.740 --> 1:27:26.100
 on a day by day, and certainly on a lifetime basis

1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:27.100
 would be very different.

1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:31.020
 So I would say that it's tough when you're young

1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:32.020
 in the martial arts.

1:27:32.020 --> 1:27:33.300
 And I mean, all of us are always trying to do

1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:34.140
 our best to learn.

1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:35.260
 But when you're young in the martial arts,

1:27:35.260 --> 1:27:37.020
 you always go, if you're a reasonable guy,

1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:37.860
 what do they, what do they call it?

1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:38.740
 Like Dunning, Kruger, Amnesia.

1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:39.620
 I can't remember if this is the right one,

1:27:39.620 --> 1:27:42.820
 but basically you go like, oh, I know what I'm doing here.

1:27:42.820 --> 1:27:44.080
 So I can say that's not right.

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:46.340
 But then I read a news story about baseball

1:27:46.340 --> 1:27:48.120
 and I don't know anything about baseball, sounds credible.

1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.980
 And it's bullshit, but I can't call bullshit.

1:27:50.980 --> 1:27:51.820
 If you're a reasonable person,

1:27:51.820 --> 1:27:53.460
 you can't call bullshit on things that you don't understand.

1:27:53.460 --> 1:27:54.840
 Even if you suspect it's not right,

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:56.980
 you're like, well, I've got to reserve judgment.

1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:01.340
 You never, ever, ever set aside your need

1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:04.220
 and also obligation to understand why you were doing

1:28:04.220 --> 1:28:05.060
 what you're doing.

1:28:05.060 --> 1:28:07.900
 And don't ask why once, ask why over and over and over

1:28:07.900 --> 1:28:09.380
 and over about the same thing.

1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:10.500
 Oh, well, I want a shrimp.

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.340
 Why?

1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:12.160
 To make space.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.000
 Why do I want to make space?

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:13.840
 To get away from the guy.

1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:15.100
 Well, why do I want to get away from him?

1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:16.060
 Well, because he's dangerous.

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:16.980
 Well, why is he dangerous?

1:28:16.980 --> 1:28:18.740
 And you can oftentimes get down to, wait a minute,

1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:20.060
 I didn't even need to move.

1:28:20.060 --> 1:28:20.880
 Three quarters of the time,

1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:23.060
 you're actually acting in the other person's self interest.

1:28:23.060 --> 1:28:24.300
 And I guess a lot of times I can't,

1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:27.380
 this kind of goes beyond what we can demonstrate here.

1:28:27.380 --> 1:28:29.940
 But I would just say trying to understand

1:28:29.940 --> 1:28:31.860
 what my base operating assumptions are

1:28:31.860 --> 1:28:33.520
 and consistently reevaluate them,

1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:35.260
 which can be fricking exhausting, frankly,

1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:37.340
 and also constantly confidence destroying.

1:28:37.340 --> 1:28:39.740
 But you mentioned that I did pretty well

1:28:39.740 --> 1:28:40.780
 relatively quickly.

1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:45.500
 I started in 2004 and I was at Abu Dhabi ADCC

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.580
 for the first time as an alternate in 2007.

1:28:48.580 --> 1:28:51.660
 I won a match there against a Black Belt world champion.

1:28:51.660 --> 1:28:53.760
 And the fact, frankly, the fact that I was able

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:55.260
 to beat someone like that was neat,

1:28:55.260 --> 1:28:56.740
 but at the same time says a little bit more

1:28:56.740 --> 1:29:01.040
 about what jiu jitsu is and some of the issues with it

1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:03.620
 than it does about how cool I am or was,

1:29:03.620 --> 1:29:08.340
 because that shouldn't really happen

1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:09.180
 when you think about it.

1:29:09.180 --> 1:29:12.100
 You're like, okay, you're a champion at ostensibly

1:29:12.100 --> 1:29:14.240
 a very high level of the sport.

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:17.880
 You enjoy a three inch, four inch height advantage

1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:21.300
 and a 35 pound weight advantage, and you just got beat.

1:29:21.300 --> 1:29:23.980
 Like that should not, I'm dead serious,

1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:24.900
 that should not exist.

1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:26.400
 If that happens, you're doing it wrong.

1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:27.580
 Is it that I'm doing it right?

1:29:27.580 --> 1:29:28.740
 Or is it that you're doing it wrong

1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:31.940
 and there's enough variance in the way that you're doing it

1:29:31.940 --> 1:29:34.220
 that you're allowing me to win?

1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:36.460
 And now I did happen to win that with the 50, 50 heel hook,

1:29:36.460 --> 1:29:40.340
 which was 50, 50, but basically,

1:29:40.340 --> 1:29:42.380
 which was one of the early examples of like,

1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:45.540
 hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs.

1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:47.540
 And that was something like, we mentioned John Danaher,

1:29:47.540 --> 1:29:49.640
 mentioned like, you know, myself, Dean Lister,

1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:51.140
 a lot of the guys from the Henzo Gracie team

1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:52.380
 that have had amazing success.

1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:54.380
 They've gone and done great things.

1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:57.020
 And you know, Craig Jones in the competitive grappling world,

1:29:57.020 --> 1:29:59.540
 basically taking advantage of being very, very good

1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:02.080
 in what they're doing, but also a glaring, glaring,

1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:04.760
 glaring issue with the operating system of jiu jitsu,

1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:08.460
 which was, you know, a huge vulnerability in the lower body

1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:09.980
 and not only not attacking it,

1:30:09.980 --> 1:30:12.300
 but having no idea how one does attack it,

1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:13.300
 which means you can't understand

1:30:13.300 --> 1:30:15.020
 how someone will assail you.

1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:20.020
 So anyway, I guess to come back is if in the absence

1:30:20.140 --> 1:30:22.540
 of knowing what to do, I try to polish what I've got.

1:30:22.540 --> 1:30:23.580
 So if I've got a knife and I'm like,

1:30:23.580 --> 1:30:24.420
 I don't know how to use them,

1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:25.580
 I'm like, okay, I'm just gonna sharpen the edge

1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:27.060
 and polish it and make sure that when I need

1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.240
 to use this dang thing, I'll be able to do it.

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.740
 Because trying to put together a system

1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:34.260
 when you don't have an idea of what's going on,

1:30:34.260 --> 1:30:37.260
 a lot of times you end up making suboptimal choices,

1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:39.300
 but as long as you're consistently reevaluating

1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:40.580
 what you're doing, and that's something I've tried

1:30:40.580 --> 1:30:42.660
 to do over time, over and over and over again,

1:30:42.660 --> 1:30:47.060
 and try to seek out the most, the best,

1:30:47.060 --> 1:30:51.900
 and also most articulate or insightful instructors

1:30:51.900 --> 1:30:53.780
 or people of various levels, doesn't matter if they're

1:30:53.780 --> 1:30:55.640
 well known or not, that could say, hey, Ryan,

1:30:55.640 --> 1:30:57.460
 I think you should do this, I think you should do that.

1:30:57.460 --> 1:30:59.940
 And I think all I've ever done in martial arts

1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.280
 is try to treat people with respect, honestly,

1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:05.180
 try to demonstrate appreciation for the many,

1:31:05.180 --> 1:31:06.860
 many people who have helped me over time

1:31:06.860 --> 1:31:09.140
 and be the type of person that they wanna train with.

1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:10.840
 Not the type of, because we've all trained with people

1:31:10.840 --> 1:31:13.980
 that make us think about beating the ever loving crap.

1:31:13.980 --> 1:31:15.220
 I never wanted to be that guy.

1:31:15.220 --> 1:31:16.900
 And I was basically saying like, if I train

1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:18.400
 with a black belt when I'm a blue belt

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:21.540
 and this person enjoys training with me,

1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:22.380
 that's in my interest.

1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:24.420
 Selfishly, not only do I not want them to beat me up,

1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:26.500
 but selfishly, I should, you mentioned being decent

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:28.140
 to other people, you wanna incentivize being decent

1:31:28.140 --> 1:31:29.540
 to other people, right, with a structure

1:31:29.540 --> 1:31:30.940
 of what you're doing.

1:31:30.940 --> 1:31:33.700
 Selfishly, I'm incentivized to be a nice guy,

1:31:33.700 --> 1:31:35.540
 even if I'm internally a scumbag,

1:31:35.540 --> 1:31:36.900
 which I like to think that I'm not,

1:31:36.900 --> 1:31:39.580
 but basically going like, hey, this guy's way more likely

1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:41.420
 to help me or this person's way more likely to help me

1:31:41.420 --> 1:31:43.220
 if I shake their hand, say thank you,

1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:44.560
 I really appreciate you helping me out.

1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:47.960
 And that thing that they tap me with four or five times,

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:49.260
 I'm gonna ask them about it.

1:31:49.260 --> 1:31:50.240
 And then they don't have to tell me,

1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:51.780
 they're under no obligation, but I'll say,

1:31:51.780 --> 1:31:52.940
 and whether they tell me or don't tell me,

1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:54.860
 thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.

1:31:54.860 --> 1:31:57.300
 And that's it, you know?

1:31:57.300 --> 1:32:00.860
 Okay, so to summarize, the way you brilliantly described,

1:32:00.860 --> 1:32:02.300
 I just wanna make sure we're keeping track of this.

1:32:02.300 --> 1:32:03.540
 I went all over the place.

1:32:03.540 --> 1:32:05.860
 No, you didn't, you're pretty on point.

1:32:05.860 --> 1:32:09.380
 But so the first thing is basically, which is difficult,

1:32:09.380 --> 1:32:11.340
 I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit,

1:32:11.340 --> 1:32:13.620
 is don't trust authority, essentially.

1:32:13.620 --> 1:32:14.780
 Keep asking why.

1:32:14.780 --> 1:32:16.660
 Be respectful without trusting authority, right?

1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:18.300
 Right, which is, and then the second thing

1:32:18.300 --> 1:32:21.540
 is be the kind of person that others like training with

1:32:21.540 --> 1:32:26.540
 or like being around, sort of being a good friend.

1:32:27.220 --> 1:32:28.980
 So so many people just enjoy being around.

1:32:28.980 --> 1:32:31.660
 So one is completely, which is, yeah, you're right,

1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:34.900
 it's attention, which is like completely disrespect

1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:37.940
 the way that things are done.

1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:40.100
 So asking why constantly.

1:32:40.100 --> 1:32:42.660
 One of it is your own flaws and not understanding

1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:44.740
 the fundamentals of what's being described.

1:32:44.740 --> 1:32:46.300
 And then once you get good enough,

1:32:46.300 --> 1:32:51.300
 not understanding, like going against the fact

1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:53.820
 that the instructor doesn't understand.

1:32:53.820 --> 1:32:55.980
 And my inability to understand what you're saying, though,

1:32:55.980 --> 1:32:56.940
 doesn't invalidate it.

1:32:56.940 --> 1:32:58.020
 And that's something like you mentioned,

1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:00.940
 like me mentioning, keeping in mind our own flaws.

1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:02.980
 And then also, again, the flaws that any of us have

1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:04.340
 is the instructor, to your point.

1:33:04.340 --> 1:33:07.020
 And I guess I can speak to being kind of weird.

1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:09.580
 I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner.

1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:12.060
 But so everyone's a little bit different.

1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:13.980
 Some people, you know, I wasn't terribly popular

1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:14.820
 in high school.

1:33:14.820 --> 1:33:18.220
 You know, like, I didn't like high school very much.

1:33:18.220 --> 1:33:21.340
 But anyway, I would, not gonna be rude to people, though.

1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:22.980
 I was never gonna bully anybody.

1:33:22.980 --> 1:33:24.940
 If you said hello to me, I'd say hello back.

1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:26.780
 I would hold the door for you if you walked by.

1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:29.740
 You know, and I would just say, like simple things like that

1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:31.660
 go a long, long, long way.

1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:35.420
 And that actually takes us back to our social discussion

1:33:35.420 --> 1:33:37.660
 where I'm like, oh man, how do I become great at jiu jitsu?

1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:40.380
 It's like, well, I'll start by not pissing off this person

1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:41.940
 who can beat the crap out of me

1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:45.340
 and not disrespecting the person who is probably

1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:47.780
 the closest thing to a font of knowledge

1:33:47.780 --> 1:33:48.980
 at that time for me.

1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:52.300
 So, and then recognizing that I should do that

1:33:52.300 --> 1:33:54.260
 for its own virtue because it's the right thing to do

1:33:54.260 --> 1:33:55.700
 and I should try to treat people decently.

1:33:55.700 --> 1:33:57.980
 But beyond that, even selfishly,

1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.500
 it's in my interest to do that.

1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:02.460
 But see, the thing is, this is interesting,

1:34:02.460 --> 1:34:06.500
 is there's a culture in martial arts,

1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:08.860
 a culture that I like where the instructor,

1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:13.860
 legitimately so, carries an aura of authority.

1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:18.340
 And it's not comfortable to really ask why.

1:34:18.340 --> 1:34:22.740
 I'm not, it's a skill to be able to have a discussion

1:34:22.740 --> 1:34:26.140
 as a white belt or the black belt instructor

1:34:26.140 --> 1:34:28.500
 of like, why is it done this way?

1:34:29.380 --> 1:34:31.500
 Like, and saying why again.

1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:36.220
 Like, I mean, it's a skill to show that you're actually

1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:40.180
 a legitimately curious and passionate and compassionate

1:34:40.180 --> 1:34:42.500
 student versus like, somebody who's just being

1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:45.220
 an annoying dick who saw some stuff on YouTube.

1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:47.900
 There's a line between, to walk there.

1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:52.420
 I just wonder because like, it's the drilling thing.

1:34:52.420 --> 1:34:57.420
 And, you know, I, for example, like in my,

1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:00.140
 when I was coming out, there was so much emphasis

1:35:00.140 --> 1:35:02.220
 placed on like, close guard, for example.

1:35:03.420 --> 1:35:05.780
 And you might actually teach me now,

1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:08.620
 I don't know, but to me it was like,

1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:12.580
 why do I need to master the close guard?

1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:16.260
 Like, why is the close guard on top or the bottom?

1:35:16.260 --> 1:35:20.260
 But the bottom really, the fundamental basics of jiu jitsu.

1:35:20.260 --> 1:35:21.300
 Who decided that?

1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:25.060
 My body is not, my body says this is wrong.

1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:28.100
 I'm like, this, like I have short legs,

1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:30.220
 but it doesn't even matter the length of the legs.

1:35:30.220 --> 1:35:31.900
 There's something about me that just,

1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:34.360
 I don't understand how leverage here works

1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:37.420
 for my particular body.

1:35:37.420 --> 1:35:40.900
 Like, so it's just, it's a feel thing too.

1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:45.060
 Like, it feels like in my basic understanding

1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:47.980
 of leverage and movement and timing and so on,

1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:50.220
 it feels like these certain, like butterfly guard,

1:35:50.220 --> 1:35:53.180
 or even like half, basically every guard except close guard.

1:35:53.180 --> 1:35:56.260
 I can play, I can dance.

1:35:56.260 --> 1:36:00.780
 Close guard feels like you're shutting down

1:36:02.060 --> 1:36:03.380
 like the play that I.

1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:04.380
 Is that wrong?

1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:06.460
 Or is that, make sure that's what you want

1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:08.660
 because that's almost like an innate characteristic

1:36:08.660 --> 1:36:11.020
 of this guard position, but it's not sold that way, right?

1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:12.860
 It's like, hey, this is a good guard.

1:36:12.860 --> 1:36:16.300
 It's like, hey man, here's a bow and arrow versus,

1:36:16.300 --> 1:36:17.660
 and you know how to use this thing, right?

1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:19.500
 Like make sure you're far away

1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:21.140
 and like up on a hill or something.

1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:22.060
 Cause you can take that bow and arrow,

1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:24.660
 run up on something and try to use it.

1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:27.180
 But if nobody told you not to do that

1:36:27.180 --> 1:36:28.460
 and they told you it was foundational,

1:36:28.460 --> 1:36:29.780
 it's very foundational, it's very important.

1:36:29.780 --> 1:36:31.660
 To everything else too, right?

1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:33.420
 That's back to the shrimping thing.

1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:35.900
 How many things are we taught that even if it's not,

1:36:35.900 --> 1:36:39.180
 let's say itself is not a garbage thing,

1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:42.020
 might be effectively garbage.

1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:43.580
 You could give me a Ferrari,

1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:46.860
 but if I try to make it fly, it's not going to work.

1:36:46.860 --> 1:36:48.820
 If you're like, here's a plane, here's another plane,

1:36:48.820 --> 1:36:50.780
 here's another plane, here's another plane, here's a Ferrari.

1:36:50.780 --> 1:36:52.620
 I'm like, oh, it must be a different type of plane.

1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:55.020
 Like you could be forgiven for leap if we're going there,

1:36:55.020 --> 1:36:56.260
 you know, like, oh, maybe the wings come out

1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:57.940
 or you just go fast enough to take a bullet.

1:36:57.940 --> 1:36:59.740
 You can make these crazy leaps in your mind.

1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:02.540
 And people are doing that all the time.

1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:05.140
 So if you don't provide the context for me,

1:37:05.140 --> 1:37:08.060
 or worse yet, you provide improper context,

1:37:08.060 --> 1:37:10.940
 like how much of a problem is that going to be?

1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:14.340
 Well, I think the skill of the white belt should be,

1:37:14.340 --> 1:37:15.660
 just be nice.

1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:20.300
 But in the complicated human space of when your intention,

1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:23.900
 at least in the big picture view, is good.

1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:28.740
 The question is, it's not always when your intention is good,

1:37:28.740 --> 1:37:32.780
 the actual implementation of it is good.

1:37:32.780 --> 1:37:34.540
 So you might be just almost,

1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:37.300
 and that's much, it's not the case for you,

1:37:37.300 --> 1:37:39.260
 it's much more the case for white belts.

1:37:39.260 --> 1:37:41.620
 They don't even know, their intention might be good,

1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:43.940
 but they don't know all the lines they're crossing,

1:37:43.940 --> 1:37:48.340
 all the, so they're not actually able to like interpret

1:37:48.340 --> 1:37:51.940
 all the ways in which they're being totally insensitive

1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:55.100
 to the requests of others, like explicit requests of others.

1:37:55.100 --> 1:37:59.660
 So your job as a beginner is to be a really good listener

1:37:59.660 --> 1:38:01.260
 of those social cues.

1:38:01.260 --> 1:38:02.900
 Well, it's like a visitor in a foreign country, right?

1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:03.740
 Yeah.

1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:04.820
 Like you're a representative of people

1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:06.660
 that look like you, people that talk like you,

1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:07.940
 people that have your passport,

1:38:07.940 --> 1:38:09.220
 and you're like, man, I'm going to go over here.

1:38:09.220 --> 1:38:10.780
 Oh, I've got my foot up on my knee.

1:38:10.780 --> 1:38:12.020
 Well, if I was in certain countries in the world,

1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:12.980
 that's rude.

1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:14.620
 I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry.

1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:15.740
 But can you imagine if someone says,

1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.740
 hey, I really appreciate if you take your foot off,

1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:18.580
 that's pretty rude.

1:38:18.580 --> 1:38:21.380
 And then I want to tell them, well, not where I'm from, man.

1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:22.380
 I'm in your house.

1:38:22.380 --> 1:38:24.660
 I better, again, I might go that direction,

1:38:24.660 --> 1:38:25.860
 but let's say I could get away with that.

1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:27.020
 Now I'm a bully.

1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:28.540
 And if I can't get away with that,

1:38:28.540 --> 1:38:30.820
 well, I'm about to maybe be on the wrong side of something.

1:38:30.820 --> 1:38:33.140
 But I guess, like you said,

1:38:33.140 --> 1:38:34.700
 if we have positive intention, that's fine.

1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:36.020
 But I also have to recognize who I am.

1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.980
 And I think that that's one thing that I tried to do

1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:40.820
 and continue to try to do over time.

1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:43.300
 Like we're, oh man, hi,

1:38:43.300 --> 1:38:45.180
 I'm the one that's asking for a favor here.

1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:46.580
 If I spar with Raymond Daniels,

1:38:46.580 --> 1:38:48.460
 Raymond Daniels is doing me a favor.

1:38:48.460 --> 1:38:49.780
 I ain't doing him a favor.

1:38:49.780 --> 1:38:51.300
 Let's not get it twisted.

1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:53.260
 So thank you so much for your time.

1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:54.100
 I really appreciate it.

1:38:54.100 --> 1:38:56.140
 And this is not like some effected nonsense.

1:38:56.140 --> 1:38:56.980
 This is serious.

1:38:56.980 --> 1:38:57.820
 I'm like, thank you.

1:38:57.820 --> 1:38:58.940
 If I spar with Steven Thompson,

1:38:58.940 --> 1:39:00.060
 I'm the one being done a favor.

1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:01.700
 George St. Pierre takes his time to spar with me,

1:39:01.700 --> 1:39:04.060
 which he has in the past and not even kill me,

1:39:04.060 --> 1:39:05.540
 which is really, I appreciate that

1:39:05.540 --> 1:39:07.860
 because that's why I can sit here.

1:39:07.860 --> 1:39:11.580
 George is not a prop for me to get my rocks off

1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:12.620
 or see what's going on.

1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:14.060
 And also I'm going to do that

1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:16.380
 and then expect him to just take it.

1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:17.740
 And I've seen, he's a gentleman.

1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:19.140
 I've seen people get nuts with George

1:39:19.140 --> 1:39:23.740
 and have him just be like, he's a patient of a saint.

1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:24.780
 I don't have that level of patience,

1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:26.620
 but I would just say to come back,

1:39:26.620 --> 1:39:28.980
 figuring out like, hey, so what role am I here?

1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:30.100
 And that comes back to like,

1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:31.740
 at least what I see people on the internet.

1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:33.660
 Yeah, man, I have a beef with Joe Rogan.

1:39:33.660 --> 1:39:35.100
 You're like, no, you don't, Ryan.

1:39:35.100 --> 1:39:36.380
 You're some goof.

1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:37.660
 I'm like, I'm some random dude.

1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:39.100
 Joe, like people want to,

1:39:39.100 --> 1:39:40.340
 they almost want to like elevate

1:39:40.340 --> 1:39:42.900
 so that we can somehow be level with peers here.

1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:44.500
 If I go into Feroz Zahabi's gym,

1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:45.860
 I am not a peer of Feroz Zahabi.

1:39:45.860 --> 1:39:47.260
 I am a student of TriStar.

1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:48.780
 I'm a guest in the academy.

1:39:48.780 --> 1:39:51.180
 And if Feroz asked me for something short of him,

1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:53.380
 like telling me to try to do a triple backflip

1:39:53.380 --> 1:39:54.660
 so I don't break my neck,

1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:56.660
 the answer is yes, sir, I can do a free Feroz.

1:39:56.660 --> 1:39:57.500
 No, man, in no words.

1:39:57.500 --> 1:39:59.140
 And it's, and hopefully it should come with,

1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:00.940
 I guess, a level of graciousness,

1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:02.340
 but I guess that's kind of one of the things

1:40:02.340 --> 1:40:04.900
 that I see nowadays with how accessible people are.

1:40:04.900 --> 1:40:06.420
 Cause I grew up, you know, being a big,

1:40:06.420 --> 1:40:08.580
 huge baseball sports fan of all kinds.

1:40:08.580 --> 1:40:10.980
 I couldn't send Derek Jeter a message

1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:14.700
 and much less have a possibility of a reply.

1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:17.620
 And if I do, it's like, you know,

1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:18.780
 I have people send me messages.

1:40:18.780 --> 1:40:20.100
 It's very nice that people send me messages.

1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:21.540
 Some people, again, and everyone,

1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:23.580
 not everyone is coming from the same place,

1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:25.100
 but I've had plenty of things that are like,

1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:26.900
 yo, dude, I need you to do this for me.

1:40:26.900 --> 1:40:29.620
 I'm like, well, I'll tell you what's never going to happen.

1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:31.340
 That I have no idea who you are.

1:40:31.340 --> 1:40:32.820
 And that was how I was addressed.

1:40:32.820 --> 1:40:34.860
 And I don't need, oh man, you're the greatest one

1:40:34.860 --> 1:40:36.580
 because that's weird and too, cause I'm not,

1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:39.340
 but just, hey Ryan, how are you doing?

1:40:39.340 --> 1:40:41.060
 Hey, do you think you could do the following

1:40:41.060 --> 1:40:41.900
 if you get a second?

1:40:41.900 --> 1:40:43.620
 I'm like, if I get a second, you're dang right I can.

1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:44.980
 Why not? It's easy to ask.

1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:47.540
 But it started with some level of politeness.

1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:50.340
 And I guess like that's maybe being semi Southern,

1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:51.420
 like I grew up in Virginia.

1:40:51.420 --> 1:40:52.500
 Yes, sir. Yes, ma'm.

1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:54.260
 Like that goes a long way.

1:40:54.260 --> 1:40:55.300
 And there's all different kinds

1:40:55.300 --> 1:40:56.860
 of implementations of politeness.

1:40:56.860 --> 1:40:59.620
 I mean, most of the successful people I've met,

1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:03.700
 it's been surprising to me how much of,

1:41:03.700 --> 1:41:08.500
 you mentioned peers, like I could think of Joe Rogan.

1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:11.020
 You mentioned Joe Rogan, but Elon Musk,

1:41:12.300 --> 1:41:17.300
 they don't, like they almost treat me like I'm the superior.

1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:18.540
 You know what I mean?

1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:21.180
 Like it's not even, that's the politeness.

1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:23.340
 Like, you know, that's the approach.

1:41:23.340 --> 1:41:25.180
 The feeling of it is like, I'm the student,

1:41:25.180 --> 1:41:27.620
 I'm the beginner, I'm like approaching the situation.

1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:32.620
 Like it's almost like a method acting of like,

1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:34.960
 you're better than me.

1:41:36.020 --> 1:41:38.180
 And that's how I approach a lot of interactions.

1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:39.620
 Like I have something to learn from this,

1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:41.220
 even if it's like a young.

1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:42.800
 Do you think that they're ungenuine?

1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:44.380
 They're totally genuine.

1:41:44.380 --> 1:41:45.300
 But isn't that a funny thing?

1:41:45.300 --> 1:41:46.400
 Like in spite of who they are,

1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:48.080
 they're incredibly genuine because they respect,

1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:49.860
 correct me if I'm wrong, they respect you obviously

1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:50.700
 for what you bring to the table.

1:41:50.700 --> 1:41:51.540
 They also approach.

1:41:51.540 --> 1:41:52.360
 No, no, they approach everybody like this.

1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:53.200
 But that's all right.

1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:54.820
 No, but I'm sure they respect for what you bring to the table.

1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:56.300
 Beyond that though, they're treating you

1:41:56.300 --> 1:41:57.340
 with dignity as a human being.

1:41:57.340 --> 1:41:59.420
 Yeah, as a human being, that's right.

1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:01.340
 And when they could probably get away

1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:02.340
 with treating most people

1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:03.860
 without a whole heck of a lot of dignity.

1:42:03.860 --> 1:42:05.500
 And I guess what does that always say that like, you know,

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:08.280
 again, like you can always tell someone of quality

1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:11.760
 because they treat the king and the janitor the same way.

1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:13.340
 But that's what we're seeing a lot.

1:42:13.340 --> 1:42:16.020
 Like, I guess I don't mean to like to nitpick,

1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:18.220
 but that's where it would take issue, I guess a little bit,

1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:19.060
 or disagree with the next.

1:42:19.060 --> 1:42:21.400
 Are you gonna criticize with the internet again?

1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:22.240
 I know.

1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:23.620
 People on the internet.

1:42:23.620 --> 1:42:25.260
 Old man yells at clouds.

1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:30.040
 But anyway, but I guess what I mean is just like

1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:31.660
 the way that people address each other

1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:33.700
 because it's so casual now, you know,

1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:35.600
 and it's great on the one hand, it's nice.

1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:39.460
 On the other hand, you go, hey, I just, why can't do,

1:42:39.460 --> 1:42:42.600
 am I somehow, am I worried about diminishing myself?

1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:44.220
 It's like the way that I'm sure that people talk to like,

1:42:44.220 --> 1:42:45.720
 talk to women sometimes.

1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:48.700
 And words, what's up girl?

1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:49.620
 I mean, she's a bitch.

1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:51.940
 You know, versus like, how am I,

1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.860
 that was supposed to get a good response?

1:42:53.860 --> 1:42:57.420
 What about that was going to elicit a favorable response?

1:42:57.420 --> 1:43:01.060
 You know, versus being anything, anything other than just,

1:43:01.060 --> 1:43:02.200
 you know, man, what's going on?

1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:03.980
 And I guess that, does that make any sense?

1:43:03.980 --> 1:43:04.820
 It makes total sense.

1:43:04.820 --> 1:43:06.740
 And that Southern thing that you're referring to,

1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:08.660
 I feel like that's an important,

1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:12.840
 that's an important part of human communication.

1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:14.020
 Let me ask you this.

1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:14.860
 Sure.

1:43:14.860 --> 1:43:16.980
 You're a new back attacks instructional.

1:43:16.980 --> 1:43:19.220
 First of all, awesome.

1:43:19.220 --> 1:43:20.660
 Yeah.

1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:25.260
 Second of all, you drop a lot of fascinating insights

1:43:25.260 --> 1:43:28.700
 in there, but you quote Galileo out of all people

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:31.220
 in saying that you can't teach a man anything.

1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:34.320
 You can only help him find it within himself.

1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.320
 So we talked about how to start in Jiu Jitsu.

1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:41.740
 What about if we zoom out even more

1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:46.580
 and how do you learn how to learn?

1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:49.560
 How do you optimize the learning process?

1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:51.600
 I don't know the answer to that,

1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:52.760
 but I can tell you what I'd like to do.

1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:54.800
 And I would say like, I can't step one.

1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:57.180
 I don't, I'm not, maybe this is a little bit easier for me

1:43:57.180 --> 1:43:59.820
 cause you know, I've never had a ton of friends, honestly.

1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:01.140
 I've, you know, I've got my close friends

1:44:01.140 --> 1:44:01.960
 and people that I know,

1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:04.120
 but I've never had tons and tons of people.

1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.180
 So I spent a lot of time, you know, thinking.

1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:10.580
 And anyway, I can't, I can't control you.

1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:12.100
 I can't control anybody else.

1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:17.100
 I, you know, I, all I can,

1:44:17.460 --> 1:44:19.980
 I want to take my, it's a Marcus Aurelius thing.

1:44:19.980 --> 1:44:21.380
 It's like, you know, I guess the trick to life

1:44:21.380 --> 1:44:23.500
 is figuring out what's in our control and what's not

1:44:23.500 --> 1:44:25.900
 and focusing on things that are in our control, I guess.

1:44:25.900 --> 1:44:29.820
 And so step one is figuring out both internally

1:44:29.820 --> 1:44:33.140
 and then also out in the world as it pertains to Jiu Jitsu,

1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:35.640
 what is actually in my control and what is not.

1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:37.700
 Like passing someone's guard is not in your control.

1:44:37.700 --> 1:44:39.240
 People think it is, it ain't.

1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:43.440
 If I can't just do an activity and be unchecked,

1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:46.680
 then it ain't in my control entirely.

1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:47.900
 I can always breathe.

1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:51.600
 I can always, you know, be calm.

1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.200
 I can always, no matter whether I'm concerned

1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:56.300
 or not concerned, have whatever you want to call it,

1:44:56.300 --> 1:44:59.280
 nerves, you know, I can step forward across the line

1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:01.520
 and say, I will, I will face the challenge ahead.

1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:03.740
 That is all entirely, no one can stop me from doing that.

1:45:03.740 --> 1:45:04.780
 That's entirely in my control.

1:45:04.780 --> 1:45:06.840
 And that's why I know that every single time

1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:07.820
 that I walk into the ring,

1:45:07.820 --> 1:45:09.700
 I'll walk in and out of there with my head held high

1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:13.360
 because there's, I will fight with everything that I have.

1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.060
 I can't promise that I'll win.

1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:17.820
 I would say I take that same first principles.

1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:19.700
 You mentioned last time we talked, you know,

1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:23.060
 with Elon and the importance of that and going,

1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:24.580
 what are the first principles?

1:45:24.580 --> 1:45:26.700
 And I guess to come back a lot of times, in my opinion,

1:45:26.700 --> 1:45:28.340
 the things that people think are the basics

1:45:28.340 --> 1:45:30.260
 are not the basics.

1:45:30.260 --> 1:45:31.460
 You can't learn.

1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:33.340
 If you think you're reasoning for first principles,

1:45:33.340 --> 1:45:35.180
 but you're actually like level six,

1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:37.220
 you're actually like layers up,

1:45:37.220 --> 1:45:38.420
 you're making so many,

1:45:38.420 --> 1:45:40.740
 there's so many baked in assumptions to what's going on

1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:42.260
 that you're gonna struggle to understand

1:45:42.260 --> 1:45:44.300
 why anything is actually happening,

1:45:44.300 --> 1:45:46.260
 internally, externally, you name it.

1:45:46.260 --> 1:45:48.780
 So I guess what I would start when it comes to learning

1:45:48.780 --> 1:45:50.540
 is first principles and trying to understand

1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:53.420
 what's going on, but then also simple things first.

1:45:53.420 --> 1:45:54.780
 I can control my posture.

1:45:56.220 --> 1:45:57.620
 I can control my breathing.

1:45:58.580 --> 1:45:59.900
 No one can stop me from doing that.

1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:01.780
 I can control where I place my frames.

1:46:01.780 --> 1:46:03.580
 I can control where I place my limbs.

1:46:03.580 --> 1:46:05.500
 I can move my feet.

1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:07.180
 I can develop the ability to do these things

1:46:07.180 --> 1:46:08.020
 better, of course.

1:46:08.020 --> 1:46:09.540
 And I do that through practice, through drilling,

1:46:09.540 --> 1:46:10.500
 through watching people.

1:46:10.500 --> 1:46:12.740
 I've been incredibly fortunate in my time in martial arts

1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:14.260
 to train with many of my heroes,

1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:16.300
 to train with many of the people that I looked at.

1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:18.500
 And I was like, that guy is amazing.

1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:21.380
 I wanna train with this person, like Stephen Thompson,

1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:23.780
 Kenny Florian, George St. Pierre, Raymond Daniels,

1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:26.420
 Farah Zahabi, you know, I mean, like Bruno Frazada,

1:46:26.420 --> 1:46:28.860
 Marcelo Garcia, you know, all of these guys

1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:30.660
 that are just unbelievable.

1:46:30.660 --> 1:46:33.940
 And I go, well, they're moving in a way that's different.

1:46:33.940 --> 1:46:34.860
 Well, how do I do that?

1:46:34.860 --> 1:46:36.140
 Well, sometimes you can ask them

1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:37.180
 and they can tell you directly.

1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:39.620
 Other times, people, part of the genius of what they do

1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:41.060
 is that it's intuitive.

1:46:41.060 --> 1:46:42.980
 And maybe they don't think and understand

1:46:42.980 --> 1:46:44.540
 and see the world the same way that I do.

1:46:44.540 --> 1:46:47.020
 That was something that I experienced with Marcelo.

1:46:47.020 --> 1:46:48.020
 He's amazing.

1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.260
 But in a different way than his,

1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:54.180
 it just, we see things fundamentally different.

1:46:54.180 --> 1:46:55.380
 We experience the world differently.

1:46:55.380 --> 1:46:56.820
 It seems to me that we do.

1:46:56.820 --> 1:46:59.820
 And again, that taught me a really important lesson

1:46:59.820 --> 1:47:01.220
 because I was wanting, when I trained there,

1:47:01.220 --> 1:47:03.220
 to have someone go, hey, Ryan, do this, this, this,

1:47:03.220 --> 1:47:04.540
 and this, and that's how it works.

1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:06.380
 And I'm like, all right, because that's how I understood

1:47:06.380 --> 1:47:08.860
 martial arts at the time.

1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:13.500
 I wasn't ready to have someone tell me, like, hey,

1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:16.540
 it feels a little bit like this, and I just kind of do it,

1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:19.180
 which is kind of what Marcelo would do at the time.

1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:20.860
 He was less experienced as a teacher,

1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:22.980
 but that is what he was doing.

1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:26.300
 I was completely, I couldn't separate in my mind

1:47:26.300 --> 1:47:28.820
 performance and understanding.

1:47:28.820 --> 1:47:30.300
 I thought that if I understand, I could do it.

1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:32.420
 And I would also struggle sometimes

1:47:32.420 --> 1:47:35.420
 to wonder why I couldn't execute things

1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:37.260
 that I thought I understood,

1:47:37.260 --> 1:47:40.220
 and why guys like Marcelo were just so elemental.

1:47:40.220 --> 1:47:42.260
 I mean, in like the, like lightning, wind,

1:47:42.260 --> 1:47:44.620
 like that type of thing where like, it's just so in touch

1:47:44.620 --> 1:47:47.660
 with what they wanted, with their capabilities.

1:47:47.660 --> 1:47:49.660
 They could summon their powers at will.

1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:52.260
 I couldn't always do that.

1:47:52.260 --> 1:47:56.500
 And I guess, so recognizing that there was more than one way

1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:58.740
 to the top of the mountain, and also I had a lot of science,

1:47:58.740 --> 1:48:00.660
 but I didn't have a lot of art, or I had some science,

1:48:00.660 --> 1:48:02.500
 I should say, but I didn't have a lot of art.

1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:04.260
 Meeting people like Marcelo taught me,

1:48:04.260 --> 1:48:06.540
 and then Josh Waitzkin, actually brilliant guy,

1:48:06.540 --> 1:48:08.380
 chess champion, former owner,

1:48:08.380 --> 1:48:10.620
 maybe owner of Marcelo's Academy, really great friend.

1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:11.820
 I think he has a book on learning.

1:48:11.820 --> 1:48:13.900
 He does, yeah, The Art of Learning, actually.

1:48:13.900 --> 1:48:15.620
 But yeah, he knows a thing or two about it,

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:16.460
 but a great guy.

1:48:16.460 --> 1:48:18.140
 And anyway, he sat me down one time,

1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:19.940
 and was like, look, man, you're doing this wrong.

1:48:19.940 --> 1:48:22.300
 You're missing what the, missing the genius,

1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:24.540
 the brilliance that's right in front of you.

1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:26.860
 And it took me a long time.

1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.140
 What did he mean exactly?

1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:31.460
 I was frustrated with my inability

1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:32.700
 to grasp certain things,

1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:34.900
 and sometimes the teaching style being different.

1:48:34.900 --> 1:48:38.700
 Not wrong, just it was, it was tough on me at times.

1:48:38.700 --> 1:48:41.060
 So you were trying to replicate what Marcelo was saying

1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:44.940
 as opposed to understanding the fundamentals

1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:46.100
 from which it was coming.

1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:47.780
 Right, I couldn't see, I couldn't see

1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:48.860
 where it was coming from.

1:48:48.860 --> 1:48:50.340
 And also, sometimes I'm like, well,

1:48:50.340 --> 1:48:51.620
 why can't you explain it in the way

1:48:51.620 --> 1:48:53.020
 that I would want you to explain it?

1:48:53.020 --> 1:48:54.580
 And he's like, well, why can't I meet him

1:48:54.580 --> 1:48:55.900
 where he's coming from?

1:48:55.900 --> 1:48:58.340
 So anyway, it was a really important time,

1:48:58.340 --> 1:48:59.900
 unless I'm very, very frustrating if I'm honest,

1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:03.420
 but it's not, I'm so thankful for that time.

1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:06.100
 And anyway, you know, I guess.

1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:07.220
 So always first principles,

1:49:07.220 --> 1:49:08.780
 trying to understand the basics,

1:49:08.780 --> 1:49:11.900
 first starting at the place where you can control things,

1:49:11.900 --> 1:49:15.060
 the very basic elements of what you can work with.

1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:19.020
 And then when there's other mentors and teachers to.

1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:20.100
 Meet them where they're coming from.

1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:20.940
 Meet them where they're coming from.

1:49:20.940 --> 1:49:21.780
 To the extent that I can.

1:49:21.780 --> 1:49:23.300
 Rather than, I'm not, like, again, it's like,

1:49:23.300 --> 1:49:24.820
 why are you not talking to me

1:49:24.820 --> 1:49:26.740
 the way I want you to talk to me?

1:49:26.740 --> 1:49:28.420
 As opposed to, hey, where are you coming from?

1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:29.660
 Back to your point.

1:49:29.660 --> 1:49:32.220
 But I know that's not entirely specific,

1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:34.540
 but you know, like, if you can focus on that

1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:37.180
 and back to the whole, you can't teach a man anything.

1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:38.980
 Marcelo didn't teach me anything,

1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:41.140
 but he taught me in so doing, like,

1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:45.100
 and other people like that, to find it within.

1:49:45.100 --> 1:49:46.660
 And it's like, yeah, I guess something else

1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:49.860
 that I've heard before is that all learning is self discovery,

1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:52.220
 but all performance is self expression.

1:49:52.220 --> 1:49:54.900
 And I always thought that Marcelo was a brilliant master

1:49:54.900 --> 1:49:56.180
 of letting what's inside out.

1:49:56.180 --> 1:49:59.100
 He was so consistent in his performances.

1:49:59.100 --> 1:50:01.580
 And a lot of times I felt like there was a block there

1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:03.180
 personally, particularly at the end of Jiu Jitsu

1:50:03.180 --> 1:50:04.900
 when I was very, very results oriented.

1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:08.340
 And I wasn't, I think my focus was not ideal.

1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:09.700
 It was definitely not in the place

1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:10.980
 that I would like it to be.

1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:12.980
 And whether it would have won more or lost more,

1:50:12.980 --> 1:50:14.540
 hard to say, but I know that I would have performed better

1:50:14.540 --> 1:50:15.540
 if I'd have adjusted that.

1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:19.420
 And anyway, that recognizing that, again, Jiu Jitsu,

1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:21.300
 I think I've said it before, Jiu Jitsu studies is a science,

1:50:21.300 --> 1:50:22.940
 but expressed as an art.

1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:24.580
 It doesn't matter if you can articulate

1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:25.460
 what you know how to do.

1:50:25.460 --> 1:50:27.420
 What matters is if you can do what you know how to do.

1:50:27.420 --> 1:50:28.420
 It only matters if you're, you know,

1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:30.260
 I guess if you're teaching in a verbal fashion

1:50:30.260 --> 1:50:31.340
 is whether or not you can articulate it,

1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:35.140
 but recognizing the difference between learning

1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:37.540
 on an intellectual level or conceptual level

1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:40.420
 and being able to translate that into the physical.

1:50:40.420 --> 1:50:41.700
 And I guess like that's been the thing

1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:44.260
 that I feel like fortunate over time in my own academy

1:50:44.260 --> 1:50:46.420
 to be able to kind of fiddle around and learn on my own

1:50:46.420 --> 1:50:47.580
 and practice with my students.

1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:49.260
 And, you know, sometimes I struggle

1:50:49.260 --> 1:50:50.540
 to have great training partners.

1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:51.380
 Like when I say great training partner,

1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:53.860
 I mean, other world class people to spar, to roll with,

1:50:53.860 --> 1:50:56.180
 but I've gotten a lot more, honestly,

1:50:56.180 --> 1:50:57.020
 than I ever would have thought

1:50:57.020 --> 1:50:59.740
 out of being able to practice and learn and fail and try

1:50:59.740 --> 1:51:02.620
 and succeed on my own without like my own little sandbox,

1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:06.420
 figuring out how I can take an idea

1:51:06.420 --> 1:51:10.260
 and then come up with drills and drills to practice it

1:51:10.260 --> 1:51:12.340
 so that I can actually practice putting it into play.

1:51:12.340 --> 1:51:15.540
 Because again, knowing an idea and then not drilling,

1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:16.380
 what's the point?

1:51:16.380 --> 1:51:17.220
 I'll never have it.

1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:19.060
 It'll never see the light of day.

1:51:19.060 --> 1:51:22.780
 So in that DVD, in that instruction DVD, sorry.

1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:25.020
 It's an online instructional DVD.

1:51:25.020 --> 1:51:26.020
 I keep saying DVD though.

1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:27.580
 Nobody has DVDs anymore.

1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:28.500
 Do they not? It's like VHS.

1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:29.740
 I don't know.

1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:30.580
 Who has DVDs?

1:51:30.580 --> 1:51:31.620
 What, like Blu Ray?

1:51:31.620 --> 1:51:33.220
 I possess some DVDs.

1:51:33.220 --> 1:51:34.420
 I mean, like I've never watched them.

1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:35.580
 What do you use them for?

1:51:35.580 --> 1:51:40.580
 Like a cup, like a thing you put a drink on?

1:51:41.100 --> 1:51:42.580
 I mean, in a pinch, yeah.

1:51:46.980 --> 1:51:48.980
 What's that even called?

1:51:48.980 --> 1:51:49.820
 Coaster?

1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:52.780
 Yeah, my matrix coaster.

1:51:52.780 --> 1:51:55.660
 The matrix coaster, zeros and ones.

1:51:55.660 --> 1:52:00.300
 Okay, so in that instruction that people should get,

1:52:00.300 --> 1:52:01.180
 I've been watching.

1:52:01.180 --> 1:52:02.140
 I'm really enjoying.

1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:06.500
 It's, I don't even know when it came out recently, right?

1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:07.620
 Like December or something like that?

1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:10.180
 Yeah, it's part one.

1:52:10.180 --> 1:52:12.380
 It was actually like ended up being like 18 hours long

1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:14.100
 and I was like, oh my God, we gotta chop it in half.

1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:16.260
 And when it comes together, the whole thing,

1:52:16.260 --> 1:52:17.300
 I think I hope people will like it.

1:52:17.300 --> 1:52:20.340
 Yeah, well it's even part one is really good.

1:52:20.340 --> 1:52:22.540
 Yeah, people on Reddit were really excited

1:52:22.540 --> 1:52:23.540
 for part two as well.

1:52:23.540 --> 1:52:24.380
 Really?

1:52:24.380 --> 1:52:25.820
 And you also have a back.

1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:26.660
 Oh, the old one.

1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:29.420
 The old one that I, that was really helpful to me

1:52:29.420 --> 1:52:32.700
 to understand some very basic aspects of control

1:52:32.700 --> 1:52:33.540
 for the back.

1:52:33.540 --> 1:52:34.380
 Really?

1:52:34.380 --> 1:52:37.380
 Yeah, that was, you know, that clicked with me.

1:52:37.380 --> 1:52:39.140
 There's very few instructionals.

1:52:39.140 --> 1:52:41.900
 There's very few things I've watched

1:52:41.900 --> 1:52:45.260
 that ever clicked with me and that was definitely it.

1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:48.380
 It taught me one thing, I don't know,

1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:51.740
 it's you drop a lot of sort of bombs,

1:52:51.740 --> 1:52:54.780
 you drop a lot of really interesting details

1:52:54.780 --> 1:52:59.260
 and it's funny that there's only specific things

1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:00.740
 that really click.

1:53:00.740 --> 1:53:03.340
 Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in

1:53:03.340 --> 1:53:05.500
 and it's like, oh, that's interesting, okay, yeah,

1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:07.140
 but there's certain things that really click.

1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:11.180
 And I remember when that first instruction

1:53:11.180 --> 1:53:14.340
 will click with me is like the importance.

1:53:14.340 --> 1:53:17.580
 I don't remember any more like how you communicated it

1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:20.220
 because I've now integrated, it's now mine,

1:53:20.220 --> 1:53:21.820
 you know what I mean?

1:53:21.820 --> 1:53:26.020
 But it was more about you just describing upper body control

1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:29.540
 and the importance of the upper body control from the back.

1:53:29.540 --> 1:53:31.500
 And just like the, there's certain grip,

1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:35.300
 like you did describe different details on the grips

1:53:35.300 --> 1:53:38.060
 and so on and as I started trying it,

1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:42.620
 I realized how important upper body control is

1:53:42.620 --> 1:53:46.140
 versus like me maybe as a blue belt or something

1:53:46.140 --> 1:53:49.180
 was I thought like you have achieved victory

1:53:49.180 --> 1:53:51.420
 when you got the two hooks in.

1:53:51.420 --> 1:53:53.580
 And then I realized like at least for me

1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:56.740
 that the hooks were not even for my body type,

1:53:56.740 --> 1:53:59.300
 for my style, for the way I approach things,

1:53:59.300 --> 1:54:01.020
 they were not even important at all.

1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:02.740
 It's supplemental for the most part, yeah.

1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.340
 So they were there for the points

1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:07.180
 but I can establish a huge amount of control.

1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:11.900
 In fact, the hooks were, you were talking about

1:54:11.900 --> 1:54:16.260
 like illusion of choice, it almost made people panic

1:54:16.260 --> 1:54:18.740
 a lot more when you were like fighting for it

1:54:18.740 --> 1:54:20.140
 or establishing that kind of control.

1:54:20.140 --> 1:54:23.020
 They were a lot less panicked when the hooks weren't

1:54:23.020 --> 1:54:25.980
 involved even though they should be a lot more panicked.

1:54:25.980 --> 1:54:28.820
 Anyway, I realized a lot of those kinds of things,

1:54:28.820 --> 1:54:31.860
 especially that had to do with judo because so much

1:54:31.860 --> 1:54:35.780
 of judo on the ground is centered around aggressive,

1:54:35.780 --> 1:54:39.180
 efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds

1:54:39.180 --> 1:54:41.260
 of clock chokes and all that kind of stuff.

1:54:41.260 --> 1:54:43.060
 What a brilliant thing that is only gonna start

1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:44.580
 to make its way into jiu jitsu coming up

1:54:44.580 --> 1:54:47.100
 but like the judo style approach to like clock choking,

1:54:47.100 --> 1:54:49.540
 triangling from the top of the turtle and stuff,

1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:50.500
 so powerful.

1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:54.260
 Yeah, and there's something about judo that emphasizes

1:54:54.260 --> 1:54:57.420
 obviously due to the rules, the urgency.

1:54:57.420 --> 1:55:00.260
 So you only do techniques that go fast.

1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:03.940
 And then the other thing is, which I guess

1:55:03.940 --> 1:55:06.820
 jiu jitsu emphasizes too but judo really does,

1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:10.220
 which is the transition.

1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:12.260
 So like while the person's flying in the air

1:55:12.260 --> 1:55:14.060
 is the easiest time.

1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:15.940
 I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit,

1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:20.860
 which is like, why not put in your submissions

1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:23.900
 or positional control while they're in the air?

1:55:23.900 --> 1:55:26.020
 If you could, why would you not, right?

1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:27.420
 It's like, oh, well, I don't throw well.

1:55:27.420 --> 1:55:29.660
 We'll learn how to throw and then do it.

1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:32.580
 And so you should think, I mean, in the transition,

1:55:32.580 --> 1:55:35.180
 when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff.

1:55:35.180 --> 1:55:37.900
 And that's when you think about chokes,

1:55:37.900 --> 1:55:40.740
 as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke

1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:42.940
 and then everything becomes a lot easier.

1:55:42.940 --> 1:55:44.220
 You ever see Flabio Canto?

1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:48.700
 Man, Brazilian judoka is just so cool.

1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:49.660
 Like with stuff like that.

1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:52.020
 Yeah, exactly, but that has to do

1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:54.860
 with the first starting principle of like,

1:55:54.860 --> 1:55:57.380
 stop thinking this as a two phase game

1:55:57.380 --> 1:56:00.180
 of standing and then ground.

1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:03.740
 Start thinking about like the standing and the,

1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:05.680
 the standing comes before and the ground comes after,

1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:07.700
 but everything happens in a transition.

1:56:07.700 --> 1:56:09.660
 Well, unless you're attacking, what is the art of war?

1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:10.940
 Like, we all like, everyone's like,

1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:12.460
 oh yeah, the art of war, oh yes, yes, yes.

1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:14.020
 And then they immediately throw it away

1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:16.300
 and then fight like a fricking barbarian.

1:56:16.300 --> 1:56:18.540
 But, I mean like, I'm serious,

1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:22.300
 but how many people quote stuff and then like,

1:56:22.300 --> 1:56:23.820
 it's like the, what is it, the family guy joke

1:56:23.820 --> 1:56:26.100
 where they're like, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in,

1:56:26.100 --> 1:56:27.100
 he's like, you're not listening to my work,

1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:27.980
 what are you talking about?

1:56:27.980 --> 1:56:32.980
 And anyway, basically, like the art of war,

1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:34.700
 one of the things that's like the only thing

1:56:34.700 --> 1:56:37.060
 that you can be sure of being successful in attacking

1:56:37.060 --> 1:56:39.020
 is something that's undefended.

1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:39.860
 We're like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:56:39.860 --> 1:56:42.480
 But you know, in a fight though, they're defended.

1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:44.260
 Well, are they?

1:56:44.260 --> 1:56:45.620
 There's moments all the time

1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:47.240
 where I'm borderline defenseless.

1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:49.560
 And if you were to attack at that moment,

1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:51.660
 if you could see it and then seize the moment,

1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:53.280
 if you were capable of both,

1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:54.980
 you should not only expect to be successful,

1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:56.260
 you should be damn sure you're gonna be successful.

1:56:56.260 --> 1:56:58.020
 And more important than that, you'll be successful.

1:56:58.020 --> 1:57:00.140
 And even if somehow not, you won't be countered.

1:57:00.140 --> 1:57:02.740
 And I guess like, that's the trick

1:57:02.740 --> 1:57:05.940
 of almost all like conflict, right?

1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:09.100
 It's like showing up when the other person's taking a nap.

1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:11.780
 And then it's so funny, like we take like a protracted war.

1:57:11.780 --> 1:57:13.220
 It's like, oh, it takes five years.

1:57:13.220 --> 1:57:15.620
 And there's lulls and there's a battle this month,

1:57:15.620 --> 1:57:17.080
 but then there's a couple of weeks, another battle.

1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:18.600
 It's like, well, if you just shrink that down,

1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.700
 it's the microcosm, macrocosm idea.

1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:22.700
 That same thing, that whole war is taking place

1:57:22.700 --> 1:57:24.820
 in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:27.680
 And there's moments of lulls of person effectively

1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:30.580
 going for a snack, being like in a horror movie,

1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:33.000
 like, hey guys, I'm gonna go get a beer from around the way.

1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.180
 Like I'm dead for sure.

1:57:34.180 --> 1:57:35.700
 So anyway.

1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:38.820
 Is there, on this particular instructional,

1:57:38.820 --> 1:57:40.620
 if you can convert it to words,

1:57:41.620 --> 1:57:43.820
 you talk about finishing the submission.

1:57:43.820 --> 1:57:47.080
 Is there some interesting insights

1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.100
 that you find beautiful or profound

1:57:49.100 --> 1:57:51.780
 about finishing the rear neck and choke

1:57:51.780 --> 1:57:54.340
 or just finishing the submissions for the back control?

1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:56.160
 Is there something like, you know,

1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:58.400
 you talk about the squeeze and the crush

1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:00.100
 and all these kinds of principles.

1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:03.380
 Is there something about control

1:58:03.380 --> 1:58:05.780
 about the process of finishing

1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:09.420
 that you find especially profound about this position?

1:58:09.420 --> 1:58:10.240
 Absolutely.

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:11.860
 The opposite of one profound truth

1:58:11.860 --> 1:58:13.460
 can be another profound truth.

1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:17.780
 So like, it's, I do a.

1:58:17.780 --> 1:58:18.600
 Did Jesus say that?

1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:21.520
 No, I don't, I actually was a guy on Tumblr.

1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:24.300
 But yeah, it was really, really cool.

1:58:24.300 --> 1:58:26.320
 There was like a tree in the background.

1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:30.060
 But anyway, but so let's say like,

1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:31.220
 I'll use examples.

1:58:31.220 --> 1:58:35.080
 Like first off, I saw someone finishing a 50, 50 heel hook

1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:36.980
 in the UFC one promo.

1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:39.180
 It was like some chubby dude in karate,

1:58:39.180 --> 1:58:41.060
 like inside heel hook and another dude.

1:58:41.060 --> 1:58:43.860
 And you go, huh?

1:58:43.860 --> 1:58:45.740
 Well, I didn't know they were doing that back then at least.

1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:46.740
 And whether they were doing it all,

1:58:46.740 --> 1:58:50.340
 how many times did someone do something and then that works?

1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:51.660
 And then we go, okay, cool.

1:58:51.660 --> 1:58:53.480
 Versus, hey, maybe we should do that all the time.

1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:55.340
 So anyway, how long were we all taught

1:58:55.340 --> 1:58:58.260
 to do the seatbelt the way we all do the seatbelt in jiu jitsu?

1:58:58.260 --> 1:58:59.380
 Like long time, why?

1:58:59.380 --> 1:59:00.200
 Works.

1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:01.980
 In fact, it works so well.

1:59:02.860 --> 1:59:05.020
 And it was so, it was then the people who used it

1:59:05.020 --> 1:59:08.860
 were so prolific that we went, well, solve that one.

1:59:08.860 --> 1:59:10.100
 Good to go.

1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:11.900
 All right, no more thinking.

1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:14.140
 And then you go, imagine you were to like the Merkel,

1:59:14.140 --> 1:59:16.200
 the Merkel flip, all those positions that were showing

1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:17.820
 in the DVD, which is pretty much,

1:59:17.820 --> 1:59:21.740
 or whatever the heck it is, the digital VD.

1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:24.500
 No, not VD, don't want that.

1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:26.220
 Digital video something.

1:59:26.220 --> 1:59:31.160
 But basically recognizing that doing it on the wrong side

1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:32.980
 is at least as effective.

1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:34.920
 Doesn't mean that the other side wasn't good.

1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:36.660
 There could be something that's the literal

1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:38.460
 borderline opposite of that.

1:59:38.460 --> 1:59:42.660
 And you go, huh, well, that's something.

1:59:42.660 --> 1:59:44.980
 Like imagine like, I would say almost all of these things,

1:59:44.980 --> 1:59:46.480
 all the tactics and all the strategies.

1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:48.220
 So I guess that was something that we came to

1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:51.140
 like training in the gym like a year ago, maybe,

1:59:51.140 --> 1:59:51.980
 and then playing with sense.

1:59:51.980 --> 1:59:52.800
 And it's just, it's huge.

1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:54.060
 I'm like, oh wait, so let me get this straight.

1:59:54.060 --> 1:59:55.740
 First off, I can use my strong side seatbelt,

1:59:55.740 --> 1:59:58.340
 my right arm over the shoulder all the time.

1:59:58.340 --> 1:59:59.440
 Well, that's really helpful

1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:00.700
 because that's a lot better than my left.

2:00:00.700 --> 2:00:01.580
 I can do both sides of my left,

2:00:01.580 --> 2:00:03.900
 but if I had to bet my life on being able to finish it,

2:00:03.900 --> 2:00:05.820
 I would want my right arm over.

2:00:05.820 --> 2:00:07.740
 Everything that's a tactic or a strategy

2:00:07.740 --> 2:00:08.680
 evolved from an idea.

2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:10.740
 Like capitalism's an idea.

2:00:10.740 --> 2:00:12.500
 Anarchy is an idea, and then it becomes,

2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:13.420
 well, what does that all mean?

2:00:13.420 --> 2:00:14.540
 What are the consequences?

2:00:14.540 --> 2:00:16.060
 What's the fallout of all this, right?

2:00:16.060 --> 2:00:19.140
 So what if we start with jujitsu,

2:00:19.140 --> 2:00:20.260
 the idea of the guard, right?

2:00:20.260 --> 2:00:22.420
 And we go, well, I mean, why do you use the guard?

2:00:22.420 --> 2:00:25.540
 No other martial art really has developed the guard

2:00:25.540 --> 2:00:26.860
 in the same way that jujitsu has.

2:00:26.860 --> 2:00:27.740
 Well, what is the guard?

2:00:27.740 --> 2:00:29.700
 A guard's a defensive idea where you're kind of

2:00:29.700 --> 2:00:31.940
 on your back to some extent or another,

2:00:31.940 --> 2:00:33.780
 and you're using your legs as a wall between you

2:00:33.780 --> 2:00:36.300
 and the other person, and the other guy represents danger.

2:00:36.300 --> 2:00:38.260
 And you're like, yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.

2:00:38.260 --> 2:00:39.420
 Is it?

2:00:39.420 --> 2:00:41.580
 I mean, it clearly works, at least to a certain extent,

2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:44.980
 but where do I want to put my legs when I want to get up?

2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:45.820
 Not on the other dude.

2:00:45.820 --> 2:00:47.580
 I'm trying to put them on things on the floor.

2:00:47.580 --> 2:00:49.660
 If I want to generate a ton of power,

2:00:49.660 --> 2:00:51.100
 what's the first thing I do with my feet?

2:00:51.100 --> 2:00:52.380
 I anchor them to the floor.

2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:53.740
 Drive for a punch, you name it.

2:00:53.740 --> 2:00:56.300
 Move away, jump, dart, you name it.

2:00:56.300 --> 2:00:58.660
 So does it mean that that's a terrible idea

2:00:58.660 --> 2:00:59.500
 to be on your back?

2:00:59.500 --> 2:01:00.780
 No, clearly it works.

2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:03.300
 And clearly it has function.

2:01:03.300 --> 2:01:04.940
 But what if the function that we're giving it

2:01:04.940 --> 2:01:08.300
 and how much focus we're assigning to it

2:01:08.300 --> 2:01:11.260
 is disproportionate to its effectiveness?

2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:13.180
 Maybe, what if it's not a good idea?

2:01:13.180 --> 2:01:15.060
 I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but what if it wasn't?

2:01:15.060 --> 2:01:16.940
 That's a foundational idea of jujitsu.

2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:20.260
 And then how much, because no one questions that foundation,

2:01:20.260 --> 2:01:22.980
 how much innovation is built on top of the idea?

2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.300
 Well, of course I want to be,

2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.940
 my being on my back is in okay position.

2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:27.300
 So now they're innovating,

2:01:27.300 --> 2:01:29.180
 but they're innovating within a closed system

2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:32.380
 that they think they're innovating in this open space

2:01:32.380 --> 2:01:33.540
 of, oh my God, it can be anything,

2:01:33.540 --> 2:01:36.380
 when in reality it can be anything within this little set.

2:01:36.380 --> 2:01:37.820
 But you don't realize that you're in a set.

2:01:37.820 --> 2:01:39.420
 You don't realize that you're in a box.

2:01:39.420 --> 2:01:40.860
 There would be answers that would become

2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:42.620
 so immediately apparent to you

2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:44.740
 if you were willing to look outside of that,

2:01:44.740 --> 2:01:47.260
 but you'll literally never even look over to your left

2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:49.900
 because you don't even realize the left exists.

2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:52.340
 Do you think there's a lot of places in jujitsu,

2:01:52.340 --> 2:01:54.460
 whether it's back control or generally guards

2:01:54.460 --> 2:01:55.940
 and all the different positions,

2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:58.340
 where there's a lot of space,

2:01:58.340 --> 2:02:01.740
 like a lot to be discovered

2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:03.820
 by questioning the basic assumptions.

2:02:03.820 --> 2:02:06.180
 Maybe if you can give examples of like back control,

2:02:06.180 --> 2:02:08.100
 like, is there something you've discovered that's like?

2:02:08.100 --> 2:02:09.700
 Merkle versus seatbelt.

2:02:09.700 --> 2:02:10.820
 What's Merkle with seatbelt?

2:02:10.820 --> 2:02:13.140
 Seatbelt is a right arm over the shoulder,

2:02:13.140 --> 2:02:14.860
 left arm under the arm.

2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:17.600
 I'm on the same side as my choking arm.

2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:19.260
 Merkle is just, I do the same thing.

2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:20.580
 I don't even adjust my hands.

2:02:20.580 --> 2:02:22.060
 I walk myself over to the left side.

2:02:22.060 --> 2:02:23.020
 I'm on the opposite side.

2:02:23.020 --> 2:02:24.340
 It's actually a more powerful position.

2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:25.460
 Yeah, for people listening,

2:02:25.460 --> 2:02:26.820
 for people who might not know,

2:02:26.820 --> 2:02:30.260
 jujitsu is a, seatbelt is a control.

2:02:30.260 --> 2:02:32.380
 We're talking about when one person

2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:34.100
 is on the back of another person,

2:02:34.100 --> 2:02:36.540
 which is a really dominant position in jujitsu,

2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:41.180
 seatbelt is a, I guess, widely accepted way

2:02:41.180 --> 2:02:42.020
 of holding your arm.

2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:42.860
 Like best practices on those kinds of things.

2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:45.340
 Best practices, yeah, and it's worked so well.

2:02:45.340 --> 2:02:49.220
 So it's a one arm over, one arm under,

2:02:49.220 --> 2:02:50.540
 and there's a certain side

2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:53.820
 you're supposed to be on when you're on the back.

2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:56.020
 Everyone teaches, there's a choking arm,

2:02:56.020 --> 2:02:57.620
 that's the arm that's over,

2:02:57.620 --> 2:02:58.780
 and your body's supposed to be

2:02:58.780 --> 2:03:01.060
 on a certain side relative to that.

2:03:01.060 --> 2:03:03.060
 And then Ryan is describing,

2:03:03.060 --> 2:03:06.260
 questioning these basic assumptions

2:03:06.260 --> 2:03:07.740
 of which side you're supposed to be on.

2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:09.780
 And let's say that's even just like a mid level assumption.

2:03:09.780 --> 2:03:11.660
 It's not even a first principles assumption,

2:03:11.660 --> 2:03:12.700
 but it's pretty close to.

2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:14.740
 It's getting there, but let's just say,

2:03:14.740 --> 2:03:18.320
 for sake of argument, it goes a lot deeper, maybe.

2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:21.740
 I think most of the innovation that I see is not innovation.

2:03:21.740 --> 2:03:24.820
 It's like basically changing the color of a car

2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:27.260
 or polishing like the window a little bit,

2:03:27.260 --> 2:03:28.260
 where you're like, hey, you made it,

2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:29.620
 you made it a little bit different,

2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:30.900
 you made it a little bit better.

2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:32.800
 It's like, oh man, what if I did the same guard

2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:34.060
 and then grab the lapel?

2:03:34.060 --> 2:03:35.300
 I'm not saying that's bad,

2:03:35.300 --> 2:03:37.220
 but you're not fundamentally changing anything.

2:03:37.220 --> 2:03:39.140
 I think most of the big seismic shifts

2:03:39.140 --> 2:03:41.220
 that we see in almost anything come from,

2:03:41.220 --> 2:03:44.760
 hey, that thing we thought was right was wrong,

2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:48.100
 rather than not only is it right, it's even righter.

2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:49.580
 And you're like, that's not wrong, that's not bad,

2:03:49.580 --> 2:03:52.440
 but that's, it's like, oh man, let's say, for instance,

2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:53.400
 I didn't make the triangle better,

2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:54.920
 but let's say I made the triangle a little bit better

2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:56.760
 than it was, or than it was taught.

2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:00.020
 I mean, you can call it innovation.

2:04:00.020 --> 2:04:00.860
 I don't know, man.

2:04:00.860 --> 2:04:01.860
 It's not like the person that said,

2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:03.660
 hey, have you guys ever heard of a triangle before

2:04:03.660 --> 2:04:04.500
 and came up with that?

2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:06.600
 We're like, that is, you're like, that's on the list?

2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:07.680
 You can do this thing to people?

2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:08.520
 Are you kidding me?

2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:11.540
 Can you imagine you invented the straight right hand?

2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:12.580
 You'll be like one punch man.

2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:14.580
 You can walk around and just lay low

2:04:14.580 --> 2:04:16.200
 every single person you got into a fight with,

2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:18.300
 because it didn't even occur to them to hit you

2:04:18.300 --> 2:04:19.500
 with their back hand.

2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:22.240
 In a world full of jabbers, you throw your back hand.

2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:23.500
 You're gonna kill people.

2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:24.340
 So basically.

2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:26.980
 Well, but by the way, I mean, just to pause on that,

2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:29.660
 first of all, somebody did invent the triangle probably,

2:04:29.660 --> 2:04:30.500
 right?

2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:31.320
 For sure.

2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:32.160
 It's not a trivial thing once you think.

2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:33.000
 No.

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.200
 How many of these giant things that we all go like,

2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:36.500
 oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we all use that now.

2:04:36.500 --> 2:04:38.760
 Can you imagine you have triangles and heel hooks

2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:41.780
 and rear naked chokes and I don't have those?

2:04:41.780 --> 2:04:43.260
 You're on beat, you're borderline, I mean, like,

2:04:43.260 --> 2:04:45.380
 that's why, that's, we all, every single one of this,

2:04:45.380 --> 2:04:46.340
 particularly those of us, I mean,

2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:48.780
 when did you first start training, Lex?

2:04:48.780 --> 2:04:51.900
 12, 13, well, let's not count wrestling,

2:04:51.900 --> 2:04:53.740
 but 13 years ago with Jiu Jitsu.

2:04:53.740 --> 2:04:54.580
 Right on.

2:04:54.580 --> 2:04:55.940
 So let's say about that time where particularly

2:04:55.940 --> 2:04:58.140
 it was still like kind of, kind of undergroundy,

2:04:58.140 --> 2:05:00.340
 you know, and you're like, hey, we all experienced

2:05:00.340 --> 2:05:03.660
 being like a relative, like a mid level white belt

2:05:03.660 --> 2:05:06.300
 and being able to easily beat up all our friends

2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:07.700
 because everyone wrestled other buddies.

2:05:07.700 --> 2:05:09.240
 And it was one of those ones where like,

2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:11.500
 they don't have weapons to end the fight.

2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:13.860
 You have weapons to end the fight.

2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:16.700
 That's so, that's such a crazy, you know,

2:05:16.700 --> 2:05:21.700
 asymmetric advantage that if you lose, it's on you now, man.

2:05:21.900 --> 2:05:23.940
 Like, like you had the, next time it's like,

2:05:23.940 --> 2:05:26.060
 I've got this rifle and you have nothing.

2:05:26.060 --> 2:05:27.820
 And I decided to put it on my back and then run over

2:05:27.820 --> 2:05:28.660
 and try to karate chop.

2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:30.440
 You're like, okay, next time,

2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:31.940
 just make sure you use the rifle, bud.

2:05:31.940 --> 2:05:33.420
 I'm like, oh yeah, I should do that.

2:05:33.420 --> 2:05:34.260
 So.

2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:35.260
 Yeah, it's kind of fascinating to,

2:05:35.260 --> 2:05:38.020
 I mean, everything you're describing is a,

2:05:38.020 --> 2:05:40.180
 there's a fascinating tension between like,

2:05:40.180 --> 2:05:41.760
 whatever I show people for the first time,

2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:43.960
 what a triangle is, just like regular people.

2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:46.580
 It's like, they're discovering is like,

2:05:46.580 --> 2:05:47.980
 oh, okay, that's interesting.

2:05:47.980 --> 2:05:49.180
 I mean, MMA has changed that,

2:05:49.180 --> 2:05:51.580
 but people haven't watched MMA.

2:05:51.580 --> 2:05:52.740
 That's an interesting move.

2:05:52.740 --> 2:05:54.740
 It doesn't make sense why that would be a choke.

2:05:54.740 --> 2:05:59.340
 And they kind of quickly accepted that's a thing

2:05:59.340 --> 2:06:02.660
 and they accept the basics without questioning,

2:06:02.660 --> 2:06:05.460
 wait a minute, what's actually being choked?

2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:10.540
 How is it that a shoulder of a person

2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:12.640
 can do the choking?

2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:15.300
 Like, I'm not sure I fully question

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:16.780
 the fundamentals of all of that.

2:06:16.780 --> 2:06:19.780
 Like, what exactly is the blood supply

2:06:19.780 --> 2:06:21.300
 that's being cut off?

2:06:21.300 --> 2:06:24.020
 Like, what is the anatomy and the physiology

2:06:24.020 --> 2:06:24.860
 of all of that?

2:06:24.860 --> 2:06:25.680
 Why does this work?

2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:26.520
 And if you understood all that,

2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:27.340
 what else can we do here?

2:06:27.340 --> 2:06:28.680
 Yeah, what else can we do here?

2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:29.940
 That's the really important thing.

2:06:29.940 --> 2:06:31.600
 But if we know, if I'm an end user,

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:33.280
 which almost everyone is of almost anything,

2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:34.780
 I'm serious, where I'm like,

2:06:34.780 --> 2:06:35.740
 I think about stuff in my life,

2:06:35.740 --> 2:06:36.940
 the only things I really think about

2:06:36.940 --> 2:06:39.180
 are like martial arts and martial arts strategy

2:06:39.180 --> 2:06:41.220
 and like, I don't know, some other couple,

2:06:41.220 --> 2:06:42.700
 a couple other things, but not much.

2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:46.100
 And anything else in my life is borderline unexamined.

2:06:46.100 --> 2:06:47.780
 And I like to think that if I put a lot of effort

2:06:47.780 --> 2:06:49.460
 in something, I'd like to think that I could figure

2:06:49.460 --> 2:06:50.740
 at least some things out about it,

2:06:50.740 --> 2:06:53.100
 but I figured out almost nothing about anything in my life

2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.740
 because I haven't even looked.

2:06:54.740 --> 2:06:57.820
 And if you're an end user, what are you capable of

2:06:57.820 --> 2:07:00.800
 versus you can literally alter the source code.

2:07:00.800 --> 2:07:02.820
 You are Neo in the fricking matrix,

2:07:02.820 --> 2:07:04.900
 if you can alter the code and I can't.

2:07:04.900 --> 2:07:06.980
 And it's like, we think, ah, ah, ah, ah,

2:07:06.980 --> 2:07:10.700
 but imagine you are a world class anything,

2:07:10.700 --> 2:07:11.940
 or you're not even world class, forget it.

2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:13.800
 Like a purple belt compared to a white belt

2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:16.080
 or compared to a no belt might as well be John Jones

2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:18.940
 or Marcelo Garcia, you're gonna beat them up comparably bad.

2:07:18.940 --> 2:07:21.900
 So it's, that actually is a common thing

2:07:21.900 --> 2:07:23.420
 where people can't tell the difference between levels.

2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:24.260
 They're like, oh man, I've trained

2:07:24.260 --> 2:07:25.100
 with my black belt instructor,

2:07:25.100 --> 2:07:26.380
 how much better could so and so be?

2:07:26.380 --> 2:07:29.460
 Like, so much better you're gonna have a hard time

2:07:29.460 --> 2:07:30.300
 wrapping your head around it.

2:07:30.300 --> 2:07:32.820
 I remember when I first trained with Marcelo Garcia in 2007,

2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:34.380
 I was a decent purple belt.

2:07:34.380 --> 2:07:36.300
 And of course he mollywopped me very gently.

2:07:36.300 --> 2:07:39.340
 And then training with him again in 2008,

2:07:39.340 --> 2:07:40.300
 I was definitely better.

2:07:40.300 --> 2:07:42.980
 I won the gi and no gi worlds that you're a purple belt.

2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:44.220
 So definitely for the record,

2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:45.540
 I'm definitely not a jujitsu world champion.

2:07:45.540 --> 2:07:46.380
 I wanted the purple belt,

2:07:46.380 --> 2:07:48.940
 but like, that's not the same at winning a black belt

2:07:48.940 --> 2:07:50.380
 and a tough accomplishment,

2:07:50.380 --> 2:07:51.900
 but not in the same thing at all.

2:07:51.900 --> 2:07:54.940
 But anyway, I was definitely better.

2:07:54.940 --> 2:07:55.940
 He beat me up just the same.

2:07:55.940 --> 2:07:59.700
 I'm like, okay, 2009, I was a lot better.

2:07:59.700 --> 2:08:02.300
 Got a medal at ADCC that time, won the trials,

2:08:02.300 --> 2:08:04.940
 crushed everybody, like no, just submitted everybody

2:08:04.940 --> 2:08:06.700
 like bop, bop, bop, bop.

2:08:06.700 --> 2:08:09.820
 Training with Marcelo Garcia, it was worse.

2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:13.420
 And in 2010, training with Marcelo Garcia, same, same.

2:08:13.420 --> 2:08:17.180
 So the idea was, I wouldn't be able to tell you

2:08:17.180 --> 2:08:19.420
 the difference and the outcome difference

2:08:19.420 --> 2:08:20.820
 was the same in all of these rounds.

2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:22.540
 I was significantly more experienced

2:08:22.540 --> 2:08:25.500
 and more adept each time that this occurred.

2:08:25.500 --> 2:08:27.260
 But it was like, how many number of times

2:08:27.260 --> 2:08:29.020
 did this person submit you or pass your guard in the round?

2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:30.300
 I'm like, I don't know, probably like,

2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:31.500
 let's say five each one,

2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:33.020
 because it's gonna be a brief period of time.

2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:34.140
 And let's say it was three on one,

2:08:34.140 --> 2:08:35.620
 six on another, I'm like, whatever, it's comparable.

2:08:35.620 --> 2:08:37.740
 It's six one and a half dozen.

2:08:37.740 --> 2:08:40.340
 Would I be able to easily tell the difference?

2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:42.300
 No, I would just say, I know in concept

2:08:42.300 --> 2:08:44.540
 that he's way better, so much better.

2:08:44.540 --> 2:08:45.740
 But there's plenty of other people

2:08:45.740 --> 2:08:47.820
 that could have beaten me just as bad as Marcelo did

2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:49.940
 when I was a purple belt or when I was a brown belt.

2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:51.660
 Then maybe I would watch Marcelo walk through

2:08:51.660 --> 2:08:53.300
 like their borderline, not there.

2:08:53.300 --> 2:08:54.340
 So it's neat.

2:08:54.340 --> 2:08:57.020
 Like if you, that's back to kind of what I was talking about

2:08:57.020 --> 2:08:59.860
 about certain people beginning to really like peel back

2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:03.220
 some of what's really special about the martial arts

2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:06.140
 or any activity I presume is they get to a level

2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:08.700
 of understanding in depth that they're playing

2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:11.580
 with like the almost the reality of that thing.

2:09:11.580 --> 2:09:14.220
 And I'm playing by rules that are not rules.

2:09:14.220 --> 2:09:16.620
 I'm not even one of the, to use a matrix analogy,

2:09:16.620 --> 2:09:18.860
 I'm not even an agent, which is the best version

2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:21.260
 of something playing by the rules.

2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:22.780
 I'm like one of the regular people

2:09:22.780 --> 2:09:25.460
 or one of the regular people that got out of the matrix.

2:09:25.460 --> 2:09:27.180
 So I'm like, oh, I'm cool, but when I fight an agent,

2:09:27.180 --> 2:09:29.860
 I lose because we're both in the rules,

2:09:29.860 --> 2:09:32.580
 but they just play them to the bone and I'm just here.

2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.700
 Well, and then the agent encounters Neo

2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:36.100
 and they can do nothing.

2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:36.940
 You're like, why?

2:09:36.940 --> 2:09:38.940
 Because it's operating outside of what the rules are,

2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:40.140
 but not really what the rules are,

2:09:40.140 --> 2:09:42.260
 what they perceive to be the rules are clearly.

2:09:42.260 --> 2:09:43.580
 So anyway, I guess that's kind of my point

2:09:43.580 --> 2:09:45.060
 about Marcelo or certain other people

2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:46.020
 that are doing things where you go,

2:09:46.020 --> 2:09:48.300
 that doesn't even seem real.

2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:49.420
 It doesn't seem real to me

2:09:49.420 --> 2:09:51.260
 because I don't understand what's going on.

2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:53.820
 And I guess if we can get down to base assumptions,

2:09:53.820 --> 2:09:55.820
 like if we can constantly strip away, strip away,

2:09:55.820 --> 2:09:57.860
 strip away, let's say we always thought

2:09:57.860 --> 2:09:59.620
 that turning left was right, was correct.

2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:01.860
 And it turns out that turning right was correct.

2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:02.940
 Change your life.

2:10:02.940 --> 2:10:05.820
 Yeah, it's a, what is it, Socrates said,

2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:08.220
 the unexamined life is not worth living.

2:10:08.220 --> 2:10:10.740
 So you just basically have to rigorously

2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:13.460
 just constantly examine every assumption

2:10:13.460 --> 2:10:14.380
 over and over and over.

2:10:14.380 --> 2:10:15.940
 But doesn't that give your life meaning

2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:17.020
 to come back to the struggle,

2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:18.740
 to come back to free will, to come back to,

2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:20.100
 what if we could strip all that away?

2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:20.940
 All right, cool.

2:10:20.940 --> 2:10:22.740
 All right, let me just stick the needle in my arm

2:10:22.740 --> 2:10:23.580
 and that's that.

2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:27.460
 Yeah, no, I mean that constant striving

2:10:27.460 --> 2:10:32.460
 for understanding yet another lower layer

2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:34.460
 of the simulation we're living in

2:10:34.460 --> 2:10:38.340
 is something that's actually deeply fulfilling

2:10:38.340 --> 2:10:40.300
 that I don't know if it's genetically built in,

2:10:40.300 --> 2:10:43.100
 but there's something about that striving to understand

2:10:43.100 --> 2:10:45.820
 that seems to be deeply human.

2:10:45.820 --> 2:10:47.540
 Which is funny, what makes a human,

2:10:47.540 --> 2:10:49.220
 we don't talk about the soul anymore, man.

2:10:49.220 --> 2:10:50.900
 I went to Catholic school as a kid.

2:10:50.900 --> 2:10:52.780
 Whether you buy into all that stuff or not,

2:10:52.780 --> 2:10:55.420
 you're like, what about the soul of a person,

2:10:55.420 --> 2:10:58.860
 the spirit of a people, the spirit of a nation,

2:10:58.860 --> 2:11:00.820
 anywhere, the spirit of humanity?

2:11:00.820 --> 2:11:04.140
 We talk about everything like it's this quantifiable thing

2:11:04.140 --> 2:11:06.420
 when maybe certain things are, maybe everything is,

2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:07.860
 but then what happens if there's things

2:11:07.860 --> 2:11:09.900
 that just aren't quantifiable,

2:11:09.900 --> 2:11:12.180
 that nothing in our understanding can

2:11:12.180 --> 2:11:13.100
 or will ever explain it?

2:11:13.100 --> 2:11:14.420
 That doesn't mean that that should be our assumption.

2:11:14.420 --> 2:11:15.940
 It's for your assumption that we can explain everything

2:11:15.940 --> 2:11:18.380
 and let's get to the dang bottom, peel, peel, peel, peel.

2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:20.100
 But what if there is actually something

2:11:20.100 --> 2:11:24.340
 that we need challenge for?

2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:26.420
 And we could be looking in the wrong place

2:11:26.420 --> 2:11:28.100
 by going, oh, is it in the genes?

2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:28.940
 Maybe it is.

2:11:28.940 --> 2:11:29.980
 Again, I'm not saying we're looking in the wrong place

2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:31.580
 like I would know anything, I do karate.

2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:34.460
 But basically, not even well.

2:11:34.460 --> 2:11:36.860
 But yeah, we do karate, mediocre,

2:11:36.860 --> 2:11:38.460
 just ask Raymond Daniels or Stephen Thompson.

2:11:38.460 --> 2:11:41.060
 But I guess to come back, though, you just.

2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:43.100
 Are you a yellow belt yet, or are you?

2:11:43.100 --> 2:11:45.300
 Man, I actually, have you ever seen the Seinfeld episode

2:11:45.300 --> 2:11:47.260
 where Kramer fights the kids?

2:11:47.260 --> 2:11:48.980
 Yeah, I did that at Raymond Daniels school

2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:53.140
 and the kids won in class in addition to the alleyway.

2:11:53.140 --> 2:11:55.780
 Oh, they finished it off afterwards.

2:11:55.780 --> 2:11:58.060
 Yeah, exactly, when I was on my last legs.

2:11:58.060 --> 2:12:02.180
 But yeah, I would just, maybe, it's funny,

2:12:02.180 --> 2:12:04.060
 I feel like there's something deeply missing

2:12:04.060 --> 2:12:07.060
 from public understanding anymore.

2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:09.860
 It's almost like the idea that we can figure everything out,

2:12:09.860 --> 2:12:12.500
 which I deeply believe in, but also the possibility

2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:14.740
 that there's some things that we'll never really see

2:12:14.740 --> 2:12:15.860
 and some things we'll never understand.

2:12:15.860 --> 2:12:17.860
 And there's something, like you said,

2:12:17.860 --> 2:12:20.340
 uniquely human about the human experience,

2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:23.900
 that even if I had the power to change,

2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:25.340
 I don't wanna fuck with it, man.

2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:27.100
 I don't wanna change that thing.

2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:28.580
 Oh, yeah, well, wouldn't it be great

2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:31.100
 if we just immediately knew the outcome of everything

2:12:31.100 --> 2:12:32.420
 and you just press this button, you're like,

2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:34.260
 oh, that's gonna, what's the point of living life then?

2:12:34.260 --> 2:12:35.820
 Even if you could do it, it's the,

2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:37.300
 Ian, you've seen Jurassic Park, I'll leave you to be sorry,

2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:38.260
 I know what I'm talking about.

2:12:38.260 --> 2:12:40.700
 Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldblum, right?

2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:43.300
 Life finds a way.

2:12:43.300 --> 2:12:46.420
 But we were so concerned with whether or not we could,

2:12:46.420 --> 2:12:49.740
 we didn't stop to think whether or not we should.

2:12:49.740 --> 2:12:50.780
 Maybe?

2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:54.420
 I think there's, I mean, it's a deeply human thing,

2:12:54.420 --> 2:12:56.260
 but it's also a really useful thing

2:12:56.260 --> 2:12:59.860
 to always kind of assume that there's this giant thing

2:12:59.860 --> 2:13:01.620
 that you don't understand.

2:13:01.620 --> 2:13:04.460
 So you can forever be striving to understand

2:13:04.460 --> 2:13:07.980
 because that process gives you meaning,

2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:10.220
 but also keeps making you better.

2:13:10.220 --> 2:13:12.620
 Like thinking that, actually even just thinking

2:13:12.620 --> 2:13:15.220
 that you can't understand everything

2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:19.700
 will lead you to stop too early.

2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:23.060
 So like, I think there's something to,

2:13:23.060 --> 2:13:25.860
 whether it's the soul or whether it's like religious stuff,

2:13:25.860 --> 2:13:28.220
 like assuming that there's this thing

2:13:28.220 --> 2:13:30.260
 that you cannot possibly understand

2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.300
 is a really good assumption under which to operate

2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:36.060
 and under which to do this first principles kind of thinking

2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:38.060
 because you can just keep digging and keep digging,

2:13:38.060 --> 2:13:40.580
 keep digging even when it seems like you're at the bottom

2:13:40.580 --> 2:13:41.620
 because you don't fucking know

2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:42.900
 if you're at the bottom or not.

2:13:42.900 --> 2:13:46.740
 And back to one of our, I guess our other kind of tangents

2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:49.260
 was that comes back to everyone's a human being.

2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:52.420
 The smartest human being in the history of humanity

2:13:52.420 --> 2:13:57.420
 is so hilariously weak, like short lived and not intelligent.

2:13:57.740 --> 2:13:58.620
 Do it for yourself, bro.

2:13:58.620 --> 2:13:59.460
 I understand.

2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:00.980
 I didn't say, no, I'm not saying comparison to me.

2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:02.860
 In comparison to me, everyone is awesome,

2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:04.980
 but that's why I don't do the goat thing.

2:14:04.980 --> 2:14:09.380
 But basically, it's just on a cosmic level.

2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:10.660
 Can you imagine if you were a vampire,

2:14:10.660 --> 2:14:12.820
 you're like 900 years old, like how much you would seem,

2:14:12.820 --> 2:14:15.940
 you would seem like a lowercase G God to people.

2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:18.580
 You'd be like, how could you know so much?

2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:20.580
 How can you have such a long view perspective?

2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:21.900
 It would be insane.

2:14:21.900 --> 2:14:24.380
 So I mean, it seems like we're talking about AI now, right?

2:14:24.380 --> 2:14:26.580
 Where we're creating things that are infinitely smarter

2:14:26.580 --> 2:14:28.540
 than us effectively and live all this time

2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:31.400
 and it's probably gonna do what we tell it to do, right?

2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:34.380
 No, it's probably, well, I hope it keeps us around.

2:14:34.380 --> 2:14:37.260
 Do you, by the way, think about AI

2:14:37.260 --> 2:14:38.700
 and the existential threats?

2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:43.620
 Like speaking of gods, are you, is this whole

2:14:43.620 --> 2:14:45.900
 technological world, we talked about social networks

2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:49.660
 and this increasing power of technology around us,

2:14:49.660 --> 2:14:51.740
 we ourselves are becoming less human

2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:56.580
 because we keep relying on technology more and more.

2:14:56.580 --> 2:14:59.040
 So we're becoming kinds of cyborgs,

2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:03.760
 but also there's a future that's quite possible

2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:06.780
 where the technology becomes smarter

2:15:06.780 --> 2:15:09.620
 and more powerful than us humans

2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:14.380
 and starts having a life of its own

2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:16.900
 in ways that perhaps we don't imagine as human beings.

2:15:16.900 --> 2:15:20.260
 I don't just mean like two legged robots walking around

2:15:20.260 --> 2:15:22.260
 and being humans, but smarter.

2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:26.700
 I mean like an intelligent life that's beyond

2:15:30.500 --> 2:15:34.780
 and fundamentally different than our human life.

2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:39.780
 It's infinite, it's a new kind of species,

2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:43.860
 not even just a new species, we're talking about systems,

2:15:43.860 --> 2:15:47.460
 but like it lives in the space of information.

2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:50.660
 It lives in a different time scale

2:15:50.660 --> 2:15:53.820
 and a different scale of all sorts, spatial scale.

2:15:53.820 --> 2:15:57.700
 It operate, like we spoke about individuals,

2:15:57.700 --> 2:16:00.100
 it doesn't operate in the sense of a single individual,

2:16:00.100 --> 2:16:02.420
 like it's not embodied.

2:16:02.420 --> 2:16:04.740
 So it's not like a thing that walks around

2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:08.020
 and it like, it looks at stuff and it consumes the world.

2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:11.900
 It's able to do much larger scale sensing

2:16:11.900 --> 2:16:14.620
 of the environment around it, all that kind of stuff.

2:16:14.620 --> 2:16:16.260
 I can barely even try to,

2:16:16.260 --> 2:16:18.060
 I can barely even conceive of what that would be like.

2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.560
 Are you scared or are you excited?

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:23.300
 I don't define scared or excited.

2:16:23.300 --> 2:16:26.060
 I feel like I tend to define them like the same way

2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:29.540
 where I'm like, I guess I'm.

2:16:29.540 --> 2:16:32.220
 Kind of like when before karaoke, it's the same.

2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:33.980
 Well, that's actually kind of my happy place.

2:16:33.980 --> 2:16:35.700
 It's not so much everyone else's.

2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:37.980
 You know, it's a, everyone else is probably, you know,

2:16:37.980 --> 2:16:39.260
 heading for the door at that point.

2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:40.100
 But you know, it's a.

2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:43.580
 While you're doing it or leading up to the karaoke session.

2:16:43.580 --> 2:16:46.220
 Well, it depends whether or not they know it's me.

2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:48.020
 If they know it's me, that's before I start.

2:16:48.020 --> 2:16:49.560
 If they're like, who's that guy?

2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:50.860
 Then they're like halfway through the song,

2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:52.660
 they're already throwing their beer.

2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:54.820
 What categories of song or particular song

2:16:54.820 --> 2:16:57.100
 are we talking about in terms of like your happy place?

2:16:57.100 --> 2:16:58.140
 Oh man, are you kidding me?

2:16:58.140 --> 2:16:59.600
 I mean, obviously, Bohemian Rhapsody.

2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:01.300
 I mean, there's no question because, oh yeah,

2:17:01.300 --> 2:17:02.180
 because I don't have to sing it here.

2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:03.960
 It's that, it's like, remember, can I beat Khabib?

2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:04.800
 Oh yeah, of course.

2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:05.640
 Is he here?

2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:06.460
 No?

2:17:06.460 --> 2:17:07.300
 Yeah, then yeah, yeah.

2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:08.140
 All right, if he's here, is he here?

2:17:08.140 --> 2:17:08.960
 No, then I, no.

2:17:08.960 --> 2:17:12.100
 I have a torn, I have torn feelings about Bohemian Rhapsody

2:17:12.100 --> 2:17:13.900
 because I like the beginning part, the sadness.

2:17:13.900 --> 2:17:16.700
 I like the solo, the heartbreak.

2:17:16.700 --> 2:17:19.380
 But the second part, I understand it, but it's so ridiculous.

2:17:19.380 --> 2:17:20.220
 It gets ridiculous.

2:17:20.220 --> 2:17:21.060
 It's so ridiculous.

2:17:21.060 --> 2:17:21.900
 It ruins it for me.

2:17:21.900 --> 2:17:23.300
 But it's more about flexing on people.

2:17:23.300 --> 2:17:25.140
 I think if you can actually hit that,

2:17:25.140 --> 2:17:26.860
 hit that, you know, the falsetto.

2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:27.700
 Yeah.

2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:30.100
 So it's, it's not, okay.

2:17:30.100 --> 2:17:32.980
 So you appreciate not for the musical beauty

2:17:32.980 --> 2:17:35.220
 and complexity of the song, you just like to flex on people.

2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:36.100
 Cause like for all, yeah.

2:17:36.100 --> 2:17:37.980
 Like what's the purpose of, of anything

2:17:37.980 --> 2:17:39.860
 except for just to let everyone know

2:17:39.860 --> 2:17:41.220
 that you think you're cool.

2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:45.580
 And there's no better way of doing that than karaoke.

2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:47.340
 So I'm not sure why I brought up karaoke.

2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:48.220
 Captive audience.

2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:49.060
 Yeah, exactly.

2:17:49.060 --> 2:17:51.540
 Oh, about fear and excitement of artificial intelligence.

2:17:51.540 --> 2:17:53.580
 I mean, like, you know me, I don't know anything about,

2:17:53.580 --> 2:17:55.620
 I just, basically I don't,

2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:58.260
 I don't understand the implications of any of this.

2:17:58.260 --> 2:18:00.780
 I would just say that like radically altering

2:18:00.780 --> 2:18:03.220
 what it means to be human in such an unbelievably short

2:18:03.220 --> 2:18:06.120
 period of time just seems like such a crazy thing.

2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:08.140
 And also it's not like we're, I can't remember

2:18:08.140 --> 2:18:08.980
 who said this to me recently.

2:18:08.980 --> 2:18:09.800
 It might've been me.

2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:10.640
 I can't remember.

2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:13.220
 So this is definitely not my idea, but we're,

2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:17.900
 we're not even going, Hey, would you like to opt in everyone?

2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:20.340
 Everyone is being opted in, you know?

2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:21.940
 And particularly when you want to talk about

2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:24.580
 like large scale robotics or large scale AI,

2:18:24.580 --> 2:18:25.820
 like the world is changing.

2:18:25.820 --> 2:18:28.060
 People in Senegal are opting in right now

2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:28.980
 without realizing it.

2:18:28.980 --> 2:18:29.940
 It's not even like, and again,

2:18:29.940 --> 2:18:31.060
 I don't mean to pick on Senegal.

2:18:31.060 --> 2:18:32.660
 It's just whatever country comes up to mind,

2:18:32.660 --> 2:18:33.800
 but that's in the developing world.

2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:36.260
 But basically, you know,

2:18:36.260 --> 2:18:40.800
 recognizing that this huge shift is coming,

2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:42.700
 we have no idea if this is a decent idea.

2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:45.820
 And also something else I've always been considered is,

2:18:45.820 --> 2:18:49.100
 you know, you think about most of the really awful, awful,

2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:51.180
 awful things that have done in history,

2:18:51.180 --> 2:18:54.260
 large scale slavery, holly, you name it.

2:18:54.260 --> 2:18:57.500
 It didn't, people say that it came from this motivation

2:18:57.500 --> 2:18:58.340
 or that motivation.

2:18:58.340 --> 2:18:59.460
 Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.

2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:01.300
 Fundamentally, the issue, at least in my mind,

2:19:01.300 --> 2:19:04.060
 I'm not a historian, power differential.

2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:08.780
 If you and I can't contest, we don't contend.

2:19:08.780 --> 2:19:11.160
 It's not like we fight and you might win or we fight,

2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:12.700
 even you'll win comfortably.

2:19:12.700 --> 2:19:15.940
 It's you are so unbelievably powerful compared to me

2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:18.780
 that there's nothing I can do to stop you.

2:19:18.780 --> 2:19:20.300
 That seems like a recipe for something

2:19:20.300 --> 2:19:22.020
 really, really not great happening.

2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:24.780
 Because if you think about like, you know,

2:19:24.780 --> 2:19:26.540
 European countries encountering each other,

2:19:26.540 --> 2:19:27.360
 and I'm just speculating,

2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:28.200
 I don't know anything about history,

2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:31.060
 let's say countries that can contend with one another

2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:34.260
 versus countries that can't.

2:19:34.260 --> 2:19:37.220
 Let's say an alien species, an alien race shows up,

2:19:37.220 --> 2:19:38.660
 you know, right now, we don't want that.

2:19:38.660 --> 2:19:39.500
 I think Stephen Hawking said that,

2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:41.040
 and it makes perfect sense to me.

2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:41.880
 We don't want that.

2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:44.860
 If you can come here, we better hope you're nice.

2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:46.100
 Because what are we gonna do?

2:19:46.100 --> 2:19:47.900
 What are we gonna hope that you invade the water planet

2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:50.060
 like they did in, you know, what are the,

2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:51.700
 Lord of the, yeah, War of the Worlds.

2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:53.620
 So I guess what I'm trying to get across is like,

2:19:53.620 --> 2:19:56.460
 shocking levels of power differential between groups

2:19:56.460 --> 2:19:59.700
 that makes the world ripe for horrific abuse

2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:01.800
 in the event that someone decides to do it.

2:20:01.800 --> 2:20:04.540
 It's like, like you imagine an adult hitting a child,

2:20:04.540 --> 2:20:05.740
 like hitting, hitting a child,

2:20:05.740 --> 2:20:07.140
 no one in their right mind would ever go like,

2:20:07.140 --> 2:20:08.420
 oh yeah, that's a great idea.

2:20:08.420 --> 2:20:11.380
 Because it's such an, it's so grossly imbalanced.

2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:12.940
 You're like, this is wrong.

2:20:12.940 --> 2:20:14.220
 But it's also on the table

2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:16.340
 only because of the gross imbalance.

2:20:16.340 --> 2:20:18.100
 So I guess to come back, it's like,

2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:21.600
 whether we create AI and it's on some crazy level

2:20:21.600 --> 2:20:24.260
 of its own, or it's I'm in charge of it,

2:20:24.260 --> 2:20:27.580
 or I just, it seems like we're creating,

2:20:27.580 --> 2:20:31.340
 you mentioned like a game theory and nuclear war,

2:20:31.340 --> 2:20:32.860
 what prevented nuclear war?

2:20:32.860 --> 2:20:35.880
 I mean, presumably mutually assured destruction.

2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:38.540
 I mean, hopefully also humanity and the humanity

2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:40.940
 and the reasonable, you know, cooler heads prevailing

2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:43.860
 and going, hey, I can understand the veil of ignorance.

2:20:43.860 --> 2:20:46.140
 And I don't go, oh yeah, let me kill those guys

2:20:46.140 --> 2:20:48.260
 because I can't, I go, this is wrong, period.

2:20:48.260 --> 2:20:51.740
 And in concept, this is not an action I should take,

2:20:51.740 --> 2:20:54.020
 but it's also nice and easy to keep me honest

2:20:54.020 --> 2:20:56.980
 if I know that I can't get you without being got myself.

2:20:56.980 --> 2:21:00.980
 But what happens when I can get anyone anything

2:21:00.980 --> 2:21:02.540
 and I'm more or less untouchable?

2:21:02.540 --> 2:21:05.740
 Like that seems to me to be like various times

2:21:05.740 --> 2:21:07.440
 in colonial history, you know what I mean?

2:21:07.440 --> 2:21:09.540
 And what happened, we know what happened.

2:21:09.540 --> 2:21:14.540
 But so the possibility of really bad things

2:21:14.580 --> 2:21:17.220
 are plentiful, the possibilities.

2:21:17.220 --> 2:21:20.580
 But the possibilities of really positive things

2:21:20.580 --> 2:21:21.420
 are plentiful.

2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:22.380
 Like what though?

2:21:22.380 --> 2:21:23.220
 I'm not saying wrong.

2:21:23.220 --> 2:21:24.060
 I'm just telling you though.

2:21:24.060 --> 2:21:25.700
 So I can give a million examples.

2:21:25.700 --> 2:21:29.260
 One is just the examples of the parent and the child.

2:21:30.300 --> 2:21:34.600
 You said there's a power differential there

2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:39.260
 and we don't like a parent hitting their child.

2:21:39.260 --> 2:21:41.060
 What about not just hitting, like beating?

2:21:41.060 --> 2:21:43.140
 Beating, yeah, great.

2:21:43.140 --> 2:21:44.740
 Beating their child.

2:21:44.740 --> 2:21:49.120
 How often percentage wise do you see that happening?

2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:52.540
 Even though that power differential,

2:21:52.540 --> 2:21:54.980
 first of all, other people's kids,

2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:56.580
 let's just put this on the table.

2:21:56.580 --> 2:21:58.820
 I love kids, but other people's kids

2:21:58.820 --> 2:22:00.540
 can be annoying sometimes.

2:22:00.540 --> 2:22:03.860
 Sometimes you gotta deal out some justice, I get it.

2:22:03.860 --> 2:22:06.180
 But we don't practice, we don't take advantage

2:22:06.180 --> 2:22:07.740
 of that power differential.

2:22:07.740 --> 2:22:11.600
 So like there is ethics, there's moralities that emerge

2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:15.380
 that allow the power differential to be used for good

2:22:15.380 --> 2:22:16.640
 versus for bad.

2:22:16.640 --> 2:22:20.660
 So like one of the assumptions with Stephen Hawking

2:22:20.660 --> 2:22:24.860
 or with if Russia became much more powerful than America

2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:28.140
 or America much more powerful than Russia in the Cold War,

2:22:28.140 --> 2:22:31.140
 your assumption that immediately that power differential,

2:22:31.140 --> 2:22:33.140
 not your assumption, but it would express itself

2:22:33.140 --> 2:22:36.900
 would express itself in the same way

2:22:36.900 --> 2:22:38.460
 that it was trying to express itself

2:22:38.460 --> 2:22:41.500
 when there was a more level competition.

2:22:41.500 --> 2:22:44.320
 But it's also possible when the power differential grows,

2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:47.580
 the incentive, the joy, whatever the mechanisms

2:22:47.580 --> 2:22:51.820
 that made sense when it was at the same level,

2:22:51.820 --> 2:22:54.260
 the incentives become very different.

2:22:54.260 --> 2:22:56.980
 It's not as fun to destroy the ant colony.

2:22:56.980 --> 2:23:01.420
 You start becoming more the kind of a conservationalist.

2:23:01.420 --> 2:23:04.060
 One hopes, that's an evolved perspective though, yeah?

2:23:04.060 --> 2:23:06.100
 Well, I don't know if it's evolved or not,

2:23:06.100 --> 2:23:07.460
 but it's definitely a possibility.

2:23:07.460 --> 2:23:10.300
 It's unclear to me that something that's many orders

2:23:10.300 --> 2:23:14.700
 of magnitude more powerful than us will want to destroy us.

2:23:14.700 --> 2:23:18.420
 Well, I mean, how did mass slavery occur?

2:23:18.420 --> 2:23:22.380
 How did, you know, like just big dogs playing with not?

2:23:22.380 --> 2:23:27.380
 I think slavery and a lot of the atrocities in history

2:23:29.660 --> 2:23:32.780
 happened when the power differential was not as great

2:23:32.780 --> 2:23:35.820
 as we're talking about with AI potentially.

2:23:35.820 --> 2:23:38.500
 Is that not somehow worse then?

2:23:38.500 --> 2:23:39.420
 It's not obvious to me.

2:23:39.420 --> 2:23:42.220
 It's not obvious that things that are way more powerful.

2:23:43.180 --> 2:23:44.020
 That's fair, okay.

2:23:44.020 --> 2:23:45.380
 So I think you're.

2:23:45.380 --> 2:23:47.700
 I guess, how do you restrain it though?

2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:50.180
 There's a lot of different discussions of how to.

2:23:51.380 --> 2:23:52.300
 I guess even restrain each other.

2:23:52.300 --> 2:23:54.180
 Cause let's say I go and decide to strike someone's child,

2:23:54.180 --> 2:23:55.900
 which I'd like to think I wouldn't do.

2:23:55.900 --> 2:23:59.380
 I will be promptly, I will find myself in front of a judge.

2:23:59.380 --> 2:24:01.060
 And so I feel like there's a lot.

2:24:01.060 --> 2:24:03.460
 Can you imagine how many people used to get murdered

2:24:03.460 --> 2:24:04.420
 just in the woods?

2:24:04.420 --> 2:24:05.260
 Yeah.

2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:08.100
 I mean, I would just presume it's a lot, you know?

2:24:08.100 --> 2:24:10.980
 And I don't think most people are lunatics like that,

2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:11.820
 but I would just say.

2:24:11.820 --> 2:24:12.660
 But that's the point.

2:24:12.660 --> 2:24:14.220
 Given though, if you're given to that,

2:24:14.220 --> 2:24:17.220
 your ability to get away with it was greater in the past

2:24:17.220 --> 2:24:19.620
 because of chance of detection was less.

2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:21.420
 So that doesn't, I don't know.

2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:22.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:24:22.260 --> 2:24:24.460
 This is what that's called in artificial intelligence,

2:24:24.460 --> 2:24:29.140
 AI safety research called value alignment of ensuring

2:24:29.140 --> 2:24:32.380
 as you build the systems that become smarter and smarter

2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:33.940
 and more powerful and powerful,

2:24:33.940 --> 2:24:38.260
 make sure that their values are aligned with the entities

2:24:38.260 --> 2:24:40.580
 over which they're becoming powerful with humans.

2:24:40.580 --> 2:24:43.900
 So if you were to talk to an AI that's becoming smarter,

2:24:43.900 --> 2:24:45.100
 at first it's dumber than you,

2:24:45.100 --> 2:24:47.460
 but then it's becoming smarter and smarter.

2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:50.540
 You have to create mechanisms

2:24:50.540 --> 2:24:52.620
 where you both value the same things.

2:24:52.620 --> 2:24:54.020
 I guess one thing I wonder,

2:24:54.020 --> 2:24:57.660
 so I guess I'm probably not like sharp enough to grasp this

2:24:57.660 --> 2:25:00.220
 if I'm honest, but I guess like, I wonder like,

2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:01.580
 I used to do chess programs.

2:25:01.580 --> 2:25:02.820
 Yeah.

2:25:02.820 --> 2:25:04.980
 You know, it was Deep Blue, Stockfish,

2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:07.980
 and then like AlphaZero and AlphaZero teaching itself

2:25:07.980 --> 2:25:12.140
 to beat Stockfish without any help in four hours.

2:25:12.140 --> 2:25:12.980
 Yeah, yeah.

2:25:12.980 --> 2:25:15.860
 Like it becomes orders of magnitude more intelligence

2:25:15.860 --> 2:25:19.300
 than us in effectively in instantaneous period.

2:25:19.300 --> 2:25:20.540
 I guess what I always wondered,

2:25:20.540 --> 2:25:23.180
 like if you were that much smarter than me,

2:25:24.580 --> 2:25:26.220
 I feel like your ability to manipulate me

2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:28.540
 would be pretty significant or at least potentially, no?

2:25:28.540 --> 2:25:33.540
 But manipulation implies that the incentive is

2:25:34.660 --> 2:25:37.540
 to overpower everything around you.

2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:39.620
 Like there's implied incentives.

2:25:39.620 --> 2:25:43.300
 If your value is to actually, like,

2:25:45.620 --> 2:25:47.460
 it depends what you want in life.

2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:48.300
 Okay.

2:25:48.300 --> 2:25:49.620
 What you want in your system.

2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:53.060
 It's not clear that the goal of an AI system

2:25:53.060 --> 2:25:55.940
 that's all powerful is to destroy all humans.

2:25:55.940 --> 2:25:57.700
 No, I don't think that it is either.

2:25:57.700 --> 2:25:58.540
 I guess what I'm...

2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:00.460
 Or even enslave all humans.

2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:01.300
 That's fair.

2:26:01.300 --> 2:26:02.340
 I guess what I'm trying to suggest

2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:04.580
 is that something adequately powerful,

2:26:04.580 --> 2:26:06.580
 these actions are on the table.

2:26:06.580 --> 2:26:08.340
 Yes, they're on the table and that's scary.

2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:10.500
 And that's why a lot of people are really concerned about it

2:26:10.500 --> 2:26:12.020
 and are working on it.

2:26:12.020 --> 2:26:15.060
 I'm just trying to make the case for AGI

2:26:15.060 --> 2:26:19.980
 because if they're watching this, he's the one to kill.

2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:23.420
 No, actually I was thinking, I was, yeah.

2:26:23.420 --> 2:26:26.020
 I wash toilets like really well.

2:26:28.100 --> 2:26:30.300
 No, I mean, that's the main concern

2:26:30.300 --> 2:26:32.580
 for all the people in the AI state to research.

2:26:32.580 --> 2:26:34.740
 People talk about AGI is,

2:26:34.740 --> 2:26:39.740
 it's kind of disturbing how little people are working

2:26:40.700 --> 2:26:44.700
 on trying to create mechanisms

2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:48.300
 that keep AI's values aligned with ours.

2:26:48.300 --> 2:26:50.620
 That's completely unshocking.

2:26:50.620 --> 2:26:53.460
 Yeah, we humans seem to do only good

2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:57.820
 when like, you know, you even look at like coronavirus.

2:26:57.820 --> 2:27:02.020
 It's like when, like the water has to be leaking

2:27:02.020 --> 2:27:03.020
 from the ceiling.

2:27:03.020 --> 2:27:05.860
 You have to be, there has to be blood everywhere,

2:27:05.860 --> 2:27:08.700
 fire, just destruction.

2:27:08.700 --> 2:27:12.660
 We just seem to ignore completely any trouble.

2:27:12.660 --> 2:27:13.980
 Writing all over the wall.

2:27:13.980 --> 2:27:15.660
 Writing all over the wall.

2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:16.500
 This is fine.

2:27:16.500 --> 2:27:19.180
 Yeah, I'm sure nothing to see here, we'll be okay.

2:27:19.180 --> 2:27:21.300
 But we do all right, especially in the United States.

2:27:21.300 --> 2:27:25.860
 You figure out even when it becomes a really serious problem,

2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:27.940
 taking actions last minute,

2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:30.860
 there's something about the innovative spirit

2:27:30.860 --> 2:27:34.020
 that results in a solution last minute,

2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:35.380
 right before the deadline.

2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:36.220
 It works out.

2:27:36.220 --> 2:27:37.820
 Well, I mean, I don't know how you did school,

2:27:37.820 --> 2:27:38.660
 probably a lot better than me.

2:27:38.660 --> 2:27:40.380
 No, that's exactly how I did school.

2:27:40.380 --> 2:27:42.100
 I couldn't be more, I was no motivation up

2:27:42.100 --> 2:27:43.420
 until like the last, if you're like,

2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:46.740
 we have 22 hours to do the entire semesters of work.

2:27:46.740 --> 2:27:48.060
 Like, let's do this.

2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:48.900
 Yeah.

2:27:48.900 --> 2:27:51.660
 And you get like 19 fricking Mountain Dews and then, yeah.

2:27:51.660 --> 2:27:53.900
 Well, that's why you and I are failures in life

2:27:53.900 --> 2:27:56.700
 because I just talked to, I mentioned Cal Newport

2:27:56.700 --> 2:28:00.860
 with his book, Deep Work and so on.

2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:03.380
 He is of the variety of these creatures

2:28:03.380 --> 2:28:06.980
 that basically does everything ahead of time.

2:28:06.980 --> 2:28:07.820
 That's shocking.

2:28:07.820 --> 2:28:12.820
 Because he dislikes the, he thinks it's unproductive

2:28:13.980 --> 2:28:17.780
 to experience the stress and anxiety of the deadline

2:28:17.780 --> 2:28:21.980
 because you're not going to be your best performance wise

2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:23.900
 and you're not going to do the best work.

2:28:23.900 --> 2:28:27.060
 So it doesn't make any, it's completely irrational

2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:29.300
 to a function based on the deadline.

2:28:29.300 --> 2:28:31.820
 You should have a system, a process that gets stuff,

2:28:31.820 --> 2:28:33.660
 a little bit of stuff done every day.

2:28:33.660 --> 2:28:37.580
 So like you should be, and constantly be systematically

2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:38.620
 honest with yourself.

2:28:38.620 --> 2:28:40.900
 If you say, I'm going to get this stuff done today

2:28:40.900 --> 2:28:42.860
 and this week, at the end of the day,

2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:44.900
 at the end of the week, you have to then reflect

2:28:44.900 --> 2:28:48.220
 on what you did, what you planned and improve that plan,

2:28:48.220 --> 2:28:50.580
 update it constantly, update every day, every week,

2:28:50.580 --> 2:28:53.900
 every quarter, whatever those durations are.

2:28:53.900 --> 2:28:55.940
 As I'm listening to this and reading his stuff,

2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:58.020
 it's like, oh, yeah, I agree with everything.

2:28:58.020 --> 2:29:00.060
 I'm like, yes, I'm clapping.

2:29:00.060 --> 2:29:02.180
 But like the reality is, and then I go back

2:29:02.180 --> 2:29:05.100
 and just eat Cheetos and like, don't do shit

2:29:05.100 --> 2:29:05.940
 until like the last minute.

2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:07.340
 It ain't meant to be cheesy.

2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:11.820
 Actually, I don't eat Cheetos, but yes.

2:29:11.820 --> 2:29:15.660
 But actually, again, not that it's ever going to matter

2:29:15.660 --> 2:29:17.900
 because he's so shockingly productive and well thought out

2:29:17.900 --> 2:29:19.420
 that whatever I've decided to think about

2:29:19.420 --> 2:29:20.780
 trying to monkey wrench in there

2:29:20.780 --> 2:29:22.940
 is definitely going to be able to deal with.

2:29:22.940 --> 2:29:24.980
 But it's funny that again, because you're a human being,

2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:26.580
 not a God, all of your strengths

2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:28.580
 are you have a corresponding weakness.

2:29:28.580 --> 2:29:30.540
 The less you practice working under the gun,

2:29:30.540 --> 2:29:32.580
 the less comfortable you are working under the gun.

2:29:32.580 --> 2:29:34.220
 The more practice you have working under the gun,

2:29:34.220 --> 2:29:35.060
 the better you get at it.

2:29:35.060 --> 2:29:36.900
 The downside is you're always working under the gun.

2:29:36.900 --> 2:29:39.180
 So you're less productive or it's like your work quality

2:29:39.180 --> 2:29:40.100
 maybe drops.

2:29:40.100 --> 2:29:41.180
 So it's an interesting thing.

2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:43.220
 It's like, it's almost like, hey, I wonder if this,

2:29:43.220 --> 2:29:45.660
 I wonder if Khabib Nurmagomedov has a lot of heart

2:29:45.660 --> 2:29:47.780
 and I try to say the answer is almost certainly yes,

2:29:47.780 --> 2:29:49.860
 but you go, well, he hasn't struggled a bunch.

2:29:49.860 --> 2:29:51.420
 Maybe he doesn't struggle well.

2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:53.300
 And it just so happens that he can also work under the gun

2:29:53.300 --> 2:29:55.060
 really well, he just doesn't like to do it.

2:29:55.060 --> 2:29:56.700
 But yeah, but it's an interesting thing.

2:29:56.700 --> 2:29:57.740
 It's like, I guess, what is it?

2:29:57.740 --> 2:29:59.580
 The Aristotle, we are what we repeatedly do.

2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:02.940
 We are all, we're all practicing something all the time.

2:30:02.940 --> 2:30:04.100
 So I guess it's, it's funny.

2:30:04.100 --> 2:30:05.420
 I guess that's the question that I have though.

2:30:05.420 --> 2:30:08.100
 I would love to ask him, it'd be really neat

2:30:08.100 --> 2:30:10.940
 is in certain jobs.

2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:13.260
 I mean, obviously you want to have preparation always,

2:30:13.260 --> 2:30:16.340
 always, but certain things have like a degree of like

2:30:16.340 --> 2:30:19.140
 entropy in the system and you go,

2:30:19.140 --> 2:30:21.740
 I need to practice working under the gun.

2:30:21.740 --> 2:30:22.940
 And I'm not saying that's what I need to do

2:30:22.940 --> 2:30:24.860
 because the fighting, it should be for the most part,

2:30:24.860 --> 2:30:26.180
 it's a really sterile environment.

2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:27.020
 In the grand scheme of things,

2:30:27.020 --> 2:30:28.700
 like fighting in a cage is very sterile

2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:30.660
 compared to most other things in life, right?

2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:32.940
 But dangerous, but sterile.

2:30:32.940 --> 2:30:35.420
 And unless of course, like, you know,

2:30:35.420 --> 2:30:37.500
 like the other guy, the ref decides to hit you,

2:30:37.500 --> 2:30:38.340
 which would be hilarious.

2:30:38.340 --> 2:30:40.500
 But anyway, I guess just going like, okay,

2:30:40.500 --> 2:30:45.220
 so at what value do you get out of adding a degree of,

2:30:45.220 --> 2:30:47.580
 let's say you could even be planned by someone else,

2:30:47.580 --> 2:30:49.900
 but junk in the system.

2:30:49.900 --> 2:30:52.020
 And you just have to work under the gun to make it happen.

2:30:52.020 --> 2:30:53.460
 Let's say for instance, for like police

2:30:53.460 --> 2:30:56.140
 or something like that, the situation turns left hard

2:30:56.140 --> 2:30:57.860
 at some random point in time.

2:30:57.860 --> 2:31:00.020
 And that could happen to any number of people.

2:31:00.020 --> 2:31:01.940
 So I guess it's interesting things that allow

2:31:01.940 --> 2:31:04.020
 for perfect planning or quasi perfect planning

2:31:04.020 --> 2:31:06.420
 versus things that are inherently unstable.

2:31:06.420 --> 2:31:07.580
 And then what are the,

2:31:07.580 --> 2:31:10.780
 what's the psychological fallout of comfort with that?

2:31:10.780 --> 2:31:12.340
 Because I think a lot of people that are really comfortable

2:31:12.340 --> 2:31:15.620
 under the gun, let it happen a lot.

2:31:15.620 --> 2:31:17.340
 For all the good and the bad of that, does that make sense?

2:31:17.340 --> 2:31:18.620
 No, that totally makes sense.

2:31:18.620 --> 2:31:20.940
 And it was, I mean, his answer would be

2:31:20.940 --> 2:31:23.780
 that you have to be honest with yourself

2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:26.660
 if it's valuable for your success

2:31:26.660 --> 2:31:29.140
 to practice being under the gun.

2:31:29.140 --> 2:31:30.900
 And then you should schedule that.

2:31:30.900 --> 2:31:31.980
 Yeah, then he's smart.

2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:34.460
 You should plan that, you should systematically.

2:31:34.460 --> 2:31:37.020
 And then as opposed to doing it half assedly,

2:31:37.020 --> 2:31:39.740
 because it's, as opposed to letting the environment

2:31:39.740 --> 2:31:43.460
 choose the randomness, like control the randomness

2:31:43.460 --> 2:31:46.060
 to where like you optimize it.

2:31:46.060 --> 2:31:48.140
 I wish it's so efficient, it's shocking

2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:49.060
 just to hear about it.

2:31:49.060 --> 2:31:52.620
 Yeah, no, he's, I mean, the same way you are,

2:31:52.620 --> 2:31:53.700
 he's annoying in the same way,

2:31:53.700 --> 2:31:56.460
 which is like he drops truth bombs.

2:31:56.460 --> 2:31:59.500
 It's like, yeah, yeah, that's so true.

2:31:59.500 --> 2:32:02.740
 Yeah, we're probably comparably doing that.

2:32:02.740 --> 2:32:03.580
 No, he does.

2:32:05.140 --> 2:32:07.780
 But he's, so he, his profession requires that.

2:32:07.780 --> 2:32:09.860
 So he's not just like a motivational speaker or whatever.

2:32:09.860 --> 2:32:14.300
 He's a theoretical computer scientist

2:32:14.300 --> 2:32:18.060
 and he needs the long hours in the day

2:32:18.060 --> 2:32:19.780
 of doing like serious math.

2:32:19.780 --> 2:32:21.540
 So it's mostly math proofs.

2:32:21.540 --> 2:32:24.860
 And for that, you have to sit and think really deeply.

2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:26.300
 It's like really hard work.

2:32:26.300 --> 2:32:28.540
 Compared to like what most people do,

2:32:28.540 --> 2:32:31.260
 like even what I, I mean, what I do,

2:32:31.260 --> 2:32:34.580
 like programming is way easier than rigorous math proofs.

2:32:34.580 --> 2:32:37.820
 Cause you have to basically have this machine

2:32:37.820 --> 2:32:42.540
 and you have to, your brain to churn out logic

2:32:43.580 --> 2:32:46.260
 in a focused way while visualizing a bunch of things

2:32:46.260 --> 2:32:47.780
 and holding that in your brain

2:32:47.780 --> 2:32:50.660
 and holding that for 10 minutes, 20 minutes,

2:32:50.660 --> 2:32:52.660
 hopefully several hours.

2:32:52.660 --> 2:32:55.180
 And you're not just like doing homework.

2:32:55.180 --> 2:32:56.860
 You're doing totally novel stuff.

2:32:56.860 --> 2:32:59.020
 So like stuff that nobody's ever done before.

2:32:59.020 --> 2:33:00.820
 So you keep running up against the wall

2:33:00.820 --> 2:33:02.700
 of like, fuck, this is a den.

2:33:02.700 --> 2:33:05.420
 And oh no, wait, is this a dead end?

2:33:05.420 --> 2:33:09.340
 And like that whole frustration, that's serious mental work.

2:33:09.340 --> 2:33:11.220
 That's like incredibly difficult mental work.

2:33:11.220 --> 2:33:13.300
 So he knows what he's talking about.

2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:14.140
 It's amazing.

2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:16.460
 But like you said, he's like, this seems like the standard

2:33:16.460 --> 2:33:19.500
 for the quality of work that he needs is so high

2:33:19.500 --> 2:33:21.340
 that almost anything less than this level

2:33:21.340 --> 2:33:24.260
 of systematization and organization would preclude it.

2:33:24.260 --> 2:33:25.100
 Right?

2:33:25.100 --> 2:33:26.340
 So he can't afford the kind of bullshit

2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:28.740
 that I don't know about you, but that certainly I do,

2:33:28.740 --> 2:33:30.780
 which is like last deadline kind of stuff.

2:33:30.780 --> 2:33:34.420
 Cause you can't do that kind of work last minute

2:33:34.420 --> 2:33:35.780
 on deadline kind of stuff.

2:33:35.780 --> 2:33:39.060
 So my question for him in general is like,

2:33:39.060 --> 2:33:41.700
 and for you and I is like, well,

2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:44.340
 here's these negative patterns that we do

2:33:45.380 --> 2:33:48.020
 of like doing shit last minute and so on.

2:33:49.140 --> 2:33:51.140
 Is this just who we are now?

2:33:51.140 --> 2:33:52.580
 Or are there some?

2:33:52.580 --> 2:33:54.980
 I don't think I'm really big into a free will.

2:33:54.980 --> 2:33:57.940
 You know, I was thinking that it's mostly predestination,

2:33:57.940 --> 2:33:59.420
 at least in this regard.

2:33:59.420 --> 2:34:00.780
 It's the same with like communism.

2:34:00.780 --> 2:34:04.060
 Like, as long as it fits my, whatever is the lazy thing

2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:06.380
 to do, I'll just not believe in free will.

2:34:06.380 --> 2:34:10.620
 I'm not a communism opportunist or that's when that was.

2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:15.620
 I'm an opportunistic communist and capitalist.

2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:18.100
 I just do whatever, whatever is cool at the time.

2:34:18.100 --> 2:34:19.420
 Exactly.

2:34:19.420 --> 2:34:24.420
 Let me ask you to examine some fundamental principles

2:34:24.660 --> 2:34:27.220
 of a particular thing that Joe Rogan brought up to me

2:34:27.220 --> 2:34:29.020
 several times online and offline.

2:34:29.020 --> 2:34:29.860
 Okay.

2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:34.860
 Which is that he thinks that the tie that I wear

2:34:35.780 --> 2:34:40.500
 is something that makes me vulnerable to attack

2:34:40.500 --> 2:34:44.060
 that you should be, the reason he doesn't wear a tie

2:34:44.060 --> 2:34:47.060
 is because he can get choked very easily with a tie.

2:34:47.060 --> 2:34:48.620
 It's a big concern.

2:34:48.620 --> 2:34:52.300
 Okay, my contention, and by the way,

2:34:52.300 --> 2:34:54.420
 he wore a suit last time too.

2:34:54.420 --> 2:34:55.620
 He didn't wear it on the podcast.

2:34:55.620 --> 2:34:57.180
 He wore it for dinner later.

2:34:57.180 --> 2:34:58.300
 Yeah, I wore a suit the other day

2:34:58.300 --> 2:35:00.180
 and I had no socks on.

2:35:00.180 --> 2:35:01.580
 I didn't realize, yeah.

2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:02.700
 You're supposed to wear socks?

2:35:02.700 --> 2:35:03.860
 Yeah, that's my understanding.

2:35:03.860 --> 2:35:04.780
 Why'd you wear a suit?

2:35:04.780 --> 2:35:05.620
 Did you go to court?

2:35:05.620 --> 2:35:07.660
 No, no, not in that, no.

2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:11.180
 Hey, I don't know, I just wanted to play.

2:35:11.180 --> 2:35:13.140
 I wanted to pretend I was an adult for a day.

2:35:13.140 --> 2:35:14.060
 Okay, cool.

2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:18.580
 So my contention is like the jacket,

2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:22.860
 everything is more dangerous than a tie.

2:35:22.860 --> 2:35:24.100
 That's kind of where I was going with that.

2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:25.780
 That's kind of where, yeah, it was my first thought too.

2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:28.660
 Like once the tie becomes an issue, like, yeah.

2:35:28.660 --> 2:35:30.060
 I feel like everything else is already an issue.

2:35:30.060 --> 2:35:31.460
 It's already an issue, yeah.

2:35:31.460 --> 2:35:34.500
 Because the tie to me, now without like messing with it now,

2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:38.900
 is to me has some of the similar problems

2:35:38.900 --> 2:35:40.620
 that a belt does.

2:35:40.620 --> 2:35:42.060
 So like, for example, I don't know about you,

2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:43.460
 maybe you can correct me,

2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:47.020
 but I'm not sure you can use the belt as tied.

2:35:50.340 --> 2:35:53.540
 I know there's some kind of guards

2:35:53.540 --> 2:35:55.700
 you can probably utilize the belt with,

2:35:55.700 --> 2:35:58.780
 but the belt, sorry, when it's tied around the waist.

2:35:58.780 --> 2:36:00.660
 Are you talking about a belt belt or a gi belt?

2:36:00.660 --> 2:36:01.500
 Sorry, gi belt.

2:36:01.500 --> 2:36:02.340
 Okay. Sorry.

2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:04.420
 Gi belt, importantly, gi belt.

2:36:04.420 --> 2:36:09.420
 It's not that great of a thing to use in most cases,

2:36:09.900 --> 2:36:12.060
 I would say, because it slides.

2:36:12.060 --> 2:36:13.140
 Yep, that's true.

2:36:13.140 --> 2:36:18.140
 It doesn't, you can probably invent a few interesting ways

2:36:18.420 --> 2:36:21.300
 to use it as leverage, as control and so on,

2:36:21.300 --> 2:36:24.980
 but there's just so many more things around the gi belt

2:36:24.980 --> 2:36:26.340
 that are better.

2:36:26.340 --> 2:36:28.900
 And so for me, the tie, what people don't realize.

2:36:28.900 --> 2:36:29.740
 That's better.

2:36:29.740 --> 2:36:30.780
 Are we trying to sell a DVD here

2:36:30.780 --> 2:36:32.780
 and have some widgets and bells and whistles?

2:36:32.780 --> 2:36:33.620
 Because in that case,

2:36:33.620 --> 2:36:35.220
 the belt is really important part of what we do.

2:36:35.220 --> 2:36:37.700
 And I would really encourage you guys to look into it.

2:36:37.700 --> 2:36:40.500
 If we're trying to actually like learn something and say,

2:36:40.500 --> 2:36:42.740
 like you said, we're surrounded by better options.

2:36:42.740 --> 2:36:43.580
 Well, that's the thing.

2:36:43.580 --> 2:36:46.420
 I mean, it's not obvious to me that the belt,

2:36:46.420 --> 2:36:48.260
 maybe there's actually undiscovered things

2:36:48.260 --> 2:36:49.980
 about using the belt.

2:36:49.980 --> 2:36:52.340
 I think people have used like putting a foot

2:36:52.340 --> 2:36:55.580
 inside the belt somehow, inside the gi belt.

2:36:55.580 --> 2:36:57.580
 This is a no punches, gi grappling situation.

2:36:57.580 --> 2:36:58.420
 Yes.

2:36:58.420 --> 2:36:59.260
 I guess so.

2:36:59.260 --> 2:37:00.100
 Sort of fairly contrived, right?

2:37:00.100 --> 2:37:01.820
 But with punches too, like, is there,

2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:04.100
 okay, let's talk about a street fights with a belt

2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:06.700
 that's like a jeans belt, like a belt, clothing belt.

2:37:06.700 --> 2:37:07.820
 Okay, so I get to take it off

2:37:07.820 --> 2:37:10.380
 and whip them in the face with the buckle?

2:37:10.380 --> 2:37:11.540
 How serious is this street fight?

2:37:11.540 --> 2:37:12.900
 Are we talking like that far and open?

2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:13.740
 No, 100% serious.

2:37:13.740 --> 2:37:15.140
 Or are we talking like, oh, okay.

2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:17.340
 No, like death, like one of you has to die.

2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:18.420
 Oh, yikes, whoa.

2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:19.260
 Okay.

2:37:19.260 --> 2:37:20.820
 Oh, you ever, like.

2:37:20.820 --> 2:37:22.420
 I'm in this situation all the time.

2:37:22.420 --> 2:37:23.260
 I understand.

2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:26.220
 And there's a reason I'm still here.

2:37:26.220 --> 2:37:28.420
 I had something, I had somebody try to fight me

2:37:28.420 --> 2:37:29.260
 to Starbucks the other day.

2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:30.860
 I fight kids, we're talking about power differential.

2:37:30.860 --> 2:37:31.700
 Yeah, hey.

2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:32.540
 I just beat up kids all the time.

2:37:32.540 --> 2:37:34.500
 Just pick the easy W's, you gotta get the easy W's

2:37:34.500 --> 2:37:35.340
 if you want the hard ones.

2:37:35.340 --> 2:37:36.380
 I'm undefeated.

2:37:36.380 --> 2:37:37.860
 Come around the playground, watch what happens.

2:37:37.860 --> 2:37:41.500
 No, like to the death, what is their clothing

2:37:41.500 --> 2:37:43.940
 that's useful, you know?

2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:44.780
 From my perspective.

2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:46.780
 You mean like for your use or their use?

2:37:46.780 --> 2:37:48.860
 Both, my use, their use.

2:37:48.860 --> 2:37:52.660
 No, like I like how you wanted to take the belt off

2:37:52.660 --> 2:37:54.140
 and use the buckle to hit them with.

2:37:54.140 --> 2:37:56.740
 But first of all, how are you gonna take off the belt?

2:37:56.740 --> 2:38:00.300
 Well, there's a lot of effort involved in unclothing.

2:38:00.300 --> 2:38:02.420
 Well, what I was figuring was when they started

2:38:02.420 --> 2:38:04.060
 to see me take my pants off in the fight,

2:38:04.060 --> 2:38:04.980
 they were like, what?

2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:07.820
 They're gonna pause and rethink the situation for a second?

2:38:07.820 --> 2:38:08.660
 Yes.

2:38:08.660 --> 2:38:09.500
 And I'm making dead eye contact, obviously,

2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:10.500
 this is going on.

2:38:10.500 --> 2:38:12.020
 Yeah, exactly, nodding.

2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:13.460
 And then, you know, by the time they realized

2:38:13.460 --> 2:38:15.820
 you took a belt off until you could whip them with it,

2:38:15.820 --> 2:38:18.780
 you actually, you're already one, possibly two steps ahead.

2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:21.180
 Okay, so fine, let's not talk about your own clothing,

2:38:21.180 --> 2:38:22.020
 let's talk about their clothing.

2:38:22.020 --> 2:38:23.580
 Okay, I'll take off their belt and hit them with it.

2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:25.380
 No, but that's much harder to do.

2:38:25.380 --> 2:38:26.820
 No question, but if you can do it.

2:38:26.820 --> 2:38:29.100
 Oh, I'm maintaining, I can, no, I just said.

2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:31.780
 Like, how did it come to this?

2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:34.780
 There's, but the point is there's alternatives

2:38:34.780 --> 2:38:36.300
 that are perhaps more effective.

2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:37.140
 Yeah.

2:38:37.140 --> 2:38:39.780
 In my perspective, this might be clueless,

2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:43.220
 there's almost no clothing that's more effective

2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:46.960
 than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling.

2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:49.700
 Like, I feel like clothing.

2:38:49.700 --> 2:38:51.260
 Particularly when you start to add hitting,

2:38:51.260 --> 2:38:52.980
 like every single time I start grabbing your clothes,

2:38:52.980 --> 2:38:55.160
 if you start hitting and it's not like nothing could work,

2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:56.440
 but most of the time you're like,

2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:58.980
 why am I not using my arms for something better

2:38:58.980 --> 2:39:00.700
 than what I'm doing them right now?

2:39:00.700 --> 2:39:01.580
 Right, yeah.

2:39:01.580 --> 2:39:04.860
 It's very difficult for me to, I don't know,

2:39:04.860 --> 2:39:06.280
 in terms of just distance,

2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:08.720
 I can't imagine a case of different distances,

2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:12.800
 even like situations where, let's not talk about like,

2:39:13.660 --> 2:39:16.460
 like a situation where you haven't both yet agreed

2:39:16.460 --> 2:39:17.700
 that a fight is happening.

2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:21.220
 Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then.

2:39:21.220 --> 2:39:22.140
 I mean. Solid clothing?

2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:23.660
 Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket

2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:25.260
 because you can snatch somebody on their face.

2:39:25.260 --> 2:39:26.580
 Snatch down.

2:39:26.580 --> 2:39:27.980
 Yeah, you know, it's like, if you, if you took my,

2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:29.940
 like, you know, like you snap down and judo,

2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:32.080
 like how easy it is to snap down a beginner.

2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:32.920
 Yeah.

2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:33.740
 It's like.

2:39:33.740 --> 2:39:34.580
 So I agree with you.

2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:35.740
 Actually a tie in that sense

2:39:35.740 --> 2:39:37.740
 might be a really effective way to snap down.

2:39:37.740 --> 2:39:39.340
 So like the snap down is really powerful

2:39:39.340 --> 2:39:43.060
 to change the like disorient the situation

2:39:43.060 --> 2:39:45.660
 and give you a lot of different opportunities

2:39:45.660 --> 2:39:49.540
 for, you know, taking their back, taking them down.

2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:50.540
 Doing hilarious stuff,

2:39:50.540 --> 2:39:52.780
 like snapping them down with a tie into your knee.

2:39:52.780 --> 2:39:55.400
 And then when they come back up doing this, you're already.

2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:57.020
 So yeah, in that sense, I agree,

2:39:57.020 --> 2:39:58.460
 but not as a choking mechanism

2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:00.500
 because the concern Joe had is choke.

2:40:00.500 --> 2:40:02.100
 I think you would probably choke me with your tie

2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:03.480
 more easily than I could choke you with your tie.

2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:04.320
 Probably.

2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:05.140
 I'm serious.

2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:05.980
 Cause like, if you get, you can get,

2:40:05.980 --> 2:40:06.820
 like you get my back

2:40:06.820 --> 2:40:08.620
 and you can put it around somebody's neck, you know,

2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:11.520
 like, like, like, you ever see a diehard?

2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:12.360
 Yeah.

2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:15.220
 Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde dude

2:40:15.220 --> 2:40:16.060
 or whatever was,

2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:18.180
 it was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the,

2:40:18.180 --> 2:40:20.580
 with the chain and then he ended up getting choked himself

2:40:20.580 --> 2:40:22.100
 with the chain if I recall this properly.

2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:23.660
 But anyway, yeah, like, like that.

2:40:23.660 --> 2:40:25.340
 But I don't, I don't feel like,

2:40:25.340 --> 2:40:27.200
 I feel like if I start grabbing your tie,

2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:29.940
 you have too many other great options.

2:40:29.940 --> 2:40:31.260
 I mean, I do like the snap down

2:40:31.260 --> 2:40:32.420
 that you actually made me realize.

2:40:32.420 --> 2:40:34.060
 No, I think you have a good there.

2:40:34.060 --> 2:40:34.900
 What's that?

2:40:34.900 --> 2:40:35.900
 I think you're on the right path with it.

2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:36.740
 With a snap down?

2:40:36.740 --> 2:40:38.220
 Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these,

2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:39.500
 like, you know, like, like you,

2:40:39.500 --> 2:40:40.660
 like you poke your finger in my chest

2:40:40.660 --> 2:40:42.440
 and then snap down real quick.

2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:43.280
 Oh yeah.

2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:45.380
 And also, socially speaking,

2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:48.020
 it's not a threatening thing to, you know,

2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:49.460
 to reach for the tie.

2:40:49.460 --> 2:40:51.020
 It's not particularly like a business setting.

2:40:51.020 --> 2:40:51.860
 You know what I mean?

2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:52.880
 They'll never see it coming.

2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:53.720
 Yeah.

2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:54.820
 Cause I was thinking choke,

2:40:54.820 --> 2:40:56.900
 but it's not, it's a really good leverage point

2:40:56.900 --> 2:40:58.540
 cause like grabbing a jacket,

2:40:58.540 --> 2:41:00.620
 the jacket will slide if you try to snap down.

2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:02.100
 You really have to get a hole,

2:41:02.100 --> 2:41:03.380
 like a really good hold.

2:41:03.380 --> 2:41:04.220
 That's a good point.

2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:05.040
 Cause it's around the back of the neck.

2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:05.880
 But what if it's a clip on?

2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:07.060
 How much of a jackass would you look like?

2:41:07.060 --> 2:41:08.660
 You feel like,

2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:10.100
 and then they just stick you on.

2:41:10.100 --> 2:41:11.940
 But you ever see the Japanese politician

2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:13.020
 or I think it was Japan.

2:41:13.020 --> 2:41:13.860
 The judo throw?

2:41:13.860 --> 2:41:15.020
 Yeah, it was, that guy is so,

2:41:15.020 --> 2:41:16.700
 he was so calm and cool.

2:41:16.700 --> 2:41:18.580
 Had like, it was every,

2:41:18.580 --> 2:41:20.540
 it was beautiful technique.

2:41:20.540 --> 2:41:23.820
 The level of, actually the throw was even gentle.

2:41:23.820 --> 2:41:24.780
 But yeah, it was perfect.

2:41:24.780 --> 2:41:25.620
 It was amazing.

2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:26.440
 Well executed.

2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:27.280
 Yeah.

2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:29.380
 More of our politicians just toss the shit out of each other.

2:41:29.380 --> 2:41:31.300
 Yeah, we need more Teddy Roosevelts.

2:41:31.300 --> 2:41:32.120
 Exactly.

2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:33.640
 I like our politicians like talking about fighting

2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:35.100
 when it's clear that none of them even,

2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:37.220
 it would ever have been in a fight ever.

2:41:37.220 --> 2:41:38.060
 Yeah.

2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:39.460
 Somebody was saying Teddy Roosevelt was interesting.

2:41:39.460 --> 2:41:40.960
 I didn't realize this.

2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:44.140
 Is he's one of the greatest presidents this country's had.

2:41:44.140 --> 2:41:46.540
 And he was one of the greatest presidents,

2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:49.140
 even though he faced no crisis whatsoever.

2:41:49.140 --> 2:41:51.020
 He literally willed himself.

2:41:51.020 --> 2:41:53.020
 Like nothing happened during his presidency.

2:41:53.020 --> 2:41:56.820
 He's just a bad motherfucker who made really great speeches.

2:41:56.820 --> 2:41:57.660
 Yeah.

2:41:57.660 --> 2:42:00.660
 So he like, this made me realize,

2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:03.060
 I was just talking to a historian that like,

2:42:03.060 --> 2:42:05.220
 most of the people who we think are great

2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:07.460
 need also a good crisis that they've,

2:42:07.460 --> 2:42:09.220
 that reveal their greatness.

2:42:09.220 --> 2:42:10.380
 But Muhammad Ali, right?

2:42:10.380 --> 2:42:12.860
 And there's Muhammad Ali, I mean, in sports.

2:42:12.860 --> 2:42:13.780
 But you know what I mean?

2:42:13.780 --> 2:42:15.380
 Like the circumstances, what is greatness?

2:42:15.380 --> 2:42:16.220
 You know what I mean?

2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:18.140
 It's like, you have to, it's not just your capacity.

2:42:18.140 --> 2:42:19.840
 It's what you face, right?

2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:21.800
 It's the quality of opposition, circumstance,

2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:22.920
 what you overcome.

2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:25.320
 So I guess what you're saying is Joe Rogan is wrong

2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:26.980
 about the tie thing.

2:42:26.980 --> 2:42:28.820
 You know, I don't want to go so far as saying he's wrong.

2:42:28.820 --> 2:42:30.580
 I, you know, the man's not here to defend himself.

2:42:30.580 --> 2:42:32.460
 Maybe he has some things that I'm not understanding.

2:42:32.460 --> 2:42:33.300
 I'm willing to.

2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:34.340
 No, he has not deeply thought this.

2:42:34.340 --> 2:42:35.820
 This is my main criticism of Joe.

2:42:35.820 --> 2:42:37.300
 He's not deeply thought to this.

2:42:37.300 --> 2:42:39.300
 And the MMA journalists will be like,

2:42:39.300 --> 2:42:41.820
 Ryan Hall says Joe Rogan is wrong.

2:42:41.820 --> 2:42:42.800
 And hates ties.

2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:43.900
 And hates ties.

2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:47.640
 They'll integrate, hit their back in there somehow.

2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:48.480
 Nice, nice.

2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:52.040
 What's, you're talking about greatness

2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:56.620
 and greatness requiring a difficult moment in time.

2:42:56.620 --> 2:42:58.780
 Can you like reflect back and think

2:42:58.780 --> 2:43:01.880
 what are some of the hardest, if not the hardest thing

2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:04.380
 you've ever had to do in your life?

2:43:04.380 --> 2:43:06.940
 Well, you know, I think I've had a bunch of things.

2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:09.420
 You know, I've had a lot of things not go my way.

2:43:09.420 --> 2:43:10.820
 You know, I've been incredibly fortunate.

2:43:10.820 --> 2:43:12.860
 I've had a lot of things go my way also.

2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:17.500
 But leaving, leaving Team Lord Urban in 2008,

2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:21.220
 which I firmly believe was the right thing to do,

2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:25.440
 is one of the, that was very difficult at the time.

2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:27.080
 Not like, not a difficult choice,

2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:29.620
 but it was because of why I was leaving.

2:43:29.620 --> 2:43:30.620
 But.

2:43:30.620 --> 2:43:31.640
 Just psychologically.

2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:33.020
 First of all, loss in general.

2:43:33.020 --> 2:43:33.860
 Leaving.

2:43:33.860 --> 2:43:34.700
 Yeah.

2:43:34.700 --> 2:43:35.700
 Team, family, all kinds.

2:43:35.700 --> 2:43:37.340
 Doesn't matter what the circumstances.

2:43:37.340 --> 2:43:38.340
 I didn't lose any friends,

2:43:38.340 --> 2:43:40.240
 but I lost a lot of people I thought were my friends.

2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:42.460
 And I, I lost training.

2:43:42.460 --> 2:43:44.860
 I lost, I'd also had like a really serious,

2:43:44.860 --> 2:43:46.700
 my wrist only does that.

2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:50.740
 So like, I had a really serious wrist surgery,

2:43:50.740 --> 2:43:52.060
 like that I didn't know if I was going to be able

2:43:52.060 --> 2:43:53.280
 to compete anymore after that.

2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:54.380
 I just got my brown belt.

2:43:54.380 --> 2:43:56.520
 That was, it was a tough time,

2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:58.940
 like psychologically, physically, everything.

2:43:58.940 --> 2:44:01.060
 But I was very, very motivated to do my best

2:44:01.060 --> 2:44:03.180
 and to push through it and to,

2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:04.860
 it was to carry on in a positive direction,

2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:05.680
 no matter what.

2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:06.820
 A different direction.

2:44:06.820 --> 2:44:07.660
 And.

2:44:07.660 --> 2:44:08.680
 Were you lonely?

2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:10.060
 This is the thing about family,

2:44:10.060 --> 2:44:13.500
 even if it's an abusive family, leaving is tough.

2:44:13.500 --> 2:44:14.860
 People are complicated.

2:44:14.860 --> 2:44:17.740
 And even people that I, that I don't think very well of,

2:44:17.740 --> 2:44:19.980
 that I think on the whole, I don't think very well of,

2:44:19.980 --> 2:44:23.320
 it's, it's unfair to paint them with one brush.

2:44:24.260 --> 2:44:26.660
 You know, obviously there's greater and lesser examples

2:44:26.660 --> 2:44:28.420
 of that, like the person we discussed last time,

2:44:28.420 --> 2:44:31.340
 who's an infinitely, you know, beyond almost anyone

2:44:31.340 --> 2:44:32.500
 that we could ever imagine meeting

2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:33.860
 in our own personal lives.

2:44:33.860 --> 2:44:34.700
 Yeah.

2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:35.860
 Yeah.

2:44:35.860 --> 2:44:36.700
 Bloody elbow.

2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:37.820
 Yeah.

2:44:37.820 --> 2:44:41.020
 In terms of forgiveness and hate, I mean, do you,

2:44:41.020 --> 2:44:43.180
 do you have hate in your heart for,

2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:44.700
 for people in your past?

2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:45.540
 No.

2:44:45.540 --> 2:44:46.360
 For that process?

2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:47.200
 No.

2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:48.040
 I mean, there were definitely times

2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:49.500
 where I've been negatively motivated

2:44:49.500 --> 2:44:52.820
 to prove people wrong or to accomplish things in spite.

2:44:52.820 --> 2:44:55.480
 And I think that some of that is valuable,

2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:57.260
 if I be lying, if I felt differently.

2:44:57.260 --> 2:45:00.620
 I think particularly, I do really well in conflict.

2:45:01.500 --> 2:45:02.340
 I'm useless for that.

2:45:02.340 --> 2:45:03.620
 This is the usual deadline thing.

2:45:03.620 --> 2:45:04.460
 I'm useless, yeah.

2:45:04.460 --> 2:45:05.300
 I'm useless.

2:45:05.300 --> 2:45:06.120
 I like the chaos.

2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:06.960
 I'm useless, yeah, I do.

2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:07.800
 I'm useless without an antagonist.

2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:08.900
 I like fighting.

2:45:08.900 --> 2:45:10.460
 I like competition.

2:45:10.460 --> 2:45:11.500
 I like being pushed.

2:45:11.500 --> 2:45:13.260
 I like feeling like if I don't play well,

2:45:13.260 --> 2:45:14.860
 I'm going to get hurt.

2:45:14.860 --> 2:45:16.780
 I have no choice but to play well

2:45:16.780 --> 2:45:18.580
 or play with everything I got at the very least.

2:45:18.580 --> 2:45:21.000
 And I guess I would say though, is, you know,

2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.500
 as I've gotten, you know, more time and, you know,

2:45:24.500 --> 2:45:27.580
 lived a little bit longer, you see, you know,

2:45:27.580 --> 2:45:31.340
 various situations for, you know, you know,

2:45:31.340 --> 2:45:36.100
 with increased color, I guess I would say, increased clarity.

2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:40.980
 And, you know, there are a lot of lessons to be learned,

2:45:40.980 --> 2:45:43.920
 even from times in history or bad experience that we have.

2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:44.760
 And the question is,

2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:46.700
 can we take those lessons and move forward?

2:45:46.700 --> 2:45:48.180
 And that's, again, what I think we're seeing

2:45:48.180 --> 2:45:50.140
 in sometimes socially right now,

2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:52.500
 we're forgetting important lessons of the past.

2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:53.740
 And that's not good.

2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:56.580
 Not saying, hey, I don't get why we could be going

2:45:56.580 --> 2:45:58.700
 in this direction or that, I understand entirely,

2:45:58.700 --> 2:46:00.980
 but hey, let's not forget the lesson

2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:02.420
 so we don't have to learn them again

2:46:02.420 --> 2:46:05.020
 because that doesn't really serve anybody.

2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:07.060
 And anyway, I guess I would say I'm thankful

2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:10.300
 for all of the experiences, difficult and otherwise,

2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:12.500
 mostly difficult, honestly, most of the times I remember,

2:46:12.500 --> 2:46:14.260
 I'm thankful for every loss I've ever had,

2:46:14.260 --> 2:46:15.740
 particularly the tough ones.

2:46:15.740 --> 2:46:18.820
 I'm thankful for, you know, for all the relationships.

2:46:18.820 --> 2:46:20.260
 I've been, many people have taught me many things.

2:46:20.260 --> 2:46:21.340
 They continue to teach me many things,

2:46:21.340 --> 2:46:23.180
 some of whom are still some of my closest friends,

2:46:23.180 --> 2:46:25.260
 some of whom are people I really don't get along with at all.

2:46:25.260 --> 2:46:29.180
 And some of whom are people I think really poorly of.

2:46:29.180 --> 2:46:30.860
 Oh, there's not many of that last group.

2:46:30.860 --> 2:46:34.780
 What I guess I would say is there's been a lot of things

2:46:34.780 --> 2:46:38.180
 and opportunities to learn and, you know, throughout that.

2:46:38.180 --> 2:46:39.660
 And also it's not as if I've never done,

2:46:39.660 --> 2:46:40.820
 made any mistakes myself.

2:46:40.820 --> 2:46:44.260
 Now, again, there are magnitude differences I like to think.

2:46:44.260 --> 2:46:46.140
 And I can definitely say that none of the mistakes

2:46:46.140 --> 2:46:48.660
 that I've ever made have been mistakes of intention.

2:46:48.660 --> 2:46:50.220
 You know, I've screwed up a lot of things in my life,

2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:52.700
 but I can confidently and easily say

2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:55.020
 that I've never had ill intent towards people

2:46:55.020 --> 2:46:55.860
 as I've done it.

2:46:55.860 --> 2:46:56.700
 You sit there and you're like, man,

2:46:56.700 --> 2:46:57.540
 this is the right thing, this is the right thing.

2:46:57.540 --> 2:46:59.060
 And sometimes I've been wrong.

2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:02.260
 But, you know, you never sit out with malicious intent.

2:47:02.260 --> 2:47:03.900
 And I think that when I find

2:47:03.900 --> 2:47:06.060
 that I think people do things differently,

2:47:06.060 --> 2:47:07.740
 when I do think that there is malicious intent,

2:47:07.740 --> 2:47:09.580
 I have a difficult time forgiving that.

2:47:09.580 --> 2:47:14.340
 How does love win over hate, Ryan Hall, in this world?

2:47:14.340 --> 2:47:16.260
 We talk about social media,

2:47:16.260 --> 2:47:18.540
 we talk about forgiveness

2:47:19.580 --> 2:47:23.060
 of some of the more complicated people in your past.

2:47:24.420 --> 2:47:27.460
 If we scale that to the entire world

2:47:27.460 --> 2:47:30.060
 before the AI destroys us,

2:47:30.060 --> 2:47:34.100
 and the human race is lost to history,

2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:35.900
 how do you think love wins over hate?

2:47:35.900 --> 2:47:37.820
 Well, I'd like to preface this by saying

2:47:37.820 --> 2:47:39.740
 I tried to make pancakes the other day.

2:47:39.740 --> 2:47:40.580
 Yes.

2:47:41.580 --> 2:47:42.420
 Didn't work.

2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:44.780
 But I'm happy to comment on this.

2:47:44.780 --> 2:47:49.780
 So basically, I think most of the times

2:47:50.580 --> 2:47:54.540
 that I can think of that I've struggled,

2:47:54.540 --> 2:47:57.900
 you know, and the times that I've read about

2:47:57.900 --> 2:48:01.460
 is being unable to see the humanity in other people.

2:48:01.460 --> 2:48:03.820
 And also, even in sometimes our enemies

2:48:03.820 --> 2:48:05.460
 and the people that have done awful things,

2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:09.060
 and you go, what would allow people to do this,

2:48:09.060 --> 2:48:09.900
 that, or the other?

2:48:09.900 --> 2:48:11.860
 And that doesn't forgive what they've done,

2:48:11.860 --> 2:48:13.860
 depending upon, you know, some things are forgivable,

2:48:13.860 --> 2:48:15.020
 some things are less so.

2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:16.460
 But you wanna understand why.

2:48:16.460 --> 2:48:17.540
 It's like, to our knowledge,

2:48:17.540 --> 2:48:19.460
 demons don't populate our world.

2:48:19.460 --> 2:48:22.620
 Neither do like literal angels walking around

2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:24.140
 being actually perfect.

2:48:24.140 --> 2:48:25.900
 A lot of times, the things that it's,

2:48:25.900 --> 2:48:27.980
 I find it deeply amusing watching, you know,

2:48:27.980 --> 2:48:29.980
 people hoisted by their own batard on Twitter,

2:48:29.980 --> 2:48:32.340
 even though it's gross and it's really unproductive.

2:48:32.340 --> 2:48:35.060
 It's actually like equal parts amusing and like awful,

2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:37.180
 because you're not happy that someone's

2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:40.780
 being raked over the coals, particularly unjustifiably.

2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:43.020
 But it is funny when it's the exact same thing

2:48:43.020 --> 2:48:44.540
 they were raking others over the coals for,

2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:45.940
 not like a week or two prior,

2:48:45.940 --> 2:48:48.380
 and that's happened repeatedly and will continue to happen.

2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:51.180
 And I guess I would say, as you mentioned, you know,

2:48:51.180 --> 2:48:53.300
 a prior, you know, like a recognition

2:48:53.300 --> 2:48:56.740
 of the humanity of others of that all of us make mistakes,

2:48:56.740 --> 2:48:58.860
 that it's difficult to understand intention.

2:48:58.860 --> 2:49:00.580
 I've had arguments with close friends of mine

2:49:00.580 --> 2:49:03.940
 over text message where both of us ended up super pissed

2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:07.220
 because we were completely misreading what the tone,

2:49:07.220 --> 2:49:08.900
 the intention of what the other person was doing.

2:49:08.900 --> 2:49:11.460
 And even if I was reading it correctly, which I wasn't,

2:49:11.460 --> 2:49:15.660
 it's so easy to ascribe the most negative possible,

2:49:15.660 --> 2:49:18.300
 you know, the least charitable assessment

2:49:18.300 --> 2:49:19.140
 of what they're doing.

2:49:19.140 --> 2:49:21.340
 And I think that that's such a dangerous way

2:49:21.340 --> 2:49:23.380
 to live your life and it's also just a fruitless way

2:49:23.380 --> 2:49:24.260
 to live your life.

2:49:24.260 --> 2:49:26.540
 You know, it's one thing to go, hey, why did you do that?

2:49:26.540 --> 2:49:27.460
 I was pissed.

2:49:27.460 --> 2:49:28.380
 Did you, what did you do?

2:49:28.380 --> 2:49:29.980
 You just, you did that to make yourself feel better,

2:49:29.980 --> 2:49:31.300
 like you're damn right I did.

2:49:31.300 --> 2:49:34.300
 And have I done that plenty of times in my life?

2:49:34.300 --> 2:49:36.540
 Yeah, I would lie if I said that I didn't, you know,

2:49:36.540 --> 2:49:38.100
 why did you, why did you punch that guy in the face?

2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:40.980
 He was going crazy at me and hit me and I asked him to stop.

2:49:40.980 --> 2:49:43.100
 And then I gave warning and I put him on his ass.

2:49:43.100 --> 2:49:44.460
 I'm like, no, I'm not sorry.

2:49:44.460 --> 2:49:47.700
 But then looking back now with years to sit on them,

2:49:47.700 --> 2:49:49.980
 like, do I understand why I did what I did?

2:49:49.980 --> 2:49:51.460
 Absolutely.

2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:53.220
 Would I like to respond differently now?

2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:54.140
 Yeah, I would.

2:49:54.140 --> 2:49:55.980
 You know, and it doesn't mean that,

2:49:55.980 --> 2:49:59.340
 I think plenty of things that people do are understandable.

2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:01.980
 Doesn't mean, understandable doesn't mean correct.

2:50:01.980 --> 2:50:03.580
 Understandable doesn't mean that you go,

2:50:03.580 --> 2:50:04.420
 oh yeah, that's great.

2:50:04.420 --> 2:50:07.940
 You go, I could see someone doing such a thing.

2:50:07.940 --> 2:50:09.740
 But I guess just trying to understand

2:50:09.740 --> 2:50:11.300
 and see the humanity in others.

2:50:11.300 --> 2:50:12.900
 Cause if I can't see the humanity in others,

2:50:12.900 --> 2:50:14.540
 how can I see it in myself?

2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:17.300
 And also, you know, how am I meant to interact with everyone?

2:50:17.300 --> 2:50:18.540
 As you said, whether, you know,

2:50:18.540 --> 2:50:20.620
 even if we're a society of individuals

2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:22.180
 for at least for the time being, hopefully,

2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:23.860
 you know, in perpetuity,

2:50:23.860 --> 2:50:26.420
 we still come together as a whole.

2:50:26.420 --> 2:50:28.660
 And watching, it's weird.

2:50:28.660 --> 2:50:30.660
 Like you said, if I only ask why once,

2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:32.900
 I start with, stay out of my way

2:50:32.900 --> 2:50:33.740
 and I'll stay out of yours.

2:50:33.740 --> 2:50:34.700
 Leave me the fuck alone.

2:50:34.700 --> 2:50:36.740
 You're like, okay, that's fine, Ryan.

2:50:36.740 --> 2:50:37.580
 But that's easy for you to say,

2:50:37.580 --> 2:50:40.380
 living in a society that doesn't actually function like that.

2:50:40.380 --> 2:50:41.940
 So it's a little bit cheap.

2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:43.860
 But if I recognize that that's step one is,

2:50:43.860 --> 2:50:45.340
 I don't hurt you and you don't hurt me.

2:50:45.340 --> 2:50:48.300
 But then we go, well, but how can I help you?

2:50:48.300 --> 2:50:49.140
 That's step two.

2:50:49.140 --> 2:50:50.540
 And then it goes way beyond that

2:50:50.540 --> 2:50:51.740
 and a lot further than I've thought about it.

2:50:51.740 --> 2:50:52.780
 But I guess what I would just say is,

2:50:52.780 --> 2:50:55.220
 again, recognition of the humanity in others

2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:57.020
 and that we all have different strengths,

2:50:57.020 --> 2:50:57.860
 we all have different weaknesses.

2:50:57.860 --> 2:50:59.260
 And you can never really be sure

2:50:59.260 --> 2:51:00.260
 where the other person's coming from.

2:51:00.260 --> 2:51:02.060
 But if we approach things charitably,

2:51:02.060 --> 2:51:05.660
 as charitably as we would hope others would approach us,

2:51:05.660 --> 2:51:06.740
 I think we'll do a lot better.

2:51:06.740 --> 2:51:08.420
 And I guess one thing that I read that I liked

2:51:08.420 --> 2:51:10.700
 that I thought was accurate and unfortunately disappointing

2:51:10.700 --> 2:51:13.460
 was everyone is a great, you know, jury,

2:51:13.460 --> 2:51:15.300
 I read there, I'm sorry, a great lawyer for themselves

2:51:15.300 --> 2:51:16.500
 and a judge for others.

2:51:16.500 --> 2:51:18.940
 And I think that's a terrible way to live life,

2:51:18.940 --> 2:51:20.380
 even if it's an understandable one.

2:51:20.380 --> 2:51:21.220
 I don't know, I'm sorry.

2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:24.660
 And then probably flipping that is the right way to live.

2:51:24.660 --> 2:51:28.580
 Being constantly judgmental of yourself

2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:30.380
 and a defender of others.

2:51:30.380 --> 2:51:32.660
 And that results ultimately in an interaction

2:51:32.660 --> 2:51:35.380
 that deescalates versus escalates.

2:51:35.380 --> 2:51:36.380
 Right.

2:51:36.380 --> 2:51:38.660
 And we can all live in a world like that.

2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:39.780
 And sometimes you're like, hey man,

2:51:39.780 --> 2:51:41.740
 people that deserve punishment won't get it.

2:51:41.740 --> 2:51:43.140
 Like, okay, hey, but what do they say?

2:51:43.140 --> 2:51:45.340
 Better to have 10 guilty people go free

2:51:45.340 --> 2:51:47.700
 than wanting this in person, you know, burn.

2:51:47.700 --> 2:51:51.420
 And ultimately that is, I think that is a better world

2:51:51.420 --> 2:51:53.420
 than the other way around.

2:51:53.420 --> 2:51:58.220
 And if all else fails, join the team that builds the AI

2:51:58.220 --> 2:51:59.540
 that kills all humans.

2:51:59.540 --> 2:52:00.380
 Yeah, obviously.

2:52:00.380 --> 2:52:01.260
 I mean, if you have to be on a team,

2:52:01.260 --> 2:52:02.100
 pick the winning team.

2:52:02.100 --> 2:52:03.260
 That's been the...

2:52:03.260 --> 2:52:04.740
 That's my hiring pitch, actually.

2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:05.820
 That's a good hiring pitch.

2:52:05.820 --> 2:52:07.140
 You still taking resumes?

2:52:07.140 --> 2:52:10.940
 You want to be on the team that doesn't die

2:52:10.940 --> 2:52:12.220
 during the great apocalypse.

2:52:12.220 --> 2:52:13.060
 Not immediately.

2:52:13.060 --> 2:52:14.540
 You want to be on the one that's, you know,

2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:17.100
 eventually long suffering and stepped on, right?

2:52:17.100 --> 2:52:17.940
 Yeah.

2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:19.580
 Life is suffering, Ryan Hall.

2:52:19.580 --> 2:52:21.740
 This was an amazing conversation.

2:52:21.740 --> 2:52:22.780
 I really enjoyed talking to you.

2:52:22.780 --> 2:52:24.580
 I could probably talk to you for many more hours.

2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:26.580
 I hope I do as well.

2:52:26.580 --> 2:52:28.260
 Ryan, I love you, buddy.

2:52:28.260 --> 2:52:29.340
 This was a great conversation.

2:52:29.340 --> 2:52:30.420
 Thanks for talking to me.

2:52:30.420 --> 2:52:31.260
 Thank you so much for having me.

2:52:31.260 --> 2:52:33.020
 I really appreciate it.

2:52:33.020 --> 2:52:35.460

 And now let me leave you with some words

2:52:50.620 --> 2:52:53.380
 from Frank Herbert in Dune.

2:52:53.380 --> 2:52:55.020
 I must not fear.

2:52:55.020 --> 2:52:57.180
 Fear is the mind killer.

2:52:57.180 --> 2:53:01.100
 Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.

2:53:01.100 --> 2:53:02.860
 I will face my fear.

2:53:02.860 --> 2:53:05.820
 I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

2:53:05.820 --> 2:53:07.460
 And when it has gone past,

2:53:07.460 --> 2:53:10.700
 I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

2:53:10.700 --> 2:53:14.260
 Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.

2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:15.660
 Only I will remain.

2:53:15.660 --> 2:53:43.660
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
