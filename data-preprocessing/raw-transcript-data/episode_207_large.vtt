00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
 The following is a conversation with Chris Duffin, the mad scientist of strength.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.900
 He's one of the strongest people in the world, but is also an engineer of some of the most

00:10.900 --> 00:13.880
 innovative strength equipment I've ever seen.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.680
 Check out his company Kabuki Strength.

00:16.680 --> 00:22.800
 He is the only person who squatted and deadlifted 1000 pounds for multiple reps, and achieved

00:22.800 --> 00:25.000
 many other amazing feats of strength.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.440
 He has lived one hell of a life of hardship and triumph, as he writes about in his book

00:30.440 --> 00:33.640
 called The Eagle and the Dragon.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.840
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Headspace, Magic Spoon, Sun Basket, and Ladder.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.540
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:43.540 --> 00:48.980
 As a side note, let me say that I was always a fan of strength, both powerlifting and Olympic

00:48.980 --> 00:53.680
 weightlifting, both as a fan and practitioner.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.040
 Basically I'm a fan of people who are willing to put in years of hard work towards finding

00:58.040 --> 01:03.240
 out what the limits of their body is, and then smashing past those limits.

01:03.240 --> 01:10.200
 People like Chris Duffin, or on the Olympic weightlifting side, people like Dmitri Klokov.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.600
 That guy is great.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.920
 This is why I love watching the Olympics, both the heartbreaks and the triumphs.

01:15.920 --> 01:22.080
 They all reveal the incredible heights that the human mind and the human body can reach.

01:22.080 --> 01:28.360
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Chris Duffin.

01:28.360 --> 01:33.260
 You've been a part of several incredible feats of strength.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.700
 Which was the hardest, or maybe one you're most proud of?

01:37.700 --> 01:42.640
 Definitely the one I'm most proud of is that journey for the grand goals.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.440
 It was like a five year scope that I chased this.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.360
 And so when you think about training, it took more than five years, obviously.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.280
 By that point, I'd been training for over 25 years.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
 But it makes me proud.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.880
 I mean, there were three distinct things that I wanted to accomplish out of this.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.280
 So it was really thought out.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.680
 And this was kind of my exit from being a competitive lifter.

02:06.680 --> 02:11.800
 And basically saying, hey, I'm going to be an Instagram lifter, an exhibition lifter,

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
 or whatever.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.680
 I've done this for 16 years, I was number one in the world for like eight years straight,

02:17.680 --> 02:18.680
 all time world records.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.240
 And I'm like, I'm not going to do that anymore.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.640
 What I want to do is just something deep down to me that is really important.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.960
 And there's three things that were driving this.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.520
 And this is a five year journey that I went through to do this.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.720
 I really wanted to showcase that you could do something that is well beyond the scope

02:37.720 --> 02:40.000
 of what people think is humanly possible.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.360
 So just this inspiration thing, this grand over the top, like if you set your mind to

02:47.360 --> 02:50.700
 a single minded goal, you can go so much further.

02:50.700 --> 02:54.760
 And I didn't even say what the goal was upfront, because it was so far out there, I would have

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
 been laughed at.

02:55.760 --> 03:01.000
 And that's, I think big goals should be kept pretty damn close to start with for that reason

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
 too.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.200
 But and then the second piece was to walk the walk to show like the principles of what

03:07.200 --> 03:13.120
 I believed in around human movement, the ability to manage and control the spinal mechanics

03:13.120 --> 03:15.320
 and the output that can have on the body.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.780
 And so I wanted to take the two most basic movements that every able bodied person should

03:19.780 --> 03:20.780
 be able to do.

03:20.780 --> 03:26.000
 So fundamental movement patterns, the squat, which is like, in the developmental approach

03:26.000 --> 03:32.400
 is around nine months as a baby from a developmental kinesiology standpoint, and a really basic

03:32.400 --> 03:35.560
 pattern that every able bodied person should be able to master the other one being the

03:35.560 --> 03:40.840
 hip hinge, being able to pick something up off the ground, a deadlift.

03:40.840 --> 03:46.260
 And I wanted to do those two, not just one, because I wanted to show the principles that

03:46.260 --> 03:55.120
 I wasn't built for one, I wasn't a specialist because of my lever links, torso links, all

03:55.120 --> 04:01.660
 that, any outliers, because nobody had ever done a thousand pound squat.

04:01.660 --> 04:05.800
 So this is it is and a thousand pound deadlift.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.560
 It was outside of the scope of what anybody's there's like half a dozen people that have

04:10.560 --> 04:14.320
 done one or the other, but nobody's ever done both.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.800
 And I wanted to do something unique.

04:15.800 --> 04:21.960
 I wanted to do them, not only do it, but do them for reps to leave literally no question

04:21.960 --> 04:22.960
 out there.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.960
 And there's no competition for that.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.200
 So it was this is what I'm going to go do.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.560
 And to pull it off, I had some past issues with my elbows and stuff that I couldn't work

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
 around.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.560
 So I had to wear straps, which was another reason I couldn't do it in the competition

04:37.560 --> 04:39.080
 setting.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.920
 So the first year I worked up and I did a thousand and two pound deadlift plates were

04:43.920 --> 04:44.920
 weighed afterwards.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.720
 It was a couple a little bit over and I did it for almost three reps.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.000
 And that still stands as a Guinness world record.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.480
 Just the one rep does is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.440
 And one other person has deadlifted a thousand for reps at this point.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.520
 And that was a Thor Bjornsson from Game of Thrones.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.160
 He's done a thousand for a double as well.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.840
 So then the next four years and I did a bunch of feats of strength on the way, but it was

05:08.840 --> 05:14.200
 all about building that axial loading capacity, the strength that because now I'm moving the

05:14.200 --> 05:16.660
 weight from my hands up to my shoulders.

05:16.660 --> 05:22.880
 And so to do it for reps is like so much harder than a single like five to 10 seconds versus

05:22.880 --> 05:30.560
 30 plus seconds to be able to buffer and manage all that with that kind of load is just crazy.

05:30.560 --> 05:34.880
 So it's literally about the duration that your body is carrying the load.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.560
 Yeah, that's a big part of it.

05:36.560 --> 05:41.680
 Yeah, because you have to you're using the resource of the diaphragm for stabilization.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.160
 And so it it's also responsible for respiration and all this other stuff.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.360
 So even when you're not squatting, you've got to be handling those loads.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.640
 Just holding that weight is fascinating.

05:50.640 --> 05:57.240
 It's like it's fascinating that the human body can do that, can can maintain that structure,

05:57.240 --> 06:02.840
 just everything working together, that the biology, the skeletal structure, the the musculature

06:02.840 --> 06:05.120
 on top of that can hold the weight.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.500
 It's fascinating to watch.

06:06.500 --> 06:11.720
 Everything is very intentful about positioning and how you're creating pressure and all this

06:11.720 --> 06:12.980
 sort of stuff, especially for me.

06:12.980 --> 06:16.400
 So when I mentioned that half a dozen people have squatted it and half a dozen people have

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
 deadlifted it.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.040
 You understand those people all weigh three hundred and eighty to four hundred and forty

06:20.040 --> 06:21.040
 pounds.

06:21.040 --> 06:26.080
 I weighed to sixty five to two eighty five, depending on where I was between the two.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.440
 So there's that as well.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.440
 Right.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.080
 So big, big difference.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.760
 And over the course of that, I did a lot of other feats of strength that fit in that capacity.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.000
 And we can skip over those.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.520
 But that was hugely invested as far as, you know, what I put into being able to accomplish

06:43.520 --> 06:47.800
 that, because it's it's over the top, which means the other stuff had to shift and I had

06:47.800 --> 06:49.440
 to learn.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.460
 There's so many things that came into place to pull that off.

06:52.460 --> 06:56.600
 And so, yeah, last March, two days before the world shut down, I did it.

06:56.600 --> 07:02.000
 It was supposed to be at the largest equipment exhibition in the world down in San Diego

07:02.000 --> 07:03.140
 as an event.

07:03.140 --> 07:05.200
 And that got shut down a week beforehand, obviously.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.380
 So we moved to let's do it in my gym and invite people.

07:08.380 --> 07:11.960
 And that was on a Saturday and Thursday or Friday, they limited it to twenty five people

07:11.960 --> 07:12.960
 for gatherings.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.400
 I did it on Saturday and then Monday, everything shut down.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.600
 So it was kind of surreal for timing wise.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.600
 Right.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.760
 And so if I hadn't done it, it would have never got done like because I I'd pushed to

07:25.760 --> 07:26.760
 the limit.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.800
 I couldn't come back and do it.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.300
 It was at the total limitation of my capabilities.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.200
 So I'm pretty I'm pretty proud of it.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.360
 And the last piece was a every one of these feats along the way.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.560
 I collaborated with a charity that I believed in.

07:39.560 --> 07:45.280
 And there was a lot of those tied to my life story, which we probably will get into.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.920
 So it was threefold.

07:46.920 --> 07:55.240
 So that inspiration piece, inspiration, motivation, walking the walk and showing like just these

07:55.240 --> 07:59.480
 methodologies that a guy that had to learn to walk again can do something like this with

07:59.480 --> 08:00.480
 no back pain.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.360
 So if you if you there is a way.

08:03.360 --> 08:09.800
 And the third one is is to provide awareness and recognition around a lot of key charities.

08:09.800 --> 08:14.680
 So so your heart was in this journey, but also your mind is just you're like a scholar

08:14.680 --> 08:20.360
 of strength, a scientist of strength, an engineer of strength for reps do a thousand pounds

08:20.360 --> 08:23.240
 squat and deadlift.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.520
 Let's first talk through the actual day you did it.

08:27.520 --> 08:32.720
 What does it take to lift that much for reps?

08:32.720 --> 08:37.040
 The day of is really easy.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.040
 The really the lift itself.

08:40.040 --> 08:44.120
 Other than a few seconds is really easy and not challenging.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.240
 People always ask me, what was it like?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.640
 How beat up were you after that?

08:47.640 --> 08:48.640
 And the deadlift.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.260
 And the simple fact is, it was easy.

08:51.260 --> 08:55.600
 The work to get there was horrendous.

08:55.600 --> 09:00.200
 So so even the psychology of the day you weren't there was not a fear.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.640
 There was not a nervousness.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.760
 There is not a doubt in your mind.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.800
 There were certainly doubts on that day from some training history.

09:07.800 --> 09:14.040
 So there was some major breaks to my confidence in the couple months leading up where I had

09:14.040 --> 09:17.700
 issues with passing out under the bar.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.480
 So completely losing consciousness.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.660
 And this was on weight less than a thousand pounds even.

09:22.660 --> 09:31.680
 So that was like all this buildup in me going, what if what if I think I have this resolved?

09:31.680 --> 09:34.880
 But what if I get up there and I can't even do a rep?

09:34.880 --> 09:38.580
 How embarrassing will this be that I've been talking about this and planning for this for

09:38.580 --> 09:41.040
 so long?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.680
 But outside of that, I knew I could do it.

09:43.680 --> 09:48.160
 In fact, I wanted to do even more even up to the second rep.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.600
 Training is about, you know, working into a fatigue state.

09:52.600 --> 09:58.180
 So you're building an amount of fatigue in your system.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.920
 And then when you let off of it, that's when you get a compensation.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.280
 And that's how you stairstep training.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.520
 This is periodization.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.300
 But leading into a big event, you're accumulating this massive amount of fatigue.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.720
 And so I was performing at a level that I could do it.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.780
 And so I knew I was going to be able to on me because then you then you give yourself

10:15.780 --> 10:21.480
 that window to be able to recover and supercompensate and be able to do a little bit more.

10:21.480 --> 10:26.920
 So like that first rep when I did it strengthwise, I went, I could do this for five reps like

10:26.920 --> 10:27.920
 it went through my head.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.560
 I'm like feeling I mean, it was easy and it was fast and it felt like amazing.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.640
 And I'm like, I'm going to crush this.

10:34.640 --> 10:40.160
 And then set rep to the realization kicked in as like, oh, this is for reps with a thousand

10:40.160 --> 10:41.720
 pounds on your back.

10:41.720 --> 10:47.760
 And you're fatiguing just like and then the third one was every last thing I could muster

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
 to just finish.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.240
 I mean, I just barely got it done because it's the strength is like there.

10:53.240 --> 10:58.640
 But like that capacity to be able to manage all those resources for that amount of time

10:58.640 --> 11:01.080
 because not just leg strength when we're talking about this stuff.

11:01.080 --> 11:07.600
 So what does it take to go from the from I don't know what like from five hundred to

11:07.600 --> 11:09.320
 a thousand?

11:09.320 --> 11:12.920
 That feels like a journey that's like exponential.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.680
 It's it gets exponentially harder.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.680
 It does.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.960
 In the early 2000s, like I said, I started lifting in 1988.

11:19.960 --> 11:25.840
 But my first meet in the early 2000s, my my max deadlift was five twenty three and my

11:25.840 --> 11:28.560
 first squat was five hundred and fifty.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.320
 So that's the heck of a journey.

11:31.320 --> 11:35.320
 It is a journey for people that like to lift.

11:35.320 --> 11:40.160
 What should they understand about the difference between doing five hundred and a thousand in

11:40.160 --> 11:44.600
 terms of the actual lift that you were experiencing that day in terms of the mechanics, in terms

11:44.600 --> 11:47.920
 of all the things you have to be like the neurological adaptation?

11:47.920 --> 11:55.680
 You mentioned the breathing, the core strength, like techniques, like little tricks, psychological

11:55.680 --> 11:58.760
 tricks, anything that kind of stands out to you.

11:58.760 --> 12:04.700
 The level of intent and the opportunity for error are at a different level.

12:04.700 --> 12:12.200
 So just the minutest changes of position by quarter inch, half inch can be make or break

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
 at that level.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.760
 So these things, everything gets amplified.

12:15.760 --> 12:21.240
 So the ability to start with having the pelvis just in the right orientation to the diaphragm

12:21.240 --> 12:27.960
 before we start initiating what we call the the eccentric loading of the abdominal cavity

12:27.960 --> 12:32.840
 to create this intra abdominal pressure of working against this outward expansion, working

12:32.840 --> 12:40.140
 against the outer sheath of abdominal thoracolumbar musculature obliques, causing the co contraction

12:40.140 --> 12:44.320
 at the pelvic floor, all this stuff and how you cue that because you can't think about

12:44.320 --> 12:45.320
 all this stuff.

12:45.320 --> 12:49.200
 You need to break it down and distill and practice to like it's one simple cue that

12:49.200 --> 12:56.480
 we now lock down and control this torso stability because this is what these fundamental movements

12:56.480 --> 13:02.480
 are about, is being able to control our spinal mechanics and then now be able to maintain

13:02.480 --> 13:09.920
 that while articulating the joints around that through a range of motion and then using

13:09.920 --> 13:11.800
 the main power drivers.

13:11.800 --> 13:17.060
 So in this instance, both instances, it's the, you know, the hip complex to generate

13:17.060 --> 13:21.640
 that power and transfer it from how we're rooted and connected to the floor through

13:21.640 --> 13:25.920
 to the distal end, you know, which would be the barbell on the shoulder.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.000
 You know, there's a couple key concepts.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.260
 So one is that what we just talked through is how to actually maintain that stability.

13:32.260 --> 13:37.360
 So if you have either the diaphragm, so which is connected at the rib cage.

13:37.360 --> 13:44.120
 So out of alignment in any position, it needs to be in alignment with the pelvic, the pelvis.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.380
 So those two in opposition.

13:45.380 --> 13:50.680
 So this is simple engineering here because what we're going to do is eccentrically load

13:50.680 --> 13:51.680
 this.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.520
 We're going to use the diaphragm just like you would in a diaphragm pump where it's going

13:54.520 --> 13:57.220
 to press down on all the tissue in there.

13:57.220 --> 13:58.960
 So we're not using breath.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.280
 So our breath was actually a lot of times a default pattern when people do that because

14:02.280 --> 14:06.900
 they'll bring it into their chest and raise their rib cage.

14:06.900 --> 14:11.680
 So what we want to do is just initiate the diaphragm air can be used as well over the

14:11.680 --> 14:15.800
 top at the final to create just a little bit more downward pressure.

14:15.800 --> 14:22.320
 But if we have out of alignment there, we have a pressure leak where it's going to be

14:22.320 --> 14:25.960
 push out the front or the rear if you're either inflection or extension.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.240
 All right.

14:27.240 --> 14:32.920
 And then that causes this co contraction and all this pressure of the organs essentially

14:32.920 --> 14:37.040
 against outward against all those tissue for the co contraction as well as surrounding

14:37.040 --> 14:39.400
 the spine to be able to stabilize that.

14:39.400 --> 14:45.440
 And then it puts all the muscles on both sides of the body in what we call the best length

14:45.440 --> 14:47.240
 tension relationship.

14:47.240 --> 14:52.380
 So if you think about a curl and we reach our arm out at the extended length, our bicep

14:52.380 --> 14:56.280
 is not as strong and then all the way in the curl position, it's not in strong.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.160
 There's somewhere in here that's this control of both.

14:59.160 --> 15:05.280
 And so when you're sitting there arched or bent over, we have muscles that are past either

15:05.280 --> 15:06.320
 one of those ranges.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.800
 So they've got a lot of tension, which then will create relaxation on the other side.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.800
 Right.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.960
 So we want to have an all of that needs to be working.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.660
 And now the next important thing is the foot.

15:16.660 --> 15:21.780
 So it's actually this connection to the ground and how we're actually using the foot and

15:21.780 --> 15:29.240
 ankle complex to grab and grip this connection to the ground and elicit an effect.

15:29.240 --> 15:33.880
 And because of this and then the everything between will naturally kind of do what it

15:33.880 --> 15:35.200
 needs to do.

15:35.200 --> 15:40.740
 So people like to focus on it, knee position or how far out their hips are or all this

15:40.740 --> 15:44.360
 other stuff, which is outputs of this.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.280
 So if we control the torso and the knee, the only thing that can happen from that point

15:49.280 --> 15:52.400
 is for the squat to happen.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.040
 All right.

15:54.040 --> 15:59.900
 So this allows us to use this massive, you know, the hip complex for all the muscles

15:59.900 --> 16:04.880
 around that that are built to drive through hip extension to complete the squat.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.920
 I did actually miss one thing in there.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.660
 So this torso people often miss the lat is a spinal stabilizer as well.

16:11.660 --> 16:17.640
 So that's key in controlling function at the the T.L. Junction, which is just above the

16:17.640 --> 16:18.840
 lumbar spine.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.440
 So kind of right opposite where your sternum is and you'll see people kind of roll over

16:22.440 --> 16:26.120
 sometimes like an Olympic squad or something like that, where they lose position.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.600
 And that's often because they're close grip because you can't engage the lats very well

16:29.600 --> 16:31.600
 that way and they're pushing up in the bar.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.960
 But you want to be able to drive and pull the bar to your center.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.040
 And that's going to create and use the lats now to drive and connect the shoulder into

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
 this.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.900
 We're kind of compressing and tightening all this stuff towards that center to create that

16:44.900 --> 16:46.400
 entire torso stability.

16:46.400 --> 16:52.040
 So I was using torso stability, not just core stability in my conversation earlier.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.040
 Torsus.

16:53.040 --> 16:59.480
 OK, so there's all these like modules of the body then connected to the grounding with

16:59.480 --> 17:02.400
 like your feet on the ground.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.560
 Everything you're speaking to.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.440
 How do you work each of those modules?

17:06.440 --> 17:11.240
 Is this over time you kind of develop the feel that ultimately boils down to this one

17:11.240 --> 17:13.080
 simple cue that you mentioned?

17:13.080 --> 17:18.280
 Or do you can you like literally study each particular module in yourself and see how

17:18.280 --> 17:20.160
 it affects the lift?

17:20.160 --> 17:23.920
 So the best way and I believe it's because I hate just like people getting out and just

17:23.920 --> 17:29.880
 doing just movement stuff and not actually adding load because we only adapt when there's

17:29.880 --> 17:30.880
 load.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.560
 Maybe we can get some, you know, some proprioception or awareness of position and other stuff,

17:34.560 --> 17:38.640
 doing some some corrective patterns and other stuff.

17:38.640 --> 17:46.040
 But this is basic physiology is that there must be an imposed demand for us to have adaptation.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
 And this is mental.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.040
 This is emotional.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.880
 This is all these areas.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.680
 But and people miss that.

17:52.680 --> 17:59.080
 So I prefer to be able to look at a person and this is our methodology and do the assessment

17:59.080 --> 18:01.280
 in any basic loaded movement.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.780
 So with developing an eye for that, you can actually see and go, OK, we've got a fault

18:05.780 --> 18:09.600
 pattern right here in the foot and use a cue or a set of cues.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.200
 Doesn't really matter till we find the one that works and bring that.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.320
 And now we know we want to simplify this stuff.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.320
 I just walk through.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.320
 That sounds really complicated.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.600
 And it it is if we try to break down and distill it all.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.800
 But like, let's just find the basic stuff that gets us in the range, start working and

18:22.800 --> 18:25.120
 then find the next as we add load.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.640
 Now we find where's our next area that we're starting to fault that and then go there again

18:29.640 --> 18:30.640
 next.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.840
 So this is what we do, what we teach in our educational platform.

18:32.840 --> 18:39.280
 So we are the only I believe everybody wants to do a lot of these like assessments, you

18:39.280 --> 18:41.440
 know, on a bench, on a table body.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.940
 And it's like, no, let's let's go squat.

18:42.940 --> 18:43.940
 Let's go deadlift.

18:43.940 --> 18:47.200
 If you do strongman and it's a yoke carry, let's yoke carry because these are basic human

18:47.200 --> 18:48.200
 fundamentals.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.960
 It's not powerlifting like this is how we function.

18:50.960 --> 18:56.900
 This is why we we work with 29 of the 30 major league baseball teams and 90 percent of all

18:56.900 --> 18:59.560
 professional sports out there in North America.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.360
 Sorry, although we do some work with Tour de France and other stuff as well.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.760
 And North America, I do mean hockey, too.

19:06.760 --> 19:11.280
 But these principles like, you know, if if the Dodgers won't bring us in, they're not

19:11.280 --> 19:14.520
 learning how to power lift.

19:14.520 --> 19:19.120
 You know, we're going to obviously will probably be do we do a little bit more shoulder focus

19:19.120 --> 19:22.280
 than hip focus with their athletes or their coaches.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.720
 We're usually working with the coaches, not the athletes.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.120
 And so you help them.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.380
 And then the same thing on yourself to understand the role that these different muscle groups

19:29.380 --> 19:30.380
 have.

19:30.380 --> 19:31.380
 Yes.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.380
 On the holistic.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.380
 Yeah.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.840
 So it's all about getting the joints in the appropriate position so that we can do that.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.800
 We can manage load so that we're not putting undue stress on the joint.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.100
 We're getting the proper link tension.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.500
 We're getting these basic fundamental things with the body.

19:44.500 --> 19:50.560
 And so the the largest global impact that you will have is through spinal mechanics.

19:50.560 --> 19:55.160
 I can't look at a shoulder if I'm not managing this because it's your spine.

19:55.160 --> 20:00.160
 So for those who are just listening, like I'm arching and then and then flexing, that's

20:00.160 --> 20:03.080
 going to affect shoulder extension, flexion, all these sorts of things.

20:03.080 --> 20:08.280
 So it could even affect things down of what's looking at dorsiflexion issues on the foot.

20:08.280 --> 20:12.920
 And then that's why I go to the foot next, because it has the second largest global impact.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.960
 And then from there, now I'm going to look at the big energy drivers, which is the hip

20:15.960 --> 20:18.000
 complex, shoulder complex.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.120
 And then we can start looking at kind of the peripheral things.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.080
 But usually that's some sort of output of the other.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.400
 But the knees, the elbows, the things like that.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.620
 So it's all about getting the stack, which affects neurology.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.420
 So let's talk in engineering terms.

20:33.420 --> 20:36.840
 You get in a car, modern car today, and a lot of them will have this traction control

20:36.840 --> 20:37.840
 button in there.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.540
 And there's a big misconception that, you know, I'm out and it's it's snowy or here

20:42.540 --> 20:43.540
 in Austin, only rainy.

20:43.540 --> 20:46.880
 Well, it probably doesn't rain much, but you're going around a corner, start slipping.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.360
 It's like, oh, it's going to send the powers from the wheels that are slipping to the ones

20:49.360 --> 20:53.640
 that are gripping and keep me from crashing and dying a fiery death.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.680
 Well, that's not how it works.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.960
 It's the exact same.

20:56.960 --> 21:01.480
 We've got we've got the we've got the tires, which are our foot, you know, the connection

21:01.480 --> 21:02.480
 to the ground.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.480
 Right.

21:03.480 --> 21:08.880
 We've got the power driver, which is, you know, the the engine, the transmission delivering,

21:08.880 --> 21:10.560
 you know, the power through it.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.200
 And we've got the stability or suspension.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.480
 And then we have the neurology.

21:16.480 --> 21:22.840
 And what the neurology is doing, it's sensing that we don't have good stability or loss

21:22.840 --> 21:24.640
 of connection somewhere.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.940
 And so I need to save you from crashing and hurting yourself.

21:27.940 --> 21:31.560
 And so it goes to the engine and says, let's retard the timing.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.980
 Let's reduce the shift patterns.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.720
 And we're just reducing the power output.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.160
 And that's straight how the human body works.

21:38.160 --> 21:41.600
 So when I do this stuff, it's actually affecting that.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.880
 I mean, I can take somebody and do some minute changes with the neck position at the thoracic

21:45.880 --> 21:46.880
 outlet.

21:46.880 --> 21:51.280
 OK, and immediately see an enhancement in power output.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.280
 And I can measure it.

21:52.280 --> 21:58.100
 We measure this stuff with velocity devices and see like a 10 percent jump.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.840
 And so think about that.

21:59.840 --> 22:05.780
 What about all your training through the years where you actually had additional capacity?

22:05.780 --> 22:09.820
 But you weren't using it because your traction control was on.

22:09.820 --> 22:12.120
 Now you figure this out stuff and now you start stacking it.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.260
 Now you can see so much greater.

22:14.260 --> 22:17.780
 So it's not just injury prevention.

22:17.780 --> 22:22.780
 This is performance and additive performance over time.

22:22.780 --> 22:23.780
 This is huge.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.280
 And people don't really think about this stuff.

22:26.280 --> 22:31.360
 But we can turn that stuff off, which is actually going to also, again, make us make us safer.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.520
 But what we want to do is the performance tuned race car.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.880
 Do they have a traction control button?

22:35.880 --> 22:41.440
 No, they got some amazing tires to grip the ground, a performance tuned suspension, and

22:41.440 --> 22:43.920
 that driver is going to put what his foot to the metal.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.200
 He's going to put it to the floor.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.000
 OK, that's a performance vehicle.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
 That's what we want to be.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.280
 I want to continue on that line.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.120
 But first I have to ask, like, how did it feel to accomplish the grand goal?

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
 Oh, my God.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.440
 OK, when you just stand back.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.400
 Oh, my thousand pounds for reps.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.200
 What it feel like?

23:04.200 --> 23:06.400
 Anybody can go watch the video online.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.840
 It's well filmed, by the way.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.320
 Got me all like excited.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.280
 Oh, well, the movies.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.340
 So we actually have the final footage of that, the good footage not posted yet.

23:17.340 --> 23:20.760
 So it's literally just an Instagram video or a phone video right now.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.760
 The only one online.

23:21.760 --> 23:22.760
 Yeah.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.760
 It's on your YouTube channel.

23:23.760 --> 23:24.760
 It's dramatic.

23:24.760 --> 23:25.760
 Yes, it is.

23:25.760 --> 23:26.760
 Yeah.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.280
 Came out just time to the music perfectly, too, which is I listened to some odd music,

23:30.280 --> 23:31.880
 which there's some reason behind that.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.320
 OK, but I liked it, though.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.320
 It was great.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.880
 You're saying there's full length footage.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.920
 There's a documentary that's it's got a little slowed because of covid, because it's also

23:41.920 --> 23:44.400
 a backstory of the eagle and the dragon.

23:44.400 --> 23:49.880
 My book about why I do kind of the things that I've done in my life or that's what I'm

23:49.880 --> 23:51.080
 assuming the director is working on.

23:51.080 --> 23:54.800
 I don't really have the control of the movie, right?

23:54.800 --> 23:58.560
 But but OK, but the video's OK.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.560
 How did it feel?

23:59.560 --> 24:00.560
 How did it feel?

24:00.560 --> 24:01.600
 I started crying.

24:01.600 --> 24:10.400
 It was overwhelming to have worked so intensely and so long and hard at something that pushed

24:10.400 --> 24:15.200
 every ounce of me to the limit that and and I did it.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.200
 I'm sorry.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.200
 I'm getting a little emotional.

24:17.200 --> 24:23.920
 I did exactly what I said I was going to fucking do like and it was it was overpowering.

24:23.920 --> 24:31.720
 I mean, I was just crying uncontrollably just with a mixture of I.

24:31.720 --> 24:39.840
 I don't know what the mixture of emotions is hard to explain because it was the completion

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
 of something.

24:40.840 --> 24:41.840
 It was a new phase of my life.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.240
 I mean, there's so many things here.

24:45.240 --> 24:50.640
 So when you set an impossible goal and you accomplished it, one, two is like on the broader

24:50.640 --> 24:58.280
 humanity aspect, like how many humans in this world accomplish perfection in a particular

24:58.280 --> 25:01.280
 direction required to do this?

25:01.280 --> 25:09.240
 So like you're basically representing like one little like like little glimmer of excellence

25:09.240 --> 25:10.920
 of the human spirit.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.360
 There's always more.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.800
 So understand this is a basic fundamental.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.240
 You can always do better.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.080
 There is no such thing as perfection.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.160
 You could always there is always more.

25:23.160 --> 25:28.000
 So anytime you reach something, any amazing workout or accomplishment in life, could you

25:28.000 --> 25:29.080
 have put more into it?

25:29.080 --> 25:30.080
 Could you?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.080
 Yes.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.560
 But here's the thing.

25:33.560 --> 25:37.040
 I left on my terms.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.680
 I said, this is it.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.040
 I'm going to work towards I've been training for 30 years.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.920
 I'm going to do this thing that is like I couldn't even say that I was going to do it

25:45.920 --> 25:48.280
 years before.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.560
 I'm going to do it and then I'm done.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.120
 I didn't leave from an injury.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
 I wasn't forced.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.880
 I wasn't.

25:55.880 --> 25:56.880
 I left on.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.080
 I did exactly what I said.

25:58.080 --> 26:02.000
 I went to a level that I.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.400
 I left on my terms and that's unique because that's usually not the case.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.120
 Sometimes you kind of either taper out or it doesn't matter.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.840
 I'm talking like anything in life in general, right?

26:12.840 --> 26:17.560
 Like you taper out, you fail, you hurt, like you lose.

26:17.560 --> 26:22.200
 Like something, you know, you roll into retirement.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.840
 You accomplish something truly great and you walked away on your own terms.

26:25.840 --> 26:30.440
 Is there a sadness completing something like that?

26:30.440 --> 26:37.360
 Because it's in one perspective, the greatest thing you'll ever do.

26:37.360 --> 26:42.320
 And like when you accomplish such a great height, in some sense, you have to face your

26:42.320 --> 26:44.480
 mortality at that point.

26:44.480 --> 26:49.560
 So good question, but it is certainly not the greatest thing that I'll ever do.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.880
 The greatest physical street I'll ever do.

26:51.880 --> 26:55.160
 The greatest physical street, yes.

26:55.160 --> 27:01.280
 But that was an expression of some of my values and the way that I want to live.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.360
 It was a way of expressing it.

27:03.360 --> 27:11.200
 So understanding that is hugely fundamental because we do see so many athletes get to

27:11.200 --> 27:17.440
 the end of a career and then they fall into a depressive state and struggle with drugs,

27:17.440 --> 27:23.560
 alcohol, depression, and so on because they lost how they identified themselves and trying

27:23.560 --> 27:25.320
 to figure out where to turn, what to do.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.460
 But a big central component of their identity is lost.

27:29.460 --> 27:38.640
 So I knew that this was one way to express that and my grand goals have shifted.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.880
 They're shifted to other outlets that allow me to express that.

27:41.880 --> 27:48.560
 Like my companies, Kabuki Strength, I'm going to change the face of fitness as well as all

27:48.560 --> 27:52.480
 the way through with its integration with clinical medicine and telemedicine.

27:52.480 --> 27:56.400
 And I got another five years before even people see what I'm working on, five years in right

27:56.400 --> 28:00.280
 now because I had to invent equipment, I have to develop methodologies that we're talking

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
 about.

28:01.280 --> 28:06.800
 I had to do this stuff that ground layer wasn't done to create a cohesive ecosystem of training

28:06.800 --> 28:10.800
 methodology tied to the tools that we're using today, to the environment, tied to the clinical

28:10.800 --> 28:16.380
 practice assessment, tied to the interaction between all those and how that actually needs

28:16.380 --> 28:21.280
 to be reframed because so much of this is broken.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.640
 But there is sadness.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.560
 I won't deny that.

28:26.560 --> 28:35.760
 And the sadness comes in the singularity of focus that I had at that time, the being in

28:35.760 --> 28:36.760
 the process.

28:36.760 --> 28:42.280
 Not necessarily doing it, but like having being in this place that the rest of the world

28:42.280 --> 28:47.400
 kind of fell away from me in those final phases to have something so intense, to have a team

28:47.400 --> 28:52.840
 around me so focused on supporting and like it took me a couple of months after that squad.

28:52.840 --> 28:59.680
 But I finally one day I woke up and I was like, oh, welcome back to the world.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.200
 Like I was in such a mental fog.

29:02.200 --> 29:06.040
 Like I was, it took me a while to climb out of that.

29:06.040 --> 29:14.140
 But that space, that level of intensity and drive and living and being in that space,

29:14.140 --> 29:15.760
 I do miss that.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.520
 But I also, I can't continue that.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.520
 I couldn't continue.

29:18.520 --> 29:23.840
 Like there's a point of like, you push it so hard, the level to try to go from there

29:23.840 --> 29:27.540
 is not acceptable for what you, the impacts that'll have on your life or how you want

29:27.540 --> 29:28.540
 to live.

29:28.540 --> 29:32.920
 And it was taking away those final, like I had to do extreme things and live in an extreme

29:32.920 --> 29:34.720
 way to get there.

29:34.720 --> 29:41.700
 You're just a genius in this whole space of strength and health and almost like biology

29:41.700 --> 29:45.580
 that this strength feat is just one representation of that.

29:45.580 --> 29:51.920
 But this particular strength, it required that kind of singular focus, which I think,

29:51.920 --> 29:57.000
 I don't know, there's something beautiful about that singular focus that's often only

29:57.000 --> 29:59.120
 truly perfected in athletics.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.960
 I see it with the greatest Olympic athletes as well.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.520
 The kind of singular focus required there is incredible.

30:04.520 --> 30:10.320
 It's somehow some of the most beautiful things that humans can do.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.900
 And it's not just that thing.

30:11.900 --> 30:12.900
 So that's the thing.

30:12.900 --> 30:13.900
 It's like, oh, that must be it.

30:13.900 --> 30:18.680
 That singularity of focus, it's not like, here's it, because it covers a vast array

30:18.680 --> 30:19.680
 of stuff.

30:19.680 --> 30:25.880
 Like I was working with people, you know, all, well, yeah, all around North America.

30:25.880 --> 30:29.320
 I wouldn't say anybody around the globe, but professionals coming in, working on different

30:29.320 --> 30:32.800
 aspects of rehab and, and recovery.

30:32.800 --> 30:39.560
 And like, I mean, I'm tapping all sorts of stuff in so many platforms from nutrition

30:39.560 --> 30:47.120
 to drugs to, again, like, you know, various Chinese medicine, you know, as far as, you

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
 know.

30:48.120 --> 30:52.920
 But also the humans in your life, just love and positivity and just inspiration, all those

30:52.920 --> 30:53.920
 kinds of aspects.

30:53.920 --> 30:58.920
 I mean, you probably would have done much more if you went outside North America and

30:58.920 --> 31:01.480
 talked to some Russians, just between you and I.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.480
 Some Russians.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
 Possibly.

31:03.480 --> 31:08.720
 They give you some, I don't know, there's some incredible strength athletes in Eastern

31:08.720 --> 31:09.720
 Europe.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
 Absolutely.

31:10.720 --> 31:14.840
 I've got the best one coming in September to get fixed.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.100
 So what do you mean by fixed?

31:17.100 --> 31:21.880
 So I'm not sure what his particular issues are, but he has held the all time world record

31:21.880 --> 31:25.160
 repeatedly for a long time and he hasn't competed for some time.

31:25.160 --> 31:29.720
 And he just reached out saying he would like to come and have me take a look and see if

31:29.720 --> 31:32.000
 I can get him fixed because he needs to return.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
 Okay.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.320
 So it's more injury centric versus like form and a fundamental centric combination of everything.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.400
 Everybody always wants to focus on the output.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.480
 How do you give me the fix for that?

31:42.480 --> 31:47.200
 But it ties right back into all those other things, right?

31:47.200 --> 31:53.460
 But yeah, the Eastern block continued to be a dominant force in regards to athletics and

31:53.460 --> 31:56.080
 strength athletes without a doubt.

31:56.080 --> 32:01.640
 Some of my big rivals in my competitive days were, that's who it was.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.560
 Rivalry brings out the best in us.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.520
 Can you tell me the story of your childhood?

32:05.520 --> 32:07.840
 It's definitely outside the scope of the norm.

32:07.840 --> 32:15.880
 Not today, maybe not 150 or 200 years ago, but my parents, highly intelligent people

32:15.880 --> 32:18.900
 coming out of the Bay area.

32:18.900 --> 32:22.360
 My mom was going to school to be a chemical engineer.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.980
 She was a top, top student athlete, graduated out of her school.

32:25.980 --> 32:31.120
 My father was a member of Mensa and my stepfather was just a genius, but not able to really

32:31.120 --> 32:32.520
 function in society.

32:32.520 --> 32:37.640
 But my mom was, she had some demons and some other stuff and just, she just said one day,

32:37.640 --> 32:40.800
 she's like, I just don't want to be part of society.

32:40.800 --> 32:48.140
 She still isn't, lives out in the desert, but has her minds, but she wanted to figure

32:48.140 --> 32:51.360
 out a way to make a life outside of that.

32:51.360 --> 32:56.840
 And so that's where we ended up is up in the mountains in Northern California.

32:56.840 --> 33:05.060
 And a lot of that was them trying to get into successfully growing marijuana, which back

33:05.060 --> 33:08.080
 in that wasn't legal back then, highly illegal.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.800
 And in fact, those areas were, some of the areas where we lived were quite dangerous.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.760
 So there's a documentary Murder Mountain that came out recently.

33:15.760 --> 33:22.160
 If you watch that, you'll tie into my book, just the understanding of the stuff that I

33:22.160 --> 33:31.060
 was talking about dealing with serial killers, human trafficking, police corruption, murderers,

33:31.060 --> 33:35.800
 like just how real that stuff is if it doesn't capture you from the book.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.000
 The book, by the way, is the Eagle and the Dragon.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
 Yeah.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
 Thank you.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
 Yeah.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
 I'm a terrible salesperson.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
 Like I told you.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
 But a good, it's a good title.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.740
 I don't know if you came up with it, but, so yeah, we'll talk about that anyway.

33:50.740 --> 33:54.160
 We're living by a stream off a meadow.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.740
 There's no roads into where you have to hike in.

33:56.740 --> 34:00.560
 And we've got beams lashed into the trees up above us because that's where our bedding

34:00.560 --> 34:01.560
 is.

34:01.560 --> 34:07.360
 Cause there's rattlesnake dens all around and six years old, I'm being taught how to

34:07.360 --> 34:13.840
 capture and handle live rattlesnakes because that's what I need to do to be safe.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.960
 And you can imagine six years old, sitting there with a live rattlesnake in your hand,

34:16.960 --> 34:20.320
 grabbing it, you know, by the side of the head, controlling so it can't, can't bite

34:20.320 --> 34:21.320
 you.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.820
 And it's just wrapping itself around your arm and you're staring at like, it's only

34:24.820 --> 34:28.600
 intent is right then is to kill you.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.520
 Like that's it, right?

34:31.520 --> 34:32.520
 You want to take a bath.

34:32.520 --> 34:36.440
 It's filling up the jug in the stream and setting it out on the rocks during the, during

34:36.440 --> 34:37.440
 the sun.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.560
 So you dump it over your head and you know, not all the living was that way.

34:40.560 --> 34:46.120
 You know, good part was similar to that tent living, living in a 16 foot trailer with a

34:46.120 --> 34:51.840
 family of six, which is not much bigger than the space that we're sitting here.

34:51.840 --> 34:56.440
 So we're talking hard winters with feet of snow on the ground, nowhere to go.

34:56.440 --> 35:01.240
 I'm living in the back of the pickup truck and just a standard sleeping bag that we get

35:01.240 --> 35:04.120
 from the Salvation Army, not the, not the blow zero.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.400
 So I'm I'm, I'm not sleeping well.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.880
 There's living in homes that were maybe condemned.

35:10.880 --> 35:16.320
 There's no, no doors even on them, no electricity or running water or one or the other or both.

35:16.320 --> 35:21.920
 And sometimes a little bit better by the time we got to high school we had a mobile home.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.800
 So my stepfather had won a disability payment cause he had a broken arm that whole time

35:25.800 --> 35:31.640
 from a accident a long time ago and finally got an award and got a down payment on this

35:31.640 --> 35:35.120
 mobile home that didn't have again, doors on the inside.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.840
 It did have running water, did have electricity, didn't have a kitchen, you know, the windows

35:38.840 --> 35:42.080
 would crank close and open, but they wouldn't close all the way.

35:42.080 --> 35:47.680
 So the trim them in with a plastic to be able to try to protect from the elements.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.440
 That was my environment, like learning how to forge for mushrooms.

35:51.440 --> 35:55.160
 I mean, there were summers I would send and my parents would be out, they were in the

35:55.160 --> 35:56.240
 drug trade earlier.

35:56.240 --> 36:05.600
 We got taken by the, by the police and put into foster care for a while, which ties into

36:05.600 --> 36:07.720
 some of the stories with human trafficking.

36:07.720 --> 36:15.480
 And honestly it's in my book, but it's really hard for me to talk about that stuff and obviously

36:15.480 --> 36:16.720
 not all that's in the book.

36:16.720 --> 36:22.480
 So but they got us back and we moved to Oregon and they stayed out of the drug trade from

36:22.480 --> 36:28.000
 that time to ensure that they didn't lose us again, but quickly we kind of fell back

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
 into the same thing.

36:29.000 --> 36:36.820
 So at that point it was learning about geology and starting to do mining and firewood cutting,

36:36.820 --> 36:40.660
 but mostly the mining because Pat's broken arm chainsaw made a little tough.

36:40.660 --> 36:47.020
 If you remember just the sequence of moments, do you, are you haunted by the darker moments

36:47.020 --> 36:48.280
 of your childhood?

36:48.280 --> 36:53.840
 Do you remember moments of simple joy and happiness?

36:53.840 --> 37:00.200
 Outside of the living around dangerous people and the interactions that came from that,

37:00.200 --> 37:01.760
 we were a family.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.040
 Like we were a cohesive unit battling against the world together.

37:05.040 --> 37:09.680
 We spent all our time together, work, play.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.680
 I was there.

37:10.680 --> 37:17.160
 I was helping raise my, my siblings or I was working with them and you know, it was a constant,

37:17.160 --> 37:18.960
 like I said, we were very physically active.

37:18.960 --> 37:24.080
 So you know, I had that in my upbringing, um, that plug for my shoe company, barefoot,

37:24.080 --> 37:29.920
 B E A R I ran around the wilderness and bare feet all the time, you know, but it was, I

37:29.920 --> 37:35.360
 had a lot of great moments and I'm thankful for a lot of that childhood once we take out

37:35.360 --> 37:39.760
 the trauma and the other stuff associated with it, right?

37:39.760 --> 37:45.680
 And so the connection that I have with my sisters, um, is, is, is huge.

37:45.680 --> 37:50.040
 Um, that goes a bit further to cause I am kind of like a, a little bit of a father figure

37:50.040 --> 37:54.640
 because I was at home raising them and then later I took custody of them, uh, while I

37:54.640 --> 37:58.000
 was going to school because the environment at home deteriorated further.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.440
 Their stepfather, stepfather, like I said, was, he wasn't capable of managing life.

38:03.440 --> 38:08.120
 And uh, my mom had a mental breakdown and took off to Montana and he descended into

38:08.120 --> 38:13.880
 madness even worse, uh, actually took my, my 13 year old sister and kicked her out in

38:13.880 --> 38:17.280
 the middle of winter, a couple of feet of snow on the ground because he thought she

38:17.280 --> 38:21.740
 stole his favorite cereal bowl, um, type.

38:21.740 --> 38:26.320
 So that's when I took in and I was going to college, putting myself through college and

38:26.320 --> 38:28.520
 I started taking custody of my sisters and raising them.

38:28.520 --> 38:34.080
 So anyway, we're still like very, very tight family.

38:34.080 --> 38:40.040
 Um, it took, there was a few years later in life, like that the connection with my mother

38:40.040 --> 38:41.640
 was kind of broken.

38:41.640 --> 38:46.960
 Um, I didn't speak to her for years because of her basically abandoning my sisters and

38:46.960 --> 38:47.960
 me having to come in.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.000
 But that we've worked through that as best we can.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.240
 So you anger on your part?

38:53.240 --> 38:56.480
 It wasn't, there might've been some anger.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
 Um.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
 Did you always love her?

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
 Yes.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.480
 And I still do.

39:00.480 --> 39:07.580
 And I'm so, she's taught me basically everything I know about strength and perseverance and

39:07.580 --> 39:11.780
 living life on your terms and being able to create that.

39:11.780 --> 39:16.240
 And so much of what I am is from that, right?

39:16.240 --> 39:24.340
 We've all had to learn to be okay with the way she is because she is just blunt, but

39:24.340 --> 39:31.720
 you know, she's the one that figured out that the human trafficking situation and got, uh,

39:31.720 --> 39:41.040
 got the da involved and got all the, she's the one that I've learned a lot from her.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
 And uh.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.760
 Did you inherit some of the demons?

39:43.760 --> 39:45.960
 Oh, most certainly.

39:45.960 --> 39:52.260
 And I, it's something I've continued like in my father's side of has been really tough

39:52.260 --> 39:55.700
 on that because some of it is just based genetic as well.

39:55.700 --> 40:01.960
 So my, my stepfather made I think six or seven attempts on his life during his lifetime.

40:01.960 --> 40:07.120
 One of those in front of me, uh, his mother blew her head off with a shotgun.

40:07.120 --> 40:13.080
 Uh, her brother jumped out a window in LA, uh, their father did something similar and

40:13.080 --> 40:18.480
 I don't know how far back it goes because there is no family except for me and my children.

40:18.480 --> 40:22.120
 You spoke about going through depression yourself.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.240
 Yeah.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.440
 Can you, um, talk about some of the darker moments of that?

40:26.440 --> 40:31.800
 Have you ever like many in your family, have you ever considered suicide?

40:31.800 --> 40:33.680
 Yes I have.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.720
 Yes I have.

40:35.720 --> 40:39.660
 You've achieved a lot of exceptional things in your life.

40:39.660 --> 40:45.120
 Can you talk about those early days of depression and how you overcame it?

40:45.120 --> 40:46.660
 Yeah.

40:46.660 --> 40:52.520
 So the things that I did that people give me accolades for are the things that I did

40:52.520 --> 40:55.460
 selfishly to save myself.

40:55.460 --> 41:03.960
 The things like taking custody of my sisters, being the person that everybody around, you

41:03.960 --> 41:09.040
 know, the, the important people relied on the fact that I had to step to the plate and

41:09.040 --> 41:18.220
 be present and be that person because if I failed, they failed.

41:18.220 --> 41:26.600
 They would be like the people that I grew up with that are dead or in prison or on drugs

41:26.600 --> 41:30.120
 and they're either way to one of those, right?

41:30.120 --> 41:33.980
 That's where everybody ended and I wasn't going to let that happen.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.760
 What about saving yourself?

41:35.760 --> 41:39.520
 And so that's how in those early days, that's how I did it.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.080
 Not saying it's the best approach, but it was survivor mentality.

41:42.080 --> 41:49.680
 It was, I can't selfishly do that because I have them to take care of, right?

41:49.680 --> 41:53.560
 And then that continued where I would keep putting myself in these leadership roles or

41:53.560 --> 42:02.800
 other things and just always being this person that was at the center, at the hub that forced

42:02.800 --> 42:04.040
 me to be there.

42:04.040 --> 42:10.680
 And so it's only in the more recent, you know, last decade or so that I have had to really

42:10.680 --> 42:17.080
 learn how to come and start confronting some of those demons and think, man, why is the

42:17.080 --> 42:18.080
 guy so successful?

42:18.080 --> 42:23.360
 Like, I mean, and we haven't talked about all the stuff that I've done, but like I've

42:23.360 --> 42:32.840
 seen a lot of success in both business, leadership, athletics, academics, entrepreneurship, all

42:32.840 --> 42:34.520
 these sorts of things, right?

42:34.520 --> 42:42.880
 But if it wasn't for having kids and the same being in the position, I wouldn't be here.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.720
 And that's just, that's the reality of it.

42:45.720 --> 42:51.400
 And I'm learning to come and manage those as best I can.

42:51.400 --> 42:56.320
 Learning to meditate into those things and really feel what the driver is so I can get

42:56.320 --> 43:01.360
 to those root understanding and having some guidance doing so.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.000
 Like if you've got mental health issues, this isn't something that you need to tackle on

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
 your own.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.680
 Like having a professional that can help guide you on that introspective journey is something

43:11.680 --> 43:14.920
 like, it's not like, hey, I'm big, tough guy.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.680
 I can handle everything.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.680
 You know?

43:18.680 --> 43:23.120
 That's fascinating that you saved yourself.

43:23.120 --> 43:28.480
 That's quite powerful to save yourself by having others depend on you.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.660
 And so you can't fail.

43:30.660 --> 43:32.280
 You can't fuck it up.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.960
 And that's a reason to keep moving forward.

43:35.960 --> 43:40.440
 But on the flip side, that's not addressing the darkness.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.120
 It's not.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.460
 And it probably not a sustainable strategy either, right?

43:45.460 --> 43:47.360
 So I recognize these things.

43:47.360 --> 43:50.320
 I don't know.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.580
 Perhaps it is sustainable.

43:51.580 --> 43:57.720
 Perhaps that, I mean, there's something beautiful about giving yourself basically in service

43:57.720 --> 44:02.840
 of others and thereby creating purpose.

44:02.840 --> 44:07.100
 And then it's almost like fake it till you make it and then you make it eventually.

44:07.100 --> 44:09.140
 That is purpose though.

44:09.140 --> 44:10.140
 That is purpose.

44:10.140 --> 44:17.120
 I mean, you have to, to me, life is about taking your cup and how you choose to pour

44:17.120 --> 44:18.120
 it out.

44:18.120 --> 44:19.380
 How you choose to give.

44:19.380 --> 44:20.880
 What is your purpose?

44:20.880 --> 44:23.080
 What is that connection with everybody around you?

44:23.080 --> 44:26.380
 This is, that's the intent.

44:26.380 --> 44:27.380
 That's the life.

44:27.380 --> 44:28.760
 That's what life is about.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.040
 How are you going to help those around you?

44:31.040 --> 44:32.520
 How are you going to help the world?

44:32.520 --> 44:37.680
 Your purpose is right here, figuring out what this is and then how to do that.

44:37.680 --> 44:40.520
 But at the same time, you can't let that run dry.

44:40.520 --> 44:44.320
 So you have to make sure that you're filling that up.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.560
 That's the other side, right?

44:46.560 --> 44:47.560
 That's the other side.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.560
 Yeah.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.800
 We'll return to your engineering degree, which you're obviously scientifically engineering

44:52.800 --> 44:55.360
 minded, which is fascinating.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.880
 Your book is titled the Eagle and the Dragon.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.320
 What do the Eagle and the Dragon symbolize?

45:02.320 --> 45:03.840
 They're pretty big symbols for me.

45:03.840 --> 45:07.520
 In fact, that covers my entire body as a tattoo.

45:07.520 --> 45:11.320
 So the first one I had done at around 19 years old.

45:11.320 --> 45:14.200
 And so this is, or started at 19.

45:14.200 --> 45:21.040
 It's an eagle that covers my entire front, you know, my stomach, rib cage, and one that

45:21.040 --> 45:23.000
 was on my back that covered most of my back.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.080
 And there's chained at the, well, at the claw, I guess.

45:29.080 --> 45:33.640
 And the chain wraps down around and attaches to my ankle and there's a shackle there.

45:33.640 --> 45:37.760
 And so this was something that I had done at that age because it was, to me, it was

45:37.760 --> 45:46.120
 a representation of your potential, your strengths, your abilities that you can fly to whatever

45:46.120 --> 45:48.680
 height that you want in this world.

45:48.680 --> 45:53.340
 The only thing holding you back at the end of the day is yourself.

45:53.340 --> 45:57.400
 And this was, I hadn't necessarily accomplished a whole lot at that time.

45:57.400 --> 46:02.080
 I mean, I was valedictorian for high school, small high school.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
 Does that even count?

46:03.080 --> 46:06.840
 I was a state level wrestler.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.960
 This was my belief.

46:08.960 --> 46:13.280
 And you sense that there was a potential in you and the only thing that could stop you

46:13.280 --> 46:15.640
 from realizing that potential was yourself.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.640
 That's right.

46:16.640 --> 46:24.320
 That's a heck of a tattoo to get, by the way, at 19, but 40 hours went into that thing.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.400
 It shows you got some guts.

46:26.400 --> 46:38.720
 And then the next tattoo, so I only have two, I had done in 2015, 2016 when I, so at this

46:38.720 --> 46:41.120
 point in my life, so I had done that.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.640
 I had flown to whatever heights, right?

46:42.640 --> 46:50.160
 So I had, I had proven to myself and maybe done what I thought I needed to do to show

46:50.160 --> 46:56.060
 the world that this poor kid from the sticks, this kid growing up in the mountains with

46:56.060 --> 46:59.280
 nothing could achieve the American dream.

46:59.280 --> 47:05.960
 I was a corporate executive sought after that I'd come in, I'd fix companies, I'd turn around

47:05.960 --> 47:07.320
 and prep them for sale.

47:07.320 --> 47:11.500
 I'd take a company and grow it from a regional to a national to a global presence.

47:11.500 --> 47:16.400
 I did this in the automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, high tech, heavy

47:16.400 --> 47:21.440
 industry and I had a house with a white picket fence.

47:21.440 --> 47:25.160
 I was a successful athlete with all time world records.

47:25.160 --> 47:33.040
 I owned a gym on the side where I coached people and I had a comfortable marriage that

47:33.040 --> 47:40.880
 everything was hunky dory with no arguments at home and I walked away from all of it.

47:40.880 --> 47:45.160
 I left everything behind except for my kids.

47:45.160 --> 47:56.320
 I wanted to chase what I was meant to do and chase what I was capable of doing.

47:56.320 --> 48:06.620
 I wanted to become a better version of myself, but very intentfully and that's what I did.

48:06.620 --> 48:11.920
 I sold, I had multiple homes, sold my homes.

48:11.920 --> 48:19.480
 I cashed in all my retirement that I'd earned for 20, nearly 20 years and I lost all that.

48:19.480 --> 48:25.160
 I leveraged myself millions of dollars of personal debt so that if I failed, there was

48:25.160 --> 48:26.160
 no way out.

48:26.160 --> 48:30.440
 Even going back to that old career that I did well, I'd be living in an apartment the

48:30.440 --> 48:33.520
 rest of my life paying it off.

48:33.520 --> 48:38.600
 Old question, people questioned me at the time because I had a comfortable, easy marriage

48:38.600 --> 48:45.560
 and I chose to ask for a divorce and I ended up living in an apartment for a couple of

48:45.560 --> 48:51.200
 years with no income, selling off every last thing that I had except for my two vehicles

48:51.200 --> 49:01.000
 that I built and with my kids and I started my businesses to help people live a better

49:01.000 --> 49:06.800
 quality of life, to get them out of pain, to help them live better through strength,

49:06.800 --> 49:14.200
 to realize that stress, demand, those things, they don't have to be the thing that if you

49:14.200 --> 49:18.200
 look back, made you had the bad back, made you have the bad deeds, but they do the opposite.

49:18.200 --> 49:23.000
 They get you out of pain and then I started working my book to hit on those other things,

49:23.000 --> 49:28.120
 the mental, the emotional, maybe even spiritual, I don't touch on that one too much in there,

49:28.120 --> 49:35.960
 but it's all the same, that things that happen around you, to you, like maybe they're bad,

49:35.960 --> 49:41.000
 I can't take away that, but why can't you use what you have of it to become a stronger

49:41.000 --> 49:45.720
 and better person, to become more resilient, to be able to take the things that you don't

49:45.720 --> 49:50.080
 know that are coming in the future and so this is very intentful and that's what the

49:50.080 --> 49:52.880
 second long winded answer in your question here.

49:52.880 --> 49:53.880
 The dragon.

49:53.880 --> 49:54.880
 The dragon.

49:54.880 --> 50:00.240
 The dragon is an Ouroboros and so it is, it circles my entire upper body, my shoulders,

50:00.240 --> 50:04.640
 my back, my chest, everything, it's right here, there's this big dragon head and its

50:04.640 --> 50:11.040
 tail is right there in its mouth that's eating itself and it may sound a bit graphic or whatever,

50:11.040 --> 50:17.560
 but it is, it's the eating of the old becoming the new, it is the purposeful reinvention

50:17.560 --> 50:23.900
 of oneself, it is the deciding, not realizing just your potential, but deciding specifically

50:23.900 --> 50:29.360
 who you want to be in this fucking world and becoming that person.

50:29.360 --> 50:39.520
 Can you comment on the value and the power of putting a flame to your old life, your

50:39.520 --> 50:47.120
 old self, just destroying all of it as you walk into the new life, did you have to do

50:47.120 --> 50:48.120
 that?

50:48.120 --> 50:53.040
 I don't recommend this, by the way, because when you put yourself in no way out, there

50:53.040 --> 50:57.480
 is no way out, okay?

50:57.480 --> 51:07.720
 You got to really, but I can be an overconfident individual at times and I live through extremes.

51:07.720 --> 51:13.880
 I think it's a great way of actually finding your real values and how you want to live,

51:13.880 --> 51:20.280
 honestly, to chase having absolutely perfect squat technique, but chase putting every freaking

51:20.280 --> 51:24.880
 thing that you've got in it, which most people would say, those are opposite, those are diametrically

51:24.880 --> 51:27.080
 opposed.

51:27.080 --> 51:36.040
 I wanted a better home life, I wanted to do more in the world through my work and the

51:36.040 --> 51:41.640
 burning the bridges mentality is not necessarily the best.

51:41.640 --> 51:47.320
 There was some temperament in that though, because I was slow to make the shift for a

51:47.320 --> 51:51.320
 long time because I'd been thinking about doing it, but I was thinking about doing it

51:51.320 --> 51:52.320
 in a healthcare perspective.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.820
 I'm going to go back to school to be a surgeon or a physical therapist or a Cairo because

51:55.820 --> 52:02.120
 that's where all my research and stuff was in this human movement and rehab and recovery.

52:02.120 --> 52:06.800
 This is the mentors that I've been developing were the best in the world in these things,

52:06.800 --> 52:15.040
 in these disciplines, those were my friends, but I wasn't able to compromise my family's

52:15.040 --> 52:16.040
 certain quality of life.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.040
 I wanted to keep that.

52:17.040 --> 52:22.480
 So it was slow and hard for me to make that transition, but I didn't do it until I had

52:22.480 --> 52:26.960
 a platform built enough that those first few years I did have an income, I was able to

52:26.960 --> 52:31.440
 make enough from the business until it grew so fast that I needed so much more needed

52:31.440 --> 52:32.440
 to come in.

52:32.440 --> 52:36.560
 The living in the apartment piece and doing all that, that was actually a couple of years

52:36.560 --> 52:39.160
 into that process, maybe like two years.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.160
 I'm with you on that.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.200
 So I'm actually going through that very process now.

52:44.200 --> 52:51.200
 I put everything, I quit everything, gave away everything and starting a new and unfortunately

52:51.200 --> 52:57.000
 or fortunately this podcast somehow became quite popular.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.520
 So it's getting in the way of my burning everything to the ground.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.980
 But in that it's a source of joy.

53:03.980 --> 53:10.000
 But the main thing I'm after is the similar project as you is building a business sense

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
 of joy.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.880
 So this, this is the point I want to drive home right now, right now.

53:15.880 --> 53:21.840
 Because when I say burn, I learned that burning the bridges works because that's how I had

53:21.840 --> 53:23.800
 to succeed when I was earlier.

53:23.800 --> 53:24.800
 The bridges weren't burnt.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.120
 They didn't exist.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.760
 There was no couch to go home to.

53:27.760 --> 53:31.960
 There was no, there was no fall back plan and it forced me and gave me the confidence

53:31.960 --> 53:34.760
 to know that I can pull it off.

53:34.760 --> 53:39.640
 But I don't encourage people because there's so much out there of this hustle porn and

53:39.640 --> 53:44.320
 other stuff going just grind, just go after it, get in and start your, like you'll get

53:44.320 --> 53:49.200
 there and it's all about the output to make money, to be somebody, to do this.

53:49.200 --> 53:52.840
 And I'll tell you what, that is some short term motivation right there.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.560
 I feel like dropping a few swear words, but

53:54.560 --> 53:57.560
 You're always welcome.

53:57.560 --> 54:03.520
 We've already done a few, so we'll bounce it out.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.920
 That is short term.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.920
 That is not going to keep you going.

54:06.920 --> 54:11.760
 This need, if you're going to go that approach, it needs to be because this is your North

54:11.760 --> 54:12.760
 star.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.460
 There's going to be so much hard work.

54:14.460 --> 54:19.240
 There's going to be years of just pushing through where your question, not only is everybody

54:19.240 --> 54:23.000
 around you questioning you and your family's questioning you, you're questioning yourself

54:23.000 --> 54:25.680
 going, man, I don't know if I can pull this off.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.680
 You're going to be stressed.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.200
 You're going to be pulled to the max.

54:28.200 --> 54:30.840
 If somebody comes up to me and says, should I start a business?

54:30.840 --> 54:34.320
 I'm going to say no.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.160
 And oh, you're supposed to motivate me.

54:36.160 --> 54:39.560
 If you need me to motivate you, this is the wrong damn approach for you.

54:39.560 --> 54:40.560
 This is going to be hard.

54:40.560 --> 54:45.500
 This is going to be harder than you expect, even with me telling you this.

54:45.500 --> 54:49.880
 And so it better damn well be worth it.

54:49.880 --> 54:52.080
 This better be your North fucking star.

54:52.080 --> 54:59.440
 This better live and be a way for you to be able to articulate or realize those values

54:59.440 --> 55:01.960
 that you want to live.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.300
 This isn't something to make money.

55:04.300 --> 55:09.640
 This is a way for you to live the life and be able to share the values that you have

55:09.640 --> 55:11.520
 with the world.

55:11.520 --> 55:12.520
 And that's what it is.

55:12.520 --> 55:20.520
 And if you don't have that, which is going to give you joy, then we can walk away.

55:20.520 --> 55:23.000
 This is not some way to make some money and be known.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.880
 I mean, this, this includes both like simple day to day joy and also deep meaning the whole

55:29.880 --> 55:30.880
 thing.

55:30.880 --> 55:34.320
 It allows you to overcome all the, all the pain along the way.

55:34.320 --> 55:40.400
 But I got to say, I mean, it's a difficult thing because you run a business.

55:40.400 --> 55:46.560
 This podcast and a lot of things I do research wise is full of joy, but it's simple.

55:46.560 --> 55:51.120
 Running a business is hard.

55:51.120 --> 55:58.520
 So it's something that I'm very hesitant about in that to almost push back a little bit.

55:58.520 --> 56:06.920
 I think if I do get the guts to start the business, it will not be because I'm not choosing

56:06.920 --> 56:11.360
 a more joyful life because I'm already truly happy.

56:11.360 --> 56:14.640
 The reason I'll choose is because I just can't help it.

56:14.640 --> 56:19.920
 There's this, I've always had this dream and I know it's going to lead to suffering and

56:19.920 --> 56:24.480
 I know it's going to be a life that has less happiness in it.

56:24.480 --> 56:32.200
 As sad as this to say, but it won't be, it won't be less happiness because we talk about

56:32.200 --> 56:36.340
 this cup and where you choose to pour it and what you choose to do with it.

56:36.340 --> 56:41.000
 And when you look back on things, the things that are going to give you the most joy, the

56:41.000 --> 56:45.360
 most proud, the things that are going to stand out in your life that you really remember

56:45.360 --> 56:51.180
 are going to be those days and your, those years you struggle, you're going to look back

56:51.180 --> 56:57.480
 on 10 years later and go, fuck, those were the glory days.

56:57.480 --> 56:59.920
 Those were the glory days.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.720
 And it won't feel like it at the time.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.820
 So that's what life's made of.

57:04.820 --> 57:07.120
 And so this is your, this is your opportunity.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.120
 You feel that.

57:08.120 --> 57:11.920
 So right now you've got this, when you think about it, you've got this little thing twisting

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
 up in your gut, right?

57:12.920 --> 57:19.840
 It's like, it's a mixture of anxiety and fear as well as excitement in that is that's your

57:19.840 --> 57:24.120
 signal that this is your opportunity for that personal growth, the challenge yourself.

57:24.120 --> 57:27.080
 This is your going for a run or working out in the heat.

57:27.080 --> 57:29.080
 It's it's those things.

57:29.080 --> 57:32.380
 It is your opportunity to go back.

57:32.380 --> 57:33.860
 Maybe it even fails.

57:33.860 --> 57:39.600
 Maybe it even fails, but by turning into that, you're going to learn so much and it's going

57:39.600 --> 57:41.760
 to make you so much better.

57:41.760 --> 57:47.320
 And it's the path that you should take when you have this stuff rolling around in there.

57:47.320 --> 57:53.080
 And I don't, it could just be a hard conversation with your partner or your boss.

57:53.080 --> 57:59.680
 It could be taking on a project that, you know, you know, that your boss has thrown

57:59.680 --> 58:01.600
 out to the team and you're like, Oh, I'm going to hide in the back.

58:01.600 --> 58:02.600
 I don't want that one.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.800
 And it's like, maybe, maybe you do.

58:05.800 --> 58:08.400
 Maybe it's going back to school.

58:08.400 --> 58:11.800
 Maybe it's making that career move that you always wanted, but you're just a, you're just

58:11.800 --> 58:16.360
 afraid of all these things.

58:16.360 --> 58:21.520
 Those are your opportunity for you to turn into that.

58:21.520 --> 58:22.520
 It is your workout.

58:22.520 --> 58:28.000
 It is your practice because if you don't, you'll get soft and who knows what's coming

58:28.000 --> 58:30.120
 and you're not going to be ready for it.

58:30.120 --> 58:35.120
 And it's going to run right over the top of you because you're going to be weak.

58:35.120 --> 58:37.200
 You're going to be soft.

58:37.200 --> 58:42.440
 There's some aspect in which choosing that hard path is actually the, the way to arrive

58:42.440 --> 58:48.060
 at the richest kind of happiness, the greatest fulfillment.

58:48.060 --> 58:50.040
 That's the funny thing about just the human.

58:50.040 --> 58:53.120
 Just make sure you're filling the cup as you're going through it and not pouring it all out.

58:53.120 --> 58:56.200
 So that's the part to figure out, right?

58:56.200 --> 58:57.200
 Sure.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.960
 Well, life is short anyway.

58:58.960 --> 59:03.440
 Eventually, eventually the cup will be empty.

59:03.440 --> 59:09.920
 So maybe time the refilling of the cup correctly so you maximize the little time you got.

59:09.920 --> 59:15.040
 Let me talk to you about strength a little bit first, high level.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.320
 What are the differences in the different disciplines of strength?

59:17.320 --> 59:22.680
 So power lifting, we talked about maybe just to clarify for people, power lifting, Olympic

59:22.680 --> 59:29.920
 lifting, just regular gym fitness, bodybuilding, doing curls in front of the mirror for hours

59:29.920 --> 59:30.920
 like I do.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.920
 What's, what's the difference between all of these?

59:32.920 --> 59:35.200
 Oh, and also strong man.

59:35.200 --> 59:42.080
 Every one of those, as far as the athletic disciplines are different qualities.

59:42.080 --> 59:45.040
 So we want to think about things as terms of quality.

59:45.040 --> 59:53.920
 So there's strength, there's power, there's endurance, there's the ability to be coordinated

59:53.920 --> 59:55.120
 and athletic.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.180
 There's all these things and they're different, they're different qualities.

59:58.180 --> 1:00:05.600
 So your training as it relates to that is how you cycle in the development of those qualities.

1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:09.720
 What we want to think about is there's a lot of different frames of thought, some very

1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:14.040
 classical, maybe not classical Russian approach because there's a lot of different approach

1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:19.140
 from the Eastern block, but one of the ones is developing all the qualities at once, focusing

1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:26.480
 on building those more of a periodization effect would be focusing on one quality at

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:32.220
 a time or one quality while maintaining other qualities and then shifting that around.

1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:37.120
 So it's just going to be a little different based on what the output is and what the desired.

1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:40.640
 So like powerlifting is actually, power is the wrong word.

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.080
 There's actually no power in it.

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:48.600
 It's just brute, it's, it's strength, um, application of force, um, Olympic lifting

1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:55.000
 would actually be a better name for powerlifting because that is more explosive development.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000
 There's um, strongman is again, now we're getting a little bit more athletic.

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.360
 It's equipment based on the implements and stuff that are used, how fast you can move

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.980
 your feet and run mixed with more endurance, but still very strength focused.

1:01:09.980 --> 1:01:11.600
 And there's some things with strongman that is straight.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:18.100
 Like each one of these is very also focused on different genetic dispositions.

1:01:18.100 --> 1:01:21.840
 So actually if you look at the history of sports, you'll find that they're a lot of

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:27.400
 times based on different populations and it sounds like it's very unPC, but like a Highland

1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:31.260
 games, um, they've got deep, deeper hip sockets that are shallow.

1:01:31.260 --> 1:01:35.200
 So you're going to see a lot of short hip hinge movements like the, the caber toss and

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.360
 things like that.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.240
 Muay Thai wrestling, they've got a completely different hip joint.

1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:43.780
 And so strongman itself is going to be for very large frame individuals.

1:01:43.780 --> 1:01:47.800
 If you're not well over six foot and a large person, you're probably not going to perform

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:48.800
 well.

1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:54.200
 It's sub six foot have ever done well at strongman just because it's, it's leverage based, right?

1:01:54.200 --> 1:02:01.560
 Um, Olympic lifting, we see consistently in, in Europe, uh, the, the history tells us a

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:09.200
 high level of hip, uh, and back issues because of the depth that that hip socket has to go

1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:11.780
 in to be able to complete that lift.

1:02:11.780 --> 1:02:15.920
 And so you're going to see issues with populations that don't have the ability to do that.

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:20.280
 So, so we've talked a little bit about training as well as disposition.

1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:21.280
 Yeah.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:26.160
 So, and also cross head fits into that, that's more like strongman, but for a wider variety

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:27.440
 of bodies, I suppose.

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:28.440
 Yep.

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:32.000
 And definitely more metabolic conditioning focus than the, than the strength aspect of

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.000
 it.

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.600
 Um, and, and, and conditioning is an interesting thing too.

1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:42.980
 So that quality in my opinion can be developed a lot faster, but kind of peaks much faster

1:02:42.980 --> 1:02:43.980
 as well.

1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:48.920
 Um, where strength, we can continue to add and add and add over time.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:54.040
 Uh, so it's for me, like for conditioning with any strength athlete, I don't like to

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:56.080
 spend as much time on that.

1:02:56.080 --> 1:03:01.720
 So I'll cycle, uh, the conditioning work for our strength athletes and then taper that

1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:02.860
 off leading into meat.

1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:07.240
 So the more metabolic work, that means the more capacity in strength training that you

1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:12.340
 can accomplish, which is the goal, um, and recover from.

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:16.800
 But then as we lead to a competition, we want to spend more time on recovering from that.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:17.800
 So we have to pull things out.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:18.800
 So we'd pull out less.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:25.880
 So like a typical approach would be like taking a six week cycle for conditioning and ramping,

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:30.120
 ramping up over three weeks periods time, then dropping back down again and ramping

1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:34.680
 up and being slightly offset by like a week or two from your strength peaks so that you've

1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.320
 actually tapered the week prior in your conditioning work to your strength work.

1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:39.320
 Right.

1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:43.800
 So we're not hitting conditioning hard all the time, which is a common, common, uh, misstep

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:46.040
 that people make is going, well, I need conditioning.

1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:52.160
 So they just hammer that at a base level over the top instead of cycling that.

1:03:52.160 --> 1:04:01.280
 If we talk about powerlifting in terms of regimen, in terms of exercise, in terms of

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:06.440
 the process, the wood consistent with what, is there something to be said about general

1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:10.360
 qualities of the consistency of the regimen required to get strong?

1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:11.360
 Yes.

1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:16.400
 So let's talk about some training principles as a whole.

1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:22.080
 And this will, I think this will break down what you're, what you're one, the more work

1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:28.000
 that we can fit into a given time, the more progress we're going to make.

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:34.560
 But that doesn't mean doing the max amount of work possible at any given time.

1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:39.720
 So we know that we're always to, to, to accomplish more, we're always going to have more.

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:42.440
 And there's a certain ceiling that you're going to hit that you're not going to be able

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:43.440
 to add more.

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:47.920
 So you want to start and get the most amount of results that you can with the least amount

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:54.160
 of work, because you're going to have to do it again, like this stair step over and over

1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:56.600
 year, decade, so on.

1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:01.720
 So when people is a big miss, people got, they look at a Chico program from Russia or

1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:05.120
 so on and they go, I'm going to follow this.

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:09.800
 It's like that was specifically written for somebody with 20 years of experience that's

1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:12.280
 already built the capacities to be at that level.

1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:14.220
 So it's all about building that work capacity.

1:05:14.220 --> 1:05:15.800
 So how much work can you give in a given time?

1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:21.500
 So now we want to look at some research is it relates to injuries because injuries are

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:25.960
 going to be a big driver over time of what holds you back.

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:32.760
 So when we talk consistency, training hard for three years, five years, it's going to

1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:33.760
 be really good.

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:37.560
 But what we find is a lot of people train really hard for nine months, have to slow

1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:41.480
 back for a month, get back into it and miss another week because, and so on.

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:44.440
 They're always like this little nagging, that little nagging.

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:49.240
 And so it's pretty clear in the research we want to, we're looking at when we're stair

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:54.040
 stepping this stuff, we're looking at acute and chronic loading.

1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:59.240
 So some fancy words for average and like what's happening right now.

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:04.000
 So this given week would be our acute, chronic would be what is our average loading let's

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:07.000
 say over the last six months.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.720
 So the more that we can move the chronic loading up, the more work we're getting done on as

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:14.560
 a whole over time, we're going to get stronger.

1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:20.760
 The way that we build the capacity to do that is having spikes in acute loading.

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:31.120
 Now as we do this, the, the acute loading, if it spikes more than 10, maybe 15% from

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:39.320
 what the chronic loading has been, that accounts for 80% of injuries out there.

1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:44.800
 So it's not actually the movement quality or this misstep or the other may usually happens

1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:48.840
 about four or five, six weeks later, it's like, Oh, this nagging and then it gets worse.

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:52.240
 And then now you got to, you got to do some rehab, your training sessions aren't as good

1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:53.420
 and so on.

1:06:53.420 --> 1:06:54.640
 So now we're starting to look at this.

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:55.640
 Okay.

1:06:55.640 --> 1:06:59.160
 It's like, I want to do the, I want to do the least amount of work where I can still

1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:00.800
 progress.

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:09.320
 I want to be able to have spikes in my weekly demand that don't go above 10 to 15% of what

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.320
 I've been averaging for the last month.

1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:14.760
 But every time I do a spike, my, my average goes up, right?

1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:16.760
 Boom, boom, boom.

1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:20.880
 And then that becomes very particular also when you take, when you do take plantain time

1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:21.880
 off.

1:07:21.880 --> 1:07:25.600
 So a lot of people, uh, training session, maybe they're doing a five week block with

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:31.480
 a, uh, a deload week or you go on vacation for a week or any of those things that were

1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:32.600
 a downward.

1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:34.400
 What does that do to your average and chronic loading?

1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:35.400
 It brings it down.

1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:39.200
 And then what does the person want to do when they come back, make up for it.

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:43.640
 Now they have a huge spike above five weeks later, we're dealing with all this elbow,

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:47.760
 this wrist, whatever's kind of bothering me and now you're not performing as much.

1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:52.240
 So these are some really fundamental pieces of, of, of, of training.

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:56.360
 And then now we can start overlaying the qualities that we're trying to develop that we were

1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:57.360
 talking about earlier.

1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:01.880
 So now it's, let's talk about my deadlift, my thousand pound deadlift.

1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:06.080
 We'll talk about the training cycles for both the thousand deadlift and squat.

1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:11.400
 So backing up a year out from the deadlift, knowing I was training at the time, heavy

1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:16.960
 deadlifts once a week and usually it was two of those sessions a month were really heavy

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:17.960
 and the others weren't.

1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:23.560
 And it's like, okay, how can we get this up to where I'm deadlifting twice a week?

1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:26.880
 Because that's where I want to be, uh, to be able to accomplish this.

1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:30.840
 I need to be loading about that much with frequency, with a certain volume to be able

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:31.840
 to accomplish this goal.

1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:34.880
 We're not going to go through all the math and stuff like that and how that's arrived,

1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:37.520
 but there is math behind this.

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:41.600
 And so instead of just like, oh, well, let's start deadlifting twice a week.

1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:42.600
 No.

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:48.480
 So we start and we take the one session that we've got and we split it, part of it, take

1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:50.920
 part of it away and put it in the second half of the week.

1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:53.640
 So the total volume is still the same.

1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:59.360
 And then, um, we start adding some volume, but I'm doing it at a off a block so that

1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:03.760
 the actual load is accumulative load is less cause I have less range of motion.

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:04.760
 Okay.

1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:08.440
 And then we start building that closer to the ground, closer to the ground and so on.

1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:12.880
 And now we start getting to where I'm almost doing two sessions, full sessions a week.

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:16.340
 And then we start adding a little bit of load.

1:09:16.340 --> 1:09:22.180
 And so at my level, this isn't talking about adding another set or another day a week.

1:09:22.180 --> 1:09:29.440
 We're talking like in my squat, it might be one rep instead of doing three sets of three

1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:37.020
 at one week, I do two doubles or two triples, then two doubles to give me one more rep.

1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:38.020
 That's it.

1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:40.600
 And so we're doing that from one week to the next.

1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:41.600
 And that's a cycle training cycle.

1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.360
 It might be five, six weeks and then so on and the next one and slowly bringing that

1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.380
 average load up.

1:09:47.380 --> 1:09:52.780
 So the last phases of the squat, for example, we took the average loading every week.

1:09:52.780 --> 1:09:54.280
 So my, of my heavy sets.

1:09:54.280 --> 1:10:01.400
 Once we developed all this stuff over the last year to get to this point, now it is

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:05.920
 taking and going, okay, my average load this week is eight reps at nine hundred and fifty

1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:07.480
 five pounds.

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:13.360
 And then the next week, let's get it to nine, nine fifty seven, nine sixty three.

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:17.520
 And this was pretty aggressive working up to where my average loading the final that

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:22.120
 the final was nine hundred and eighty five pounds average load for eight to nine reps.

1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:23.120
 And that's what I said.

1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:24.120
 This is the intense part.

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:30.160
 This is the day of was much easier that week over week is pretty brutal.

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:32.280
 May not sound well, you're just squatting.

1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:33.280
 And now let's back up.

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:34.820
 Let's look at the quality development.

1:10:34.820 --> 1:10:40.240
 So a year out from the squat, obviously, I've been working on developing axial load capacity,

1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:44.140
 my capacity to withstand load from top to bottom.

1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:46.680
 So I like thinking about things and movement vectors.

1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:52.340
 So this vector is an axial loaded vector is the hardest to recover from that was axial.

1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:55.440
 Like is deadlift, are they both or both?

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:56.440
 Yep.

1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:01.120
 So a horizontal front to back would be like a row or a press.

1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:06.040
 Why is the axial hardest to recover because it's entire body, the entire entire body,

1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:11.000
 just anything that is that taxes the the spinal mechanics?

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.160
 I don't I could tell you my beliefs.

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:15.160
 It's studied.

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:16.160
 It is.

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:20.040
 OK, we can just keep the discussion on that short like that.

1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:24.800
 Well, so we start looking at those different vectors that we're training in.

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:27.640
 And so this is why this is important to understand.

1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:29.480
 So I'm not just getting into nuance here.

1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:34.400
 So, hey, squatting is going to make me make me jump further because it's legs.

1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:40.520
 Well, squatting is an axial load vector and jumping is a vector this way.

1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:46.640
 So actually, hip thrust would help with your and this is proven in science with your forward

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:48.420
 jumping ability.

1:11:48.420 --> 1:11:49.920
 They're both working similar muscles.

1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:54.160
 The glute extension, but they're working it in those different platforms.

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:57.200
 So it's really important to understand because people don't understand.

1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:01.440
 I'm building my work capacity by doing sled process.

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:04.720
 You're not developing your work capacity for squatting.

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:11.440
 Most movements, even ones as holistic as a as a squat, require specialization.

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:12.440
 Yeah.

1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:15.100
 You can't get strong at the squat by doing it.

1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:18.040
 You're going to have some carry over, right, obviously.

1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:22.760
 But because taking an untrained person that hasn't done it is still not going to do as

1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:26.360
 good as somebody that's done nonspecific work, but done work.

1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:30.600
 So but yes, for the most part, to get truly strong, you need to specialize.

1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:33.020
 So but not all the time.

1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:34.480
 So now we talk about quality.

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.120
 So and if we specialize in the same thing too long, we stagnate because the body adapts

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.920
 to a certain point and just can't make progress.

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:46.720
 So we wanted to save the actual squatting in the pattern with the bar that I was doing

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:48.680
 for the very end.

1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:55.080
 So starting a year out, I started doing work front squatting like a squat axial loaded

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.440
 pattern and worked on maximizing that up.

1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:03.080
 Then I started shifting to doing transformer bar squat.

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:06.580
 It's this bar I developed that actually change manipulates spinal mechanics.

1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:10.680
 So I started loading in these more forward positions and being able again.

1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:13.960
 So now I'm getting closer than a front squat, but not quite squatting.

1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:18.420
 And then I would start adjusting that bar every training cycle to closer to a squat

1:13:18.420 --> 1:13:21.080
 toaster to a squat till it finally was right.

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:25.080
 What's the difference between a front squat and a regular like a back squat?

1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:30.480
 Like in terms of the stress on the body, the mechanics, was there something interesting

1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:34.160
 to be said about like how fundamentally different are they?

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:35.340
 So it's interesting.

1:13:35.340 --> 1:13:38.920
 People think about the weight and imposition to them like, oh, the bars in front of me,

1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:42.480
 the bars behind me, which is not the case.

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:45.160
 The bar is above your midfoot.

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:48.280
 The load is above your midfoot.

1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:52.360
 So we're actually manipulating the spine behind the bar.

1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:56.440
 So we're causing spinal uprighting behind the bar, getting in a more erect position,

1:13:56.440 --> 1:13:59.640
 which is going to change the relationship of the hip angle.

1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:02.320
 It's going to change our ability to maintain the spine.

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:08.840
 It's going to change how much the core comes in, how hard it is to maintain that sternum

1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:11.360
 to diaphragm relationship that we talked about.

1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:12.680
 All this stuff starts changing.

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:14.760
 So the bar stays in the same place.

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:17.920
 Bar is still behind you, but the load moves around.

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:21.240
 But we're actually manipulating the spine around the load.

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:22.240
 Yeah.

1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:23.240
 It's incredible.

1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:27.160
 We can tailor it to an athlete, which is great when you got a seven foot plus tall baseball

1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:28.800
 player or basketball player.

1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:30.240
 That's why we work with all these teams.

1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:33.520
 Anyway, so it's like you're taking something and getting closer and closer to it.

1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:35.340
 At the same time, we're looking at the quality.

1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:39.260
 So like I needed to be able to really hold this torso position with the weight moving

1:14:39.260 --> 1:14:40.260
 up here.

1:14:40.260 --> 1:14:45.240
 Unlike the deadlift, the ability to manage this TL position becomes much more challenging.

1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:50.080
 So that was also why I was choosing the transformer bar, because it actually challenges that more

1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:51.680
 in those big forward positions.

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:56.920
 I was also working on my back strength tremendously to be able to hold the maintain position.

1:14:56.920 --> 1:15:00.580
 So there was a lot of like I chose a bent over rows.

1:15:00.580 --> 1:15:02.380
 So bent over row is a mixed vector.

1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:03.720
 So it's a forward to back.

1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:09.280
 So it wouldn't have as much carrier, but it's also got some axial loading component in it

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:10.640
 as well.

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:12.360
 So we're working on that.

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:15.920
 And then as we get closer and closer to competition, I'm developing those strengths.

1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:18.180
 But now I need to start tapering those out.

1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:22.520
 So all of my recovery needs can now go into the more specific that I'm actually ramping

1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:24.160
 the load up.

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:29.320
 So as I'm ramping the load on the weight, I'm able to ramp it a lot faster because I'm

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:30.840
 tapering out the other stuff.

1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:37.600
 So I can still keep my total load high, but now get it very, very specific.

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:41.200
 So everything that I've done has always been kind of an annual training cycle.

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:44.800
 And then again, this was like this was a five year training cycle, but we just kind of walked

1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:50.000
 through the last year of each and you can see how these concepts play out in reality.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.760
 So in the cycling.

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:58.640
 So this is both for you, but also for more recreational strength athletes.

1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:01.480
 Let's say there's variety injected into this.

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:02.760
 You need variety.

1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:03.760
 Yeah.

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:04.760
 Yeah.

1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:07.800
 So you will basically stagnate at some level, right?

1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:10.600
 So you should always be kind of shifting a little bit.

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:16.920
 So three to four month blocks in general for an average, you know, just a gen pop fitness

1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:22.040
 is pretty good where you're going to spend more time maybe in a higher rep range or lower

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:27.000
 rep range, a little bit more work on endurance capacity or maybe some more time.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.280
 Hey, I'm playing around with boxing or jujitsu or something like that.

1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:33.280
 Bring that a little bit more to the front for a while and bring the other out.

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:38.320
 But like mixing mixing those variables up, but trying to keep the total load the same

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:41.200
 and always kind of like, you know, do we add a little more?

1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:43.640
 Again, it doesn't have to be major and it shouldn't be major.

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:44.740
 You don't want these big jumps.

1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:48.280
 You don't go, oh, my God, let's move.

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:51.520
 Let's jump into squatting every day.

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:54.360
 You've got to build the capacity to do that.

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:55.960
 It's simple.

1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:01.760
 What role would you say strength has in sports that combine skill and strength?

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:07.640
 So for me personally, maybe I'll just ask it selfishly, which is grappling, wrestling,

1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:08.640
 MMA.

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:09.640
 Yeah.

1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:12.640
 How about I start with baseball?

1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:13.640
 Please.

1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:14.640
 No.

1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:15.640
 I will.

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:16.640
 OK.

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:17.640
 I know.

1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:18.640
 The sport.

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:19.640
 OK.

1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:20.640
 No.

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:21.640
 Baseball and golf are two of my favorite sports.

1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:22.640
 Oh, no.

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:23.640
 I don't.

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:25.800
 You don't have to be in shape at all to excel at those sports.

1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:26.800
 Well, here's the thing.

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:27.800
 There we go.

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:28.800
 It doesn't help.

1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:29.800
 I'm going to get this argument.

1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:34.320
 Well, I've got a perfect example, because this is why I sell so many Transformer bars

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:36.340
 into the Major League Baseball.

1:17:36.340 --> 1:17:42.320
 So they get these people that come in, these athletes, that have been baseball their whole

1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:43.320
 life.

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:44.780
 It is part of the culture.

1:17:44.780 --> 1:17:46.400
 And so they're great athletes.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:47.920
 They've got all this skill.

1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:53.520
 The only thing they have to do is develop a little bit more resilience so that they

1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:54.760
 don't have the injury.

1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:58.720
 They can push their training a little bit more, that they can add a little bit more

1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:01.760
 force output and be able to recover from it.

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.860
 So the only thing they've got to do is add some training.

1:18:04.860 --> 1:18:08.480
 But there's no training culture there, so they don't have any experience, which is why

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:11.900
 they love the Transformer bar, because they don't have to worry about teaching the technique.

1:18:11.900 --> 1:18:15.200
 We can actually set the bar on a setting that makes their squats perfect by cueing all the

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.380
 stuff with actually not having to coach it.

1:18:17.380 --> 1:18:21.020
 Because when you're coaching a roomful of athletes, it's really hard to teach the nuance

1:18:21.020 --> 1:18:23.000
 of all this and not sure that all that.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:27.400
 But that's all that they have to do with these players with a huge level of skill.

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:35.520
 So once you reach a certain level of skill, adding strength is the only real forward path.

1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:39.640
 So that's the basic, simple answer to that.

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:42.600
 So one of the benefits there being injury prevention, actually.

1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:43.600
 Injury prevention.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:44.600
 Resilience.

1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:49.320
 Because especially fighting sports, you're going to be challenged and thrown and other

1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:50.640
 things happen to you.

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:54.760
 And the more resilient you can make your structures, the better you're going to be.

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:57.080
 Even a cyclist, mountain biking.

1:18:57.080 --> 1:18:58.080
 Why would they need it?

1:18:58.080 --> 1:18:59.480
 Why would they need to do upper body training?

1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:02.240
 Take a crash, your shoulder's gone.

1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:03.240
 You're done.

1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:04.240
 Your career's over.

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:07.560
 Unless you've done a little training.

1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:09.120
 So there's value in all this stuff.

1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:12.400
 But the resilience, that's huge.

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:15.000
 And then we can overlay strength.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.880
 Where we miss is this focus on strength when we haven't developed quality motor patterns

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:20.880
 first.

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:23.880
 So this is a huge thing with children.

1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:26.880
 Because people want to know what's the appropriate training age.

1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:29.800
 I'd have had my daughter training before my son.

1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:33.340
 Because she developed movement patterns that have better quality earlier.

1:19:33.340 --> 1:19:34.340
 There's no age.

1:19:34.340 --> 1:19:37.280
 Because it's going to be very dependent on the individual.

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:41.240
 There's no point in having adaptation if we don't have the right thing to adapt to yet.

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:44.120
 And that applies to general movement, but also to sport.

1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.680
 You're saying the skills should be developed first and then the strength applied on top

1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:48.680
 of that.

1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:49.680
 Yep.

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:56.520
 Maybe you can educate me, but I actually quit lifting and powerlifting for a long time

1:19:56.520 --> 1:20:05.520
 after I started Judo, Jiu Jitsu, grappling, all this sort of combat sports.

1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:15.520
 Because I found that it was preventing me from relaxing my body enough to load in the

1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:17.300
 skill.

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:20.920
 So this isn't a problem with the training.

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.960
 This is a problem with you.

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:25.840
 So this is actually really, really important.

1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:33.560
 The first product I ever released was a loadable mace, a swinging mace.

1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:38.440
 And because every power lifter and body, well, not every, but most serious power lifters

1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:44.480
 and bodybuilders, like shoulders, mobility is pretty limited.

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:47.440
 And most of them really, really struggle with this.

1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:52.800
 The problem is they've been taught to have tension all the time.

1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:53.920
 And that's not good.

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:57.300
 So when we talk about the joint positions that we were talking about earlier and having

1:20:57.300 --> 1:21:03.840
 those and the muscles in the right length and tension relationship, athleticism is the

1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:11.080
 speed to relaxation because the counter is speed to contraction.

1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:14.600
 Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:20.120
 And so what a mace can do is use that because this ties back into a developmental kinesiology

1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:24.760
 because a lot of like reset patterns are getting back into these basic movements, but it's

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:28.920
 as much about relaxation as it is contraction.

1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:32.500
 So a mace, we have this weight on a big long lever.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:36.440
 So if I grab a kettlebell and this would be like the same movement as a kettlebell halo,

1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:42.840
 it is the same movement as a, but here in the halo, I'm on the whole time with the mace

1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:47.640
 at the proper length, with the right distribution, you cannot do the movement.

1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:50.320
 You could not move force your way through it.

1:21:50.320 --> 1:21:55.000
 The only way that you can accomplish that is by relaxing.

1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:00.840
 And then now we, now we can contract all the muscles related around that shoulder girdle

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:01.980
 all at once.

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:06.800
 We're working on, off, on, off, on, off with moving and contracting.

1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:11.880
 And now, so what happens a lot of times as we, you know, this stiffness and tightness

1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:12.880
 happens.

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.880
 So in four positions, we start using stabilizer muscles to do the movement.

1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:19.800
 And then that's where this stiffness come from.

1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:24.960
 So it means that in some of whatever training that you're doing, there's a deficit in the

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:27.660
 movement quality, okay.

1:22:27.660 --> 1:22:31.680
 Or there's a deficit in the training program and you're not recovering from an 80% of the

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:32.680
 time.

1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:33.680
 That's the right answer.

1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:34.680
 Right.

1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:39.440
 But yeah, that's where the, where the gap is and learning how to relax and the way a

1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:43.460
 lot of the exercises are taught and have been taught for a long time, which is why there's

1:22:43.460 --> 1:22:44.460
 a big gap.

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:49.200
 And this is why both clinical rehab and all these other components are mixed in my philosophy

1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:53.760
 and what I'm trying to do with Kabuki strength, because I'm looking at holistic movement.

1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:58.560
 I'm not looking at powerlifting based movements are what I want to load and be able to assess

1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:00.680
 on.

1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:07.240
 But this affects all sports, all activities and strength doesn't have to be that.

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:10.720
 I mean, I'm freaking a thousand pound squatter and deadlifter.

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:15.120
 If you watch any of my videos where I do like complete quad fallbacks, I don't stretch at

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:16.120
 all.

1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:17.120
 I can usually get close to a full split.

1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:18.120
 Like if I want to.

1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:19.120
 What?

1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:21.120
 No, I did not see those videos.

1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:22.120
 Okay.

1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:23.600
 That's, that's hard to believe.

1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:24.600
 Wow.

1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:25.600
 Okay.

1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:26.600
 Well actually I do.

1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:29.680
 I just did one recently, a quad fallback with my, with my mace loaded way out to the end

1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.320
 torsioning on both ends of the other.

1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:35.560
 And like I do a lot of, I do a lot of weird stuff.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.560
 That's awesome.

1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:39.480
 But squatting doesn't make your hips tight.

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:42.880
 Squatting like shit makes your hips tight.

1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:48.720
 And so, but there is no perfect world where always our training program isn't quite perfect.

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:50.840
 Our movement isn't necessarily perfect.

1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:52.840
 Like so you're going to have the needs for this stuff.

1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:58.080
 But if you're always have to do some soft tissue work to loosen up the same one for

1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:01.920
 that exercise, to be able to get a joint in position, there is a problem.

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:05.240
 And I'm not saying don't do it, do it because I don't want you to have a joint.

1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:09.920
 Like if I can't get my shoulders in a position, I can't do overhead presses because I'm going

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:11.080
 to compromise my spine position.

1:24:11.080 --> 1:24:12.760
 Then I'm going to end up with some other problems.

1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:13.760
 Right?

1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:18.920
 So go ahead and clean that up so you can get in position, but go figure out why it is and

1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:20.460
 fix it.

1:24:20.460 --> 1:24:23.440
 And then maybe next, you know, three, four months from now, they're going to get a little

1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:29.200
 something else going on, fix it, but go understand the deeper root reason of why.

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:35.180
 So I'm, I believe I am the only company manufacturing and selling, you know, fascial soft tissue

1:24:35.180 --> 1:24:36.180
 tools.

1:24:36.180 --> 1:24:39.920
 And I'll tell you, I don't want you to use them.

1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:43.880
 Cause it's not helping you get to the why, why it was caused in the first place.

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:44.880
 Yeah.

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:49.020
 The goal, the goal, the perfect state is not having to use them.

1:24:49.020 --> 1:24:52.080
 Reality is you're going to have to use them from time to time because the world's not

1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:53.080
 perfect.

1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:54.080
 Yeah.

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:56.480
 So your discovery is a hundred percent on point.

1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:02.920
 Well there's another side to combat sports when you're beginning a particular combat

1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:10.200
 sport, strength can be a negative because human psychology, because you can get away

1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:11.760
 with a lot when you're strong.

1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:12.760
 Uh huh.

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:13.760
 Yes, you can.

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:19.680
 So if your mind is strong enough to where you can just turn off that advantage and be

1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:23.800
 a beginner, truly in a particular art, that's probably the best way to do it.

1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:26.000
 But you can get away and then you don't learn.

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000
 Yeah.

1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:28.000
 Yeah.

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.000
 It's hard.

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:35.560
 Uh, it's hard not to use the little advantages you have because like jujitsu is a big hit

1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:42.120
 on an, on the ego for, you know, especially guys, you know, when like a smaller person

1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:48.220
 just destroys you, dominates you when you can, uh, I don't know, deadlift whatever number

1:25:48.220 --> 1:25:50.000
 of pounds.

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:56.800
 And uh, it's hard not to use that strength to then resist the slow, the ultimate destruction

1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:02.560
 by like 120 pound, but that, and that's why I recommend developing the skill quality first,

1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:06.680
 but it doesn't, it doesn't mean that you can't, I can't, you can still do it so that don't

1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:09.840
 take it as a like, oh, I can't go that direction.

1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:10.840
 That's fine.

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:14.440
 But understand those things and then also understand the jujitsu is additional load

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:15.480
 on the body.

1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:18.680
 So you have to, you can't just add it on top.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:22.680
 You've got to taper back the other, you're going to have to make a, I'm sorry, you may

1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:28.960
 not want to hear it, but you're not going to be able to do as much and add that here.

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:35.440
 It's a compromise because your total volume still has to be there and there's not, unfortunately,

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:39.320
 not really a way to measure what the jujitsu volume is with this.

1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:44.280
 So you've got to take a look at that and that's where like measuring like heart rate variability

1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:50.000
 or other stuff can be useful so you can see what is happening from me from a sympathetic

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.640
 versus parasympathetic nervous system standpoint.

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:53.640
 Yeah.

1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:56.920
 Making sure your body recovers sufficiently and trying to put numbers to it.

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.760
 You mentioned Kabuki strength.

1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:04.640
 You run the Kabuki strength lab previously called the elite performance center in Oregon.

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:07.440
 You called it the perfect gym.

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:11.040
 What makes for the perfect strength training gym?

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:12.040
 Where I called it the perfect gym?

1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:14.040
 In a video somewhere I watched.

1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:15.040
 Oh man.

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:19.960
 I mean, that's where my testing grounds for developing all this stuff was through the

1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:20.960
 years.

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:26.560
 And, and so this is, like I said, I started developing relationships with the best developmental

1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:30.960
 kinesiologist in the, in the U S the best, arguably the best or most well known physical

1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:35.240
 therapist in the world, the best spine biomechanist in the world.

1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:38.880
 I started doing continuing education with these clinical courses and learning this stuff

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:41.160
 and going, but how does it work in my world?

1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:42.160
 Right.

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:44.020
 And then I started lecturing with them and all this other stuff.

1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:47.360
 But the lab was like, where do we test this stuff?

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:48.360
 Right.

1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:49.360
 And so let me get to a point.

1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:50.360
 There's three things.

1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:52.480
 There's always three things.

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:59.720
 So to be a success, to achieve success, I believe there's three things that really,

1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:08.200
 really come into place and it's the right methodology, the right tools and the right

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:10.040
 environment.

1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:13.780
 And so it was all about building that.

1:28:13.780 --> 1:28:19.680
 And so the methodologies came from a lot of that different, that gray area interaction

1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:22.520
 of clinical with sports science, right?

1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:27.480
 And then the tools I had to start creating and designing, and then the environment is

1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:32.220
 having this, you know, focused environment of people that want to do better and push

1:28:32.220 --> 1:28:35.800
 each other and having community and culture, right?

1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:39.560
 I ended up building these connections, this network, everything that I'm doing with my

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:44.560
 businesses is trying to create that into a scalable fashion.

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:49.200
 And so I'm building the groundwork because to have a system that like, yeah, I had clinicals

1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:51.480
 on site that knew exactly what we were doing.

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:55.960
 And when it's me and a few people in a small team and all this stuff, we're all just like

1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:57.440
 easy to manage.

1:28:57.440 --> 1:28:59.440
 And you can see these, there's other models around this.

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:04.100
 So I've been other areas since maybe whenever it was I filmed that video that said that,

1:29:04.100 --> 1:29:09.020
 that they have that same model and it's taken probably about a decade usually to develop

1:29:09.020 --> 1:29:10.020
 that.

1:29:10.020 --> 1:29:14.240
 You know, and having the right people in this community, they can create this, this network

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.920
 and the tool and all this stuff, right?

1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:21.040
 Except they still don't have the best tools because Kibuki strength didn't exist.

1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:27.920
 But but and so out of that was, is essentially I started building this business and people

1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:30.640
 like, when did you know how all this stuff was connected?

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:32.400
 And I'm like, I don't know.

1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:37.600
 I didn't, I just started creating on the outset the things that worked until finally I'm like,

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:41.900
 I'm recreating a scalable version of this stuff.

1:29:41.900 --> 1:29:46.160
 Here's the methodologies and a coaching platform that we can manage clients around the globe

1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:50.160
 and see what's working and not based on the scientific principles of training, right?

1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:54.180
 How do we create that into a database that now we can train new coaches and they can

1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:58.960
 use those same metrics and tools to create programs that are tailored to fit person's

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:00.720
 individual needs, right?

1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:06.360
 Now how do we integrate that with assessment and clinical care assessment and all these

1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:07.720
 other pieces?

1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:09.500
 So there's a lot of work in that.

1:30:09.500 --> 1:30:11.960
 And so that's where Kibuki strength is the genesis.

1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:16.760
 But we have, we call our gym the Kibuki strength lab.

1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:20.160
 Literally people find about our gym in the neighborhood and they're like, how long have

1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:21.160
 you been here?

1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:22.460
 Why, why do I not know about this?

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:24.520
 We don't advertise our gym at all.

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:27.840
 So like that makes no sense.

1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:32.940
 Well that's because the only reason is to have a testing environment for the tools and

1:30:32.940 --> 1:30:38.000
 methodology and having enough people to have the culture and fit and to be able to be part

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:39.920
 of the experiment.

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:44.280
 What about the environment of the, the feel of it, the actual gym?

1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:47.360
 There's a, I don't know, a grunginess to it.

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:54.840
 I recently became a member of planet fitness for, for reasons that have to do more with

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:59.360
 the heat in Austin that sometimes I need to put in time in the treadmill.

1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:00.360
 I don't like that.

1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:01.360
 I don't have any judgment, honestly.

1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:06.040
 I don't, the best gyms I've been in are kind of dirty.

1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:08.440
 You walk in and you know that work is to be done.

1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:10.640
 There's not another reason to do there.

1:31:10.640 --> 1:31:13.560
 It is the, the environment is tight.

1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:16.480
 There's a big piece of that.

1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:19.040
 I know it's studied sociologically, I believe.

1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:26.080
 I just, I just pictured that word too, but the intensity, when you start growing a space,

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:28.600
 the intensity drops.

1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:33.080
 And so I, I had that experience when we grew, we went from a 4,000 foot to a 9,000 square

1:31:33.080 --> 1:31:35.200
 foot gym at one time.

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:38.360
 And everybody's like, it doesn't feel the same.

1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:39.760
 Like people are complaining for years.

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:42.320
 We've shrunk it back down whenever down to 3,500 square feet.

1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:44.080
 And it creates that intensity.

1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:47.600
 It creates the closest, the connection with the people around you.

1:31:47.600 --> 1:31:52.000
 And then like I said, the grunginess, like you go in, you know, the intention when you

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.320
 walk in that environment creates that tension.

1:31:54.320 --> 1:31:58.580
 But when I speak environment, it's not just the, it's not the physical, it's the people.

1:31:58.580 --> 1:32:03.680
 But you know, when the gym is a little bit beat up, it also tells a story.

1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:06.560
 Like there's a history to it.

1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:11.640
 You could tell that not only is there work to be done, that work has been done here.

1:32:11.640 --> 1:32:12.640
 Yes.

1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:13.640
 Like battles have been fought.

1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:20.680
 There's something to that where you're just in a long line of people, you know, that fought

1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:21.680
 and won.

1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:26.360
 And we could get into a whole nother space, there'd be a whole nother topic, but that

1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:28.240
 existing energy of a space.

1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:32.520
 I mean, we mentioned offline, Joe Rogan, he talks about the same with comedy clubs.

1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:36.040
 There's certain, there's certain clubs that just have a history.

1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:38.040
 There's an energy there.

1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:40.960
 You can get all woo woo, but you know, it's there.

1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:41.960
 It's a real thing.

1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:43.960
 I think you walk in and you can feel it.

1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:44.960
 You feel it.

1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:45.960
 You feel it.

1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:46.960
 Yeah.

1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:52.360
 That makes me feel that somehow all of us humans are connected in a ways that's hard

1:32:52.360 --> 1:32:57.040
 to describe, even the ones who are no longer here.

1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:05.040
 Just the greatness that once was is still in the walls, in the space, present there.

1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:07.280
 And we somehow can plug into that energy.

1:33:07.280 --> 1:33:08.280
 Yeah.

1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:11.640
 It's, we can go down a, go down a path there.

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:13.760
 There's something really powerful there.

1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:20.840
 You've also mentioned a bunch of cool equipment that you've developed as part of Kabuki Strength.

1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:24.640
 Probably a little bit of that has to do with your engineering education, but also just

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:29.160
 generally with the spirit of the innovator that you are.

1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:35.040
 What are some cool, maybe revolutionary pieces of equipment that you're particularly proud

1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:39.600
 of or just you've been obsessed with recently that you're developing?

1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:40.600
 Yeah.

1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:41.600
 Love to talk about that.

1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:46.440
 So we've got some wild crazy stuff that just came out and is coming out too.

1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:52.640
 So everything that we create and release at Kabuki Strength, the industry hasn't seen

1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:54.440
 before.

1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:56.400
 There's stuff that's basic foundational.

1:33:56.400 --> 1:34:02.920
 It's been around forever because it works, but there's always more.

1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:04.400
 It could be better.

1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:07.380
 And why are we not looking at these things, these foundational things?

1:34:07.380 --> 1:34:10.760
 So when people are coming up with novel things, they ended up being way different outside

1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:11.760
 the perspective.

1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:17.000
 And I'm coming up with things that are way different that are plays on what we already

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000
 know works.

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000
 So we talked about the transform bar, the only bar in the world.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.180
 We can manipulate spinal mechanics.

1:34:22.180 --> 1:34:27.920
 We can, so everything, everything for me from a design concept that we develop is all about

1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:37.640
 creating products that can rapidly accommodate to the variability of an individual's leverages,

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.480
 mobility and training needs.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:41.480
 Okay.

1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:45.160
 And that's going to also create and distill down the size and scope of space that we need,

1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:48.580
 which is going to be, continue to be an ongoing thing.

1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:51.720
 Check out my Instagram after this and you'll see, I put an entire gym on the bed of my

1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:58.880
 truck and went on vacation last week, drove to the desert and by entire gym, I mean a

1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:03.840
 squat rack, full compliment of our specialty bars, a horizontal and vertical pulley system,

1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:09.360
 handheld weights, shoulder rock, like a complete, an entire gym in product that took up the

1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:13.160
 space the size of this bed right here.

1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:14.160
 That's incredible.

1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:16.040
 Because of the design scope of what we have.

1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:21.280
 So the cool thing is that there's two other bars that fit our biomechanically sound barbell

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:22.280
 designs.

1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:23.420
 We talked about the transformer bar.

1:35:23.420 --> 1:35:27.920
 The other two are built on this thing I called playground physics.

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:35.600
 So we have these bars with handles that are off parallel with the axis.

1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:37.440
 So they've been around the market for a long time.

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:40.560
 One is a hex bar or a trap bar.

1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:46.640
 Another one is a, it's a pressing bar with the handles turned as well.

1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.640
 And both of them suck.

1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:49.640
 They're horrible.

1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:54.440
 Any lifter knows if you pick it up, it's going to break your wrist and crush into your face.

1:35:54.440 --> 1:36:00.280
 And it just, it just doesn't feel good pressing, but it alleviates the strain on the wrist.

1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:02.000
 So people use it for that reason.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.760
 And the, the, the trap bar, same thing.

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.640
 It's always diving forward in your hand.

1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:07.920
 So it's kind of limited.

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:12.200
 It's also limited in use because you can't, you could do a lot more with it.

1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:15.000
 So these bars are really cool playground physics.

1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:25.640
 So as soon as the center of rotation is on the same axis as the center of mass and the

1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:30.800
 handle is off center, you have, you have a teeter totter.

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:34.660
 So a teeter totter has a balance point, but it's infinitely perfect.

1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:36.200
 So technically you can never find it.

1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:38.840
 So always going to be sitting on one side or the other in a playground.

1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:40.360
 And that's what these bars are designed.

1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:42.340
 So you've got instability right here.

1:36:42.340 --> 1:36:43.340
 You can't find the center of the bars.

1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:45.080
 It's always trying to tip in your hands on the trap bar.

1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:48.760
 So you can't do carries with it cause you're doing for momentum and it wants to, it wants

1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:49.760
 to dip on you.

1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:50.760
 Right.

1:36:50.760 --> 1:36:52.360
 Um, the Swiss bar wants to crush your face.

1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:53.360
 Well, what do we do?

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:58.520
 We just make a swing, but center of mass below center of rotation.

1:36:58.520 --> 1:36:59.520
 And what does it do?

1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:02.700
 Oh, it always finds center.

1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:06.760
 So, so the handles on the, our pressing bar it's art.

1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:11.820
 So the handles are above center of rotation and then, and then every angle, instead of

1:37:11.820 --> 1:37:17.040
 just being a certain fixed angles, each angle is based on the width, the average width of

1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:18.040
 an individual.

1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:23.240
 So the internal and external rotational bias is based of the shoulder is based on the width,

1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:26.380
 leaving just a little bit left because we talked about the lap being a stabilizer.

1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:30.600
 You still need to have a little bit of cue of external rotation to engage that as a stabilizer.

1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:31.600
 Boom.

1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:35.280
 Now all of a sudden you have a bar and I kid you not, this is a great story.

1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:36.280
 Major league baseball.

1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:39.200
 When I presented it, every head strength coach for a major league baseball team, maybe not

1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:42.960
 every, but damn near most of them have bad shoulders.

1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:43.960
 They can't press.

1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:45.820
 They've gotten shoulder surgeries, so on.

1:37:45.820 --> 1:37:48.240
 And so we're showing them, they love all our stuff and I'm like, Hey, I've got this cool

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:49.360
 prototype I want to show you.

1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:50.360
 It's a pressing bar.

1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:54.640
 And they're like, Oh, you know, major league baseball is a little hesitant on pressing

1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:59.640
 because the dangers for the shoulder and I can't, I haven't been able to take a bar to

1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:00.640
 my chest.

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:01.640
 I mean, I'd really love to.

1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:07.240
 It's been five years since I've, I've been able to to XX train and I'm like, just try

1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:08.240
 it.

1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:09.240
 Put a bar on my chest without pain.

1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:10.240
 I'm like, just try it.

1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:11.240
 Put it in there.

1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:12.240
 Ooh, that feels good.

1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:15.360
 Now the arc makes it actually three inches deeper.

1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:16.560
 So people are automatically scared.

1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:17.560
 I can't do that.

1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:18.800
 Cause that's an extra range of motion.

1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:19.800
 Right?

1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:20.800
 Like, Ooh, put a plate on there.

1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:21.800
 They're doing it.

1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:24.800
 By the time the staff's like, they're all standing around, you see like, what's going

1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:25.800
 on?

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:26.800
 Put two plates on.

1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:29.600
 You see the, just like he gets up.

1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:33.080
 How do you feel like, I feel fine.

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:34.720
 No pain at all.

1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:42.800
 I did this with five teams with five of the, it happening repeatedly five times that they

1:38:42.800 --> 1:38:47.920
 and every one of them worked up to two plates and did reps varied with zero pain to a three

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.480
 inch range or greater range of major.

1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:50.480
 Cause what did we do?

1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:53.400
 We stacked all the joints and we provided stability at the end that we balanced internal

1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:54.400
 and external rotation.

1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:58.360
 I mean just basic playground physics and it changed the game.

1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:02.280
 Now we get a greater range of motion with a greater training effect with the negative

1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:03.760
 stresses removed.

1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:09.640
 Our trap bar opened up one side, which there was already some like that out there created.

1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:12.080
 It pops up so you can pick up, take the weights on and off.

1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:16.800
 It's got a built in Jack and then created the high handle position, which already did.

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.280
 Everybody uses the high handle on a trap bar.

1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:20.040
 They just don't know why they like it.

1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:23.280
 The handle that's on center, we offset just a little bit, not enough to make a difference

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:27.520
 on the range of motion lift or even notice visibly, but it still has the same effect.

1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:30.200
 So both handles now have that.

1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:33.560
 We added the option of different handle sizes based on whatever your needs are.

1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:38.280
 One that rolls to develop a grip and then different widths that you could choose from

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:44.440
 based on whether you're training a teen athlete or a seven foot six NBA player or a NFL lineman

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:48.600
 so that we can accommodate for all these differences.

1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:53.040
 Now it becomes the most functional all around bar around because now you can do carries

1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:54.040
 with it.

1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:55.040
 You can do split squats with it.

1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:57.340
 You could do curls with it because it goes around the body.

1:39:57.340 --> 1:40:00.280
 You can do overhead presses because you don't have a thing that gets in your way and you

1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:01.800
 can flip it up into position.

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:04.720
 You can do bent over rows and not run into your shins.

1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:06.220
 You can do seal rows off of a bench.

1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:07.580
 You can do ab rollouts.

1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:08.580
 You could, should I go on?

1:40:08.580 --> 1:40:09.580
 Yeah.

1:40:09.580 --> 1:40:10.580
 So you can use it as like the main bar.

1:40:10.580 --> 1:40:12.320
 The best multi purpose bar around.

1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:13.780
 You got a home gym, one bar.

1:40:13.780 --> 1:40:16.420
 Like how do you develop totally new equipment like this?

1:40:16.420 --> 1:40:19.600
 I scratch it on paper.

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.920
 Maybe weld some cut up and weld up a prototype, but usually I just hand the scratched up paper

1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:30.400
 to my engineering manager and that's what he says his job is to distill my chicken scratch

1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:33.640
 into something real and then that team picks it up.

1:40:33.640 --> 1:40:39.200
 But in the old days, starting out, I just walk out, I just walk out and do it.

1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:40.200
 You talk about engineering.

1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:41.900
 I'm actually more, I work more of an artist fashion.

1:40:41.900 --> 1:40:46.040
 It's in my head and I just go create with no plans.

1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:50.040
 And so they have to pick that up and actually do the engineering and testing and all that.

1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:52.200
 And then we got two other products came out this year.

1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:53.200
 Freaking wild.

1:40:53.200 --> 1:40:55.240
 Are you familiar with training with a flywheel?

1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:57.760
 No, no, it's a flywheel.

1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:04.560
 A flywheel is a spinning object that creates an inertial mass and then it reverses direction.

1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:08.160
 So whatever you put into it and there's ones out there.

1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:10.720
 But ours is the first patent pending.

1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:12.720
 That's all everything all in one unit.

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:15.440
 So it's a floor based as well as a horizontal.

1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:17.760
 So you can basically do any pulley movement in the world.

1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:21.320
 And now everything that you put into it on a concentric force, it whips right back as

1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:24.200
 a peak centric load.

1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:26.760
 So there's an accelerating whipping motion.

1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:32.920
 It just yeah, basically, yeah, I mean, okay, I have to have trouble imagining exactly many

1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:37.200
 of the things you're describing, I suppose, have to be experienced, right?

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:38.200
 Yes.

1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:40.120
 Because there's a magic and there's a lot of research.

1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:41.120
 They've been around.

1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:44.920
 They're adopted more heavily in Europe, quite heavily in Europe, but not as much in the

1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:48.160
 US because they sell them as a be all end all tool, which they're not.

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:52.740
 They're crazy for what they do, but it's not the it's another tool.

1:41:52.740 --> 1:41:57.560
 And so we have a very high quality unit now that is half the cost of everybody else's

1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:02.200
 because the innovation of a movable mount point that you for them, you have to have

1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:03.500
 two pieces of equipment.

1:42:03.500 --> 1:42:04.780
 We have one.

1:42:04.780 --> 1:42:10.000
 So and then a few other things, better platform to be able to do things and that we can do

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:16.400
 what we call off platform work, which allows us to do movements like punches and standups,

1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:17.400
 things like that.

1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:21.520
 And then I've got a handheld weight coming out next month that we can actually play with.

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.560
 So varying the load with it, never leaving your hand by changing the leverage point.

1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:29.500
 And so what do we think?

1:42:29.500 --> 1:42:31.720
 What exercise are we talking about here?

1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:35.080
 Anything that would be a dumbbell or a kettlebell movement.

1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.280
 So it functions, it does the function of a kettlebell, a dumbbell and what we call a

1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:42.140
 center mass bell, as well as provides variable loading within a range.

1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:47.240
 So how can you change like how can you change the load?

1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:48.240
 Because load.

1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:49.580
 Well, we don't actually change the load.

1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:53.860
 We change the torque on the on the joint that we're working, which is the same.

1:42:53.860 --> 1:42:55.240
 That's actually what is creating the force.

1:42:55.240 --> 1:42:56.240
 Right.

1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:01.120
 So if I'm doing a front raise, it's where this this downward force is times the distance

1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:02.120
 away.

1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:03.120
 Right.

1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:06.120
 Which also then makes it no force when I've got at the bottom of the front raise, which

1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:09.020
 is why it's so easy with this.

1:43:09.020 --> 1:43:10.020
 It's like a kettlebell.

1:43:10.020 --> 1:43:12.840
 It's offset, except it has three different handles.

1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:16.080
 But it's offset just that a kettlebell, you can't do it because the offset so far it becomes

1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:17.780
 a wrist movement.

1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:22.420
 So ours has three different sizes and the offset just enough so that you can pick.

1:43:22.420 --> 1:43:26.700
 If I put it in a front raise position or curl position, I could put it in outward position

1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:29.880
 and the force is almost what it is at the at the top.

1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:32.360
 Then I get the top and it's the same exact or the curl.

1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:36.320
 So I can actually change the force curve in the movement and then I can just release the

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:39.560
 pressure a little bit and let it swing into position and keep doing a drop set with never

1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:40.560
 letting it down.

1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:41.560
 Yeah.

1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:42.560
 Yeah.

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:45.040
 So it's got a really nice texture grip that allows you to hold it in different positions.

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:48.680
 And then the load offset is just enough that it doesn't overpower the wrist.

1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:52.140
 And then you've got different hand sizes so that you can maximize this relationship and

1:43:52.140 --> 1:43:54.460
 hit whatever joint that you're applying.

1:43:54.460 --> 1:43:55.900
 So sounds incredible.

1:43:55.900 --> 1:43:59.640
 It's really freaking well, it's awesome because you can because the variable load.

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:04.020
 Now I could go straight from front raises to side raises or rear or curl because without

1:44:04.020 --> 1:44:05.440
 like because I don't have to put it down.

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:08.780
 So now my time under tension goes through the roof.

1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:12.340
 And by the way, the same effect with a flywheel trainer because the variable whatever you

1:44:12.340 --> 1:44:14.660
 put into it is what it kicks back.

1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:18.360
 So you have a constant time under tension because there's no rest points either.

1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:24.040
 So all this stuff is working on maximizing time under tension, which anyway, it's cool

1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:25.040
 stuff.

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:26.040
 Anyway, I get excited.

1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:31.320
 Well, let me ask you about another thing you've already mentioned, but I find this really

1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:40.000
 interesting, which is barefoot running and you're sort of a company, Barefoot Athletics.

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:41.000
 Yeah.

1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:46.000
 And the tagline is optimizing the human to ground interface.

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:51.280
 We've talked about this a little bit with the power lifting.

1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:57.880
 How do you think about the the foot ground interface?

1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:05.680
 It's interesting that we know that we should train all these parts of our body to be able

1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:10.580
 to be stronger, be more resilient.

1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:16.080
 But we think that the foot is different, that we need to package it and modify it.

1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:22.520
 And somehow that that's the science of making it healthy where I challenge people think

1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:23.520
 about that.

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:27.440
 Like first thing you do in the morning is roll out of bed and put your weightlifting

1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:31.080
 belt on and wrap it on tight and wear it till you go to bed at night.

1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:36.400
 Do it with your shoulders, your knees, wake up and put some knee wraps on an elbow wraps

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:38.720
 and see what happens.

1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:43.240
 Then you'll get weaker, you'll lose movement capacity and you'll start affecting other

1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:47.000
 areas of the body very negatively because they will start picking up the compensation

1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.920
 for those joints that are not moving properly.

1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:51.920
 This is it.

1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:57.480
 What shoes are for is to protect you from the environment, from cuts and abrasions and

1:45:57.480 --> 1:45:59.800
 heat and things like that.

1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:07.440
 But the foot, let me the mind blowing is like every other area of the body.

1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:12.440
 You need to use it and you need to strengthen it and you need to learn to control it.

1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:13.440
 That's it.

1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:16.160
 That's all I have to say about the subject.

1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:17.160
 It's that simple.

1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:23.880
 But somehow we have been sold entire industries like the orthotics industry.

1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:25.280
 It's completely false.

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:29.900
 Meta analysis of the data shows that orthotics do nothing beyond temporary relief from pain

1:46:29.900 --> 1:46:33.280
 over a six, eight week period of time and provide no long term benefit.

1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:38.720
 And I can't tell you how many people I've eliminated back or knee or hip pain from getting

1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:42.740
 from working on strengthening and controlling the foot and ankle complex.

1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:50.480
 We believe we've villainized and said a low arch is a condition that needs fixed.

1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:54.680
 Like when it really is just controlling the foot and ankle complex and how they relate

1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:56.300
 to each other and how we use that.

1:46:56.300 --> 1:47:01.420
 Is it like go put on boxing gloves in the morning and do that for the next 20 years

1:47:01.420 --> 1:47:02.520
 and see what happens.

1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:07.560
 It's not about finding the right shoe that fits because your foot has been deformed.

1:47:07.560 --> 1:47:11.500
 And so I'm not like some wacky go like, oh, you got to be barefoot forever.

1:47:11.500 --> 1:47:16.840
 Do this like, no, I'm just saying go spend some time using it, strengthen it, learn to

1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:19.320
 control it and you will work better in a shoe.

1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:24.620
 But the whole running shoe movement with the raised heel, that was the person that that

1:47:24.620 --> 1:47:29.580
 suggested that that in to Nike way back when they were trying to figure out what to do,

1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:35.760
 the reason, and he says it's, it's the worst thing that he ever did.

1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:40.080
 Because we were coming from an era of people wearing heeled shoes, which by the way came

1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:42.780
 from stirrups way back in the day.

1:47:42.780 --> 1:47:45.560
 That's where the whole heel came from is to go into stirrup, but then it went into fashion.

1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:49.440
 And then the running craze started coming around in the seventies.

1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:52.200
 They're they're starting to push this, the general mass population.

1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:55.640
 And they realized that they were causing injuries and like, what are we going to do?

1:47:55.640 --> 1:48:00.000
 Well, that's because everybody was in this position and had a shortened, a shortened

1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:01.000
 calf muscle.

1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:06.160
 And it's like, well, the work around, let's just put a heel on it so we don't injure them.

1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:07.160
 That's it.

1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:09.840
 And now because the raised heel, you got to raise the toe.

1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:15.040
 And then now with that, if you go stand on something and pull your inner toe in and in

1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:17.160
 a squat position, just reach down and do it.

1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:21.560
 You'll see that you have no control over internal or next door and rotation of your, of, of

1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:22.560
 your leg.

1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.760
 You don't and, or your foot and you actually have to put a support in for the arch to be

1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:33.120
 able to passively control those structures.

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:36.480
 It's just bandaid on top of bandaid on top of bandaid.

1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:37.600
 Use it, strengthen it.

1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:40.680
 If you want to wear some shoes cause they look good or fancy, I'm like, I have no problem.

1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:42.000
 I mean, I go out on a wife.

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:45.480
 My wife will put on some high heels every now and again.

1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:48.160
 But all I'm saying is use your foot.

1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:51.500
 My thousand pound squat, my thousand pound deadlift, we're done barefoot.

1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.880
 I'm not trying to sell you shoes.

1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:56.320
 Go do it with no shoe.

1:48:56.320 --> 1:48:57.320
 That's what I've been promoting.

1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:02.360
 I did that for six years and I promoted it, but people ask me like, well, what do I do?

1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:03.880
 Because my gym requires shoes.

1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:04.880
 Okay.

1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:06.680
 What do I go?

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:11.080
 And uh, and then I go, well, you know, you could pick up these other finger shoes or

1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:15.300
 whatever and they go, man, my wife won't have sex with me if I do that.

1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:17.560
 And I go, I know mine either.

1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:20.140
 Like trust me, I'm not making this up.

1:49:20.140 --> 1:49:23.960
 Basically in that market markets to one segment and they're still missing some gaps because

1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:26.840
 they, they still have a little bit too narrow of a toe box.

1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:29.920
 And if you're lifting, you have the opportunity to really get that splay and start working

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:31.280
 on this stuff better.

1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:33.980
 So, um, I just wanted to create a shoe.

1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:36.400
 These ones are odd colored cause it's a partnership with Kabuki.

1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:40.980
 Normally we've got a black or a gray, uh, low top, high top sticks to the ground for

1:49:40.980 --> 1:49:43.640
 lifting so we can do that and very pliable.

1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:45.200
 It's a moccasin.

1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:49.200
 It's a modern day moccasin, but looks okay that you can wear it around in other areas.

1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:53.580
 If you, if you so choose, like, you know what the number one healthcare costs in America

1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:54.580
 is.

1:49:54.580 --> 1:50:05.040
 What's that diabetes, uh, heart disease, cancer, low back pain.

1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:06.040
 Hmm.

1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:09.320
 Now, what do you attribute a little back pain to?

1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:13.600
 Well, it's attributed to a lot of things, um, but inability to control spinal position,

1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:17.280
 um, which starts happening from, uh, some breathing issues.

1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:19.720
 Uh, it also happens from the foot.

1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:24.280
 Um, so there's a lot of stuff, but everything that I do actually focus on improving this.

1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:29.240
 Uh, that, and it all starts with this is one thing, like this doesn't affect breathing,

1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:32.960
 but, um, so it does actually affect breathing to some extent and spinal stabilization.

1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:39.000
 So the raised heel and toe will make you stride further, um, because of just how it operates,

1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:43.000
 but that overstride is a result of opening this.

1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:44.640
 So we opened the pelvis and diaphragm.

1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:47.320
 Did we talk about that and the impact that that has for controlling and spine?

1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:48.320
 Yeah.

1:50:48.320 --> 1:50:49.320
 I think we touched on that.

1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:52.400
 Um, but it, it's all this stuff plays together.

1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:53.760
 So the gait affects that.

1:50:53.760 --> 1:50:57.000
 And so the shoe affects the gait and then, so it's all connected.

1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:58.000
 All connected.

1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:01.840
 Let me be very purposeful with some conversation here though.

1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:03.840
 We've talked about periodization.

1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:04.840
 This was a big gap.

1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:08.520
 So, um, people go, yeah, well when people started running with those, they started having

1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:13.100
 injuries back when, uh, the finger, uh, company produced those and didn't do the education

1:51:13.100 --> 1:51:14.920
 around this very simple concept.

1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:18.640
 You do not walk into the gym if you haven't squatted and start squatting 225 from, from

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:22.400
 max recs every week, day or every day over day.

1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:27.320
 And that's what people did because they didn't weren't told that you need to build the capacity

1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:29.240
 to do this.

1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:33.100
 You go wear these and walk around in your office or wherever all day long, your feet

1:51:33.100 --> 1:51:34.100
 are going to hurt.

1:51:34.100 --> 1:51:36.980
 They're going to be sore.

1:51:36.980 --> 1:51:40.520
 Do it for 10% of your time.

1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:42.920
 Do that for a month, then add some.

1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:45.160
 That will build the capacity to do this.

1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:48.200
 And then that's going to start having the ability to strengthen, manage the foot.

1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:49.320
 And there's a whole lot of other stuff.

1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:54.360
 I've got videos on things that you can do by whatever you want or just, just spend some

1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:55.680
 time out of them.

1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:00.240
 Like, that's all that I want people to do because it is so simple and it has such a

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:01.240
 profound impact.

1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:02.240
 Yeah, it does.

1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:06.720
 I, what I did, uh, I noticed when you walked out, when I walked in, I was like, Oh, Hey,

1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:10.120
 you're spending some time without the last shoes on.

1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:15.440
 Uh, well, what I did, um, I think it's already now two years ago and I was doing a lot of

1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:16.440
 running.

1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:17.960
 I do like a 10 mile run.

1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:22.300
 I would take my shoes off for the last like half mile and I run like that.

1:52:22.300 --> 1:52:27.240
 And that was for me really helpful to ensure that I have proper form.

1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:29.680
 Form that minimizes pain on the way I run.

1:52:29.680 --> 1:52:31.080
 I still like shoes.

1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:36.400
 I benefit a lot from shoes, the protection they provide, but it's for running we're referring

1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:40.640
 to, uh, especially trail running and so on.

1:52:40.640 --> 1:52:44.200
 And in the city when there's glass and all those kinds of things, uh, but it's really

1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:47.000
 important to have minimal sort of protection on your feet.

1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:54.120
 For me, at least it was to figure out the ways that my form basic movement and like

1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:59.680
 the positioning in the foot, the impact of the foot and everything, you know, the, the,

1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:06.360
 the lower leg, the entirety of the torso, really how it's improperly positioned in

1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:12.280
 terms for the objective of minimizing pain and the barefoot running really helped fix

1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:13.280
 that for me.

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:19.700
 Cause I figured out that I need to take shorter steps, more frequent, you know, all those

1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:20.700
 kinds of things.

1:53:20.700 --> 1:53:22.280
 And that really helps you figure that out.

1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:29.160
 Like let's be realist about stuff, like, um, spend some time using it, strengthen it.

1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:32.520
 And I've got some great ways to do that and learn how to do that.

1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:33.760
 So yeah.

1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:36.120
 What is a good diet for strength development?

1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:41.440
 I've just to give you some context, I've been eating mostly meat, not for strength, mostly

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:42.640
 for mental performance.

1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:44.040
 I just enjoy it.

1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:45.040
 Yes.

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:50.160
 You need to have a base level of protein building blocks for tissue, right?

1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:55.600
 We need to have enough fats to be able to have hormones work and key processes in the

1:53:55.600 --> 1:53:56.600
 body.

1:53:56.600 --> 1:54:00.960
 We need to have, well, you don't need to have from a performance aspect carbohydrates necessarily

1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:06.080
 because the other ones can convert into injury sources, but for a performance athlete, carbohydrates

1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:09.440
 can be very beneficial, uh, as well.

1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:15.480
 So, um, so I look at it as you want, you need a base level fats, you need a base level of

1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:19.720
 proteins and then you adjust the carbohydrate intake based on the needs.

1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:25.200
 I'm not anti carbohydrate by any means, um, cause a lot of people will, they look at me

1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:29.180
 now when they see like how lean I am and they, they jump to a conclusion, you must be keto.

1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:30.180
 You must be carnivore.

1:54:30.180 --> 1:54:31.180
 You must be whatever.

1:54:31.180 --> 1:54:37.640
 Like, so losing and gaining weight is simply eating less or eating more.

1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:41.640
 I mean it, ah, and it, we get so complicated.

1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:44.900
 Oh, that my fat, they're like, what's your fasting window?

1:54:44.900 --> 1:54:50.600
 If I'm, if I'm doing fasting, it's just because it works with my, my environment.

1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:51.600
 Sometimes I do it.

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:52.900
 Sometimes I don't.

1:54:52.900 --> 1:54:57.960
 All that does is control how much calories that you take big success with keto and carnivore

1:54:57.960 --> 1:54:58.960
 diets.

1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:05.400
 A lot, uh, and, and put on weight with those, with those diets, um, you know, protein actually

1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:07.080
 has a thermogenic effect.

1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:11.880
 And so you have to have a massive amount of fats if you have a only meat diet because

1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:13.940
 you can literally starve to death.

1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:18.560
 There's a, there's a show where they put people out in the wilderness and this guy, the one

1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.760
 that won, one of the ones I looked on, they threw him way like up in the, uh, uh, past

1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:26.280
 a lot, you know, out the way out there, there was nothing, but he somehow got a caribou

1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:27.320
 and killed it.

1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:32.080
 And he still lost a pound a day for 30 days with the caribou because his fat was stolen

1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.380
 by a, uh, uh, and, and he could eat all the meat he wanted and then he almost got pulled

1:55:37.380 --> 1:55:38.960
 because his weight loss.

1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:39.960
 Right.

1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:42.400
 Um, but that isn't actually a performance.

1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:45.480
 So those types of keto and carnivore are not performance diets.

1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:53.120
 So they're not going to be as effective at supplying, uh, the energy needs for high capacity

1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:54.120
 training.

1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:55.120
 So don't get me wrong.

1:55:55.120 --> 1:56:01.960
 I mean, you can be a successful, like elite athlete with a, with a vegan diet, but it's

1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:05.400
 not as easy to do it with other diets.

1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:11.600
 So on you're missing some base nutrients, so many nutrients and meat, I believe, uh,

1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:14.680
 having greens in your diet is really beneficial.

1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:18.040
 Lots of research, but there's people in the other worlds that argue that they don't need

1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:22.400
 them, but they help clear organs, provide micronutrients, all this sort of stuff.

1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:25.800
 So I eat simply a whole well rounded diet.

1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:32.640
 And I've gone from, I can go from 285 pounds squat and a ton of weight to eating less and

1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:37.240
 dropping all the way down to, you know, seven, 8% body fat with veins standing out everywhere

1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:43.960
 without a tissue on me, just with amazing, great tasting food to lose weight or be healthy

1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:48.980
 does not mean that you need to eat flavorless bland food.

1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:51.560
 So that's the main thing I try to get across.

1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:52.560
 Yes.

1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:53.560
 Eat less to lose weight.

1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:54.720
 Eat more to gain weight.

1:56:54.720 --> 1:56:55.720
 Yep.

1:56:55.720 --> 1:56:56.720
 Make sure that you've got enough protein.

1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:59.780
 Make sure that you've got your micronutrients covered, which is going to cover by eating

1:56:59.780 --> 1:57:01.320
 real food.

1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:03.380
 Don't go low fat, no fat.

1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:07.780
 If you want a performance, don't go no carb, but if it works, any of those things.

1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:13.920
 So diet approach, when you look at diets, understand that they're how aggressive they

1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:14.920
 are.

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:16.400
 So like keto can make you lose a lot of weight.

1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:17.760
 Carnivore can make you lose a lot of weight.

1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:21.840
 A lot of that upfront is actually dropping glycogen stores.

1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:25.720
 So you're actually just reducing water in your muscle and fat tissue.

1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:29.320
 So which is why it doesn't, isn't as great for a performance diet.

1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:37.080
 But understand that every diet also has a level of discipline and does it fit your lifestyle?

1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.020
 So I suggest people don't find a diet.

1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:44.160
 You need to find a lifestyle because that's what sustainable, I hate the word diet to

1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:46.280
 begin with.

1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:52.920
 But behaviors are sustainable and then do that and then over time the things you'll

1:57:52.920 --> 1:57:55.640
 get to where you need to get.

1:57:55.640 --> 1:58:02.280
 Diet itself, just by the name of it is not sustainable because it is a short term thing

1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:03.840
 to get somewhere.

1:58:03.840 --> 1:58:08.960
 Yeah, I tend to try to measure it because I definitely have a love heat relationship

1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:09.960
 with food.

1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:18.080
 I tend to look back and say like by following this particular protocol, lifestyle, whatever,

1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:19.720
 what was the level of happiness?

1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:20.720
 Yes.

1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:25.560
 So not like weight loss or weight gain or all those kinds of things.

1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:30.400
 It's the entirety of the picture, productivity, just feeling good throughout the day, socially

1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:32.800
 also, like interacting with people.

1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:37.840
 Because so much of a human connection, like I mentioned before, is over food.

1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:41.600
 And if you're going to limit yourself in that regard, you're limiting a certain fundamental

1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:43.040
 aspect of life.

1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:49.920
 A number of years ago, I did like 20 to 22 hour fasts every day.

1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:51.140
 And I'm like, well, this doesn't work.

1:58:51.140 --> 1:58:53.280
 I can't do business lunches and stuff like that.

1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:57.020
 So when I was in my fasting thing, I went to a 16 so I could have a light lunch just

1:58:57.020 --> 1:59:01.800
 for the social aspect of it and perform that.

1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:07.560
 And then that's why the typical bodybuilding, like the eight meal a day diet has never worked

1:59:07.560 --> 1:59:11.360
 for me because I've always been a very bit like trying to fit that between meetings and

1:59:11.360 --> 1:59:12.900
 other stuff.

1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:18.240
 What that diet provides is it just you get less bloat in distention of a larger meal.

1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:20.760
 But at the end of the day, you get the same exact results.

1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:26.160
 Pick a lifestyle, live that you can have really great tasting food.

1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:28.400
 And that to me is the same thing.

1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:32.640
 And this is why I'm like really hitting this point, because also with the dieting and like

1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:37.800
 the approach like, oh, I'm going to do this and people pick these chicken and broccoli

1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:39.480
 recipes and guess what?

1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:40.780
 You're going to break.

1:59:40.780 --> 1:59:46.920
 If you do not, if you do not enjoy it, you will break.

1:59:46.920 --> 1:59:50.480
 So it is a very important point.

1:59:50.480 --> 1:59:59.480
 Well, I also slightly push back or maybe to elaborate, if you don't enjoy moderation,

1:59:59.480 --> 2:00:05.920
 for me particularly, I have trouble moderating certain things, most foods, I would say.

2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:12.540
 So my source of happiness comes with foods, even if they're bland, the ones that can enjoy,

2:00:12.540 --> 2:00:13.540
 but enjoy moderation.

2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:16.280
 So there's, I mean, I enjoy every piece of food.

2:00:16.280 --> 2:00:23.840
 So it's like, it's if you can enjoy the full lifestyle, it's not just the particular experience,

2:00:23.840 --> 2:00:26.120
 but like the full journey.

2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:29.480
 Does it fit your lifestyle?

2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:37.080
 So let me ask about a complicated topic that's sometimes a bit controversial, which is steroids

2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:42.040
 and maybe TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.

2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:44.000
 What role does that play in strength training?

2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:45.460
 All right.

2:00:45.460 --> 2:00:47.200
 We're going to go there.

2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:48.200
 Let's go there.

2:00:48.200 --> 2:00:49.200
 Yeah.

2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:52.580
 But it's an important discussion to have.

2:00:52.580 --> 2:00:58.000
 I think that it's something that I can be more transparent on.

2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:01.740
 In my past, I wasn't able to do to the career that I had.

2:01:01.740 --> 2:01:09.080
 So just like covering that stuff in a, you know, one of the, on a public forum when you're

2:01:09.080 --> 2:01:14.600
 highly looked at being an executive for recruiting and other stuff, like it was an area I had

2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:18.640
 to just kind of pass on, right?

2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:21.680
 Now I've used steroids.

2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:30.480
 I've used them since I was 33 and I basically just use TRT now after my big squat.

2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:38.080
 So for 10 years I used them and there's some interesting components to this.

2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:44.560
 So one is just the gray area of what we call performance enhancing supplements.

2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:55.200
 So performance was a PEDs that the line of what defines a PED is ever shifting and it's

2:01:55.200 --> 2:02:00.800
 shifting based on society norms, cultural norms, government body agencies, all these

2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:01.800
 sorts of stuff.

2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:03.040
 So I'm not making excuses here.

2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:08.080
 So I just want to elaborate before I actually start digging into the details here because

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:15.600
 performance enhancing, I could take sodium bicarbonate and enhance my ability to perform

2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:17.160
 deadlifts for reps.

2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:18.160
 Guess what?

2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:20.680
 I did that for my Guinness world record for deadlifts in a minute.

2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:21.680
 Okay.

2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:27.040
 People do it for rowing or other, they use a high capacity type stuff.

2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:28.680
 It is performance enhancing.

2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:35.200
 It is a chemical, it is baking soda, all right?

2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:40.440
 They're not able to make it illegal because everybody eats bread, well, not everyone.

2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:45.280
 And so it's a little hard to test for no matter what you do at any level.

2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:51.140
 So that's an extreme example, but other examples, you're drinking an energy drink in that cup

2:02:51.140 --> 2:02:56.440
 there a little while ago and in America you can get an energy drink with 240 milligrams

2:02:56.440 --> 2:02:57.920
 of caffeine in it.

2:02:57.920 --> 2:03:00.060
 In Canada, that's too dangerous.

2:03:00.060 --> 2:03:07.200
 You can only get 140, but you can go buy a ephedra and ephedra is illegal in America.

2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:10.400
 And so these things bounce back and forth all the time.

2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:20.160
 I could take Yohimbi and in Europe or Australia, it is a drug and classified and America, it

2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:21.160
 is not.

2:03:21.160 --> 2:03:26.480
 It's an herbal root in a lot, I actually have one of my supplements except for the overseas

2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:27.480
 version.

2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:34.920
 Anyway, the point I'm getting is no matter what you do at some point, by someone's standards,

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:37.600
 you are cheating.

2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:44.280
 And because it is, you're taking something that, but you could work around these things

2:03:44.280 --> 2:03:48.480
 with nutritional ways or other ways versus taking a chemical strip and there's whole

2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:52.080
 lots of ways to do this, but it's like, oh no, it's steroids, it's not, it's injectable,

2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:53.080
 it's not.

2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:57.780
 So somewhere there's a culture or a person that will say you're cheating no matter what.

2:03:57.780 --> 2:04:01.760
 So it's a self defined, you need to define it for yourself unless you're competing in

2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:07.440
 an organization that has testing, then it's a straight ethical thing and it's either right

2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:10.400
 or wrong in my opinion.

2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:16.560
 That's kind of the overall dilemma of it is if you want to see what you're totally capable

2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:24.480
 of, you have to decide yourself what's okay or not to that level.

2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:29.480
 There is no body that can say something yes or no.

2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:34.580
 When there's an event like the Olympics, maybe then you have a standard that you're all trying

2:04:34.580 --> 2:04:40.160
 to adhere to and then it makes sense to keep a certain, like to be within, there's an ethical

2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:41.160
 imperative.

2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:46.800
 So yeah, I'm not talking about that, I'm agreeing to compete in this by these rules.

2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:51.840
 Yeah, but when you're trying to maximize your own performance, whatever that journey is,

2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:57.920
 whatever that goal is, that's a different story and it's not easy to figure that out.

2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:00.800
 You're just like dancing around the subject, whatever.

2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:06.080
 Well guess what, I've got a prescription for growth hormone and testosterone.

2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:08.960
 It's legal for me to take and you know what?

2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:14.160
 A lot of the people that are in front of the camera in the media, politicians and news

2:05:14.160 --> 2:05:19.960
 people and the people that are there saying the no drug stuff, they're going to anti aging

2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:26.000
 clinics to look better and they have a prescription for growth hormone and testosterone themselves.

2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.880
 But in their eyes, it's okay.

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:34.680
 It is a prescription from their doctor because they have the money to do it.

2:05:34.680 --> 2:05:37.800
 So it's legal and it's fine.

2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:44.280
 If I is interesting in Oregon, anybody and I don't know what other states over the age

2:05:44.280 --> 2:05:51.440
 of 16 can without parents permission by the way, walk into a gender clinic and as a female

2:05:51.440 --> 2:05:54.520
 and get a prescription for testosterone.

2:05:54.520 --> 2:06:02.560
 But as an athlete, if I've got low testosterone, I am so flow, I've got depression, I can't

2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:04.000
 have sex with my wife.

2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:05.880
 It's affecting my quality of life.

2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:11.160
 I will have to fight tooth and nail to get testosterone just as a prescription and then

2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:15.880
 I will get kicked out of my organization for competing.

2:06:15.880 --> 2:06:18.120
 So you understand how gray this stuff gets.

2:06:18.120 --> 2:06:23.760
 Do you think the stigma on testosterone is the reason we're not having like a healthy

2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:26.360
 conversation about when it's proper?

2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:30.640
 Like what are the proper uses of testosterone in an athlete's life and just the regular

2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:32.000
 human life?

2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.240
 Yeah, absolutely.

2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:35.760
 And it's just, it's like anything.

2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:38.960
 It's like I said, it is lines that we pick and draw.

2:06:38.960 --> 2:06:42.440
 Anytime you put that out there, people are going to have different opinions where those

2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:43.440
 lines are.

2:06:43.440 --> 2:06:46.160
 So now when it comes to strength, here's an interesting thing.

2:06:46.160 --> 2:06:50.040
 In powerlifting, there's tested federations and non tested federations.

2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:55.360
 So we can literally look at the statistical data and actually find out what do steroids

2:06:55.360 --> 2:06:56.620
 do.

2:06:56.620 --> 2:07:03.160
 And so it's pretty clear that steroids provide about a 10% increase in strength on average

2:07:03.160 --> 2:07:04.880
 over not.

2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:09.040
 Now that does take out the fact that steroids will put you in, allow you to put on more

2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:12.920
 mass so you'll go up a weight class a lot of times.

2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:19.560
 So as a whole, you could definitely lift more probably than the 10% over time, right?

2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:23.400
 And then we think about steroids as the ability to just put on muscle.

2:07:23.400 --> 2:07:27.400
 And here's where things get a little interesting, even with people that use steroids is not

2:07:27.400 --> 2:07:31.360
 understanding the neurological impacts that steroids have.

2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:36.920
 Because you could take some steroids right now and be stronger in 10 minutes.

2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:42.140
 That's clearly not done anything, you know, from a physiology standpoint to make you stronger.

2:07:42.140 --> 2:07:46.920
 But we have a tapped in neurologically to to elicit those games.

2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:49.480
 And there's a whole lot that happens neurologically.

2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:56.320
 Like how much science is there in terms of all the different ways you could take steroids,

2:07:56.320 --> 2:08:03.080
 which kinds of steroids, the timing, the dose, the all of those things to develop the neurological,

2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:08.080
 the physical, the skeletal, like all the, you know, you've talked with such depth about

2:08:08.080 --> 2:08:16.080
 the science of strength building in terms of form, in terms of the equipment that you

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:17.080
 use.

2:08:17.080 --> 2:08:24.120
 It seems like a component, you know, the use of steroids should be an equal level of scientific

2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:26.040
 rigor when applying them.

2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:27.040
 It is.

2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:32.240
 Now, the research is harder to get because of what it is.

2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:36.320
 But there is a lot of research that was done when they were legal.

2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:40.240
 So they were legal up in through the through, I think, the mid 80s.

2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:48.680
 And so a lot of the classical high, high benefit to low risk steroids were studied.

2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:52.320
 And then since then, there's a lot of like designer steroids or new steroids that have

2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:58.040
 come up that don't have a lot of research around safety and risk and things of that

2:08:58.040 --> 2:08:59.040
 nature.

2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:04.360
 And we can't do that because it's, you know, because of the legality around these things.

2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:09.040
 But some of the stuff on the neurological function is really just understanding how

2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:15.040
 that chemical structure works and what it's doing to the neurotransmitters, what it's

2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:17.060
 doing.

2:09:17.060 --> 2:09:23.920
 And so some of it is is really talking to people that have experience with it.

2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:27.020
 And the other is understanding those structures and what they do.

2:09:27.020 --> 2:09:33.600
 The neurological component, I think, is more interesting than than most, because the most

2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:37.080
 steroids act through increasing muscle protein synthesis.

2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:42.700
 That's how you add more muscle is they have an anti catabolic effect and they have a muscle

2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:45.440
 protein synthesis enhancing effect.

2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:49.560
 So it reduces the amount of muscle that you waste and increases the amount of muscle that

2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:51.520
 you put on.

2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:59.120
 But the neurological component is is tremendously valuable for what it can do for your training

2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:00.120
 workout.

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:04.760
 Like if I handle more load over time, I'm going to make more progress.

2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:09.040
 If I can actually just stimulate more neurological effects for a specific event, it's going to

2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:10.920
 have an impact.

2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:11.920
 Right.

2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:14.520
 But there's other ways that you can tap into this, too.

2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:18.040
 Things that you can tap into mentally with great practice, with meditation and other

2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:21.680
 stuff that will have the same effect.

2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:25.480
 People probably think I'm over speaking, especially steroid users that are listening to this.

2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:29.400
 Well, at least I'm talking out my ass, but I'm not.

2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:34.920
 Because I I have experience with this stuff on both ends.

2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:39.360
 And some of those areas, a lot of people don't have the experience with that.

2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:44.800
 What I've kind of heard from people is the confidence that comes with steroids.

2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:50.280
 It feels like not to call it placebo, but it seems like the psychological benefits of

2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:57.840
 steroids is huge and that you feel like there's a confidence that seems to be coupled with

2:10:57.840 --> 2:11:00.440
 the actual biological and chemical effects.

2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:03.300
 I have actually a neurological condition.

2:11:03.300 --> 2:11:06.860
 So I actually don't feel a lot of that stuff that people because there are certain steroids

2:11:06.860 --> 2:11:14.680
 that like people like you're like very extreme ones, like that would make somebody bite someone's

2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:21.120
 ear off in a fight, for example, almost like aggression that and they literally do nothing.

2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:26.840
 I'm like always just chillin and I don't like that effect.

2:11:26.840 --> 2:11:31.040
 But but neurologically, they're still having those effects, but I don't get those feels

2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:34.340
 that other people have from those.

2:11:34.340 --> 2:11:39.800
 But yes, there's that immediate boost in aggression and a confidence and stuff that come with

2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.800
 a lot of those ones that deal on the neurological overall as good sense of well being, just

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:49.120
 like from being on testosterone, like it's going to affect your mood.

2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:50.120
 And it's interesting.

2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:53.960
 So testosterone replacement therapy, if we walk down that path now and kind of switch

2:11:53.960 --> 2:12:02.000
 gears, you know, we find that men today have declining testosterone over what has historically

2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:03.000
 been in the past.

2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:08.960
 So right now, I think a thirty five year old testosterone is shown to be about half what

2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:12.540
 it was just 50 years ago.

2:12:12.540 --> 2:12:15.660
 So I don't know if we could argue the point.

2:12:15.660 --> 2:12:21.360
 We don't really have the science to validate any of it, but it could be society as far

2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:26.840
 as the impact that it's having on the mental health for men.

2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:31.720
 It could be the the estrogens floating around in the water from all the chemicals and birth

2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:36.640
 control and all this sort of stuff could be a lot of things.

2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:42.080
 But it is a fact that average testosterone is significantly lower and that is going to

2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:47.040
 end up affecting life, quality of life, as well as your longevity, because it will affect

2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:48.040
 those things.

2:12:48.040 --> 2:12:53.000
 But on the other end, steroids and TRT, particularly steroids, come with a lot of negative health

2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:58.160
 benefits, not benefits, a lot of negative health ramifications.

2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:02.760
 And so, you know, if I knew what I know now, I don't know that I would have gone that path.

2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:03.760
 I didn't.

2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:07.560
 I didn't till I was thirty three, which is kind of an outlier for a strength athlete.

2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:13.680
 I was I was a four times body weight deadlifter, eight hundred plus pounds at one ninety eight.

2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:18.720
 And it's pretty dang strong before I went down that path.

2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:21.100
 And that's because I wanted to see what I was capable of.

2:13:21.100 --> 2:13:24.640
 But I was reaching a point that it was either I need to do that or not.

2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:30.480
 My testosterone, my natural testosterone levels were actually I think below 300 is actually

2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:31.480
 the threshold.

2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:35.640
 So I was being told to go on TRT for the last couple of years, probably just because I was

2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:38.600
 pushing so hard and the stress level was driving my test down.

2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:41.700
 So it was self imposed more than likely.

2:13:41.700 --> 2:13:46.000
 But I put it off because I wanted to set all the drug free records and I set the ones that

2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.000
 I wanted.

2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:48.000
 And then it was thirty three.

2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:52.200
 I'm, you know, entering the age category and I'm like, I'm going to go on TRT.

2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:55.680
 I did not feel like I should be with TRT personally.

2:13:55.680 --> 2:14:00.600
 My ethical standard was I shouldn't be competing in tested events anymore.

2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:04.180
 There are federations that will allow you with your you show up with your script and

2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:08.100
 you do your test and you're below a certain level, but you're still on.

2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:09.520
 But for me, I'm like, that's not you.

2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:15.140
 So I'm like, I may as well at this point use steroids.

2:14:15.140 --> 2:14:19.880
 But since then, you know, understanding all those ramifications, you know, I might not

2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:24.280
 have gone down that route quite so fast and easily.

2:14:24.280 --> 2:14:29.340
 But I continued because I also have a lot of resources that other people don't and being

2:14:29.340 --> 2:14:32.840
 able to assess and understand and put things in place to mitigate that.

2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:33.880
 So you need to be.

2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:39.240
 And the other thing is, once you go on, it's literally a decision for life.

2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:45.480
 Not just but realistically is because your your quality of life, your feeling is going

2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:49.180
 to be enhanced quite a bit and you're not going to want to go back.

2:14:49.180 --> 2:14:53.120
 And if you go back, it's going to be less than it was before.

2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:54.900
 That's how the endocrine system works.

2:14:54.900 --> 2:14:58.600
 There are ways to try to recover and bring that up, but it might be a while.

2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:02.000
 And if you've been on for a while, it definitely is not an option.

2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:06.480
 So those are big things that people need to understand that you're going to have some

2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:07.480
 things in there.

2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:15.160
 And even TRT has some potential, especially at higher levels, that it's going to, you

2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:18.180
 know, increase the risk for prostate cancer.

2:15:18.180 --> 2:15:24.160
 It's going to potentially cause some hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart and some

2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:27.720
 potential plaque buildup of some of those key arteries around there that's going to

2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:30.800
 have an impact on your cardiovascular health.

2:15:30.800 --> 2:15:35.160
 There's things that you can do again, but everything is like the shoe story, right?

2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:40.440
 Where I'm anti anti shoe, but I'm going, well, we could put band aids on this.

2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:41.440
 So it's...

2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:45.840
 But there's a quality of life that comes with it, the increase in quality of life.

2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:50.040
 And if you do it correctly, I think for me, for me, I definitely would not live without

2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:53.120
 TRT, even with knowing what I know now.

2:15:53.120 --> 2:16:00.840
 It this age and the quality of life and being able to be there, have the energy, the recovery.

2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:04.920
 That's a big thing where all this, though, I talked about muscle protein synthesis and

2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:07.560
 anti catabolism as being big drivers.

2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:12.640
 But recovery is the other big aspect that they that they offer probably as a result

2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:17.240
 of those, but that's going to those are going to be the big enhancement.

2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:23.840
 So just doing steroids, steroids is going to increase all the other stuff that you do.

2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:28.000
 So if you if you have good training, if good diet, good quality of sleep, like all this

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:31.280
 other stuff, then you can take advantage of that.

2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.280
 But you could choose steroids and nobody would know.

2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:39.760
 And honestly, you go down to 24 hour fitness and you'll see a bunch of, you know, late,

2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:43.380
 you know, 19 to 21 year old kids that are all kind of red and one hundred and fifty

2:16:43.380 --> 2:16:46.440
 pounds that look like that don't look like anything.

2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:52.600
 And they're a bunch of them will be using steroids because they're not like.

2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:56.700
 So it's it's not the it's not going to make a champion, like you said, it's not going

2:16:56.700 --> 2:16:58.160
 to at most.

2:16:58.160 --> 2:16:59.160
 Guess what?

2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:00.160
 I was already at an elite level.

2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:05.960
 I was one of the best in the world before I started using it doesn't it doesn't do that.

2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:08.840
 It does a 10 percent increase at best.

2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:11.400
 And that's proven in the statistics, which is interesting because most people don't know

2:17:11.400 --> 2:17:12.400
 this.

2:17:12.400 --> 2:17:15.120
 Like it the data is right there.

2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:16.120
 Yeah.

2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:17.120
 Yeah.

2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:27.760
 And that's why I'm often saddened by maybe the negative view of somebody like Lance Armstrong,

2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:33.360
 who is one of the greatest athletes in history and everybody else that he was competing against.

2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:34.360
 I'm sorry.

2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:35.360
 Yeah.

2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:36.960
 I hate to blow anybody's bubble.

2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:41.380
 But regardless, if I told you my ethical pieces with saying that you're going to be at something

2:17:41.380 --> 2:17:44.840
 at an elite level.

2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:49.120
 You look at most a lot of those big figures out there.

2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:53.020
 When their income in your life relies on it, yeah, you're going to push those limits.

2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:58.600
 So maybe maybe my ethical would change if if if I was in that position, too, because

2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:02.880
 here's the thing where I believe like someone is.

2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:05.400
 I think people should avoid steroids.

2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:10.400
 TRT, probably something worth taking a look at what your levels are when you're in the

2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:14.160
 thirty five to forty five range and see what decision you decide to make from there.

2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:16.600
 And that's a decision that you make for the rest of your life.

2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:21.440
 The only times that you should be taking a look at steroids is if it's it's funding your

2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:22.440
 life.

2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:28.000
 It's creating that it is your job and it's doing like and honestly, it was for me.

2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.760
 I so was it the only thing?

2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:31.760
 No, no.

2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:38.320
 If you want to get into neurology, it's neurotransmitters and alcohol is really interesting discussion

2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:39.880
 on performance enhancement.

2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:45.400
 So when I lift heavy and so I always promote it, like not more than a drink or two, like

2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:48.840
 once or twice a month is what all I'm talking about when I'm what I'm saying.

2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:50.600
 So what's the timing of the drink?

2:18:50.600 --> 2:18:53.520
 Are we talking about three to five minutes before?

2:18:53.520 --> 2:18:54.520
 Yes.

2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:56.440
 And we're talking about beer.

2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:58.680
 It doesn't matter the the source.

2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.560
 So I shots are the easiest.

2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:05.680
 You want something that is not going to have some sort of regurgitory effect or bloating

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:09.520
 effect or anything like that, but you want to have the quick hit of energy.

2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:14.800
 So it's a preferential energy source moves above ketones, carbs, everything at seven

2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:15.880
 calories per gram.

2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:19.720
 But then there's some really interesting things that happen, spikes blood pressure, which

2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:21.660
 is going to make weights feel lighter.

2:19:21.660 --> 2:19:26.240
 So when you're in your early 20s and you're trying to hit up, you know, some attractive

2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:30.980
 person at the bar, you're with your buddies and you're like, you know, and you got second

2:19:30.980 --> 2:19:31.980
 guess.

2:19:31.980 --> 2:19:32.980
 Oh, should I?

2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:33.980
 Should I?

2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:36.880
 And they go, have a shot of liquid courage and you have one.

2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:41.560
 And all of a sudden the second thoughts, the second guessing all that drops away.

2:19:41.560 --> 2:19:46.040
 Like you're focused in the moment and you walk over and you actually perform a little

2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:48.200
 better like conversation wise than you normally would.

2:19:48.200 --> 2:19:51.000
 Now if you have five or six and then go over, you're gonna make a fool of yourself.

2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:52.720
 So it's all about timing and amount.

2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:54.560
 But there is a reason that that happens.

2:19:54.560 --> 2:19:58.320
 So anyway, I'm known for promoting this whiskey and deadlift concept.

2:19:58.320 --> 2:19:59.320
 I love this.

2:19:59.320 --> 2:20:00.320
 But it works.

2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:01.960
 It's like the Eastern block.

2:20:01.960 --> 2:20:02.960
 That's where it came.

2:20:02.960 --> 2:20:03.960
 That's where I stole it from.

2:20:03.960 --> 2:20:08.720
 Because I was watching all these Russian lifters would have a shot of vodka or something before

2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:09.720
 they go lift.

2:20:09.720 --> 2:20:11.280
 And I'm like, there's something here.

2:20:11.280 --> 2:20:14.920
 So I started experimenting with it and I'm like, that works.

2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:16.000
 And then I started researching.

2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:17.200
 Nobody talks about this stuff.

2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:21.360
 So it takes a while to start piecing together all the stuff that actually happens to make

2:20:21.360 --> 2:20:22.540
 that happen.

2:20:22.540 --> 2:20:28.280
 But it moves away the things that you're going to, the concerns about the ramifications in

2:20:28.280 --> 2:20:29.600
 the future and the other stuff.

2:20:29.600 --> 2:20:34.960
 So the, um, but brings you into the moment and then the dopamine hit and the other, and

2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:37.560
 then it enhances whatever mood that you're in.

2:20:37.560 --> 2:20:45.060
 But all of a sudden you get in the state much easier.

2:20:45.060 --> 2:20:49.840
 And so it's really, really interesting, but it's very, it's a very small amount needed

2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:55.000
 and very time sensitive, but it can be so much more powerful than like drugs people

2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.140
 use for this stuff.

2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:01.800
 It ties really together with meditative state and other pieces to, to, to get you into that

2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:07.480
 flow state, those thoughts about failure, what if, what, like all that you, you get

2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:13.040
 into that zone, that moment, that time anyway.

2:21:13.040 --> 2:21:14.040
 So interesting.

2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:18.640
 An alcoholic is promoting out, you know, but there's an important point here, which not

2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:19.640
 often talked about.

2:21:19.640 --> 2:21:24.240
 I think it is fascinating that because you can get into so much trouble with alcohol

2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:29.640
 when used in excess, people don't often talk about the, the positive aspects of alcohol,

2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:34.280
 even in your college years.

2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:37.440
 It had a, it had a lasting effect on who I am as a person.

2:21:37.440 --> 2:21:41.080
 I don't think people give enough credit to the positive aspect.

2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:45.320
 See, you could have accomplished a lot of those same things with a little more moderation,

2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:50.920
 which I think people should talk about more, which is like the way to open up a personality,

2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:56.720
 like the flowering of the full character and the weirdness and the, the, the, like the

2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:00.160
 beauty of who you are as a human being could be opened up with alcohol.

2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:01.800
 And that's really interesting to think about.

2:22:01.800 --> 2:22:10.080
 You should try some podcasts with a, with a shot and, and these, I do this sometimes

2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:15.600
 with myself and guests and it will change the conversation, lubricates the conversation.

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:20.080
 Definitely not the excess and which is what I learned because I went all the way in because

2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:22.160
 I do everything at extremes.

2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:28.840
 So it was a really hard lesson that took me a lot of time to unwind, but it is interesting

2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:33.160
 and people don't discuss those things because it's, it's either this or this.

2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:37.020
 You're one of the greatest strength athletes of all time.

2:22:37.020 --> 2:22:43.760
 So it's worthwhile to consider how you optimize the, the feats of strength that you reach

2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:47.080
 for with things like steroids.

2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:52.120
 It makes perfect sense and I think that was a, from my perspective, I think it was probably

2:22:52.120 --> 2:22:53.120
 the right decision.

2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:58.640
 You've achieved something incredible that inspires a huge number of people.

2:22:58.640 --> 2:22:59.640
 That's it.

2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:03.360
 And you've shown to yourself and to the world, but what the human body can accomplish.

2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:04.360
 Yep.

2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:05.360
 That's incredible.

2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:10.360
 And no matter if I push to a less weight and if I disclosed everything that I did and

2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:15.400
 I didn't, when I wasn't using steroids, in my opinion, if we went through everything,

2:23:15.400 --> 2:23:18.760
 there would people that would say, you're using performance enhancing, no matter what,

2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:20.480
 like it is, it's straight up.

2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:22.320
 So you just need to be okay with it yourself.

2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:27.980
 And so I had to make the call, I want to see what the true potential is of every, let's

2:23:27.980 --> 2:23:32.920
 throw everything out the window that I feel unless I feel it's a risk from a, from a health

2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:36.040
 standpoint that I'm not willing to take on.

2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:41.520
 And because that's, how do I like, it's just picking and choosing and it's just picking

2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:42.520
 and choosing.

2:23:42.520 --> 2:23:43.920
 I here's what I want to know.

2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:45.880
 This is what I want to be able to try to achieve.

2:23:45.880 --> 2:23:48.760
 And so, yeah, yeah, that's what I did.

2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:50.680
 And what you did is incredible.

2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:52.400
 Like it's, it's just awe inspiring.

2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:54.400
 And what Lance Armstrong did was incredible.

2:23:54.400 --> 2:23:55.400
 Yeah.

2:23:55.400 --> 2:23:57.160
 And that, and that, and that aged me up.

2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:01.040
 And what's funny is the people that bash them are like on the media or politicians or maybe

2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:03.320
 some actors and guess what?

2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:06.560
 A ton of them are doing the same thing.

2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:08.080
 It's hypocrisy at its finest.

2:24:08.080 --> 2:24:09.080
 Trust me.

2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:13.320
 But how many, how many of those figures you're watching in movies that love to talk, you

2:24:13.320 --> 2:24:18.800
 know, be, you know, be political and do this and the news and all this, I'm telling you

2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:26.240
 they're, they're anti aging clinics, like all over California and everywhere else.

2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:28.760
 Who do you think is, keeps them in business?

2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:29.920
 It's not the competitive lifter.

2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:30.920
 I'll tell you that.

2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:38.000
 And they're using peptides and also, and SARMs and all sorts of like.

2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:39.480
 You're speaking to the hypocrisy.

2:24:39.480 --> 2:24:44.040
 I also want to speak to the fact, you know, somebody who's a friend of mine, David Goggins.

2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:45.040
 I don't know if you know what that is.

2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:46.040
 Yeah.

2:24:46.040 --> 2:24:48.500
 Ultra marathon runner, Navy seal.

2:24:48.500 --> 2:24:49.500
 He gets.

2:24:49.500 --> 2:24:50.500
 Pretty incredible person.

2:24:50.500 --> 2:24:51.500
 Yeah.

2:24:51.500 --> 2:24:52.500
 Incredible human being.

2:24:52.500 --> 2:24:56.800
 And he gets criticism like, you know, what you're doing is, is bad for the body.

2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.760
 You know, you're, you're pushing yourself too far.

2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:07.160
 I find that the people that criticize are often people that haven't truly pushed themselves

2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:08.160
 to the limit.

2:25:08.160 --> 2:25:11.220
 They haven't actually worked hard in their life.

2:25:11.220 --> 2:25:18.300
 When you work hard, you realize how incredible it is that a human being can dedicate themselves

2:25:18.300 --> 2:25:25.760
 so fully to an effort the way you did, the way David Goggins does the way, the way the

2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:27.740
 greatest athletes do.

2:25:27.740 --> 2:25:33.720
 And there's nothing that should be said beyond just sitting back in awe that humans can achieve

2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:34.720
 that.

2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:40.160
 That inspires me to do the best, whatever the hell I do, to be the best version of that.

2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:47.520
 There's something about like athletic feats, especially like strength that just inspire

2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:51.460
 us to do the best, to be the best version of ourselves.

2:25:51.460 --> 2:25:52.600
 I don't know.

2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:58.820
 That's the only thing you should be saying as opposed to criticizing some little detail

2:25:58.820 --> 2:26:00.600
 of this and that.

2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:05.520
 It's just awe inspiring that you push yourself to anybody that is at that level.

2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.320
 And this is funny, like in competitive sports, like you go online and people, it's just bash,

2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:10.880
 bash, bash, bash, bash, bash, bash.

2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:16.920
 You go talk to anybody, anybody, anybody that's a high level athlete within that field.

2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:20.220
 And nobody has a single bad thing to say about each other.

2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:25.360
 But all this chitter chatter down there, I mean, I know exactly what you're saying.

2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:30.840
 So if you, I would say, cause I have love for all those folks, especially when you're

2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:36.440
 younger, you have a little bit of that desire to criticize others.

2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:40.120
 I think that should be channeled in improving your own life.

2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:46.840
 Anytime that you feel that way, that is when you need to turn inward and it's hard to do,

2:26:46.840 --> 2:26:53.040
 but there is a reason that you have those emotions around someone else and what they're

2:26:53.040 --> 2:27:00.680
 doing that you have an opportunity to look at yourself and know why you feel that way.

2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:01.720
 And that, guess what?

2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:02.940
 That's going to be the hard thing to do.

2:27:02.940 --> 2:27:03.940
 That's going to be the thing.

2:27:03.940 --> 2:27:09.400
 Again, that's stirring you a little bit because it's so much easier to sit there and, or talk

2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:14.620
 to your confidant or whatever instead of go, why does that bother me?

2:27:14.620 --> 2:27:19.600
 Why does what that person doing or what that person's achieving bother me?

2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:29.600
 It's like a difficult question that I often ask others, whether it's better to work hard

2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:31.200
 or work smart.

2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:36.960
 I like to ask that question because it helps me get a sense of the human being.

2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:45.800
 And I think I, let me just say like, I often, I often like people that answer that would

2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:49.800
 work hard.

2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:56.480
 Even though the quote unquote right answer is work smart, meaning like finding the optimal

2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:03.680
 efficient way to achieve a certain goal, I find that people that answer work smart don't

2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:08.660
 actually find the optimal efficient way to achieve a goal.

2:28:08.660 --> 2:28:15.060
 It seems like the people that at least certainly early in life strive to work their ass off,

2:28:15.060 --> 2:28:21.000
 even that means doing the inefficient, the dumb thing, just to learn the mistake.

2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:27.360
 The spirit behind the human spirit behind the person that says, or a card is the one

2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:31.640
 I connect with, but I'm torn, especially in the, in the war culture, in the tech sector

2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:38.220
 where people answer work smart, what would you, what would you say about that tension?

2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:44.160
 This definitely encompasses like, I'm the intellectual and I'm the meathead.

2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:51.800
 I'm the work around the clock and go fix the processes and make it so much better type

2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:52.800
 person.

2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:53.800
 Right.

2:28:53.800 --> 2:28:54.800
 That's, that's, that's me in a whole, that's everything.

2:28:54.800 --> 2:28:55.800
 That's my life story.

2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:56.800
 Right.

2:28:56.800 --> 2:29:00.920
 Busting your ass to find the easiest way possible to both.

2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:11.120
 So like I will, I will build a custom hydraulic cart that will lift my plates up to the height

2:29:11.120 --> 2:29:14.120
 of my, my squat.

2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:18.280
 So that I can minimize a roll it over next to it and then minimize the effort of it going

2:29:18.280 --> 2:29:26.120
 on and off to be able to lift the most amount of weight as possible so, so that I can save

2:29:26.120 --> 2:29:31.100
 the energy from here, from lifting those up and the fatigue of my back being in bad position.

2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:35.040
 So I can nearly kill myself over here.

2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:36.360
 Right.

2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:42.320
 I, my wife, anybody will say, I'm a workaholic.

2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:47.520
 And the first thing that I would do when it would be doing a company, a company turnaround,

2:29:47.520 --> 2:29:49.960
 they'd hire me, come in and I would be taking over.

2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:54.800
 So for someone that wasn't successful, but it was usually hardly ever for lack of want

2:29:54.800 --> 2:29:55.800
 or trying.

2:29:55.800 --> 2:30:00.000
 So a lot of times they knew they were unsuccessful and they were running around working six,

2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:05.320
 seven days a week, 12 hour days doing so much and it'd be like, well, you need to do this.

2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:09.520
 And they train me on like all the reports and this and all the things and like, good

2:30:09.520 --> 2:30:11.440
 luck, good luck.

2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:12.880
 I couldn't do it.

2:30:12.880 --> 2:30:17.720
 And the first thing I would do is nothing.

2:30:17.720 --> 2:30:27.800
 I would do nothing because then I would find what actually keeps coming back, the things

2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:31.820
 that I need to do and how much of it was filling the space.

2:30:31.820 --> 2:30:37.760
 Because so much of human nature when you're failing is to make yourself feel like you're

2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:38.940
 accomplishing thing.

2:30:38.940 --> 2:30:44.080
 This is when things go on your list, on your checklist and you start like rolling up.

2:30:44.080 --> 2:30:47.240
 So you're running around just getting shit done.

2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:48.240
 Yeah.

2:30:48.240 --> 2:30:49.240
 Being busy.

2:30:49.240 --> 2:30:50.240
 Right.

2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:57.520
 And so, but at the same time, like find somewhere in my career, something I've done where I

2:30:57.520 --> 2:31:04.200
 haven't outworked everybody, just so much on distilling things down to what's important.

2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:14.380
 And you've got to make time to sit back and assess and think and be introspective.

2:31:14.380 --> 2:31:20.400
 You have to make time for this because if not, you're going to waste so much time sitting

2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:28.200
 there walking sideways when all you got to do is move just one step in front of the other

2:31:28.200 --> 2:31:29.200
 each day.

2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:30.200
 Just one.

2:31:30.200 --> 2:31:38.240
 And I say, because it's going to add up, but you could spend six months knocking shit out,

2:31:38.240 --> 2:31:44.520
 doing your routine, busting your ass and not take that one step.

2:31:44.520 --> 2:31:46.960
 So you've got to distill stuff down.

2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:50.600
 You've got to really understand like what's important to you in life and where you're

2:31:50.600 --> 2:31:51.600
 going.

2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:55.880
 And, uh, when you're looking at anything in your life, the first thing that you need to

2:31:55.880 --> 2:32:02.920
 do is figure out, do I need to do it and just quit doing it, just quit doing things in your

2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:03.920
 life.

2:32:03.920 --> 2:32:11.440
 And you'll see that a lot of stuff that you think has to be done, doesn't have to be done.

2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:14.000
 You'd be surprised.

2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:15.480
 And then from there, this is the tech.

2:32:15.480 --> 2:32:16.480
 Okay.

2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:19.560
 And then of that, what can I, what can I automate?

2:32:19.560 --> 2:32:23.320
 What can I not have to do in a repeated fashion?

2:32:23.320 --> 2:32:28.260
 And then the last one, yeah, wherever possible, if it's not something that I'm adding tremendous

2:32:28.260 --> 2:32:32.920
 value to, like my uniqueness, people are like, oh, you must like do the auto work on your

2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:34.080
 vehicles cause you love working.

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:35.080
 I'm like, fuck that.

2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:36.080
 I don't.

2:32:36.080 --> 2:32:37.080
 And they're like, what?

2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:38.080
 That doesn't make any sense.

2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:44.700
 And I'm like, no, I love creating things, but I don't want to do that stuff.

2:32:44.700 --> 2:32:50.560
 So you could use delegating if you're a manager position, but it's outsourcing, whatever it

2:32:50.560 --> 2:32:51.560
 is.

2:32:51.560 --> 2:32:56.800
 But there are also so many things this, and this, this ties back to your point, uh, around

2:32:56.800 --> 2:32:58.440
 just doing it.

2:32:58.440 --> 2:33:03.120
 There's a point to like experiencing all levels to really understand things.

2:33:03.120 --> 2:33:07.640
 You need to spend time at the same time doing all those things.

2:33:07.640 --> 2:33:13.320
 Cause there could be good, huge, massive gaps in there that you're not aware of that are

2:33:13.320 --> 2:33:17.360
 key for you or key to be having done different or so on.

2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:24.600
 So um, like in my company days, I was one of the few executives that came in that could

2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:31.840
 do anything on the floor from code to machine, run away, the mill weld, do all step into

2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:40.080
 engineering, like, and, and that added tremendous value to me to having had spent time being

2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:45.760
 a doer and not enough people want to be, you've got to just go do shit.

2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:52.000
 You need to spend time in your life chopping wood, you need to have experience trying and

2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:58.720
 doing all these things that you would never like my skillset is massive because I want

2:33:58.720 --> 2:34:01.960
 to know, like you need to have those touch points.

2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:12.000
 My job, my title is chief visionary, but I've spent time doing everything.

2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:16.080
 It's not about just like creating this amazing strategy or vision.

2:34:16.080 --> 2:34:21.260
 And I'm just going to be there in this person that directs and like, like you can't be effective.

2:34:21.260 --> 2:34:27.080
 You cannot connect the dots unless you've been in the moment with everything.

2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:28.080
 Yeah.

2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:29.080
 Low level stuff.

2:34:29.080 --> 2:34:34.640
 Sometimes it's doing stupid shit that you're not uniquely qualified to do that anybody

2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:36.440
 could do, but you did it anyway.

2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:38.380
 Just the training environment.

2:34:38.380 --> 2:34:42.840
 People hit me up at a, at a, at a school or wherever like, Hey, how do I get into, I want

2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:45.200
 to grow my, grow my brand online.

2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:46.200
 I want to do this.

2:34:46.200 --> 2:34:47.440
 Like, where do I, where do I start?

2:34:47.440 --> 2:34:52.560
 And I'm like, go get a job at planet fitness or 24 hour fitness.

2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:56.160
 They're like, but I want to, you know, where, how do I get, you know, recognized and write

2:34:56.160 --> 2:34:57.760
 articles and be an online coach.

2:34:57.760 --> 2:35:05.920
 I'm like, you need to go spend a few years one on one training people to learn like the

2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:09.760
 interaction, how people respond, there's base levels you have to do.

2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:13.120
 You've got to go work your way up from the ground.

2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:14.120
 Yeah.

2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:15.120
 I truly believe it.

2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:20.880
 Well, I think that's the hard work piece that I'm speaking to that I like it when people

2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:26.960
 have been humbled by the hardness of life, like how difficult it is to do stuff.

2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:30.040
 And it does, I went and got my MBA, I went to MIT.

2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:31.480
 I don't need to do that stuff.

2:35:31.480 --> 2:35:32.960
 I'm above that.

2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:33.960
 Yeah.

2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:34.960
 Yeah.

2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:40.400
 And since you've been humbled by doing those things, I feel like you can truly explore

2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:46.520
 the optimization that you're talking to, finding the ways where you're uniquely capable to

2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:48.600
 add value to the world.

2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:53.800
 And then, and then again, work your ass off to be the best in the world at that thing.

2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:54.800
 Yes.

2:35:54.800 --> 2:35:55.800
 So it's always,

2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:57.800
 But then don't waste your time on shit that's not aligned.

2:35:57.800 --> 2:35:58.800
 Yeah.

2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:02.560
 That's the only, so that's, I guess there's a lot of context I put around that, but.

2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:09.840
 Yeah, that was like a long answer to a, a long, beautiful answer to an unanswerable

2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:10.840
 question.

2:36:10.840 --> 2:36:15.520
 Do you have advice outside of all this discussion to young people today about career, about

2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:16.520
 life?

2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:20.880
 Since you've done so many things, you've overcome a lot of things.

2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:24.560
 Think high school, college student, thinking about what to do in their life.

2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:28.120
 Do you have advice for those guys and girls?

2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:29.120
 Yeah.

2:36:29.120 --> 2:36:30.120
 Yeah.

2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:34.160
 First is you don't have it figured out, so don't worry.

2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:35.160
 Just jump in.

2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:36.160
 Yeah.

2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:37.160
 Yeah.

2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:43.600
 We talked, you know, a lot about understanding your values and aligning all that stuff, but

2:36:43.600 --> 2:36:49.720
 you got to have a base level of start exploring and learning and just spending the time doing

2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:54.440
 like pick something, let me elaborate a little bit.

2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:55.440
 No, you know what?

2:36:55.440 --> 2:36:58.840
 A lot of people struggle with that aspect now because the choice, there's so much choice

2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:03.120
 it's difficult to pick something, but I think it does blow down to you should pick something

2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:04.120
 and don't worry about it.

2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:10.480
 And then, but within that you can start discovering the things that are there for you.

2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:17.480
 Like I, I talked about, I made this huge shift, I threw away whole life, but I don't regret

2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.440
 anything about that.

2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:23.040
 I wouldn't be where I was if I didn't walk through and learn those things.

2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:30.960
 And in fact, in the course of that, I learned just how much that inspiring people and helping

2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:35.240
 them realize the potential far beyond what they thought was capable.

2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:36.240
 And guess what?

2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:42.560
 That was leadership 101 in managing people base level, floor level, right?

2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:46.360
 And I got a lot out that was perfectly aligned with what, and that's what I realized.

2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:54.340
 It didn't matter what industry I was in or any of those other things, but I was able,

2:37:54.340 --> 2:37:59.480
 you can see so many things, there's so many paths that you can go down to help you realize

2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:01.320
 what those things are.

2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:06.360
 And you're going to be able to find a lot of those nuggets and develop those.

2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:14.600
 Do you think that I could have just gone to school and got out and started a globally

2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:21.120
 recognized brand within a few years without having been schooled in business while getting

2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:24.940
 paid for it by others for years?

2:38:24.940 --> 2:38:29.080
 And in fact, that entire time I knew that that's what I wanted to do, but I didn't go

2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:30.240
 out on it.

2:38:30.240 --> 2:38:35.240
 I mentored some of my friends along the same path to go, no, they're like, I'm ready.

2:38:35.240 --> 2:38:36.520
 I'm ready to go do this.

2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:39.000
 And I'm like, no, now you need to go get a job.

2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.160
 Yeah, you know, engineering management, design, all that stuff.

2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:44.000
 Go get a job as a manager now.

2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:45.080
 Like, oh, that's a step down.

2:38:45.080 --> 2:38:46.080
 I can't do that.

2:38:46.080 --> 2:38:47.080
 I'm like, go try it.

2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:49.000
 A couple of years later, oh my God, that was such a good move.

2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:50.680
 I didn't know what I didn't know.

2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:54.680
 And now they're an executive for freaking a fortune 500 company.

2:38:54.680 --> 2:39:00.320
 And the same thing, like I sat there knowing that I was getting a free education.

2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:03.800
 Don't stress yourself out as my, that's my advice.

2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:08.640
 Don't stress yourself out that you've got to have this perfect thing because this process

2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:12.720
 of understanding your values and the introspect, that takes time.

2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:16.160
 You can get a job where you're getting paid to learn.

2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:17.440
 Exactly.

2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:21.240
 That's a good deal before you launch on your own.

2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:24.040
 You mentioned going back to darkness.

2:39:24.040 --> 2:39:27.580
 I'm Russian, so I like going back to darkness.

2:39:27.580 --> 2:39:29.140
 You suffer from depression.

2:39:29.140 --> 2:39:31.240
 You consider suicide.

2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:33.320
 Do you ponder your own death these days?

2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:35.240
 Do you think about your mortality?

2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:37.560
 Are you afraid of death?

2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:42.160
 I definitely think about mortality.

2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:44.920
 And am I afraid of my own death?

2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:46.440
 It depends on the moment.

2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:52.840
 If I'm in the middle of a project, I definitely want to finish that project, man.

2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:57.180
 But I don't fear it so much.

2:39:57.180 --> 2:40:09.440
 I fear leaving my kids or my wife and not being able to be there for them.

2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:10.840
 That bothers me.

2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:18.840
 Outside of that, I know that I put everything into the life that I've lived.

2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:24.160
 Like you said, there's always more, but I've lived hard.

2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:28.400
 I've loved hard.

2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:36.360
 Every moment in my life, I've made connections and impacted people around me for the better.

2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:39.800
 And this tracks back, which is crazy when we were doing the documentary and they're

2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:43.800
 interviewing people through my whole life and the consistency of the themes of anyone,

2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:49.680
 like anything for Duffin, like just sure, I'll fly in from Boston.

2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:53.120
 These people, it was crazy.

2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:57.640
 Everybody had a story about me giving, just over and over.

2:40:57.640 --> 2:40:58.640
 And I didn't even really.

2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:00.760
 It's just the way you were.

2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:04.360
 I've been all in.

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:13.920
 I have a lot more I want to do, but I don't have things that regret have not done in like,

2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:15.240
 I don't fear it.

2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:16.240
 I don't fear it.

2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:17.240
 Yeah.

2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:21.200
 It's like the, I don't know if you know the Bukowski poem, go all the way, otherwise don't

2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:22.200
 even try.

2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:28.720
 It seems like you embody that poem and you've accomplished some incredible things and serve

2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:31.160
 as an inspiration to a huge number of people.

2:41:31.160 --> 2:41:33.080
 Chris, you're an amazing human being.

2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:37.480
 I'm really honored that you would spend your valuable time with me.

2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:39.160
 Thank you so much for talking with me today.

2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:40.160
 It was incredible.

2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:44.200
 I can't wait to check out all the cool stuff you've engineered with Kabuki Strength.

2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:47.880
 So I'm obviously, I love the, I love strength.

2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:49.080
 I love strength training.

2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:50.200
 I love the idea of strength.

2:41:50.200 --> 2:41:56.600
 I love the equipment and the engineering approach that you take to strength.

2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:02.520
 You're an incredible human, both on the things you've accomplished in terms of your own strength

2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:10.080
 feats and the kind of science and engineering you bring to the field that many others could

2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:11.080
 use.

2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:12.720
 So thank you so much for talking to me.

2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:13.720
 Thanks for having me on.

2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:17.120
 That was quite the final thing.

2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:18.880
 Thank you.

2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:23.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Duffin and thank you to Headspace,

2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:26.900
 Magic Spoon, Sun Basket and Ladder.

2:42:26.900 --> 2:42:30.400
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:34.720
 And now let me leave you with some words from Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:36.780
 Strength does not come from winning.

2:42:36.780 --> 2:42:39.560
 Your struggles develop your strengths.

2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:45.160
 When you go through hardship and decide not to surrender, that is strength.

2:42:45.160 --> 2:43:00.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
