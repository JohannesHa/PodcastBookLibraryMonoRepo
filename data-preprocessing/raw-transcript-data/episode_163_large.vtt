00:00.000 --> 00:03.220
 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein,

00:03.220 --> 00:05.740
 his fourth time on the podcast.

00:05.740 --> 00:10.060
 Both sadness and hope run through his heart and his mind,

00:10.060 --> 00:13.700
 and the result is a complicated, brilliant human being

00:13.700 --> 00:15.980
 who I am fortunate to call a friend.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.660
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:18.660 --> 00:22.460

00:32.100 --> 00:34.080
 As a side note, let me ask

00:34.080 --> 00:36.660
 that whenever we touch difficult topics in this

00:36.660 --> 00:40.420
 or other conversations, that you listen with an open mind

00:40.420 --> 00:43.980
 and forgive me or the guest for a misstep

00:43.980 --> 00:46.740
 in an imperfectly thought out statement.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.320
 To have any chance at truth,

00:48.320 --> 00:50.100
 I think we have to take risks

00:50.100 --> 00:52.740
 and make mistakes in conversation

00:52.740 --> 00:54.780
 and then learn from those mistakes.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.380
 Please try not to close your mind and heart to others

00:57.380 --> 01:00.940
 because of a single sentence or an expression of an idea.

01:00.940 --> 01:03.440
 Try to assume that the people in this conversation

01:03.440 --> 01:06.120
 or just people in general are good,

01:06.120 --> 01:08.700
 but not perfect and far from it,

01:08.700 --> 01:11.820
 but always striving to add a bit more love into the world

01:11.820 --> 01:13.780
 in whatever way we know how.

01:24.260 --> 01:28.520
 And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.860
 You often talk about getting off this planet

01:32.900 --> 01:35.980
 and I think you don't often talk

01:35.980 --> 01:40.980
 about extra terrestrial life, intelligent life out there.

01:41.140 --> 01:42.740
 Do you wonder about this kind of thing,

01:42.740 --> 01:44.980
 about intelligent civilizations out there?

01:44.980 --> 01:48.540
 I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.040
 In a certain sense, I do find that speculating

01:53.040 --> 01:55.820
 about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and space aliens

01:55.820 --> 01:57.100
 is kind of a recreation

01:57.100 --> 01:59.100
 for when things aren't going very well.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.540
 At least it gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.260
 So I worry about, for example,

02:06.260 --> 02:09.380
 the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.620
 You can't quite believe enough to go to church

02:11.620 --> 02:14.300
 or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend,

02:14.300 --> 02:17.900
 so then you just take up an interest in simulation theory

02:17.900 --> 02:19.140
 because that's something like what you do

02:19.140 --> 02:21.000
 for your job coding.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.220
 I do think that in some sense,

02:23.220 --> 02:26.360
 the issue of aliens is a really interesting one,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.460
 but has been spoiled by too much

02:28.460 --> 02:31.540
 sort of recreational escapism.

02:32.460 --> 02:36.780
 The key question that I find is let's assume

02:36.780 --> 02:40.220
 that it is possible to look out at the night sky

02:40.220 --> 02:43.700
 and see all of these distant worlds and then go visit them.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.300
 If that is possible, it's almost certainly possible

02:46.300 --> 02:51.300
 through some as yet unknown or not accepted theory

02:52.820 --> 02:54.520
 of physics beyond Einstein.

02:55.540 --> 02:59.200
 And I mean, it doesn't have to be that way, but probably is.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.180
 If that theory exists, there would be a percentage

03:04.180 --> 03:05.540
 of the worlds that have life

03:05.540 --> 03:07.520
 in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way

03:07.520 --> 03:11.500
 that would have encountered the ability to escape

03:11.500 --> 03:16.500
 soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom

03:17.220 --> 03:19.100
 at a minimum and whatever they have

03:19.100 --> 03:24.100
 that is probably analogous to the cell on that world.

03:24.420 --> 03:29.020
 So assuming that life is a fairly generic thing

03:29.020 --> 03:32.500
 that arises, probably not carbon based,

03:32.500 --> 03:33.660
 probably doesn't have DNA,

03:33.660 --> 03:37.180
 but that something that fits the pattern

03:37.180 --> 03:42.180
 of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation,

03:43.820 --> 03:45.500
 differential success.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.420
 And thereby constantly improving and so on

03:47.420 --> 03:50.120
 that through time, there'll be a trajectory

03:50.120 --> 03:53.180
 where there'll be something increasingly complex

03:53.180 --> 03:56.500
 and fascinating and beautiful like us humans, but much more.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.700
 That can also off gas whatever entropy it creates

03:59.700 --> 04:03.200
 to give an illusion that you're defeating thermodynamics.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.740
 So whatever these things are probably has an analog

04:05.740 --> 04:08.620
 of the biolipid layer so that cells can get rid

04:08.620 --> 04:11.220
 of the chaos on one side of the barrier

04:11.220 --> 04:12.860
 and keep order on the other.

04:12.860 --> 04:15.580
 Whatever these things are that create life,

04:15.580 --> 04:17.500
 assuming that there is a theory to be found

04:17.500 --> 04:21.060
 that allows that civilization to diversify,

04:22.420 --> 04:26.340
 we would have to imagine that such a civilization

04:26.340 --> 04:29.580
 might have taken an interest in its concept

04:29.580 --> 04:31.380
 of the universe and have come here.

04:31.380 --> 04:36.380
 They would come here, they would have a deep understanding

04:36.540 --> 04:38.220
 of the physics of the universe sufficient

04:38.220 --> 04:40.900
 to have arrived here.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.740
 Well, there's two questions,

04:41.740 --> 04:43.220
 whether they could arrive physically

04:43.220 --> 04:47.800
 and whether their information could be sent here

04:47.800 --> 04:50.460
 and whether they could gain information from us.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.780
 It's possible that they would have a way

04:53.780 --> 04:57.260
 of looking into our world without actually reaching it.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.540
 I don't know.

04:58.540 --> 05:03.340
 But yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world,

05:04.900 --> 05:07.720
 can be realized, if that's feasible,

05:07.720 --> 05:10.540
 then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true

05:10.540 --> 05:15.020
 and that somebody else should be here.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.220
 First of all, I wanna say this.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.900
 My purpose when I come on to your show

05:19.900 --> 05:24.180
 and I reframe the questions is not to challenge you.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.020
 I can sit inside all of those.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.680
 It's to give you better audio and video

05:27.680 --> 05:29.880
 because I think we've been on an incredible role.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.540
 I really love what you do.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.100
 And so I am trying to honor you by being as disagreeable

05:35.100 --> 05:36.560
 about frame breaking as possible.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.920
 I think some of your listeners don't understand

05:38.920 --> 05:40.500
 that it's actually a sign of respect

05:40.500 --> 05:43.260
 as opposed to some sort of a complex dynamic,

05:43.260 --> 05:46.780
 which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames

05:46.780 --> 05:48.280
 and that these are sort of offerings

05:48.280 --> 05:49.640
 to get the conversation started.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.140
 So let me try to break that frame

05:51.140 --> 05:52.460
 and give you something different.

05:52.460 --> 05:53.300
 Beautiful.

05:53.300 --> 05:58.300
 I think what's going on here is that I can prove effectively

06:00.420 --> 06:03.220
 that we're not thinking about this in very deep terms.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.820
 As soon as I say we've gotta get off this planet,

06:05.820 --> 06:07.540
 the number of people who assume

06:07.540 --> 06:12.540
 that I'm talking about faster than light travel is very high

06:12.700 --> 06:15.740
 and faster than light travel assumes some sort

06:15.740 --> 06:18.700
 of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken

06:20.340 --> 06:22.220
 by some small adjustment.

06:22.220 --> 06:24.740
 And I think that that's fascinating.

06:24.740 --> 06:27.560
 It shows me that our failure to imagine

06:27.560 --> 06:30.700
 what could be being said is profound.

06:30.700 --> 06:35.700
 We don't have an idea of all of the different ways

06:35.860 --> 06:39.640
 in which we might be able to visit distant worlds.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.980
 All we think about is, okay,

06:42.980 --> 06:45.380
 it must be Einsteinian space times

06:45.380 --> 06:48.220
 and then some means of exceeding the speed limit.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.420
 And it's just, it's fascinating to me

06:50.420 --> 06:55.420
 that we don't really have, we've lost the ability

06:55.940 --> 06:59.540
 to just realize we don't know the framework

06:59.540 --> 07:01.360
 and what does it even mean?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.140
 So one of the things I think about a lot

07:03.140 --> 07:05.660
 is worlds with more than one temporal dimension.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.540
 It's very hard to think about

07:08.540 --> 07:10.880
 more than one temporal dimension.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.820
 So that's a really strong mental exercise

07:14.820 --> 07:17.300
 of breaking the framework in which we think

07:17.300 --> 07:18.980
 because most of the frameworks

07:18.980 --> 07:20.980
 would have a single temporal dimension, right?

07:20.980 --> 07:22.900
 Well, first of all, most of the frameworks

07:22.900 --> 07:25.060
 in which we think would have no temporal dimension

07:25.060 --> 07:27.020
 would have pure, like in mathematics,

07:27.020 --> 07:30.340
 the differential geometry that Riemann came up with

07:30.340 --> 07:31.620
 in the 1800s.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.220
 We don't usually talk about

07:35.220 --> 07:37.940
 what we would call split signature metrics

07:37.940 --> 07:39.940
 or Lorentzian signature.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.740
 In fact, if it weren't for relativity,

07:41.740 --> 07:45.580
 this would be the most obscure topic out there.

07:45.580 --> 07:48.220
 Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature

07:48.220 --> 07:50.220
 and then there's this one freakish case

07:50.220 --> 07:52.060
 of relativity theory in physics

07:52.060 --> 07:55.760
 that uses this one time and the rest spatial dimensions.

07:56.940 --> 07:57.860
 Fascinating.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.100
 So it's usually momentary and just looking at space.

08:01.100 --> 08:05.420
 Yes, we have these three kinds of equations

08:05.420 --> 08:06.740
 that are very important to us.

08:06.740 --> 08:11.340
 We have elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic, right?

08:11.340 --> 08:15.140
 And so the idea is if I'm chewing gum

08:15.140 --> 08:20.140
 after eating garlic bread, when I open my mouth

08:20.820 --> 08:23.940
 and I've got chewing gum between my lips,

08:23.940 --> 08:27.040
 maybe it's gonna form an elliptic object

08:27.040 --> 08:29.100
 called a minimal surface.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.260
 Then when I pop that and blow through it,

08:31.260 --> 08:33.520
 you're gonna hear a noise that's gonna travel to you

08:33.520 --> 08:36.280
 by a wave equation, which is gonna be hyperbolic.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.940
 But then the garlic breath is gonna diffuse towards you

08:38.940 --> 08:41.220
 and you're eventually gonna be very upset with me

08:41.220 --> 08:44.040
 according to a heat equation, which will be parabolic.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.620
 So those are the three basic paradigms

08:46.620 --> 08:48.220
 for most of the work that we do.

08:48.220 --> 08:52.300
 And a lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic,

08:52.300 --> 08:54.700
 whereas the physicists are in the hyperbolic case.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.780
 And I don't even know what to do

08:55.780 --> 08:57.540
 about more than one temporal dimension

08:57.540 --> 08:59.920
 because I think almost no one studies that.

08:59.920 --> 09:04.140
 I can't believe you just captured much of modern physics

09:04.140 --> 09:05.820
 in the example of chewing gum.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.060
 Well, I have an off color one, which I chose not to share,

09:08.060 --> 09:11.140
 but hopefully the kids at home can imagine.

09:11.140 --> 09:16.140
 Okay, so, okay, that is the place where we come from.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.040
 Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility

09:19.040 --> 09:22.760
 of breaking the frameworks with two

09:22.760 --> 09:25.640
 versus zero temporal dimensions,

09:25.640 --> 09:27.120
 how do we even begin to think about that?

09:27.120 --> 09:29.600
 Well, let's think about it as you and I getting together

09:29.600 --> 09:31.920
 in New York City, okay?

09:31.920 --> 09:36.600
 So if you tell me, Eric, I wanna meet you in New York City,

09:36.600 --> 09:41.400
 go to the corner of, I don't know, 34th Street

09:41.400 --> 09:43.960
 and Third Avenue, and you'll find a building

09:43.960 --> 09:48.620
 on the Northwest corner and go up to the 17th floor, right?

09:48.620 --> 09:51.520
 So when we have Third Avenue, that's one coordinate,

09:51.520 --> 09:53.680
 34th Street, that's the second coordinate,

09:53.680 --> 09:55.160
 and go up to the 17th.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.080
 And what time is it?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.020
 Oh, 12 noon.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.880
 All right, well, now imagine that we traded the ability

10:01.880 --> 10:03.920
 to get up to a particular height in a building

10:03.920 --> 10:05.240
 and it's all flat land,

10:05.240 --> 10:07.400
 but I'm gonna give you two temporal coordinates.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.360
 So meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon

10:11.360 --> 10:13.400
 at the corner of 34th and Third.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.120
 That gets to be too mind blowing.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.280
 I've got two separate watches.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.600
 And presumably that's just specifying a single point

10:20.600 --> 10:22.540
 in those two different dimensions,

10:22.540 --> 10:25.520
 but then being able to travel along those dimensions.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.060
 Let me see your right hand.

10:28.740 --> 10:30.300
 You have no watch on that.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.140
 No.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.900
 Okay, I'm very concerned, Lex,

10:32.900 --> 10:36.760
 that you're going through life without a wristwatch.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.720
 That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.940
 I want you to wear it.

10:40.940 --> 10:45.200
 This guy is funnier than basically any human on Earth.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.120
 Lex, that has been in my family for months.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.160
 It's a Fitbit.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.560
 Now, what I want you to understand is Lex Fridman

10:53.560 --> 10:57.440
 is now in a position to live in two spatial

10:57.440 --> 11:00.400
 and two temporal dimensions unlike the rest of us.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.760
 I clearly am only fit for four spatial dimensions.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.920
 So I'm frozen, whereas you can double move.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.620
 I can double move, which is funny

11:09.620 --> 11:12.760
 because this is set in Austin time.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.360
 So it's 4 p.m. and this is set in Los Angeles time.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.920
 Well, but that's just with an affine shift in mod 12.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.140
 But my point is, wouldn't that be interesting

11:22.140 --> 11:23.520
 if there were two separate time scales

11:23.520 --> 11:25.680
 and you had to coordinate both of those,

11:25.680 --> 11:27.200
 but you didn't have to worry about what floor

11:27.200 --> 11:30.320
 of the building because everything was on the ground floor.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.780
 That is the confusion that we're having.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.600
 And if you do one more show, right,

11:36.600 --> 11:38.040
 then they're gonna put a watch on your ankle

11:38.040 --> 11:40.160
 and you're only gonna have one spatial dimension

11:40.160 --> 11:41.040
 that you can move around.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.360
 But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors

11:45.360 --> 11:48.200
 of my theory in case we're interested in that,

11:48.200 --> 11:50.160
 which is geometric unity.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.700
 There is a two, two sector and a three, one and a one, three

11:53.700 --> 11:55.380
 and a zero, four and a four, zero.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.600
 And all of these sectors have some physical reality.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.440
 We happen to live in a one, three sector.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.920
 But that's the kind of thinking that we don't do.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.660
 When I say we have to get off this planet,

12:06.660 --> 12:08.640
 people imagine, oh, okay, it's just Einstein

12:08.640 --> 12:10.940
 plus some ability to break the law.

12:10.940 --> 12:14.160
 By the way, even though you did this for humor's sake,

12:14.160 --> 12:19.160
 I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin who.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.840
 Am I gonna get whacked?

12:20.840 --> 12:23.000
 No, not quite.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.600
 But he was given a Super Bowl ring to look at

12:27.600 --> 12:29.920
 and he, instead of just looking at it,

12:29.920 --> 12:32.440
 put it on his finger and walked away with it.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.280
 Rubbercraft?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.120
 Rubbercraft, that's right.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.160
 So in the same way, I will, if you don't mind,

12:38.160 --> 12:39.500
 walk away with this Fitbit

12:39.500 --> 12:42.080
 and taking the entirety of your life story with it

12:42.080 --> 12:43.880
 because there's all these steps on it.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.880
 Boy, have you lost a lot of weight.

12:45.880 --> 12:49.160
 And where have I been?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.740
 Exactly.

12:50.740 --> 12:52.200
 Right, that's what we're talking about.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.800
 We're talking about, you wanna get into aliens,

12:53.800 --> 12:55.520
 let's have an interesting alien conversation.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.920
 Let's stop having the typical free will conversation,

12:58.920 --> 13:00.360
 the typical alien conversation,

13:00.360 --> 13:02.840
 the typical AGI morality conversation.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.720
 It's like, we have to recognize that we're amusing ourselves

13:05.720 --> 13:07.600
 because we're not making progress.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.400
 Time to have better versions of all these conversations.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.020
 Is there some version of the alien conversation

13:13.020 --> 13:15.880
 that could incorporate the breaking of frameworks?

13:15.880 --> 13:16.720
 Well, I think so.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.680
 I mean, the key question would be,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.620
 we've had the Pentagon release multiple videos

13:21.620 --> 13:25.080
 of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.960
 I just think it's also really fascinating

13:26.960 --> 13:29.240
 to talk about the fact that those of us

13:29.240 --> 13:33.080
 who were trained to call BS on all of this stuff

13:33.080 --> 13:35.120
 just had the rug pulled out from under us

13:35.120 --> 13:36.700
 by the Pentagon choosing to do this.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.400
 And you know what the effect of that is?

13:38.400 --> 13:43.400
 You've opened the door for every stupid theory known to man.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.540
 My aunt saw a ghost.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.980
 Okay, now we're gonna have to listen to,

13:48.980 --> 13:51.000
 well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.100
 Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude.

13:53.100 --> 13:57.960
 Whoever is in charge of lying to the public,

13:58.860 --> 14:01.020
 they need a cost function that incorporates

14:01.020 --> 14:04.220
 the damage and trust because I held this line

14:04.220 --> 14:07.260
 that this was all garbage and all BS.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.100
 Now I don't know what to think.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.500
 There's a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion,

14:11.500 --> 14:13.380
 the breaking of frameworks that involves

14:13.380 --> 14:15.940
 the release of videos from the Pentagon,

14:15.940 --> 14:18.300
 which is almost like another dimension

14:18.300 --> 14:21.960
 that trust in itself or the nature of truth and information

14:21.960 --> 14:24.780
 is a kind of dimension along which we're traveling

14:24.780 --> 14:29.180
 constantly that is messing with my head to think about

14:29.180 --> 14:34.180
 because it almost feels like you need to incorporate that

14:35.940 --> 14:38.400
 into your study of the nature of reality

14:38.400 --> 14:43.180
 is like the constant shifting of the notation,

14:43.180 --> 14:45.940
 the tools we use to communicate that reality.

14:45.940 --> 14:48.960
 And so what am I supposed to think about these videos?

14:48.960 --> 14:51.320
 Is it a complete distraction?

14:51.320 --> 14:53.300
 Is it a kind of cosmic joke?

14:53.300 --> 14:54.620
 I don't know, but you know what?

14:54.620 --> 14:55.540
 I'm tired of these people,

14:55.540 --> 14:57.500
 just completely tired of these people.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.020
 The people on the Pentagon side

14:59.020 --> 15:00.500
 or the people who are interpreting this stuff

15:00.500 --> 15:01.340
 on the Pentagon side?

15:01.340 --> 15:05.860
 I'm tired of the authorities playing games

15:05.860 --> 15:08.340
 with what we can know.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.500
 The fact that you and I don't,

15:09.500 --> 15:11.740
 do you have a security clearance?

15:11.740 --> 15:13.100
 Some level of it for,

15:13.100 --> 15:15.180
 because I was funded for DARPA for a while.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.260
 I don't have a security clearance.

15:17.260 --> 15:21.380
 You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.940
 And my guess is that there is zero interest

15:23.940 --> 15:25.200
 from our own government.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.580
 And so the Chinese will find out about it at the same time,

15:29.580 --> 15:30.660
 our government does,

15:30.660 --> 15:33.260
 because Lord knows what they do in these buildings.

15:33.260 --> 15:36.480
 I watch crazy people walk in and out

15:36.480 --> 15:39.980
 of the intelligence community, walk in and out of DARPA.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.100
 And I think, wow, you're talking to that person?

15:43.100 --> 15:45.220
 That's really fascinating to me.

15:45.220 --> 15:48.980
 We don't seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.520
 Complete lack of transparency.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.020
 Do you think it's possible there's,

15:52.020 --> 15:54.460
 the government is in possession

15:54.460 --> 15:57.060
 of something deeply fundamental

15:57.060 --> 15:58.500
 to our understanding of the world

15:58.500 --> 16:00.620
 that they're not releasing?

16:00.620 --> 16:02.460
 So this is one of the things is,

16:02.460 --> 16:05.540
 this is one of the famous distractions

16:05.540 --> 16:06.980
 that people play with, the narrative.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.180
 Assume that that were true.

16:08.180 --> 16:12.740
 Of alien life forms and spacecraft in possession,

16:12.740 --> 16:15.060
 that the government is in possession of alien spacecraft.

16:15.060 --> 16:17.580
 Assume that were true.

16:17.580 --> 16:21.260
 I don't think the government really exists at the moment.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.660
 I believe, and this is not an idea that was original to me.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.620
 There was a guy named Michael Teitelbaum

16:26.620 --> 16:28.420
 who used to be at the Sloan Foundation.

16:28.420 --> 16:31.300
 And at some point I pointed out that the US government

16:31.300 --> 16:33.700
 had completely contradictory objectives

16:33.700 --> 16:36.220
 when it came to the military and science.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.660
 And one branch said this, one branch said that.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.820
 I said, I don't understand which is true.

16:40.820 --> 16:41.660
 What does the government want?

16:41.660 --> 16:43.700
 He said, do you think there's a government?

16:43.700 --> 16:45.340
 And I said, what do you mean?

16:45.340 --> 16:47.740
 He said, what makes you think that the people

16:47.740 --> 16:50.340
 in those two offices have ever coordinated?

16:51.820 --> 16:54.300
 What is it that allows each office

16:54.300 --> 16:57.740
 to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office?

16:57.740 --> 16:59.580
 And that's when I first started to understand

16:59.580 --> 17:02.500
 that there are periods where the government coheres,

17:02.500 --> 17:04.940
 and then there are periods where the coherence just decays.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.940
 And I think that that's been going on since 1945.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.500
 That there have been a few places

17:09.500 --> 17:10.900
 where there's been increased coherence,

17:10.900 --> 17:12.580
 but in general everything is just getting

17:12.580 --> 17:13.940
 less and less coherent.

17:13.940 --> 17:17.180
 And that what war did was focus us on the need

17:17.180 --> 17:19.180
 to have a government of people, a mission,

17:20.100 --> 17:23.820
 capacity, technology, commitment, ideology.

17:23.820 --> 17:26.260
 And then as soon as that was gone,

17:27.780 --> 17:30.260
 different people, those who'd been through World War II

17:30.260 --> 17:32.900
 had one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s

17:34.500 --> 17:36.940
 or late 40s by the time they got to Woodstock,

17:38.020 --> 17:39.660
 they didn't buy any of that.

17:39.660 --> 17:42.780
 So coherence is the complete opposite

17:42.780 --> 17:47.780
 of bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.500
 So coherence is efficient, functional government.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.300
 Because when you say there's no government,

17:54.300 --> 17:58.540
 meaning there's no emergent function

17:58.540 --> 18:00.100
 from a collection of individuals.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.540
 It's just a bunch of individuals stuck in their offices

18:03.540 --> 18:05.420
 without any kind of efficient communication

18:05.420 --> 18:07.420
 with each other on a single mission.

18:07.420 --> 18:12.420
 And so a government that is truly at the epitome

18:12.620 --> 18:14.140
 of what a government is supposed to be

18:14.140 --> 18:16.180
 is when a bunch of people working together.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.020
 What are we about?

18:17.020 --> 18:17.860
 Are we about freedom?

18:17.860 --> 18:19.380
 Are we about growth?

18:19.380 --> 18:22.420
 Are we about decency and fairness?

18:22.420 --> 18:24.940
 Are we about the absence of a national culture

18:24.940 --> 18:26.980
 so that we can all just do our own thing?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.620
 I've called this thing the USA and the United States

18:29.620 --> 18:31.580
 have absolutely nothing.

18:31.580 --> 18:35.580
 These are all different visions for our country.

18:35.580 --> 18:39.540
 So it's possible that there's a alien spacecraft somewhere

18:39.540 --> 18:42.860
 and there's like 20 people that know about it.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.460
 And then they're kind of like,

18:44.460 --> 18:47.180
 as you communicate further and further into the offices,

18:47.180 --> 18:48.580
 that information dissipates,

18:48.580 --> 18:50.340
 it gets distorted in some kind of way.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.500
 And then it's completely lost the power,

18:52.500 --> 18:54.700
 the possibility of that information is lost.

18:55.780 --> 18:57.780
 We bought a house and I had this idea

18:57.780 --> 19:00.260
 that I wanted to find out what all the switches did.

19:00.260 --> 19:03.220
 And I quickly found out that your house

19:03.220 --> 19:05.700
 doesn't keep updating its plans.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.380
 As people do modifications,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.820
 they just do the modifications

19:08.820 --> 19:10.380
 and they don't actually record

19:10.380 --> 19:11.820
 why they were doing what they were doing

19:11.820 --> 19:12.820
 or what things lead to.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.860
 So there are all sorts of bizarre,

19:14.860 --> 19:17.420
 like there's a switch in my house that says privacy.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.220
 I don't know what privacy is.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.300
 Does it turn on an electromagnetic field?

19:22.300 --> 19:25.740
 Does some lead shielding go over the house?

19:27.540 --> 19:28.580
 That's what we have.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.180
 We have a system in which the people

19:30.180 --> 19:32.500
 who've inherited these structures have no idea

19:32.500 --> 19:34.140
 why their grandparents built them.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.020
 I'd be funny if there's a freedom of speech switch

19:37.020 --> 19:38.700
 that you could also control.

19:38.700 --> 19:39.900
 And there'd be a perfect metaphor.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.900
 Well, that's different because what they figured out is,

19:42.900 --> 19:44.500
 is that if they can just make sure

19:44.500 --> 19:48.900
 that we don't have any public options for communication,

19:48.900 --> 19:52.660
 then hey, everything that we say to each other

19:52.660 --> 19:53.740
 goes through a private company,

19:53.740 --> 19:55.380
 private companies can do whatever they want.

19:55.380 --> 19:57.620
 And this is like one of the greatest moves

19:57.620 --> 19:59.140
 that we didn't really notice.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.940
 Electronic and digital speech

20:01.940 --> 20:04.220
 makes every other kind of speech irrelevant.

20:04.220 --> 20:08.540
 And because there is no public option, guess what?

20:08.540 --> 20:12.940
 There's always somebody named Sundar or Jack or Mark

20:12.940 --> 20:15.260
 who controls whether or not you can speak

20:15.260 --> 20:17.740
 and what it appears to be that is being said

20:17.740 --> 20:20.420
 and whose stuff is weighted more highly than others.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.180
 It's an absolute nightmare.

20:22.180 --> 20:26.660
 And by the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite,

20:26.660 --> 20:28.180
 Lord knows what is going on.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.700
 People are so busy making money

20:30.700 --> 20:34.260
 that they are not actually upholding any of the values.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.660
 So Silicon Valley is sort of maximally against,

20:36.660 --> 20:41.660
 it has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen

20:42.900 --> 20:44.380
 to it when it goes to Burning Man.

20:44.380 --> 20:46.500
 And then it quickly just imposes rules

20:46.500 --> 20:48.420
 on all of the rest of us as to what we could say

20:48.420 --> 20:51.060
 to each other if we're not part of the inner elite.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.260
 So what do you think the ideal

20:53.260 --> 20:55.540
 of the freedom of speech means?

20:55.540 --> 20:57.300
 Well, this is very interesting.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.380
 I keep getting lectured on social media

20:59.380 --> 21:01.620
 by people who have no idea how much power

21:01.620 --> 21:04.580
 the Supreme Court has to abstract things.

21:04.580 --> 21:07.940
 Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law

21:07.940 --> 21:09.260
 and the spirit of the law.

21:09.260 --> 21:12.220
 And the spirit of the law would have to say

21:12.220 --> 21:14.660
 that our speech that matters is free,

21:14.660 --> 21:16.180
 at least at the level of ideas.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.860
 I don't claim that I have the right

21:17.860 --> 21:19.660
 to endanger your life with speech

21:19.660 --> 21:22.020
 or to reveal your private information.

21:22.020 --> 21:25.820
 So I really am not opining about directed speech

21:25.820 --> 21:27.260
 intended to smear you.

21:27.260 --> 21:30.020
 And that's a different kettle of fish.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.540
 And maybe I have some rights to do that,

21:31.540 --> 21:33.380
 but I don't think that they're infinite.

21:34.740 --> 21:38.420
 What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas

21:41.020 --> 21:43.900
 is essential that the court abstract it

21:43.900 --> 21:48.140
 and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook, Twitter,

21:48.140 --> 21:52.580
 Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are

21:52.580 --> 21:56.220
 because it really matters which abstraction you use.

21:56.220 --> 21:59.620
 The case that I really like is search and seizure.

21:59.620 --> 22:02.700
 If I have private data that I entered in my house

22:02.700 --> 22:06.220
 that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house,

22:07.380 --> 22:09.980
 but I view is the abstraction

22:09.980 --> 22:12.100
 that it's only the perimeter of my house

22:12.100 --> 22:13.540
 that I have the right to protect,

22:13.540 --> 22:18.540
 or does my password extend the perimeter of my house

22:18.740 --> 22:20.220
 to the data on the server

22:20.220 --> 22:22.940
 that is located outside of my house?

22:22.940 --> 22:26.740
 These are choices for the court, and the court is supposed

22:26.740 --> 22:29.420
 to pretend that they can divine the true intent

22:29.420 --> 22:30.660
 of the framers.

22:30.660 --> 22:33.620
 But all of the sort of, and I've taken to calling this

22:33.620 --> 22:35.220
 the problem of internet hyenas,

22:35.220 --> 22:37.900
 people with readymade answers and LOLs,

22:37.900 --> 22:39.940
 and you're such a moron.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.700
 These folks love to remind you, it's a private company,

22:42.700 --> 22:44.580
 dude, it can do whatever it wants.

22:44.580 --> 22:48.540
 No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.620
 And just the way, for example,

22:50.620 --> 22:54.300
 the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra

22:54.300 --> 22:56.420
 because there was too little in the Constitution,

22:56.420 --> 22:58.380
 therefore there were all sorts of things implied

22:58.380 --> 23:00.820
 that couldn't be in the document.

23:00.820 --> 23:04.260
 Somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now

23:04.260 --> 23:09.020
 that says Jack cannot do it if he wants.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.460
 It's really, so you say the courts,

23:11.460 --> 23:15.060
 but it's also us, people who think about the world,

23:15.060 --> 23:16.100
 it's you. No, no, no.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.220
 It's the courts.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.620
 But the courts don't do this.

23:19.620 --> 23:20.660
 We're toast.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.420
 But we can still think about it.

23:22.420 --> 23:23.500
 I mean, I'll...

23:23.500 --> 23:25.740
 Sure, but I don't feel like going down the drain.

23:25.740 --> 23:26.900
 Here's what I'm thinking about,

23:26.900 --> 23:29.820
 because it's tricky how far it should extend.

23:29.820 --> 23:31.500
 I mean, that's an ongoing conversation.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.300
 Don't you think the interpretation of the law...

23:34.300 --> 23:36.300
 I think I'm trying to say something very simple,

23:36.300 --> 23:38.840
 and it's just not gonna be popular for a while.

23:41.220 --> 23:45.100
 Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.220
 Print or shouting in a public park.

23:48.220 --> 23:51.300
 And so I can go to a public park

23:51.300 --> 23:53.020
 and I can shout if I get a permit.

23:53.020 --> 23:56.380
 Even there, I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta,

23:56.380 --> 23:58.220
 we came up with free speech zones

23:58.220 --> 23:59.980
 where you can't protest at a convention.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.420
 You bet you can go to a park 23 miles out

24:02.420 --> 24:04.300
 and they'll fence off a little area

24:04.300 --> 24:06.100
 where you can have your free speech.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.140
 No, speech is dangerous.

24:09.140 --> 24:10.460
 Ideas are dangerous.

24:10.460 --> 24:13.740
 We are a country about danger and risk.

24:13.740 --> 24:17.100
 And yes, I agree that targeted speech at individuals

24:17.100 --> 24:19.420
 trying to reveal their private stuff

24:19.420 --> 24:20.260
 and all that kind of...

24:20.260 --> 24:21.180
 That is very different.

24:21.180 --> 24:24.340
 So forget a lot of that stuff.

24:24.340 --> 24:27.020
 But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous

24:28.100 --> 24:31.940
 and people will die as a result of free speech.

24:31.940 --> 24:35.500
 The idea that one life is too much is preposterous.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.820
 Like why did we send...

24:36.820 --> 24:38.100
 If one life is preposterous,

24:38.100 --> 24:39.980
 why did we send anyone to the beaches of Normandy?

24:39.980 --> 24:41.580
 I just don't get this.

24:41.580 --> 24:45.940
 So one thing that I was clearly bothered by,

24:45.940 --> 24:48.220
 and maybe you can be my therapist as well.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.740
 I thought you were mine.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.980
 This is a little bit of a miscommunication

24:53.980 --> 24:55.300
 on both of our parts then.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.820
 Because who's paying who for this?

25:00.740 --> 25:05.740
 I was really bothered by Amazon banning Parler from AWS

25:06.780 --> 25:11.260
 because my assumption was that the infrastructure...

25:11.260 --> 25:14.340
 I drew a distinction between AWS,

25:14.340 --> 25:18.220
 the infrastructure on which competing platforms

25:18.220 --> 25:23.220
 could be created is different than the actual platforms.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.500
 So the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech,

25:28.460 --> 25:31.900
 I, in my mind, in a shallow way perhaps,

25:31.900 --> 25:35.580
 applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter.

25:36.660 --> 25:41.020
 It felt that we've created a more dangerous world,

25:41.020 --> 25:46.020
 that freedoms were violated by banning Parler from AWS,

25:46.140 --> 25:48.140
 which I saw as the computing infrastructure

25:48.140 --> 25:50.900
 which enables the competition of tools,

25:50.900 --> 25:54.940
 the competition of frameworks of communication.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.580
 What do you think about this?

25:56.580 --> 25:59.900
 First of all, let me give you the internet hyena answer.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.780
 I don't understand, dude, just build your own Amazon.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.620
 Yeah. Right?

26:04.620 --> 26:07.220
 Yes. Well, so that's a very shallow statement,

26:07.220 --> 26:10.580
 but it's also one that has some legitimacy.

26:10.580 --> 26:12.300
 We can't completely dismiss it

26:12.300 --> 26:16.620
 because there's levels to this game.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.900
 Yes and no, but if you really wanted to chase that down,

26:19.900 --> 26:22.380
 one of the great things about a person to person conversation

26:22.380 --> 26:25.660
 as opposed to let's have 30 of our closest friends,

26:25.660 --> 26:26.660
 whenever we have a conversation

26:26.660 --> 26:29.100
 with 30 of our closest friends, you know what happens?

26:29.100 --> 26:31.500
 It's like passing light through a prism.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.340
 Every person says something interesting.

26:34.340 --> 26:36.820
 And as a result, it's always muddled.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.420
 Nothing ever resolves.

26:38.420 --> 26:42.260
 Well, one of my conversational techniques you mentioned,

26:42.260 --> 26:46.780
 you pushed back is first this childlike naivety

26:46.780 --> 26:49.020
 and curiosity, but also.

26:49.020 --> 26:50.180
 Real or simulated?

26:50.180 --> 26:51.500
 Real, I'm afraid.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.180
 I would say 80% real.

26:53.180 --> 26:54.020
 All right.

26:54.020 --> 26:58.060
 So in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming?

26:58.060 --> 27:01.780
 I mean, I did a show with Ashley Matthews,

27:01.780 --> 27:03.820
 who's the woman behind Riley Reid.

27:03.820 --> 27:06.580
 And specifically about this, it was about the idea

27:06.580 --> 27:10.740
 that if I move away from politics and go towards sex,

27:10.740 --> 27:14.580
 I know that there's always a move to use the infrastructure

27:14.580 --> 27:18.580
 to shut down sex workers.

27:18.580 --> 27:21.780
 And in this case, we had Operation Choke Point

27:21.780 --> 27:24.980
 under the Obama administration.

27:24.980 --> 27:28.420
 We have a positive passion for people

27:28.420 --> 27:30.540
 who want to solve problems,

27:30.540 --> 27:31.980
 that they don't like this company,

27:31.980 --> 27:32.940
 they don't like that company,

27:32.940 --> 27:35.220
 payday loans would be another one.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.140
 And so you have legal companies

27:37.140 --> 27:39.660
 that are harassed by our financial system

27:39.660 --> 27:44.260
 that you can't, as Riley Reid,

27:44.260 --> 27:47.460
 Ashley couldn't get a Mailchimp account according to her,

27:47.460 --> 27:49.340
 if I understand her correctly.

27:49.340 --> 27:53.340
 And this idea that you charge these people higher rates

27:53.340 --> 27:56.700
 because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards,

27:56.700 --> 27:59.020
 even if their chargebacks are low.

27:59.020 --> 28:02.780
 Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.940
 There's something about everybody who shows up at Davos,

28:07.180 --> 28:09.300
 they get drunk in the Swiss Alps,

28:09.300 --> 28:12.620
 and then they come back home and they coordinate,

28:12.620 --> 28:15.340
 and they coordinate things like Build Back Better.

28:15.340 --> 28:17.060
 We don't really understand what Build Back Better is,

28:17.060 --> 28:19.340
 but my guess is that Build Back Better

28:19.340 --> 28:21.780
 has to do with extremism in America.

28:21.780 --> 28:24.260
 How do we shut down the Republican Party

28:24.260 --> 28:26.420
 as the source of extremism?

28:26.420 --> 28:28.300
 Now, I do think the Republican Party

28:28.300 --> 28:29.860
 got very extreme under Trump.

28:30.780 --> 28:32.500
 And I do believe that that was responsive

28:32.500 --> 28:37.500
 to how extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first

28:38.580 --> 28:42.100
 and then Obama and then Hillary.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.900
 And in all of these circumstances,

28:44.900 --> 28:46.460
 it's amazing how much we want

28:46.460 --> 28:48.740
 to wield these things as weapons.

28:48.740 --> 28:50.700
 Well, our extremism is fine

28:50.700 --> 28:53.060
 because we pretend that Antifa doesn't exist

28:53.060 --> 28:55.700
 and we don't report what goes on in Portland,

28:55.700 --> 28:59.500
 but your extremism, my God, that's disgusting.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.260
 This is the completely ridiculous place that we're in.

29:02.260 --> 29:06.020
 And by the way, our friends in part

29:07.060 --> 29:08.820
 are coked up on tech money,

29:08.820 --> 29:12.540
 and they don't appear to hold the courage

29:12.540 --> 29:14.420
 of their convictions at a political level

29:14.420 --> 29:18.060
 because it's not in keeping with shareholder value.

29:18.060 --> 29:21.460
 At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate shield

29:21.460 --> 29:24.780
 with which everyone can cloak themselves.

29:24.780 --> 29:29.780
 Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned from Twitter,

29:29.780 --> 29:32.020
 and I'm not sure it was a good financial decision

29:32.020 --> 29:33.700
 for Twitter, right?

29:35.340 --> 29:37.460
 Perhaps you can correct me if I'm wrong.

29:37.460 --> 29:38.780
 Well, are you thinking locally,

29:38.780 --> 29:43.460
 or are you thinking if Twitter refused to ban Donald Trump,

29:43.460 --> 29:45.900
 what is the odds that the full force

29:45.900 --> 29:47.740
 of the antitrust division might find them?

29:47.740 --> 29:48.580
 I don't know.

29:48.580 --> 29:49.420
 Oh, I see, I see.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.260
 So there's a complicated thing.

29:51.260 --> 29:55.020
 Well, look, these guys are all having a discussion

29:55.020 --> 29:56.820
 in very practical terms.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.980
 You can imagine the sorts of things

29:58.980 --> 30:01.340
 and imagine the sorts of conversation.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.740
 Jack, Mark, Zunder, we're really glad you're all here.

30:03.740 --> 30:06.340
 We're all trying to sing from the same hymnal

30:06.340 --> 30:08.780
 and row in the same direction.

30:08.780 --> 30:09.820
 We understand free speech.

30:09.820 --> 30:11.180
 We're completely committed to it,

30:11.180 --> 30:13.740
 but we have to draw a line with extremism, guys.

30:13.740 --> 30:17.380
 We just need to make sure that we're all on the same page.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.340
 Well, they use the term violence, too,

30:19.340 --> 30:21.900
 and they, I think, over apply it.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.540
 So basically, anybody...

30:23.540 --> 30:30.900
 I'm telling you, I say dumb things

30:30.900 --> 30:34.340
 to incentivize thoughtful conversation.

30:34.340 --> 30:38.660
 Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace.

30:38.660 --> 30:39.740
 Like, how old are you, Lex?

30:39.740 --> 30:41.260
 You're in your mid 30s?

30:41.260 --> 30:43.260
 Yeah, to late 40s.

30:43.260 --> 30:46.620
 Mid, late 20s to late 40s, somewhere in there.

30:46.620 --> 30:47.700
 That's the demographic, yes.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.380
 I do think that partially what's happened

30:49.380 --> 30:52.900
 is that your group has never seen functional institutions.

30:52.900 --> 30:56.620
 These institutions have been so compromised for so long.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.540
 You've probably never seen an adult.

30:59.540 --> 31:02.780
 Sometimes I think Elon looks like an adult.

31:02.780 --> 31:05.380
 I know that he has a wild lifestyle,

31:05.380 --> 31:07.860
 but I also see it looking like an adult.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.340
 What does an adult look like exactly?

31:09.340 --> 31:13.060
 Oh, you know, somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully,

31:13.060 --> 31:17.140
 thinks about the future beyond their own lifespan.

31:17.140 --> 31:21.180
 Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done,

31:21.180 --> 31:23.820
 isn't wildly caught up in punitive actions,

31:23.820 --> 31:26.380
 is more focused on breaking new ground

31:26.380 --> 31:29.060
 than playing rent seeking games.

31:29.060 --> 31:31.140
 I mean, I really had a positive...

31:31.140 --> 31:34.620
 I was so completely jazzed when Elon Musk ended up

31:34.620 --> 31:36.180
 as the world's richest person.

31:36.180 --> 31:39.700
 He was like, well, that's interesting, back to work.

31:39.700 --> 31:43.620
 It's just like, that's what an adult would do.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.580
 And it just made, you know, weirdly,

31:45.580 --> 31:47.260
 I said something about, isn't it amazing

31:47.260 --> 31:50.460
 that the world's richest person knows what a Lagrangian is?

31:50.460 --> 31:54.220
 And he made a terrible Lagrange joke about potentials.

31:54.220 --> 31:57.180
 But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately,

31:57.180 --> 32:00.100
 Elon may be one of the closest things we have to an adult.

32:00.100 --> 32:02.060
 And I can tell you that the internet hyenas

32:02.060 --> 32:05.020
 will immediately descend as to what a fraudster he is

32:05.020 --> 32:06.340
 for pumping his stock price,

32:06.340 --> 32:08.220
 talking his book and all this stuff.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.500
 Shut up.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.140
 Just looking at the world seriously and really saying,

32:12.140 --> 32:15.900
 you're saying that the people who are running tech companies

32:15.900 --> 32:20.900
 or running the mediums on which we can exercise

32:21.180 --> 32:24.500
 the ideal of free speech are not adults.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.340
 I think not.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.580
 I think, first of all, a lot of them

32:26.580 --> 32:30.620
 are Silicon Valley utopian businessmen,

32:30.620 --> 32:33.660
 where you talk a utopian line and you use it.

32:33.660 --> 32:37.940
 You've heard my take, which is that the idealism

32:37.940 --> 32:41.180
 of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts.

32:41.180 --> 32:42.980
 And I believe that in many ways,

32:42.980 --> 32:45.460
 the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world,

32:45.460 --> 32:47.900
 the world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

32:47.900 --> 32:51.940
 is really about the software eating the world

32:51.940 --> 32:53.340
 as Mark Andreessen likes to say,

32:53.340 --> 32:55.060
 that there were all these legacy properties

32:55.060 --> 32:58.740
 and by simply being a bad tech version

32:58.740 --> 33:03.260
 of something that previously existed like a newspaper,

33:03.260 --> 33:05.780
 you could immediately start to dwarf that

33:05.780 --> 33:08.140
 by aggregating newspapers and their digital versions

33:08.140 --> 33:10.460
 because digital is so much more powerful.

33:10.460 --> 33:15.100
 As a result, yes, we have lots of man children

33:15.100 --> 33:18.100
 wandering around what once was the Bay Area

33:18.100 --> 33:20.700
 and is now Austin and Miami and other places,

33:22.140 --> 33:27.140
 maybe Singapore, that all of these people,

33:27.900 --> 33:29.740
 these are friends of ours and they're brilliant

33:29.740 --> 33:32.380
 with respect to a certain amount of stuff,

33:32.380 --> 33:34.380
 but none of them can get off the drip.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.220
 It's amazing that none of them have FU money.

33:37.220 --> 33:39.820
 We've got billionaires who don't have FU money.

33:39.820 --> 33:43.020
 Okay, I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey

33:43.020 --> 33:45.820
 was that there was an incitement of violence

33:45.820 --> 33:47.100
 and not just Jack Dorsey,

33:47.100 --> 33:50.180
 but everybody that was banning people.

33:50.180 --> 33:52.180
 And then this word violence was used

33:53.180 --> 33:56.380
 as a kind of just like extremism and so on

33:56.380 --> 33:59.220
 to without much reason behind it.

33:59.220 --> 34:01.660
 You think it's impossible for Jack Dorsey

34:01.660 --> 34:04.780
 or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult,

34:04.780 --> 34:06.220
 a grownup and reason.

34:06.220 --> 34:07.940
 Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grownup.

34:07.940 --> 34:08.780
 It seems like he is.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.580
 Yeah, but he's under pressures.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.300
 As you've discussed,

34:13.300 --> 34:15.740
 it seems that he's been on the verge

34:15.740 --> 34:18.940
 of almost being quite serious and transparent

34:18.940 --> 34:19.780
 and real with people.

34:19.780 --> 34:22.300
 I don't know where the Jack Dorsey that I met went.

34:23.140 --> 34:27.380
 And I worry that that must be something behind the scenes

34:27.380 --> 34:28.260
 that I can't see.

34:29.140 --> 34:32.700
 From my perspective, what I think is the stress,

34:32.700 --> 34:36.540
 the burden of that when people are screaming at you

34:37.380 --> 34:38.220
 is overwhelming.

34:38.220 --> 34:39.580
 No, Jack is a Zen monk.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.660
 He really is.

34:41.660 --> 34:42.820
 Yeah.

34:42.820 --> 34:47.700
 Jack is an incredibly impressive person intellectually,

34:47.700 --> 34:52.700
 morally, spiritually, at least for a couple of meetings.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.140
 I don't know him very well,

34:54.140 --> 34:57.740
 but I'm very impressed by the person I met

34:57.740 --> 34:59.220
 and I don't know where that person is.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.460
 And that terrifies me.

35:02.020 --> 35:04.540
 But do you think somebody could step up in that way?

35:04.540 --> 35:05.740
 No.

35:05.740 --> 35:10.740
 So does a human being have the capacity to be transparent

35:11.860 --> 35:14.220
 about the reasoning behind the banning?

35:14.220 --> 35:19.220
 Or do you think all banning of people

35:19.460 --> 35:24.140
 from mediums of communication is eventually destructive

35:24.140 --> 35:25.980
 or it's impossible for human beings

35:25.980 --> 35:27.980
 to reason with ourselves about it?

35:27.980 --> 35:30.980
 Well, let's see what the problem is.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.380
 So my phone has been on airplane mode.

35:33.380 --> 35:34.420
 I'm gonna unlock it.

35:34.420 --> 35:38.420
 And I'm gonna take a picture of Lex Fridman.

35:38.420 --> 35:43.300
 Now, if I can, I'm gonna tweet that picture out.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.140
 Great.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.300
 But here's the weird part about it.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.780
 Yeah.

35:46.780 --> 35:51.780
 That picture sitting with Lex today.

35:55.940 --> 35:58.620
 This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made.

35:58.620 --> 35:59.460
 Okay.

35:59.460 --> 36:04.460
 In so doing, I have just sent a picture of you

36:07.140 --> 36:10.540
 and a tiny piece of text all over the planet

36:10.540 --> 36:15.100
 that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth,

36:15.100 --> 36:17.500
 just under half a million different accounts.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.220
 And then more from sharing and so on.

36:22.220 --> 36:23.980
 Well, and then some of those accounts are dead.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.140
 We don't really know how many places it went.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.820
 But the key issue with that tweet

36:28.820 --> 36:32.820
 is that that is a nonlocal phenomenon.

36:33.700 --> 36:34.540
 Yes.

36:34.540 --> 36:39.540
 So I just broadcasted to an entire planet.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.620
 Somebody in Uganda is reading that

36:41.620 --> 36:43.620
 at the same time as somebody in Uruguay.

36:45.020 --> 36:50.020
 There is no known solution to have so many people

36:50.820 --> 36:54.140
 with the ability to communicate nonlocally

36:54.140 --> 36:58.500
 because locality was part of the implicit nature of speech

36:58.500 --> 36:59.860
 inside of the constitution.

36:59.860 --> 37:01.900
 Friction, locality, there were all sorts

37:01.900 --> 37:04.140
 of other aspects to speech.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.140
 So if you think about speech as a bundle.

37:08.900 --> 37:09.740
 I like this.

37:10.700 --> 37:11.940
 Then it got unbundled.

37:12.820 --> 37:17.020
 And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on

37:17.020 --> 37:22.020
 to retard the impact of speech aren't present.

37:22.180 --> 37:23.980
 And we don't have the courage to say,

37:23.980 --> 37:26.940
 I wonder if the first amendment really applies

37:26.940 --> 37:28.860
 in the modern era in the same way,

37:28.860 --> 37:30.780
 or we have to work through an abstraction.

37:30.780 --> 37:33.100
 Either we probably have to amend the constitution

37:33.100 --> 37:34.860
 or we have to abstract it properly.

37:35.820 --> 37:40.580
 And that issue is not something we're facing up to.

37:40.580 --> 37:44.820
 I watch us constantly look backwards.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.820
 We don't seem to try to come up with new ideas

37:48.820 --> 37:49.660
 and new theories.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.340
 Nobody really imagines that we're going to be able

37:52.340 --> 37:54.780
 to wisely amend the constitution anymore

37:54.780 --> 37:56.220
 in the inside of the United States.

37:56.220 --> 37:57.780
 Many people abroad will say,

37:57.780 --> 37:59.420
 why are these guys talking about the US?

37:59.420 --> 38:01.140
 It's a US centric program.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.940
 Well, it's because nobody knows where this program lives.

38:05.020 --> 38:06.900
 The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be

38:06.900 --> 38:10.220
 in a physical place together is also bizarre.

38:10.220 --> 38:11.060
 It could be anywhere.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.780
 It doesn't really matter that it happens to be here.

38:13.780 --> 38:16.140
 So the difference between logical and between physical,

38:16.140 --> 38:18.860
 local, nonlocal, frictional, nonfrictional,

38:18.860 --> 38:21.540
 it's the same thing with firearms.

38:21.540 --> 38:25.660
 Nobody imagined that the Gatling gun

38:25.660 --> 38:28.300
 was gonna be present when you had to reload a musket.

38:29.460 --> 38:33.460
 And that's fascinating to think about.

38:33.460 --> 38:37.220
 I mean, you're exactly right that the nature

38:37.220 --> 38:39.860
 of this particular freedom that seems so foundational

38:39.860 --> 38:44.260
 to this nation, to what made this nation great

38:44.260 --> 38:46.460
 and perhaps much of the world that is great,

38:46.460 --> 38:49.460
 made it great, is changing completely.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.060
 Can we try to reason through how the ideal freedom

38:52.060 --> 38:54.220
 of speech is to be changed?

38:54.220 --> 38:57.620
 I mean, I guess I'm struggling.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.860
 It feels really wrong, perhaps because I wasn't

39:00.860 --> 39:01.820
 paying attention to it.

39:01.820 --> 39:06.820
 It feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump from Twitter,

39:06.900 --> 39:08.700
 to ban not just the president.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.900
 That's really wrong to me.

39:10.900 --> 39:15.540
 But this particular human for being divisive.

39:15.540 --> 39:20.140
 But then when there's an incitement of violence,

39:20.140 --> 39:23.500
 that is an overused claim.

39:23.500 --> 39:28.500
 But perhaps there was actual brewing

39:29.500 --> 39:31.620
 of local violence happening.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.220
 So one of the things I know was happening on Parler

39:34.220 --> 39:39.220
 is people were scheduling meetings together

39:39.340 --> 39:40.380
 in physical space.

39:40.380 --> 39:45.380
 So you're now going back from this dynamic, social,

39:46.100 --> 39:48.860
 large scale, people from Uganda, people from all

39:48.860 --> 39:51.340
 over the world being able to communicate.

39:51.340 --> 39:54.020
 You're now mapping that into now back meeting

39:54.020 --> 39:57.300
 in the physical space that is similar

39:57.300 --> 39:58.780
 to what the founding of this nation was.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.620
 The violence would be digital

40:00.620 --> 40:03.520
 if ransomware suddenly was unleashed.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.560
 True.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.360
 The key issue is the abstractions.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.740
 So what was freedom of speech as a bundle?

40:10.740 --> 40:12.020
 And now it's...

40:12.020 --> 40:14.540
 And then how do we abstract the bundle

40:14.540 --> 40:16.680
 into the digital era?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.500
 Do you think we just need to raise the question

40:18.500 --> 40:19.340
 and talk about it?

40:19.340 --> 40:20.580
 Do you have ideas?

40:20.580 --> 40:21.720
 Well, sure I have ideas.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.260
 But the key point is that I'm not even welcome

40:24.260 --> 40:25.480
 in mainstream media.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.400
 I've never seen you on mainstream media.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.600
 Do you do mainstream media?

40:29.600 --> 40:32.500
 So we exist in part of an alternate universe

40:32.500 --> 40:35.020
 because the mainstream media is trying to have

40:35.020 --> 40:37.740
 a coherent story, which I've called

40:37.740 --> 40:39.500
 the gated institutional narrative.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.340
 And the institutions pretend that,

40:41.340 --> 40:43.460
 they plug their fingers in their ears

40:43.460 --> 40:46.140
 and pretend that nothing exists outside

40:46.140 --> 40:49.400
 of MSNBC talking to CNN about what was

40:49.400 --> 40:52.860
 in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post.

40:52.860 --> 40:54.980
 And so that's effectively like a professional

40:54.980 --> 40:57.180
 wrestling promotion where they, you know,

40:57.180 --> 40:59.820
 the Undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan

40:59.820 --> 41:01.800
 and Rowdy Roddy Piper.

41:01.800 --> 41:05.900
 Okay, well, that's very different than MMA.

41:05.900 --> 41:08.740
 You've recently been on Glenn Beck's program.

41:08.740 --> 41:09.740
 Yeah.

41:09.740 --> 41:12.860
 And there was this kind of, one of the things

41:12.860 --> 41:15.520
 you've talked about is being able to have

41:15.520 --> 41:19.260
 this conversation, I don't know if you would put it

41:19.260 --> 41:21.280
 as a type of conversation that was happening

41:21.280 --> 41:23.740
 outside the mainstream media, but a conversation

41:23.740 --> 41:27.780
 that reaches across different world views.

41:27.780 --> 41:28.620
 You're right.

41:28.620 --> 41:33.300
 Being a nuanced, or just like a respectful conversation

41:33.300 --> 41:35.220
 that's grounded in mutual.

41:35.220 --> 41:37.900
 But we can't have the reality because the main model

41:37.900 --> 41:42.220
 is the center, both left and right,

41:42.220 --> 41:44.300
 is in the process of stealing all the wealth

41:44.300 --> 41:45.240
 that we built up.

41:46.260 --> 41:50.240
 And they've organized the extremes into two LARPing teams

41:50.240 --> 41:53.140
 that I've called Magistan and Wokistan.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.880
 And then you have everybody who isn't part

41:55.880 --> 41:58.260
 of that complex, all seven of us.

41:58.260 --> 42:00.780
 The number of us who are able to earn a living

42:00.780 --> 42:04.380
 looking at all of these mad people playing this game.

42:05.820 --> 42:09.500
 There's a phrase inside finance when the investment banks

42:09.500 --> 42:12.540
 are trying to look at price action.

42:12.540 --> 42:14.900
 And somebody says, this doesn't make any sense.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.340
 And somebody will say, it's just the locals

42:16.340 --> 42:17.780
 stealing from each other.

42:17.780 --> 42:20.020
 And that's really what we have.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.800
 We've got the leaders of Magistan and Wokistan,

42:23.920 --> 42:27.020
 championing these two teams is sponsored by the center

42:27.020 --> 42:29.340
 because it's a distraction while they steal all the silver

42:29.340 --> 42:31.460
 and cut the paintings out of the frames.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.660
 That's what you and I are looking at.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.460
 So when you ask me, do you have any ideas

42:35.460 --> 42:37.320
 about the abstraction for free speech?

42:39.140 --> 42:41.260
 I've never met Mark Zuckerberg.

42:41.260 --> 42:43.260
 I've never met Sundar Pichai.

42:43.260 --> 42:45.140
 I never met Larry Page.

42:45.140 --> 42:47.500
 I was once in a room with Sergey Brin.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.640
 I've never spoken to Elon Musk.

42:50.820 --> 42:52.180
 I hang out with Peter Thiel,

42:52.180 --> 42:54.440
 but we have a very deep relationship,

42:54.440 --> 42:58.180
 but I don't really speak to that many other people

42:58.180 --> 43:00.420
 at sort of at this level.

43:00.420 --> 43:04.220
 We're not having any kind of smart conversation

43:04.220 --> 43:05.540
 at a national level.

43:05.540 --> 43:10.540
 In fact, it's almost as if we've destroyed every sandbox

43:11.500 --> 43:13.300
 in which we could play together.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.740
 There's no place that we actually talk

43:15.740 --> 43:18.180
 except long form podcasting.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.300
 And by the way, they've found,

43:20.300 --> 43:23.220
 you see what's going on with like Alex Stamos

43:23.220 --> 43:25.260
 and the Hoover Institution.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.160
 There's a loophole left.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.700
 Long form podcasting allows people to speak

43:31.700 --> 43:34.260
 at levels above daytime CNN.

43:34.260 --> 43:35.940
 It's like, well, why do you think

43:35.940 --> 43:37.720
 they're not watching daytime CNN?

43:39.020 --> 43:42.260
 But that's just silly journalism.

43:42.260 --> 43:45.940
 They currently have no power to displace podcasting.

43:45.940 --> 43:47.780
 That's why it's so powerful, RSS feed.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.320
 I mean, that's why the big challenge with Joe Rogan

43:50.320 --> 43:53.500
 and Spotify is like, there's this dance that's fascinating

43:53.500 --> 43:57.980
 to see is Joe Rogan is not part of the system

43:57.980 --> 44:00.660
 and then he's also uncancellable

44:00.660 --> 44:03.580
 and there's this tension that's happening.

44:03.580 --> 44:04.420
 It's fascinating.

44:04.420 --> 44:05.420
 Well, think about what happened to Howard Stern though.

44:05.420 --> 44:07.640
 Howard Stern became much less relevant.

44:08.900 --> 44:13.240
 So if they can't control Joe by bringing him in house,

44:13.240 --> 44:17.500
 the key question is, is he going to continue,

44:17.500 --> 44:20.820
 like Joe says this thing about FU money.

44:22.220 --> 44:24.380
 Joe's one of the only people with FU money

44:24.380 --> 44:26.160
 who's actually said FU.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.560
 I don't understand this.

44:30.560 --> 44:32.100
 I don't have FU money.

44:32.100 --> 44:36.420
 What exactly is, can we break apart FU money?

44:36.420 --> 44:40.420
 Because I always thought I've been fortunate enough

44:41.420 --> 44:45.020
 to always have FU money in the sense

44:45.020 --> 44:48.260
 that my standards were so low that a basic salary

44:48.260 --> 44:49.100
 in the United States.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.300
 Well, this is the stoic point,

44:50.300 --> 44:53.020
 which is if you can live on rice and beans,

44:53.020 --> 44:54.980
 you're uncancellable because you're always rich

44:54.980 --> 44:56.220
 relative to your needs.

44:56.220 --> 44:57.940
 Isn't that FU fundamental, FU money?

44:57.940 --> 45:01.540
 Why do you say that tech billionaires don't have FU money?

45:01.540 --> 45:03.600
 When you need to hire private security

45:03.600 --> 45:05.080
 to protect your family,

45:05.080 --> 45:07.020
 how do you protect your two children?

45:07.020 --> 45:08.060
 I don't have those yet.

45:08.060 --> 45:09.060
 Bingo.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.140
 Yeah.

45:10.140 --> 45:14.540
 My point is that FU money insulates everything

45:14.540 --> 45:15.500
 that you care about.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.380
 It's not just about you.

45:17.380 --> 45:20.940
 So you're saying as the level of responsibility grows,

45:20.940 --> 45:24.600
 the amount of money required for FU.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.060
 We have a war going on.

45:26.060 --> 45:28.660
 The war is on academic freedom.

45:28.660 --> 45:31.540
 Academic freedom used to be present in the system

45:31.540 --> 45:35.820
 as a, in terms of the idea, we trust our elite.

45:35.820 --> 45:39.420
 Now we have an idea like, you wanna be the elite.

45:39.420 --> 45:40.980
 You want a Lord above us.

45:40.980 --> 45:43.940
 First of all, there's like a populist, anti elitist thing.

45:43.940 --> 45:44.900
 Then there's the idea

45:44.900 --> 45:48.620
 that we're gonna defer tenure for forever.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.220
 Then we're gonna tell people, stay in your lane.

45:50.220 --> 45:51.400
 Your tenure is only good

45:51.400 --> 45:54.700
 for your own particular tiny micro subject.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.500
 Then we're gonna also control your grants

45:56.500 --> 45:59.000
 and we'll be able to load up your teaching load.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.140
 If we don't like who you are,

46:00.140 --> 46:03.480
 we'll make your life absolutely impossible.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.180
 We lost academic freedom

46:06.280 --> 46:09.800
 and we ushered in peer review, which was a disaster.

46:10.700 --> 46:12.820
 And then we lost funding

46:12.820 --> 46:14.580
 so that people were confident

46:14.580 --> 46:17.300
 that they would have the ability to do research

46:17.300 --> 46:18.540
 no matter what they said.

46:20.060 --> 46:21.860
 And as a result, what you find is,

46:21.860 --> 46:24.700
 is a world in which there's no ability

46:24.700 --> 46:26.500
 to get people to say, no, I'm not gonna sign

46:26.500 --> 46:30.300
 your diversity and inclusion forced loyalty oath.

46:30.300 --> 46:32.180
 I won't sign any loyalty oath.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.680
 Get the hell out of my office.

46:34.740 --> 46:35.580
 FU.

46:36.420 --> 46:39.160
 FU, and you're connecting money to that, but.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.620
 Well, my point is, is that academic freedom

46:41.620 --> 46:45.420
 is the, the whole idea behind it

46:45.420 --> 46:48.460
 was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire

46:48.460 --> 46:50.020
 on a much smaller salary.

46:50.020 --> 46:50.940
 Right.

46:50.940 --> 46:51.780
 Okay.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.140
 We've lost that.

46:54.140 --> 46:56.340
 Yeah, the only reason in part

46:56.340 --> 47:00.900
 that I wanted to go into academic,

47:00.900 --> 47:02.260
 academics as a profession,

47:02.260 --> 47:04.740
 as opposed to wanting to do physical

47:04.740 --> 47:06.280
 or mathematical research.

47:07.340 --> 47:09.580
 The great prize was freedom.

47:09.580 --> 47:12.540
 And Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation,

47:12.540 --> 47:14.820
 previously of IBM research pointed it out.

47:14.820 --> 47:17.300
 He says, if you lose freedom,

47:17.300 --> 47:20.460
 you lose the only thing we had to offer top minds.

47:20.460 --> 47:23.180
 Top minds value their intellectual freedom

47:23.180 --> 47:26.140
 and their physical and economic security

47:26.140 --> 47:29.260
 at a different level than other human beings.

47:29.260 --> 47:31.140
 And so people say, you know,

47:32.580 --> 47:33.420
 I don't understand, dude,

47:33.420 --> 47:35.220
 and you have the ability to do X, Y, and Z.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.060
 What's the problem?

47:36.060 --> 47:37.900
 It's like, well, I value my ability

47:37.900 --> 47:40.240
 to raise the middle finger as an American,

47:41.180 --> 47:43.200
 practically above everything else.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.900
 I want to talk to you about freedom here

47:46.900 --> 47:49.180
 in the context of something you've mentioned,

47:49.180 --> 47:52.400
 which is one way to take away freedom

47:52.400 --> 47:55.860
 is to put a human being into a cage

47:55.860 --> 47:57.380
 to create constraints.

47:57.380 --> 47:58.660
 The other one that worries me

47:58.660 --> 48:00.220
 is something that I think you've spoken to

48:00.220 --> 48:03.440
 to Twitter a little bit on Twitter,

48:03.440 --> 48:08.440
 is we bleed freedom by kind of slowly

48:12.900 --> 48:16.620
 scaring you into not doing,

48:16.620 --> 48:19.740
 not expressing the full spectrum of opportunities

48:19.740 --> 48:20.580
 you can as freedom.

48:20.580 --> 48:22.720
 So like when you ban Donald Trump,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.360
 when you ban Parler,

48:27.360 --> 48:30.180
 you give a little doubt in the minds of millions,

48:30.180 --> 48:33.060
 like me, a person who's a tech person,

48:33.060 --> 48:35.780
 who's an entrepreneur,

48:35.780 --> 48:36.620
 there's a little,

48:36.620 --> 48:38.660
 that's what I'm afraid of when I look in the mirror,

48:38.660 --> 48:41.260
 is there now a little doubt in there

48:41.260 --> 48:43.740
 that limits the amount of options I will try?

48:43.740 --> 48:47.500
 How certain are you that the COVID virus

48:47.500 --> 48:49.900
 didn't come from the Wuhan lab

48:49.900 --> 48:52.140
 and is biosafety level four?

48:52.140 --> 48:55.860
 We both know that we're both supposed to robotically say

48:57.000 --> 48:59.580
 the idea that the COVID virus came from a lab

48:59.580 --> 49:01.500
 is a discredited conspiracy theory.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.780
 There is no evidence that suggests that this is true.

49:03.780 --> 49:05.900
 The World Health Organization and the CDC

49:05.900 --> 49:08.100
 have both opined this to say otherwise

49:08.100 --> 49:09.660
 would be incredibly irresponsible.

49:09.660 --> 49:11.900
 And the threat of that is the thing

49:11.900 --> 49:16.780
 that ultimately limits the freedoms we feel.

49:16.780 --> 49:19.460
 I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time.

49:20.660 --> 49:22.060
 And you're afraid.

49:22.060 --> 49:23.500
 It's also boring.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.540
 I mean, I said it in the public.

49:25.540 --> 49:26.380
 Many times.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.820
 Why is it we don't ask where the records are

49:28.820 --> 49:29.700
 from Villard House?

49:29.700 --> 49:30.860
 Where are the financial records?

49:30.860 --> 49:32.940
 Where are the SEC filings?

49:32.940 --> 49:35.540
 Where are the questions on the record

49:35.540 --> 49:39.220
 to the intelligence agencies?

49:39.220 --> 49:42.340
 Was he known to be part of the intelligence community?

49:42.340 --> 49:46.060
 So we're not interested in asking questions.

49:46.060 --> 49:51.060
 Like, am I gonna die as a result of asking the question,

49:51.180 --> 49:53.460
 was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community

49:53.460 --> 49:54.980
 of any nation?

49:54.980 --> 49:56.240
 Is there a reason we're not asking

49:56.240 --> 49:58.480
 about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund

49:58.480 --> 49:59.440
 that he didn't run?

49:59.440 --> 50:02.900
 It's just like the Wuhan lab.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.580
 Okay, how do we get to the core of the Jeffrey Epstein,

50:05.580 --> 50:08.820
 the truth behind Jeffrey Epstein in a sense?

50:08.820 --> 50:10.860
 I mean, there's some things that are just like

50:10.860 --> 50:12.740
 useless conspiracy theories around it,

50:12.740 --> 50:13.720
 even if they're true.

50:13.720 --> 50:14.560
 There's some things that get to say it.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.500
 I hate to say it.

50:15.500 --> 50:17.000
 You're not gonna like it.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.600
 Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break in

50:20.600 --> 50:23.200
 of the Citizens Committee to investigate the FBI.

50:24.220 --> 50:27.140
 Those kids, and by the way, they weren't all kids,

50:27.140 --> 50:30.360
 did what had to be done.

50:31.540 --> 50:33.760
 They broke in, they broke the law.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.100
 It was an incredible act of civil disobedience.

50:37.060 --> 50:40.260
 And God bless Judy Feingold for taking to her,

50:40.260 --> 50:42.520
 she was going to take to her grave,

50:42.520 --> 50:43.640
 that she'd been part of this,

50:43.640 --> 50:45.360
 like the coolest thing of all time.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.580
 They didn't say anything for forever.

50:47.580 --> 50:50.180
 So civil disobedience, I mean, you have to.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.300
 We are founded on civil disobedience.

50:52.300 --> 50:55.000
 Civil disobedience is incredibly,

50:55.000 --> 50:59.880
 you screw it up and you're just a vandal.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.560
 You screw it up, you're a hooligan.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.400
 Yeah.

51:02.400 --> 51:06.240
 Those cats were so disciplined.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.080
 It's an art form.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.760
 It was an art form and they risked everything.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.700
 They were willing to pay with their freedom.

51:14.100 --> 51:17.400
 Those are the sorts of people who earned the right

51:17.400 --> 51:18.760
 by putting themselves at risk.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.940
 I would not do this.

51:20.940 --> 51:24.960
 I am not volunteering to break into anything.

51:24.960 --> 51:28.680
 I think it was William Davidon who was a student

51:28.680 --> 51:32.080
 of Murray Gellman and a physics professor at Haverford

51:32.080 --> 51:36.040
 who corralled these people and led this effort.

51:36.040 --> 51:40.840
 And right now, what we need is somebody to blow the lid

51:40.840 --> 51:43.120
 off of what is controlling everything.

51:43.120 --> 51:47.500
 We have, I'm happy to hear that it's a system

51:47.500 --> 51:48.720
 of incentive structures,

51:48.720 --> 51:50.320
 that it's a system of selective pressures.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.240
 I'm happy to find out that it's emergent.

51:52.240 --> 51:54.040
 I'm happy to find that it's partially directed

51:54.040 --> 51:56.520
 by our own intelligence community.

51:56.520 --> 52:00.160
 I'm happy to hear that, in fact, we've been penetrated

52:00.160 --> 52:04.080
 by North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia.

52:04.080 --> 52:07.220
 But I need to know why people aren't,

52:07.220 --> 52:09.960
 like the firebombing of the courthouse in Portland, Oregon

52:09.960 --> 52:11.340
 has no explanation.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.080
 And somehow this is normal.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.320
 This is not normal to any human being.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.320
 We have video that people don't believe.

52:19.320 --> 52:24.320
 And I come back to the shaggy defense of it wasn't me.

52:24.680 --> 52:29.680
 You know, so it's like, you remember that song?

52:30.240 --> 52:33.680
 Shaggy, yeah, it wasn't me caught you banging

52:33.680 --> 52:35.080
 in the shower on the counter.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.760
 Yeah, exactly, it wasn't me.

52:36.760 --> 52:37.600
 It wasn't me.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.760
 He says, but his friend says,

52:39.760 --> 52:41.880
 well, your strategy makes no sense at all.

52:41.880 --> 52:44.600
 Well, this is what MSNBC is doing.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.520
 You dropped it from the graphic, it wasn't me.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.360
 It wasn't me.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.540
 You came up with another Yang, it wasn't me.

52:52.480 --> 52:55.480
 I will never see MSNBC the same again.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.720
 So you've spoken about him before.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.520
 I think it'd be nice to maybe honor him

53:00.520 --> 53:02.320
 to break it apart a little bit.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.400
 Aaron Schwartz.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.520
 Yeah.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.640
 Why was he a special human being in this ilk

53:08.640 --> 53:11.720
 of what we're talking about now, civil disobedience?

53:11.720 --> 53:15.880
 How do we honor him now moving forward as human beings

53:15.880 --> 53:19.080
 who are willing to take risks in this world?

53:19.080 --> 53:20.160
 Well, I don't know.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.760
 I mean, are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz?

53:23.760 --> 53:24.600
 I am.

53:24.600 --> 53:25.720
 How do you feel about JSTOR?

53:25.720 --> 53:27.400
 Let's talk about JSTOR first.

53:27.400 --> 53:30.920
 So let's say what JSTOR is all about, right?

53:30.920 --> 53:34.520
 We the taxpayer pay for research.

53:36.080 --> 53:41.080
 And then the people who do the research

53:41.140 --> 53:43.360
 do all the work for a bunch of companies

53:43.360 --> 53:47.020
 who then charge us $30 an article

53:47.020 --> 53:48.940
 to read what it is that we already paid for.

53:48.940 --> 53:51.360
 And if we don't cite these articles,

53:51.360 --> 53:53.400
 we're told that we're in violation.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.240
 Okay.

53:55.280 --> 53:58.240
 I almost never call for civil disobedience

53:58.240 --> 54:03.240
 because I don't really want to, but fuck JSTOR,

54:03.280 --> 54:05.200
 fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.280
 Who the fuck are these people?

54:07.280 --> 54:08.120
 Yeah.

54:08.120 --> 54:13.120
 Get the smart people need to take the greedy people

54:15.920 --> 54:19.680
 behind the woodshed and explain to them what science is.

54:19.680 --> 54:23.440
 I have a very old fashioned idea that's so out of favor

54:23.440 --> 54:26.200
 that I will immediately be seen as a knuckle dragger.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.680
 Yeah.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.800
 I believe in the great woman theory of history

54:29.800 --> 54:31.700
 and the great man theory of history.

54:31.700 --> 54:34.700
 Emmy Nerder is fantastic as an example.

54:34.700 --> 54:39.700
 As an example, and I believe in editors over peer reviewers.

54:41.420 --> 54:43.820
 And I believe that wrong things should be allowed

54:43.820 --> 54:45.180
 into the literature.

54:45.180 --> 54:48.340
 And I believe that the gatekeeping should go towards zero

54:48.340 --> 54:52.020
 because the costs associated with distribution

54:52.020 --> 54:53.300
 are very, very slight.

54:53.300 --> 54:57.020
 I believe that we should be looking

54:57.020 --> 55:01.180
 at the perverse incentives of sending your paper blindly

55:01.180 --> 55:02.620
 into your competitor's clutches,

55:02.620 --> 55:05.260
 particularly if you're a young person being reviewed

55:05.260 --> 55:06.520
 by an older person.

55:07.460 --> 55:10.420
 Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor?

55:11.920 --> 55:14.320
 Are you familiar with the legend of the Magnaia?

55:15.820 --> 55:18.420
 No, the Magnaia is the Miller's daughter

55:18.420 --> 55:21.500
 and the largest food fight in the entire universe,

55:21.500 --> 55:25.660
 I believe is held, I think in Italy,

55:25.660 --> 55:27.640
 it's called the Battle of the Oranges.

55:27.640 --> 55:31.420
 And it celebrates the Miller's daughter

55:31.420 --> 55:34.540
 who had fallen in love with her beloved.

55:34.540 --> 55:38.380
 And when it came time for them to marry,

55:38.380 --> 55:41.980
 the virginal Magnaia was in fact told

55:41.980 --> 55:46.060
 that the Lord of the land had the right

55:46.060 --> 55:48.820
 to have the first night with the bride.

55:48.820 --> 55:51.340
 Well, the Magnaia had a different idea.

55:51.340 --> 55:56.020
 So she seemed to consent to this perhaps mythical right,

55:56.020 --> 55:59.220
 also called the Prima Note, the first night.

55:59.220 --> 56:04.080
 And by legend, she concealed a dagger underneath her robes.

56:05.580 --> 56:08.460
 And when it came time for the hated Lord of the Manor

56:08.460 --> 56:13.460
 to extract this right, she pulled the knife out

56:13.700 --> 56:14.540
 and killed him.

56:14.540 --> 56:16.320
 And I think it also echoes a little bit

56:16.320 --> 56:19.260
 of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.580
 But that inspired both men and women.

56:23.580 --> 56:26.100
 And the Magnaia is the legendary hero.

56:26.100 --> 56:30.960
 So right now, what we need to do is we need

56:30.960 --> 56:35.960
 to resist the Prima Note, the right of first look, right?

56:36.160 --> 56:38.320
 F you, you don't have the right of first look.

56:38.320 --> 56:40.760
 I don't wanna send something blindly to my competitors.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.800
 I don't wanna subject myself to you naming

56:42.800 --> 56:44.680
 what work I've done.

56:45.760 --> 56:48.020
 Why are you in my story?

56:48.020 --> 56:50.000
 That's my question, get out of my story.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.640
 If I do work and then you have an idea,

56:52.640 --> 56:54.400
 oh, well, it's the Matthew principle.

56:54.400 --> 56:57.720
 To him who has much more will be given.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.640
 I've gone to the National Academy of Sciences

56:59.640 --> 57:00.860
 and talked about these things.

57:00.860 --> 57:03.720
 And it's funny, I've been laughed at by the older people

57:03.720 --> 57:07.080
 who think, well, Eric, you know science proceeds

57:07.080 --> 57:09.720
 funeral by funeral, that's Planck.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.080
 You know the Matthew principle,

57:11.080 --> 57:12.200
 you know the Matilda principle,

57:12.200 --> 57:14.520
 the things done by women are attributed to men.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.280
 That these are not new.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.760
 And you guys just live like this?

57:17.760 --> 57:20.920
 Yeah, so the Revolutionary Act now is to resist

57:20.920 --> 57:23.920
 all of these things that are not new.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.440
 So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.240
 Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.360
 One of the things you've done very beautifully

57:29.360 --> 57:31.880
 is to communicate love.

57:31.880 --> 57:35.560
 And I think about some of our conversations.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.280
 And you got me to talk a little bit about

57:37.280 --> 57:41.480
 my own experiences in 02138 and 39.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.740
 We are the product of our trauma.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.160
 And what people don't understand is that very often

57:51.160 --> 57:54.720
 when you see people taking countermeasures

57:54.720 --> 57:57.840
 against what appear to be imaginary forces,

57:57.840 --> 57:59.720
 they're really actually replaying things

57:59.720 --> 58:01.120
 that really happened to them.

58:02.640 --> 58:05.480
 And having been through this system and watching

58:05.480 --> 58:08.280
 all of the ways in which it completely rewrites

58:08.280 --> 58:10.720
 the lives of the people who I am counting on

58:10.720 --> 58:12.760
 to cure our diseases, build our new industries,

58:12.760 --> 58:14.280
 keep us safe from our foes,

58:15.800 --> 58:18.760
 the amount of pressure the system is putting

58:18.760 --> 58:23.320
 on the most hopeful minds is unimaginable.

58:23.320 --> 58:26.680
 And so my goal is to empower somebody

58:26.680 --> 58:28.600
 like an Aaron Schwartz in memory

58:29.560 --> 58:32.320
 and to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation.

58:32.320 --> 58:36.640
 Do you know that the first person outside of me

58:36.640 --> 58:39.920
 to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein?

58:42.280 --> 58:44.920
 How did he know I was working on this?

58:44.920 --> 58:46.000
 I don't know.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.320
 So your ideas that formed geometric unity

58:49.320 --> 58:51.880
 was something that his eyes have seen?

58:51.880 --> 58:55.120
 I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein

58:55.120 --> 58:59.120
 as one of the only people who could help me.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.760
 No, no, no, listen to this.

59:00.760 --> 59:01.760
 Yeah, how does this connect?

59:01.760 --> 59:06.400
 Okay, well, first of all, my old synagogue,

59:06.400 --> 59:10.000
 my old shul was the conservative minion at Harvard Hillel.

59:11.200 --> 59:14.240
 And I believe it's called Rosovsky Hall

59:14.240 --> 59:17.240
 after Henry Rosovsky in the economics department,

59:17.240 --> 59:20.240
 who was a Japan scholar, if I'm correct.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.440
 And he became provost or dean of Harvard.

59:25.160 --> 59:28.160
 I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein's money.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.840
 And I wondered in part whether the Jewish students

59:32.840 --> 59:35.720
 at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck

59:35.720 --> 59:37.320
 of Harvard Hillel.

59:37.320 --> 59:39.080
 So that was something I found very curious,

59:39.080 --> 59:40.520
 but I don't know much about it.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.240
 I also found that Jeffrey Epstein hanging around

59:43.240 --> 59:46.440
 scientists, I don't think that either you or Joe exactly,

59:46.440 --> 59:51.440
 I mean, got me correct in your last interchange.

59:51.440 --> 59:53.120
 For the record, for people who haven't listened

59:53.120 --> 59:55.760
 to Joe Rogan program, Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein

59:55.760 --> 59:57.960
 was the only person who has gotten laid.

59:57.960 --> 59:58.800
 Paid.

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.840
 Oh, paid.

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:04.560
 And you said you also got paid as a young man, right?

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:07.600
 I believe the word was laid, but allegedly.

1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:09.800
 My hearing isn't so good at age 55.

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.400
 All right, leaving that aside.

1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:16.120
 Leaving that aside, what was Jeffrey Epstein doing

1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:18.080
 hanging around all of these scientists?

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:20.760
 I don't think that was the same program

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:24.760
 that was about compromising political leaders

1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:27.360
 and business people and entertainment figures.

1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:29.120
 I think these are two different programs

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:31.760
 that were being run through one individual.

1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:35.480
 And Joe seemed to think that I didn't think he was smooth.

1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:36.740
 I thought he was glib.

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.960
 I think what Joe is really trying to get at is that

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:43.240
 I found his mysticism meretricious.

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:48.120
 He had an ability to deflect every conversation

1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:50.160
 that might go towards revealing

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:51.640
 that he didn't know what he was talking about.

1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:54.640
 Every time you started to get close to something

1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:55.820
 where the rubber hit the road,

1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:58.320
 the rubber wouldn't hit the road.

1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:02.400
 And yet, can you help me untangle the fact

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:07.260
 that you thought deeply about the physics

1:01:07.260 --> 1:01:10.520
 of the nature of our universe

1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:13.520
 and Jeffrey Epstein was interested?

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:14.840
 How did he know?

1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:17.420
 I wasn't really talking about this stuff until,

1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:22.240
 even my close friends didn't really know what I was up to.

1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:25.360
 And yet you're saying he did not have

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:27.540
 sufficient brilliance to understand

1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:28.660
 when the rubber hit the road.

1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:33.080
 So why did he have sufficient interest and curiosity?

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:34.660
 I'll tell you what I thought.

1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:36.160
 I had been waiting to find out,

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:38.380
 does my government even know I exist?

1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:40.960
 Do you have an answer to that question?

1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:44.320
 I have, a couple times the government

1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:45.440
 has reached out to me.

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.600
 In general, there is zero interest in me,

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.420
 like less than zero interest.

1:01:52.420 --> 1:01:54.440
 I find that fascinating.

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:56.320
 As far as you know, right?

1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:57.680
 Well, that's what I'm trying to say.

1:01:57.680 --> 1:01:59.800
 The question about not being able to see

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:01.960
 through a half silvered mirror,

1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:03.580
 you don't know what's going on

1:02:03.580 --> 1:02:04.940
 behind the half silvered mirror.

1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:09.120
 To you, it's all you see is your reflection.

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:10.920
 But your intuition still holds,

1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:12.980
 like this is where I've mentioned that I,

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:16.200
 this is where I'll say naive dumb things,

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:20.880
 but I still hold on to this intuition that Jeff,

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:21.920
 I'm not confident in this,

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:25.160
 but I lean towards that direction

1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:27.360
 that Jeffrey Epstein is the source of evil,

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.760
 not something that's underlying him.

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.480
 You have a bias.

1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:32.760
 It's different than mine.

1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:35.200
 Our Bayesian priors are tutored

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.760
 by different life experiences.

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:42.200
 If I was mostly concerned, like Sam Harris is concerned,

1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:44.360
 that people fill their heads with nonsense,

1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:47.700
 I would have a very strong sense

1:02:47.700 --> 1:02:49.400
 that people need order in the world,

1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:51.720
 that they take mysterious situations,

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:53.640
 they build entire castles in the air,

1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:56.440
 and then they go move in if they really get crazy.

1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:01.000
 The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.640
 and psychotics move in.

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.000
 Coming from a progressive family,

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.480
 we had a different experience.

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:07.720
 It's really weird when the government

1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:09.000
 is actually out to get you,

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.060
 when they actually send a spy,

1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:14.000
 when they actually engage in disinformation campaigns,

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.640
 when they smear you.

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:19.040
 And if you've ever had that brought to bear on your family,

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:22.600
 you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding of the country,

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:25.200
 which is different than having a,

1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:27.200
 wow, do people believe crazy stuff

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.820
 because they watch too much TV.

1:03:29.820 --> 1:03:32.280
 And both of these things have some merit to them,

1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:34.200
 but it's a question of regulated expression.

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.460
 When do you want to express more Sam Harris

1:03:36.460 --> 1:03:38.800
 and when do you want to express more Howard Zinn?

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.400
 And you can express both, correct?

1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:42.840
 The one human being can express both?

1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.940
 Sure, but there's a trade off between them.

1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:47.640
 In other words, most people like the Michael Shermers

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.680
 of the world are gonna tilt very strongly

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:52.440
 to extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:54.320
 So you're gonna have that kind of energy.

1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:55.600
 And then somebody else is gonna say,

1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:58.240
 how many times do I have to get hit on,

1:03:58.240 --> 1:03:59.760
 how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:02.040
 before I realize that there's a problem?

1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:04.680
 So my feeling about this is yes,

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:06.520
 people see patterns in clouds.

1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:09.240
 They see faces and scripture and all sorts of things,

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:10.680
 and it's just random cloud patterns.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:13.880
 And it's also the case that there's tremendous pressure

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.180
 not to see conspiracies when conspiracies

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:18.400
 are relatively more common than the people

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:21.280
 who shout conspiracy theory will claim.

1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:22.680
 So both of these things are true.

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:25.160
 And you have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn

1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:26.920
 and when your inner Harris?

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:27.880
 And those are different.

1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:28.720
 I want to find them out.

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:31.500
 The difference in you and I biases aside

1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:33.480
 is you've actually met Jeffrey Epstein.

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:38.480
 And I'm listening to reverberations years later

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:42.920
 of stories and narratives throughout the story.

1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:44.480
 Luckily, I only met him once.

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:49.280
 And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:51.080
 with him other than the one meeting.

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:54.360
 You can learn a lot in just a few words, right,

1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:55.200
 from a human being.

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:57.640
 Well, that's true, but I think that the bigger issue

1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:01.240
 was I saw something that I don't hear much remarked upon,

1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:05.020
 which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is.

1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:08.760
 In other words, there's the National Science Foundation,

1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:11.440
 National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes.

1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.260
 There's all this stuff that kind of has the same feel to it,

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:18.200
 a little bit of variation and difference,

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:19.260
 Department of Energy.

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:23.900
 If you fall outside of that, there's just Jeffrey Epstein.

1:05:23.900 --> 1:05:25.200
 That's what you're told.

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:26.040
 Yes.

1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:26.860
 That's not quite true.

1:05:26.860 --> 1:05:30.000
 There's Kavli, maybe Jim Simons is now in the game.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.040
 Peter Thiel has done some stuff.

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:35.160
 You had Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try.

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:38.340
 So there is other money running around, Templeton.

1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:41.960
 But very strongly, there was a belief

1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:44.040
 that if you're doing something really innovative

1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:48.200
 and the system can't fund it because we become pussies,

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:49.560
 Jeffrey Epstein's your guy.

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.200
 So there's like this funnel

1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:53.080
 that you're supposed to go through.

1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:54.000
 That's right.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.360
 And the idea is that you get called

1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:00.360
 the great man's house and the sort of lubricious version

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:07.880
 of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions.

1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:10.960
 And maybe he has an island, maybe he has a plane.

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:15.960
 And when you're starved, somebody showing you a feast

1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.720
 or when you're dehydrated in a death's door

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:25.720
 and somebody says, oh, I have a well, that's what it is.

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:32.280
 And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing

1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:34.840
 money into the science system so that we don't have

1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:38.200
 super creeps trying to learn all of our secrets

1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:39.320
 ahead of time?

1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:42.280
 WTF, what is your problem with transparency

1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:43.320
 and taxpayer dollars?

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:46.480
 Just all of you, you wouldn't have a country.

1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:47.880
 You'd be speaking German.

1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:51.240
 So essentially you believe that human beings

1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:54.080
 would not be able to, when the money is lacking

1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:55.840
 in the system, like in research.

1:06:55.840 --> 1:06:57.200
 We produce public goods.

1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:00.320
 You and I are meant to produce public goods.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:03.280
 Now I sell Athletic Greens and I sell Theragun

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:07.720
 and I sell Unagi scooters and Chili Pad.

1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:09.640
 Can I be honest, I love these products,

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:14.640
 but I didn't get into this game for the purpose of selling.

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:19.640
 I'm trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle?

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:22.800
 But you know something Lex, I don't know why you built

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.640
 this channel, it's kind of a mystery.

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:26.040
 I don't know why.

1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:28.200
 I'll tell you why I built my channel.

1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:32.360
 It's gonna be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley.

1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:37.360
 I got rolled multiple times and my point is I didn't want

1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:41.040
 to become a celebrity, I didn't want to become well known,

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:46.040
 but it's a lot harder to roll somebody who's getting,

1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.800
 I think I'm, I don't know if this is mistaken,

1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:52.160
 but I think I'm the math PhD with the largest number

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.400
 of followers on Twitter.

1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:58.760
 And there was nothing you could do before.

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:01.000
 I mean again, to put a little responsibility on you,

1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.880
 so you've created something really special

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:06.200
 for the distribution of your own ideas.

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:11.040
 I mean, but because it's not necessarily currently scalable,

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:15.720
 you also, perhaps you and I have the responsibility

1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:19.480
 of giving other people also a chance to spread their ideas.

1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:21.320
 I mean Joe Rogan did this very effectively

1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:23.720
 for a bunch of people that.

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:26.440
 That's why they're angry at him because he's a gatekeeper

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:29.600
 and he let all sorts of people through that gate

1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:32.840
 from Roger Penrose to Alex Jones.

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:37.840
 To Jordan Peterson to, I mean, even first of all, to you.

1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:39.920
 To Abby Martin.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:40.840
 To Abby Martin.

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.040
 To Barry Weiss.

1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:43.640
 Yeah.

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:44.700
 That's the problem.

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:48.960
 Well, but you have not successfully built up a thing

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.280
 that allows that to carry that forward.

1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:52.000
 Oh no, no, no, no.

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000
 We are all vulnerable to reputational attack

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:59.840
 because what happens, you see, the problem, Lex,

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:02.920
 is that you are now an institution at some level.

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.560
 You walk around with all this equipment in a duffel bag.

1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:10.520
 The last suit you'll ever need.

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:15.520
 And you have the reach of something like CNN

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:17.740
 to people who matter.

1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:20.320
 Okay.

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.540
 So now the question is, how do we control something

1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:25.360
 that doesn't have a board, doesn't have shareholders,

1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:28.460
 doesn't have to make SEC filings, FCC.

1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:31.420
 So the best answer they have is,

1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:36.360
 well, we just have to destroy reputations.

1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:38.400
 All it takes is for us to take something

1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:40.160
 that gets said or done or alleged.

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:43.080
 And I think it's incredibly important.

1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:46.000
 One of the things people don't understand is that

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.760
 I'm going to fight general reputational attacks.

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.560
 Not because some people don't deserve

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:55.160
 to have their reputations dragged through the mud,

1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:58.260
 but because it's too powerful of a tool

1:09:58.260 --> 1:10:02.880
 to hand it to CNN, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard,

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:04.440
 the State Department.

1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:05.280
 Yes.

1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:07.460
 But some of it is also.

1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:09.060
 J.P. Morgan.

1:10:09.060 --> 1:10:13.520
 Muhammad Ali style, being good enough at

1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:17.040
 doing everything you need to do

1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:21.660
 without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks.

1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:25.080
 Not being afraid, but not giving enough meat.

1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:28.040
 I don't see why the people who have good ideas

1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:30.200
 have to lead lives that are that clean.

1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:31.040
 If you can do it.

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:32.200
 You can be messy, yeah.

1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.000
 You should be able to be messy.

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:37.060
 Otherwise, we're suppressing too many people.

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:39.040
 Too many, too brilliant minds.

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:39.880
 Yeah.

1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:42.720
 Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt?

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.400
 I still, people tell me this.

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:48.000
 Okay, I have discussions about Elon and people,

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.120
 the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist,

1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:56.220
 who's talking about a Muammuah

1:10:56.220 --> 1:10:58.520
 that it might be alien technology.

1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:03.520
 He told me his, this outside the box thinker.

1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:05.200
 Yeah.

1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:09.560
 When speaking to me about Elon said,

1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:13.880
 called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed.

1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:14.720
 The blunt.

1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:15.540
 I love it.

1:11:15.540 --> 1:11:16.480
 In a dismissive way.

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:20.160
 Like this guy's crazy because he smoked some weed.

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.560
 I was looking at him.

1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:23.040
 I was like, why?

1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:24.160
 Wow.

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:25.140
 Wow.

1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:26.880
 I think you should be able to have

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:30.320
 consensual drug filled orgies.

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.480
 Fuck perfect lives.

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:34.360
 Yeah, you should be allowed to be messy.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:35.200
 Yeah, right.

1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:36.040
 I take back my statement.

1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:37.120
 I'm just saying.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:40.340
 Respectability is the unique prison

1:11:40.340 --> 1:11:43.060
 where all of the gates are open

1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:45.600
 and the inmates beg to stay inside.

1:11:46.940 --> 1:11:49.800
 It's time to end their prison of respectability

1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:53.020
 because it's too effective of a means of sidelining

1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:54.720
 and silencing people.

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:58.880
 Including it is better that we have bad people

1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:03.880
 in our system than this idea of no platforming people

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:08.200
 who are beyond the pale because it's such a simple technique.

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:11.780
 So how do we, what's the heroic action here on the?

1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:15.280
 Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program.

1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:20.280
 By the way, she was absolutely delightful as a guest.

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.840
 She was, she is polite in the extreme,

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:26.060
 far more polite than I am.

1:12:26.060 --> 1:12:29.380
 And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest

1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:32.200
 because I wanted to highlight this program can go anywhere.

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:33.640
 We can talk to anyone.

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.600
 What about social media?

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:37.080
 You've started highlighting people being banned

1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:38.720
 on social media.

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.440
 How do we fight this?

1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.240
 Like if you get banned from social media,

1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.520
 so you're saying nobody will stand up to me.

1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:46.440
 Well, just figure out what your incentive structure

1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:47.280
 is before.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.660
 Assume that I get banned on social media

1:12:49.660 --> 1:12:51.120
 because somebody wants to make sure

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.720
 that my message doesn't interfere

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:55.080
 with the dominant narrative.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:55.920
 Okay.

1:12:58.920 --> 1:12:59.960
 What will happen, by the way,

1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:02.320
 I'm very glad to be able to explain this on your show

1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:05.720
 because that video will presumably be archived

1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:08.920
 and they can't easily make you take it down.

1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:09.800
 Okay.

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:11.300
 So what's gonna happen is,

1:13:11.300 --> 1:13:12.640
 is that there'll be a whole bunch

1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:16.960
 of very low quality bot like accounts

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:19.240
 that dog you every time you talk about me.

1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:22.160
 Right, dude, it's getting old, getting boring.

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.480
 We already heard you.

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:25.860
 Dude, that was like, let it go.

1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:27.120
 Not a good look.

1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:29.200
 Not a good look is one of my favorites.

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:30.960
 But what about the high profile ones?

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:32.800
 Well, then you'll get a few high profile ones

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:37.100
 and some of the high profile ones command armies.

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:37.940
 Right.

1:13:37.940 --> 1:13:40.280
 Like at some point I had 10,000 people

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:43.560
 using exactly the same templated tweet, tweeting at me.

1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:45.340
 It was just actually, it got to the point

1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:48.000
 where it was funny because everybody said,

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.960
 did you hear that in a hipster coffee shop?

1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:50.800
 And I was like,

1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.840
 why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee?

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:54.220
 Just hilarious.

1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.940
 Those things will cause you to think better of it.

1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:01.180
 You'll start to see your follower count go down

1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:04.480
 because it's easy to give you a bunch of bot like follows

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.060
 and then just pull them.

1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:09.680
 So I think that's pretty well known how,

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:11.600
 and then maybe your account will be suspended

1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.440
 and it can't be revoked and et cetera, et cetera.

1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.380
 And then three days later, you'll be told it was an error.

1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:18.320
 So let me push back.

1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:20.480
 I just don't see not defending you.

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.760
 Like, okay, so what are the things you would do

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:27.840
 that given that I can actually talk to you offline,

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:31.360
 that would make me not defend you?

1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:37.640
 Well, first of all, I can't, I mean, I can imagine some,

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.640
 but all of us have things.

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:41.800
 If somebody says, do you hear what your boy,

1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:43.560
 Lex said about you?

1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.660
 What did Lex say about me?

1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:48.320
 Oh, he said you were flawed, dude.

1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:49.160
 Oh, shit.

1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:53.760
 They so distressed

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:57.060
 because none of us wanna stand behind flawed people.

1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:58.760
 That's why you have everybody rushing to say,

1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:00.080
 I neither condemn nor condone.

1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:02.780
 I know I don't condemn nor, what is that?

1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:03.620
 We're all trying to say.

1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:04.980
 By the way, for the record,

1:15:04.980 --> 1:15:07.340
 I said that Eric is smarter than me

1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:10.880
 in a brilliant human being, but flawed like all humans are.

1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.160
 My point is I've now come up with a new policy,

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:16.700
 which is I don't care what my friends have done.

1:15:17.580 --> 1:15:20.040
 I am not disavowing my friends,

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:22.080
 not because they didn't do the wrong thing.

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:23.380
 Maybe they did do the wrong thing.

1:15:23.380 --> 1:15:24.220
 I don't know.

1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:28.320
 What's the value of friendship if that's not that?

1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:29.920
 Like, for example, we've had the situation

1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:30.880
 with Brian Callan.

1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.000
 Brian Callan was featured recently in the Los Angeles Times.

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.920
 I know nothing about the allegations.

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:39.760
 I can't, I didn't even know Brian at the time, right?

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:42.340
 I've known him for roughly the time I've been in Los Angeles,

1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:44.960
 maybe a year and a half during that period of time.

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:46.560
 I've never seen anything wrong.

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:50.040
 Now I'm in a situation, well, what do you think he did?

1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:50.880
 Do you think he didn't?

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:52.440
 It's like, you know what?

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:54.660
 I don't know, but I do know this.

1:15:54.660 --> 1:15:56.880
 Everyone's entitled to have friends

1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:59.060
 because we can't afford isolated people.

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.200
 And if your friends do the wrong thing,

1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.280
 they're still your friends.

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.200
 And if they do terrible, terrible things,

1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.960
 you bring that up with them privately.

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:12.400
 And it's not my responsibility to disavow in public.

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:15.840
 We've had the situation that I don't like

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:19.240
 where particular people that I've been close to,

1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:21.880
 I'm put under tremendous pressure to disavow them.

1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:24.160
 What do you think now about your buddy?

1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:26.040
 I like Dave Rubin, all that kind of stuff.

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.960
 Here's the thing, my friends are my friends.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:30.760
 I don't disavow my friends.

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:34.300
 We all need to make a statement

1:16:34.300 --> 1:16:36.760
 that we will not be brought under pressure

1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:40.840
 to disavow our friends, our family members,

1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:45.840
 because mass murderers are dangerous

1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:48.140
 the more isolated they become.

1:16:48.140 --> 1:16:52.920
 It is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people.

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:53.760
 Yes.

1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:54.600
 And it's dangerous, and so.

1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:56.400
 And it sends a signal to everybody else

1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:00.720
 to fit in, to be more cynical about the human.

1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:04.140
 So my feeling, if I find out you've been selling heroin

1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:06.480
 to elementary school students,

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:09.480
 you're still my friend, and I will not be disavowing you.

1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:11.840
 And if I have a problem with you selling heroin

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:14.900
 to elementary school students during school hours,

1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:18.800
 I will bring it up with you privately,

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:21.540
 because we don't need to hear my voice

1:17:21.540 --> 1:17:23.020
 added to that condemnation.

1:17:23.020 --> 1:17:25.020
 Are there things that you could do

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:27.880
 that would cause me to say, actually, F this guy?

1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:29.640
 Yeah, above and beyond that.

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.200
 But simply doing the wrong thing,

1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:34.760
 I think we've gone down a terrible path.

1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:37.280
 I think isolated people are about the most dangerous thing

1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:40.320
 we could have in a heavily armed society.

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:43.400
 So I deeply agree with you on Brian Callan

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:46.300
 and on all these people that, quote, unquote, got canceled.

1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:49.120
 And I'm not saying that they,

1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:52.080
 I don't know the truth value, because we can't.

1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:53.800
 And even if I did know the truth value,

1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:56.840
 I'm not setting up an incentive structure

1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:59.720
 for the personal destruction

1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.900
 as a means of letting institutions combat

1:18:02.900 --> 1:18:05.440
 the fact that individuals are the last thing that can say,

1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.080
 none of you guys make any sense.

1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:09.680
 I don't treat these things like,

1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:12.240
 I had a conversation where Kevin Spacey

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:15.540
 was at the dinner table when I came down from a hotel room.

1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:18.560
 And I had a very long conversation with Kevin Spacey.

1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:21.680
 I will not detail, because I don't do that,

1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:23.520
 as to what we discussed.

1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.020
 But we talked very specifically about him being canceled.

1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:30.280
 And I don't think that the world has heard that story

1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.760
 in part because there's a very strong sense

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:35.720
 that he has to be outgrouped.

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:39.200
 And as a result, I mean, do we want,

1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:42.920
 do we want to disavow the space program

1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:44.560
 because it touched Werner von Braun?

1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:46.180
 Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics

1:18:46.180 --> 1:18:49.400
 because Pascal Jordan and Werner Heisenberg passed through it?

1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:53.040
 Is Ehrenfest's theorem false because he murdered his child?

1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:55.720
 I mean, at what point do we recognize

1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:57.800
 that we are the problem?

1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:58.940
 Humans are humans.

1:18:58.940 --> 1:19:01.760
 And there is no perfect,

1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:03.080
 there is no perfect group of people,

1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:04.920
 even all of the most oppressed people,

1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:06.620
 the supposed victims of the world,

1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:08.440
 who we now have fetishized into thinking

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:09.520
 that they're all oracles

1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:12.080
 because their lived experience informs us

1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:14.920
 and their pain is more salient than everyone else's pain.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:18.420
 Those people aren't necessarily great people.

1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:24.800
 It's like none of us, we can't do this in this fashion.

1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:27.640
 So when we sit down to have a conversation

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:29.680
 across the table from somebody,

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:31.200
 you should be willing to,

1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:33.880
 like you should not have NPR in your mind.

1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.680
 You should be willing to take the full risk

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:38.680
 and to see the good in the person

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:41.920
 with limited information

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:44.520
 and to do your best to understand that person.

1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:47.200
 Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget.

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:51.480
 I don't believe this is of institutions, okay?

1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:52.920
 Everybody is entitled

1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:55.160
 to a certain amount of screwing up in life.

1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:57.800
 You're entitled to a mendacity budget.

1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:00.920
 You're entitled to an aggression budget.

1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:03.360
 The idea of getting rid of everybody,

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:06.800
 you know, people haven't even blown through their budgets

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:07.640
 and we're already.

1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:11.200
 Yeah, I think about, for example, one person,

1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:14.720
 I'd be curious to get your thoughts about Alex Jones.

1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:16.200
 Let's not talk about Alex Jones for a second.

1:20:16.200 --> 1:20:18.800
 Let's talk about the National Enquirer.

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:21.400
 Is everything the National Enquirer says false?

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:23.640
 No.

1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:25.200
 No.

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:27.400
 Okay, do you remember the John Edwards story?

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:30.080
 Did you cheat on his wife?

1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:30.920
 Sorry.

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:33.120
 He had a child from an extramarital affair.

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:34.440
 Yes.

1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:37.440
 I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story.

1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:41.120
 And then what does the New York Times do?

1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.880
 The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report

1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:46.280
 that the National Enquirer is making a claim.

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.040
 That way they don't have to substantiate the story.

1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:53.520
 So why is the New York Times talking to Mike Cernovich

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.160
 or using the National Enquirer as a source?

1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.280
 Are they using Alex Jones as a source?

1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:02.520
 Here's the big problem that we're having.

1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:05.840
 Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody

1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:08.240
 and other people are entitled to talk to no one?

1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:09.280
 I don't really understand this.

1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:10.880
 This is an indulgence system.

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:13.280
 This is how the Catholic church used to do things.

1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:15.520
 It's hard to fight the system because the reason

1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:17.960
 you don't talk to Alex Jones is because the platforms

1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:21.920
 on which we do the communication will deplatform.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:23.160
 I'm not platform.

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:27.800
 I used to do NPR and I used to do the NewsHour

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.960
 and I used to provide stories

1:21:29.960 --> 1:21:32.600
 to Washington Post, New York Times.

1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:33.840
 That has gone away.

1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:36.760
 They've circled the wagons closer and closer

1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:38.840
 and more of us are unacceptable.

1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:41.440
 And right now I have no question that they're going

1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:45.160
 through anybody who has a platform trying to say,

1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:46.760
 okay, what do we have against that person

1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:48.720
 in case we need to shut that down?

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:51.040
 We have to make a different decision, Lex,

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:54.280
 and the different decision is that it doesn't matter

1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:57.560
 how many times Joe said the N word.

1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:01.360
 It doesn't matter that somebody else,

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.520
 with mathematical theorems, if the worst person

1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:08.160
 in the world proves a mathematical theorem

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:11.360
 like the Unabomber, we can't undo the theorem.

1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:15.640
 And I point out Charles Manson's song,

1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:18.520
 Look at Your Game Girl is an amazing song.

1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:19.560
 It's a really good song.

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:22.120
 I don't think it's one of the greatest songs ever,

1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:24.360
 but it happens that he wasn't a no talent.

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:29.280
 And I don't know how Hitler was as an artist.

1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:30.760
 Fiction, not bad.

1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:33.720
 Okay, we've got to get past this.

1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:35.480
 We've got to get past this idea

1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:37.840
 that we're going to purge ourselves of our badness

1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:40.040
 and we're just going to, this is like,

1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:42.400
 I've likened it to teenage girls in cutting.

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:46.440
 We're just, all we're doing is destroying ourselves

1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:47.800
 in search of perfection.

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:49.920
 And the answer is no, we're not perfect.

1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:52.160
 We're flawed, we're screwed up.

1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:53.480
 And we've always been this way.

1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:55.360
 And we're not going to silence everyone

1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:57.560
 who you can point a laser beam at

1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:00.440
 and say, well, that person, look at how bad that person is.

1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:03.720
 If we do that, kiss the whole thing goodbye.

1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:05.880
 We might as well just, let's learn Chinese.

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:10.440
 But there is an art to having those messy conversations,

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.200
 whether with Alex or anybody else.

1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:15.120
 Okay, let's talk about Alex.

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:16.960
 There's particular stuff that Alex does

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:19.120
 that's absolutely nauseating.

1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:20.960
 And there's other stuff that he's doing that's funny.

1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:23.160
 The methodology of the way he carries.

1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:25.440
 And sometimes he's talking about the truth.

1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:27.400
 And sometimes he's talking about a conspiracy.

1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:30.360
 His variance is incredibly high.

1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:33.240
 The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O. Keefe

1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:36.160
 or the National Enquirer or anything you don't like

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.320
 is to say, great, go long short.

1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:43.840
 Well, if you invest in a mutual fund,

1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:46.840
 all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long.

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:48.880
 But if you invest in a hedge fund,

1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:51.160
 you do something called relative value trade.

1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:54.320
 It's like, well, you long tech or short tech?

1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:58.160
 Well, actually I'm long Microsoft and I'm short Google.

1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:00.280
 Why is that?

1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:03.760
 Oh, because I believe Google got way too much attention

1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:06.000
 and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned.

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.760
 And so this is really a play on legacy tech

1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:11.080
 over more modern tech, okay?

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.520
 Which part of Alex Jones are you long

1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:15.600
 and which part are you short?

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:17.360
 One of the things that should be a requirement

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:18.560
 for being a reporter is like,

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:21.280
 what did Donald Trump do that was good?

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:22.720
 Right. Nothing.

1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:25.160
 Okay, then you're not a reporter.

1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:26.800
 What did Hitler do that was good?

1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:31.400
 The Rosenstrasse of protest.

1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:37.360
 Non Jewish women campaign for their Jewish men

1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:39.240
 to be returned home to them

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.400
 from certain death almost in death camps.

1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:45.880
 It should have been that there were no death camps.

1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:48.760
 It should have been that everybody was returned home.

1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:50.280
 But you know what?

1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:53.640
 The fact that the women of the Rosenstrasse protest,

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:56.440
 I mean, sorry, I get very emotional about this.

1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:58.640
 Some of the baddest ass chicks in the world

1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.480
 got their husbands returned to them.

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.360
 Kolokavod.

1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.800
 And not, I'm not celebrating Hitler.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:11.720
 Hitler's the worst of the worst.

1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:15.600
 But God damn it, this idea that we can just say

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:17.760
 everything that person does is a lie.

1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:19.560
 Everything that person does is evil.

1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:23.360
 This reflects a simplicity of mind

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.920
 that humanity cannot afford.

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:30.720
 Is Google evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf?

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:32.960
 Is Amazon evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf?

1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.600
 If you find out that Mein Kampf

1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:35.760
 rests on somebody's bookshelves,

1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:37.520
 do you have any idea what it means?

1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:41.400
 If you find out that a scholar use the N word,

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:43.120
 should that person lose their job?

1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:44.840
 Come on.

1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:47.520
 Grow the hell up.

1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:50.840
 I guess our responsibility to lead by example in that,

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:53.520
 because you have to acknowledge that the fact,

1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:55.360
 like the current public discourse.

1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:58.360
 Have somebody on your podcast who you're worried about.

1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:03.720
 But do it in a principled fashion.

1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:08.480
 I mean, in other words, I'm not here to whitewash everything.

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.440
 On the other hand, if somebody makes some allegations,

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:16.280
 I don't know that I'm obligated

1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:19.160
 to treat every set of allegations as if,

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:21.600
 no, how do you defend yourself against, no.

1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.640
 Allegations are so cheap to make at this moment.

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:27.080
 Well, my standard, I don't know,

1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.080
 maybe you could speak to it is,

1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:31.800
 I don't care, like in the case of Alex Jones, for example,

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:35.280
 I don't, I'm willing to have a conversation

1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:37.400
 with Alex Jones and people like him.

1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:40.600
 If I know he's not going to try to manipulate me.

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:42.360
 Assume that he is gonna try to manipulate you.

1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.320
 I can't, then we're not going to be two humans.

1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:48.240
 Okay, but Lex, I want you to think well of me.

1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:51.480
 I put on a jacket, I don't usually wear a jacket, okay?

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:53.320
 Thank you, Eric.

1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:55.800
 All right, I'm trying to manipulate you.

1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:59.240
 There's an entire field, no, there's an entire field

1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:01.840
 that says that speech may be best thought of

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:04.160
 as an attempt to manipulate each other.

1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:06.480
 This is too simplistic.

1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.560
 Everything that we keep talking through.

1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:10.040
 Yes.

1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:11.560
 You know better than this.

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:15.720
 I disagree, I think there is ways,

1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:18.320
 there's, of course, it's a gray area,

1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:21.640
 but there is a threshold where your intent

1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:25.360
 with which you come to a meeting, to an interaction,

1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:29.160
 is one that is not one that's grounded

1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:32.280
 in like a respect for a common humanity,

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.560
 like a love for each other, is deeply messy.

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:36.680
 If somebody is doing really bad stuff,

1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:38.720
 I expect you to try to keep them

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.720
 from doing really bad stuff.

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.760
 But just keep in mind that when I was a younger man,

1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:49.480
 I saw an amazing anti pornography documentary,

1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.600
 and it was called Rate It X,

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:54.040
 and I don't know where it went,

1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:57.840
 but the conceit of it was we're going to get

1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:00.400
 some pornographers in front of a camera

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:02.040
 because they want to talk,

1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:03.520
 and we're going to ask them about what they do

1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:06.360
 for a living and why it's okay.

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:09.120
 No commentary.

1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:13.960
 Okay.

1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:16.080
 You could potentially,

1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:18.040
 if you really think Alex Jones is the worst,

1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:20.720
 and again, I'm not intimately familiar with him,

1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:25.640
 you could decide to just let him talk.

1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.800
 Just let him talk.

1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:33.920
 Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people.

1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:35.640
 I've spoken to Stefan Molyneux.

1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:38.000
 Stefan Molyneux makes many good points,

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.720
 makes many bad points,

1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:42.600
 and he makes many good points in bad ways,

1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:43.920
 and I worry about it,

1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:46.760
 and I don't feel that it's not my obligation

1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:48.480
 to make sure that Stefan Molyneux

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:50.160
 has a voice on the portal.

1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:55.200
 But I did stand up and say I didn't want him banned

1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:56.360
 from social media,

1:28:57.400 --> 1:28:59.120
 and I do think that a lot of the people

1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:00.800
 who are being banned from social media

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.000
 were worried that they're right

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.920
 rather than that they're wrong.

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:07.000
 I certainly don't really think that I'm worried

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.840
 in some sense that some of the really wrong people

1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:13.280
 are wrong, but if you look at, for example, Curtis Yarvin,

1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:15.200
 there's a tremendous amount of interest.

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:17.680
 Is Eric going to speak to Curtis Yarvin?

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:20.360
 Curtis Yarvin says many interesting things,

1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:23.920
 and he says many horrible, stupid things, very provocative.

1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:28.480
 And I haven't invited him onto the portal,

1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:32.160
 but I haven't said I will never invite him onto the portal.

1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:35.080
 We are all in a difficult position.

1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:35.920
 That's what I'm saying.

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:37.360
 You're making it kind of,

1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:39.920
 I think it's a much more difficult task

1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.120
 and burden to carry as people who have conversations

1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:46.200
 because Curtis Yarvin is a good example.

1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:50.160
 How much work do I have to put in reading Curtis's work

1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:51.480
 to really understand?

1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.480
 We should talk about the problem of Curtis Yarvin,

1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:55.640
 I think it's probably illustrative.

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.800
 There's this big question is why does somebody

1:29:57.800 --> 1:30:00.440
 who says such stupid ass things listen to

1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:01.920
 by so many people?

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.800
 Very smart people, people who are part of our daily lives

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:07.520
 discuss Curtis Yarvin in hushed tones.

1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:09.120
 Now, it's a good question.

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:12.560
 My belief is that Curtis Yarvin has made a number

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:15.840
 of very interesting, provocative points,

1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:18.840
 and they associate Curtis Yarvin as the person

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:20.520
 who has made these points,

1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:23.520
 and they treat the completely asinine stuff

1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:26.680
 that he says that's super dangerous as,

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:29.840
 well, that's Curtis, right?

1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:31.720
 Right, they give him the credit for,

1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:34.160
 he's a kind of like, sorry to use the term,

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:37.920
 first principles deep thinker about the way the world,

1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:40.280
 in some space about the world.

1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:43.160
 But as a result, we don't actually know

1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:45.840
 why Curtis Yarvin is knocking around

1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:50.840
 so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives.

1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:54.480
 See, you said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff,

1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:56.920
 and that's the sense I got from a few things I've read,

1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:00.000
 not just about, this is not just like Wikipedia stuff,

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.160
 is he's a little, like I've said before,

1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:05.760
 he seems to be careless.

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:09.100
 I don't think he's, no, no, no, it's like Jim Watson.

1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:12.360
 Jim Watson wants to say very provocative things

1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:14.600
 in order to prove that he's free.

1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:15.840
 It's not a question of careless.

1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:20.560
 He enjoys the freedom to say these things.

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:22.320
 And the key point is, is that there's,

1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:25.440
 I expect something more of Curtis.

1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:27.880
 I expect that if somebody is insightful

1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:30.180
 about all sorts of things up to that point,

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:33.280
 that they're going to have enough care.

1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:35.400
 Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.160
 that vaccines are not 100% safe.

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:41.000
 Most people who have an idea that anybody

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:44.720
 who's an anti vaxxer should be silenced are in a position

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:48.040
 where they probably don't say vaccines are 100% safe,

1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:50.320
 but you keep finding that statement over and over again,

1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:53.360
 like believe all women, vaccines are 100% safe,

1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:55.760
 climate science is settled science.

1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:57.500
 Whatever this Mont and Bailey is,

1:31:57.500 --> 1:32:02.500
 where you make extraordinarily vapid blanket claims,

1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:04.280
 and then you retreat into something,

1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:07.160
 well, defund the, we don't want no more police,

1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:11.520
 actually just means we want the police to not take

1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:12.860
 on mental health duties.

1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:17.640
 We've come up with an incredibly disingenuous society.

1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:21.120
 And what I'm claiming is, is that I might talk

1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:25.400
 to Curtis Yarvin, but I have really very little interest

1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:28.280
 to talk to a guy who seems to be kind of giddy

1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:31.480
 about who makes good slaves and who makes bad slaves.

1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:34.280
 It's like, why do I want to do that on the portal?

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:37.840
 One, first of all, because just as you said,

1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:39.680
 that's not Curtis's main thing.

1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:43.760
 He has a lot of ideas and what I've read of him,

1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:48.160
 which is not a huge amount, is he's very thoughtful

1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:50.500
 about the way this world works.

1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:54.620
 And on top of that, he's an important historical figure

1:32:54.620 --> 1:32:57.880
 in the birth and the development of the alt right,

1:32:57.880 --> 1:32:59.320
 or what would be called the alt right.

1:32:59.320 --> 1:33:00.440
 Or the new reactionary.

1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:01.800
 Yeah, and there's,

1:33:01.800 --> 1:33:05.520
 so he's just an important intellectual.

1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:07.400
 And so it makes sense to talk to him.

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:10.860
 The question is, how much work do you put in?

1:33:10.860 --> 1:33:12.760
 Well, this is the issue of fugu.

1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:16.460
 I'm not a chef that necessarily can serve that fugu.

1:33:18.420 --> 1:33:21.560
 So you have a puffer fish, you can eat the puffer fish.

1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:25.080
 You can get kind of a tingly sensation on your tongue

1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:27.120
 if you get a little bit of the poison organ.

1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:30.780
 But my point is, I don't know how to serve Curtis Yarvin

1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:34.280
 so that, in fact, I'm not worried about what happens.

1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:37.280
 And I believe that if somebody else was a student

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.360
 of the new reactionary movement,

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:41.400
 that person might be in a better position

1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:42.980
 to host Curtis Yarvin.

1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:44.800
 So somebody, that's a really good example,

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:49.240
 somebody I think you've spoken with that's an intermediary,

1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:50.840
 that's a powerful one, is Michael Malice.

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.700
 And he's spoken with Curtis Yarvin.

1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:55.040
 And Michael wrote a book about.

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:57.040
 By the way, Michael somewhat changed my mind

1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:58.640
 about Michael Malice.

1:33:58.640 --> 1:33:59.720
 I'm glad he did.

1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:02.680
 I think, I would call him a friend,

1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.680
 and I think he's underneath it all

1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:08.680
 a really kind human being.

1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.080
 And I think your skepticism about him was initially

1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:13.440
 from a surface level of, what did you call him,

1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:15.880
 hyenas, the trolls, and so on.

1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.520
 I'm not happy about his.

1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:23.180
 It's been so long since I've seen good trolls.

1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:24.020
 Yes.

1:34:24.020 --> 1:34:24.860
 So.

1:34:24.860 --> 1:34:28.840
 He needs a higher quality of trolling.

1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:30.320
 But he aspires to that.

1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.840
 I mean, disagree or not,

1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:38.100
 I really enjoy how much care he puts

1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:40.680
 into the work he does, like on North Korea

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:42.240
 and the study of the world,

1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:45.780
 and how much privately, but also in public,

1:34:45.780 --> 1:34:50.260
 love he has for people, especially those who are powerless.

1:34:50.260 --> 1:34:53.180
 Just a genuine admiration for them.

1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:57.280
 I think Curtis actually.

1:34:57.280 --> 1:34:58.120
 Does too.

1:34:58.120 --> 1:34:59.040
 I don't know.

1:34:59.040 --> 1:34:59.960
 I mean, you have to appreciate,

1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:02.400
 the first time I met Curtis, he introduced me,

1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:05.560
 he says, I'm the most right wing person you've ever met.

1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:06.640
 I was just like, well,

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:09.160
 this is a conversation that's already over.

1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:12.800
 It's theatrical in a way that's not conducted

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:14.680
 to actually having a real human connection.

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:18.120
 It turned me off because it was like,

1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:19.960
 you need to be the most right wing person.

1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:22.520
 And so it's like, I'm a troll, I'm a troll.

1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:24.340
 Okay, why are we doing this?

1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:25.960
 But what I'm trying to get at is different.

1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:29.160
 I'm trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend of yours.

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:31.560
 If you found out something terrible,

1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:32.680
 you should still be a friend.

1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:34.600
 You should still continue to be his friend.

1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:36.520
 And in Michael Malice's case,

1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.640
 it's very likely that we'll find out something terrible.

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:40.200
 Curtis is an acquaintance of mine

1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:42.640
 because he hangs around with some people that I know.

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:44.360
 I did not get it.

1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:47.400
 I've started to understand why the people in my life,

1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:51.000
 some of them are Curtis Yarvin fans.

1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:54.000
 Many of them disregard the stupid stuff.

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000
 But my feeling is that too much poison organ,

1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.400
 not enough fish.

1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:00.480
 I don't know how to serve that.

1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:01.320
 It's too intermingled.

1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:02.920
 I'm not your chef.

1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:04.760
 Speaking for defending your friends,

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.680
 staying with your friends,

1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:10.600
 and bringing the old band together again,

1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.320
 you coined the term IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.

1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:16.480
 I like it.

1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:19.200
 It represents a certain group of people

1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:22.000
 that are struggling with,

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.640
 that are almost like challenged the norms

1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:29.400
 of social and political discourse

1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.760
 from all different angles.

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:33.840
 What do you think is the state of the IDW?

1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:35.560
 What do you think is its future?

1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:39.040
 Is it still a useful?

1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:40.120
 Well, it never exists.

1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:41.360
 Is it a protocol?

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:44.040
 Is it a collection of people featured in an article?

1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:46.080
 What I learned very clearly

1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.040
 is that there's a tremendous desire in the internet age

1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:50.080
 to pin people down.

1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:50.920
 Well, what do you say?

1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:51.760
 Who's in it?

1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:53.240
 What are the criteria?

1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.520
 It's like, I understand.

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:57.280
 You wanna play the demarcation game

1:36:57.280 --> 1:36:59.800
 and you wanna make everything that is demarcated

1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:01.560
 instantly null and void.

1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:02.800
 No, thank you.

1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:06.160
 So I resisted saying who was in it.

1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:07.800
 I resisted saying what it was.

1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:10.320
 I resisted saying that Barry Weiss's article

1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:11.720
 was the definitive thing.

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.080
 They chose a ridiculous concept for the photographs

1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:18.360
 that we couldn't get out of.

1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:20.480
 I did not want those photographs taken.

1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:23.080
 They decided that the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer

1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.280
 needed to take them all at twilight.

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:27.480
 I don't know, some such thing.

1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:29.880
 I didn't even necessarily wanna do the article.

1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:32.280
 Barry convinced me that it was the right thing to do.

1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:33.600
 Undoubtedly Barry was right.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.040
 I was wrong.

1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:40.040
 But the key point is nothing can grow in this environment.

1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:43.240
 There's a reason we're not building.

1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:46.080
 It does not appear that we found a way

1:37:46.920 --> 1:37:49.480
 to grow anything organic and good and decent

1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.960
 that we need right now.

1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.920
 And that's kind of the key issue.

1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:53.760
 Who's the we?

1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:55.200
 Do you mean us as a society?

1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:57.600
 Those of us who wish to have a future

1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:59.160
 for our great grandchildren.

1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:02.520
 Let's take the subset of people who are worried

1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:04.600
 about things long after their demise.

1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:09.960
 But do you think it's useful to have a term like the IDW

1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:13.080
 to capture some set of people,

1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.680
 some set of ideas

1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.760
 or maybe principles that capture what I think the IDW,

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:23.960
 okay, you can say it's not supposed to mean,

1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:25.720
 it doesn't exist, it doesn't mean anything,

1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:29.200
 but to the public, to me, okay, I'll just speak to me,

1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:30.560
 it represented something.

1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:31.400
 Yeah.

1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:34.520
 It represented, I think I just said this to you,

1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:39.520
 in my first attempt to interview the great Eric Weinstein,

1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:42.040
 I said that, I spoke this about you,

1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:44.800
 but IDW in general is trying to point out the elephant

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:46.720
 in the room or that the emperor has no clothes.

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:49.440
 The set of people that do that in their own way.

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.160
 If there are multiple elephants in the room,

1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:54.560
 the point is that the IDW was more interested

1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:56.840
 in seeing the totality of elephants

1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:59.200
 and trying to figure out how do we move forward

1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.440
 as opposed to saying I can spot the other guy's elephant

1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:03.680
 in the room, but I can't see my own.

1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:05.560
 And in large measure,

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.920
 we didn't represent an institutional base.

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:12.440
 And therefore it wasn't maximally important

1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:13.880
 that we look at our own hypocrisy

1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:18.640
 because we weren't on the institutional spectrum.

1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:20.480
 This is where friendship comes into play

1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:21.520
 with the different figures

1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:24.320
 that are loosely associated with IDW

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:29.320
 is you were somehow responsible for the exact thing

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:35.240
 that you said, did you hear what, I don't know,

1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.400
 I forget, oh, what Sam Harris said about IDW.

1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:40.720
 Yeah.

1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:41.760
 That kind of thing is.

1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.600
 I chuckled.

1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:46.360
 Lovingly or chuckle like, oh.

1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:49.360
 I was angry at some people who had said things

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:51.240
 that caused Sam to say what Sam said

1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.840
 about turning his imaginary club membership into the IDW.

1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:58.160
 People said very silly things.

1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:01.760
 And I think that there is just this confusion

1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:06.120
 that integrity means calling out your friends

1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:08.360
 in front of the world.

1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:12.280
 And I've been pretty clear about this.

1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:13.880
 I try to choose my friends carefully.

1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:16.240
 And if you would like to recuse me

1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:18.720
 because I'm not a source of reliable information,

1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:20.520
 people that I know and love the most,

1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:23.920
 maybe that's reasonable for you.

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:25.680
 Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing

1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:27.400
 to throw a friend under the bus

1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:29.160
 at the first sign of trouble.

1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.600
 By all means, exit my feed.

1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.000
 You don't have to subscribe to me.

1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.960
 If that's your concept of integrity,

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:38.800
 you're barking up the wrong tree.

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:41.280
 What I will say is that I knew these people well enough

1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:42.960
 to know that they're all flawed.

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:46.800
 Thank you for the callback.

1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:51.800
 But the issue is that I love people who are flawed.

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:55.720
 And I love people who have to earn a living,

1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:57.040
 even if you call them a grifter.

1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.480
 And I love people who like the fact

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.520
 that Donald Trump didn't get us into new wars,

1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:05.600
 even if you call them alt right.

1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:09.640
 I love the fact that some people believe

1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:12.520
 in structural oppression and wanna fight it,

1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.600
 even if they're not woke,

1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:16.400
 because they don't believe that structural oppression

1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:17.440
 is hiding everywhere.

1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:21.760
 I care and love different people in different ways.

1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:24.400
 And I think that the overarching thing, Lex,

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:26.160
 that we're not getting at is that

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:28.640
 we were sold a bill of goods

1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:33.360
 that you can go through life like an ELISA program

1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:35.640
 with pre programmed responses.

1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:39.880
 Well, it's what about ism, it's both sides ism,

1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:44.040
 it's alt right, it's the loony left, it's campus madness.

1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:46.600
 It's like, okay, why don't you just empty

1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:49.360
 the entire goddamn magazine?

1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:56.160
 All of those pre recorded snips.

1:41:57.600 --> 1:41:59.440
 Now that you've done all of that,

1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:02.240
 now we can have a conversation.

1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:07.240
 Your son put it really well, which is we should,

1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:09.960
 in all things, resist labels.

1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.960
 But we can't deal without labels, we have to generalize.

1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.680
 But we also have to keep in mind

1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:19.560
 that just in the way in science,

1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:20.880
 you deal with an effective theory

1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:22.360
 that isn't a fundamental one.

1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:25.400
 In science, most of our theories,

1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:27.360
 we consider to be effective theories.

1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:32.040
 If I generalize about Europe, about women,

1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:37.040
 about Christians, those things have to be understood

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:42.400
 to mean something and not to have their definitions

1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:46.840
 extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all,

1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:51.240
 nor that they're so rigid that they're claims

1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:53.180
 that clearly won't bear scrutiny.

1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:56.560
 Lex, what do you really wanna talk about?

1:42:56.560 --> 1:42:58.480
 That's always my question to you.

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:02.120
 That always gets me, maybe you are the therapist.

1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:04.520
 But you and I could talk about anything.

1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:07.240
 People love, up until now at least,

1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:08.600
 people have loved listening

1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:10.680
 to the two of us in conversation.

1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:13.120
 And my feeling is is that we're not talking

1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:17.600
 about neural nets, and we're not talking

1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:20.360
 about geometric unity, and we're not talking

1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:23.600
 about where distributed computing might go.

1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:25.800
 And I don't think that we're really focused

1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:29.520
 on some of the most exciting things

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:30.960
 we could do to transform education.

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:34.520
 We're still caught in this world of other people

1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:36.040
 that we don't belong in.

1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:38.480
 I don't belong in the world as it's been created.

1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:39.820
 I'm trying to build a new world,

1:43:39.820 --> 1:43:44.120
 and I'm astounded that the people

1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:46.600
 with the independent means to help build that world

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.800
 are so demotivated that they don't wanna

1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:50.980
 build new structures.

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:54.360
 And the people who do wanna build new structures

1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.160
 seem to be wild eyed.

1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:58.080
 Wild eyed, what do you mean by wild eyed?

1:43:58.080 --> 1:43:59.120
 They're not, they're not.

1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.120
 I guarantee you that I will get some message

1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:03.340
 in my DMs that says, hey, Eric.

1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:06.520
 You know, I'm a third year chemistry student

1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:11.480
 at South Dakota State, and I've got a great idea.

1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:12.480
 I just need funding.

1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:13.320
 I wanna build.

1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:14.400
 They don't have the means.

1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:16.440
 So the people who have the means have become.

1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:19.000
 Or the sophistication, it's like you're looking

1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.280
 for somebody who's proven themselves a few times

1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:24.960
 to say, you know, I've got $4 billion behind me

1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:27.840
 that's soft circled.

1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:30.800
 I wanna figure out what a new university would be

1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:33.400
 and what it would take to protect academic freedom

1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:34.340
 and who we would hire

1:44:34.340 --> 1:44:36.400
 and what are the different characteristics

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:37.960
 because I can clearly see that everything

1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:40.020
 following the current model is falling apart.

1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.440
 Nobody in my understanding is saying that.

1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:47.600
 Nobody is saying let's take that

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:51.040
 which is functioning independently

1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:53.360
 and make it less vulnerable.

1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.920
 Let's boost those signals.

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:58.920
 And a critical component as money, you think?

1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:01.580
 It's not only that, but it's also a kind of

1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:04.040
 these people are mobbed up hands off.

1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:08.500
 Let's imagine for the moment that Sundar Pichai,

1:45:08.500 --> 1:45:10.520
 Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg

1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:17.760
 founded a university come social media entity.

1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:20.760
 And they said, the purpose of this is to make sure

1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:23.160
 that academic freedom will not perish from this earth

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.520
 because it's necessary to keep us from all going crazy.

1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:29.440
 And we are going to lock ourselves out.

1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:32.240
 We've come up with this governance system.

1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:35.760
 And the idea is that these people will be assigned

1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:38.200
 the difficult task of making sure that society

1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:40.360
 doesn't go crazy in any particular direction.

1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:43.080
 That we have a fact based, reality based,

1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:46.320
 feasibility based, understaffed,

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.360
 theory based understanding.

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:51.540
 We can try to figure out where our real opportunities are.

1:45:53.900 --> 1:45:56.960
 It feels like everybody with the ability

1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:58.360
 to do something like that,

1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:01.600
 and with the brains and experience and the resources,

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:05.400
 would rather sit in the current system

1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:08.440
 and hope to figure out where they can flee to

1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:10.200
 if the whole thing comes apart.

1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:12.500
 Well, yeah, and maybe to push back in a little bit,

1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:14.440
 I agree with you, but you know,

1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:17.560
 it feels like some people are trying that.

1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:21.400
 So for example, Google purchased DeepMind.

1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:23.600
 DeepMind is a company that kind of represents

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:25.360
 a lot of radical ideas.

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:27.800
 They've become acceptable, actually.

1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:30.120
 AGI, artificial general intelligence,

1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:35.120
 used to be really radical of a thing to talk about.

1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:38.160
 And DeepMind and OpenAI are two places

1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:39.800
 which has made it more acceptable.

1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:43.880
 I know you can now start to criticize,

1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:46.600
 well, they're really, now that it's become acceptable,

1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:48.000
 they're not taking the further step

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.220
 of being more and more radical.

1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:51.360
 But you know, that wasn't an attempt by Google

1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:56.360
 to say that let's try some wild stuff.

1:46:57.600 --> 1:46:59.340
 Sort of like Boston Dynamics.

1:46:59.340 --> 1:47:01.520
 Sort of like Boston Dynamics.

1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:04.040
 Boston Dynamics is a really good example

1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:09.040
 of trying radical ideas for perhaps no purpose whatsoever

1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:13.160
 except to try out their ideas.

1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:16.720
 Well, the idea is that innovation is like dessert.

1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.800
 You can have dessert after you solve the problem

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:22.440
 of the main course, and the main course

1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:24.840
 is a bunch of insoluble problems.

1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:27.560
 So the idea is we can get into innovation

1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:29.840
 once we perfect ourselves.

1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:32.440
 And you're saying that we need to make innovation

1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:33.480
 the main meal.

1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:37.000
 Well, I'm saying that there really is structural oppression.

1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:44.000
 I mean, if you train a deep learning system

1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:47.940
 on exclusively white faces, it's gonna get confused.

1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:51.440
 So let's not disagree that there are real issues

1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:52.280
 around this.

1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:55.480
 In fact, that's an issue of innovation and data.

1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.920
 Your data should be responsive.

1:47:57.920 --> 1:47:59.360
 On the other hand, there are things

1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.040
 we can't do anything about that are actually fundamental.

1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:08.760
 And those things may have to do with the fact

1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:13.440
 that some of us taste cilantro as soap,

1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:14.920
 and some of us don't.

1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:16.880
 Like there are differences between people,

1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:18.720
 and some of them are in the hardware,

1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:19.760
 some of them are in the firmware,

1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.520
 some of them are in the software that is the human mind.

1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:27.000
 And this completely simplistic idea

1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:32.000
 that every failure of an organization

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.360
 to promote each person

1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:37.160
 who has particular intersexual characteristics,

1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.320
 we cannot hold progress hostage to that.

1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:45.760
 And you've talked about, perhaps we'll save this

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:47.920
 for another time because it's such a fascinating conversation.

1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:51.520
 You talked about this with Glenn Beck,

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:53.600
 is the whole sort of stagnation of growth

1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:54.480
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:59.480
 Your idea is that in as much as the current situation

1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:01.720
 is a kind of Ponzi scheme,

1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:03.760
 the current situation in the United States

1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:06.840
 is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise

1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:10.120
 of constant unending innovation,

1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:15.120
 we need to fund the true innovators

1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:21.920
 and encourage them and empower them

1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:23.880
 and sort of culturally say that this is what

1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:27.400
 this country is about is the brilliant minds.

1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:31.320
 We're gonna kill each other if we don't grow.

1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:33.240
 Growth is like an immune system

1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:36.600
 and you always have pathogens present,

1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:37.800
 but if you don't have growth present,

1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:40.080
 you can't fight the pathogens in your society.

1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:43.600
 And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere.

1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:46.880
 So if we don't get growth into our system fairly quickly,

1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:49.640
 we are in really seriously bad shape.

1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:54.520
 So it's very important that if I had a horrible person

1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:56.440
 who was capable of building something

1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:59.000
 that would give us all a certain amount

1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.840
 of what I've called financial beta

1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:03.720
 to some new technology where we all benefit,

1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:05.320
 let's say quantum computing comes in

1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:07.320
 and everybody, the dry cleaner

1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:09.760
 has a quantum computing angle, right?

1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:10.680
 Yes. Okay.

1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:15.520
 That's necessary to keep this system that we built going.

1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:17.400
 We can try to redesign the system,

1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:19.240
 but our system expects growth

1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.120
 and we've started it for growth

1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:23.040
 and the madness that we're seeing

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:24.760
 is the failure of our immune system

1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:26.200
 to be able to handle the pathogens

1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:28.280
 that have always been present.

1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:30.440
 So people can say, well, this was always there.

1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:31.280
 Yes, it was.

1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:33.040
 What's changed was your immune system.

1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:37.960
 We have got to make sure that one,

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.960
 we understand why diversity

1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:41.640
 is potentially really important.

1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:45.240
 We have mined certain communities to death.

1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:47.440
 You and I are Ashkenazi Jews.

1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:49.560
 Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews

1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:51.000
 are good at technical stuff.

1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:54.600
 We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff.

1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:56.120
 The Indians have many people

1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.600
 who are good at technical stuff as the Japanese.

1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:02.960
 So I also believe that we have communities

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:05.520
 where if you think about the Pareto idea

1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:06.840
 of diminishing returns,

1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.840
 if you've never mined a community,

1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:11.360
 many of the people you're gonna get at the beginning

1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:13.840
 are gonna be amazing because that community,

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:16.600
 it's like, did you drill for more oil in Texas?

1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:19.080
 Texas is pretty thoroughly picked over.

1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:23.040
 Do you find someplace that's completely insane?

1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:24.840
 Maybe there's oil there, who knows?

1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:29.840
 And in particular, I would like to displace our reliance

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.200
 on our military competitors in Asia

1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.360
 in our scientific laboratories with women,

1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:38.000
 with African Americans, with Latinos,

1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.640
 people who are in different categories

1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:42.040
 than we have traditionally sourced.

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:44.160
 And I would like to get them the money

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.080
 that the market would normally give these fields

1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:52.560
 were we not using visas in place of payment, right?

1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:57.080
 Now, I have a crazy idea,

1:51:57.080 --> 1:51:59.800
 which is that I play, you and I both play music,

1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:02.400
 and I find the analytic work that I do

1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:04.200
 when I'm trying to figure out chord progressions

1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:06.600
 and symmetries and tritones, all these sorts of things

1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.080
 to be very similar to the work that I do

1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:09.400
 when I do physics or math.

1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:13.800
 I believe that one of the things that is true

1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:17.560
 is that the analytic contributions of African Americans

1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.120
 to music are probably fungible to science.

1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:23.640
 I don't know that that's true.

1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:26.400
 It's true I haven't done controlled research,

1:52:26.400 --> 1:52:28.320
 but I believe that it is very important

1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:31.080
 to let the People's Republic of China know

1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:34.600
 that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore,

1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:36.840
 and that we need to look to our own people.

1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:39.880
 And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit

1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:44.880
 for making sure that women, Black Americans, Latinos

1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:49.520
 are in a position to take over some of these things

1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:52.840
 because many of these communities have been underutilized.

1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:55.200
 Now, I don't know if that's an insane idea.

1:52:55.200 --> 1:52:58.520
 I want to hear somebody tell me why it's an insane idea,

1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:00.760
 but I believe that part of what we need to do

1:53:00.760 --> 1:53:03.920
 is we need to recognize that there are security issues,

1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:07.320
 there are geopolitical issues with the funding of science,

1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:10.520
 and that what we've done is we've starved our world

1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:12.360
 for innovation, and if we don't get back

1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.480
 to the business of innovation,

1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:15.640
 we should be doing diversity and inclusion

1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:18.040
 out of greed rather than guilt.

1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:20.360
 Now, part of the problem with this

1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:23.880
 is that a lot of the energy behind diversity and inclusion

1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:26.960
 is based on guilt and accusation.

1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:30.800
 And what I want is I want to kick ass,

1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:33.960
 and my hope is that diminishing returns favors

1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:37.640
 mining the communities that have not been traditionally mined

1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:41.960
 in order to extract output from those communities,

1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:43.440
 unless there's a flaw in that plan.

1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:45.200
 If there's a flaw, somebody needs to tell me.

1:53:45.200 --> 1:53:48.600
 If there isn't a flaw, we need to get greedy

1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:51.600
 about innovation rather than guilty about innovation.

1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:53.400
 That's really brilliantly put.

1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:55.320
 My biggest problem with what I see

1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:59.720
 is it exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity.

1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:02.200
 It's used, when it's grounded in guilt,

1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:05.480
 it's then used as a hammer to shame people

1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:06.880
 that don't care about diversity enough.

1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:09.520
 F that shit, okay?

1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:13.320
 So my point is I'm excited about the idea

1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:15.880
 of Jimi Hendrix doing quantum field theory.

1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:19.360
 I'm excited about the idea of Art Tatum

1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:24.360
 trying to figure out what the neural nets

1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:26.600
 figured out about protein folding.

1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:29.240
 I have some idea of the level of intellect

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.320
 of people who have not found their way into STEM subjects

1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:35.240
 in incredibly technically demanding areas.

1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:37.760
 And if there's a flaw in that theory,

1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:40.080
 I want somebody to present the flaw.

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:43.400
 But right now, my belief is that

1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:45.880
 these things are merit based.

1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:48.600
 And if you really believe in structural oppression,

1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:51.360
 you do not want an affirmative action program.

1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:53.640
 You wanna make sure that people have huge amounts

1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:56.680
 of resources to get themselves into position.

1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:58.160
 I wanna push out,

1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:01.000
 I just tried this on this Clubhouse application.

1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:04.560
 I wanna push out Klein bottles as a secret sign

1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:07.520
 inside of rap videos in hip hop, right?

1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:09.120
 I want people to have an idea

1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.480
 that there's an amazing world.

1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:12.960
 And I wanna get the people who,

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:16.640
 hopefully I'm trying to lure into science and engineering.

1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:18.200
 I want to get them paid.

1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:20.840
 I don't want them as the cheap substitutes

1:55:20.840 --> 1:55:25.440
 for the fleeing white males who've learned

1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:29.240
 that they can't make any money in science and engineering.

1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:34.240
 So the problem is that we need to take over the ship Lex.

1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:36.200
 And it doesn't need to be you and me

1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:38.880
 because quite honestly, I have no desire to administer.

1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:41.200
 I don't wanna be the chief executive officer of anything.

1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:44.480
 What I do want is I want the baby boomers

1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:48.960
 who've made this mess and can't see it to be gone.

1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:51.840
 They had almost all of our universities

1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:56.040
 and I want fresh blood, fresh resources.

1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:00.600
 I want academic freedom and I want greed for our country

1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:03.840
 and for the future to determine diversity inclusion

1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:05.120
 as opposed to shame and guilt,

1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:06.780
 which is destroying our fabric.

1:56:06.780 --> 1:56:11.700
 That's as good of a diversity statement as I've ever heard.

1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:17.580
 This is a U turn, but somebody commented on the tweet

1:56:17.580 --> 1:56:20.900
 you sent that as one of the top comments,

1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:24.180
 they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency.

1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:27.540
 So it's a U turn, but not really.

1:56:27.540 --> 1:56:29.960
 Since you're an economist, since you're deep,

1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:31.340
 not an economist.

1:56:31.340 --> 1:56:33.740
 I mean, I pretend to be an economist,

1:56:33.740 --> 1:56:36.980
 hoping that the economists will take issue

1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:39.280
 that I'm not an economist so that I can advance

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:41.940
 gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics,

1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:45.500
 which the economics profession has failed to acknowledge

1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:46.900
 was a major innovation

1:56:46.900 --> 1:56:49.700
 that happened approximately 25 years ago.

1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:51.560
 I don't think that economists understand

1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:53.740
 what a price index is that measures inflation,

1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:58.180
 nor do I think economists understand what a growth index

1:56:58.180 --> 1:57:03.180
 or a product, a quantity index is that measures GDP.

1:57:04.180 --> 1:57:07.700
 I think that they don't even understand the basics

1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:10.620
 of price and quantity index construction.

1:57:10.620 --> 1:57:15.100
 And therefore they can't possibly review

1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:17.460
 field theoretic economics.

1:57:17.460 --> 1:57:19.740
 They can't review gauge theoretic economics.

1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:21.840
 They're intellectually not in a position

1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:23.260
 to manage their own field.

1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:25.220
 You talked about that there's a stagnation

1:57:25.220 --> 1:57:26.660
 in growth currently.

1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:29.100
 I looked at, from my microeconomics,

1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:31.820
 macroeconomics in college perspective,

1:57:31.820 --> 1:57:36.300
 GDP doesn't seem to capture the productivity,

1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:40.980
 the full, the spectrum of what I think is

1:57:40.980 --> 1:57:43.900
 as a functioning successful society.

1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:46.700
 What do you think is broken about GDP?

1:57:46.700 --> 1:57:48.540
 What does it need to include?

1:57:49.540 --> 1:57:51.500
 These indices, like what?

1:57:51.500 --> 1:57:53.680
 Let me explain what they don't understand to begin with.

1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:54.520
 Sure.

1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:59.520
 Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output

1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:04.320
 are the same at the end of the year

1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:05.720
 as they are at the beginning.

1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:09.060
 And you ask what happened during that year?

1:58:09.060 --> 1:58:10.240
 Was there inflation?

1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:12.780
 They meandered over the course of the year,

1:58:12.780 --> 1:58:16.360
 but miraculously they all came back to exactly their values.

1:58:17.300 --> 1:58:20.740
 The amount produced at the end of the year

1:58:20.740 --> 1:58:24.000
 is the same as at the beginning in every single quantity.

1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.120
 Typically the claim would be that the price index

1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:30.180
 should be 1.0 and that the quantity index should be 1.0.

1:58:30.180 --> 1:58:31.380
 That's clearly wrong.

1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:34.240
 Why?

1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:37.900
 Well, it's much easier to see with,

1:58:37.900 --> 1:58:41.800
 it speaks to a fundamental confusion that economists have.

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.200
 They don't understand that the economy is curved

1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:45.140
 and not flat.

1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:50.720
 In a curved economy, everything should be path dependence,

1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:53.060
 but they view path dependence as a problem

1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:55.880
 because they are effectively the flat earth society

1:58:55.880 --> 1:58:57.640
 of market analysis.

1:58:57.640 --> 1:58:59.800
 They don't understand that what they've called,

1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:02.560
 and they've actually called it the cycling problem,

1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:04.960
 is exactly what they need to understand

1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:06.600
 to advance their field.

1:59:06.600 --> 1:59:09.440
 So I'll give you a very simple example, okay?

1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:13.440
 Let's imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund

1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:15.060
 and Ted and Alice in another.

1:59:15.060 --> 1:59:20.060
 In both cases, the females, that is, Alice and Carol,

1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:22.180
 are the chief investment officers,

1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:26.960
 and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers

1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:29.040
 in charge of trying to get money into the fund

1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:34.040
 and trying to get people not to, in fact,

1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:37.140
 remove their money from the funds, okay?

1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:43.640
 If you, in fact, had a hedge fund

1:59:43.640 --> 1:59:47.240
 with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,

1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:51.280
 and both hedge funds were invested in assets

1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:53.480
 whose prices came back to the same levels

1:59:53.480 --> 1:59:57.480
 and whose exposures were in the same quantities,

2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:02.880
 and you wanted to compensate these two hedge funds,

2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:06.200
 would you compensate them the same necessarily?

2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:11.200
 What if, for example, Carol was killing it

2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:12.760
 in terms of investments?

2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:16.000
 Every time she bought some sort of security,

2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.580
 the price of that security went up, okay?

2:00:20.580 --> 2:00:25.440
 But Bob was the worst marketing officer,

2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:26.680
 and as chief marketing officer,

2:00:26.680 --> 2:00:28.080
 there were tons of redemptions

2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:30.960
 because Bob was constantly drunk,

2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:33.800
 Bob was making off color comments.

2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:36.520
 Now, as a result, at the end of the year,

2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:38.560
 the fund hasn't grown in size

2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:40.800
 because even though Carol was crushing it

2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:43.000
 in terms of the investments,

2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:45.200
 Bob was screwing up everything

2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:47.520
 and the redemptions were legendary,

2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:48.660
 so people were making money

2:00:48.660 --> 2:00:50.560
 and still pulling it out of the fund.

2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:56.440
 In the other fund, Alice can't seem to buy a base hit

2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:00.720
 every time she gets into a security, the thing plummets,

2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:05.520
 but Ted's amazing marketing skills allowed the fund

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.240
 to get all sorts of new subscriptions

2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:09.760
 and halted the redemptions as people hoped

2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:13.000
 that the fund would get its act together, okay.

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:19.960
 Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated,

2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:30.080
 and quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted

2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:34.240
 are compensated, so even though both funds

2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:38.560
 had closed loops that come back to the original states,

2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:41.640
 what happened during the period that they were active

2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:44.240
 tells you how people are supposed to be compensated.

2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000
 Now, we know that whatever the increase

2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:53.640
 in the price index is, is compensated by a decrease

2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:56.040
 in the quantity index or conversely,

2:01:56.900 --> 2:01:58.080
 because prices and quantities

2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:00.140
 return to their original values.

2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:02.040
 You could have another fund where nothing much happened,

2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:04.920
 there were no redemptions, no subscriptions,

2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.080
 the fund remained in cash the whole time.

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:10.920
 So in that third fund, you know,

2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:13.940
 let's call that Tristan and Isolde, right?

2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:17.080
 That fund should have no bonuses paid

2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:18.120
 because nobody did anything,

2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:20.400
 but nobody should be fired either.

2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:24.360
 Now, the fact that the economists don't even understand

2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.520
 that this is what their price and quantity indices

2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:29.600
 were intended to do, that they don't understand

2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:31.500
 that you can actually give what would be called

2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:35.160
 ordinal agents the freedom to change their preferences

2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:38.640
 and still have something defined as a

2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:41.160
 CONUS cost of living adjustment.

2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:43.940
 They don't even understand the mathematics of their field.

2:02:43.940 --> 2:02:46.000
 So the indices need to be able to capture

2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.080
 some kind of dynamics that...

2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:51.200
 We have had indices that capture these dynamics

2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:54.240
 due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925.

2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:57.720
 But the economists have not even understood

2:02:57.720 --> 2:02:59.800
 what de Vizier's index truly represent.

2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:04.020
 What do you miss with such crude indices then?

2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:06.440
 Well, you miss the fact that you're supposed

2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:09.240
 to have a field theoretic subject.

2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.120
 The representative consumer should actually

2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.500
 be a probability distribution on the space

2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:16.160
 of all possible consumers weighted by the probability

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:19.660
 of getting any particular pull from the distribution.

2:03:19.660 --> 2:03:23.120
 We should not have a single gauge of inflation.

2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.200
 What is that in 1973 dollars?

2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:27.120
 Any more than you should be able to say

2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:31.160
 it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday.

2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:34.960
 So when we get to the cryptocurrency,

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:37.040
 what I'm going to say is that

2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:39.940
 because we didn't found economic theory

2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:41.880
 on the proper marginal revolution,

2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:44.000
 because we missed the major opportunity,

2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.240
 which is that the differential calculus of markets

2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:48.320
 is gauge theory.

2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:53.320
 It's not ordinary differential calculus.

2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:55.560
 We found that out in finance

2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:58.220
 that it was stochastic differential calculus.

2:03:58.220 --> 2:04:00.720
 We have the wrong version of the differential calculus

2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:03.760
 underneath all of modern economic theory.

2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:06.720
 And part of what I've been pushing for in cryptocurrencies

2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:09.000
 is the idea that we should be understanding

2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:11.500
 that gold is a gauge theory,

2:04:11.500 --> 2:04:13.700
 just as modern economic theory

2:04:13.700 --> 2:04:15.600
 is supposed to be a gauge theory.

2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:18.960
 And that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies

2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:21.160
 and more importantly distributed computing

2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.660
 from the problem of this unwanted global aspect,

2:04:25.660 --> 2:04:26.800
 which is the blockchain.

2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:29.520
 The thing that is most celebrated in some sense

2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:31.600
 about Bitcoin is in fact the reason

2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:33.400
 that I'm least enthusiastic about it.

2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:36.480
 I'm hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did.

2:04:38.020 --> 2:04:40.820
 But it's an intermediate step towards trying to figure out

2:04:40.820 --> 2:04:43.680
 what should digital gold actually be?

2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:48.680
 If physical gold is a collection of up quarks

2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:52.560
 and down quarks in the form of protons and neutrons

2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:55.180
 held together, the quarks by gluons

2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:57.780
 with electrons orbiting and held together by photons

2:04:57.780 --> 2:05:01.020
 with the occasional weak interaction beta decay,

2:05:01.020 --> 2:05:02.720
 all of those are gauge theories.

2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:06.240
 So gold is actually coming from gauge theory

2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:08.280
 and markets are coming from gauge theory.

2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:12.420
 And the opportunity to do locally enforced conservation laws,

2:05:12.420 --> 2:05:15.680
 which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is,

2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:19.780
 should theoretically be founded on a different principle

2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:21.400
 that is not the blockchain.

2:05:21.400 --> 2:05:23.880
 It should be a gauge theoretic concept

2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:27.560
 in which effectively the tokens are excitations

2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:29.640
 on a network of computer nodes.

2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:34.480
 And the fact that, let's imagine that this is some token.

2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:39.560
 By moving it from my custodianship to your custodianship,

2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:43.040
 effectively I pushed that glass as a gauge theory

2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:45.280
 towards your region of the table.

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.600
 We should be recognizing the gauge theory

2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:51.380
 is the correct differential calculus for the 21st century.

2:05:51.380 --> 2:05:53.280
 In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century.

2:05:53.280 --> 2:05:57.880
 You're saying it captures these individual dynamics,

2:05:57.880 --> 2:05:58.720
 much richer.

2:05:58.720 --> 2:06:01.840
 Why should my giving you a token have to be,

2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:05.120
 why should we alert the global community

2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:06.800
 in this token that that occurred?

2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:08.000
 You can talk about side chains,

2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.040
 you can talk about any means of doing this,

2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:11.520
 but effectively we have a problem,

2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:13.880
 which is if I think about this differently,

2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:16.960
 I have a glass that is extant,

2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:18.640
 you have a glass that is abstent.

2:06:19.740 --> 2:06:23.080
 We're supposed to call the constructor method

2:06:23.080 --> 2:06:24.720
 on your glass at the same moment

2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:26.840
 we call the destructor method on my glass

2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:29.280
 in order to have a conservation principle.

2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:32.080
 It would be far more efficient to do this

2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:34.720
 with the one system that is known

2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:37.120
 never to throw an exception, which is nature.

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:39.280
 And nature has chosen gauge theory and geometry

2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:41.460
 for her underlying language.

2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:45.360
 We now know due to work of Pia Malani at Harvard

2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:49.720
 in economics in the mid 1990s, which I was her coauthor on,

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:54.720
 but I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea.

2:06:57.480 --> 2:06:59.720
 We know that modern economic theory

2:06:59.720 --> 2:07:01.880
 is a naturally occurring gauge theory.

2:07:01.880 --> 2:07:04.320
 And the failure of that community to acknowledge

2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:06.940
 that that work occurred and that it was put down

2:07:06.940 --> 2:07:09.160
 for reasons that make no analytic sense

2:07:10.720 --> 2:07:13.480
 is important in particular due to the relatively

2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:15.800
 new innovation of distributed computing

2:07:15.800 --> 2:07:17.560
 and Satoshi's brainchild.

2:07:17.560 --> 2:07:20.040
 So you're thinking we need to have the mathematics

2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:23.200
 that captures, that enforces cryptocurrency

2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:25.760
 as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized one

2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:30.240
 where the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized.

2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:35.000
 The abundance economy much discussed in Silicon Valley

2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:38.960
 or what's left of it is actually a huge threat

2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:41.200
 to the planet because what it really is

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:43.240
 is that it is what Marc Andreessen

2:07:43.240 --> 2:07:45.520
 has called software eating the world.

2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:47.520
 And what that means is that you're gonna push

2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:49.360
 things from being private goods and services

2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:51.440
 into public goods and services and public goods

2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:55.840
 and services cannot have price and value tied together.

2:07:55.840 --> 2:07:59.060
 Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value

2:07:59.060 --> 2:08:01.860
 to the world that they cannot command a price

2:08:01.860 --> 2:08:03.740
 and they will not be able to capture the value

2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:05.920
 that they have created or a significant enough

2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:07.080
 fraction of it.

2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:09.820
 The abundance economy is a disaster.

2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:13.220
 It will lead to a reduction in human freedom.

2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:16.720
 The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced

2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:20.440
 or semi locally enforced conservation laws

2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:22.760
 where the idea is just as gold is hard,

2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:24.960
 why is gold hard to create or destroy?

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:26.720
 It's because it's created not only in stars

2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:28.680
 but in violent events involving stars

2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:30.260
 like supernova collisions.

2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:35.440
 When gold is created and we transact,

2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:38.080
 we're using conservation laws.

2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:41.280
 The physics determines the custodianship,

2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:43.920
 whatever it is that I don't have, you now have

2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:47.400
 and conversely, in such a situation,

2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:49.760
 we should be looking for the abstraction

2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:52.100
 that most closely matches the physical world

2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:53.480
 because the physical world is known

2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:55.240
 not to throw an exception.

2:08:55.240 --> 2:08:57.200
 The blockchain is a vulnerability.

2:08:57.200 --> 2:09:00.720
 The idea that the 51% problem isn't solved,

2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:03.600
 that you could have crazy race conditions,

2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:06.880
 all of these things, we know that they're solved

2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:08.880
 inside of gauge theory somehow.

2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:12.200
 So the important thing is to recognize

2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:15.140
 that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever

2:09:15.140 --> 2:09:18.840
 in the history of economic theory took place already

2:09:18.840 --> 2:09:22.040
 and was essentially instantly buried

2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:24.120
 and I will stand by those comments.

2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:28.320
 Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you.

2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:29.420
 Are you Satoshi?

2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:30.260
 No.

2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:33.000
 No, no, no, I don't have that kind of ability.

2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:34.360
 I really don't.

2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:35.260
 I do other things.

2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:38.520
 Speaking of Satoshi and gauge theory,

2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:41.520
 you've mentioned to Brian Keating

2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:47.360
 that you may be releasing a geometric unity paper this year

2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:51.800
 or some other form of additional material on the topic.

2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:54.120
 What is your thinking around this?

2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:56.320
 What's the process you're going through now

2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:58.760
 in preparing this?

2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:02.040
 I used April 1st to try to start a tradition

2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:04.860
 which I hope to use to liberate mankind.

2:10:04.860 --> 2:10:09.860
 The tradition is that at least one day a year,

2:10:10.180 --> 2:10:13.220
 you should be able to say heretical things

2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:16.900
 and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off or Mark Zuckerberg.

2:10:16.900 --> 2:10:18.580
 Your provost shouldn't call you up and say,

2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:19.640
 what did you say?

2:10:20.660 --> 2:10:23.660
 We need at some level to have a jubilee

2:10:23.660 --> 2:10:26.540
 from centralized control.

2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:28.780
 And so my hope is that,

2:10:28.780 --> 2:10:30.940
 you know what a tradition is in America?

2:10:30.940 --> 2:10:35.860
 Something a baby boomer did twice.

2:10:35.860 --> 2:10:37.020
 Impeachment.

2:10:37.020 --> 2:10:39.660
 That's very funny.

2:10:41.220 --> 2:10:45.700
 Anyway, so I'm not a baby boomer, but as an exer,

2:10:46.620 --> 2:10:48.820
 I've thought about whether or not April 1st

2:10:48.820 --> 2:10:52.740
 would be a good date on which to release a printed version

2:10:52.740 --> 2:10:55.180
 of what I already said in lecture form.

2:10:55.180 --> 2:10:56.980
 Because I think it's hysterically funny

2:10:56.980 --> 2:10:59.260
 that the physics community claims

2:10:59.260 --> 2:11:02.500
 that it can't decode a lecture.

2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:04.580
 It must be paper.

2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:05.700
 And you know what?

2:11:05.700 --> 2:11:08.540
 There will be a steady stream of new complaints

2:11:08.540 --> 2:11:10.820
 up until the point that they fit it into a narrative

2:11:10.820 --> 2:11:11.660
 that they like.

2:11:13.700 --> 2:11:16.220
 Yeah, I'm thinking about April 1st

2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:19.340
 as a date in which to release a document

2:11:19.340 --> 2:11:21.100
 and it won't be perfectly complete,

2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:22.960
 but it'll be very complete.

2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:26.560
 And then they'll try to say, it's wrong.

2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:27.580
 Or you already did it.

2:11:27.580 --> 2:11:29.420
 Or no, that was dumb,

2:11:29.420 --> 2:11:31.660
 but what we just did on top of it is brilliant.

2:11:31.660 --> 2:11:34.500
 Or it doesn't match experiment.

2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:35.340
 Or who knows what.

2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:37.500
 They'll go through all of their usual nonsense.

2:11:38.780 --> 2:11:40.300
 It's time to go.

2:11:40.300 --> 2:11:43.240
 Is there still puzzles in your own mind

2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:44.460
 that need to be figured out

2:11:44.460 --> 2:11:46.120
 for you to try to put it on paper?

2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:48.220
 I mean, those are different mediums, right?

2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:50.220
 It was a great question.

2:11:50.220 --> 2:11:51.820
 I did not count on something

2:11:51.820 --> 2:11:53.380
 that turns out to be important.

2:11:54.700 --> 2:11:57.100
 When you work on your own outside of the system

2:11:57.100 --> 2:11:58.820
 for a long time,

2:11:58.820 --> 2:12:00.780
 you probably don't think you're gonna be doing this

2:12:00.780 --> 2:12:03.020
 as a 55 year old man.

2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:06.020
 And I have been so long outside

2:12:06.020 --> 2:12:07.380
 of math and physics departments,

2:12:07.380 --> 2:12:09.020
 and I've been occupied with so many other things

2:12:09.020 --> 2:12:10.540
 as you can see,

2:12:10.540 --> 2:12:14.260
 that the old idea that I had was

2:12:14.260 --> 2:12:16.520
 if I always did it in little pieces,

2:12:17.380 --> 2:12:21.460
 then I was always safe because it wouldn't be stealable.

2:12:21.460 --> 2:12:26.100
 And so now those pieces never got assembled completely.

2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:29.060
 In essence, I have all the pieces

2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.540
 and I can fit them together.

2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:35.760
 But there's probably a small amount of glue code.

2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:37.260
 Like there are a few algebraic things

2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:38.340
 I've forgotten how to do.

2:12:38.340 --> 2:12:39.940
 I may or may not figure them out

2:12:39.940 --> 2:12:41.940
 between now and April 1st.

2:12:41.940 --> 2:12:43.500
 But it's pretty complete.

2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:46.400
 But that's the puzzle you're kind of struggling

2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:47.940
 to now figure out,

2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:50.820
 to get it all in the same, the glue together.

2:12:50.820 --> 2:12:52.460
 I can't tell you whether the theory

2:12:52.460 --> 2:12:54.220
 is correct or incorrect.

2:12:54.220 --> 2:12:56.400
 But for example, there's what's the exact form

2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:57.900
 of the supersymmetry algebra,

2:12:57.900 --> 2:13:00.780
 or what's the rule for passing a minus sign

2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:02.900
 through a particular operator.

2:13:02.900 --> 2:13:05.820
 And all of that stuff got a lot more difficult

2:13:05.820 --> 2:13:09.220
 because I didn't do it every,

2:13:09.220 --> 2:13:14.220
 look, it's a little bit like if you're a violinist

2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:17.700
 and you don't touch your violin regularly for 15 years,

2:13:17.700 --> 2:13:19.940
 you come back to it and you pretty much know the pieces,

2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:21.800
 sort of, but there's lots of stuff that's missing,

2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:24.040
 your tone is off and that kind of stuff.

2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:27.020
 I would say I'll get the ship to the harbor

2:13:27.020 --> 2:13:30.420
 and it'll require a tugboat probably to get it in.

2:13:30.420 --> 2:13:31.740
 And if the tugboat doesn't show up,

2:13:31.740 --> 2:13:34.540
 then I'll pilot the thing right into the dock myself.

2:13:34.540 --> 2:13:35.780
 But it's not a big deal.

2:13:35.780 --> 2:13:38.480
 I think that it is essentially complete.

2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:41.300
 Psychologically, just as a human being,

2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:45.500
 this is, I remember perhaps by accident,

2:13:45.500 --> 2:13:48.660
 but maybe there's no accidents in the universe.

2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:51.380
 I was tuned in, I don't remember where,

2:13:51.380 --> 2:13:56.380
 on April 1st to you, oh, I think on your Discord,

2:13:58.020 --> 2:14:00.980
 kind of thinking about, thinking through this release.

2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:02.180
 I mean, it wasn't like,

2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:04.860
 it wasn't obvious that you were going to do it,

2:14:04.860 --> 2:14:05.860
 you were thinking through it.

2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:08.500
 And I remember there was intellectual,

2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:11.420
 personal, psychological struggle with this, right?

2:14:11.420 --> 2:14:13.260
 Well, because I thought it was dangerous.

2:14:13.260 --> 2:14:14.980
 If this turns out to be right,

2:14:14.980 --> 2:14:16.500
 I don't know what it unlocks.

2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:21.500
 If it's wrong, I think I understand where we are.

2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:28.200
 If it's wrong, it'll be the first fool's gold

2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.240
 that really looks like a theory of everything.

2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:35.600
 It'll be the iron pyrites of physics.

2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:38.520
 And we haven't even had fool's gold in my opinion yet.

2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:40.440
 Got it.

2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:45.360
 So what is your intuition why this looks right to you?

2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:48.320
 Like why it feels like it would be,

2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:49.160
 if wrong, the first fool's gold.

2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:51.120
 I can say it very simply.

2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:53.280
 It's way smarter than I am.

2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:55.440
 Can you break that apart a little more?

2:14:55.440 --> 2:14:56.880
 Every time you poke at it,

2:14:56.880 --> 2:14:58.720
 it's giving you intuitions that follow

2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:00.400
 with the currently known physics.

2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:02.400
 Let's put it in computer science terms.

2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:03.240
 Yes, please.

2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:05.640
 Okay, there's a concept of technical debt

2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:07.980
 that computer scientists struggle with.

2:15:07.980 --> 2:15:09.180
 As you commit crimes,

2:15:09.180 --> 2:15:11.680
 you have to pay those crimes back at a later date.

2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:15.440
 In general, most of the problem with physical theories

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:20.360
 is that as you try to do something that matches reality,

2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:23.120
 you usually have to go into some structure

2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:25.140
 that gets you farther away.

2:15:25.140 --> 2:15:26.680
 And your hope is, is that you're gonna be able

2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:28.240
 to pay back the technical debt.

2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:32.000
 And in general, these wind up as check hiding schemes

2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:34.560
 or like you're funding a startup

2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:37.000
 and there are too many pivots, right?

2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.600
 So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover,

2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:44.000
 things that have gone wrong.

2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:48.400
 My belief is, is that this thing

2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:53.040
 represents something like a summit to me.

2:15:53.040 --> 2:15:57.860
 And I'm very proud of having found a route up this summit.

2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:01.500
 But the root is what's due to me.

2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:04.260
 The summit can't possibly be due to me.

2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:09.680
 You know, like Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay

2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:13.180
 did not create Mount Everest.

2:16:13.180 --> 2:16:14.460
 They know that they didn't create that.

2:16:14.460 --> 2:16:18.780
 They figured out a way up.

2:16:18.780 --> 2:16:20.900
 You gotta tell me what Mount Everest

2:16:20.900 --> 2:16:22.860
 is in this metaphor relative

2:16:22.860 --> 2:16:24.620
 and also connected to the technical debt.

2:16:24.620 --> 2:16:28.100
 So technical debt is a negative thing that it's kind of,

2:16:28.100 --> 2:16:30.500
 you will eventually have to pay it.

2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:32.660
 Are you saying in the,

2:16:32.660 --> 2:16:35.500
 in the ascent that you're seeing now in the theory

2:16:35.500 --> 2:16:37.620
 is you do not have much technical debt.

2:16:37.620 --> 2:16:38.460
 Well, that's right.

2:16:38.460 --> 2:16:43.460
 That what happens is, is that early on what I would say is,

2:16:43.460 --> 2:16:47.300
 I believe now that the physics community

2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:51.940
 has said many things incorrectly

2:16:51.940 --> 2:16:54.600
 about the current state of the universe.

2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:57.820
 They're not wildly off, which is why,

2:16:57.820 --> 2:16:59.340
 like for example, the claim is that

2:16:59.340 --> 2:17:01.460
 there are three generations of matter.

2:17:01.460 --> 2:17:03.520
 I do not believe that there are three generations of matter.

2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:05.340
 I believe that there are two generations of matter

2:17:05.340 --> 2:17:08.920
 and there's a third collection

2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:13.100
 that looks like a generation of matter as the first two,

2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:14.260
 only at low energy.

2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:18.400
 Okay, well, that's not a frequent claim.

2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:19.820
 People imagine that there are three

2:17:19.820 --> 2:17:21.540
 or more generations of matter.

2:17:21.540 --> 2:17:23.020
 I would claim that that's false.

2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:25.100
 People claim that the matter is chiral.

2:17:25.100 --> 2:17:27.220
 That is, it knows it's left from its right.

2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:31.100
 I would claim that the chirality is not fundamental,

2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:32.120
 but it is emergent.

2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:36.160
 But we could keep going at all these sorts of things.

2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:38.280
 People think that space time

2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:41.220
 is the fundamental geometrical construct.

2:17:41.220 --> 2:17:42.060
 I do not agree.

2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:45.520
 I think it's something that I've termed the observers.

2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:48.560
 All of these different things

2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:53.560
 represent a series of overinterpretations of the world

2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:56.720
 that preclude progress.

2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:01.080
 So you gave, I think you gave some credit

2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:03.800
 to string theory as, string theory,

2:18:03.800 --> 2:18:06.840
 I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly,

2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:11.600
 as like getting close to the fool's gold.

2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:16.080
 Well, I said that Garrett Lisi, phenomenologically,

2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:18.080
 gets a lot of things right.

2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:20.600
 He gets, he's got a reason for chirality,

2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:23.360
 a reason for uniqueness using E8.

2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:25.920
 In fact, E8 uses something called vial fermions,

2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:26.840
 which are chiral.

2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:30.880
 He has a way of getting geometry

2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:35.880
 to get Riemann's geometry underneath general relativity

2:18:36.200 --> 2:18:38.160
 to play with Erisman's geometry,

2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:39.560
 which is underneath the standard model,

2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:41.360
 using something called Cartan connections

2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:42.720
 that are out of favor.

2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:46.000
 He's figured out something involving super connections

2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:47.480
 to make sure that the fermion,

2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:49.980
 the matter in the system isn't quantized

2:18:49.980 --> 2:18:51.520
 the same way as the bosons were,

2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:53.920
 which is a problem in his old theory.

2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:56.440
 He's got something about three generations for triality.

2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.600
 He's got a lot of phenomenological hits.

2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:01.320
 I don't think Garrett's theory works.

2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:02.960
 It also has a very simple Lagrangian.

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:05.680
 He's basically using the Yang Mills norm squared,

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:08.120
 the same thing you would use as a cost function

2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:11.880
 if you were doing neural nets, okay?

2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:16.480
 The string theorists have a different selling point,

2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:18.120
 which is that they may have gotten

2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:20.280
 a renormalizable theory of gravity

2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:22.640
 if quantum gravity was what we were meant to do.

2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:24.480
 And they've done some stuff with black holes

2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:28.320
 that they can get some solutions correct.

2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:29.920
 And then they have lots of agreements

2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:33.040
 with where they show mathematical truths

2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:34.920
 that mathematicians didn't even know.

2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:39.000
 I'm very underwhelmed by string theory

2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.200
 based on how many people have worked on it

2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:43.480
 and how little is supporting the claims

2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:45.760
 to it being a theory of everything.

2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:50.360
 But those are the two that I take quite seriously.

2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:53.320
 I don't yet take Wolfram's quite seriously

2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:57.280
 because if he really finds one of these cellular automata

2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:00.040
 that are really distinct and generative,

2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:01.160
 it'll be amazing.

2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:02.920
 But he's looking for such a thing.

2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.000
 I don't think he's found anything.

2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:07.840
 Tegmark, I view as a philosopher

2:20:07.840 --> 2:20:10.800
 who is somehow taking credit for Platonism,

2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:13.720
 which I don't see any reason for fighting with Max

2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:16.400
 because I like Max, but if it ever comes time,

2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:18.760
 I'm putting a post it note that I'm not positive

2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:21.320
 the mathematical universe hypothesis

2:20:21.320 --> 2:20:22.680
 is really anything new.

2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:28.400
 And in general, loop quantum gravity really,

2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:29.880
 I think grew out of some hopes

2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:32.600
 that the general relativistic community had

2:20:32.600 --> 2:20:34.240
 that they would be able to do particle theory.

2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:36.080
 And I don't think that they've shown

2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:37.880
 any particle theoretic realism.

2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:42.200
 So essentially, here's what I really think, Lex.

2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:46.880
 I think we didn't understand how big the difference

2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:49.440
 between an effective theory and a theory of everything

2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.040
 is conceptually.

2:20:51.040 --> 2:20:54.080
 Maybe it's not mathematically that different,

2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:56.400
 but conceptually trying to figure out

2:20:56.400 --> 2:20:58.360
 what a theory of every, how does the universe,

2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:01.280
 and I've compared it to Escher's drawing hands.

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:04.720
 How do two hands draw themselves into existence?

2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:08.720
 That's the puzzle that I think has just been wanting.

2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:11.840
 And I'll be honest, I'm really surprised

2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:16.840
 that the theoretical physics community didn't even get up

2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:21.600
 on their high horse and say,

2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:25.200
 this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable,

2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:28.480
 because clearly I always say I'm not a physicist.

2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:32.320
 So I'm an amateur with a heart as big as all outdoors.

2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:35.960
 So in your journey of releasing this,

2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:39.960
 and I'm sure further maybe it will be

2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:42.160
 another American tradition on April 1st

2:21:42.160 --> 2:21:43.760
 that will continue for years to come.

2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:44.600
 I hope so.

2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:53.840
 There's sort of crumbs along the way

2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:58.680
 that I'm hoping to collect in my naive view of things

2:21:58.680 --> 2:22:03.680
 of the beauty that, in your geometric view of the universe.

2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:08.680
 So one question I'd like to ask is

2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:15.640
 if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful,

2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:18.040
 something important about geometric unity

2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:21.480
 in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty

2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:25.360
 from the outsider's perspective, what would that thing be?

2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:27.760
 Interesting question.

2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:29.960
 Perhaps we can both have a journey

2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:35.120
 towards April 1st.

2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:36.120
 Take a look at that.

2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:41.880
 Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose,

2:22:41.880 --> 2:22:44.680
 not Melrose, Montana in Santa Monica.

2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:48.760
 Now you'll notice that all of those disks

2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:51.480
 rotate independently.

2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:52.320
 Yes.

2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:59.360
 If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous,

2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:01.200
 but not uniform everywhere,

2:23:01.200 --> 2:23:04.800
 what you're doing is a so called gauge transformation

2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:09.560
 on the torus seen as a U1 bundle over a U1 space time.

2:23:09.560 --> 2:23:12.880
 So the concept of space time here

2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:15.960
 in a very simplified case isn't four dimensional,

2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:18.520
 but it's one dimensional, it's just a circle.

2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:21.720
 And there's a circle above every point in the circle

2:23:21.720 --> 2:23:23.560
 represented by those little disks.

2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:28.560
 So imagine if you will, that we took a rubber band

2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.680
 and placed it around here and decided

2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:36.800
 that that was a function from the circle

2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.800
 into the circle that is representing a Y axis

2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:44.240
 that's wrapped around itself.

2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:46.120
 Well, you would have an idea of what it means

2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:47.880
 for a function to be constant,

2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:50.240
 if it just went all around the outside.

2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:53.840
 But what happens if I turn this a little bit?

2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:55.600
 Then the function would be mostly constant.

2:23:55.600 --> 2:23:58.480
 We'd have a little place where it dipped and it went back.

2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:03.440
 It turns out that you can transform that function

2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:06.760
 and transform the derivative that says that function

2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:09.960
 is equal to zero when I take its derivative

2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:11.400
 at the same time.

2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:14.040
 That's what a gauge transformation is.

2:24:14.040 --> 2:24:19.040
 Amazing to me that we don't have a simple video,

2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:22.960
 visualizing things that I've already had built

2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:26.280
 and that I can clearly demonstrate.

2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:28.480
 When you do that Taurus,

2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:31.800
 who's the code of the Taurus is itself generating.

2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:32.640
 The Taurus.

2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:33.480
 The spinning Taurus.

2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:34.320
 Yeah.

2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:36.720
 This is a U1 principle bundle.

2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:39.080
 And the world needs to know what a gauge theory is,

2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:41.920
 not by analogy, not with Lawrence Krauss saying,

2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:42.880
 it's like a checkerboard.

2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:44.520
 If you change some of the colors this way,

2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:49.520
 not saying that it's a local symmetry involving,

2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:51.800
 it's none of those things.

2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:53.840
 It's a theory of differential calculus

2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:56.800
 where the functions and the derivatives

2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.160
 are both subject to a particular kind of change

2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:03.200
 so that if a function was constant under one derivative,

2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:07.120
 then the new function is constant under the new derivative

2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:09.280
 transformed in the same fashion.

2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:11.080
 And would you put that under the category

2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:12.880
 of just gauge transformations?

2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:15.120
 Yes, that would be gauge transformations

2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:17.080
 applied to sections and connections

2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:19.520
 where connections are the derivatives in the theory.

2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.200
 This is easily explained.

2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:26.680
 It is pathological that the community of people

2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:29.000
 who understand what I'm saying have never bothered

2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.600
 to do this in a clear fashion for the general public.

2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:34.720
 You and I could visualize this overnight.

2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:37.000
 This is not hard.

2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:41.200
 The public needs to know in some sense

2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:43.880
 that let's say quantum electrodynamics,

2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:45.600
 the theory of photons and electrons,

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:48.080
 more or less electrons are functions

2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:50.560
 and photons are derivatives.

2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:53.640
 Now there's some, you can object in some ways,

2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:55.720
 but basically a gauge theory is the way

2:25:55.720 --> 2:26:00.120
 in which you can translate a shift

2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:02.320
 in the definition of the functions

2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:04.440
 and the shift of the definition of the derivatives

2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:08.880
 so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed.

2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:10.600
 So you have to do both at the same time.

2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:12.120
 Now you and I can visualize that.

2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:15.280
 So if what you wanted to do rather than going directly

2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:18.760
 to geometric unity is that I could sit down with you

2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:20.640
 and I could say here are the various components

2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:24.520
 of geometric unity and if the public needs a visualization

2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:27.800
 in order to play along, we've got a little over two months

2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:29.880
 and I'd be happy to work with you.

2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:32.480
 I love that as a challenge and I'll take it on

2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:33.760
 and I hope we do make it happen.

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:38.280
 And David Goggins, if Lex doesn't do some super macho thing

2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:42.240
 because he's gotta work to get some of this stuff done,

2:26:42.240 --> 2:26:45.200
 you'll understand he'll be available to you after April.

2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:47.720
 Thank you for the escape clause.

2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:49.320
 I really needed that escape clause.

2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:50.160
 I'm glad that's on record.

2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:53.000
 I'm worried 48 miles in 48 hours.

2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.440
 By the way, I just wanna say how much I admire

2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:00.240
 your willingness to keep this kind of hardcore attitude.

2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:04.120
 I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews have it

2:27:04.120 --> 2:27:08.320
 in spades, but it's harder to do in a society that's sloppy

2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:11.080
 and that's weak and that's lazy.

2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:14.440
 And the fact that you bring so much heart to saying,

2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:16.400
 I'm gonna bring this to jujitsu,

2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:18.920
 I'm gonna bring this to guitar, I'm gonna bring this to AI,

2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:21.240
 I'm gonna bring this to podcasting.

2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:22.680
 It comes through loud and clear.

2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:25.080
 I just find it completely and utterly inspiring

2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:28.800
 that you keep this kind of hardcore aspect at the same time

2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:31.000
 that you're the guy who's extolling the virtue of love

2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.280
 in a modern society and doing it at scale.

2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:34.120
 Thank you.

2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:34.960
 That means a lot.

2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:36.040
 I don't know why I'm doing it,

2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:37.840
 but I'm just following my heart on it

2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:40.080
 and just going with the gut.

2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:42.280
 It seems to make sense somehow.

2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:45.840
 I personally think we better get tougher

2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:47.920
 or we're gonna get in a world of pain.

2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:51.560
 And I do think that when it comes time to lead,

2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:53.600
 it's great to have people who you know

2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:54.960
 don't crack under pressure.

2:27:55.960 --> 2:27:59.160
 Do you mind if we talk about love

2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:01.280
 and what it takes to be a father for a bit?

2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:02.120
 Sure.

2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:03.920
 Do you mind if Zev joins us?

2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:04.800
 I'd be an honor.

2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:11.560
 So Eric, I've talked to your son Zev,

2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:14.080
 who's an incredible human being,

2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:19.080
 but let me ask you,

2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:21.080
 this might be difficult

2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:22.880
 because you're both sitting together.

2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:27.920
 What advice do you have for him

2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:31.080
 as he makes his way in this world,

2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:35.280
 especially given that, as we mentioned before on Joe Rogan,

2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:38.560
 you're flawed in that just like all humans, you're mortal.

2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:44.640
 Well, at some level, I guess one of my issues

2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:47.280
 is that I've got to stop giving quite so much advice.

2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:50.520
 Early on, I was very worried

2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.760
 that I could see Zev's abilities

2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:55.320
 and I could see his challenges

2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:57.880
 and I saw them in terms of myself.

2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:01.200
 So a certain amount of Zev rhymes with

2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:02.720
 whatever I went through as a kid.

2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:07.040
 And I don't wanna doom him to the same outcomes

2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:08.960
 that sufficed for me.

2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:11.840
 I think that he's got a much better head on his shoulders

2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:14.800
 at age 15, he's much better adjusted.

2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:19.240
 And in part, it's important for me to recognize

2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:22.640
 that because I think I did a reasonably decent job early on,

2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:26.400
 I don't need to get this part right.

2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:31.400
 And I'm looking at Zev's trajectory and saying,

2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:36.040
 you're gonna need to be incredibly

2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:38.920
 and even pathologically self confident.

2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:41.080
 The antidote for that is gonna be something

2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:42.400
 you're gonna need to carry on board,

2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:43.920
 which is radical humility.

2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:46.640
 And you're gonna have to have those

2:29:46.640 --> 2:29:49.080
 in a dialectical tension, which is never resolved,

2:29:49.080 --> 2:29:51.000
 which is a huge burden.

2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.480
 You are going to have to forgive people

2:29:53.480 --> 2:29:55.520
 who do not appreciate your gifts

2:29:55.520 --> 2:29:57.560
 because your gifts are clearly evident.

2:29:57.560 --> 2:29:59.880
 And many people will have to pretend not to see them

2:29:59.880 --> 2:30:02.520
 because if they see your gifts,

2:30:02.520 --> 2:30:04.560
 then they're gonna have to question their entire approach

2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:08.840
 to education or employment or critical thinking.

2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:12.720
 And what my hope is, is that you can just forgive those

2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:14.760
 who don't see them and who complicate

2:30:14.760 --> 2:30:16.280
 and frustrate your life and realize

2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:18.400
 that you're gonna have to take care of them too.

2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:20.480
 Zev, let me ask you the more challenging question

2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:22.360
 because the guy's sitting right here.

2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:25.000
 What advice do you have for your dad?

2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:26.560
 Since after talking to you,

2:30:26.560 --> 2:30:30.680
 I realize you're the more brilliant

2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:35.140
 aside from the better looking member of the family.

2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:41.160
 It's a bit of an odd question.

2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:43.840
 Sorry.

2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:44.680
 You can say anything you want.

2:30:44.680 --> 2:30:46.000
 This is the last time we're gonna be seeing left.

2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:49.800
 It's gonna be an awkward drive home.

2:30:49.800 --> 2:30:54.800
 I think sort of a new perspective I've taken on parenting

2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:01.560
 is that it is a task for which no human

2:31:01.560 --> 2:31:04.640
 is really supposed to be prepared.

2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:08.160
 You know, there are in Jewish tradition, for example,

2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:12.960
 there are myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud

2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:17.960
 that compare the role of a parent to the role of a God,

2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:18.920
 right?

2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:21.560
 That no human is prepared to play God

2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:23.840
 and create and guide a life,

2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:27.640
 but somehow we're forced into it as people.

2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:33.560
 And I think sometimes it's hard for children to understand

2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:35.840
 that however their parents are failing

2:31:38.260 --> 2:31:39.100
 sort of has to be.

2:31:39.100 --> 2:31:40.560
 It's a theme here.

2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:43.960
 Is something for which we must budget

2:31:43.960 --> 2:31:46.560
 because our parents play a role in our lives

2:31:46.560 --> 2:31:49.640
 of which they're not worthy

2:31:49.640 --> 2:31:52.720
 and they devote themselves to regardless

2:31:52.720 --> 2:31:55.940
 because that becomes who they are in a certain sense.

2:31:55.940 --> 2:32:00.940
 So I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human

2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:12.000
 because I think too often it's easy

2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.720
 to have godly expectations of people

2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:18.020
 who are far from such a role.

2:32:18.020 --> 2:32:20.600
 And I think I'm really happy

2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:23.760
 that you've been as open as you have with me

2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:28.640
 about the fact that, you know, you really,

2:32:28.640 --> 2:32:31.120
 you don't pretend to be a God in my life.

2:32:31.120 --> 2:32:36.120
 You are a guide who allows me to see myself

2:32:38.600 --> 2:32:41.160
 and that's been very important considering the fact

2:32:41.160 --> 2:32:46.160
 that by your self teaching paradigm I will have to,

2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:50.800
 I will have to guide myself and being able to see it

2:32:50.800 --> 2:32:53.900
 and see myself accurately has been one of the greatest gifts

2:32:53.900 --> 2:32:55.640
 that you've given me.

2:32:55.640 --> 2:32:57.760
 So I'm very appreciative.

2:32:57.760 --> 2:33:02.760
 And I want you to know that I don't buy into the role

2:33:02.760 --> 2:33:09.760
 that you're supposed to sort of fake your way through

2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:19.520
 in my life but I am unbelievably happy

2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:25.680
 with a more realistic connection

2:33:25.680 --> 2:33:29.080
 that we've been able to build in lieu of it, so.

2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:31.160
 I think it's been easier on you actually

2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:34.000
 as you come to realize what I don't know,

2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.160
 what I can't do and that there's been a period of time,

2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:38.880
 I guess, that's fascinating to me

2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:41.960
 where you're sort of surprised

2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:45.120
 that I don't know the answer to a certain thing

2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:46.100
 as well as you do.

2:33:46.100 --> 2:33:50.120
 And that I remember going through this

2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.360
 with a particular mathematician who I held,

2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:55.440
 I still hold in awe, named David Kajdan.

2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:58.320
 And, you know, he famously said to,

2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:00.120
 and weirdly our family knew his family

2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:01.160
 in the Soviet Union.

2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:05.440
 But he said, you know, Eric,

2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:07.480
 I always appreciate you coming to my office

2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:10.440
 because I always find what you have to say interesting

2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:11.800
 but you have to realize that in the areas

2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:14.000
 that you're talking about, you are no longer the student,

2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.120
 you are actually my teacher.

2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:18.840
 And I wasn't prepared to hear that.

2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.400
 And there are many ways in which,

2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:22.840
 as I was just saying with the Mozart,

2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:26.500
 I am learning at an incredible rate from you.

2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:28.920
 I used to learn from you

2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:30.600
 because I didn't understand what was possible.

2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:33.840
 You were very much, I mean, this is the weird thing.

2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:35.400
 There used to be this thing called Harvey,

2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:36.400
 the invisible rabbit.

2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:39.000
 This guy had a rabbit that was like six feet tall

2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.680
 that only he could see maybe was talking.

2:34:41.680 --> 2:34:43.600
 And that was like you at age four.

2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:47.280
 You were saying batshit crazy things

2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:48.920
 that were all totally sensible

2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:50.760
 and nobody else could put them together.

2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:55.340
 And so what's wonderful is that the world hasn't caught on,

2:34:55.340 --> 2:34:58.560
 but enormous numbers of people are starting to.

2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:03.560
 And I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit

2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:08.380
 and that outside the box intellectual commitment

2:35:08.380 --> 2:35:13.200
 serves you well as the world starts to appreciate

2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:16.040
 that I think you're a very trustworthy voice.

2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:17.360
 You don't get everything right,

2:35:17.360 --> 2:35:20.160
 but the idea that we have somebody at your age

2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:21.640
 who's embedded in your generation

2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:23.840
 who can tell us something about what's happening

2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:25.000
 is really valuable to me.

2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:28.320
 And I do hope that you'll consider boosting that voice

2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.900
 more than just at the dinner table.

2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:36.480
 I apologize for saying this four letter word,

2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:39.760
 but do you love Zev?

2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.240
 Was really worried it was gonna be another four letter word.

2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:46.320
 There's so many to choose from.

2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:49.120
 It doesn't even rise to the level of the question.

2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:53.800
 I mean, I just, there are a tiny number of people

2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:56.560
 with whom you share so much life

2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:01.340
 that you can't even think of yourself in their absence.

2:36:01.340 --> 2:36:04.540
 And I don't know if Zev would find that,

2:36:04.540 --> 2:36:08.780
 but it's, you can have a kid

2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:11.780
 and never make this level of connection.

2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:14.300
 I think even right down to the fact

2:36:14.300 --> 2:36:18.980
 that when Zev chooses boogie woogie piano

2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:22.380
 for his own set of reasons,

2:36:22.380 --> 2:36:24.020
 why I would choose boogie woogie piano

2:36:24.020 --> 2:36:28.620
 if I could play in any style, it's a question

2:36:28.620 --> 2:36:30.820
 about a decrease in loneliness.

2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:34.180
 You know, like my grandfather played the mandolin

2:36:34.180 --> 2:36:35.820
 and I had to learn some mandolin

2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:38.540
 because otherwise that instrument would go silent.

2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:42.620
 You don't expect that you get this much of a chance

2:36:42.620 --> 2:36:45.660
 to leave this much of yourself in another person

2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:50.580
 who is choosing it and recreating it

2:36:50.580 --> 2:36:54.060
 rather than it being directly instilled.

2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:59.820
 And my proudest achievement is in a certain sense

2:36:59.820 --> 2:37:04.820
 having not taught him and having shared this much.

2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:09.780
 So, you know, it's not even love, it's like well beyond.

2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:14.780
 So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world.

2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:19.780
 I think I speak for, I would argue,

2:37:20.020 --> 2:37:22.860
 probably millions of people that you, Eric,

2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:24.940
 because this is a conversation with you,

2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:29.940
 have made for many people, for me, a less lonely world.

2:37:30.220 --> 2:37:35.220
 And I can't wait to see how you develop as an intellect,

2:37:35.740 --> 2:37:40.740
 but also I'm so heartworn by the optimism

2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:43.420
 and the hopefulness that was in you

2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:45.940
 that I hope develops further.

2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:50.940
 And lastly, I'm deeply thankful that you, Eric are my friend

2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:57.420
 and would give me, would honor me with this watch.

2:37:57.540 --> 2:38:00.100
 It means more than words can say.

2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:01.980
