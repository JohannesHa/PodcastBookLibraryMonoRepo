00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
 The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky.

00:03.800 --> 00:06.760
 He's truly one of the great minds of our time

00:06.760 --> 00:08.400
 and is one of the most cited scholars

00:08.400 --> 00:10.760
 in the history of our civilization.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.400
 He has spent over 60 years at MIT

00:13.400 --> 00:16.320
 and recently also joined the University of Arizona,

00:16.320 --> 00:18.640
 where we met for this conversation.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.760
 But it was at MIT about four and a half years ago

00:21.760 --> 00:23.440
 when I first met Noam.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.760
 My first few days there,

00:24.760 --> 00:27.400
 I remember getting into an elevator at Stata Center,

00:27.400 --> 00:29.480
 pressing the button for whatever floor,

00:29.480 --> 00:33.560
 looking up and realizing it was just me and Noam Chomsky

00:33.560 --> 00:35.480
 riding the elevator,

00:35.480 --> 00:38.400
 just me and one of the seminal figures of linguistics,

00:38.400 --> 00:40.000
 cognitive science, philosophy,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.920
 and political thought in the past century, if not ever.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.320
 I tell that silly story because I think life is made up

00:47.320 --> 00:50.740
 of funny little defining moments that you never forget

00:50.740 --> 00:54.880
 for reasons that may be too poetic to try and explain.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.140
 That was one of mine.

00:56.140 --> 00:59.940
 Noam has been an inspiration to me and millions of others.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.500
 It was truly an honor for me

01:01.500 --> 01:03.580
 to sit down with him in Arizona.

01:03.580 --> 01:06.500
 I traveled there just for this conversation.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.140
 And in a rare, heartbreaking moment,

01:09.140 --> 01:11.740
 after everything was set up and tested,

01:11.740 --> 01:13.500
 the camera was moved and accidentally,

01:13.500 --> 01:16.500
 the recording button was pressed, stopping the recording.

01:17.540 --> 01:21.140
 So I have good audio of both of us, but no video of Noam.

01:21.140 --> 01:25.340
 Just the video of me and my sleep deprived but excited face

01:25.340 --> 01:29.620
 that I get to keep as a reminder of my failures.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.500
 Most people just listen to this audio version

01:31.500 --> 01:34.860
 for the podcast as opposed to watching it on YouTube.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.140
 But still, it's heartbreaking for me.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.900
 I hope you understand and still enjoy this conversation

01:40.900 --> 01:42.220
 as much as I did.

01:42.220 --> 01:44.460
 The depth of intellect that Noam showed

01:44.460 --> 01:47.460
 and his willingness to truly listen to me,

01:47.460 --> 01:50.300
 a silly looking Russian in a suit.

01:50.300 --> 01:55.300
 It was humbling and something I'm deeply grateful for.

01:55.580 --> 01:59.660
 As some of you know, this podcast is a side project for me,

01:59.660 --> 02:03.580
 where my main journey and dream is to build AI systems

02:03.580 --> 02:05.480
 that do some good for the world.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.820
 This latter effort takes up most of my time,

02:07.820 --> 02:10.540
 but for the moment has been mostly private.

02:10.540 --> 02:12.820
 But the former, the podcast,

02:12.820 --> 02:15.380
 is something I put my heart and soul into.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.600
 And I hope you feel that, even when I screw things up.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.120
 I recently started doing ads

02:21.120 --> 02:22.840
 at the end of the introduction.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.640
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

02:25.640 --> 02:27.400
 and never any ads in the middle

02:27.400 --> 02:29.720
 that break the flow of the conversation.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.160
 I hope that works for you

02:31.160 --> 02:33.960
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.200
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.800
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

02:39.800 --> 02:41.840
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

02:41.840 --> 02:43.240
 support it on Patreon,

02:43.240 --> 02:45.400
 or simply connect with me on Twitter,

02:45.400 --> 02:49.440
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.720
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:51.720 --> 02:54.240
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.800
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:56.800 --> 02:58.760
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

02:58.760 --> 03:01.320
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.160
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.120
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,

03:07.120 --> 03:09.200
 no matter what the stock price is.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.960
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

03:11.960 --> 03:15.560
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.680
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

03:17.680 --> 03:20.920
 to support one of my favorite organizations called The First,

03:20.920 --> 03:24.360
 best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.720
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

03:27.720 --> 03:29.640
 in over 110 countries

03:29.640 --> 03:31.840
 and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

03:31.840 --> 03:33.840
 which means the donated money

03:33.840 --> 03:36.560
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.680
 When you get Cash App from the App Store,

03:38.680 --> 03:42.800
 Google Play and use code LexPodcast,

03:42.800 --> 03:47.120
 you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

03:47.120 --> 03:49.800
 which again is an organization that I've personally seen

03:49.800 --> 03:54.520
 inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.940
 And now here's my conversation with Noam Chomsky.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.160
 I apologize for the absurd philosophical question,

04:04.160 --> 04:07.120
 but if an alien species were to visit Earth,

04:07.120 --> 04:10.920
 do you think we would be able to find a common language

04:10.920 --> 04:13.680
 or protocol of communication with them?

04:13.680 --> 04:18.320
 There are arguments to the effect that we could.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.440
 In fact, one of them was Marv Minsky's.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.760
 Back about 20 or 30 years ago,

04:24.760 --> 04:29.760
 he performed a brief experiment with a student of his,

04:30.040 --> 04:33.760
 Dan Bobrow, they essentially ran

04:33.760 --> 04:36.720
 the simplest possible touring machines,

04:36.720 --> 04:39.560
 just free to see what would happen.

04:39.560 --> 04:42.560
 And most of them crashed,

04:42.560 --> 04:47.560
 either got into an infinite loop or stopped.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.000
 The few that persisted,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.900
 essentially gave something like arithmetic.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.800
 And his conclusion from that was that

04:59.980 --> 05:04.980
 if some alien species developed higher intelligence,

05:04.980 --> 05:07.440
 they would at least have arithmetic,

05:07.440 --> 05:12.440
 they would at least have what the simplest computer would do.

05:12.940 --> 05:16.040
 And in fact, he didn't know that at the time,

05:16.040 --> 05:20.760
 but the core principles of natural language

05:20.760 --> 05:25.220
 are based on operations which yield something

05:25.220 --> 05:29.360
 like arithmetic in the limiting case, in the minimal case.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.040
 So it's conceivable that a mode of communication

05:34.040 --> 05:38.560
 could be established based on the core properties

05:38.560 --> 05:41.460
 of human language and the core properties of arithmetic,

05:41.460 --> 05:43.620
 which maybe are universally shared.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.680
 So it's conceivable.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.800
 What is the structure of that language,

05:50.800 --> 05:55.160
 of language as an internal system inside our mind

05:55.160 --> 05:58.920
 versus an external system as it's expressed?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.880
 It's not an alternative,

06:00.880 --> 06:02.960
 it's two different concepts of language.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.780
 Different.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.280
 It's a simple fact that there's something about you,

06:07.280 --> 06:11.640
 a trait of yours, part of the organism, you,

06:11.640 --> 06:14.600
 that determines that you're talking English

06:14.600 --> 06:16.980
 and not Tagalog, let's say.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.640
 So there is an inner system.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.960
 It determines the sound and meaning

06:22.960 --> 06:27.120
 of the infinite number of expressions of your language.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.720
 It's localized.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.760
 It's not on your foot, obviously, it's in your brain.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.240
 If you look more closely, it's in specific configurations

06:35.240 --> 06:36.480
 of your brain.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.600
 And that's essentially like the internal structure

06:40.600 --> 06:44.960
 of your laptop, whatever programs it has are in there.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.840
 Now, one of the things you can do with language,

06:47.840 --> 06:50.040
 it's a marginal thing, in fact,

06:50.040 --> 06:54.800
 is use it to externalize what's in your head.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.660
 Actually, most of your use of language

06:56.660 --> 06:58.820
 is thought, internal thought.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.920
 But you can do what you and I are now doing.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.640
 We can externalize it.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.640
 Well, the set of things that we're externalizing

07:05.640 --> 07:07.680
 are an external system.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.160
 They're noises in the atmosphere.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.920
 And you can call that language

07:12.920 --> 07:14.360
 in some other sense of the word.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.800
 But it's not a set of alternatives.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.980
 These are just different concepts.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.200
 So how deep do the roots of language go in our brain?

07:23.500 --> 07:26.780
 Our mind, is it yet another feature like vision,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.480
 or is it something more fundamental

07:28.480 --> 07:31.520
 from which everything else springs in the human mind?

07:31.520 --> 07:33.720
 Well, in a way, it's like vision.

07:33.720 --> 07:38.580
 There's something about our genetic endowment

07:38.580 --> 07:41.600
 that determines that we have a mammalian

07:41.600 --> 07:44.720
 rather than an insect visual system.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.440
 And there's something in our genetic endowment

07:47.440 --> 07:51.440
 that determines that we have a human language faculty.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.200
 No other organism has anything remotely similar.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.280
 So in that sense, it's internal.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.720
 Now there is a long tradition,

07:59.720 --> 08:03.600
 which I think is valid going back centuries

08:03.600 --> 08:05.500
 to the early scientific revolution,

08:05.500 --> 08:09.340
 at least that holds that language

08:09.340 --> 08:13.620
 is the sort of the core of human cognitive nature.

08:13.620 --> 08:18.080
 It's the source, it's the mode for constructing thoughts

08:18.080 --> 08:19.640
 and expressing them.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.760
 That is what forms thought.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.200
 And it's got fundamental creative capacities.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.320
 It's free, independent, unbounded, and so on.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.860
 And undoubtedly, I think the basis

08:34.860 --> 08:38.480
 for our creative capacities

08:38.480 --> 08:43.480
 and the other remarkable human capacities

08:43.840 --> 08:47.500
 that lead to the unique achievements

08:47.500 --> 08:51.300
 and not so great achievements of the species.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.620
 The capacity to think and reason,

08:53.620 --> 08:56.240
 do you think that's deeply linked with language?

08:56.240 --> 08:58.200
 Do you think the way we,

08:58.200 --> 09:01.560
 the internal language system is essentially the mechanism

09:01.560 --> 09:04.120
 by which we also reason internally?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.920
 It is undoubtedly the mechanism by which we reason.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.320
 There may also be other fact,

09:09.320 --> 09:13.220
 there are undoubtedly other faculties involved in reasoning.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.520
 We have a kind of scientific faculty,

09:17.520 --> 09:18.840
 nobody knows what it is,

09:18.840 --> 09:20.920
 but whatever it is that enables us

09:20.920 --> 09:25.440
 to pursue certain lines of endeavor and inquiry

09:25.440 --> 09:29.760
 and to decide what makes sense and doesn't make sense

09:29.760 --> 09:32.200
 and to achieve a certain degree

09:32.200 --> 09:33.640
 of understanding of the world,

09:33.640 --> 09:36.480
 that uses language, but goes beyond it.

09:37.440 --> 09:42.000
 Just as using our capacity for arithmetic

09:42.000 --> 09:44.880
 is not the same as having the capacity.

09:44.880 --> 09:49.360
 The idea of capacity, our biology, evolution,

09:49.360 --> 09:52.520
 you've talked about it defining essentially our capacity,

09:52.520 --> 09:55.200
 our limit and our scope.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.840
 Can you try to define what limit and scope are?

09:58.840 --> 10:01.160
 And the bigger question,

10:01.160 --> 10:04.800
 do you think it's possible to find the limit

10:04.800 --> 10:06.220
 of human cognition?

10:07.560 --> 10:09.880
 Well, that's an interesting question.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.080
 It's commonly believed, most scientists believe

10:13.080 --> 10:17.640
 that human intelligence can answer any question

10:17.640 --> 10:19.340
 in principle.

10:19.340 --> 10:21.800
 I think that's a very strange belief.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.280
 If we're biological organisms,

10:24.280 --> 10:26.160
 which are not angels,

10:26.160 --> 10:31.160
 then our capacities ought to have scope

10:31.800 --> 10:34.920
 and limits which are interrelated.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.620
 Can you define those two terms?

10:36.620 --> 10:40.740
 Well, let's take a concrete example.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.040
 Your genetic endowment determines

10:44.040 --> 10:46.840
 that you can have a male in visual system,

10:46.840 --> 10:49.260
 arms and legs and so on,

10:49.260 --> 10:53.440
 but it therefore become a rich, complex organism.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.240
 But if you look at that same genetic endowment,

10:56.240 --> 10:59.980
 it prevents you from developing in other directions.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.720
 There's no kind of experience

11:01.720 --> 11:05.760
 which would yield the embryo

11:05.760 --> 11:08.760
 to develop an insect visual system

11:08.760 --> 11:11.960
 or to develop wings instead of arms.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.960
 So the very endowment that confers richness and complexity

11:16.960 --> 11:21.960
 also sets bounds on what can be attained.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.440
 Now, I assume that our cognitive capacities

11:27.440 --> 11:29.640
 are part of the organic world.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.260
 Therefore, they should have the same properties.

11:32.260 --> 11:35.700
 If they had no built in capacity

11:35.700 --> 11:39.180
 to develop a rich and complex structure,

11:39.180 --> 11:41.920
 we would understand nothing.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.080
 Just as if your genetic endowment

11:46.080 --> 11:50.320
 did not compel you to develop arms and legs,

11:50.320 --> 11:54.000
 you would just be some kind of random amoeboid creature

11:54.000 --> 11:56.080
 with no structure at all.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.240
 So I think it's plausible to assume that there are limits

12:00.240 --> 12:03.680
 and I think we even have some evidence as to what they are.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.660
 So for example, there's a classic moment

12:06.660 --> 12:10.660
 in the history of science at the time of Newton.

12:11.620 --> 12:15.360
 There was a from Galileo to Newton modern science

12:15.360 --> 12:17.920
 developed on a fundamental assumption

12:17.920 --> 12:20.120
 which Newton also accepted.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.100
 Namely that the world is an entire universe

12:24.100 --> 12:26.340
 is a mechanical object.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.260
 And by mechanical, they meant something like

12:29.260 --> 12:31.640
 the kinds of artifacts that were being developed

12:31.640 --> 12:34.260
 by skilled artisans all over Europe,

12:34.260 --> 12:37.120
 the gears, levers and so on.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.320
 And their belief was well,

12:39.320 --> 12:42.000
 the world is just a more complex variant of this.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
 Newton, to his astonishment and distress,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.960
 proved that there are no machines,

12:50.960 --> 12:53.440
 that there's interaction without contact.

12:54.300 --> 12:57.640
 His contemporaries like Leibniz and Huygens

12:57.640 --> 13:02.560
 just dismissed this as returning to the mysticism

13:02.560 --> 13:03.960
 of the neo scholastics.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.840
 And Newton agreed.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.240
 He said it is totally absurd.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.120
 No person of any scientific intelligence

13:11.120 --> 13:13.760
 could ever accept this for a moment.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.280
 In fact, he spent the rest of his life

13:15.280 --> 13:17.720
 trying to get around it somehow,

13:17.720 --> 13:20.320
 as did many other scientists.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.040
 That was the very criterion of intelligibility

13:24.040 --> 13:26.520
 for say Galileo or Newton.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.260
 Theory did not produce an intelligible world

13:31.260 --> 13:34.040
 unless you could duplicate it in a machine.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.520
 He showed you can't, there are no machines, any.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.240
 Finally, after a long struggle, took a long time,

13:41.240 --> 13:45.240
 scientists just accepted this as common sense.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.400
 But that's a significant moment.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.360
 That means they abandoned the search

13:49.360 --> 13:51.780
 for an intelligible world.

13:51.780 --> 13:54.800
 And the great philosophers of the time

13:54.800 --> 13:57.000
 understood that very well.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
 So for example, David Hume in his encomium to Newton

14:02.320 --> 14:05.560
 wrote that who was the greatest thinker ever and so on.

14:05.560 --> 14:10.520
 He said that he unveiled many of the secrets of nature,

14:10.520 --> 14:13.320
 but by showing the imperfections

14:13.320 --> 14:17.520
 of the mechanical philosophy, mechanical science,

14:17.520 --> 14:21.240
 he left us with, he showed that there are mysteries

14:21.240 --> 14:23.560
 which ever will remain.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.760
 And science just changed its goals.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.720
 It abandoned the mysteries.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.480
 It can't solve it, we'll put it aside.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.740
 We only look for intelligible theories.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.680
 Newton's theories were intelligible.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.080
 It's just what they described wasn't.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.780
 Well, Locke said the same thing.

14:42.780 --> 14:44.800
 I think they're basically right.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.000
 And if so, that showed something

14:47.000 --> 14:49.680
 about the limits of human cognition.

14:49.680 --> 14:54.680
 We cannot attain the goal of understanding the world,

14:55.680 --> 14:58.400
 of finding an intelligible world.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.540
 This mechanical philosophy Galileo to Newton,

15:02.540 --> 15:05.260
 there's a good case that can be made

15:05.260 --> 15:10.260
 that that's our instinctive conception of how things work.

15:10.980 --> 15:15.980
 So if say infants are tested with things that,

15:16.220 --> 15:18.660
 if this moves and then this moves,

15:18.660 --> 15:22.060
 they kind of invent something that must be invisible

15:22.060 --> 15:24.940
 that's in between them that's making them move and so on.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.500
 Yeah, we like physical contact.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.940
 Something about our brain seeks.

15:28.940 --> 15:31.540
 Makes us want a world like that.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.940
 Just like it wants a world

15:32.940 --> 15:36.620
 that has regular geometric figures.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.900
 So for example, Descartes pointed this out

15:38.900 --> 15:41.820
 that if you have an infant

15:41.820 --> 15:46.820
 who's never seen a triangle before and you draw a triangle,

15:47.660 --> 15:52.220
 the infant will see a distorted triangle,

15:52.220 --> 15:56.340
 not whatever crazy figure it actually is.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.420
 Three lines not coming quite together,

15:58.420 --> 16:00.300
 one of them a little bit curved and so on.

16:00.300 --> 16:04.500
 We just impose a conception of the world

16:04.500 --> 16:09.340
 in terms of geometric, perfect geometric objects.

16:09.340 --> 16:12.140
 It's now been shown that goes way beyond that.

16:12.140 --> 16:15.420
 That if you show on a tachistoscope,

16:15.420 --> 16:18.540
 let's say a couple of lights shining,

16:18.540 --> 16:20.860
 you do it three or four times in a row.

16:20.860 --> 16:25.240
 What people actually see is a rigid object in motion,

16:25.240 --> 16:26.900
 not whatever's there.

16:26.900 --> 16:31.900
 We all know that from a television set basically.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.660
 So that gives us hints of potential limits

16:34.660 --> 16:35.980
 to our cognition.

16:35.980 --> 16:39.420
 I think it does, but it's a very contested view.

16:39.420 --> 16:42.300
 If you do a poll among scientists,

16:42.300 --> 16:45.460
 it's impossible we can understand anything.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.620
 Let me ask and give me a chance with this.

16:48.620 --> 16:52.540
 So I just spent a day at a company called Neuralink

16:52.540 --> 16:56.380
 and what they do is try to design

16:56.380 --> 16:59.580
 what's called the brain machine, brain computer interface.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.300
 So they try to do thousands readings in the brain,

17:03.300 --> 17:05.580
 be able to read what the neurons are firing

17:05.580 --> 17:08.540
 and then stimulate back, so two way.

17:08.540 --> 17:12.780
 Do you think their dream is to expand the capacity

17:12.780 --> 17:16.660
 of the brain to attain information,

17:16.660 --> 17:18.180
 sort of increase the bandwidth

17:18.180 --> 17:22.460
 of which we can search Google kind of thing?

17:22.460 --> 17:26.260
 Do you think our cognitive capacity might be expanded

17:26.260 --> 17:29.340
 our linguistic capacity, our ability to reason

17:29.340 --> 17:33.180
 might be expanded by adding a machine into the picture?

17:33.180 --> 17:35.620
 Can be expanded in a certain sense,

17:35.620 --> 17:39.860
 but a sense that was known thousands of years ago.

17:39.860 --> 17:43.700
 A book expands your cognitive capacity.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.060
 Okay, so this could expand it too.

17:46.060 --> 17:47.940
 But it's not a fundamental expansion.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.940
 It's not totally new things could be understood.

17:50.940 --> 17:53.060
 Well, nothing that goes beyond

17:53.060 --> 17:56.500
 their native cognitive capacities.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.620
 Just like you can't turn the visual system

17:58.620 --> 18:00.660
 into an insect system.

18:00.660 --> 18:03.300
 Well, I mean, the thought is,

18:04.220 --> 18:06.820
 the thought is perhaps you can't directly,

18:06.820 --> 18:08.660
 but you can map sort of.

18:08.660 --> 18:10.060
 You couldn't, but we already,

18:10.060 --> 18:12.380
 we know that without this experiment.

18:12.380 --> 18:16.740
 You could map what a bee sees and present it in a form

18:16.740 --> 18:17.980
 so that we could follow it.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.940
 In fact, every bee scientist does that.

18:19.940 --> 18:24.420
 But you don't think there's something greater than bees

18:25.380 --> 18:29.700
 that we can map and then all of a sudden discover something,

18:29.700 --> 18:33.780
 be able to understand a quantum world, quantum mechanics,

18:33.780 --> 18:35.980
 be able to start to be able to make sense.

18:35.980 --> 18:40.460
 Students at MIT study and understand quantum mechanics.

18:41.660 --> 18:45.100
 But they always reduce it to the infant, the physical.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.900
 I mean, they don't really understand.

18:46.900 --> 18:50.260
 Oh, you don't, there's thing, that may be another area

18:50.260 --> 18:52.740
 where there's just a limit to understanding.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.500
 We understand the theories,

18:54.500 --> 18:58.420
 but the world that it describes doesn't make any sense.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.460
 So, you know, the experiment, Schrodinger's cat,

19:01.460 --> 19:03.700
 for example, can understand the theory,

19:03.700 --> 19:05.780
 but as Schrodinger pointed out,

19:05.780 --> 19:07.500
 it's an unintelligible world.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.140
 One of the reasons why Einstein

19:11.140 --> 19:14.420
 was always very skeptical about quantum theory,

19:14.420 --> 19:19.340
 was that he described himself as a classical realist,

19:19.340 --> 19:23.060
 in one's intelligibility.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.020
 He has something in common with infants in that way.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.980
 So, back to linguistics.

19:30.940 --> 19:34.020
 If you could humor me, what are the most beautiful

19:34.020 --> 19:36.100
 or fascinating aspects of language

19:36.100 --> 19:38.740
 or ideas in linguistics or cognitive science

19:38.740 --> 19:42.060
 that you've seen in a lifetime of studying language

19:42.060 --> 19:44.180
 and studying the human mind?

19:44.180 --> 19:49.180
 Well, I think the deepest property of language

19:50.140 --> 19:52.820
 and puzzling property that's been discovered

19:52.820 --> 19:57.180
 is what is sometimes called structure dependence.

19:57.180 --> 19:59.580
 We now understand it pretty well,

19:59.580 --> 20:01.940
 but it was puzzling for a long time.

20:01.940 --> 20:03.620
 I'll give you a concrete example.

20:03.620 --> 20:08.620
 So, suppose you say the guy who fixed the car

20:09.420 --> 20:13.100
 carefully packed his tools, it's ambiguous.

20:13.100 --> 20:17.940
 He could fix the car carefully or carefully pack his tools.

20:17.940 --> 20:21.060
 Suppose you put carefully in front,

20:21.060 --> 20:25.860
 carefully the guy who fixed the car packed his tools,

20:25.860 --> 20:29.380
 then it's carefully packed, not carefully fixed.

20:29.380 --> 20:32.300
 And in fact, you do that even if it makes no sense.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.620
 So, suppose you say carefully,

20:34.620 --> 20:38.140
 the guy who fixed the car is tall.

20:39.340 --> 20:41.860
 You have to interpret it as carefully he's tall,

20:41.860 --> 20:44.300
 even though that doesn't make any sense.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.180
 And notice that that's a very puzzling fact

20:47.180 --> 20:50.060
 because you're relating carefully

20:50.060 --> 20:53.620
 not to the linearly closest verb,

20:53.620 --> 20:57.300
 but to the linearly more remote verb.

20:57.300 --> 21:02.300
 A linear closeness is an easy computation,

21:02.340 --> 21:03.700
 but here you're doing a much more,

21:03.700 --> 21:06.780
 what looks like a more complex computation.

21:06.780 --> 21:10.180
 You're doing something that's taking you essentially

21:10.180 --> 21:11.860
 to the more remote thing.

21:13.580 --> 21:16.620
 It's now, if you look at the actual structure

21:16.620 --> 21:20.140
 of the sentence, where the phrases are and so on,

21:20.140 --> 21:24.180
 turns out you're picking out the structurally closest thing,

21:24.180 --> 21:27.940
 but the linearly more remote thing.

21:27.940 --> 21:32.500
 But notice that what's linear is 100% of what you hear.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.140
 You never hear structure, can't.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.300
 So, what you're doing is,

21:37.300 --> 21:40.660
 and certainly this is universal, all constructions,

21:40.660 --> 21:44.660
 all languages, and what we're compelled to do

21:44.660 --> 21:48.660
 is carry out what looks like the more complex computation

21:48.660 --> 21:52.260
 on material that we never hear,

21:52.260 --> 21:55.380
 and we ignore 100% of what we hear

21:55.380 --> 21:57.500
 and the simplest computation.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.700
 By now, there's even a neural basis for this

22:00.700 --> 22:02.860
 that's somewhat understood,

22:02.860 --> 22:04.380
 and there's good theories by now

22:04.380 --> 22:06.620
 that explain why it's true.

22:06.620 --> 22:11.580
 That's a deep insight into the surprising nature of language

22:11.580 --> 22:13.140
 with many consequences.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.540
 Let me ask you about a field of machine learning,

22:17.540 --> 22:18.940
 deep learning.

22:18.940 --> 22:22.060
 There's been a lot of progress in neural networks based,

22:22.060 --> 22:26.380
 neural network based machine learning in the recent decade.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.940
 Of course, neural network research goes back many decades.

22:30.780 --> 22:35.580
 What do you think are the limits of deep learning,

22:35.580 --> 22:38.500
 of neural network based machine learning?

22:38.500 --> 22:41.140
 Well, to give a real answer to that,

22:41.140 --> 22:44.940
 you'd have to understand the exact processes

22:44.940 --> 22:47.940
 that are taking place, and those are pretty opaque.

22:47.940 --> 22:50.260
 So, it's pretty hard to prove a theorem

22:50.260 --> 22:54.060
 about what can be done and what can't be done,

22:54.060 --> 22:56.820
 but I think it's reasonably clear.

22:56.820 --> 22:59.180
 I mean, putting technicalities aside,

22:59.180 --> 23:01.940
 what deep learning is doing

23:01.940 --> 23:05.340
 is taking huge numbers of examples

23:05.340 --> 23:07.740
 and finding some patterns.

23:07.740 --> 23:11.980
 Okay, that could be interesting in some areas it is,

23:11.980 --> 23:15.060
 but we have to ask here a certain question.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.220
 Is it engineering or is it science?

23:18.220 --> 23:20.580
 Engineering in the sense of just trying

23:20.580 --> 23:22.820
 to build something that's useful,

23:22.820 --> 23:24.780
 or science in the sense that it's trying

23:24.780 --> 23:28.740
 to understand something about elements of the world.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.820
 So, take, say, a Google parser.

23:31.820 --> 23:33.860
 We can ask that question.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.860
 Is it useful, yeah, it's pretty useful.

23:36.860 --> 23:41.860
 I use a Google translator, so on engineering grounds,

23:41.860 --> 23:45.740
 it's kind of worth having, like a bulldozer.

23:45.740 --> 23:48.900
 Does it tell you anything about human language?

23:48.900 --> 23:53.900
 Zero, nothing, and in fact, it's very striking.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.780
 From the very beginning,

23:56.780 --> 24:00.300
 it's just totally remote from science.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.580
 So, what is a Google parser doing?

24:02.580 --> 24:05.140
 It's taking an enormous text,

24:05.140 --> 24:07.700
 let's say the Wall Street Journal corpus,

24:07.700 --> 24:10.540
 and asking how close can we come

24:10.540 --> 24:14.100
 to getting the right description

24:14.100 --> 24:16.380
 of every sentence in the corpus.

24:16.380 --> 24:18.500
 Well, every sentence in the corpus

24:18.500 --> 24:21.540
 is essentially an experiment.

24:21.540 --> 24:24.740
 Each sentence that you produce is an experiment

24:24.740 --> 24:27.700
 which says, am I a grammatical sentence?

24:27.700 --> 24:29.620
 The answer is usually yes.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.300
 So, most of the stuff in the corpus

24:31.300 --> 24:33.220
 is grammatical sentences.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.820
 But now, ask yourself, is there any science

24:36.820 --> 24:40.140
 which takes random experiments

24:40.140 --> 24:43.700
 which are carried out for no reason whatsoever

24:43.700 --> 24:46.500
 and tries to find out something from them?

24:46.500 --> 24:49.660
 Like if you're, say, a chemistry PhD student,

24:49.660 --> 24:51.180
 you wanna get a thesis, can you say,

24:51.180 --> 24:55.380
 well, I'm just gonna mix a lot of things together,

24:55.380 --> 24:59.660
 no purpose, and maybe I'll find something.

24:59.660 --> 25:02.420
 You'd be laughed out of the department.

25:02.420 --> 25:06.180
 Science tries to find critical experiments,

25:06.180 --> 25:09.100
 ones that answer some theoretical question.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.940
 Doesn't care about coverage of millions of experiments.

25:12.940 --> 25:16.220
 So, it just begins by being very remote from science

25:16.220 --> 25:18.220
 and it continues like that.

25:18.220 --> 25:21.620
 So, the usual question that's asked about,

25:21.620 --> 25:25.180
 say, a Google parser is how well does it do,

25:25.180 --> 25:28.300
 or some parser, how well does it do on a corpus?

25:28.300 --> 25:31.100
 But there's another question that's never asked.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.900
 How well does it do on something

25:32.900 --> 25:36.060
 that violates all the rules of language?

25:36.060 --> 25:38.700
 So, for example, take the structure dependence case

25:38.700 --> 25:39.660
 that I mentioned.

25:39.660 --> 25:41.580
 Suppose there was a language

25:41.580 --> 25:45.780
 in which you used linear proximity

25:45.780 --> 25:49.020
 as the mode of interpretation.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.700
 These deep learning would work very easily on that.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.740
 In fact, much more easily on an actual language.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.900
 Is that a success?

25:55.900 --> 25:59.020
 No, that's a failure from a scientific point of view.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.340
 It's a failure.

26:00.340 --> 26:03.460
 It shows that we're not discovering

26:03.460 --> 26:05.780
 the nature of the system at all,

26:05.780 --> 26:07.700
 because it does just as well or even better

26:07.700 --> 26:10.820
 on things that violate the structure of the system.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.660
 And it goes on from there.

26:12.660 --> 26:14.740
 It's not an argument against doing it.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.140
 It is useful to have devices like this.

26:17.140 --> 26:20.620
 So, yes, so neural networks are kind of approximators

26:20.620 --> 26:24.340
 that look, there's echoes of the behavioral debates, right?

26:24.340 --> 26:26.140
 Behavioralism.

26:26.140 --> 26:27.580
 More than echoes.

26:27.580 --> 26:30.060
 Many of the people in deep learning

26:30.060 --> 26:34.540
 say they've vindicated Terry Sanyosky, for example,

26:34.540 --> 26:35.700
 in his recent books,

26:35.700 --> 26:39.500
 as this vindicates Skinnerian behaviors.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.420
 It doesn't have anything to do with it.

26:41.420 --> 26:43.780
 Yes, but I think there's something

26:44.620 --> 26:46.140
 actually fundamentally different

26:46.140 --> 26:48.260
 when the data set is huge.

26:48.260 --> 26:51.140
 But your point is extremely well taken.

26:51.140 --> 26:55.380
 But do you think we can learn, approximate

26:55.380 --> 26:58.780
 that interesting complex structure of language

26:58.780 --> 27:00.100
 with neural networks

27:00.100 --> 27:02.740
 that will somehow help us understand the science?

27:03.620 --> 27:04.460
 It's possible.

27:04.460 --> 27:07.220
 I mean, you find patterns that you hadn't noticed,

27:07.220 --> 27:09.700
 let's say, could be.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.580
 In fact, it's very much like a kind of linguistics

27:13.580 --> 27:18.060
 that's done, what's called corpus linguistics.

27:18.060 --> 27:21.060
 When you, suppose you have some language

27:21.060 --> 27:23.420
 where all the speakers have died out,

27:23.420 --> 27:25.100
 but you have records.

27:25.100 --> 27:28.060
 So you just look at the records

27:28.060 --> 27:30.580
 and see what you can figure out from that.

27:30.580 --> 27:31.900
 It's much better than,

27:31.900 --> 27:33.660
 it's much better to have actual speakers

27:33.660 --> 27:36.060
 where you can do critical experiments.

27:36.060 --> 27:38.500
 But if they're all dead, you can't do them.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.780
 So you have to try to see what you can find out

27:40.780 --> 27:43.860
 from just looking at the data that's around.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.020
 You can learn things.

27:45.020 --> 27:48.380
 Actually, paleoanthropology is very much like that.

27:48.380 --> 27:51.220
 You can't do a critical experiment on

27:51.220 --> 27:53.500
 what happened two million years ago.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.540
 So you're kind of forced just to take what data's around

27:56.540 --> 27:59.220
 and see what you can figure out from it.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.420
 Okay, it's a serious study.

28:01.420 --> 28:05.580
 So let me venture into another whole body of work

28:05.580 --> 28:07.400
 and philosophical question.

28:08.380 --> 28:13.060
 You've said that evil in society arises from institutions,

28:13.060 --> 28:15.540
 not inherently from our nature.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.780
 Do you think most human beings are good,

28:17.780 --> 28:19.580
 they have good intent?

28:19.580 --> 28:22.860
 Or do most have the capacity for intentional evil

28:22.860 --> 28:24.620
 that depends on their upbringing,

28:24.620 --> 28:27.180
 depends on their environment, on context?

28:27.180 --> 28:30.960
 I wouldn't say that they don't arise from our nature.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.020
 Anything we do arises from our nature.

28:34.020 --> 28:38.100
 And the fact that we have certain institutions, not others,

28:38.100 --> 28:43.100
 is one mode in which human nature has expressed itself.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.420
 But as far as we know,

28:45.420 --> 28:48.500
 human nature could yield many different kinds

28:48.500 --> 28:50.220
 of institutions.

28:50.220 --> 28:53.140
 The particular ones that have developed

28:53.140 --> 28:56.940
 have to do with historical contingency,

28:56.940 --> 28:59.140
 who conquered whom, and that sort of thing.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.840
 They're not rooted in our nature

29:03.840 --> 29:06.740
 in the sense that they're essential to our nature.

29:06.740 --> 29:10.140
 So it's commonly argued that these days

29:10.140 --> 29:12.920
 that something like market systems

29:12.920 --> 29:15.580
 is just part of our nature.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.660
 But we know from a huge amount of evidence

29:18.660 --> 29:19.500
 that that's not true.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.740
 There's all kinds of other structures.

29:21.740 --> 29:26.220
 It's a particular fact of a moment of modern history.

29:26.220 --> 29:30.740
 Others have argued that the roots of classical liberalism

29:30.740 --> 29:34.420
 actually argue that what's called sometimes

29:34.420 --> 29:36.460
 an instinct for freedom,

29:36.460 --> 29:39.920
 the instinct to be free of domination

29:39.920 --> 29:43.660
 by illegitimate authority is the core of our nature.

29:43.660 --> 29:45.620
 That would be the opposite of this.

29:45.620 --> 29:47.500
 And we don't know.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.720
 We just know that human nature can accommodate both kinds.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.900
 If you look back at your life,

29:54.900 --> 29:58.100
 is there a moment in your intellectual life

29:58.100 --> 30:00.180
 or life in general that jumps from memory

30:00.180 --> 30:02.100
 that brought you happiness

30:02.100 --> 30:04.020
 that you would love to relive again?

30:05.100 --> 30:06.460
 Sure.

30:06.460 --> 30:10.100
 Falling in love, having children.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.860
 What about, so you have put forward into the world

30:13.860 --> 30:17.660
 a lot of incredible ideas in linguistics,

30:17.660 --> 30:22.300
 in cognitive science, in terms of ideas

30:22.300 --> 30:26.060
 that just excites you when it first came to you

30:26.060 --> 30:28.940
 that you would love to relive those moments.

30:28.940 --> 30:32.140
 Well, I mean, when you make a discovery

30:32.140 --> 30:34.100
 about something that's exciting,

30:34.100 --> 30:39.100
 like, say, even the observation of structure dependence

30:40.500 --> 30:44.440
 and on from that, the explanation for it.

30:44.440 --> 30:49.440
 But the major things just seem like common sense.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.160
 So if you go back to take your question

30:53.160 --> 30:55.820
 about external and internal language,

30:55.820 --> 30:58.120
 you go back to, say, the 1950s,

30:59.140 --> 31:03.900
 almost entirely languages regarded an external object,

31:03.900 --> 31:06.260
 something outside the mind.

31:06.260 --> 31:09.380
 It just seemed obvious that that can't be true.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.220
 Like I said, there's something about you

31:13.220 --> 31:15.340
 that determines you're talking English,

31:15.340 --> 31:18.640
 not Swahili or something.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.280
 But that's not really a discovery.

31:20.280 --> 31:24.100
 That's just an observation, what's transparent.

31:24.100 --> 31:29.100
 You might say it's kind of like the 17th century,

31:30.660 --> 31:33.460
 the beginnings of modern science, 17th century.

31:33.460 --> 31:37.980
 They came from being willing to be puzzled

31:37.980 --> 31:40.400
 about things that seemed obvious.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.280
 So it seems obvious that a heavy ball of lead

31:44.280 --> 31:47.580
 will fall faster than a light ball of lead.

31:47.580 --> 31:50.900
 But Galileo was not impressed by the fact

31:50.900 --> 31:52.680
 that it seemed obvious.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.900
 So he wanted to know if it's true.

31:54.900 --> 31:59.140
 They carried out experiments, actually thought experiments,

31:59.140 --> 32:01.180
 never actually carried them out,

32:01.180 --> 32:04.460
 which that can't be true.

32:04.460 --> 32:09.460
 And out of things like that, observations of that kind,

32:11.600 --> 32:15.740
 why does a ball fall to the ground instead of rising,

32:15.740 --> 32:20.060
 let's say, seems obvious, till you start thinking about it,

32:20.060 --> 32:23.900
 because why does steam rise, let's say.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.260
 And I think the beginnings of modern linguistics,

32:27.260 --> 32:30.060
 roughly in the 50s, are kind of like that,

32:30.060 --> 32:33.620
 just being willing to be puzzled about phenomena

32:33.620 --> 32:38.020
 that looked, from some point of view, obvious.

32:38.020 --> 32:41.340
 And for example, a kind of doctrine,

32:41.340 --> 32:44.960
 almost official doctrine of structural linguistics

32:44.960 --> 32:49.620
 in the 50s was that languages can differ

32:49.620 --> 32:52.660
 from one another in arbitrary ways,

32:52.660 --> 32:56.460
 and each one has to be studied on its own

32:56.460 --> 32:58.900
 without any presuppositions.

32:58.900 --> 33:02.380
 In fact, there were similar views among biologists

33:02.380 --> 33:05.880
 about the nature of organisms, that each one's,

33:05.880 --> 33:07.780
 they're so different when you look at them

33:07.780 --> 33:10.980
 that almost anything, you could be almost anything.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.140
 Well, in both domains, it's been learned

33:13.140 --> 33:15.500
 that that's very far from true.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.860
 There are narrow constraints on what could be an organism

33:18.860 --> 33:20.620
 or what could be a language.

33:21.580 --> 33:25.540
 But these are, that's just the nature of inquiry.

33:25.540 --> 33:29.380
 Inquiry. Science in general, yeah, inquiry.

33:29.380 --> 33:33.420
 So one of the peculiar things about us human beings

33:33.420 --> 33:35.300
 is our mortality.

33:35.300 --> 33:38.220
 Ernest Becker explored it in general.

33:38.220 --> 33:40.460
 Do you ponder the value of mortality?

33:40.460 --> 33:42.460
 Do you think about your own mortality?

33:43.460 --> 33:46.820
 I used to when I was about 12 years old.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.940
 I wondered, I didn't care much about my own mortality,

33:51.940 --> 33:54.540
 but I was worried about the fact that

33:54.540 --> 33:57.700
 if my consciousness disappeared,

33:57.700 --> 34:00.300
 would the entire universe disappear?

34:00.300 --> 34:01.580
 That was frightening.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.740
 Did you ever find an answer to that question?

34:03.740 --> 34:05.900
 No, nobody's ever found an answer,

34:05.900 --> 34:07.900
 but I stopped being bothered by it.

34:07.900 --> 34:10.380
 It's kind of like Woody Allen in one of his films,

34:10.380 --> 34:14.100
 you may recall, he starts, he goes to a shrink

34:14.100 --> 34:16.460
 when he's a child and the shrink asks him,

34:16.460 --> 34:17.500
 what's your problem?

34:17.500 --> 34:21.700
 He says, I just learned that the universe is expanding.

34:21.700 --> 34:22.740
 I can't handle that.

34:22.740 --> 34:27.220
 And then another absurd question is,

34:27.220 --> 34:32.220
 what do you think is the meaning of our existence here,

34:32.620 --> 34:35.980
 our life on Earth, our brief little moment in time?

34:35.980 --> 34:38.580
 That's something we answer by our own activities.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.340
 There's no general answer.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.620
 We determine what the meaning of it is.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.700
 The action determine the meaning.

34:48.700 --> 34:50.580
 Meaning in the sense of significance,

34:50.580 --> 34:54.500
 not meaning in the sense that chair means this.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.820
 But the significance of your life is something you create.

35:01.060 --> 35:02.540
 No, thank you so much for talking to me today.

35:02.540 --> 35:04.140
