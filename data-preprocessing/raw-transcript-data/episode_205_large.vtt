 The following is a conversation with Zach Bitter, ultramarathon runner and coach who held multiple

00:05.600 --> 00:12.240
 world records in the 100 mile run and other ultra endurance events. He is currently training for a

00:12.240 --> 00:18.720
 run across America, which for now is planned for September this year. Like many of the things Zach

00:18.720 --> 00:24.960
 has done in the past, this is a big, fascinating challenge. Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:24.960 --> 00:31.520
 Ladder, Valcampo, Noom, and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.480
 As a side note, let me say that Zach has been advising and coaching me on my own

00:36.480 --> 00:41.120
 running journey. I want to mention that Zach sent me some running shoes from Ultra,

00:41.120 --> 00:46.160
 which I think is a company that sponsors him. When I put those shoes on, I feel like Zach is

00:46.160 --> 00:52.320
 watching me, and I get that extra motivation to make him proud. And by that, I mean I want to put

00:52.320 --> 00:57.120
 a lot of miles on those shoes. Running is something that has always been difficult for me,

00:57.120 --> 01:03.120
 but I love it because it is difficult. The hardest part is I'm left alone with my thoughts

01:03.120 --> 01:09.680
 for one or two hours. Some thoughts are dark, like thinking about mortality, my own and that of

01:09.680 --> 01:16.960
 others. Some are self critical, like personal weaknesses or dreams not realized. Some are simply

01:16.960 --> 01:23.760
 human feelings of loneliness, personal and existential. And yet, there are the moments

01:23.760 --> 01:30.240
 during a run when all that fades and I'm left empty of negative thoughts and full of appreciation

01:30.240 --> 01:36.640
 for the beauty of experience, of nature, life, the whole thing. This is why I return to running.

01:37.440 --> 01:43.280
 Not to get in shape, but to face myself and to run through it. That's why I'm inspired by people

01:43.280 --> 01:50.080
 like Zach and by David Goggins and others like them who seek to find the limits of their body

01:50.080 --> 01:56.720
 and mind. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Zach Bitter.

01:58.080 --> 02:03.360
 Where does your mind go when you're running an ultra marathon? Are there a lot of positive

02:03.360 --> 02:09.200
 thoughts, negative thoughts, demons, inspirational things, maybe no thoughts at all? Yeah, that's the

02:09.200 --> 02:13.680
 really interesting part of the sport, I think, because you can essentially what it is when we're

02:13.680 --> 02:18.160
 looking at like the hundred mile distance or anything that's like all day long is you're

02:18.160 --> 02:24.000
 going to have the full range of the full spectrum of emotions of mental processes, both kind of

02:24.000 --> 02:31.120
 positive, negative and in between. So it almost feels like you've lived multiple, multiple lives

02:31.120 --> 02:36.240
 or full life, maybe it was way to say it in that one time period. So it's like a it's almost like

02:36.240 --> 02:40.880
 assimilation of what you may experience in a long period of time in a very condensed period of time.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.520
 And I think that's just a weird mental process to reflect upon. And that's what kind of draws people

02:45.520 --> 02:50.560
 back to it. But I mean, it's a battle, too, because if you're looking at it from a performance

02:50.560 --> 02:55.440
 standpoint versus an experience, you obviously want to minimize the negative mindset stuff.

02:55.440 --> 03:01.920
 You want to try to keep those emotions and those thought processes at a low. And I think when you

03:01.920 --> 03:08.400
 can keep yourself from letting those thoughts creep in, they you end up having better races

03:08.400 --> 03:12.960
 and it's it can spiral in either direction. Like I notice like there's there's kind of like this

03:12.960 --> 03:17.280
 scenario that occurs where in the beginning, like a negative thing creeps in your mind. It's like

03:17.280 --> 03:21.280
 super easy just to slap it down and say, like, get out of here. You know, I did the training,

03:21.280 --> 03:25.120
 I'm fit, I'm feeling fresh still. You know, everything's going well at this point in time.

03:26.080 --> 03:31.120
 You get a little further along in the race and you're starting to feel a bit of the fatigue,

03:31.120 --> 03:34.480
 I mean, a little bit of self doubt creeps in. You start asking yourself, well, you know,

03:34.480 --> 03:38.960
 maybe I should have done one more long run or did I did I not quite taper long enough? And those

03:38.960 --> 03:44.320
 things can kind of spiral into a negative way. And if if you let it keep going, it keeps going

03:44.320 --> 03:51.920
 all the way to like, why am I here? Why am I doing this? This is stupid. All the way to like,

03:51.920 --> 03:54.960
 there's another one of these two weeks from now, I'm going to drop out of this one and sign up for

03:54.960 --> 03:59.280
 that one instead. And then you just find yourself in the exact same situation. So you kind of have

03:59.280 --> 04:06.000
 to go through the process, I think is why I think there's kind of a I won't say it's a rule of thumb

04:06.000 --> 04:11.440
 necessarily, but something I think is fairly valuable is if you do a hundred mile or the first

04:11.440 --> 04:17.840
 time, make sure you get it done, even if it means like, you know, death marching is what they'll

04:17.840 --> 04:22.480
 call it in the alternate community at the end of the race. Just to say, like, you got that full

04:22.480 --> 04:26.640
 experience, you experience the highs, the lows, the full thing, the starting, the crossing the

04:26.640 --> 04:32.400
 finish line, that release of emotion when you're done and all that stuff. So that when you go back

04:32.400 --> 04:37.600
 to do it again, you have like a template to build off of, then you know, or you just have some data

04:37.600 --> 04:41.440
 to pull from about how your mind is going to work as well as your body so that you can start

04:41.440 --> 04:45.680
 practicing Well, what do I have to do to kind of keep my mind from spiraling in a negative direction?

04:45.680 --> 04:51.120
 Or how do I catch some positive momentum and kind of keep sending it that way, and things like that.

04:51.120 --> 04:57.360
 And that just I think, you just add to that over a career of running them or a series of running

04:57.360 --> 05:02.080
 them and it sharpens. It's kind of like any sport with that where, you know, you always have this

05:02.080 --> 05:07.120
 balance between the youthfulness that you may have earlier in your career versus the wise

05:07.120 --> 05:11.920
 intelligence that you have maybe near the end of your career. So in terms of wisdom, is there

05:11.920 --> 05:18.160
 mechanisms by which you kind of observe the negative thoughts and let them go? So you have

05:18.160 --> 05:25.040
 a people like the David Goggins is who kind of this, he seems to almost like separate his mind

05:25.040 --> 05:32.640
 into there's the weak David that he hates. And then there's this strong, strong one. I mean,

05:32.640 --> 05:38.400
 there's like a very contentious relationship there. So he basically says, like, I refuse to

05:38.400 --> 05:42.480
 be that person. And he's almost like angry at that person. It's almost like sometimes

05:42.480 --> 05:47.440
 literally yelling at that person, the weak version of themselves. And then there's another more sort

05:47.440 --> 05:56.720
 of Sam Harris the approach, which is like, just observe the thought and let it go. Maybe knowing

05:56.720 --> 06:02.480
 that this too shall pass, like no matter what it, this moment will not last forever. And kind of

06:02.480 --> 06:07.840
 sort of accepting the natural flow of things and taking one step at a time and allowing whatever

06:07.840 --> 06:12.720
 the negativity, whatever the pain you're experiencing just to pass, even if it means a

06:12.720 --> 06:18.160
 death march, which one is more effective for you? Which one, like, would you say generally speaking

06:18.160 --> 06:24.080
 to the population is more effective? Yeah, that's a really good question. It's probably unique to

06:24.080 --> 06:29.280
 the individual. I wouldn't argue that, you know, David is finding success with his approach.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.600
 Some may argue it's an extreme version. You know, Sam has obviously thought about these things and

06:37.360 --> 06:42.320
 really probably, you know, I see those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum in just the

06:42.320 --> 06:47.440
 way that they kind of come across in general, where like David's like really at your kind of

06:47.440 --> 06:52.320
 high energy and Sam's kind of this calming, soft presence and he's just going to slowly,

06:52.320 --> 06:57.760
 methodically lay it all out there. And I think there's value on in both of those. I think

06:57.760 --> 07:03.120
 most people are probably going to get a benefit from pulling some from each. I mean, there's

07:03.120 --> 07:08.000
 times where, where I need a kick in the ass and then it's like, have the strong Zach, tell the

07:08.000 --> 07:13.120
 weak Zach to get moving. But there's also times where, you know, it's just like, you know, a

07:13.120 --> 07:17.680
 subtle voice entering my head about, you know, I don't know if I feel quite right now. Should I

07:18.400 --> 07:24.320
 maybe pull back on the pace? And I think that little subtle voice is best approached with a

07:24.320 --> 07:29.040
 subtle positive voice where it's more like, okay, well let's think this through here for a second.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.360
 You're 40 miles into a hundred mile race. You spent four months preparing for it.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.440
 Uh, you know, from the workouts you did that you're ready for this, there really isn't any

07:38.160 --> 07:44.080
 real reason for you to slow down or to fall off your goal or your pace or, you know, reassess

07:44.080 --> 07:50.240
 what you're doing. Let's just give this another mile or two. And then we can reassess if we need

07:50.240 --> 07:54.960
 to, and in order to kind of figure out if I'm doing the right things or not. And I think like

07:54.960 --> 08:00.000
 in that situation, um, you definitely probably want to lean more towards the Sam Harris approach

08:00.000 --> 08:03.920
 with that because there's really no reason to, it's almost like the same thing you see with like

08:04.640 --> 08:10.080
 just training and even nutrition to a degree where like some folks, they just want to be like,

08:10.080 --> 08:15.360
 kind of like drilled. They want to be like yelled at and said, like, get going, get doing this. And

08:15.360 --> 08:19.760
 that helps and that motivates them. That helps them stay accountable. Other people need some

08:19.760 --> 08:24.160
 softer love with it where it's like, you know, this isn't necessarily your thought, your, your

08:24.160 --> 08:29.440
 fault. You were put in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy and

08:29.440 --> 08:35.280
 lethargy and maybe poor nutritional choices and things like that. And, and like, so, but it's,

08:35.280 --> 08:39.360
 it's correctable. So we need to, we need to step away from that and we need to kind of start

08:39.360 --> 08:43.360
 heading in the direction that we know is going to bear fruit down the road. And that person may

08:43.360 --> 08:48.480
 respond better to that. So I think both those guys have great value with their approaches.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.800
 They're just probably polar ends of that, of the spectrum. And I think most people are probably

08:52.800 --> 08:56.400
 going to benefit like anything, right? You get the polarizing ones and those are going to work

08:56.400 --> 08:59.600
 right for the polarizing people. But then most people are going to fit somewhere in the middle.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.920
 So they're probably going to be able to kind of pull from both of those if they're able to sit

09:03.920 --> 09:08.320
 down and kind of like assess which one's going to work better in which situation. So the quitting

09:08.320 --> 09:13.360
 thing that you mentioned, the, like the final stage, which actually I get to much quicker

09:13.360 --> 09:19.120
 than you seem to, which is like, why am I doing this? I get there with basically anything I do.

09:19.920 --> 09:26.000
 It's like, this is, this is probably the stupidest thing I've ever done is the feeling I get often.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.880
 And then immediately you have these excuses that are like, there's all these other better things

09:30.880 --> 09:37.440
 you should be doing. Or, or the other alternative of that, like you said, I'm not prepared enough

09:37.440 --> 09:42.560
 for this moment. I'll be much more prepared in two weeks for the next event. So like,

09:42.560 --> 09:46.720
 why let's try this again. Let's start over. Let's start over in two weeks.

09:47.600 --> 09:54.800
 How do you deal with that quit? Like, so maybe do you still go through that process and

09:54.800 --> 10:01.360
 and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like me, how to deal with

10:01.360 --> 10:06.160
 that quitting voice? I think a lot of times when the quitting voice kind of comes in,

10:06.960 --> 10:13.680
 it, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage, I guess,

10:13.680 --> 10:17.520
 in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you're looking at like,

10:19.680 --> 10:23.840
 what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're feeling in the moment versus how

10:23.840 --> 10:30.720
 are you feeling about the whole process? So one thing that I started doing in 2019, and I think,

10:30.720 --> 10:37.600
 I don't think it's necessarily, I think, I think, I think this was a big reason why I had one of

10:37.600 --> 10:43.680
 my best racing seasons in 2019 that I'd had to that date. It was part of it was I started, I

10:43.680 --> 10:49.040
 think, putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus putting emphasis on like,

10:49.040 --> 10:56.320
 this is one opportunity or one day of work. And this is one, one emotional kind of flare up.

10:57.040 --> 11:03.120
 But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture? So when I decide to do a race

11:03.120 --> 11:08.000
 or an event or something like that, it's often four, six months out ahead of time,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.640
 you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're going

11:12.640 --> 11:16.000
 through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day

11:16.000 --> 11:19.840
 and all that stuff. And then you get to the race itself or the event itself. And

11:20.480 --> 11:26.960
 it's very easy to look at that and think that's an isolation. Like I'm going to run 12 hours today,

11:26.960 --> 11:31.360
 or I'm going to run a hundred miles today or whatever it ends up being. And it's a lot easier

11:31.360 --> 11:38.160
 to quit when you think to yourself, I'm 40 miles into a hundred mile race. You know, that's just a

11:38.160 --> 11:43.440
 40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most people, but in perspective, then we're talking

11:43.440 --> 11:47.200
 about the ultra marathon running community. You know, it's a lot easier just to say like, well,

11:47.200 --> 11:52.720
 you know, I'll scrap this 40 miles and try again. It's a lot harder to say I'm going to scrap the

11:52.720 --> 11:58.320
 entire last four months, the entire reason why I was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.240
 So I think I just try to reposition it of like, I'm in a bad place right now,

12:02.240 --> 12:08.560
 maybe in my head or I'm not, I'm hitting a low point here, but I'm 99% of the way towards the

12:08.560 --> 12:12.080
 goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did leading up to that.

12:12.080 --> 12:18.720
 So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because, I mean, there are times when you're

12:18.720 --> 12:23.120
 doing something and you ask yourself why, and you don't have a good reason. And then maybe it is

12:23.120 --> 12:27.760
 advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I actually want

12:27.760 --> 12:34.000
 to invest time and energy into? Because, you know, someone like yourself who is very much

12:34.000 --> 12:40.320
 into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get, I mean,

12:40.320 --> 12:44.160
 I'm a very curious person. So there's like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn't

12:44.160 --> 12:49.280
 doing what I'm doing. And I know how to enjoy all of them. So at a certain point though,

12:49.280 --> 12:53.360
 you have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me? And if the answer

12:53.360 --> 12:56.960
 keeps coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that

12:56.960 --> 13:02.240
 a hundred things that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason.

13:02.240 --> 13:07.040
 Then I just need to identify some of those things like, well, why did this one take the top spot out

13:07.040 --> 13:11.840
 of the hundred things that I could have picked from? And keeping like a list of those in your

13:11.840 --> 13:16.640
 head so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this? Why am I here?

13:16.640 --> 13:20.640
 You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on

13:20.640 --> 13:23.840
 that before I started this. And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's

13:23.840 --> 13:28.800
 early, middle or late. And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you

13:28.800 --> 13:32.160
 had a little more of a level head. Well, there's something about the thing you mentioned when you

13:32.160 --> 13:39.600
 mentioned the death march. It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting. Like in the

13:39.600 --> 13:47.280
 moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if you do go through the process

13:47.280 --> 13:53.120
 and realize that it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your life.

13:53.120 --> 14:00.080
 Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having that

14:00.080 --> 14:06.400
 escape clause from other things in your life. So I've quit on a few things in my life. And

14:06.400 --> 14:14.080
 I think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door. It's almost like a muscle.

14:14.080 --> 14:20.800
 I don't know. So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter.

14:21.600 --> 14:27.440
 You know what I mean? Like I'm really good at coming up with reasons to quit.

14:27.440 --> 14:33.840
 My mind is really good at that. And I, it feels like I have to come up with, like really work

14:33.840 --> 14:39.840
 hard to make sure that there's no quit. That I never allow myself to quit no matter how stupid

14:39.840 --> 14:45.120
 the thing I'm doing is. I don't know if that any of that makes sense, but it just, maybe to

14:45.120 --> 14:52.960
 rephrase this whole thing. Do you think it's good to live life by the ethos of never quit?

14:52.960 --> 14:57.760
 Yeah, that's a really interesting thing. And I think it actually resonates with a lot of

14:57.760 --> 15:03.680
 ultra marathon runners because there seems to be a trend when you have someone who's been in the

15:03.680 --> 15:08.160
 sport for a long time where there's a point where they start the sport, right? And they're like,

15:08.720 --> 15:13.680
 super excited about everything. Everything's new. It's very easy not to quit because you're like,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.960
 Oh, this is the first time I've ever run a 50 case. The first time I ever run a 50 miles,

15:16.960 --> 15:20.720
 the first time I ever in a hundred case, first time I ever in a hundred miles and so on and so forth.

15:20.720 --> 15:27.360
 And when you're doing that for the first time, I think there's a heightened motivation to not quit

15:27.360 --> 15:33.440
 because you don't want your first attempt to be a failure. And then you get a little further along

15:34.000 --> 15:38.480
 and you start reflecting on the landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find

15:38.480 --> 15:44.720
 yourself quitting on an event. And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once,

15:44.720 --> 15:50.800
 now all of a sudden, like you, like you described perfectly that quit pops up in your head maybe a

15:50.800 --> 15:54.960
 little sooner than next time or maybe a little bit before. And I've certainly had these experiences

15:54.960 --> 16:01.440
 in my career as well. And what happens, I think if you stick with it, again, I think it is important

16:01.440 --> 16:06.720
 to assess whether you really want to be doing what you're doing. But if you start recognizing that

16:06.720 --> 16:10.240
 about yourself in a certain activity where it's like, I think I might be pulling the plug early on

16:10.240 --> 16:16.560
 some of this stuff. I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just at that point,

16:16.560 --> 16:20.640
 you need to make a decision. Do I want to keep doing this? If the answer is yes, you hold yourself

16:20.640 --> 16:25.280
 accountable to not quitting. And eventually what will happen is you'll find yourself in a position

16:25.280 --> 16:29.440
 where I'll use ultra marathons, for example, where you're just clicking on all cylinders for that day.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.120
 And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind. You have these low points,

16:35.120 --> 16:39.440
 but for whatever reason, when those low points are high, you're going to find yourself in a

16:39.440 --> 16:43.200
 reason when those low points come, you're able to push through them better than you would have in

16:43.200 --> 16:48.400
 the past. And then you push through maybe two or three more than you did after you had quit the

16:48.400 --> 16:53.920
 time before. Then it's accountability time, right? Because then you have to look back at that and say,

16:54.560 --> 17:02.480
 well, why did this time, was I able to be mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra

17:02.480 --> 17:07.280
 opportunities to quit when I wasn't before? And it can be easy to look back and say,

17:07.280 --> 17:12.640
 and live kind of retroactively in the sense where you're regretting, well, why did I drop out of

17:12.640 --> 17:16.640
 those races? Why did I do this wrong there? And I just think that's where you have to kind of

17:16.640 --> 17:21.680
 catch yourself and say, no, those things happened to me in order to put me in a position where I

17:21.680 --> 17:27.360
 decided, well, this time I'm not going to quit no matter what, minus my leg falling off. I'm not

17:27.360 --> 17:31.840
 going to quit. And then you put yourself in a position to have that day where you push through

17:31.840 --> 17:35.840
 more times than you ever have before. And you just redefine what you're capable of. And then once I

17:35.840 --> 17:41.680
 think you do that, you start looking at those earlier lessons as, as lessons, you know, were

17:41.680 --> 17:47.520
 they failures on paper at the time? Probably. But can you pull things from them to learn as to like,

17:47.520 --> 17:52.000
 well, where is your actual threshold? Where is the limit actually for you? And then kind of start

17:52.000 --> 17:59.840
 redefining that stuff. Um, so I think like the never quit mentality can be good in certain

17:59.840 --> 18:05.920
 situations, but I don't think it's necessarily like a, like a holistic thing where you need to be in

18:05.920 --> 18:09.840
 something where it's never quit, always do more. Cause then you end up in a situation where you

18:09.840 --> 18:13.440
 find this like margin of diminishing returns, especially when it comes to training and workouts

18:13.440 --> 18:18.720
 and things like that, where there are times where often there are times where you want to actually

18:18.720 --> 18:23.760
 quit a little bit before you would have to, because the stress that was required to elicit a, a growth

18:23.760 --> 18:27.680
 response has already occurred. And then just to do more is just going to require more recovery time

18:27.680 --> 18:33.760
 to get back and do it again. Yeah. This is the tricky trade off living by the never quit mentality.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.720
 You're not going to achieve optimal performance in your head. You might.

18:39.600 --> 18:44.000
 It seems like when you look at the full arc of human history,

18:45.440 --> 18:53.440
 the people who do great things are more leaning towards the never quit. Like, uh, I feel like at

18:53.440 --> 19:00.720
 any one moment you're more in danger of quitting than you are being suboptimal. So like, um, in

19:00.720 --> 19:09.040
 terms of advice, it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice. Unless you deeply know

19:09.040 --> 19:15.040
 the person, maybe this is like wrestling mentality. I've seen too many, and because I'm annoyed with

19:15.040 --> 19:19.680
 the current culture telling me to relax and, and, uh, have a work life balance and all those kinds

19:19.680 --> 19:27.680
 of things, uh, which all have a deep, deep truth to them. But the reality is like, there's not enough

19:27.680 --> 19:35.440
 people that walk up to me and like slap me and say, get your shit together. Like don't quit,

19:35.440 --> 19:42.480
 work harder. I think we need to hear that more. I, and like, I remember that, um, from the wrestling

19:42.480 --> 19:48.960
 rooms, like that when you're pushed that way, when you're forced to the very limit and you don't quit,

19:48.960 --> 19:55.200
 that makes better humans. I think people need to get that in their life. I think they need to have

19:55.200 --> 20:01.360
 situations where that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue, experience

20:01.360 --> 20:08.480
 that avenue, um, where I think it's maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire life

20:08.480 --> 20:15.520
 philosophy where like every little thing you do is never quit. But life is short, Zach. Like why? I

20:15.520 --> 20:21.520
 mean, this is the problem I have. This is probably the programming thing too is over optimization

20:21.520 --> 20:28.560
 is dangerous. Uh, it's like every once in a while, I mean, you're, you do this kind of stuff.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.560
 You're not, for example, with a hundred mile run, you're, I mean, you could just be doing that for

20:32.560 --> 20:38.000
 the rest of your life and do like the most optimal hundred mile run ever, but you keep taking on like

20:38.000 --> 20:44.240
 new challenges and there's a lot more chaos in that. And there it feels like the muscle of never

20:44.240 --> 20:48.560
 quit will be much more important than the optimality of your training. Yeah. So there's

20:48.560 --> 20:54.480
 probably a couple sides to me with that kind of a thing where for one, I think when we talked about

20:54.480 --> 21:01.280
 the why, so like, I think the why can kind of shift a bit and it probably will if you do something

21:01.280 --> 21:07.840
 long enough or evolve maybe is a better way to call it, to put it. And for me, like one of my

21:07.840 --> 21:15.120
 my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra running is to first of all, find an event

21:15.120 --> 21:18.960
 that I really, really love to train for and participate in. So for me, I feel like I've

21:18.960 --> 21:24.720
 kind of identified that to a degree and that's kind of runnable hundred milers. So once I found

21:24.720 --> 21:31.280
 that it became more of a driver for me to see like, well, how fast can I run a hundred miles in

21:31.280 --> 21:36.640
 a very controlled environment? So let's eliminate weather, let's eliminate, you know, elevation,

21:36.640 --> 21:41.760
 let's eliminate like having to wait extra long to get crew or support and that sort of thing.

21:41.760 --> 21:46.720
 And that's how you find yourself on a 400 meter track running a hundred miles. But for me, like

21:46.720 --> 21:51.760
 the important part of that is that I can control the environment enough where if I come back year

21:51.760 --> 21:58.560
 after year, I can retest myself and have a decent ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed

21:58.560 --> 22:03.600
 or I stayed stagnant. And I think that's a big driver for me. But one thing I've recognized

22:03.600 --> 22:10.880
 within that is if you just keep doing that, like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred

22:10.880 --> 22:17.440
 milers a year and optimally prepare, race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out.

22:18.160 --> 22:26.480
 But one thing I think I learned also in 2019 was that sometimes you kind of need to step away from

22:26.480 --> 22:32.720
 some of these really, really kind of important markers in your like your performance or in

22:32.720 --> 22:35.920
 whatever you're trying to do and take a step away from it and try to do something a little different

22:37.360 --> 22:42.400
 in order to kind of hit the reset button on just like what I would call just like your mental

22:42.400 --> 22:48.400
 energy to be able to continue to do it at a high level. So almost like happiness. Exactly. Well,

22:48.400 --> 22:52.720
 here's the example. Like, I mean, I love running in trails to most people would consider me a flat

22:52.720 --> 22:58.400
 road track runner, runnable ultra runner. But I like to do trail runs too. So and at the end of

22:58.400 --> 23:06.240
 two thousand and eighteen, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying to

23:06.240 --> 23:10.720
 run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like, OK,

23:10.720 --> 23:15.200
 I did one. Now I'm going to take a brief off season, but then I'm going to ultimately build

23:15.200 --> 23:19.280
 up and peak for another one. I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're

23:19.280 --> 23:23.040
 going to be races are going to be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are going to kind

23:23.040 --> 23:28.560
 of mimic like a long run, essentially. And but the main focus always in the back of my mind was

23:28.560 --> 23:32.640
 like getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles. And that just

23:32.640 --> 23:38.160
 kind of that energy that it takes to continually think by that, that I think the motivation to

23:38.160 --> 23:43.920
 keep that stoke high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from

23:43.920 --> 23:49.680
 it for a little bit. So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided

23:49.680 --> 23:54.800
 I'm going to prepare for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation,

23:55.840 --> 24:01.760
 technical trail type of an event. Is that a trail run or no? Yeah. It's a trail hundred miler

24:02.320 --> 24:08.480
 actually just kind of just outside of San Diego. And yeah, it goes through it goes over part of

24:08.480 --> 24:13.200
 the Pacific Crest Trail and stuff. So it's very different than running on a runnable surface. So

24:13.200 --> 24:18.000
 to give you some context, like I ran was I think just under 17 hours for that race,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.160
 whereas on a flat surface I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes. So just the environment alone added

24:24.160 --> 24:30.240
 an extra, you know, five plus hours to the day. So it's just a different experience, different

24:30.240 --> 24:36.640
 skill set. And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like

24:36.640 --> 24:42.400
 splits on a track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat

24:42.400 --> 24:46.720
 environment and start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical

24:46.720 --> 24:52.560
 running skill sets and things like that. And the cool part about it was, first of all, you know,

24:52.560 --> 24:55.840
 when you step away from something and after something a lot different, I mean, it's still

24:55.840 --> 25:00.160
 running. There's still a huge advantage I had from the running I'd done in the past that was

25:00.160 --> 25:06.800
 going to put me in a good position to be successful. But there was a much higher or a much bigger range

25:06.800 --> 25:12.560
 of potential improvement for me. So through the like four plus months I spent preparing for that

25:12.560 --> 25:17.280
 race, you know, I noticed, oh wow, I'm getting faster on this climb or I'm getting better at

25:17.280 --> 25:21.200
 descending this technical trail. It was one of the most fun races I've run actually. So it was kind

25:21.200 --> 25:27.040
 of a cool experience. I ended up taking the lead at like 93 miles. So you were racing, racing,

25:27.040 --> 25:31.920
 like you were trying to get first. So it's still a race. Yeah. So what was the enjoyable aspect of

25:31.920 --> 25:36.800
 it? I don't think I've recognized it so much while I was doing it actually. It surfaced afterwards. I

25:36.800 --> 25:39.920
 mean, the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're

25:39.920 --> 25:44.400
 sitting in basically second place all day long and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like

25:44.400 --> 25:52.000
 91 or 92 miles. It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race. But afterwards I recognized a

25:52.000 --> 25:57.840
 few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred

25:57.840 --> 26:04.400
 miler versus a second half. I also recognized shortly thereafter once I finished or covered

26:04.400 --> 26:10.480
 and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more

26:10.480 --> 26:15.280
 excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler.

26:15.280 --> 26:19.120
 And I don't think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred

26:19.120 --> 26:26.080
 miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized

26:26.080 --> 26:32.000
 a suboptimal like outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.640
 Yeah. And I recognize that it was just every workout I did. I was like, I did this workout

26:36.640 --> 26:41.600
 a year ago and it was not nearly this much fun. And our, you know, the interesting thing about

26:41.600 --> 26:45.600
 these track hundreds too, is like you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where

26:45.600 --> 26:49.760
 you're running your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so,

26:49.760 --> 26:54.160
 and I'll do them on back to back days. And you know, I try to replicate the environment I'm

26:54.160 --> 26:59.120
 going to race on. So I'm finding myself on a 400 meter track. And it's like when I started doing

26:59.120 --> 27:02.480
 that again, I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those

27:02.480 --> 27:06.800
 back to back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again.

27:06.800 --> 27:10.880
 So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to the

27:10.880 --> 27:15.680
 race day environment that I had in quite some time. And I think that was really beneficial

27:15.680 --> 27:19.200
 and kind of putting me in the right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day

27:19.200 --> 27:23.680
 and put me in a position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood,

27:23.680 --> 27:26.640
 given the enjoyment I had in the months leading into the race itself.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.800
 Yeah, even the thought of quitting. Yeah. Yeah. So you mentioned the track,

27:31.360 --> 27:38.000
 you've also ran 100 miles on the treadmill, and the trail 100 mile. Broadly, if we zoom out,

27:38.000 --> 27:45.760
 what does it take to run 100 miles? For most of the world, that seems like a crazy distance to run.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.640
 So maybe it's interesting to ask, not only is just setting the world record, but

27:50.640 --> 27:56.240
 purely running, what does it take to run that far? Yeah, I mean, I think people probably

27:56.240 --> 28:02.160
 overestimate what it takes in terms of just getting it done. I think this is consistent in

28:02.720 --> 28:06.720
 just running in general. I think the marathon was always a big one with that where people thought

28:06.720 --> 28:12.000
 like, well, you have to do this training, or you just literally won't physically be able to complete

28:12.000 --> 28:17.200
 a marathon. And then we got into an era of kind of like, running as more of an enjoyment thing

28:17.200 --> 28:21.120
 versus a performance thing. And then you'd have people running, granted much slower. I think if

28:21.120 --> 28:25.680
 you look at the Boston Marathon average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the

28:25.680 --> 28:29.520
 Boston Marathon, it might have been marathons in general, went from like three hours to five hours

28:29.520 --> 28:35.440
 or something like that. So it's like, people, I think got past the fact that you can only do it

28:35.440 --> 28:39.600
 if you're optimally prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm

28:39.600 --> 28:45.360
 going to like, not do much training, which I wouldn't necessarily advise. But I mean, I've

28:45.360 --> 28:50.240
 I've talked to people who basically run 100 miles, sometimes almost off the couch. And it's like,

28:50.240 --> 28:54.640
 it's, to me, what that says is just the human body is incredible, and what it can tolerate

28:54.640 --> 28:58.400
 above and beyond what it's been exposed to, if it has to, or if it feels like it has to.

28:58.400 --> 29:04.400
 So that's the basic sort of getting from point A, from the start to the finish. It's the human body

29:04.400 --> 29:09.920
 and the human mind is capable of doing it without much preparation. But then you start to increase

29:09.920 --> 29:16.480
 the goal of performance, and you try to get actually a good, like, the most out of your body

29:16.480 --> 29:22.480
 that you can. How does that start to change then? Yeah, going from fun to performance? Yeah, I think

29:23.200 --> 29:27.440
 once you start putting marks or goals on outside of just finishing, that's where it starts getting

29:27.440 --> 29:31.680
 interesting. Because now you could maybe go on with multiple goals where like, if one falls off

29:31.680 --> 29:35.600
 due to something that you didn't expect, then you have another one to target. But you can always

29:35.600 --> 29:39.440
 build those up and try to think like, well, I want to run faster than last time, or I want to, you

29:39.440 --> 29:46.000
 know, break a course record or an age group record or something like that. And that that I think is

29:46.000 --> 29:50.240
 just going to be a little bit of a different mindset. Because now you're looking at every

29:50.240 --> 29:55.200
 little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what I need to do to be efficient on

29:55.200 --> 30:01.600
 the day itself. So like transitioning aid stations and things like that, or do I want a pacer or not?

30:01.600 --> 30:07.120
 Or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a certain spot? Or do I have to be in

30:07.120 --> 30:12.640
 specific areas to get that type of stuff? And it what ends up doing is it ends up bringing a lot

30:12.640 --> 30:17.440
 more variables to the table. And I think it's interesting, because there's always going to be

30:17.440 --> 30:24.560
 more variables on the day than you are able to account for. So at a certain degree, you have to

30:24.560 --> 30:28.400
 kind of find yourself in a position where I'm going to make sure I take care of the big ones,

30:28.400 --> 30:33.200
 or the ones that are like, obviously, I need to be ready for like, my fueling strategy, my hydration

30:33.200 --> 30:38.560
 strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put me in a position to physiologically

30:38.560 --> 30:43.840
 have this process go as well as possible? How am I going to like, you know, hold myself accountable

30:43.840 --> 30:49.840
 in aid station transition, so I'm not like having a ton of non moving time versus moving time and

30:49.840 --> 30:54.240
 things like that. So there's these like, big variables that you're aware of, and you're trying

30:54.240 --> 30:58.960
 to optimize over the space of variables. Yep. So you get to start to play with that. When you're

30:58.960 --> 31:03.520
 looking for performance, it's almost like moving from checkers to chess, right? You have like, or

31:03.520 --> 31:08.720
 maybe even like connect for something like that, where it goes from just kind of like, well, one

31:08.720 --> 31:12.000
 foot in front of the other, and when I get to the next station, I'll just eat whatever looks good,

31:12.000 --> 31:16.560
 drink whatever, you know, quenches my thirst, and then move on to the next one to like, well,

31:16.560 --> 31:19.760
 which one of these food products is actually going to make me move a little faster to the next

31:19.760 --> 31:24.320
 aid station? Or, you know, which one of these pacing strategies is going to get me to the

31:24.320 --> 31:30.800
 finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff. So it gets more complicated,

31:30.800 --> 31:35.680
 more interesting, and in my opinion, anyway, also, there's I mean, but there's a breaking point with

31:35.680 --> 31:40.880
 that too, because, like I said, there's an endless number of variables you could account for. And

31:40.880 --> 31:45.600
 there's a distance gets longer, that list gets longer too. So you find yourself in this position

31:45.600 --> 31:50.080
 where, where you have to at some point say, okay, I've accounted for everything I can reasonably

31:50.080 --> 31:54.720
 account for. Now I need to be in a mental space where when something happens that I wasn't able

31:54.720 --> 32:00.240
 to account for, I'm able to respond to it with the right decision and keep going and not dwell on it.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.120
 Because that's another thing. I mean, you're running slow enough when you're doing 100 miles,

32:03.120 --> 32:08.560
 where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate on that mistake and say, why did I do

32:08.560 --> 32:12.320
 that? That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah. When in reality, what you need to do is that

32:12.320 --> 32:16.160
 happened. Everyone else out here is gonna have a situation like that at some point. Mine happened

32:16.160 --> 32:22.640
 now. I need to figure out how I can move forward at the fastest sustainable pace and not think about

32:22.640 --> 32:28.320
 what happened back there. And that's where I think it gets really interesting. What would you say it

32:28.320 --> 32:34.720
 takes to set a world record in the 100 miler? First of all, I think you probably have to focus on that

32:34.720 --> 32:40.480
 specific event. I mean, there's the interesting thing about ultra running where it maybe deviates

32:40.480 --> 32:45.280
 a bit from just other endurance sports is there's such a wide range. I mean, we talked about a little

32:45.280 --> 32:50.240
 bit when I talked about the San Diego 100 versus kind of flat runnable stuff. So can you maybe

32:50.240 --> 32:54.720
 paint a picture of what are there's a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events?

32:55.280 --> 33:00.960
 What are like, the big ones in your mind? So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon.

33:01.520 --> 33:07.360
 There's 50k, what are different kinds of there's 100 mile that in your mind, like kind of these

33:07.360 --> 33:13.840
 islands where, where people gather off? Yep. Yeah. So there's a few that really stand out. I would

33:13.840 --> 33:18.240
 say the three biggest ultra marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a

33:18.240 --> 33:23.440
 historical standpoint, but in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100.

33:24.160 --> 33:29.120
 That's the biggest, most competitive 100 miler. It's on the trail side of things in the United

33:29.120 --> 33:33.680
 States. Then there's ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive 100 miler on the

33:33.680 --> 33:37.920
 planet right now. In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail

33:37.920 --> 33:41.600
 Mount Blanc is more competitive. I think in the most recent few years, you're just seeing a lot

33:41.600 --> 33:47.440
 more like of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way.

33:47.440 --> 33:52.080
 And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon,

33:52.080 --> 33:55.440
 which is technically 56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon,

33:56.720 --> 34:01.840
 is going to generally be the most competitive ultra marathon. The weird thing is the distance

34:01.840 --> 34:04.400
 thing, right? Cause most people in the think of endurance sports, they're thinking about

34:04.400 --> 34:08.400
 precise distances, like five kilometers, 10 kilometers and all that stuff. And then,

34:08.400 --> 34:12.000
 then you get into the ultra running world and it's like, sometimes it's the event. So like

34:12.000 --> 34:15.680
 the Western course itself is much more important than the distance, right? Yeah. So the Western

34:15.680 --> 34:20.480
 States 100 is actually 100.2 miles, which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it,

34:20.480 --> 34:24.000
 especially when you figure like tangents are going to probably account for more than 0.2 miles on a

34:24.000 --> 34:29.120
 hundred mile race. But the ultra trail Mount Blanc, you know, that's listed as a hundred

34:29.120 --> 34:34.400
 mile, but it's actually, I think like 104, 105 miles. So, you know, it's more, there's different

34:34.400 --> 34:39.520
 cultures too. So the United States is definitely more motivated, I think, to try to get as close

34:39.520 --> 34:42.400
 to the exact distance. You're going to hear maybe a little more grumbling. If someone says,

34:42.400 --> 34:47.760
 I signed up for this hundred mile and it turned out to be 103 miles versus like over in Europe,

34:47.760 --> 34:50.400
 they don't really care too much about the distance. They're more interested in like a

34:50.400 --> 34:55.440
 specific route or a loop. Is consistency important in terms of the exact length of the,

34:55.440 --> 34:58.800
 of the route? So like you can compare performances from previous years,

34:58.800 --> 35:03.360
 or are they a little bit more flexible? Like they redefine the trail from year to year.

35:03.360 --> 35:08.640
 Yeah. I mean, it's definitely hard to compare. I mean, there's events that take, for example,

35:09.520 --> 35:15.360
 I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men's side is Jim Walmsley.

35:16.080 --> 35:20.400
 The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile

35:20.400 --> 35:25.520
 and not only the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at almost everything up to a hundred

35:25.520 --> 35:31.920
 miles. So there's a race called the Angela's crest hundred miler. They, the trail has drastically

35:31.920 --> 35:36.320
 changed from when they originally had that event and it's a different time of year. So it's much

35:36.320 --> 35:42.720
 warmer on that course. And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like, I can't

35:42.720 --> 35:46.240
 chase that record. But I think Angela crest, when he looks at the segments and the pacing for that

35:46.240 --> 35:51.120
 one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore. So you have that, you have

35:51.120 --> 35:55.360
 some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like preserved, I guess you

35:55.360 --> 35:59.600
 would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side. I mean, comrades is going to be very

35:59.600 --> 36:03.440
 comparable from one year to the next because that's a road race. And that's where you get,

36:03.440 --> 36:07.600
 you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want that kind of like,

36:07.600 --> 36:14.240
 I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like someone who just says,

36:14.240 --> 36:19.920
 I want to be competitive today. And you know, maybe the weather is going to be 30 degrees

36:19.920 --> 36:23.040
 different from one year to the next on this course. But if I beat everyone on this day,

36:23.040 --> 36:26.640
 then I'm the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Montblanc or Western States,

36:26.640 --> 36:31.200
 100. And my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race. And it doesn't matter when

36:31.200 --> 36:35.280
 or how the course was or what the time even was to some degree. When you were optimizing

36:35.280 --> 36:43.760
 for trying to set the world record in the hundred miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like

36:43.760 --> 36:49.600
 what were the variables you were looking at? Is it more in the realm of the actual race day,

36:49.600 --> 36:56.000
 the track, what it looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the,

36:56.480 --> 37:01.200
 to the race? I mean, it evolved a bit. Like, I think the, as I learned more about just like,

37:01.200 --> 37:07.280
 what is required to kind of really do that stuff. So there's some variables you can control for,

37:07.280 --> 37:11.360
 you know, I try to control for as many as I can. The big one that kind of stands out that you can't

37:11.360 --> 37:15.920
 necessarily control for is it's pretty rare where you get an event where they're just doing a hundred

37:15.920 --> 37:21.440
 miles on a track. It's usually like a, like an event of like a series of different events where

37:21.440 --> 37:26.080
 they might be like some people out there doing 50 K, some people out there doing 24 or something

37:26.080 --> 37:28.800
 like the event I did at, there was six day folks out there. They're trying to see how far they

37:28.800 --> 37:34.320
 could get in six days. So you have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the

37:34.320 --> 37:41.760
 distance. So, you know, track protocol is always like you pass on the outside. So if you're running

37:41.760 --> 37:47.520
 one of the faster paces of the day, which when you go on up to six days, you're going to, and you're

37:47.520 --> 37:50.480
 doing a hundred miles, you're probably going to be running faster than most people out there.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.480
 Then, you know, you just end up running more because you end up running in lane two around

37:54.480 --> 37:57.840
 the turns and then sometimes lane three around the turns. So it's down to those little details

37:57.840 --> 38:01.920
 that have a big impact. Yep. So I had to build that into my pacing strategy. I also have to build

38:01.920 --> 38:08.320
 into the pacing strategy, like relative nonmoving time. You know, I did a race just recently,

38:08.320 --> 38:13.120
 it was the US track and field hundred mile road championships. And I did not stop once other than

38:13.120 --> 38:17.680
 like, I guess I technically stopped like in the aid station for like a few seconds to like grab

38:17.680 --> 38:23.200
 bottles and get myself wet. Cause it was like 94 degrees that day, but I didn't like stop at all

38:23.200 --> 38:28.640
 during that race from like what I would say is like a long period of time where we're getting

38:28.640 --> 38:33.680
 up to like a minute, but that's pretty rare. Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19

38:33.680 --> 38:38.880
 minutes, I think I stopped three times for maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for

38:38.880 --> 38:41.600
 sure, but I think it was like three to four minutes or something like that. So you got to,

38:41.600 --> 38:45.920
 you got to figure that into your pacing strategy, especially if you're chasing a specific time.

38:46.480 --> 38:51.760
 Cause you know, if I'm pacing for, you know, at the time the world record was 1128. So if I'm

38:51.760 --> 38:58.320
 pacing for say 1127, 30 or something like that, and I don't account for that three minutes of

38:58.320 --> 39:02.320
 stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had planned on, but then I'm a minute off of the world

39:02.320 --> 39:07.840
 record. So 1128, we're talking about 11 hours, we're talking about a hundred miles. Can you

39:07.840 --> 39:14.000
 mention what the world record was? What kind of world record you set? Can you tell your own story

39:14.000 --> 39:18.800
 here of what you were able to accomplish that world record that I broke actually just recently

39:18.800 --> 39:28.080
 got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania, Alex Sorkin, phenomenal race. I mean, he's won the 24

39:28.080 --> 39:32.480
 hour world championships. He's won the Spartathlon, which is another big historic ultra marathon

39:32.480 --> 39:35.760
 rates, 153 miles. So it's getting a little more lengthy than some of the stuff that I've

39:35.760 --> 39:44.080
 traditionally done. He ran 1114, I believe it was 56 or 57. So his pace was 645 per mile. Mine was

39:44.080 --> 39:49.680
 647 and a half in terms of just like the pacing strategy. I mean, it's, it's just really cool

39:49.680 --> 39:58.320
 because for me, the motivation with chasing the world record was, it was multifaceted. I think

39:58.320 --> 40:02.480
 there was, as I kind of moved through, cause I mean, it took me almost six years from the day

40:02.480 --> 40:09.760
 I decided I wanted to chase that time to the day I actually did it. And through that five to six

40:09.760 --> 40:16.080
 years, I think I merged from just like my number one goal was to try to break the world record to

40:16.080 --> 40:22.160
 my number one goal is how fast can I run this thing? And then ultimately what needs to be done

40:22.160 --> 40:25.760
 for a human to break 11 hours in a hundred miles. Cause I think that's going to be, I think that's

40:25.760 --> 40:30.560
 going to happen soon. I think it's going to happen in the next few years. What pace would that be?

40:31.360 --> 40:37.280
 Sub 11 would be, I think like, I think it's like 635 right about per mile. You're moving quick,

40:37.280 --> 40:43.120
 but not so quick that like you're, you're, you know, void of being able to think about everything

40:43.120 --> 40:50.320
 as it's happening. So what's the pace in terms of, if you look for each of the one mile segments for

40:50.320 --> 40:57.040
 the hundred miles, is it pretty steady six, like in order to break 11 hours, would it be pretty

40:57.040 --> 41:03.920
 steady 635? Does it go up and down? Do you speed up at the very end? Like what's, what's the pacing?

41:03.920 --> 41:09.200
 If you were to maybe how much variability is there in the pacing for an optimal performance here?

41:09.200 --> 41:12.240
 Yeah. So if you're talking about someone, let's say that there was someone, well,

41:12.240 --> 41:16.720
 let's just take me for example, let's say that we could just like, we had this infinite knowledge

41:16.720 --> 41:21.920
 and we knew for a fact, a perfect performance for me would produce a 10 59, but I'm not going

41:21.920 --> 41:29.280
 a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 10 59. Uh, I would definitely

41:29.280 --> 41:36.400
 want to either have a slight negative or slight positive split. So when, um, and I think there's,

41:36.400 --> 41:41.680
 I think there's a, there's a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half

41:41.680 --> 41:47.280
 and the second half isn't going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower

41:47.280 --> 41:52.000
 the first half and a little bit faster. The second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome.

41:52.560 --> 41:55.920
 So that's what you're referring to. The split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and

41:55.920 --> 42:00.160
 the second 50 miles. And you can break it down as tiny as you want. Like I think, uh,

42:00.160 --> 42:03.680
 when you take out the outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that

42:03.680 --> 42:08.720
 like three to four minute nonmoving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight.

42:08.720 --> 42:13.840
 Um, I had a couple that were, um, it was weird cause that, that track that I did that on was

42:13.840 --> 42:19.920
 actually like 400 and some weird number, like 400 and like 38 meters or something like that. So I

42:19.920 --> 42:24.720
 actually like ran like my numbers based on that. So they're there normally I'm dealing with 400

42:24.720 --> 42:29.120
 meters and then it's a little more like clean as to like what my lap splits are going to range from

42:29.120 --> 42:32.880
 one event to the next. So we're talking about running a hundred miles on a track. Yeah.

42:32.880 --> 42:40.160
 And so that you can be really scientific about getting the, the, this, the, um, the pacing,

42:40.160 --> 42:45.280
 right. And, uh, you're, you're running on the inside lane or is there some kind of tricks to

42:45.280 --> 42:51.920
 this? Like, are you alternating directions? Yeah. They'll switch directions at most events every

42:51.920 --> 42:57.920
 four hours. So you'll do four hours one way and then they usually put a cone out. And once it hits

42:57.920 --> 43:02.880
 like, like, let's say it hits four hours, you finish the lap you're on and then you do a loop

43:02.880 --> 43:06.960
 around and then you start the next, your next lap. Would you say you take the exact same number of

43:06.960 --> 43:12.880
 steps? Like when you're really in the groove, when you take in the pacing, are we talking about that

43:12.880 --> 43:18.080
 level of precision or is it a little bit more feel? You mean like foot strike frequency? Yeah.

43:18.080 --> 43:23.920
 Like frequency then over the distance to the lap. Would you say it's so precise that you're like,

43:23.920 --> 43:28.480
 you get in this groove where it's like, gosh, you're making me wish I would have strapped more

43:28.480 --> 43:34.160
 like a foot pod to my head. But like, yeah, so I think like my guess is it's pretty precise.

43:34.160 --> 43:37.760
 Like is there a video of this? Sorry. I keep interrupting. Is there a video of this? Cause

43:37.760 --> 43:44.400
 I, I've actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts

43:44.400 --> 43:50.720
 foot strikes. Oh, really? Yeah. For fun. Yeah. I was trying to understand, uh, we'll talk about

43:50.720 --> 43:55.760
 this later. We have the same definition of fun when I got my, find myself on a track for all day

43:55.760 --> 44:00.800
 and you find yourself counting foot strikes. I was trying to understand if, if there's how much

44:00.800 --> 44:08.160
 variability there's in a extreme, like elite performers within a particular race, but also

44:08.160 --> 44:14.960
 across races. It was just interesting to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much variability

44:14.960 --> 44:20.560
 there is in the human body and in the way they use legs to move quickly. I think my guess would be

44:21.120 --> 44:25.760
 that at the individual level, it's going to be pretty precise, assuming the pacing

44:25.760 --> 44:32.560
 is consistent. So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles

44:32.560 --> 44:36.640
 than I did the first 50 miles. So my splits were very even most of the day. I actually ran some of

44:36.640 --> 44:42.320
 my fastest miles at the end. Uh, so there's going to be probably a slight variance from my fastest

44:42.320 --> 44:47.760
 miles to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike. Uh, but probably not by a huge

44:47.760 --> 44:52.560
 margin, but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next. So you get someone

44:52.560 --> 44:57.920
 whose gate is just a little bit different. So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down

44:57.920 --> 45:02.560
 on the outside of my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid forefoot striker. So that's going to kind of

45:02.560 --> 45:09.280
 impact my cadence to a degree. Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to rear their

45:09.280 --> 45:13.840
 foot or heel striker and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in. Uh, so that person

45:13.840 --> 45:18.400
 may have a little bit of a different cadence as well. So you get someone, and I think you see this

45:18.400 --> 45:23.280
 in elite marathoning too, which is going to probably just be a much larger data pool, uh,

45:23.280 --> 45:29.200
 much, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this.

45:29.200 --> 45:34.080
 And I think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but,

45:34.080 --> 45:38.960
 you know, to the degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from

45:38.960 --> 45:43.280
 one person to the next. But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is

45:43.280 --> 45:46.320
 going to be. The slower they go, the lower their cadence is going to be, but there's going to be

45:46.320 --> 45:54.000
 probably a range of optimal lowness and I don't know, probably optimal highness too than that.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.440
 If you can just linger on the 11 hours, the person, first of all, would you like to be the

45:59.440 --> 46:05.440
 person that breaks 11 hours? And second of all, the person that does break 11 hours, like what would,

46:05.440 --> 46:10.800
 what would it take? And third question is, is it even possible in your intuition?

46:10.800 --> 46:15.120
 Yeah. I mean, I would def I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want to be the first person

46:15.120 --> 46:20.720
 to break 11 hours and a hundred miles. I think that'll be, um, would be a cool like barrier to

46:20.720 --> 46:26.400
 be the one to usher that in. But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing it done

46:27.280 --> 46:33.680
 from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that

46:33.680 --> 46:37.600
 is inevitable that it's going to get broken. So, I mean, we were talking about happiness before

46:37.600 --> 46:43.280
 this, right? So I've contemplated this in the past, um, where I was thinking to myself, like,

46:44.080 --> 46:49.040
 uh, if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record

46:49.600 --> 46:55.920
 and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do

46:56.640 --> 47:01.760
 an assessment of what I'm kind of where my mind is at and where my focus is at.

47:01.760 --> 47:09.120
 Uh, and just reflect on how I'm behaving in life because it's going to get broken, right? I mean,

47:09.120 --> 47:16.800
 I could run 10 50 tomorrow and in 10 years, chances are that's no longer going to be my

47:16.800 --> 47:22.400
 world record anymore. Someone's going to run faster than that. So if you're living to hold

47:22.400 --> 47:28.080
 on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward, which anytime you break a world

47:28.080 --> 47:32.800
 record, you're moving the sport forward, then, then you have to look at that as like, that was

47:32.800 --> 47:39.440
 my contribution. And whether I contribute again or not is kind of besides the point. What you want

47:39.440 --> 47:44.400
 is that your performance, your contribution brings new people into the sport who are excited,

47:44.400 --> 47:49.280
 motivated, and they can make their contribution. And then we can ultimately see, well, how fast

47:49.280 --> 47:53.520
 can someone run a controlled environment, a hundred miler. And that's what I really want to

47:53.520 --> 47:57.920
 see. Uh, cause I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport. I mean, I've gotten so much

47:57.920 --> 48:02.400
 enjoyment from the sport. I've been able to turn it into a career. And I think there's, there's

48:02.400 --> 48:06.320
 other people who can do the same thing and it's not necessarily going to come at the expense of

48:06.320 --> 48:10.640
 my career. Uh, but it's going to bring more attention to the sport. It's going to bring more

48:10.640 --> 48:13.360
 interest in the sport. It's going to open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have

48:13.360 --> 48:19.840
 never thought about it, seen it, considered it. And to me, I think that's like a much more rewarding

48:19.840 --> 48:25.680
 goal than saying I want to break this record and I want to hold it for decades or I want to die

48:25.680 --> 48:29.760
 with this record. So I never have to see someone go faster than me. Well, that's the progress of

48:29.760 --> 48:34.080
 human civilization was down on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff. Well,

48:34.080 --> 48:38.400
 and it's, it's the other thing is just like, if you're honest with yourself too, it's, uh, I mean,

48:38.400 --> 48:42.080
 we're seeing this right now in the running world where, you know, new innovations come in, new

48:42.080 --> 48:47.360
 technologies come in, new nutritional approaches come in. And then we see like the new crop of

48:47.360 --> 48:51.680
 folks have advantages that the old crop didn't have. And it can be easy to look back on that and

48:51.680 --> 48:56.560
 say like, Hey, well, um, you know, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that,

48:56.560 --> 49:00.560
 I would have run this. But then you're getting into that negative, you know, thought process again,

49:00.560 --> 49:05.920
 which I generally try to stay off of. It's like the caveman. If I had fire, I would have done

49:05.920 --> 49:10.000
 right. But with this, look at these idiots up there with their cars. If I would have had a car

49:10.000 --> 49:18.240
 back then, I would have been ruled the world. Um, let me just zoom up briefly and ask you about

49:18.240 --> 49:24.960
 kind of beauty and love. What's the most beautiful thing about running to you? Why do you love it?

49:24.960 --> 49:29.680
 I think, uh, there's kind of a couple of directions to look at it through our lenses,

49:29.680 --> 49:32.800
 look at it through. There's like the, in the moment, right? There's always going to be that

49:32.800 --> 49:38.480
 run where, uh, you're clicking along and things just feel great. You get some endorphins and you

49:38.480 --> 49:42.640
 get the, the, you know, the, the quote unquote runner's high and that sort of stuff. And that's

49:42.640 --> 49:47.120
 like just like this great feeling that you can kind of tap into on the like the real, like,

49:47.920 --> 49:53.040
 like in the moment type of level. Uh, you know, you've, my wife and I talk about this because

49:53.040 --> 49:58.560
 she's a competitive ultra runner as well. And, um, you will, you'll, we'll have a day where,

49:58.560 --> 50:02.880
 you know, we'll take a forced day off or something like that. And it's necessary, right? It's going to

50:02.880 --> 50:08.480
 allow the enjoyment to continue. But you get into this like routine of, I wake up in the morning,

50:08.480 --> 50:12.880
 I do this run and that kind of gets my day started. That gets my energies up. I get that

50:12.880 --> 50:17.360
 runner's high afterwards. You remove that from the equation for a rest day. And you just start

50:17.360 --> 50:21.440
 like, oh man, I don't feel like I never got started today. Like, you know, it's just this

50:21.440 --> 50:25.840
 weird thing. It's almost, I think it's, it's funny because non runners don't always like

50:26.480 --> 50:29.280
 necessarily recognize it because for them it's the complete opposite. They're like,

50:29.280 --> 50:35.040
 if I can get away from not having to run today, that's going to be a good day versus. But it's

50:35.040 --> 50:38.880
 one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it. So, uh, so that's

50:38.880 --> 50:44.160
 purely from the running perspective. There's this joy of, uh, of the runner's high of the post after

50:44.160 --> 50:48.240
 the run. You feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing. Yes. And I think that's one

50:48.240 --> 50:53.600
 of the drivers from just the quality of life standpoint. Uh, just, uh, you know, and in the

50:53.600 --> 50:57.760
 moment, immediate gratification, uh, standpoint. But then there's like, I think the bigger picture

50:57.760 --> 51:05.600
 stuff or the longer term stuff. And for me, that enjoyment is like just the process like of, uh,

51:05.600 --> 51:11.600
 okay, I'm starting at this fitness level and I'm going to do these workouts and by doing these

51:11.600 --> 51:15.600
 workouts, I'm going to see incremental progress from them. And then that's another kind of like,

51:15.600 --> 51:19.440
 kind of short term gratification. That's maybe a little longer than the day to day, but,

51:19.440 --> 51:24.880
 um, still like shorter than like a career or a, or a buildup for a particular race

51:24.880 --> 51:28.480
 where you're saying you're seeing yourself like, okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals right

51:28.480 --> 51:34.400
 now. And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four, I'm covering

51:34.400 --> 51:39.440
 this much distance and you can just see that progress is almost like, uh, in elementary

51:39.440 --> 51:42.880
 school when you get the gold star for reading a book, it's like, did that gold star really mean

51:42.880 --> 51:48.160
 anything? I don't know, but I felt great when they gave it to me. There's something about just

51:48.160 --> 51:53.360
 finding improvement and people love to see improvement, I think. So that's where, uh,

51:53.360 --> 51:56.800
 I think you can also get some value in it saying like I started here and I got there.

51:57.440 --> 52:02.960
 Um, and then I think there's also just like, uh, I would call this maybe more the cherry on top,

52:02.960 --> 52:07.440
 which is like where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's going to be kind

52:07.440 --> 52:13.440
 of the thing that kind of like, uh, shows up on the end result and where it kind of identifies

52:13.440 --> 52:18.080
 whether you did things right or wrong. Yeah. So there's a sense which, in which training is a kind

52:18.080 --> 52:25.840
 of, uh, preparation towards race day and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist.

52:25.840 --> 52:31.440
 You get to create this, this piece of art and they might suck, it might be beautiful. Uh, I mean,

52:31.440 --> 52:36.400
 I, I, I see in the grappling world, I see competition in that same way when I feel the best

52:36.400 --> 52:43.040
 about it, which is like, sounds pretentious to say, but like, I'm trying to be the best version of

52:43.040 --> 52:51.280
 myself in this particular day of competition and to do something that I'll be proud of in, in, uh,

52:51.280 --> 52:58.560
 in an artist way, not in a kind of some kind of numerical way, but like as a holistic sense, like

52:59.120 --> 53:03.920
 do something cool. Like in grappling, that means for me, that means like not stalling,

53:04.720 --> 53:10.880
 like taking big risks and trying to dominate another person in the, in the context of grappling

53:10.880 --> 53:18.320
 and, and do it, like push myself to the limit, both cardio wise and technique wise, and just play,

53:18.320 --> 53:22.480
 play beautifully. I mean, you see this in kind of chess, there's systematic chess players and

53:22.480 --> 53:28.000
 there's people that allow themselves to have those moments of genius where they take the big risk

53:28.000 --> 53:34.000
 that eventually pays off or doesn't. And that to me is art that, I mean, there's art within running,

53:34.000 --> 53:38.400
 there's art within chess, there's art within grappling. And you got a chance, like all the

53:38.400 --> 53:44.640
 training is more like science. And then it feels like the competition days art. Yeah. I think that

53:44.640 --> 53:49.280
 that that's a really cool, cool way to look at. And I think it's when you really open up the

53:49.280 --> 53:53.840
 perspective of that too, it's like even, uh, obviously, you know, having a great day,

53:53.840 --> 53:57.120
 like winning the tournament or, you know, getting further than you were expected to,

53:57.120 --> 54:00.960
 or beating someone who you've never beaten before or something like that. Uh, or in the running

54:00.960 --> 54:05.680
 perspective, like achieving that goal time, uh, that sort of stuff. Obviously those are kind of

54:05.680 --> 54:09.520
 like the ones you, if, when you're honest with yourself, you really want, and you're going to

54:09.520 --> 54:13.840
 probably get the most satisfaction out of, but even when they don't go wrong, like maybe like

54:13.840 --> 54:19.200
 with your grappling tournament, uh, analogy, the, you know, maybe the guy you're grappling against

54:19.200 --> 54:23.360
 does a move on you and you're like, I was not prepared for that move. So now the enjoyment

54:23.360 --> 54:28.720
 becomes, okay, back to the drawing board. Now I need to find out what do I do when that happens

54:28.720 --> 54:33.280
 to me next time. And that's where the, I think the why comes in again, same thing with running.

54:33.280 --> 54:39.200
 Like maybe I make a mistake and, you know, like eat something I didn't really want to eat or,

54:39.200 --> 54:43.280
 or thought was going to work, but didn't work. And it costs me more time than I gained by having it

54:43.280 --> 54:45.760
 or something like that. And then I go back to the drawing board and say, okay, well,

54:46.640 --> 54:50.480
 I can't do that. That didn't work. Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to

54:50.480 --> 54:56.800
 be able to do it. And I love that part of the sport. Um, just the rearranging of things and

54:56.800 --> 55:01.280
 adjusting and tinkering. There's some sense in which the mistakes and like the flaws give us

55:01.280 --> 55:07.920
 meaning. Cause like if, if everything, um, if you weren't able to find mistakes and something you've

55:07.920 --> 55:15.920
 done, it feels like the life would be void of meaning. It's a lost opportunity too. Like if,

55:15.920 --> 55:24.240
 I mean, like when I look at even my a hundred mile race of 11, 19, I can find spots in there

55:24.240 --> 55:27.680
 where I was like, Oh, you know what? I could clean that up a little bit. Maybe if I do this

55:27.680 --> 55:33.840
 differently. And I mean, that's going to get me, you know, a little bit faster. If I sat back and

55:33.840 --> 55:37.920
 said, Hey, well things went great that day. Cool. Let's see if we can replicate it. Then, you know,

55:37.920 --> 55:45.280
 I probably run 11, 19 again. So can we talk about training a little bit? What does your training

55:45.280 --> 55:53.520
 look like year round day to day, hour to hour, like optimal? Maybe, uh, maybe you want to pick a

55:53.520 --> 55:58.080
 race in the context of what you want to discuss that, but, and also people should follow you on

55:58.080 --> 56:05.760
 Instagram. You have a lot of kind of interesting, um, like little glances into your training process

56:05.760 --> 56:10.560
 and into your training thinking, which is quite fascinating. But if you look at an optimal training

56:10.560 --> 56:15.840
 process, what does that look like? Yeah. So I think, uh, the, if we were looking at it from

56:15.840 --> 56:20.240
 like a philosophical level or like an approach level, I think there's some things that carry over

56:20.240 --> 56:27.760
 from regardless of the distance. So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least

56:27.760 --> 56:32.960
 specific to what you're going to do on race day, but are still going to be important things in

56:32.960 --> 56:39.440
 terms of improving your ability to perform on race day or maximizing your potential, uh,

56:39.440 --> 56:46.240
 with the things that are specific you do first. I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance

56:46.240 --> 56:49.600
 sport. I think maybe even more specifically with things like our ultra marathons or a hundred

56:49.600 --> 56:56.720
 miles where you want a really strong aerobic foundation or like a base before you really start,

56:56.720 --> 57:03.200
 I think, structuring things towards a specific one. So for me, I think like a target for me is

57:03.200 --> 57:10.480
 oftentimes like, uh, you know, getting really fit at like what my pace would be at like my aerobic

57:10.480 --> 57:14.720
 threshold or what a lot of people may be called like a maximum aerobic function. Um, I mean,

57:14.720 --> 57:17.440
 the running world is kind of weird where we have like these terminologies where there's

57:17.440 --> 57:21.360
 sometimes multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from like, uh,

57:21.360 --> 57:25.840
 just an actual physiological reaction and one is just like a feeling and stuff like that. So

57:25.840 --> 57:33.120
 you mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state. Like how important is it just

57:33.120 --> 57:40.160
 to get like running done versus like running in a particular pace that would depend on the event.

57:40.160 --> 57:46.320
 I would say to a degree and there's contradicting ideas about like kind of how to structure it. I

57:46.320 --> 57:52.160
 think a lot of times like, uh, you do want to like time on feet in most cases is just going to be

57:52.160 --> 57:56.320
 like I'm running easy, whatever feels easy that day. And that can be different from one day to

57:56.320 --> 58:01.440
 the next. Like I might feel great and you know, that produces a much faster pace than if I feel

58:01.440 --> 58:06.480
 really miserable or something like that. Um, so that's why I think a lot of times running,

58:06.480 --> 58:10.560
 well they'll, they'll do the whole perceived, perceived effort or perceived exertion.

58:10.560 --> 58:18.480
 And there you're looking at kind of understanding the response your body has to a certain effort

58:18.480 --> 58:22.080
 level and you're supposed to target a certain effort level in order to like get a certain

58:22.080 --> 58:27.920
 response. So to maybe simplify that a little bit or make it a little clearer, like I think I focus

58:27.920 --> 58:35.840
 on essentially like short intervals. I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs. Uh, I focus on,

58:35.840 --> 58:42.240
 um, like race pace intensity, which is a lot of times what I'll build my long run around. Um,

58:42.240 --> 58:46.640
 but I'll also like, those are kind of like the small pieces to the puzzle. Those are the options

58:46.640 --> 58:51.520
 you're working with. Yeah, but I'm going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive

58:51.520 --> 58:55.440
 aerobic base, which is going to probably be like 80% of the work. So how do you build that massive

58:55.440 --> 59:00.560
 aerobic base? What are we talking about? Just distance? Distance and essentially, so I like

59:00.560 --> 59:03.440
 to call it microstressing because you're going to always start at a different spot depending

59:03.440 --> 59:07.200
 on where your fitness level is at and depending on where you're at as an individual. I'm going

59:07.200 --> 59:11.600
 to be targeting my aerobic threshold. I'm going to get right up to it, but not necessarily cross

59:11.600 --> 59:16.560
 over it. Um, it's, it, you know, it's, it's been popularized as maximum aerobic function as kind

59:16.560 --> 59:22.400
 of a training philosophy. That philosophy in itself, I think maybe is a little more like

59:22.400 --> 59:28.240
 holistic where they're saying, do this basically all the time. And by doing so, you're going to,

59:28.240 --> 59:34.000
 like, you're going to raise your aerobic potential by so much that, you know, you can kind of like

59:34.000 --> 59:37.840
 race yourself into shape at that point. And this would be maybe more specific for like shorter

59:37.840 --> 59:41.360
 distance or endurance runs where you're not going to really race yourself in the shape of a hundred

59:41.360 --> 59:46.560
 milers. But for five Ks, you might, you might do like a huge base building phase where you're going

59:46.560 --> 59:53.760
 up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic threshold and you're watching your pace come down

59:53.760 --> 59:58.800
 at that. So the rule there is basically like if you're seeing improvement, that's the sign

59:58.800 --> 1:00:02.400
 you're looking for, or which would just be your pace dropping at that heart rate or at that

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:06.720
 intensity. And, uh, if you're seeing that continually go down, you're heading in the

1:00:06.720 --> 1:00:11.520
 right direction. If you start seeing it go the opposite way, you're, you're probably overreaching

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:15.360
 where you're trying to do too much of it. So that's kind of dictates how much the dose,

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:19.520
 I guess you'd say, when we talk about max aerobic function, we're talking about heart rate as the

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:24.240
 ultimate, as the really important metric here. So maintaining a particular heart rate during the run.

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:29.200
 Uh, is that the measure that, like, how do you know you're in the right place? Yeah. Yeah. And

1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:32.800
 then that's where it gets a little tricky because like, unless you go into a lab and get your aerobic

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.600
 threshold tested, it's really hard to have like an exact number on it. Um, you know, Dr. Phil

1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:42.640
 Maffetone with the maximum function process, he'll say 180 minus your age is going to give you your.

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:47.200
 Yeah. That's the MAF 180 formula that I thought was fascinating for, it's like, uh, in the same

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:52.480
 way E equals E equals MC squared is fascinating that there could be a formula that captures like

1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:59.200
 optimal running. So that for people who don't know that's 180 minus your age, if you train at that

1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.720
 heart rate, if you run at that heart rate, you're going to progress a lot. And here's the advantage

1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:07.360
 of that. I think like with any of these things, you want to look at it through where are the

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:11.440
 advantages here and I need to account for those. And then where are the potential disadvantages

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.320
 and then decide for me as an individual, do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:20.080
 on what's the alternative approach and is that going to produce more advantages or less?

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:26.160
 So with, with maximum function, uh, here's some advantages. Like it is low enough intensity

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:33.360
 where you can train pretty consistently at a fairly high volume with a very low injury risk

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:38.640
 with a very low, like things that are going to maybe lower your quality of life, like muscle

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:43.280
 damage and things like that. Um, it's a more efficient way in the sense that you're going to

1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:48.160
 be like prioritizing like fat metabolization, which, um, I mean, if you're looking at like

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:53.360
 Jeff Follick and Dr. Jeff Follick and Dr. Dominic DiAgostino, some of their research and things like

1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:57.360
 that, like they're going to show that, you know, that's going to be a little cleaner way to go

1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:02.240
 about things from just a recovery standpoint, a breakdown standpoint. So they could be like a,

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:08.720
 what they call like a fat adapted athlete. So you can go to your fat stores for energy if you're

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:14.800
 applying this math. What is it called by the way? Math 180. Is that a good, what are your thoughts

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:21.760
 about in general for yourself and for the broader population? I think the math 180 formula is about

1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:27.120
 as good of a formula as you're going to find in terms of capturing as many people as you can get

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:31.280
 away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing. Uh, like any of these things, I mean,

1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:37.520
 it's, it's more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of that 180 minus their age

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.200
 is probably going to be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of figure out where that is.

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:46.640
 There's some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it that I like to do. If I'm,

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:50.480
 let's say I just, I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running and it was like,

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:56.640
 I'm running along and I'm just like, my, my breathing is labored. I'm, you know, I'm struggling

1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:01.360
 to get a sentence out without gasping for breath. Well, that's my body telling me I'm probably not

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:06.960
 actually at my true like math number or my true, like underneath my true aerobic threshold, like

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.320
 aerobic threshold and maximum function, you should be able to do that for hours and you should be

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:15.600
 able to breathe pretty efficiently and talk. Yep. Carry a conversation. Um, other people will say,

1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:19.600
 like you, another way to kind of gauge it, if you can breathe in your nose and out your mouth,

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.760
 that's not necessarily the best way to do on a, from a performance standpoint, but it can be a

1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:28.480
 good kind of governor that will allow you to, like, if you can, if you can no longer breathe

1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:31.760
 in your nose and out your mouth, you're probably going too fast to actually technically be at your

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:36.960
 math pace or under your math pace. Yeah. I had, uh, actually when I was in, in better shape,

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:43.920
 I had trouble getting to that math number. I found myself like that I would be doing way too much

1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:49.280
 work. Like it was too hard to do. It was too hard to get to that number. I was running a much lower

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:55.920
 heart rate, like 10 to 20, what do you call that beats lower. And that's, I was still for myself,

1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:01.040
 happy with the pace. It was a good pace and, and I was, felt good. I was smiling and enjoying life

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:07.840
 and, uh, I did. And the moment I take myself to that, uh, level of like the, the math 180 level,

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:13.600
 that's like, that felt like a real workout. Yeah. And it felt like I can't do that for five, 10,

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.240
 15 miles. Like I, I started feeling it like this is a one or two mile thing.

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:26.320
 No, but I think his answer to that, uh, Phil Meftone's answer is maybe you're supposed to like,

1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:32.000
 uh, what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that, or build up your, maybe like I'm too

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.520
 weak. Yeah. Musculature wise to like, uh, yeah, like that, that's a sign that you need to work

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:40.720
 on some stuff. You can't just keep enjoying life. There's, there's two ways to look at that,

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:45.840
 I think. And I think you're, you're, you're right on. I think that what the advice from that, from

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:52.080
 that kind of a process would say is either you, you're doing too much of it. So it's getting too

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:56.800
 hard for where your skeletal muscle system is currently at for that particular activity. So

1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:00.960
 like, it can be different too. Like if you're cycling versus running, you know, that's a little

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:06.240
 bit of different mechanic where it can be different where you could take a super fit cyclist and then

1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:10.480
 put them on, you know, the, the volume, the volume they're going to be able to tolerate relative to

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:14.160
 what you're going to do when you remove like impact forces and things like that is going to be

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:18.000
 lower if they haven't been practicing that activity. So for you, like, you know, you're prioritizing,

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:23.520
 like, uh, uh, wrestling and mixed martial arts or not mixed martial arts, but jujitsu type stuff. So,

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:30.400
 uh, you know, running is maybe kind of that, that, uh, that secondary activity versus the primary

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:35.680
 activity. But yeah, so what they would say is probably like, maybe instead of doing that at,

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:39.680
 let's say you were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:44.880
 too hard to continue there, they'd say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:49.440
 with 20, then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:56.560
 One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not

1:05:56.560 --> 1:06:04.560
 great. Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right. Maybe I was doing too

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:10.080
 big of steps, not so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of, um, the

1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:15.200
 form of your form, the economy, the efficiency. Yeah. So that was, that was the intuition. Like

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:19.040
 I was doing something wrong, but I suppose that's the benefit of these kind of formulas. It

1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:24.160
 challenges you to think like, how can I improve this kind of stuff? Well, and it also, it simplifies

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:29.280
 it so much that you're forced to, right? You're forced to optimize within that real strict

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:35.760
 parameter versus am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong? Or am I doing my

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:39.920
 like long intervals right, but my short intervals, and then you just, it kind of complicates things

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:43.440
 when you start throwing a lot of stuff there. And for most people, especially when they're first

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:48.320
 getting started, you know, you're, you can't overcomplicate it or you're just going to like,

1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:52.640
 you're going to do like a bunch of half right, half wrong things and then not really know where

1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:58.560
 your progress or your deficits are necessarily at. So I do think this is an amazing approach,

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:04.560
 especially for people who are just getting into it and building that, that foundation, um, where,

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:08.160
 where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a little bit, especially when you start getting

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:14.560
 to these events that are operating well outside that intensity. So you take something like, um,

1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:19.120
 you know, let's say it's a race that takes you in the neighborhood of around like 12 minutes or

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:23.120
 something like that, then you're going to be running significantly faster than your, your

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:28.880
 maximum function pace. So most of the research is going to say at some point in time, you need to

1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:33.200
 get around to practicing the pace at which you're going to perform at and really fine tuning the

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:40.160
 mechanics, uh, the efficiencies, uh, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace you're

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.760
 going to try to compete at. So there's obviously like a large range of targets there when we're

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:47.120
 talking about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter events,

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:50.800
 like five kilometers, and then you also have a hundred mile races, which are going to typically

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:54.720
 be quite a bit below your maximum heroic function in, especially on these trail races.

1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:01.280
 I need to admit something. So I don't measure the runs at all in terms of, uh, time, uh,

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:07.360
 because I get competitive with myself. So I kind of decided that running for me is going to be this

1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:13.040
 thing where I just go by feel. Is it possible to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have

1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:17.680
 running as part of your life and be a good performer in running? I actually think that's,

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:22.800
 that's where you want to get to. The problem is most people have a hard time getting to that

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:27.520
 because they'll go out and they'll run with a friend and match their pace. Or they'll go out

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:32.080
 and they'll say, well, I want to run this pace. So they'll target that pace or target a specific

1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:38.240
 heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe feel good doing it. So I think

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:43.280
 like once you, I mean, obviously I think when you put a race on the calendar, if your goal is

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.280
 performance, it's a little harder to just say like, well, I'm going to run whatever feels good today

1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:51.200
 because eventually you have to get around to doing what's specific. But from just a fitness

1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:56.080
 standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint, um, I think it's totally fine to go out and say,

1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:59.120
 I'm going to run what feels good today. And you know, maybe someday you will feel like at

1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:02.000
 the end of the run, I'm going to do a couple of sprints just to get some, you know, that,

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.480
 because it does, that one's a hard one to kind of jumpstart, but once you do it and you realize how

1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:10.160
 kind of good it feels, maybe to throw in a few accelerations at the end of a run. And then you,

1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:13.200
 you say, oh wow, that feels pretty good to do that. I feel a little more accomplished.

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:17.200
 That's right. That's a forcing function, but I like to finish runs with sprints anyway.

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:21.440
 Okay. Because you're already there without, right. You don't need to the timing. I'm afraid

1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:27.120
 of the time becoming a drug, but the flip side of that, it's a useful tool to get you to learn

1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:32.640
 the right form, the right feel, like what it feels like to have to be in good shape.

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:36.320
 And then you can throw out the time. Well, I think too with, with feel running. And what

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:39.520
 I mean by that is that kind of back to that perceived effort thing where like you do enough

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:44.880
 of it and you start being able to recognize, like I can go out and if you said, okay, run,

1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:51.120
 you know, 60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know where that is on my

1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:54.640
 heart rate. And I could go out there and just say like, okay, I know what that feels like and go

1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:59.360
 out and run that feel. And I'm going to hit that spot. Like I bet you if we looked at my heart

1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:02.000
 rate data after that, it'd be right in there. And I wouldn't have to look at some of that's

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:07.920
 just experience. Someone's just understanding like when like noticing the physiological responses,

1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:12.400
 when you cross over versus step a little bit too below it, uh, you can get yourself daydreaming

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:15.920
 and forget. I'll do this sometimes too, where I'll be tart. Cause I'm kind of like you too,

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:20.880
 where when I'm getting really fit, uh, especially with my foundation, like I gotta, you know,

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:25.280
 I'm moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold. So like if I start daydreaming too much, I can

1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:27.760
 notice, Oh, I'm drifting back a little bit. I looked down at my heart rate matter. Oh yeah,

1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:33.040
 I'm 10 beats under, you know, so you do it. It does take a little bit of, I think just awareness.

1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:38.800
 Um, but it's also not necessarily something where you have to be so exact that you're hitting things,

1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:43.200
 you know, an exact heart rate all the time. There's usually a range and there's even like

1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:47.760
 some fluctuations where like if you've been healthy for a year or two without any injuries

1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.680
 and you've been fit that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function.

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:55.440
 If you're using that as kind of your, your target from the 180 minus your age formula.

1:10:55.440 --> 1:11:01.120
 So let's try this, lay this out for yourself, but for others, you, you offer readymade plans

1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:06.720
 for people, you know, depending on their, I think the key thing there is the distance.

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:13.040
 Maybe you can elaborate, but what does that plan look like? Usually what are the key

1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:19.520
 options as you've already kind of mentioned? And how does your week look like? How do a lot of

1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:25.280
 people's week look like in terms of splits? Are we talking about, um, you know, in terms of rest

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:31.840
 days, in terms of how often do you do speed work versus longer distance? You mentioned long runs.

1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:38.480
 Like, is there something you could say that's generally applicable about the, the structure

1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.360
 of these plans? The readymade plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy, um, and it's going to

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:48.560
 be like kind of like lockstep in that. Um, so for those, like there's always going to be a sacrifice

1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:52.880
 when you do like a readymade plan because there's, you're removing the individual context there.

1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:56.320
 So for folks who are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a personalized

1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:59.760
 coaching plan with them where we sit down and we actually look at their strengths, their weaknesses

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:06.800
 and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it. And it also like it avoids

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:12.480
 it avoids a situation where, Oh, my readymade plan says I'm supposed to do this run today,

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:15.760
 but I don't feel great today. So what do I do? I mean, some people are fine with that because

1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:21.120
 they're, they're, they're aware enough of like the process that they can adjust it themselves.

1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:24.880
 Other folks just need a little more support. So, um, that's kind of the difference there,

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:29.040
 but in terms of the structure of it, it kind of goes with an approach where

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:33.440
 ogre saying you build this foundation, you're going to spend, you know, usually anywhere

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:38.000
 between eight to 12 weeks just building up your, your aerobic foundation. You're going to be doing

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.400
 a lot of stuff that are kind of at, I call them base runs, but they're basically your maximum

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.320
 aerobic function or you're up to your aerobic threshold type stuff. And they're really going

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:50.480
 to get really fit with that. And once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it's time to

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:55.120
 get into the specifics of whatever distance they're doing. So if it, where it will differ will

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:59.680
 be like if they're doing a right now on those plans, I think I've got 5k half marathon marathon,

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:05.280
 50k, 80 to a hundred K and then a hundred miles. So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:08.160
 is going to be different than if they pick the a hundred mile plan, you're going to see

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:14.320
 some of the same workouts show up in that plan. It just going to be different areas of it. So once

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:19.840
 they're really fit at that, uh, you know, that foundational level, then, you know, if they're

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:24.080
 doing say a hundred mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals, which I would, on my

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:28.080
 plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes. It's kind of that short interval

1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:33.440
 range. Can you describe what you mean by short interval? It's like a sprint and then a rest.

1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:39.040
 Yeah. Yeah. So I'll use basically like, I'll use like a, basically a 12 minute time trial

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:43.440
 and that's going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going to be

1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:48.480
 for some of those. When they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit. Um, but

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:53.040
 usually when we're up to like above a minute and certainly up to four minutes, like whatever pace

1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:57.040
 or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial, where they're just seeing how

1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:02.560
 far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be, um, kind of like about where they're going to target

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:05.920
 for those intervals. So then those intervals are going to be structured. Let's say we were doing

1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:09.840
 two minute intervals. They're going to do two minutes at that intensity that they could do for

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:14.080
 12 minutes at a time trial. Then they're going to do a two minute real easy jog, or maybe even walk

1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:18.240
 just to kind of bounce back. And they're going to repeat it. How do you figure out how far you can

1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:23.280
 go in 12 minutes? Is that just a trial and error you build up to it? There's formulas with,

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:29.760
 yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less, uh, um, brutal, uh,

1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:34.960
 where you kind of, uh, I haven't really dove into these that that in depth yet. I know like, um,

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:40.640
 that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval and then a slightly

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:45.920
 longer one. Um, and then like another one where like at the end one, that last one will kind of

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:50.560
 indicate what it is. Uh, and so you're doing less of it to get the same answer to the question.

1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:56.240
 But sometimes I think when it's someone who's new, I'd rather them just do a 12 minute time trial

1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:01.680
 because it's easy for them to execute in the sense that it's pretty clear. You do a warm up,

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:06.000
 you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches, and you just run as hard as you can for 12 minutes

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.680
 as evenly paced as you can manage. And, uh, I mean, if the, if it's going to produce the data

1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:17.040
 I'm looking for, uh, and I mean, it's also no matter what happens, they'll produce the data.

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.040
 Yeah. I mean, you can, you can screw it up. I guess you can go way too fast. Then you have this

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:24.480
 scenario where like, Oh, it looks like your, you know, your first two minutes were drastically

1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:28.800
 faster than your last two. And then it's like, Oh, we maybe screwed that one up. But, um,

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:34.160
 but I mean really like you don't even need to do the time trial technically. Um, a lot of times

1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:41.040
 you can go off of feel like what we described with, um, the threshold stuff and, and, you know,

1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:47.280
 it's a high enough intensity where, where like you can start to kind of like your, your body's

1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:51.760
 going to kind of limit you to a degree where, um, if I said we didn't do the time trial and just

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:56.640
 started doing the intervals, we could figure out that, you know, if they're doing them right or

1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:00.320
 not, if we see a scenario where, Oh, it looks like these first two intervals were significantly

1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:05.120
 slower than the last two chances are, we're still not quite dialed in in terms of what the intensity

1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:08.720
 is that you should be targeting for those. And as you do a few of them, you just get to know

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:12.640
 the pacing of it a little better. And then you start seeing more even split. So like, you know,

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:16.240
 their first two minute intervals pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or,

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:19.920
 you know, I guess we'd be looking at distance if we're doing time. So like you went approximately

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.680
 the same distance on that last one as you did the first one. And then we're just looking for

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:29.200
 improvement over time. So, you know, we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:33.680
 that we're going to still include kind of foundational running volume where you're going

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:37.200
 to be running like an easy pace and enjoyable pace kind of in the interim. And then there's going to

1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:41.520
 be some rest days and that's going to be where the levels come in. My like level one plans are

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:45.680
 going to be like four day a week training plans. Level two are going to be five day level three

1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:50.480
 are going to be six day with one day off. Um, and you can obviously operate outside of those,

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:53.520
 those, those are just the ones that I put up for the readymade when I'm coaching people kind of

1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:57.680
 personalized. We just, we look at like what their history is with running their schedule,

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:01.840
 all sorts of stuff. Cause oftentimes people get hung up on like, well, what are the elites doing?

1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:05.280
 What are the professionals doing? What are the Olympians doing? It's like, well, it's like what

1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:08.880
 the Olympians are doing is they're waking up and they're living and breathing everything around

1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:13.520
 this one race that they're going to do in four years. Or so it's like, we need to step away from

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:17.440
 that. If you're working, you know, 10 hours a day and you got kids and all this other stuff too. So,

1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:22.160
 um, there's a lot of variables that make it more interesting to coach someone who's actually like

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:28.240
 not an elite athlete or someone who's a professional athlete, I should say, uh, the, but,

1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:33.600
 but yeah, so they're, they're going to do that stuff. Those, those shorter intervals, um, for

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.920
 probably about like four to six weeks. If they're doing, if they're doing a longer race, like a

1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:42.080
 hundred miles, if they were doing say a 5k, we'd start bringing those workouts in near the end of

1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:45.280
 their plan. Cause that's going to be specific to their race pace. That's going to be the intensity

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:49.120
 that maybe they're doing for, you know, like a three K or a five K or something like that. So

1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:53.360
 it's going to be more relative to what they're going to use. So it follows that philosophy.

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:58.640
 The plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early. And then we start

1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:04.480
 phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end of

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:09.200
 the plan. And then the distance of, or the time that you're going to spend out doing whatever event

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:13.040
 it is, is going to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there. I wonder if I could ask you for

1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:21.600
 some sort of advice, maybe almost, uh, maybe look at me as a case study of a particular runner and

1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:30.240
 runner and then see how we can plan stuff out. So which context to give. Okay. So I have been,

1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:34.640
 first, let me say how much we're currently in Austin. I want to say how much I love Austin for

1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:41.760
 many reasons. Uh, first and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there's so much love

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:46.640
 that I've experienced immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I've been

1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:53.920
 in. It's, uh, it's not quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately. I mean, I really love,

1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:57.680
 love it here in Austin. And because I've been going through a bunch of stressful stuff,

1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:04.720
 I just kind of gave myself a chance to say, okay, I'm going to stick to a diet of carnivore, keto,

1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:13.680
 but I'm going to eat as much as I want because, uh, primarily because just barbecue was part of

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:17.920
 the love I was getting here. And I was like, either I resist or just give in. And I decided

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:22.320
 to give in and actually use this as an opportunity to relax and have fun for the past three, four

1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:27.280
 months, plus whiskey and so on. And then the training kind of all, I also let go of the

1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:32.240
 training a little bit, just to relax, to really focus on the work, focus on the love I've been

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:37.600
 getting all those kinds of things. But now I just kind of want to set a goal for myself to get back

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:44.720
 into both competing and grappling, but also doing a, um, hanging out with David Goggins and, uh,

1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:48.880
 doing a conversation with him, but almost this is my own personal kind of race that I'm looking

1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:56.720
 forward to. And in terms of distance, that means running with David, uh, something like a marathon

1:19:57.360 --> 1:20:05.120
 plus plus it's like, it's unclear what plus. So my goal would be to, uh, continue eating carnivore,

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:10.240
 which is a whole nother topic that I'd love to talk to you about. I feel great psychologically,

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:14.880
 sort of in terms of mental performance in my work when I eat carnivore and physically,

1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:22.560
 I love it. I've never felt any kind of need for carbs to, uh, to improve performance in my running

1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:26.880
 or anything else. Combine that with fasting, intermittent fasting, or eating once a day.

1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:33.600
 I just, that's when I, uh, feel the best. What else? I also feel best. And this is something

1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:39.520
 you can push back on. I feel best when I just run every day, like no breaks ever,

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:48.400
 and usually the same way every day. So like, I know this is suboptimal. It'd be interesting

1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:53.680
 to hear your opinion of just how suboptimal that is. Uh, so I think that actually lays

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:58.880
 out like where my mind is. I'm happy eating carnivore once a day. I like running every day.

1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:06.080
 Uh, the goal is to run a marathon in two months ish, two months plus, and then about three months

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.600
 to do a bunch of competitions and grappling. Okay. With those parameters, I think like you

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:15.600
 actually probably would be a great candidate for maximum heroic function training strategy.

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:20.640
 Like you want that consistency where I'm going to do the same thing each day. Uh, you don't want to

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:24.480
 beat yourself up so much any one day that you can't get out and do it the next one. That's the

1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:30.240
 sweet spot with maximum heroic function is the, the, the trademark there is that you,

1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:35.680
 you can keep going and keep doing it again and again and again, because as long as you're not,

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:39.040
 you know, going out one day and trying to do twice as much as what you're ready for, for that

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:43.040
 one specific, the key for you is going to be picking the right starting point and then building

1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:50.560
 from there on what that day kind of entails in terms of how much running you do. So, um,

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:56.480
 where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided that it's a hard, fast rule that you run

1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:02.720
 an hour every day, seven days a week. But we find out that to run your maximum robot function means

1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:07.360
 you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes. Then what you would maybe do is you would run

1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:13.440
 underneath your maximum aerobic function for the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes,

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:17.360
 maybe throw some of those strides in there if you want to do that at the very end. Uh, and then that

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:23.120
 middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum road function target. And then maybe after, you know,

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:27.280
 four weeks, you start noticing, you know what, this 30 minutes isn't wearing me out near as much as

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:31.520
 it used to. Um, I feel like I could easily push past that. Well, let's up that to 40 minutes. So

1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:35.760
 that 60, you're always staying within that 60 minute parameter that keeps your, your schedule

1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:41.120
 consistent, your routine consistent. I'm wearing a heart rate monitor to sort of as I run to monitor

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:47.280
 it. Sure. You could do that. You could go perceived effort. Um, I like to use them in tandem in the

1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:52.240
 sense that like early on, I'll maybe look at my heart rate a little more often, especially for

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:58.480
 shorter length. There is heart rate can get messy the longer you go. So I, I end up kind of maybe

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:03.680
 stepping away from heart rate a little more than some will at a certain point because I'm ultimately

1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:07.840
 I'm going to be usually training or working with someone to run like, you know, a race that's really

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:12.560
 long and they get cardiac drift, dehydration, heat and things that are going to make the heart rate

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:18.240
 super messy. Yeah. But you're probably your ability to measure perceived effort is exceptionally good.

1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:22.240
 Mine is actually really weak. Okay. Heart rate then I need to do the, still the work of connecting

1:23:22.240 --> 1:23:26.640
 heart rate to the perceived effort. Yep. And that's exactly what I would use heart rate for then. And

1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:32.320
 you'll get to a point probably by like in the first couple of months where you, you can still

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:36.080
 lean on heart rate if you want, but it'll be kind of one of those things where you keep

1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:39.440
 looking at, you're like, Oh wow, I can guess it. And you play a game with yourself too. And you

1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:44.560
 say, well, how close can I guess? You'll get it. So like for me, what I'll do is I'll do the run

1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:47.840
 and then I'll look at the heart rate afterwards and be like, Oh cool. I was right there. Or I

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:51.200
 remember feeling like I was speeding up a little bit there and their show is right there on the

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.960
 heart rate or. I also love sort of something we haven't talked about. I love pushups and pull ups

1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:02.320
 of like body weight workouts. Again, it's mostly mental. I just enjoy the mental challenge of it.

1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:09.200
 I also like, it makes me feel like if all I'm doing is running, it makes me feel I'm not like.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:10.880
 One dimensional.

1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:16.640
 Yeah. One dimensional. I mean, there's some aspect to running that's not to be like hippie

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:20.880
 about it, but like, you know, you're, you're with nature, you're running in the, it's like,

1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:25.360
 we're born to do this thing. And that same way, I feel like when I'm doing pushups and pull ups,

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:30.960
 I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff. Like it's like this body weight exercise that

1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:36.320
 is, body weight exercises have that way about them. It's, it doesn't have that dumbbell feel

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:41.440
 or doing bench press or squats, squats with weight. When you're just doing squats,

1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:47.920
 body weight, we do pushups and pull ups, body weight, even just basic ab stuff, core stuff,

1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:52.240
 body weight. I don't know. I just love the way I feel doing that. So it's usually,

1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:55.520
 I forgot to mention that part. I combine that with the running afterwards,

1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:57.120
 doing some basic body weight stuff.

1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:02.160
 Yeah. And I think like you're going to get from, if we're not looking at it from like specifically,

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:09.360
 like training at a pace in order to get both the skeletal muscle adaptations, as well as the

1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:13.520
 cardiovascular benefits, you're probably tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that

1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:19.120
 body weight. So this, and unless you're doing, I guess no rest. Okay. So is it,

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.280
 you get pretty high heart rate from that. Yeah. Very hard. Okay. Higher than running. Yep.

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.960
 So you're checking that box there from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness,

1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:34.240
 overall fitness standpoint. I think you want to keep your running more aerobic then because

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:37.920
 you're getting that and you're probably getting it from like your grappling workouts too,

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:44.720
 I would guess. So there's just not as big of a need for you from a big picture standpoint to be

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:50.480
 doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well. And it sounds like you prefer not to.

1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:57.280
 Yeah. That's right. So I mean, what about the distance of marathon versus a hundred miles?

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:03.760
 Is that a big difference? What's a good goal to work towards? Is it marathon and the rest of it

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:08.880
 just takes care of itself? Yeah. So you want to do a marathon and then ultimately do a

1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:13.680
 hundred mile after that? Is that what you're saying? I have no idea what the guy. Oh, so he's

1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:17.360
 going to tell you spot on what you're doing. So you have to be ready for anything. For anything.

1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:24.320
 Right. My own personal goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a marathon.

1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:30.320
 The longest I've ever run is 22 miles, but there's been many stretches of my life where I would

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:37.120
 regularly run. Like the long run would be close to 20 miles. And then I was comfortably running 10

1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:44.800
 miles four months ago. Feels like forever ago. Until I injured myself a little bit by running

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:49.680
 in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don't realize how much you appreciate

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:57.360
 your toes until you stub them. That big toes where all that power comes off. And so it was surprising

1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:03.200
 how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how unpleasant running, how much I hated

1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:07.840
 running with it. And then I kept like coming, trying to get back out there to run to think,

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:13.120
 I think it's okay. And no, it's not okay. You really need to let it fully heal. At least that

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:17.600
 was my experience. I couldn't like just suck it up. It was making it worse every time. And one of

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:23.440
 those injuries that could really feel, even though it's so small, but it's essential. So is there any

1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:28.720
 difference between the goal of marathon or a hundred miles? Would you say, should I be prepping

1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:33.520
 for a hundred miles if that's at all a possibility? The big difference is going to be like you're

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:38.080
 dropping intensity significantly by going up to a hundred miles versus the marathon. So

1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:42.400
 the maximum aerobic function I think is actually going to feed into that maybe a little bit better.

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:49.920
 It's probably gonna be a little closer. It all varies a bit because people will focus on specific

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:58.160
 distances and they'll get very efficient and very adapted to that. So it's what makes running kind

1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:04.480
 of messy where you'll get, for example, the average person can hit their lactate threshold

1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:08.400
 for probably about 60 minutes or something like that. Whereas you get these elite marathoners

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:12.880
 who've been basically spending their entire life preparing for a marathon race. They can push

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:18.080
 almost up to their lactate threshold and after lactate threshold for almost like two hours.

1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:23.520
 So it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens, but you're,

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:27.120
 you don't really have to worry about that too much because you're not really focusing on being

1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:31.280
 the best possible hundred mile or the best possible marathon. Or you could be, you want

1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:36.320
 enough overall fitness that you can just do either one of them without absolute misery because you

1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:42.400
 did the couch to a hundred miles. So I think like for a hundred miles, the biggest difference I think

1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:47.040
 given your context is just like the more physical things you are doing, the better prepared you're

1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:53.200
 going to be for the hundred mile. So it's almost given your context. I wouldn't say irrelevant.

1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:56.320
 You want to be doing running, but you're going to be doing that. Once you put it in your program,

1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:04.800
 it sounds like it's going to be pretty locked in. If you view it this way, it's probably going to

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:10.800
 be more mentally beneficial to where, Hey, today I did my run. I did my body weight exercises. I

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:16.000
 did some grappling practice. You know, I spent three hours working out today. If you think of

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.760
 it like that, then you know, you're, you're moving your body, you're doing things that are active for

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:27.120
 a good chunk of the day, especially relative to most people. So that's going to actually be very

1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:32.560
 helpful for you. Uh, the, the problem or the, the, the battle to get over is going to just be like

1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:37.040
 the, you know, you're going to break down physically running a hundred miles and you're

1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:42.560
 gonna break down physically running a marathon too. So like the, you might just have to push

1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:47.040
 through a little more discomfort, like from a physical standpoint compared to be a few decided

1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:53.440
 I'm gonna do everything I can in these next like 24 weeks to be able to run a, a full hundred,

1:29:54.160 --> 1:30:00.400
 a hundred miler. Would you say it's physical or is it mental discomfort? Like, uh, I mean,

1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:05.600
 isn't everything physically uncomfortable? Like what, uh, do you train for if you're training for

1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:11.120
 the chaos of, uh, so it's not necessarily the hundred miles. It's the chaos of the unexpected,

1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:15.840
 which might include a hundred miles, but it might also include a thousand pushups in my case. So

1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:19.680
 like, you need a bit jack of all trades is what you need to be. But also like building up the

1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:27.200
 confidence or maybe not. I don't know. How do you survive a thousand pushups? It's combination of

1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:32.240
 confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing. Not necessarily the actual

1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:42.160
 number, but like doing crazy stuff. And the, the second is probably the base strength and endurance

1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:49.360
 and also just the practicing that process of not quitting. I feel like that's one of the things I

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:53.840
 really need to do in the running space is like doing slightly unpleasant things where I'm

1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:59.840
 yeah, practicing that, like bringing my mind back and saying, Nope, uh, I'm going to keep doing it.

1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:04.880
 And part of the running every day has that benefit because some days you really don't want to feel,

1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:08.480
 don't feel like running and doing that. Then you're practicing that muscle of,

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:14.400
 um, of doing it anyway. Um, I don't know if there's something you can say in terms of advice,

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:21.040
 how to practice the, like doing something unpleasant every day frequently. Yeah. What

1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:27.840
 I would do with that is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to the

1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:34.480
 next if you can. So the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be,

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:41.760
 it becomes like a negative feedback loop in your physiologically potentially as well as mentally,

1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:48.000
 where if the entire running process is miserable, you're going to be miserable when you step on that

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:51.920
 starting line, whether it's a marathon or a hundred miles. So you've trained yourself that

1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:56.240
 running equals miserable. Well, and here's the thing. Like if you look at just like,

1:31:56.240 --> 1:32:01.840
 here's where the literature says on paper are like the dozen workouts you should do in a training

1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:06.240
 plan. And this is how you should structure them right down to the minute. And you just say,

1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:10.320
 like, I'm going to give everyone this schedule and they're going to do this every time rinse

1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:16.800
 and repeat. My biggest concern with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position

1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:23.600
 where the training is so boring and so monotonous that like if they hit a roadblock mentally,

1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:27.360
 they're going to fall apart very quick because they've already exhausted themselves mentally,

1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:32.400
 just trying to do the same old interval every time doing the same old workout. And it doesn't

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:37.520
 necessarily have to be like one specific plan in its entirety could just be like,

1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:41.840
 like the, the mix of things within it. So like, rather than like, if I just said, do,

1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:46.000
 oh, we're going to do three minute intervals, this entire short interval process or two minute

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:51.360
 intervals or four minute intervals or 62nd intervals, you know, by that sixth week,

1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:54.960
 they might be so sick of that, that they're not actually maximizing their potential within that

1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:59.680
 because there's no flavor there. And, and then they're also actually getting less out of themselves

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:03.680
 than they would if we just got a little more creative and said, okay, let's mix this up and

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:09.120
 let's do, uh, you know, for one minute intervals, then take a little bit of a break and then we'll

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:12.800
 do three minute intervals or at least changing it up from week to week so that they have something

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:16.320
 different showing up, even though we're addressing the same kind of physiological adaptation.

1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:22.240
 Uh, so like, I think what you want to do is you want to introduce the misery. You want to be able

1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:26.240
 to test yourself to the degree where like, when you can recognize these points of, I don't want

1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:33.360
 to be here, but I can do it and push through it, but recognize that like, there's not necessarily

1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:37.360
 going to be one event that you want to lean on to get that from because you won't want to make that

1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:41.440
 one event so miserable that you don't want to do it when it comes time for the challenge. So

1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:48.480
 if you can possibly say like, okay, on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I'm going to go 10 pushups

1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:51.520
 more than I want to. I'm going to get to that point where I'm like, there's no more. And then

1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:56.320
 I'm going to do 10 more and you're going to make that one miserable. And then maybe on, uh, you

1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:01.120
 know, Thursdays you decide to do like some of those sprints or something at the end where

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:05.040
 you do a few of them and you're like, okay, this is where I'd be comfortable to stop. Like, well,

1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:07.280
 I'm going to do two more of them because I know I don't want to do two more of them,

1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:12.800
 um, but mix that up. So you're not, so at least you're getting enjoyment from some of it and not

1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:17.840
 just getting complete disgust from the entire process. There's actually quite a lot of ways

1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:23.840
 that I can introduce misery into the running, get creative, including, um, you know, even just like

1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.280
 stuff outside of the running, like taking a freezing cold showers, those kinds of things,

1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:33.760
 just introducing random kind of chaos into the, into the system, um, or having conversations with

1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:43.200
 people as an introvert. It's terrifying. More podcasts. So, um, now starting, uh, the training

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:48.560
 and, uh, Zach, you've been kind enough to also kind of, um, be willing to help me out throughout

1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:53.520
 this process. So I look forward to where that goes. It's kind of, uh, fascinating. Um, on the

1:34:53.520 --> 1:35:00.640
 diet side, you're, uh, one of, one of the many things that, uh, make you fascinating is, uh,

1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:06.000
 you've played with diet as well and you're, um, somewhat famous, I would say, for doing low carb

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:11.360
 or playing with low carb or meat based diets. Can you describe the potential, like how you're

1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:17.760
 thinking about that has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or keto diet

1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.400
 or a meat based diet in training as an ultra marathon runner? Yeah. And I think like where

1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.720
 a lot of times things get confusing for people here is the context of it too, where it's like,

1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:32.320
 they want an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport? And it's like, well, endurance

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:36.720
 sport is quite wide ranging as we've talked about many, many times here. So there's going to be

1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:42.640
 differences, I think, in just like what you want to maybe necessarily prioritize, uh, both for the

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:46.400
 event you're doing and the intensity that's required for it, the training that's required

1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:50.080
 for that event. And then also the individual component too, where I think this one often

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:55.840
 gets overlooked, where we tend to say like, well, we've got all these Olympic medalists

1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:01.920
 at the marathon and below distance who are, you know, eating a moderate to high carbohydrate diet.

1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:06.400
 So everyone needs to do that if they want to reach their potential in, you know,

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:11.840
 say the three K to the marathon. And, you know, in a perfect world, maybe that would be true,

1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:17.520
 but there's a lot of other variables that often get forgotten then that could positively or

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:22.560
 negatively impact that decision choice. So I think Dr. Jeff Volk has done a great job of kind of

1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:26.320
 highlighting this in the sense that, you know, when he works with people, he works with people

1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:30.560
 in the health sphere as well as the performance sphere. And, you know, he's one of the main guys

1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:36.160
 at Virta health who's, uh, they've got like a 60% success rate with working with folks with the

1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:42.960
 type two diabetes to, um, reverse their type two diabetes. Uh, and I mean, that's an astounding,

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:47.200
 when you, when you think of just any nutritional protocol, its success rate, they're all incredibly

1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.480
 low. They're very, very low. And the big difference with his is the coaching aspect of it. Like the

1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:56.320
 give support. So these people like have someone to turn to when they make a mistake, or if they're

1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:00.160
 thinking about doing something differently, or they don't know what to do rather than just kind

1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:04.560
 of throwing, throwing it all up in the air and quitting. They, they, they have a resource there.

1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:07.520
 And that's probably a big reason why that's the success rate that they have with that,

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:12.720
 is they put those support mechanisms in place. That picture needs to be carried into the

1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:18.080
 performance world or the running world too, where, you know, we may have just been identifying

1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:26.160
 that, uh, you know, Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion of their diet

1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.920
 coming from carbohydrate is going to just, it's going to filter those ones towards the Olympics

1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:38.320
 filter those towards interesting. Yeah. And that doesn't mean that like, uh, if we would have taken

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:42.240
 say the gold medals in the five came, put them on a low carb diet, they'd run faster. They probably

1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:45.840
 wouldn't, because we may have already selected that that person's thriving on carbohydrate.

1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:50.640
 Uh, what I would be interested in is like, you have, let's say we have someone with equal talent,

1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:56.400
 but got weeded out along the way potentially because for whatever reason, they just weren't

1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:00.240
 able to tolerate like the, both the training and the nutrition requirements that they're being told

1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.560
 to do. So the coaches can, there's a culture where the coaches would really push a carb heavy diet

1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:11.600
 and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people that are not,

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:16.160
 it would filter out the people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their training.

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:20.880
 I mean, I might be an example of this actually where, you know, you take someone where, uh,

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:24.560
 they, for whatever reason, the carbs aren't working for them. Like it's unsustainable for them to

1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:27.920
 continue that path. Or if they do, they might have a shortened career, so they might be able to eke

1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:30.560
 out a few really good years, but then, you know, they're not going to be the person they're like,

1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:36.080
 wow, that person's 38 and they're still competing at the Olympics type of a person. Uh, and, you

1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:41.760
 know, you, you, you put them on a low carb diet, uh, if you can control everything else, like their

1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:49.120
 entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then, uh, you know, they may still have

1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:55.760
 better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level. But if that's not going to,

1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:59.920
 if that's not going to be sustainable for them as a person, then, you know,

1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:04.800
 what's the point kind of at that, unless they want to be like a kind of a spark in the pan,

1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:09.680
 so to speak. I just feel good eating meat performance wise. Well, I think there's that

1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.480
 group too. And they may just not be the Olympians. Yeah. And so we're not talking,

1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:20.640
 I guess this conversation has several layers. One is for the Olympics and one is for like,

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:28.000
 what is it? Active athletes that are like amateurs, whatever, whatever category I

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:33.760
 put myself into, like people that exercise regularly. And then, um, maybe people,

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:39.840
 and then there's people who like exercise rarely. So on all of those fronts, I mean,

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:47.840
 do you think it's possible to live a happy, uh, active life eating meat only or mostly meat?

1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:52.560
 Yeah. What have you learned about this? Yeah. I think, uh, so for, for some context,

1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:56.720
 like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate diet for the last 10 years.

1:39:56.720 --> 1:40:01.840
 And just like kind of the training, I periodize it to a degree where there are parts of my training

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:05.600
 where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate. And there's periods of my training, especially

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:09.920
 like the off season where I'm like very low and I might be like kind of in that ballpark of, uh,

1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:14.800
 like, you know, ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates for, for periods of time.

1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:18.880
 And what kind of food are we talking about? What's a strict low carb diet?

1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:23.760
 I've ranged everywhere from like mostly plant based, low carb keto to like mostly animal based.

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:30.640
 I very rarely gone much more than like two weeks strict where it's like I'm strict carnivore or

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.640
 strict plant based or anything like that. Like we're talking probably more like 95%

1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:42.320
 at the, at the peak. Um, in terms of any type of like, like longer lasting, uh, from my personal

1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:47.440
 experience of like being like either in like the animal food camp or her, like the plant based camp

1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:52.480
 kind of a, of a process. Um, so I've tried all of them, things that stayed consistent over the 10

1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:56.400
 years as a kind of the macro nutrient profile that I've done throughout the course. So one

1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:00.000
 didn't win over the other in terms of meat based versus plant based. Oh, for me, meat based,

1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:04.640
 definitely. What was, I mean, I was, I was my highest meat consumption in 2019 and that was

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:08.960
 by far my best racing season. Yeah. We keep, we keep coming back to that year. That was a good

1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:13.200
 year for many reasons, philosophically and nutritionally. Yeah. Well in 2020 happened and

1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:18.400
 now I haven't had a really good chance to, to, uh, to improve. We'll see. Hopefully I've got some

1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:23.520
 more, some more in the tank. That's strange. There's so most athletes that compete at your level

1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:29.920
 have more carbs integrated into their diets. So what have you learned about using meat in a high

1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:35.200
 performance? I think it's maybe less about the meat and it's more about like, what are you,

1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:43.680
 what is it replacing? So if we go, if we step away from like me specifically and just like the people

1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:47.280
 that, cause I mean, we're getting to the point where I get it's anecdotes, but like, like that's

1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:51.040
 what we have at the moment. Cause there's, I mean, there is actually a study being done on, like,

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:55.600
 I think I guess they'd call it hypercarnivore where they're like, I think above 80% of their

1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:01.040
 intake from meat. Um, and they're looking at a few different things there, but it's so weird

1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:07.280
 and I keep interrupting, but it's so weird that it sounds unhealthy, uh, hypercarnivore. Yeah. But

1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:14.080
 it makes me feel really good. So I, that's the individual thing, right? There's countless people

1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:19.600
 now who like, and I'm not saying that they could not have found another route, myself included,

1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:24.880
 like in 2011, when I switched from moderate to high carbohydrate to low carbohydrate and saw some

1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:30.720
 very noticeable differences in the way I felt, the way I performed in all this stuff, that doesn't

1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:38.080
 mean that there wasn't another path. I just did not find that path. And the, the, the fact that

1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:42.320
 I found a path that was producing the results I was looking for is really all that matters in my

1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:46.880
 mind. You know, like I don't really care if there was a parallel path that works just as well or,

1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:52.480
 you know, something like that, because ultimately we only have one shot at everything we're doing.

1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:55.840
 So like, it'd be great if I could go back and try four or five different things. Well,

1:42:55.840 --> 1:43:00.640
 the annoying thing is that the body adjusts to whatever the heck you're doing. So you can't,

1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:04.880
 it's hard to do good science even on yourself. Yeah. I've referenced my 2019 racing season a few

1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:09.360
 times and it's like, it'd be silly for me to put all of the emphasis on my nutrition plan for that,

1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:14.640
 because it's also comes with two decades of endurance training. So it's possible and it's

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:19.040
 it's possible. And it's very likely that a huge portion of that success was just the culmination

1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:23.920
 of a lot of work over time from the training side of things. I just think like anytime you hyper

1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:29.680
 focus on one area or pick a couple of variables and just target those, you find yourself in a

1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:34.320
 position where you are, you're putting other things in the most uncharitable light possible.

1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:40.160
 So, so then you have this situation where like, it's actually a combination of a variety of

1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:45.600
 different things. So where are the big movers? And you know, for me, nutritional shift was pretty

1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:51.600
 clear that that improved my sleep and my recovery. And I mean, people can say, well, there's the

1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:56.800
 placebo effect, which is a very real concern. But you know, for me personally, a 10 year placebo

1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:03.120
 effect would be a quite lengthy placebo effect. And I do think it's individual, though I emphasize

1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:07.440
 that a lot because I mean, I've worked with tons of people with this and I do see a range from

1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:13.360
 person to person. I've worked with people who come to me and they're like strict keto and we raise up

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.320
 their carbohydrates a bit. And they're like, okay, I feel way better doing it this way. And I've worked

1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:22.000
 with people who they come to me moderate carbohydrate, but they're interested enough.

1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:28.080
 They want to try a lower carb. So we, you know, we titrate them down and I've had clients where

1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.080
 I'm like, okay, I'm gonna give them this workout. And they're gonna wish they brought back a little

1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:36.400
 bit of carbohydrate. And then they go and they nail the workout. And I'm just like baffled that

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:39.440
 because because they're different from me. And every time, you know, when you have your own

1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:45.280
 personal experience, the first guttural response is, oh, if I had done it, it would have gone this

1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:48.960
 way. Why did it go the complete opposite way for them? And you kind of have to just kind of step

1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:53.600
 out of your own perspective a bit and say like, okay, well they're different, you know, for

1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:58.720
 whatever reason they're getting, getting along like this. I've had like several moments in my

1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:04.880
 life where you kind of realize the body is weird and it's weirder than the average advice. Like

1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:12.960
 one of them is how well I perform for my own standards when I fast. First of all, intellectually,

1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:18.880
 but that's more known and understandable. But like physically, the fact that I could train,

1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:26.160
 like not eat 20 hours, 24 hours, and then do a hard like jiu jitsu session for like two hours,

1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:33.040
 like hard. It's incredible to me. Like this makes no sense. Cause I used to eat like many times a

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:37.280
 day. Of course you have to eat, like you don't want to eat too close to the training session

1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:41.760
 was my thinking, but you definitely need to load up on carbs like three hours before they can,

1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:47.680
 in order to have enough energy. The fact that I could not eat and have like incredible focus,

1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:54.240
 but also athleticism, like both endurance and explosive. I mean, jiu jitsu is a special thing.

1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:58.560
 It's like more like chess. It's not like powerlifting, no, not powerlifting, Olympic

1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:04.000
 lifting, where it's like true explosiveness, but that's fascinating. And it makes me wonder like,

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:11.040
 what other things are there to discover about yourself? The annoying thing about food is it's

1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:17.760
 delicious. And so it's hard to do good science on yourself, like to do, you know, for two weeks or

1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:25.520
 a month to do like strict no carbs. And then maybe next month you add 20 grams or 40 grams of carbs

1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:31.040
 and see how you actually feel. Not like in that moment, but over a period of several weeks and

1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:36.800
 then doing everything else right with based on best available science, like with electrolytes

1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:41.600
 and then vitamins, but then also like remove all the humans from your life that affect you

1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:45.760
 positively or negatively. Cause you might feel amazing because you're hanging out with cool

1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:51.680
 people and then, you know, like removing basically all the variables. It's kind of fascinating. And

1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:57.200
 you kind of, all of us land in a place where we find something that worked for us. And then we

1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:03.360
 maybe use some of the placebo effect to help us out, to stick in that place. And then I suppose

1:47:03.360 --> 1:47:07.760
 that's the way to live life. I guess it's impossible to find the optimal for any of us,

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:16.240
 but carnivore is an interesting new kind of caveat, a new challenge to the nutritional community,

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:19.920
 because more and more people seem to be doing well under carnivore.

1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:24.320
 Yeah. Well, the nutrition community is probably like, we just got done like dealing with the

1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:28.720
 vegans and now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us. But I think, well, I mean,

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:35.920
 what this all tells, what this all tells me is like, there is a, for one, like in our food

1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:41.440
 environment, like the failure rate of any one approach at a population level is going to be

1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:46.560
 incredibly high. I mean, it's why we have, you know, what is it like 88% of the population has

1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:50.800
 some sort of like metabolic syndrome. And it's, it's like, you know, it's because there's an

1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:56.240
 endless quantity of everything that you can get your hands on for relatively cheap. And I think

1:47:56.240 --> 1:48:02.480
 that's, that, that presents a problem. If your mindset is going to be, we need this set of

1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:07.760
 parameters for nutrition and everyone needs to adhere to that or you're wrong. And it's like,

1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:13.280
 well tell that to the person who like went carnivore and cleared up some like crazy skin

1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:18.960
 ailment or something like that. That's a weird one. Like where the carnivore seems to treat like,

1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:24.640
 like depression, like mental stuff. It's fascinating. There's all these stories. Again,

1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:31.440
 it's anecdotes, but it's like the mental one, I think may, I'm stepping out a bit on a limb here,

1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:37.360
 but I want to say like some of the research of Dominic DiAgostino and Jeff Volokh was looking at

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:43.520
 the ketogenic diet, which of carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic. I

1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:48.560
 mean, you could always go like way too high on the protein, I guess, but most people that I see

1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:54.320
 doing carnivore, they're cognizant enough that at least if they're doing it for therapeutic reasons,

1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:00.240
 they're not going like, you know, 50% protein, 50%. They're more like 70, 30, 80, 20, something

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:07.440
 like that. And, and I think like you, you do see some, some work with like the brain. So the mental

1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:12.800
 stuff, I know some of the, I'm not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that, that Dr.

1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:18.240
 Dominic DiAgostino had where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post traumatic

1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:22.720
 stress disorder and that sort of stuff with, with like a strict ketogenic diet. So I wonder if some

1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:26.960
 of that, like the depression related stuff has to do with that, where now like their body is just

1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:31.600
 fueling their brain differently than maybe they were in the past, but that's just, you know,

1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:36.800
 wild guesses on my part. And I'm deviating from the conversation, but like, no, that's brilliant.

1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:42.800
 In terms of your own story on food, can you say something? I think we were kind of referring to

1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:50.560
 diet broadly. Can you say something about how you like to fuel your like, whether it's race or great

1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:58.400
 training sessions, like maybe the day before, let's go even that far during, and maybe a few

1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:04.480
 hours after. Okay. It'll be a little different for racing than it will be for like a big workout,

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:08.400
 just because the interesting thing about ultra running is just like, you never do the race even

1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:11.600
 like most endurance races, you're going to cover the distance. You're going to replicate the race

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:16.880
 almost up to it in training. Whereas with a hundred miles, you can't, you might replicate a

1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:21.680
 third of it. So, so I'll do, I'll walk you through kind of my approach for, for like a hundred mile

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.480
 race. And I can tell you maybe what I would do differently on like a training day. But yeah, so

1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:33.200
 for where, where the community is an agreement is that you do want to be very good at burning fat

1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:38.400
 for ultra marathons. I mean, there's just like the intensity is low. If your, if your ratios are

1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:47.040
 skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you're going to have to defend your muscle

1:50:47.040 --> 1:50:52.320
 glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption. And that's just going to be very hard to do over

1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:56.960
 the course of an entire day, even at low intensities. So it's a fuel tank thing. I mean,

1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:00.640
 it's like your, your leanest endurance athletes have way more fat than they do. Glycogen stores.

1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:05.120
 When you're doing the low intensity performance, you want to be burning high levels of fat and

1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:11.200
 sparing that muscle glycogen. What I tend to do is I want to start the race burning really high

1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:15.520
 levels of fat. So I'm going to, I'll maybe have some carbohydrate the night before for dinner,

1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:20.400
 but then I'm going to lean into the overnight fast breakfast the morning of I'm going to stay

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:24.800
 away from carbohydrates for a hundred mile or anyway. And I'm going to have something like

1:51:25.280 --> 1:51:33.040
 something that's pretty like a high energy, low volume. So like I'll do like an S fuels, a life

1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:38.480
 bar. They've got like, what's in an S fuel life bar? Are we talking about carbs or we're talking

1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:45.040
 about protein fat and protein? Yeah. Fat protein bar. And then they make some awesome. Yeah. So

1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:49.920
 it's, it's not as low carb. Yep. Yeah. They make S fuels makes a whole product line. That's like

1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:55.600
 kind of positioned for a low carb athlete. So they have some products on their lineup that

1:51:55.600 --> 1:51:59.360
 offers some carbohydrate, which is perfect for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on

1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:04.720
 racing and some of my bigger training sessions and things, but the majority of their products are

1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:09.600
 low carb. So like they have like, you know how you get like the powders that you put into like your

1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:13.920
 drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products. They make a version of that.

1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:19.600
 That's like fat based. Oh, cool. That you can mix in with water. Yep. Cool. Yeah. So they've got

1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:23.200
 like a creamer version and then a fruity flavored version. So you can like replicate the taste and

1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:27.600
 the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a sports drink. Science is awesome. I know it is.

1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:30.960
 Well, and that's so much of it too, cause people are always like, well, I don't know. I just,

1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:35.280
 I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever. It's like, well, you can have it now. It just,

1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:39.040
 it won't have all that. So you can bring that kind of thing with you. Yeah. So I'm leaning

1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:45.120
 on a lot of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume, high energy fat protein

1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:48.960
 stuff the morning of so that when I start the race, my body's going to be encouraged to start

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:55.200
 out burning high levels of fat. Once I get going probably about 45 minutes in, I'll start introducing

1:52:55.200 --> 1:53:00.720
 small amounts of carbohydrate. So at that point, my body's been revving pretty high fat metabolism

1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:06.880
 and by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let's say my a hundred

1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:12.800
 mile, uh, personal record, you know, I'm, I'm running approximately nine miles every hour.

1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:17.760
 So I'm probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour's time. Uh, I'm going to

1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:23.360
 start just like defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat at the heart

1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:28.000
 rate I would do for that. I'm probably burning somewhere between 80, 90% fat, you know, 12 hours

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:32.400
 of that you can chip away at your muscle glycogen, uh, to the point where you don't necessarily want

1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:37.360
 to go zero carb. So I'm basically just trying to defend what I know I'm going to be burning from

1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:44.720
 the carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like, usually,

1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:49.120
 you know, I've gone as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams.

1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:54.000
 Um, and the reality is somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40, I can get away

1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:59.520
 without any digestion issues. So I'm not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since

1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:04.000
 I'm only concerned about performance on that day, the carbs, the problem, or is it fiber?

1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:10.080
 Oh, from going above 40 grams or just cause you mentioned digestion issues. Like one of the things

1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:16.640
 for me, like one of the cool things about fatty protein protein and fat is like my stomach just

1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:22.800
 feels way better. So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great.

1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:27.120
 Yeah. And I think the funny thing is like, if you look at the position paper for ultra marathon

1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:31.680
 single day events and it's, you know, it's very limited in the sense that then it's not anyone's

1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:34.880
 fault. It's just, we don't have a lot of great research on a hundred mile race. It's really hard

1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:40.000
 to study what's going on when someone's running a hundred miles, but they'll say moderate carbohydrate

1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:45.280
 diet is recommended, but they'll also say that it's like something like 60% of participants are

1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:49.600
 going to report some sort of like digestion issue during the event. So then it kind of becomes an

1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:53.280
 issue of, do you want to flip that coin? Do you want to flip that coin and be the 40%.

1:54:53.280 --> 1:55:00.320
 Right. Exactly. So for me, what I found is like, I can push up to 40 grams without getting any

1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:06.800
 digestion issues. Um, do I need 40 grams? Probably not, at least not based on kind of the numbers

1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:12.080
 that would be like, uh, that, that I would see on, like if I went and actually got a,

1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:15.760
 like a metabolic heart test or something like that. Um, but it's possible. I mean,

1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:20.880
 if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning that per hour, um, most folks that are

1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:24.880
 following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are going to be recommended to do like 50 to 70 grams

1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:29.440
 during a single day ultra marathon events. And you'll see some, you know, some recommendations

1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:34.240
 of up to like a hundred grams, uh, not so much for ultra marathons, but just in general, from

1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:38.960
 like a performance standpoint, which I mean, it's one of those things where it's like application

1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:43.280
 versus like what you can do in a lab for one hour is going to be a lot different, especially when

1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:49.120
 you're stretching out distances well past that. And you, you, there's, there's, I'm diverting a

1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:53.600
 little here, but I mean, there's like an approach of like training your gut so you can like be able

1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:57.120
 to tolerate that much carbohydrate, which you can do, and you may have to, if you're going to follow

1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:02.640
 a high carbohydrate diet. But again, we go back to that practicality standpoint of if you're a

1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:08.960
 professional Olympian who's living and breathing performance and you're burning two to three times,

1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:15.360
 you're messing, resting metabolic rate on some days, like you, you may be able to actually

1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:20.080
 consume a hundred grams of carbohydrate per hour during your training sessions and, and just,

1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:24.800
 you know, barely stay on top of your nutritional needs. Most people who are running ultra marathons

1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:30.000
 aren't going to be, you know, probably training much past 10 hours per week. And they're probably

1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:35.680
 not going to have the, I'll call it their, a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred grams of

1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:40.560
 carbohydrate consumption during their workouts and still be able to stay healthy. And, you know,

1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:46.720
 so I think that's kind of like a, a bit of a, of a non, a non starter for the majority of people,

1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:51.360
 unless we want to talk about like a tiny percentage of the 1% of top performers.

1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:55.120
 So maybe you can talk about the training, like fueling yourself during training as well.

1:56:55.120 --> 1:57:01.120
 Is there, and also as part of that, is it possible to train mostly fasted?

1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:10.080
 Because as a side comment, let me just say, I like, again, not anywhere, not even like one

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:15.440
 10th of your level of performance, but you know, I, I try to push myself and I just feel much better

1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:21.840
 when I'm fasted. So water and maybe some salt for longer runs for anything over like 10, 15 miles,

1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:27.120
 but not no food. Yeah. I think, I mean, I like to train on an empty stomach. I do most of my,

1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:30.640
 my biggest training session usually in the morning. And it usually what will determine

1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:33.760
 whether I eat something or not before that is like, how much do I need to eat that day in order

1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:38.320
 to stay on top of it, to build training in the next day. So I'll, I'll, I'll usually do something

1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:42.080
 similar to what I do before a race. If I need to kind of stay on top of calories for the day. So

1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:48.320
 I'm not like at noon with like no calorie intake and like 5,000 calories to try to consume before

1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:54.880
 I go to bed that night and get out and do the same thing the next day. But yeah, I think if I were,

1:57:54.880 --> 1:58:00.320
 if I were doing what you're doing, like if that were my lifestyle, I think I would do almost all

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:05.840
 my runs fasted. I don't see why I would be eating a lot before it because it's like I'm just

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:11.200
 introducing something that could, especially if you're noticing, like here's what I'd say.

1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:15.840
 If I was doing that and I was like, wow, this run sucks. And then I introduced something beforehand

1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:19.520
 and now my run was feeling great and my progress was getting better. That's when I would maybe

1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:24.320
 consider having something before. But if you're running both of those, those like self experiments,

1:58:24.320 --> 1:58:28.720
 you're noticing, yeah, if I eat something before I go on this workout, the workouts less enjoyable,

1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:33.440
 I'm not noticing any, any increased improvements on it. Again, it's a little messy. Like we said

1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:37.200
 before, it's hard to really, you can't go back and try it a different way on that specific day.

1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:43.440
 But I think, I think most people, if they're just like, they go at it with like no bias in the sense

1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:48.400
 that they're like trying to make one work versus the other, you can get at least a good enough look

1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:55.680
 at it. And if absolute peak performance in one activity, one very specific activity isn't your

1:58:55.680 --> 1:59:01.120
 goal, then it's like, do you really care if one has a 2% performance increase that you won't even

1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:06.000
 probably notice because there's other variables that will clearly overpower that 2% one way or

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:11.440
 the other. And there's some benefit in terms of freedom and letting go of like having to think

1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:17.040
 about some of these variables. I see sort of fasting as even if it's like a hit on the performance,

1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:22.960
 it's worth it to just not think about it. There's some really nice aspect to just putting on shoes,

1:59:23.920 --> 1:59:29.360
 not caring like what shorts you wear or like what your outfit is, like not being optimal

1:59:29.360 --> 1:59:35.200
 in every way and just not caring and just enjoying the purity of just running no matter what.

1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:40.960
 Just enjoying the natural aspect. There's a side to me that sometimes just like craves a lifestyle

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:48.160
 where it's like I have like such a small house and only what I need and just like a handful of

1:59:48.160 --> 1:59:52.080
 food products I know I enjoy and work well for me and I don't even have the distraction of the other

1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:58.240
 stuff. There's almost like a weight that comes off your shoulders when you think even just thinking

1:59:58.240 --> 2:00:03.040
 about it like it's so simple. So the reason I'm mostly a minimalist like that, the reason I have

2:00:03.040 --> 2:00:08.960
 stuff is I realize like you probably have to fit into society and if you want to have other people

2:00:08.960 --> 2:00:13.840
 in your life you should probably get used to having stuff because most people like stuff.

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:20.080
 Right. Well yeah there's that side of it too and there's a whole, you don't want to ostracize

2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:24.560
 yourself too much and I think anything you can kind of like you can manipulate that a little

2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:30.640
 bit where there's things that are like not specific to, that's going to negatively impact

2:00:30.640 --> 2:00:35.760
 the people around you or your experiences with them. So there's a balance like everything I guess.

2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:39.520
 Yeah I mean that's why I drink, I think I mentioned you offline, drink vodka, whiskey,

2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:48.560
 sort of alcohol because I don't feel good about it the day after or sometimes multiple days after

2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:53.440
 so I know it's not good for me. So I do a lot of stuff that's good for me, everything we talked

2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:57.600
 about exercise and diet and all those kinds of things but the alcohol almost symbolizes

2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:03.920
 embracing the chaos of life, the wild and the amazing things that could happen and I think

2:01:03.920 --> 2:01:09.280
 that's really important because if you optimize everything about life then you're going to miss

2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:15.440
 most of the fun stuff that happens in life. So it's not all about the optimization, it's some of it

2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:21.840
 like everyone has different things and what they, how they introduce that chaos in a controlled way.

2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:28.480
 For me alcohol is that because I'm okay drinking not too much so I can control that aspect even

2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:34.720
 though it's unhealthy it introduces just the right amount of fun that I embrace it.

2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:38.640
 Yeah and I mean it is one of those things where it's like I'm going to benefit now and pay later

2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:45.520
 a little bit too where like and hey if you go and you go out with some friends and drink and you

2:01:45.520 --> 2:01:49.680
 have memories that last a lifetime from that experience and you paid for it for a couple

2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:52.800
 days after then hey maybe that's a fair trade off from a life experience.

2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:59.040
 And part of the vodka thing is I need to honor my ancestors so it's like you have to you know you

2:01:59.040 --> 2:02:08.560
 can't you can't turn your back on your past. Let me ask about the 100 mile world record on the

2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:16.240
 treadmill. So for most people running a treadmill is really boring so that's kind of their experience

2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.000
 of it that's probably the first thing that would say that seems like really boring to run 100 miles

2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:27.040
 in a treadmill. Would you say it's boring? Like what were some places your mind went to make that

2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:33.920
 happen? So this one is interesting to me because I definitely recognized the boredom and the

2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:39.520
 difference. The thing that the question I can't quite answer I think with it is like could I have

2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:44.880
 remedied that with better preparation because the scenario that put me on a treadmill for 100 miles

2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:51.120
 was you know it was March 2020 basically the cascade of every race on the planet got cancelled

2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:58.480
 and I was in a position where I was going to be doing a runnable 100 miler on a track in

2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:03.360
 mid to late April so I had like the majority of my training under my belt so I was like kind of

2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:08.480
 putting the finishing touches on that and I was like oh great here we are like you know what do

2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.760
 I do with this fitness? Do I just scale back and hope the events come back in fall and then peak

2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:19.120
 again or do I find something to use this fitness for? And the treadmill was the closest thing to

2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:23.280
 what I had been training for in terms of just like a mechanical like flat running essentially

2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:31.760
 that I could think of and my thought was okay well I'll just live stream myself on a treadmill

2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:36.080
 and see what happens. It ended up turning into like a quite a big event. So you don't usually

2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:41.040
 incorporate treadmill running into your running into your training? I don't not incorporate it.

2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:46.640
 I just don't incorporate it in the way that would be necessarily conducive to uh you know dealing

2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:51.200
 with the mental aspects of being on a treadmill for 100 miles. Was it that different than running

2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:55.840
 on a track? It was from the sense that here's the way I describe it is when I'm on a track it's a

2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:02.480
 controlled environment and everything can be very uniform but there are tiny little micro adjustments

2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:08.880
 and pace that that I'm doing subconsciously that give me the sense of control. Right. No I might

2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:13.920
 run the exact same split but there's like a fraction of a second or you know a fraction

2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:17.440
 second faster than a fraction of seconds slower that equals the same outcome. It gives you that

2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:22.320
 sense of control. You're determining how fast you're going. On a treadmill you're responding

2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:26.880
 to the belt so the advantage is you can set a pace and know you're hitting it. The disadvantage is

2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:32.880
 you're being told what to do by that machine and that gets very frustrating. I've felt like I wanted

2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:37.840
 to step off like you get to like certain points where you're just like like even stepping off

2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:41.280
 what I noticed I learned this on the day of actually I noticed there's something where it

2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:44.800
 didn't really matter how long I get off like I get off to use the bathroom and that was a little

2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:52.160
 bit of a longer break. Then I had like a hiccup during my event where we ran so much power through

2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:58.640
 one end of the house that the screen on the treadmill was blacking out. So I ended up jumping

2:04:58.640 --> 2:05:03.120
 back and forth on treadmills for quite a bit in the beginning and I noticed even turning it off

2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:06.400
 stepping on the other and starting the other one up gave me like you know a handful of seconds

2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:12.480
 between was enough of a mental break of just like that release of being told what to do to reset.

2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:17.280
 So maybe if you were in the future you would figure out what exactly how much is needed to

2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:21.920
 have that mental break. I never actually thought about that that I mean obviously for you but also

2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:26.960
 for people like me like amateur runners that that's a source of frustration with the treadmill

2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:33.520
 that there's sometimes small adjustments in pace that we do running not on the treadmill on the

2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:40.560
 ground that feel like essential. Just like you said that experience of control like

2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:46.080
 feeling like you're in control somehow that's really I don't know that's somehow liberating

2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:51.280
 in the way that a treadmill can be just the source of frustration. The funny thing though

2:05:51.280 --> 2:05:57.040
 about the treadmill is I actually like to do faster workouts on the treadmill like long intervals or

2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:02.560
 something like that or tempo runs because for that type of stuff sometimes for those I want

2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:07.920
 to release the brainpower required to hit that pace and say you take care of that and for that

2:06:07.920 --> 2:06:11.760
 it's fun but those are over quick so you don't really run into the times. Yeah that's fascinating

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:18.320
 for like precise control of pace. You've also during that stream got to interact one of the

2:06:18.320 --> 2:06:22.960
 greatest athletes of all time, Berg Kreischer. What's your he's actually doing I don't know

2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:27.280
 if you're paying attention to this but I guess he has a goal of running 2,000 miles this year. Yeah.

2:06:27.280 --> 2:06:33.440
 I've got a chance to talk to Joe Rogan yesterday about this which is fascinating. I think he's a

2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:40.320
 little bit doubtful of Bert's ability to be the ultra performer that he so naturally is. Yeah.

2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:46.000
 What's your thoughts about Bert as a runner? What's your advice to him and what was your

2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:50.880
 interaction like as part of this treadmill challenge with him? I love Bert because he's

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:57.280
 such a nice person. I mean as a guy who's just accelerated in popularity over the last few years

2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:04.160
 like he is like super kind so for folks who are curious like I've met Bert a couple years earlier

2:07:04.160 --> 2:07:08.880
 and I just randomly asked him like hey I'm doing this live stream thing we're doing it for fight

2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:12.960
 for the forgotten we're trying to raise some funds for them would you want to come on the live

2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:16.720
 stream for a bit and I thought maybe he'd come off like five or ten minutes and I thought that'd

2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:20.880
 be amazing if he did that he ended up coming on for like over an hour he said he went past his slot

2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:25.680
 sat in the next slot and just started talking with some of the other guests it's just he's just

2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:32.320
 like Bert is definitely like I feel like he's as unchanged from like his popularity as one can get

2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:40.960
 away with and it's just like his his lifestyle I think is very unpredictable in the sense that like

2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:47.120
 if he wants to run like x time for a specific race that's going to pull away from his lifestyle so

2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:53.120
 much to focus on that luckily for him he's actually a great athlete like you it's it's under that layer

2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:58.080
 of uh of fat yeah so for people who are not familiar Bert Kresch is a comedian who takes off

2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:06.400
 his shirt often has he's a uh uh elegant layer of fat around him he's also a party animal so he's a

2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:14.080
 weird balance of like healthy and unhealthy yeah so he drinks a lot during I think there's some

2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:20.480
 debate about that but certainly after his uh his performances but at the same time he's into kind of

2:08:20.480 --> 2:08:25.920
 the running thing and he does quite a bit of treadmill running I think so and like I said

2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:30.800
 has this challenge of running 2000 miles this year so it's fascinating to have somebody who

2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:37.760
 so fully embraces life and the full joys of life as represented by the huge amounts of drinking and

2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:45.360
 partying and just being a wild man but also at the same time like being at least curious about this

2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:51.040
 challenging yourself in the physical realm it's kind of fascinating it reminds me of um one of

2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:56.160
 my favorite comedians like Eddie Izzard who's been doing those challenges basically off the

2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:04.080
 couch just running um a marathon a day kind of thing it's fascinating to see the purity of those

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:10.960
 challenges when like exercise hasn't necessarily been deeply ingrained in your life and you kind

2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:16.000
 of just embrace the challenge anyway and take it on and that's another way of looking at it

2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:22.240
 because we've been talking about running as a a performance like optimization thing where training

2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:28.240
 is such a huge part of this process like race day is just the cherry on top but there's for some

2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:33.760
 people where the race is the cake yeah it's like they just take it on as a pure challenge as the

2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:38.800
 as the as the thing you haven't really trained for as the thing you haven't you don't understand

2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:43.360
 the intricacies of but you take it on anyway and that that reveals something about the human spirit

2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:48.160
 as well yeah and there's definitely like a switch that flips when you in your mind is saying

2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:52.240
 i'm going to do this where then all of a sudden it goes from like you stop thinking about oh that's

2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:56.320
 not possible to like well i'm just going to do it and i think Burt highlights that perfectly in a

2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:01.200
 lot of cases where like he's he's maybe not even thinking it through enough to get to the point

2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:05.280
 where it's like he gets the point where he thinks this is not possible where most people would look

2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:09.760
 at it and think huh i don't know if i can actually physically accomplish that task Burt's just like

2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:14.400
 oh yeah i'm gonna do it and my my thought with Burt was the 2000 mile thing where he's like

2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:19.280
 yeah i'm gonna do it and my my thought with Burt was the 2000 mile thing is where are we gonna find

2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:24.320
 him at the end of the year with like 36 hours to go on 100 miles and that's right that's right

2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:31.680
 that's what's gonna happen and it's going to be hilarious uh so speaking of things that are insane

2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:38.800
 and like taking on challenges that don't seem like you didn't you didn't think through uh

2:10:38.800 --> 2:10:46.160
 uh you're thinking about running across the country in in a challenge you call the transcontinental

2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:52.080
 run can you describe this challenge and what the heck you're thinking yeah yeah so this is uh you

2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:56.560
 know one thing that is exciting about ultra marathons i think in a lot of places especially

2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:01.600
 early in someone's ultra marathon adventure if they decide to do that as a you know part of their

2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:05.920
 life is you have like these early years where you're doing things for the first time and it's

2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:11.680
 like so cool and scary at the same time to think today i'm gonna run 100 miles and the first ever

2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:15.600
 run before is 50 or something like that and you just know you're gonna do something that you've

2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:18.560
 never done before you're gonna experience things you would have never been able to predict

2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:26.000
 and it's like this really interesting unique like human experience i think so for me i've

2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.480
 spent most of my career at this point like doing i got through that phase and a lot of the events

2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:34.960
 i'm really interested in and then it was like now let's repeat it and see if we can do it better

2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:39.840
 and you get into that mindset for a while which is also a fun mindset but there is that kind of

2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:45.280
 like uh desire to kind of have that human experience again of like you know not knowing

2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:49.600
 what could happen or is this doable type of a thing but still doing it and figuring it out

2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:53.600
 along the way so i would describe the transcontinental project as something like that it's

2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:56.800
 not anything unique to me or anything new there's been a lot of people who've done it before

2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:01.360
 but essentially it's a route there's different routes there's one kind of main one that's done

2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:06.320
 for like the that is used as the record route more or less that you go from san francisco to

2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:11.440
 new york and essentially you live out of an rv uh while you're running so you run as much as you

2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:16.240
 can during the day then you go to bed at night and then you get up and do it again and you're

2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:22.320
 you're handling all the logistics and the process of trying to make sure you can get up the next day

2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:26.320
 and do again what you did the day before which is going to be the biggest difference so for me

2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:32.000
 i've done all single day ultra marathons where you're going to wring yourself dry at knowing the

2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:35.520
 next day or week or however long you need you're going to be able to just kind of like shut

2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:39.760
 everything down and let everything catch back up whereas with this like you know you're doing it

2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:44.080
 again and again again yeah and you know the record is by a guy named p costa who averaged just over

2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:50.960
 72 miles a day finished in 42 days six hours and 30 minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73 miles

2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:55.920
 and then like next day again next day again just knowing every day when you finish you spend a whole

2:12:55.920 --> 2:12:58.880
 day running and then okay i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna wake up in the morning i'm gonna have to do

2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:04.000
 this again and then you know have that happen for six weeks and that's if it goes very well

2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.880
 so luck i assume is a big part of this yeah for sure i mean there's just so many variables that

2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:12.960
 are uncontrollable on this type of an experience just because i mean you go over the sierras maybe

2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:18.320
 you hit a storm you know you try to time it most people do it in sep start in september so you

2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:23.920
 can get over the mountain passes without a big storm coming through uh but then also get to the

2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:28.480
 east coast before it's like the middle of winter so like september early september start is kind

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:33.280
 of ideal but you can you know i mean pete was very fortunate from a weather standpoint i think

2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:36.640
 he made one big mistake he got a little too aggressive beginning had to take a full day off

2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:42.640
 so he actually averaged from a moving day standpoint closer to 75 miles per day um but

2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:46.560
 yeah i mean there's going to be things that i can't prepare for won't know it's going to happen

2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:51.680
 you know a lot of that will get a lot of the logistical stuff will get leaned on with the crew

2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:56.000
 so that's i mean that's the hardest part right now is just like getting all that put together

2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.400
 where it's like okay i need to have the rv ready i need to have all the stuff and we need to have

2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:05.280
 the places figured out where we're going to stop and and the people that can you know dedicate

2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:09.760
 that much time to an activity like that you know there's a lot of moving parts even before you

2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:14.960
 start the adventure itself when are you see you're taking the san francisco to new york yeah and when

2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:20.080
 are you doing the the run september 1st is when uh you know barring anything like catastrophic

2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:24.160
 between now and then it's really exciting but i mean this is incredible so you you'll probably

2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:28.320
 have a bunch of people just randomly running with you are people going to be tracking where you're

2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:32.800
 located yeah so i'll be documenting everything because i mean my hope is that i'm doing it

2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:37.840
 primarily to raise awareness for fight for the forgotten justin wren's charity uh but with that

2:14:37.840 --> 2:14:44.080
 said i think i am capable of uh if i have a good experience uh you know chasing the record or going

2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:49.600
 after the record or at least getting close to it so oh shit so you're gonna try to beat this record

2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:54.720
 yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go out with the i'm gonna structure the process in a way that leaves

2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:59.360
 that door open is the way i would describe it i'm gonna try not to do anything that would potentially

2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:04.800
 put it in a situation where that becomes the primary goal just because i want to make sure

2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:08.720
 that the reason i decided to do in the first place was for fight for the forgotten so i want

2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:13.040
 to make sure that i don't end up two thirds of the way across the country with a broken leg and i'm

2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:20.800
 like hey guys uh i guess the donation button's turned off so focus on like don't sacrifice that

2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:26.960
 right that goal but also there's a community aspect to it that i feel like are you going to

2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:34.320
 i mean so you're going to document and post yeah but are you going to also is there a safety

2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:39.520
 perspective here it's like the forest gum thing you might have large numbers of crowds that run

2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:43.760
 along with you for a while yeah are you worried about that kind of thing i wouldn't say i'm

2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:47.760
 worried about i mean i think there's probably there's remote enough spots along the way where

2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:52.320
 you'll get some alone time more more likely i don't necessarily mind if people want to jump in

2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:56.560
 there'll there'll be some people that will definitely want to do that and and they can come

2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:01.200
 in and but the reality is like it's probably not going to be a scenario where there's like

2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:06.960
 you know 40 people following me at all times you say that now yeah you never know just wait for

2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:13.920
 this podcast yeah and then if joe finds out you're doing this then we're in trouble all right so um

2:16:13.920 --> 2:16:18.800
 i mean what are the things that you think will be the hardest for you and also like how do you

2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:25.360
 train for this kind of thing um and what yeah what are the hardest things you anticipate how do you

2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:30.240
 train for them yeah so the way i'm looking at this is it's much less about performance from

2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:37.680
 the traditional sense where i need to be able to be x fit i think i need to be injury proof that's

2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:43.680
 what's going to be a detriment if you think about it like if i manage to average nine minute mile

2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:51.520
 pace for a day that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time frame so i'll easily have 12 hours

2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:57.760
 of moving time per day um nine minute pace i think is slow enough that it's not an unreasonable clip

2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:03.200
 so like when you i mean obviously there's things that slow you down or i'll probably take walking

2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:07.520
 breaks you know stopping breaks you got to stay on top of nutrition that's the other big thing too i'm

2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:11.920
 you know probably eating like anywhere between 10 to 15 000 calories a day which is you know i can

2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:15.600
 probably count on my hand a couple of occasions where i've eaten that much in my life so now i

2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:19.920
 got to do that for six plus weeks in a row and you don't want any having a stomach problem i'm

2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:25.040
 trying to try to minimize the amount of stomach problems so you would you estimate about 12 to 13

2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:29.920
 to 14 hours of running every day yeah that's probably like from from the first step to the

2:17:29.920 --> 2:17:35.040
 last step it'll probably be somewhere around like say 14 hours 13 hours or something like that would

2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:40.320
 be a pretty good estimate and then getting rest and so and then minimizing the risk of injury

2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:46.000
 which could be as small as like like literally uneven surfaces resulting to like stepping the

2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:51.200
 wrong way i mean that's going to be a lot of steps yeah yeah uh huh so the probability of injury are

2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:55.600
 you worried about that kind of stuff is can you strengthen the ankles or those kinds of things

2:17:55.600 --> 2:18:00.560
 that prevent yeah possibility of injury and that's that's where i'm putting a lot of my focus in is

2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:06.160
 i think like just being running fit is going to be like generally speaking is going to be

2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.080
 important i'm going to i think just from a lifetime of running is going to be a huge advantage

2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:16.960
 a lot of these like kind of like mechanical movements are going to be very established

2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:21.760
 it's just going to be about can i tolerate that volume of it there i think that i'm doing more

2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.520
 strength work i think this is something where it's like you know maybe adding five pounds of

2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:29.280
 lower body muscle is going to be an advantage versus a disadvantage when you're looking at

2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:33.760
 power weight ratio because i just don't really don't i don't i never need to be running a 648

2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:40.160
 mile for this adventure um and i so i'm looking at that i'm doing a lot more of that stuff focusing

2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:46.480
 on that the training is changing a fair bit where it's more polarizing versus kind of being

2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:50.480
 i mean i've always had some polarization in my training but this is even to an extreme where

2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:55.920
 like i'm going to do some simulations where uh you know i go out and do two or three days where i

2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:00.560
 target the exact thing i will be doing on the transcon you were on instagram posting about

2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:05.920
 these simulated runs so you legitimately like trying to perfectly copy what would happen in

2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:11.520
 one two or three day segment on that run yeah just to kind of start to weed out where are the

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:18.240
 potential problems so let's say i do a two or three day simulation where i'm averaging 70 miles a day

2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:23.520
 and i find out at the end of three days there's a really weak spot here um i need to address that or

2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:28.240
 i need to find a way to make that not a weak spot i think that's the only way to really get as close

2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:33.360
 as you can to avoiding injury have you done that yet have you done a two day 70 mile like even that's

2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:37.040
 incredibly difficult i haven't yet i'm going to build up to it because that's the other thing too

2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:41.920
 is like i don't think you want to be so aggressive with that where you get injured trying to figure

2:19:41.920 --> 2:19:47.520
 out how not to get injured uh so i'll i'll what i'm going to start what i just started last week

2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:52.720
 is i've uh it looks really weird on my training schedule because like last week i ran almost 150

2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:57.040
 miles but i took two days off so it's like usually for me to get to 150 miles that's a seven day

2:19:57.040 --> 2:20:02.640
 training week uh so that's the way i'm doing it like i did i did a day where i did uh you know

2:20:02.640 --> 2:20:08.400
 two like just over 20 milers separated with by just a couple hours and within that couple hours

2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:12.960
 i did like a three mile walk the following morning i woke up and ran i think it was like

2:20:12.960 --> 2:20:17.360
 just over 36 miles first thing in the morning just to get an idea of just like kind of like

2:20:17.360 --> 2:20:21.840
 what is it like to be i mean this was in phoenix too so it was 100 degrees for the majority of that

2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:27.680
 just suffer then rest yeah suffer again how that feels there's enough precedent with this sort of

2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:32.720
 an activity where like everyone i've talked to so far has told me like there is going to be like

2:20:32.720 --> 2:20:36.480
 this kind of like gradual decline in the early stages where you're just like okay it's getting

2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:41.280
 worse it's getting worse it's getting worse and you hit a point where you're just like it hits

2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:46.320
 kind of rock bottom and then like it starts to kind of gradually improve so you kind of have to

2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:52.320
 let yourself get it's weird i think i can maybe eliminate i'm trying to find a way to eliminate

2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:57.600
 some of that by doing the simulations whereas i from what i've seen i haven't seen a lot of people

2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:02.640
 do the simulation route yet i've seen people just do like a lot of training and then say like okay

2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:07.920
 i'll spend the first seven to ten days adapting to this and then i'll get comfortable within this

2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:13.040
 environment and be fine whereas i'm going to try to get to a point where like some of that is

2:21:13.040 --> 2:21:16.960
 already kind of cleared up before i start but not so much that i'm like adding like an extra

2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:22.400
 central week to the trip with worth of running what do you think will be the hardest simulator

2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:27.280
 run leading up to like will you do three days yeah i think i'll probably try to do three days

2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:32.880
 somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each will be kind of like the goal will that be in august do

2:21:32.880 --> 2:21:37.520
 you think how close to yeah i would like it to be in august like early august would be ideal i think

2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:40.880
 like maybe the first week in august because that gives me kind of three weeks to let things kind

2:21:40.880 --> 2:21:46.080
 of settle down from that but then it's crazy this is incredible it's it's actually interesting

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:50.560
 because like if i did let's say i did the simulation now um the problem with that is

2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:55.440
 like the adaptations from just like the breakdown and the strengthening would likely be gone unless

2:21:55.440 --> 2:22:02.080
 i did it again uh so i want to inch up to it so that like and get close enough to the starting

2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:07.280
 date so that i'm still kind of like you know holding on to that adaptation when i start it

2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:12.960
 so then those first few days maybe aren't quite as miserable and you said uh if everything goes

2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:18.080
 amazing and you're challenging the record it'll be like a 42 day run yeah so that's what the record

2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:23.520
 is almost exactly six weeks and that's at 72 and a half miles per day so will you be posting online

2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:28.960
 and like yeah instagram's gonna be a big one i think i might do a few like youtube stuff along

2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:35.600
 the way too um yeah i'm still ironing out exactly how much i think at minimum i'll do i'll do some

2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:39.520
 instagram stuff i think i'll go live on instagram a few times during the day when i take like walking

2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:45.520
 breaks uh partly just to kind of i think keeping people i mean it stays true to the the goal of

2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:52.320
 raising awareness but it also i find when you bring people in there is an added pressure to

2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:57.600
 that but there's also this sense that i've learned from the treadmill experience since we had like

2:22:57.600 --> 2:23:01.840
 a pretty big production for that in the sense that i mean as much as you can turn on a camera

2:23:01.840 --> 2:23:07.280
 in your own house but like the i remember thinking we had like 30 people lined up to

2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:12.080
 come in and guest speak during that and there's points of that where i was like you know you get

2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:15.680
 that voice we talked about the beginning where it's like you know maybe you could quit like

2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:19.840
 you really need to run 100 miles on a treadmill is this really going to be valuable for you

2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:23.760
 and then you think about oh you know what there's uh you know courtney dewalter one of the best

2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:29.600
 female ultra runners to ever exist is taken in the 30 minutes to an hour out of her day

2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:36.560
 to come on in two hours to you know help me you know amplify this event and do i really want to

2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:39.920
 be sending emails out to these people saying hey guys i know you were gracious enough to

2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:43.280
 block out time of your day you know i think there's a little bit of that to do where you're

2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:47.280
 like you're you're you're jumping in with the community that is following along and saying

2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:52.000
 here's how things are going show them the best the worst and everything between and then ultimately

2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:55.200
 have that hold you accountable a little bit too it's like hard to get up in the morning and not

2:23:55.200 --> 2:24:01.040
 go back out i don't know how you are but i had to uh whenever i did any kind of physical stuff

2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:08.480
 like the 48 hour challenge or just any kind of running i hated turning on the camera yeah i hated

2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:13.280
 it like because you have to like smile and be friendly and stuff oh i'm just gonna be super

2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:19.440
 miserable if i'm miserable well that's it so like exactly in some sense that's what people

2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:24.720
 you know we're gonna get a happy zac or an angry exactly it's like you're making bets

2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:31.920
 and i'm sure there'll be some days maybe not many maybe very few where you're truly happy with

2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:38.800
 yourself like for some weird ecstatic reason maybe if you get over the hump whatever that you mentioned

2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:44.640
 that this dip i mean it's it's fascinating how many how much suffering this actually entails

2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:50.080
 i wonder well and one thing i'm gonna definitely try to leverage to my advantage and one of the

2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:55.360
 reasons why i think fight for the forgotten was the charity that really triggered me to decide to

2:24:55.360 --> 2:25:00.480
 do this the transcontinental route was something i learned about early in my ultra running career

2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:04.320
 and i thought to myself i want to do that someday but it was one of those kind of far off distance

2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:08.080
 things that had never really like actualized in your mind until you put a date down or

2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:11.200
 you know mention it on the joe rogan experience or something like that

2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:17.280
 when then it then it's like people want to know when is this happening and uh um you know what i

2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:23.920
 try to think about is you know the reason justin identified the pygmy tribe was because they were

2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:28.400
 super forgotten where you know we think about just like some of these third world countries where

2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:34.960
 it's a scenario of like some people it's easy for us here in the us to think to ourselves well why

2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:39.760
 don't they just industrialize why don't they just like you know start to innovate a bit why are they

2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:45.920
 so primitive what's wrong with them and in reality like when you take uh when you scale things down

2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:52.160
 to the degree where you need the entire day because of the situation you're in just to take

2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:57.760
 care of your basic needs of water and food you never get the opportunity to even build a real

2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:03.360
 like establishment or you know a build on that like you need you need the free time or you need

2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:08.720
 a portion of your population to have the free time available to innovate and the pygmy tribe just

2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:12.960
 hadn't had that historically in fact they weren't even considered humans by like the local government

2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:17.200
 for quite some time and you know the people that really pay the price in some of these situations

2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:21.200
 are the women because they're the ones that get saddled with like the water gathering and things

2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:26.080
 like that so the reason that justin picked wells to build was because he thought to himself if we

2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:32.000
 can get them wells then now these women don't spend all day walking and carrying water now they

2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:36.400
 can just get that water and now we have half the population freed up for other things now maybe they

2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:41.520
 can start farms they can build some housing and stuff like that and it just it exponentially

2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:47.760
 improves once you take care of some of those big key early things so when i'm thinking about like

2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:51.360
 you know do i really need to go out here and travel another 12 hours a day my mind is going

2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:55.920
 to hopefully go to well if one of those women woke up in the pygmy tribe one morning deciding you

2:26:55.920 --> 2:27:00.960
 know what do i really need to go get water today well yeah you do you really do have to yeah you're

2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:07.120
 running for that uh huh yeah and that that will give you fuel hopefully but yeah yeah i mean the

2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:12.800
 reality is always there where i don't have to do it like they do have to do it so you know but i

2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:20.080
 think just keeping that perspective it it puts us back to the beginning where it's this is one of

2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:25.680
 those situations where i think it's like uh a no quit situation you have to put yourself in a no

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:31.920
 quit situation here because it's uh you know it's just bigger than you i can't wait to see like the

2:27:31.920 --> 2:27:38.640
 dark places you go i mean there's some yeah the the quit situations and hopefully we get to have

2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:44.000
 a glimpse of those because i think those are really inspiring when somebody is uh both gets

2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:49.680
 broken by them because you know how tough you are but also is almost broken and overcomes it i mean

2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:54.320
 that's just fascinating stories i can't wait i i know does joan know you're doing this by the way

2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:59.440
 yeah i sent him i sent him a note a while back because he was the first spot i mentioned it on

2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:03.520
 so i think he knows i'm not sure if he's following along about the exact starting date or not you will

2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:11.920
 know this is great you probably think you're a crazy uh mfr for doing this but uh i think you

2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:16.800
 love it and i think i love it and i think the world will love it ridiculous question who's the

2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:25.920
 greatest endurance runner or endurance athlete of all time oh that's a good question um i think

2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:36.400
 i'd probably go maybe two directions here uh i think uh heli geber lassie is one of the best

2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:46.320
 in my opinion because just i mean 27 world records like like not all the different distance but like

2:28:46.320 --> 2:28:52.880
 braking and rebraking and that sort of stuff um i mean he ran two what was it 203

2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:58.720
 359 before the shoe technology came in that is estimated at anywhere between a two to eight

2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:04.160
 percent performance advantage i'm talking about a two hour marathon 203 yep two hour three minutes

2:29:04.160 --> 2:29:10.080
 yeah so he did that with the old shoe technology which uh essentially dates back to anything if

2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:16.240
 if you were a nike athlete it could date back to as early as i think early 2016 is when the first

2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:21.120
 prototype started showing up uh so if you're before that in your career you were using you're

2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:27.280
 guaranteed to be using the old shoe technology um and i mean just the range of it too and uh

2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:32.320
 yeah it's it's hard i mean there's there it's uh is he a marathon runner purely

2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:36.000
 no he did everything that's why i pick him i think because he he he went everywhere

2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:40.960
 everything from the 800 and is like at a national level yeah at a national level i don't he wasn't

2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:46.560
 competing at like olympics or anything in the 800 but he was he was mostly like 5k to marathon

2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:52.800
 um yeah yeah so just incredible i mean i i could go a totally different direction too i think like

2:29:52.800 --> 2:29:57.600
 steve prefontaine stands out in as an american runner just because if you look at it outside

2:29:57.600 --> 2:30:06.160
 of just like performances and stuff like that i think um he basically like you can't find an

2:30:06.160 --> 2:30:13.760
 american male runner who probably didn't get some motivation or some catalyst into their running

2:30:13.760 --> 2:30:19.120
 journey from a prefontaine story or what would you say is inspiring about prefontaine uh like from the

2:30:19.120 --> 2:30:24.880
 philosophy from the technique from his story uh i think there's a few things i mean there's a lot

2:30:24.880 --> 2:30:30.320
 of things which is why he is who he is it's uh one was just his attitude about it where um he wasn't

2:30:30.320 --> 2:30:36.000
 like this picture ask runner uh i mean he was obviously talented but you know you have the

2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:40.160
 perfect story of like he wanted to be good at something you like most american kids tried

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:47.120
 football was no hard work was gonna get prefontaine starting in varsity for football starts running

2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:52.080
 fell in love with the mile uh his college coach told him no you're not gonna be a miler you're

2:30:52.080 --> 2:30:57.280
 gonna be a 5k guy and he popularized the 5k in the united states or three mile in some cases

2:30:57.840 --> 2:31:03.760
 and uh i mean he the way he would race i think is what really made him interesting for folks

2:31:03.760 --> 2:31:08.480
 where he would he was just like all guts runner where he's like he's like i mean one of his famous

2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:12.880
 quotes was like if you if you beat me you're gonna have to bleed to do it because he's gonna be an

2:31:12.880 --> 2:31:18.080
 all guts race in in a sport where it gets very tactical at times especially at the like national

2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:23.120
 or i shouldn't say national but at the like competition level the championship level where

2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:26.960
 it's like kind of more of a sit and kick approach a lot of times where everyone's kind of waiting

2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:30.960
 for someone to make a move like pre was gonna make a move really early yeah so this idea of

2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:36.480
 leading from the front which i guess is tactically really a bad idea well from a

2:31:36.480 --> 2:31:45.040
 from a running a pr standpoint it's a bad idea in most cases but so a race i guess is not just about

2:31:45.040 --> 2:31:49.920
 the pr so race winning in a lot of cases and that's what he thought was going to put him in

2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:53.520
 the best advantage to win i think it's just the run from the front i mean what what do you because

2:31:53.520 --> 2:32:00.000
 you mentioned this uh the 100 mile you ran you were in second place and then in 90s you were

2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:06.640
 able to get to the first place how hard is it to run when you're in first place you know i think

2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:11.200
 this is really different some people thrive under it where it's like for them i mean like i talked

2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:15.520
 about jim walsh before i think he loves being in the front if he's in the front he loves it that's

2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:20.320
 where he's excited that's where he knows he's he's doing what he's doing where he's pushing his limits

2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:25.600
 and things like that uh pre was probably the same way and i think there's other folks who are much

2:32:25.600 --> 2:32:30.480
 more comfortable kind of saying let's let things settle down here a little bit and then i'll make

2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:35.520
 my move when it's time to make my move or they think of it as and this is a very important i

2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:40.800
 think lesson for for the average ultra runner is just like knowing what you're capable of

2:32:40.800 --> 2:32:47.280
 is going to be an important piece to the puzzle because you can like you you you can try to say

2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:52.240
 i want to run faster than i'm capable of in an early part of a hundred miler but then you're

2:32:52.240 --> 2:32:56.320
 going to pay for it at the end so really unless you're trying to go for the win and that's a

2:32:56.320 --> 2:33:00.400
 tactic that you think is going to produce a win versus trying to run your fastest time you got

2:33:00.400 --> 2:33:04.800
 to run within yourself within your parameters obviously there's a big question about where

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:08.720
 those parameters are in a lot of cases which makes ultra marathon even more interesting because it's

2:33:08.720 --> 2:33:12.640
 like there's so much unknown about it it's like well maybe you can go faster and we just don't

2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:17.760
 know yet so there's in the face of that uncertainty there's something admirable like it was with

2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:25.040
 prefontaine where you take the risk and run faster than you know you you think you might be able to

2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:32.320
 run in terms of pace that you can hold so push the pace that's possible yeah explore the unknown

2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:37.600
 explore it's like a pioneer spirit right yeah you know the next frontier kind of a thing but

2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:42.720
 i mean prefontaine also there's other angles with him too where he was like in the amateur era where

2:33:42.720 --> 2:33:47.200
 to be an olympian you couldn't be pro so he's turning down i mean the guy was on food stamps

2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:52.000
 and living in a trailer because he wanted to run at the olympics and there was a lot of like

2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:56.160
 politics involved with not being able to take take sponsorship money and things like that which

2:33:56.160 --> 2:34:03.680
 has changed since then but so he was huge in the movement for that to kind of like you know have a

2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:09.840
 situation where now as an athlete you can finish in most cases finish college sign a big contract

2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:14.320
 with you know a sponsor and then also still compete in the olympic games and go to the events

2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:18.000
 that are actually ones that are going to likely catapult your career and most of the olympic

2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:22.080
 distance endurance events so so he just revolutionized the sport and then to add even

2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:27.040
 more flavor to the whole thing i mean he died a very premature death he got a car accident and

2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:33.760
 died before he would have likely probably medaled at the olympics so he and there is a tragedy the

2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:40.800
 fact that he didn't yeah well he was fourth place at the olympics the prior his first go of it and

2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:44.160
 it was kind of one of those things where it's like fourth place at the olympics is the first man

2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.320
 looking out of the first woman looking out and for a guy that had as much hype as him i think

2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:52.640
 like a medal was something he really wanted to take home with him there and especially how that

2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:58.400
 race went i mean yeah i don't know it's it's it's tragic the whole thing but that's one of the things

2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:04.880
 that makes olympics amazing is the tragedy of it like one race decides the story of a lifetime which

2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:11.040
 is like yeah that's why it's that's why it's amazing even if a lot of people get hurt because of it

2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:19.680
 tragedy makes the the triumph special right yeah and well it makes i mean it makes life

2:35:19.680 --> 2:35:23.920
 like a movie almost exactly you know if everything's all sunshine and rainbows then

2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:28.560
 it's not as entertaining to watch yeah there's no adversity to overcome you mentioned shoe technology

2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:34.880
 how much has shoe technology advanced through the past few decades how much has it changed running

2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:41.040
 generally but also running like ultra marathon running i would say an ultra running it's had

2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:49.200
 much of a less of an impact because ultra running is still heavily skewed towards the trails so the

2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:53.360
 technology at least from what we know isn't necessarily translating over to these like

2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:57.840
 massive varied terrain certainly not the technical terrain and things like that now on road races

2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:03.760
 flat stuff like the track stuff the roads the run i guess you a runnable trail um where it's

2:36:03.760 --> 2:36:08.720
 like basically crushed limestone more or less uh you definitely get an advantage from it it's uh

2:36:08.720 --> 2:36:16.880
 and essentially what what happened um is in this probably dated back actually before 2015 uh you

2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:24.080
 know nike decided well their their their uh development team uh was ahead of the curve they've

2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:30.000
 developed this new foam they call like a pibak foam uh and they they realized that like when you

2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:35.440
 step down into a shoe the reason like uh racers a lot of times would wear these flats because they're

2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:41.360
 trying to take out any of that lost energy into the foam in the shoe well this foam that nike

2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:47.360
 came out with is so good that it actually returns way more energy than the average foam did to the

2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:51.040
 point where like when they test these things on like force plate treadmills and things like that

2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:55.520
 it's like a depending on the person's gait and some of things like a two to eight percent

2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:00.560
 improvement in performance i mean we've seen records just across the board get broken since

2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:07.600
 this came out all distances basically yeah yeah i i think from at least from the 5k up through

2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:13.200
 the marathon and i mean we've seen some insane improvements in the marathon i think like uh the

2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:20.400
 women's marathon went from what was considered relatively untouchable like 216 to a 214 and

2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:26.400
 i mean like it was like 218 was like just world class like if you could run a 218 marathon as a

2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:30.640
 woman that was like i mean it still is to a degree but then you know now you have someone run a 214

2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:36.640
 like that's a huge and you attributed a lot of that to the the shoe yeah yeah i think there's

2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:40.080
 probably other things that come in mind too like now that people know there's a performance

2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:44.240
 advantage from a mechanical standpoint it's also a confidence thing where it's like oh now i can

2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:48.640
 probably try going five seconds per mile faster and maybe they could have anyway and they just

2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:52.400
 now they think they can so they are so there's probably a little bit of that that's just adding

2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:57.360
 to it do you think there's a lot of extra innovation that's still possible like what yeah

2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:02.240
 if you could do this kind of big leap uh with a little innovation of foam is there other stuff

2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:07.200
 that you can do or further innovation materials that make up the foam yeah so they can definitely

2:38:07.200 --> 2:38:12.880
 go much more advantage they put a cap on it essentially so there was a there's also a carbon

2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:16.880
 plate element to this too where they put like this carbon plate in there in between the foam

2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:24.160
 so like i believe when when kipchiki broke well when they did that that kind of uh uh the sub

2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:30.160
 two hour project he actually had on a shoe if i'm not mistaken that never got to market because

2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:35.040
 they put down some parameters on it after uh before it that one came to market where it was

2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:40.000
 actually like stacked up to i can't remember how many millimeters it was an insane amount and they

2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:44.640
 had like i think maybe even three layer plates in there and that was a nike shoe he was wearing yeah

2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:50.960
 yeah so what makes it kind of controversial or difficult is nike came out with these prototypes

2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:55.040
 so a prototype for people don't understand shoes like these these companies they'll develop a shoe

2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:59.520
 and it usually takes like somewhere in the neighborhood of like probably 18 months to hit

2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:05.120
 the market so if you're like a sponsored athlete or work for the company you can get your hands

2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:09.920
 on these shoes before they actually come to market so we had an issue i think this wasn't

2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:14.880
 necessarily as big of an issue in the ultra running community but uh in the track and field olympic

2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:20.480
 distance stuff was a big issue because you had nike athletes having these prototype shoes before

2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:24.400
 anyone could get them and then you had athletes were sponsored by these other brands who couldn't

2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:29.760
 wear them even if even when they did come to market so then we had this like chase to catch up

2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:34.080
 where uh other companies are starting to make their own version of it and now we're getting to

2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:41.600
 a point where most companies have a version of that shoe um but we had a huge transition phase

2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:47.760
 that impacted the olympics big time i mean think of here here's a here's an example of it uh there's

2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:55.280
 a there was a an athlete cara goucher um she was not she was a nike athlete wasn't uh when they

2:39:55.280 --> 2:40:01.680
 came out with this shoe and she ran the olympic trial marathon and got fourth place the first

2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:07.680
 person out and uh two of the people had ever had that shoe on and she was maybe a minute or two like

2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:12.320
 i'd have to look to see exactly but it was within the the performance advantage range and so you

2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:17.840
 could argue that she was the first person in modern running to lose an olympic spot due to

2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:24.000
 a technological disadvantage wow and and it's like i mean it's one of those yeah i mean it's one of

2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:30.720
 those things where like um it's it's a transition right so there's gonna be bumpy road and there's

2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:36.800
 gonna be people that get caught in that transition that it's unfortunate for but it's also like uh

2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:41.680
 you know once everything does catch up and every shoe company has a version of this there's still

2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:46.080
 problems i mean these are incredibly expensive shoes it's like a 250 shoe so it's like at what

2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:51.600
 point do you tell like a wealthy family with a high school kid that you know you can get that

2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:55.680
 250 shoe but then you go and this kid's family can barely afford a pair of shoes for them much

2:40:55.680 --> 2:41:03.040
 less a 250 parachute like where do we draw that line and that sort of stuff um also just here's

2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:07.280
 the other big one like let's i mean two to eight percent is a massive range what if you're on the

2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:12.080
 two percent versus someone's on the eight percent you know chances are if you're you know blowing

2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:16.960
 a record out of the water you're probably closer to that high end percentage versus someone who's

2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:21.520
 maybe getting incremental gains you're probably closer to that lower end so is it fair to have

2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:25.920
 a piece of equipment that has that big of a range when we're talking about less than a percent

2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:30.640
 determining these races when all is held constant those are fascinating like philosophical questions

2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:35.760
 that i think it's nice to solve that for the shoe or to raise those questions for a shoe

2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:40.160
 because the more complicated place where they will be raised is probably like genetics

2:41:40.160 --> 2:41:45.520
 genetic engineering all those kinds of things yeah it'll get a lot more complicated so it's

2:41:45.520 --> 2:41:49.040
 nice when you have like a particular piece of technology that's just like right there it's

2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:55.120
 a shoe we can understand it we can study it right we may be coming on the precipice of like

2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:59.840
 human powered sport performance is no longer being something that we like look at as this

2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:05.520
 like pinnacle of uh like i guess i don't maybe entertainment's the wrong word but like is that

2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:10.400
 a pursuit you know do we end up just going a different direction i mean i think it's like

2:42:10.400 --> 2:42:14.000
 it's so hard for us to think about that right now because it's so part of like the culture

2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:19.520
 and the lifestyle of the average person where like sport is a hobby of theirs as well as a

2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:25.440
 passion to follow and it's like how complicated does it need to get before people lose that

2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:31.120
 interest and and there could be a future where most of the olympics is esports somebody told me

2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:36.960
 that esports is in the olympics i've been meaning to look this up which is you know like what video

2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:44.240
 so video games are in the olympics yeah yeah it could be as like a trial that they're doing um

2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:51.120
 yeah if this is true i'm trying in real time look it up but if this esports joining olympics in 2024

2:42:51.840 --> 2:42:59.760
 wow so that could be just a that could be a fun side thing but it could be a first step into a

2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:03.680
 complete transformation what sports mean yeah because you can control video games better than

2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:09.840
 you control for genetics and humans well and in reality we've been dealing with this problem in

2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:14.160
 other areas just with the performance enhancing side of things with drugs and all that stuff too

2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:19.040
 and anyway that that conversation's flared back up with track and field too where we are seeing a lot

2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:23.680
 of records get broken a lot of it probably is to shoot technology but you know in 2020 with the

2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:28.800
 covid stuff you have all these out of competition testing protocols that a lot of these top tier

2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:34.880
 olympic athletes are getting uh to try to eliminate like if you just do inter competition

2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:40.080
 testing like there's potential for people to do things that are uh going to give them a

2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:45.520
 performance advantage but not going to show up on that test on the day of or after their race where

2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:50.320
 now you have these like limitations of being able to test so do we have a like a group of athletes

2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:54.880
 now who decide oh i'm not going to get tested in 2020 do the covid restrictions this is the time

2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:59.360
 to dope up and then you know hit some stride and some records and then you taper back off when they

2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:03.360
 get this thing fired back up again and so there may be some of that as well and i mean that's

2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:07.600
 always been an ongoing problem and yeah so the boost you get from performance enhancing drugs

2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:11.680
 could be tying you relative to the stuff we have in the future right yeah so you might be the last

2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:19.680
 generation of like natural unmodified humans that were running and who knows maybe that's already

2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:25.760
 over who knows who's who's modified that that's that's true you might we might be living through

2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:33.360
 that transition to the new nike shoe but broadly defined yeah so you'll be uh in some sense in in

2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:40.000
 the history books as uh humans used to run without any modifications they used to destroy their body

2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:46.000
 and let it recover and then do it again and they used to be impressed with a with an 11 hour

2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:54.320
 an 100 mile time when we could do it in under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but nevertheless it

2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:01.600
 is incredible the four mile the four minute mile was incredibly impressive uh the i really love

2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:09.680
 the 11 hour mark for the 100 miler and the two hour marathon by most people um for the longest

2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:14.640
 time will start to be impossible you know there's still people that think it's impossible with under

2:45:14.640 --> 2:45:23.920
 certain constraints so uh uh eliot kipchoge of kenya as you mentioned ran a one hour 59 minute

2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:32.400
 40 second marathon but he had like you said the prototype shoes and he had the the the pace

2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:37.680
 setters yeah i don't know how essential that is but it seems quite essential do you think it's

2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:43.280
 possible first of all what do you think about that accomplishment uh and he is one of the greatest if

2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:47.840
 not the greatest marathon runners of all time what do you think about that accomplishment and

2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:53.120
 do you think it's possible to run a two hour marathon without any assistance yeah i mean

2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:57.520
 i think yeah there's no question about it regardless of technology he's world class if

2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:06.640
 not the best um the i think he i think he could go under two or someone equivalent to him could

2:46:06.640 --> 2:46:14.080
 go under two hours with with the shoe technology probably what it'll take is it'll take a fast

2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:20.400
 course a course that has like very few tangents because like you know turning on a course they

2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:25.360
 estimate adds about a percent to the to the distance so you know when we're talking about

2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:29.440
 a marathon you're getting up to like a quarter mile extra running you know that alone could

2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:34.640
 potentially put you down near near too flat based on what you know we're seeing because i mean

2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:41.680
 kip jaggi he's got a was it 201 40 i believe is his actual world record where it's actually like

2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:47.360
 you know certified so i mean he's right on the door knocking knocking on the door there um yeah

2:46:47.360 --> 2:46:51.680
 the prototype he had since then they put in a regulation where you can't stack a shoe for the

2:46:51.680 --> 2:46:56.400
 roads more than 40 millimeters so you can only have so much of that energy returning foam and

2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:02.160
 you can only have i think one carbon plate in there now uh so that puts a little bit of a

2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:08.240
 ceiling on that technological thing uh but but who knows what else will come out that and and

2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:13.040
 and to be honest who comes out with it because the fact that nike came out with this technology

2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:17.760
 is the reason why it's being allowed to be used if that would have been like you know another

2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:22.480
 running company that that came out with it i'm sure the the regulations would have been slapped

2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:25.360
 down on it immediately and they would have probably just thrown it out all together would

2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:32.240
 have been this politics yeah oh yeah well and i mean it's it you can go you can go super like

2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:37.920
 you know negative with that and say like hey like this is like this is terrible or this is like super

2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:43.360
 nefarious when in reality it's like you know you have a company that has you know billions of

2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:48.160
 dollars and is interested enough in the sport that otherwise doesn't generate a ton of revenue

2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:55.040
 to you know pick up a big tab and support like uh you know track and field and things like that but

2:47:55.040 --> 2:48:00.960
 you know with that you know you you want to be the guy who says yeah thanks for the millions

2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:06.320
 and millions of dollars but we're gonna all those years and money you spent on that phone

2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:11.200
 yeah you wasted it we're not gonna let you use it but you know if you're another company who uh

2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:17.040
 you know revolutionizes the sport in potentially a negative way uh you know maybe maybe you say no

2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:21.920
 to them so it gets interesting that's the way that's how it always happens yeah yeah there's

2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:25.680
 really no way around i think phil mephiton i think it's him that he wrote a book about a

2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:30.320
 two hour marathon what are the limits how fast could we run and i think he puts it like an hour

2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:35.440
 and 42 minutes something like that or 40 something minutes it's kind of interesting question uh of

2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:41.600
 what are the limits uh do you think do you think we'll just keep pushing the limits of what humans

2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:48.000
 are capable of in the ultras in the marathon is this just like the way yeah the uh the way of

2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:55.200
 sport i think ultra for sure because that is a vastly growing sport and it's there's

2:48:56.320 --> 2:49:02.080
 there's a lot of potential for much bigger popular much pool bigger pool of like talent to pull from

2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:07.760
 uh that could really push the needle down on some of these performances and things like that

2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:13.200
 uh especially as it becomes more popular if if people start realizing or i shouldn't say realizing

2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:17.920
 but if a scenario happens where like oh i'm one of the best endurance athletes in the world i make

2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:21.840
 more money running ultra marathons than i do running the marathon then you know all of a

2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:29.200
 sudden we see every record get broken in a matter of a couple of years uh but the the for the marathon

2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:35.920
 i mean it's gonna get faster i think but like to what degree is so hard to know it's very hard to

2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:40.880
 know and the one hour and 40 minutes seems like that's pretty fast yes that's very fast i mean

2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:47.360
 for folks for some perspective there the current world record is like in the 440s per mile per mile

2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:52.320
 like just to add a little flavor to that you're basically sprinting yeah i mean go out to a track

2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:59.520
 and run one lap as fast as you can and then reflect on what time you get and realize like

2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:07.920
 the world record for the marathon is that is that lap at just over 70 seconds per lap so a minute

2:50:07.920 --> 2:50:15.360
 and 10 just over that but you're doing it 26.2 miles so so over a hundred times it's mind boggling

2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:20.880
 but watching elliot kipchoge just first of all he was like smiling at the end of it so the there's

2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:28.880
 an extreme efficiency here too so he's not he's able to just find the right way to maximize yeah

2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:33.920
 maximize efficiency it makes it look easy i mean that that's true for basically every olympic

2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:40.720
 athlete when you watch gymnasts they kind of make it look easy yeah but there's like tens if not

2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:45.600
 hundreds of thousands of hours behind that training yeah just to be comfortable enough to even attempt

2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:50.880
 some of the moves they do in gymnastics is mind boggling that one is super awesome because uh

2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:57.120
 how tragic it is like one little slip up yeah four years of work and your route it's all gone

2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:02.240
 not just four years of work for many of them a lifetime a lifetime of work and they're teenagers

2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:08.640
 and they're teenagers and they get dedicated everything to it that's that's what makes the

2:51:08.640 --> 2:51:13.120
 pursuits of humans so fascinating we kind of talked about this a little bit already but

2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:18.240
 is there something that stands out to you as one of the hardest things you've had to overcome

2:51:19.040 --> 2:51:23.840
 in all the either training or the competing that you've done has there been moments that

2:51:23.840 --> 2:51:30.160
 kind of stand out where you're proud of yourself that that you were truly tested and you overcame

2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:36.400
 it i think i'd be more inclined just because it stands out to me much bigger than any one like

2:51:36.400 --> 2:51:43.520
 hard decision or outcome i had from a particular race is just like the trajectory of like you know

2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:49.760
 doing what i'm doing now is so much different from what i would have ever expected uh you know

2:51:49.760 --> 2:51:54.080
 i mean i was a talented enough runner where i could make the state meet by my senior year at a

2:51:54.080 --> 2:52:00.160
 small division three school and you know compete at a division three college and be pretty modest

2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:06.800
 talent comparative to my to my peers at the top level of division three to think that like i'd be

2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:13.440
 doing anything that was revolved around running as as an occupation is is uh i still second guess

2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:18.320
 that that's actually occurring makes me wonder about the whole simulation theory thing it's like

2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:25.040
 who's got my joystick and exactly uh but they got cheat codes yeah exactly yeah because i mean i

2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:28.960
 went to school to be a teacher and i really loved that profession i taught for about five years and

2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:33.200
 then i got to a point where you know some of it's just perfect timing too like the sport gained

2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:36.960
 enough popularity where there's enough money in it where like i could start a coaching business i

2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:41.760
 could get sponsorships and things like that and actually look at it and say financially i can make

2:52:41.760 --> 2:52:48.800
 a go of this or at least risk it but there's such a fine line between like deciding to do that or

2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:53.360
 kind of staying comfortable because uh i mean i was at the perfect teaching spot for me i was at

2:52:53.360 --> 2:52:59.120
 this uh like project based learning school and just outside of madison wisconsin loved it um one

2:52:59.120 --> 2:53:02.720
 of the hardest decisions my life to make was to step away from that to pursue running and more

2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:08.720
 holistically um and i mean i almost didn't i had a co teacher who was uh i was thinking myself i

2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:12.080
 knew that was like a decision i was gonna have to make the next few years but it was such an easy

2:53:12.080 --> 2:53:16.800
 decision to say well wait one more year and he was just like he was a little more of a free spirit

2:53:16.800 --> 2:53:21.680
 than i was certainly at the time he's like dude what are you waiting for just go why are you here

2:53:21.680 --> 2:53:26.480
 like like after i told him that he like every time we'd we'd i'd come into i'd come into school the

2:53:26.480 --> 2:53:31.440
 next day and he'd be like why are you still here but i mean that was there's a tongue in cheek for

2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:35.280
 sure but uh but it's hard to know that you're going to be successful right in that kind of

2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:43.200
 leap given your like you know because it's easier when you're like an ultra performer early on but

2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:48.960
 to have the faith that you can accomplish something in some regards it's a blessing in the sense that

2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:56.480
 like uh you know failing would have been fairly predictable right whereas if like you know i always

2:53:56.480 --> 2:54:01.520
 wonder i mean i think of these like especially the big sports like baseball football and basketball

2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:08.960
 and you get you know guys who guys and girls who are like identified in like early high school as

2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:16.080
 being the next and it's like what kind of pressure is that to think like well if i'm not like literally

2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:20.800
 one of the best players in the nba in 10 years i failed yeah it's just mind boggling to think if

2:54:20.800 --> 2:54:25.440
 i'm not one of the best at one of the most competitive sports on the planet in what is an

2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:30.240
 athletic i think an athletic state of an nba basketball player is probably one of the most

2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:36.720
 athletic human beings on the planet and to know like at in a teenage year that your your your

2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:41.680
 your success bar is being the best one of the best in the league or the best ever and that

2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:46.720
 conversation is floating around everywhere you look and see versus being able to kind of quietly

2:54:46.720 --> 2:54:51.200
 fail and go back to teaching this makes it a little more digestible i think you have a little

2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:57.440
 bit of more freedom to be great right nobody's expecting you to be right uh is there from that

2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:04.080
 is there advice you can give to young people today high schoolers college students taking on

2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:10.400
 trying to figure out their career trying to figure out their life advice on how to succeed in either

2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:14.880
 yeah i think uh you know one thing i was always interested when i was teaching was like you'd

2:55:14.880 --> 2:55:19.680
 have these you'd have students who had like interests they had what they were good at and

2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:24.880
 sometimes those ran in in unison with one another other times they didn't and it was always

2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:30.240
 interesting to me when you'd have a student who's like i'm really into like you know guitar or i'm

2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:35.440
 really into skateboarding or something like that where it's like pretty small like success rate on

2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:40.240
 that avenue versus what you could maybe accomplish by focusing on just something like a little more

2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:48.400
 standard and i think like really like besides the likelihood of it becoming something you can turn

2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:52.560
 into a profession or not you should just ask yourself like is this something that i want to

2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:59.120
 spend my free time doing uh and because if it is then you want to keep that in your life because

2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:02.640
 that's something that's rewarding motivating it might be the catalyst that gets you out of

2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:06.880
 bed in the morning and you know go to another job in order to go do that thing afterwards and i think

2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:15.840
 nowadays we're getting to a point where like the your reach ability from even a really small like

2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:22.480
 unmonetized thing previously is now an option where if like you live in a city where there's

2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:25.840
 only two other people interested in your topic of area so you're not gonna be able to turn into a

2:56:25.840 --> 2:56:31.200
 job now with the internet you have the world at your disposal so that two to three people in every

2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:35.840
 town can turn into thousands tens of thousands hundreds of millions of people and if you

2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:40.160
 really focus your time and energy into that thing then you know who knows where you can go and how

2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:43.760
 much more enjoyable your life can be if you're able to turn your career into a passion of yours

2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:50.880
 so i think like that is something i would tell tell people um focus on that see the thing you're

2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:57.760
 good at and you kind of sparks that flame and uh go with that even if society doesn't really want

2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:05.680
 you to uh like it's non traditional uh and the odds are low of like traditionally defined success

2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:11.840
 just do that thing i've struggled with that it's like it was always clear especially like in school

2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:16.640
 there's stuff i'm actually good at and stuff that the world wants me to do right yeah and i kept

2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:22.000
 doing the world wanted me to be a plumber when i took that test my sophomore year but even like

2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:29.120
 like academically just going to university and uh academia there's certain ways even in in i would

2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:35.360
 say even in the thing you want to do the way you do that thing the world will want you to do in a

2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:41.920
 certain way and even just like finding your way of doing that thing is uh is really powerful like

2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:50.480
 for me the way i do research the way i learn is is different than colleagues of mine and i realized

2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:55.680
 i realized that that i really like to follow things i'm passionate about versus sort of the

2:57:55.680 --> 2:58:00.400
 rigor of studying every like the fundamentals all across the board and building up in castle

2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:06.480
 um on the fundamentals like layer upon layer just there's a bunch of details in the way i

2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:11.760
 pursue the very thing that i currently do that's different than others and it took me quite a long

2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:16.720
 time to accept like you don't need to do it the way everyone else is doing it doesn't not everyone

2:58:16.720 --> 2:58:20.800
 else but the majority of people are telling you to do it because one is beneficial to do it

2:58:20.800 --> 2:58:26.000
 different because then you'll more likely stand out and two like why the hell are you doing it

2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:32.080
 the way it's not working for you yeah yeah you know i saw that all the time when i was teaching

2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:37.600
 i was dual certified i was my my certifications were in history and broadfield social studies so

2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:44.320
 like econ uh psychology history all that stuff and then i also had a certification of special

2:58:44.320 --> 2:58:49.200
 education which was you know people think of special education a lot of times as like oh it's

2:58:49.200 --> 2:58:53.200
 the you know the kid who is not smart enough to do the regular thing when reality it's like

2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:58.720
 i mean there is some you know there's obviously like you know like certain things like down

2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:03.360
 syndrome and stuff like that but like there's also like a huge population of groups of both

2:59:03.360 --> 2:59:08.240
 like gifted and talented on one end of the spectrum where they're incredibly smart and

2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:13.360
 they're like the geniuses but for whatever reason the standard method of learning does not click

2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:17.840
 with them does not work with them and then they just need a slightly different path or maybe

2:59:17.840 --> 2:59:22.320
 a drastically different path and they're gonna just flourish and you have kids that end up

2:59:22.320 --> 2:59:27.920
 falling on the other end where you know maybe it's really difficult for them to be able to read at

2:59:27.920 --> 2:59:34.080
 the speed of other students but if you give them this specific direction they can just thrive in

2:59:34.080 --> 2:59:40.400
 a certain area and just seeing that like the you know like that there's multiple ways to do stuff

2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:45.440
 and there's not necessarily one path to the end is i think such an eye opening thing to learn

2:59:45.440 --> 2:59:49.440
 especially if you learn maybe that's what i should answer the question that you asked me with is you

2:59:49.440 --> 2:59:54.240
 know keep an open mind as to what paths are forward and know that you know maybe just because

2:59:55.040 --> 2:59:58.400
 even if you look to your left you know to the right and all your classmates are successful

2:59:58.400 --> 3:00:00.720
 doing it one way it doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be the way for you

3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:05.600
 yeah so that could lend you in eating a meat based diet running across the country

3:00:05.600 --> 3:00:10.960
 uh like the the incredible madman that you are zack i'm a huge fan as i told you many times you're

3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:16.320
 an inspiration to many i'll be there checking in every day if you somehow make it out the starting

3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:22.080
 line on september 1st i know i know joe rogan and millions of others will be as well so i'm excited

3:00:22.080 --> 3:00:25.840
 to see all the suffering that you're going to go through i wish you the best of luck and

3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:29.200
 thank you so much for talking today i really really appreciate it well thanks a bunch of

3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:34.160
 likes it's been a an honor to come on your podcast i've been a fan of it for uh 10 years

3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:39.520
 i've been a fan of it for uh for quite some time and um i thought about wearing a white suit but

3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:46.000
 michael malice already took care of that one so it was well and uh i think it'll be really good

3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:51.360
 for the ratings of this conversation if you end up dying during that run so i'll do my best so

3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:56.480
 the everything that could happen will be positive for for the world you're saying i should try to

3:00:56.480 --> 3:01:02.080
 average 100 miles a day 100 miles well i think you're going to push yourself to again it's not

3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:07.600
 a priority but it's trying to beat that record that's probably going to take everything you have

3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:13.840
 and that that that's truly inspiring i wish you the best of luck man thanks a bunch thanks for
