00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 The following is a conversation with Harry Cliff,

00:03.000 --> 00:05.760
 a particle physicist at the University of Cambridge,

00:05.760 --> 00:09.840
 working on the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment

00:09.840 --> 00:13.000
 that specializes in investigating the slight differences

00:13.000 --> 00:15.280
 between matter and antimatter

00:15.280 --> 00:18.400
 by studying a type of particle called the beauty quark

00:18.400 --> 00:19.880
 or b quark.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.280
 In this way, he's part of the group of physicists

00:22.280 --> 00:25.120
 who are searching for the evidence of new particles

00:25.120 --> 00:26.920
 that can answer some of the biggest questions

00:26.920 --> 00:28.280
 in modern physics.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.840
 He's also an exceptional communicator of science

00:31.840 --> 00:34.880
 with some of the clearest and most captivating explanations

00:34.880 --> 00:37.440
 of basic concepts in particle physicists

00:37.440 --> 00:39.560
 that I've ever heard.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.960
 So when I visited London, I knew I had to talk to him.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.920
 And we did this conversation

00:44.920 --> 00:47.280
 at the Royal Institute Lecture Theatre,

00:47.280 --> 00:50.520
 which has hosted lectures for over two centuries

00:50.520 --> 00:52.120
 from some of the greatest scientists

00:52.120 --> 00:54.160
 and science communicators in history,

00:54.160 --> 00:57.680
 from Michael Faraday to Carl Sagan.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.080
 This conversation was recorded

00:59.080 --> 01:01.240
 before the outbreak of the pandemic.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.440
 For everyone feeling the medical and psychological

01:03.440 --> 01:05.440
 and financial burden of this crisis,

01:05.440 --> 01:07.360
 I'm sending love your way.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.400
 Stay strong.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.560
 We're in this together.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.160
 We'll beat this thing.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.840
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.920
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:15.920 --> 01:18.320
 review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:18.320 --> 01:19.520
 support it on Patreon,

01:19.520 --> 01:21.400
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:21.400 --> 01:25.080
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.120
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

01:27.120 --> 01:28.400
 and never any ads in the middle

01:28.400 --> 01:30.560
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.880
 I hope that works for you

01:31.880 --> 01:35.040
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.480
 Quick summary of the ads.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.000
 Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.280
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

02:01.280 --> 02:04.480
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.800
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

02:06.800 --> 02:09.600
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

02:09.600 --> 02:11.000
 that works behind the scenes

02:11.000 --> 02:13.720
 to create the abstraction of the fractional orders

02:13.720 --> 02:15.800
 is an algorithmic marvel.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.720
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

02:17.720 --> 02:20.200
 for solving a hard problem that in the end

02:20.200 --> 02:22.680
 provides an easy interface that takes a step up

02:22.680 --> 02:25.720
 to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

02:25.720 --> 02:28.560
 making trading more accessible for new investors

02:28.560 --> 02:31.480
 and diversification much easier.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.840

03:11.360 --> 03:13.880
 I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look

03:13.880 --> 03:17.700
 like I'm in New York, London, Paris, or anywhere else.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.180
 This has a large number of obvious benefits.

03:20.180 --> 03:23.380
 Certainly, it allows you to access international versions

03:23.380 --> 03:26.380
 of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix

03:26.380 --> 03:28.460
 or the UK Hulu.

03:28.460 --> 03:31.380
 ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.

03:31.380 --> 03:35.780
 I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android,

03:35.780 --> 03:38.100
 but it's available everywhere else too.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.100

03:46.580 --> 03:50.980
 And now, here's my conversation with Harry Kliff.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.160
 Let's start with probably one of the coolest things

03:54.160 --> 03:56.140
 that human beings have ever created,

03:56.140 --> 03:58.980
 the Large Hadron Collider, OHC.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.940
 What is it?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.180
 How does it work?

04:02.180 --> 04:05.260
 Okay, so it's essentially this gigantic

04:05.260 --> 04:08.340
 27 kilometer circumference particle accelerator.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.540
 It's this big ring.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.100
 It's buried about 100 meters underneath the surface

04:12.100 --> 04:14.700
 in the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.060
 And really what it's for, ultimately,

04:17.060 --> 04:20.380
 is to try to understand what are the basic building blocks

04:20.380 --> 04:21.640
 of the universe.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.060
 So you can think of it in a way

04:23.060 --> 04:24.540
 as like a gigantic microscope,

04:24.540 --> 04:28.500
 and the analogy is actually fairly precise, so.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.060
 Gigantic microscope.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.580
 Effectively, except it's a microscope

04:32.580 --> 04:36.180
 that looks at the structure of the vacuum.

04:36.180 --> 04:39.520
 In order for this kind of thing to study particles,

04:40.500 --> 04:44.420
 which are the microscopic entities, it has to be huge.

04:44.420 --> 04:45.780
 It's a gigantic microscope.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.580
 So what do you mean by studying vacuum?

04:48.580 --> 04:51.960
 Okay, so I mean, so particle physics as a field

04:51.960 --> 04:53.460
 is kind of badly named in a way,

04:53.460 --> 04:56.620
 because particles are not the fundamental ingredients

04:56.620 --> 04:57.740
 of the universe.

04:57.740 --> 04:58.940
 They're not fundamental at all.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.180
 So the things that we believe

05:00.180 --> 05:02.340
 are the real building blocks of the universe

05:02.340 --> 05:05.420
 are objects, invisible fluid like objects

05:05.420 --> 05:07.420
 called quantum fields.

05:07.420 --> 05:10.200
 So these are fields like the magnetic field

05:10.200 --> 05:12.620
 around a magnet that exists everywhere in space.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.620
 They're always there.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.020
 In fact, actually, it's funny that we're

05:15.020 --> 05:15.860
 in the Royal Institution,

05:15.860 --> 05:19.000
 because this is where the idea of the field

05:19.000 --> 05:21.260
 was effectively invented by Michael Faraday

05:21.260 --> 05:23.840
 doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.060
 So he noticed that, you know,

05:26.060 --> 05:28.420
 it was a very famous experiment that he did

05:28.420 --> 05:31.220
 where he got a magnet and put on top of it a piece of paper

05:31.220 --> 05:32.680
 and then sprinkled iron filings.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.620
 And he found the iron filings arranged themselves

05:34.620 --> 05:36.420
 into these kind of loops,

05:37.460 --> 05:40.300
 which was actually mapping out the invisible influence

05:40.300 --> 05:42.400
 of this magnetic field, which is a thing, you know,

05:42.400 --> 05:44.740
 we've all experienced, we've all felt, held a magnet

05:44.740 --> 05:46.500
 or two poles of magnet and pushed them together

05:46.500 --> 05:48.620
 and felt this thing, this force pushing back.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.020
 So these are real physical objects.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.820
 And the way we think of particles in modern physics

05:53.820 --> 05:56.660
 is that they are essentially little vibrations,

05:56.660 --> 06:00.260
 little ripples in these otherwise invisible fields

06:00.260 --> 06:01.420
 that are everywhere.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.260
 They fill the whole universe.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.860
 You know, I don't, I apologize perhaps

06:05.860 --> 06:07.420
 for the ridiculous question.

06:07.420 --> 06:10.240
 Are you comfortable with the idea

06:10.240 --> 06:14.140
 of the fundamental nature of our reality being fields?

06:14.140 --> 06:17.540
 Because to me, particles, you know,

06:17.540 --> 06:20.620
 a bunch of different building blocks makes more sense

06:20.620 --> 06:22.600
 sort of intellectually, sort of visually,

06:22.600 --> 06:26.680
 like it seems to, I seem to be able to visualize

06:26.680 --> 06:28.620
 that kind of idea easier.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.740
 Are you comfortable psychologically with the idea

06:31.740 --> 06:35.300
 that the basic building block is not a block, but a field?

06:35.300 --> 06:38.220
 I think it's, I think it's quite a magical idea.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.400
 I find it quite appealing.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.020
 And it's, well, it comes from a misunderstanding

06:42.020 --> 06:43.180
 of what particles are.

06:43.180 --> 06:45.460
 So like when you, when we do science at school

06:45.460 --> 06:46.740
 and we draw a picture of an atom,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.180
 you draw like, you know, a nucleus with some protons

06:49.180 --> 06:50.940
 and neutrons, these little spheres in the middle,

06:50.940 --> 06:53.540
 and then you have some electrons that are like little flies

06:53.540 --> 06:54.820
 flying around the atom.

06:54.820 --> 06:56.460
 And that is a completely misleading picture

06:56.460 --> 06:57.700
 of what an atom is like.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.540
 It's nothing like that.

06:58.540 --> 07:01.980
 The electron is not like a little planet orbiting the atom.

07:01.980 --> 07:05.900
 It's this spread out, wibbly wobbly wave like thing.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.420
 And we know we've known that since, you know,

07:07.420 --> 07:10.140
 the early 20th century, thanks to quantum mechanics.

07:10.140 --> 07:13.220
 So when we, we, we carry on using this word particle

07:13.220 --> 07:15.780
 because sometimes when we do experiments,

07:15.780 --> 07:17.980
 particles do behave like they're little marbles

07:17.980 --> 07:19.260
 or little bullets, you know.

07:19.260 --> 07:22.580
 So in the LHC, when we collide particles together,

07:22.580 --> 07:25.080
 you'll get, you know, you'll get like hundreds of particles

07:25.080 --> 07:26.300
 all flying out through the detector

07:26.300 --> 07:28.660
 and they all take a trajectory and you can see

07:28.660 --> 07:29.940
 from the detector where they've gone

07:29.940 --> 07:31.420
 and they look like they're little bullets.

07:31.420 --> 07:35.380
 So they behave that way, you know, a lot of the time.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.620
 When you really study them carefully,

07:37.620 --> 07:40.100
 you'll see that they are not little spheres.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.220
 They are these ethereal disturbances

07:43.220 --> 07:44.940
 in these underlying fields.

07:44.940 --> 07:48.460
 So this is really how we think nature is,

07:48.460 --> 07:51.640
 which is surprising, but also I think kind of magic.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.580
 So, you know, we are, our bodies are basically made up

07:54.580 --> 07:56.860
 of like little knots of energy

07:56.860 --> 08:00.280
 in these invisible objects that are all around us.

08:00.280 --> 08:05.280
 And what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC?

08:07.760 --> 08:09.920
 So why did you mention the word vacuum?

08:09.920 --> 08:13.040
 Okay, so if we just, if we go back to like the physics,

08:13.040 --> 08:13.920
 we do know.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.320
 So atoms are made of electrons,

08:16.320 --> 08:18.260
 which were discovered a hundred or so years ago.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.000
 And then in the nucleus of the atom,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.720
 you have two other types of particles.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.480
 There's an up, something called an up quark

08:23.480 --> 08:24.420
 and a down quark.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.920
 And those three particles make up every atom in the universe.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.640
 So we think of these as ripples in fields.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.300
 So there is something called the electron field

08:34.300 --> 08:37.440
 and every electron in the universe is a ripple moving

08:37.440 --> 08:39.080
 about in this electron field.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.800
 So the electron field is all around us, we can't see it,

08:40.800 --> 08:42.920
 but every electron in our body is a little ripple

08:42.920 --> 08:45.600
 in this thing that's there all the time.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.960
 And the quark fields are the same.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
 So there's an up quark field and an up quark

08:48.960 --> 08:50.240
 is a little ripple in the up quark field.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.720
 And the down quark is a little ripple

08:51.720 --> 08:53.340
 in something else called the down quark field.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.000
 So these fields are always there.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.880
 Now there are potentially, we know about a certain number

08:58.880 --> 09:00.440
 of fields in what we call the standard model

09:00.440 --> 09:01.320
 of particle physics.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.040
 And the most recent one we discovered was the Higgs field.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.080
 And the way we discovered the Higgs field

09:07.080 --> 09:08.620
 was to make a little ripple in it.

09:08.620 --> 09:12.520
 So what the LHC did, it fired two protons into each other,

09:12.520 --> 09:14.920
 very, very hard with enough energy

09:14.920 --> 09:18.460
 that you could create a disturbance in this Higgs field.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.840
 And that's what shows up as what we call the Higgs boson.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.940
 So this particle that everyone was going on about

09:22.940 --> 09:25.800
 eight or so years ago is proof really,

09:25.800 --> 09:28.500
 the particle in itself is, I mean, it's interesting,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.620
 but the thing that's really interesting is the field.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.900
 Because it's the Higgs field that we believe

09:33.900 --> 09:38.280
 is the reason that electrons and quarks have mass.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.000
 And it's that invisible field that's always there

09:41.000 --> 09:42.480
 that gives mass to the particles.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.360
 The Higgs boson is just our way

09:44.360 --> 09:46.340
 of checking it's there basically.

09:46.340 --> 09:49.160
 And so the Large Hadron Collider,

09:49.160 --> 09:51.900
 in order to get that ripple in the Higgs field,

09:51.900 --> 09:54.380
 it requires a huge amount of energy.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.220
 Yeah, I suppose.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.000
 And so that's why you need this huge,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.360
 that's why size matters here.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.440
 So maybe there's a million questions here,

10:01.440 --> 10:02.640
 but let's backtrack.

10:02.640 --> 10:07.640
 Why does size matter in the context of a particle collider?

10:09.960 --> 10:14.960
 So why does bigger allow you for higher energy collisions?

10:15.760 --> 10:18.500
 Right, so the reason, well, it's kind of simple really,

10:18.500 --> 10:21.080
 which is that there are two types of particle accelerator

10:21.080 --> 10:21.920
 that you can build.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.640
 One is circular, which is like the LHC,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.680
 the other is a great long line.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.560
 So the advantage of a circular machine

10:28.560 --> 10:30.580
 is that you can send particles around a ring

10:30.580 --> 10:32.560
 and you can give them a kick every time they go around.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.700
 So imagine you have a, there's actually a bit of the LHC,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.800
 that's about only 30 meters long,

10:36.800 --> 10:38.720
 where you have a bunch of metal boxes,

10:38.720 --> 10:41.800
 which have oscillating 2 million volt electric fields

10:41.800 --> 10:44.360
 inside them, which are timed so that when a proton

10:44.360 --> 10:45.560
 goes through one of these boxes,

10:45.560 --> 10:48.240
 the field it sees as it approaches is attractive.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.200
 And then as it leaves the box,

10:49.200 --> 10:51.240
 it flips and becomes repulsive

10:51.240 --> 10:52.520
 and the proton gets attracted

10:52.520 --> 10:55.060
 and kicked out the other side, so it gets a bit faster.

10:55.060 --> 10:57.160
 So you send it, and then you send it back round again.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.440
 And it's incredible, like the timing of that,

10:59.440 --> 11:01.160
 the synchronization, wait, really?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.520
 I think there's going to be a multiplicative effect

11:05.520 --> 11:06.720
 on the questions I have.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.880
 Is, okay, let me just take that attention for a second.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.120
 The orchestration of that, is that fundamentally

11:15.120 --> 11:17.600
 a hardware problem or a software problem?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.120
 Like what, how do you get that?

11:20.120 --> 11:22.680
 I mean, I should first of all say, I'm not an engineer.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.640
 So the guys, I did not build the LHC,

11:24.640 --> 11:26.840
 so they're people much, much better at this stuff than I.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.240
 For sure, but maybe.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.680
 But from your sort of intuition,

11:33.680 --> 11:37.440
 from the echoes of what you understand,

11:37.440 --> 11:40.560
 what you heard of how it's designed, what's your sense?

11:40.560 --> 11:43.360
 What's the engineering aspects of it?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.400
 The acceleration bit is not challenging.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.120
 Okay, I mean, okay, there's always challenges

11:47.120 --> 11:50.280
 with everything, but basically you have these,

11:50.280 --> 11:53.600
 the beams that go around the LHC, the beams of particles

11:53.600 --> 11:55.480
 are divided into little bunches.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.800
 So they're called, they're a bit like swarms of bees,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.280
 if you like, and there are around,

12:00.280 --> 12:04.040
 I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches

12:04.040 --> 12:05.280
 spaced around the ring.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.800
 And they, if you're at a given point on the ring,

12:07.800 --> 12:10.120
 counting bunches, you get 40 million bunches

12:10.120 --> 12:11.240
 passing you every second.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.200
 So they come in like cars going past

12:14.200 --> 12:16.000
 on a very fast motorway.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.280
 So you need to have, if you're an electric field

12:18.280 --> 12:20.400
 that you're using to accelerate the particles,

12:20.400 --> 12:23.800
 that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives,

12:23.800 --> 12:26.080
 it's got the right sign to attract them

12:26.080 --> 12:27.600
 and then flips at the right moment.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
 But I think the voltage in those boxes

12:29.600 --> 12:31.200
 oscillates at hundreds of megahertz.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.280
 So the beams are like 40 megahertz,

12:33.280 --> 12:35.200
 but it's oscillating much more quickly than the beam.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.640
 So I think it's difficult engineering,

12:37.640 --> 12:41.480
 but in principle, it's not a really serious challenge.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.320
 The bigger problem.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.600
 There's probably engineers like screaming at you right now.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.400
 Probably, but I mean, okay.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.880
 So in terms of coming back to this thing,

12:47.880 --> 12:48.760
 why is it so big?

12:48.760 --> 12:51.520
 Well, the reason is you wanna get the particles

12:51.520 --> 12:54.160
 through that accelerating element over and over again.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.280
 So you wanna bring them back round.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.320
 So that's why it's round.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.640
 The question is why couldn't you make it smaller?

12:58.640 --> 13:01.360
 Well, the basic answer is that these particles

13:01.360 --> 13:03.120
 are going unbelievably quickly.

13:03.120 --> 13:08.120
 So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light

13:09.880 --> 13:11.360
 in the LHC.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.520
 And if you think about, say,

13:12.520 --> 13:16.040
 driving your car around a corner at high speed,

13:16.040 --> 13:19.520
 if you go fast, you need a lot of friction in the tires

13:19.520 --> 13:21.200
 to make sure you don't slide off the road.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.200
 So the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make

13:26.560 --> 13:28.480
 because what we do is magnets are used

13:28.480 --> 13:30.960
 to bend the particles around the ring.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.120
 And essentially the LHC, when it was designed,

13:33.120 --> 13:35.200
 was designed with the most powerful magnets

13:35.200 --> 13:37.920
 that could conceivably be built at the time.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.400
 And so that's your kind of limiting factor.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.800
 So if you wanted to make the machine smaller,

13:41.800 --> 13:42.840
 that means a tighter bend,

13:42.840 --> 13:44.280
 you need to have a more powerful magnet.

13:44.280 --> 13:48.200
 So it's this toss up between how strong are your magnets

13:48.200 --> 13:49.920
 versus how big a tunnel can you afford.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.560
 The bigger the tunnel, the weaker the magnets can be.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.080
 The smaller the tunnel, the stronger they've gotta be.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.680
 Okay, so maybe can we backtrack to the Standard Model

13:57.680 --> 14:00.800
 and say what kind of particles there are, period,

14:00.800 --> 14:04.560
 and maybe the history of kind of assembling

14:04.560 --> 14:06.880
 that the Standard Model of physics

14:06.880 --> 14:10.400
 and then how that leads up to the hopes and dreams

14:10.400 --> 14:12.800
 and the accomplishments of the Large Hadron Collider.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.000
 Yeah, sure, okay.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.720
 So all of 20th century physics in like five minutes.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.560
 Yeah, please.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.280
 Okay, so, okay, the story really begins properly.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.760
 End of the 19th century, the basic view of matter

14:24.760 --> 14:26.720
 is that matter is made of atoms

14:26.720 --> 14:30.280
 and the atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres

14:30.280 --> 14:31.480
 like the things we were talking about

14:31.480 --> 14:32.600
 that don't really exist.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.280
 And there's one atom for every chemical element.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.880
 So there's an atom for hydrogen, for helium,

14:36.880 --> 14:39.800
 for carbon, for iron, et cetera, and they're all different.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.880
 Then in 1897, experiments done

14:41.880 --> 14:43.280
 at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.840
 which is where I'm still, where I'm based,

14:45.840 --> 14:48.720
 showed that there are actually smaller particles

14:48.720 --> 14:51.640
 inside the atom, which eventually became known as electrons.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.200
 So these are these negatively charged things

14:53.200 --> 14:54.840
 that go around the outside.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.080
 A few years later, Ernest Rutherford,

14:57.080 --> 14:58.680
 very famous nuclear physicist,

14:58.680 --> 15:00.000
 one of the pioneers of nuclear physics

15:00.000 --> 15:03.480
 shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center,

15:03.480 --> 15:04.400
 which we call the nucleus,

15:04.400 --> 15:05.840
 which is a positively charged object.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.080
 So then by like 1910, 11, we have this model of the atom

15:09.080 --> 15:09.960
 that we learn in school,

15:09.960 --> 15:13.240
 which is you've got a nucleus, electrons go around it.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.280
 Fast forward a few years, the nucleus,

15:16.280 --> 15:18.480
 people start doing experiments with radioactivity

15:18.480 --> 15:20.840
 where they use alpha particles

15:20.840 --> 15:24.520
 that are spat out of radioactive elements as bullets,

15:24.520 --> 15:26.800
 and they fire them at other atoms.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.560
 And by banging things into each other,

15:28.560 --> 15:31.200
 they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.880
 So these things come out called protons, first of all,

15:33.880 --> 15:36.040
 which are positively charged particles

15:36.040 --> 15:38.800
 about 2000 times heavier than the electron.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.160
 And then 10 years later, more or less,

15:41.160 --> 15:43.880
 a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.000
 So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.400
 You have protons and neutrons in the nucleus

15:49.400 --> 15:51.800
 that are stuck together by something called the strong force,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.200
 the strong nuclear force,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.800
 and you have electrons in orbit around that,

15:55.800 --> 15:57.920
 held in by the electromagnetic force,

15:57.920 --> 16:00.440
 which is one of the forces of nature.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.840
 That's sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.440
 Then what happens is physics is nice and neat.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.520
 In 1932, everything looks great, got three particles

16:09.520 --> 16:11.160
 and all the atoms are made of, that's fine.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.960
 But then cloud chamber experiments.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.000
 These are devices that can be used to,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.600
 the first device is capable of imaging subatomic particles

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
 so you can see their tracks.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.760
 And they're used to study cosmic rays,

16:21.760 --> 16:23.760
 particles that come from outer space

16:23.760 --> 16:25.640
 and bang into the atmosphere.

16:25.640 --> 16:28.120
 And in these experiments,

16:28.120 --> 16:29.840
 people start to see a whole load of new particles.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.560
 So they discover for one thing antimatter,

16:31.560 --> 16:34.440
 which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.960
 So we discovered that there's also,

16:35.960 --> 16:37.440
 as well as a negatively charged electron,

16:37.440 --> 16:38.520
 there's something called a positron,

16:38.520 --> 16:40.480
 which is a positively charged version of the electron.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.240
 And there's an antiproton, which is negatively charged.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.600
 And then a whole load of other weird particles

16:45.600 --> 16:46.480
 start to get discovered.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.800
 And no one really knows what they are.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.960
 This is known as the zoo of particles.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.160
 Are these discoveries from the first theoretical discoveries

16:55.160 --> 16:58.360
 or are they discoveries in an experiment?

16:58.360 --> 17:01.120
 So like, yeah, what's the process of discovery

17:01.120 --> 17:03.280
 for these early sets of particles?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.120
 It's a mixture.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.040
 The early stuff around the atom is really

17:06.040 --> 17:07.200
 experimentally driven.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.000
 It's not based on some theory.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.640
 It's exploration in the lab using equipment.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.920
 So it's really people just figuring out,

17:12.920 --> 17:14.400
 getting hands on with the phenomena,

17:14.400 --> 17:16.000
 figuring out what these things are.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.600
 And the theory comes a bit later.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.880
 That's not always the case.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.480
 So in the discovery of the anti electron, the positron,

17:22.480 --> 17:26.160
 that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity

17:26.160 --> 17:30.320
 by a very clever theoretical physicist called Paul Dirac,

17:30.320 --> 17:33.240
 who was probably the second brightest physicist

17:33.240 --> 17:34.920
 of the 20th century, apart from Einstein,

17:34.920 --> 17:36.720
 but isn't anywhere near as well known.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.240
 So he predicted the existence of the anti electron

17:39.240 --> 17:41.880
 from basically a combination of the theories

17:41.880 --> 17:43.240
 of quantum mechanics and relativity.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.720
 And it was discovered about a year after

17:44.720 --> 17:46.000
 he made the prediction.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.160
 What happens when an electron meets a positron?

17:49.160 --> 17:50.680
 They annihilate each other.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.400
 So when you bring a particle and its antiparticle together,

17:54.400 --> 17:56.440
 they react, well, they don't react,

17:56.440 --> 17:58.520
 they just wipe each other out and they turn,

17:58.520 --> 18:00.040
 their mass is turned into energy,

18:00.040 --> 18:03.440
 usually in the form of photons, so you get light produced.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.920
 So when you have that kind of situation,

18:06.920 --> 18:08.880
 why does the universe exist at all

18:08.880 --> 18:10.320
 if there's matter in any matter?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.080
 Oh God, now we're getting into the really big questions.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.680
 So, do you wanna go there now?

18:15.680 --> 18:19.000
 Let's, maybe let's go there later.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.600
 Cause that, I mean, that is a very big question.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.720
 Yeah, let's take it slow with the standard model.

18:23.720 --> 18:28.240
 So, okay, so there's matter and antimatter in the 30s.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.520
 So what else?

18:29.520 --> 18:30.400
 So matter and antimatter,

18:30.400 --> 18:33.400
 and then a load of new particles start turning up

18:33.400 --> 18:36.880
 in these cosmic ray experiments, first of all.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.120
 And they don't seem to be particles that make up atoms.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.080
 They're something else.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.120
 They all mostly interact with a strong nuclear force.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.480
 So they're a bit like protons and neutrons.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.280
 And by, in the 1960s in America, particularly,

18:50.280 --> 18:52.320
 but also in Europe and Russia,

18:52.320 --> 18:54.160
 scientists started to build particle accelerators.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.800
 So these are the forerunners of the LHC.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.280
 So big ring shaped machines that were, you know,

18:58.280 --> 19:00.720
 hundreds of meters long, which in those days was enormous.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.760
 You never, you know, most physics up until that point

19:02.760 --> 19:04.840
 had been done in labs, in universities, you know,

19:04.840 --> 19:06.240
 with small bits of kit.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.160
 So this is a big change.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.920
 And when these accelerators are built,

19:08.920 --> 19:10.680
 they start to find they can produce

19:10.680 --> 19:12.160
 even more of these particles.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.440
 So I don't know the exact numbers, but by around 1960,

19:16.440 --> 19:19.320
 there are of order a hundred of these things

19:19.320 --> 19:20.160
 that have been discovered.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.720
 And physicists are kind of tearing their hair out

19:22.720 --> 19:25.040
 because physics is all about simplification.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.080
 And suddenly what was simple has become messy

19:28.080 --> 19:29.720
 and complicated and everyone sort of wants

19:29.720 --> 19:31.640
 to understand what's going on.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.600
 As a quick kind of aside and probably really dumb question,

19:34.600 --> 19:38.720
 but how is it possible to take something like a,

19:38.720 --> 19:43.720
 like a photon or electron and be able to control it enough,

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
 like to be able to do a controlled experiment

19:49.000 --> 19:51.480
 where you collide it against something else?

19:51.480 --> 19:52.320
 Yeah.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.920
 Is that, is that, that seems like an exceptionally difficult

19:55.920 --> 19:59.520
 engineering challenge because you mentioned vacuum too.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.200
 So you basically want to remove every other distraction

20:03.200 --> 20:04.760
 and really focus on this collision.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.840
 How difficult of an engineering challenge is that?

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
 Just to get a sense.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.680
 And it is very hard.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.920
 I mean, in the early days,

20:10.920 --> 20:12.960
 particularly when the first accelerators are being built

20:12.960 --> 20:17.880
 in like 1932, Ernest Lawrence builds the first,

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
 what we call a cyclotron,

20:18.880 --> 20:21.760
 which is like a little accelerator, this big or so.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.600
 There's another one.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.420
 Is it really that big?

20:23.420 --> 20:24.260
 There's a tiny little thing.

20:24.260 --> 20:25.100
 Yeah.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.840
 So most of the first accelerators

20:27.840 --> 20:31.000
 were what we call fixed target experiments.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.100
 So you had a ring, you accelerate particles around the ring

20:34.100 --> 20:37.480
 and then you fire them out the side into some target.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.480
 So that makes the kind of,

20:39.480 --> 20:41.320
 the colliding bit is relatively straightforward

20:41.320 --> 20:42.360
 because you just fire it,

20:42.360 --> 20:43.660
 whatever it is you want to fire it at.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.200
 The hard bit is the steering the beams

20:46.200 --> 20:47.760
 with the magnetic fields, getting, you know,

20:47.760 --> 20:49.560
 strong enough electric fields to accelerate them,

20:49.560 --> 20:50.400
 all that kind of stuff.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.760
 The first colliders where you have two beams

20:53.760 --> 20:56.680
 colliding head on, that comes later.

20:56.680 --> 21:01.680
 And I don't think it's done until maybe the 1980s.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.360
 I'm not entirely sure, but it's a much harder problem.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.200
 That's crazy.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.880
 Cause you have to like perfectly get them to hit each other.

21:09.880 --> 21:13.120
 I mean, we're talking about, I mean, what scale it takes,

21:13.120 --> 21:18.120
 what's the, I mean, the temporal thing is a giant mess,

21:18.160 --> 21:23.160
 but the spatially, like the size is tiny.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.060
 Well, to give you a sense of the LHC beams,

21:26.060 --> 21:31.060
 the cross sectional diameter is I think around a dozen

21:31.620 --> 21:32.820
 or so microns.

21:32.820 --> 21:37.060
 So, you know, 10 millionths of a meter.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.900
 And a beam, sorry, just to clarify,

21:39.900 --> 21:41.340
 a beam contains how many,

21:41.340 --> 21:43.060
 is it the bunches that you mentioned?

21:43.060 --> 21:45.060
 Is it multiple particles or is it just one particle?

21:45.060 --> 21:45.900
 Oh no, no.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.920
 The bunches contains say a hundred billion protons each.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.020
 So a bunch is, it's not really bunch shaped.

21:51.020 --> 21:51.900
 They're actually quite long.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.660
 They're like 30 centimeters long,

21:53.660 --> 21:54.860
 but thinner than a human hair.

21:54.860 --> 21:58.420
 So like very, very narrow, long sort of objects.

21:58.420 --> 21:59.260
 Those are the things.

21:59.260 --> 22:02.260
 So what happens in the LHC is you steer the beams

22:02.260 --> 22:06.080
 so that they cross in the middle of the detector.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.540
 So they basically have these swarms of protons

22:08.540 --> 22:10.160
 that are flying through each other.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.180
 And most of the, you have to have a hundred billion

22:12.180 --> 22:14.500
 coming one way, a hundred billion another way,

22:14.500 --> 22:17.100
 maybe 10 of them will hit each other.

22:17.100 --> 22:17.940
 Oh, okay.

22:17.940 --> 22:19.400
 So this, okay, that makes a lot more sense.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.240
 So that's nice.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.980
 But you're trying to use sort of,

22:21.980 --> 22:24.560
 it's like probabilistically, you're not.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.100
 You can't make a single particle collide

22:26.100 --> 22:26.940
 with a single other particle.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.140
 That's not an efficient way to do it.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.980
 You'd be waiting a very long time to get anything.

22:30.980 --> 22:34.020
 So you're basically, right.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.460
 You're relying on probability to be that some fraction

22:37.460 --> 22:38.780
 of them are gonna collide.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.820
 And then you know which,

22:40.820 --> 22:44.340
 because it's a swarm of the same kind of particle.

22:44.340 --> 22:46.420
 So it doesn't matter which ones hit each other exactly.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.240
 I mean, that's not to say it's not hard.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.420
 You've got to, one of the challenges

22:50.420 --> 22:52.880
 to make the collisions work is you have to squash

22:52.880 --> 22:54.580
 these beams to very, very,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.020
 basically the narrower they are the better

22:56.020 --> 22:58.780
 cause the higher chances of them colliding.

22:58.780 --> 23:00.380
 If you think about two flocks of birds

23:00.380 --> 23:01.580
 flying through each other,

23:01.580 --> 23:03.660
 the birds are all far apart in the flocks.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.980
 There's not much chance that they'll collide.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.420
 If they're all flying densely together,

23:06.420 --> 23:08.360
 then they're much more likely to collide with each other.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.060
 So that's the sort of problem.

23:10.060 --> 23:12.060
 And it's tuning those magnetic fields,

23:12.060 --> 23:13.380
 getting the magnetic fields powerful enough

23:13.380 --> 23:15.220
 that you squash the beams and focus them

23:15.220 --> 23:16.900
 so that you get enough collisions.

23:16.900 --> 23:17.900
 That's super cool.

23:17.900 --> 23:20.360
 Do you know how much software is involved here?

23:20.360 --> 23:21.200
 I mean, it's sort of,

23:21.200 --> 23:23.600
 I come from the software world and it's fascinating.

23:24.780 --> 23:28.060
 This seems like software is buggy and messy.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.980
 And so like, you almost don't want to rely

23:30.980 --> 23:31.900
 on software too much.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.900
 Like if you do, it has to be like low level,

23:33.900 --> 23:36.340
 like Fortran style programming.

23:36.340 --> 23:37.540
 Do you know how much software

23:37.540 --> 23:39.500
 is in a large Hadron Collider?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.580
 I mean, it depends at which level a lot.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.640
 I mean, the whole thing is obviously computer controlled.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.460
 So, I mean, I don't know a huge amount

23:45.460 --> 23:49.340
 about how the software for the actual accelerator works,

23:49.340 --> 23:51.340
 but I've been in the control center.

23:51.340 --> 23:53.280
 So at CERN, there's this big control room,

23:53.280 --> 23:55.480
 which is like a bit like a NASA mission control

23:55.480 --> 23:57.760
 with big banks of desks where the engineers sit

23:57.760 --> 23:59.180
 and they monitor the LHC.

23:59.180 --> 24:00.860
 Cause you obviously can't be in the tunnel

24:00.860 --> 24:01.680
 when it's running.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.460
 So everything's remote.

24:03.460 --> 24:07.460
 I mean, one sort of anecdote about the software side,

24:07.460 --> 24:10.460
 in 2008, when the LHC first switched on,

24:10.460 --> 24:11.620
 they had this big launch event

24:11.620 --> 24:14.940
 and then big press conference party

24:14.940 --> 24:16.260
 to inaugurate the machine.

24:16.260 --> 24:18.300
 And about 10 days after that,

24:18.300 --> 24:19.580
 they were doing some tests

24:19.580 --> 24:22.100
 and this dramatic event happened

24:22.100 --> 24:24.180
 where a huge explosion basically took place

24:24.180 --> 24:26.880
 in the tunnel that destroyed or damaged, badly damaged

24:26.880 --> 24:29.880
 about half a kilometer of the machine.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.540
 But the stories, the engineers

24:31.540 --> 24:33.620
 are in the control room that day.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.300
 One guy told me this story about,

24:35.300 --> 24:37.700
 basically all these screens they have in the control room

24:37.700 --> 24:38.540
 started going red.

24:38.540 --> 24:42.300
 So these alarms like kind of in software going off

24:42.300 --> 24:43.500
 and then they assume that there's something wrong

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
 with the software, cause there's no way

24:45.500 --> 24:48.700
 something this catastrophic could have happened.

24:48.700 --> 24:52.300
 But I mean, when I worked on, when I was a PhD student,

24:52.300 --> 24:56.060
 one of my jobs was to help to maintain the software

24:56.060 --> 24:59.140
 that's used to control the detector that we work on.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.180
 And that was, it's relatively robust,

25:01.180 --> 25:02.940
 not such, you don't want it to be too fancy.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.620
 You don't want it to sort of fall over too easily.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.040
 The more clever stuff comes

25:07.040 --> 25:08.500
 when you're talking about analyzing the data

25:08.500 --> 25:10.540
 and that's where the sort of, you know.

25:10.540 --> 25:11.740
 Are we jumping around too much?

25:11.740 --> 25:13.160
 Do we finish with a standard model?

25:13.160 --> 25:14.000
 We didn't, no.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.020
 We didn't, so have we even started talking about quarks?

25:17.020 --> 25:17.860
 We haven't talked to them yet.

25:17.860 --> 25:20.360
 No, we got to the messy zoo of particles.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.980
 Let me, let's go back there if it's okay.

25:22.980 --> 25:23.820
 Okay, that's fine.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.540
 Can you take us to the rest of the history of physics

25:26.540 --> 25:27.700
 in the 20th century?

25:27.700 --> 25:29.020
 Okay, sure.

25:29.020 --> 25:32.000
 Okay, so circa 1960, you have this,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.680
 you have these a hundred or so particles.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.540
 It's a bit like the periodic table all over again.

25:35.540 --> 25:37.860
 So you've got like having a hundred elements,

25:37.860 --> 25:39.260
 it's sort of a bit like that.

25:39.260 --> 25:41.500
 And people start to try to impose some order.

25:41.500 --> 25:46.140
 So Murray Gellman, he's a theoretical physicist,

25:46.140 --> 25:47.700
 American from New York.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.500
 He realizes that there are these symmetries

25:50.500 --> 25:53.340
 in these particles that if you arrange them in certain ways,

25:53.340 --> 25:54.380
 they relate to each other.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.060
 And he uses these symmetry principles

25:56.060 --> 25:58.260
 to predict the existence of particles

25:58.260 --> 25:59.220
 that haven't been discovered,

25:59.220 --> 26:01.060
 which are then discovered in accelerators.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.480
 So this starts to suggest

26:02.480 --> 26:04.500
 there's not just random collections of crap.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.460
 There's like, you know, actually some order

26:06.460 --> 26:08.740
 to this underlying it.

26:08.740 --> 26:13.280
 A little bit later in 1960, again, around the 1960s,

26:14.260 --> 26:17.860
 he proposes along with another physicist called George Zweig

26:17.860 --> 26:21.060
 that these symmetries arise because

26:21.060 --> 26:23.380
 just like the patterns in the periodic table arise

26:23.380 --> 26:26.420
 because atoms are made of electrons and protons,

26:26.420 --> 26:28.100
 that these patterns are due to the fact

26:28.100 --> 26:30.260
 that these particles are made of smaller things.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.900
 And they are called quarks.

26:31.900 --> 26:34.500
 So these are the particles they're predicted from theory.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.700
 For a long time, no one really believes they're real.

26:36.700 --> 26:39.180
 A lot of people think that they're a kind of theoretical

26:39.180 --> 26:41.480
 convenience that happened to fit the data,

26:41.480 --> 26:42.580
 but there's no evidence.

26:42.580 --> 26:45.460
 No one's ever seen a quark in any experiment.

26:45.460 --> 26:48.580
 And lots of experiments are done to try to find quarks,

26:48.580 --> 26:50.460
 to try to knock a quark out of a...

26:50.460 --> 26:52.860
 So the idea, if protons and neutrons are made of quarks,

26:52.860 --> 26:55.140
 you should be able to knock a quark out and see the quark.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.020
 That never happens.

26:56.020 --> 26:58.140
 And we still have never actually managed to do that.

26:58.140 --> 26:59.260
 Wait, really?

26:59.260 --> 27:00.100
 No.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.260
 So the way that it's done in the end

27:02.260 --> 27:04.620
 is this machine that's built in California

27:04.620 --> 27:08.860
 at the Stanford Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator,

27:08.860 --> 27:10.540
 which is essentially a gigantic,

27:10.540 --> 27:12.460
 three kilometer long electron gun.

27:12.460 --> 27:16.260
 It fires electrons, almost the speed of light, at protons.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.860
 And when you do these experiments,

27:17.860 --> 27:20.100
 what you find is at very high energy,

27:20.100 --> 27:24.000
 the electrons bounce off small, hard objects

27:24.000 --> 27:25.420
 inside the proton.

27:25.420 --> 27:28.100
 So it's a bit like taking an X ray of the proton.

27:28.100 --> 27:31.580
 You're firing these very light, high energy particles,

27:31.580 --> 27:34.260
 and they're pinging off little things inside the proton

27:34.260 --> 27:36.260
 that are like ball bearings, if you like.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.220
 So you actually, that way,

27:38.220 --> 27:41.020
 they resolve that there are three things

27:41.020 --> 27:42.820
 inside the proton, which are quarks,

27:42.820 --> 27:45.480
 the quarks that Gellman and Zweig had predicted.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.900
 So that's really the evidence that convinces people

27:47.900 --> 27:49.400
 that these things are real.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.820
 The fact that we've never seen one

27:50.820 --> 27:51.980
 in an experiment directly,

27:51.980 --> 27:56.260
 they're always stuck inside other particles.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.180
 And the reason for that is essentially

27:58.180 --> 27:59.100
 to do with a strong force.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.700
 The strong force is the force that holds quarks together.

28:01.700 --> 28:04.020
 And it's so strong that it's impossible

28:04.020 --> 28:06.460
 to actually liberate a quark.

28:06.460 --> 28:08.260
 So if you try and pull a quark out of a proton,

28:08.260 --> 28:09.700
 what actually ends up happening

28:09.700 --> 28:14.260
 is that you kind of create this spring like bond

28:14.260 --> 28:15.100
 in the strong force.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.780
 You imagine two quarks that are held together

28:16.780 --> 28:18.540
 by a very powerful spring.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.940
 You pull and pull and pull,

28:19.940 --> 28:22.280
 more and more energy gets stored in that bond,

28:22.280 --> 28:23.420
 like stretching a spring,

28:23.420 --> 28:25.340
 and eventually the tension gets so great,

28:25.340 --> 28:28.700
 the spring snaps, and the energy in that bond

28:28.700 --> 28:30.660
 gets turned into two new quarks

28:30.660 --> 28:32.420
 that go on the broken ends.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.260
 So you started with two quarks,

28:33.260 --> 28:34.660
 you end up with four quarks.

28:34.660 --> 28:37.180
 So you never actually get to take a quark out.

28:37.180 --> 28:39.860
 You just end up making loads more quarks in the process.

28:39.860 --> 28:42.900
 So how do we, again, forgive the dumb question,

28:42.900 --> 28:44.880
 how do we know quarks are real then?

28:44.880 --> 28:48.100
 Well, A, from these experiments where we can scatter,

28:48.100 --> 28:49.700
 you fire electrons into the protons.

28:49.700 --> 28:52.620
 They can burrow into the proton and knock off,

28:52.620 --> 28:55.140
 and they can bounce off these quarks.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.460
 So you can see from the angles,

28:56.460 --> 28:58.100
 the electrons come out.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.120
 I see, you can infer.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.060
 You can infer that these things are there.

29:02.060 --> 29:03.620
 The quark model can also be used.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.340
 It has a lot of successes that you can use it

29:05.340 --> 29:07.500
 to predict the existence of new particles

29:07.500 --> 29:08.700
 that hadn't been seen.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.780
 So, and it basically, there's lots of data

29:10.780 --> 29:12.340
 basically showing from, you know,

29:12.340 --> 29:15.200
 when we fire protons at each other at the LHC,

29:16.420 --> 29:18.820
 a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place.

29:18.820 --> 29:20.540
 And every time they try and escape from,

29:20.540 --> 29:21.580
 say, one of their protons,

29:21.580 --> 29:25.580
 they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off,

29:25.580 --> 29:28.560
 bound up in other sorts of particles made of quarks.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.740
 So all the sort of the theoretical predictions

29:30.740 --> 29:33.740
 from the basic theory of the strong force and the quarks

29:33.740 --> 29:35.380
 all agrees with what we are seeing in experiments.

29:35.380 --> 29:38.020
 We've just never seen an actual quark on its own

29:38.020 --> 29:39.280
 because unfortunately it's impossible

29:39.280 --> 29:41.140
 to get them out on their own.

29:41.140 --> 29:45.120
 So quarks, these crazy smaller things

29:45.120 --> 29:47.160
 that are hard to imagine are real.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.140
 So what else?

29:48.140 --> 29:49.780
 What else is part of the story here?

29:49.780 --> 29:52.100
 So the other thing that's going on at the time,

29:52.100 --> 29:57.100
 around the 60s, is an attempt to understand the forces

29:57.380 --> 30:00.220
 that make these particles interact with each other.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.780
 So you have the electromagnetic force,

30:01.780 --> 30:03.900
 which is the force that was sort of discovered

30:03.900 --> 30:07.140
 to some extent in this room, or at least in this building.

30:07.140 --> 30:10.020
 So the first, what we call quantum field theory

30:10.020 --> 30:13.380
 of the electromagnetic force is developed

30:13.380 --> 30:17.660
 in the 1940s and 50s by Feynman,

30:17.660 --> 30:19.740
 Richard Feynman amongst other people,

30:19.740 --> 30:22.020
 Julian Schrodinger, Tom Onaga,

30:22.020 --> 30:23.060
 who come up with the first,

30:23.060 --> 30:24.420
 what we call a quantum field theory

30:24.420 --> 30:25.740
 of the electromagnetic force.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.340
 And this is where this description of,

30:27.340 --> 30:28.360
 which I gave you at the beginning,

30:28.360 --> 30:30.820
 that particles are ripples in fields.

30:30.820 --> 30:33.900
 Well, in this theory, the photon, the particle of light

30:33.900 --> 30:36.340
 is described as a ripple in this quantum field

30:36.340 --> 30:38.720
 called the electromagnetic field.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.240
 And the attempt then is made to try,

30:40.240 --> 30:42.260
 well, can we come up with a quantum field theory

30:42.260 --> 30:45.140
 of the other forces, of the strong force and the weak,

30:45.140 --> 30:47.140
 the third force, which we haven't discussed,

30:47.140 --> 30:50.740
 which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force.

30:50.740 --> 30:52.640
 We don't really experience it in our everyday lives,

30:52.640 --> 30:54.960
 but it's responsible for radioactive decay.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.980
 It's the force that allows, you know,

30:56.980 --> 30:59.140
 on a radioactive atom to turn

30:59.140 --> 31:01.060
 into a different element, for example.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.420
 And I don't know if you've explicitly mentioned,

31:03.420 --> 31:06.100
 but so there's technically four forces.

31:06.100 --> 31:06.980
 Yes.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.900
 I guess three of them would be in the standard model,

31:09.900 --> 31:13.460
 like the weak, the strong, and the electromagnetic,

31:13.460 --> 31:14.540
 and then there's gravity.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.220
 And there's gravity, which we don't worry about that,

31:16.220 --> 31:17.040
 because it's too hard.

31:17.040 --> 31:17.880
 It's too hard.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.940
 Well, no, maybe we bring that up at the end, but yeah.

31:19.940 --> 31:22.340
 Gravity, so far, we don't have a quantum theory of,

31:22.340 --> 31:23.580
 and if you can solve that problem,

31:23.580 --> 31:25.140
 you'll win a Nobel Prize.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.340
 Well, we're gonna have to bring up

31:26.340 --> 31:28.140
 the graviton at some point, I'm gonna ask you,

31:28.140 --> 31:31.160
 but let's leave that to the side for now.

31:31.160 --> 31:36.160
 So those three, okay, Feynman, electromagnetic force,

31:36.500 --> 31:41.500
 the quantum field, and where does the weak force come in?

31:41.920 --> 31:43.580
 So yeah, well, first of all,

31:43.580 --> 31:44.780
 I mean, the strong force is the easiest.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.460
 The strong force is a little bit

31:46.460 --> 31:47.600
 like the electromagnetic force.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.140
 It's a force that binds things together.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.060
 So that's the force that holds quarks together

31:51.060 --> 31:52.860
 inside the proton, for example.

31:52.860 --> 31:55.960
 So a quantum field theory of that force

31:55.960 --> 31:58.900
 is discovered in the, I think it's in the 60s,

31:59.820 --> 32:01.460
 and it predicts the existence

32:01.460 --> 32:04.500
 of new force particles called gluons.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.940
 So gluons are a bit like the photon.

32:06.940 --> 32:09.500
 The photon is the particle of electromagnetism.

32:09.500 --> 32:13.540
 Gluons are the particles of the strong force.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.860
 So just like there's an electromagnetic field,

32:15.860 --> 32:17.540
 there's something called a gluon field,

32:17.540 --> 32:19.500
 which is also all around us.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.780
 So some of these particles, I guess,

32:21.780 --> 32:23.660
 are the force carriers or whatever.

32:23.660 --> 32:24.500
 They carry the force.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.980
 It depends how you want to think about it.

32:25.980 --> 32:28.460
 I mean, really the field, the strong force field,

32:28.460 --> 32:32.880
 the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.460
 The gluons are the little ripples in that field.

32:35.460 --> 32:37.740
 So that like, in the same way that the photon is a ripple

32:37.740 --> 32:39.900
 in the electromagnetic field.

32:39.900 --> 32:43.620
 But the thing that really does the binding is the field.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.680
 I mean, you may have heard people talk about things

32:45.680 --> 32:48.600
 like you've heard the phrase virtual particle.

32:49.860 --> 32:52.460
 So sometimes in some, if you hear people describing

32:52.460 --> 32:54.900
 how forces are exchanged between particles,

32:54.900 --> 32:56.220
 they quite often talk about the idea

32:56.220 --> 32:59.180
 that if you have an electron and another electron, say,

32:59.180 --> 33:00.640
 and they're repelling each other

33:00.640 --> 33:03.060
 through the electromagnetic force,

33:03.060 --> 33:05.820
 you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.060
 So they're kind of firing photons

33:07.060 --> 33:08.660
 backwards and forwards between each other.

33:08.660 --> 33:11.060
 And that causes them to repel.

33:11.060 --> 33:13.060
 That photon is then a virtual particle.

33:13.060 --> 33:14.460
 Yes, that's what we call a virtual particle.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.580
 In other words, it's not a real thing,

33:15.580 --> 33:16.820
 it doesn't actually exist.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.900
 So it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.140
 So when they do calculations in quantum field theory,

33:22.140 --> 33:24.460
 rather than, no one's discovered a way

33:24.460 --> 33:25.780
 of just treating the whole field.

33:25.780 --> 33:28.200
 You have to break the field down into simpler things.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.200
 So you can basically treat the field

33:30.200 --> 33:33.540
 as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons,

33:33.540 --> 33:35.660
 but there's no experiment that you can do

33:35.660 --> 33:38.420
 that can detect these particles being exchanged.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.460
 What's really happening in reality

33:40.460 --> 33:43.280
 is that the electromagnetic field is warped

33:43.280 --> 33:46.240
 by the charge of the electron and that causes the force.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.300
 But the way we do calculations involves particles.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.840
 So it's a bit confusing,

33:50.840 --> 33:53.300
 but it's really a mathematical technique.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.740
 It's not something that corresponds to reality.

33:55.740 --> 33:58.260
 I mean, that's part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.100
 Yes.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.100
 Is this these virtual particles, okay.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.500
 That's right, yeah.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.800
 Some of these have mass, some of them don't.

34:06.380 --> 34:09.060
 What does that even mean, not to have mass?

34:09.060 --> 34:11.900
 And maybe you can say which one of them have mass

34:11.900 --> 34:12.860
 and which don't.

34:12.860 --> 34:14.140
 Okay, so.

34:14.140 --> 34:17.020
 And why is mass important or relevant

34:17.020 --> 34:22.020
 in this field view of the universe?

34:22.020 --> 34:23.700
 Well, there are actually only two particles

34:23.700 --> 34:25.500
 in the standard model that don't have mass,

34:25.500 --> 34:28.480
 which are the photon and the gluons.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.300
 So they are massless particles,

34:30.300 --> 34:32.960
 but the electron, the quarks,

34:32.960 --> 34:34.140
 and there are a bunch of other particles

34:34.140 --> 34:34.960
 I haven't discussed.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.380
 There's something called a muon and a tau,

34:36.380 --> 34:39.280
 which are basically heavy versions of the electron

34:39.280 --> 34:40.120
 that are unstable.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.380
 You can make them in accelerators,

34:41.380 --> 34:44.200
 but they don't form atoms or anything.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.600
 They don't exist for long enough.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.700
 But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them,

34:48.700 --> 34:51.940
 six quarks and six, what we call leptons,

34:51.940 --> 34:54.460
 which includes the electron and its two heavy versions

34:54.460 --> 34:57.380
 and three neutrinos, all of them have mass.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.500
 And so do, this is the critical bit.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.860
 So the weak force, which is the third of these

35:02.860 --> 35:06.240
 quantum forces, which is one of the hardest to understand,

35:07.540 --> 35:12.540
 the force particles of that force have very large masses.

35:13.860 --> 35:14.900
 And there are three of them.

35:14.900 --> 35:19.540
 They're called the W plus, the W minus, and the Z boson.

35:19.540 --> 35:23.000
 And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times

35:23.000 --> 35:24.580
 that of the protons.

35:24.580 --> 35:25.660
 They're very heavy.

35:25.660 --> 35:26.500
 Wow.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.320
 They're very heavy things.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.440
 So they're what, the heaviest, I guess?

35:29.440 --> 35:30.280
 They're not the heaviest.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.920
 The heaviest particle is the top quark,

35:32.920 --> 35:37.920
 which has a mass of about 175 ish protons.

35:38.460 --> 35:39.700
 So that's really massive.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.680
 And we don't know why it's so massive,

35:41.680 --> 35:43.160
 but coming back to the weak force,

35:43.160 --> 35:47.380
 so the problem in the 60s and 70s was that

35:47.380 --> 35:50.100
 the reason that the electromagnetic force

35:50.100 --> 35:51.900
 is a force that we can experience in our everyday lives.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.260
 So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal,

35:53.260 --> 35:55.420
 you can hold it, you know, a meter apart

35:55.420 --> 35:57.040
 if it's powerful enough and you'll feel a force.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.380
 Whereas the weak force only becomes apparent

36:00.380 --> 36:03.180
 when you basically have two particles touching

36:03.180 --> 36:05.340
 at the scale of a nucleus.

36:05.340 --> 36:06.980
 So we just get to very short distances

36:06.980 --> 36:09.620
 before this force becomes manifest.

36:09.620 --> 36:12.260
 It's not, we don't get weak forces going on in this room.

36:12.260 --> 36:14.060
 We don't notice them.

36:14.060 --> 36:15.860
 And the reason for that is that the particle,

36:15.860 --> 36:20.140
 well, the field that transmits the weak force,

36:20.140 --> 36:22.300
 the particle that's associated with that field

36:22.300 --> 36:23.380
 has a very large mass,

36:23.380 --> 36:26.240
 which means that the field dies off very quickly.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.360
 So as you, whereas an electric charge,

36:28.360 --> 36:30.640
 if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field,

36:30.640 --> 36:32.140
 it would fall off with this,

36:32.140 --> 36:33.780
 you have this thing called the inverse square law,

36:33.780 --> 36:36.220
 which is the idea that the force halves

36:36.220 --> 36:38.740
 every time you double the distance.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.700
 No, sorry, it doesn't half.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.580
 It quarters every time you double the distance

36:42.580 --> 36:44.220
 between say the two particles.

36:44.220 --> 36:45.780
 Whereas the weak force kind of,

36:45.780 --> 36:47.300
 you move a little bit away from the nucleus

36:47.300 --> 36:49.400
 and just disappears.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.980
 The reason for that is because these fields,

36:51.980 --> 36:55.420
 the particles that go with them have a very large mass.

36:55.420 --> 36:59.860
 But the problem that theorists faced in the 60s

36:59.860 --> 37:04.300
 was that if you tried to introduce massive force fields,

37:04.300 --> 37:06.540
 the theory gave you nonsensical answers.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.700
 So you'd end up with infinite results

37:08.700 --> 37:11.140
 for a lot of the calculations you tried to do.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.660
 So the basically, it seemed that quantum field theory

37:13.660 --> 37:17.320
 was incompatible with having massive particles,

37:17.320 --> 37:18.700
 not just the force particles actually,

37:18.700 --> 37:21.900
 but even the electron was a problem.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.740
 So this is where the Higgs

37:23.740 --> 37:25.640
 that we sort of alluded to comes in.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.400
 And the solution was to say, okay, well,

37:28.400 --> 37:30.460
 actually all the particles in the Standard Model are mass.

37:30.460 --> 37:31.540
 They have no mass.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.340
 So the quarks, the electron, they don't have a mass.

37:33.340 --> 37:34.820
 Neither do these weak particles.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.740
 They don't have mass either.

37:36.740 --> 37:38.500
 What happens is they actually acquire mass

37:38.500 --> 37:40.420
 through another process.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.660
 They get it from somewhere else.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.780
 They don't actually have it intrinsically.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.500
 So this idea that was introduced by,

37:46.500 --> 37:47.740
 well, Peter Higgs is the most famous,

37:47.740 --> 37:49.380
 but actually there are about six people

37:49.380 --> 37:52.080
 that came up with the idea more or less at the same time,

37:52.080 --> 37:55.180
 is that you introduce a new quantum field,

37:55.180 --> 37:56.880
 which is another one of these invisible things

37:56.880 --> 37:58.100
 that's everywhere.

37:58.100 --> 38:01.500
 And it's through the interaction with this field

38:01.500 --> 38:02.660
 that particles get mass.

38:02.660 --> 38:07.380
 So you can think of say an electron in the Higgs field,

38:07.380 --> 38:10.900
 the Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron.

38:10.900 --> 38:12.900
 It's sort of drawn towards the electron.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.580
 And that energy that's stored in that field

38:15.580 --> 38:17.720
 around the electron is what we see

38:17.720 --> 38:19.320
 as the mass of the electron.

38:19.320 --> 38:21.740
 But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field,

38:21.740 --> 38:23.880
 then all the particles in nature would become massless

38:23.880 --> 38:26.540
 and fly around at the speed of light.

38:26.540 --> 38:31.540
 So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people,

38:32.540 --> 38:36.160
 other theorists to come up with a, well,

38:36.160 --> 38:39.500
 it was another, basically a unified theory

38:39.500 --> 38:41.580
 of the electromagnetic force and the weak force.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.060
 So once you bring in the Higgs field,

38:43.060 --> 38:45.620
 you can combine two of the forces into one.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.900
 So it turns out the electromagnetic force

38:47.900 --> 38:49.660
 and the weak force are just two aspects

38:49.660 --> 38:52.420
 of the same fundamental force.

38:52.420 --> 38:54.760
 And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies

38:54.760 --> 38:59.460
 that you see these two forces unifying effectively.

38:59.460 --> 39:04.260
 So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion,

39:04.260 --> 39:07.540
 like this is some, and then, I mean,

39:07.540 --> 39:10.660
 wasn't the Higgs called the God particle at some point?

39:10.660 --> 39:13.660
 It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah.

39:13.660 --> 39:17.880
 Yeah, but I mean, I remember because when I was hearing it,

39:17.880 --> 39:22.060
 I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of,

39:22.060 --> 39:26.340
 that unify a lot of our ideas of physics was my notion.

39:26.340 --> 39:29.020
 But maybe you can speak to that.

39:29.020 --> 39:32.540
 Is it as big of a leap as a God particle

39:32.540 --> 39:37.340
 or is it a Jesus particle, which, you know,

39:37.340 --> 39:39.020
 what's the big contribution of Higgs

39:39.020 --> 39:40.780
 in terms of this unification power?

39:40.780 --> 39:42.940
 Yeah, I mean, to understand that,

39:42.940 --> 39:45.060
 it maybe helps know the history a little bit.

39:45.060 --> 39:47.740
 So when the, what we call electroweak theory

39:47.740 --> 39:50.580
 was put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism

39:50.580 --> 39:53.280
 with the weak force and Higgs is involved in all of that.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.420
 So that theory, which was written in the mid 70s,

39:55.420 --> 39:59.380
 predicted the existence of four new particles,

39:59.380 --> 40:01.780
 the W plus boson, the W minus boson,

40:01.780 --> 40:03.500
 the Z boson and the Higgs boson.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.780
 So there were these four particles

40:04.780 --> 40:06.020
 that came with the theory,

40:06.020 --> 40:07.500
 that were predicted by the theory.

40:07.500 --> 40:11.620
 In 1983, 84, the W's and the Z particles

40:11.620 --> 40:14.320
 were discovered at an accelerator at CERN

40:14.320 --> 40:15.980
 called the super proton synchrotron,

40:15.980 --> 40:19.240
 which was a seven kilometer particle collider.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.820
 So three of the bits of this theory had already been found.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.560
 So people were pretty confident from the 80s

40:25.560 --> 40:27.060
 that the Higgs must exist

40:27.060 --> 40:30.800
 because it was a part of this family of particles

40:30.800 --> 40:33.020
 that this theoretical structure only works

40:33.020 --> 40:34.460
 if the Higgs is there.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.540
 So what then happens,

40:36.540 --> 40:37.380
 and so you've got this question about

40:37.380 --> 40:39.420
 why is the LHC the size it is?

40:39.420 --> 40:41.500
 Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in

40:41.500 --> 40:42.780
 was not built for the LHC.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.140
 It was built for a previous accelerator

40:45.140 --> 40:48.740
 called the large electron positron collider.

40:48.740 --> 40:53.740
 So that began operation in the late 80s, early 90s.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.220
 They basically, that's when they dug

40:55.220 --> 40:56.420
 the 27 kilometer tunnel.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.020
 They put this accelerator into it,

40:58.020 --> 40:59.860
 the collider that fires electrons

40:59.860 --> 41:02.660
 and anti electrons at each other, electrons and positrons.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.180
 So the purpose of that machine was,

41:05.180 --> 41:06.700
 well, it was actually to look for the Higgs.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.700
 That was one of the things it was trying to do.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.380
 It didn't have enough energy to do it in the end.

41:11.380 --> 41:13.820
 But the main thing it achieved was it studied

41:13.820 --> 41:17.540
 the W and the Z particles at very high precision.

41:17.540 --> 41:19.300
 So it made loads of these things.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.540
 Previously, you can only make a few of them

41:20.540 --> 41:21.460
 at the previous accelerator.

41:21.460 --> 41:24.500
 So you could study these really, really precisely.

41:24.500 --> 41:25.680
 And by studying their properties,

41:25.680 --> 41:28.220
 you could really test this electroweak theory

41:28.220 --> 41:29.820
 that had been invented in the 70s

41:29.820 --> 41:31.260
 and really make sure that it worked.

41:31.260 --> 41:36.260
 So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off,

41:36.380 --> 41:39.500
 people knew, well, okay, you never know

41:39.500 --> 41:41.420
 until you find the thing.

41:41.420 --> 41:43.000
 But people were really confident

41:43.000 --> 41:44.800
 this electroweak theory was right.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.820
 And that the Higgs almost,

41:46.820 --> 41:49.860
 the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist

41:49.860 --> 41:52.220
 because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work.

41:52.220 --> 41:54.000
 It'd be really weird if you could discover

41:54.000 --> 41:55.900
 and these particles, they all behave exactly

41:55.900 --> 41:57.320
 as your theory tells you they should.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.900
 But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.920
 So in a way, it depends how you look at it.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.780
 The discovery of the Higgs on its own

42:07.020 --> 42:09.980
 is obviously a huge achievement in many,

42:09.980 --> 42:12.300
 both experimentally and theoretically.

42:12.300 --> 42:15.260
 On the other hand, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle

42:15.260 --> 42:17.100
 where every piece has been filled in.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.020
 You have this beautiful image, there's one gap

42:19.020 --> 42:22.860
 and you kind of know that piece must be there somewhere.

42:22.860 --> 42:27.860
 So the discovery in itself, although it's important,

42:29.020 --> 42:30.420
 is not so interesting.

42:30.420 --> 42:34.340
 It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.020
 But what makes it interesting

42:36.020 --> 42:38.080
 is not that it just completes the standard model,

42:38.080 --> 42:39.980
 which is a theory that we've known

42:39.980 --> 42:44.780
 had the basic layout offs for 40 years or more now.

42:44.780 --> 42:48.420
 It's that the Higgs actually is a unique particle.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.540
 It's very different to any of the other particles

42:50.540 --> 42:51.860
 in the standard model.

42:51.860 --> 42:55.260
 And it's a theoretically very troublesome particle.

42:55.260 --> 42:59.240
 There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs,

42:59.240 --> 43:00.860
 but also opportunities.

43:00.860 --> 43:02.580
 So that we basically, we don't really understand

43:02.580 --> 43:06.260
 how such an object can exist in the form that it does.

43:06.260 --> 43:08.500
 So there are lots of reasons for thinking

43:08.500 --> 43:12.540
 that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles

43:12.540 --> 43:15.020
 or that it's perhaps made of other things.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.460
 So it's not a fundamental particle,

43:16.460 --> 43:17.940
 that it's made of smaller things.

43:17.940 --> 43:19.580
 I can talk about that if you like a bit.

43:19.580 --> 43:23.180
 That's still a notion, so the Higgs

43:23.180 --> 43:24.820
 might not be a fundamental particle,

43:24.820 --> 43:27.180
 that there might be some, it might, oh man.

43:27.180 --> 43:31.080
 So that is an idea, it's not been demonstrated to be true.

43:31.080 --> 43:33.820
 But I mean, all of these ideas basically come

43:33.820 --> 43:37.940
 from the fact that this is a problem

43:37.940 --> 43:40.100
 that motivated a lot of development in physics

43:40.100 --> 43:42.380
 in the last 30 years or so.

43:42.380 --> 43:44.780
 And it's this basic fact that the Higgs field,

43:44.780 --> 43:47.260
 which is this field that's everywhere in the universe,

43:47.260 --> 43:49.060
 this is the thing that gives mass to the particles.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.340
 And the Higgs field is different from all the other fields

43:51.340 --> 43:54.420
 in that, let's say you take the electromagnetic field,

43:54.420 --> 43:56.080
 which is, if we actually were to measure

43:56.080 --> 43:57.420
 the electromagnetic field in this room,

43:57.420 --> 43:58.900
 we would measure all kinds of stuff going on

43:58.900 --> 44:00.940
 because there's light, there's gonna be microwaves

44:00.940 --> 44:02.100
 and radio waves and stuff.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.940
 But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part

44:04.940 --> 44:07.660
 of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it

44:07.660 --> 44:10.060
 and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box.

44:10.060 --> 44:12.180
 The field would be almost zero,

44:12.180 --> 44:14.780
 apart from some little quantum fluctuations,

44:14.780 --> 44:16.980
 but basically it goes to naught.

44:16.980 --> 44:19.140
 The Higgs field has a value everywhere.

44:19.140 --> 44:20.700
 So it's a bit like the whole,

44:20.700 --> 44:23.440
 it's like the entire space has got this energy

44:23.440 --> 44:25.420
 stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero,

44:25.420 --> 44:28.860
 it's finite, it's a bit like having the temperature

44:28.860 --> 44:32.380
 of space raised to some background temperature.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.900
 And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles.

44:36.900 --> 44:40.460
 So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass

44:40.460 --> 44:42.440
 is through the interaction with this energy

44:42.440 --> 44:44.820
 that's stored in the Higgs field.

44:44.820 --> 44:49.820
 Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has

44:50.620 --> 44:55.620
 has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe

44:55.700 --> 44:58.140
 where interesting stuff can happen.

44:58.140 --> 45:00.660
 So if you push the Higgs field down,

45:00.660 --> 45:03.100
 it has a tendency to collapse to,

45:03.100 --> 45:04.020
 well, there's a tendency,

45:04.020 --> 45:05.620
 if you do your sort of naive calculations,

45:05.620 --> 45:08.260
 there are basically two possible likely configurations

45:08.260 --> 45:11.320
 for the Higgs field, which is either it's zero everywhere,

45:11.320 --> 45:12.480
 in which case you have a universe

45:12.480 --> 45:15.860
 which is just particles with no mass that can't form atoms

45:15.860 --> 45:18.060
 and just fly about at the speed of light,

45:18.060 --> 45:20.700
 or it explodes to an enormous value,

45:20.700 --> 45:21.820
 what we call the Planck scale,

45:21.820 --> 45:24.140
 which is the scale of quantum gravity.

45:24.140 --> 45:27.060
 And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong,

45:27.060 --> 45:28.900
 even an electron would become so massive

45:28.900 --> 45:31.200
 that it would collapse into a black hole.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.100
 And then you have a universe made of black holes

45:33.100 --> 45:34.940
 and nothing like us.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.640
 So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field

45:37.640 --> 45:40.180
 is to achieve the value that we see

45:40.180 --> 45:42.900
 requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics.

45:42.900 --> 45:45.340
 You have to fiddle around with the other fields

45:45.340 --> 45:47.340
 in the Standard Model and their properties

45:47.340 --> 45:50.780
 to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value

45:50.780 --> 45:53.100
 that allows atoms to exist.

45:53.100 --> 45:54.580
 This is deeply fishy.

45:54.580 --> 45:57.380
 People really dislike this.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.420
 Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be,

45:59.420 --> 46:00.840
 so two explanations.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.060
 One, there's a god that designed this perfectly,

46:03.060 --> 46:05.580
 and two is there's an infinite number

46:05.580 --> 46:07.020
 of alternate universes,

46:07.020 --> 46:10.300
 and we just happen to be in the one in which life

46:10.300 --> 46:12.380
 is possible, complexity.

46:12.380 --> 46:15.540
 So when you say, I mean, life, any kind of complexity,

46:15.540 --> 46:19.980
 that's not either complete chaos or black holes.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.760
 I mean, how does that make you feel?

46:22.760 --> 46:23.600
 What do you make of that?

46:23.600 --> 46:25.260
 That's such a fascinating notion

46:25.260 --> 46:28.340
 that this perfectly tuned field

46:28.340 --> 46:31.120
 that's the same everywhere is there.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.140
 What do you make of that?

46:33.140 --> 46:34.200
 Yeah, what do you make of that?

46:34.200 --> 46:35.300
 I mean, yeah, so you laid out

46:35.300 --> 46:36.660
 two of the possible explanations.

46:36.660 --> 46:37.500
 Really?

46:37.500 --> 46:38.820
 Some, well, yeah, I mean, well,

46:38.820 --> 46:41.060
 someone, some cosmic creator went,

46:41.060 --> 46:43.140
 yeah, let's fix that to be at the right level.

46:43.140 --> 46:44.420
 That's one possibility, I guess.

46:44.420 --> 46:45.900
 It's not a scientifically testable one,

46:45.900 --> 46:48.740
 but theoretically, I guess, it's possible.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.860
 Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be

46:50.860 --> 46:53.460
 not a designer, but couldn't there be just,

46:54.540 --> 46:55.980
 I guess I'm not sure what that would be,

46:55.980 --> 46:58.240
 but some kind of force that,

46:58.240 --> 47:03.240
 that some kind of mechanism

47:03.240 --> 47:08.240
 by which this kind of field is enforced

47:09.840 --> 47:11.920
 in order to create complexity,

47:11.920 --> 47:16.280
 basically forces that pull the universe

47:16.280 --> 47:19.800
 towards an interesting complexity.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.360
 I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people

47:21.360 --> 47:22.280
 who have those ideas.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.600
 I don't really subscribe to them.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.520
 As I'm saying, it sounds really stupid.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.120
 No, I mean, there are definitely people

47:27.120 --> 47:29.400
 that make those kind of arguments.

47:29.400 --> 47:33.040
 There's ideas that, I think it's Lee Smolin's idea,

47:33.040 --> 47:38.040
 or one, I think, that universes are born inside black holes.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.280
 And so, universes, they basically have

47:40.280 --> 47:42.480
 like Darwinian evolution of the universe,

47:42.480 --> 47:44.800
 where universes give birth to other universes.

47:44.800 --> 47:46.720
 And if universes where black holes can form

47:46.720 --> 47:48.760
 are more likely to give birth to more universes,

47:48.760 --> 47:51.260
 so you end up with universes which have similar laws.

47:51.260 --> 47:52.600
 I mean, I don't know, whatever.

47:52.600 --> 47:57.080
 Well, I talked to Lee recently on this podcast,

47:57.080 --> 48:02.080
 and he's a reminder to me that the physics community

48:02.360 --> 48:05.600
 has like so many interesting characters in it.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.960
 It's fascinating.

48:06.960 --> 48:08.040
 Anyway, sorry, so.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.120
 I mean, as an experimentalist, I tend to sort of think,

48:10.120 --> 48:12.760
 these are interesting ideas, but they're not really testable,

48:12.760 --> 48:14.720
 so I tend not to think about them very much.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.600
 So, I mean, going back to the science of this,

48:17.600 --> 48:19.120
 there is an explanation.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.240
 There is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs,

48:21.240 --> 48:25.200
 which doesn't involve multiverses or creators fiddling about

48:25.200 --> 48:26.560
 with the laws of physics.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.400
 If the most popular solution

48:28.400 --> 48:30.440
 was something called supersymmetry,

48:30.440 --> 48:34.800
 which is a theory which involves a new type of symmetry

48:34.800 --> 48:35.720
 of the universe.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.680
 In fact, it's one of the last types of symmetries

48:37.680 --> 48:38.560
 that it's possible to have

48:38.560 --> 48:40.400
 that we haven't already seen in nature,

48:40.400 --> 48:43.600
 which is a symmetry between force particles

48:43.600 --> 48:44.760
 and matter particles.

48:44.760 --> 48:47.880
 So what we call fermions, which are the matter particles

48:47.880 --> 48:49.920
 and bosons, which are force particles.

48:49.920 --> 48:52.600
 And if you have supersymmetry, then there is a super partner

48:52.600 --> 48:55.920
 for every particle in the standard model.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.520
 And without going into the details,

48:57.520 --> 48:59.320
 the effect of this basically is that you have

48:59.320 --> 49:01.320
 a whole bunch of other fields,

49:01.320 --> 49:04.240
 and these fields cancel out the effect

49:04.240 --> 49:05.680
 of the standard model fields,

49:05.680 --> 49:09.000
 and they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice sensible value.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.360
 So in supersymmetry, you naturally,

49:11.360 --> 49:14.280
 without any tinkering about with the constants of nature

49:14.280 --> 49:17.360
 or anything, you get a Higgs field with a nice value,

49:17.360 --> 49:18.960
 which is the one we see.

49:18.960 --> 49:20.200
 So this is one of the,

49:20.200 --> 49:22.000
 and supersymmetry's also got lots of other things

49:22.000 --> 49:22.840
 going for it.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.360
 It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle,

49:25.360 --> 49:27.000
 which would be great.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.120
 It potentially suggests that the strong force

49:30.120 --> 49:32.760
 and the electroweak force unify at high energy.

49:32.760 --> 49:35.360
 So lots of reasons people thought this was a productive idea.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.800
 And when the LHC was, just before it was turned on,

49:37.800 --> 49:39.600
 there was a lot of hype, I guess,

49:39.600 --> 49:42.440
 a lot of an expectation that we would discover

49:42.440 --> 49:44.280
 these super partners because,

49:44.280 --> 49:46.080
 and particularly the main reason was

49:46.080 --> 49:50.240
 that if supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs field

49:50.240 --> 49:52.960
 at this nice Goldilocks value,

49:52.960 --> 49:55.760
 these super particles should have a mass

49:55.760 --> 49:58.520
 around the energy that we're probing at the LHC,

49:58.520 --> 49:59.920
 around the energy of the Higgs.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.520
 So it was kind of thought, you discover the Higgs,

50:01.520 --> 50:03.600
 you probably discover super partners as well.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.200
 So once you start creating ripples in this Higgs field,

50:06.200 --> 50:08.680
 you should be able to see these kinds of,

50:08.680 --> 50:09.520
 you should be, yeah.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.000
 So the super fields would be there.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.320
 When I, at the very beginning I said,

50:12.320 --> 50:13.720
 we're probing the vacuum.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.200
 What I mean is really that, you know,

50:15.200 --> 50:16.680
 okay, let's say these super fields exist.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.200
 The vacuum contains super fields.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.160
 They're there, these supersymmetric fields.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.640
 If we hit them hard enough, we can make them vibrate.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.840
 We see super particles come flying out.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.320
 That's the sort of, that's the idea.

50:26.320 --> 50:27.160
 That's the whole, okay.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.000
 That's the whole point.

50:29.600 --> 50:30.680
 But we haven't.

50:30.680 --> 50:31.520
 But we haven't.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.240
 So, so far at least, I mean,

50:33.240 --> 50:37.960
 we've had now a decade of data taking at the LHC.

50:38.920 --> 50:41.760
 No signs of super partners have,

50:41.760 --> 50:43.360
 supersymmetric particles have been found.

50:43.360 --> 50:46.000
 In fact, no signs of any physics, any new particles

50:46.000 --> 50:47.520
 beyond the Standard Model have been found.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.520
 So supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.440
 There are other theories that involve

50:51.440 --> 50:53.160
 additional dimensions of space

50:53.160 --> 50:55.680
 or potentially involve the Higgs boson

50:55.680 --> 50:56.920
 being made of smaller things,

50:56.920 --> 50:58.360
 being made of other particles.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.480
 Yeah, that's an interesting, you know,

50:59.480 --> 51:00.560
 I haven't heard that before.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.320
 That's really, that's an interesting,

51:02.320 --> 51:03.640
 but can you maybe linger on that?

51:03.640 --> 51:06.400
 Like what, what could be,

51:06.400 --> 51:08.880
 what could the Higgs particle be made of?

51:08.880 --> 51:11.560
 Well, so the oldest, I think the original ideas about this

51:11.560 --> 51:14.080
 was these theories called technicolor,

51:14.080 --> 51:17.320
 which were basically like an analogy with the strong force.

51:17.320 --> 51:21.440
 So the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state

51:21.440 --> 51:24.480
 of two very strongly interacting particles

51:24.480 --> 51:25.560
 that were a bit like quarks.

51:25.560 --> 51:29.200
 So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things

51:29.200 --> 51:30.440
 with a super strong force.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.880
 So not the strong force, but a new force

51:31.880 --> 51:33.000
 that was very strong.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.480
 And the Higgs was a bound state of these, these objects.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.440
 And the Higgs would in principle, if that was right,

51:38.440 --> 51:42.400
 would be the first in a series of technicolor particles.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.560
 Technicolor, I think not being a theorist,

51:45.560 --> 51:48.120
 but it's not, it's basically not done very well,

51:48.120 --> 51:49.600
 particularly since the LHC found the Higgs,

51:49.600 --> 51:52.360
 that kind of, it rules out, you know,

51:52.360 --> 51:53.440
 a lot of these technicolor theories,

51:53.440 --> 51:55.440
 but there are other things that are a bit like technicolor.

51:55.440 --> 52:00.440
 So there's a theory called partial composite,

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
 which is an idea that some of my colleagues

52:02.560 --> 52:04.360
 at Cambridge have worked on,

52:04.360 --> 52:06.840
 which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs

52:06.840 --> 52:10.440
 is a bound state of some strongly interacting particles,

52:10.440 --> 52:13.000
 and that the standard model particles themselves,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.120
 the more exotic ones like the top quark

52:16.000 --> 52:20.480
 are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles.

52:20.480 --> 52:23.320
 So it's a kind of an extension to the standard model,

52:23.320 --> 52:25.280
 which explains this problem

52:25.280 --> 52:28.560
 with the Higgs bosons, Goldilocks value,

52:28.560 --> 52:31.160
 but also helps us understand we have,

52:31.160 --> 52:32.840
 we're in a situation now, again,

52:32.840 --> 52:34.480
 a bit like the periodic table,

52:34.480 --> 52:38.640
 where we have six quarks, six leptons in this kind of,

52:38.640 --> 52:40.000
 you can arrange in this nice table

52:40.000 --> 52:42.480
 and you can see these columns where the patterns repeat

52:42.480 --> 52:46.160
 and you go, okay, maybe there's something deeper

52:46.160 --> 52:47.640
 going on here, you know,

52:47.640 --> 52:49.640
 and so this would potentially be something,

52:49.640 --> 52:52.880
 this partial composite theory could explain,

52:52.880 --> 52:54.360
 a sort of enlarge this picture

52:54.360 --> 52:56.480
 that allows us to see the whole symmetrical pattern

52:56.480 --> 52:59.120
 and understand what the ingredients, why do we have,

52:59.120 --> 53:02.160
 so one of the big questions in particle physics is,

53:02.160 --> 53:06.240
 why are there three copies of the matter particles?

53:06.240 --> 53:07.920
 So in what we call the first generation,

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
 which is what we're made of,

53:08.920 --> 53:11.760
 there's the electron, the electron neutrino,

53:11.760 --> 53:13.160
 the up quark and the down quark,

53:13.160 --> 53:15.640
 they're the most common matter particles in the universe,

53:15.640 --> 53:18.800
 but then there are copies of these four particles

53:18.800 --> 53:20.360
 in the second and the third generations,

53:20.360 --> 53:23.120
 so things like nuons and top quarks and other stuff,

53:23.120 --> 53:25.240
 we don't know why, we see these patterns,

53:25.240 --> 53:26.440
 we have no idea where it comes from,

53:26.440 --> 53:28.880
 so that's another big question, you know,

53:28.880 --> 53:32.920
 can we find out the deeper order that explains

53:32.920 --> 53:36.440
 this particular periodic table of particles that we see?

53:36.440 --> 53:40.240
 Is it possible that the deeper order includes

53:40.240 --> 53:42.400
 like almost a single entity,

53:42.400 --> 53:44.960
 so like something that I guess like string theory

53:44.960 --> 53:49.960
 dreams about, is this essentially the dream,

53:50.240 --> 53:54.120
 is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?

53:54.120 --> 53:55.640
 Yeah, I mean, that is the dream,

53:55.640 --> 53:59.480
 and I think for some people, for a lot of people,

53:59.480 --> 54:00.400
 it still is the dream,

54:00.400 --> 54:03.800
 so there's a great book by Steven Weinberg,

54:03.800 --> 54:05.760
 who is one of the theoretical physicists

54:05.760 --> 54:08.360
 who was instrumental in building the Standard Model,

54:08.360 --> 54:12.000
 so he came up with some others with the electroweak theory,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.560
 the theory that unified electromagnetism and the weak force,

54:14.560 --> 54:15.680
 and he wrote this book,

54:15.680 --> 54:18.080
 I think it was towards the end of the 80s, early 90s,

54:18.080 --> 54:20.000
 called Dreams of a Final Theory,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.920
 which is a very lovely, quite short book

54:22.920 --> 54:26.200
 about this idea of a final unifying theory

54:26.200 --> 54:27.560
 that brings everything together,

54:27.560 --> 54:29.440
 and I think you get a sense reading his book

54:29.440 --> 54:31.760
 written at the end of the 80s, early 90s,

54:31.760 --> 54:35.600
 that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming,

54:37.760 --> 54:39.200
 and that was the time when string theory

54:39.200 --> 54:41.960
 was very exciting, so string theory,

54:41.960 --> 54:44.080
 there's been this thing called the superstring revolution,

54:44.080 --> 54:46.080
 and theoretical physicists were very excited,

54:46.080 --> 54:47.960
 they discovered these theoretical objects,

54:47.960 --> 54:49.440
 these little vibrating loops of string

54:49.440 --> 54:52.440
 that in principle not only was a quantum theory of gravity

54:52.440 --> 54:54.840
 but could explain all the particles in the Standard Model

54:54.840 --> 54:55.760
 and bring it all together,

54:55.760 --> 54:59.520
 and as you say, you have one object, the string,

54:59.520 --> 55:02.560
 and you can pluck it, and the way it vibrates

55:02.560 --> 55:03.840
 gives you these different notes,

55:03.840 --> 55:05.960
 each of which is a different particle,

55:05.960 --> 55:08.160
 so it's a very lovely idea,

55:08.160 --> 55:11.920
 but the problem is that, well, there's a few,

55:11.920 --> 55:14.680
 people discover that mathematics is very difficult,

55:14.680 --> 55:17.640
 so people have spent three decades or more

55:17.640 --> 55:19.120
 trying to understand string theory,

55:19.120 --> 55:21.520
 and I think if you spoke to most string theorists,

55:21.520 --> 55:22.640
 they would probably freely admit

55:22.640 --> 55:24.920
 that no one really knows what string theory is yet,

55:24.920 --> 55:26.000
 I mean, there's been a lot of work,

55:26.000 --> 55:27.320
 but it's not really understood,

55:27.320 --> 55:31.240
 and the other problem is that string theory

55:31.240 --> 55:34.040
 mostly makes predictions about physics

55:34.040 --> 55:36.560
 that occurs at energies far beyond

55:36.560 --> 55:40.600
 what we will ever be able to probe in the laboratory.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.200
 Yeah, probably ever.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.840
 By the way, so sorry to take a million tangents,

55:44.840 --> 55:48.080
 but is there room for complete innovation

55:48.080 --> 55:50.240
 of how to build a particle collider

55:50.240 --> 55:52.720
 that could give us an order of magnitude increase

55:52.720 --> 55:55.200
 in the kind of energies,

55:55.200 --> 55:58.520
 or do we need to keep just increasing the size of things?

55:58.520 --> 56:00.920
 I mean, maybe, yeah, I mean, there are ideas,

56:00.920 --> 56:03.920
 to give you a sense of the gulf that has to be bridged.

56:03.920 --> 56:08.920
 So the LHC collides particles at an energy

56:09.320 --> 56:13.440
 of what we call 14 tera electron volts,

56:13.440 --> 56:15.040
 so that's basically the equivalent

56:15.040 --> 56:19.200
 if you've accelerated a proton through 14 trillion volts.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.520
 That gets us to the energies

56:20.520 --> 56:23.240
 where the Higgs and these weak particles live.

56:23.240 --> 56:24.480
 They're very massive.

56:24.480 --> 56:27.760
 The scale where strings become manifest

56:27.760 --> 56:29.320
 is something called the Planck scale,

56:29.320 --> 56:31.960
 which I think is of the order 10 to the,

56:31.960 --> 56:33.720
 hang on, get this right,

56:33.720 --> 56:35.840
 it's 10 to the 18 giga electron volts,

56:35.840 --> 56:40.840
 so about 10 to the 15 tera electron volts.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.760
 So you're talking trillions of times more energy.

56:44.760 --> 56:49.760
 Yeah, 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 14th larger, I don't even.

56:49.760 --> 56:50.840
 It's of that order.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.680
 It's a very big number.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.400
 So we're not talking just an order

56:54.400 --> 56:55.600
 of magnitude increase in energy,

56:55.600 --> 56:58.600
 we're talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.160
 So to give you a sense of what that would look like,

57:01.160 --> 57:03.000
 were you to build a particle accelerator

57:03.000 --> 57:04.760
 with today's technology.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.960
 Bigger or smaller than our solar system?

57:07.960 --> 57:09.120
 The size of the galaxy.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.040
 The galaxy.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.480
 So you'd need to put a particle accelerator

57:11.480 --> 57:14.560
 that circled the Milky Way to get to the energies

57:14.560 --> 57:17.600
 where you would see strings if they exist.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.400
 So that is a fundamental problem,

57:20.400 --> 57:22.600
 which is that most of the predictions

57:22.600 --> 57:26.040
 of these unified theories, quantum theories of gravity,

57:26.040 --> 57:29.200
 only make statements that are testable at energies

57:29.200 --> 57:31.160
 that we will not be able to probe,

57:32.200 --> 57:35.200
 and barring some unbelievable,

57:35.200 --> 57:37.160
 completely unexpected technological

57:37.160 --> 57:38.080
 or scientific breakthrough,

57:38.080 --> 57:40.000
 which is almost impossible to imagine.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.800
 You never say never, but it seems very unlikely.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.120
 Yeah, I can just see the news story.

57:45.120 --> 57:48.840
 Elon Musk decides to build a particle collider

57:48.840 --> 57:51.080
 the size of our galaxy.

57:51.080 --> 57:51.920
 We'd have to get together

57:51.920 --> 57:55.120
 with all our galactic neighbors to pay for it, I think.

57:55.120 --> 57:56.720
 What is the exciting possibilities

57:56.720 --> 57:58.960
 of the Large Hadron Collider?

57:58.960 --> 58:00.640
 What is there to be discovered

58:00.640 --> 58:04.160
 in this order of magnitude of scale?

58:04.160 --> 58:09.160
 Is there other bigger efforts on the horizon in this space?

58:09.800 --> 58:12.720
 What are the open problems, the exciting possibilities?

58:12.720 --> 58:14.560
 You mentioned supersymmetry.

58:14.560 --> 58:17.600
 Yeah, so, well, there are lots of new ideas.

58:17.600 --> 58:18.920
 Well, there are lots of problems that we're facing.

58:18.920 --> 58:20.160
 So there's a problem with the Higgs field,

58:20.160 --> 58:23.320
 which supersymmetry was supposed to solve.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.720
 There's the fact that 95% of the universe

58:25.720 --> 58:29.360
 we know from cosmology, astrophysics, is invisible,

58:29.360 --> 58:31.840
 that it's made of dark matter and dark energy,

58:31.840 --> 58:33.520
 which are really just words

58:33.520 --> 58:35.360
 for things that we don't know what they are.

58:35.360 --> 58:37.920
 It's what Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.880
 So we know we don't know what they are.

58:39.880 --> 58:42.480
 Well, that's better than unknown unknown.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.800
 Yeah, well, there may be some unknown unknowns,

58:43.800 --> 58:47.360
 but by definition we don't know what those are, so, yeah.

58:47.360 --> 58:52.360
 But the hope is a particle accelerator

58:52.480 --> 58:55.560
 could help us make sense of dark energy, dark matter.

58:55.560 --> 58:57.680
 There's still, there's some hope for that?

58:57.680 --> 58:58.760
 There's hope for that, yeah.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.400
 So one of the hopes is the LHC could produce

59:01.400 --> 59:03.800
 a dark matter particle in its collisions.

59:03.800 --> 59:08.360
 And it may be that the LHC

59:08.360 --> 59:09.920
 will still discover new particles,

59:09.920 --> 59:11.920
 that it might still, supersymmetry could still be there.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.320
 It's just maybe more difficult to find

59:14.320 --> 59:15.640
 than we thought originally.

59:15.640 --> 59:18.520
 And dark matter particles might be being produced,

59:18.520 --> 59:20.600
 but we're just not looking in the right part of the data

59:20.600 --> 59:22.120
 for them, that's possible.

59:22.120 --> 59:23.320
 It might be that we need more data,

59:23.320 --> 59:24.800
 that these processes are very rare

59:24.800 --> 59:26.600
 and we need to collect lots and lots of data

59:26.600 --> 59:27.600
 before we see them.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.880
 But I think a lot of people would say now

59:29.880 --> 59:33.720
 that the chances of the LHC

59:33.720 --> 59:36.000
 directly discovering new particles

59:36.000 --> 59:37.760
 in the near future is quite slim.

59:37.760 --> 59:40.800
 It may be that we need a decade more data

59:40.800 --> 59:43.920
 before we can see something, or we may not see anything.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.480
 That's the, that's where we are.

59:45.480 --> 59:48.960
 So, I mean, the physics, the experiments that I work on,

59:48.960 --> 59:50.760
 so I work on a detector called LHCb,

59:50.760 --> 59:52.760
 which is one of these four big detectors

59:52.760 --> 59:54.400
 that are spaced around the ring.

59:54.400 --> 59:57.520
 And we do slightly different stuff to the big guys.

59:57.520 --> 1:00:00.600
 There's two big experiments called Atlas and CMS,

1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:02.720
 3000 physicists and scientists

1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:04.760
 and computer scientists on them each.

1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:06.080
 They are the ones that discovered the Higgs

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:08.560
 and they look for supersymmetry and dark matter and so on.

1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:11.200
 What we look at are standard model particles

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:14.880
 called bequarks, which depending on your preferences,

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.600
 either bottom or beauty,

1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:18.800
 we tend to say beauty because it sounds sexier.

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:20.440
 Yeah, for sure.

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:22.680
 But these particles are interesting

1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:25.840
 because they have, we can make lots of them.

1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:28.880
 We make billions or hundreds of billions of these things.

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:31.560
 You can therefore measure their properties very precisely.

1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:34.400
 So you can make these really lovely precision measurements.

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:39.400
 And what we are doing really is a sort of complimentary thing

1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:41.920
 to the other big experiments, which is they,

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:44.120
 if you think of the sort of analogy they often use is,

1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:45.800
 if you imagine you're looking in, you're in the jungle

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.680
 and you're looking for an elephant, say,

1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:52.040
 and you are a hunter and you're kind of like,

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.520
 let's say there's the relevance, very rare.

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.440
 You don't know where in the jungle, the jungle's big.

1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:56.760
 So there's two ways you go about this.

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:58.720
 Either you can go wandering around the jungle

1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:00.160
 and try and find the elephant.

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:01.320
 The problem is if the elephant,

1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:02.720
 if there's only one elephant and the jungle's big,

1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:04.760
 the chances of running into it are very small.

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:07.200
 Or you could look on the ground

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:09.200
 and see if you see footprints left by the elephant.

1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:11.480
 And if the elephant's moving around, you've got a chance,

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:12.320
 that you're better chance maybe

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:13.880
 of seeing the elephant's footprints.

1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:16.080
 If you see the footprints, you go, okay, there's an elephant.

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:18.320
 I maybe don't know what kind of elephant it is,

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.000
 but I got a sense there's something out there.

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.600
 So that's sort of what we do.

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:23.040
 We are the footprint people.

1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.800
 We are, we're looking for the footprints,

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:28.800
 the impressions that quantum fields

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:32.600
 that we haven't managed to directly create the particle of,

1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:33.960
 the effects these quantum fields have

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:35.560
 on the ordinary standard model fields

1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:36.480
 that we already know about.

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:39.760
 So these B particles, the way they behave

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.720
 can be influenced by the presence of say,

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:45.200
 super fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like.

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.640
 And the way they decay and behave can be altered slightly

1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:52.480
 from what our theory tells us they ought to behave.

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:54.600
 And it's easier to collect huge amounts of data

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.600
 on B quarks.

1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:58.440
 We get billions and billions of these things.

1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:00.280
 You can make very precise measurements.

1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:03.200
 And the only place really at the LHC

1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:05.200
 or really in high energy physics at the moment

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.920
 where there's fairly compelling evidence

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.960
 that there might be something beyond the standard model

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:15.320
 is in these B, these beauty quarks decays.

1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:18.640
 Just to clarify, which is the difference

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.320
 between the different, the four experiments,

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:21.600
 for example, that you mentioned,

1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:24.760
 is it the kind of particles that are being collided?

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:27.160
 Is it the energies which they're collided?

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:28.960
 What's the fundamental difference

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.440
 between the different experiments?

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:32.280
 The collisions are the same.

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.480
 What's different is the design of the detectors.

1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:37.040
 So Atlas and CMS are called,

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:39.760
 they're called what are called general purpose detectors.

1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.360
 And they are basically barrel shaped machines

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:44.440
 and the collisions happen in the middle of the barrel

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:46.600
 and the barrel captures all the particles

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.040
 that go flying out in every direction.

1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:49.840
 So in a sphere effectively that can fly out

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:51.840
 and it can record all of those particles.

1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:54.720
 And what's the, sorry to be interrupting,

1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:57.440
 but what's the mechanism of the recording?

1:02:57.440 --> 1:02:59.520
 Oh, so these detectors, if you've seen pictures of them,

1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:03.080
 they're huge, like Atlas is 25 meters high

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:06.440
 and 45 meters long, they're vast machines,

1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:09.600
 instruments, I guess you should call them really.

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:11.760
 They are, they're kind of like onions.

1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:15.360
 So they have layers, concentric layers of detectors,

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:16.480
 different sorts of detectors.

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:18.160
 So close into the beam pipe,

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.600
 you have what are called usually made of silicon,

1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:21.720
 they're tracking detectors.

1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:23.600
 So they're little made of strips of silicon

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:24.960
 or pixels of silicon.

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.800
 And when a particle goes through the silicon,

1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:28.520
 it gives a little electrical signal

1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:30.280
 and you get these dots, electrical dots

1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:31.440
 through your detector, which allows you

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:34.120
 to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle.

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:34.960
 So that's the middle

1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:36.280
 and then the outsides of these detectors,

1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.720
 you have things called calorimeters,

1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:39.600
 which measure the energies of the particles

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:42.640
 and the very edge you have things called muon chambers,

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:44.680
 which basically these muon particles,

1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:46.720
 which are the heavy version of the electron,

1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.440
 they're like high velocity bullets

1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:50.120
 and they can get right to the edge of the detectors.

1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:52.480
 If you see something at the edge, that's a muon.

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:54.000
 So that's broadly how they work.

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.720
 And all of that is being recorded.

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.280
 That's all being fed out to, you know, computers.

1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:00.800
 Data must be awesome, okay.

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.000
 So LHCb is different.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.680
 So we, because we're looking for these be quarks,

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.960
 be quarks tend to be produced along the beam line.

1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:10.640
 So in a collision, the be quark tend to fly

1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:12.840
 sort of close to the beam pipe.

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:15.520
 So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped

1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:18.120
 basically, that just looks in one direction.

1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:20.280
 So we ignore, if you have your collision,

1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:21.120
 stuff goes everywhere.

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.400
 We ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways.

1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:26.240
 We're just looking in this little region

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:27.080
 close to the beam pipe

1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:28.720
 where most of these be quarks are made.

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.720
 So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved

1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:37.600
 in the collection of the be quark trajectories?

1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:38.720
 There are some differences.

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.840
 So one of the differences is that,

1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:42.600
 one of the ways you know you've seen a be quark

1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:44.880
 is that be quarks are actually quite long lived

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:45.920
 by particle standards.

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:49.120
 So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second,

1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:50.600
 which is if you're a fundamental particle

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:51.640
 is a very long time.

1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:54.600
 Cause the Higgs boson, I think lives for about

1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:57.240
 a trillionth of a trillionth of a second,

1:04:57.240 --> 1:04:58.400
 or maybe even less than that.

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:00.760
 So these are quite long lived things

1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:02.600
 and they will actually fly a little distance

1:05:02.600 --> 1:05:03.440
 before they decay.

1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:06.280
 So they will fly a few centimeters maybe if you're lucky,

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:07.920
 then they'll decay into other stuff.

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.360
 So what we need to do in the middle of the detector,

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:12.160
 you wanna be able to see,

1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.560
 you have your place where the protons crash into each other

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.880
 and that produces loads of particles that come flying out.

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:18.960
 So you have loads of lines, loads of tracks

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:21.320
 that point back to that proton collision.

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:23.400
 And then you're looking for a couple of other tracks,

1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:25.880
 maybe two or three that point back to a different place

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.360
 that's maybe a few centimeters away

1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.400
 from the proton collision.

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:31.560
 And that's the sign that a little B particle has flown

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.240
 a few centimeters and decayed somewhere else.

1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:36.760
 So we need to be able to very accurately resolve

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:39.480
 the proton collision from the B particle decay.

1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:42.360
 So the middle of our detector is very sensitive

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.160
 and it gets very close to the collision.

1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:46.520
 So you have this really beautiful delicate

1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:48.360
 silicon detector that sits,

1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:52.360
 I think it's seven millimeters from the beam.

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:53.920
 And the LHC beam has as much energy

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:55.200
 as a jumbo jet at takeoff.

1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:57.360
 So it's enough to melt a ton of copper.

1:05:57.360 --> 1:05:59.840
 So you have this furiously powerful thing sitting next

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:02.320
 to this tiny delicate silicon sensor.

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:07.120
 So those aspects of our detector that are specialized

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.840
 to measure these particular B quarks

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:10.880
 that we're interested in.

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.960
 And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:15.360
 that there's some mention of matter and antimatter

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:18.280
 connected to the B, these beautiful quarks.

1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:21.600
 Is that, what's the connection?

1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:25.880
 Yeah, what's the connection there?

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:28.280
 Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that

1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:31.880
 when you produce these B particles,

1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:33.760
 these particles, because you don't see the B quark,

1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:35.400
 you see the thing that B quark is inside.

1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.960
 So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles,

1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:40.640
 where the B quark is joined together with another quark

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:43.400
 or two, maybe two other quarks, depending on what it is.

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:46.160
 They're a particular set of these B particles

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:49.480
 that exhibit this property called oscillation.

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.280
 So if you make a, for the sake of argument,

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:55.440
 a matter version of one of these B particles,

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:58.840
 as it travels, because of the magic of quantum mechanics,

1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:01.040
 it oscillates backwards and forwards

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:03.880
 between its matter and antimatter versions.

1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:06.720
 So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards.

1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:09.160
 And what we can use this for is a laboratory

1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:12.880
 for testing the symmetry between matter and antimatter.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:15.680
 So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise,

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:20.040
 it's exact, then we should see these B particles decaying

1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:21.840
 as often as matter, as they do as antimatter,

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:23.360
 because this oscillation should be even.

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:26.000
 It should spend as much time in each state.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000
 But what we actually see is that one of the states,

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.720
 it spends more time and it's more likely to decay

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:32.800
 in one state than the other.

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:36.960
 So this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:39.160
 between matter and antimatter.

1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:42.400
 So what can you, sort of returning to the question

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.480
 before about this fundamental symmetry,

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.520
 it seems like if there's perfect symmetry

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.560
 between matter and antimatter,

1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:54.600
 if we have the equal amount of each in our universe,

1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:57.000
 it would just destroy itself.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.760
 And just like you mentioned,

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:00.920
 we seem to live in a very unlikely universe

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:03.520
 where it doesn't destroy itself.

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:07.280
 So do you have some intuition about why that is?

1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:10.160
 I mean, well, I'm not a theorist.

1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:11.680
 I don't have any particular ideas myself.

1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:13.120
 I mean, I sort of do measurements

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:14.200
 to try and test these things,

1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:16.000
 but I mean, so the terms of the basic problem

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.800
 is that in the Big Bang,

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.240
 if you use the standard model to figure out

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:20.120
 what ought to have happened,

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.640
 you should have got equal amounts of matter

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:22.480
 and antimatter made,

1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:23.880
 because whenever you make a particle

1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:25.440
 in our collisions, for example,

1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:26.800
 when we collide stuff together,

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:28.440
 you make a particle, you make an antiparticle.

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:29.480
 They always come together.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:30.920
 They always annihilate together.

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:33.440
 So there's no way of making more matter than antimatter

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.040
 that we've discovered so far.

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:36.080
 So that means in the Big Bang,

1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:38.200
 you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter.

1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:41.720
 As the universe expands and cools down during the Big Bang,

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.240
 not very long after the Big Bang,

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:45.040
 I think a few seconds after the Big Bang,

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:47.280
 you have this event called the Great Annihilation,

1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:49.840
 which is where all the particles and antiparticles

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:53.520
 smack into each other, annihilate, turn into light mostly,

1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:55.000
 and you end up with a universe later on.

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:55.960
 If that was what happened,

1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:58.800
 then the universe we live in today would be black and empty,

1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:01.600
 apart from some photons, that would be it.

1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.560
 So there is stuff in the universe.

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:04.960
 It appears to be just made of matter.

1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:08.200
 So there's this big mystery as to how did this happen?

1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:09.720
 And there are various ideas,

1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:13.520
 which all involve sort of physics going on

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:17.040
 in the first trillionth of a second or so of the Big Bang.

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.080
 So it could be that one possibility

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:22.600
 is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in this,

1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:25.360
 that there was this event that took place

1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:27.680
 in the early universe where the Higgs field

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:31.400
 basically switched on, it acquired its modern value.

1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:33.480
 And when that happened,

1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:35.600
 this caused all the particles to acquire mass

1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:37.880
 and the universe basically went through a phase transition

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:41.000
 where you had a hot plasma of massless particles.

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.040
 And then in that plasma,

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:44.760
 it's almost like a gas turning into droplets of water.

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:47.960
 You get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe

1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.760
 where the Higgs field has acquired its modern value,

1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:52.280
 the particles have got mass.

1:09:52.280 --> 1:09:55.200
 And this phase transition in some models

1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.960
 can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced,

1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:00.640
 depending on how matter bounces off these bubbles

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:01.760
 in the early universe.

1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:02.760
 So that's one idea.

1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:04.680
 There's other ideas to do with neutrinos,

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:06.360
 that there are exotic types of neutrinos

1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:09.280
 that can decay in a biased way to just matter

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.200
 and not to antimatter.

1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:12.640
 So, and people are trying to test these ideas.

1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:14.280
 That's what we're trying to do at LHCb.

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.720
 There's neutrino experiments planned

1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:17.560
 that are trying to do these sorts of things as well.

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.560
 So yeah, there are ideas, but at the moment,

1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:22.920
 no clear evidence for which of these ideas might be right.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:25.520
 So we're talking about some incredible ideas.

1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:28.320
 By the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent

1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:31.680
 about describing even just the standard model.

1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:34.520
 So I'm in awe just listening.

1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:35.360
 Oh, thank you.

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:38.080
 Yeah, just having fun enjoying it.

1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:40.280
 So the, yes, the theoretical,

1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:42.520
 the particle physics is fascinating here.

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.680
 To me, one of the most fascinating things

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.880
 about the Large Hadron Collider is the human side of it.

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:51.520
 That a bunch of sort of brilliant people

1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:54.360
 that probably have egos got together

1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:57.720
 and were collaborate together and countries,

1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:00.000
 I guess, collaborate together for the funds

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000
 and everything's just collaboration everywhere.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.440
 Cause you may be, I don't know what the right question here

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:09.680
 to ask, but almost what's your intuition

1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:11.840
 about how it was possible to make this happen

1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:14.360
 and what are the lessons we should learn

1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.080
 for the future of human civilization

1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:17.840
 in terms of our scientific progress?

1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.600
 Cause it seems like this is a great, great illustration

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:24.640
 of us working together to do something big.

1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:27.040
 Yeah, I think it's possibly the best example.

1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:30.280
 Maybe I can think of international collaboration

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:33.400
 that isn't for some unpleasant purpose, basically.

1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:37.400
 You know, I mean, so when I started out in the field

1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:39.720
 in 2008 as a new PhD student,

1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:41.480
 the LHC was basically finished.

1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:44.600
 So I didn't have to go around asking for money for it

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:45.520
 or trying to make the case.

1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:48.760
 So I have huge admiration for the people who managed that.

1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:51.160
 Cause this was a project that was first imagined

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:53.440
 in the 1970s, in the late 70s

1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:56.440
 was when the first conversations about the LHC were mooted

1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:00.800
 and it took two and a half decades of campaigning

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:03.600
 and fundraising and persuasion

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:05.200
 until they started breaking ground

1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:08.040
 and building the thing in the early noughties in 2000.

1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:11.280
 So, I mean, I think the reason just from a sort of,

1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:13.280
 from the point of view of the sort of science,

1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:14.120
 the scientists there,

1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:16.680
 I think the reason it works ultimately

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:19.280
 is that everywhere, everyone there is there

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:23.680
 for the same reason, which is, well, in principle, at least

1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:25.520
 they're there because they're interested in the world.

1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:27.400
 They want to find out, you know,

1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:29.360
 what are the basic ingredients of our universe?

1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:31.040
 What are the laws of nature?

1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:32.920
 And so everyone is pulling in the same direction.

1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:34.720
 Now, of course, everyone has their own

1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:35.680
 things they're interested in.

1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:37.360
 Everyone has their own careers to consider.

1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:38.800
 And, you know, I wouldn't pretend that

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.760
 there isn't also a lot of competition.

1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:42.880
 So there's this funny thing in these experiments

1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:43.960
 where your collaborators,

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:46.120
 your 800 collaborators in LHCb,

1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:47.320
 but you're also competitors

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:49.920
 because your academics in your various universities

1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:51.520
 and you want to be the one that gets the paper out

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:53.400
 on the most exciting, you know, new measurements.

1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:55.720
 So there's this funny thing where you're kind of trying

1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:58.440
 to stake out your territory while also collaborating

1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:00.920
 and having to work together to make the experiments work.

1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:03.560
 And it does work amazingly well,

1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.160
 actually considering all of that.

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.760
 And I think there was actually,

1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:08.680
 I think McKinsey or one of these big management

1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:11.840
 consultancy firms went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago

1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:15.000
 to try to understand how these organizations function.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.040
 Did they figure it out?

1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:16.960
 I don't think they could.

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:18.800
 I mean, I think one of the things that's interesting,

1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:19.800
 one of the other interesting things

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:21.080
 about these experiments is, you know,

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:24.960
 they're big operations like say Atlas has 3000 people.

1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:26.320
 Now there was a person nominally

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:29.680
 who was the head of Atlas, they're called the spokesperson.

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:32.360
 And the spokesperson is elected by,

1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.240
 usually by the collaboration,

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:36.400
 but they have no actual power really.

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:38.560
 I mean, they can't fire anyone.

1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:39.720
 They're not anyone's boss.

1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:43.360
 So, you know, my boss is a professor at Cambridge,

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:45.120
 not the head of my experiments.

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.520
 The head of my experiment can't tell me what to do really.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:50.200
 And there's all these independent academics

1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:52.400
 who are their own bosses who, you know,

1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:54.600
 so that somehow it, nonetheless,

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:58.520
 by kind of consensus and discussion and lots of meetings,

1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:01.640
 these things do happen and it does get done, but.

1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:04.960
 It's like the queen here in the UK is the spokesperson.

1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:05.800
 I guess so.

1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:07.560
 No actual power. Except we don't elect her, no.

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:08.880
 No, we don't elect her.

1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:10.480
 But everybody seems to love her.

1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:13.040
 I don't know, from my outside perspective.

1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:19.840
 But yeah, giant egos, brilliant people.

1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:22.920
 And moving forward, do you think there's.

1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:24.800
 Actually, I would pick up one thing you said just there,

1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:25.840
 just the brilliant people thing.

1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:28.240
 Cause I'm not saying that people aren't great.

1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:30.600
 But I think there is this sort of impression

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.960
 that physicists all have to be brilliant or geniuses,

1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:34.160
 which is not true actually.

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:37.520
 And you know, you have to be relatively bright for sure.

1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:39.120
 But you know, a lot of people,

1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:41.560
 a lot of the most successful experimental physicists

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.960
 are not necessarily the people with the biggest brains.

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:45.680
 They're the people who, you know,

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:47.440
 particularly one of the skills that's most important

1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:49.560
 in particle physics is the ability to work

1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:51.320
 with others and to collaborate and exchange ideas

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:52.360
 and also to work hard.

1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:55.520
 And it's a sort of, often it's more a determination

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.520
 or a sort of other set of skills.

1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:00.320
 It's not just being, you know, kind of some great brain.

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:02.280
 Very true.

1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:04.160
 So, I mean, there's parallels to that

1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:05.160
 in the machine learning world.

1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:08.200
 If you wanna solve any real world problems,

1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:11.200
 which I see as the particle accelerators,

1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.920
 essentially a real world instantiation

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.720
 of theoretical physics.

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:20.280
 And for that, you have to not necessarily be brilliant,

1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.280
 but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous,

1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:29.840
 sort of unborable, stubborn, all those kind of qualities

1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:31.160
 that make for a great engineer.

1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.200
 So, scientists purely speaking,

1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:36.200
 that practitioner of the scientific method.

1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:37.400
 So you're right.

1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:39.800
 But nevertheless, to me that's brilliant.

1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:41.600
 My dad's a physicist.

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.040
 I argue with him all the time.

1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:46.000
 To me, engineering is the highest form of science.

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.360
 And he thinks that's all nonsense,

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.640
 that the real work is done by the theoretician.

1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:54.320
 So, in fact, we have arguments about like people

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:56.080
 like Elon Musk, for example,

1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:58.640
 because I think his work is quite brilliant,

1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:00.520
 but he's fundamentally not coming up

1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:02.480
 with any serious breakthroughs.

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:07.080
 He's just creating in this world, implementing,

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:09.640
 like making ideas happen that have a huge impact.

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:12.200
 To me, that's the Edison.

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:17.200
 That to me is a brilliant work,

1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:22.400
 but to him, it's messy details

1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:25.440
 that somebody will figure out anyway.

1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.640
 I mean, I don't know whether you think

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:29.000
 there is a actual difference in temperament

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.160
 between say a physicist and an engineer,

1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.000
 whether it's just what you got interested in.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.240
 I don't know.

1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:37.920
 I mean, a lot of what experimental physicists do

1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:40.040
 is to some extent engineering.

1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:40.880
 I mean, it's not what I do.

1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:42.120
 I mostly do data stuff,

1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:45.520
 but a lot of people would be called electrical engineers,

1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:46.960
 but they trained as physicists,

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.880
 but they learned electrical engineering, for example,

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:50.960
 because they were building detectors.

1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:52.880
 So, there's not such a clear divide, I think.

1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:53.720
 Yeah, it's interesting.

1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:55.600
 I mean, but there does seem to be,

1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:57.120
 like you work with data.

1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:59.920
 There does seem to be a certain,

1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:01.640
 like I love data collection.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:03.680
 There might be an OCD element or something

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.600
 that you're more naturally predisposed to

1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:07.600
 as opposed to theory.

1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:08.880
 Like I'm not afraid of data.

1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:10.160
 I love data.

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:11.680
 And there's a lot of people in machine learning

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.360
 who are more like,

1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:16.920
 they're basically afraid of data collection,

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:18.880
 afraid of data sets, afraid of all of that.

1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:20.720
 They just want to stay in more than theoretical

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.800
 and they're really good at it, space.

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.040
 So, I don't know if that's the genetic,

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:28.280
 that's your upbringing, the way you go to school,

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:33.280
 but looking into the future of LHC and other colliders.

1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:35.320
 So, there's in America,

1:17:35.320 --> 1:17:37.520
 there's whatever it was called, the super,

1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:38.360
 there's a lot of super.

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:39.840
 Superconducting super colliders.

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:40.840
 Yeah, superconducting.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:41.880
 The desertron, yeah.

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:43.000
 Desertron, yeah.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.880
 So, that was canceled, the construction of that.

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:46.720
 Yeah.

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.880
 Which is a sad thing,

1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:54.160
 but what do you think is the future of these efforts?

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:56.480
 Will a bigger collider be built?

1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:58.560
 Will LHC be expanded?

1:17:58.560 --> 1:17:59.920
 What do you think?

1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.360
 Well, in the near future, the LHC is gonna get an upgrade.

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:04.840
 So, that's pretty much confirmed.

1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:07.160
 I think it is confirmed, which is,

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:08.160
 it's not an energy upgrade.

1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:10.200
 It's what we call a luminosity upgrade.

1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:11.680
 So, it basically means increasing

1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:13.400
 the data collection rates.

1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.920
 So, more collisions per second, basically,

1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:18.160
 because after a few years of data taking,

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:19.560
 you get this law of diminishing returns

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.680
 where each year's worth of data

1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:21.960
 is a smaller and smaller fraction

1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:23.440
 of the lot you've already got.

1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:25.840
 So, to get a real improvement in sensitivity,

1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:27.200
 you need to increase the data rate

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:28.280
 by an order of magnitude.

1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:30.520
 So, that's what this upgrade is gonna do.

1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.680
 LHCb, at the moment, the whole detector

1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:36.240
 is basically being rebuilt to allow it to record data

1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:38.000
 at a much larger rate than we could before.

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:39.240
 So, that will make us sensitive

1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.680
 to whole loads of new processes

1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:42.200
 that we weren't able to study before.

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:45.760
 And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we've seen.

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:49.040
 So, we've seen a bunch of very intriguing anomalies

1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:51.400
 in these b quark decays,

1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:55.480
 which may be hinting at the first signs

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.360
 of this kind of the elephant,

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.640
 the signs of some new quantum field

1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:01.200
 or fields maybe beyond the standard model.

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:02.920
 It's not yet at the statistical threshold

1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:06.200
 where you can say that you've observed something,

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:08.840
 but there's lots of anomalies in many measurements

1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:11.040
 that all seem to be consistent with each other.

1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:12.000
 So, it's quite interesting.

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.600
 So, the upgrade will allow us

1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:15.840
 to really home in on these things

1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:17.360
 and see whether these anomalies are real,

1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:19.480
 because if they are real,

1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:20.880
 and this kind of connects to your point

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:23.720
 about the next generation of machines,

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:26.320
 what we would have seen then is,

1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:29.240
 we would have seen the tail end of some quantum field

1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:31.800
 in influencing these b quarks.

1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:34.520
 What we then need to do is to build a bigger collider

1:19:34.520 --> 1:19:37.480
 to actually make the particle of that field.

1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:40.240
 So, if these things really do exist.

1:19:40.240 --> 1:19:41.280
 So, that would be one argument.

1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:42.360
 I mean, so at the moment,

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.000
 Europe is going through this process

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.800
 of thinking about the strategy for the future.

1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:49.720
 So, there are a number of different proposals on the table.

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.600
 One is for a sort of higher energy upgrade of the LHC,

1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:55.280
 where you just build more powerful magnets

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:56.200
 and put them in the same tunnel.

1:19:56.200 --> 1:19:59.680
 That's a sort of cheaper, less ambitious possibility.

1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:00.840
 Most people don't really like it

1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:02.560
 because it's sort of a bit of a dead end,

1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:05.560
 because once you've done that, there's nowhere to go.

1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:06.840
 There's a machine called Click,

1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:08.960
 which is a compact linear collider,

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:10.720
 which is a electron positron collider

1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:13.440
 that uses a novel type of acceleration technology

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.520
 to accelerate at shorter distances.

1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:17.000
 We're still talking kilometers long,

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.880
 but not like 100 kilometers long.

1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:22.480
 And then probably the project that is,

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:23.920
 I think getting the most support,

1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:25.400
 it'd be interesting to see what happens,

1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:28.040
 something called the Future Circular Collider,

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:32.040
 which is a really ambitious longterm multi decade project

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:35.960
 to build a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel

1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:38.160
 under the Geneva region.

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:40.720
 The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine.

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:41.560
 It would just feed.

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:44.080
 So the same area, so it would be a feeder for the.

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:44.920
 Yeah.

1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:46.400
 So it would kind of, the edge of this machine

1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:47.640
 would be where the LHC is,

1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:49.120
 but it would sort of go under Lake Geneva

1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:51.560
 and round to the Alps, basically,

1:20:51.560 --> 1:20:52.920
 up to the edge of the Geneva basin.

1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:55.560
 So it's basically the biggest tunnel you can fit

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.240
 in the region based on the geology.

1:20:57.240 --> 1:20:58.080
 100 kilometers.

1:20:58.080 --> 1:20:58.920
 Yeah, so it's big.

1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:01.880
 It'd be a long drive if your experiment's on one side.

1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:03.080
 You've got to go back to CERN for lunch,

1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:04.280
 so that would be a pain.

1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:07.600
 But you know, so this project is,

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.120
 in principle, it's actually two accelerators.

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:09.960
 The first thing you would do

1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:11.720
 is put an electron positron machine

1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:14.360
 in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs.

1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:15.440
 So you'd make lots of Higgs bows

1:21:15.440 --> 1:21:16.960
 and study it really precisely

1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.600
 in the hope that you see it misbehaving

1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:20.480
 and doing something it's not supposed to.

1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:22.880
 And then in the much longer term,

1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:24.840
 100, that machine gets taken out,

1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:26.520
 you put in a proton proton machine.

1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:29.040
 So it's like the LHC, but much bigger.

1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:30.440
 And that's the way you start going

1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:32.400
 and looking for dark matter,

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:35.960
 or you're trying to recreate this phase transition

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:37.120
 that I talked about in the early universe,

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.360
 where you can see matter anti matter being made,

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:40.200
 for example.

1:21:40.200 --> 1:21:41.080
 There's lots of things you can do with these machines.

1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.560
 The problem is that they will take,

1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:45.440
 you know, the most optimistic,

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:46.720
 you're not gonna have any data

1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:49.080
 from any of these machines until 2040,

1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:51.840
 or, you know, because they take such a long time to build

1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:52.920
 and they're so expensive.

1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:55.960
 So you have, there'll be a process of R&D design,

1:21:55.960 --> 1:21:57.960
 but also the political case being made.

1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:01.280
 So LHC, what costs a few billion?

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:03.200
 Depends how you count it.

1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:05.440
 I think most of the sort of more reasonable estimates

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:07.000
 that take everything into account properly,

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.400
 it's around the sort of 10, 11, 12 billion euro mark.

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:12.400
 What would be the future, sorry,

1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:13.240
 I forgot the name already.

1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:14.720
 Future Circular Collider.

1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:15.560
 Future Circular Collider.

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:16.920
 Presumably they won't call it that when it's built,

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:18.280
 cause it won't be the future anymore.

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:20.680
 But I don't know, I don't know what they'll call it then.

1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:25.120
 The very big Hadron Collider, I don't know.

1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:28.840
 But that will, now I should know the numbers,

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:31.160
 but I think the whole project is estimated

1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:32.880
 at about 30 billion euros,

1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:37.840
 but that's money spent over between now and 2070 probably,

1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:39.840
 which is when the last bit of it

1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:42.360
 would be sort of finishing up, I guess.

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:46.560
 So you're talking a half a century of science

1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:48.720
 coming out of this thing, shared by many countries.

1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:51.200
 So the actual cost, the arguments that are made

1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:53.120
 is that you could make this project fit

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:56.160
 within the existing budget of CERN,

1:22:56.160 --> 1:22:57.480
 if you didn't do anything else.

1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:00.520
 And CERN, by the way, we didn't mention, what is CERN?

1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:03.280
 CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:05.240
 It's an international organization

1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:07.080
 that was established in the 1950s

1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:10.280
 in the wake of the second world war as a kind of,

1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:12.520
 it was sort of like a scientific Marshall plan for Europe.

1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:16.080
 The idea was that you bring European science back together

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:17.320
 for peaceful purposes,

1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:20.000
 because what happened in the forties was,

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.280
 a lot of particular Jewish scientists,

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.640
 but a lot of scientists from central Europe

1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:25.000
 had fled to the United States

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.240
 and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain.

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:29.920
 So there was a desire to bring the community back together

1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:32.280
 for a project that wasn't building nasty bombs,

1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:34.280
 but was doing something that was curiosity driven.

1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:37.320
 So, and that has continued since then.

1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:38.840
 So it's kind of a unique organization.

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:41.480
 It's you, to be a member as a country,

1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:43.040
 you sort of sign up as a member

1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:45.960
 and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP

1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:47.360
 each year as a subscription.

1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:49.520
 I mean, it's a very small fraction, relatively speaking.

1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.480
 I think it's like, I think the UK's contribution

1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:54.840
 is a hundred or 200 million quid or something like that.

1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:57.480
 Yeah, which is quite a lot, but not so.

1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:58.400
 That's fascinating.

1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:00.040
 I mean, just the whole thing that is possible,

1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:01.240
 it's beautiful.

1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:02.240
 It's a beautiful idea,

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.320
 especially when there's no wars on the line,

1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:06.560
 it's not like we're freaking out,

1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:08.880
 as we're actually legitimately collaborating

1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:09.880
 to do good science.

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.880
 One of the things I don't think we really mentioned

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:15.360
 is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side,

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:17.080
 is there breakthroughs possible there

1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:18.160
 and the machine learning side,

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:22.680
 like is there a lot more signal to be mined

1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:25.400
 in more effective ways from the actual raw data?

1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.680
 Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that.

1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:31.600
 I mean, so I use machine learning in my data analysis,

1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:33.840
 but pretty naughty, basic stuff,

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:35.440
 cause I'm not a machine learning expert.

1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:37.960
 I'm just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff

1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:38.800
 for my day job.

1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:40.600
 So what a lot of people do is they use

1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:42.560
 kind of off the shelf packages

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:46.240
 that you can train to do signal noise.

1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:48.280
 Just clean up all the data.

1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.040
 But one of the big challenges,

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:52.720
 the big challenge of the data is A, it's volume,

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:53.880
 there's huge amounts of data.

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.480
 So the LHC generates, now, okay,

1:24:56.480 --> 1:24:57.920
 I try to remember what the actual numbers are,

1:24:57.920 --> 1:24:59.440
 but if you, we don't record all our data,

1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:02.240
 we record a tiny fraction of the data.

1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:04.920
 It's like of order one 10,000th or something, I think.

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:05.880
 Is that right?

1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:07.040
 Around that.

1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:08.600
 So most of it gets thrown away.

1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:10.080
 You couldn't record all the LHC data

1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:11.480
 cause it would fill up every computer in the world

1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:13.680
 in a matter of days, basically.

1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:17.000
 So there's this process that happens on live,

1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.880
 on the detector, something called a trigger,

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:21.360
 which in real time, 40 million times every second

1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:23.680
 has to make a decision about whether this collision

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:26.400
 is likely to contain an interesting object,

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:28.560
 like a Higgs boson or a dark matter particle.

1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:29.760
 And it has to do that very fast.

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:33.240
 And the software algorithms in the past

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.040
 were quite relatively basic.

1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:37.840
 They did things like measure mementos

1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:40.320
 and energies of particles and put some requirements.

1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:42.200
 So you would say, if there's a particle

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.640
 with an energy above some threshold,

1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:44.840
 then record this collision.

1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:46.240
 But if there isn't, don't.

1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:47.960
 Whereas now the attempt is get more and more

1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:51.080
 machine learning in at the earliest possible stage.

1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:53.160
 That's cool, at the stage of deciding

1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:55.280
 whether we want to keep this data or not.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:57.640
 But also maybe even lower down than that,

1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:01.160
 which is the point where there's this,

1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:02.800
 so generally how the data is reconstructed

1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:06.280
 is you start off with a set of digital hits

1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:07.120
 in your detector.

1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:08.840
 So channels saying, did you see something?

1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:10.120
 Did you not see something?

1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:12.560
 That has to be then turned into tracks,

1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.040
 particles going in different directions.

1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:15.520
 And that's done by using fits

1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:17.200
 that fit through the data points.

1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:18.640
 And then that's passed to the algorithms

1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:20.520
 that then go, is this interesting or not?

1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.520
 What'd be better is you could train machine learning

1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:24.120
 to just look at the raw hits,

1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.360
 the basic real base level information,

1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.440
 not have any of the reconstruction done.

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.040
 And it just goes, and it can learn to do pattern recognition

1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:34.240
 on this strange three dimensional image that you get.

1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:36.800
 And potentially that's where you could get really big gains

1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:38.760
 because our triggers tend to be quite inefficient

1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:41.880
 because they don't have time to do

1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.360
 the full whiz bang processing

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:45.400
 to get all the information out that we would like,

1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:46.760
 because you have to do the decision very quickly.

1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:48.760
 So if you can come up with some clever

1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:50.080
 machine learning technique,

1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:52.000
 then potentially you can massively increase

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.960
 the amount of useful data you record

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:58.400
 and get rid of more of the background

1:26:58.400 --> 1:26:59.800
 earlier in the process.

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:01.440
 Yeah, to me, that's an exciting possibility

1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:04.880
 because then you don't have to build a sort of,

1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:07.200
 you can get a gain without having to.

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:10.360
 Without having to build any hardware, I suppose.

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:11.200
 Hardware, yeah.

1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:13.960
 Although you need lots of new GPU farms, I guess.

1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:15.280
 So hardware still helps.

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:20.280
 But I got to talk to you,

1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.840
 sort of I'm not sure how to ask,

1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:27.480
 but you're clearly an incredible science communicator.

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.560
 I don't know if that's the right term,

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.520
 but you're basically a younger Neil deGrasse Tyson

1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:33.680
 with a British accent.

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:36.480
 So, and you've, I mean,

1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:39.160
 can you say where we are today, actually?

1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:42.560
 Yeah, so today we're in the Royal Institution in London,

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.880
 which is a very old organization.

1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:47.760
 It's been around for about 200 years now, I think.

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:49.800
 Maybe even I should know when it was founded.

1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:51.440
 Sort of early 19th century,

1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:55.880
 it was set up to basically communicate science to the public.

1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:57.560
 So it was one of the first places in the world

1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:01.240
 where famous scientists would come and give talks.

1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.440
 So very famously Humphrey Davy, who you may know of,

1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:07.560
 who was the person who discovered nitrous oxide.

1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:11.200
 He was a very famous chemist and scientist.

1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:12.720
 Also discovered electrolysis.

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:13.920
 So he used to do these fantastic,

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:15.040
 he was a very charismatic speaker.

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:15.880
 So he used to appear here.

1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:18.440
 There's a big desk that they usually have in the theater

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:21.160
 and he would do demonstrations to the sort of the,

1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:23.760
 the folk of London back in the early 19th century.

1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:25.200
 And Michael Faraday, who I talked about,

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:27.280
 who is the person who did so much work on electromagnetism,

1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:28.400
 he used, he lectured here.

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:29.880
 He also did experiments in the basement.

1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:31.240
 So this place has got a long history

1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:33.320
 of both scientific research,

1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:35.800
 but also communication of scientific research.

1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:38.040
 So you gave a few lectures here.

1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:39.320
 How many, two?

1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:41.080
 I've given, yeah, I've given a couple of lectures

1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:42.280
 in this theater before, so.

1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:46.000
 I mean, that's, so people should definitely go watch online.

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.640
 It's just the explanation of particle physics.

1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.480
 So all the, I mean, it's incredible.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.360
 Like your lectures are just incredible.

1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.520
 I can't sing it enough praise.

1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:55.480
 So it was awesome.

1:28:55.480 --> 1:29:00.280
 But maybe can you say, what did that feel like?

1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:03.600
 What does it feel like to lecture here, to talk about that?

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:06.440
 And maybe from a different perspective,

1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:09.360
 more kind of like how the sausage is made is,

1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.120
 how do you prepare for that kind of thing?

1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:14.320
 How do you think about communication,

1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:16.440
 the process of communicating these ideas

1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:18.480
 in a way that's inspiring to,

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:21.200
 what I would say your talks are inspiring

1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:22.560
 to like the general audience.

1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:25.080
 You don't actually have to be a scientist.

1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:28.040
 You can still be inspired without really knowing much of the,

1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:30.720
 you start from the very basics.

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:33.320
 So what's the preparation process?

1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:34.800
 And then the romantic question is,

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:38.000
 what did that feel like to perform here?

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:39.600
 I mean, profession, yeah.

1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:42.200
 I mean, the process, I mean, the talk,

1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:43.280
 my favorite talk that I gave here

1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:44.520
 was one called Beyond the Higgs,

1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.800
 which you can find on the Royal Institute's YouTube channel,

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:48.280
 which you should go and check out.

1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:50.000
 I mean, and their channel's got loads of great talks

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:51.760
 with loads of great people as well.

1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:55.160
 I mean, that one, I'd sort of given a version of it

1:29:55.160 --> 1:29:57.360
 many times, so part of it is just practice, right?

1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:59.000
 And actually, I don't have some great theory

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.360
 of how to communicate with people.

1:30:00.360 --> 1:30:02.640
 It's more just that I'm really interested

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:05.240
 and excited by those ideas and I like talking about them.

1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:07.280
 And through the process of doing that,

1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:09.640
 I guess I figured out stories that work

1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:10.840
 and explanations that work.

1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:12.920
 When you say practice, you mean legitimately

1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:14.960
 just giving talks? Just giving talks, yeah.

1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:17.240
 I started off when I was a PhD student

1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:20.040
 doing talks in schools and I still do that as well

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:21.760
 some of the time and doing things,

1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:23.200
 I've even done a bit of standup comedy,

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:25.240
 which sort of went reasonably well,

1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:26.280
 even if it was terrifying.

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:27.480
 And that's on YouTube as well.

1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:29.240
 That's also on, I wouldn't necessarily recommend

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:30.080
 you check that out.

1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:33.200
 I'm gonna post the links several places

1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:35.400
 to make sure people click on it.

1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:37.760
 But it's basically, I kind of have a story in my head

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:41.720
 and I kind of, I have to think about what I wanna say.

1:30:41.720 --> 1:30:43.480
 I usually have some images to support what I'm saying

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:44.440
 and I get up and do it.

1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:47.200
 And it's not really, I wish there was some kind of,

1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:48.640
 I probably should have some proper process.

1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:50.640
 This is very sounds like I'm just making up as I go along

1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:52.200
 and I sort of am.

1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:54.240
 Well, I think the fundamental thing that you said,

1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:58.320
 I think it's like, I don't know if you know

1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:01.120
 who a guy named Joe Rogan is.

1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:02.200
 Yes, I do.

1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:05.040
 So he's also kind of sounds like you in a sense

1:31:05.040 --> 1:31:08.560
 that he's not very introspective about his process,

1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:13.040
 but he's an incredibly engaging conversationalist.

1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:15.800
 And I think one of the things that you and him share

1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:19.920
 that I could see is like a genuine curiosity

1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:22.320
 and passion for the topic.

1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:26.840
 I think that could be systematically cultivated.

1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:28.200
 I'm sure there's a process to it,

1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:30.520
 but you come to it naturally somehow.

1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:31.920
 I think maybe there's something else as well,

1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:34.240
 which is to understand something.

1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:35.920
 There's this quote by Feynman, which I really like,

1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:38.240
 which is what I cannot create, I do not understand.

1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:43.200
 So I'm not particularly super bright.

1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:44.680
 So for me to understand something,

1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:47.240
 I have to break it down into its simplest elements.

1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:49.800
 And if I can then tell people about that,

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:51.120
 that helps me understand it as well.

1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:55.480
 So I've learned to understand physics a lot more

1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:57.120
 from the process of communicating,

1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:00.640
 because it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.600
 that you're communicating and it often makes you realize

1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:06.000
 you don't really understand the ideas you're talking about.

1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.120
 And I'm writing a book at the moment,

1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:09.960
 and I had this experience yesterday where I realized

1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:12.600
 I didn't really understand a pretty fundamental

1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:14.480
 theoretical aspect of my own subject.

1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:15.960
 And I had to go and I had to sort of spend

1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:18.840
 a couple of days reading textbooks and thinking about it

1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:21.760
 in order to make sure that the explanation I gave

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:24.800
 captured the, got as close to what is actually happening

1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:26.040
 in the theory.

1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:29.040
 And to do that, you have to really understand it properly.

1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:31.040
 Yeah, and there's layers to understanding.

1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:33.720
 It seems like the more,

1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:35.920
 there must be some kind of Feynman law.

1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:39.680
 I mean, the more you understand sort of the simpler

1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:44.680
 you're able to really convey the essence of the idea, right?

1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:51.080
 So it's like this reverse effect that it's like

1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:54.880
 the more you understand, the simpler the final thing

1:32:54.880 --> 1:32:56.280
 that you actually convey.

1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:58.800
 And so the more accessible somehow it becomes.

1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:01.960
 That's why Feynman's lectures are really accessible.

1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:04.880
 It was just counterintuitive.

1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:06.720
 Yeah, although there are some ideas

1:33:06.720 --> 1:33:09.400
 that are very difficult to explain

1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:12.240
 no matter how well or badly you understand them.

1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:15.280
 Like I still can't really properly explain

1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:16.440
 the Higgs mechanism.

1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:17.400
 Yeah.

1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:19.120
 Because some of these ideas only exist

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.400
 in mathematics really.

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:24.320
 And the only way to really develop an understanding

1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:29.080
 is to go unfortunately to a graduate degree in physics.

1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:31.880
 But you can get kind of a flavor of what's happening,

1:33:31.880 --> 1:33:33.520
 I think, and it's trying to do that in a way

1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:36.840
 that isn't misleading, but always also intelligible.

1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:39.760
 So let me ask them the romantic question of

1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:44.480
 what to you is the most, perhaps an unfair question,

1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:47.560
 what is the most beautiful idea in physics?

1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:52.680
 One that fills you with awe is the most surprising,

1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:54.760
 the strangest, the weirdest.

1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:57.600
 There's a lot of different definitions of beauty.

1:33:57.600 --> 1:33:59.320
 And I'm sure there's several for you,

1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:01.080
 but is there something that just jumps to mind

1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:04.520
 that you think is just especially beautiful?

1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:08.760
 There's a specific thing and a more general thing.

1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.040
 So maybe the specific thing first,

1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.400
 which I can now first came across as an undergraduate.

1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:13.440
 I found this amazing.

1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.120
 So this idea that the forces of nature,

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.960
 electromagnetism, strong force, the weak force,

1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:24.720
 they arise in our theories as a consequence of symmetries.

1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:27.480
 So symmetries in the laws of nature,

1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:29.000
 in the equations essentially

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.040
 that used to describe these ideas,

1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:34.440
 the process whereby theories come up

1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:36.600
 with these sorts of models is they say,

1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:39.920
 imagine the universe obeys this particular type of symmetry.

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:42.240
 It's a symmetry that isn't so far removed

1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.880
 from a geometrical symmetry, like the rotations of a cube.

1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:46.360
 It's not, you can't think of it quite that way,

1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.040
 but it's sort of a similar sort of idea.

1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:51.880
 And you say, okay, if the universe respects the symmetry,

1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:54.720
 you find that you have to introduce a force

1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:57.960
 which has the properties of electromagnetism

1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:00.080
 or a different symmetry, you get the strong force

1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:01.800
 or a different symmetry, you get the weak force.

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.160
 So these interactions seem to come from some deeper,

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:06.280
 it suggests that they come

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:07.960
 from some deeper symmetry principle.

1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:09.680
 I mean, it depends a bit how you look at it

1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:10.720
 because it could be that we're actually

1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:12.800
 just recognizing symmetries in the things that we see,

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.160
 but there's something rather lovely about that.

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:17.080
 But I mean, I suppose a bigger thing that makes me wonder

1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:20.200
 is actually, if you look at the laws of nature,

1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:22.680
 how particles interact when you get really close down,

1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:24.240
 they're basically pretty simple things.

1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:26.360
 They bounce off each other by exchanging

1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:27.840
 through force fields and they move around

1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:29.280
 in very simple ways.

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:31.880
 And somehow these basic ingredients,

1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:34.560
 these few particles that we know about in the forces

1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:37.360
 creates this universe, which is unbelievably complicated

1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:39.520
 and has things like you and me in it,

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:43.400
 and the earth and stars that make matter in their cores

1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:46.160
 from the gravitational energy of their own bulk

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:47.600
 that then gets sprayed into the universe

1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:48.480
 that forms other things.

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:52.880
 I mean, the fact that there's this incredibly long story

1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:55.920
 that goes right back to the beginning,

1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:58.240
 and we can take this story right back to a trillionth

1:35:58.240 --> 1:35:59.440
 of a second after the Big Bang,

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.280
 and we can trace the origins of the stuff

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:02.440
 that we're made from.

1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.040
 And it all ultimately comes from these simple ingredients

1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:06.560
 with these simple rules.

1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:08.720
 And the fact you can generate such complexity from that

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:11.080
 is really mysterious, I think, and strange.

1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:12.920
 And it's not even a question that physicists

1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:15.760
 can really tackle because we are sort of trying

1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:19.080
 to find these really elementary laws.

1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:21.880
 But it turns out that going from elementary laws

1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:24.040
 and a few particles to something even as complicated

1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.600
 as a molecule becomes very difficult.

1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:28.640
 So going from a molecule to a human being

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:31.960
 is a problem that just can't be tackled,

1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:34.040
 at least not at the moment, so.

1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:37.320
 Yeah, the emergence of complexity from simple rules

1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:40.600
 is so beautiful and so mysterious.

1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:43.600
 And we don't have good mathematics

1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:47.320
 to even try to approach that emergent phenomena.

1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:48.800
 That's why we have chemistry and biology

1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:52.040
 and all the other subjects, yeah, okay.

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:55.880
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Harry.

1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:59.040
 I can't, I mean, I think I speak for a lot of people

1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:01.880
 that can't wait to see what happens

1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:03.800
 in the next five, 10, 20 years with you.

1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:06.080
 I think you're one of the great communicators of our time.

1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:09.840
 So I hope you continue that and I hope that grows.

1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:12.280
 And I'm definitely a huge fan.

1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:13.960
 So it was an honor to talk to you today.

1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:14.800
 Thanks so much, man.

1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:16.360
 It was really fun, thanks very much.

1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:19.040

1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:41.880
 support it on Patreon or simply connect with me

1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:44.360
 on Twitter at lexfreedman.

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:48.520
 And now let me leave you with some words from Harry Kliff.

1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:51.160
 You and I are leftovers.

1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:53.760
 Every particle in our bodies is a survivor

1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:57.080
 from an almighty shootout between matter and antimatter

1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:59.360
 that happened a little after the Big Bang.

1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:02.760
 In fact, only one in a billion particles created

1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:06.080
 at the beginning of time have survived to the present day.

1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:18.080
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
