00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, the second time we've

00:04.200 --> 00:08.680
 spoken on this podcast, he's a mathematician with a bold and piercing

00:08.680 --> 00:13.320
 intelligence, unafraid to explore the biggest questions in the universe and

00:13.320 --> 00:16.280
 shine a light on the darkest corners of our society.

00:16.920 --> 00:23.200
 He is the host of the portal podcast, a part of which he recently released his

00:23.200 --> 00:29.720
 2013 Oxford lecture on his theory of geometric unity that is at the center of

00:29.720 --> 00:34.400
 his lifelong efforts to arrive at a theory of everything that unifies the

00:34.400 --> 00:35.840
 fundamental laws of physics.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.720
 This conversation was recorded recently in the time of the coronavirus pandemic

00:41.120 --> 00:44.320
 for everyone feeling the medical, psychological and financial burden of

00:44.320 --> 00:46.560
 this crisis, I'm sending love your way.

00:47.080 --> 00:47.880
 Stay strong.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
 We're in this together.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.000
 We'll beat this thing.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.120
 This is the artificial intelligence podcast.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.800
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars and apple

00:56.800 --> 01:00.520
 podcasts, support it on Patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:00.760 --> 01:04.000
 at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.240
 This show is presented by cash app, the number one finance app in the app store.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.320
 When you get it, use code Lex podcast.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.320
 Cash app lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin and invest in the stock

01:16.320 --> 01:18.280
 market with as little as $1.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.720
 Since cash app does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order

01:22.720 --> 01:27.080
 execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of

01:27.080 --> 01:30.040
 the fractional orders is an algorithmic Marvel.

01:30.480 --> 01:34.440
 So big props to the cash app engineers for solving a hard problem that in the

01:34.440 --> 01:38.720
 end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of

01:38.720 --> 01:43.000
 abstraction of the stock market, making trading more accessible to new

01:43.000 --> 01:46.520
 investors and diversification much easier.

01:47.120 --> 01:51.320
 So again, if you get cash app from the app store, Google play and use code

01:51.320 --> 01:57.080
 Lex podcast, you get $10 and cash app will also donate $10 to first an

01:57.080 --> 02:00.880
 organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for

02:00.880 --> 02:02.160
 young people around the world.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.320
 And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.200
 Do you see a connection between world war II and the crisis

02:12.200 --> 02:13.120
 we're living through right now?

02:13.800 --> 02:14.280
 Sure.

02:14.920 --> 02:20.680
 The need for collective action, reminding ourselves of the fact that all of these

02:20.680 --> 02:25.960
 abstractions, like everyone should just do exactly what he or she wants to do

02:25.960 --> 02:28.080
 for himself and leave everyone else alone.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.840
 None of these abstractions work in a global crisis.

02:31.520 --> 02:35.800
 And this is just a reminder that we didn't somehow put all that behind us.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.640
 When I hear stories about my grandfather who was in the army.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.600
 And so the Soviet union where most people die, when you're in the army,

02:44.080 --> 02:45.960
 there's a brotherhood that happens.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.400
 There's a love that happens.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.720
 Do you think that's something we're going to see here?

02:49.720 --> 02:54.640
 Uh, since we're not there, I mean, what the Soviet union went through, I mean,

02:54.640 --> 03:02.240
 the enormity of the war on, uh, the Russian doorstep, this is different.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.640
 What we're going through now is not, we can't talk about Stalingrad and

03:05.640 --> 03:07.080
 COVID in the same breath yet.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.080
 We're not ready.

03:08.320 --> 03:14.320
 And the, the sort of, uh, you know, just the sense of like the great patriotic

03:14.320 --> 03:19.680
 war and the way in which I was very moved by the Soviet custom of,

03:19.680 --> 03:23.240
 of newlyweds going and visiting war memorials on their wedding day.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.440
 It's like the happiest day of your life.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.000
 You have to say thank you to the people who made it possible.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.240
 We're not there.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.840
 We're, we're just restarting history.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.520
 We, you know, I've called this on the Rogan program.

03:35.520 --> 03:41.840
 I called it the great nap, the 75 years with, um, very little by historical

03:41.840 --> 03:45.800
 standards in, in terms of really profound disruption.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.600
 And so when you call it the great nap, meaning lack of deep global tragedy,

03:51.240 --> 03:54.240
 well, lack of realized global tragedy.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.680
 So I think that the development, for example, of the hydrogen bomb, you know,

03:58.680 --> 04:01.520
 was something that happened during the great nap.

04:02.360 --> 04:08.160
 And that doesn't mean that people who lived during that time didn't feel

04:08.160 --> 04:13.240
 feared and no anxiety, but it was to say that most of the violent potential

04:13.240 --> 04:15.680
 of the human species was not realized.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.040
 It was in the form of potential energy.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.440
 And this is the thing that I've sort of taken issue with, with the description

04:21.440 --> 04:25.960
 of Steven Pinker's optimism is that if you look at the realized kinetic

04:25.960 --> 04:28.880
 variables, things have been getting much better for a long time, which is the

04:28.880 --> 04:34.880
 great nap, but it's not as if, uh, our fragility has not grown our dependence

04:34.880 --> 04:38.440
 on electronic systems, our vulnerability to disruption.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.960
 And so all sorts of things have gotten much better. Other things have gotten

04:42.960 --> 04:46.600
 much worse and the destructive potential is skyrocketed.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.760
 It's tragedy.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.920
 The only way we wake up from the big nap.

04:51.160 --> 04:56.520
 Well, no, you could also have a, you know, jubilation about positive things, but

04:56.520 --> 04:58.680
 it's harder to get people's attention.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.840
 Can you give an example of a big global positive thing that could happen?

05:02.920 --> 05:07.880
 I think that when, for example, just historically speaking, uh, HIV

05:07.880 --> 05:11.360
 went from being a death sentence to something that people could live with

05:11.360 --> 05:13.280
 for a very long period of time.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.840
 It would be great if that had happened on a Wednesday, right?

05:16.840 --> 05:19.480
 Like all at once, like you knew that things had changed.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.640
 And so the bleed in somewhat kills the, the sort of the Wednesday effect

05:24.640 --> 05:28.840
 where it all happens on a particular day at a particular moment.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.320
 I think if you look at the stock market here, you know, there's a very clear

05:32.320 --> 05:37.120
 moment where you can see that the market absorbs the idea of the coronavirus.

05:37.120 --> 05:43.240
 I think that with respect to, um, positives, the moon landing was the best

05:43.240 --> 05:49.240
 example of a positive that happened at a particular time or, uh, recapitulating

05:49.240 --> 05:57.160
 the Soviet American, uh, link up in terms of, um, Skylab and Soyuz, right?

05:57.160 --> 06:02.120
 Like that was a huge moment when you actually had these two nations connecting.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.800
 Uh, in orbit.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.400
 And so, yeah, there are great moments where something beautiful and wonderful

06:07.400 --> 06:11.720
 and amazing happens, you know, but it's just, there are fewer of, that's why,

06:11.720 --> 06:16.560
 that's why as much as I can't imagine proposing to somebody at a sporting event,

06:17.200 --> 06:21.840
 when you have like 30,000 people waiting and you know, like she says, yes,

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
 it's pretty exciting.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.160
 So I think that we shouldn't, we shouldn't discount that.

06:27.840 --> 06:33.240
 So how bad do you think it's going to get in terms of, um,

06:33.240 --> 06:38.440
 of the global suffering that we're going to experience with this, with this crisis?

06:38.480 --> 06:39.760
 I can't figure this one out.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
 I'm just not smart enough.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.160
 Something is going weirdly wrong.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.360
 They're almost like two separate storylines.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.600
 We in one storyline, we aren't taking things nearly seriously enough.

06:52.080 --> 06:59.680
 We see people using food packaging lids as masks who are doctors or nurses.

06:59.680 --> 07:04.680
 Um, we hear horrible stories about people dying needlessly due to triage.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.840
 And that's a very terrifying story.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.960
 On the other hand, there's this other story, which says there are

07:12.960 --> 07:14.960
 tons of ventilators someplace.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.440
 We've got lots of masks, but they haven't been released.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.840
 We've got hospital ships where none of the beds are being used.

07:22.560 --> 07:28.800
 And it's very confusing to me that somehow these two stories give me the feeling

07:28.800 --> 07:33.520
 that they both must be true simultaneously, and they can't both be true in any kind

07:33.520 --> 07:37.800
 of standard way, whether I don't know whether it's just that I'm dumb, but I

07:37.800 --> 07:40.560
 can't get one or the other story to quiet down.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.360
 So I think weirdly, this is much more serious than we had understood it.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.480
 And it's not nearly as serious as some people are making it out to be at the

07:49.480 --> 07:54.440
 same time and that we're not being given the tools to actually understand, Oh,

07:54.440 --> 07:58.760
 here's how to interpret the data, or here's the issue with the personal protective

07:58.760 --> 08:03.440
 equipment is actually a jurisdictional battle or a question of who pays for it

08:03.760 --> 08:06.000
 rather than a question of whether it's present or absent.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.360
 I don't understand the details of it, but something is wildly off in our

08:10.360 --> 08:11.720
 ability to understand where we are.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.560
 So that's, that's policy that's institutions.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.960
 What about, do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of

08:18.960 --> 08:21.160
 people that have lost their job?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
 Is this a temporary thing?

08:23.200 --> 08:28.520
 I mean, what I'm my ears, not to the suffering of those people who have

08:28.520 --> 08:32.800
 lost their job or the 50% possibly a small businesses that are going to go

08:32.800 --> 08:35.120
 bankrupt, do you think about that?

08:36.280 --> 08:36.400
 Sure.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.240
 It's suffering.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.800
 Well, and how that might arise itself could be not quiet too.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.720
 I mean, right.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.040
 That's the, could be a depression.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.960
 This could go from recession to depression and depression could go

08:47.960 --> 08:49.720
 to armed conflict and then to war.

08:49.720 --> 08:56.720
 So it's not a very, um, abstract causal chain that gets us to the point where

08:57.240 --> 09:01.720
 we can begin with quiet suffering and anxiety and all of these sorts of things

09:01.720 --> 09:06.520
 and people losing their jobs and people dying from stress and all sorts of things.

09:06.840 --> 09:15.080
 But, um, look, anything powerful enough to put us all indoors in a, I mean,

09:15.080 --> 09:20.240
 I think about this as an incredible experiment. Imagine that you proposed,

09:20.520 --> 09:22.480
 Hey, I want to do a bunch of research.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.600
 Let's figure out what changes in our emissions, emissions profiles for our

09:27.600 --> 09:32.200
 carbon footprints when we're all indoors or what happens to traffic patterns or

09:32.200 --> 09:37.920
 what happens to the vulnerability of retail sales, uh, as Amazon gets stronger,

09:37.960 --> 09:39.120
 you know, et cetera, et cetera.

09:39.120 --> 09:44.960
 I believe that in many of those situations, um, we're running an incredible

09:44.960 --> 09:47.760
 experiment and I, am I worried for us all?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.440
 Yes, there are some bright spots.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.640
 One of which is that when you're ordered to stay indoors, people are

09:53.640 --> 09:58.440
 going to feel entitled and the usual thing that people are going to hit when

09:58.440 --> 10:04.720
 they hear that they've lost your job, you know, there's this kind of tough,

10:04.720 --> 10:09.560
 um, tough love attitude that you see, particularly in the United States, like,

10:09.800 --> 10:12.120
 Oh, you lost your job, poor baby.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.320
 Well, go retrain, get another one.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.760
 I think there's going to be a lot less appetite for that.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.160
 Um, because we've been asked to sacrifice, to risk, to act collectively.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.240
 And that's the interesting thing.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.120
 What does that reawaken in us?

10:27.160 --> 10:31.640
 Maybe the idea that we actually are nations and that, you know, you're

10:31.640 --> 10:35.520
 fellow countrymen may, may start to mean something to more people.

10:35.520 --> 10:39.560
 It certainly means something to people in the military, but I wonder how many

10:39.800 --> 10:43.240
 people who aren't in the military start to think about this as like, Oh yeah,

10:43.320 --> 10:46.800
 we are kind of running separate experiments and we are not China.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.920
 So you think this is kind of a period that might be studied for years to come.

10:52.560 --> 10:57.840
 From my perspective, we are a part of experiment, but I don't feel like

10:57.840 --> 10:59.680
 we have access to the full range of knowledge.

10:59.680 --> 11:04.280
 But I don't feel like we have access to the full data, the full data of the

11:04.280 --> 11:09.600
 experiment, we're just like little mice in a large, does this one make sense to you?

11:11.480 --> 11:14.720
 I'm, I'm romanticizing it and I keep connecting it to world war II.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.240
 So I keep connecting to historical events and making sense of them through that way

11:19.640 --> 11:26.720
 or reading the plague by Camus, like almost kind of telling narratives and

11:26.720 --> 11:33.320
 stories, but it might, I'm not hearing the suffering that people are going

11:33.320 --> 11:36.480
 through because I think that's quiet there.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.240
 Everybody's numb currently.

11:39.320 --> 11:43.160
 They're not realizing what it means to have lost your job and

11:43.160 --> 11:44.200
 to have lost your business.

11:44.240 --> 11:52.720
 There's kind of a, I don't, I, um, I'm afraid how that fear will materialize

11:52.720 --> 11:54.680
 itself once the numbness wears out.

11:54.680 --> 12:01.160
 And especially if this lasts for many months, then if it's connected to

12:01.160 --> 12:07.600
 the incompetence of the CDC and the WHO and our government and perhaps the

12:07.600 --> 12:13.600
 election process, you know, my biggest fear is that the elections get delayed

12:13.640 --> 12:14.520
 or something like that.

12:15.800 --> 12:23.000
 So the, the, the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or

12:23.000 --> 12:26.960
 damaged in some way that then mixes with the fear that people have that

12:26.960 --> 12:30.800
 turns to panic, that turns to anger, that anger.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.400
 Can I just play with that for a little bit?

12:32.400 --> 12:32.680
 Sure.

12:33.680 --> 12:40.440
 What if in fact, all of that structure that you grew up thinking about, and

12:40.440 --> 12:43.080
 again, you grew up in two places, right?

12:43.120 --> 12:49.360
 So, uh, when you were inside the U S we tend to look at all of these things as

12:49.360 --> 12:53.000
 museum pieces, like how often do we amend the constitution anymore?

12:54.600 --> 12:58.880
 And in some sense, if you think about the Jewish tradition of Simha Torah,

12:59.200 --> 13:04.640
 you've got this beautiful scroll that has been lovingly hand drawn and

13:04.640 --> 13:08.160
 calligraphy, um, that's very valuable.

13:08.600 --> 13:15.560
 And it's very important that you not treat it as a relic to be revered.

13:15.560 --> 13:20.080
 And so we, one day a year, we dance with the Torah and we hold this incredibly

13:20.080 --> 13:25.800
 vulnerable document up and we treat it as if, uh, you know, it was Ginger

13:25.800 --> 13:28.480
 Rogers being, uh, led by Fred Astaire.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.720
 Well, that is how you become part of your country.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.640
 In fact, maybe the, maybe the election will be delayed.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.920
 Maybe extraordinary powers will be used.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.280
 Maybe any one of a number of things will indicate that you're

13:42.280 --> 13:43.720
 actually living through history.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.280
 This isn't a museum piece that you were handed by your great, great grandparents.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.920
 But you're kind of suggesting that there might be a, like a

13:51.920 --> 13:59.560
 community thing that pops up like, like, um, as opposed to, uh, an angry revolution.

13:59.560 --> 14:04.480
 It might have a positive effect of, well, for example, are you telling me

14:04.520 --> 14:11.840
 that if the right person stood up and called for us to sacrifice PPE, uh, for

14:11.840 --> 14:18.720
 our nurses and our, our MDs who are on the front lines, that like people wouldn't

14:19.160 --> 14:23.400
 reach down deep in their own supply that they've been like stocking and carefully

14:23.480 --> 14:25.200
 storing them just say, like, say here, take it.

14:26.200 --> 14:35.440
 Like right now, an actual leader would use this time to bring out the heroic

14:35.440 --> 14:39.400
 character and I'm going to just go wildly patriotic cause I frigging love this

14:39.400 --> 14:45.960
 country, we've got this dormant population in the us that loves leadership

14:45.960 --> 14:51.240
 and country and pride in our freedom and not being told what to do.

14:51.240 --> 14:55.080
 And we still have this thing that binds us together and all of them,

14:55.800 --> 14:59.120
 the merchants of division just be gone.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.160
 I totally agree with you.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.520
 There's a, I think there is a deep hunger for that leadership.

15:04.800 --> 15:09.160
 Why hasn't that, why, why hasn't one of us, we don't have the right search

15:09.160 --> 15:14.360
 surgeon general, we have a guy saying, you know, come on guys, don't buy masks.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.400
 They don't really work for you.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.880
 Save them for our healthcare professionals.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.600
 No, you can't do that.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.040
 You have to say, you know what, these masks actually do work and they more

15:24.040 --> 15:28.440
 work to protect other people from you, but they would work for you.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.680
 They'll keep you somewhat safer if you wear them.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.520
 Here's the deal.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.040
 You've got somebody who's taking huge amounts of viral load all the time

15:35.040 --> 15:36.320
 because the patients are shedding.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.920
 Do you want to protect that person who's volunteered to be on the front

15:38.920 --> 15:40.440
 line, who's up sleepless nights?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.080
 You just changed the message.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.920
 You stop lying to people.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.800
 You just, you level with them.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.760
 It's like, it's bad.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.680
 Absolutely.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.120
 But that's a, that's a little bit specific.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.560
 So you, you have to be just honest about the facts of the situation.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.060
 Yes.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.760
 But I think you were referring to something bigger than just that inspiring,

16:00.480 --> 16:05.520
 like, you know, rewriting the constitution, sort of rethinking how

16:05.520 --> 16:06.480
 we work as a nation.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.420
 Yeah.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.960
 I think you should probably, you know, amend the constitution once

16:09.960 --> 16:15.760
 or twice in a lifetime so that you don't get this distance from the foundational

16:15.760 --> 16:20.520
 documents and, you know, part of the problem is that we've got two generations

16:20.520 --> 16:25.560
 on top that feel very connected to the U S they feel bought in and we've got three

16:25.560 --> 16:31.800
 generations below it's a little bit like watching your parents riding the tricycle

16:31.800 --> 16:34.200
 that they were supposed to pass on to you.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.600
 And it's like, you're now too old to ride a tricycle and they're still

16:37.600 --> 16:41.040
 whooping it up, ringing the bell with the streamers coming off the handlebars.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.200
 And you're just thinking, do you guys never get bored?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.680
 Do you never pass a torch?

16:45.800 --> 16:46.800
 Do you really want it?

16:47.440 --> 16:51.640
 We had five septuagenarians all born in the forties running for president of the

16:51.640 --> 16:53.440
 United States when Clovis sure dropped out.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.040
 The youngest was Warren.

16:55.040 --> 17:01.840
 We had Warren Biden, Sanders, Bloomberg, and Trump from like 1949 to 1941.

17:01.840 --> 17:07.240
 All who had been the oldest president at inauguration and nobody's, nobody says

17:07.240 --> 17:12.040
 grandma and grandpa, you're embarrassing us except Joe Rogan.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.440
 Let me put it on you.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.840
 You have a big platform.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.640
 You're somewhat of an intelligent, eloquent guy.

17:19.240 --> 17:23.440
 What, what role do you somewhat, what role do you play?

17:23.440 --> 17:24.640
 Why aren't you that leader?

17:25.240 --> 17:30.840
 Well, you're, I mean, I would argue that you're in, in ways becoming a leader.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.360
 In ways becoming that leader.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.040
 So I haven't taken enough risk.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.600
 Is that your idea?

17:35.920 --> 17:38.160
 What should I do or say at the moment?

17:38.160 --> 17:41.720
 No, you're a little bit, no, you have taken quite a big risks

17:41.800 --> 17:43.160
 and we'll, we'll talk about it.

17:43.400 --> 17:43.760
 All right.

17:43.760 --> 17:55.360
 But you're also on the outside shooting in, meaning, um, you're, uh, dismantling

17:55.400 --> 18:00.360
 the institution from the outside as opposed to becoming the institution.

18:00.360 --> 18:04.920
 Do you remember that thing you brought up when you were on the view, the view?

18:05.160 --> 18:05.520
 I'm sorry.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.360
 When you were on Oprah, I didn't make, I didn't get the invite.

18:09.360 --> 18:09.800
 Sorry.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.600
 When you were on Bill Maher's program, what was that thing you were saying?

18:16.800 --> 18:17.840
 They don't know we're here.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.680
 They may watch us.

18:20.160 --> 18:20.520
 Yeah.

18:21.200 --> 18:27.480
 They may quietly slip us a direct message, but they pretend that this

18:27.480 --> 18:32.520
 internet thing is, uh, some dangerous place where only lunatics play.

18:32.840 --> 18:37.880
 Well, who has the bigger platform, the portal or Bill Maher's program or the

18:37.880 --> 18:43.120
 view, Bill Maher and the view in terms of viewership or in terms of what's

18:43.120 --> 18:44.160
 the metric of size?

18:44.160 --> 18:50.160
 Well, first of all, the key thing is, um, take, take a newspaper and even

18:50.160 --> 18:51.920
 imagine that it's completely fake.

18:52.440 --> 18:52.760
 Okay.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.600
 And then there's very little in the way of circulation.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.920
 Yet imagine that it's an a hundred year old paper and that it's still part of

18:59.920 --> 19:01.960
 this game, this internal game of media.

19:03.520 --> 19:10.120
 The key point is, is that those sources that have that kind of, um, mark of

19:10.120 --> 19:16.680
 respectability to the institutional structures matter in a way that even if

19:16.680 --> 19:20.600
 I say something on a very large platform that makes a lot of sense, if it's

19:20.600 --> 19:24.600
 outside of what I've called the gated institutional narrative or gin, I'm

19:24.600 --> 19:29.160
 sorry, institutional narrative or gin, it sort of doesn't matter to the

19:29.160 --> 19:34.680
 institutions. So the game is if it happens outside of the club, we can

19:34.680 --> 19:36.000
 pretend that it never happened.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.760
 How can you get the credibility and the authority from outside the, the

19:41.760 --> 19:43.520
 gated institutional narrative?

19:43.920 --> 19:52.560
 Well, first of all, you and I both share, um, institutional credibility coming

19:52.560 --> 19:57.600
 from organizations. So you, we were both at MIT, were you at Harvard at any

19:57.600 --> 19:59.360
 point? Nope. Okay.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.680
 Well, I lived in Harvard square.

20:02.160 --> 20:07.600
 So did I, but you know, at some level, the issue isn't whether you have

20:07.600 --> 20:09.080
 credentials in that sense.

20:09.880 --> 20:14.200
 The key question is, can you be trusted to file a flight plan and not deviate

20:14.400 --> 20:19.400
 from that flight plan when you are in an interview situation, will you stick to

20:19.400 --> 20:20.280
 the talking points?

20:20.280 --> 20:25.640
 Not, and that's why you're not going to be allowed in the general

20:25.640 --> 20:30.320
 conversation, which amplifies these sentiments, but I'm still trying to, um,

20:30.520 --> 20:33.000
 so your, your point, it would be, is that we're, let's say both.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.560
 So you've done how many Joe Rogan for I've done for two, right?

20:37.720 --> 20:40.880
 So both of us are somewhat frequent guests. The show is huge.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.800
 You know, the power as well as I do, and people are going to watch this

20:44.800 --> 20:48.880
 conversation. A huge number watched our last one, by the way, I want to thank

20:48.880 --> 20:51.560
 you for that one. That was a terrific, terrific conversation.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.680
 Really did change my life. Like you're brilliant interviewer. So thank you.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.360
 Thank you. That was that you changed my life too.

21:00.520 --> 21:04.080
 That you gave me a chance. So I was so glad I did that one.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.720
 What I would say is, is that we keep mistaking how big the audience is for

21:08.720 --> 21:11.800
 whether or not you have the kiss and the kiss is a different thing.

21:12.120 --> 21:16.120
 Yes. Yeah. Well, it doesn't, it's not an acronym yet. Okay. Um,

21:16.120 --> 21:20.480
 it's uh, but thank you for asking. It's a question of,

21:20.960 --> 21:25.480
 are you part of the inter interoperable institution friendly discussion?

21:25.960 --> 21:29.160
 And that's the discussion which we ultimately have to break into.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.560
 But that's what I'm trying to get at is how do we, how do you,

21:32.600 --> 21:35.440
 how does Eric Weinstein become the president of the United States?

21:36.360 --> 21:39.120
 I shouldn't become the president of the United States. Not interested.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.560
 Thank you very much for asking. Okay.

21:40.640 --> 21:45.280
 Get into a leadership position where I guess I don't know what that means,

21:45.280 --> 21:50.040
 but where you can inspire millions of people to, uh,

21:50.200 --> 21:53.680
 the inspire the sense of community, inspire the,

21:54.960 --> 21:57.720
 the kind of actions required to overcome hardship,

21:57.760 --> 22:01.880
 the kind of hardship that we may be experiencing to inspire people,

22:01.880 --> 22:05.280
 to work hard and face the difficult,

22:05.280 --> 22:09.080
 hard facts of the realities we're living through all those kinds of things that

22:09.080 --> 22:13.080
 you're talking about. That leader, you know,

22:13.080 --> 22:17.680
 can that leader emerge from the current institutions or

22:18.480 --> 22:21.400
 alternatively, can it also emerge from the outside?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.880
 I guess that's what I was asking.

22:22.920 --> 22:23.840
 So my belief is,

22:23.840 --> 22:28.840
 is that this is the last hurrah for the elderly centrist kleptocrats.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.560
 Can you define each of those terms? Okay. Elderly.

22:36.200 --> 22:40.240
 I mean people who were born at least a year before I was,

22:40.240 --> 22:43.800
 that's a joke. You can laugh. Uh, no,

22:43.800 --> 22:48.400
 because I'm born at the cusp of the gen X boomer divide. Um,

22:49.160 --> 22:51.320
 centrist they're pretending, you know,

22:51.560 --> 22:54.880
 there are two parties, Democrat and Republican party in the United States.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.240
 I think it's easier to think of the mainstream of both of them as part of a,

22:58.560 --> 23:01.400
 an aggregate party that I sometimes call the looting party,

23:01.760 --> 23:05.200
 which gets us to kleptocracy, which is ruled by thieves.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.600
 And the great temptation has been to treat the U S like a trough.

23:09.600 --> 23:12.280
 And you just have to get yours because it's not like we're doing anything

23:12.280 --> 23:13.120
 productive.

23:13.320 --> 23:17.480
 So everybody's sort of looting the family mansion and somebody stole the silver

23:17.480 --> 23:20.800
 and somebody is cutting the pictures out of the frames and you know,

23:20.840 --> 23:24.160
 roughly speaking, we're watching our elders, uh,

23:25.120 --> 23:28.000
 we'll live it up in a way that doesn't make sense to the rest of us.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.040
 Okay. So if it's the last hurrah,

23:32.320 --> 23:34.120
 this is the time for leaders to step up.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.920
 We're not ready yet. We're not ready.

23:36.920 --> 23:40.200
 I just disagree with that. I call, I call out, you know,

23:40.600 --> 23:44.320
 the head of the CDC should resign, should resign.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.160
 The surgeon general should resign. Trump should resign. Pelosi should resign.

23:49.920 --> 23:54.360
 De Blasio should resign. I understand that. So that's why. So we'll wait.

23:55.240 --> 23:59.680
 No, but that's not how revolutions work. You don't wait for people to resign.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.880
 You, uh, step up and inspire the alternative.

24:03.880 --> 24:08.600
 Do you remember the Russian revolution of 1907? It's before my time,

24:09.800 --> 24:12.000
 but there wasn't a Russian revolution of 1907.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.760
 So you're thinking we're in 1907. I'm saying we're too early.

24:16.040 --> 24:20.480
 But we got this, you know, Spanish flu came in 17, 18.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.080
 So I would argue that there's a lot of parallels there or there were one.

24:25.360 --> 24:29.040
 I think it's not time yet. Like John Prine, the, uh,

24:29.040 --> 24:34.040
 uh, the songwriter just died of COVID. That was a pretty big,

24:34.240 --> 24:38.040
 really? Yeah. By the way, you, yes, of course. I, um,

24:40.080 --> 24:41.520
 every time we do this, uh,

24:41.560 --> 24:46.320
 we discover our mutual appreciation of obscure brilliant witty

24:46.800 --> 24:50.480
 songwriter. He's really, he's really quite good, right? He's, he's really good.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.080
 Yeah. He died.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.720
 My understanding is that he passed recently due to complications of Corona.

24:56.720 --> 25:01.280
 Yeah. So we haven't had large enough,

25:01.320 --> 25:04.360
 enough large, large enough shocking deaths yet,

25:05.400 --> 25:09.080
 picturesque deaths, deaths of a family that couldn't get treatment.

25:10.160 --> 25:14.840
 There are stories that will come and break our hearts and we have not had enough

25:14.840 --> 25:18.320
 of those. The visuals haven't come in, but I think they're coming. Well,

25:18.360 --> 25:19.200
 we'll find out.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.560
 But that you gotta, you have to be there. He has to be there when they come.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.000
 I mean,

25:23.000 --> 25:27.680
 but we didn't get the visual for example of falling man from nine 11.

25:27.840 --> 25:31.080
 Right. So the outside world did, but Americans were not,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.720
 it was thought that we would be too delicate.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.960
 So just the way you remember Pulitzer prize winning photographs from the Vietnam

25:37.960 --> 25:38.640
 era,

25:38.640 --> 25:43.640
 you don't easily remember the photographs from all sorts of things that have

25:43.720 --> 25:46.200
 happened since because something changed in our media.

25:46.200 --> 25:51.200
 We are in sense that we cannot feel or experience our own lives and the tragedy

25:51.200 --> 25:52.920
 that would animate us to action.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.000
 Yeah. But I think there, again,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.880
 I think there's going to be that suffering that's going to build and build and

25:59.880 --> 26:02.600
 build in terms of businesses,

26:02.600 --> 26:05.680
 mom and pop shops that close. And I, like,

26:05.680 --> 26:08.360
 I think for myself, I think often that,

26:09.960 --> 26:13.440
 that I'm being weak and,

26:13.440 --> 26:16.800
 and like I feel like I should be doing something.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.760
 I should be becoming a leader on a small scale.

26:19.760 --> 26:24.760
 You can't, this is not world war II, and this is not Soviet Russia.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.080
 Why not? Why not?

26:27.080 --> 26:29.880
 Because our internal programming,

26:29.880 --> 26:34.880
 the malware that sits between our ears is much different than the propaganda is

26:36.560 --> 26:40.720
 malware of the Soviet era. I mean,

26:40.720 --> 26:45.720
 people were both very indoctrinated and also knew that some level it was BS.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.440
 They had a double mind. I don't know.

26:48.440 --> 26:53.440
 There must be a great word in Russian for being able to think both of those

26:53.440 --> 26:54.280
 things simultaneously.

26:54.280 --> 26:59.280
 You don't think people are actually sick of the partisanship,

27:00.280 --> 27:01.680
 sick of incompetence.

27:01.680 --> 27:05.160
 Yeah, but I called for revolt the other day on Joe Rogan.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.480
 People found it quixotic.

27:06.480 --> 27:11.160
 Well, because I think you're not, I think revolt is different.

27:11.160 --> 27:16.160
 I think that's like, okay, I'm really angry. I'm, I'm furious.

27:16.680 --> 27:21.080
 I cannot stand that this is my country at the moment. I'm embarrassed.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.880
 So let's build a better one. Yeah. Right. That's the, I'm in.

27:25.880 --> 27:30.320
 Okay. So, well, okay, so let's take over a few universities.

27:30.320 --> 27:34.120
 Let's start running a different experiment at some of our better universities.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.720
 Like when I did this experiment and I said, what,

27:36.720 --> 27:41.240
 at this, if this were 40 years ago, the median age,

27:41.240 --> 27:46.240
 I believe of a university president was 51 that would have the person in gen X

27:46.840 --> 27:49.920
 and we'd have a bunch of millennial presidents, a bunch of, you know,

27:50.280 --> 27:55.280
 more than half gen X it's almost 100% baby boom at this point.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.280
 Um, and how did that happen?

27:58.520 --> 28:00.720
 We can get into how they changed retirement,

28:00.880 --> 28:04.880
 but this generation of people are not going to be able to do that.

28:04.880 --> 28:09.880
 But this generation above us does not feel for even even the older generous

28:12.920 --> 28:16.320
 silent generous. I had Roger Penrose on my program.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.520
 Excellent. And I thank you. I really appreciate that.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.840
 And I asked him a question that was very important to me. I said, look,

28:22.840 --> 28:23.960
 you're in your late eighties.

28:24.880 --> 28:28.600
 Is there anyone you could point to as a successor that we should be watching?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.440
 We can get excited. You know, I said,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.440
 here's an opportunity to pass the baton and he said, well, let me,

28:33.440 --> 28:35.840
 let me hold off on that. It was like, Oh,

28:36.360 --> 28:40.480
 is it ever the right moment to point to somebody younger than you to keep your

28:40.480 --> 28:43.760
 flame alive after you're gone? And also like, I don't know whether,

28:44.080 --> 28:45.280
 I'm just going to admit to this.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.960
 People treat me like I'm crazy for caring about the world after I'm dead

28:51.160 --> 28:53.600
 or wanting to be remembered after you're gone. Like, well,

28:53.600 --> 28:54.960
 what does it matter to you? You're gone.

28:55.040 --> 29:00.040
 It's this deeply sort of secular somatic perspective on everything where we

29:00.040 --> 29:04.120
 don't, you know, that phrase in a, as time goes by,

29:04.520 --> 29:09.560
 it says it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory,

29:10.040 --> 29:11.960
 a case of do or die.

29:13.040 --> 29:18.040
 I don't think people imagined then that there wouldn't be a story about

29:18.760 --> 29:20.160
 fighting for love and glory.

29:20.160 --> 29:25.080
 And like we are so out of practice about fighting, you know,

29:25.080 --> 29:30.080
 rivals for love and and and and fighting for glory and something bigger than

29:31.080 --> 29:31.920
 yourself.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.440
 But the hunger is there.

29:35.920 --> 29:39.040
 Well, that was the point then, right? The whole idea is that Rick was,

29:39.520 --> 29:42.280
 you know, it was like Han Solo of his time. He's just like,

29:42.760 --> 29:45.880
 I stick my neck out for nobody. You know, it's like, Oh, come on, Rick,

29:46.240 --> 29:49.040
 you're just pretending you actually have a big soul. Right.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.120
 And so at some level, that's the question. Do we have a big soul or is it just

29:53.120 --> 29:53.960
 all bullshit?

29:53.960 --> 29:58.960
 So yeah, I think, I think there's huge Manhattan project style projects,

29:59.320 --> 30:03.360
 whether you talk about physical infrastructure or going to Mars, you know,

30:03.360 --> 30:08.200
 the SpaceX NASA efforts or huge,

30:08.880 --> 30:10.040
 huge scientific efforts.

30:10.040 --> 30:10.200
 Well,

30:10.200 --> 30:13.360
 we need to get back into the institutions and we need to remove the weak

30:13.360 --> 30:17.040
 leadership that we have weak leaders and the weak leaders need to be removed and

30:17.040 --> 30:21.000
 they need to seat people more dangerous than the people who are currently sitting

30:21.000 --> 30:21.960
 in a lot of those chairs.

30:21.960 --> 30:26.240
 Yeah. Or build new institutions. Good luck. Well,

30:27.080 --> 30:29.960
 so one of the nice things of, uh,

30:30.440 --> 30:32.240
 from the internet is for example,

30:32.240 --> 30:37.240
 somebody like you can have a bigger voice than almost anybody at the particular

30:38.440 --> 30:39.800
 institutions we're talking about.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.760
 That's true. But the thing is I might say something.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.920
 You can count on the fact that the, you know,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.200
 provost at Princeton isn't going to say anything.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.320
 Yeah. What do you mean to, to afraid?

30:51.440 --> 30:54.000
 Well, if that person were to give an interview,

30:55.120 --> 30:58.520
 how are things going in research at Princeton? Well,

30:58.840 --> 30:59.920
 I'm hesitant to say it,

30:59.920 --> 31:03.120
 but they're perhaps as good as they've ever been and I think they're going to

31:03.120 --> 31:07.920
 get better. Oh, is that right? All fields? Yep. I don't see a weak one.

31:08.440 --> 31:12.920
 It's just like, okay, great. Who are you and what are you even saying?

31:14.600 --> 31:17.000
 We're just used to total nonsense. 24 seven.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.840
 Yeah.

31:18.360 --> 31:22.920
 What do you think might be a beautiful thing that comes out of this?

31:23.360 --> 31:27.280
 Like what is there a hope that like a little inkling,

31:27.440 --> 31:30.160
 a little fire of hope you have about our time right now?

31:31.320 --> 31:31.720
 Yeah.

31:31.720 --> 31:36.080
 I think one thing is coming to understand that the freaks, weirdos,

31:36.080 --> 31:39.520
 mutants, and other, uh,

31:39.560 --> 31:43.240
 near do wells, uh, sometimes referred to as grifters. I like that one.

31:43.240 --> 31:48.240
 Grifters, uh, and gadflies were very often the earliest people on the coronavirus.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.600
 That's a really interesting question. Why was that?

31:54.120 --> 31:59.120
 And it seems to be that they had already paid such a social price that they

32:00.800 --> 32:05.440
 weren't going to be beaten up by being, um,

32:05.760 --> 32:09.960
 told that, Oh my God, you're xenophobic. You just hate China, you know,

32:09.960 --> 32:13.720
 or wow, you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Um,

32:14.360 --> 32:17.240
 so if you'd already paid those prices, you were free to think about this.

32:17.240 --> 32:21.720
 And everyone in an institutional framework was terrified that they didn't want

32:21.720 --> 32:26.080
 to be seen as the alarmist, the, um,

32:26.200 --> 32:30.560
 chicken little. And so that's why you have this confidence where, you know,

32:30.880 --> 32:34.320
 the Blasio says, you know, get on with your lives,

32:34.320 --> 32:37.920
 get back in there and celebrate Chinese new year in Chinatown.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.040
 Uh, despite coronavirus, it's like, okay, really?

32:41.040 --> 32:44.960
 So you just always thought everything would automatically be okay if you,

32:44.960 --> 32:48.400
 if you adapted, sorry, if you adopted that posture.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.120
 So you think, uh,

32:50.160 --> 32:55.160
 this time reveals the weakness of our institutions and reveals the strength of

32:55.180 --> 32:58.000
 our gadflies and the weirdos and the.

32:58.080 --> 33:02.240
 No, not necessarily the strength, but the, the, the value of freedom,

33:02.280 --> 33:04.920
 like a different way of saying it would be, wow,

33:04.920 --> 33:09.120
 even your gadflies and your grifters were able to beat your institutional folks

33:09.120 --> 33:13.080
 because your institutional folks were playing with a giant mental handicap.

33:13.800 --> 33:18.800
 So just imagine like we were in the story of Harrison Bergeron by Vonnegut and

33:18.800 --> 33:23.440
 our smartest people were all subjected to, uh,

33:23.480 --> 33:26.640
 distracting noises every seven seconds. Well,

33:27.520 --> 33:31.800
 they would be functionally much dumber because they couldn't continue a thought

33:31.800 --> 33:33.080
 through all the disturbance.

33:33.080 --> 33:37.200
 So in some sense, that's a little bit like what belonging to an institution is,

33:37.200 --> 33:39.080
 is that if you have to make a public statement,

33:39.080 --> 33:42.800
 of course the surgeon general is going to be the worst because they're,

33:42.800 --> 33:44.400
 they're just playing with too much of a handicap.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.320
 There are too many institutional players are like, don't screw us up.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.000
 And so the person has to say something wrong.

33:50.040 --> 33:54.440
 We're going to back propagate a falsehood. And this is very interesting.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.640
 Some of my socially oriented friends say, Eric,

33:57.680 --> 34:00.000
 I don't understand what you're on about. Of course masks work,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.320
 but you know what they're trying to do.

34:01.320 --> 34:05.520
 They're trying to get us not to buy up the masks for the doctors. And I think,

34:05.520 --> 34:05.840
 okay,

34:05.840 --> 34:10.840
 so you imagine that we can just create scientific fiction at will so that you can

34:10.840 --> 34:13.960
 run whatever social program you want. This is what I, you know,

34:13.960 --> 34:16.240
 my point is get out of my lab, get out of the lab.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.840
 You don't belong in the lab. You're not meant for the lab.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.880
 You're constitutionally incapable of being around the lab.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.320
 You need to leave the lab.

34:23.760 --> 34:28.760
 You think the CDC and WHO knew that masks work and we're trying to,

34:28.760 --> 34:33.760
 and we're trying to sort of imagine that people are kind of stupid and they would

34:34.800 --> 34:39.440
 buy masks in excess if they were told that masks work.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.160
 Is that like, uh,

34:42.400 --> 34:47.400
 cause this does seem to be a particularly clear example of mistakes made.

34:48.880 --> 34:53.440
 You're asking me this question. No, you're not. What do you think, Lex?

34:53.440 --> 34:58.120
 Well, I actually probably disagree with you a little bit. Great. Let's do it.

34:58.120 --> 35:03.120
 I think it's not so easy to be honest with the populace when the danger of

35:04.800 --> 35:07.200
 panic is always around the corner.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
 So I think the kind of honesty you exhibit appeals to a certain class of brave

35:18.640 --> 35:22.960
 intellectual minds that, uh, it appeals to me,

35:22.960 --> 35:26.760
 but I don't know from the perspective of WHO,

35:26.800 --> 35:30.800
 I don't know if it's so obvious that they should,

35:32.240 --> 35:36.680
 um, be honest 100% of the time with people.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.000
 I'm not saying you should be perfectly transparent and 100% honest.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.920
 I'm saying that the quality of your lies has to be very high and it has to be

35:44.920 --> 35:48.960
 public spirited. There's a big difference between, so I'm not,

35:49.040 --> 35:52.400
 I'm not a child about this. I'm not saying that when you're at war,

35:52.400 --> 35:53.000
 for example,

35:53.000 --> 35:57.200
 you turn over all of your plans to the enemy because it's important that you're

35:57.200 --> 36:00.840
 transparent with 360 degree visibility. Far from it.

36:01.120 --> 36:06.120
 What I'm saying is something has been forgotten and I forgot who it was who

36:06.120 --> 36:06.880
 told it to me,

36:06.880 --> 36:11.880
 but it was a fellow graduate student in the Harvard math department and he said,

36:12.960 --> 36:13.240
 you know,

36:13.240 --> 36:16.400
 I learned one thing being out in the workforce because he was one of the few

36:16.400 --> 36:20.840
 people who had had a work life in the department as a grad student.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.800
 And he said, you can be friends with your boss,

36:24.400 --> 36:26.040
 but if you're going to be friends with your boss,

36:26.080 --> 36:27.800
 you have to be doing a good job at work.

36:29.760 --> 36:32.280
 And there's an analog here,

36:32.320 --> 36:36.120
 which is if you're going to be reasonably honest with the population,

36:36.760 --> 36:40.160
 you have to be doing a good job at work as the surgeon general or as the head of

36:40.160 --> 36:43.400
 the CDC. So if you're doing a terrible job,

36:44.760 --> 36:45.920
 you're supposed to resign.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.240
 And then the next person is supposed to say, look,

36:50.320 --> 36:53.320
 I'm not going to lie to you. I inherited the situation.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.600
 It was in a bit of disarray.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.160
 But I had several requirements before I agreed to step in and take the job

36:59.160 --> 37:00.800
 because I needed to know I could turn it around.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.800
 I needed to know that I had clear lines of authority.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.240
 I needed to know that I had the resources available in order to rectify the

37:06.240 --> 37:06.840
 problem.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.520
 And I needed to know that I had the ability and the freedom to level with the

37:09.520 --> 37:12.840
 American people directly as I saw fit. All of my wishes were granted.

37:12.840 --> 37:17.280
 And that's why I'm happy here on Monday morning. I've got my sleeves rolled up.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.560
 Boy, do we got a lot to do.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.320
 So please come back in two weeks and then ask me how I'm doing then.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.000
 And I hope to have something to show you. That's how you do it.

37:24.680 --> 37:29.360
 So why is that excellence and basic competence

37:29.400 --> 37:30.240
 missing?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.360
 The big net. You see,

37:32.680 --> 37:36.880
 you come from multiple traditions where it was very important to remember

37:36.880 --> 37:37.720
 things.

37:38.040 --> 37:42.440
 The Soviet tradition made sure that you remembered the sacrifices that came in

37:42.440 --> 37:47.280
 that war and the Jewish tradition we're doing this on Passover,

37:47.280 --> 37:52.280
 right? Okay. Well, every year we tell one simple story.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.080
 Well, why can't it be different every year?

37:54.080 --> 37:58.320
 Maybe we could have a rotating series of seven stories because it's the one

37:58.320 --> 38:02.640
 story that you need. It's like, you know, you work with the men in black group,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.520
 right? And it's the last suit that you'll ever need.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.480
 This is the last story that you ever need.

38:06.520 --> 38:10.440
 Don't think I fell for your neuralyzer last time.

38:10.440 --> 38:14.960
 In any event, we tell one story because it's the,

38:14.960 --> 38:16.080
 get out of Dodge story.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.720
 There's a time when you need to not wait for the bread to rise.

38:19.760 --> 38:24.120
 And that's the thing, which is even if you live through a great nap,

38:24.880 --> 38:29.600
 you deserve to know what it feels like to have to leave everything that has

38:29.600 --> 38:32.080
 become comfortable and, and unworkable.

38:33.760 --> 38:37.800
 It's sad that you need, you need that tragedy.

38:37.800 --> 38:41.520
 I imagine to have the tradition of remembering

38:42.840 --> 38:47.280
 it's, it's sad to to think that because things have been

38:47.640 --> 38:52.360
 nice and comfortable means that we can't have great competent leaders,

38:54.120 --> 38:55.600
 which is kind of the implied statement.

38:55.600 --> 39:00.400
 Like, can we have great leaders who take big risks,

39:00.400 --> 39:03.560
 who are, who inspire hard work,

39:03.560 --> 39:07.360
 who deal with difficult truth, even though things have been comfortable?

39:08.480 --> 39:12.320
 Well, we know what those people sound like. I mean, you know, if,

39:12.320 --> 39:15.960
 for example, Jaco Willink suddenly threw his hat into the ring,

39:17.720 --> 39:21.800
 everyone would say, okay, right.

39:21.800 --> 39:26.040
 Party's over. It's time to get up at four 30 and really work hard.

39:26.040 --> 39:30.640
 And we've got to get back into fighting shape. And yeah,

39:30.640 --> 39:34.640
 but Jaco is a very special, I think,

39:34.640 --> 39:39.640
 that whole group of people by profession,

39:39.800 --> 39:43.560
 put themselves in the way of, and into hardship on a daily basis.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.080
 And he's not, I don't, well, I don't know,

39:47.120 --> 39:52.120
 but he's probably not going to be, well, could Jaco be president?

39:52.680 --> 39:55.120
 Okay. But it doesn't have to be Jaco, right? Like in other words,

39:55.120 --> 39:59.840
 if it was Kai Lenny or if it was Alex

39:59.840 --> 40:03.840
 Honnold from rock climbing, right. But they're just serious people.

40:04.480 --> 40:09.480
 They're serious people who can't afford your BS.

40:10.440 --> 40:10.600
 Yeah.

40:10.600 --> 40:15.600
 But why do we have serious people that do rock climbing and uh,

40:16.440 --> 40:20.760
 don't have serious people who lead the nation? That seems to.

40:20.760 --> 40:21.680
 Because that was a,

40:22.360 --> 40:27.360
 those skills needed in rock climbing are not good during the big nap.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.480
 And at the tail end of the big nap, they would get you fired.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.560
 But I don't,

40:30.560 --> 40:35.040
 don't you think there's a fundamental part of human nature that desires to,

40:35.040 --> 40:37.920
 to excel, to be exceptionally good at your job?

40:38.400 --> 40:42.000
 Yeah. But what is your job? I mean, in other words, my, my,

40:42.040 --> 40:44.040
 my point to you is if you,

40:44.040 --> 40:48.040
 if you're a general in a peacetime army and your major activity is playing war

40:48.040 --> 40:48.880
 games,

40:50.200 --> 40:54.200
 what if the skills needed to win war games are very different than the skills

40:54.200 --> 40:57.560
 needed to win wars? Because you know how the war games are scored and you've,

40:57.800 --> 41:00.840
 you've done money ball, for example, with war games,

41:01.320 --> 41:03.200
 you figured out how to win games on paper.

41:03.720 --> 41:08.720
 So then the advancement skill becomes divergent from the, uh,

41:08.760 --> 41:11.520
 ultimate skill that it was proxying for.

41:12.320 --> 41:16.760
 Yeah. But you create this, we're good as human beings to, I mean,

41:16.760 --> 41:19.520
 I, at least me, I can't do a big nap.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.600
 So at any one moment when I finish something,

41:22.600 --> 41:25.320
 a new dream pops up. So going to Mars,

41:25.800 --> 41:28.480
 what do you like to do? You like to do Brazilian jujitsu?

41:28.960 --> 41:31.600
 Well, first of all, I like to do every, you like to play guitar,

41:31.680 --> 41:35.200
 guitar, you do this podcast, you do theory. You're always,

41:35.320 --> 41:39.840
 you're constantly taking risks and exposing yourself. Right? Why?

41:40.400 --> 41:43.360
 Because you've got one of those crazy, I'm sorry to say it.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.960
 You've got an Eastern European Jewish personality, which I'm still tied to,

41:47.240 --> 41:51.040
 and I'm a couple of generations more distant than you are.

41:51.040 --> 41:54.280
 And I've held on to that thing because it's valuable to me.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.600
 You don't think there's a huge percent of the populace,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.720
 even in the United States. That's that's that might be a little bit dormant,

42:01.760 --> 42:05.680
 but do you know Anna Hatchian from the red scare podcast?

42:06.080 --> 42:09.480
 Did you interview her? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I listened. Yeah, yeah, she was great.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.520
 She was great, right? Yeah. She's fun. She's, she's terrific.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.280
 But she also has the same thing going on.

42:14.280 --> 42:17.360
 And I made a joke in the liner notes for that episode,

42:17.360 --> 42:22.360
 which is somewhere on the road from Stalingrad to forever 21,

42:22.360 --> 42:26.120
 something was lost. Like how can Stalingrad and forever 21 be in the same

42:26.120 --> 42:30.480
 sentence? And, you know, in part it's that weird thing.

42:30.480 --> 42:35.000
 It's like trying to remember even words like I'm in Russian and Hebrew things,

42:35.000 --> 42:38.200
 like it's like what pom yet then the score, you know,

42:38.200 --> 42:43.200
 these words have much more potency about memory and I don't know.

42:43.200 --> 42:48.200
 I do, I think, I think there's still a dormant populace that craves leaders on a

42:53.080 --> 42:54.560
 small scale and large scale.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.640
 And I hope to be that leader on a small scale.

42:58.840 --> 43:03.280
 And I think you sir have a role to be a leader.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.680
 You kids go ahead without me. I'm just gonna,

43:07.160 --> 43:08.760
 I'm going to do a little bit of weird podcast.

43:08.760 --> 43:13.080
 I see now you're, you're putting on your, uh, Joe Rogan hat.

43:14.040 --> 43:17.000
 Uh, he says, I'm just a comedian. Oh no, I'm not saying I'm just a,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.760
 it's not that if I say I want to lead too much because of the big nap,

43:21.800 --> 43:26.160
 there's like a group, a chorus of automated idiots and their first thought is

43:26.160 --> 43:30.560
 like, ah, I knew it. So it's a power grab all along. Why should you lead?

43:30.560 --> 43:31.400
 You know, it's just like,

43:31.760 --> 43:34.400
 and so the idea is you're just trying to skirt around,

43:34.400 --> 43:38.280
 not stepping on all of the idiot landmines. It's like, okay,

43:38.280 --> 43:40.720
 so now I'm going to hear that in my inbox for the next three days.

43:41.120 --> 43:45.200
 Okay. So lead by example, just live. No, I mean, the issue platform, look,

43:45.240 --> 43:47.920
 we should take over the institutions. There are institutions.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.080
 We've got bad leadership.

43:49.120 --> 43:53.080
 We should mutiny and we should inject a, I don't know,

43:53.120 --> 43:57.360
 15% 20% uh, disagreeable, dissident,

43:57.360 --> 44:00.520
 very aggressive loner, individual mutant freaks,

44:00.760 --> 44:04.280
 all the people that you go to see Avengers movies about or the X men or whatever

44:04.280 --> 44:09.280
 it is and stop pretending that everything good comes out of some great giant

44:09.320 --> 44:13.720
 inclusive, communal, uh, 12 hour meeting.

44:14.720 --> 44:17.960
 It's like, stop it. That's not how shit happens.

44:19.560 --> 44:24.560
 You recently published the video of a lecture you gave at Oxford presenting

44:24.880 --> 44:26.680
 some aspects of a theory, uh,

44:27.600 --> 44:29.840
 theory of everything called geometric unity.

44:29.840 --> 44:33.960
 So this was a work of 30, 30 plus years.

44:34.440 --> 44:35.600
 This is life's work.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.680
 Let me ask her the, the silly old question.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.840
 How do you feel as a human? Excited, scared,

44:44.160 --> 44:46.160
 the experience of posting it.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.320
 You know, it's funny. One of the, one of the things that you,

44:49.360 --> 44:53.760
 you learn to feel as an academic is, um,

44:53.800 --> 44:57.720
 the great sins you can commit in academics, uh,

44:57.720 --> 45:01.720
 is to show yourself to be a non serious person to show yourself to have

45:01.720 --> 45:02.560
 delusions,

45:03.800 --> 45:07.880
 to avoid the standard practices,

45:07.920 --> 45:10.320
 which everyone has signed up for.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.560
 And you know,

45:14.560 --> 45:18.480
 it's weird because like, you know that those people are going to be angry.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.320
 He did what, you know, why would he do that? And,

45:23.600 --> 45:25.640
 and what we're referring to, for example,

45:25.640 --> 45:28.440
 there's traditions of sort of publishing incrementally,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.560
 certainly not trying to have a theory of everything,

45:32.520 --> 45:37.200
 perhaps working within the academic departments, all those things.

45:37.200 --> 45:41.000
 So that's true. And so you're going outside of all of that.

45:41.480 --> 45:46.480
 Well, I mean, I was going inside of all of that and we did not come to terms

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
 when I was inside and what they did was so outside to me was so weird,

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
 so freakish, like the most senior, respectable people at the most senior,

45:57.040 --> 46:01.000
 respectable places were functionally insane as far as I could tell.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.760
 And again, it's like being functionally stupid.

46:03.760 --> 46:07.680
 If you're the head of the CDC or something where, you know,

46:07.680 --> 46:10.600
 you're giving recommendations out that aren't based on what you actually

46:10.600 --> 46:13.680
 believe. They're based on what you think you have to be doing. Well,

46:13.680 --> 46:14.520
 in some sense,

46:14.520 --> 46:18.680
 I think that that's a lot of how I saw the math and physics world as

46:18.680 --> 46:22.680
 the physics world was really crazy and the math world was considerably less

46:22.680 --> 46:25.160
 crazy, just very strict and kind of dogmatic.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.920
 Well, we'll psychoanalyze those folks,

46:27.960 --> 46:32.960
 but I really want to maybe linger on it a little bit longer of how you feel

46:33.520 --> 46:36.520
 because yeah, so this is such a, such a special moment in your life.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.240
 I really appreciate it. It's a great question.

46:38.280 --> 46:43.280
 So that if we can pair off some of that other, those other issues. Um,

46:43.280 --> 46:48.280
 it's new being able to say what the observers is,

46:49.400 --> 46:53.400
 which was my attempt to replace space time with something that is both closely

46:53.400 --> 46:57.200
 related to space, time and not space time. Um,

46:57.240 --> 47:02.240
 so I used to carry the number 14 as a closely guarded secret in my life and uh,

47:03.280 --> 47:08.280
 we're 14 is really four dimensions of space and time plus 10.

47:08.280 --> 47:13.280
 Extra dimensions of rulers and protractors or for the cool kids out there,

47:13.560 --> 47:15.120
 uh, symmetric two tensors.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.880
 She had a geometric,

47:18.160 --> 47:22.120
 a complicated, beautiful geometric view of the world that you cared with you

47:22.120 --> 47:24.240
 for a long time. Yeah. Did you,

47:24.240 --> 47:28.440
 did you have friends that you, um, colleagues, essentially? No.

47:28.920 --> 47:33.120
 Talked. No. In fact, part of these, part of some of these stories are me,

47:33.120 --> 47:34.160
 coming out of the world,

47:34.160 --> 47:39.160
 to my friends, um, and I use the phrase coming out because I think that gays

47:39.160 --> 47:41.200
 have monopolized the concept of the closet.

47:41.920 --> 47:45.680
 Many of us are in closets having nothing to do with our sexual orientation.

47:46.160 --> 47:50.600
 Um, yeah, I didn't really feel comfortable talking to almost anyone.

47:50.640 --> 47:54.200
 So this was a closely guarded, uh, secret.

47:54.320 --> 47:58.280
 And I think that I let on in some ways that I was up to something and probably

47:58.280 --> 48:02.720
 I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,

48:02.720 --> 48:07.040
 I was up to something and probably, but it was a very weird life. So I had to,

48:07.040 --> 48:10.960
 I had to have a series of things that I pretended to care about so that I could

48:11.280 --> 48:14.640
 use that as the stalking horse for what I really cared about. And to your point,

48:15.560 --> 48:19.080
 um, I never understood this whole thing about theories of everything.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.000
 Like if you were going to go into something like theoretical physics,

48:22.840 --> 48:25.320
 isn't that what you would normally pursue?

48:25.480 --> 48:29.720
 Like wouldn't it be crazy to do something that difficult and that poorly paid if

48:29.720 --> 48:33.000
 you were going to try to do something other than figure out what this is all

48:33.000 --> 48:33.840
 about?

48:34.400 --> 48:36.080
 Now I have to reveal my cards,

48:36.160 --> 48:41.160
 my sort of weaknesses and lack and understanding of the music of physics and

48:41.360 --> 48:42.240
 math departments.

48:42.800 --> 48:47.800
 But there's an analogy here to artificial intelligence and often folks come in

48:49.680 --> 48:50.920
 and say, okay,

48:50.920 --> 48:55.320
 so there's a giant department working on quote unquote artificial intelligence,

48:55.320 --> 48:59.960
 right? But why is nobody actually working on intelligence?

49:00.560 --> 49:04.520
 Like you're all just building little toys, right?

49:04.560 --> 49:08.680
 You're not actually trying to understand. And that breaks a lot of people. Uh,

49:08.760 --> 49:13.440
 they, it confuses them because like, okay, so I'm at MIT,

49:13.440 --> 49:16.400
 I'm at Stanford, I'm at Harvard, I'm here.

49:16.400 --> 49:19.240
 I dreamed of being working on artificial intelligence.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.200
 Why is everybody not actually working on intelligence?

49:23.200 --> 49:27.280
 And I have the same kind of sense that that's what working on the theory of

49:27.280 --> 49:32.280
 everything is that strangely you somehow become an outcast for even,

49:33.040 --> 49:38.440
 but we know why this is right. Why? Well, it's because let's take the artificial,

49:38.480 --> 49:40.080
 let's, let's play with AGI for example.

49:41.200 --> 49:45.560
 I think that the idea starts off with nobody really knows how to work on that.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.560
 And so if we don't know how to work on it,

49:48.160 --> 49:52.920
 we choose instead to work on a program that is tangentially related to it.

49:52.920 --> 49:57.920
 So we do a component of a program that is related to that big question because

49:58.040 --> 50:00.680
 it's felt like at least I can make progress there.

50:02.240 --> 50:05.280
 And that wasn't where I was, where I was in,

50:06.600 --> 50:10.040
 it's funny there was this book of a called Frieden Uhlenbeck and it had this

50:10.040 --> 50:12.600
 weird mysterious line in the beginning of it.

50:13.320 --> 50:17.920
 And I tried to get clarification of this weird mysterious line and everyone said

50:17.920 --> 50:20.440
 wrong things. And then I said, okay, well,

50:20.440 --> 50:24.520
 so I can tell that nobody's thinking properly because I just asked the entire

50:24.520 --> 50:28.600
 department and nobody has a correct interpretation of this.

50:29.320 --> 50:33.000
 And so, you know, it's a little bit like you see a crime scene photo

50:33.880 --> 50:36.040
 and you have a different idea.

50:36.040 --> 50:39.400
 Like there's a smoking gun and you figure that's actually a cigarette lighter.

50:39.400 --> 50:43.320
 I don't really believe that. And then there's like a pack of cards and you think,

50:43.320 --> 50:43.680
 Oh,

50:43.680 --> 50:47.360
 that looks like the blunt instrument that the person was beaten with. You know,

50:47.360 --> 50:50.560
 so you have a very different idea about how things go.

50:50.560 --> 50:54.000
 And very quickly you realize that there's no one thinking about that.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.480
 There's a few human sides to this and technical sides,

50:58.480 --> 51:02.720
 both of which I'd love to try to get down to. So the human side,

51:03.120 --> 51:08.000
 I can tell from my perspective, I think it was before April 1st, April Fools,

51:08.320 --> 51:09.760
 maybe the day before, I forget,

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
 but I was laying in bed in the middle of the night and somehow it popped up,

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
 you know on my feed somewhere that your beautiful face is speaking live and I

51:23.560 --> 51:26.840
 clicked. And you know,

51:26.840 --> 51:29.960
 it's kind of weird how the universe just brings things together in this kind of

51:29.960 --> 51:30.800
 way.

51:30.880 --> 51:34.720
 And all of a sudden I realized that there's something big happening at this

51:34.720 --> 51:38.400
 particular moment. It's strange. On a day,

51:38.400 --> 51:42.840
 like any day and all of a sudden you were thinking of,

51:42.840 --> 51:46.640
 you had this somber tone, like you were serious,

51:46.640 --> 51:51.640
 like you were going through some difficult decision and it seems strange.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.760
 I almost thought you were maybe joking,

51:56.080 --> 51:59.520
 but there was a serious decision being made and it was a wonderful experience

51:59.520 --> 52:00.360
 to go through with you.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.600
 I really appreciate it. I mean it was April 1st.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.880
 Yeah, it was, it's kind of fascinating. I mean it's just the whole experience.

52:05.880 --> 52:10.720
 And so I want to ask,

52:10.720 --> 52:14.760
 I mean thank you for letting me be part of that kind of journey of decision

52:14.760 --> 52:19.080
 making that took 30 years, but why now?

52:19.560 --> 52:20.720
 Why did you think,

52:21.240 --> 52:26.240
 why did you struggle so long not to release it and decide to release it now?

52:28.360 --> 52:32.320
 While the whole world is on lockdown on April Fools,

52:32.360 --> 52:37.360
 is it just because you like the comedy of absurd ways that the universe comes

52:38.120 --> 52:38.960
 together?

52:38.960 --> 52:40.320
 I don't think so.

52:40.880 --> 52:45.280
 I think that the COVID epidemic is the end of the big nap.

52:46.920 --> 52:51.920
 And I think that I actually tried this seven years earlier in Oxford.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.560
 So I, uh, and it was too early.

52:56.800 --> 52:59.200
 Which part was too, is it the platform?

52:59.200 --> 53:02.480
 Cause your platform is quite different now actually the internet. I remember you,

53:02.480 --> 53:06.840
 uh, I read several of your brilliant answers that people should read for the

53:06.840 --> 53:09.480
 edge questions. One of them was related to the internet.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.880
 And it was the first one. Was it the first one? Yeah.

53:12.880 --> 53:16.720
 An essay called go virtual young man. Yeah. Yeah. That seemed,

53:16.760 --> 53:19.520
 that's like forever ago now. Well that was 10 years ago.

53:19.520 --> 53:22.520
 And that's exactly what I did is I decamped to the internet,

53:22.520 --> 53:25.320
 which is where the portal lives, the portal, the portal, the portal.

53:27.120 --> 53:30.600
 Well, so the whole, the theme, that's the ominous theme music,

53:30.600 --> 53:32.720
 which you just listened to forever.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.920
 I actually started recording a tiny guitar licks, uh,

53:36.920 --> 53:40.000
 for the audio portion, not for the video portion. Um,

53:40.400 --> 53:43.560
 you've kind of inspired me with bringing your guitar into the story,

53:43.560 --> 53:44.400
 but keep going.

53:45.200 --> 53:48.400
 So you thought, so the Oxford was like step one and you kind of,

53:48.640 --> 53:52.240
 you put your foot into the, in the water to sample it,

53:52.640 --> 53:55.600
 but it was too cold at the time. So you didn't want to step in.

53:55.600 --> 53:56.880
 I was just really disappointed.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.320
 What was disappointing about that experience?

53:59.320 --> 54:01.080
 It's very, it's a hard thing to talk about.

54:01.080 --> 54:05.600
 It has to do with the fact that, and I can see this,

54:05.600 --> 54:09.200
 this, you know, this mirrors a disappointment within myself.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.640
 There are two separate issues.

54:10.640 --> 54:15.640
 One is the issue of making sure that the idea is actually heard and explored.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.360
 And the other is the,

54:18.360 --> 54:23.360
 I is the question about will I become disconnected from my work because it will

54:24.400 --> 54:27.520
 be ridiculed. It will, it will be immediately improved.

54:27.520 --> 54:31.320
 It will be found to be derivative of something that occurred in some paper in

54:31.320 --> 54:35.440
 1957. When the community does not want you to gain a voice,

54:37.040 --> 54:42.040
 it's a little bit like a policeman deciding to weirdly enforce all of these

54:42.720 --> 54:47.160
 little known regulations against you. And you know,

54:47.160 --> 54:50.880
 sometimes nobody else. And I think that's kind of, you know,

54:50.880 --> 54:57.880
 this weird thing where I just don't believe that we can reach the final theory

54:59.520 --> 55:03.240
 necessarily within the political economy of academics.

55:03.800 --> 55:08.400
 So if you think about how academics are tortured by each other and how they're

55:08.400 --> 55:11.200
 paid and where they have freedom and where they don't,

55:11.760 --> 55:15.360
 I actually weirdly think that that system of selective pressures is going to

55:15.360 --> 55:18.000
 eliminate anybody who's going to make real progress.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.200
 So that's interesting.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.440
 So if you look at the story of Andrew Wiles, for example,

55:22.440 --> 55:26.480
 with from our last term, I mean, he,

55:26.480 --> 55:28.240
 as far as I understand,

55:28.240 --> 55:33.160
 he pretty much isolated himself from the world of academics in terms of the big,

55:33.200 --> 55:34.600
 the bulk of the work he did.

55:35.200 --> 55:39.520
 And it from my perspective is dramatic and fun to read about,

55:39.920 --> 55:42.720
 but it seemed exceptionally stressful. The first step he took,

55:43.080 --> 55:47.240
 the first steps he took when actually making the work public that seemed to me

55:47.240 --> 55:51.720
 it would be hell, but it's like so artificially dramatic, you know,

55:51.720 --> 55:54.960
 he leads up to it at a series of lectures.

55:55.560 --> 55:59.760
 He doesn't want to say it. And then he finally says it at the end,

55:59.800 --> 56:02.920
 because obviously this comes out of a body of work where, I mean,

56:02.920 --> 56:06.680
 the funny part about from us last theorem is that wasn't originally thought to

56:06.680 --> 56:08.680
 be a deep and meaningful problem.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.680
 It was just an easy to state one that had gone unsolved.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.960
 But if you think about it,

56:13.960 --> 56:17.080
 it became attached to the body of regular theory.

56:17.600 --> 56:21.280
 So he built up this body of regular theory gets all the way up to the end

56:21.320 --> 56:25.840
 announces. And then like, there's this whole drama about, okay,

56:25.840 --> 56:29.320
 somebody's checking the proof. I don't understand what's going on in line 37,

56:30.040 --> 56:31.680
 you know, and like, Oh, is this serious?

56:31.720 --> 56:33.400
 It seems a little bit more serious than we knew.

56:33.640 --> 56:34.840
 I mean, do you see parallels?

56:35.000 --> 56:38.240
 Do you share the concern that your experience might be something similar?

56:38.280 --> 56:41.040
 Well, in his case, I think that if I recall correctly,

56:41.040 --> 56:42.680
 his original proof was unsalvageable.

56:42.680 --> 56:47.600
 He actually came up with a second proof with a

56:47.600 --> 56:50.120
 colleague, Richard Taylor.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.800
 And it was that second proof which carried the day.

56:53.800 --> 56:58.520
 So it was a little bit that he got put under incredible pressure and then had

56:58.520 --> 57:00.920
 to succeed in a new way, having failed the first time,

57:00.920 --> 57:03.520
 which is like even a weirder and stranger story.

57:03.520 --> 57:06.600
 That's an incredible story in some sense. But I mean, are you,

57:06.880 --> 57:09.600
 I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of stress.

57:09.600 --> 57:14.040
 I think that this is okay, but I'm rejecting what I don't think people

57:14.040 --> 57:16.960
 understand with me is the scale of the critique.

57:18.440 --> 57:21.560
 It's like, I don't, you, people say, well,

57:21.560 --> 57:24.280
 you must implicitly agree with this and implicitly agree. It's like, no,

57:24.280 --> 57:27.080
 try me ask before you,

57:27.160 --> 57:30.880
 you decide that I am mostly in agreement with the community about how these

57:30.880 --> 57:33.560
 things should be handled or what these things mean.

57:33.640 --> 57:37.280
 Can you, can you elaborate? And also just why, um,

57:37.280 --> 57:41.480
 does criticism matter so much here?

57:41.880 --> 57:46.880
 So you seem to dislike the burden of criticism that it will choke away all

57:49.560 --> 57:50.800
 different kinds of criticism.

57:51.320 --> 57:54.360
 There's constructive criticism and there's destructive criticism.

57:54.840 --> 57:59.840
 And what I don't like is I don't like a community that can't,

58:01.640 --> 58:03.760
 first of all, like if you take the physics community,

58:03.760 --> 58:08.680
 like just the way we screwed up on masks and PPE, uh,

58:08.720 --> 58:11.320
 just the way we screwed up in the financial crisis and mortgage backed

58:11.320 --> 58:13.240
 securities, we screwed up on string theory.

58:13.880 --> 58:17.640
 Can we just forget the string theory happened or sure,

58:17.680 --> 58:20.600
 but somebody should say that, right? Somebody should say, you know,

58:20.600 --> 58:24.880
 it didn't work out. Yeah. But okay.

58:24.880 --> 58:25.840
 But you're asking this,

58:25.880 --> 58:30.240
 like why do you guys get to keep the prestige after failing for 35 years?

58:30.240 --> 58:34.000
 Yeah. That's an interesting question. You guys, because to me,

58:34.720 --> 58:38.960
 look these things, if there is a theory of everything to be had, right?

58:39.640 --> 58:43.240
 It's going to be a relatively small group of people where this will be sorted

58:43.240 --> 58:46.800
 out. Absolutely. It's, it's, it's not tens of thousands.

58:46.840 --> 58:49.440
 It's probably hundreds at the top.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.400
 But within that, within that community,

58:53.400 --> 58:57.200
 there is the assholes.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.280
 There's the, I mean, they, you have,

59:00.280 --> 59:04.680
 you always in this world have people who are kind, open minded.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.760
 It's a question about, okay,

59:08.160 --> 59:09.760
 let's imagine for example,

59:10.000 --> 59:14.560
 that you have a story where you believe that ulcers are definitely

59:14.560 --> 59:18.600
 caused by stress and you've never questioned it.

59:18.640 --> 59:21.920
 Or maybe you felt like the Japanese came out of the blue and attacked us at

59:21.920 --> 59:23.760
 Pearl Harbor, right?

59:23.760 --> 59:27.120
 And now somebody introduces a new idea to you, which is like,

59:27.160 --> 59:28.560
 what if it isn't stress at all?

59:29.000 --> 59:33.720
 Or what if we actually tried to make resource star of Japan attack us somewhere

59:33.720 --> 59:36.840
 in the Pacific so we could have cast this belly to enter the Asian theater

59:38.520 --> 59:42.120
 person's original idea is like, what, what are you even saying? You know,

59:42.120 --> 59:44.960
 it's like too crazy. Well,

59:45.040 --> 59:47.320
 when Dirac in 1963

59:47.320 --> 59:52.320
 talked about the importance of beauty as a guiding principle in physics and he

59:52.320 --> 59:56.200
 wasn't talking about the scientific method, that was crazy talk,

59:57.200 --> 1:00:00.120
 but he was actually making a great point and he was using Schrodinger.

1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:04.240
 And I think it was Schrodinger was standing in for him and he said that if your

1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:08.400
 equations don't agree with experiment, that's kind of a minor detail.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:09.800
 If they have true beauty in them,

1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:15.280
 you should explore them because very often the agreement with experiment is

1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:20.280
 that it is an issue of fine tuning of your model of the instantiation.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.120
 And so it doesn't really tell you that your model is wrong.

1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:30.360
 And of course Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was wrong because that the

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:33.680
 proton and the electron should be the same mass if they are each other's

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:34.560
 anti particles.

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:40.560
 And that was an irrelevant kind of silliness rather than a real threat to the

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:45.800
 Dirac theory. But okay. So amidst all this silliness,

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:51.240
 I'm hoping that we could talk about the journey that geometric unity has taken

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:55.200
 and will take as an idea and an idea that we'll see the light.

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.360
 Yeah. That. So first of all, let's,

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:03.720
 I'm thinking of writing a book called geometric unity for idiots. Okay.

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:07.160
 And I need you as a consultant. So can we, first of all,

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:10.400
 I hope I have the trademark on geometric unit. You do. Good.

1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:15.400
 Can you give a basic introduction of the goals of geometric unity?

1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:22.120
 The basic tools of mathematics use the viewpoints in general for idiots.

1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:26.000
 Sure. Like me. Okay. Great. Fun.

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:28.760
 So what's the goal of geometric unity?

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:33.800
 The goal of geometric unity is to start with something so completely bland that

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:37.520
 you can simply say, well,

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:41.320
 that's a something that begins the game is as close to a mathematical.

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:44.400
 Nothing is possible. In other words, I can't answer the question.

1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:46.080
 Why is there something rather than nothing?

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:48.680
 But if there has to be a something that we begin from,

1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:52.320
 let it begin from something that's like a blank canvas.

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:58.040
 Let's even more basic. So what is something, what are we trying to describe here?

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000
 Right now we have a model of our world and it's got two sectors.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.640
 Two sectors. One of the sectors is called general relativity.

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:09.360
 The other is called the standard model.

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:14.840
 So we'll call it GR for general relativity and SM for standard model.

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:18.480
 What's the difference between the two? What are the two described?

1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:24.320
 So general relativity gives pride of place to gravity and everything else is

1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:30.600
 acting as a sort of a back, a backup singer.

1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:33.920
 Gravity is the star of the show. Gravity is the star of general relativity.

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:37.480
 And in the standard model,

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:41.360
 the other three non gravitational forces.

1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:44.240
 So if there are four forces that we know about three of the four non

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:48.480
 gravitational, that's where they get to shine. Great.

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:52.120
 So tiny little particles and how they interact with each other.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:57.120
 So photons, gluons and so called intermediate vector bosons.

1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:02.120
 Those are the things that the standard model showcases and general relativity

1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:04.440
 showcases gravity. And then you have matter,

1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:08.040
 which is accommodated in both theories,

1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:10.680
 but much more beautifully inside of the standard model.

1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:14.520
 So what, what is a theory of everything do?

1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:17.160
 So, so first of all, I think that that's,

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:19.840
 that's the first place where we haven't talked enough.

1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:21.800
 We assume that we know what it means,

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:25.080
 but we don't actually have any idea what it means.

1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:30.080
 And what I claim it is, is that it's a theory where the questions beyond that

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.120
 theory are no longer of a mathematical nature.

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:40.200
 In other words, if I say, let us take, um,

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:44.560
 X to be a four dimensional manifold

1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:48.600
 to a mathematician or a physicist. I've said very little.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.000
 I've simply said there's some place for calculus and linear algebra to,

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.440
 to, uh, to dance together and to play.

1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:00.840
 And that's what manifolds are. They're the most natural place where,

1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:04.760
 where our two greatest math theories can really, uh,

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:07.640
 intertwine.

1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:12.640
 Which are the two? Oh, you mean calculus and linear algebra. Right. Okay.

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:16.560
 Now the question is beyond that. So it's sort of like saying,

1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:18.680
 I'm an artist and I want to order a canvas.

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:23.680
 Okay. Now the question is, does the canvas paint itself?

1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:29.480
 Does the can, does the canvas come up with an artist

1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:36.720
 and paint an ink, which then paint the canvas? Like that's the,

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:39.240
 that's the hard part about theories of everything,

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:41.320
 which I don't think people talk enough about.

1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:45.480
 Can we just, you bring up Escher and the hand that draws itself.

1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:49.840
 Is it the fire that lights itself or drawing hands, the drawing hands. Yeah.

1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:54.840
 And, uh, every time I start to think about that, my mind like, uh,

1:04:54.880 --> 1:05:00.200
 shuts down. Well, don't do that. There's a spark and this is the most beautiful

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.520
 part. We should do this together. No, it's beautiful, but, uh,

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:07.360
 this robot's brain, uh, sparks fly.

1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:12.880
 So can we try to say the same thing over and over in different ways about what,

1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:17.240
 what, what you mean by that having to be a thing we have to contend with?

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:19.200
 Sure. Like why,

1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:22.520
 why do you think that creating a theory of everything,

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:28.000
 as you call the source code are understanding our source code require a view

1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:31.040
 like the hand that draws itself. Okay.

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:34.760
 Well here's what goes on in the regular physics picture.

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:38.360
 We've got these two main theories, general relativity and the standard model.

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:39.240
 Right?

1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:44.240
 Okay. Think of general relativity as more or less,

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:48.280
 the theory of the canvas. Okay.

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:52.720
 Maybe you have the canvas in a particularly rigid shape.

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:55.320
 Maybe you've measured it. So it's got length and it's got angle,

1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:58.280
 but more or less it's just canvas and length and angle.

1:05:58.720 --> 1:06:02.560
 And that's all that really general relativity is,

1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:04.720
 but it allows the canvas to warp a bit.

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:08.280
 Okay. Then we have the second thing,

1:06:08.560 --> 1:06:13.560
 which is this import of foreign libraries where,

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:17.920
 which aren't tied to space and time.

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:23.200
 So we've got this crazy set of symmetries called SU three cross SU two cross U

1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:24.040
 one.

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:27.600
 We've got this collection of 16 particles in a generation,

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:29.480
 which are these sort of twisted spinners.

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.600
 And we've got three copies of them.

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:36.960
 Then we've got this weird Higgs field that comes in and like Deus ex machina

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:40.960
 solves all the problems that have been created in the play that can't be

1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:42.000
 resolved otherwise.

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:45.200
 So that's the standard model of quantum field theory just plopped on top.

1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:48.880
 It's a problem of the double origin story.

1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:51.280
 One origin story is about space and time.

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:56.320
 The other origin story is about what we would call internal quantum numbers and

1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:57.440
 internal symmetries.

1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:02.440
 And then there was an attempt to get one to follow from the other called

1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:04.680
 Kaluza Klein theory, which didn't work out.

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:09.280
 And this is sort of in that vein.

1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:15.360
 So you said origin story. So in the hand that draws itself,

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:16.200
 what is it?

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:21.000
 So it's, it's as if you had the canvas and then you ordered

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:26.000
 up also give me paint brushes, paints, pigments, pencils, and artists.

1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:29.800
 But you're saying that's like, if you want to create a universe from scratch,

1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:33.960
 the canvas should be generating the paintbrushes and the paintbrushes and the

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:38.280
 artists, right? Like you should, who's the artist in this analogy?

1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.080
 Well, this is sorry.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:42.320
 Then we're going to get into a religious thing and I don't want to do that.

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:46.960
 Okay. Well, you know my shtick, which is that we are the AI.

1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:51.440
 We have two great stories about the simulation and artificial general

1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:53.480
 intelligence. In one story,

1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:59.400
 man fears that some program we've given birth to will become self aware,

1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.760
 smarter than us and we'll take over in another story.

1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:09.680
 There are genius simulators and we live in their simulation and we haven't

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:14.440
 realized that those two stories are the same story. In one case,

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:18.640
 we are the simulator. In another case,

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:23.640
 we are the simulated and if you buy those and you put them together,

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:27.080
 we are the AGI and whether or not we have simulators,

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:30.280
 we may be trying to wake up by learning our own source code.

1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:31.960
 So this could be our Skynet moment,

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:33.800
 which is one of the reasons I have some issues around it.

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:36.920
 I think we'll talk about that cause I,

1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:40.800
 well that's the issue of the emergent artist within the story just to get back

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:42.280
 to the point. Okay. So,

1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:47.120
 so now the key point is the standard way we tell the story is that Einstein sets

1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:52.120
 the canvas and then we order all the stuff that we want and then that paints the

1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.040
 picture that is our universe.

1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:57.520
 So you order the, the, the paint,

1:08:57.920 --> 1:08:59.800
 you order the artist,

1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:05.600
 you order the brushes and that then when you collide the two gives you two

1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:07.760
 separate origin stories.

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:12.280
 The canvas came from one place and everything else came from somewhere else.

1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:17.040
 So what are the mathematical tools required to,

1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:21.480
 to construct consistent geometric theory?

1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:22.320
 Yeah.

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:25.000
 You know, make this concrete.

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:30.240
 Well, somehow you need to get three copies,

1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:31.200
 for example,

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:35.240
 of generations with 16 particles each,

1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:40.640
 right? And so the question would be like, well, there's a lot,

1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:43.720
 there's a lot of special personality in those symmetries.

1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:47.680
 Where would they come from? So for example,

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:52.040
 you've got what would be called grand unified theories that sound like,

1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:55.280
 um, SU five, uh, the George I.

1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:58.400
 Glashow theory. There's something that should be called spin 10,

1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:00.760
 but physicists insist on calling it SO 10.

1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:06.080
 There's something called the petit salon theory that tends to be called SU four

1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:10.120
 cross SU two cross SU two, which should be called spin six cross spin four.

1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:11.600
 I can get into all of these.

1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:13.800
 What are they all accomplishing?

1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:18.200
 They're all taking the known forces that we see and packaging them up

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:22.600
 to say, we can't get rid of the second origin story,

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:25.720
 but we can at least make that origin story more unified.

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:29.240
 So they're trying grand unification is the attempt to.

1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:30.800
 And that's a mistake in your, in your.

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:35.240
 It's not a mistake that the problem is, is it was born lifeless. When,

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:35.920
 when George I.

1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:40.520
 And Glashow first came out with the SU five theory, um,

1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:45.160
 it was very exciting because it could be tested in a South Dakota, um,

1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:49.040
 mine filled up with like, I dunno, cleaning fluid or something like that.

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:51.760
 And they looked for proton decay and didn't see it.

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:54.240
 And then they gave up because in that day,

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:56.720
 when your experiment didn't work, you gave up on the theory.

1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:02.200
 It didn't come to us born of a fusion between Einstein and,

1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:04.920
 and, and bore, you know,

1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:09.440
 and that was kind of the problem is that it had this weird parenting where it

1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:12.760
 was just on the bore side. There was no Einsteinian contribution.

1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:19.880
 Lex, how can I help you most? I'm trying to figure,

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:23.520
 what questions do you want to ask so that you get the most satisfying answers?

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:26.040
 Uh, there's, there's a, there's a bunch,

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:28.400
 there's a bunch of questions I want to ask. I mean, one,

1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:33.440
 and I'm trying to sneak up on you somehow to reveal

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:38.440
 in a accessible way, then the nature of our universe.

1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:41.840
 So I can just give you a guess, right?

1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:47.520
 We have to be very careful that we're not claiming that this has been accepted.

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:51.880
 This is a speculation, but I will, I will make the speculation that what,

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:55.480
 I think what you would want to ask me is how can the canvas generate all the

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.960
 stuff that usually has to be ordered separately? All right. Should we do that?

1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:00.360
 Let's go there. Okay.

1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:03.600
 Okay. So the first thing is,

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:07.640
 is that you have a concept in computers called technical debt.

1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:10.440
 You're coding and you cut corners and you know,

1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:14.720
 you're going to have to do it right before the thing is safe for the world,

1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:20.400
 but you're piling up some series of IO use to yourself and your project as

1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:22.800
 you're going along.

1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:28.680
 So the first thing is we can't figure out if you have only four degrees of

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:30.640
 freedom. And that's what your canvas is.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:35.280
 How do you get at least Einstein's world? Einstein says, look,

1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:36.880
 it's not just four degrees of freedom,

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.720
 but there need to be rulers and protractors to measure length and angle in the

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:44.440
 world. You can't just have a flabby four degrees of freedom.

1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:49.440
 So the first thing you do is you create 10 extra variables,

1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.480
 which is like if we can't choose any particular set of rulers and protractors to

1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:55.960
 measure length and angle, let's take the,

1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:00.080
 take the set of all possible rulers and protractors.

1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:04.880
 And that would be called symmetric non degenerate two tensors on the tangent

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:07.000
 space of the four manifold X four.

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:10.880
 Now because there are four degrees of freedom,

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.560
 you start off with four dimensions.

1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:17.600
 Then you need four rulers for each of those different directions.

1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:20.360
 So that's four that gets us up to eight variables.

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:24.800
 And then between four original variables, there are six possible angles.

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.320
 So four plus four plus six is equal to 14.

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:33.440
 So now you've replaced X four with another space, which in the lecture,

1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:36.160
 I think I called you 14, but I'm now calling Y 14.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.720
 This is one of the big problems of working on something in private is every time

1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:42.680
 you pull it out, you sort of can't remember it. You name something, something new.

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:45.560
 Okay. So you've got a 14 dimensional world,

1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:50.560
 which is the original four dimensional world plus a lot of extra gadgetry for

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:52.240
 measurement.

1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:55.200
 Yeah. And because you're not in the four dimensional world,

1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:56.320
 you don't have the technical debt.

1:13:56.880 --> 1:13:59.840
 No, now you've got a lot of technical debt because now you have to explain away

1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:02.080
 a 14 dimensional world, which is a big,

1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:05.800
 you're taking a huge advance on your payday check, right?

1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:10.240
 But aren't more dimensions allow you more freedom to, I mean,

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:13.320
 maybe, but you have to get rid of them somehow because we don't perceive them.

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.880
 So eventually you have to collapse it down to the thing that we perceive or you

1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:21.880
 have to sample a four dimensional filament within that 14 dimensional world known

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:24.280
 as a section of a bundle.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:31.240
 Okay. So how do we get from the four 14 dimensional world where I imagine a lot

1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:33.760
 of, oh, wait, wait, wait. Yep. You're cheating.

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:38.240
 The first question was how do we get something from almost nothing?

1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:39.960
 Like how do we get the,

1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:45.720
 if I've said that the who and the what in the newspaper story that is a theory

1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:50.680
 theory of everything are bosons and Fermions. So let's make the who,

1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:54.240
 the Fermions and the what the bosons think of it as the players and the

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:55.360
 equipment for a game.

1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:00.640
 Are we supposed to be thinking of actual physical things with mass or energy?

1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:04.240
 Okay. So think about everything you see in this room.

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:08.440
 So from chemistry, you know, it's all protons, neutrons and electrons,

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:12.240
 but from a little bit of late 1960s physics,

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:16.000
 we know that the protons and neutrons are all made of up quarks and down quarks.

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:19.840
 So everything in this room is basically up quarks, down quarks,

1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:24.200
 and electrons stuck together with, with the, the, what the equipment.

1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:26.040
 Okay.

1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:31.760
 Now the way we see it currently is we see that there are space time indices,

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.960
 which we would call spinners that correspond to the who that is the Fermions,

1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:41.120
 the matter, the stuff, the up quarks, the down quarks, the electrons.

1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:44.720
 And there are also

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.640
 16 degrees of freedom that come from this in this space of internal quantum

1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:55.760
 numbers. So in my theory,

1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:57.360
 in 14 dimensions,

1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:02.120
 there's no internal quantum number space that figures in.

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:05.200
 It's all just spin oriel.

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:10.200
 So spinners in 14 dimensions without any festooning with extra linear algebraic

1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:15.760
 information.

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:20.160
 There's a concept of a, of, of, of spinners,

1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:25.920
 which is natural if you have a manifold with length and angle and Y 14 is almost

1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:32.240
 a manifold with length and angle. It's,

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.960
 it's so close. It's in other words,

1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:39.320
 because you're looking at the space of all rulers and protractors,

1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:43.520
 maybe it's not that surprising that a space of rulers and protractors might come

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:46.800
 very close to having rulers and protractors on it itself.

1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:52.040
 Like can you measure the space of measurements and you almost can't in a space

1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:53.920
 that has length and angle.

1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:58.480
 If it doesn't have a topological obstruction comes with these objects called

1:16:58.480 --> 1:16:59.320
 spinners.

1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:04.320
 Now spinners are the stuff of of our world.

1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:08.360
 We are made of spinners. They are the most important,

1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:11.720
 really deep object that I can tell you about. They were very surprising.

1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:14.600
 What is a spinner? So famously,

1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:19.640
 there are these weird things that require 720 degrees of rotation in order to

1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:26.040
 come back to normal. And that doesn't make sense.

1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:31.040
 And the reason for this is that there's a knottedness in our three dimensional

1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:34.400
 world that people don't observe. And you know,

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:39.000
 you can famously see it by this Dirac string trick.

1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:40.440
 So if you take a glass of water,

1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:43.080
 imagine that this was a tumbler and I didn't want to spill any of it.

1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:48.680
 And the question is if I rotate the cup without losing my grip on the base,

1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:53.480
 360 degrees and I can't go backwards,

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:58.400
 is there any way I can take a sip? And the answer is this weird motion,

1:17:58.480 --> 1:17:59.320
 which is

1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:04.760
 go over first and under second.

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:08.400
 And that that's 720 degrees of rotation to come back to normal so that I can

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:10.840
 take a sip. Well, that weird principle,

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:14.840
 which sometimes is known as the Philippine wine glass dance because waitresses

1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:18.160
 in the Philippines apparently learned how to do this.

1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:19.160
 Um,

1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:24.160
 so that that move defines if you will,

1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:28.040
 this hidden space that nobody knew was there of spinners,

1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:32.760
 which Dirac figured out when he took the square root of something called the

1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:37.000
 Klein Gordon equation, uh, which I think had earlier,

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:42.680
 um, work incorporated from Cartan and killing and company in mathematics.

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:46.760
 So spinners are one of the most profound aspects of human existence.

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:49.400
 I mean, forgive me for the perhaps dumb questions, but, uh,

1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:54.560
 would a spinner be the mathematical objects that's the basic unit of our

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:55.400
 universe?

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:59.120
 When you, when you start with a manifold,

1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:06.200
 um, which is just like something like a donut or a sphere circle or a Mobius

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:07.040
 band,

1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:12.680
 a spinner is usually the first wildly surprising thing that you found was

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:14.720
 hidden in your original purchase.

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:15.560
 So you,

1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:20.560
 you order a manifold and you didn't even realize it's like buying a house and

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:23.480
 finding a panic room inside that you hadn't counted on.

1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:27.200
 It's very surprising when you understand that spinners are running around on

1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:28.040
 your spaces.

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:31.640
 Again, perhaps a dumb question,

1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:34.880
 but we're talking about 14 dimensions and four dimensions.

1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:37.720
 What is the manifold we're operating under?

1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:41.720
 So in my case, it's proto space time. It's before,

1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:46.720
 it's before Einstein can slap rulers and protractors on space time.

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.680
 What do you mean by that? Sorry to interrupt is space.

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.840
 Time is the four D manifold.

1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:56.640
 Space time is a four dimensional manifold with extra structure.

1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:58.880
 What's the extra structure?

1:19:58.920 --> 1:20:03.280
 It's called a semi Ramanian or pseudo Ramanian metric.

1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:05.240
 In essence,

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:10.280
 there is something akin to a four by four symmetric manifold.

1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:15.280
 Four symmetric matrix from which is equivalent to length and angle.

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:17.520
 So when I talk about rulers and protractors,

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:19.160
 or I talk about length and angle,

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:24.040
 or I talk about Ramanian or pseudo Ramanian or semi Ramanian met manifolds,

1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:25.960
 I'm usually talking about the same thing.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:30.720
 Can you measure how long something is and what the angle is between two

1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:32.960
 different rays or vectors?

1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:42.400
 So that's what Einstein gave us as his arena, his place to play, his his canvas.

1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:45.880
 So there's a bunch of questions I can ask here.

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:50.320
 But like I said, I'm working on this book, Geometric Unity for Idiots.

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:57.280
 And and I think what would be really nice as your editor

1:20:57.280 --> 1:21:05.760
 to have like beautiful, maybe even visualizations that people could try to

1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:09.760
 play with, try to try to reveal small little beauties about the way you're

1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:10.680
 thinking about the score.

1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:12.840
 Well, I usually use the Joe Rogan program for that.

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:16.200
 Sometimes I have him doing the Philippine wine glass dance.

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:17.880
 I had the hop vibration.

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:23.680
 The part of the problem is that most people don't know this language about

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:27.520
 spinners, bundles, metrics, gauge fields.

1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:31.720
 And they're very curious about the theory of everything, but they have no

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:34.320
 understanding of even what we know about our own world.

1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:37.400
 Is it, is it a hopeless pursuit?

1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:39.840
 So like even gauge theory, right?

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:43.320
 Just this, I mean, it seems to be very inaccessible.

1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:46.080
 Is there some aspect of it that could be made accessible?

1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:50.120
 I mean, I could go to the board right there and give you a five minute lecture

1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:54.560
 on gauge theory that would be better than the official lecture on gauge theory.

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:56.440
 You would know what gauge theory was.

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.240
 So it is, it's, it's possible to make it accessible, but nobody does.

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:05.400
 Like, in other words, you're going to watch over the next year, lots of

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:09.920
 different discussions about quantum entanglement or, you know, the multiverse.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:11.080
 Where are we now?

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:14.960
 Or, you know, many worlds, are they all equally real?

1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:15.360
 Yeah.

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:17.520
 Right.

1:22:17.840 --> 1:22:19.120
 I mean, yeah, that's okay.

1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:22.120
 But you're not going to hear anything about the hop vibration except if

1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:23.520
 it's from me and I hate that.

1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:26.080
 Why, why can't you be the one?

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:28.200
 Well, because I'm going a different path.

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:31.840
 I think that we've made a huge mistake, which is we have things we can show

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.680
 people about the actual models.

1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:38.240
 We can push out visualizations where they they're not listening by analogy.

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:40.280
 They're watching the same thing that we're seeing.

1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:45.640
 And as I've said to you before, this is like choosing to perform sheet music

1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:47.520
 that hasn't been performed in a long time.

1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:50.040
 Or, you know, the experts can't afford orchestras.

1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.160
 So they just trade Beethoven symphonies as sheet music.

1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:55.000
 And they, Oh, wow, that was beautiful.

1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:57.280
 But it's like, nobody heard anything.

1:22:57.920 --> 1:22:59.040
 They just looked at the score.

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:03.280
 Well, that's how mathematicians and physicists trade papers and ideas is that

1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:06.680
 they, they write down the things that represent stuff.

1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:13.840
 I want to at least close out the thought line that you started, which is how does

1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:22.320
 the canvas order all of this other stuff into being so I at least want to say some

1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:23.960
 incomprehensible things about that.

1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:25.600
 And then we'll, we'll have that much done.

1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:26.440
 All right.

1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:32.000
 And that just point, does it have to be incomprehensible?

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.080
 Do you know what the Schrodinger equation is?

1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:34.880
 Yes.

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:36.960
 Do you know what the Dirac equation is?

1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:39.440
 What does no mean?

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:42.960
 Well, my point is you're going to have some feeling that, you know, what the

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:47.440
 Schrodinger equation is, as soon as we get to the Dirac equation, your eyes are

1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:49.920
 going to get a little bit glazed, right?

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:52.640
 So now why is that?

1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:59.920
 Well, the answer to me is, is that you, you want to ask me about the theory

1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:05.600
 of everything, but you haven't even digested the theory of everything as

1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.240
 we've had it since 1928 when Dirac came out with his equation.

1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:17.120
 So for whatever reason, and this isn't a hit on you, you haven't been motivated

1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:21.560
 enough in all the time that you've been on earth to at least get as far as the

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:22.520
 Dirac equation.

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:26.720
 And this was very interesting to me after I gave the talk in Oxford new scientist.

1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:32.080
 Who had done kind of a hatchet job on me to begin with sent a reporter to come to

1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:33.680
 the third version of the talk that I gave.

1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:37.200
 And that person had never heard of the Dirac equation.

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:43.560
 So you have a person who's completely professionally, not qualified to ask

1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:49.600
 these questions wanting to know, well, how does, how does your theory solve

1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:53.120
 new problems and like, well, in the case of the Dirac equation, well, tell me

1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:53.400
 about that.

1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:54.160
 I don't know what that is.

1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:56.920
 So then the point is, okay, I got it.

1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:01.480
 You're not even caught up minimally to where we are now.

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:03.120
 And that's not a knock on you.

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:04.960
 Almost nobody even knows where you are.

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:07.600
 And that's not a knock on you, almost nobody is.

1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:08.320
 Yeah.

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:13.320
 But then how does it become my job to digest what has been available

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:17.400
 for like over 90 years?

1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.280
 Well, to me, the open question is whether what's been available for over 90 years

1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:30.000
 can be, um, there could be, uh, a blueprint of a journey that one takes to

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.600
 understand it, not to do that with you.

1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:36.560
 And I, I, one of the things I think I've been relatively successful at, for

1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:41.720
 example, you know, when you ask other people what gauge theory is, you get

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.520
 these very confusing responses and my response is much simpler.

1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:49.800
 It's, oh, it's a theory of, uh, differentiation where when you calculate

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:54.360
 the instantaneous rise over run, you measure the rise, not from a flat

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.440
 horizontal, but from a custom endogenous reference level.

1:25:58.640 --> 1:25:59.560
 What do you mean by that?

1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:00.520
 It's like, okay.

1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:04.280
 And then I do this thing with Mount Everest, which is Mount Everest is how

1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:07.600
 high then they give the height I say above what then they say sea level.

1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:10.240
 And I say, which sea is that in Nepal?

1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:12.400
 Like, oh, I guess there isn't a sea cause it's landlocked.

1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:14.600
 It's like, okay, well, what do you mean by sea level?

1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:17.080
 Oh, there's this thing called the geoid I'd never heard of.

1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:18.560
 Oh, that's the reference level.

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.240
 That's a custom reference level that we imported.

1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:27.280
 So you, all sorts of people have remembered the exact height of Mount

1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:31.080
 Everest without ever knowing what it's a height from.

1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:35.600
 Well, in this case, engage theory, there's a hidden reference level where

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:39.440
 you measure the rise in rise over run to give the slope of the line.

1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:46.560
 What if you have different concepts of what, of where that rise should be

1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:50.560
 measured from that vary within the theory that are endogenous to the theory.

1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:52.160
 That's what gauge theory is.

1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:54.040
 Okay.

1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:55.160
 We have a video here, right?

1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:55.480
 Yeah.

1:26:55.680 --> 1:26:56.000
 Okay.

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:56.320
 Okay.

1:26:57.160 --> 1:26:58.160
 I'm going to use my phone.

1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:05.000
 If I want to measure my hand and its slope, this is my attempt to

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.720
 measure it using standard calculus.

1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:11.280
 In other words, the reference level is apparently flat and I measure the

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:14.720
 rise above that phone using my hand.

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:15.320
 Okay.

1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:20.200
 If I want to use gauge theory, it means I can do this or I can do that, or

1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:23.240
 I can do this, or I can do this, or I could do what I did from the beginning.

1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:24.480
 Okay.

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:26.520
 At some level, that's what gauge theory is.

1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:27.840
 Now that is an act.

1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:30.680
 No, I've never heard anyone describe it that way.

1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:34.240
 So while the community may say, well, who is this guy and why does he

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:35.560
 have the right to talk in public?

1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:39.960
 I'm waiting for somebody to jump out of the woodwork and say, you know,

1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.920
 Eric's whole shtick about rulers and protractors, uh, leading to a derivative.

1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:47.640
 Derivatives are measured as rise over run above reference level.

1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:48.800
 The reference levels don't fit together.

1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:51.680
 Like I go through this whole shtick in order to make it accessible.

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:54.360
 I've never heard anyone say it.

1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:58.600
 I'm trying to make Prometheus would like to discuss fire with everybody else.

1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:00.160
 All right.

1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:03.800
 I'm going to just say one thing to close out the earlier line, which is what I

1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:05.120
 think we should have continued with.

1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:10.960
 When you take the naturally occurring spinners, the unadorned spinners, the

1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:18.120
 naked spinners, not on this 14 dimensional manifold, but on something very closely

1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:23.400
 tied to it, which I've called the chimeric tangent bundle, that is the object

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:27.560
 which stands in for the thing that should have had length and angle on it,

1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:28.480
 but just missed.

1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:28.920
 Okay.

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:34.440
 When you take that object and you form spinners on that and you don't adorn them.

1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:36.480
 So you're still in the single origin story.

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:43.800
 You get very large spin oriel objects upstairs on this 14 dimensional world.

1:28:43.800 --> 1:28:46.520
 Why 14, which is part of the observers.

1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:56.320
 When you pull that information back from Y 14 down to X four, it miraculously

1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:03.800
 looks like the adorned spinners, the festoon spinners, the spinners that

1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:05.920
 we play with in ordinary reality.

1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:11.160
 In other words, the 14 dimensional world looks like a four dimensional world

1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:13.640
 plus a 10 dimensional compliment.

1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:17.960
 So 10 plus four equals 14, that 10 dimensional compliment, which is called

1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:24.040
 a normal bundle, generates spin properties, internal quantum numbers that look like

1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:30.160
 the things that give our, our particles personality that make let's say up quarks

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:36.080
 and down quarks charged by negative one third or plus two thirds, you know, that

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:42.640
 kind of stuff, or whether or not, you know, some quarks feel the weak side.

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:45.440
 Quarks feel the weak force and other quarks do not.

1:29:46.520 --> 1:29:52.600
 So the X four generates Y 14 Y 14 generates something called the chimeric

1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:56.160
 tangent bundle chimeric tangent bundle generates unadorned spinners.

1:29:56.520 --> 1:30:00.760
 The unadorned spinners get pulled back from 14 down to four where they

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:02.320
 look like adorned spinners.

1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:04.880
 And we have the right number of them.

1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:06.600
 You thought you needed three.

1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:10.720
 You only got two, but then something else that you'd never seen before

1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:15.800
 broke apart on this journey and it broke into another copy of the thing that you

1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:19.080
 already have two copies of one piece of that thing broke off.

1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:25.200
 So now you have two generations plus an imposter third generation, which is, I

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.520
 don't know why we never talk about this possibility in regular physics.

1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:31.760
 And then you've got a bunch of stuff that we haven't seen, which has descriptions.

1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:34.800
 So people always say, does it make any falsifiable predictions?

1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:35.480
 Yes, it does.

1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:41.120
 It says that the matter that you should be seeing, um, next has particular

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:47.600
 properties that can be read off like, like a weak ISIS spin, weak hypercharge,

1:30:47.640 --> 1:30:50.400
 like the responsiveness to the strong force.

1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:53.160
 The one I can't tell you is what energy scale it would happen at.

1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:58.760
 So you would, if you can't say if those characteristics can be

1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:01.960
 detected with the current, but it may be that somebody else can.

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:02.920
 I'm not a physicist.

1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:04.640
 I'm not a quantum field theorist.

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:07.240
 I can't, I don't know how you would do that.

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:14.640
 The hope for me is that there's some simple explanations for all of it.

1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:16.160
 Like, should we have a drink?

1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:18.280
 You're having fun.

1:31:18.600 --> 1:31:20.160
 No, I'm trying to have fun with you.

1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:26.240
 You know, there's a bunch of fun things to talk about here.

1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:30.680
 Anyway, that was how I got what I thought you wanted, which is,

1:31:30.680 --> 1:31:37.760
 if you think about the fermions as the artists and the bosons as the brushes

1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:42.080
 and the paint, what I told you is that's how we get the artists.

1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:46.240
 What are the open questions for you in this?

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:48.080
 What were the challenges?

1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:49.040
 So you're not done.

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:53.560
 Well, there's, there's things that I would like to have in better order.

1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:59.120
 So a lot of people will say, see, if you're going to do this, you have to

1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:03.920
 say, see, the reason I hesitate on this is I just have a totally different

1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:04.840
 view than the community.

1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:10.640
 So for example, I believe that general relativity began in 1913

1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:12.760
 with Einstein and Grossman.

1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:19.360
 Now that was the first of like four major papers in this line of thinking.

1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:25.800
 To most physicists, general relativity happened when Einstein produced, uh,

1:32:25.800 --> 1:32:32.760
 a divergence free, um, gradient, which turned out to be the gradient of the,

1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:35.840
 of the so called Hilbert or Einstein Hilbert action.

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.360
 And from my perspective, that wasn't true.

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:45.040
 This is that it began when Einstein said, look, this is about, um, differential

1:32:45.040 --> 1:32:49.960
 geometry and it's the final answer is going to look like a curvature tensor

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.880
 on one side and matter and energy on the other side.

1:32:53.280 --> 1:32:54.520
 And that was enough.

1:32:54.520 --> 1:32:58.600
 And then he published a wrong version of it where it was the Ricci tensor,

1:32:58.640 --> 1:32:59.920
 not the Einstein tensor.

1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:03.200
 Then he corrected the reach, the Ricci tensor to make it into the Einstein

1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:06.640
 tensor, then he corrected that to add a cosmological constant.

1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:11.360
 I can't stand that the community thinks in those terms.

1:33:11.840 --> 1:33:15.360
 There's some things about which, like there's a question about

1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:17.040
 which contraction do I use?

1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:18.680
 There's an Einstein contraction.

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.400
 There's a Ricci contraction.

1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:22.240
 They both go between the same spaces.

1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:23.800
 I'm not sure what I should do.

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:25.760
 I'm not sure which contraction I should choose.

1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:30.960
 This is called a shiab operator for ship in a bottle and my stuff.

1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:39.360
 You have this big platform in many ways that inspires people's

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.120
 curiosity about physics and mathematics.

1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:42.680
 Right.

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:50.960
 Now, and I'm one of those people and, but then you start using a lot of words

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:57.960
 that I don't understand and, or like I might know them, but I don't understand.

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:03.160
 And what's unclear to me, if I'm supposed to be listening to those words, or if

1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:08.280
 it's just, if this is one of those technical things that's intended for

1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:13.440
 a very small community, or if I'm supposed to actually take those words and start,

1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:20.240
 you know, a multi year study, not, not a serious study, but a, the community

1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:24.320
 study, but the kind of study when you, you're interested in learning about

1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:28.040
 machine learning, for example, or any kind of discipline, that's where

1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:29.400
 I'm a little bit confused.

1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:32.840
 So you've, you've speak beautifully about ideas.

1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:39.960
 You often reveal the beauty in math, in geometry, and I'm unclear in what

1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:41.720
 are the steps I should be taking.

1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:45.640
 I, I'm curious, how can I explore?

1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:46.880
 How can I play with something?

1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:48.440
 How can I play with these ideas?

1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:52.400
 And, and, and enjoy the beauty of not necessarily understanding the

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:56.280
 depth of the theory that you're presenting, but start to share in the

1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.480
 beauty, as opposed to sharing and enjoying the beauty of just the way,

1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:08.360
 the passion with which you speak, which is in itself fun to listen to, but

1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:14.160
 also starting to be able to understand some aspects of this theory that I can

1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:19.520
 enjoy it to, and start to build an intuition, what the heck we're even

1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:23.240
 talking about, because you're basically saying we need to throw a lot of our

1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:27.480
 ideas of, of views of the universe out.

1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:36.200
 And I'm trying to find accessible ways in, not in this conversation.

1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:37.760
 No, I appreciate that.

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:40.600
 So one of the things that I've done is I've, I've picked on one

1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:46.400
 paragraph from Edward Witten, and I said, this is the paragraph.

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:49.760
 If I could only take one paragraph with me, this is the one I'd take.

1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:52.000
 And it's almost all in prose, not an equation.

1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:55.480
 And he says, look, this is, this is our knowledge of the

1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:57.080
 universe at its deepest level.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.800
 And he was writing this during the 1980s.

1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:03.640
 And he has three separate points that constitute our deepest knowledge.

1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:08.840
 And those three points refer to equations, one to the Einstein field

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:12.760
 equation, one to the Dirac equation, and one to the Yang Mills Maxwell equation.

1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:20.440
 Now, one thing I would do is take a look at that paragraph and say, okay,

1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:22.680
 what do these three lines mean?

1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:24.560
 Like it's a finite amount of verbiage.

1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:26.520
 You can write down every word that you don't know.

1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:32.000
 And you can say, what do I think done now?

1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:33.200
 Young man.

1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:33.920
 Yes.

1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:39.400
 There's a beautiful wall in Stony Brook, New York built by someone

1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:44.920
 who I know you will interview named Jim Simons and Jim Simons.

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.360
 He's not the artist, but he's the guy who funded it.

1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:49.400
 World's greatest hedge fund manager.

1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:53.360
 And on that wall contain the three equations that Witten

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:56.280
 refers to in that paragraph.

1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:01.840
 And so that is the transmission from the paragraph or graph to the wall.

1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:07.320
 Now that wall needs an owner's manual, which Roger Penrose has written

1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:08.920
 called the road to reality.

1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:10.600
 And let's call that the tome.

1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:17.400
 So this is the subject of the so called graph wall tome project that is going

1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:22.600
 on in our discord server and our general group around the portal community, which

1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:28.520
 is how do you take something that purports in one paragraph to say what the deepest

1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:34.760
 understanding man has of the universe in which he lives, it's memorialized on a

1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:40.600
 wall, which nobody knows about, which is an incredibly gorgeous piece of, uh, of

1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:40.920
 art.

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:46.560
 And that was written up in a book, which is, has been written for no man.

1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:47.520
 Right.

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:48.960
 Maybe, maybe it's for a woman.

1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.920
 I don't know, but no, no one should be able to read this book because either

1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:56.560
 you're a professional and you know, a lot of this book, in which case it's kind of

1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:00.880
 a refresher to see how Roger thinks about these things, or you don't even know that

1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:05.560
 this book is a self contained, uh, invitation to understanding our deepest

1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:05.960
 nature.

1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:12.360
 So I would say find yourself in the graph wall tome transmission sequence and join

1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:15.000
 the graph wall tome project if that's of interest.

1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:16.000
 Okay.

1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:16.600
 Beautiful.

1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.440
 Uh, now just to linger on a little longer, what kind of journey do you

1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:22.320
 see geometric community taking?

1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:23.200
 I don't know.

1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:25.160
 I mean, that's the thing is that.

1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.280
 First of all, the professional community has to get very angry and outraged and

1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:31.520
 they have to work through their feeling that this is nonsense.

1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:33.920
 This is bullshit or like, no, wait a minute.

1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:35.000
 This is really cool.

1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:37.280
 Actually, I need some clarification over here.

1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:41.480
 So there's going to be some sort of weird coming back together process.

1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:45.360
 Are you already hearing murmurings of that?

1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:46.640
 It was very funny.

1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:47.960
 Officially I've seen very little.

1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:52.000
 So it's perhaps happening quietly.

1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:52.400
 Yeah.

1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:54.800
 You, you often talk about, we need to get off this planet.

1:38:55.200 --> 1:38:55.520
 Yep.

1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:01.920
 Can I try to sneak up on that by asking what in your kind of view is the

1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:07.760
 difference, the gap between the science of it, the theory and the actual

1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:11.320
 engineering of building something that leverages the theory to do something?

1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:12.400
 Like how big is that?

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:13.320
 We don't know.

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:14.320
 Gap.

1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:19.320
 I mean, if you have 10 extra dimensions to play with that are the rules of

1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:22.920
 protractors of the world themselves, can you gain access to those dimensions?

1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:26.280
 Do you have a hunch?

1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:27.600
 So I don't know.

1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:31.840
 I don't want to get ahead of myself because you have to appreciate, I can

1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:34.080
 have hunches and I can, I can jaw off.

1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:42.280
 But one of the ways that I'm succeeding in this world is to not bow down to my

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.760
 professional communities nor to ignore them.

1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:47.720
 Like I'm actually in the middle of a world where I'm not

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:50.840
 going to ignore them, like I'm actually interested in the criticism.

1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:56.720
 I just want to denature it so that it's not mostly interpersonal and irrelevant.

1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:01.560
 I believe that they don't want me to speculate and I don't

1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:02.960
 need to speculate about this.

1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:08.000
 I can simply say I'm open to the idea that it may have engineering prospects

1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:09.480
 and it may be a death sentence.

1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:15.360
 We may find out that there's not enough new here that even if it were right, that

1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:16.360
 there would be nothing new to do.

1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:19.560
 Can't tell you that's what you mean by death sentences.

1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:21.480
 There would not be exciting breakthroughs.

1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:25.600
 Wouldn't it be terrible if you couldn't, like you can do new things in an

1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:29.520
 Einsteinian world that you couldn't do in a Newtonian world, right?

1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:33.200
 You know, like you have twin paradoxes or Lorentz contraction of length or

1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:36.800
 any one of a number of new cool things happen in relativity theory

1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:38.040
 that didn't happen for Newton.

1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:43.040
 What if there wasn't new stuff to do at the next and final level?

1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:46.600
 Yeah, that would be quite sad.

1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:52.600
 Let me ask a silly question, but we'll say it with a straight face.

1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:56.160
 Impossible.

1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:01.640
 So let me mention Elon Musk.

1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:07.680
 What are your thoughts about he's more, you're more on the physics theory side

1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:11.400
 of things, he's more on the physics engineering side of things in terms of

1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:17.560
 SpaceX efforts, what do you think of his efforts to, uh, get off this planet?

1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:24.840
 Well, I think he's the other guy who's semi serious about getting off this planet.

1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:29.000
 I think there are two of us who are semi serious about getting off the planet.

1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:33.600
 What do you think about his methodology and yours when you look at them?

1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:38.480
 Don't, and I don't want to be against you because like I was so excited that like

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:42.920
 your top video was Ray Kurzweil and then I did your podcast and we had some

1:41:42.920 --> 1:41:46.200
 chemistry, so it zoomed up and I thought, okay, I'm going to beat Ray Kurzweil.

1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:50.720
 So just as I'm coming up on Ray Kurzweil, you're like, and now Alex Fridman

1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:53.360
 special Elon Musk and he blew me out of the water.

1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:54.680
 So I don't want to be petty about it.

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:58.080
 I want to say that I don't, but I am.

1:41:58.640 --> 1:41:59.000
 Okay.

1:41:59.000 --> 1:41:59.960
 But here's the funny part.

1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.720
 Um, he's not taking enough risk.

1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:05.280
 Like he's trying to get us to Mars.

1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:12.360
 Imagine that he got us to Mars, the moon, and we'll throw in Titan and nowhere

1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:15.400
 good enough, the diversification level is too low.

1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:17.160
 Now there's a compatibility.

1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:20.920
 First of all, I don't think Elon is serious about Mars.

1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:29.080
 I think Elon is using Mars as a, as a narrative, as a story, as a dream to

1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:33.640
 make the moon jealous to make the, uh,

1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:39.160
 uh, I think he's using it as a story to organize us, to reacquaint ourselves

1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:42.240
 with our need for space, our need to get off this planet.

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:43.480
 It's a concrete thing.

1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:48.800
 He shown that, um, many people think that he's shown that he's the most

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:50.840
 brilliant and capable person on the planet.

1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:52.120
 I don't think that's what he showed.

1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:55.000
 I think he showed that the rest of us have forgotten our capabilities.

1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:59.320
 And so he's like the only guy who has still kept the faith and is like,

1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:00.560
 what's wrong with you people?

1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:04.360
 So you think the lesson we should draw from Elon Musk is there's, uh, there's

1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:09.600
 a capable person within, within a lot of us, Elon makes sense to me in what way

1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:12.520
 he's doing, what any sensible person should do.

1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:17.400
 He's trying incredible things and he's partially succeeding, partially failing

1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:21.640
 to try to solve the obvious problems before, you know, when he comes up with

1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:23.800
 things like, uh, you know, I got it.

1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:26.680
 We'll come up with a battery company, but batteries aren't sexy.

1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:28.400
 So we'll, we'll make a car around it.

1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:33.320
 It's like, great, you know, or, um, any one of a number of things.

1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:39.400
 Elon is behaving like a sane person and I view everyone else is insane.

1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:44.680
 And my feeling is, is that we really have to get off this planet.

1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:46.040
 We have to get out of this.

1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:47.320
 We have to get out of the neighborhood.

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:49.600
 To linger on a little bit.

1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:53.000
 Do you think that's a physics problem or an engineering problem?

1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:55.400
 I think it's a cowardice problem.

1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:01.800
 I think that we're afraid that we had 400 hitters of the mind, like Einstein

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:03.880
 and Dirac and that, that era is done.

1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:07.880
 And now we're just sort of copy editors.

1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:13.640
 So it's some of it money, like if we become brave enough to go outside the

1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:17.160
 solar system, can we afford to financially?

1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:19.840
 Well, I think that that's not really the issue.

1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:27.760
 The issue is look what Elon did well, he amassed a lot of money and then he,

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:31.880
 you know, he plowed it back in and he spun, spun the wheel and he made more

1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:34.360
 money and now he's got F you money.

1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:41.640
 Now the problem is, is that a lot of the people who have F you money are not

1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:43.760
 people whose middle finger you ever want to see.

1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:45.520
 I want to see Elon's middle finger.

1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:47.960
 I want to see what he's doing by that.

1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:50.800
 Or like when you say, fuck it, I'm going to do the biggest possible.

1:44:50.800 --> 1:44:53.160
 Do whatever the fuck you want, right?

1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:54.080
 Fuck you.

1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:57.480
 Fuck anything that gets in his way that he can afford to push out of his way.

1:44:57.480 --> 1:44:59.880
 And you're saying he's not actually even doing that enough.

1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:02.440
 No, I'm he's not going, please.

1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:03.040
 I'm going to go.

1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:05.200
 Elon's doing fine with his money.

1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:11.000
 I just want him to enjoy himself, have the most, you know, Dionysian, but

1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.400
 you're saying Mars is playing it safe.

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:15.800
 He doesn't know how to do anything else.

1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:24.880
 He knows rockets and he might know some physics at a fundamental level.

1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:25.640
 Yeah.

1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:30.440
 I guess, okay, just, let me just go right back to how much physics do you really,

1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:34.400
 how much brilliant breakthrough ideas on the physics side do you

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:36.480
 need to get off this planet?

1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:38.320
 I don't know.

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:41.520
 And I don't know whether like in my most optimistic dream, I don't know

1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:42.920
 whether my stuff gets us out of this.

1:45:42.920 --> 1:45:46.080
 Like in my most optimistic dream, I don't know whether my stuff gets us off the

1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:51.200
 planet, but it's hope it's hope that there's a more fundamental theory that

1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:53.640
 we can access that we don't need.

1:45:54.120 --> 1:46:00.040
 Um, you know, whose elegance and beauty will suggest that this is probably

1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:01.280
 the way the universe goes.

1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:06.160
 Like you have to say this weird thing, which is this, I believe, and this,

1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:11.560
 I believe is a very dangerous statement, but this, I believe, I believe that my

1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:18.280
 theory, um, points the way now, Elon might or might not be able to access my

1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:18.680
 theory.

1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:19.160
 I don't know.

1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:25.400
 I don't know what he knows, but keep in mind, why are we all so focused on Elon?

1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:26.600
 It's really weird.

1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:27.720
 It's kind of creepy too.

1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:32.240
 Why he's just the person who's just asking the, the obvious questions

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:35.000
 and doing whatever he can, but he makes sense to me.

1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:37.080
 You see Craig Venter makes sense to me.

1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:41.000
 Jim Watson makes sense to me, but we're focusing on Elon.

1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.360
 Because he's, he's somehow is rare.

1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:45.360
 Well, that's the weird thing.

1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:50.520
 Like we've come up with a system that eliminates all Elon from our pipeline

1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:56.600
 and Elon somehow, uh, snuck through when they weren't quality adjusting

1:46:56.600 --> 1:46:57.360
 everything, you know?

1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:02.200
 And this, this idea of, uh, of disc, right?

1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:04.440
 Distributed idea suppression complex.

1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:04.840
 Yeah.

1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:08.920
 Is that what's bringing the Elans of the world down?

1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:10.320
 You know, it's so funny.

1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:14.520
 It's like, he's asking Joe Rogan, like, is that a joint, you know, it's like,

1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:16.240
 well, what, what will happen if I smoke it?

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:17.560
 What will happen to the stock price?

1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:20.480
 What will happen if I scratch myself in public?

1:47:20.840 --> 1:47:26.200
 What will happen if I say what I think about Thailand or COVID or who knows what?

1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:30.040
 And everybody's like, don't say that, say this, go do this, go do that.

1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:34.440
 Well, it's crazy making, it's absolutely crazy making.

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:41.240
 And if you think about what we put through people through, um, we, we

1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:46.840
 need to get people who can use FU money, the FU money they need to insulate

1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:51.720
 themselves from all of the people who know better, because the, the, my

1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:55.320
 nightmare is, is that why did we only get one Elon?

1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:58.520
 What if we were supposed to have thousands and thousands of Elans?

1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:03.400
 And the weird thing is like, this is all that remains you're, you're looking

1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:09.240
 at like OB one and Yoda, and it's like, this is the only, this is all that's

1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:13.520
 left after X, uh, order 66 has been executed.

1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:16.720
 And that's the thing that's really upsetting to me is we used, we

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:18.520
 used to have Elon's five deep.

1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:22.920
 And then we could talk about Elon in the context of his cohort.

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:27.320
 But this is like, if you were to see a giraffe in the Arctic with no

1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:32.200
 trees around, you'd think why the long neck, what a strange sight, you know?

1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:34.640
 You know, how do we get more Elans?

1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:36.880
 How do we change these?

1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:44.520
 So I think the use, so we know MIT and Harvard, so maybe returning to our

1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:48.800
 previous conversation, my sense is that the Elans of the world are supposed

1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:50.680
 to come from MIT and Harvard, right?

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:53.040
 And how do you change?

1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:55.520
 Let's think of one that MIT sort of killed.

1:48:57.480 --> 1:48:58.600
 Have any names in mind?

1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:00.840
 Aaron Schwartz leaps to my mind.

1:49:01.440 --> 1:49:01.760
 Yeah.

1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:02.400
 Okay.

1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:11.720
 Are we MIT supposed to shield the Aaron Schwartz's from, I don't know, journal

1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:15.640
 publishers, or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that we can

1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:19.840
 throw 35 year sentences in his face or whatever it is that we did that depressed

1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:20.960
 him? Okay.

1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:22.000
 So here's my point.

1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:22.400
 Yeah.

1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:29.240
 I want MIT to go back to being the home of Aaron Schwartz, and if you want to

1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:36.440
 send Aaron Schwartz to a state where he's looking at 35 years in prison or

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.800
 something like that, you are my sworn enemy.

1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:40.600
 You are not MIT.

1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:42.040
 Yeah.

1:49:42.040 --> 1:49:53.920
 You are the traitors, uh, irresponsible, middle brow, pencil pushing green

1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:59.160
 eyeshade fool that needs to not be in the seat at the, at the presidency of MIT

1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:03.360
 period, the end, get the fuck out of there and let one of our people sit in that

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:03.880
 chair.

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:10.160
 And the thing that you've articulated is that the people in those chairs are not

1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:15.240
 the way they are because they're evil or somehow morally compromised is that it's

1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:19.280
 just the, that's the distributed nature is that there's some kind of aspect of

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:25.400
 the system that people who wed themselves to the system, they adapt every instinct.

1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:30.880
 And the fact is, is that they're not going to be on Joe Rogan smoking a blunt.

1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:33.280
 Let me ask a silly question.

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:36.400
 Do you think institutions generally just tend to become that?

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:38.400
 No.

1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:41.320
 We get some of the institutions, we get Caltech.

1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:42.960
 Here's what we're supposed to have.

1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:44.320
 We're supposed to have Caltech.

1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:45.600
 We're supposed to have a read.

1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:48.000
 We're supposed to have deep springs.

1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:50.760
 We're supposed to have MIT.

1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:52.680
 We're supposed to have a part of Harvard.

1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:58.200
 And when the sharp elbow crowd comes after the shelf, sharp, uh, mind crowd,

1:50:58.200 --> 1:51:01.840
 we're supposed to break those sharp elbows and say, don't come around here

1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:02.160
 again.

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:06.320
 So what are the weapons that the sharp minds are supposed to use in our modern

1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:06.680
 day?

1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:11.160
 So to reclaim MIT, what, what is the, what's the future?

1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:12.000
 Are you kidding me?

1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:15.440
 First of all, assume that this is being seen at MIT.

1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:17.760
 Hey everybody is okay.

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:21.760
 Hey everybody, try to remember who you are.

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:25.280
 You're the guys who put the police car on top of the great dump.

1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:28.080
 You guys came up with the great breast of knowledge.

1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:30.480
 You created a Tetris game in the green building.

1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.920
 Now, what is your problem?

1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:37.080
 Is your problem they killed one of your own.

1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:39.960
 You should make their life a living hell.

1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:45.720
 You should be the ones who keep the mayor memory of Aaron Schwartz alive and all

1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:50.240
 of those hackers and all of those mutants, you know,

1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:53.440
 it's like it's either our place or it isn't.

1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:58.760
 And if we have to throw 12 more pianos off of the

1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:01.040
 roof, right?

1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:05.240
 If Harold Edgerton was taking those photographs, you know,

1:52:06.240 --> 1:52:08.080
 uh, with slow mo back in the forties,

1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:13.720
 if Noam Chomsky is on your faculty,

1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:15.760
 what the hell is wrong with you kids?

1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:19.880
 You are the most creative and insightful people and you can't figure out how to

1:52:19.880 --> 1:52:22.240
 defend Aaron Schwartz. That's on you guys.

1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:25.840
 So some of that is giving more power to the young, like you said,

1:52:25.880 --> 1:52:30.200
 no, it's taking power from taking power from the feeble and the middle

1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.920
 Brown. Yeah. But how do you, what is the mechanism to me?

1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:37.280
 I don't know. You, you have some nine volt batteries, copper wire.

1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:41.480
 I, uh, I tend to, do you have a capacitor?

1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:46.400
 I tend to believe you have to create an alternative and, uh,

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:51.400
 make the alternative so much better that it makes MIT obsolete unless

1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:56.280
 they change. And that's what forces change. So as opposed to somehow,

1:52:56.280 --> 1:53:00.000
 okay, so use projection mapping, what's projection mapping,

1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:04.200
 where you take some complicated edifice and you map all of its planes.

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:07.160
 And then you actually project some unbelievable graphics,

1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:10.120
 re skinning a building, let's say at night. That's right. Yeah. Okay.

1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:13.560
 So you want to do some graffiti art with like basically want to hack the system.

1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:17.840
 No, I'm saying, look, listen to me. Yeah. We're smarter than they are.

1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:21.240
 And they, you know what they say? They say things like,

1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:25.520
 okay, I think we need some geeks. Get me two PhDs.

1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:30.360
 Right. You treat PhDs like that. That's a bad move.

1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:35.800
 Because PhDs are capable and we act like our job is to peel

1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:37.280
 grapes for our betters.

1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:39.120
 Yeah. That's a strange thing. And I,

1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:43.800
 I you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat basically

1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:48.520
 the greatest minds in the world, which is like at their prime,

1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:52.840
 which is PhD students like that. We pay them nothing.

1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:57.880
 Uh, I'm done with it. Yeah. Right. We got to take what's ours.

1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:03.040
 So, so take back MIT, become ungovernable,

1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:08.920
 become ungovernable. And by the way, when you become ungovernable,

1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:10.640
 don't do it by throwing food.

1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:15.360
 Don't do it by pouring salt on the lawn, like a jerk,

1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:19.720
 do it through brilliance, because what you Caltech and MIT can do,

1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:23.760
 and maybe Rensselaer Polytechnic or Worcester Polytech, I don't know.

1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:27.440
 Lehigh. God damn it. What's wrong with you technical people?

1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:29.520
 You act like you're a servant class.

1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:33.800
 It's unclear to me how you reclaim it except with brilliance,

1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:35.240
 like you said. Uh,

1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:39.000
 but to me that the way you reclaim it with brilliance is to go outside the

1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:39.440
 system.

1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:42.200
 Aaron Schwartz came from the Elon Musk class.

1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:44.920
 What are you guys going to do about it? Right.

1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:49.920
 The super capable people need to flex,

1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:53.080
 need to be individual. They need to stop giving away all their power to,

1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:56.800
 you know, a zeitgeist or a community or this or that you're not,

1:54:56.840 --> 1:54:59.760
 you're not indoor cats. You're outdoor cats. Go be outdoor cats.

1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:03.400
 Do you think we're going to see this, this kind of one asking me, you know,

1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:06.200
 before, like what about the world war II generation? Right.

1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:06.400
 Oh,

1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:10.520
 and I'm trying to say is that there's a technical revolt coming here's you want

1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:13.360
 to talk about it, but I'm trying to lead it. I'm trying to see,

1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.680
 no, you're not trying to lead it. I'm trying to get a blueprint here.

1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:16.720
 All right, Lex. Yeah.

1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:22.120
 How angry are you about our country pretending that you and I can't actually do

1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:25.480
 technical subjects so that they need an army of, uh,

1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.640
 kids coming in from four countries in Asia.

1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:32.080
 It's not about the four countries in Asia. It's not about those kids.

1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:35.840
 It's about lying about us that we don't care enough about science and

1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:40.840
 technology that we're incapable of it as if we don't have Chinese and Russians

1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:45.640
 and Russians and Koreans and Croatians. Like we've got everybody here.

1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:48.600
 The only reason you're looking outside is,

1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:52.160
 is that you want to hire cheap people from the family business because you don't

1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:55.240
 want to pass the family business on. And you know what?

1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:59.840
 You didn't really build the family business. It's not yours to decide.

1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:03.720
 You the boomers and you the silent generation, you did your bit,

1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:07.600
 but you also fouled a lot of stuff up and you're custodians.

1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:11.200
 You are caretakers. You were supposed to hand something.

1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:16.240
 What you did instead was to gorge yourself on cheap foreign labor,

1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:20.360
 which you then held up as being much more brilliant than your own children,

1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:21.400
 which was never true.

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:25.760
 But I'm trying to understand how we create a better system without anger,

1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:28.680
 without revolution, not, not,

1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:31.960
 not by kissing and hugs and, and,

1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:35.000
 but by any,

1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.280
 I don't understand within MIT what the mechanism of building a better MIT is.

1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:42.840
 We're not going to pay Elsevier. Aaron Schwartz was right.

1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.240
 JSTOR is an abomination.

1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:50.080
 But why, who within MIT, who within institutions is going to do that?

1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:51.920
 When just like you said,

1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:54.480
 the people who are running the show are more senior.

1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:57.080
 I don't know, get Frank Wilczek to speak out.

1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:01.040
 So you're, it's basically individuals that step up. I mean,

1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:05.920
 one of the surprising things about Elon is that one person can inspire so

1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:06.560
 much.

1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:09.240
 He's got academic freedom. It just comes from money.

1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:15.160
 I don't agree with that. That you think money. Okay.

1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:19.160
 So yes, certainly. Sorry.

1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:20.800
 And testicles. Yes.

1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:25.120
 I think that testicles are more important than money or guts.

1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:27.240
 I think I do agree with you.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:30.960
 You speak about this a lot that because the money in academic institutions

1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:35.760
 has been so constrained that people are misbehaving and horrible.

1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:36.440
 Yes.

1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:40.960
 But I don't think that if we reverse that and give a huge amount of money,

1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:43.720
 people will all of a sudden behave well. I think it also takes guts.

1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:46.600
 No, you need to give people security. Security. Yes.

1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:51.360
 Like you need to know that you have a job on Monday when on

1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:55.560
 Friday you say, I'm not so sure I really love diversity and inclusion.

1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:59.320
 And somebody is like, wait, what? You didn't love diversity?

1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:01.840
 We had a statement on diversity and you wouldn't sign.

1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:05.000
 Are you against the inclusion part or are you against diverse?

1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:06.640
 Do you just not like people like you?

1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:09.920
 Like actually that has nothing to do with anything.

1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:11.920
 You're making this into something that it isn't.

1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:15.640
 I don't want to sign your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab,

1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:19.800
 right? Get out of my lab. It all begins from the middle finger.

1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:24.720
 Get out of my lab. The administrators need to find other

1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:25.560
 work.

1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:30.880
 Yeah. Listen, I agree with you and I hope to seek your advice

1:58:30.880 --> 1:58:35.760
 and wisdom as we change this, because I'd love to see...

1:58:35.760 --> 1:58:38.240
 I will visit you in prison if that's what you're asking.

1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:41.840
 I have no... I think prison is great.

1:58:41.840 --> 1:58:45.800
 You get a lot of reading done and good working out.

1:58:45.800 --> 1:58:52.040
 Well, let me ask something I brought up before is the Nietzsche quote

1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:56.640
 of beware that when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster.

1:58:56.640 --> 1:59:01.000
 For when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:05.240
 Are you worried that your focus on the flaws in the system

1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:09.280
 that we've just been talking about has damaged your mind

1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:13.360
 or the part of your mind that's able to see the beauty in the world

1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:20.440
 in the system that because you have so sharply been able to see

1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:25.840
 the flaws in the system, you can no longer step back and appreciate its beauty?

1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:31.160
 Look, I'm the one who's trying to get the institutions to save themselves

1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:34.560
 by getting rid of their inhabitants, but leaving the institution

1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:40.800
 like a neutron bomb that removes the unworkable leadership class,

1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:42.400
 but leaves the structures.

1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:45.240
 So the leadership class is really the problem.

1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:46.680
 The leadership class is the problem.

1:59:46.680 --> 1:59:48.760
 But the individual, like the professors, the individual scholars...

1:59:48.760 --> 1:59:52.120
 No, the professors are going to have to go back into training

1:59:52.120 --> 1:59:54.760
 to remember how to be professors.

1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:58.000
 Like people are cowards at the moment because if they're not cowards,

1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.240
 they're unemployed.

2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:06.520
 Yeah, that's one of the disappointing things I've encountered is to me, tenure...

2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:10.520
 But nobody has tenure now.

2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:19.200
 Whether they do or not, they certainly don't have the kind of character

2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:22.880
 and fortitude that I was hoping to see.

2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:25.400
 But they'd be gone.

2:00:25.400 --> 2:00:33.120
 See, you're dreaming about the people who used to live at MIT.

2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:37.200
 You're dreaming about the previous inhabitants of your university.

2:00:37.200 --> 2:00:42.080
 And if you looked at somebody like, you know, Isidore Singer is very old.

2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:46.560
 I don't know what state he's in, but that guy was absolutely the real deal.

2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:51.600
 And if you look at Noam Chomsky, tell me that Noam Chomsky has been muzzled.

2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:52.120
 Right?

2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:53.080
 Yeah.

2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:58.120
 Now, what I'm trying to get at is you're talking about younger energetic people,

2:00:58.120 --> 2:00:59.040
 but those people...

2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:02.440
 Like when I say something like, I'm against...

2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:09.880
 I'm for inclusion and I'm for diversity, but I'm against diversity and inclusion TM,

2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:12.400
 like the movement.

2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:16.360
 Well, I couldn't say that if I was a professor.

2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:18.840
 Oh my God, he's against our sacred document.

2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:19.240
 Okay.

2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:24.480
 Well, in that kind of a world, do you want to know how many things I don't agree with you on?

2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:30.840
 Like we could go on for days and days and days, all the nonsense that you've parroted inside of the institution.

2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:33.280
 Any sane person like has no need for it.

2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:37.560
 They have no want or desire.

2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:44.240
 Do you think you have to have some patience for nonsense when many people work together in a system?

2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:45.920
 How long has string theory gone on for?

2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:48.200
 And how long have I been patient?

2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:48.400
 Okay.

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:49.040
 So you're talking about...

2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:50.280
 There's a limit to patience.

2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:54.960
 You're talking about like 36 years of modern nonsense and string theory.

2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:57.800
 So you can do like eight to 10 years, but not more.

2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:01.440
 I can do 40 minutes.

2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:02.200
 This is 36 years.

2:02:02.200 --> 2:02:03.880
 Well, you've done that over two hours already.

2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:05.320
 No, but I appreciate it.

2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:11.000
 But it's been 36 years of nonsense since the anomaly cancellation in string theory.

2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.800
 It's like, what are you talking about about patience?

2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:18.680
 I mean, Lex, you're not even acting like yourself.

2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:20.560
 You're trying to stay in the system.

2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:22.120
 I'm not trying...

2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:29.640
 I'm trying to see if perhaps... So my hope is that the system just has a few assholes in it,

2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:35.640
 which you highlight, and the fundamentals of the system are broken.

2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:42.840
 Because if the fundamentals of the systems are broken, then I just don't see a way for MIT to succeed.

2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:47.320
 Like, I don't see how young people take over MIT.

2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:49.960
 I don't see how...

2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:52.440
 By inspiring us.

2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:59.160
 You know, the great part about being at MIT, like when you saw the genius in these pranks,

2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:03.320
 the heart, the irreverence, it's like, don't...

2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:05.640
 We were talking about Tom Lehrer the last time.

2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:08.560
 Tom Lehrer was as naughty as the day is long.

2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:09.280
 Agreed?

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:10.160
 Agreed.

2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:11.680
 Was he also a genius?

2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:12.680
 Was he well spoken?

2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:14.840
 Was he highly cultured?

2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:19.040
 He was so talented, so intellectual that he could just make fart jokes morning,

2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:20.280
 noon and night.

2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:21.280
 Okay.

2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:26.280
 Well, in part, the right to make fart jokes, the right to, for example, put a functioning

2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:31.520
 phone booth that was ringing on top of the great dome at MIT has to do with we are such

2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:34.760
 bad asses that we can actually do this stuff.

2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:36.640
 Well, don't tell me about it anymore.

2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:38.640
 Go break the law.

2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:43.600
 Go break the law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute you.

2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:48.040
 Break the law in a way that lets us know that you're calling us out on our bullshit, that

2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:56.480
 you're filled with love, and that our technical talent has not gone to sleep, it's not incapable.

2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:00.800
 And if the idea is that you're going to dig a moat around the university and fill it with

2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:06.120
 tiger sharks, that's awesome because I don't know how you're going to do it.

2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.800
 But if you actually manage to do that, I'm not going to prosecute you under a reckless

2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:13.320
 endangerment.

2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:15.000
 That's beautifully put.

2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.760
 I hope those, first of all, they'll listen, I hope young people at MIT will take over

2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:22.160
 in this kind of way.

2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:29.780
 In the introduction to your podcast episode on Jeffrey Epstein, you give to me a really

2:04:29.780 --> 2:04:37.020
 moving story, but unfortunately for me, too brief, about your experience with a therapist

2:04:37.020 --> 2:04:40.440
 and a lasting terror that permeated your mind.

2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:45.160
 Can you go there, can you tell?

2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:46.160
 I don't think so.

2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:47.720
 I mean, I appreciate what you're saying.

2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:51.920
 I said it obliquely, I said enough.

2:04:51.920 --> 2:05:00.280
 There are bad people who cross our paths and the current vogue is to say, oh, I'm a survivor,

2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:05.660
 I'm a victim, I can do anything I want.

2:05:05.660 --> 2:05:11.200
 This is a broken person and I don't know why I was sent to a broken person as a kid.

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:15.520
 And to be honest with you, I also felt like in that story, I say that I was able to say

2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:23.440
 no and this was like the entire weight of authority and he was misusing his position

2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:28.160
 and I was also able to say no.

2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:32.680
 What I couldn't say no to was having him re inflicted in my life.

2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:36.160
 Right, so you were sent back a second time.

2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:42.040
 I tried to complain about what had happened and I tried to do it in a way that did not

2:05:42.040 --> 2:05:48.440
 immediately cause horrific consequences to both this person and myself because we don't

2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:55.400
 have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior.

2:05:55.400 --> 2:06:01.840
 We have nuclear weapons, we don't have any way of saying this is probably not a good

2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:07.760
 place or a role for you at this moment as an authority figure and something needs to

2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:08.800
 be worked on.

2:06:08.800 --> 2:06:15.960
 So in general, when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that way, our immediate instinct

2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:23.040
 is to treat the person as Satan and we understand why.

2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:28.080
 We don't want our children to be at risk.

2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:33.480
 Now I personally believe that I fell down on the job and did not call out the Jeffrey

2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:38.240
 Epstein thing early enough because I was terrified of what Jeffrey Epstein represents and this

2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:45.200
 recapitulated the old terror trying to tell the world this therapist is out of control.

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:50.040
 And when I said that, the world responded by saying, well, you have two appointments

2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:52.520
 booked and you have to go for the second one.

2:06:52.520 --> 2:06:57.640
 So I got re inflicted into this office on this person who was now convinced that I was

2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:01.160
 about to tear down his career and his reputation and might have been on the verge of suicide

2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:02.160
 for all I know.

2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:03.160
 I don't know.

2:07:03.160 --> 2:07:08.400
 But he was very, very angry and he was furious with me that I had breached a sacred confidence

2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:11.200
 of his office.

2:07:11.200 --> 2:07:13.600
 What kind of ripple effects does that have?

2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:16.400
 Has that had to the rest of your life?

2:07:16.400 --> 2:07:19.480
 The absurdity and the cruelty of that?

2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:22.560
 I mean, there's no sense to it.

2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:30.240
 Well, see, this is the thing people don't really grasp, I think there's an academic

2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:39.200
 who I got to know many years ago, um, named Jennifer fried, who has a theory of betrayal,

2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:41.400
 which she calls institutional betrayal.

2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:47.320
 And her gambit is, is that when you were betrayed by an institution that is sort of like a fiduciary

2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:54.760
 or a parental obligation to take care of you, that you find yourself in a far different

2:07:54.760 --> 2:08:02.480
 situation with respect to trauma than if you were betrayed by somebody who's a peer.

2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:12.880
 And so I think that my, in my situation, um, I kind of repeat a particular dynamic with

2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:13.880
 authority.

2:08:13.880 --> 2:08:20.400
 I come in not following all the rules, trying to do some things, not trying to do others,

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:21.680
 blah, blah, blah.

2:08:21.680 --> 2:08:25.560
 And then I get into a weird relationship with authority.

2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:29.840
 And so I have more experience with what I would call institutional betrayal.

2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:38.200
 Now, the funny part about it is that when you don't have masks or PPE in a influenza

2:08:38.200 --> 2:08:45.520
 like pandemic and you missing ICU beds and ventilators, that is ubiquitous institutional

2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:46.920
 betrayal.

2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:53.200
 So I believe that in a weird way, I was very early, the idea of, and this is like the really

2:08:53.200 --> 2:09:01.080
 hard concept pervasive or otherwise universal institutional betrayal where all of the institutions

2:09:01.080 --> 2:09:06.940
 you can count on any hospital to not charge you properly for what their services are.

2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:11.480
 You can count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that will be maximally

2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:14.560
 beneficial to the people who take it.

2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:19.880
 You know that your financial professionals are not simply working in your best interest.

2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:25.280
 And that issue had to do with the way in which growth left our system.

2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:30.560
 So I think that the weird thing is, is that this first institutional betrayal by a therapist

2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:34.620
 left me very open to the idea of, okay, well maybe the schools are bad.

2:09:34.620 --> 2:09:35.880
 Maybe the hospitals are bad.

2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:37.240
 Maybe the drug companies are bad.

2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:39.080
 Maybe our food is off.

2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:42.180
 Maybe our journalists are not serving journalistic ends.

2:09:42.180 --> 2:09:47.600
 And that was what allowed me to sort of go all the distance and say, huh, I wonder if

2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:54.260
 our problem is that something is causing all of our sensemaking institutions to be off.

2:09:54.260 --> 2:09:59.360
 That was the big insight and that tying that to a single ideology.

2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:00.680
 What if it's just about growth?

2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:05.600
 They were all built on growth and now we've promoted people who are capable of keeping

2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:08.720
 quiet that their institutions aren't working.

2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:15.300
 So we've, the privileged silent aristocracy, the people who can be counted upon, not to

2:10:15.300 --> 2:10:20.680
 mention a fire when a raging fire is tearing through a building.

2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:25.280
 But nevertheless, it's how big of a psychological burden is that?

2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:26.560
 It's huge.

2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:27.560
 It's terrible.

2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:28.560
 It's crushing.

2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:34.280
 It's very, it's very comforting to be the parental, I mean, I don't know.

2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:38.480
 I treasure, I mean, we were just talking about MIT.

2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:42.600
 We can, until I can intellectualize and agree with everything you're saying, but there's

2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:49.680
 a comfort, a warm blanket of being within the institution and up until Aaron Schwartz,

2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:54.880
 let's say, in other words, now, if I look at the provost and the president as mommy

2:10:54.880 --> 2:11:00.580
 and daddy, you did what to my big brother?

2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:03.540
 You did what to our family?

2:11:03.540 --> 2:11:06.860
 You sold us out in which way?

2:11:06.860 --> 2:11:09.000
 What secrets left for China?

2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:10.800
 You hired which workforce?

2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:13.180
 You did what to my wages?

2:11:13.180 --> 2:11:15.700
 You took this portion of my grant for what purpose?

2:11:15.700 --> 2:11:18.560
 You just stole my retirement through a fringe rate.

2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:19.820
 What did you do?

2:11:19.820 --> 2:11:26.760
 But can you still, I mean, the thing is about this view you have is it often turns out to

2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:27.760
 be sadly correct.

2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:29.880
 Well, this is the thing.

2:11:29.880 --> 2:11:37.000
 But let me just, in this silly, hopeful thing, do you still have hope in institutions?

2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:42.560
 Can you within your, psychologically, I'm referring not intellectually, because you

2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:47.480
 have to carry this burden, can you still have a hope within you?

2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:53.320
 When you sit at home alone and as opposed to seeing the darkness within these institutions,

2:11:53.320 --> 2:11:54.320
 seeing a hope.

2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:55.760
 Well, but this is the thing.

2:11:55.760 --> 2:12:02.240
 I want to confront, not for the purpose of a dust up.

2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:09.000
 I believe, for example, if you've heard episode 19, that the best outcome is for Carol Greider

2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:17.760
 to come forward, as we discussed in episode 19, and say, you know what, I screwed up.

2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:18.760
 He did call.

2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:20.920
 He did suggest the experiment.

2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:24.380
 I didn't understand that it was his theory that was producing it.

2:12:24.380 --> 2:12:27.480
 I was slow to grasp it.

2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:30.120
 But my bad.

2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:38.480
 And I don't want to pay for this bad choice on my part, let's say.

2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:44.000
 For the rest of my career, I want to own up, and I want to help make sure that we do what's

2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:45.280
 right with what's left.

2:12:45.280 --> 2:12:48.680
 And that's one little case within the institution that you would like to see made.

2:12:48.680 --> 2:12:54.560
 I would like to see MIT very clearly come out and say, Margot O'Toole was right when

2:12:54.560 --> 2:13:02.920
 she said David Baltimore's lab here produced some stuff that was not reproducible with

2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:05.600
 Teresa Imanishi Kari's research.

2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:08.760
 I want to see the courageous people.

2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:14.600
 I would like to see the Aaron Schwartz wing of the computer science department.

2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:17.640
 Yeah, wouldn't, no, let's think about it.

2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:22.200
 Wouldn't that be great if we said, you know, an injustice was done and we're going to write

2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:26.660
 that wrong just as if this was Alan Turing?

2:13:26.660 --> 2:13:28.940
 Which I don't think they've righted that wrong.

2:13:28.940 --> 2:13:33.160
 Well then let's have the Turing Schwartz wing.

2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:34.920
 They're starting a new college of computing.

2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:37.280
 It wouldn't be wonderful to call it the Turing Schwartz wing.

2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:41.080
 I would like to have the Madame Wu wing of the physics department.

2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.480
 And I'd love to have the Emmy Nerder statue in front of the math department.

2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:48.920
 I mean, like you want to get excited about actual diversity and inclusion?

2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:49.920
 Yeah.

2:13:49.920 --> 2:13:53.880
 Well, let's go with our absolute best people who never got theirs because there is structural

2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:56.100
 bigotry, you know?

2:13:56.100 --> 2:14:00.800
 But if we don't actually start celebrating the beautiful stuff that we're capable of

2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:05.320
 when we're handed heroes and we fumble them into the trash, what the hell?

2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:10.280
 I mean, Lex, this is such nonsense.

2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:16.080
 We just pulling our head out.

2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:25.840
 You know, on everyone's cecum should be tattooed, if you can read this, you're too close.

2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:30.680
 Beautifully put and I'm a dreamer just like you.

2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:38.820
 So I don't see as much of the darkness genetically or due to my life experience, but I do share

2:14:38.820 --> 2:14:39.820
 the hope.

2:14:39.820 --> 2:14:42.640
 From my teeth, the institution that we care a lot about.

2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:43.640
 You both do.

2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:44.640
 Yeah.

2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:48.040
 And a Harvard institution I don't give a damn about, but you do.

2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:49.040
 So I love Harvard.

2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:50.040
 I'm just kidding.

2:14:50.040 --> 2:14:53.520
 I love Harvard, but Harvard and I have a very difficult relationship.

2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:58.400
 And part of what, you know, when you love a family that isn't working, I don't want

2:14:58.400 --> 2:14:59.400
 to trash.

2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:05.080
 I didn't bring up the name of the president of MIT during the Aaron Schwartz period.

2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:06.600
 It's not vengeance.

2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:09.000
 I want the rot cleared out.

2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.840
 I don't need to go after human beings.

2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:12.840
 Yeah.

2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:19.080
 Just like you said with the, with the disc formulation, the individual human beings aren't

2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:22.960
 don't necessarily carry them.

2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:26.640
 It's those chairs that are so powerful that in which they sit.

2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:34.240
 It's the chairs, not the humans, not the humans without naming names.

2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:41.140
 Can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at Harvard, maybe in a way that

2:15:41.140 --> 2:15:47.440
 tells the bigger story of the struggle of young bright minds that are trying to come

2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:54.360
 up with big, bold ideas within the institutions that we're talking about?

2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:55.360
 You can start.

2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:06.520
 I mean, in part, uh, it starts with, uh, coffee with, uh, a couple, uh, of Croatians in the

2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:09.680
 math department at MIT.

2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:17.560
 And, um, we used to talk about, um, music and dance and math and physics and love and

2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:24.960
 all this kind of stuff as Eastern Europeans, uh, love to, and I ate it up and my friend

2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:30.280
 Gordon, uh, who was, uh, an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduate

2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:36.440
 student at Harvard said to me, I'm probably gonna do a bad version of her accent, but

2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:37.440
 here we go.

2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:42.560
 It, um, will I see you tomorrow at the secret seminar?

2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:48.920
 And I said, w what secret seminar, Eric, don't joke.

2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:52.880
 I said, I'm not used to this style of humor.

2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:57.840
 Then she's Eric, the secret seminar that your advisor is running.

2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:00.960
 I said, what are you talking about?

2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:06.120
 Ha ha ha, uh, you know, your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect.

2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:09.240
 I think it was like the churn Simon's invariant.

2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:14.960
 I'm not sure what the topic was again, but she gave me the room number and the time and

2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:16.760
 she was like not cracking a smile.

2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:18.840
 I've never known her to make this kind of a joke.

2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:22.080
 And I thought this was crazy and I was trying to have an advisor.

2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:24.480
 I didn't want an advisor, but people said you have to have one.

2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:32.160
 So I took one and I went to this room at like 15 minutes early and there was not a soul

2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:33.160
 inside it.

2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:38.960
 It was outside of the math department and it was still in the same building, the science

2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:41.260
 center at Harvard.

2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:45.440
 And I sat there and I let five minutes go by, I let seven minutes go by, 10 minutes

2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:46.440
 go by.

2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:47.440
 There's nobody.

2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:50.680
 I thought, okay, so this was all an elaborate joke.

2:17:50.680 --> 2:17:56.720
 And then like three minutes to the hour, this graduate student walks in and like sees me

2:17:56.720 --> 2:17:58.660
 and does a double take.

2:17:58.660 --> 2:18:05.760
 And then I start to see the professors in geometry and topology start to file in and

2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:11.120
 everybody's like very disconcerted that I'm in this room.

2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:18.440
 And finally the person who was supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and

2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:22.880
 sees me and goes white as a ghost.

2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:30.480
 And I realized that the secret seminar is true, that the department is conducting a

2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:36.120
 secret seminar on the exact topic that I'm interested in, not telling me about it.

2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:41.440
 And that these are the reindeer games that the Rudolph's of the department are not invited

2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:42.880
 to.

2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:45.840
 And so then I realized, okay, I did not understand it.

2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:49.600
 There's a parallel department.

2:18:49.600 --> 2:19:00.680
 And that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which I came to understand that

2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:12.360
 the game that I had been sold about publication, about blind refereeing, about openness and

2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:18.240
 scientific transmission of information was all a lie.

2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:24.640
 I came to understand that at the very top, there's a second system that's about closed

2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:33.760
 meetings and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest

2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:36.040
 of us don't understand.

2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:41.040
 And that in large measure, that is the thing that I won't submit to.

2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:45.240
 And so when you ask me questions like, well, why wouldn't you feel good about, you know,

2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:49.200
 talking to your critics or why wouldn't you feel the answer is, oh, you don't know.

2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:54.560
 Like if you stay in a nice hotel, you don't realize that there is an entire second structure

2:19:54.560 --> 2:20:01.580
 inside of that hotel where like there's usually a worker's cafe in a resort complex that isn't

2:20:01.580 --> 2:20:03.920
 available to the people who are staying in the hotel.

2:20:03.920 --> 2:20:11.960
 And then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are parallel structures.

2:20:11.960 --> 2:20:16.560
 So that's what I found, which was in essence, just the way you can stay hotels your whole

2:20:16.560 --> 2:20:20.920
 life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're not

2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:23.200
 supposed to see as the guest.

2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:28.600
 There is a second structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respect

2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:33.820
 to how people get dinged, how people get their grants taken away, how this person comes to

2:20:33.820 --> 2:20:37.640
 have that thing named after them.

2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:44.880
 And by pretending that we're not running a parallel structure, um, I have no patience

2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:45.880
 for that anymore.

2:20:45.880 --> 2:20:52.400
 So I got a chance to see how the game, how hard ball is really played at Harvard.

2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:59.080
 And I'm now eager to play hard ball back with the same people who played hard ball with

2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:00.080
 me.

2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:02.640
 Let me ask two questions on this.

2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:10.600
 So one, do you think it's possible, so I call those people assholes, that's the technical

2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:11.600
 term.

2:21:11.600 --> 2:21:18.040
 Do you think it's possible that that's just not the entire system, but a part of the system?

2:21:18.040 --> 2:21:23.840
 Sort of that there's, you can navigate, you can swim in the waters and find the groups

2:21:23.840 --> 2:21:26.640
 of people who do aspire to the openness.

2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:33.680
 The guy who rescued my phd was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar.

2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:35.600
 Right.

2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:38.200
 But are there people outside of this, right?

2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:39.200
 Is he an asshole?

2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:44.600
 Well, yes, I was, it was a bad, no, but I'm trying to make this point, which is this isn't

2:21:44.600 --> 2:21:48.120
 my failure to correctly map these people.

2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:49.120
 It's yours.

2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:53.200
 You, you have a simplification that isn't going to work.

2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:54.200
 I think, okay.

2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:59.800
 If I asked what was the wrong term, I would say lacking of character and what would you

2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:02.600
 have had these people do?

2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:03.700
 Why did they do this?

2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:06.120
 Why have a secret seminar?

2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:09.880
 I don't understand the exact dynamics of a secret seminar, but I think the right thing

2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:15.800
 to do is to, I mean, to see individuals like you, there might be a reason to have a secret

2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:23.160
 seminar, but they should detect that an individual like you, a brilliant mind who's thinking

2:22:23.160 --> 2:22:25.400
 about certain ideas could be damaged by this.

2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:27.860
 I don't think that they see it that way.

2:22:27.860 --> 2:22:32.480
 The idea is we're going to sneak food to the children we want to survive.

2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:33.480
 Yeah.

2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:36.800
 So that that's highly problematic and there should be people within that room.

2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:41.800
 I'm trying to say this is the thing, the ball that can't is thrown, but won't be caught.

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:50.560
 The problem is they know that most of their children won't survive and they can't say

2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:51.560
 that.

2:22:51.560 --> 2:22:52.560
 I see.

2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:54.560
 Sorry to interrupt.

2:22:54.560 --> 2:23:00.440
 You mean that the fact that the whole system is underfunded, that they naturally have to

2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:02.240
 pick favorites.

2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:08.440
 They live in a world which reached steady state at some level, let's say, you know,

2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:16.640
 in the early seventies and in that world before that time you have a professor like Norman

2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:20.980
 Steenrod and you'd have 20 children that is graduate students and all of them would go

2:23:20.980 --> 2:23:25.000
 on to be professors and all of them would want to have 20 children, right?

2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:30.680
 So you start like taking higher and higher powers of 20 and you see that the system could

2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:34.580
 not, it's not just about money, the system couldn't survive.

2:23:34.580 --> 2:23:41.040
 So the way it's supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhD

2:23:41.040 --> 2:23:49.040
 programs and we should let the small number of truly top places populate, um, mostly teaching

2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:53.040
 and research departments that aren't PhD producing.

2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:56.720
 We don't want to do that because we use PhD students as a labor force.

2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:04.480
 So the whole thing has to do with growth, resources, dishonesty, and in that world you

2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:10.040
 see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world where the key question is where are

2:24:10.040 --> 2:24:14.640
 we going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out?

2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:18.620
 So my problem was I wasn't interested in dying.

2:24:18.620 --> 2:24:26.440
 So you clearly highlight that there's aspects of the system that are broken, but as an individual,

2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:32.640
 is your role to, uh, exit the system or just acknowledge that it's a game and win it?

2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:37.560
 My role is to survive and thrive in the public eye.

2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:45.520
 In other words, when you have an escapee of the system, like yourself, such as, and that

2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:50.440
 person says, you know, I wasn't exactly finished, let me show you a bunch of stuff.

2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:55.560
 Let me show you that, uh, the theory of telomeres never got reported properly.

2:24:55.560 --> 2:25:00.920
 Let me show you that all of, uh, marginal economics, uh, is supposed to be redone with

2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:03.040
 a different version of the differential calculus.

2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:07.400
 Let me show you that you didn't understand the self dual Yang Mills equations correctly

2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:15.360
 in topology and physics because they're in fact, uh, much more broadly found and it's

2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:17.840
 only the mutations that happen in special dimensions.

2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:24.400
 There are lots of things to say, but this particular group of people, like if you just

2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:30.240
 take, where are all the gen X and millennial university presidents?

2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:31.240
 Right.

2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:32.240
 Okay.

2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:36.320
 They're all, they're all in a holding pattern.

2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:42.040
 Now where, why in this story, you know, was it of telomeres?

2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:45.520
 Was it an older professor and a younger graduate student?

2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:50.060
 It's this issue of what would be called interference competition.

2:25:50.060 --> 2:25:55.520
 So for example, orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blow holes so that they

2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:58.960
 suffocate because the needed resource is air.

2:25:58.960 --> 2:25:59.960
 Okay.

2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:01.660
 Well, what do the universities do?

2:26:01.660 --> 2:26:08.160
 They try to make sure that you can't be viable, that you need them, that you need their grants.

2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:15.440
 You need to be, uh, zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the

2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:17.200
 locals love to play.

2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:20.640
 Well, my point is, okay, what's the cost of this?

2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:25.880
 How many people died as a result of these interference competition games?

2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:30.120
 You know, when you take somebody like Douglas Prasher who did green fluorescent protein

2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:32.160
 and he drives a shuttle bus, right?

2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:36.280
 Cause he, his grant runs out and he has to give away all of his research and all of that

2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:40.920
 research gets a Nobel prize and he gets to drive a shuttle bus for $35,000 a year.

2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:41.920
 What do you mean by died?

2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:43.920
 You mean their career, their dreams, their passions?

2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:49.760
 Yeah, the whole, as an academic, Doug Prasher was dead for a long period of time.

2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:51.400
 Okay.

2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:58.560
 So as a, as a person who's escaped the system, can't you at this, cause you also have in

2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:05.040
 your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be a useful, maybe not.

2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:09.840
 So can't you also play the game enough?

2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:16.640
 Like with the children, so like publish and, but also if you told me that this would work,

2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:23.960
 really what I want to do, you see, is I would love to revolutionize a field with an H index

2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:31.700
 of zero, like we have these proxies that count how many papers you've written, how cited

2:27:31.700 --> 2:27:34.160
 are the papers you've written.

2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:35.160
 All of this is nonsense.

2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:36.160
 That's interesting.

2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:37.160
 Sorry.

2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:40.240
 What do you mean by field with an H index as your, so a totally new field.

2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:42.200
 H index is count somehow.

2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:46.320
 How many papers have you gotten that get so many citations?

2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:56.160
 Let's say H index undefined, like for example, um, I don't have an advisor for my PhD, but

2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:01.400
 I have to have an advisor as far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks

2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:07.160
 who advised who, who advised whom down the line.

2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:10.600
 So I am my own advisor, which sets up a loop, right?

2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:11.600
 How many students do I have?

2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:12.600
 An infinite number.

2:28:12.600 --> 2:28:16.940
 Um, your descendants, they don't want to have that story.

2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:21.920
 So I have to be, I have to have formal advisor, Raul bought, and my Wikipedia entry, for example,

2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:25.760
 says that I was advised by Raul bought, which is not true.

2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:31.000
 So you get fit into a system that says, well, we have to know what your H index is.

2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:34.520
 We have to know, um, you know, where are you a professor?

2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:38.040
 If you want to apply for a grant, it makes all of these assumptions.

2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:41.960
 What I'm trying to do is in part to show all of this is nonsense.

2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:45.760
 This is proxy BS that came up in the institutional setting.

2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:50.400
 And right now it's important for those of us who are still vital, like Elon, it would

2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:53.640
 be great to have Elon as a professor of physics and engineering.

2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:54.640
 Yeah.

2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:55.640
 Right.

2:28:55.640 --> 2:29:00.440
 It seems ridiculous to say, but just as a shot, just as a shot in the arm.

2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:01.440
 Yeah.

2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:07.120
 You know, like it'd be great to have Elon at Caltech even one day a week, one day a

2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:08.120
 month.

2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:09.120
 Okay.

2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:10.920
 Well, why can't we be in there?

2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:11.920
 It's the same reason.

2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:13.440
 Well, why can't you be on the view?

2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:14.880
 Why can't you be on bill Martin?

2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:18.200
 We need to know what you're going to do before we take you on the show on the show.

2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:20.760
 Well, I don't want to tell you what I'm going to do.

2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:24.440
 Do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit?

2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:26.760
 I can dance the dance fun to be on the view.

2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:27.760
 Oh, come on.

2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:28.760
 So you can, yeah, you do.

2:29:28.760 --> 2:29:30.560
 You're not, I can do that.

2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:31.560
 Fine.

2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:37.320
 Here's where the place that it goes south is there like a set of questions that get

2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:39.880
 you into this more adversarial stuff.

2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:44.680
 And you've in fact asked some of those more adversarial questions, the setting, and they're

2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:49.200
 not things that are necessarily aggressive, but they're things that are making assumptions.

2:29:49.200 --> 2:29:50.200
 Right.

2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:51.200
 Right.

2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:57.120
 So when you make a, I have a question is like, you know, Lex, are you avoiding your critics?

2:29:57.120 --> 2:29:58.720
 You know, it's just like, okay, well why did you?

2:29:58.720 --> 2:29:59.720
 You frame that that way.

2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:04.480
 Or the next question would be like, um, do you think that you should have a special exemption

2:30:04.480 --> 2:30:07.400
 and that you should have the right to break rules and everyone else should have to follow

2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:08.400
 them?

2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:09.960
 Like that question I find innervating.

2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:10.960
 Yeah.

2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:12.400
 It doesn't really come out of anything meaningful.

2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:16.160
 It's just like we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other person to show that we're

2:30:16.160 --> 2:30:18.480
 not captured by their madness.

2:30:18.480 --> 2:30:20.120
 That's not the real question you want to ask me.

2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:24.480
 If you want to get really excited about this, you want to ask, do you think this thing is

2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:25.480
 right?

2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:26.480
 Yeah.

2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:27.480
 Weirdly I do.

2:30:27.480 --> 2:30:30.160
 Do you think that it's going to be immediately seen to be right?

2:30:30.160 --> 2:30:31.160
 I don't.

2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:34.280
 I think it's going to, it's going to have an interesting fight and it's going to have

2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:39.560
 an interesting evolution and well, what do you hope to do with it in nonphysical terms?

2:30:39.560 --> 2:30:47.240
 Gosh, I hope it revolutionizes our relationship of well with people outside of the institutional

2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:52.280
 framework and it re inflicts us into the institutional framework where we can do the most good to

2:30:52.280 --> 2:30:55.500
 bring the institutions back to health.

2:30:55.500 --> 2:31:00.480
 You know, it's like these are positive, uplifting questions and if you had Frank will check,

2:31:00.480 --> 2:31:05.240
 you wouldn't say, Frank, let's be honest, you have done very little with your life after

2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:10.160
 the original, a huge show that you used to break onto the physics scene.

2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:14.720
 Like we weirdly ask people different questions based upon how they sit down.

2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:15.720
 Yeah.

2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:16.720
 That's very strange, right?

2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:20.000
 But you have to understand that.

2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.000
 So here's the thing.

2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:27.440
 I get these days, a large number of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory

2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:39.920
 of everything for AGI and I use my own radar, BS radar to detect unfairly, perhaps whether

2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:48.680
 they're full of shit or not, because I love where you're going with this, by the way.

2:31:48.680 --> 2:31:54.400
 My concern I often think about is there's elements of brilliance in what people write

2:31:54.400 --> 2:32:01.900
 to me and I'm trying to right now, as you made it clear, the kind of judgments and assumptions

2:32:01.900 --> 2:32:08.440
 we make, how am I supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system and

2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:15.680
 think about what you're doing because my radar is saying you're not full of shit.

2:32:15.680 --> 2:32:18.260
 But I'm also not completely outside of the system.

2:32:18.260 --> 2:32:19.260
 That's right.

2:32:19.260 --> 2:32:20.620
 You've danced beautifully.

2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:26.080
 You've actually got all the credibility that you're supposed to get, all the nice little

2:32:26.080 --> 2:32:33.080
 stamps of approval, not all, but a large enough amount.

2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:41.560
 I mean, it's hard to put into words exactly why you sound, whether your theory turns out

2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:46.720
 to be good or not, you sound like a special human being.

2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:50.400
 I appreciate that and thank you in a good way.

2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:54.840
 So but what am I supposed to do with that flood of emails from AGI?

2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:56.640
 Why do I sound different?

2:32:56.640 --> 2:32:58.240
 I don't know.

2:32:58.240 --> 2:32:59.600
 And I would like to systemize that.

2:32:59.600 --> 2:33:01.480
 I don't know.

2:33:01.480 --> 2:33:09.420
 Look, you know, when you're talking to people, you very quickly can surmise, like, am I claiming

2:33:09.420 --> 2:33:10.420
 to be a physicist?

2:33:10.420 --> 2:33:11.600
 No, I say it every turn.

2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:14.840
 I'm not a physicist, right?

2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:17.720
 When I say to you, when you say something about bundles, you say, well, can you explain

2:33:17.720 --> 2:33:18.720
 it differently?

2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:25.080
 You know, I'm pushing around on this area, that lever over there.

2:33:25.080 --> 2:33:30.320
 I'm trying to find something that we can play with and engage.

2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:34.540
 And you know, another thing is that I'll say something at scale.

2:33:34.540 --> 2:33:38.840
 So if I was saying completely wrong things about bundles on the Joe Rogan program, you

2:33:38.840 --> 2:33:41.480
 don't think that we wouldn't hear a crushing chorus.

2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:42.480
 Yes.

2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:43.480
 Absolutely.

2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:45.400
 And you know, same thing with geometric unity.

2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:50.160
 So I put up this video from this Oxford lecture.

2:33:50.160 --> 2:33:56.840
 I understand that it's not a standard lecture, but you haven't heard, you know, the most

2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:00.960
 brilliant people in the field say, well, this is obviously nonsense.

2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:01.960
 They don't know what to make of it.

2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:06.720
 And they're going to hide behind, well, he hasn't said enough details.

2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:07.720
 Where's the paper?

2:34:07.720 --> 2:34:08.720
 Where's the paper?

2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:10.560
 I've seen the criticism.

2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:11.880
 I've gotten the same kind of criticism.

2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:19.120
 I've published a few things and like, especially stuff related to Tesla that we did studies

2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:24.480
 on Tesla vehicles and the kind of criticism I've gotten, which showed that they're completely.

2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:25.480
 Oh, right.

2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:29.720
 Like the guy who had Elon Musk on his program twice is going to give us an accurate assessment.

2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:30.720
 Next.

2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:31.720
 Exactly.

2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:32.720
 Exactly.

2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:33.720
 Exactly.

2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:34.720
 It's just very low level.

2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:40.480
 Like without actually ever addressing the content.

2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:44.840
 You know, Lex, I think that in part you're trying to solve a puzzle that isn't really

2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:45.840
 your puzzle.

2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:47.640
 I think, you know, that I'm sincere.

2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:50.820
 You don't know whether the theory is going to work or not.

2:34:50.820 --> 2:34:55.440
 And you know that it's not coming out of somebody who's coming out of left field, like the story

2:34:55.440 --> 2:34:56.440
 makes sense.

2:34:56.440 --> 2:35:01.880
 There's enough that's new and creative and different in other aspects where you can check

2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:08.120
 me that your real concern is, are you really telling me that when you start breaking the

2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:13.080
 rules, you see the system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive.

2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:18.240
 And the answer is yes, and I had to break the rules in part because of learning issues

2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:23.620
 because I came into this field, you know, with a totally different set of attributes.

2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:28.300
 My profile just doesn't look like anybody else's remotely, but as a result, what that

2:35:28.300 --> 2:35:34.080
 did is it showed me what is the system true to its own ideals or does it just follow these

2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:39.360
 weird procedures and then when it, when you take it off the rails, it behaves terribly.

2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:45.500
 And that's really what my story I think does is it just says, well, he completely takes

2:35:45.500 --> 2:35:49.960
 the system into new territory where it's not expecting to have to deal with somebody with

2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:52.400
 these confusing sets of attributes.

2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:56.440
 And I think what he's telling us is he believes it behaves terribly.

2:35:56.440 --> 2:36:04.320
 Now, if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests and you know, a winner of math competitions

2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:09.880
 and you put them in a PhD program, they're probably going to be okay.

2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:17.680
 I'm not saying that the system, um, you know, breaks down for any everybody under all circumstances.

2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:23.360
 I'm saying when you present the system with a novel situation at the moment, it will almost

2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:29.240
 certainly break down with probability approaching 100%.

2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:35.840
 But to me, the painful and the tragic thing is it, uh, sorry to bring out my motherly

2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:39.220
 instinct, but it feels like it's too much.

2:36:39.220 --> 2:36:44.280
 It could be too much of a burden to exist outside the system, maybe, but psychologically,

2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:51.760
 first of all, I've got a podcast that I kind of like and I've got amazing friends.

2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:55.840
 I have a life which has more interesting people passing through it than I know what to do

2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:56.840
 with.

2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:57.840
 Yeah.

2:36:57.840 --> 2:36:58.840
 And they haven't managed to kill me off yet.

2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:02.000
 So, so far, so good.

2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:06.400
 Speaking of which you host an amazing podcast that we've mentioned several times, but should

2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:13.440
 mention over and over the portal, uh, where you somehow manage every single conversation

2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:15.560
 is a surprise.

2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:22.080
 You go, I mean, not just the guests, but just the places you take them, uh, the, the kind

2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:25.280
 of ways they become challenging and how you recover from that.

2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:30.920
 I mean, it's, uh, there's just, it's full of genuine human moments.

2:37:30.920 --> 2:37:35.280
 So I really appreciate what you're, it's a fun, fun podcast to listen to.

2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:38.240
 Uh, let me ask some silly questions about it.

2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:43.480
 What have you learned about conversation about human to human conversation?

2:37:43.480 --> 2:37:50.040
 Well, I have a problem that I haven't solved on the portal, which is that in general, when

2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:56.760
 I ask people questions, they usually find their deeply grooved answers and I'm not so

2:37:56.760 --> 2:37:59.120
 interested in all of the deeply grooved answers.

2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:03.920
 And so there's a complaint, which I'm very sympathetic to actually that I talk over people

2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:05.400
 that I won't sit still for the answer.

2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:09.280
 And I think that that's weirdly sort of correct.

2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:12.680
 It's not that I'm not interested in hearing other voices.

2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:16.880
 That I'm not interested in hearing the same voice on my program that I could have gotten

2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:17.880
 on somebody else's.

2:38:17.880 --> 2:38:19.600
 And I haven't solved that well.

2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:25.200
 So I've learned that I need a new conversational technique where I can keep somebody from finding

2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:29.960
 their comfortable place and yet not be the voice talking over that person.

2:38:29.960 --> 2:38:30.960
 Yeah.

2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:31.960
 It's funny.

2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:36.440
 I can sense like your conversation with Brett, I can sense you detect that the line he's

2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:43.800
 going down, you know how it's going to end and you think it's a useless line, so you'll

2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:47.360
 just stop it right there and you take them into the direction that you think it should

2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:48.360
 go.

2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:49.360
 But that requires interruption.

2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:51.320
 Well, and it does so far.

2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:52.440
 I haven't found a better way.

2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:54.240
 I'm looking for a better way.

2:38:54.240 --> 2:38:57.020
 It's not like I don't hear the problem.

2:38:57.020 --> 2:38:59.280
 I do hear the problem.

2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:01.880
 I haven't solved the problem.

2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:06.680
 And you know, on the, on the bread episode, um, I was insufferable.

2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:08.640
 It was very difficult to listen to.

2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:10.520
 It was so overbearing.

2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:12.640
 But on the other hand, I was right.

2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:14.000
 You know, it's like funny.

2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:19.360
 You keep saying that, but I didn't find it maybe because I heard brothers, like I heard

2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:20.360
 a big brother.

2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:21.360
 Yeah.

2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:22.360
 It was pretty bad.

2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:23.360
 Really?

2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:24.360
 I think so.

2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:25.360
 I didn't think it was bad.

2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:26.440
 Well, a lot of people found it interesting.

2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:31.040
 And I think it also has to do with the fact that this has become a frequent experience.

2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:35.960
 I have several shows where somebody who I very much admire and think of as courageous,

2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:41.400
 um, you know, I'm talking with them, maybe we're friends and they sit down on the show

2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:44.560
 and they immediately become this fake person.

2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:49.200
 Like two seconds in there, they're sort of saying, well, I don't want to be too critical

2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:50.200
 or too harsh.

2:39:50.200 --> 2:39:51.200
 I don't want to name any names.

2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:52.200
 I wanted this story.

2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:57.440
 He was like, okay, I'm going to put my listeners through three hours of you being sweetness

2:39:57.440 --> 2:39:58.440
 and light.

2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:04.960
 Like at least give me some reality and then we can decide to shelve the show and never

2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:10.040
 let it hear, uh, you know, the, the, the call of freedom in the, in the bigger world.

2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:12.800
 But I've seen you break out of that a few times.

2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:18.000
 I've seen you to be successful that, uh, I forgot to guess, but she was dressed with,

2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:24.520
 um, um, you were at the end of the episode, you had an argument about Brett.

2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:25.520
 I forgot.

2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:26.520
 Agnes Callard.

2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:27.520
 Yeah.

2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:30.080
 She was one of the philosophers for at the university of Chicago.

2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:31.080
 Yeah.

2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:33.280
 You've continuously broken out of her.

2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:38.040
 Uh, you guys went, you know, uh, I didn't even seem pretty genuine.

2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:39.400
 I like her.

2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:42.720
 I'm completely ethically opposed to what she's ethically for.

2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:44.480
 Well, she was great.

2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:46.000
 And she wasn't like that.

2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:47.600
 You're both going hard.

2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:48.600
 She's a grownup.

2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:49.600
 Yeah.

2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:50.600
 And she knows that I care about her.

2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:51.600
 So that was awesome.

2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:52.600
 Yeah.

2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:55.520
 But you're saying that some people are difficult to break out.

2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:59.840
 Well, it's just that, you know, she was bringing the courage of her convictions.

2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:05.320
 She was sort of defending the system and I thought, wow, that's a pretty indefensible

2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:06.320
 system that you're doing.

2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:07.320
 That's great though.

2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:08.320
 She's doing that.

2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:09.320
 Isn't it?

2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:13.840
 I mean, it made for an awesome, it's very informative for the world.

2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:14.840
 Yes.

2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:15.840
 You just hated.

2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:19.720
 I just can't stand the idea that somebody says, well, we don't care who gets paid or

2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:21.920
 who gets the credit as long as we get the goodies.

2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:24.360
 Cause that seems like insane.

2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:30.760
 Have you ever been afraid leading into a conversation?

2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:31.760
 Gary Kasparov.

2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:39.920
 By the way, I mean, I know I'm just a fan taking requests, but I started, I started

2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:43.280
 the beginning in Russian and in fact I used one word incorrectly.

2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:44.280
 Is that terrible?

2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:46.240
 You know, it was, it was pretty good.

2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:47.240
 It's pretty good Russian.

2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:49.680
 What was terrible is I think he complimented you.

2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:50.680
 Right?

2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:51.680
 No.

2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:52.680
 Did he compliment you or was that me?

2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:54.600
 Did he compliment you on your Russian?

2:41:54.600 --> 2:41:57.040
 Well, he said almost perfect Russian.

2:41:57.040 --> 2:41:58.040
 Yeah.

2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:00.040
 Like he was full of shit.

2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:03.000
 That was not great Russian, but that was not great Russian.

2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:04.000
 That was great.

2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:05.000
 That was hard.

2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.280
 That was, you tried hard, which is what matters.

2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:08.280
 That is so insulting.

2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:10.160
 I hope so.

2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:12.160
 But I do hope you continue.

2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:13.960
 It felt like, I don't know how long it went.

2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:18.600
 It might've been like a two hour conversation, but it felt, I hope it continues.

2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:21.520
 Like I feel like you have many conversations with Gary.

2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:22.520
 Yeah.

2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:23.520
 I would love to hear.

2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:27.720
 There's certain conversations I would just love to hear a long, much longer.

2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:33.320
 He's coming from a very, it's this issue about needing to overpower people in a very dangerous

2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:34.320
 world.

2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:36.320
 And so Gary has that need.

2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:37.320
 Yeah.

2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:38.880
 He wasn't, he was interrupting you.

2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:39.880
 Sure.

2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:40.880
 It was an interesting dynamic.

2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:43.200
 It was a, it was an interesting dynamic.

2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:44.760
 Two Weinsteins going at you.

2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:47.760
 I mean, two powerhouse egos, brilliant.

2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:51.560
 No, don't say egos, minds, spirits.

2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:52.560
 You don't have an ego.

2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:54.200
 You're the most humble person I know.

2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:55.360
 Is that true?

2:42:55.360 --> 2:42:58.520
 No, that's a complete lie.

2:42:58.520 --> 2:43:01.320
 Do you think about your own mortality, death?

2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:02.320
 Sure.

2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:03.320
 Are you afraid?

2:43:03.320 --> 2:43:07.840
 Well, I released a theory during something that can kill older people.

2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:08.840
 Sure.

2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:12.640
 Oh, is there a little bit of a parallel there?

2:43:12.640 --> 2:43:13.640
 Of course.

2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:14.640
 Of course.

2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:16.860
 I don't want it to die with me.

2:43:16.860 --> 2:43:20.000
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:28.960
 Oh, I hope my legacy is accurate.

2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:33.520
 I'd like to write on my accomplishments rather than how my community decided to ding me while

2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:34.520
 I was alive.

2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:35.520
 That would be great.

2:43:35.520 --> 2:43:38.280
 What about if it was significantly exaggerated?

2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:39.820
 I don't want it.

2:43:39.820 --> 2:43:42.560
 You want it to be accurate.

2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:48.240
 I've got some pretty terrific stuff and whether it works out or doesn't that I would like

2:43:48.240 --> 2:43:52.920
 it to reflect what I actually was.

2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:56.600
 I'll settle for accurate.

2:43:56.600 --> 2:44:04.240
 What would you say, what is the greatest element of a Eric Weinstein accomplishment in life

2:44:04.240 --> 2:44:09.360
 in terms of being accurate?

2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:14.160
 What are you most proud of?

2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:27.160
 The idea that we were stalled out in the hardest field at the most difficult juncture and that

2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:36.120
 I didn't listen to that voice ever that said, stop, you're hurting yourself.

2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:37.120
 You're hurting your family.

2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:38.120
 You're hurting everybody.

2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:39.120
 You're embarrassing yourself.

2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:40.120
 You're screwing up.

2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:41.120
 You can't do this.

2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:42.120
 You're a failure.

2:44:42.120 --> 2:44:43.540
 You're a fraud.

2:44:43.540 --> 2:44:46.640
 Turn back, save yourself.

2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:58.800
 That voice, I didn't ultimately listen to it and it was going for 35, 37 years.

2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:02.400
 Very hard.

2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:05.440
 And I hope you never listen to that voice.

2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:07.680
 That's why you're an inspiration.

2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:08.680
 Thank you.

2:45:08.680 --> 2:45:09.680
 I appreciate that.

2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:15.680
 I'm just infinitely honored that you would spend time with me.

2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:21.200
 You've been a mentor to me, almost a friend.

2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:23.600
 I can't imagine a better person to talk to in this world.

2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:24.920
 So thank you so much for talking to me.

2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:26.520
 I can't wait till we do it again.

2:45:26.520 --> 2:45:32.280
 Lex, thanks for sticking with me and thanks for being the most singular guy in the podcasting

2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:33.280
 space.

2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:38.080
 In terms of all of my interviews, I would say that the last one I did with you, many

2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:43.840
 people feel was my best and it was a nonconventional one.

2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:46.720
 So whatever it is that you're bringing to the game, I think everyone's noticing and

2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:48.320
 keep at it.

2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:49.320
 Thank you.

 on this podcast.

2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:24.560
 Everything is great about war, except all the destruction.

 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
