00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
 The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:03.320 --> 00:05.120
 He's the founder, co chairman,

00:05.120 --> 00:08.560
 and co chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates,

00:08.560 --> 00:09.840
 one of the world's largest

00:09.840 --> 00:11.920
 and most successful investment firms

00:11.920 --> 00:14.640
 that is famous for the principles of radical truth

00:14.640 --> 00:17.880
 and transparency that underlies culture.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.760
 Ray is one of the wealthiest people in the world

00:20.760 --> 00:23.160
 with ideas that extend far beyond the specifics

00:23.160 --> 00:24.920
 of how he made that wealth.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.400
 His ideas that are applicable to everyone

00:27.400 --> 00:30.660
 are brilliantly summarized in his book, Principles.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.760
 They're also even further condensed

00:32.760 --> 00:35.280
 on several other platforms, including YouTube,

00:35.280 --> 00:38.600
 where, for example, the 30 minute video titled

00:38.600 --> 00:40.720
 How the Economic Machine Works

00:40.720 --> 00:43.420
 is one of the best educational videos

00:43.420 --> 00:46.560
 I personally have ever seen on YouTube.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.040
 Once again, you may have noticed

00:49.040 --> 00:50.600
 that the people I've been speaking with

00:50.600 --> 00:52.520
 are not just computer scientists,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.040
 but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,

00:55.040 --> 00:57.520
 psychologists, physicists, economists, investors,

00:57.520 --> 00:59.600
 and soon, much more.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.000
 To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.440
 bigger than computing.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.200
 It is our civilization's journey

01:06.200 --> 01:08.160
 into understanding the human mind

01:08.160 --> 01:10.880
 and creating echoes of it in the machine.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.000
 That journey includes the mechanisms of our economy,

01:14.000 --> 01:15.880
 of our politics, and the leaders

01:15.880 --> 01:18.080
 that shape the future of both.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.200
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.560
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:23.560 --> 01:25.640
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:25.640 --> 01:27.080
 support it on Patreon,

01:27.080 --> 01:29.240
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:29.240 --> 01:32.680
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.940
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:35.940 --> 01:38.460
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.200
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

01:41.200 --> 01:44.640
 but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.440
 Most Bitcoin exchanges take days

01:46.440 --> 01:48.680
 for a bank transfer to become investable.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.040
 Through Cash App, it takes seconds.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.360
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.120
 You can buy fractions of a stock,

01:56.120 --> 01:58.880
 which to me is a really interesting concept.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.120
 So you can buy $1 worth no matter what the stock price is.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.080
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:06.080 --> 02:09.840
 subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.680
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

02:11.680 --> 02:14.360
 to support one of my favorite organizations

02:14.360 --> 02:17.320
 that many of you may know and have benefited from

02:17.320 --> 02:20.760
 called First, best known for their first robotics

02:20.760 --> 02:22.480
 and Lego competitions.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.160
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

02:26.160 --> 02:29.240
 in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating

02:29.240 --> 02:32.200
 on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money

02:32.200 --> 02:35.540
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

02:35.540 --> 02:38.560
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

02:38.560 --> 02:42.080
 and use code LexPodcast, you'll get $10

02:42.080 --> 02:44.800
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

02:44.800 --> 02:47.880
 which again is an organization that I've personally seen

02:47.880 --> 02:51.400
 inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering

02:51.400 --> 02:52.480
 a better world.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.920
 And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.600
 Truth or more precisely an accurate understanding

02:59.600 --> 03:03.360
 of reality is the essential foundation of any good outcome.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.720
 I believe you've said that.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.640
 Let me ask an absurd sounding question

03:08.640 --> 03:10.880
 at the high philosophical level.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.800
 So what is truth?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.960
 When you're trying to do something different

03:14.960 --> 03:16.760
 than everybody else is doing

03:16.760 --> 03:19.800
 and perhaps something that has not been done before,

03:19.800 --> 03:23.520
 how do you accurately analyze the situation?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.440
 How do you accurately discover the truth,

03:25.440 --> 03:27.320
 the nature of things?

03:27.320 --> 03:30.320
 Almost the way you're asking the question implies

03:30.320 --> 03:35.200
 that truth and newness have nothing, are almost at odds.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.360
 And I just want to say that I don't think

03:37.360 --> 03:39.040
 that that's true, right?

03:39.040 --> 03:43.600
 So what I mean by truth is, you know, what's the reality?

03:43.600 --> 03:45.480
 How does the reality work?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.800
 And so if you're doing something new

03:47.800 --> 03:49.080
 that has never been done before,

03:49.080 --> 03:51.320
 which is exciting and I like to do,

03:51.320 --> 03:54.000
 the way that you would start with that

03:54.000 --> 03:57.160
 is experimenting on what are the realities

03:57.160 --> 03:59.440
 and the premises that you're using on that

03:59.440 --> 04:01.880
 and how to stress test those types of things.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.360
 I think what you're talking about is instead

04:04.360 --> 04:06.320
 the fact of how do you deal with something

04:06.320 --> 04:08.040
 that's never been done before

04:08.040 --> 04:11.160
 and deal with the associated probabilities.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.320
 And so I think in that,

04:13.320 --> 04:15.720
 don't let something that's never been done before

04:15.720 --> 04:20.160
 stand in the way of you doing that particular thing.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.720
 You have, because almost the only way

04:22.720 --> 04:25.160
 that you understand what truth is,

04:25.160 --> 04:27.240
 is through experimentation.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.440
 And so when you go out and experiment,

04:29.440 --> 04:32.320
 you're going to learn a lot more about what truth is.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.840
 But the essence of what I'm saying is that

04:35.840 --> 04:38.960
 when you take a look at that, use truth,

04:38.960 --> 04:41.720
 find out what the realities are as a foundation,

04:41.720 --> 04:43.560
 do the independent thinking,

04:43.560 --> 04:47.120
 do the experimentation to find out what's true

04:47.120 --> 04:50.400
 and change and keep going after that.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.320
 So I think that when you're thinking about it

04:54.320 --> 04:56.040
 the way you're thinking about it,

04:56.040 --> 05:00.600
 that almost implies that you're letting people

05:00.600 --> 05:03.160
 almost say that they're reliant

05:03.160 --> 05:06.480
 on what's been discovered before to find out what's true.

05:06.480 --> 05:11.200
 And what's been discovered before is often not true, right?

05:11.200 --> 05:16.200
 Conventional view of what is true is very often wrong.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.800
 It'll go in ups and downs and I mean, there are fads

05:19.800 --> 05:22.360
 and okay, this thing, it goes this way and that way.

05:22.360 --> 05:25.880
 And so definitions of truths that are conventional

05:25.880 --> 05:28.720
 are not the thing to go by.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.280
 How do you know the thing that has been done before

05:32.280 --> 05:33.880
 that it might succeed?

05:33.880 --> 05:37.840
 It's to do whatever homework that you have

05:37.840 --> 05:40.000
 in order to try to get a foundation.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.080
 And then to go into worlds of not knowing

05:43.080 --> 05:45.200
 and you go into the world of not knowing,

05:45.200 --> 05:48.920
 but not stupidly, not naively, you know,

05:48.920 --> 05:51.160
 you go into that world of not knowing

05:51.160 --> 05:54.960
 and then you do experimenting and you learn what truth is

05:54.960 --> 05:57.680
 and what's possible through that process.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.960
 I describe it as a five step process.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.080
 The first step is you go after your goals.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.800
 The second step is you identify the problems

06:04.800 --> 06:07.180
 that stand in the way of you getting to your goals.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.320
 The third step is you diagnose those

06:09.320 --> 06:11.360
 to get at the root cause of those.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.760
 Then the fourth step is then now that you know

06:13.760 --> 06:17.880
 the exact root cause, you design a way to get around those

06:17.880 --> 06:21.080
 and then you follow through and do the designs

06:21.080 --> 06:23.900
 you set out to do and it's the experimentation.

06:23.900 --> 06:27.480
 I think that what happens to people mostly

06:27.480 --> 06:31.120
 is that they try to decide whether they're gonna be

06:31.120 --> 06:34.040
 successful or not ahead of doing it

06:34.040 --> 06:36.160
 and they don't know how to do the process well

06:36.160 --> 06:39.560
 because the nature of your questions are along those lines

06:39.560 --> 06:40.760
 like how do you know?

06:40.760 --> 06:43.680
 Well, you don't know, but a practical person

06:43.680 --> 06:47.220
 who is also used to making dreams happen

06:47.220 --> 06:48.840
 knows how to do that process.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.580
 I've given personality tests to shapers.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.000
 So the person, what I mean by a shaper is a person

06:56.000 --> 07:00.320
 who can take something from visualization,

07:00.320 --> 07:02.980
 they have an audacious goal and then they go

07:02.980 --> 07:06.140
 from visualization to actualization, building it out.

07:06.140 --> 07:10.320
 That includes Elon Musk, I gave him the personality test,

07:10.320 --> 07:12.900
 I've given it to Bill Gates and I've given it to many,

07:12.900 --> 07:17.320
 many such shapers and they know that process

07:17.320 --> 07:19.920
 that I'm talking about, they experience it

07:19.920 --> 07:22.440
 which is a process essentially of knowing

07:22.440 --> 07:24.420
 how to go from an audacious goal

07:24.420 --> 07:27.800
 but not in a ridiculous way, not a dream

07:27.800 --> 07:31.600
 and then to do that learning along the way

07:31.600 --> 07:34.360
 that allows them in a very practical way

07:34.360 --> 07:38.240
 to learn very rapidly as they're moving toward that goal.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.240
 So the call to adventure, the adventure starts

07:42.240 --> 07:44.680
 not trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation

07:44.680 --> 07:48.120
 but using what, instinct?

07:48.120 --> 07:49.400
 How do you dive in?

07:49.400 --> 07:50.880
 So let's talk about.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.960
 It is being a, it's simultaneously being a dreamer

07:54.960 --> 07:58.680
 and a realist, it's to know how to do that well.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.820
 The pull comes from a pull to adventure.

08:01.820 --> 08:05.160
 For whatever reason, I can't tell you how much

08:05.160 --> 08:07.680
 of it's genetics and how much is environment

08:07.680 --> 08:11.440
 but there's a early on, it's exciting.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.440
 That notion is exciting, being creative is exciting

08:15.440 --> 08:19.160
 and so one feels that, then one gets in the habit

08:19.160 --> 08:21.440
 of doing that, okay, how do I know?

08:21.440 --> 08:25.560
 How do I learn very well and then how do I imagine

08:25.560 --> 08:30.560
 and then how do I experiment to go from that imagination?

08:30.560 --> 08:34.800
 So it's that process that one, and then one,

08:34.800 --> 08:38.900
 the more one does it, the better one becomes at it.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.160
 You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.560
 What, who are the shapers that you find yourself

08:47.560 --> 08:51.120
 thinking about when you're constructing these ideas?

08:51.120 --> 08:54.400
 The ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.400
 Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody

08:57.400 --> 09:01.160
 who comes up with a great visualization,

09:02.080 --> 09:04.720
 usually a really unique visualization

09:04.720 --> 09:08.560
 and then actually builds it out and makes the world different,

09:08.560 --> 09:10.800
 changes the world in that kind of a way.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.640
 So when I look at it, Mark Benioff with Salesforce,

09:14.640 --> 09:17.920
 Chris Anderson with TED, Mohammed Yunus

09:17.920 --> 09:20.480
 with social enterprise and philanthropy,

09:20.480 --> 09:23.520
 Jeffrey Canada and Harlem Children's Zone,

09:23.520 --> 09:28.520
 there are, all domains have shapers who have the ability

09:28.920 --> 09:32.440
 to visualize and make extraordinary things happen.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.000
 What are the commonalities between some of them?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.960
 The commonalities are, first of all,

09:38.960 --> 09:43.280
 the excitement of something new, that call to adventure,

09:43.280 --> 09:47.920
 and then again, that practicality, the capacity to learn.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.760
 The capacity then, they're able to be,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.640
 in many ways, full rage.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.480
 That means they're able to go

09:55.480 --> 09:59.360
 from the big, big picture down to the detail.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.360
 So let's say, for example, Elon Musk,

10:02.360 --> 10:06.000
 he describes, he gets a lot of money

10:06.000 --> 10:09.600
 from selling PayPal, his interest in PayPal.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.000
 He said, why isn't anybody going to Mars or outer space?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.120
 What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.200
 And how are we gonna get that?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.920
 And nobody's paying attention to that.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.560
 He doesn't know much about it.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.400
 He then reads and learns and so on.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.480
 Says, I'm gonna take, okay, half of my money,

10:27.480 --> 10:29.600
 and I'm gonna put it in there,

10:29.600 --> 10:31.240
 and I'm gonna do this thing, and he learns,

10:31.240 --> 10:32.200
 and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

10:32.200 --> 10:33.400
 and he's got creative, okay.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.000
 That's one dimension.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.480
 So he gave me the keys to his car,

10:39.480 --> 10:42.280
 but this was just early days in Tesla,

10:42.280 --> 10:45.640
 and he then points out the details.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.720
 Okay, if you push this button here, it's this,

10:48.720 --> 10:53.180
 the detail that, so he's simultaneously talking

10:53.180 --> 10:56.020
 about the big, the big, big, big picture.

10:56.020 --> 10:59.920
 Okay, when does humanity going to abandon the planet?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.480
 But he will then be able to take it down into the detail

11:03.480 --> 11:06.280
 so he can go, let's call it helicoptering.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.840
 He can go up, he can go down,

11:07.840 --> 11:09.800
 and see things at those types of perspective.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.560
 And then you've seen that with the other shapers.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.120
 And that's a common thing that they can do that.

11:14.120 --> 11:18.440
 Another important difference that they have in mind

11:18.440 --> 11:21.120
 is how they deal with people.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.280
 I mean, meaning there's nothing more important

11:24.280 --> 11:25.960
 than achieving the mission.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.960
 And so what they have in common is that there's a test

11:30.960 --> 11:34.080
 that I give these personality tests,

11:34.080 --> 11:36.400
 because they're very helpful for understanding people.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.720
 And so I gave it to all these shapers.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.280
 And one of the things in workplace inventory test

11:42.280 --> 11:45.880
 is this test, and it has a category called concern for others.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.600
 They're all having concern for others.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.280
 This includes Muhammad Yunus,

11:51.280 --> 11:54.760
 who invented microfinance, social enterprise,

11:54.760 --> 11:57.320
 impact investing, as Muhammad Yunus received

11:57.320 --> 11:59.640
 the Nobel Peace Prize for this,

11:59.640 --> 12:01.680
 the Congressional Medal of Honor.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.280
 One of the, a fortune determined,

12:04.280 --> 12:08.960
 one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs of our time.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.400
 He's built all sorts of businesses to give back money

12:12.400 --> 12:14.920
 in social enterprise, a remarkable man.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.440
 He has nobody that I know practically

12:17.440 --> 12:20.320
 could have more concern for others.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.400
 He lives a life of a saint.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.200
 I mean, a very modest lifestyle,

12:24.200 --> 12:27.320
 and he puts all his money into trying to help others.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.160
 And he tests low on what's called concern for others,

12:30.160 --> 12:33.280
 because what it really, those questions under that

12:33.280 --> 12:36.880
 are questions about conflict to get at the mission.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.840
 So they all, Jeffrey Canada,

12:38.840 --> 12:40.560
 who changed Harlem Children's Zone

12:40.560 --> 12:42.920
 and developed that to take children in Harlem

12:42.920 --> 12:44.200
 and get them well taken care of,

12:44.200 --> 12:47.040
 not only just in their education, but their whole lives.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.560
 Harlem, him also, concern for others.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.680
 What they mean is that they can see

12:53.680 --> 12:58.080
 whether though individuals are performing at a level

12:58.080 --> 13:00.640
 that an extremely high level

13:00.640 --> 13:03.520
 that's necessary to make those dreams happen.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.600
 So when you think of, let's say Steve Jobs was famous

13:06.600 --> 13:09.840
 for being difficult with people and so on,

13:09.840 --> 13:11.160
 and I didn't know Steve Jobs,

13:11.160 --> 13:13.120
 so I can't speak personally to that,

13:13.120 --> 13:15.800
 but his comments on, do you have A players?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.800
 And if you have A players, if you put in B players,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.840
 pretty soon you'll have C players and so on.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.080
 That is a common element of them,

13:22.080 --> 13:24.000
 holding people to high standards

13:24.000 --> 13:28.320
 and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.120
 What do you think about that kind of idea?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.620
 Sorry to pause on that for a second,

13:31.620 --> 13:35.840
 that the A, B, and C players,

13:35.840 --> 13:39.420
 and the importance of, so when you have a mission,

13:39.420 --> 13:41.120
 to really only have A players

13:41.120 --> 13:45.280
 and be sort of aggressively filtering for that?

13:45.280 --> 13:47.400
 Yes, but I think that there are all different ways

13:47.400 --> 13:49.640
 of being A players.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.180
 And I think, in order to grade a great team,

13:53.180 --> 13:55.840
 you have to appreciate all the differences

13:55.840 --> 13:59.320
 in ways of being A players, okay?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.520
 That's the first thing.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.720
 And then you always have to be super excellent,

14:04.720 --> 14:07.420
 in my opinion, you always have to be really excellent

14:07.420 --> 14:11.960
 with people to help them understand each other themselves

14:11.960 --> 14:15.960
 and get in sync with them about what's true about them

14:15.960 --> 14:18.080
 and their circumstances and how they're doing,

14:18.080 --> 14:19.800
 so that they're having a fabulous

14:19.800 --> 14:23.080
 personal development experience at the same time

14:23.080 --> 14:24.460
 as you're dealing with them.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.740
 So when I say that they're all different ways,

14:27.740 --> 14:30.600
 this is one of the then qualities,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.480
 you asked me what are the qualities.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.480
 So one of the third qualities that I would say

14:35.480 --> 14:40.480
 is to know how to deal well with your not knowing

14:41.800 --> 14:46.440
 and to be able to get the best expertise

14:46.440 --> 14:50.380
 so that you're a great orchestrator of different ways,

14:50.380 --> 14:53.840
 so that the people who are really, really successful,

14:53.840 --> 14:56.720
 unlike most people believe that they're successful

14:56.720 --> 14:58.480
 because of what they know,

14:58.480 --> 15:01.600
 they're even more successful

15:01.600 --> 15:04.640
 by being able to effectively learn from others

15:04.640 --> 15:06.840
 and tap into the skills of people

15:06.840 --> 15:09.000
 who see things different from them.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.740
 Brilliant, so how do you win that personality

15:11.740 --> 15:13.780
 being first of all, open to the fact

15:13.780 --> 15:18.200
 that there's other people see things differently than you,

15:18.200 --> 15:22.320
 and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.920
 Is there just the psychology of that?

15:24.920 --> 15:27.300
 Do you see a tension there between the confidence

15:27.300 --> 15:28.560
 and the open mindedness?

15:28.560 --> 15:31.600
 No, it's funny because I think we grow up thinking

15:31.600 --> 15:33.200
 that there's a tension there, right?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.160
 That there's a confidence

15:35.160 --> 15:38.360
 and the more confidence that you have,

15:38.360 --> 15:40.560
 there's a tension with the open mindedness

15:40.560 --> 15:43.620
 and not being sure, okay?

15:43.620 --> 15:45.960
 Confident and accurate

15:45.960 --> 15:50.120
 are almost negatively correlated to many people.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.840
 They're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.360
 And so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people

15:57.360 --> 16:00.220
 is not realizing how those things to go together

16:00.220 --> 16:05.220
 because instead it's really that by saying I know a lot

16:05.640 --> 16:08.620
 and how do I know I'm still not wrong?

16:08.620 --> 16:13.480
 And how do I take that the best thinking available to me

16:13.480 --> 16:16.640
 and then raise my probability of learning?

16:16.640 --> 16:19.560
 All these people think for themselves, okay?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.520
 I mean, meaning they're smart,

16:21.520 --> 16:24.000
 but they take in like vacuum cleaners,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.200
 they take in ideas of others,

16:26.200 --> 16:28.840
 they stress test their ideas with others,

16:28.840 --> 16:31.140
 they assess what comes back to them

16:31.140 --> 16:33.640
 in the form of other thinking

16:33.640 --> 16:36.360
 and they also know what they're not good at

16:36.360 --> 16:38.840
 and what other people who are good at the things

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
 that they're not good at,

16:39.840 --> 16:41.440
 they know how to get those people

16:41.440 --> 16:43.600
 and be successful all around

16:43.600 --> 16:46.960
 because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads

16:46.960 --> 16:49.600
 and that I think is one of the great differences.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.400
 So the reason my company has been successful

16:53.400 --> 16:55.200
 in terms of this is because of an idea

16:55.200 --> 16:58.000
 meritocratic decision making a process

16:58.000 --> 17:00.920
 by which you can get the best ideas.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.840
 You know, what's an idea meritocracy?

17:02.840 --> 17:05.860
 An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas

17:05.860 --> 17:07.120
 that are available out there

17:07.120 --> 17:09.820
 and to work together with other people in the team

17:09.820 --> 17:10.840
 to achieve that.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.640
 That's an incredible process that you describe

17:12.640 --> 17:15.400
 in several places to arrive at the truth,

17:15.400 --> 17:18.640
 but I apologize if I'm romanticizing the notion,

17:18.640 --> 17:19.840
 but let me linger on it.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.680
 Just having enough self belief,

17:24.680 --> 17:27.600
 you don't think there's a self delusion there

17:27.600 --> 17:30.040
 that's necessary, especially in the beginning.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.800
 You talk about in the journey,

17:31.800 --> 17:34.640
 maybe the trials or the abyss.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.640
 Do you think there is value to diluting yourself?

17:41.580 --> 17:44.280
 I think what you're calling delusion

17:44.280 --> 17:48.880
 is a bad word for uncertainty, okay?

17:48.880 --> 17:50.720
 So in other words,

17:50.720 --> 17:52.800
 because we keep coming back to the question,

17:52.800 --> 17:55.040
 how would you know and all of those things?

17:55.040 --> 17:58.640
 No, I think that delusion is not gonna help you,

17:58.640 --> 18:01.480
 that you have to find out truth, okay?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.880
 To deal with uncertainty, not saying,

18:03.880 --> 18:05.360
 listen, I have this dream

18:05.360 --> 18:08.120
 and I don't know how I'm going to get that dream.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.160
 I mentioned in my book principles

18:10.160 --> 18:12.920
 and described the process in a more complete way

18:12.920 --> 18:15.060
 than we're gonna be able to go here.

18:15.060 --> 18:19.760
 But what happens is I say, you form your dreams first

18:19.760 --> 18:21.760
 and you can't judge

18:21.760 --> 18:24.600
 whether you're going to achieve those dreams

18:24.600 --> 18:26.880
 because you haven't learned

18:26.880 --> 18:28.680
 the things that you're going to learn

18:28.680 --> 18:31.400
 on the way toward those dreams, okay?

18:31.400 --> 18:33.840
 So that isn't delusion.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.640
 I wouldn't use delusion.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.740
 I think you're overemphasizing the importance

18:38.740 --> 18:41.680
 of knowing whether you're going to succeed or not.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.240
 Get rid of that, okay?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.320
 If you can get rid of that and say,

18:45.320 --> 18:48.380
 okay, no, I can have that dream,

18:48.380 --> 18:52.680
 but I'm so realistic in the notion of finding out.

18:52.680 --> 18:56.440
 I'm curious, I'm a great learner, I'm a great experimenter.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.800
 Along the way, you'll do those experiments

18:58.800 --> 19:00.760
 which will teach you more truths

19:00.760 --> 19:03.200
 and more learning about the reality

19:03.200 --> 19:04.980
 so that you can get your dreams.

19:04.980 --> 19:08.400
 Because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay?

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
 And you think delusion's helpful.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.240
 No, the delusion isn't.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.520
 Don't confuse delusion with not knowing.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.940
 Yes, but nevertheless, so if we look at the abyss,

19:18.940 --> 19:22.060
 we can look at your own that you describe.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.200
 It's difficult psychologically for people.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.080
 So many people quit.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.960
 Many people choose a path that is more comfortable.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.640
 The heartbreak of that breaks people.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.200
 So if you have the dream

19:36.200 --> 19:38.640
 and there's this cycle of learning, setting a goal,

19:38.640 --> 19:42.200
 and so on, what's your value for the psychology

19:42.200 --> 19:45.440
 of just being broken by these difficult moments?

19:45.440 --> 19:48.380
 Well, that's classically the defining moment.

19:48.380 --> 19:51.720
 It's almost like evolution taking care of,

19:51.720 --> 19:55.440
 okay, now you crash, you're in the abyss.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.960
 Oh my God, that's bad.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.320
 And then the question is, what do you do?

19:59.320 --> 20:01.280
 And it sorts people, okay?

20:01.280 --> 20:04.720
 And some people get off the field

20:04.720 --> 20:07.320
 and they say, oh, I don't like this and so on.

20:07.320 --> 20:12.320
 And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis

20:12.800 --> 20:15.280
 and it changes their approach to learning.

20:16.140 --> 20:19.360
 The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.960
 You should take an audacious dreamer,

20:23.960 --> 20:28.680
 guy who wants to change the world, crash, okay,

20:28.680 --> 20:31.720
 and then come out of that crashing and saying,

20:31.720 --> 20:35.200
 okay, I can be audacious

20:35.200 --> 20:39.680
 and scared that I'm gonna be wrong at the same time.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.000
 And then how do I do that?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.400
 Because that's the key.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.560
 When you don't lose your audaciousness

20:44.560 --> 20:46.880
 and you keep going after your big goal,

20:46.880 --> 20:48.400
 and at the same time you say,

20:48.400 --> 20:50.640
 hey, I'm worried that I'm gonna be wrong,

20:50.640 --> 20:53.780
 you gain your radical open mindedness

20:53.780 --> 20:56.120
 that allows you to take in the things,

20:56.120 --> 20:59.560
 that allows you to go to the next level of being successful.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.580
 So your own process, I mean, you've talked about it before,

21:02.580 --> 21:05.260
 but it would be great if you can describe it

21:05.260 --> 21:06.600
 because our darkest moments

21:06.600 --> 21:07.980
 are perhaps the most interesting.

21:07.980 --> 21:12.980
 So your own with the prediction of another depression.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.480
 Economic depression.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.160
 Yes, I apologize, economic depression.

21:17.160 --> 21:22.160
 Can you talk to what you were feeling, thinking,

21:22.320 --> 21:24.600
 planning, strategizing at those moments?

21:24.600 --> 21:28.820
 Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay?

21:28.820 --> 21:30.840
 Building my little company.

21:30.840 --> 21:34.080
 This is in 1981, 82.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.680
 I had calculated that American banks

21:36.680 --> 21:40.920
 had given a lot more money to, lent a lot more money

21:40.920 --> 21:42.120
 to Latin American countries

21:42.120 --> 21:44.040
 than those countries were gonna pay back,

21:44.040 --> 21:46.720
 and that they would have a debt crisis,

21:46.720 --> 21:49.880
 and that this had sent the economy tumbling,

21:49.880 --> 21:53.520
 and that was an extremely controversial point of view.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.600
 Then it started to happen, and it happened,

21:55.600 --> 21:58.800
 and Mexico defaulted in August 1982.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.440
 I thought that there was gonna be an economic collapse

22:02.440 --> 22:03.360
 that was gonna follow

22:03.360 --> 22:05.640
 because there was a series of the other countries,

22:05.640 --> 22:08.160
 it was just playing out as I had imagined,

22:08.160 --> 22:11.000
 and that couldn't have been more wrong.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.080
 That was the exact bottom in the stock market

22:14.080 --> 22:17.440
 because central banks eased monetary policy, blah, blah, blah,

22:17.440 --> 22:19.120
 and I couldn't have been more wrong,

22:19.120 --> 22:21.940
 and I was very publicly wrong and all of that,

22:21.940 --> 22:24.840
 and I lost money for me, and I lost money for my clients,

22:24.840 --> 22:27.880
 and I only had a small company then,

22:27.880 --> 22:32.080
 but these were close people, I had to let them go.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.680
 I was down to me as the last person.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.960
 I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad

22:39.960 --> 22:43.120
 to help to pay for my family bills, very painful,

22:43.120 --> 22:46.960
 and at the same time, I would say it definitely

22:46.960 --> 22:50.460
 was one of the best things that ever happened to me,

22:50.460 --> 22:52.320
 maybe the best thing from happened to me,

22:52.320 --> 22:55.060
 because it changed my approach to decision making.

22:55.060 --> 22:56.360
 It's what I'm saying.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.960
 In other words, I kept saying, okay,

22:58.960 --> 23:01.000
 how do I know whether I'm right?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.840
 How do I know I'm not wrong?

23:02.840 --> 23:07.480
 It gave me that, and it didn't give up my audaciousness

23:07.480 --> 23:10.680
 because I was in a position, what am I gonna do?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.280
 Am I gonna go back, put on a tie,

23:13.280 --> 23:16.520
 go to Wall Street and just do those things?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.600
 No, I can't bring myself to do that, so I'm at a juncture.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.000
 How do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.200
 And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties,

23:25.200 --> 23:28.760
 and that taught me, for example, a number of techniques.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.740
 First, to find the smartest people I could find

23:31.740 --> 23:35.200
 who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.420
 I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement.

23:37.420 --> 23:39.680
 I learned how to produce diversification.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.800
 I learned how to do a number of things.

23:41.800 --> 23:46.080
 That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.440
 In other words, person by person, I hired them,

23:48.440 --> 23:50.320
 and I wanted the smartest people

23:50.320 --> 23:51.760
 who would be independent thinkers

23:51.760 --> 23:55.000
 who would disagree with each other and me well

23:55.000 --> 23:57.560
 so that we could be independent thinkers

23:57.560 --> 24:00.200
 to go off to produce those audacious dreams

24:00.200 --> 24:02.480
 because you have to be an independent thinker to do that,

24:02.480 --> 24:05.480
 and to do that independently of the consensus,

24:05.480 --> 24:06.920
 independently of each other,

24:06.920 --> 24:08.800
 and then work ourselves through that

24:08.800 --> 24:11.400
 because who know whether you're gonna have the right answer?

24:11.400 --> 24:15.720
 And by doing that, then that was the key to our success.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.240
 And the things that I wanna pass along to people,

24:18.240 --> 24:20.860
 the reason I'm doing this podcast with you

24:20.860 --> 24:23.160
 is I'm 70 years old,

24:23.160 --> 24:28.000
 and that is a magical way of achieving success.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.920
 If you can create an idea meritocracy,

24:30.920 --> 24:34.040
 it's so much better in terms of achieving success

24:34.040 --> 24:36.640
 and also quality relationships with people,

24:36.640 --> 24:38.920
 but that's what that experience gave me.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.560
 So if we can linger on a little bit longer,

24:41.560 --> 24:44.880
 the idea of an idea meritocracy, it's fascinating,

24:44.880 --> 24:48.020
 but especially because it seems to be rare,

24:48.020 --> 24:50.920
 not just in companies, but in society.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.280
 So there is a lot of people on Twitter and public discourse

24:54.280 --> 24:56.960
 and politics and so on that are really stuck

24:56.960 --> 24:59.900
 in certain sets of ideas, whatever they are.

24:59.900 --> 25:03.420
 So when you're confronted with an idea

25:03.420 --> 25:08.420
 that's different than your own about a particular topic,

25:09.040 --> 25:12.720
 what kind of process do you go through mentally?

25:12.720 --> 25:16.040
 Are you arguing through the idea with the person,

25:16.040 --> 25:18.320
 sort of present is almost like a debate,

25:18.320 --> 25:20.980
 or do you sit on it and consider the world

25:20.980 --> 25:22.680
 sort of empathetically?

25:22.680 --> 25:27.280
 If this is true, then what does that world look like?

25:27.280 --> 25:28.800
 Does that world make sense and so on?

25:28.800 --> 25:30.480
 So what's the process of considering

25:30.480 --> 25:32.840
 those conflicting ideas for you?

25:32.840 --> 25:35.200
 I'm gonna answer that question,

25:35.200 --> 25:39.120
 but after saying first, almost implicit in your question

25:39.120 --> 25:42.420
 is it's not common, okay?

25:42.420 --> 25:47.040
 What's common produces only common results, okay?

25:47.040 --> 25:50.080
 So don't judge anything that is good

25:50.080 --> 25:51.600
 based on whether it's common,

25:51.600 --> 25:53.560
 because it's only gonna give you common results.

25:53.560 --> 25:57.160
 If you want unique, you have a unique approach, okay?

25:57.160 --> 26:00.440
 And so that art of thoughtful disagreement

26:00.440 --> 26:05.120
 is the capacity to hold two things in your mind

26:05.120 --> 26:06.560
 at the same time.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.700
 The, gee, I think this makes sense,

26:09.700 --> 26:13.360
 and then saying, I'm not sure it makes sense,

26:13.360 --> 26:17.560
 and then try to say, why does it make sense?

26:17.560 --> 26:20.160
 And then to triangulate with others.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.460
 So if I'm having a discussion like that

26:22.460 --> 26:26.560
 and I work myself through and I'm not sure,

26:26.560 --> 26:29.240
 then I have to do that in a good way.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.200
 So I always give attention, for example,

26:32.200 --> 26:34.360
 let's start off, what does the other person know

26:34.360 --> 26:36.120
 relative to what I know?

26:36.120 --> 26:39.840
 So if a person has a higher expertise or things,

26:39.840 --> 26:42.240
 I'm much more inclined to ask questions.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.840
 I'm always asking questions.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.640
 If you wanna learn, you're asking questions,

26:46.640 --> 26:48.480
 you're not arguing, okay?

26:48.480 --> 26:51.840
 You're taking in, you're assessing when it comes into you.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.000
 Does that make sense?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.080
 Are you learning something?

26:54.080 --> 26:56.000
 Are you getting epiphanies and so on?

26:56.000 --> 27:00.160
 And I try to then do that if the conversation,

27:00.160 --> 27:02.800
 as we're trying to decide what is true,

27:02.800 --> 27:04.560
 and we're trying to do that together,

27:04.560 --> 27:06.200
 and we see truth different,

27:06.200 --> 27:10.320
 then I might even call in another really smart,

27:10.320 --> 27:13.280
 capable person and try to say, what is true

27:13.280 --> 27:15.400
 and how do we explore that together?

27:15.400 --> 27:17.640
 And you go through that same thing.

27:17.640 --> 27:22.600
 So I would, I said, I describe it as having open mindedness

27:22.600 --> 27:25.000
 and assertiveness at the same time,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.560
 that you can simultaneously be open minded

27:28.560 --> 27:30.920
 and take in with that curiosity

27:30.920 --> 27:32.600
 and then also be assertive and say,

27:32.600 --> 27:33.840
 but that doesn't make sense.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.640
 Why would this be the case?

27:35.640 --> 27:37.440
 And you do that back and forth.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.520
 And when you're doing that kind of back and forth

27:41.520 --> 27:44.800
 on a topic like the economy, which you have,

27:44.800 --> 27:46.640
 to me, perhaps I'm naive,

27:46.640 --> 27:51.160
 but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex,

27:51.160 --> 27:54.680
 the economy, the trading, the transactions,

27:54.680 --> 27:57.720
 that these transactions between two individuals

27:57.720 --> 28:00.320
 somehow add up to this giant mechanism.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.400
 You've put out a 30 minute video.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.520
 You have a lot of incredible videos online

28:06.520 --> 28:10.080
 that people should definitely watch on YouTube,

28:10.080 --> 28:11.680
 but you've put out this 30 minute video

28:11.680 --> 28:14.640
 titled How the Economic Machine Works.

28:14.640 --> 28:19.120
 That is probably one of the best, if not the best video

28:19.120 --> 28:22.400
 I've seen on the internet in terms of educational videos.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.280
 So people should definitely watch it,

28:24.280 --> 28:29.280
 especially because it's not that the individual components

28:29.280 --> 28:31.940
 of the video are somehow revolutionary,

28:31.940 --> 28:33.600
 but the simplicity and the clarity

28:33.600 --> 28:36.200
 of the different components just makes you,

28:36.200 --> 28:37.760
 there's a few light bulb moments there

28:37.760 --> 28:40.880
 about how the economy works as a machine.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.160
 So as you described, there's three main forces

28:43.160 --> 28:45.200
 that drive the economy, productivity growth,

28:45.200 --> 28:48.340
 short term debt cycle, long term debt cycle.

28:48.340 --> 28:52.300
 The former, productivity growth is how valuable things,

28:52.300 --> 28:56.180
 how much value people create,

28:56.180 --> 28:57.420
 valuable things people create.

28:57.420 --> 29:02.100
 The latter is people borrowing from their future selves

29:02.100 --> 29:05.220
 to hopefully create those valuable things faster.

29:05.220 --> 29:07.420
 So this is an incredible system to me.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.980
 Maybe we can linger on it a little bit,

29:09.980 --> 29:14.180
 but you've also said what most people think about

29:14.180 --> 29:15.700
 as money is actually credit.

29:15.700 --> 29:20.580
 Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion.

29:20.580 --> 29:23.180
 Total amount of money is $3 trillion.

29:24.100 --> 29:26.060
 That's just crazy to me.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.540
 Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me,

29:28.540 --> 29:29.920
 but that seems crazy.

29:30.980 --> 29:33.460
 It gives me just positive human civilization

29:33.460 --> 29:37.140
 has been able to create a system that has so much credit.

29:37.140 --> 29:40.900
 So that's a long way to ask,

29:40.900 --> 29:45.060
 do you think credit is good or bad for society?

29:45.060 --> 29:49.180
 That system of that's so fundamentally based on credit.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.300
 I think credit is great,

29:51.300 --> 29:54.580
 even though people often overdo it.

29:54.580 --> 29:58.940
 Credit is that somebody has earned money.

29:58.940 --> 30:03.940
 And what happens is they lend it to somebody else

30:04.820 --> 30:07.020
 who's got better ideas and they cut a deal.

30:07.020 --> 30:09.500
 And then that person with the better ideas

30:09.500 --> 30:10.540
 is gonna pay it back.

30:10.540 --> 30:11.980
 And if it works well,

30:11.980 --> 30:15.680
 it helps resource allocations go well,

30:15.680 --> 30:18.340
 providing people like the entrepreneurs

30:18.340 --> 30:20.500
 and all of those, they need capital.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.180
 They don't have capital themselves.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.020
 And so somebody is gonna give them capital

30:24.020 --> 30:26.580
 and they'll give them credit along those lines.

30:26.580 --> 30:30.180
 Then what happens is it's not managed well

30:30.180 --> 30:31.860
 in a variety of ways.

30:31.860 --> 30:34.460
 So I did another book on principles,

30:34.460 --> 30:38.660
 principles of big debt crises that go into that.

30:38.660 --> 30:39.660
 And it's free, by the way,

30:39.660 --> 30:43.880
 I put it free online as a PDF.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.060
 So if you go online and you look principles

30:47.060 --> 30:48.900
 of a big debt crisis is under my name,

30:48.900 --> 30:50.660
 you can download it in a PDF

30:50.660 --> 30:52.900
 or you can buy a print book of it.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.780
 And it goes through that particular process.

30:55.780 --> 31:00.780
 And so you always have it overdone in always the same way.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.100
 Everything, by the way,

31:03.100 --> 31:04.960
 almost everything happens over and over again

31:04.960 --> 31:07.080
 for the same reasons, okay?

31:07.080 --> 31:09.700
 So these debt crisis is all happened over and over again

31:09.700 --> 31:11.100
 for the same reasons.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.580
 They get it overdone.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.400
 In the book, it explains how you identify

31:14.400 --> 31:16.100
 whether it's overdone or not.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.500
 They get it overdone.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.280
 And then you go through the process

31:19.280 --> 31:21.580
 of making the adjustments according that

31:21.580 --> 31:25.340
 and it explains how they can use the levers and so on.

31:25.340 --> 31:27.220
 If you didn't have credit,

31:27.220 --> 31:30.860
 then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck.

31:30.860 --> 31:35.340
 So credit is a good thing,

31:35.340 --> 31:37.220
 but it can easily be overdone.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.800
 So now we get into the, what is money?

31:39.800 --> 31:41.020
 What is credit?

31:41.020 --> 31:43.260
 Okay, you get into money and credit.

31:43.260 --> 31:46.540
 So if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile,

31:46.540 --> 31:48.780
 keep in mind that the central bank,

31:48.780 --> 31:50.480
 let's say it can print the money.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.980
 What is that problem?

31:51.980 --> 31:55.020
 You have an IOU and the IOU says

31:55.020 --> 31:58.020
 you're gonna get a certain number of dollars, let's say,

31:58.020 --> 32:00.220
 or yen or euros.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.660
 And that is what the IOU is.

32:02.660 --> 32:05.860
 And so the question is, will you get that money

32:05.860 --> 32:07.860
 and what will it be worth?

32:07.860 --> 32:10.500
 And then also you have a government,

32:10.500 --> 32:13.020
 which is a participant in that process

32:13.020 --> 32:16.380
 because they are on the hook, they owe money.

32:16.380 --> 32:18.540
 And then will they print the money

32:18.540 --> 32:20.940
 to make it easy for everybody to pay?

32:20.940 --> 32:23.140
 So you have to pay attention to those two.

32:23.140 --> 32:26.400
 I would suggest like you recommend to other people,

32:26.400 --> 32:28.940
 just take that 30 minutes

32:28.940 --> 32:31.540
 and it comes across pretty clearly.

32:31.540 --> 32:35.140
 But my conclusion is that of course you want it.

32:35.140 --> 32:39.860
 And even if you understand it and the cycles well,

32:39.860 --> 32:42.180
 you can benefit from those cycles

32:42.180 --> 32:45.360
 rather than to be hurt by those cycles.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.620
 Because I don't know the way the cycle works

32:48.620 --> 32:50.420
 is somebody gets over indebted,

32:50.420 --> 32:52.300
 they have to sell an asset.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.580
 Okay, then I don't know,

32:53.580 --> 32:55.700
 that's when assets become cheaper.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.380
 How do you acquire the asset?

32:57.380 --> 32:59.240
 It's a whole process.

32:59.240 --> 33:03.820
 So again, maybe another dumb question, but...

33:03.820 --> 33:05.980
 There are no such things as dumb questions.

33:05.980 --> 33:06.820
 There you go.

33:06.820 --> 33:07.920
 But what is money?

33:07.920 --> 33:12.060
 So you've mentioned credit and money.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.440
 Another thing that if I just zoom out

33:16.440 --> 33:19.400
 from an alien perspective and look at human civilization,

33:19.400 --> 33:22.720
 it's incredible that we've created a thing

33:22.720 --> 33:27.380
 that only works because currency,

33:27.380 --> 33:30.480
 because we all agree it has value.

33:31.360 --> 33:36.360
 So I guess my question is how do you think about money

33:36.360 --> 33:38.920
 as this emergent phenomenon?

33:38.920 --> 33:41.720
 And what do you think is the future of money?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.480
 You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms.

33:44.480 --> 33:48.600
 What do you think is its history and future?

33:48.600 --> 33:51.340
 How do you think about money?

33:51.340 --> 33:55.100
 There are two things that money is for.

33:55.100 --> 33:59.820
 It's a medium of exchange and it's a storehold of wealth.

33:59.820 --> 34:00.660
 Yes.

34:00.660 --> 34:05.660
 So money, so you could say something's a medium of exchange,

34:06.800 --> 34:09.400
 and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?

34:11.280 --> 34:16.280
 And money is that vehicle that is those things

34:17.000 --> 34:20.840
 and can be used to pay off your debt.

34:20.840 --> 34:25.040
 So when you have a debt and you provide it,

34:25.040 --> 34:26.880
 it pays off your debt.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.760
 So that's that process.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.200
 And it's, I apologize to interrupt,

34:31.200 --> 34:35.080
 but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth

34:35.080 --> 34:37.680
 when everybody recognizes it to be of value.

34:37.680 --> 34:38.640
 That's right.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.400
 And so you see in the history around the world

34:41.400 --> 34:46.400
 and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific

34:48.320 --> 34:53.320
 in which they had as money these big stones.

34:53.660 --> 34:56.760
 And literally, they were taking a boat,

34:56.760 --> 34:59.320
 this big carved stone,

34:59.320 --> 35:01.560
 and they were taking it from one of the islands to the other

35:01.560 --> 35:06.560
 and it sank, the piece of this big stone,

35:06.880 --> 35:10.120
 piece of money that they had, and it went to the bottom

35:10.120 --> 35:13.560
 and they still perceived it as having value

35:13.560 --> 35:15.960
 so that it was, even though it was in the bottom

35:15.960 --> 35:17.820
 and it's this big hunk of rock,

35:17.820 --> 35:19.280
 the fact that somebody owned it,

35:19.280 --> 35:21.920
 they would say, oh, I'll own it for this and that.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.480
 I've seen beads in different places,

35:25.480 --> 35:28.880
 shells converted to this and mediums of exchange.

35:28.880 --> 35:32.480
 And when we look at what we've got, you're exactly right.

35:32.480 --> 35:35.120
 It is the notion that if I give it to you,

35:35.120 --> 35:37.960
 I can then take it and I can buy something with it.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.700
 And that's, so it's a matter of perception.

35:40.700 --> 35:41.540
 Okay.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.880
 And then we go through then the history of money

35:44.880 --> 35:47.520
 and the vulnerabilities of money.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.840
 And what we have is there's, through history,

35:50.840 --> 35:52.880
 there's been two types of money.

35:52.880 --> 35:57.880
 Those that are claims on something of value,

35:58.200 --> 36:01.680
 like the connection to gold or something.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.520
 That's right.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
 That would be.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.480
 Or they just are money without any connection,

36:07.480 --> 36:08.840
 and then we have a system now,

36:08.840 --> 36:10.940
 which is a fiat monetary system.

36:10.940 --> 36:12.680
 So that's what money is.

36:12.680 --> 36:17.680
 Then it will last as long as it's kept a value

36:17.840 --> 36:19.140
 and it works that way.

36:19.140 --> 36:23.780
 So let's say central banks, when they get in the position

36:23.780 --> 36:26.220
 of like they owe a lot of money,

36:26.220 --> 36:29.780
 like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case,

36:29.780 --> 36:33.700
 and they also in our mind and they have the printing press

36:33.700 --> 36:36.700
 to print the money and get out of that.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.480
 And you have a lot of people might be in that position.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.420
 Then you can print it and then it could be devalued in there.

36:43.420 --> 36:46.860
 And so history has shown, forget about today,

36:46.860 --> 36:49.840
 history has shown that no currency,

36:52.180 --> 36:56.380
 every currency has either ended as being a currency

36:56.380 --> 36:59.900
 or devalued as a currency over periods of time,

36:59.900 --> 37:01.420
 long periods of time.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.540
 So it evolves and it changes,

37:03.540 --> 37:06.300
 but everybody needs that medium of exchange

37:06.300 --> 37:08.780
 and everybody needs that storehold of wealth.

37:08.780 --> 37:12.360
 So it keeps changing what is money over a period of time.

37:12.360 --> 37:17.360
 But so much is being digitized today and there's this ideas

37:18.820 --> 37:22.580
 that are based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on.

37:22.580 --> 37:27.580
 So if all currencies, like all empires come to an end,

37:27.660 --> 37:30.060
 what do you think, well, do you think something

37:30.060 --> 37:34.340
 like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value,

37:34.340 --> 37:37.860
 a store of wealth and a medium of exchange?

37:37.860 --> 37:42.860
 The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not

37:43.660 --> 37:44.920
 an effective medium of exchange.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.460
 Like it's not easy for me to go in there

37:47.460 --> 37:49.100
 and buy things with it.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.060
 And then it's not an effective storehold of value

37:52.060 --> 37:56.020
 because it has a volatility that's based on speculation

37:56.020 --> 38:00.020
 and the like, so it's not a very effective saving.

38:00.020 --> 38:03.500
 That's very different from Facebook's

38:03.500 --> 38:05.620
 of a stable value currency,

38:05.620 --> 38:09.100
 which would be effective as both a medium of exchange

38:09.100 --> 38:11.140
 and a storehold of wealth.

38:11.140 --> 38:12.860
 Because if you were to hold it

38:12.860 --> 38:15.700
 and the way it's linked to number of things

38:15.700 --> 38:17.460
 that it's linked to would mean

38:17.460 --> 38:20.780
 that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth.

38:20.780 --> 38:22.480
 And then you have a digital currency

38:22.480 --> 38:24.980
 that could be a very effective medium exchange

38:24.980 --> 38:26.780
 and storehold of wealth.

38:26.780 --> 38:29.940
 So in my opinion, some digital currencies

38:29.940 --> 38:32.800
 are likely to succeed more or less

38:32.800 --> 38:35.060
 based on that ability to do it.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.940
 Then the question is what happens?

38:37.940 --> 38:40.740
 Okay, what happens is do central banks

38:40.740 --> 38:42.640
 allow that to happen?

38:42.640 --> 38:44.860
 I really do believe it's possible

38:44.860 --> 38:47.060
 to get a better form of money

38:47.060 --> 38:49.760
 that central banks don't control.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.980
 Okay, a better force of money

38:51.980 --> 38:54.540
 that the central banks don't control.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.820
 But then that's not yet happened.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.660
 And we also have to,

38:59.660 --> 39:03.460
 and so they've got to go through that evolutionary process.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.700
 In order to go through that evolutionary process,

39:05.700 --> 39:09.140
 first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen,

39:09.140 --> 39:11.520
 which is to some extent a threat to them

39:11.520 --> 39:13.100
 in terms of their power.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.620
 And that's an issue.

39:14.620 --> 39:17.540
 And then you have to also build the confidence

39:17.540 --> 39:20.500
 in all of the components of it

39:20.500 --> 39:23.580
 to say, okay, that's going to be effective

39:23.580 --> 39:28.580
 because I won't have problems owning it.

39:28.580 --> 39:30.940
 So I think that digital currencies

39:30.940 --> 39:35.200
 have some element of potential,

39:35.200 --> 39:37.700
 but there's a lot of hurdles

39:37.700 --> 39:39.860
 that are going to have to be gotten over.

39:39.860 --> 39:42.820
 I think that it'll be a very long time,

39:42.820 --> 39:46.140
 possibly never, but anyway, a very long time

39:46.140 --> 39:47.960
 before we have that, let's say,

39:47.960 --> 39:49.860
 get into a position that would be

39:51.860 --> 39:55.120
 effective means relative to gold, let's say,

39:55.120 --> 39:56.300
 if you were to think of that.

39:56.300 --> 40:00.740
 Because gold has a track record of thousands of years.

40:00.740 --> 40:04.820
 All across countries, it has its mobility,

40:04.820 --> 40:06.500
 it has the ability to put it down,

40:06.500 --> 40:07.580
 it has certain abilities.

40:07.580 --> 40:12.140
 It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies,

40:12.140 --> 40:14.100
 but central banks will hold it.

40:14.100 --> 40:18.420
 Like there's central banks that worry about others,

40:18.420 --> 40:20.220
 other countries, central banks might worry

40:20.220 --> 40:23.020
 about whether the U.S. dollar is going to print or not.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.860
 And so the thing they're going to go to

40:24.860 --> 40:26.980
 is not going to be the digital currency.

40:26.980 --> 40:30.740
 The thing they're going to go to is gold or something else,

40:30.740 --> 40:32.780
 some other currency, they got to pick it.

40:32.780 --> 40:35.380
 And so I think it's a long way to go.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.260
 Well, you think it's possible that one day

40:37.260 --> 40:39.140
 we don't even have a central bank

40:39.140 --> 40:42.940
 because of a currency that doesn't,

40:42.940 --> 40:46.300
 that cannot be controlled by the central bank

40:46.300 --> 40:47.940
 is the primary currency?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.700
 Or does that seem very unlikely?

40:50.700 --> 40:55.700
 It would be very remote possibility

40:57.960 --> 41:00.440
 or very long in the future.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.480
 Got it.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.240
 Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.080
 When you sit back and you look,

41:06.080 --> 41:09.840
 you describe these transactions between individuals,

41:09.840 --> 41:13.940
 somehow creating short term debt cycles,

41:13.940 --> 41:17.520
 long term debt cycles, there's productivity growth.

41:17.520 --> 41:22.400
 Does it amaze you that this whole thing works?

41:22.400 --> 41:25.360
 That there's however many million,

41:25.360 --> 41:27.800
 hundreds of millions of people in the United States,

41:27.800 --> 41:30.200
 globally over seven billion people,

41:30.200 --> 41:33.100
 that this thing between individual transactions,

41:34.200 --> 41:36.200
 it just, it works.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.080
 Yeah.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.480
 It amazes me.

41:38.480 --> 41:43.400
 Like I go back and forth between being in it

41:43.400 --> 41:48.000
 and then I think, like, how did a credit card,

41:48.000 --> 41:49.600
 how is that really possible?

41:49.600 --> 41:52.520
 I'm still used, I look up credit card, I put it on,

41:52.520 --> 41:53.880
 the guy doesn't know me.

41:53.880 --> 41:54.720
 Yeah.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.100
 It's all strangers. It signs, okay.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.660
 We're making the digital entries.

41:58.660 --> 42:01.080
 Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?

42:01.080 --> 42:04.280
 And then it goes back and it goes this and it clears

42:04.280 --> 42:05.520
 and it all happens.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.680
 And what I marvel at that and those types of things

42:09.680 --> 42:14.240
 is because of the capacity of the human mind

42:14.240 --> 42:19.000
 to create abstractions that are true.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.400
 It's imagination and then the ability to go from one level

42:23.400 --> 42:25.680
 and then if these things are true,

42:25.680 --> 42:28.880
 then you go to the next level and if those things are true,

42:28.880 --> 42:30.200
 then you go to the next level.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.700
 And all those miracles that we almost become common,

42:33.700 --> 42:36.440
 it's like when I'm flying in a plane

42:36.440 --> 42:39.520
 or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.600
 When I get communications in the middle of,

42:42.600 --> 42:45.040
 I don't know, Africa or Antarctica

42:45.040 --> 42:48.720
 and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face

42:48.720 --> 42:52.560
 on my iPad of somebody, my grandkid and someplace else

42:52.560 --> 42:57.560
 and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.620
 So while being amazing, do you have a sense,

43:01.620 --> 43:02.920
 the principles you described,

43:02.920 --> 43:06.120
 that the whole thing is stable somehow also?

43:06.120 --> 43:08.440
 Or is this, are we just lucky?

43:08.440 --> 43:11.600
 So the principles that you described,

43:11.600 --> 43:16.600
 are those describing a system that is stable, robust

43:16.880 --> 43:18.560
 and will remain so?

43:18.560 --> 43:22.920
 Or is it a lucky accident of our early history?

43:22.920 --> 43:26.000
 My area of expertise is economics and markets

43:26.000 --> 43:28.840
 so I get down to like a real nitty gritty.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.280
 I can't tell you whether the plane

43:30.280 --> 43:32.280
 is gonna fall out of the sky

43:32.280 --> 43:34.960
 because of its particular fundamentals.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.380
 I don't know enough about that

43:36.380 --> 43:37.960
 but it happens over and over again

43:37.960 --> 43:39.760
 and so on, it gives me faith, okay?

43:39.760 --> 43:41.300
 So without me knowing it.

43:41.300 --> 43:43.800
 In the markets and the economy,

43:43.800 --> 43:47.440
 I know those things well enough, in a sense,

43:47.440 --> 43:52.440
 to say that by and large, that structure is right,

43:53.600 --> 43:55.120
 what we're seeing is right.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.060
 Now, whether there are disruptions

43:58.060 --> 44:01.200
 and it has effects that can come,

44:01.200 --> 44:03.200
 not because that structure is right,

44:03.200 --> 44:04.600
 and I believe it's right,

44:04.600 --> 44:09.600
 but whether it can be hurt by let's say connectivity

44:09.640 --> 44:11.200
 or journal entries,

44:11.200 --> 44:13.480
 they could take all the money away from you

44:13.480 --> 44:15.360
 through your digital entries.

44:15.360 --> 44:19.120
 There's all sorts of things that can happen in various ways

44:19.120 --> 44:23.620
 that means that that money is worthless or the system falls

44:23.620 --> 44:26.840
 but from what I see in terms of its basic structure

44:26.840 --> 44:30.200
 and those complexities that still take my breath away,

44:30.200 --> 44:33.560
 I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them,

44:33.560 --> 44:34.840
 that doesn't worry me.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.040
 Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime

44:37.040 --> 44:38.240
 that really surprised you?

44:38.240 --> 44:39.800
 Major disruptions? Oh, all the time.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.200
 This is one of the great lessons of my life

44:42.200 --> 44:46.520
 is that many times I've seen things

44:46.520 --> 44:50.460
 that I was very surprised about

44:50.460 --> 44:54.920
 and that I realized almost all of those

44:54.920 --> 44:57.600
 I was surprised about because they just,

44:57.600 --> 45:00.240
 they were just the first time it happened to me,

45:00.240 --> 45:02.620
 they didn't happen in my lifetime before

45:02.620 --> 45:04.660
 but when I researched them,

45:04.660 --> 45:08.240
 they happened in other places or other people lifetimes.

45:08.240 --> 45:13.240
 So for example, I remember 1971, the dollar,

45:13.520 --> 45:16.720
 there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency,

45:16.720 --> 45:18.520
 it didn't experience it

45:18.520 --> 45:21.120
 and the dollar was connected to gold

45:21.120 --> 45:23.160
 and I was watching events happen

45:23.160 --> 45:26.520
 and then you get on and that definition of money

45:26.520 --> 45:29.060
 all of a sudden went out the window

45:29.060 --> 45:31.340
 because it was not tied to gold

45:31.340 --> 45:34.200
 and then you have this devaluation.

45:34.200 --> 45:38.720
 So and then, or the first oil shock or the second oil shock

45:38.720 --> 45:41.840
 or so many of these things.

45:41.840 --> 45:46.840
 But almost always I realized that they,

45:47.340 --> 45:50.080
 when I looked in history, they happened before,

45:50.080 --> 45:53.000
 they just happened in other people's lifetimes

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
 which led me to realize that I needed to study history

45:58.280 --> 46:00.880
 and what happened in other people's lifetimes

46:00.880 --> 46:04.120
 and what happened in other countries and places

46:04.120 --> 46:07.760
 so that I would have timeless and universal principles

46:07.760 --> 46:09.360
 for dealing with that thing.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.960
 So I've, oh yeah, I've been, you know,

46:11.960 --> 46:13.860
 the implausible happening

46:13.860 --> 46:18.860
 but it's like a one in a hundred year storm, okay?

46:19.080 --> 46:20.960
 Or it's or.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.160
 They've happened before.

46:22.160 --> 46:23.100
 Yeah, they've happened.

46:23.100 --> 46:24.400
 Just not to you.

46:24.400 --> 46:28.160
 Let me talk about, if we could, about AI a little bit.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.880
 So we've, Bridgewater Associates manage

46:32.880 --> 46:36.560
 about $160 billion in assets

46:37.680 --> 46:41.200
 and our artificial intelligence systems algorithms

46:41.200 --> 46:43.640
 are pretty good with data.

46:43.640 --> 46:48.000
 What role in the future do you see AI play

46:48.000 --> 46:50.240
 in analysis and decision making

46:50.240 --> 46:55.240
 in this kind of data rich and impactful area of investment?

46:55.240 --> 46:57.880
 I'm gonna answer that not only in investment

46:57.880 --> 47:02.880
 but I give a more all encompassing rule for AI.

47:04.440 --> 47:09.440
 As I think you know, for the last 25 years,

47:09.440 --> 47:13.640
 we have taken our thinking and put them in algorithms

47:13.640 --> 47:15.680
 and so we make decisions.

47:15.680 --> 47:20.120
 The computer takes those criteria, algorithms,

47:20.120 --> 47:22.960
 and they put them, they're in there and it takes data

47:22.960 --> 47:27.280
 and they operate as an independent decision maker

47:27.280 --> 47:29.520
 in parallel with our decision making.

47:29.520 --> 47:33.200
 So for me, it's like there's a chess game playing

47:33.200 --> 47:36.360
 and I'm a person with my chess game

47:36.360 --> 47:38.840
 and I'm saying it made that move and I'm making the move

47:38.840 --> 47:40.680
 and how do I compare those two moves?

47:40.680 --> 47:43.800
 So we've done a lot but let me give you a rule.

47:43.800 --> 47:47.960
 If the future can be different from the past

47:47.960 --> 47:52.960
 and you don't have deep understanding,

47:53.960 --> 47:58.960
 you should not rely on AI, okay?

47:59.280 --> 48:00.520
 Those two things.

48:00.520 --> 48:02.440
 Deep understanding of?

48:02.440 --> 48:05.120
 The cause of fact relationships that are leading you

48:05.120 --> 48:08.280
 to place that bet in anything, okay?

48:08.280 --> 48:10.240
 Anything important.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.080
 Let's say if it was do surgeries

48:12.080 --> 48:14.680
 and you would say, how do I do surgeries?

48:14.680 --> 48:17.200
 I think it's a good idea to do surgeries

48:17.200 --> 48:19.280
 but I think it's totally fine

48:19.280 --> 48:21.920
 to watch all the doctors do the surgeries.

48:21.920 --> 48:26.920
 You can put it on, take a digital camera and do that,

48:28.320 --> 48:33.320
 convert that into AI algorithms that go to robots

48:33.960 --> 48:37.080
 and have them do surgeries and I'd be comfortable with that

48:37.080 --> 48:38.800
 because if it'll do the,

48:38.800 --> 48:41.240
 if it keeps doing the same thing over and over again

48:41.240 --> 48:44.280
 and you have enough of that, that would be fine

48:44.280 --> 48:47.040
 even though you may not understand the algorithms

48:47.040 --> 48:49.440
 because if the thing's happening over and over again

48:49.440 --> 48:52.000
 and you're not asking, the future would be the same.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.200
 That appendicitis or whatever it is

48:54.200 --> 48:57.600
 will be handled the same way, the surgery, that's fine.

48:57.600 --> 49:02.600
 However, what happens with AI is for the most part

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
 is it takes a lot of data with a high enough sample size

49:09.600 --> 49:13.240
 and then it puts together its own algorithms.

49:13.240 --> 49:16.200
 Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.400
 You can either take your thinking

49:18.400 --> 49:20.640
 and express them in algorithms

49:20.640 --> 49:23.640
 or you can say, put the data in

49:23.640 --> 49:26.280
 and say, what is the algorithm?

49:26.280 --> 49:27.920
 That's machine learning.

49:27.920 --> 49:30.640
 And when you have machine learning,

49:30.640 --> 49:32.080
 it'll give you equations

49:32.080 --> 49:35.160
 which quite often are not understandable.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.160
 If you would try to say,

49:36.160 --> 49:38.400
 okay, now describe what it's telling you,

49:38.400 --> 49:40.160
 it's very difficult to describe

49:40.160 --> 49:42.960
 and so they can escape understanding.

49:42.960 --> 49:46.280
 And so it's very good for doing those things

49:46.280 --> 49:47.960
 that could be done over and over again

49:47.960 --> 49:49.960
 if you're watching and you're not taking that.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.080
 But if the future is different from the past

49:53.080 --> 49:54.000
 and you have that,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.880
 then if the future is different from the past

49:56.880 --> 49:59.080
 and you don't have deep understanding,

49:59.080 --> 50:00.720
 you're gonna get in trouble.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.160
 And so that's the main thing.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.360
 As far as AI is concerned,

50:05.360 --> 50:09.080
 AI and let's say computer replications of thinking

50:09.080 --> 50:13.560
 in very ways, I think it's particularly good for processing.

50:13.560 --> 50:18.280
 But the notion of what you want to do

50:18.280 --> 50:23.040
 is better most of the time determined by the human mind.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.480
 What are the principles?

50:24.480 --> 50:27.520
 Like, okay, how should I raise my children?

50:27.520 --> 50:29.960
 It's gonna be a long time before AI,

50:29.960 --> 50:31.160
 you're going to say,

50:31.160 --> 50:33.120
 it has a good enough judgment to do that.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.720
 Who should I marry?

50:34.720 --> 50:35.600
 All of those things.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.440
 Maybe you can get the computer to help you

50:37.440 --> 50:40.120
 but if you just took data and do machine learning,

50:40.120 --> 50:41.320
 it's not gonna find it.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.440
 If you were to then take one of my criteria

50:44.440 --> 50:47.280
 for any of those questions

50:47.280 --> 50:49.680
 and then say, put them into an algorithm

50:49.680 --> 50:53.160
 and you'd be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it.

50:53.160 --> 50:56.960
 But by and large, the mind should be used

50:56.960 --> 51:00.520
 for inventing and those creative things.

51:00.520 --> 51:04.000
 And then the computer should be used for processing

51:04.000 --> 51:06.920
 because it could process a lot more information,

51:06.920 --> 51:10.280
 a lot faster, a lot more accurately

51:10.280 --> 51:12.240
 and a lot less emotionally.

51:12.240 --> 51:15.120
 So any notion of thinking

51:15.120 --> 51:17.720
 in the form of processing type thinking

51:17.720 --> 51:19.640
 should be done by a computer

51:19.640 --> 51:21.560
 and anything that is in the notion

51:21.560 --> 51:23.480
 of doing that other type of thinking

51:23.480 --> 51:26.800
 should be operating with the brain,

51:26.800 --> 51:29.920
 operating in a way where you can say,

51:29.920 --> 51:31.360
 ah, that makes sense.

51:31.360 --> 51:35.600
 You know, the process of reducing your understanding down

51:35.600 --> 51:38.840
 to principles is kind of like the process,

51:38.840 --> 51:41.600
 the first one you mentioned,

51:41.600 --> 51:45.600
 type of AI algorithm where you're encoding your expertise,

51:45.600 --> 51:47.920
 you're trying to program, write a program,

51:47.920 --> 51:50.400
 the human is trying to write a program.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.560
 How do you think that's attainable?

51:53.560 --> 51:58.560
 The process of reducing principles to a computer program

51:58.560 --> 52:03.560
 or when you say, when you write about,

52:03.560 --> 52:05.800
 when you think about principles,

52:05.800 --> 52:07.440
 is there still a human element

52:07.440 --> 52:10.880
 that's not reducible to an algorithm?

52:12.160 --> 52:17.160
 My experience has been that almost all things,

52:17.560 --> 52:19.560
 including those things that I thought

52:19.560 --> 52:23.720
 were pretty much impossible to express,

52:23.720 --> 52:27.600
 I've been able to express in algorithms,

52:27.600 --> 52:31.120
 but that doesn't constitute all things.

52:31.120 --> 52:36.120
 So you can express far more

52:36.640 --> 52:39.360
 than you can imagine you'll be able to express.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.040
 So I use the example of,

52:41.040 --> 52:43.920
 okay, it's not, how do you raise your children?

52:43.920 --> 52:48.280
 Okay, you will be able to take it one piece by piece.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.600
 Okay, at what age, what school?

52:51.600 --> 52:54.880
 And the way to do that, in my experience,

52:54.880 --> 52:59.880
 is to take that and when you're in the moment

52:59.960 --> 53:04.960
 of making a decision or just past making a decision,

53:04.960 --> 53:09.000
 to take the time and to write down your criteria

53:09.000 --> 53:11.840
 for making that decision in words.

53:11.840 --> 53:16.360
 Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper.

53:16.360 --> 53:19.840
 I created an app online call,

53:19.840 --> 53:23.280
 it's right now just on the iPhone, it'll be on Android.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.320
 I tried getting it on Android, come on now.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.640
 Let's get it on Android.

53:26.640 --> 53:28.600
 It'll be, in a few months it'll be on Android.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.440
 Awesome.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.600
 But it has an app in there

53:31.600 --> 53:35.160
 that helps people write down their own principles.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.160
 Because this is very powerful.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.320
 So when you're in that moment

53:39.320 --> 53:41.520
 where you've just, you're thinking about it

53:41.520 --> 53:43.120
 and you're thinking your criteria

53:43.120 --> 53:46.080
 for choosing the school for your child

53:46.080 --> 53:47.640
 or whatever that might be,

53:47.640 --> 53:49.680
 and you write down your criteria

53:49.680 --> 53:52.200
 or whatever they are, those principles,

53:52.200 --> 53:57.200
 you write down and that will at that moment

53:57.440 --> 54:02.160
 make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.840
 And if you have the way that we operate

54:04.840 --> 54:06.480
 that you have easy access,

54:06.480 --> 54:08.800
 so then the next time that comes along,

54:08.800 --> 54:09.920
 you can go to that,

54:09.920 --> 54:12.000
 or you can show those principles to others

54:12.000 --> 54:13.920
 to see if they're the right principles.

54:13.920 --> 54:16.920
 You will get a clarity of that principle

54:16.920 --> 54:19.080
 that's really invaluable in words

54:19.080 --> 54:21.120
 and that'll help you a lot.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.040
 But then you start to think,

54:23.040 --> 54:26.080
 how do I express that in data?

54:26.080 --> 54:29.320
 And it'll shock you about how you can do that.

54:29.320 --> 54:33.360
 You'll form an equation that will show the relationship

54:33.360 --> 54:35.040
 between these particular parts

54:35.040 --> 54:38.440
 and then essentially the variables

54:38.440 --> 54:41.560
 that are going to go into that particular equation

54:41.560 --> 54:43.120
 and you will be able to do that.

54:43.120 --> 54:45.160
 And you take that little piece

54:45.160 --> 54:48.080
 and you put it into the computer.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.920
 And then take the next little piece

54:49.920 --> 54:51.960
 and you put that into the computer.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.080
 And before you know it,

54:54.080 --> 54:56.280
 you will have a decision making system

54:56.280 --> 54:58.120
 that's of the sort that I'm describing.

54:58.120 --> 55:00.560
 So you're almost making an argument

55:00.560 --> 55:03.160
 against an earlier statement you've made.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.200
 You're convincing me.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.440
 At first you said,

55:05.440 --> 55:08.920
 there's no way a computer could raise a child essentially.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.160
 But now you've described making me think of it.

55:12.160 --> 55:16.080
 If you have that kind of idea meritocracy,

55:16.080 --> 55:17.600
 you have this rigorous approach

55:17.600 --> 55:19.280
 that Bridgewater takes with investment

55:19.280 --> 55:21.880
 and applied to raising a child.

55:21.880 --> 55:24.920
 It feels like through the process you just described,

55:24.920 --> 55:29.120
 we could as a society arrive at a set of principles

55:29.120 --> 55:33.880
 for raising a child and encode it into computer.

55:33.880 --> 55:38.880
 That originality will not come from machine learning.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.800
 The first time you do,

55:40.800 --> 55:42.280
 so that the original, yes.

55:42.280 --> 55:43.200
 That's what I'm referring to.

55:43.200 --> 55:45.960
 But eventually as we together develop it

55:45.960 --> 55:47.280
 and then we can automate it.

55:47.280 --> 55:50.160
 That's why I'm saying the processing

55:50.160 --> 55:51.800
 can be done by the computer.

55:51.800 --> 55:53.240
 So we're saying the same thing.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.920
 We're not inconsistent.

55:54.920 --> 55:56.440
 We're saying the same thing.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.600
 That the processing of that information

55:58.600 --> 56:01.240
 and those algorithms can be done by the computer

56:01.240 --> 56:03.560
 in a very, very effective way.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.280
 You don't need to sit there and process

56:05.280 --> 56:07.680
 and try to weigh all those things in your equation

56:07.680 --> 56:09.040
 and all those things.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.800
 But that notion of,

56:10.800 --> 56:13.760
 okay, how do I get at that principle?

56:13.760 --> 56:15.720
 And you're saying you'd be surprised.

56:15.720 --> 56:18.880
 How much you can express.

56:18.880 --> 56:19.720
 That's right.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.080
 You can do that.

56:22.080 --> 56:25.800
 So this is where I think you're going to see the future.

56:25.800 --> 56:30.800
 And right now we go to our devices

56:30.960 --> 56:35.640
 and we get information to a large extent.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.480
 And then we get some guidance.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.640
 We have our GPS and the like.

56:39.640 --> 56:42.400
 In my opinion, principles.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.800
 Principles, principles, principles.

56:43.800 --> 56:44.960
 I wanna emphasize that.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.480
 You write them down.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.280
 You've got those principles.

56:48.280 --> 56:52.720
 They will be converted into algorithms for decision making.

56:52.720 --> 56:55.200
 And they're gonna also have the benefit

56:55.200 --> 56:57.360
 of collective decision making.

56:57.360 --> 56:58.880
 Because right now,

56:58.880 --> 57:01.880
 individuals based on what's stuck in their heads

57:01.880 --> 57:05.200
 are making their decisions in very ignorant ways.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.960
 They're not the best decision makers.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.880
 They're not the best criteria.

57:08.880 --> 57:10.040
 And they're operating.

57:10.040 --> 57:12.520
 When those principles are written down

57:12.520 --> 57:14.840
 and converted into algorithms,

57:14.840 --> 57:16.560
 it's almost like you'll look at that

57:16.560 --> 57:18.240
 and follow the instructions

57:18.240 --> 57:20.720
 and it'll give you better results.

57:20.720 --> 57:23.760
 Medicine will be much more like this.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.560
 You can go to your local doctor

57:25.560 --> 57:27.840
 and you could ask his point of view and whatever.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.400
 And he's rushed and he may not be the best doctor around.

57:31.400 --> 57:33.360
 And you're gonna go to this thing

57:33.360 --> 57:35.160
 and give that same information

57:35.160 --> 57:37.760
 or just automatically have it input in that.

57:37.760 --> 57:41.440
 And it's gonna tell you, okay, here's what you should go do.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.240
 And it's gonna be much better than your local doctor.

57:44.240 --> 57:49.240
 And that, the converting of information into intelligence,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.680
 okay, intelligence is the thing.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.760
 We're coming out with, again, I'm 70

57:55.760 --> 57:57.920
 and I wanna pass all these things along.

57:57.920 --> 58:02.920
 So all these tools that I've found need to develop

58:03.240 --> 58:04.960
 all over these periods of time,

58:04.960 --> 58:07.440
 all those things I wanna make available.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.960
 And what's gonna happen as they're going to see this,

58:10.960 --> 58:13.400
 they're going to see these tools

58:13.400 --> 58:15.000
 operating much more that way.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
 The idea of converting data into intelligence.

58:20.040 --> 58:23.880
 Intelligence, for example, on what they are like.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.400
 Or what are your strengths and weaknesses?

58:25.400 --> 58:28.280
 Intelligence on who do I work well with

58:28.280 --> 58:29.440
 under what circumstances?

58:29.440 --> 58:30.280
 The personalized.

58:30.280 --> 58:31.360
 Intelligence.

58:31.360 --> 58:35.680
 We're gonna go from what are called systems of record,

58:35.680 --> 58:38.280
 which are a lot of, okay, information organized

58:38.280 --> 58:41.600
 in the right way, to intelligence.

58:41.600 --> 58:46.600
 And that'll be the next big move, in my opinion.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.920
 And so you will get intelligence back.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.200
 And that intelligence comes from reducing things

58:52.200 --> 58:54.120
 down to principles into.

58:54.120 --> 58:55.480
 That's how it happens.

58:55.480 --> 58:58.880
 So what's your intuition if we look at future societies?

58:58.880 --> 59:03.880
 Do you think we'll be able to reduce a lot of the details

59:06.640 --> 59:08.280
 of our lives down to principles

59:08.280 --> 59:10.200
 that would be further and further automated?

59:10.200 --> 59:12.760
 I think the real question hinges

59:12.760 --> 59:17.760
 on people's emotions and irrational behaviors.

59:20.920 --> 59:25.920
 I think that there's subliminal things that we want, okay?

59:25.920 --> 59:30.000
 And then there's cerebral, conscious logic.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.920
 And the two often are at odds.

59:32.920 --> 59:36.680
 So there's almost like two you's in you, right?

59:36.680 --> 59:39.920
 And so let's say, what do you want?

59:39.920 --> 59:42.280
 And your mind will answer one thing,

59:42.280 --> 59:44.680
 your emotions will answer something else.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.920
 So when I think about it, I think emotions are,

59:47.920 --> 59:52.320
 I want inspiration, I want love is a good thing,

59:52.320 --> 59:54.040
 being able to have a good impact,

59:54.040 --> 59:59.040
 but it is in the reconciliation of your subliminal wants

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.720
 and your intellectual wants

1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:05.800
 so that you really say they're aligned.

1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:08.880
 And so to do that in a way to get what you want.

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.360
 So irrationality is a bad thing

1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:16.480
 if it means that it doesn't make sense

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:18.200
 in getting you what you want,

1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.200
 but you better decide which you you're satisfying.

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:23.400
 Is it the lower level you, emotional, subliminal one,

1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:24.600
 or is it the other?

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.080
 But if you can align them.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:30.440
 So what I find is that by going from my,

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:34.800
 you experience the decision, do this thing subliminally.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:36.040
 And that's the thing I want.

1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:37.720
 It comes to the surface.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:40.360
 I find that if I can align that

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.640
 with what my logical me wants

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.920
 and do the double check between them

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:47.920
 and I get the same sort of thing,

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:49.760
 that that helps me a lot.

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.080
 I find, for example, meditation is one of the things

1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:55.200
 that helps to achieve that alignment.

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.480
 It's fantastic for achieving that alignment.

1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:02.160
 And often then I also want to not just do it in my head.

1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:03.600
 I want to say, does that make sense?

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:04.440
 Help you.

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.160
 And so I do it with other people and I say, okay,

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.440
 well, let's say I want this thing and whatever.

1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:10.720
 Does that make sense?

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:13.640
 And when you do that kind of triangulation,

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:17.800
 your two you's, and you do that with also the other way,

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:21.240
 then you certainly want to be rational, right?

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.600
 But rationality has to be defined by those things.

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.760
 And then you discover sort of new ideas

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.840
 that drive your future.

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.680
 So it's always, you're always at the edge

1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:34.360
 of the set of principles you've developed.

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:36.160
 You're doing new things always.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:38.360
 That's where the intellect is needed.

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:40.600
 Well, and the inspiration.

1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:43.600
 The inspiration is needed to do that, right?

1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:45.280
 Like what are you doing it for?

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:46.960
 It's the excitement.

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:47.800
 What is that thing?

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.800
 The adventure, the curiosity, the hunger.

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.720
 What's, if you can be Freud for a second,

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:55.000
 what's in that subconscious?

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.400
 What's the thing that drives us?

1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:00.000
 I think you can't generalize of us.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.640
 I think different people are driven by different things.

1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.800
 There's not a common one, right?

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:07.960
 So like if you would take the shapers,

1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:12.960
 I think it is a combination of, subliminally,

1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:18.040
 it's a combination of excitement, curiosity.

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:20.000
 Is there a dark element there?

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.800
 Is there demons?

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:22.840
 Is there fears?

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:25.960
 Is there, in your sense, something dark that drives them?

1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:27.960
 Most of the ones that I'm dealing with,

1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:29.720
 I have not seen that.

1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:33.280
 I see the, what I really see is,

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:37.680
 ooh, if I can do that, that would be the most dream.

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.280
 And then the act of creativity.

1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:41.400
 And you say, ooh.

1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:44.200
 So excitement is one of the things.

1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:47.960
 Curiosity is a big pull, okay?

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.760
 And then tenacity, you know, okay, to do those things.

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:55.360
 But definitely emotions are entering into it.

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:58.760
 Then there's an intellectual component of it too, okay?

1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:01.160
 It may be empathy.

1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:02.800
 Can I have an impact?

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.440
 Can I have an impact?

1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:06.040
 The desire to have an impact.

1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:10.280
 That's an emotional thrill, but it also has empathy.

1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:12.760
 And then you start to see spirituality.

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:16.000
 By spirituality, I mean the connectedness to the whole.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.360
 You start to see people operate those things.

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:21.440
 Those tend to be the things that you see the most of.

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:25.480
 And I think you're gonna shut down this idea completely,

1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:29.560
 but there's a notion that some of these shapers

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.480
 really walk the line between sort of madness and genius.

1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:36.960
 Do you think madness has a role in any of this?

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:40.280
 Or do you still see Steve Jobs and Elon Musk

1:03:40.280 --> 1:03:42.160
 as fundamentally rational?

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:43.960
 Yeah, there's a continuum there.

1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.720
 And what comes to my mind is that

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:52.720
 genius is often at the edge,

1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:56.440
 in some cases, imaginary genius,

1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:00.240
 is at the edge of insanity.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.880
 And it's almost like a radio that I think,

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:06.720
 okay, if I can tune it just right, it's playing right,

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.720
 but if I go a little bit too far, it goes off, okay?

1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:14.720
 And so you can see this.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:17.360
 Kay Jamison was studying bipolar.

1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:22.000
 What it shows is that that's definitely the case,

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.600
 because when you're going out there,

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:26.400
 that imagination, whatever, is at the,

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:29.000
 can be near the edge sometimes.

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.280
 Doesn't have to always be.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.320
 So let me ask you about automation.

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.200
 That's been a part of public discourse recently.

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:41.800
 What's your view on the impact of automation,

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:44.240
 of whether we're talking about AI

1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:46.960
 and more basic forms of automation on the economy

1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:49.120
 in the short term and the long term?

1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.720
 Do you have concerns about it, as some do,

1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:55.360
 or do you think it's overblown?

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.200
 It's not overblown.

1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.480
 I mean, it's a giant thing.

1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.280
 It'll come at us in a very big way in the future.

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:04.440
 We're right at the edge of even really accelerating it.

1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:07.880
 It's had a big impact, and it will have a big impact.

1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.400
 And it's a two edged sword,

1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:14.400
 because it'll have tremendous benefits.

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:18.580
 And at the same time, it has profound benefits

1:05:18.580 --> 1:05:21.420
 in employment and distributions of wealth,

1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:25.160
 because the way I think about it is,

1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:27.560
 there are certain things human beings can do.

1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:31.880
 And over time, we've evolved to go

1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:34.360
 to almost higher and higher levels.

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.960
 And now we're almost like, we're at this level.

1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:39.120
 You know, it used to be your labor,

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.400
 and you would then do your labor,

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:42.960
 and okay, we can get past the labor.

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:44.240
 We got tractors and things,

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.160
 and you go up, up, up, up, up,

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:47.320
 and we're up over here,

1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:50.000
 and up to the point in our minds,

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:55.000
 where okay, anything related to mental processing,

1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:57.320
 the computer can probably do better,

1:05:57.320 --> 1:05:58.560
 and we can find that.

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:01.900
 And so other than almost inventing,

1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:05.460
 you're at a point where the machines

1:06:05.460 --> 1:06:09.680
 and the automation will probably do it better.

1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:12.840
 And that's accelerating, and that's a force,

1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:15.480
 and that's a force for the good.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:17.880
 And at the same time,

1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:20.720
 what it does is it displaces people

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:22.800
 in terms of employment and changes,

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:25.240
 and it produces wealth gaps and all of that.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:28.000
 So I think the real issue is that

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.160
 that has to be viewed as a national emergency.

1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:35.240
 In other words, I think the wealth gap,

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.640
 the income gap, the opportunity gap,

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:40.440
 all of those things that force

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:43.940
 is creating the problems that we're having today,

1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:47.120
 a lot of the problems, the great polarity,

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:49.120
 the disenfranchised,

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.120
 not anything approaching equality of education,

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:56.620
 all of these problems,

1:06:56.620 --> 1:06:59.360
 a lot of problems are coming as a result of that.

1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:02.520
 And so it needs to be viewed really

1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:05.440
 as an emergency situation

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:08.400
 in which there's a good work,

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:13.400
 good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively,

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:17.160
 so that it's dealt with effectively.

1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:21.640
 So because it's good for the average,

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:23.120
 it's good for the impact,

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:24.440
 but it's not good for everyone,

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:25.960
 and that creates that polarity.

1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:27.800
 So it's gotta be dealt with.

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:30.020
 Yeah, and you've talked about the American dream,

1:07:30.020 --> 1:07:32.720
 and that that's something that all people

1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:34.080
 should have an opportunity for,

1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:36.680
 and that we need to reform capitalism

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:39.360
 to give that opportunity for everyone.

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:43.520
 Let me ask on one of the ideas

1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:46.280
 in terms of safety nets that support

1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:47.840
 that kind of opportunity.

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:49.040
 There's been a lot of discussion

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:51.760
 of universal basic income amongst people.

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.400
 So there's Andrew Yang, who's running on that.

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:57.880
 He's a political candidate running for president

1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:00.480
 on the idea of universal basic income.

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:01.880
 What do you think about that,

1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:05.640
 giving $1,000 or some amount of money to everybody

1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:09.360
 as a way to give them the padding,

1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:12.400
 the freedom to sort of take leaps,

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:14.240
 to take the call for adventure,

1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:16.800
 to take the crazy pursuits?

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:19.200
 Before I get right into my thoughts

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:20.520
 on universal basic income,

1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:25.520
 I wanna start with the notion that opportunity,

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:31.800
 education, development, creating equality,

1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:36.240
 so that people say there's equal opportunity

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.760
 and is the most important thing.

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.120
 And then to find out what is the amount,

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.080
 how are you going to provide that?

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:50.080
 How do you get the money into a public school system?

1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:52.400
 How do you get the teaching?

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:57.400
 The fleshing out that plan to create equal opportunity

1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:00.580
 in all of its various forms

1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:03.000
 is the most pressing thing to do.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.240
 And so that is that.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.360
 The opportunity, the most important one

1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:11.440
 you're kind of implying is the earlier, the better.

1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:14.480
 Sort of like opportunity to education.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:17.820
 So in the early development of a human being

1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:20.120
 is when you should have the equal opportunities.

1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:21.080
 That's the most important.

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:24.240
 Right, in the first phase of your life,

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:27.860
 which goes from birth until you're on your own

1:09:27.860 --> 1:09:30.560
 and you're an adult and you're now out there.

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.680
 And you deal with early childhood development, okay?

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.040
 And you take the brain and you say, what's important?

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:42.680
 The childcare, okay, it makes a world of difference,

1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:44.740
 for example, if you have good parents

1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:48.760
 who are trying to think about instilling the stability

1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:52.100
 in a non traumatic environment to provide them.

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:53.800
 So I would say the good guidance

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:55.840
 that normally comes from parents

1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:59.520
 and the good education that they're receiving

1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:06.240
 are the most important things in that person's development.

1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:10.400
 The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:12.800
 and then to go into a market

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:15.880
 that's an equal opportunity job market,

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:19.040
 to be able to then go into that kind of market

1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:22.840
 is a system that creates not only fairness,

1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:25.000
 anything else is not fair.

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.160
 And then in addition to that,

1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.440
 it also is a more effective economic system

1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:33.740
 because the consequences of not doing that

1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:35.760
 to a society are devastating.

1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:38.600
 If you look at what the difference in outcomes

1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:40.960
 for somebody who completes high school

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.560
 or doesn't complete high school,

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:45.880
 or does each one of those state changes.

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:47.800
 And you look at what that means

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:52.120
 in terms of their costs to society, not only themselves,

1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:54.720
 but their cost and incarceration costs

1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:57.520
 and crimes and all of those things.

1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:00.760
 It's economically better for the society

1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:05.760
 and it's fairer if they can get those particular things.

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:07.760
 Once they have those things,

1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.280
 then you move on to other things.

1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:13.160
 But yes, from birth all the way through that process,

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:18.160
 anything less than that is bad, is a tragedy and so on.

1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:20.400
 So that's what, yeah,

1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:22.200
 those are the things that I'm estimating.

1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:27.200
 And so what I would want above all else is to provide that.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:28.720
 So with that in mind,

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:30.840
 now we'll talk about universal basic income.

1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:33.280
 Start with that, now we can talk about UBI.

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:34.920
 Right, because you have to have that.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:38.160
 Now the question is what's the best way to provide that?

1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.360
 So when I look at UBI,

1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:43.880
 I really think is what is going to happen

1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:46.280
 with that $1,000, okay?

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:50.540
 And will that $1,000 come from another program?

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:54.200
 Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?

1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:57.200
 Who are you giving the $1,000 to

1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.720
 and what will they do for that $1,000?

1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:01.920
 I mean, like my reaction would be,

1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:04.060
 I think it's a great thing that everybody

1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:07.760
 should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on.

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:10.680
 But when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent?

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:14.000
 A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.760
 and it could have a negative result.

1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:19.320
 It can have, they can use that money detrimentally,

1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:21.080
 not just productively.

1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:22.920
 And if that money's coming away

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:24.480
 from some of those other things

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.440
 that are gonna produce the things I want

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.840
 and you're shifted to, let's say,

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.400
 to come in and give a check,

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:32.580
 doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good

1:12:32.580 --> 1:12:33.720
 in providing those things

1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:36.540
 that I think are so fundamental important.

1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:39.580
 If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it

1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:40.420
 so when the time comes.

1:12:40.420 --> 1:12:41.240
 Use it well, right.

1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:44.240
 And use it well, that would be really, really good

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:46.640
 because it's almost like everybody,

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:48.440
 you'd wish everybody could have $1,000

1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:51.680
 worth of wiggle room in their lives, okay.

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:53.960
 And I think that would be great.

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:55.040
 I love that.

1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:58.360
 But I wanna make sure that these other things

1:12:58.360 --> 1:12:59.420
 that are taken care of.

1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:01.360
 So if it comes out of that budget

1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:04.120
 and I don't want it to come out of that budget

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:06.000
 that's gonna be doing those things.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.840
 And so you have to figure it out.

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.500
 And you have a certain skepticism

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:13.980
 that human nature will use,

1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:16.800
 may not always, in fact frequently,

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:19.680
 may not use that $1,000 for the optimal,

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:21.960
 to support the optimal trajectory.

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:23.800
 Some will and some won't.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:27.380
 One of the big advantages of universal basic income

1:13:27.380 --> 1:13:29.680
 is that if you put it in the hands,

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:32.400
 let's say of parents who know how to do the right things

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:34.960
 and make the right choices for their children

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.080
 because they're responsible

1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:38.920
 and you say I'm gonna give them $1,000 wiggle room

1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:41.440
 to use for the benefit of their children.

1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:43.300
 Wow, that sounds great.

1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:47.480
 If you put it in the hands of let's say an alcoholic

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:52.160
 or drug addicted parent who is not making those choices

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:53.840
 well for their children

1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:56.360
 and what they do is they take that $1,000

1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.100
 and they don't use it well,

1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:01.040
 then that's gonna produce more harm than good.

1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:02.220
 Well put.

1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:03.840
 You're, if I may say so,

1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:05.780
 one of the richest people in the world.

1:14:06.820 --> 1:14:09.120
 So you're a good person to ask.

1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:11.300
 Does money buy happiness?

1:14:11.300 --> 1:14:14.760
 No, it's been shown that between,

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.800
 once you get over a basic level of income

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:21.920
 so that you can take care of the pain

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:24.240
 that you can, health and whatever,

1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:28.120
 there's no correlation between the level of happiness

1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:32.080
 that one has and the level of money that one has.

1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:35.780
 That thing that has the highest correlation

1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:39.680
 is quality relationships with others, community.

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:41.760
 If you look at surveys of these things

1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:44.740
 across all surveys and all societies,

1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:49.660
 it's a sense of community and interpersonal relationships.

1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:52.600
 That is not in any way correlated with money.

1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:57.320
 You can go down to native tribes in very poor places

1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.480
 or you can go in all different communities

1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:03.200
 and so they have the opportunity to have that.

1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:06.980
 I'm very lucky in that I started with nothing

1:15:06.980 --> 1:15:08.320
 so I have the full range.

1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:11.080
 I can tell you I'm not having money

1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:13.920
 and then having quite a lot of money

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:16.040
 and I did that in the right order.

1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:17.880
 So you started from nothing in Long Island.

1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:20.620
 Yeah, and my dad was a jazz musician

1:15:20.620 --> 1:15:23.160
 but I had all really that I needed

1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:25.800
 because I had two parents who loved me

1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:28.920
 and took good care of me and I went to a public school

1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:30.760
 that was a good public school

1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:34.080
 and basically you don't need much more than that

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:36.920
 in order to, that's the equal opportunity part.

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:40.720
 Anyway, what I'm saying is I experienced the range

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:44.620
 and there are many studies on the answer to your question.

1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:46.840
 No money does not bring happiness.

1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:52.560
 Money gives you an ability to make choices.

1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:57.520
 Does it get in the way in any way

1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:00.560
 of forming those deep, meaningful relationships?

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:01.600
 It can.

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.320
 There are lots of ways that it makes negative.

1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:04.480
 That's one of them.

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:06.200
 It could stand in the way of that.

1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.480
 Yes, okay.

1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:11.720
 But I could almost list the ways that it could stand.

1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:12.840
 It could be a problem.

1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:15.420
 Yeah, what does it buy?

1:16:15.420 --> 1:16:19.580
 So if you can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom.

1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:21.400
 At the most fundamental level,

1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:25.320
 it doesn't take a whole lot but it takes enough

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:30.320
 that you can take care of yourself and your family

1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:35.320
 to be able to learn,

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:40.280
 do the basics of, have the relationships,

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:44.480
 have healthcare, the basics of those types of things.

1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:46.580
 You know, you can cover the patients.

1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:50.320
 And then to have maybe enough security

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.320
 but maybe not too much security.

1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:53.440
 That's right, yeah.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.760
 That you essentially are okay.

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.680
 Okay, that's really good.

1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.160
 And you don't, that's what money will get you.

1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:06.580
 And everything else could go either way.

1:17:06.580 --> 1:17:08.000
 Well, no, there's more.

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:08.820
 There's more.

1:17:08.820 --> 1:17:09.800
 Okay.

1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:13.520
 Then beyond that, what it then starts to do,

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.120
 that's the most important thing.

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:18.020
 But beyond that, what it starts to do

1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:22.840
 is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways.

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:27.840
 Okay, so for example, now I, you know, like in my case,

1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:32.080
 it's like those dreams might not be just my own dreams,

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.760
 they're impact on others dreams, okay?

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:40.400
 So my own dreams might be, I don't know,

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:43.640
 I can pass along these, at my stage in life,

1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:45.360
 I could pass along these principles to you

1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:49.840
 and I can give those things or I could do whatever.

1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:54.840
 I can go on an adventure, I can start a business,

1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:58.040
 I can do those other things, be productive,

1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:00.720
 I can self actualize in ways

1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:04.300
 that might be not possible otherwise.

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:07.880
 And so that's my own belief.

1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:11.000
 And then I can also help others.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.640
 I mean, this is, you know, to the extent when you get older

1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:17.080
 and with time and whatever, you start to feel connected,

1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:19.960
 spirituality, that's what I'm referring to,

1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.840
 you can start to have an effect on others

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.480
 that's beneficial and so on, gives you the ability.

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.120
 I could tell you that people who are very wealthy

1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:32.320
 who have that feel that they don't have enough money.

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:35.200
 Bill Gates will feel almost broke

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:39.040
 because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.760
 through the Gates Foundation and things like that,

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:44.160
 you know, oh my God, he doesn't have enough money

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.440
 to accomplish the things he wishes for.

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:49.240
 But those things are not, you know,

1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:51.560
 they're not the most fundamental things.

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:56.240
 So I think that people sometimes think money has value.

1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:58.480
 Money doesn't have value.

1:18:58.480 --> 1:18:59.920
 Money is, like you say,

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:02.960
 just a medium of exchange at a store all the while.

1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:05.000
 And so what you have to say is,

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.400
 what is it that you're going to buy?

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:10.120
 Now, there are other people who get their gratification

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.440
 in ways that are different from me,

1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:14.640
 but I think in many cases,

1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:18.920
 let's say somebody who used money to have a status symbol,

1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:20.240
 what would I say?

1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:22.240
 Or that's probably unhealthy.

1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:25.120
 But then, I don't know, somebody who says,

1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:28.120
 I love a great, gorgeous painting

1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:29.960
 and it's going to cost lots of money.

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.880
 In my priorities, I can't get there.

1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:38.520
 But that doesn't mean, who am I to judge others

1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:41.040
 in terms of, let's say, their element of the freedom

1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:42.160
 to do those things.

1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:43.920
 So it's a little bit complicated.

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.920
 But by and large, that's my view on money and wealth.

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:53.840
 So let me ask you in terms of the idea of,

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:56.640
 so much of your passions in life has been

1:19:56.640 --> 1:19:59.880
 through something you might be able to call work.

1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:02.000
 Alan Watts has this quote.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.440
 He said that the real key to life, secret to life,

1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:08.960
 is to be completely engaged with what you're doing

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:10.600
 in the here and now.

1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:14.200
 And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.

1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:17.920
 So I'd like to ask, what is the role of work

1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:21.600
 in your life's journey, or in a life's journey?

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.040
 And what do you think about this modern idea

1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:28.080
 of kind of separating work and work life balance?

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:31.200
 I have a principle that I believe in is,

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.520
 make your work and your passion the same thing.

1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:35.360
 Okay. Okay.

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:38.320
 So that's a similar view.

1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:40.360
 In other words, if you can make your work and your passion,

1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:41.960
 it's just gonna work out great.

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:45.840
 And then of course, people have different purposes of work.

1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:48.640
 And I don't wanna be theoretical about that.

1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:51.000
 People have to take care of their family.

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.920
 So money at a certain point is the base,

1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:57.680
 is an important component of that work.

1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:00.160
 So you look beyond that, what is the money gonna get you

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:02.040
 and what are you trying to achieve?

1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:04.800
 But the most important thing, I agree,

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:07.640
 is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:10.360
 Like if you can get into the thing that you're at,

1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:12.480
 your mission that you're on,

1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:15.800
 and you are excited about that mission that you're on.

1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:18.360
 And then you can do that with people

1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:21.920
 who you have the meaningful relationships with.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:25.320
 You have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:28.960
 I mean, that is fabulous for most people.

1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:34.640
 And it seems that many people struggle to get there,

1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:39.040
 not out of, not necessarily because they're constrained

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.280
 by the fact that they have the financial constraints

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:45.760
 of having to provide for their family and so on.

1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:50.120
 But it's, I mean, this idea is out there

1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:51.880
 that there needs to be a work life balance,

1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:54.240
 which means that most people,

1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:56.240
 we're gonna return to the same things,

1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.800
 most doesn't mean optimal,

1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:01.920
 but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion,

1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:04.960
 not unifying work and passion.

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:06.240
 Why do you think that is?

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:08.760
 Well, the work life balance,

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:12.000
 there's a life arc that you go through.

1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:17.920
 Starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80,

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:19.080
 and there is a phase.

1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:22.280
 And you could look at the different degrees of happiness

1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:23.880
 that happen in those phases.

1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.600
 I can go through that if that was interesting,

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.640
 but we don't have time probably for it.

1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:30.160
 But you get in the part of the life,

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:32.600
 that part of the life,

1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:37.600
 which has the lowest level of happiness is age 45 to 55.

1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:43.600
 And because as you move into this second phase of your life,

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.360
 now the first phase of your life

1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:48.920
 is when you're learning dependent on others.

1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:51.680
 Second phase of your life is when you're working

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:53.440
 and others are dependent on you

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:55.560
 and you're trying to be successful.

1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:58.120
 And in that phase of one's life,

1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:01.360
 you encounter the work life balance challenge

1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:04.000
 because you're trying to be successful at work

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:05.560
 and successful at parenting

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:08.440
 and successful and successful in all those things

1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:10.080
 that take your demand.

1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:11.240
 And they get into that.

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:15.320
 And I understand that problem in the work life balance.

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:20.080
 The issue is primarily to know how to approach that, okay?

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:24.160
 So I understand it's stressful, it produces stress

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:25.680
 and it produces bad results

1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:28.080
 and it produces the lowest level of happiness.

1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:29.120
 In one's life.

1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:31.880
 It's interesting as you get later in life,

1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.760
 the levels of happiness rise

1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:35.880
 and the highest level of happiness

1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:37.640
 is between ages 70 and 80,

1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:39.440
 which is interesting for other reasons.

1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:41.400
 But in that spot,

1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:44.400
 and the key to work life balance

1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:49.000
 is to realize and to learn

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.760
 how to get more out of an hour of life, okay?

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:56.840
 Because an hour of work,

1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:00.560
 what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice

1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:02.520
 between one thing and another.

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.720
 And of course they do.

1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:08.320
 But they don't realize that if they develop the skill

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:11.320
 to get a lot more out of an hour,

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:14.680
 it's the equivalent of having many more hours in your life.

1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:17.480
 And so, that's why in the book principles,

1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:19.360
 I try to go into, okay, now,

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.320
 how can you get a lot more out of an hour?

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:25.920
 That allows you to get more life into your life

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:28.040
 and it reduces the work life balance.

1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:31.600
 And that's the primary struggle in that 35 to 45.

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:35.120
 If you could linger on that,

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.880
 so what are the ups and downs of life

1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:39.960
 in terms of happiness in general

1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:42.960
 and perhaps in your own life

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:46.600
 when you look back at the moments, the peaks?

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:50.040
 It's pretty much the same pattern.

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:54.400
 Early in one's life tends to be a very happy period,

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:58.800
 all the way up and 16 is like a really great happy,

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:03.400
 I think like myself, you start to get elements of freedom,

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.680
 you get your driver's license, whatever, but 16 is there.

1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:10.560
 Junior year in high school quite often

1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.760
 could be a stressful period

1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:13.760
 to try to get thinking about the high school.

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.280
 You go into college,

1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:18.440
 tends to be very hot happiness, generally speaking.

1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:19.280
 Freedom.

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:22.600
 And then freedom, friendships, all of that.

1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:24.200
 Freedom is a big thing.

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:29.200
 And then 23 is a peak point kind of in happiness,

1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:31.680
 that freedom.

1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:35.000
 Then sequentially, one has a great time,

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.600
 they date, they go out and so on,

1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:38.920
 you find the love of your life,

1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:41.560
 you begin to develop a family.

1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:44.400
 And then with that, as time happens,

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:48.040
 you have more of your work life balance challenges

1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:50.120
 that come in your responsibilities.

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:53.920
 And then as you get there in that mid part of your life,

1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:56.520
 that is the biggest struggle.

1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:00.040
 Chances are you will crash in that period of time,

1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:02.440
 you'll have your series of failures,

1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:05.520
 that's when you go into the abyss,

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:09.000
 you learn, you hopefully learn from those mistakes,

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.440
 you have the metamorphosis, you come out, you change,

1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.520
 you hopefully become better

1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:17.240
 and you take more responsibilities and so on.

1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:20.760
 And then when you get to the later part,

1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:24.560
 as you are starting to approach the transition

1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.560
 in that late part of the second phase of your life,

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:31.200
 before you go into the third phase of your life,

1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:33.800
 second phase is you're working, trying to be successful.

1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:37.640
 Third phase of your life is you want people

1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:40.480
 to be successful without you, okay?

1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:43.920
 You want your kids to be successful without you

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:46.400
 because when you're at that phase,

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.640
 they're at making their transition

1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:50.560
 from the first phase to the second phase

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.000
 and they're trying to be successful

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:53.920
 and you want them to be successful without you

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:58.680
 and your parents are gone and then you have freedom

1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:00.640
 and then you have freedom again.

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:03.720
 And with that freedom and then you have these,

1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:06.760
 history has shown with this, you have friendships,

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:09.640
 you have perspective on life, you have different things

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.080
 and that's one of the reasons

1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:13.720
 that that later part of the life can be real.

1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:16.160
 On average, actually, it's the highest.

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:19.840
 Very interesting thing, there are surveys

1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:24.560
 and say, how good do you look and how good do you feel?

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.360
 And that's the highest survey.

1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:30.400
 Now, they're not looking the best

1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:32.160
 and they're not feeling the best, right?

1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:35.080
 Maybe it's 35 that they're actually looking the best

1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:38.520
 and feeling the best, but they rank the highest

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.080
 at that point, survey results of being the highest

1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:44.200
 in that 70 to 80 period of time

1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:47.200
 because it has to do with an attitude on life.

1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:48.960
 Then you start to have grandkids,

1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.760
 oh, grandkids are great

1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:54.680
 and you start to experience that transition well.

1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.800
 So that's what the arc of life pretty much looks like

1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:00.920
 and I'm experiencing it.

1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:02.360
 You've lived it.

1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:05.760
 When you meditate, we're all human, we're all mortal.

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.600
 When you meditate on your own mortality,

1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.600
 having achieved a lot of success on whatever dimension,

1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:17.040
 what do you think is the meaning of it all?

1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:22.040
 The meaning of our short existence on earth as human beings?

1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.120
 I think that evolution is the greatest force

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:30.120
 of the universe and that we're all tiny bits

1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:33.480
 of an evolutionary type of process

1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:38.000
 where it's just matter and machines that go through time

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.000
 and that we all have a deeply embedded inclination

1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000
 to evolve and contribute to evolution.

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:52.000
 So I think it's to personally evolve

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.260
 and contribute to evolution.

1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:56.200
 I could have predicted you would answer that way.

1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:58.320
 It's brilliant and exactly right.

1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:02.920
 And I think we've said it before, but I'll say it again.

1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:05.440
 You have a lot of incredible videos out there

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:07.520
 that people should definitely watch.

1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:08.780
 I don't say this often.

1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:11.560
 I mean, it's literally the best spend of time

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.000
 and in terms of reading principles

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.120
 and reading basically anything you write on LinkedIn

1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:18.480
 and so on is a really good use of time.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.640
 It's a lot of light bulb moments,

1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.680
 a lot of transformative ideas in there.

1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:24.800
 So Ray, thank you so much.

1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:25.640
 It's been an honor.

1:29:25.640 --> 1:29:26.640
 I really appreciate it.

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.080
 It's been a pleasure for me too.

1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:31.340
