00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Neil Ferguson,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.960
 one of the great historians of our time,

00:04.960 --> 00:07.660
 at times controversial and always brilliant,

00:07.660 --> 00:09.760
 whether you agree with him or not.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.840
 He's an author of 16 books on topics covering

00:13.840 --> 00:18.440
 the history of money, power, war, pandemics, and empire.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.360
 Previously at Harvard, currently at Stanford,

00:21.360 --> 00:25.920
 and today launching a new university here in Austin, Texas

00:25.920 --> 00:28.680
 called the University of Austin,

00:28.680 --> 00:31.840
 a new institution built from the ground up

00:31.840 --> 00:34.520
 to encourage open inquiry and discourse

00:34.520 --> 00:36.240
 by both thinkers and doers,

00:36.240 --> 00:38.120
 from philosophers and historians

00:38.120 --> 00:40.200
 to scientists and engineers,

00:40.200 --> 00:43.900
 embracing debate, dissent, and self examination,

00:43.900 --> 00:46.880
 free to speak, to disagree, to think,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.740
 to explore truly novel ideas.

00:49.740 --> 00:53.120
 The advisory board includes Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt,

00:53.120 --> 00:58.120
 and many other amazing people with one exception, me.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.240
 I was graciously invited to be on the advisory board,

01:01.240 --> 01:04.320
 which I accepted in the hope of doing my small part

01:04.320 --> 01:08.060
 in helping build the future of education and open discourse,

01:08.060 --> 01:10.480
 especially in the fields of artificial intelligence,

01:10.480 --> 01:12.200
 robotics, and computing.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.460
 We spend the first hour of this conversation

01:14.460 --> 01:16.560
 talking about this new university

01:16.560 --> 01:18.880
 before switching to talking about

01:18.880 --> 01:21.080
 some of the darkest moments in human history

01:21.080 --> 01:23.640
 and what they reveal about human nature.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.500
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.660
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:28.660 --> 01:29.920
 in the description.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.820
 And now, here's my conversation with Neil Ferguson.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.280
 You are one of the great historians of our time,

01:37.280 --> 01:40.100
 respected, sometimes controversial.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.160
 You have flourished in some of the best universities

01:42.160 --> 01:45.180
 in the world, from NYU to London School of Economics,

01:45.180 --> 01:49.480
 to Harvard, and now to Hoover Institution at Stanford.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.220
 Before we talk about the history of money, war, and power,

01:53.220 --> 01:55.740
 let us talk about a new university.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.720
 You're a part of launching here in Austin, Texas.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.720
 It is called University of Austin, UATX.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.100
 What is its mission, its goals, its plan?

02:09.320 --> 02:13.960
 I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of people

02:13.960 --> 02:17.600
 in higher education that there's a problem.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.480
 And that problem manifests itself

02:19.480 --> 02:22.060
 in a great many different ways.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.240
 But I would sum up the problem

02:24.240 --> 02:29.240
 as being a drastic chilling of the atmosphere

02:30.560 --> 02:34.480
 that constrains free speech, free exchange,

02:34.480 --> 02:35.660
 even free thought.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.440
 And I had never anticipated

02:38.440 --> 02:40.360
 that this would happen in my lifetime.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.080
 My academic career began in Oxford in the 1980s

02:43.080 --> 02:45.520
 when anything went.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.000
 One sensed that a university was a place

02:48.000 --> 02:51.280
 where one could risk saying the unsayable

02:51.280 --> 02:54.320
 and debate the undebatable.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.640
 So the fact that in a relatively short space of time,

02:58.640 --> 03:02.160
 a variety of ideas, critical race theory or wokeism,

03:02.160 --> 03:02.980
 whatever you want to call it,

03:02.980 --> 03:04.880
 a variety of ideas have come along

03:04.880 --> 03:08.040
 that seek to limit and quite drastically limit

03:08.040 --> 03:12.600
 what we can talk about strikes me as deeply unhealthy.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.500
 And I'm not sure, and I've thought about this

03:14.500 --> 03:15.880
 for a long time, you can fix it

03:15.880 --> 03:17.720
 with the existing institutions.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.080
 I think you need to create a new one.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.480
 And so after much deliberation,

03:22.480 --> 03:24.000
 we decided to do it.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
 And I think it's a hugely timely opportunity

03:29.960 --> 03:33.080
 to do what people used to do in this country,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.640
 which was to create new institutions.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.520
 I mean, that used to be the default setting of America.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.600
 We sort of stopped doing that.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.560
 I mean, I look back and I thought,

03:39.560 --> 03:41.840
 why are there no new universities?

03:41.840 --> 03:42.960
 Or at least if there are,

03:42.960 --> 03:45.080
 why do they have so little impact?

03:45.080 --> 03:48.000
 It seems like we have the billionaires,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.440
 we have the need, let's do it.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.080
 So you still believe in institutions,

03:53.080 --> 03:56.040
 in the university, in the ideal of the university?

03:56.040 --> 03:59.200
 I believe passionately in that ideal.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.780
 There's a reason they've been around for nearly a millennium.

04:02.780 --> 04:07.780
 There is a unique thing that happens

04:08.420 --> 04:11.960
 on a university campus when it's done right.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.580
 And that is the transfer of knowledge between generations.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.320
 That is a very sacred activity.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.840
 And it seems to withstand major changes in technology.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.700
 So this form that we call the university predates

04:25.700 --> 04:29.620
 the printing press, survive the printing press,

04:29.620 --> 04:32.080
 continue to function through the scientific revolution,

04:32.080 --> 04:37.080
 the enlightenment, the industrial revolution to this day.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.320
 And I think it's because,

04:39.320 --> 04:41.580
 maybe because of evolutionary psychology,

04:41.580 --> 04:46.580
 we need to be together in one relatively confined space

04:48.720 --> 04:51.840
 when we're in our late teens and early twenties

04:51.840 --> 04:54.420
 for the knowledge transfer between the generations

04:54.420 --> 04:56.320
 to happen.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.200
 That's my feeling about this,

04:58.200 --> 05:00.720
 but in order for it to work well,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.680
 there needs to be very few constraints.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.720
 There needs to be a sense

05:05.720 --> 05:07.880
 that one can take intellectual risk.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.760
 Remember, people in their late teens and early twenties

05:10.760 --> 05:14.220
 are adults, but they're inexperienced adults.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.720
 And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate,

05:17.720 --> 05:21.680
 saying stupid things was my MO.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.960
 My way to finding good ideas

05:24.960 --> 05:28.720
 was through a minefield of bad ideas.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.260
 I feel so sorry for people like me today,

05:33.260 --> 05:36.120
 people age 18, 19, 20 today,

05:36.120 --> 05:40.480
 who are intellectually very curious

05:40.480 --> 05:42.960
 ambitious, but inexperienced

05:42.960 --> 05:47.880
 because the minefields today are absolutely lethal.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.080
 And one wrong foot and it's cancellation.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.380
 I said this to Peter Thiel the other day,

05:54.380 --> 05:57.000
 imagine being us now.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.200
 I mean, we were obnoxious undergraduates.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.520
 There's nothing that Peter did at Stanford

06:03.520 --> 06:06.400
 that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.040
 And perhaps we were even worse,

06:08.040 --> 06:11.680
 but it was so not career ending

06:11.680 --> 06:15.540
 to be an absolutely insufferable,

06:17.200 --> 06:21.040
 obnoxious undergraduate then.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.520
 Today, if people like us exist today,

06:24.520 --> 06:28.240
 they must live in a state of constant anxiety

06:28.240 --> 06:32.880
 that they're going to be outed for some heretical statement

06:32.880 --> 06:35.260
 that they made five years ago on social media.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.360
 So part of what motivates me

06:37.360 --> 06:42.360
 is the desire to give the me's of today a shot

06:42.760 --> 06:46.800
 at free thinking and really,

06:46.800 --> 06:51.800
 I'd call it aggressive learning,

06:51.800 --> 06:54.320
 learning where you're really pushed.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.360
 And I just think that stopped happening

06:56.360 --> 06:59.440
 on the major campuses because whether at Harvard

06:59.440 --> 07:02.680
 where I used to teach or at Stanford where I'm now based,

07:02.680 --> 07:07.080
 I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self censorship

07:07.080 --> 07:09.560
 that means people are afraid

07:09.560 --> 07:12.480
 to take even minimal risk in class.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.720
 I mean, just take, for example,

07:14.720 --> 07:17.720
 a survey that was published earlier this year

07:17.720 --> 07:20.360
 that revealed this is of undergraduates

07:20.360 --> 07:22.340
 in four year programs in the US.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.600
 85% of self described liberal students

07:26.600 --> 07:28.760
 said they would report a professor

07:28.760 --> 07:30.800
 to the university administration

07:30.800 --> 07:33.760
 if he or she said something they considered offensive.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.560
 And something like 75% said they do it

07:36.560 --> 07:38.080
 to a fellow undergraduate.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.700
 That's the kind of culture

07:39.700 --> 07:41.740
 that's evolved in our universities.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.760
 So we need a new university in which none of that is true,

07:44.760 --> 07:48.120
 in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things,

07:48.120 --> 07:52.460
 get it completely wrong and live to tell the tale.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.280
 There's a lot more going on, I think,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
 because when you start thinking about

07:56.280 --> 07:58.340
 what's wrong with a modern university,

07:58.340 --> 08:01.800
 many, many more things suggest themselves.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.520
 And I think there's an opportunity here

08:03.520 --> 08:06.980
 to build something that's radically new in some ways

08:06.980 --> 08:10.120
 and radically traditional in other ways.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.880
 For example, I have a strong preference

08:11.880 --> 08:15.400
 for the tutorial system that you see at Oxford and Cambridge,

08:15.400 --> 08:17.760
 which is small group teaching

08:17.760 --> 08:21.320
 and highly Socratic in its structure.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.640
 I think it'd be great to bring that to the United States

08:23.640 --> 08:25.760
 where it doesn't really exist.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.600
 But at the same time,

08:26.600 --> 08:30.880
 I think we should be doing some very 21st century things,

08:30.880 --> 08:33.960
 making sure that while people are reading and studying

08:33.960 --> 08:37.400
 classic works, they're also going to be immersed

08:37.400 --> 08:41.680
 in the real world of technological innovation,

08:41.680 --> 08:43.400
 a world that you know very well.

08:44.280 --> 08:49.280
 And I'd love to get a synthesis of the ancient and classical,

08:49.640 --> 08:52.280
 which we're gradually letting fade away

08:52.280 --> 08:55.520
 with the novel and technological.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.560
 So we wanna produce people who can simultaneously

08:58.560 --> 09:02.560
 talk intelligently about Adam Smith,

09:02.560 --> 09:06.440
 or for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust,

09:06.440 --> 09:11.440
 and have a conversation with you about where AI is going

09:11.560 --> 09:14.920
 and how long it will be before I can get driven here

09:14.920 --> 09:17.040
 by a self driving vehicle,

09:17.040 --> 09:18.800
 allowing me to have my lunch and prepare

09:18.800 --> 09:22.280
 rather than focus on the other crazy people on the road.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.320
 So that's the dream that we can create something

09:25.320 --> 09:29.200
 which is partly classical and partly 21st century.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.120
 And we look around and we don't see it.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.000
 If you don't see an institution

09:33.000 --> 09:35.080
 that you really think should exist,

09:35.080 --> 09:38.080
 I think you have a more responsibility to create it.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.960
 So you're thinking including something bigger

09:41.960 --> 09:43.200
 than just liberal education,

09:43.200 --> 09:46.080
 also including science, engineering and technology.

09:46.080 --> 09:51.080
 I should also comment that I mostly stay out of politics

09:51.080 --> 09:55.680
 and out of some of these aspects of liberal education

09:55.680 --> 09:57.480
 that's kind of been the most controversial

09:57.480 --> 09:59.560
 and difficult within the university.

09:59.560 --> 10:04.480
 But there is a kind of ripple effect of fear

10:04.480 --> 10:08.920
 within that space into science and engineering

10:08.920 --> 10:13.920
 and technology that I think has a nature

10:14.480 --> 10:16.160
 that's difficult to describe.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.680
 It doesn't have a controversial nature.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.360
 It just has a nature of fear

10:19.360 --> 10:22.560
 where you're not, you mentioned saying stupid stuff

10:22.560 --> 10:24.180
 as a young 20 year old.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.080
 For example, deep learning, machine learning

10:30.080 --> 10:32.760
 is really popular in the computer science now

10:32.760 --> 10:36.000
 as an approach for creating artificial intelligence systems.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
 It is controversial in that space

10:40.000 --> 10:43.640
 to say that anything against machine learning,

10:43.640 --> 10:46.440
 saying, sort of exploring ideas that saying

10:46.440 --> 10:49.600
 this is going to lead to a dead end.

10:49.600 --> 10:54.120
 Now, that takes some guts to do as a young 20 year old

10:54.120 --> 10:57.320
 within a classroom to think like that,

10:57.320 --> 10:59.720
 to raise that question in a machine learning course.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.360
 It sounds ridiculous because it's like

11:01.360 --> 11:03.800
 who's going to complain about this?

11:03.800 --> 11:08.800
 But the fear that starts in a course on history

11:10.160 --> 11:13.560
 or on some course that covers society,

11:13.560 --> 11:16.920
 the fear ripples and affects those students

11:16.920 --> 11:18.840
 that are asking big out of the box questions

11:18.840 --> 11:22.080
 about engineering, about computer science.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.480
 And there's a lot, there's like linear algebra

11:24.480 --> 11:26.160
 that's not going to change,

11:26.160 --> 11:29.120
 but then there's like applied linear algebra,

11:29.120 --> 11:30.160
 which is machine learning.

11:30.160 --> 11:34.920
 And that's when robots and real systems touch human beings.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.800
 And that's when you have to ask yourself

11:36.800 --> 11:39.960
 these difficult questions about humanity,

11:39.960 --> 11:42.960
 even in the engineering and science and technology courses.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.400
 And these are not separate worlds in two senses.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.040
 I've just taken delivery of my copy of the book

11:50.040 --> 11:53.640
 that Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger have coauthored

11:53.640 --> 11:55.000
 on artificial intelligence,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.600
 the central question of which is,

11:56.600 --> 11:59.640
 what does this mean for us broadly?

11:59.640 --> 12:04.080
 But they're not separate worlds in C.P. Snow's sense

12:04.080 --> 12:07.040
 of the chasm between science and arts,

12:07.040 --> 12:09.800
 because on a university campus,

12:09.800 --> 12:13.640
 everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus

12:13.640 --> 12:16.320
 to the behaviors that are occurring

12:16.320 --> 12:18.360
 in the English department.

12:18.360 --> 12:23.360
 Those behaviors, if denunciation becomes a norm,

12:23.360 --> 12:25.160
 undergraduate denounces professor,

12:25.160 --> 12:27.040
 teaching assistant denounces undergraduate,

12:27.040 --> 12:28.240
 those behaviors are contagious

12:28.240 --> 12:31.000
 and will spread inextricably first to social science

12:31.000 --> 12:32.480
 and then to natural sciences.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.960
 And I think that's part of the reason why

12:35.960 --> 12:37.360
 when this started to happen,

12:37.360 --> 12:40.840
 when we started to get the origins of disinvitation

12:40.840 --> 12:42.360
 and cancel culture,

12:42.360 --> 12:45.480
 it was not just a few conservative professors

12:45.480 --> 12:47.280
 in the humanities who had to worry,

12:47.280 --> 12:48.560
 everybody had to worry,

12:48.560 --> 12:51.600
 because eventually it was going to come

12:51.600 --> 12:56.600
 even to the most apparently hard stem part of the campus.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.880
 It's contagious.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.880
 This is something Nicholas Christakis should look at

13:00.880 --> 13:03.200
 because he's very good at looking at the way

13:03.200 --> 13:06.080
 in which social networks like the ones that exist

13:06.080 --> 13:08.720
 in a university can spread everything.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.560
 But I think when we look back and ask,

13:10.560 --> 13:13.560
 why did wokeism spread so rapidly

13:13.560 --> 13:15.600
 and rapidly out of humanities

13:15.600 --> 13:17.160
 into other parts of universities?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.560
 And why did it spread across the country

13:19.560 --> 13:21.600
 and beyond the United States

13:21.600 --> 13:23.440
 to the other English speaking universities?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.680
 It's because it's a contagion.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.520
 And these behaviors are contagious.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.680
 The president of a university I won't name said to me

13:32.680 --> 13:37.520
 that he receives every day at least one denunciation,

13:37.520 --> 13:40.880
 one call for somebody or other to be fired

13:40.880 --> 13:43.080
 for something that they said.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.880
 That's the crazy kind of totalitarianism light

13:46.880 --> 13:50.600
 that now exists in our universities.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.760
 And of course the people who want to downplay this say,

13:52.760 --> 13:54.760
 oh, well, there only have been a hundred and something

13:54.760 --> 13:56.280
 in disinvitations or,

13:56.280 --> 13:57.920
 oh, there really aren't that many cases.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.400
 But the point is that the famous events,

14:00.400 --> 14:02.520
 the events that get the attention

14:02.520 --> 14:05.040
 are responsible for a general chilling

14:05.040 --> 14:07.880
 that as you say, spreads to every part of the university

14:07.880 --> 14:10.840
 and creates a very familiar culture

14:10.840 --> 14:13.440
 in which people are afraid to say what they think.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.880
 Self censorship, look at the heterodox academy data on this

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
 grows and grows.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.400
 So now a majority of students will say,

14:20.400 --> 14:23.000
 this is clear from the latest heterodox academy surveys,

14:23.000 --> 14:24.760
 we are scared to say what we think

14:24.760 --> 14:28.560
 in case we get denounced, in case we get canceled.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.320
 But that's just not the correct atmosphere

14:31.320 --> 14:33.960
 for a university in a free society.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.600
 To me, what's really creepy

14:36.600 --> 14:39.120
 is how many of the behaviors I see

14:39.120 --> 14:41.600
 on university campuses today are reminiscent

14:41.600 --> 14:44.720
 of the way that people used to behave in the Soviet Union

14:44.720 --> 14:47.280
 or in the Soviet block or in Maoist China.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.760
 The sort of totalitarianism light

14:49.760 --> 14:52.760
 that I think we're contending with here,

14:52.760 --> 14:56.480
 which manifests itself as denunciations,

14:56.480 --> 14:59.680
 people informing on superiors.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.800
 Some people using it for career advantage.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.080
 Other people reduced to helpless desperate apology

15:07.080 --> 15:09.000
 to try to exonerate themselves.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.440
 People disappearing metaphorically, if not literally.

15:12.440 --> 15:16.080
 All of this is so reminiscent of the totalitarian regimes

15:16.080 --> 15:17.760
 that I studied earlier in my career

15:17.760 --> 15:20.120
 that it makes me feel sick.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.480
 And what makes me really feel sick

15:21.480 --> 15:23.680
 is that the people doing this stuff,

15:23.680 --> 15:26.520
 the people who write the letters of denunciation

15:26.520 --> 15:29.280
 are apparently unaware that they're behaving exactly

15:29.280 --> 15:31.200
 like people in Stalin's Soviet Union.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
 They don't know that.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.720
 So they clearly have,

15:33.720 --> 15:36.040
 there's been a massive educational failure.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.680
 If somebody can write an anonymous

15:37.680 --> 15:41.200
 or non anonymous letter of denunciation and not feel shame.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.600
 I mean, you should feel morally completely contaminated

15:44.600 --> 15:47.560
 as you're doing that, but people haven't been taught

15:47.560 --> 15:49.760
 the realities of totalitarianism.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.600
 For all these reasons, I think you need to try

15:52.600 --> 15:54.840
 at least to create a new institution

15:54.840 --> 15:59.840
 where those pathologies will be structurally excluded.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.080
 So maybe a difficult question.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.040
 Maybe you'll push back on this,

16:06.040 --> 16:09.160
 but you're widely seen politically as a conservative.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.440
 Hoover Institution is politically conservative.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.920
 What is the role of politics at the University of Austin?

16:15.920 --> 16:18.760
 Because some of the ideas, people listening to this,

16:18.760 --> 16:21.280
 when they hear the ideas you're expressing,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.960
 they may think there's a lean to these ideas.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.200
 There's a conservative lean to these ideas.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.320
 Is there such a lean?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.160
 There will certainly be people who say that

16:30.160 --> 16:34.760
 because the standard mode of trying to discredit

16:34.760 --> 16:36.600
 any new initiative is to say,

16:36.600 --> 16:41.600
 oh, this is a sinister conservative plot.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.600
 But one of our cofounders, Heather Heying,

16:45.600 --> 16:49.160
 is definitely not a conservative.

16:49.160 --> 16:53.280
 She's as committed to the idea of academic freedom as I am.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.680
 But I think on political issues,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.320
 we probably agree on almost nothing.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.240
 And at least I would guess.

17:00.240 --> 17:04.720
 But politics, Max Weber made this point a long time ago,

17:04.720 --> 17:07.320
 that politics really should stop at the threshold

17:07.320 --> 17:09.720
 of the classroom, of the lecture hall.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.920
 And in my career, I've always tried to make sure

17:11.920 --> 17:13.680
 that when I'm teaching,

17:13.680 --> 17:17.960
 it's not clear where I stand politically,

17:17.960 --> 17:19.640
 though of course undergraduates

17:19.640 --> 17:22.120
 insatiably curiously want to know,

17:22.120 --> 17:24.600
 but it shouldn't be clear from what I say

17:24.600 --> 17:28.000
 because indoctrination on a political basis

17:28.000 --> 17:30.840
 is an abuse of the power of the professor,

17:30.840 --> 17:32.920
 as Weber rightly said.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.920
 So I think one of the key principles

17:35.920 --> 17:38.280
 of the University of Austin will be

17:38.280 --> 17:40.640
 that Weberian principle that politics

17:40.640 --> 17:45.040
 is not an appropriate subject

17:45.040 --> 17:48.320
 for the lecture hall, for the classroom.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.400
 And we should pursue truth

17:51.400 --> 17:55.440
 and enshrine liberty of thought.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.720
 If that's a political issue, then I can't help you.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.040
 I mean, if you're against freedom of thought,

18:01.040 --> 18:04.840
 then we don't really have much of a discussion to have.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.000
 And clearly there are some people

18:06.000 --> 18:08.240
 who politically seem quite hostile to it.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.560
 But my sense is that there are plenty

18:10.560 --> 18:12.400
 of people on the left in academia.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.440
 I think of that interesting partnership

18:14.440 --> 18:18.200
 between Cornel West and Robbie George,

18:18.200 --> 18:22.320
 which has been institutionalized in the Academic Freedom Alliance.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.960
 It's bipartisan, this issue.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.320
 It really, really is.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.080
 After all, 50 years ago, it was the left

18:28.080 --> 18:30.400
 that was in favor of free speech.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.880
 The right still has an anti free speech element to it.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.080
 Look how quickly they're out to ban critical race theory.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.480
 Critical race theory won't be banned

18:38.480 --> 18:39.880
 at the University of Texas.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.880
 Wokism won't be banned.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.000
 Everything will be up for discussion,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.040
 but the rules of engagement will be clear.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.360
 Chicago principles, those will be enforced.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.520
 And if you have to give a lecture on,

18:53.520 --> 18:56.400
 well, let's just take a recent example,

18:56.400 --> 18:57.800
 the Dorian Abbott case.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.040
 If you're giving a lecture on astrophysics,

19:02.040 --> 19:04.760
 but it turns out that in some different venue

19:04.760 --> 19:08.160
 you express skepticism about affirmative action,

19:08.160 --> 19:09.280
 well, it doesn't matter.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.160
 It's irrelevant.

19:10.160 --> 19:13.040
 We want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics

19:13.040 --> 19:16.120
 cause that's what you're supposed to be giving a lecture on.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.720
 That used to be understood.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.320
 I mean, at the Oxford of the 1980s,

19:19.320 --> 19:22.920
 there were communists and there were ultra Tories.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.800
 At Cambridge, there were people who were so reactionary

19:25.800 --> 19:28.200
 that they celebrated Franco's birthday,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.240
 but they were also out and out communists

19:30.240 --> 19:32.720
 down the road at King's College.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.200
 The understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity

19:36.200 --> 19:38.880
 was part and parcel of university life.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.000
 And frankly, for an undergraduate,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
 it was great fun to cross the road

19:42.000 --> 19:45.320
 and go from outright conservatism,

19:45.320 --> 19:47.680
 ultra Torism to communism.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.120
 One learns a lot that way.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.320
 But the issue is when you're promoting

19:52.320 --> 19:54.840
 or hiring or tenuring people,

19:54.840 --> 19:57.440
 their politics is not relevant.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.040
 It really isn't.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.520
 And when it started to become relevant,

20:01.520 --> 20:03.320
 and I remember this coming up

20:03.320 --> 20:06.800
 at the Harvard history department late in my time there,

20:06.800 --> 20:09.080
 I felt deeply, deeply uneasy

20:09.080 --> 20:11.560
 that we were having conversations

20:11.560 --> 20:15.760
 that amounted to, well, we can't hire X person

20:15.760 --> 20:19.960
 despite their obvious academic qualifications

20:19.960 --> 20:24.120
 because of some political issue.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.520
 That's not what should happen at a healthy university.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.880
 Some practical questions.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.160
 Will University of Austin be a physical in person university

20:36.160 --> 20:38.040
 or virtual university?

20:38.040 --> 20:42.360
 What are some in that aspect where the classroom is?

20:42.360 --> 20:45.720
 It will be a real space institution.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.640
 There may be an online dimension to it

20:50.640 --> 20:52.280
 because there clearly are a lot of things

20:52.280 --> 20:56.360
 that you can do via the internet.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.160
 But the core activity of teaching and learning

21:00.160 --> 21:02.000
 I think requires real space.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.880
 And I've thought about this a long time,

21:03.880 --> 21:07.360
 debated Sebastian Thrun about this many, many years ago

21:07.360 --> 21:09.520
 when he was a complete believer in,

21:09.520 --> 21:12.000
 let's call it the metaversity to go with the metaverse.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.040
 I mean, the metaversity was going to happen, wasn't it?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.920
 But I never really believed in the metaversity.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.000
 I didn't do MOOCs because I just didn't think you'd,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.240
 A, be able to retain the attention,

21:22.240 --> 21:27.040
 B, be able to cope with the scaled grading that was involved.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.920
 I think there's a reason universities have been around

21:29.920 --> 21:32.240
 in their form for about a millennium.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.520
 You kind of need to all be in the same place.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.880
 So I think answer to that question

21:36.880 --> 21:39.960
 definitely a campus in the Austin area.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.760
 That's where we'll start.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.120
 And if we can allow some of our content

21:45.120 --> 21:48.560
 to be available online, great, we'll certainly do that.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.880
 Another question is what kind of courses

21:50.880 --> 21:52.520
 and programming will it offer?

21:52.520 --> 21:54.080
 Is that something you can speak to?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.720
 What's your vision here?

21:55.720 --> 22:00.520
 We think that we need to begin more like a startup

22:00.520 --> 22:05.080
 than like a full service university from day one.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.200
 So our vision is that we start with a summer school,

22:09.320 --> 22:12.480
 which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses.

22:12.480 --> 22:17.480
 We want, I think, to begin by giving a platform

22:18.440 --> 22:21.880
 to the professors who've been most subject

22:21.880 --> 22:23.960
 to council culture and also to give an opportunity

22:23.960 --> 22:25.760
 to students who want to hear them to come.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.160
 So we'll start with a summer school

22:27.160 --> 22:30.040
 that will be somewhat in the tradition

22:30.040 --> 22:33.320
 of those institutions in the interwar period

22:33.320 --> 22:34.840
 that were havens for refugees.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.400
 So we're dealing here with the internal refugees

22:37.400 --> 22:39.800
 of the work era.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.400
 We'll start there.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.520
 It'll be an opportunity to test out some content,

22:45.520 --> 22:50.520
 see what students will come and spend time in Austin to hear.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.520
 So that's part A.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.160
 That's the sort of, if you like, the launch product.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.320
 And then we go straight to a master's program.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.400
 I don't think you can go to undergraduate education

23:03.400 --> 23:06.680
 right away because the established brands

23:06.680 --> 23:09.280
 in undergraduate education are offering something

23:09.280 --> 23:11.040
 it's impossible to compete with initially

23:11.040 --> 23:14.880
 because they have the brand, Harvard, Yale, Stanford,

23:14.880 --> 23:18.000
 and they offer also this peer network,

23:19.040 --> 23:21.720
 which is part of the reason people want so badly

23:21.720 --> 23:24.120
 to go to those places, not really the professors,

23:24.120 --> 23:25.560
 it's the classmates.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.160
 So we don't wanna compete there initially.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.240
 Where there is, I think, room for new entrance

23:31.240 --> 23:35.000
 is in a master's program.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.880
 And the first one will be in entrepreneurship

23:37.880 --> 23:39.520
 and leadership.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.400
 Because I think there's a huge hunger

23:42.400 --> 23:44.160
 amongst people who want to get into,

23:44.160 --> 23:46.040
 particularly the technology world,

23:46.040 --> 23:47.120
 to learn about those things.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.880
 And they know they're not really going to learn

23:48.880 --> 23:50.760
 about them at business schools.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.160
 The people who are not going to teach them leadership

23:53.160 --> 23:55.560
 and entrepreneurship are professors.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.480
 So we want to create something that will be a little like

23:59.480 --> 24:02.680
 the very successful Schwarzman program in China,

24:02.680 --> 24:05.160
 which was come and spend a year in China

24:05.160 --> 24:07.560
 and find out about China.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.520
 We'll be doing the same, essentially saying,

24:09.520 --> 24:12.320
 come and spend a year and find out about technology.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.240
 And there'll be a mix of academic content.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.000
 We want people to understand some of the first principles

24:18.000 --> 24:19.520
 of what they're studying.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.680
 There are first principles of entrepreneurship

24:21.680 --> 24:24.200
 and leadership, but we also want them to spend time with

24:24.200 --> 24:26.440
 people like one of our cofounders, Joe Lonsdale,

24:26.440 --> 24:30.040
 who's been a hugely successful venture capitalist

24:30.040 --> 24:33.240
 and learn directly from people like him.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.800
 So that's the kind of initial offering.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.720
 I think there are other master's programs

24:37.720 --> 24:39.880
 that we will look to roll out quite quickly.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.600
 I have a particular passion for a master's

24:42.600 --> 24:45.520
 in applied history or politics in applied history.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.720
 I'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency

24:48.720 --> 24:51.640
 of academic historians to drift away from

24:51.640 --> 24:53.720
 what seemed to me the important questions

24:53.720 --> 24:56.400
 and certainly to drift away from addressing

24:56.400 --> 24:57.840
 policy relevant questions.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.080
 So I would love to be involved in a master's

25:01.080 --> 25:02.760
 in applied history.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.000
 And we'll build some programs like that

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
 before we get to the full liberal arts experience

25:11.480 --> 25:15.000
 that we envisage for an undergraduate program.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.080
 And that undergraduate program is an exciting one

25:17.080 --> 25:19.680
 cause I think we can be innovative there too.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.680
 I would say two years would be spent doing

25:22.680 --> 25:26.640
 some very classical and difficult classical things,

25:26.640 --> 25:30.960
 bridging those old divides between arts and sciences.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.920
 But then there would also be in the second half

25:34.920 --> 25:37.520
 in the junior and senior years,

25:37.520 --> 25:41.080
 something somewhat more of an apprenticeship

25:41.080 --> 25:43.560
 where we'll have centers, including a center

25:43.560 --> 25:47.680
 for technology engineering mathematics

25:47.680 --> 25:51.760
 that will be designed to help people make that transition

25:51.760 --> 25:54.800
 from the theoretical to the practical.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.000
 So that's the vision.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
 And I think like any early stage idea

26:02.000 --> 26:04.240
 we'll doubtless tweak it as we go along.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.360
 We'll find things that work and things that don't work.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.360
 But I have a very clear sense in my own mind

26:10.360 --> 26:14.000
 of how this should look five years from now.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.840
 And I don't know about you.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.800
 I mean, I'm unusual as an academic

26:16.800 --> 26:18.800
 cause I quite like starting new institutions

26:18.800 --> 26:22.320
 and I've done a bit of it in my career.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.200
 You got to kind of know what it should look like

26:25.200 --> 26:27.160
 after the first four or five years

26:27.160 --> 26:28.680
 to get out of bed in the morning

26:28.680 --> 26:31.920
 and put up with all the kind of hassles of doing it.

26:31.920 --> 26:35.920
 Not least the inevitable flack that we were bound to take

26:35.920 --> 26:38.120
 from the educational establishment.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.960
 And I was graciously invited to be an advisor

26:41.960 --> 26:45.200
 to this University of Austin.

26:45.200 --> 26:49.440
 And the reason I would love to help

26:49.440 --> 26:52.720
 in whatever way I can is several.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.360
 So one, I would love to see Austin,

26:55.360 --> 26:58.880
 the physical location flourish intellectually

26:58.880 --> 27:03.320
 and especially in the space of science and engineering.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.320
 That's really exciting to me.

27:05.320 --> 27:09.760
 Another reason is I am still a research scientist at MIT.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.760
 I still love MIT and I see this effort

27:14.760 --> 27:18.880
 that you're launching as a beacon

27:19.800 --> 27:23.120
 that leads the way to the other elite institutions

27:23.120 --> 27:24.440
 in the world.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.480
 I think too many of my colleagues

27:26.480 --> 27:30.140
 and especially in robotics kind of see,

27:31.760 --> 27:35.880
 don't see robotics as a humanities problem.

27:35.880 --> 27:40.880
 But to me, robotics and AI will define much of our world

27:40.880 --> 27:41.800
 in the next century.

27:41.800 --> 27:46.800
 And for, not to consider all the deep psychological,

27:46.800 --> 27:50.800
 sociological, human problems associated with that.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.800
 To have real open conversations, to say stupid things,

27:55.800 --> 27:59.640
 to challenge the ideas that,

27:59.640 --> 28:03.120
 of how companies are being run, for example.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.000
 That is the safe space.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.600
 It's very difficult to talk about the different

28:08.600 --> 28:11.160
 questions about technology when you're employed

28:11.160 --> 28:13.800
 by Facebook or Google and so on.

28:13.800 --> 28:17.080
 The university is the place to have those conversations.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.720
 That's right, and we're hugely excited

28:18.720 --> 28:21.080
 that you want to be one of our advisors.

28:21.080 --> 28:26.080
 We need a broad and an eclectic group of people.

28:26.080 --> 28:31.080
 And I'm excited by the way that group has developed.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.960
 It has some of the, some of my favorite intellectuals

28:33.960 --> 28:36.600
 are there, Steve Pinker,

28:36.600 --> 28:40.280
 for example, but we're also making sure

28:40.280 --> 28:45.280
 that we have people with experience in academic leadership.

28:46.960 --> 28:51.960
 And so it's a happy coalition of the willing,

28:51.960 --> 28:54.600
 looking to try to build something new,

28:54.600 --> 28:56.800
 which as you say, will be complimentary

28:56.800 --> 29:00.280
 to the existing and established institutions.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.200
 I think of the academic world as a network.

29:04.200 --> 29:09.200
 I've moved from some major hubs in the network to others,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.720
 but I've always felt that we do our best work,

29:13.720 --> 29:17.680
 not in a silo called Oxford, but in a silo

29:17.680 --> 29:21.000
 that is really a hub connected to Stanford,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.400
 connected to Harvard, connected to MIT.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.360
 One of the reasons I moved to the United States

29:26.360 --> 29:30.280
 was that I sensed that there was more intellectual action

29:30.280 --> 29:35.280
 in my original field of expertise, financial history.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.280
 And that was right.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.000
 It was a good move.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.040
 I think I'd have stagnated if I'd stayed at Oxford.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.400
 But at the same time, I haven't lost connection with Oxford.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.800
 I recently went and gave a lecture there

29:48.800 --> 29:50.480
 in honor of Sir Roger Scruton,

29:50.480 --> 29:52.840
 one of the great conservative philosophers.

29:52.840 --> 29:56.800
 And the burden of my lecture was the idea

29:56.800 --> 30:00.000
 of the Anglosphere, which appealed a lot to Roger,

30:00.000 --> 30:04.520
 will go horribly wrong if illiberal ideas

30:04.520 --> 30:06.280
 that inhibit academic freedom spread

30:06.280 --> 30:07.800
 all over the Anglosphere.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.480
 And this network gets infected with these,

30:11.480 --> 30:15.000
 I think, deeply damaging notions.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.520
 So yeah, I think we're creating a new node.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.760
 I hope it's a node that makes the network overall

30:21.760 --> 30:23.320
 more resilient.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.840
 And right now there's an urgent need for it.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.480
 I mean, there are people whose academic careers

30:28.480 --> 30:30.560
 have been terminated.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.640
 I'll name two who are involved.

30:32.640 --> 30:37.640
 Peter Boghossian, who was harassed out of Portland State

30:37.680 --> 30:42.680
 for the reason that he was one of those intrepid figures

30:43.000 --> 30:47.040
 who carried out the grievance studies hoaxes,

30:47.040 --> 30:50.520
 exposing the utter charlatanry going on

30:50.520 --> 30:53.000
 in many supposedly academic journals

30:53.000 --> 30:56.920
 by getting phony gender studies articles published.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.800
 This is genius.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.880
 And of course, so put the noses out of joint

31:00.880 --> 31:02.280
 of the academic establishment

31:02.280 --> 31:05.240
 that he began to be subject to disciplinary actions.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.240
 So Peter is going to be involved.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.240
 And in a recent shocking British case,

31:10.240 --> 31:12.200
 the philosopher Kathleen Stock has essentially

31:12.200 --> 31:15.440
 been run off the campus of Sussex University in England

31:18.120 --> 31:21.280
 for violating the increasingly complex rules

31:21.280 --> 31:26.160
 about discussing transgender issues and women's rights.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.240
 She will be one of our advisors.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.680
 And I think also one of our founding fellows

31:30.680 --> 31:35.000
 actually teaching for us in our first iteration.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.800
 So I think we're creating a node that's badly needed.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.800
 Those people, I mean, I remember saying this

31:40.800 --> 31:44.080
 to the other founders when we first began

31:44.080 --> 31:48.160
 to talk about this idea to Barry Weiss

31:48.160 --> 31:52.640
 and to Panna Canellos as well as to Heather Haying.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.960
 We need to do this urgently because there are people

31:55.960 --> 31:58.760
 whose livelihoods are in fact being destroyed

31:58.760 --> 32:02.560
 by these extraordinarily illiberal campaigns against them.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.040
 And so there's no time to hang around

32:05.040 --> 32:07.640
 and come up with the perfect design.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.120
 This is an urgently needed lifeboat.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.560
 And let's start with that.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.560
 And then we can build something spectacular

32:13.560 --> 32:16.640
 taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have,

32:16.640 --> 32:19.560
 well, they now have very real skin in the game.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.720
 They need to make this a success.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.520
 And I'm sure they will help us make it a success.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.640
 So you mentioned some interesting names

32:27.640 --> 32:30.400
 like Heather Haying, Barry Weiss, and so on.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.200
 Steven Pinker, somebody I really admire.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.240
 He too was under a lot of, quite a lot of fire.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.840
 Many reasons I admire him.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.560
 One, because of his optimism about the future.

32:40.560 --> 32:44.480
 And two, how little of a damn he seems to give

32:44.480 --> 32:48.040
 about like walking through the fire.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.360
 There's nobody more zen about walking through the fire

32:50.360 --> 32:51.320
 than Steven Pinker.

32:51.320 --> 32:54.200
 But anyway, you mentioned a lot of interesting names,

32:54.200 --> 32:56.920
 Jonathan Haidt is also interesting there.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.880
 Who is involved with this venture at this early days?

33:00.880 --> 33:04.720
 Well, one of the things that I'm excited about

33:04.720 --> 33:08.200
 is that we're getting people from inside and outside

33:08.200 --> 33:09.200
 the academic world.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.840
 So we've got Arthur Brooks, who for many years

33:12.840 --> 33:17.600
 ran the American Enterprise Institute very successfully,

33:17.600 --> 33:20.720
 has a Harvard role now teaching.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.680
 And so he's somebody who brings, I think,

33:23.680 --> 33:27.120
 a different perspective.

33:27.120 --> 33:34.480
 There's obviously a need to get experienced academic leaders

33:34.480 --> 33:38.600
 involved, which is why I was talking to Larry Summers

33:38.600 --> 33:43.520
 about whether he would join our board of advisors.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.840
 The Chicago principals owe a debt

33:46.840 --> 33:50.200
 to the former president of Chicago.

33:50.200 --> 33:54.120
 And he's graciously agreed to be in the board of advisors.

33:54.120 --> 33:54.720
 I could go on.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.320
 It would become a long and tedious list.

33:56.320 --> 34:01.960
 But my goal in trying to get this happy band to form

34:01.960 --> 34:06.000
 has been to signal that it's a bipartisan endeavor.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.160
 It is not a conservative institution

34:08.160 --> 34:09.320
 that we're trying to build.

34:09.320 --> 34:12.280
 It's an institution that's committed to academic freedom

34:12.280 --> 34:18.320
 and the pursuit of truth that will mean it when it takes

34:18.320 --> 34:20.400
 Robert Zimmer's Chicago principles

34:20.400 --> 34:22.880
 and enshrines them in its founding charter.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.520
 And we'll make those something other than honored

34:26.520 --> 34:29.680
 in the breach, which they seem to be at some institutions.

34:29.680 --> 34:33.320
 So the idea here is to grow this organically.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.600
 We need, rather like the Academic Freedom Alliance

34:36.600 --> 34:39.080
 that Robbie George created earlier this year,

34:39.080 --> 34:40.560
 we need breadth.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.080
 And we need to show that this is not

34:42.080 --> 34:45.520
 some kind of institutionalization

34:45.520 --> 34:47.920
 of the intellectual dark web, though we

34:47.920 --> 34:52.480
 welcome founding members of that nebulous body.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.440
 It's really something designed for all of academia

34:55.440 --> 35:00.320
 to provide a kind of reboot that I think we all agree is needed.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.840
 Is there a George Washington type figure?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.600
 Is there a president elected yet?

35:04.600 --> 35:07.240
 Or who's going to lead this institution?

35:07.240 --> 35:10.240
 Panos Kanellos, the former president of St. John's,

35:10.240 --> 35:12.440
 is the president of University of Austin.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.400
 And so he is our George Washington.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.040
 I don't know who Alexander Hamilton is.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.640
 I'll leave you to guess.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.880
 It's funny you mentioned IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.

35:21.880 --> 35:28.400
 Have you talked to your friend Sam Harris about any of this?

35:28.400 --> 35:30.760
 He is another person I really admire

35:30.760 --> 35:34.520
 and I've talked to online and offline quite a bit

35:34.520 --> 35:39.240
 for not belonging to any tribe.

35:39.240 --> 35:43.080
 He stands boldly on his convictions

35:43.080 --> 35:46.880
 when he knows they're not going to be popular.

35:46.880 --> 35:51.640
 Like he basically gets canceled by every group.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.320
 He doesn't shy away from controversy.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.040
 And not for the sake of controversy itself,

35:57.040 --> 36:00.240
 he is one of the best examples to me

36:00.240 --> 36:02.680
 of a person who thinks freely.

36:02.680 --> 36:06.000
 I disagree with him on quite a few things,

36:06.000 --> 36:10.640
 but I deeply admire that he is what it looks

36:10.640 --> 36:12.840
 like to think freely by himself.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.360
 It feels to me like he represents

36:14.360 --> 36:16.560
 a lot of the ideals of this kind of effort.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.560
 Yes, he would be a natural fit.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.440
 Sam, if you're listening, I hope you're in.

36:21.440 --> 36:25.680
 I think in the course of his recent intellectual quests,

36:25.680 --> 36:28.120
 he did collide with one of our founders, Heather Haying.

36:28.120 --> 36:31.080
 So we'll have to model civil disagreements

36:31.080 --> 36:32.640
 at the University of Austin.

36:32.640 --> 36:35.000
 It's extremely important that we should all

36:35.000 --> 36:38.920
 disagree about many things, but do it amicably.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.160
 One of the things that has been lost sight of,

36:41.160 --> 36:42.880
 perhaps it's all the fault of Twitter

36:42.880 --> 36:44.360
 or maybe it's something more profound,

36:44.360 --> 36:47.720
 is that it is possible to disagree in a civil way

36:47.720 --> 36:49.720
 and still be friends.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.080
 I certainly had friends at Oxford

36:52.080 --> 36:54.520
 who were far to the left of me politically,

36:54.520 --> 36:56.560
 and they are still among my best friends.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.680
 So the University of Austin has to be a place

36:58.680 --> 37:03.400
 where we can disagree vehemently,

37:03.400 --> 37:06.600
 but we can then go and have a beer afterwards.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.800
 That's, in my mind, a really important part

37:09.800 --> 37:12.840
 of university life, learning the difference

37:12.840 --> 37:15.680
 between the political and the personal.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.080
 So Sam is, I think, a good example, as are you,

37:19.080 --> 37:24.120
 of a certain kind of intellectual hero

37:24.120 --> 37:31.120
 who has been willing to go into the cyber sphere,

37:31.120 --> 37:37.480
 the metaverse, and carve out an intellectual space,

37:37.480 --> 37:42.960
 the podcast, and debate everything fearlessly.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.280
 His essay, it was really an essay on Black Lives Matter

37:48.280 --> 37:50.840
 and the question of police racism,

37:50.840 --> 37:54.360
 was a masterpiece of 2020.

37:54.360 --> 38:01.320
 And so he, I think, is a model of what we believe in.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.880
 But we can't save the world with podcasts,

38:03.880 --> 38:06.840
 good though yours is,

38:06.840 --> 38:11.840
 because there's a kind of solo element

38:11.840 --> 38:15.080
 to this form of public intellectual activity.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.760
 It's also there in Substack,

38:16.760 --> 38:19.880
 where all our best writers now seem to be,

38:19.880 --> 38:22.600
 including our founder, Barry Weiss.

38:22.600 --> 38:26.880
 The danger with this approach is, ultimately,

38:26.880 --> 38:30.400
 your subscribers are the people who already agree with you,

38:30.400 --> 38:32.040
 and we are all, therefore,

38:32.040 --> 38:35.760
 in danger of preaching to the choir.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.160
 I think what makes an institution like University of Austin

38:38.160 --> 38:41.920
 so attractive is that we get everybody together,

38:41.920 --> 38:44.440
 at least part of the year,

38:44.440 --> 38:51.800
 and we do that informal interaction at lunch, at dinner,

38:51.800 --> 38:57.320
 that allows, in my experience, the best ideas to form.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.480
 Intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.480
 Historians often make it seem that way,

39:02.480 --> 39:06.000
 but I've realized over time that I do my best work

39:06.000 --> 39:08.160
 in a collaborative way,

39:08.160 --> 39:10.640
 and scientists have been better at this

39:10.640 --> 39:12.440
 than people in the humanities.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.760
 But what really matters,

39:13.760 --> 39:16.120
 what's magical about a good university,

39:16.120 --> 39:19.520
 is that interdisciplinary, serendipitous conversation

39:19.520 --> 39:21.440
 that happens on campus.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.760
 Tom Sargent, the great Nobel Prize winning economist and I,

39:24.760 --> 39:27.800
 used to have these kind of random conversations

39:27.800 --> 39:31.520
 in elevators at NYU or in corridors at Stanford,

39:31.520 --> 39:34.680
 and sometimes they'd be quite short conversations,

39:34.680 --> 39:38.040
 but in that short, serendipitous exchange,

39:38.040 --> 39:40.520
 I would have more intellectual stimulus

39:40.520 --> 39:44.400
 than in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.280
 So I think we want to get the Sam Harris's

39:47.280 --> 39:51.440
 and Lex Friedman's out of their darkened rooms

39:51.440 --> 39:54.000
 and give them a chance to interact

39:54.000 --> 39:59.360
 in a much less structured way than we've got used to.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.720
 Again, it's that sense that sometimes

40:02.720 --> 40:05.600
 you need some freewheeling, unstructured debate

40:05.600 --> 40:07.280
 to get the really good ideas.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.920
 I mean, to talk anecdotally for a moment,

40:08.920 --> 40:12.000
 I look back on my Oxford undergraduate experience

40:12.000 --> 40:14.680
 and I wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes,

40:14.680 --> 40:18.200
 but intellectually, the most important thing I did

40:18.200 --> 40:22.400
 was to write an essay on the Viennese satirist Karl Kraus

40:22.400 --> 40:27.440
 for an undergraduate discussion group called the Canon Club.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.960
 And I probably put more work into that paper

40:29.960 --> 40:31.440
 than I put into anything else,

40:31.440 --> 40:33.800
 except maybe my final examinations,

40:33.800 --> 40:36.600
 even although there was only really one senior member

40:36.600 --> 40:38.800
 present, the historian Jeremy Cato,

40:38.800 --> 40:41.880
 I was really just trying to impress my contemporaries.

40:41.880 --> 40:45.720
 And that's the kind of thing we want.

40:45.720 --> 40:51.080
 The great intellectual leaps forward, occurred,

40:51.080 --> 40:54.160
 often in somewhat unstructured settings.

40:54.160 --> 40:57.160
 I'm from Scotland, you can tell from my accent,

40:57.160 --> 40:59.560
 a little at least.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.000
 The enlightenment happened in late 18th century Scotland

41:03.000 --> 41:07.280
 in a very interesting interplay between the universities,

41:07.280 --> 41:10.120
 which were very important, Glasgow, Edinburgh,

41:10.120 --> 41:14.560
 St Andrews, and the coffee houses and pubs

41:14.560 --> 41:19.760
 of the Scottish cities where a lot of unstructured discussion

41:19.760 --> 41:24.080
 often fueled by copious amounts of wine took place.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.280
 That's what I've missed over the last few years.

41:27.280 --> 41:32.480
 Let's just think about how hard academic social life has become.

41:32.480 --> 41:37.760
 That we've reached the point that Amy Chewer

41:37.760 --> 41:41.600
 becomes the object of a full blown investigation

41:41.600 --> 41:47.200
 and media storm for inviting to Yale Law School students

41:47.200 --> 41:50.840
 over to her house to talk.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.480
 I mean, when I was at Oxford, it was regarded

41:52.480 --> 41:54.800
 as a tremendous honor to be asked

41:54.800 --> 41:58.040
 to go to one of our tutors homes.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.680
 The social life of Oxford and Cambridge

41:59.680 --> 42:01.120
 is one of their great strengths.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.960
 There's a sort of requirement to sip

42:03.960 --> 42:06.520
 unpleasant sherry with the dons.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.360
 And we've kind of killed all that.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.040
 We've killed all that in the US because nobody

42:10.040 --> 42:13.040
 dares have a social interaction with an undergraduate

42:13.040 --> 42:15.720
 or exchange an informal email in case

42:15.720 --> 42:18.200
 the whole thing ends up on the front page of the local

42:18.200 --> 42:19.520
 or student newspaper.

42:19.520 --> 42:22.960
 So that's what we need to kind of restore,

42:22.960 --> 42:25.560
 the social life of academia.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.400
 So there's magic.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.320
 We didn't really address this sort of explicitly.

42:29.320 --> 42:33.520
 But there's magic to the interaction between students.

42:33.520 --> 42:37.400
 There's magic in the interaction between faculty,

42:37.400 --> 42:38.360
 the people that teach.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.880
 And there's the magic in the interaction

42:39.880 --> 42:41.600
 between the students and the faculty.

42:41.600 --> 42:46.040
 And it's an iterative process that changes everybody involved.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.960
 So it's like world experts in a particular discipline

42:48.960 --> 42:52.880
 are changed as much as the students,

42:52.880 --> 42:56.960
 as the 20 year olds with the wild ideas,

42:56.960 --> 42:59.160
 each are changed and that's the magic of it.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.160
 That applies in liberal education,

43:01.160 --> 43:03.520
 that applies in the sciences too.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.560
 That's probably maybe you can speak to this,

43:05.560 --> 43:08.760
 why so much scientific innovation

43:08.760 --> 43:10.640
 has happened in universities.

43:10.640 --> 43:13.600
 There's something about the youthful energy

43:13.600 --> 43:16.480
 of like young minds, graduate students,

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
 undergraduate students that inspire

43:18.480 --> 43:19.520
 some of the world experts

43:19.520 --> 43:21.960
 to do some of the best work of their lives.

43:21.960 --> 43:25.080
 Well, the human brain we know is at its most dynamic

43:25.080 --> 43:27.240
 when people are pretty young.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.600
 You know this with your background in math,

43:29.600 --> 43:32.960
 people don't get better at math after the age of 30.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.800
 And this is important when you think about

43:36.800 --> 43:39.760
 the intergenerational character of university.

43:39.760 --> 43:44.160
 The older people, the professors have the experience,

43:44.160 --> 43:46.760
 but they're fading intellectually

43:46.760 --> 43:50.200
 from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit.

43:50.200 --> 43:55.200
 And so you get this intellectual shot in the arm

43:55.720 --> 43:59.320
 from hanging out with people who are circa 20,

43:59.320 --> 44:04.240
 don't know shit, but brains are kind of like cooking.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.320
 I look back on the career I've had in teaching,

44:07.320 --> 44:10.560
 which is over 25 years at where Cambridge, Oxford,

44:10.560 --> 44:15.440
 NYU, Harvard, and I have extremely strong relationships

44:15.440 --> 44:19.440
 with students from those institutions

44:19.440 --> 44:23.160
 because they would show up,

44:23.160 --> 44:26.120
 whether it was at office hours or in tutorials

44:26.120 --> 44:28.120
 and disagree with me.

44:28.120 --> 44:31.800
 And for me, it's always been about encouraging

44:31.800 --> 44:34.120
 some act of intellectual rebellion,

44:35.040 --> 44:38.720
 telling people, I don't want your essay to echo my views.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.760
 If you can find something wrong with what I wrote, great.

44:41.760 --> 44:45.360
 Or if you can find something I missed that's new, fantastic.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.040
 So there is definitely, as you said,

44:47.040 --> 44:49.840
 a magic in that interaction across the generations.

44:49.840 --> 44:53.280
 And it's extraordinarily difficult, I think,

44:53.280 --> 44:57.240
 for an intellectual to make the same progress

44:57.240 --> 45:00.120
 in a project in isolation

45:00.120 --> 45:03.280
 compared with the progress that can be made

45:03.280 --> 45:05.840
 in these very special communities.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.560
 What does a university do?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.320
 Amongst other things,

45:09.320 --> 45:13.120
 it creates a somewhat artificial environment

45:13.120 --> 45:15.280
 of abnormal job security,

45:15.280 --> 45:18.560
 and that's the whole idea of giving people tenure,

45:18.560 --> 45:22.640
 and then a relatively high turnover, new faces each year,

45:22.640 --> 45:27.080
 and an institutionalization of thought experiments

45:27.080 --> 45:29.040
 and actual experiments.

45:29.040 --> 45:30.360
 And then you get everybody living

45:30.360 --> 45:31.600
 in the same kind of vicinity

45:31.600 --> 45:34.720
 so that it can spill over into 3 a.m. conversation.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.520
 Well, that always seems to me

45:36.520 --> 45:39.200
 to be a pretty potent combination.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.720
 Let's ask ourselves a counterfactual question next.

45:41.720 --> 45:46.720
 Let's imagine that the world wars happen,

45:47.560 --> 45:49.760
 but there are no universities.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.880
 I mean, how does the Manhattan Project happen

45:53.880 --> 45:58.200
 with no academia, to take just one of many examples?

45:58.200 --> 46:01.200
 In truth, how does Britain even stay in the war

46:01.200 --> 46:02.400
 without Bletchley Park,

46:02.400 --> 46:07.400
 without being able to crack the German cipher?

46:07.400 --> 46:11.800
 The academics are unsung, or partly sung heroes

46:11.800 --> 46:13.360
 of these conflicts.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.960
 The same is true in the Soviet Union.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.600
 The Soviet Union was a terribly evil and repressive system,

46:19.600 --> 46:21.320
 but it was good at science,

46:21.320 --> 46:23.920
 and that kept it in the game,

46:23.920 --> 46:27.840
 not only in World War II, it kept it in the Cold War.

46:27.840 --> 46:32.840
 So it's clear that universities are incredibly powerful,

46:32.840 --> 46:35.560
 intellectual force multipliers,

46:35.560 --> 46:40.200
 and our history without them would look very different.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.440
 Sure, some innovations would have happened without them.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.280
 That's clear.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.240
 The Industrial Revolution didn't need universities.

46:45.240 --> 46:47.520
 In fact, they played a very marginal role

46:47.520 --> 46:49.120
 in the key technological breakthroughs

46:49.120 --> 46:52.200
 of the Industrial Revolution in its first phase.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.240
 But by the second Industrial Revolution

46:54.240 --> 46:55.880
 in the late 19th century,

46:55.880 --> 46:58.040
 German industry would not have leapt ahead

46:58.040 --> 46:59.840
 of British industry if the universities

46:59.840 --> 47:01.680
 had not been superior.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.320
 And it was the fact that the Germans institutionalised

47:04.320 --> 47:07.320
 scientific research in the way that they did

47:07.320 --> 47:11.640
 that really produced a powerful, powerful advantage.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.480
 The problem was that,

47:13.480 --> 47:15.240
 and this is a really interesting point

47:15.240 --> 47:18.160
 that Friedrich Meinlka makes in Die Deutsche Katastrophe

47:18.160 --> 47:19.960
 for the German Catastrophe,

47:19.960 --> 47:24.160
 the German intellectuals became technocrats, homo faber,

47:24.160 --> 47:25.000
 he says.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.160
 They knew a great deal about their speciality,

47:28.160 --> 47:31.920
 but they were alienated from, broadly speaking, humanism.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.120
 And that is his explanation,

47:33.120 --> 47:35.200
 or one of his explanations for why

47:35.200 --> 47:37.800
 this very scientifically advanced Germany

47:37.800 --> 47:41.600
 goes down the path of hell led by Hitler.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.400
 So when I come back and ask myself,

47:43.400 --> 47:47.320
 what is it that we want to do with a new university,

47:47.320 --> 47:52.320
 we wanna make sure that we don't fall into that German pit

47:52.320 --> 47:56.360
 where very high levels of technical and scientific expertise

47:56.360 --> 48:00.440
 are decoupled from the fundamental foundations

48:00.440 --> 48:03.400
 of a free society.

48:04.280 --> 48:05.800
 So liberal arts are there, I think,

48:05.800 --> 48:09.720
 to stop the scientists making Faustian pacts.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.400
 And that's why it's really important

48:11.400 --> 48:15.480
 that people working on AI reach Shakespeare.

48:15.480 --> 48:19.600
 I think you said that academics are unsung heroes

48:19.600 --> 48:21.680
 of the 20th century.

48:21.680 --> 48:25.160
 I think there's kind of an intellectual,

48:25.160 --> 48:30.160
 a lazy intellectual desire to kind of destroy

48:30.160 --> 48:32.640
 the academics, that the academics are the source

48:32.640 --> 48:34.760
 of all problems in the world.

48:34.760 --> 48:37.440
 And I personally believe that exactly as you said,

48:37.440 --> 48:40.320
 we need to recognize that the university

48:40.320 --> 48:45.000
 is probably where the ideas that will protect us

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
 from the catastrophes that are looming ahead of us,

48:50.480 --> 48:52.720
 that's where those ideas are going to come from.

48:52.720 --> 48:56.840
 People who work on economics can argue back and forth

48:56.840 --> 48:58.200
 about John Maynard Keynes.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.720
 But I think it's pretty clear

49:00.720 --> 49:03.200
 that he was the most important economist

49:03.200 --> 49:05.520
 and certainly the most influential economist

49:05.520 --> 49:06.600
 of the 20th century.

49:06.600 --> 49:11.320
 And I think his ideas are looking better today

49:11.320 --> 49:12.960
 in the wake of the financial crisis

49:12.960 --> 49:15.840
 than they have at any time since the 1970s.

49:15.840 --> 49:19.920
 But imagine John Maynard Keynes without Cambridge,

49:19.920 --> 49:24.920
 you can't because someone like that doesn't actually exist

49:24.920 --> 49:27.520
 without the incredible hothouse

49:27.520 --> 49:30.200
 that a place like Cambridge was in Keynes's life.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.720
 He was a product of a kind of hereditary

49:32.720 --> 49:36.160
 intellectual elite, it had its vices.

49:36.160 --> 49:40.160
 But you can't help but admire the sheer power of the mind.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.400
 I've spent a lot of my career reading Keynes

49:42.400 --> 49:47.400
 and I revere that intellect, it's so, so powerful.

49:47.400 --> 49:49.760
 But you can't have people like that

49:49.760 --> 49:53.600
 if you're not prepared to have King's College Cambridge.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.280
 And it comes with redundancy.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.120
 I think that's the point.

49:56.120 --> 49:57.720
 There are lots and lots of things

49:57.720 --> 50:00.520
 that are very annoying about academic life

50:00.520 --> 50:03.320
 that you just have to deal with.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.200
 They're made fun of in that recent Netflix series,

50:06.200 --> 50:07.360
 The Chair.

50:07.360 --> 50:09.720
 And it is easy to make fun of academic life.

50:10.720 --> 50:13.040
 Tom Sharp's Porterhouse Blue did it.

50:13.040 --> 50:17.040
 It's an inherently comical subject.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.520
 Professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric.

50:20.520 --> 50:24.200
 But we've sort of killed off that side of academia

50:24.200 --> 50:29.200
 by turning it into an increasingly doctrinaire place

50:30.440 --> 50:33.040
 where eccentricity is not tolerated.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.280
 I'll give you an illustration of this.

50:34.280 --> 50:37.640
 I had a call this morning from a British academic

50:38.640 --> 50:40.720
 who said, can you give me some advice

50:40.720 --> 50:44.960
 because they're trying to decolonize the curriculum.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.680
 This is coming from the,

50:47.680 --> 50:50.800
 diversity, equity and inclusion officers.

50:50.800 --> 50:54.120
 And it seems to me that what they're requiring of us

50:54.120 --> 50:56.680
 is a fundamental violation of academic freedom

50:56.680 --> 50:59.840
 because it is determining ex ante

50:59.840 --> 51:01.640
 what we should study and teach.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.160
 That's what's going on.

51:04.160 --> 51:08.680
 And that's the thing that we really, really have to resist

51:08.680 --> 51:10.280
 because that kills the university.

51:10.280 --> 51:13.520
 That's the moment that it stops being

51:13.520 --> 51:15.440
 the magical place of,

51:15.440 --> 51:20.240
 being the magical place of intellectual creativity

51:20.240 --> 51:22.040
 and simply becomes an adjunct

51:22.040 --> 51:24.000
 of the ministry of propaganda.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.240
 I've loved the time we've spent talking about this

51:27.240 --> 51:28.920
 because it's such a hopeful message

51:28.920 --> 51:30.240
 for the future of the university

51:30.240 --> 51:33.440
 that I still share with you

51:35.160 --> 51:37.840
 the love of the ideal of the university.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.400
 So very practical question.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.320
 You mentioned summer.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.600
 Which summer are we talking about?

51:44.600 --> 51:48.400
 So when, I know we don't wanna put hard dates here

51:48.400 --> 51:51.160
 but what year are we thinking about?

51:51.160 --> 51:52.600
 When is this thing launching?

51:52.600 --> 51:53.800
 What are your thoughts on this?

51:53.800 --> 51:57.600
 We are moving as fast as our resources allow.

51:57.600 --> 52:01.800
 The goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses

52:01.800 --> 52:03.840
 next summer, summer of 2022.

52:03.840 --> 52:06.720
 And we hope to be able to launch an initial,

52:08.560 --> 52:12.280
 albeit relatively small scale master's program

52:12.280 --> 52:14.480
 in the fall of next year.

52:14.480 --> 52:17.200
 That's as fast as humanly possible.

52:18.360 --> 52:21.000
 So yeah, we're really keen to get going.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.920
 And I think the approach we're taking

52:22.920 --> 52:27.080
 is somewhat imported from Silicon Valley.

52:27.080 --> 52:29.080
 Think of this as a startup.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.120
 Don't think of this as something that has to exist

52:31.120 --> 52:33.840
 as a full service university on day one.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.200
 We don't have the resources for that.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.760
 You did billions and billions of dollars

52:36.760 --> 52:40.040
 to build a university sort of as a facsimile

52:40.040 --> 52:41.120
 of an existing university,

52:41.120 --> 52:42.280
 but that's not what we want to do.

52:42.280 --> 52:45.640
 I mean, copying and pasting Harvard or Yale or Stanford

52:45.640 --> 52:46.840
 would be a futile thing to do.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.200
 They would probably, you very quickly end up

52:49.200 --> 52:50.440
 with the same pathologies.

52:50.440 --> 52:52.240
 So we do have to come up with a different design.

52:52.240 --> 52:54.680
 And one way of doing that is to grow it organically

52:54.680 --> 52:56.000
 from something quite small.

52:56.880 --> 53:01.880
 Elon Musk mentioned in his usual humorous way on Twitter

53:02.120 --> 53:03.600
 that he wants to launch

53:03.600 --> 53:07.600
 the Texas Institute of Technology and Science, TITS.

53:09.400 --> 53:11.400
 Some people thought this was sexist

53:11.400 --> 53:13.920
 because of the acronym, TITS.

53:13.920 --> 53:16.560
 So first of all, I understand their viewpoint,

53:16.560 --> 53:18.640
 but I also think there needs to be a place

53:18.640 --> 53:21.560
 for humor on the internet, even from CEOs.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.800
 So on this podcast, I've gotten a chance

53:23.800 --> 53:26.440
 to talk to quite a few CEOs.

53:26.440 --> 53:29.560
 And what I love to see is authenticity.

53:29.560 --> 53:33.080
 And humor is often a sign of authenticity.

53:33.080 --> 53:36.880
 The quirkiness that you mentioned

53:36.880 --> 53:39.520
 is such a beautiful characteristic

53:39.520 --> 53:42.520
 of professors and faculty in great universities

53:42.520 --> 53:46.280
 is also beautiful to see as CEOs, especially founding CEOs.

53:46.280 --> 53:51.280
 So anyway, the deeper point he was making

53:51.480 --> 53:54.360
 is showing an excitement for the university

53:54.360 --> 53:59.360
 as a place for big ideas in science, technology, engineering.

53:59.600 --> 54:02.960
 So to me, if there's some kind of way,

54:02.960 --> 54:07.520
 if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet,

54:07.520 --> 54:10.920
 not to analyze Elon Musk's Twitter like it's Shakespeare,

54:10.920 --> 54:12.840
 but if there's a serious thought,

54:13.960 --> 54:18.320
 I would love to see him supporting the flourishing of Austin

54:18.320 --> 54:20.360
 as a place for science, technology,

54:20.360 --> 54:22.280
 for these kinds of intellectual developments

54:22.280 --> 54:25.880
 that we're talking about,

54:25.880 --> 54:30.880
 like make a place for free inquiry, civil disagreements,

54:31.640 --> 54:35.840
 coupled with great education and conversations

54:35.840 --> 54:37.880
 about artificial intelligence, about technology,

54:37.880 --> 54:39.280
 about engineering.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.800
 So I'm actually gonna,

54:41.800 --> 54:43.840
 I hope there's a serious idea behind that tweet

54:43.840 --> 54:46.320
 and I'm gonna chat with him about it.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.160
 I do too.

54:47.160 --> 54:48.760
 I do too.

54:48.760 --> 54:53.760
 Most of the biggest storms in teacups of my academic career

54:56.440 --> 54:59.920
 have been caused by bad jokes that I've made.

54:59.920 --> 55:04.000
 These days, if you wanna make bad jokes,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.840
 being a billionaire is a great idea.

55:08.080 --> 55:12.400
 I'm not here to defend Elon's Twitter style

55:12.400 --> 55:14.320
 or sense of humor.

55:14.320 --> 55:18.320
 He's not gonna be remembered for his tweets, I think.

55:18.320 --> 55:19.320
 He's gonna be remembered

55:19.320 --> 55:22.320
 for the astonishing companies that he's built

55:22.320 --> 55:26.720
 and his contributions in a whole range of fields

55:26.720 --> 55:31.720
 from SpaceX to Tesla and solar energy.

55:31.720 --> 55:35.400
 And I very much hope that we can interest Elon

55:35.400 --> 55:36.240
 in this project.

55:36.240 --> 55:40.560
 We need not only Elon, but a whole range of his peers

55:41.640 --> 55:45.160
 because this takes resources.

55:45.160 --> 55:47.400
 Universities are not cheap things to run,

55:47.400 --> 55:49.480
 especially if, as I hope,

55:49.480 --> 55:54.480
 we can make as much of the tuition

55:55.880 --> 55:57.600
 covered by scholarships and bursaries.

55:57.600 --> 56:02.240
 We want to attract the best intellectual talent

56:02.240 --> 56:04.400
 to this institution.

56:04.400 --> 56:05.800
 The best intellectual talent

56:05.800 --> 56:08.360
 is somewhat randomly distributed through society.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.960
 And some of it is in the bottom quintile

56:09.960 --> 56:11.680
 of the income distribution.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.800
 And that makes it hard to get to elite education.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.040
 So this will take resources.

56:17.120 --> 56:22.120
 The last generation of super wealthy plutocrats,

56:22.240 --> 56:25.880
 the generation of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century,

56:25.880 --> 56:28.640
 did a pretty good job of funding universities.

56:28.640 --> 56:33.040
 Now Chicago wouldn't exist, but for the money of that era.

56:33.040 --> 56:35.400
 And so my message to not only to Elon,

56:35.400 --> 56:38.480
 but to all of the peers, all of those people

56:38.480 --> 56:41.160
 who made their billions out of technology

56:41.160 --> 56:44.360
 over the last couple of decades is this is your time.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.760
 I mean, and this is your opportunity

56:45.760 --> 56:47.120
 to create something new.

56:47.120 --> 56:51.120
 I can't really understand why the wealthy of our time

56:51.120 --> 56:53.680
 are content to hand their money.

56:53.680 --> 56:56.600
 I mean, think of the vast sums Mike Bloomberg

56:56.600 --> 57:01.600
 recently gave to Johns Hopkins to established institutions.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.720
 When on close inspection, those institutions

57:05.720 --> 57:10.200
 don't seem to spend the money terribly well.

57:10.200 --> 57:12.880
 And in fact, one of the mysteries of our time

57:12.880 --> 57:14.440
 is the lack of due diligence

57:14.440 --> 57:16.960
 that hard nosed billionaires seem to do

57:16.960 --> 57:19.280
 when it comes to philanthropy.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.720
 So I think there's an opportunity here

57:21.720 --> 57:25.160
 for this generation of very talented, wealthy people

57:25.160 --> 57:29.000
 to do what their counterparts did in the late 19th

57:29.000 --> 57:32.600
 and early 20th century and create some new institutions.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.840
 And they don't need to put their names on the buildings.

57:34.840 --> 57:39.000
 They just need to do what the founders of Chicago,

57:39.000 --> 57:40.440
 University of Chicago did,

57:40.440 --> 57:43.280
 create something new that will endure.

57:45.360 --> 57:49.160
 Yeah, MIT is launching a college of computing

57:49.160 --> 57:54.160
 and Stephen Schwarzman has given quite a large sum of money,

57:54.320 --> 57:56.840
 I think in total, a billion dollars.

57:56.840 --> 57:59.360
 And as somebody who loves computing,

57:59.360 --> 58:02.280
 as somebody who loves MIT, I want some accountability

58:03.520 --> 58:07.040
 for MIT becoming a better institution.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.800
 And this is once again,

58:08.800 --> 58:10.720
 why I'm excited about University of Austin

58:10.720 --> 58:12.240
 because it serves as a beacon.

58:12.240 --> 58:14.400
 Look, you can create something new

58:14.400 --> 58:16.440
 and this is what the great institutions

58:16.440 --> 58:18.320
 of the future should look like.

58:18.320 --> 58:22.440
 And Steve Schwarzman is also an innovator.

58:22.440 --> 58:26.920
 The idea of creating a college on the Tsinghua campus

58:26.920 --> 58:28.720
 and creating a kind of Rhodes program

58:28.720 --> 58:30.080
 for students from the Western world

58:30.080 --> 58:33.400
 to come study in China was Steve's idea.

58:33.400 --> 58:35.480
 And I was somewhat involved,

58:35.480 --> 58:38.600
 did some visiting, professing there.

58:38.600 --> 58:41.520
 It taught me that you can create something new

58:42.480 --> 58:45.120
 in that area of graduate education

58:45.120 --> 58:49.800
 and quite quickly attract really strong applicants

58:49.800 --> 58:52.400
 because the people who finished their four years

58:52.400 --> 58:57.400
 at Harvard or Stanford know that they don't know a lot.

58:57.600 --> 59:02.400
 And I, having taught a lot of people in that group,

59:02.400 --> 59:06.240
 know how intellectually dissatisfied they often are

59:06.240 --> 59:08.040
 at the end of four years.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.280
 I mean, they may have beautifully gamed the system

59:10.280 --> 59:12.520
 to graduate summa magna cum laude,

59:12.520 --> 59:15.760
 but they kind of know they'll confess it

59:15.760 --> 59:16.800
 after a drink or two.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.320
 They know that they gamed the system

59:18.320 --> 59:20.400
 and that intellectually it wasn't

59:20.400 --> 59:22.320
 the fulfilling experience they wanted.

59:22.320 --> 59:26.280
 And they also know that an MBA from a comparable institution

59:26.280 --> 59:29.360
 would not be a massive intellectual step forward.

59:29.360 --> 59:32.240
 So I think what we want to say is,

59:32.240 --> 59:35.240
 here's something really novel, exciting,

59:35.240 --> 59:37.880
 that will be intellectually very challenging.

59:37.880 --> 59:42.360
 I do think the University of Austin has to be difficult.

59:42.360 --> 59:44.040
 I'd like it to feel a little bit like

59:44.040 --> 59:47.000
 surviving Navy SEAL training to come through this program

59:47.000 --> 59:49.400
 because it will be intellectually demanding.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.320
 That I think should be a magnet.

59:51.320 --> 59:54.280
 So yeah, Steve, if you're listening,

59:54.280 --> 59:56.840
 please join Elon in supporting this.

59:56.840 --> 59:59.760
 And Peter Thiel, if you're listening,

59:59.760 --> 1:00:02.160
 I know how skeptical you are about the idea

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:04.680
 of creating a new university because heaven knows,

1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:06.560
 Peter and I have been discussing this idea for years

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.440
 and he's always said, well, no, we thought about this

1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:09.360
 and it just isn't gonna work.

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:14.360
 But I really think we've got a responsibility to do this.

1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:17.000
 Well, Steve's been on this podcast before.

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.800
 We've spoken a few times, so I'll send this to him.

1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:22.200
 I hope he does actually get behind it as well.

1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:26.200
 So I'm super excited by the ideas

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:29.600
 that we've been talking about that this effort represents

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.800
 and what ripple effect it has on the rest of society.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:33.640
 So thank you.

1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:36.240
 That was a time beautifully spent.

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:41.240
 And I'm really grateful for the fortune

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:43.600
 of getting a chance to talk to you

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.320
 at this moment in history

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.800
 because I've been a big fan of your work

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:50.440
 and the reason I wanted to talk to you today

1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:53.960
 is about all the excellent books you've written

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.120
 about various aspects of history through money, war,

1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.560
 power, pandemics, all of that.

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.360
 But I'm glad that we got a chance to talk about this,

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.960
 which is not looking at history, it's looking at the future.

1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:12.400
 This is a beautiful little fortuitous moment.

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:15.280
 I appreciate you talking about it.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.800
 In the book, Ascent of Money,

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:21.560
 you give a history of the world through the lens of money.

1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:24.680
 If the financial system is a evolutionary nature,

1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.160
 much like life on earth,

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:28.720
 what is the origin of money on earth?

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:33.080
 The origin of money predates coins.

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.720
 Most people kind of assume I'll talk about coins,

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:39.120
 but coins are relatively late developments.

1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:41.960
 Back in ancient Mesopotamia,

1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:44.120
 so I don't know, 5,000 years ago,

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:49.120
 there were relations between creditors and debtors.

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:52.240
 There are even in the simplest economy

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.840
 because of the way in which agriculture works.

1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:58.760
 Hey, I need to plant these seeds,

1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:01.440
 but I'm not gonna have crops for X months.

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.440
 So we have clay tablets

1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:07.440
 in which simple debt transactions are inscribed.

1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:09.440
 I remember looking at great numbers of these

1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:10.280
 in the British Museum

1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:12.800
 when I was writing The Ascent of Money.

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:15.840
 And that's really the beginning of money.

1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:18.800
 The minute you start recording a relationship

1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:19.920
 between a creditor and a debtor,

1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:22.520
 you have something that is quasi money.

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:23.520
 And that is probably what these

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:28.520
 clay tablets mostly denoted.

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.520
 From that point on,

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.960
 there's a great evolutionary experiment

1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:36.760
 to see what the most convenient way is

1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:41.760
 to record relations between creditors and debtors.

1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:47.960
 And what emerges in the time of the ancient Greeks

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.640
 are coins, metal, tokens,

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:55.640
 sometimes a valuable metal, sometimes not,

1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:59.320
 usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch.

1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:03.320
 And that's the sort of more familiar form of money

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:07.320
 that we still use today for very, very small transactions.

1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.640
 I expect coins will all be gone

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:12.720
 by the time my youngest son is my age,

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.720
 but the money that I have is still there.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.080
 My youngest son is my age,

1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:21.040
 but they're a last remnant of a very, very old way

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:24.320
 of doing simple transactions.

1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:27.840
 And when you say coins, you mean physical coins.

1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:30.640
 I'm talking about coins have been rebranded

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:31.480
 in the digital space as well.

1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:34.120
 Yeah, not coin based coins, actual coin coins.

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.400
 You know, the ones that jangle in your pocket

1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:38.520
 and you kind of don't know quite what to do with

1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.800
 once you have some.

1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:44.800
 So that became an incredibly pervasive form

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:47.360
 of paying for things.

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:50.000
 Money's just a, it's just a crystallization

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000
 of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.080
 And the coins are just very fungible.

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:58.800
 Whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction,

1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:00.320
 coins are generic and fungible.

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.200
 They can be used in any transaction.

1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:05.040
 So that was an important evolutionary advance.

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:06.360
 If you think of financial history,

1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:08.240
 and this was the point of the ascent of money,

1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:12.520
 as an evolutionary story, there are punctuated equilibria.

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.440
 People get by with coins for a long time,

1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.080
 despite their defects as a means of payment,

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:23.120
 such as that they can be debased, they can be clipped.

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:27.160
 It's very hard to avoid fake or debased money

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:28.760
 entering the system.

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:31.800
 But coinage is still kind of the basis of payments

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:34.200
 all the way through the Roman Empire,

1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:36.960
 out the other end into the so called dark ages.

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:39.400
 It's still how most things are settled

1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:43.880
 in cash transactions in the early 1300s.

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:47.800
 You don't get a big shift until after the Black Death,

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.920
 when there's such a need to monetize the economy

1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:52.440
 because of chronic labor shortages

1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:54.720
 and feudalism begins to unravel,

1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:58.880
 that you just don't have a sufficient amount of coinage.

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:00.240
 And so you get bills of exchange.

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:02.720
 And I'm really into bills of exchange,

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:07.560
 because, and this I hope will capture your listeners

1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:09.360
 and viewers imaginations,

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.240
 when they start using bills of exchange,

1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:17.240
 which are really just pieces of paper saying,

1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:19.360
 I owe you over a three month period

1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:23.880
 while goods are in transit from Florence to London,

1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:27.960
 you get the first peer to peer payment system,

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:29.640
 which is network verified,

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:31.320
 because they're not coins,

1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:33.480
 they don't have a King's head on them.

1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.320
 They're just pieces of paper.

1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:38.320
 And the verification comes in the form of signatures.

1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:42.680
 And you need ultimately some kind of guarantee

1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:46.560
 if I write an IOU to you, bills of exchange,

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:48.320
 I mean, you don't really know me that well,

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:49.400
 we only just met.

1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:52.080
 So you might wanna get endorsed by, I don't know,

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:54.960
 somebody really credit worthy like Elon.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:58.200
 And so we actually can see in the late 14th century

1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.960
 in Northern Italy and England and elsewhere,

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:04.560
 the evolution of a peer to peer network system

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.240
 of payment.

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:09.240
 And that's actually how world trade grows,

1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:11.160
 because you just couldn't settle

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:14.040
 long oceanic transactions with coinage.

1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:15.720
 It just wasn't practical.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:18.320
 All those treasure chests full of the balloons,

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:21.120
 which were part of the way in which the Spanish empire worked

1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:22.640
 really inefficient.

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:26.240
 So bills of exchange are an exciting part of the story.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:29.520
 And they illustrate something I should have made more clear

1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:31.280
 in the ascent of money,

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:34.520
 that not everything used in payment needs to be money.

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:39.000
 Classically, economists will tell you, oh, well, money,

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.320
 money has three different functions.

1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:43.320
 It's you've heard this a zillion times, right?

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:46.280
 It's a unit of account, it's a store of value,

1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:47.760
 and it's a medium of exchange.

1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:51.560
 Now, there are three or four things

1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:53.840
 that are worth saying about this, and I'll just say two.

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:57.120
 One, it may be that those three things are a trilemma,

1:06:57.120 --> 1:06:59.480
 and it's very difficult for anything to be all of them.

1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:01.920
 This point was made by my Hoover colleague,

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:03.440
 Manny Rincon Cruz last year,

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:05.680
 and I still wish he would write this up as a paper

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:07.680
 because it's a great insight.

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.760
 The second thing that's really interesting to me

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.880
 is that payments don't need to be money.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.120
 And if we go around, as economists love to do,

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:17.880
 saying, well, Bitcoin's not money

1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:20.680
 because it doesn't fulfill these criteria,

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:21.720
 we're missing the point

1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:24.560
 that you could build a system of payments,

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:26.840
 which I think is how we should think about crypto

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:29.120
 that isn't money, doesn't need to be money.

1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:30.560
 It's like bills of exchange.

1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:33.600
 It's network based verification,

1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:38.000
 peer to peer transactions without third party verification.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.240
 When it hit me the other day

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.480
 that we actually have this precedent for crypto,

1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:43.560
 I got quite excited and thought,

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:46.560
 I wish I had written that in the Ascent of Money.

1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:48.760
 Can you sort of from a first principles,

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:50.760
 like almost like a physics perspective,

1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:54.160
 or maybe a human perspective,

1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:58.720
 describe where does the value of money come from?

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.520
 Like where is it actually, where is it?

1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:04.720
 So it's a sheet of paper or it's coins,

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:08.080
 but it feels like in a platonic sense,

1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:09.200
 there's some kind of thing

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.160
 that's actually storing the value.

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:13.800
 As us, a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on.

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:17.360
 I come from a family of physicists.

1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:18.560
 I'm the black sheep of the family.

1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:21.120
 My mother's a physicist, my sister is.

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:23.360
 And so when you asked me to explain something

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:27.360
 in physics terms, I get a kind of little part of me dies

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:28.960
 because I know I'll fail.

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:33.000
 But in truth, it doesn't really matter

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.400
 what we decide money is going to be.

1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:41.400
 And anything can record, crystallize

1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:44.640
 the relationship between the creditor and the debtor.

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.360
 It could be a piece of paper, it can be a piece of metal.

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.760
 It can be nothing, can just be a digital entry.

1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:56.440
 It's trust that we're really talking about here.

1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:59.680
 We are not just trusting one another.

1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:02.880
 We may not, but we are trusting the money.

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:07.480
 So whatever we use to represent

1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:10.200
 the creditor debtor relationship,

1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:13.160
 whether it's a banknote or a coin or whatever,

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:16.560
 it does depend on us both trusting it.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.640
 And that doesn't always pertain.

1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:25.080
 What we see in episodes of inflation,

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.880
 especially episodes of hyperinflation,

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:29.920
 is a crisis of trust, a crisis of confidence

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.000
 in the means of payments.

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.920
 And this is very traumatic for the societies

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.880
 to which it happens.

1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:40.000
 By and large, human beings,

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.040
 particularly once you have a rule of law system

1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:44.680
 of the sort that evolved in the West

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.560
 and then became generalized,

1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:49.640
 are predisposed to trust one another.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:52.560
 And the default setting is to trust money.

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.960
 Even when it depreciates at a quite steady rate

1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.960
 as the US dollar has done pretty much uninterruptedly

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:05.080
 since the 1960s, it takes quite a big disruption

1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:07.520
 for money to lose that trust.

1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:11.720
 But I think essentially what money should be thought of as

1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:15.880
 is a series of tokens that can take any form we like

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:18.200
 and can be purely digital,

1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:23.200
 which represent our transactions as creditors and debtors.

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:26.640
 And the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work.

1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:29.840
 I had to explain this to Stephen Colbert once

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:33.520
 in the Colbert Show, the old show that was actually funny.

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:37.800
 And it was a great moment when he said,

1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:41.880
 so Neil, could I be money?

1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:46.880
 And I said, yes, we could settle a debt

1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:50.600
 with a human being that was quite common in much of history,

1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:54.200
 but it's not the most convenient form of money.

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.960
 Money has to be convenient.

1:10:56.960 --> 1:10:58.920
 That's why when they worked out

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:00.840
 how to make payments with cell phones,

1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:04.680
 the Chinese simply went straight there from bank accounts.

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.160
 They skipped out credit cards.

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.120
 You won't see credit cards in China,

1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.760
 except in the hands of naive tourists.

1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:14.280
 How much can this trust bear

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:18.080
 in terms of us humans with our human nature testing it?

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.960
 I guess the surprising thing is the thing works.

1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:25.520
 A bunch of self interested ants running around

1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:27.360
 trading in trust.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.200
 And it seems to work except for a bunch of moments

1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.120
 in human history when there's hyperinflation,

1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:34.280
 like you mentioned.

1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:38.480
 And it's just kind of amazing.

1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:40.440
 It's kind of amazing that us humans,

1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:42.520
 if I were to be optimistic and sort of hopeful

1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:45.000
 about human nature, it gives me a sense

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.240
 that people want to lean on each other.

1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:51.240
 They want to trust.

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:54.840
 That's certainly, I would say probably now,

1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:59.680
 a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists,

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:00.960
 network scientists.

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:03.840
 It's one of Nicholas Christakis's argument

1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:05.760
 in a recent book.

1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:08.960
 I know economic history broadly bears this out,

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:12.160
 but you have to be cautious.

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:17.160
 The cases where the system works are familiar to us.

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:23.560
 Because those are the states and the eras

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:26.480
 that produce a lot of written records.

1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.280
 But when the system of trust collapses

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.480
 and the monetary system collapses with it,

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.040
 there's generally quite a paucity of records.

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:38.240
 I found that when I was writing Doom.

1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.120
 And so we slightly are biased in favor of the periods

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:47.040
 when trust prevailed and the system functioned.

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.840
 It's very easy to point to a great many episodes

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:53.480
 of very, very intense monetary chaos,

1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:55.960
 even in the relatively recent past.

1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:58.760
 In the wake of the First World War,

1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:01.280
 multiple currencies, not just the German currency,

1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:03.560
 multiple currencies were completely destroyed.

1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.880
 The Russian currency, the Polish currency.

1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:08.720
 There were currency disasters all over

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:12.440
 Central and Eastern Europe in the early 1920s.

1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:16.440
 And that was partly because over the course

1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.720
 of the 19th century, a system had evolved

1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:22.640
 in which trust was based on gold

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:27.040
 and rules that were supposedly applied by central banks.

1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.160
 That system, which produced relative price stability

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:35.160
 over the 19th century, fell apart

1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:36.720
 as a result of the First World War.

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.200
 And as soon as it was gone, as soon as there was no longer

1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:44.960
 a clear link between those banknotes and coins and gold,

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:47.280
 the whole thing went completely haywire.

1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:50.040
 And I think we should remember that the extent

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:54.240
 of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.480
 all the way through to the late 1940s.

1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:57.920
 I mean, the German currency was destroyed

1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:00.080
 not once but twice in that period.

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:01.800
 And that was one of the most advanced economies

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:02.760
 in the world.

1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:06.200
 In the United States, there were periods

1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:09.520
 of intensely deep deflation.

1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:12.880
 Prices fell by a third in the Great Depression.

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.280
 And then very serious price volatility

1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.280
 in the immediate post World War II period.

1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:19.960
 So it's a bit of an illusion.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:24.240
 Maybe it's an illusion for people who've spent most

1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:26.560
 of their lives in the last 20 years.

1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:29.480
 We've had a period of exceptional price stability

1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:34.480
 since this century began in which a regime

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:37.800
 of central bank independence and inflation targeting

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:42.360
 appeared to generate steady below 2% inflation

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:43.600
 in much of the developed world.

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:46.440
 It was a bit too low for the central bankers liking.

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:49.120
 And that became a problem in the financial crisis.

1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:52.960
 But we've avoided major price instability

1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.800
 for the better part of 20 years.

1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:56.080
 In most of the world, there haven't really been

1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:59.200
 that many very high inflation episodes

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:00.920
 and hardly any hyperinflationary episodes.

1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:03.960
 Venezuela's one of the very few, Zimbabwe's another.

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:06.480
 But if you take a 100 year view or a 200 year view,

1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:08.600
 or if you want to take a 500 year view,

1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:12.720
 you realize that quite often the system doesn't work.

1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:14.680
 If you go back to the 17th century,

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.640
 there were multiple competing systems of coinage.

1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:19.600
 There had been a great inflation that had begun

1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.560
 the previous century.

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:24.760
 The price revolution caused mainly by the rise

1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:28.960
 and caused mainly by the arrival of new world silver.

1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:31.760
 I think financial history is a bit messier

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.760
 than one might think.

1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:37.600
 And the more one studies it, the more one realizes

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:39.320
 the need for the evolution.

1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:41.960
 The reason bills of exchange came along

1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.000
 was because the coinage systems had stopped working.

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.720
 The reason that banknotes started to become used

1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:50.080
 more generally first in the American colonies

1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:52.320
 in the 17th century, then more widely in the 18th century

1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:56.120
 was just that they were more convenient than any other way

1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:57.320
 of paying for things.

1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:00.480
 We had to invent the bond market in the 18th century

1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:02.200
 to cope with the problem of public debt,

1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.600
 which up until that point had been a recurrent source

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:06.880
 of instability.

1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:10.000
 And then we invented equity finance

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.840
 because bonds were not enough.

1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:16.400
 So I would prefer to think of the financial history

1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:18.920
 as a series of crises really that are resolved

1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:22.640
 by innovations and in the most recent episode,

1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:25.040
 very exciting episode of financial history,

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.240
 something called Bitcoin initiated a new financial

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:31.880
 or monetary revolution in response, I think,

1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:36.080
 to the growing crisis of the fiat money system.

1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:37.640
 Can you speak to that?

1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.680
 So what do you think about Bitcoin?

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.440
 What do you think it is a response to?

1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:46.400
 What are the growing problems of the fiat system?

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:49.400
 What is this moment in human history

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:52.160
 that is full of challenges that Bitcoin

1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:54.160
 and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome?

1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.240
 I don't think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:05.800
 whoever he was, for fear of a breakdown

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:07.400
 of the fiat currencies.

1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:11.200
 If it was, it was a very far sighted enterprise

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:12.560
 because certainly in 2008,

1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:14.320
 when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,

1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:18.080
 it wasn't very likely that a wave of inflation was coming.

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:20.360
 If anything, there was more reason

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.240
 to fear deflation at that point.

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:26.360
 I think it would be more accurate to say

1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:28.800
 that with the advent of the internet,

1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:31.160
 there was a need for a means of payment

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:33.280
 native to the internet,

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:36.280
 typing your credit card number into a random website.

1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:40.240
 It's not the way to pay for things on the internet.

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:43.560
 And I'd rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,

1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:45.160
 the first attempt to solve the problem

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:46.320
 of how do we pay for things

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.800
 in what we must learn to call the metaverse,

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:52.520
 but let's just call it the internet for old time's sake.

1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.040
 And ever since that initial innovation,

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.600
 the realization that you could use computing power

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:01.720
 and cryptography to create peer to peer payments

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.160
 without third party verification,

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:07.160
 a revolution has been gathering momentum

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:08.920
 that poses a very profound threat

1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.240
 to the existing legacy system of banks and fiat currencies.

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:15.600
 Most money in the world today is made by banks,

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:17.760
 not central banks, banks.

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:21.840
 That's what most money is, it's entries in bank accounts.

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.840
 And what Bitcoin represents

1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.040
 is an alternative mode of payment

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:30.280
 that really ought to render banks obsolete.

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:33.560
 I think this financial revolution

1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:37.480
 has got past the point at which it can be killed.

1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.720
 It was vulnerable in the early years,

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.400
 but it now has sufficient adoption

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:45.480
 and has generated sufficient additional layers.

1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:47.400
 I mean, Ethereum was in many ways

1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:48.880
 the more important innovation

1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:52.280
 because you can build a whole system of payments

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:55.000
 and ultimately smart contracts on top of ether.

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.280
 I think we've now reached the point

1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:59.800
 that it's pretty hard to imagine it all being killed.

1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:01.640
 And it's just survived an amazing thing,

1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:03.640
 which was the Chinese shutting down mining

1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:04.560
 and shutting down everything.

1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:09.200
 And still here we are, in fact, cryptos thriving.

1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:13.200
 What we don't know is how much damage

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:16.880
 ill judged regulatory interventions are going to do

1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:19.040
 to this financial revolution.

1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:20.680
 Left to its own devices,

1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:24.200
 I think decentralized finance provides

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:28.240
 the native monetary and financial system for the internet.

1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:32.360
 And the more time we spend in the metaverse,

1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:34.440
 the more use we will make of it.

1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:36.440
 The next things that will happen, I think,

1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:40.360
 will be that tokens in game spaces like Roblox

1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:41.520
 will become fungible.

1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:45.000
 As my nine year old spends a lot more time

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.720
 playing on computer games than I ever did,

1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:49.560
 I can see that entertainment

1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:52.480
 is becoming a game driven phenomenon.

1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:56.640
 And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar.

1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:01.040
 The economics of the internet, it's evolving very fast.

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:02.040
 And in parallel,

1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:04.920
 you can see this payments revolution happening.

1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:08.720
 I think that all goes naturally very well

1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:13.000
 and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process.

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:17.160
 The problem is there are people in Washington

1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:20.400
 with an overwhelming urge to intervene

1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:24.080
 and disrupt this evolutionary process.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:28.280
 Partly, I think out of a muddled sense

1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:31.680
 that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on.

1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:34.280
 If we don't step in, many more will go on.

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.880
 This, I think, greatly exaggerates

1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:39.600
 how much criminal activity is in fact going on in the space.

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.520
 But there's also the vested interests at work.

1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:45.960
 It was odd to me, maybe not odd,

1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:47.080
 perhaps it wasn't surprising,

1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:48.840
 that the Bank for International Settlements

1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:52.040
 earlier this year published a report,

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:55.680
 one chapter of which said this must all go, must all stop.

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:57.520
 It's all gotta be shut down

1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:00.920
 and it's gotta be replaced by central bank digital currency.

1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:02.800
 And Martin Wolf in the Financial Times read this

1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:04.400
 and said, I agree with this.

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:07.280
 And one suddenly realized that the banks are clever.

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.720
 They had achieved the intellectual counterattack

1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:14.760
 with almost no fingerprints on the weapon.

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:18.960
 I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:22.600
 I can't imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:25.200
 that essentially takes all transactions

1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:26.960
 and puts them directly under the surveillance

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.320
 of a central government institution.

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:33.320
 But that suddenly is a serious counterproposal.

1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:39.320
 So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized,

1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:44.040
 technologically innovative internet native system

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:46.840
 of payments that has the possibility to evolve,

1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:51.160
 to produce a full set of smart contracts,

1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:54.120
 reducing enormously the transaction costs

1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:56.080
 that we currently encounter in the financial world

1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:57.760
 because it gets rid of all those middlemen

1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:00.600
 who take their cut every time you take out a mortgage

1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:01.720
 or whatever it is.

1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:03.560
 That's one alternative.

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.440
 But on the other side, we have a highly centralized system

1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:08.400
 in which transactions will by default

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:10.760
 be under the surveillance of the central bank.

1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:12.360
 It seems like an easy choice to me,

1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:14.920
 but hey, I have this thing about personal liberty.

1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:17.760
 So that's where we are.

1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:22.680
 I don't think that the regulators can kill web three.

1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.080
 I think we're supposed to call it web three

1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:26.720
 because crypto is now an obsolescent term.

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:28.160
 They can't kill it,

1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:30.360
 but they can definitely make it difficult

1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:33.520
 and throw a lot of sand into the machine.

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.200
 And I think worst of all,

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:37.680
 they can spoil the evolutionary story

1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:40.680
 by creating central bank digital currency

1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:42.960
 that I don't think we really need.

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:47.440
 Or we certainly don't need it in the Chinese form.

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:51.720
 Do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance

1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:53.320
 to take over the world?

1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:57.040
 So become the primary,

1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:00.480
 you mentioned the three things that make money, money,

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:02.720
 become the primary methodology

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:05.880
 by which we store wealth, we exchange.

1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:07.160
 No.

1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:09.600
 No, I think what Bitcoin is,

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.160
 this was a phrase that I got from my friend,

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:13.880
 Matt McLennan at First Eagle,

1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:15.760
 an option on digital gold.

1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:18.520
 So it's the gold of the system,

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.720
 but currently behaves like an option.

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:22.360
 That's why it's quite volatile

1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:23.800
 because we don't really know

1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:28.800
 if this brave new world of crypto is gonna work.

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:31.240
 But if it does work, then Bitcoin is the gold

1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:33.440
 because of the finite supply.

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:37.280
 What role we need gold to play in the metaverse

1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:38.880
 isn't quite clear.

1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:40.720
 I love that you're using the term metaverse.

1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:41.600
 This is great.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:43.760
 Well, I just like the metaversity

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:48.400
 as the antithesis of what we're trying to do in Austin.

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:52.320
 But can you imagine I'm using it sarcastically?

1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:54.520
 I come from Glasgow where all novel words

1:23:54.520 --> 1:23:55.760
 have to be used sarcastically.

1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:57.560
 So the metaverse, sarcastic.

1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:00.360
 But see, the beauty about humor and sarcasm

1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:03.520
 is that the joke becomes reality.

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.800
 I mean, it's like using the word Big Bang

1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:07.560
 to describe the origins of the universe.

1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:09.440
 It becomes like that.

1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:10.280
 It will.

1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:11.800
 After a while, it's in the textbooks

1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:12.880
 and nobody's laughing.

1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:14.320
 Yeah, well, that's exactly right.

1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:15.360
 Humor is sticky.

1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:18.760
 Yeah, I'm on the side of humor,

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:21.400
 but it is a dangerous activity these days.

1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:25.360
 Anyway, I think Bitcoin is the option of digital gold.

1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:30.360
 The role it plays is probably not so much store of value.

1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:33.840
 Right now, it's just nicely not very correlated asset

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:35.240
 in your portfolio.

1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:36.840
 When I updated the Ascent of Money,

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.120
 which was in 2018, 10 years after it came out,

1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:42.280
 I wrote a new chapter in which I said,

1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:48.200
 Bitcoin, which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble,

1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.320
 will rise again through adoption

1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:54.200
 because if every millionaire in the world

1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:57.840
 has 0.2% of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,

1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:59.960
 the price should be $15,000.

1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:03.360
 If it's 1%, it's $75,000.

1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:06.080
 And it might not even stay at 1%

1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:08.200
 because, I mean, look at its recent performance.

1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:13.040
 If your exposure to global stocks had been hedged

1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:16.280
 with a significant crypto holding,

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.240
 you would have aced the last few months.

1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:23.080
 So I think the non correlation property

1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:26.200
 is very, very important in driving adoption.

1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:28.280
 And the volatility also drives adoption

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:31.040
 if you're a sophisticated investor.

1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:35.520
 So I think the adoption drives Bitcoin up

1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:37.200
 because it's the option of digital gold,

1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:40.080
 but it's also just this nicely not very correlated asset

1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:41.680
 that you wanna hold.

1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:43.920
 In a world where, what the hell?

1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:46.400
 I mean, the central bank's gonna tighten.

1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:48.600
 We've come through this massively disruptive effort

1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:51.640
 of the pandemic, public debt soared,

1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:53.600
 money printing soared.

1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:56.760
 You could hang around with your bonds

1:25:56.760 --> 1:25:59.920
 and wait for the euthanasia of the Rontier.

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:01.840
 You can hang on to your tech stocks

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.760
 and just hope there isn't a massive correction

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:05.160
 or dot, dot, dot.

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.840
 Well, and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:10.680
 to make sure that you have at least some crypto

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:15.680
 for the coming year, given what we likely have to face.

1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:17.720
 I think what's really interesting is that

1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:20.080
 on top of Ethereum,

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:25.080
 a more elaborate financial system is being built.

1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:31.520
 Stable coins are the interesting puzzle for me

1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:34.360
 because we need off ramps.

1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.440
 Ultimately, you and I have to pay taxes in US dollars.

1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:43.400
 And there's no getting away from that.

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:45.560
 The IRS is gonna let us hold crypto

1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:48.000
 as long as we pay our taxes.

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.400
 And the only question in my mind is

1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:54.760
 what's the optimal off ramp to make those taxes,

1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:56.120
 make those tax payments?

1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:01.240
 Probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by Facebook.

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:05.240
 Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:07.440
 Maybe it's some kind of Fed coin

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:12.800
 or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stable coins

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:13.640
 does the job.

1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:16.520
 But we clearly need some stable off ramp.

1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.640
 So you don't think it's possible for the IRS

1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:21.000
 within the next decade to be accepting Bitcoin

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.560
 as tax payments?

1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:24.040
 I doubt that.

1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:25.960
 Having dealt with the IRS now

1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:28.600
 since when did I first come here, 2002,

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:32.240
 it's hard to think of an institution less likely

1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.240
 to leap into the 21st century when it comes to payments.

1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:44.240
 No, I think we'll be tolerated, crypto world will be tolerated

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:46.120
 as long as we pay our taxes.

1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:48.840
 And it's important that we're already at that point.

1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:50.160
 And then the next question becomes,

1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:53.480
 well, does Gary Gensler define everything as a security?

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:56.680
 And do we then have to go through endless

1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:00.120
 regulatory contortions to satisfy the SEC?

1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:03.240
 There's a whole bunch of uncertainties

1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:06.000
 that the administrative state excels at creating

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.120
 because that's just how the administrative state works.

1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:10.480
 You'll do something new.

1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:13.520
 Hmm, I'll decide whether that's a security

1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:15.680
 but don't expect me to define it for you.

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:18.960
 I'll decide in an arbitrary way and then you'll owe me money.

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:21.080
 So all of this is going to be very annoying.

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:25.160
 And for people who are trying to run exchanges

1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:29.200
 or innovate in the space, these regulations will be annoying.

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.960
 But the problem with FinTech is it's different from tech,

1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:33.760
 broadly defined.

1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.960
 When tech got into eCommerce with Amazon,

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:40.320
 when it got into social networking with Facebook,

1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:43.600
 there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate.

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.600
 But welcome to the world of finance,

1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:48.800
 which has always been a jungle of regulation

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:53.440
 because the regulation is there to basically entrench

1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:54.240
 the incumbents.

1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:56.040
 That's what it's for.

1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:59.840
 So it'll be a much tougher fight than the fights

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:04.840
 we've seen of other aspects of the tech revolution

1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:09.600
 because the incumbents are there and they see the threat.

1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:13.040
 And in the end, Satoshi said it very explicitly.

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:15.720
 It's peer to peer payment without third party verification.

1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:18.120
 And all the third parties are going, wait, what?

1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:19.400
 We're the third parties.

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.920
 So there is a connection between power and money.

1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:29.080
 You've mentioned World War I from the perspective of money.

1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:34.080
 So power, money, war, authoritarian regimes.

1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:37.280
 From the perspective of money,

1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:42.080
 do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war,

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:46.200
 can help resist the negative effects

1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:47.920
 of authoritarian regimes?

1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:50.360
 Or is that a silly hope?

1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:57.360
 Wars happen because the people who have the power

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:02.840
 to command armed forces miscalculate.

1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:04.840
 That's generally what happens.

1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:09.400
 And we will have a big war in the near future

1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:12.600
 if both the Chinese government and the US government

1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:17.560
 miscalculates and they unleash lethal force on one another.

1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:20.400
 And there's nothing that any financial institution

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:24.480
 can do to stop that any more than the Rothschilds

1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:26.480
 could stop World War I.

1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:28.880
 And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.720
 with massive international financial influence.

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:36.560
 So let's accept that war is in a different domain.

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:42.200
 War would impact the financial world massively

1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:44.720
 if it were a war between the United States and China

1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:49.560
 because there's still a huge China trade on.

1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:53.120
 Wall Street is long China, Europe is long China.

1:30:54.120 --> 1:30:56.760
 So the conflict that I can foresee in the future

1:30:56.760 --> 1:31:00.120
 is one that's highly financially disruptive.

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:01.560
 Where does crypto fit in?

1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:07.040
 Crypto's obvious utility in the short run

1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:11.040
 is as a store of wealth, of transferable wealth

1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:12.960
 for people who live in a world

1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:15.720
 of transferable wealth for people who live

1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:18.880
 in dangerous places with failing,

1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:21.680
 not just failing money, but failing rule of law.

1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:22.960
 That's why in Latin America,

1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:24.680
 there's so much interest in crypto

1:31:24.680 --> 1:31:26.800
 because Latin Americans have a lot of monetary history

1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:28.840
 to look back on and not much of it is good.

1:31:30.160 --> 1:31:35.160
 So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves

1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:39.280
 is, and this goes back to the digital gold point,

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:43.160
 if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law

1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:44.840
 and weak property rights,

1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:49.400
 here is a new and better way to have portable wealth.

1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:56.200
 I think the next question to ask is,

1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:59.000
 would you want to be long crypto

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:00.960
 in the event of World War III?

1:32:02.200 --> 1:32:03.720
 What's interesting about that question

1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:05.400
 is that World War III would likely have

1:32:05.400 --> 1:32:07.600
 a significant cyber dimension to it.

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:10.200
 And I don't want to be 100% in crypto

1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:13.280
 if they crash the internet,

1:32:13.280 --> 1:32:17.720
 which between them, China and Russia might be able to do.

1:32:17.720 --> 1:32:19.280
 That's a fascinating question,

1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:22.040
 whether you want to be holding physical gold

1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.360
 or digital gold in the event of World War III.

1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:27.160
 The smart person who studied history

1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:29.760
 definitely wants a bit of both.

1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:33.400
 And so let's imagine World War III

1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:35.960
 has a very, very severe cyber component

1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:38.640
 to it with high levels of disruption.

1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:43.480
 Yeah, you'd be glad of the old shiny stuff at that point.

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:47.040
 So diversification still seems like

1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:52.040
 the most important truth of financial history.

1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:53.520
 And what is crypto?

1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:56.600
 It's just this wonderful new source of diversification,

1:32:56.600 --> 1:32:59.800
 but you'd be nuts to be 100% in Bitcoin.

1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:02.040
 I mean, I have some friends

1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:04.040
 who are probably quite close to that.

1:33:04.040 --> 1:33:05.360
 Close to 100%, yeah.

1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:10.360
 I'd mar the balls of steel.

1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:16.880
 Yeah, in whatever way that balls of steel takes form.

1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:20.120
 You mentioned smart contracts.

1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:21.760
 What are your thoughts about,

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:23.640
 in the context of the history of money,

1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:25.640
 about Ethereum, about smart contracts,

1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:30.640
 about kind of more systematic at scale

1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:33.460
 formalization of agreements between humans?

1:33:33.460 --> 1:33:38.460
 Well, I think it must be the case

1:33:40.580 --> 1:33:45.580
 that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant.

1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:51.860
 That when we are confronted with pages and pages

1:33:51.860 --> 1:33:53.820
 and pages and pages of small prints,

1:33:55.340 --> 1:33:58.060
 we're seeing some manifestation

1:33:58.060 --> 1:34:01.180
 of the late stage regulatory state.

1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:03.340
 The transaction itself is quite simple.

1:34:04.700 --> 1:34:08.460
 And most of the verbiage is just ass covering by regulators.

1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:11.360
 So I think the smart contract,

1:34:12.380 --> 1:34:16.020
 although I'm sure lawyers will email me

1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:17.700
 and tell me I'm wrong,

1:34:17.700 --> 1:34:20.380
 can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla

1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:24.080
 and maybe not so plain transactions that we want to do

1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.600
 and eliminate yet more intermediaries.

1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:31.940
 That's my kind of working assumption.

1:34:31.940 --> 1:34:36.940
 And given that a lot of financial transactions

1:34:37.900 --> 1:34:41.740
 have the potential at least to be simplified,

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:45.380
 automated, turned into smart contracts,

1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:48.380
 that's probably where the future goes.

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:49.820
 I can't see an obvious reason

1:34:49.820 --> 1:34:54.100
 why my range of different financial needs,

1:34:54.100 --> 1:34:56.540
 let's think about insurance, for example,

1:34:56.540 --> 1:35:00.940
 will continue to be met with instruments

1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:04.260
 that in some ways are 100 years old.

1:35:05.580 --> 1:35:08.620
 So I think we're still at an early stage

1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:12.420
 of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline

1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:17.100
 how we take care of all those financial needs that we have,

1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:20.020
 mortgages and insurance leap to mind.

1:35:20.020 --> 1:35:23.380
 Most households are penalized

1:35:23.380 --> 1:35:27.100
 for being financially poorly educated

1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:29.660
 and confronted with oligopolistic

1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:31.620
 financial services providers.

1:35:31.620 --> 1:35:35.740
 So you kind of leave college already in debt.

1:35:35.740 --> 1:35:40.340
 So you start in debt servitude

1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:43.380
 and then you got to somehow lever up

1:35:43.380 --> 1:35:45.260
 to buy a home if you can,

1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:47.500
 because everybody's kind of telling you you should do that.

1:35:47.500 --> 1:35:50.380
 So you and your spouse,

1:35:50.380 --> 1:35:53.100
 you are getting even more leveraged

1:35:53.100 --> 1:35:57.400
 and your long one asset class called real estate,

1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:59.540
 which is super illiquid.

1:35:59.540 --> 1:36:03.980
 I mean, already I'm crying inside at the thought

1:36:03.980 --> 1:36:07.540
 of describing so many households financial predicament

1:36:07.540 --> 1:36:09.060
 in that way, and I'm not done with them yet

1:36:09.060 --> 1:36:10.660
 because, oh, by the way,

1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:13.180
 there's all this insurance you have to take out

1:36:13.180 --> 1:36:15.380
 and here are the providers that are willing to insure you

1:36:15.380 --> 1:36:17.740
 and here are the premiums you're gonna be paying,

1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:19.280
 which are kind of presented to you.

1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.220
 That's your car insurance, that's your home insurance.

1:36:22.220 --> 1:36:23.820
 And if you're here, it's the earthquake insurance.

1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:26.460
 And pretty soon you're just bleeding money

1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:30.940
 in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage lender,

1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:35.620
 to the insurer, to all the other people that lent you money.

1:36:35.620 --> 1:36:38.460
 And let's look at your balance sheet, it sucks.

1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:41.220
 There's this great big chunk of real estate

1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:43.660
 and what else have you really got on there?

1:36:43.660 --> 1:36:45.340
 And the other side is a bunch of debt,

1:36:45.340 --> 1:36:48.340
 which is probably paying too high interest.

1:36:48.340 --> 1:36:52.440
 The typical household in the median kind of range

1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:56.040
 is at the mercy of oligopolistic

1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:57.620
 financial services providers.

1:36:57.620 --> 1:37:01.220
 Go down further in the social scale

1:37:01.220 --> 1:37:03.780
 and people are outside the financial system altogether.

1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:07.520
 And those poor folks have to rely on bank notes

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:10.940
 and informal lending with huge punitive rates.

1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:12.100
 We have to do better than this.

1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:15.300
 This has to be improved upon.

1:37:15.300 --> 1:37:17.380
 And I think what's exciting about our time

1:37:17.380 --> 1:37:20.220
 is that technology now exists that didn't exist

1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:22.660
 when I wrote The Ascent of Money to solve these problems.

1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:25.260
 When I wrote The Ascent of Money, which was in 2008,

1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:30.380
 you couldn't really solve the problem I've just described.

1:37:30.380 --> 1:37:31.620
 Certainly you couldn't solve it

1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:32.980
 with something like microfinance.

1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:35.760
 That was obviously not viable.

1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:38.100
 The interest rates were high,

1:37:38.100 --> 1:37:42.020
 the transaction costs were crazy, but now we have solutions

1:37:42.020 --> 1:37:43.980
 and the solutions are extremely exciting.

1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:46.140
 So FinTech is this great force for good

1:37:46.140 --> 1:37:48.820
 that brings people into the financial system

1:37:48.820 --> 1:37:50.900
 and reduces transaction costs.

1:37:50.900 --> 1:37:53.220
 Crypto is part of it, but it's just part of it.

1:37:53.220 --> 1:37:55.880
 There's a much broader story of FinTech going on here

1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:00.640
 where suddenly you get financial services on your phone,

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:03.480
 don't cost nearly as much as they did

1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.100
 when there had to be a bricks and mortar building

1:38:05.100 --> 1:38:08.220
 on main street that you kind of went humbly

1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:10.420
 and beseeched to lend you money.

1:38:10.420 --> 1:38:11.620
 I'm excited about that

1:38:11.620 --> 1:38:14.740
 because it seems to me very socially transformative.

1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:17.660
 I'll give you one other example of what's great.

1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:21.580
 The people who really get sculpted in our financial system

1:38:21.580 --> 1:38:25.800
 are senders and receivers of remittances,

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:29.060
 which are often amongst the poorest families in the world.

1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:32.380
 The people who are like my wife's family in East Africa

1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:34.500
 really kind of hand to mouth.

1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:36.460
 And if you send money to East Africa

1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:39.060
 or the Philippines or Central America,

1:38:39.060 --> 1:38:41.840
 it's the transaction costs are awful.

1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:44.680
 I'm talking to you, Western Union.

1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:47.680
 We're going to solve that problem.

1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:48.760
 So 10 years from now,

1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:51.080
 the transaction costs will just be negligible

1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:53.160
 and the money will go to the people who need it

1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:55.760
 rather than to rent seeking financial institutions.

1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:57.520
 So I'm on the side of the revolution with this

1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:01.240
 because I think the incumbent financial institutions globally

1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.280
 are doing a pretty terrible job

1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:08.040
 and middle class and lower class families lose out.

1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:10.040
 And thankfully, technologically,

1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:11.960
 technology allows us to fix this.

1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:14.120
 Yeah, so FinTech can remove a lot of inefficiencies

1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:15.160
 in the system.

1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:16.800
 I'm super excited myself,

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:20.000
 maybe as a machine learning person in data oracles.

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:24.000
 So converting a lot of our physical world into data

1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:27.160
 and have smart contracts on top of that.

1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:30.520
 So that no longer is there's this fuzziness

1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:34.560
 about what is the concrete nature of the agreements.

1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.760
 You can tie your agreement to weather.

1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:40.760
 You can tie your agreement to the behavior

1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:44.080
 of certain kinds of financial systems.

1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:47.480
 You can tie your behavior to, I don't know,

1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:48.560
 I mean, all kinds of things.

1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:50.080
 You can connect it to the body

1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:53.800
 in terms of human sensory information.

1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:56.120
 Like you can make an agreement

1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:01.120
 that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month,

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:03.360
 you're going to pay me $1,000 or something like that.

1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:04.200
 I don't know.

1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.760
 It's a stupid example, but it's not going to happen.

1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:08.200
 It's a good example, but it's not

1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.840
 because like you can create all kinds of services

1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:11.680
 on top of that.

1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:15.120
 You can just create all kinds of interesting applications

1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:18.800
 that completely revolutionize how humans transact.

1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:24.800
 I think, of course, we don't want to create a world

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:29.640
 of Chinese style social credit

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.480
 in which our behavior becomes so transparent

1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:36.960
 to providers of financial services,

1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:41.960
 particularly insurers that when I try to go into the pub,

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:44.920
 I'm stopped from doing so.

1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:47.240
 Every time you take a drink, your insurance goes up.

1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:51.400
 Right, or my credit card wouldn't work

1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:56.160
 in certain restaurants because they serve ribeye steak.

1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:59.160
 I fear that world because I see it being built in China.

1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:02.960
 And we must at all costs make sure

1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:07.560
 that the Western world has something distinctive to offer.

1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:09.920
 It can't just be, oh, it's the same as in China.

1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:13.600
 Only the data go to five tech companies

1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.920
 rather than to Xi Jinping.

1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:21.720
 So I think that the way we need to steer this world

1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:26.720
 is in the way that our data are by default

1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:31.120
 are by default vaulted on our devices

1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:35.320
 and we choose when to release the data

1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:38.000
 rather than the default setting

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.080
 being that the data are available.

1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:41.120
 That's important, I think,

1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:43.040
 because it was one of the biggest mistakes

1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:45.440
 of the evolution of the internet

1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:50.080
 that in a way the default was to let our data be plundered.

1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:51.160
 It's hard to undo that,

1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:56.080
 but I think we can at least create a new regime

1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.680
 that in future makes privacy default

1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:02.120
 rather than open access default.

1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:07.960
 In the book, Doom, The Politics of Catastrophe,

1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:11.880
 your newest book, you describe wars, pandemics

1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:14.280
 and the terrible disasters in human history,

1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:17.920
 which stands out to you as the worst

1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:21.000
 in terms of how much it shook the world

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.280
 and the human spirit.

1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:27.280
 I am glad I was not around in the mid 14th century

1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:31.160
 when the bubonic plague swept across Eurasia.

1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:36.960
 As far as we can see, that was history's worst pandemic.

1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:38.920
 Maybe there was a comparably bad one

1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:42.280
 in the reign of the emperor Justinian,

1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:45.840
 but there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad.

1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:50.040
 And the more we learn about the 14th century,

1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.360
 the more we realize that it really was across Eurasia

1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:57.720
 and the mortality was 30% in some places,

1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:00.480
 50% in some places higher.

1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:02.760
 There were whole towns that were just emptied.

1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:06.520
 And when one reads about the Black Death,

1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:11.520
 it's an unimaginable nightmare of death

1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:17.040
 and madness in the death with flagellant orders

1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:18.800
 wandering from town to town.

1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:22.760
 Town to town seeking to ward off divine retribution

1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:24.840
 by flogging themselves,

1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:27.000
 people turning on the local Jewish communities

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:28.920
 as if it's somehow their fault.

1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:32.400
 That must have been a nightmarish time.

1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:36.600
 If you ask me for an also random runner up,

1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:41.600
 it would be World War II in Eastern Europe.

1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:46.280
 And in many ways, it might have been worse

1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.400
 because for a medieval peasant,

1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:53.760
 the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution

1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:55.320
 must have been overpowering.

1:43:56.800 --> 1:43:59.400
 In the mid 20th century,

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:04.200
 you knew that this was manmade murder

1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:06.960
 on a massive industrial scale.

1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:10.560
 If one reads Grossman's Life and Fate,

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:12.880
 just to take one example,

1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:15.320
 one enters a hellscape

1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:20.320
 that it's extremely hard to imagine oneself in.

1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:24.800
 So these are two of the great disasters of human history.

1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:27.360
 And if we did have a time machine,

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:30.240
 if one really were able to transport people back

1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:34.800
 and give them a glimpse of these times,

1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:37.400
 I think the post traumatic stress would be enormous.

1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:39.680
 People would come back from those trips

1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:44.400
 even if it was a one day excursion with guaranteed survival

1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:47.160
 in a state of utter shock.

1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.200
 You often explore counterfactual and hypothetical history,

1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:53.680
 which is a fascinating thing to do,

1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:55.840
 sometimes to a controversial degree.

1:44:57.200 --> 1:44:59.720
 And again, you walk through that fire gracefully.

1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:06.640
 So let me ask maybe about World War II or in general,

1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:12.360
 what key moments in history of the 20th century

1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:15.840
 do you think if something else happened at those moments,

1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:18.200
 we could have avoided some of the big atrocities,

1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:21.160
 Stalin's Baltimore, Hitler's Holocaust,

1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:22.840
 Mao's Great Chinese Famine?

1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:28.600
 The great turning point in world history

1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:32.880
 is August the 2nd, 1914,

1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:38.560
 when the British cabinet decides to intervene

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:43.600
 and what would have been a European war

1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:46.000
 becomes a world war.

1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:47.320
 And with British intervention,

1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:50.640
 it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict.

1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:53.240
 So very early in my career,

1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:55.720
 I became very preoccupied with the deliberations

1:45:55.720 --> 1:46:00.720
 on that day and the surprising decision

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.520
 that a liberal cabinet took to go to war,

1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:06.480
 which you might not have bet on that morning

1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:10.680
 because there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members

1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:12.960
 who would be disinclined and only a minority,

1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:15.280
 including Winston Churchill, who wanted to go to war.

1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:16.760
 So that's one turning point.

1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:20.160
 I often wish I could get my time machine working

1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:22.640
 and go back and say, wait, stop.

1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:24.320
 Just think about what you're going to do.

1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:28.920
 And by the way, let me show you a video of Europe in 1918.

1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:29.800
 So that's one.

1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:31.520
 Can we linger on that one?

1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:36.520
 That one, a lot of people push back on you

1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:39.400
 because it's so difficult.

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.760
 So the idea is, if I could try to summarize,

1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:46.440
 and you're the first person that made me think

1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:50.400
 about this very uncomfortable thought,

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:54.360
 which is the ideas in World War I,

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.600
 it would be a better world if Britain stayed out of the war

1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:00.520
 and Germany won.

1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:01.360
 Right.

1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:06.960
 Thinking now in retrospect at the whole story

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:08.000
 of the 20th century,

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.960
 thinking about Stalin's rule of 30 years,

1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:14.560
 thinking about Hitler's rise to power

1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.360
 and the atrocities of the Holocaust,

1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:21.360
 but also like you said on the Eastern front,

1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:25.960
 the death of tens of millions of people through the war

1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:28.600
 and also sort of the political prisoners

1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:30.680
 and the suffering connected to communism,

1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.040
 connected to fascism, all those kinds of things.

1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:37.880
 Well, that's one heck of an example

1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:39.480
 of why you're just like fearless

1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:42.000
 in this particular style

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.120
 of exploring counterfactual history.

1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:47.360
 So can you elaborate on that idea

1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:50.200
 and maybe why this was such an important day

1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:52.160
 in human history?

1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:55.080
 This argument was central to my book, The Pity of War.

1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:58.360
 I also did an essay in virtual history about this

1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:01.160
 and it's always amused me that from around that time,

1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.200
 I began to be called a conservative historian

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:05.520
 because it's actually a very left wing argument.

1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:07.880
 The people in 1914 who thought Britain should stay

1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:10.520
 at the war were the left of the Labour Party,

1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:12.920
 who split to become the Independent Labour Party.

1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:16.080
 What would have happened?

1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:19.920
 Well, first of all, Britain was not ready for war in 1914.

1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:21.080
 There had not been conscription.

1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:23.080
 The army was tiny.

1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:25.600
 So Britain had failed to deter Germany.

1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:27.000
 The Germans took the decision

1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.960
 that they could risk going through Belgium

1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:34.520
 using the Schlieffen Plan to fight their two front war.

1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:37.520
 They calculated that Britain's intervention

1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.480
 would either not happen or not matter.

1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:46.080
 If Britain had been strategically committed

1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:48.920
 to preventing Germany winning a war in Europe,

1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:51.240
 they should have introduced conscription 10 years before,

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:53.440
 had a meaningful land army

1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:55.760
 and that would have deterred the Germans.

1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.280
 So the Liberal government provided the worst of both worlds,

1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.320
 a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene

1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:05.440
 that the public didn't know about.

1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:07.600
 In fact, much of the Liberal Party didn't know about,

1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.520
 but without really the means

1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:11.280
 to make that intervention effective,

1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:13.400
 a tiny army with just a few divisions.

1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:16.040
 So it was perfectly reasonable to argue

1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:19.680
 as a number of people did on August the 2nd, 1914,

1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:21.560
 that Britain should not intervene.

1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:23.520
 After all, Britain had not immediately intervened

1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:27.160
 against the French Revolutionary armies back in the 1790s.

1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:30.440
 It had played an offshore role, ultimately intervening,

1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:32.800
 but not immediately intervening.

1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:35.280
 If Britain had stayed out,

1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:38.400
 I don't think that France would have collapsed immediately

1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:40.360
 as it had in 1870.

1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360
 The French held up remarkably well

1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:44.400
 to catastrophic casualties

1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:47.760
 in the first six months of the First World War.

1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:52.360
 But by 1916, I don't see how France could have kept going

1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.840
 if Britain had not joined the war.

1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.920
 And I think the war would have been over perhaps

1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:59.160
 at some point in 1916.

1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:00.520
 We know that Germany's aims

1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:02.320
 would have been significantly limited

1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:04.480
 because they would have needed to keep Britain out.

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.160
 If they'd succeeded in keeping Britain out,

1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:07.680
 they'd have had to keep Britain out.

1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:09.160
 And the way to keep Britain out was obviously

1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:11.880
 not to make any annexation of Belgium,

1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:14.080
 to limit German war aims,

1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.520
 particularly to limit them to Eastern Europe.

1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:19.120
 And from Britain's point of view, what was not to like?

1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:21.600
 So the Russian Empire is defeated

1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:23.280
 along with France.

1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:27.520
 What does that really change?

1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:29.800
 If the Germans are sensible

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:33.840
 and we can see what this might've looked like,

1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:35.880
 they focus on Eastern Europe,

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:38.440
 they take chunks of the Russian Empire,

1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:40.600
 perhaps they create as they did

1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:44.400
 in the piece of Brest Litovsk,

1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:47.120
 an independent or quasi independent Poland.

1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:49.400
 In no way does that pose a threat to the British Empire.

1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:52.080
 In fact, it's a good thing.

1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:54.400
 Britain never had had a particularly good relationship

1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:56.080
 with the Russian Empire after all.

1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:00.280
 The key point here is that the Germany that emerges

1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:05.000
 from victory in 1916 has a kind of European union.

1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:09.080
 It's the dominant power of an enlarged Germany

1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:12.880
 with a significant middle Europa,

1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:13.800
 whatever you want to call it,

1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:17.360
 customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries,

1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:20.240
 including one suspects, Austria, Hungary.

1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:27.120
 That is a very different world from the world of 1917, 18.

1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:31.040
 The protraction of the war for a further two years,

1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.200
 it's globalization,

1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:35.600
 which Britain's intervention made inevitable.

1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:39.400
 As Philip Zelikow showed in his recent book

1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:43.480
 on the failure to make peace in 1916,

1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:46.040
 Woodrow Wilson tried and failed to intervene

1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.720
 and broker a peace in 1916.

1:51:47.720 --> 1:51:50.800
 So I'm not the only counterfactualist here.

1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:53.400
 The extension of the war for a further two years

1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:56.120
 with escalating slaughter, the death toll rose

1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:00.480
 because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater.

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:04.400
 That's what condemns us to the Bolshevik revolution.

1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:08.040
 And it's what condemns us ultimately to Nazism

1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:13.760
 because it's out of the experience of defeat in 1918

1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:15.600
 as Hitler makes clear in Mein Kampf

1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:19.320
 that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm.

1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:23.920
 Take out those additional years of war

1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:26.160
 and Hitler's just a failed artist.

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:31.160
 It's the end of the war that turns him into the demagogue.

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:34.920
 You asked what are the things

1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:38.880
 that avoid the totalitarian states.

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:39.720
 As I've said,

1:52:39.720 --> 1:52:42.840
 British nonintervention for me is the most plausible

1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:45.760
 and it takes out all of that malignant history

1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:48.280
 that follows from the Bolshevik revolution.

1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:51.000
 It's very hard for me to see how Lenin gets anywhere

1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.320
 if the war is over.

1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:55.280
 That looks like the opportunity

1:52:55.280 --> 1:52:59.800
 for the constitutional elements,

1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:02.600
 the liberal elements in Russia.

1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:05.800
 There are other moments at which you can imagine history

1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:07.480
 taking a different path.

1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:11.160
 If the provisional government in Russia

1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:12.480
 had been more ruthless,

1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:15.960
 it was very lenient towards the Bolsheviks,

1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.600
 but if it had just rounded them up

1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:19.280
 and shot the Bolshevik leadership,

1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:23.520
 that would have certainly cut the Bolshevik revolution off.

1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:27.720
 One looks back on the conduct of the Russian liberals

1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:30.720
 with the kind of despair at their failure

1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:33.240
 to see the scale of the threat that they faced

1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:35.280
 and the ruthlessness that the Bolshevik leadership

1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:38.720
 would evince. There's a counterfactual in Germany,

1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:40.520
 which is interesting.

1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:43.480
 I think the Weimar Republic destroyed itself

1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:48.480
 in two disastrous economic calamities,

1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:50.520
 the inflation and then the deflation.

1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:53.320
 It's difficult for me to imagine Hitler

1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:56.760
 getting to be Reich Chancellor

1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:59.680
 without those huge economic disasters.

1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:02.400
 So another part of my early work explored

1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:06.360
 alternative policy options that the German Republic,

1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:08.360
 the Weimar Republic might have pursued.

1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:12.760
 There are other contingencies that spring to mind.

1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:16.440
 In 1936 or 38, I think more plausibly 38,

1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:19.840
 Britain should have gone to war.

1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:21.640
 The great mistake was Munich.

1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.560
 Hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938,

1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:30.120
 because remember, he didn't have Russia squared away

1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:31.640
 as he would in 1938.

1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:33.880
 As he would in 1939.

1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:38.880
 Chamberlain's mistake was to fold instead of going for war

1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:41.160
 as Churchill rightly saw.

1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:44.360
 And there was a magical opportunity there

1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:45.520
 that would have played into the hands

1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.160
 of the German military opposition and conservatives

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:52.960
 to snuff Hitler out over Czechoslovakia.

1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:53.800
 I could go on.

1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:58.800
 The point is that history is not some inexorable narrative,

1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:01.200
 which can only end one way.

1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:03.720
 It's a garden of forking paths.

1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:08.280
 And many, many junctions in the road,

1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:11.880
 there were choices that could have averted

1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:14.360
 the calamities of the mid 20th century.

1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.360
 I have to ask you about this moment,

1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:18.080
 before you said I could go on,

1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:20.560
 this moment of Chamberlain and Hitler,

1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:24.280
 snuff Hitler out in terms of Czechoslovakia.

1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:29.040
 And we'll return to the book Doom on this point.

1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:32.280
 What does it take to be a great leader

1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:33.640
 in the room with Hitler,

1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:38.640
 or in the same time and space as Hitler,

1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.240
 to snuff him out, to make the right decisions?

1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.760
 So it sounds like you put quite a bit of a blame

1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:49.040
 on the man, Chamberlain,

1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.360
 and give credit to somebody like a Churchill.

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:54.280
 So what is the difference?

1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.400
 Where's that line?

1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:58.920
 You've also written a book about Henry Kissinger,

1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:01.200
 who's an interesting sort of person

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:04.800
 that's been throughout many difficult decisions

1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.200
 in the games of power.

1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:08.520
 So what does it take to be a great leader in that moment?

1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.640
 That particular moment, sorry to keep talking,

1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:12.280
 is fascinating to me,

1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:15.760
 because it feels like it's man on man conversations

1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:17.680
 that define history.

1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:19.600
 Well, Hitler was bluffing.

1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:21.760
 He really wasn't ready for war in 1938.

1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:25.720
 The German economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938.

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:30.720
 And Chamberlain made a fundamental miscalculation

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.360
 along with his advisors,

1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:33.720
 because it wasn't all Chamberlain.

1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.720
 He was in many ways articulating the establishment view.

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.480
 And I tried to show in a book called War of the World

1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:42.800
 how that establishment worked.

1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:46.160
 It extended through the BBC, into the aristocracy,

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:47.000
 to Oxford.

1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:48.080
 There was an establishment view.

1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:49.800
 Chamberlain personified it.

1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.080
 Churchill was seen as a warmonger.

1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:56.280
 He was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938.

1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:59.080
 But what is it that Chamberlain gets wrong?

1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:00.760
 Because it's conceptual.

1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:03.680
 Chamberlain is persuaded that Britain has to play for time

1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:06.800
 because Britain is not ready for war in 1938.

1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:09.800
 He fails to see that the time that he gets,

1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.520
 that he buys at Munich is also available to Hitler.

1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:15.200
 Everybody gets the time

1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:17.000
 and Hitler's able to do much more with it

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.840
 because Hitler strikes the pact with Stalin

1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:23.640
 that guarantees that Germany can fight a war

1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:25.920
 on one front in 1939.

1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:26.840
 What does Chamberlain do?

1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:28.760
 Build some more aircraft.

1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.320
 So the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement

1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:32.800
 was to play for time.

1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:34.120
 I mean, they knew war was coming,

1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:35.080
 but they were playing for time,

1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:39.160
 not realizing that Hitler got the time too.

1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:42.000
 And after he partitioned Czechoslovakia,

1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.760
 he was in a much stronger position,

1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:45.400
 not least because of all the resources

1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:50.400
 that they were able to plunder from Czechoslovakia.

1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:52.720
 So that was the conceptual mistake.

1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:57.200
 Churchill played an heroic role in pointing out

1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:00.960
 this mistake and predicting accurately

1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:04.080
 that it would lead to war on worse terms.

1:58:04.080 --> 1:58:05.680
 What does it take?

1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:10.680
 It takes a distinct courage to be unpopular.

1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:13.640
 And Churchill was deeply unpopular at that point.

1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:16.480
 People would listen to him in the House of Commons

1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:17.760
 in silence.

1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:21.920
 On one occasion, Lady Astor shouted, rubbish.

1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:25.200
 So he went through a period of being hated on.

1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:29.080
 The other thing that made Churchill a formidable leader

1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.800
 was that he always applied history to the problem.

1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:35.080
 And that's why he gets it right.

1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:37.360
 He sees the historical problem

1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:39.880
 much more clearly than Chamberlain.

1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:44.320
 So I think if you go back to 1938,

1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:45.920
 there's no realistic counterfactual

1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:48.000
 in which Churchill's in government in 1938.

1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:49.800
 You have to have France collapse

1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:51.880
 for Churchill to come into government.

1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:56.880
 But you can certainly imagine a Tory elite

1:58:57.240 --> 1:59:02.240
 that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics.

1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:06.320
 They haven't seen this, I guess, problem of conjecture,

1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:08.880
 to take a phrase from Kissinger,

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:13.800
 which is that whatever they're doing in postponing the war

1:59:13.800 --> 1:59:16.640
 has the potential to create

1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:18.760
 a worse starting point for the war.

1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:21.920
 It would have been risky in 1938,

1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:23.640
 but it was a way better situation

1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:27.280
 than they ended up with in 1939, a year later.

1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:28.200
 You asked about Kissinger,

1:59:28.200 --> 1:59:31.200
 and I've learned a lot from reading Kissinger

1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:33.960
 and talking to Kissinger since I embarked

1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:37.120
 on writing his biography a great many years ago.

1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:40.640
 So I think one of the most important things I've learned

1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:46.600
 is that you can apply history to contemporary problems.

1:59:46.600 --> 1:59:49.720
 It may be the most important tool that we have

1:59:49.720 --> 1:59:52.800
 in that kind of decision making.

1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:57.440
 You have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously.

1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:03.360
 And in the moment of crisis, you have to take risk.

2:00:03.360 --> 2:00:08.360
 So Kissinger often says in his early work,

2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:12.240
 the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data,

2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:14.520
 but ultimately the decision making

2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:18.480
 that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data.

2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:19.920
 The problem of conjecture is

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:23.920
 that you could take an action now and incur some cost,

2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:28.720
 an avert disaster, but you'll get no thanks for it

2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:32.120
 because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster.

2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:34.480
 And nobody goes around saying, wasn't it wonderful

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.240
 how we didn't have another 9 11.

2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:40.760
 On the other hand, you can do nothing,

2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:44.120
 incur no upfront costs and hope for the best.

2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:47.440
 And you might get lucky, the disaster might not happen.

2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:52.440
 That's in a democratic system, the much easier path to take.

2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:59.280
 And I think that the essence of leadership is to be ready

2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:02.000
 to take that upfront cost, avert the disaster

2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:03.960
 and accept that you won't get gratitude.

2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:10.360
 If I may make a comment, an aside about Henry Kissinger.

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:15.400
 So he, I think at 98 years old currently has still got it.

2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:17.720
 He's brilliant.

2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:19.000
 It's very, very impressive.

2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.280
 I can only hope that my brain has the same durability

2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:26.080
 that his does because it's a formidable intellect

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:31.080
 and it's still in as sharp form as it was 50 years ago.

2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:34.200
 So you mentioned Eric Schmidt's in his book

2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:37.960
 and he reached out to me that he wanted to do this podcast.

2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:41.320
 And I know Eric Schmidt, I've spoken to him before.

2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:43.160
 I like him a lot, obviously.

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.160
 So they said, we could do a podcast for 40 minutes

2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:52.640
 with Eric, 40 minutes with Eric and Henry together

2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:54.960
 and 40 minutes with Henry.

2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:58.040
 So those are three different conversations.

2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:00.920
 And I had to like, I had to do some soul searching

2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:02.840
 because I said, fine, 40 minutes with Eric.

2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:04.800
 We'll probably talk many times again.

2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:07.520
 Fine, let's talk about this AI book together

2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:09.240
 for 40 minutes.

2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:12.760
 But I said, what I wrote to them is that I would hate myself

2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.640
 if I only have 40 minutes to talk to Henry Kissinger.

2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:18.840
 And so I had to hold my ground, went back and forth

2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:21.160
 and in the end decided to part ways over this.

2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:25.840
 And I sometimes think about this kind of difficult decision

2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:30.840
 in the podcasting space of when do you walk away?

2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:38.960
 Because there's a particular world leader

2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:40.560
 that I've mentioned in the past

2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:43.960
 where the conversation is very likely to happen.

2:02:43.960 --> 2:02:48.960
 And as it happens, those conversations could often be,

2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:53.360
 unfortunately this person only has 30 minutes now.

2:02:53.360 --> 2:02:56.000
 I know we agreed for three hours, but unfortunately,

2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:01.000
 and you have to decide, do I stand my ground on this point?

2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.160
 I suppose that's the thing that journalists

2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:04.520
 have to think about, right?

2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:09.520
 Like, do I hold onto my integrity

2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:11.400
 in whatever form that takes?

2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:12.520
 And do I stay my ground

2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:16.120
 even if I lose a fascinating opportunity?

2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:17.960
 Anyway, it's something I thought about

2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:19.720
 and something I think about.

2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:21.680
 And with Henry Kissinger, I mean,

2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:25.720
 he's had a million amazing conversations in your biography,

2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:27.240
 so it's not like something is lost,

2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:28.880
 but it was still nevertheless to me

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:30.760
 some soul searching that I had to do

2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:34.560
 as a kind of practice for what to me

2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:36.800
 is a higher stakes conversation.

2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:38.880
 I'll just mention it as Vladimir Putin.

2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:41.720
 I can have a conversation with him

2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:44.400
 unlike any conversation he's ever had,

2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:47.800
 partially because I'm a fluent Russian speaker,

2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:49.600
 partially because I'm messed up in the head

2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:50.880
 in certain kinds of ways that make

2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:52.760
 for an interesting dynamic,

2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:54.400
 because we're both Judo people,

2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:58.560
 we both are certain kinds of human beings

2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.120
 that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation.

2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:05.880
 I have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership.

2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:08.360
 You've, in your book, Doom,

2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:12.320
 have talked about wars, pandemics throughout human history,

2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:18.320
 and in some sense, saying that all of these disasters

2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:20.240
 are manmade.

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:23.560
 So humans have a role in terms of the magnitude

2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:26.120
 of the effect that they have on human civilization.

2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:30.200
 Without taking cheap political shots,

2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:32.120
 can we talk about COVID 19?

2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:38.040
 How will history remember the COVID 19 pandemic?

2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:39.880
 What were the successes,

2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:44.880
 what were the failures of leadership of man, of humans?

2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:49.560
 Doom was a book that I was planning to write

2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:52.320
 before the pandemic struck.

2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:55.840
 As a history of the future based in large measure

2:04:55.840 --> 2:04:57.680
 on science fiction.

2:04:57.680 --> 2:04:59.400
 It had occurred to me in 2019

2:04:59.400 --> 2:05:02.360
 that I had spent too long not reading science fiction,

2:05:02.360 --> 2:05:07.360
 and so I decided I would liven up my intake

2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:12.040
 by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction.

2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:14.960
 Because history is great at telling you about the perennial

2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.440
 problems of power.

2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:18.800
 Putin is always interesting on history.

2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:21.200
 He's become something of a historian recently

2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:23.720
 with his essays and lectures.

2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:25.480
 But what history is bad at telling you is,

2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:27.960
 well, what will the effects of discontinuity

2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:29.720
 of technology be?

2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:31.360
 And so I thought I need some science fiction

2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:32.480
 to think more about this,

2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:36.360
 because I'm tending to miss the importance

2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:38.160
 of technological discontinuity.

2:05:39.480 --> 2:05:41.280
 If you read a lot of science fiction,

2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:43.800
 you read a lot of plague books,

2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:46.960
 because science fiction writers are really quite fond

2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:48.520
 of the plague scenario.

2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:50.800
 So the world ends in many ways in science fiction,

2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:52.960
 but one of the most popular is the lethal pandemic.

2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:56.680
 So when the first email came to me,

2:05:56.680 --> 2:05:58.160
 I think it was on January the 3rd

2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:00.200
 from my medical friend, Justin Stebbing,

2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:05.200
 funny pneumonia in Wuhan, my antennae began to tingle

2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:08.520
 because it was just like one of those science fiction books

2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:10.440
 that begins in just that moment.

2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:11.880
 It begins in just that way.

2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:18.840
 In a pandemic, as Larry Brilliant,

2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:20.840
 the epidemiologist said many years ago,

2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:25.440
 the key is early detection and early action.

2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:27.480
 That's how you deal with a novel pathogen.

2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:30.760
 And almost no Western country did that.

2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:33.840
 We know it was doable because the Taiwanese

2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:36.760
 and the South Koreans did it, and they did it very well.

2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:40.560
 But really no Western country got this right.

2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:43.160
 Some were unlucky because super spreader events

2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:45.400
 happened earlier than in other countries.

2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:47.720
 Italy was hit very hard very early.

2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:50.280
 For other countries, the real disaster came quite late.

2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:53.240
 Russia, which has only relatively recently

2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:55.240
 had a really bad experience.

2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:59.760
 The lesson for me is quite different from the one

2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:03.120
 that most journalists thought they were learning last year.

2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:05.640
 Most journalists last year thought,

2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:07.680
 Trump is a terrible president.

2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:10.080
 He's saying a lot of crazy things.

2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:12.640
 It's his fault that we have high excess mortality

2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:14.480
 in the United States.

2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:17.440
 The same argument was being made by journalists in Britain,

2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:19.280
 Boris Johnson, dot, dot, dot,

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:21.680
 Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, dot, dot, dot,

2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:24.960
 even India, Narendra Modi, the same argument.

2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:30.120
 And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.

2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:34.600
 It's true that the populist leaders said many crazy things,

2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.520
 and broadly speaking gave poor guidance

2:07:37.520 --> 2:07:40.760
 to their populations.

2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:43.520
 But I don't think it's true to say

2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:44.680
 that with different leaders,

2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:46.960
 these countries would have done significantly better

2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:50.440
 if Joe Biden had magically been president a year earlier.

2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:52.440
 I don't think the US would have done much better

2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:55.600
 because the things that caused excess mortality last year

2:07:55.600 --> 2:07:57.080
 weren't presidential decisions.

2:07:57.080 --> 2:08:00.960
 They were utter failure of CDC to provide testing.

2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:03.000
 That definitely wasn't Trump's fault.

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.920
 Scott Gottlieb's book makes that very clear.

2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:06.880
 It's just been published recently.

2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:10.200
 We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,

2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:12.600
 which the Koreans did very well.

2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:16.640
 We didn't really quarantine anybody seriously.

2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:19.160
 There was no enforcement of quarantine.

2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:21.120
 And we exposed the elderly to the virus

2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:23.520
 as quickly as possible in elderly care homes.

2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:25.760
 And these things had very little to do

2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:28.120
 with presidential incompetence.

2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:33.120
 So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal importance

2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:34.720
 in a crisis like this,

2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:35.640
 because what you really need

2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:38.120
 is your public health bureaucracy to get it right.

2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:40.560
 And very few Western public health bureaucracies

2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:42.200
 got it right.

2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:45.440
 Could the president have given better leadership?

2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:47.080
 Yes.

2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:49.400
 His correct strategy, however,

2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:52.760
 was to learn from Barack Obama's playbook

2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:55.200
 with the opioid epidemic.

2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:58.040
 The opioid epidemic killed as many people

2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:01.840
 Obama's watch as COVID did on Trump's watch.

2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:03.160
 And it was worse in a sense

2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:05.040
 because it only happened in the US.

2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:06.920
 And each year it killed more people

2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:09.200
 than the year before, over eight years.

2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:12.640
 Nobody to my knowledge has ever seriously blamed Obama

2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:14.760
 for the opioid epidemic.

2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:17.560
 Trump's mistake was to put himself front and center

2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.040
 of the response to claim that he had some unique insight

2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:24.800
 into the pandemic and to say with every passing week,

2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:26.080
 more and more foolish things

2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:29.160
 until even a significant portion of people

2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:32.080
 who'd voted for him in 2016 realized that he'd blown it,

2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:34.160
 which was why he lost the election.

2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:37.920
 The correct strategy was actually to make Mike Pence

2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:41.000
 the pandemic czar and get the hell out of the way.

2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:42.760
 That's what my advice to Trump would have been.

2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:45.720
 In fact, it was in February of last year.

2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:49.000
 So the mistake was to try to lead,

2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:52.560
 but actually leadership in a pandemic

2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:54.080
 is almost a contradiction in terms.

2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.680
 What you really need is your public health bureaucracy

2:09:56.680 --> 2:09:58.360
 not to fuck it up.

2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.440
 And they really, really fucked it up.

2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:02.960
 And that was then all blamed on Trump.

2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:05.400
 Jim Fallows writes a piece in the Atlantic that says,

2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:07.760
 well, being the president's like flying a light aircraft,

2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:09.000
 it's pilot error.

2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.520
 And I read that piece and I thought,

2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:13.160
 does he really after all the years he spent writing

2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:16.160
 think that being president is like flying a light aircraft?

2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:19.160
 I mean, it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft.

2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:22.360
 Being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy

2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.400
 with how many different agencies, 60, 70,

2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:25.920
 we've all lost count.

2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:27.720
 And you're surrounded by advisors,

2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:30.600
 at least a quarter of whom are saying, this is a disaster.

2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:31.760
 We have to close the borders.

2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.520
 And the others are saying, no, no,

2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:34.680
 we have to keep the economy going.

2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:37.120
 That's what you're running on in November.

2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.160
 So being a president in a pandemic

2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:40.960
 is a very unenviable position

2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:45.440
 because you actually can't really determine

2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:47.240
 whether your public health bureaucracy

2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:48.320
 will get it right or not.

2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:50.360
 You don't think to push back on that,

2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:53.120
 just like being Churchill in a war is difficult.

2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.040
 So leaving Trump by an aside,

2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:58.920
 what I would love to see from a president

2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.240
 is somebody who makes great speeches

2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:06.400
 and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy,

2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:08.200
 the public health bureaucracy,

2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:09.760
 to get their shit together,

2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.560
 to fire certain kinds of people.

2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:15.160
 I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm a big fan of powerful speeches,

2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:17.360
 especially in the modern age with the internet.

2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:19.520
 It can really move people.

2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:23.080
 Instead, the lack of speeches

2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:26.000
 resulted in certain kinds of forces

2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:31.360
 amplifying division over whether to wear masks or not,

2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:35.840
 or it's almost like the public picked some random topic

2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:37.640
 over which to divide themselves.

2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:39.800
 And there was like a complete indecision,

2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:41.360
 which is really what it was,

2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:45.200
 fear of uncertainty materializing itself

2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:46.400
 in some kind of division.

2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:48.960
 And then you almost like busy yourself

2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:50.960
 with the red versus blue politics,

2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:52.480
 as opposed to some, I don't know,

2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:55.900
 FDR type character just stands and say,

2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:59.840
 fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing.

2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:02.680
 We're going to manufacture 5 billion tests.

2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:04.280
 This is what America is great at.

2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:05.600
 We're going to build

2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:08.760
 the greatest testing infrastructure ever built,

2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:12.520
 or something, or even with the vaccine development.

2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:15.240
 But that was what I was about to interject.

2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:18.400
 In a pandemic, the most important thing is the vaccine.

2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:19.520
 If you get that right,

2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:21.560
 then you should be forgiven for much else.

2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:22.400
 And that was the one thing

2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:23.840
 the Trump administration got right,

2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:27.480
 because they went around the bureaucracy

2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:28.840
 with Operation Warp Speed

2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:32.220
 and achieved a really major success.

2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:38.240
 So I think the paradox of the 2020 story

2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:43.040
 in the United States is that the one thing that mattered most

2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:44.800
 the Trump administration got right,

2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:47.600
 and it got so much else wrong

2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:49.080
 that was sort of marginal,

2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:50.980
 that we were left with the impression

2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:53.920
 that Trump had been to blame for the whole disaster,

2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:56.360
 which wasn't really quite right.

2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:57.500
 Sure, it would have been great

2:12:57.500 --> 2:12:59.960
 if we did Operation Warp Speed for testing,

2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:02.920
 but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests.

2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.960
 And this brings me to the question

2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:11.740
 that you raised there of polarization and why that happened.

2:13:11.740 --> 2:13:13.960
 Now, in a book called The Square and the Tower,

2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:17.140
 I argued that it would be very costly for the United States

2:13:17.140 --> 2:13:20.720
 to allow the public sphere to continue to be dominated

2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:22.440
 by a handful of big tech companies,

2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:25.280
 that this ultimately would have more adverse effects

2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:27.400
 than simply contested elections.

2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:31.280
 And I think we saw over the past 18 months

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:32.800
 just how bad this could be,

2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:37.720
 because the odd thing about this country

2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:42.260
 is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy

2:13:42.260 --> 2:13:44.920
 and about 20% of people refused to get them

2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.920
 and still do refuse for reasons that seem best explained

2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:54.200
 in terms of the anti vaccine network,

2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:56.920
 which has been embedded on the internet for a long time,

2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:58.620
 predating the pandemic.

2:13:58.620 --> 2:14:02.480
 Renny DiResta wrote about this pre 2020.

2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:04.760
 And this anti vaccine network has turned out

2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.000
 to kill maybe 200,000 Americans

2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:08.220
 who could have been vaccinated,

2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:11.080
 but were persuaded through magical thinking

2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:14.000
 that the vaccine was riskier than the virus.

2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000
 Whereas you don't need to be an epidemiologist,

2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:18.400
 you don't need to be a medical scientist

2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:20.640
 to know that the virus is about two orders

2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:22.760
 of magnitude riskier than the vaccine.

2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:28.880
 So again, leadership could definitely have been better.

2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.520
 But the politicization of everything

2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:35.440
 was not Trump's doing alone.

2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:39.760
 It happened because our public sphere has been dominated

2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:43.920
 by a handful of platforms whose business model

2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:46.040
 inherently promotes polarization,

2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:49.080
 inherently promotes fake news and extreme views,

2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:51.380
 because those are the things that get the eyeballs

2:14:51.380 --> 2:14:53.180
 on the screens and sell the ads.

2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:55.120
 I mean, this is now a commonplace.

2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:57.300
 But when one thinks about the cost

2:14:57.300 --> 2:15:01.840
 of allowing this kind of thing to happen,

2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:04.120
 it's now a very high human cost.

2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:06.960
 And we were foolish to leave uncorrected

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.280
 these structural problems in the public sphere

2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:12.800
 that were already very clearly visible in 2016.

2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.080
 And you described that, like you mentioned,

2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:18.280
 that there's these networks that are almost like

2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:22.820
 laying dormant, waiting for their time in the sun,

2:15:22.820 --> 2:15:25.360
 and they stepped forward in this case.

2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:30.120
 And that those network effects just disservice catalyst

2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:34.460
 for whatever the bad parts of human nature.

2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:36.360
 I do hope that there's kinds of networks

2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.720
 that emphasize the better angels of our nature,

2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:40.800
 to quote Steven Pinker.

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:43.560
 It's just clearly, and we know this

2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:46.400
 from all the revelations of the Facebook whistleblower,

2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:49.800
 there is clearly a very clear tension

2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:54.160
 between the business model of a company like Facebook

2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:57.720
 and the public good, and they know that.

2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:00.320
 I just talked to the founder of Instagram.

2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:03.880
 Yes, that's the case, but it's not,

2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:06.280
 from a technology perspective,

2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:08.560
 absolutely true of any kind of social network.

2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:09.900
 I think it's possible to build,

2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:12.080
 actually I think it's not just possible,

2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.020
 I think it's pretty easy if you set that as the goal,

2:16:15.020 --> 2:16:16.840
 to build social networks

2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:20.680
 that don't have these negative effects.

2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:25.680
 Right, but if the business model is we sell ads,

2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:30.200
 and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement,

2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:31.680
 then the algorithm is biased

2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:33.880
 in favor of fake news and extreme views.

2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:36.560
 So it's not the ads, a lot of people blame the ads.

2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:40.360
 The problem I think is the engagement,

2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:42.040
 and the engagement is just the easiest,

2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:43.880
 the dumbest way to sell the ads.

2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:46.120
 I think there's much different metrics

2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:48.760
 that could be used to make a lot more money

2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:50.960
 than the engagement in the long term.

2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:53.440
 It has more to do with planning for the long term,

2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:56.680
 so optimizing the selling of ads

2:16:56.680 --> 2:17:01.680
 to make people happy with themselves in the long term,

2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:06.680
 as opposed to some kind of addicted like dopamine feeling.

2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:09.960
 And so that's, to me that has to do with metrics

2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:11.320
 and measuring things correctly

2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:13.520
 and sort of also creating a culture

2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:16.760
 with what's valued to have difficult conversations

2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:18.400
 about what we're doing with society,

2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:19.560
 all those kinds of things.

2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:22.000
 And I think once you have those conversations,

2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:23.800
 this takes us back to the University of Austin,

2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:27.060
 kind of once you have those difficult human conversations,

2:17:27.060 --> 2:17:30.000
 you can design the technology that will actually make

2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.560
 for help people grow,

2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:34.240
 become the best version of themselves,

2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:36.840
 help them be happy in the long term.

2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.880
 What gives you hope about the future?

2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:44.520
 As somebody who studied some of the darker moments

2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:46.960
 of human history, what gives you hope?

2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:50.220
 A couple of things.

2:17:52.540 --> 2:17:56.520
 First of all, the United States

2:17:56.520 --> 2:17:58.860
 has a very unique operating system.

2:17:58.860 --> 2:18:02.200
 Which was very well designed by the founders

2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:03.640
 who'd thought a lot about history

2:18:03.640 --> 2:18:07.880
 and realized it would take quite a novel design

2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:10.920
 to prevent the republic going the way of all republics

2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.920
 because republics tend to end up as tyrannies

2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:14.980
 for reasons that were well established

2:18:14.980 --> 2:18:16.920
 by the time of the Renaissance.

2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:20.680
 And it gives me hope that this design has worked very well

2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:25.580
 and withstood an enormous stress test in the last year.

2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:30.580
 I became an American in 2018, I think one of the most

2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:34.440
 important features of this operating system

2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:37.680
 is that it is the magnet for talent.

2:18:38.860 --> 2:18:43.860
 Here we sit, part of the immigration story

2:18:45.640 --> 2:18:50.040
 in a darkened room with funny accents.

2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:54.480
 A Scot and a Russian walk into a recording studio

2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:58.000
 and talk about America, it's very much like a joke.

2:18:58.000 --> 2:18:59.800
 And Elon's a South African and so on,

2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:00.760
 and Teal is a German.

2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:03.760
 And we're extraordinarily fortunate

2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:06.000
 that the natives let us come and play

2:19:07.140 --> 2:19:09.760
 and play in a way that we could not

2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:12.040
 in our countries of birth.

2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:14.360
 And as long as the United States continues

2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:18.760
 to exploit that superpower, that it is the talent magnet,

2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:20.760
 then it should out innovate

2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:24.300
 the totalitarian competition every time.

2:19:24.300 --> 2:19:29.300
 So that's one reason for being an optimist.

2:19:30.460 --> 2:19:33.200
 Another reason, and it's quite a historical reason

2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:34.740
 as you would expect from me.

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:39.040
 Another reason that I'm optimistic

2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:44.040
 is that my kids give me a great deal of hope.

2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:48.720
 They range in age from 27 down to four,

2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:52.760
 but each of them in their different way

2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:57.760
 seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours

2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:03.800
 without losing contact with that culture

2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:08.080
 and civilization that I hold dear.

2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:10.040
 I don't want to live in the metaverse

2:20:10.040 --> 2:20:12.660
 as Mark Zuckerberg imagines it.

2:20:12.660 --> 2:20:14.940
 To me, that's a kind of ghastly hell.

2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:20.920
 I think Western civilization is the best civilization.

2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:23.860
 And I think that almost all the truths

2:20:23.860 --> 2:20:26.400
 about the human condition can be found

2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:32.440
 in Western literature, art, and music.

2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:36.960
 And I think also that the civilization

2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:38.960
 that produced the scientific revolution

2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:42.840
 has produced the great problem solving tool

2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:44.640
 that eluded the other civilizations

2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:47.480
 that never really cracked science.

2:20:47.480 --> 2:20:50.720
 And what gives me hope is that

2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:53.600
 despite all the temptations and distractions

2:20:53.600 --> 2:20:57.440
 that their generation had to contend with,

2:20:57.440 --> 2:20:58.920
 my children in their different ways

2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:03.040
 have found their way to literature

2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:08.040
 and to art and to music, and they are civilized.

2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.040
 And I don't claim much of the credit for that,

2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:15.160
 I've done my best,

2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:17.880
 but I think it's deeply encouraging

2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:21.580
 that they found their way to the things

2:21:21.580 --> 2:21:25.200
 that I think are indispensable for a happy life,

2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:26.560
 a fulfilled life.

2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:29.120
 Nobody, I think, can be truly fulfilled

2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:32.100
 if they're cut off from the great body

2:21:32.100 --> 2:21:34.320
 of Western literature, for example.

2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:38.240
 I've thought a lot about Elon's argument

2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:40.180
 that we might be in a simulation.

2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:44.980
 No, no, there is a simulation, it's called literature.

2:21:44.980 --> 2:21:49.160
 And we just have to decide whether or not to enter it.

2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:53.320
 I'm currently in the midst of the later stages

2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:57.360
 of Proust's great A l´heure échec du temps perdu,

2:21:57.360 --> 2:22:01.480
 and Proust's observation of human relationships

2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:05.720
 is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer.

2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:09.520
 And it's impossible not to find yourself identifying

2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.440
 with Marcel and his obsessive, jealous relationships,

2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:16.080
 particularly with Albertine.

2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:18.480
 It's the simulation.

2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:23.480
 And you decide, I think, as a sentient being,

2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:26.960
 how far to, in your own life,

2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:30.480
 reenact these more profound experiences

2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:31.960
 that others have written down.

2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:34.320
 One of my earliest literary simulations

2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:37.480
 was to reenact Jack Kerouac's Trippin on the Road

2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:40.680
 when I was 17, culminating in getting very wasted

2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:44.840
 in the Hanging Gardens of Xochimilco, not to be missed.

2:22:44.840 --> 2:22:48.720
 And it hit me, just as I was reading Proust,

2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:51.160
 that that's really how to live a rich life,

2:22:51.160 --> 2:22:53.720
 that one lives life, but one lives it

2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:56.280
 juxtaposing one's own experience

2:22:56.280 --> 2:23:00.440
 against the more refined experiences of the great writers.

2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:03.000
 So it gives me hope that my children do that a bit.

2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:09.400
 Do you include the Russian authors in the canon?

2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:11.680
 Yes, I don't read Russian,

2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.880
 but I was entirely obsessed

2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:17.160
 with Russian literature as a schoolboy.

2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:22.160
 I read my way through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev,

2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:24.840
 I, Chekhov.

2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:29.840
 I think of all of those writers,

2:23:29.960 --> 2:23:31.600
 Tolstoy had the biggest impact

2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.340
 because at the end of War and Peace,

2:23:33.340 --> 2:23:36.020
 there's this great essay on historical determinism,

2:23:36.020 --> 2:23:39.680
 which I think was the reason I became a historian.

2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:44.680
 But I'm really temperamentally a kind of Turgenev person,

2:23:46.940 --> 2:23:48.140
 oddly enough.

2:23:48.140 --> 2:23:51.060
 I think if you haven't read those novelists,

2:23:51.060 --> 2:23:54.160
 I mean, you can't really be a complete human being

2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:57.740
 if you haven't read the Brothers Karamazov.

2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:00.960
 You're not really, you're not grown up.

2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:02.840
 And so I think in many ways,

2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:05.960
 those are the greatest novels.

2:24:05.960 --> 2:24:09.440
 Raskolnikov, remember Raskolnikov's Nightmare

2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:12.240
 at the end of Crime and Punishment,

2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:15.320
 in which he imagines in his dream

2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:19.420
 a world in which a terrible virus spreads.

2:24:19.420 --> 2:24:20.640
 Do you remember this?

2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:23.560
 And this virus has the effect of making every individual

2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:26.740
 think that what he believes is right.

2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:31.960
 And in this self righteousness,

2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:36.920
 people fall on one another and commit appalling violence.

2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:39.580
 That's Raskolnikov's Nightmare, and it's a prophecy.

2:24:39.580 --> 2:24:43.080
 It's a terrible prophecy of Russia's future.

2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:47.800
 Yeah, and coupled with that is probably the,

2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:50.520
 I also like the French, the existentialists, all that.

2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:53.880
 The full spectrum and German's Hermann Hesse

2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:57.100
 and just that range of human thought

2:24:57.100 --> 2:24:58.680
 as expressed in the literature is fascinating.

2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.460
 I really love your idea that the simulation,

2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:08.200
 like one way to live life

2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:11.840
 is to kind of explore these other worlds

2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:14.940
 and borrow from them wisdom

2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:17.560
 that you then just map onto your own lives.

2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:20.120
 You almost like stitch together your life

2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:22.360
 with these kind of pieces from literature.

2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:27.360
 The highly educated person is constantly struck by illusion.

2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:32.360
 Everything is an illusion to something that one has read.

2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:34.880
 And that is the simulation.

2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:38.200
 That's what the real metaverse is.

2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:42.040
 It's the imaginary world that we enter when we read,

2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:45.780
 empathize, and then recognize in our daily lives

2:25:45.780 --> 2:25:48.960
 some scrap of the shared experience

2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:51.020
 that literature gives us.

2:25:51.020 --> 2:25:54.320
 Yeah, I think I've aspired to be the idiot

2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:57.280
 from Prince Mishkin from Dostoevsky

2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:59.800
 and in aspiring to be that,

2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:04.380
 I have become the idiot, I feel, at least in part.

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:09.240
 What, you mentioned the human condition,

2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:12.400
 does love have to do?

2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.080
 What role does it play in the human condition?

2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:16.900
 Friendship, love.

2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:24.160
 Love is the drug.

2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:29.160
 Love is, this was the great Roxy music line

2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:33.980
 that Brian Ferry wrote.

2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:37.320
 And love is the most powerful

2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:39.820
 and dangerous of all the drugs.

2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:46.120
 The driving force that overrides our reason.

2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:51.120
 And of course, it is the primal urge.

2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:57.120
 So what a civilized society has to do

2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:00.800
 is to prevent that drug, that primal force

2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.680
 from creating mayhem.

2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:08.000
 So there have to be rules like monogamy

2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:13.000
 and rituals like marriage that reign love in.

2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:18.000
 And make the addicts at least more or less under control.

2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:26.000
 And I think that's part of why I'm a romantic

2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.000
 rather than a Steve Pinker, enlightenment rationalist.

2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:37.320
 Because the romantics realized that love was the drug.

2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:39.120
 It's like,

2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.120
 the difference in sensibility between Handel and Wagner.

2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:49.160
 And I had a Wagnerian phase when I was an undergraduate.

2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:52.520
 And I still remember thinking that in,

2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:56.560
 as old as Lieberstod,

2:27:56.560 --> 2:27:59.000
 that Wagner had got the closest to sex

2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:03.280
 that anybody had ever got in music,

2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:05.120
 or perhaps to love.

2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.120
 I'm lucky that I love my wife and that we were,

2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:17.360
 by the time we met, you know, smart enough to understand

2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:22.080
 that love is a drug that you have to kind of take

2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:25.520
 in certain careful ways.

2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:30.520
 And that it works best in the context of a stable relationship

2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:35.520
 it works best in the context of a stable family.

2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:38.200
 That's the key thing.

2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:40.560
 That one has to sort of take the drug

2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:44.400
 and then submit to the conventions

2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:47.360
 of marriage and family life.

2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:52.360
 I think in that respect, I'm a kind of tamed romantic.

2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:56.680
 Tamed romantic.

2:28:56.680 --> 2:28:58.000
 That's how I'd like to think of myself.

2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.040
 The degree to which your romanticism is tamed

2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:03.320
 can be then channeled into productive work.

2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:05.560
 That's why you are a historian and a writer

2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:08.040
 is the best that love is channeled through the writing.

2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:09.760
 So if you're going to be addicted to anything,

2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:11.160
 be addicted to work.

2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:13.600
 I mean, we're all addictive,

2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:15.680
 but the thing about workaholism

2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:17.800
 is that it is the most productive addiction.

2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:22.880
 And rather that than drugs or booze.

2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:27.480
 So yes, I'm always trying to channel my anxieties

2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:28.800
 into work.

2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:31.320
 I learned that at a relatively early age,

2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:33.640
 it's a sort of massively productive way

2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:36.560
 of coping with the inner demons.

2:29:36.560 --> 2:29:39.360
 And again, we should teach kids that

2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:42.960
 because let's come back to our earlier conversation

2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:43.800
 about universities.

2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:45.120
 Part of what happens at university

2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:49.400
 is that adolescents have to overcome all the inner demons.

2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:52.760
 And these include deep insecurity

2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:55.600
 about one's appearance, about one's intellect,

2:29:55.600 --> 2:29:58.240
 and then madly raging hormones

2:29:58.240 --> 2:30:00.520
 that cause you to behave like a complete fool

2:30:00.520 --> 2:30:03.120
 with the people to whom you're sexually attracted.

2:30:03.120 --> 2:30:05.520
 All of this is going on in the university.

2:30:05.520 --> 2:30:07.080
 How can it be a safe space?

2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:09.920
 It's a completely dangerous space by definition.

2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:13.560
 So yeah, I learned teaching young people

2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:15.560
 how to manage these storms,

2:30:16.920 --> 2:30:18.120
 that's part of the job.

2:30:18.120 --> 2:30:20.800
 And we're really not allowed to do that anymore

2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.120
 because we can't talk about these things

2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:24.680
 for fear of the Title IX officers kicking down the door

2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:26.880
 and dragging us off in chains.

2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:28.760
 And like you said, hard work

2:30:28.760 --> 2:30:32.880
 and something you call work ethic in civilization

2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:39.320
 is a pretty effective way to achieve, I think,

2:30:39.320 --> 2:30:42.120
 a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety.

2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:45.120
 Or at least exhaustion so that you sleep well.

2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:49.320
 Well, there is beauty to the exhaustion too.

2:30:49.320 --> 2:30:52.600
 That's why running, there's manual work

2:30:52.600 --> 2:30:55.280
 that some part of us is built for that.

2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:56.120
 Right.

2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:59.560
 I mean, we are products of evolution

2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:03.480
 and our adaptation to a technological world

2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:04.720
 is a very imperfect one.

2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:09.160
 So hence the kind of masochistic urge to run.

2:31:11.080 --> 2:31:14.160
 I like outdoor exercise.

2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:16.240
 I don't really like gyms.

2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:21.240
 So I'll go for long punishing runs in woodland,

2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:24.280
 hike up hills.

2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:27.920
 I like swimming in lakes and in the sea

2:31:27.920 --> 2:31:32.720
 because there just has to be that physical activity

2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:34.680
 in order to do the good mental work.

2:31:34.680 --> 2:31:38.880
 And so it's all about trying to do the best work.

2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:42.440
 That's my sense that we have

2:31:43.760 --> 2:31:45.760
 some random allocation of talent.

2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:47.320
 You kind of figure out what it is

2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:48.960
 that you're relatively good at

2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:51.240
 and you try to do that well.

2:31:51.240 --> 2:31:55.120
 I think my father encouraged me to think that way.

2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:58.520
 And you don't mind about being average at the other stuff.

2:31:58.520 --> 2:31:59.680
 The kind of sick thing

2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:01.280
 is to try to be brilliant at everything.

2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:02.760
 I hate those people.

2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:04.960
 Should really not worry too much

2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:08.480
 if you're just an average double bass player, which I am,

2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:12.160
 or kind of average skier, which I definitely am.

2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:13.560
 Doing those things okay

2:32:13.560 --> 2:32:16.640
 is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life.

2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:19.000
 I was not a good actor,

2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:22.800
 but I got a lot out of acting as an undergraduate.

2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:25.680
 Turned out after three years of experimentation at Oxford

2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:27.720
 that I was, broadly speaking,

2:32:27.720 --> 2:32:32.720
 better at writing history essays than my peers.

2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:34.280
 And that was my edge.

2:32:34.280 --> 2:32:35.800
 That was my comparative advantage.

2:32:35.800 --> 2:32:37.840
 And so I've just tried to make a living

2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:40.280
 from that slight edge.

2:32:40.280 --> 2:32:43.640
 Yeah, that's a beautiful way to describe a life.

2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:46.440
 Is there a meaning to this thing?

2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:47.920
 Is there a meaning to life?

2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:49.880
 What is the meaning of life?

2:32:49.880 --> 2:32:53.480
 I was brought up by a physicist and a physician.

2:32:54.360 --> 2:32:56.560
 They were more or less committed atheists

2:32:56.560 --> 2:32:58.360
 who had left the Church of Scotland

2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:02.200
 as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.

2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:05.600
 And so my sister and I were told from an early age

2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:10.600
 life was a cosmic accident, and that was it.

2:33:10.600 --> 2:33:15.600
 There was no great meaning to it, and I can't really

2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:19.840
 get past that.

2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:24.440
 Isn't there beauty to being an accident at a cosmic scale?

2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:27.840
 Yes, I wasn't taught to feel negative about that.

2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:32.360
 And if anything, it was a frivolous insight

2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.840
 that the whole thing was a kind of joke.

2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:39.840
 And I think that atheism isn't really a basis

2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:45.440
 for ordering a society, but it's been all right for me.

2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:51.720
 I don't have a kind of sense of a missing religious faith.

2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:58.440
 For me, however, there's clearly some embedded

2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:03.800
 Christian ethics in the way my parents lived.

2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:08.360
 And so we were kind of atheist Calvinists

2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:11.520
 who had kind of deposed God, but carried on behaving

2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:14.280
 as if we were members of the elect in a moral universe.

2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.280
 So that's kind of the state of mind that I was left in.

2:34:21.160 --> 2:34:26.160
 And I think that we aren't really around long enough

2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:31.960
 to claim that our individual lives have meaning.

2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:35.720
 But what Edmund Burke said is true.

2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:38.640
 The real social contract is between the generations,

2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:41.120
 between the dead, the living, and the unborn.

2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:45.720
 And the meaning of life is, for me at least,

2:34:45.720 --> 2:34:48.120
 to live in a way that honors the dead,

2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:50.520
 seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom

2:34:50.520 --> 2:34:52.120
 because they do still outnumber us.

2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:55.960
 They outnumber the living by quite a significant margin.

2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:58.720
 And then to be mindful of the unborn

2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:03.560
 and our responsibility to them.

2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:07.800
 Writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.

2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:10.720
 It may or may not succeed, and probably won't succeed

2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:12.160
 if my books are never assigned

2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:14.520
 by work professors in the future.

2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:16.760
 So what we have to do is more than just write books

2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.560
 and record podcasts, there have to be institutions.

2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:22.280
 I'm 57 now.

2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:25.200
 I realized recently that succession planning

2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:29.000
 had to be the main focus of the next 20 years

2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.960
 because there are things that I really care about

2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:36.760
 that I want future generations to have access to.

2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:41.080
 And so the meaning of life I do regard

2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.280
 as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom.

2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:50.440
 Ultimately the species will go extinct at some point.

2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:53.160
 Even if we do colonize Mars, one senses

2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:56.800
 that physics will catch up with this particular organism,

2:35:56.800 --> 2:35:59.800
 but it's in the pretty far distant future.

2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:01.760
 And so the meaning of life is to make sure

2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:04.960
 that for as long as there are human beings,

2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:09.960
 they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives,

2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:14.320
 ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled,

2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:16.280
 emotionally fulfilled lives

2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:19.080
 that civilization has made possible.

2:36:19.080 --> 2:36:24.080
 It would be easy for us to revert to the uncivilized world.

2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:29.520
 There's a fantastic book that I'm going to misremember.

2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:33.120
 Milosz is the captive soul, the captive mind rather,

2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:37.120
 which has a fantastic passage.

2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:43.000
 He was a Polish intellectual who says,

2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:46.040
 Americans can never imagine what it's like

2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:49.320
 for civilization to be completely destroyed

2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:52.560
 as it was in Poland by the end of World War II,

2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:56.760
 to have no rule of law, to have no security of even person,

2:36:56.760 --> 2:36:58.200
 nevermind property rights.

2:36:58.200 --> 2:36:59.840
 They can't imagine what that's like

2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:01.480
 and what it will lead you to do.

2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:04.600
 So one reason for teaching history

2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:09.600
 is to remind the lucky Generation Z members

2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:15.200
 of California that civilization is a thin film.

2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:18.040
 And it can be destroyed remarkably easily.

2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:19.640
 And to preserve civilization

2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:23.000
 is a tremendous responsibility that we have.

2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.280
 It's a huge responsibility.

2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:27.720
 And we must not destroy ourselves,

2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:30.400
 whether it's in the name of wokeism

2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:33.120
 or the pursuit of the metaverse.

2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:35.520
 Preserving civilization and making it available,

2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:38.480
 not just to our kids, but to people we'll never know,

2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:40.640
 generations ahead, that's the meaning.

2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:45.040
 And do so by studying the lessons of history.

2:37:45.040 --> 2:37:48.560
 Right, not only studying them, but then acting on them.

2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:50.120
 For me, the biggest problem is,

2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:53.160
 how do we apply history more effectively?

2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:56.440
 It seems as if our institutions, including government,

2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:59.640
 are very, very bad at applying history.

2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:02.400
 Lessons of history are learned poorly, if at all.

2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:04.280
 Analogies are drawn crudely.

2:38:04.280 --> 2:38:06.480
 Often the wrong inferences are drawn.

2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:08.360
 One of the big intellectual challenges for me

2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:12.280
 is how to make history more useful.

2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.120
 And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate,

2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:16.920
 but really practically useful,

2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:19.920
 so that policymakers and citizens

2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:22.120
 can think about the decisions that they face

2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:27.120
 with a more historically informed body of knowledge.

2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:29.880
 Whether it's a pandemic, the challenge of climate change,

2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:31.800
 what to do about Taiwan.

2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:36.800
 I can't think of a better set of things to know

2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:39.040
 before you make decisions about those things

2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:41.400
 than the things that history has to offer.

2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:43.560
 Well, I love the discipline of applied history,

2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:45.520
 basically going to history and saying,

2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:50.040
 what are the key principles here

2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:52.600
 that are applicable to the problems of today?

2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:53.440
 Right.

2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:54.280
 And how can we solve that?

2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:57.320
 The great philosopher of history, R.G. Collingwood,

2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:01.160
 said in his autobiography, which was published in 1939,

2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:05.360
 that the purpose of history was to reconstitute

2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:10.320
 past thought from whatever surviving remnants there were,

2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:14.520
 and then to juxtapose it with our own predicament.

2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.400
 And that's that juxtaposition of past experience

2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:19.840
 with present experience that is so important.

2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:22.160
 We don't do that well.

2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:24.080
 And indeed, we've flipped it

2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:26.520
 so that academic historians now think their mission

2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:31.400
 is to travel back to the past with the value system of 2021

2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:36.160
 and castigate the dead for their racism and sexism

2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:38.400
 and transphobia and whatnot.

2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:40.440
 And that's exactly wrong.

2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.240
 Our mission is to go back and try to understand

2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:44.960
 what it was like to live in the 18th century,

2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:49.040
 not to go back and condescend to the people of the past.

2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:51.200
 And once we've had a better understanding,

2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:53.640
 once we've seen into their lives, read their words,

2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:55.480
 tried to reconstitute their experience,

2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:58.720
 to come back and understand our own time better,

2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:00.320
 that's what we should really be doing.

2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:01.920
 That's what we should really be doing.

2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:04.120
 But academic history has gone completely haywire,

2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:05.760
 and it does almost the exact opposite

2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:07.520
 of what I think it should do.

2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:11.880
 And by studying history, walk beautifully, gracefully

2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:14.400
 through this simulation, as you described,

2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:17.800
 by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.

2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:20.560
 We have virtual reality already in our heads.

2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:24.440
 We do not need Oculus and the metaverse.

2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:27.080
 This was an incredible, hopeful conversation

2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:29.560
 in many ways that I did not expect.

2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:31.280
 I thought our conversation would be much more

2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:33.160
 about history than about the future,

2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:35.080
 and it turned out to be the opposite.

2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:36.360
 Thank you so much for talking to me today.

2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:38.720
 It's a huge honor to finally meet you, to talk to you.

2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:40.640
 Thank you for your valuable time.

2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:43.480
 Thank you, Lex, and good luck with Putin.

2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:45.200
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:46.520

2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:54.760
 from Neil Ferguson himself.

2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:57.920
 No civilization, no matter how mighty it may appear

2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:00.480
 to itself, is indestructible.

2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:27.480
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
