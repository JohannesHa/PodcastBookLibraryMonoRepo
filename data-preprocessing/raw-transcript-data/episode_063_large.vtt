00:00.000 --> 00:04.580
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history at Princeton

00:04.580 --> 00:10.360
 University and one of the great historians of our time, specializing in Russian and Soviet

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
 history.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.640
 He has written many books on Stalin and the Soviet Union, including the first two of a

00:15.640 --> 00:21.000
 three volume work on Stalin, and he is currently working on volume three.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.400
 You may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just computer scientists, but physicists,

00:25.400 --> 00:29.720
 engineers, historians, neuroscientists, and soon much more.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.160
 To me, artificial intelligence is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.

00:34.160 --> 00:40.120
 It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in

00:40.120 --> 00:41.560
 the machine.

00:41.560 --> 00:50.380
 To me, that journey must include a deep historical and psychological understanding of power.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.840
 Technology puts some of the greatest power in the history of our civilization into the

00:53.840 --> 00:56.720
 hands of engineers and computer scientists.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.340
 This power must not be abused.

00:59.340 --> 01:04.880
 And the best way to understand how such abuse can be avoided is to not be blind to the lessons

01:04.880 --> 01:05.880
 of history.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.760
 As Stephen Kotkin brilliantly articulates, Stalin was arguably one of the most powerful

01:12.760 --> 01:14.360
 humans in history.

01:14.360 --> 01:20.280
 I've read many books on Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Putin, and the wars of the 20th century.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.920
 I hope you understand the value of such knowledge to all of us, especially to engineers and

01:25.920 --> 01:31.160
 scientists who built the tools of power in the 21st century.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.200
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:33.200 --> 01:39.560

01:44.300 --> 01:46.800
 I D M A N.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.000
 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction, I'll do one or two minutes

01:51.000 --> 01:55.280
 after introducing the episode, and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
 of the conversation.

01:56.280 --> 02:01.520
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:01.520 --> 02:06.000
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.640
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell,

02:10.640 --> 02:13.160
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.240
 Cash App also has an investing feature.

02:15.240 --> 02:21.120
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:21.120 --> 02:27.520
 Your services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.440
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations

02:31.440 --> 02:36.160
 called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.440
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have

02:41.440 --> 02:46.520
 a perfect rating on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money is used to maximum

02:46.520 --> 02:48.200
 effectiveness.

02:48.200 --> 02:53.160
 When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use code LexPodcast, you'll

02:53.160 --> 02:58.680
 get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again, is an organization

02:58.680 --> 03:05.560
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.

03:05.560 --> 03:11.060
 And now, here's my conversation with Stephen Kotkin.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.880
 Do all human beings crave power?

03:13.880 --> 03:15.340
 No.

03:15.340 --> 03:18.100
 Human beings crave security.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.160
 They crave love.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.880
 They crave adventure.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.580
 They crave power, but not equally.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.880
 Some human beings nevertheless do crave power.

03:29.880 --> 03:30.880
 For sure.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.780
 What words is that deeply in the psychology of people?

03:34.780 --> 03:36.500
 Is it something you're born with?

03:36.500 --> 03:38.820
 Is it something you develop?

03:38.820 --> 03:49.500
 Some people crave a position of leadership or of standing out, of being recognized, and

03:49.500 --> 03:53.400
 that could be starting out in the school years on the schoolyard.

03:53.400 --> 03:58.760
 It could be within their own family, not just in their peer group.

03:58.760 --> 04:04.520
 Those kind of people we often see craving leadership positions from a young age often

04:04.520 --> 04:06.960
 end up in positions of power.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.700
 But they can be varied positions of power.

04:09.700 --> 04:15.400
 You can have power in an institution where your power is purposefully limited.

04:15.400 --> 04:21.180
 For example, there's a board or a consultative body or a separation of powers.

04:21.180 --> 04:27.620
 Not everyone craves power whereby they're the sole power or they're their unconstrained

04:27.620 --> 04:29.020
 power.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.760
 That's a little bit less usual.

04:30.760 --> 04:35.840
 We may think that everybody does, but not everybody does.

04:35.840 --> 04:44.300
 Those people who do crave that kind of power, unconstrained, the ability to decide as much

04:44.300 --> 04:49.660
 as life or death of other people, those people are not everyday people.

04:49.660 --> 04:54.840
 They're not the people you encounter in your daily life for the most part.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.460
 Those are extraordinary people.

04:57.460 --> 05:01.500
 Most of them don't have the opportunity to live that dream.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.460
 Very few of them, in fact, end up with the opportunity to live that dream.

05:05.460 --> 05:13.100
 So percentage wise, in your sense, if we think of George Washington, for example, would most

05:13.100 --> 05:20.620
 people given the choice of absolute power over a country versus maybe the capped power

05:20.620 --> 05:27.380
 that the United States presidential role, at least at the founding of the country represented,

05:27.380 --> 05:29.340
 what do you think most people would choose?

05:29.340 --> 05:36.260
 Well, Washington was in a position to exercise far greater power than he did.

05:36.260 --> 05:40.500
 And in fact, he didn't take that option.

05:40.500 --> 05:49.780
 He was more interested in seeing institutionalization, of seeing the country develop strong institutions

05:49.780 --> 05:54.340
 rather than an individual leader like himself have excess power.

05:54.340 --> 05:56.460
 So that's very important.

05:56.460 --> 06:01.660
 So like I said, not everyone craves unconstrained power, even if they're very ambitious.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.860
 And of course, Washington was very ambitious.

06:03.860 --> 06:08.900
 He was a successful general before he was a president.

06:08.900 --> 06:14.100
 So that clearly comes from the influences on your life, where you grow up, how you grow

06:14.100 --> 06:20.800
 up, how you raised, what kind of values are imparted to you along the way.

06:20.800 --> 06:27.060
 You can understand power as the ability to share, or you can understand or the ability

06:27.060 --> 06:34.180
 to advance something for the collective in a collective process, not an individual process.

06:34.180 --> 06:38.060
 So power comes in many different varieties.

06:38.060 --> 06:43.420
 And ambition doesn't always equate to despotic power.

06:43.420 --> 06:51.580
 Right power is something different from ordinary institutional power that we see.

06:51.580 --> 06:55.500
 The president of MIT does not have unconstrained power.

06:55.500 --> 07:01.980
 The president of MIT rightly must consult with other members of the administration,

07:01.980 --> 07:07.260
 with the faculty members, to a certain extent with the student body and certainly with the

07:07.260 --> 07:10.300
 trustees of MIT.

07:10.300 --> 07:17.620
 Those constraints make the institution strong and enduring and make the decisions better

07:17.620 --> 07:21.020
 than they would be if he had unconstrained power.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.180
 But you can't say that the president is not ambitious.

07:24.180 --> 07:27.080
 Of course, the president is ambitious.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.640
 We worry about unconstrained power.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.900
 We worry about executive authority that's not limited.

07:33.900 --> 07:37.740
 That's the definition of authoritarianism or tyranny.

07:37.740 --> 07:42.740
 Unlimited or barely limited executive authority.

07:42.740 --> 07:46.300
 Executive authority is necessary to carry out many functions.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.540
 We all understand that.

07:47.540 --> 07:51.780
 That's why MIT has an executive, has a president.

07:51.780 --> 08:00.560
 But unlimited or largely unconstrained executive power is detrimental to even the person who

08:00.560 --> 08:02.700
 exercises that power.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.500
 So what do you think?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.140
 It's an interesting notion.

08:06.140 --> 08:11.740
 We kind of take it for granted that constraints on executive power is a good thing.

08:11.740 --> 08:14.200
 But why is that necessarily true?

08:14.200 --> 08:21.920
 So what is it about absolute power that does something bad to the human mind?

08:21.920 --> 08:27.220
 So you know, the popular saying of absolute power corrupts absolutely.

08:27.220 --> 08:28.900
 Is that the case?

08:28.900 --> 08:35.220
 That the power in itself is the thing that corrupts the mind in some kind of way where

08:35.220 --> 08:39.020
 it leads to a bad leadership over time?

08:39.020 --> 08:42.420
 People make more mistakes when they're not challenged.

08:42.420 --> 08:48.240
 When they don't have to explain things and get others to vote and go along with it.

08:48.240 --> 08:54.740
 When they can make a decision without anybody being able to block their decision or to have

08:54.740 --> 08:57.580
 input necessarily on their decision.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.660
 You're more prone to mistakes.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.060
 You're more prone to extremism.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.080
 There's a temptation there.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.400
 For example, we have separation of powers in the United States.

09:08.400 --> 09:15.540
 The Congress, right, has authority that the president doesn't have.

09:15.540 --> 09:19.500
 As for example, in budgeting, the so called power of the purse.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.820
 This can be very frustrating.

09:21.820 --> 09:26.300
 People want to see things happen and they complain that there's a do nothing Congress

09:26.300 --> 09:30.340
 or that the situation is stalemated.

09:30.340 --> 09:33.860
 But actually that's potentially a good thing.

09:33.860 --> 09:37.140
 In fact, that's how our system was designed.

09:37.140 --> 09:42.100
 Our system was designed to prevent things happening in government.

09:42.100 --> 09:47.500
 And there's frustration with that, but ultimately that's the strength of the institutions we

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
 have.

09:48.500 --> 09:54.220
 And so when you see unconstrained executive authority, there can be a lot of dynamism.

09:54.220 --> 09:57.300
 A lot of things can get done quickly.

09:57.300 --> 10:02.220
 But those things can be like, for example, what happened in China under Mao or what happened

10:02.220 --> 10:08.700
 in the Soviet Union under Stalin or what happened in Haiti under Papa Doc and then Baby Doc

10:08.700 --> 10:10.880
 or fill in the blank, right?

10:10.880 --> 10:18.540
 What happens sometimes in corporations where a corporate leader is not constrained by the

10:18.540 --> 10:21.660
 shareholders, by the board or by anything.

10:21.660 --> 10:26.720
 And they can seem to be a genius for a while, but eventually it catches up to them.

10:26.720 --> 10:32.280
 And so the idea of constraints on executive power is absolutely fundamental to the American

10:32.280 --> 10:35.600
 system, American way of thinking.

10:35.600 --> 10:42.780
 And not only America, obviously large other parts of the world that have a similar system,

10:42.780 --> 10:48.440
 not an identical system, but a similar system of checks and balances on executive power.

10:48.440 --> 10:56.980
 And so the case that I study, the only checks and balances on executive power are circumstantial.

10:56.980 --> 11:04.060
 So for example, distances in the country, it's hard to do something over 5,000 miles

11:04.060 --> 11:09.300
 or the amount of time in a day, it's hard for a leader to get to every single thing

11:09.300 --> 11:13.380
 the leader wants to get to because there are only 24 hours in a day.

11:13.380 --> 11:16.740
 Those are circumstantial constraints on executive power.

11:16.740 --> 11:20.740
 They're not institutional constraints on executive power.

11:20.740 --> 11:27.160
 One of the constraints on executive power that United States has versus Russia, maybe

11:27.160 --> 11:30.940
 something you've implied and actually spoke directly to is there's something in the Russian

11:30.940 --> 11:38.980
 people and the Soviet people that are attracted to authoritarian power, psychologically speaking,

11:38.980 --> 11:45.420
 or at least the kind of leaders that sought authoritarian power throughout its history.

11:45.420 --> 11:51.100
 And that desire for that kind of human is a lack of a constraint.

11:51.100 --> 11:58.060
 In America, it seems as people, we desire somebody not like Stalin, somebody more like

11:58.060 --> 11:59.100
 George Washington.

11:59.100 --> 12:04.540
 So that's another constraint, the belief of the people, what they admire in a leader,

12:04.540 --> 12:06.740
 what they seek in a leader.

12:06.740 --> 12:14.340
 So maybe you can speak to, well, first of all, can you speak briefly to that psychology

12:14.340 --> 12:20.340
 of, is there a difference between the Russian people and the American people in terms of

12:20.340 --> 12:24.220
 just what we find attractive in a leader?

12:24.220 --> 12:27.820
 Not as great a difference as it might seem.

12:27.820 --> 12:34.500
 There are unfortunately many Americans who would be happy with an authoritarian leader

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
 in the country.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.600
 It's by no means a majority.

12:38.600 --> 12:44.060
 It's not even a plurality, but nonetheless, it's a real sentiment in the population.

12:44.060 --> 12:48.660
 Sometimes because they feel frustrated because things are not getting done.

12:48.660 --> 12:54.180
 Sometimes because they're against something that's happening in the political realm and

12:54.180 --> 12:57.060
 they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quickly.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.460
 It's a kind of impulse.

12:59.460 --> 13:05.940
 People can regret the impulse later on, that the impulse is motivated by reaction to their

13:05.940 --> 13:07.260
 environment.

13:07.260 --> 13:13.020
 In the Russian case, we have also people who crave, sometimes known as a strong hand, an

13:13.020 --> 13:18.580
 iron hand, an authoritarian leader, because they want things to be done and be done more

13:18.580 --> 13:23.420
 quickly that align with their desires.

13:23.420 --> 13:28.220
 But I'm not sure it's a majority in the country today.

13:28.220 --> 13:34.880
 Certainly in Stalin's time, this was a widespread sentiment and people had few alternatives

13:34.880 --> 13:37.620
 that they understood or could appeal to.

13:37.620 --> 13:43.980
 Nowadays in the globalized world, the citizens of Russia can see how other systems have constraints

13:43.980 --> 13:47.900
 on executive power and the life isn't so bad there.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.780
 In fact, the life might even be better.

13:50.780 --> 13:58.940
 So the impatience, the impulsive quality, the frustration does sometimes in people reinforce

13:58.940 --> 14:05.580
 their craving for the unconstrained executive to quote, get things done or shake things

14:05.580 --> 14:06.580
 up.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.540
 Yes, that's true.

14:08.540 --> 14:12.100
 But in the Russian case, I'm not sure it's cultural today.

14:12.100 --> 14:20.700
 I think it might be more having to do with the failures, the functional failures of the

14:20.700 --> 14:27.220
 kind of political system that they tried to institute after the Soviet collapse.

14:27.220 --> 14:34.260
 And so it may be frustration with the version of constraints on executive power they got

14:34.260 --> 14:43.580
 and how it didn't work the way it was imagined, which has led to a sense in which nonconstrained

14:43.580 --> 14:45.820
 executive power could fix things.

14:45.820 --> 14:51.040
 But I'm not sure that that's a majority sentiment in the Russian case, although it's hard to

14:51.040 --> 15:00.100
 measure because under authoritarian regimes, a public opinion is shaped by the environment

15:00.100 --> 15:04.820
 in which people live, which is very constrained in terms of public opinion.

15:04.820 --> 15:11.740
 But on that point, why at least from a distance does there seem to nevertheless be support

15:11.740 --> 15:15.860
 for the current Russian president Vladimir Putin?

15:15.860 --> 15:23.060
 Is that have to do with the fact that measuring, getting good metrics and statistics on support

15:23.060 --> 15:28.460
 is difficult in authoritarian governments, or is there still something appealing to that

15:28.460 --> 15:30.660
 kind of power to the people?

15:30.660 --> 15:36.740
 I think we have to give credit to President Putin for understanding the psychology of

15:36.740 --> 15:41.880
 the Russians to whom he appeals.

15:41.880 --> 15:46.340
 Many of them were the losers in the transition from communism.

15:46.340 --> 15:52.280
 They were the ones whose pensions were destroyed by inflation or whose salaries didn't go up

15:52.280 --> 15:55.420
 or whose regions were abandoned.

15:55.420 --> 16:00.580
 They were not the winners for the most part, and so I think there's an understanding on

16:00.580 --> 16:02.900
 his part of their psychology.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.400
 Putin has grown in the position.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.180
 He was not a public politician when he first started out.

16:08.180 --> 16:10.900
 He was quite poor in public settings.

16:10.900 --> 16:14.880
 He didn't have the kind of political instincts that he has now.

16:14.880 --> 16:20.640
 He didn't have the appeal to traditional values and the Orthodox Church and some of the other

16:20.640 --> 16:24.100
 dimensions of his rule today.

16:24.100 --> 16:31.820
 So yes, we have to give some credit to Putin himself for this in addition to the frustrations

16:31.820 --> 16:34.220
 and the mass of the people.

16:34.220 --> 16:39.220
 But let's think about it this way in addition, without taking away the fact that he's become

16:39.220 --> 16:46.720
 a better retail politician over time and that sentiment has shifted because of the disappointments

16:46.720 --> 16:51.500
 with the transition with the population.

16:51.500 --> 16:57.020
 When I ask my kids, am I a good dad?

16:57.020 --> 17:01.980
 My kids don't have any other dad to measure me against.

17:01.980 --> 17:08.700
 I'm the only dad they know, and I'm the only dad they can choose or not choose.

17:08.700 --> 17:13.180
 If they don't choose me, they still get me as dad, right?

17:13.180 --> 17:18.860
 So with Putin today, he's the only dad that the Russian people have.

17:18.860 --> 17:24.600
 Now, if my kids were introduced to alternative fathers, they might be better than me.

17:24.600 --> 17:32.100
 They might be more loving, more giving, funnier, richer, whatever it might be.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.300
 They might be more appealing.

17:34.300 --> 17:39.260
 There are some blood ties there for sure that I have with my kids, but they would at least

17:39.260 --> 17:47.260
 be able to choose alternatives and then I would have to win their favor in that constellation

17:47.260 --> 17:48.800
 of alternatives.

17:48.800 --> 17:55.420
 If President Putin were up against real alternatives, if the population had real choice and that

17:55.420 --> 18:01.220
 choice could express itself and have resources and have media and everything else the way

18:01.220 --> 18:08.460
 he does, maybe he would be very popular and maybe his popularity would not be as great

18:08.460 --> 18:10.540
 as it currently is.

18:10.540 --> 18:18.780
 So the absence of alternatives is another factor that reinforces his authority and his

18:18.780 --> 18:19.780
 popularity.

18:19.780 --> 18:25.340
 Having said that, there are many authoritarian leaders who deny any alternatives to the

18:25.340 --> 18:29.260
 population and are not very popular.

18:29.260 --> 18:33.760
 So denial of alternatives doesn't guarantee you the popularity.

18:33.760 --> 18:39.180
 You still have to figure out the mass psychology and be able to appeal to it.

18:39.180 --> 18:49.540
 So in the Russian case, the winners from the transition live primarily in the big cities

18:49.540 --> 18:56.780
 and are self employed or entrepreneurial.

18:56.780 --> 19:00.940
 Even if they're not self employed, they're able to change careers.

19:00.940 --> 19:08.980
 They have tremendous skills and talent and education and knowledge as well as these entrepreneurial

19:08.980 --> 19:12.140
 or dynamic personalities.

19:12.140 --> 19:13.900
 Putin also appealed to them.

19:13.900 --> 19:18.820
 He did that with Medvedev and it was a very clever ruse.

19:18.820 --> 19:27.300
 He himself appealed to the losers from the transition, the small towns, the rural, the

19:27.300 --> 19:32.740
 people who were not well off and he had them for the most part.

19:32.740 --> 19:33.740
 Not all.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.840
 We don't want to generalize to say that he had every one of them because those people

19:36.840 --> 19:42.380
 have views of their own, sometimes in contradiction with the president of Russia.

19:42.380 --> 19:47.800
 And then he appealed to the opposite people, the successful urban base through the so called

19:47.800 --> 19:54.980
 reformer Medvedev, the new generation, the technically literate prime minister who for

19:54.980 --> 19:56.940
 a time was president.

19:56.940 --> 19:59.220
 And so that worked very successfully for Putin.

19:59.220 --> 20:07.100
 He was able to bridge a big divide in the society and gain a greater mass support than

20:07.100 --> 20:09.260
 he would otherwise have had by himself.

20:09.260 --> 20:17.780
 That ruse only worked through the time that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few

20:17.780 --> 20:25.100
 years because of the Constitution, Putin couldn't do three consecutive terms and stepped aside

20:25.100 --> 20:30.540
 in what they call castling in chess.

20:30.540 --> 20:35.300
 When this was over, Putin had difficulty with his popularity.

20:35.300 --> 20:41.620
 There were mass protests in the urban areas, precisely that group of the population that

20:41.620 --> 20:48.980
 he had been able to win in part because of the Medvedev castling and now had had their

20:48.980 --> 20:55.620
 delusions exposed and were disillusioned, and there were these mass protests in the

20:55.620 --> 20:59.060
 urban areas, not just in the capital, by the way.

20:59.060 --> 21:03.820
 And Putin had to, as it were, come up with a new way to fix his popularity, which happened

21:03.820 --> 21:10.420
 to be the annexation of Crimea, from which he got a very significant bump.

21:10.420 --> 21:15.500
 However, the trend is back in the other direction.

21:15.500 --> 21:21.380
 It's diminishing again, although it's still high relative to other leaders around the

21:21.380 --> 21:22.380
 world.

21:22.380 --> 21:28.300
 So I wouldn't say that he's unpopular with the mass in Russia.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.980
 There is some popularity there, there is some success, but I would say it's tough for us

21:32.980 --> 21:36.580
 to gauge because of the lack of alternatives.

21:36.580 --> 21:42.340
 And Putin is unpopular inside the state administration.

21:42.340 --> 21:45.500
 At every level, the bureaucracy of the leadership.

21:45.500 --> 21:51.260
 Because those people are well informed, and they understand that the country is declining,

21:51.260 --> 21:57.180
 that the human capital is declining, the infrastructure is declining, the economy is not really growing,

21:57.180 --> 22:02.060
 it's not really diversifying, Russia's not investing in its future.

22:02.060 --> 22:07.860
 The state officials understand all of that, and then they see that the Putin clique is

22:07.860 --> 22:10.260
 stealing everything in sight.

22:10.260 --> 22:16.820
 So between the failure to invest in a future and the corruption of a narrow group around

22:16.820 --> 22:22.380
 the president, there's disillusionment in the state apparatus because they see this

22:22.380 --> 22:27.420
 more clearly or more closely than the mass of the population.

22:27.420 --> 22:38.020
 They can't necessarily yet oppose this in public because they're people, they have families,

22:38.020 --> 22:43.020
 they have careers, they have children who want to go to school or want a job.

22:43.020 --> 22:49.220
 And so there are constraints on their ability to oppose the regime based upon what we might

22:49.220 --> 22:52.580
 call cowardice or other people might call realism.

22:52.580 --> 22:59.980
 I don't know how courageous people can be when their family, children, career are on

22:59.980 --> 23:01.960
 the line.

23:01.960 --> 23:06.420
 So it's very interesting dynamic to see the disillusionment inside the government with

23:06.420 --> 23:13.140
 the president, which is not yet fully public for the most part, but could become public.

23:13.140 --> 23:17.500
 And once again, if there's an alternative, if an alternative appears, things could shift

23:17.500 --> 23:18.580
 quickly.

23:18.580 --> 23:22.220
 And that alternative could come from inside the regime.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.220
 From inside the regime.

23:23.220 --> 23:29.540
 But the leadership, the party, the people that are now, as you're saying, opposed to

23:29.540 --> 23:37.420
 Putin, nevertheless, maybe you can correct me, but it feels like there's, structurally

23:37.420 --> 23:39.260
 is deeply corrupt.

23:39.260 --> 23:47.780
 So each of the people we're talking about are, don't feel like a George Washington.

23:47.780 --> 23:53.060
 Once again, the circumstances don't permit them to act that way necessarily, right?

23:53.060 --> 23:57.660
 George Washington did great things, but in certain circumstances.

23:57.660 --> 24:03.220
 A lot of the state officials in Russia for certain are corrupt.

24:03.220 --> 24:04.780
 There's no question.

24:04.780 --> 24:12.540
 Many of them, however, are patriotic and many of them feel badly about where the country

24:12.540 --> 24:14.300
 has been going.

24:14.300 --> 24:17.180
 They would prefer that the country was less corrupt.

24:17.180 --> 24:24.240
 They would prefer that there were greater investment in all sorts of areas of Russia.

24:24.240 --> 24:30.400
 They might even themselves steal less if they could be guaranteed that everybody else would

24:30.400 --> 24:32.140
 steal less.

24:32.140 --> 24:40.540
 There's a deep and abiding patriotism inside Russia, as well as inside the Russian regime.

24:40.540 --> 24:46.060
 So they understand that Putin in many ways rescued the Russian state from the chaos of

24:46.060 --> 24:47.900
 the 1990s.

24:47.900 --> 24:55.780
 They understand that Russia was in very bad shape as an incoherent failing state almost

24:55.780 --> 25:03.260
 when Putin took over and that he did some important things for Russia's stability and

25:03.260 --> 25:05.540
 consolidation.

25:05.540 --> 25:12.940
 There's also some appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to more

25:12.940 --> 25:19.380
 powerful countries and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability for Russia in the

25:19.380 --> 25:21.520
 international system.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.760
 People appreciate that and it's real.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.700
 It's not imagined that Putin accomplished that.

25:27.700 --> 25:32.020
 The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with.

25:32.020 --> 25:37.700
 He used the kind of methods, that is to say, taking other people's property, putting other

25:37.700 --> 25:40.740
 people in jail for political reasons.

25:40.740 --> 25:46.160
 He used the kind of methods that are not conducive to long term growth and stability.

25:46.160 --> 25:50.960
 So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem and then created even bigger long

25:50.960 --> 25:53.500
 term problems potentially.

25:53.500 --> 26:00.300
 And moreover, all authoritarian regimes that use those methods are tempted to keep using

26:00.300 --> 26:05.980
 them and using them and using them until they're the only ones who are the beneficiaries and

26:05.980 --> 26:08.360
 the group narrows and narrows.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.500
 The elite gets smaller and narrower.

26:11.500 --> 26:18.940
 The interest groups get excluded from power and their ability to continue enjoying the

26:18.940 --> 26:22.600
 fruits of the system and the resentment grows.

26:22.600 --> 26:28.060
 And so that's the situation we have in Russia is a place that is stuck.

26:28.060 --> 26:31.900
 It was to a certain extent rescued.

26:31.900 --> 26:37.900
 It was rescued with methods that were not conducive to long term success and stability.

26:37.900 --> 26:43.100
 The rescue you're referring to is the sort of the economic growth when Putin first took

26:43.100 --> 26:44.100
 office.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
 Yes, they had 10 years.

26:45.100 --> 26:50.460
 They had a full decade of an average of 7% growth a year, which was phenomenal and is

26:50.460 --> 26:55.220
 not attributable predominantly to oil prices.

26:55.220 --> 27:03.180
 During President Putin's first term as president, the average price of oil was $35 a barrel.

27:03.180 --> 27:08.660
 During his second term as president, the average price was $70 a barrel.

27:08.660 --> 27:16.540
 So during those two terms, when Russia was growing at about 7% a year, oil prices were

27:16.540 --> 27:24.180
 averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel, which is fine, but is not the reason because later

27:24.180 --> 27:30.920
 on when oil prices were over $100 a barrel, Russia stagnated.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.220
 So the initial growth, do you think Putin deserves some credit for that?

27:34.220 --> 27:40.280
 Yes, he does because he introduced some important liberalizing measures.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.220
 He lowered taxes.

27:42.220 --> 27:45.960
 He allowed land to be bought and sold.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.340
 He deregulated many areas of the economy.

27:50.340 --> 27:57.700
 And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst that was partly attributable, partly

27:57.700 --> 28:01.900
 attributable to government policy during his first term.

28:01.900 --> 28:05.240
 But also he was consolidating political power.

28:05.240 --> 28:12.480
 And as I said, the methods he used overall for the long term were not able to continue

28:12.480 --> 28:14.980
 sustain that success.

28:14.980 --> 28:21.200
 In addition, we have to remember that China played a really big role in the success of

28:21.200 --> 28:30.540
 Russia in the first two terms of Putin's presidency because China's phenomenal growth created

28:30.540 --> 28:37.300
 insatiable demand for just about everything that the Soviet Union used to produce.

28:37.300 --> 28:46.660
 So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank, chemicals, metals, China had insatiable demand

28:46.660 --> 28:50.260
 for everything the Soviet Union once produced.

28:50.260 --> 29:00.480
 And so China's raising of global demand overall brought Soviet era industry back from the

29:00.480 --> 29:02.240
 dead.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.880
 And so there was something that happened.

29:04.880 --> 29:09.000
 Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.780
 There was a decline in manufacturing and industrial production greater than in the Great Depression

29:14.780 --> 29:16.940
 in the US.

29:16.940 --> 29:21.220
 But a lot of that came back online in the 2000s.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.980
 And that had to do with China's phenomenal growth.

29:23.980 --> 29:28.380
 The trade between China and Russia was not always direct.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.700
 So this was an indirect effect.

29:30.700 --> 29:38.100
 But raising global prices for the commodities and the products, the kind of lower end, lower

29:38.100 --> 29:45.020
 value products in manufacturing, not high end stuff, but lower end stuff like steel

29:45.020 --> 29:53.700
 or iron or cement or fertilizer, where the value added is not spectacular, but nonetheless,

29:53.700 --> 29:59.340
 which had been destroyed by the 1990s and after the Soviet collapse, this was brought

29:59.340 --> 30:00.340
 back to life.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.580
 Now, you can do that once.

30:02.580 --> 30:06.660
 You can bring Soviet era industry back to life once.

30:06.660 --> 30:12.540
 And that happened during Putin's first two terms, in addition to the liberalizing policies,

30:12.540 --> 30:17.000
 which spurred entrepreneurialism in some small and medium business.

30:17.000 --> 30:24.220
 The crash of the ruble in 1998, which made Russian products much cheaper abroad and made

30:24.220 --> 30:31.380
 imports much more expensive, also facilitated the resuscitation, the revival of domestic

30:31.380 --> 30:33.540
 manufacturing.

30:33.540 --> 30:43.180
 So all of this came together for that spectacular 10 year, 7% on average economic growth.

30:43.180 --> 30:51.020
 And moreover, people's wages after inflation, their disposable income grew more even than

30:51.020 --> 30:52.620
 GDP grew.

30:52.620 --> 30:59.140
 So disposable income after inflation, that is real income, was growing greater than 7%.

30:59.140 --> 31:01.860
 In some cases, 10% a year.

31:01.860 --> 31:06.920
 So there was a boom, and the Russian people felt it, and it happened during Putin's first

31:06.920 --> 31:12.940
 two terms, and people were grateful, rightly so, for that.

31:12.940 --> 31:19.820
 And those who don't want to give Putin credit, give oil prices all the credit.

31:19.820 --> 31:23.700
 But I don't think that oil prices can explain this.

31:23.700 --> 31:29.540
 Having said that, that doesn't mean that this was sustainable over the long term.

31:29.540 --> 31:35.940
 So you've briefly mentioned, sort of implying the possibility, you know, Stalin held power

31:35.940 --> 31:38.640
 for, let's say, 30 years.

31:38.640 --> 31:45.300
 You briefly mentioned that as a question, will Putin be able to beat that record, to

31:45.300 --> 31:46.300
 beat that?

31:46.300 --> 31:52.700
 So can you talk about your sense of, is it possible that Putin holds power for that kind

31:52.700 --> 31:54.200
 of duration?

31:54.200 --> 31:55.900
 Let's hope not.

31:55.900 --> 31:59.540
 Let's hope not for Russia's sake.

31:59.540 --> 32:05.420
 The primary victims of President Putin's power are Russians.

32:05.420 --> 32:11.180
 They're not Ukrainians, although to a certain extent, Ukraine has suffered because of Putin's

32:11.180 --> 32:12.180
 actions.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.700
 And they're not Americans, they're Russians.

32:15.700 --> 32:20.660
 Moreover, Russia has lost a great deal of human talent.

32:20.660 --> 32:27.340
 Tens of millions of people have left Russia since 1991 overall.

32:27.340 --> 32:33.320
 Somewhere between five and 10 million people have left the country and are beyond the borders

32:33.320 --> 32:35.660
 of the former Soviet Union.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.260
 So they left the Soviet space entirely.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.860
 Moreover, the people who left are not the poor people.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.320
 They're not the uneducated.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.780
 They're not the losers.

32:45.780 --> 32:50.100
 The people who've left are the more dynamic parts of the population.

32:50.100 --> 32:53.120
 The better educated, the more entrepreneurial.

32:53.120 --> 32:58.440
 So that human capital loss that Russia has suffered is phenomenal.

32:58.440 --> 33:04.560
 And in fact, right here where we're sitting at MIT, we have examples of people who are

33:04.560 --> 33:10.380
 qualified good enough for MIT and have left Russia to come to MIT.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.200
 You're looking at one of them.

33:12.200 --> 33:19.980
 And the other aspect, just to quickly comment, is those same people like me, I'm not welcome

33:19.980 --> 33:20.980
 back.

33:20.980 --> 33:22.420
 No, you're not under the current regime.

33:22.420 --> 33:28.860
 It was a big loss for Russia if you're patriotic, but not from the point of view of the Putin

33:28.860 --> 33:29.860
 regime.

33:29.860 --> 33:33.660
 That has to do, also factors into popularity.

33:33.660 --> 33:39.620
 If the people who don't like you leave, they're not there to complain, to protest, to vote

33:39.620 --> 33:41.160
 against you.

33:41.160 --> 33:46.300
 And so your opposition declines when you let them leave.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.180
 However, it's very costly in human capital terms.

33:49.180 --> 33:55.060
 Hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging, it's self damaging.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.040
 And we've seen it accelerate.

33:57.040 --> 34:04.740
 It was already high, but we've seen it accelerate in the last seven to eight years of President

34:04.740 --> 34:07.340
 Putin's rule.

34:07.340 --> 34:11.940
 And those people are not going back of their own volition.

34:11.940 --> 34:15.840
 But even if they wanted to go back, as you just said, they'd be unwelcome.

34:15.840 --> 34:19.180
 That's a big cost to pay for this regime.

34:19.180 --> 34:25.100
 And so whatever benefits this regime might or might not have given to the country, the

34:25.100 --> 34:30.280
 disadvantages, the downside, the costs are also really high.

34:30.280 --> 34:34.540
 So we don't want Putin lasting in power as long as Stalin.

34:34.540 --> 34:40.520
 It would be better if Russia were able to choose among options, to choose a new leader

34:40.520 --> 34:42.940
 among options.

34:42.940 --> 34:48.300
 Many people speculate that President Putin will name a successor the way Yeltsin named

34:48.300 --> 34:52.720
 Putin as his successor, President Boris Yeltsin.

34:52.720 --> 34:58.500
 And then Putin will leave the stage and allow the successor to take over.

34:58.500 --> 35:05.100
 That might seem like a good solution, but once again, we don't need a system where you

35:05.100 --> 35:09.700
 hang on for as long as possible and then nominate who's going to take over.

35:09.700 --> 35:17.820
 We need a system that has the kind of corrective mechanisms that democracies and markets have

35:17.820 --> 35:19.580
 along with rule of law.

35:19.580 --> 35:25.620
 A corrective mechanism is really important because all leaders make mistakes.

35:25.620 --> 35:32.060
 But when you can't correct for the mistakes, then the mistakes get compounded.

35:32.060 --> 35:38.340
 Putin could well, he seems to be healthy, he could well last as many years as Stalin.

35:38.340 --> 35:44.860
 It's hard to predict because events intercede sometimes and create circumstances that are

35:44.860 --> 35:51.660
 unforeseen and leaders get overthrown or have a heart attack or whatever.

35:51.660 --> 35:59.140
 There's a palace insurrection where ambitious leaders on the inside for both personal power

35:59.140 --> 36:04.020
 and patriotic reasons try to push aside an aging leader.

36:04.020 --> 36:09.820
 There are many scenarios in which Putin could not last that long, but unfortunately, right

36:09.820 --> 36:16.460
 now, you could also imagine potentially him lasting that long, which as I said, is not

36:16.460 --> 36:21.740
 an outcome if you're patriotic about Russia, it's not an outcome you would wish out to

36:21.740 --> 36:22.740
 the country.

36:22.740 --> 36:29.380
 It's, I guess, a very difficult question, but what practically do you feel is a way

36:29.380 --> 36:38.860
 out of the Putin regime, is a way out of the corruption that's deeply underlies the state?

36:38.860 --> 36:44.300
 Is a, if you look from a history perspective, is a revolution required?

36:44.300 --> 36:47.700
 Is violence required?

36:47.700 --> 36:54.060
 Is from violence within or external to the country?

36:54.060 --> 37:05.380
 Do you see, or is a powerful, is a inspiring leader enough to step in and bring democracy

37:05.380 --> 37:09.140
 and kind of the free world to Russia?

37:09.140 --> 37:11.180
 So Russia is not a failed country.

37:11.180 --> 37:17.780
 It's a middle income country with tremendous potential and has proven many times in the

37:17.780 --> 37:24.700
 past that when it gets in a bad way, it can reverse its trajectory.

37:24.700 --> 37:29.340
 Moreover, violence is rarely ever a solution.

37:29.340 --> 37:35.300
 Violence rarely, it may break an existing trend, but it's rare that violence produces

37:35.300 --> 37:38.840
 a nonviolent, sustainable, positive outcome.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.900
 It happens, but it doesn't happen frequently.

37:42.900 --> 37:53.540
 Mental upheaval is not a way always to institutionalize a better path forward because you need institutions.

37:53.540 --> 37:59.140
 People can protest as they did throughout the Middle East, and the protests didn't necessarily

37:59.140 --> 38:08.380
 lead to better systems because the step from protest to new, strong, consolidated institutions

38:08.380 --> 38:11.900
 is a colossal leap, not a small step.

38:11.900 --> 38:18.300
 What we need and what we see from history and situations like this is a group within

38:18.300 --> 38:25.280
 the power structures, which is a patriotic that sees things going down.

38:25.280 --> 38:31.360
 That is to say that sees things not being developing relative to neighbors, relative

38:31.360 --> 38:38.640
 to richer countries, relative to more successful countries, and they want to change the trajectory

38:38.640 --> 38:40.460
 of Russia.

38:40.460 --> 38:49.420
 And if they can, in a coalition fashion, unseat the current regime for a new power sharing

38:49.420 --> 38:56.180
 arrangement, which once again can be frustrating because you can't do changes immediately,

38:56.180 --> 39:00.460
 you can't do things overnight, but that's the point.

39:00.460 --> 39:04.860
 Constraints on your ability to change everything immediately and to force change overnight

39:04.860 --> 39:08.900
 is what leads to long term success potentially.

39:08.900 --> 39:12.120
 That's the sustainability of change.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.940
 So Russia needs stronger institutions.

39:14.940 --> 39:20.500
 It needs court system as well as democratic institutions.

39:20.500 --> 39:26.340
 It needs functioning, open, dynamic markets rather than monopolies.

39:26.340 --> 39:33.580
 It needs meritocracy and banks to award loans on the basis of business plans, not on the

39:33.580 --> 39:39.960
 basis of political criteria or corrupt bribery or whatever it might be.

39:39.960 --> 39:47.340
 So Russia needs those kind of functioning institutions that take time, are sometimes

39:47.340 --> 39:55.140
 slow, don't lead to a revolutionary transformation, but lead to potentially long term sustainable

39:55.140 --> 40:01.340
 growth without upheaval, without violence, without getting into a situation where all

40:01.340 --> 40:04.700
 of a sudden you need a miracle again.

40:04.700 --> 40:11.780
 Every time Russia seems to need a miracle, and that's the problem, the solution would

40:11.780 --> 40:14.380
 be not needing a miracle.

40:14.380 --> 40:17.940
 Now having said that, the potential is there.

40:17.940 --> 40:22.400
 The civilization that we call Russia is amazingly impressive.

40:22.400 --> 40:28.360
 It has delivered world class culture, world class science.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.100
 It's a great power.

40:30.100 --> 40:34.700
 It's not a great power with a strong base right now, but nonetheless it is a great power

40:34.700 --> 40:36.580
 as it acts in the world.

40:36.580 --> 40:41.660
 So I wouldn't underestimate Russia's abilities here and I wouldn't write off Russia.

40:41.660 --> 40:46.580
 I don't see it under the current regime, a renewal of the country.

40:46.580 --> 40:52.920
 But if we can have from within the regime an evolution rather than a revolution in a

40:52.920 --> 41:00.420
 positive direction, and maybe get a George Washington figure who is strong enough to

41:00.420 --> 41:06.200
 push through institutionalization rather than personalism.

41:06.200 --> 41:12.100
 So if I could ask about one particular individual, it'd be just interesting to get your comment,

41:12.100 --> 41:16.100
 but also as a representative of potential leaders, I just on this podcast talked to

41:16.100 --> 41:23.300
 Gary Kasparov, who I'm not sure if you're familiar with his, his ongoings.

41:23.300 --> 41:28.700
 So besides being a world class chess player, he's also a very outspoken activist, sort

41:28.700 --> 41:38.740
 of seeing Putin, truly seeing Putin as an enemy of the free world of democracy, of balanced

41:38.740 --> 41:40.240
 government in Russia.

41:40.240 --> 41:47.460
 What do you think of people like him specifically, or just people like him trying as leaders

41:47.460 --> 41:55.320
 to step in, to run for president, to symbolize a new chapter in Russia's future?

41:55.320 --> 41:58.100
 So we don't need individuals.

41:58.100 --> 42:04.180
 Some individuals are very impressive and they have courage and they protest and they criticize

42:04.180 --> 42:07.060
 and they organize.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.900
 We need institutions.

42:08.900 --> 42:12.380
 We need a Duma or a parliament that functions.

42:12.380 --> 42:15.320
 We need a court system that functions.

42:15.320 --> 42:24.100
 That is to say where there are a separation of powers, impartial professional civil service,

42:24.100 --> 42:28.140
 impartial professional judiciary.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.480
 Those are the things Russia needs.

42:30.480 --> 42:35.260
 It's rare that you get that from an individual, no matter how impressive, right?

42:35.260 --> 42:43.100
 We had Andrei Sakharov, who was an extraordinary individual, who developed the hydrogen bomb

42:43.100 --> 42:53.620
 under a Soviet regime, was a world class physicist, was then upset about how his scientific knowledge

42:53.620 --> 43:01.580
 and scientific achievements were being put to use and rebelled to try to put limits,

43:01.580 --> 43:08.380
 constraints, civilizing humane limits and constraints on some of the implications of

43:08.380 --> 43:10.820
 his extraordinary science.

43:10.820 --> 43:16.660
 But Sakharov, even if he had become the leader of the country, which he did not become, he

43:16.660 --> 43:22.640
 was more of a moral or spiritual leader, it still wouldn't have given you a judiciary.

43:22.640 --> 43:25.200
 It still wouldn't have given you a civil service.

43:25.200 --> 43:29.140
 It still wouldn't have given you a Duma or functioning parliament.

43:29.140 --> 43:32.820
 You need a leader in coalition with other leaders.

43:32.820 --> 43:39.000
 You need a bunch of leaders, a whole group, and they have to be divided a little bit so

43:39.000 --> 43:42.580
 that not one of them can destroy all the others.

43:42.580 --> 43:50.000
 And they have to be interested in creating institutions, not solely or predominantly

43:50.000 --> 43:52.240
 in their personal power.

43:52.240 --> 43:58.700
 And so I have no objection to outstanding individuals and to the work that they do.

43:58.700 --> 44:04.180
 But I think in institutional terms, and they need to think that way too in order to be

44:04.180 --> 44:05.180
 successful.

44:05.180 --> 44:11.260
 So if we go back to the echoes of that after the Russian Revolution with Stalin, with Lenin

44:11.260 --> 44:18.580
 and Stalin, maybe you can correct me, but there was a group of people there in that

44:18.580 --> 44:30.820
 same kind of way looking to establish institutions that were beautifully built around an ideology

44:30.820 --> 44:34.580
 that they believed is good for the world.

44:34.580 --> 44:41.260
 So sort of echoing that idea of what we're talking about, what Russia needs now, can

44:41.260 --> 44:48.880
 you, first of all, you've described a fascinating thought, which is Stalin is having amassed

44:48.880 --> 44:54.500
 arguably more power than any man in history, which is an interesting thing to think about.

44:54.500 --> 45:00.620
 But can you tell about his journey to getting that power after the Russian Revolution?

45:00.620 --> 45:08.740
 How does that perhaps echo to our current discussion about institutions and so on?

45:08.740 --> 45:14.560
 And just in general, the story I think is fascinating of how one man is able to get

45:14.560 --> 45:17.220
 more power than any other man in history.

45:17.220 --> 45:24.080
 It is a great story, not necessarily from a moral point of view, but if you're interested

45:24.080 --> 45:27.620
 in power, for sure it's an incredible story.

45:27.620 --> 45:34.260
 So we have to remember that Stalin is also a product of circumstances, not solely his

45:34.260 --> 45:38.760
 own individual drive, which is very strong.

45:38.760 --> 45:46.020
 For example, World War I breaks the czarist regime, the czarist order, imperial Russian

45:46.020 --> 45:47.620
 state.

45:47.620 --> 45:51.740
 Stalin has no participation whatsoever in World War I.

45:51.740 --> 45:56.220
 He spends World War I in exile in Siberia.

45:56.220 --> 46:06.020
 Until the downfall of the czarist autocracy in February 1917, Stalin is in Eastern Siberian

46:06.020 --> 46:07.460
 exile.

46:07.460 --> 46:12.440
 He's only able to leave Eastern Siberia when that regime falls.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.140
 He never fights in the war.

46:15.140 --> 46:21.420
 He's called up briefly towards the end of the war and is disqualified on physical grounds

46:21.420 --> 46:25.880
 because of physical deformities from being drafted.

46:25.880 --> 46:32.860
 The war continues after the czarist regime has been toppled in the capital and there's

46:32.860 --> 46:35.520
 been a revolution.

46:35.520 --> 46:40.700
 The war continues and that war is very radicalizing.

46:40.700 --> 46:47.100
 The peasants begin to seize the land after the czar falls, essentially destroying much

46:47.100 --> 46:49.180
 of the gentry class.

46:49.180 --> 46:50.540
 Stalin has nothing to do with that.

46:50.540 --> 46:57.660
 The peasants have their own revolution, seizing the land, not in law, but in fact, de facto

46:57.660 --> 47:00.160
 not de jure land ownership.

47:00.160 --> 47:08.420
 So there are these really large processes underway that Stalin is alive during, but

47:08.420 --> 47:10.980
 not a driver of.

47:10.980 --> 47:17.340
 The most improbable thing happens, which is a very small group of people around the figure

47:17.340 --> 47:23.620
 of Vladimir Lenin announces that it has seized power.

47:23.620 --> 47:30.660
 Now by this time in October 1917, the government that has replaced the czar, the so called

47:30.660 --> 47:34.220
 provisional government, has failed.

47:34.220 --> 47:39.280
 And so there's not so much power to seize from the provisional government.

47:39.280 --> 47:43.220
 What Lenin does is he does a coup on the left.

47:43.220 --> 47:51.020
 That is to say, Soviets or councils, as we would call them in English, which represent

47:51.020 --> 47:56.120
 people's power or the masses participating in politics, a kind of radical grassroots

47:56.120 --> 48:04.140
 democracy are extremely popular all over the country and not dominated by any one group,

48:04.140 --> 48:09.500
 but predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist.

48:09.500 --> 48:16.180
 Russia has an election during the war, a free and fair election for the most part, despite

48:16.180 --> 48:24.700
 the war at the end of 1917, in December 1917, and three quarters plus of the country votes

48:24.700 --> 48:27.980
 socialist in some form or another.

48:27.980 --> 48:34.460
 So the battle was over the definition of socialism and who had the right to participate in defining

48:34.460 --> 48:39.460
 socialism, not only what it would be, but who had the right to decide.

48:39.460 --> 48:47.400
 So there's a coup by Lenin's group known as the Bolsheviks against all the other socialists.

48:47.400 --> 48:54.780
 And so Lenin declares a seizure of power whereby the old government has failed, people's power,

48:54.780 --> 49:01.420
 the councils known as the Soviets are going to take their place, and Lenin seizes power

49:01.420 --> 49:03.540
 in the name of the Soviets.

49:03.540 --> 49:09.340
 So it's a coup against the left, against the rest of the left, not against the provisional

49:09.340 --> 49:13.220
 government that has replaced the czar, which has already failed.

49:13.220 --> 49:21.700
 And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin in this crazy seizure of power

49:21.700 --> 49:27.360
 on the left against the rest of the left in October 1917, which we know is the October

49:27.360 --> 49:35.020
 Revolution, and I call the October coup as many other historians call.

49:35.020 --> 49:38.740
 The October Revolution happened after the seizure of power.

49:38.740 --> 49:44.500
 What's interesting about this episode is that the leftists who seize power in the name of

49:44.500 --> 49:49.860
 the Soviets, in the name of the masses, in the name of people's power, they retain their

49:49.860 --> 49:51.560
 hold.

49:51.560 --> 49:56.760
 Many times in history, there's a seizure of power by the left, and they fail.

49:56.760 --> 49:58.260
 They collapse.

49:58.260 --> 50:03.580
 They're cleaned out by an army or what we call forces of order, by counter revolutionary

50:03.580 --> 50:04.980
 forces.

50:04.980 --> 50:09.020
 Lenin's revolution, Lenin's coup is successful.

50:09.020 --> 50:12.660
 It is able to hold power, not just seize power.

50:12.660 --> 50:21.780
 They win a civil war, and they're entrenched in the heart of the country already by 1921.

50:21.780 --> 50:23.940
 Stalin is part of that group.

50:23.940 --> 50:26.660
 Lenin needs somebody to run.

50:26.660 --> 50:32.580
 This new regime in the kind of nitty gritty way, Lenin is the leader, the undisputed leader

50:32.580 --> 50:38.260
 in the Bolshevik party, which changes their name to communists in 1918.

50:38.260 --> 50:45.620
 He makes Stalin the general secretary of the communist party.

50:45.620 --> 50:52.900
 He creates a new position, which hadn't existed before, a kind of day to day political manager,

50:52.900 --> 50:54.980
 a right hand man.

50:54.980 --> 50:57.660
 Not because Lenin is looking to replace himself.

50:57.660 --> 51:02.340
 He's looking to institutionalize a helpmate, a right hand man.

51:02.340 --> 51:08.060
 He does this in the spring of 1922.

51:08.060 --> 51:12.600
 Stalin is named to this position, which Lenin has created expressly for Stalin.

51:12.600 --> 51:19.060
 So there has been a coup on the left whereby the Bolsheviks who become communists have

51:19.060 --> 51:25.580
 seized power against the rest of the socialists and anarchists and the entire left.

51:25.580 --> 51:30.660
 And then there's an institutionalization of a position known as general secretary of the

51:30.660 --> 51:34.420
 communist party, right hand man of Lenin.

51:34.420 --> 51:40.220
 Less than six weeks after Lenin has created this position and installed Stalin, Lenin

51:40.220 --> 51:50.060
 has a stroke, a major stroke, and never really returns as a full actor to power before he

51:50.060 --> 51:55.100
 dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924.

51:55.100 --> 52:00.340
 So a position is created for Stalin to run things on Lenin's behalf.

52:00.340 --> 52:02.860
 And then Lenin has a stroke.

52:02.860 --> 52:09.780
 And so Stalin now has this new position general secretary, but he's the right hand of a person

52:09.780 --> 52:15.500
 who's no longer exercising day to day control over affairs.

52:15.500 --> 52:21.420
 Stalin then uses this new position to create a personal dictatorship inside the Bolshevik

52:21.420 --> 52:25.780
 dictatorship, which is the remarkable story I tried to tell.

52:25.780 --> 52:30.540
 So is there anything nefarious about any of what you just described?

52:30.540 --> 52:37.100
 So it seems conveniently that the position is created just for Stalin.

52:37.100 --> 52:42.060
 There was a few other brilliant people, arguably more brilliant than Stalin in the vicinity

52:42.060 --> 52:43.060
 of Lenin.

52:43.060 --> 52:45.720
 Why was Stalin chosen?

52:45.720 --> 52:51.300
 Why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill?

52:51.300 --> 52:56.940
 It's perhaps a conspiratorial question, but is there anything nefarious about any of this

52:56.940 --> 53:02.780
 historical trajectory to power that Stalin took in creating the personal dictatorship?

53:02.780 --> 53:07.500
 So history is full of contingency and surprise.

53:07.500 --> 53:11.620
 After something happens, we all think it's inevitable.

53:11.620 --> 53:14.040
 It had to happen that way.

53:14.040 --> 53:16.260
 Everything was leading up to it.

53:16.260 --> 53:24.820
 So Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933, and the Nazi regime gets institutionalized

53:24.820 --> 53:29.220
 by several of his moves after being named chancellor.

53:29.220 --> 53:34.260
 And so all German history becomes a story of the Nazi rise to power, Hitler's rise to

53:34.260 --> 53:35.460
 power.

53:35.460 --> 53:40.780
 Every trend tendency is bent into that outcome.

53:40.780 --> 53:46.800
 Things which don't seem related to that outcome all of a sudden get bent in that direction.

53:46.800 --> 53:51.900
 And other trends that were going on are no longer examined because they didn't lead to

53:51.900 --> 53:53.500
 that outcome.

53:53.500 --> 53:58.740
 But Hitler's becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933 was not inevitable.

53:58.740 --> 54:00.440
 It was contingent.

54:00.440 --> 54:04.660
 He was offered the position by the traditional conservatives.

54:04.660 --> 54:09.820
 He's part of the radical right and the traditional right named him chancellor.

54:09.820 --> 54:15.580
 The Nazi party never outright won an election that was free and fair before Hitler came

54:15.580 --> 54:16.780
 to power.

54:16.780 --> 54:22.180
 And in fact, its votes on the eve of Hitler becoming chancellor declined relative to the

54:22.180 --> 54:24.380
 previous election.

54:24.380 --> 54:33.980
 So there's contingency in history, and so Lenin's illness, his stroke, the neurological

54:33.980 --> 54:40.100
 and blood problems that he had were not a structure in history.

54:40.100 --> 54:45.720
 In other words, if Lenin had been a healthier figure, Stalin might never have become the

54:45.720 --> 54:47.940
 Stalin that we know.

54:47.940 --> 54:53.020
 That's not to say that all history is accidental, just that we need to relate the structural,

54:53.020 --> 54:57.820
 the larger structural factors to the contingent factors.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.540
 Why did Lenin pick Stalin?

54:59.540 --> 55:06.700
 Well, Stalin was a very effective organizer, and the position was an organizational position.

55:06.700 --> 55:08.420
 Stalin could get things done.

55:08.420 --> 55:11.620
 He would carry out assignments no matter how difficult.

55:11.620 --> 55:16.100
 He wouldn't complain that it was hard work or too much work.

55:16.100 --> 55:22.420
 He wouldn't go off womanizing and drinking and ignore his responsibilities.

55:22.420 --> 55:28.140
 Lenin chose Stalin among other options because he thought Stalin was the better option.

55:28.140 --> 55:32.140
 Once again, he wasn't choosing his successor because he didn't know he was going to have

55:32.140 --> 55:34.020
 this stroke.

55:34.020 --> 55:40.780
 Lenin had some serious illnesses, but he had never had a major stroke before.

55:40.780 --> 55:50.340
 So the choice was made based upon Stalin's organizational skills and promise against

55:50.340 --> 55:52.660
 the others who were in the regime.

55:52.660 --> 55:57.900
 Now, they can seem more brilliant than Stalin, but he was more effective, and I'm not sure

55:57.900 --> 55:59.100
 they were very brilliant.

55:59.100 --> 56:04.420
 Well, he was exceptionally competent actually at the tasks for running a government, the

56:04.420 --> 56:07.020
 executive branch, right, of a dictator.

56:07.020 --> 56:08.020
 Yes.

56:08.020 --> 56:11.780
 He turned out to be very adept at being a dictator.

56:11.780 --> 56:18.160
 And so if he had been chosen by Lenin and had not been very good, he would have been

56:18.160 --> 56:20.060
 pushed aside by others.

56:20.060 --> 56:21.780
 Yeah.

56:21.780 --> 56:24.780
 You can get a position by accident.

56:24.780 --> 56:30.700
 You can be named because you're someone's friend or someone's relative, but to hold

56:30.700 --> 56:36.860
 that position, to hold that position in difficult circumstances, and then to build effectively

56:36.860 --> 56:44.060
 a superpower on all that bloodshed, right, you have to be skilled in some way.

56:44.060 --> 56:49.620
 It can't be just the accident that brings you to power because if accident brings you

56:49.620 --> 56:52.340
 to power, it won't last.

56:52.340 --> 56:57.220
 Just like we discovered with Putin, he had some qualities that we didn't foresee at the

56:57.220 --> 57:02.780
 beginning, and he's been able to hold power, not just be named.

57:02.780 --> 57:06.260
 Now, Putin and Stalin are very different people.

57:06.260 --> 57:08.100
 These are very different regimes.

57:08.100 --> 57:10.940
 I wouldn't put them in the same sentence.

57:10.940 --> 57:14.480
 My point is not that one resembles the other.

57:14.480 --> 57:20.980
 My point is that when people come to power for contingent reasons, they don't stay in

57:20.980 --> 57:23.980
 power unless they're able to manage it.

57:23.980 --> 57:29.340
 And Stalin was able to build a personal dictatorship inside that dictatorship.

57:29.340 --> 57:33.700
 He was cunning, he was ruthless, and he was a workaholic.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.260
 He was very diligent.

57:35.260 --> 57:41.560
 He had a phenomenal memory, and so he could remember people's names and faces and events.

57:41.560 --> 57:48.100
 And this was very advantageous for him as he built the machine that became the Soviet

57:48.100 --> 57:50.540
 state and bureaucracy.

57:50.540 --> 57:54.660
 One of the things, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, what you've made me realize

57:54.660 --> 58:02.960
 is this wasn't some kind of manipulative personality trying to gain more power solely, like kind

58:02.960 --> 58:10.460
 of an evil picture of a person, but he truly believed in communism.

58:10.460 --> 58:13.740
 As far as I can understand, again, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but he wanted to

58:13.740 --> 58:26.160
 build a better world by infusing communism into the country, perhaps into the whole world.

58:26.160 --> 58:35.260
 So maybe my question is what role does communism as an idea, as an ideology play in all of

58:35.260 --> 58:36.260
 this?

58:36.260 --> 58:41.100
 What was the power in the people of the time, in the Russian people, actually just the whole

58:41.100 --> 58:43.380
 20th century?

58:43.380 --> 58:44.880
 You're right.

58:44.880 --> 58:48.180
 Stalin was a true believer, and this is very important.

58:48.180 --> 58:54.260
 He was also hungry for power and for personal power, but just as you said, not for power's

58:54.260 --> 58:57.080
 sake, not only for power.

58:57.080 --> 59:04.720
 He was interested in enacting communism in reality and also in building a powerful state.

59:04.720 --> 59:11.800
 He was a statist, a traditional Russian statist in the imperial sense, and this won him a

59:11.800 --> 59:14.000
 lot of followers.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.140
 The fact that they knew he was a hardcore true believing communist won him a lot of

59:19.140 --> 59:26.000
 followers among the communists, and the fact that he was a hardcore defender of Russian

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
 state interests now in the Soviet guise also won him a lot of followers.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.740
 Sometimes those groups overlapped, the communists and the Russian patriots, and sometimes they

59:37.740 --> 59:43.660
 were completely different groups, but both of them shared an admiration for Stalin's

59:43.660 --> 59:48.620
 dedication to those goals and his abilities to enact them.

59:48.620 --> 59:55.260
 And so it's very important to understand that however thirsty he was for power, and he was

59:55.260 --> 1:00:02.560
 very thirsty for power, that he was also driven by ideals.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:11.380
 Now I don't necessarily think that everyone around Stalin shared those ideals.

1:00:11.380 --> 1:00:16.260
 We have to be careful not to make everybody into a communist true believer, not to make

1:00:16.260 --> 1:00:25.980
 everybody into a great statist Russian patriot, but they were widespread and powerful attractions

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:27.900
 for a lot of people.

1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:35.520
 And so Stalin's ability to communicate to people that he was dedicated to those pursuits

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:40.220
 and his ability to drive towards them were part of his appeal.

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:47.780
 Where he also resorted to manipulation, he also resorted to violence, he lied, he spoke

1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:55.660
 out of all sides of his mouth, he slandered other people, he sabotaged potential rivals.

1:00:55.660 --> 1:01:03.640
 He used every underhanded method, and then some, in order to build his personal dictatorship.

1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:09.060
 Now he justified this, as you said, by appeals to communism and to Soviet power.

1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:10.700
 To himself as well too.

1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:12.680
 To himself and to others.

1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:20.220
 And so he justified it in his own mind and to others, but certainly any means, right,

1:01:20.220 --> 1:01:24.840
 were acceptable to him to achieve these ends.

1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:31.460
 And he identified his personal power with communism and with Russian glory in the world.

1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:37.780
 So he felt that he was the only one who could be trusted, who could be relied upon to build

1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:38.780
 these things.

1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:43.980
 Now, we put ourselves back in that time period.

1:01:43.980 --> 1:01:48.660
 The Great Depression was a very difficult time for the capitalist system.

1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:58.860
 There was mass unemployment, a lot of hardship, fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan.

1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:04.900
 There were a lot of associations that were negative with the kind of capitalist system

1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:14.420
 that was not a hundred percent, not a monolith, but had a lot of authoritarian incarnations.

1:02:14.420 --> 1:02:21.040
 There was imperialism, colonies that even the democratic rule of law capitalist states

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:25.900
 had non democratic, non rule of law colonies under their rule.

1:02:25.900 --> 1:02:32.920
 So the image and reality of capitalism during that time period between World War I and World

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:37.540
 War II was very different from how it would become later.

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:43.620
 And so in that time period, in that interwar conjuncture after World War I, before World

1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:51.800
 War II, communism held some appeal inside the Soviet Union for sure, but even outside

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:56.740
 the Soviet Union because the image and reality of capitalism disappointed many people.

1:02:56.740 --> 1:03:01.020
 Now, in the end, communism was significantly worse.

1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:06.700
 Many more victims and the system of course would eventually implode.

1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:11.200
 But nonetheless, there were real problems that communism tried to address.

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:12.980
 It didn't solve those problems.

1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:17.220
 It was not a solution, but it didn't come out of nowhere.

1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:20.860
 It came out of the context of that interwar period.

1:03:20.860 --> 1:03:29.500
 And so Stalin's rule, some people saw it as potentially a better option than imperialism,

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:32.740
 fascism and Great Depression.

1:03:32.740 --> 1:03:34.980
 Having said that, they were wrong.

1:03:34.980 --> 1:03:40.300
 It turned out that Stalin wasn't a better alternative to markets and private property

1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:43.540
 and rule of law and democracy.

1:03:43.540 --> 1:03:51.580
 However, that didn't become clearer to people until after World War II, after Nazism had

1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:58.500
 been defeated, Imperial Japan had been defeated, a fascist Italy had been defeated and decolonization

1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:04.620
 had happened around the world, and there was a middle class economic boom in the period

1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:11.100
 from the late 40s through the 70s that created a kind of mass middle class in many societies.

1:04:11.100 --> 1:04:21.660
 So capitalism rose from the ashes as it were, and this changed the game for Stalin and communism.

1:04:21.660 --> 1:04:29.700
 Capitalism is about an alternative to capitalism, and if that alternative is not superior, there's

1:04:29.700 --> 1:04:32.780
 no reason for communism to exist.

1:04:32.780 --> 1:04:41.500
 But if capitalism is in foul odor, if people have a bad opinion, a strong critique of capitalism,

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:47.020
 there can be appeal to alternatives, and that's kind of what happened with Stalin's rule.

1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:52.980
 But after World War II, the context changed a lot, capitalism was very different, much

1:04:52.980 --> 1:05:00.300
 more successful, nonviolent compared to what it was in the interwar period.

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:05.620
 And the Soviet Union had a tough time competing against that new context.

1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:12.180
 Now today we see similarly that the image and reality of capitalism is on the question

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:19.860
 again, which leads some people to find an answer in socialism as an alternative.

1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:23.220
 So you just kind of painted a beautiful picture of comparison.

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:29.080
 This is the way we think about ideologies because we, is what's working better.

1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:34.660
 Do you separate in your mind the ideals of communism to the Stalinist implementation

1:05:34.660 --> 1:05:41.540
 of communism, and again, capitalism and American implementation of capitalism?

1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:51.940
 And as we look at now the 21st century where, yes, this idea of socialism being a potential

1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:56.240
 political system that we would, or economic system we would operate under in the United

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:59.580
 States rising up again as an idea.

1:05:59.580 --> 1:06:05.740
 So how do we think about that again in the 21st century, about these ideas, fundamental

1:06:05.740 --> 1:06:07.780
 deep ideas of communism and capitalism?

1:06:07.780 --> 1:06:14.860
 Yeah, so in the Marxist schema, there was something called feudalism, which was supposedly

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:19.300
 destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created capitalism.

1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:25.020
 And then the working class was supposed to destroy capitalism and create socialism.

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.020
 But socialism wasn't the end stage.

1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:29.780
 The end stage was going to be communism.

1:06:29.780 --> 1:06:37.620
 So that's why the communist party in the Soviet Union first built socialism transcending capitalism.

1:06:37.620 --> 1:06:43.640
 The next stage was socialism and the end game, the final stage was communism.

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:47.540
 So their version of socialism was derived from Marx.

1:06:47.540 --> 1:06:57.420
 And Marx argued that the problem was capitalism had been very beneficial for a while.

1:06:57.420 --> 1:07:03.700
 It had produced greater wealth and greater opportunity than feudalism had.

1:07:03.700 --> 1:07:08.740
 But then it had come to serve only the narrow interests of the so called bourgeoisie or

1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:11.220
 the capitalists themselves.

1:07:11.220 --> 1:07:17.560
 And so for humanity's sake, the universal class, the working class needed to overthrow

1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:24.660
 capitalism in order for greater productivity, greater wealth to be produced for all of humanity

1:07:24.660 --> 1:07:27.940
 to flourish and on a higher level.

1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:32.920
 So you couldn't have socialism unless you destroyed capitalism.

1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:40.660
 So that meant no markets, no private property, no so called parliaments or bourgeois parliaments

1:07:40.660 --> 1:07:42.300
 as they were called.

1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:50.240
 So you got socialism in Marx's schema by transcending, by eliminating capitalism.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:55.440
 Now Marx also called for freedom.

1:07:55.440 --> 1:08:00.540
 He said that this elimination of markets and private property and bourgeois parliaments

1:08:00.540 --> 1:08:04.340
 would produce greater freedom in addition to greater abundance.

1:08:04.340 --> 1:08:15.860
 However, everywhere this was tried, it produced tyranny and mass violence, death and shortages.

1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:16.860
 Everywhere it was tried.

1:08:16.860 --> 1:08:19.820
 There's no exception in historical terms.

1:08:19.820 --> 1:08:22.300
 And so it's very interesting.

1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:26.820
 Marx insisted that capitalism had to be eliminated.

1:08:26.820 --> 1:08:28.900
 You couldn't have markets.

1:08:28.900 --> 1:08:29.900
 Markets were chaos.

1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:31.260
 You needed planning.

1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:35.780
 You couldn't have hiring of wage labor.

1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.980
 That was wage slavery.

1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:43.020
 You couldn't have private property because that was a form of theft.

1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:50.540
 So in the Marxist scheme, somehow you were going to eliminate capitalism and get to freedom.

1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:52.280
 It turned out you didn't get to freedom.

1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:58.660
 So then people said, well, you can't blame Marx because he said we needed freedom.

1:08:58.660 --> 1:09:00.580
 He was pro freedom.

1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:04.580
 So it's kind of like dropping a nuclear bomb.

1:09:04.580 --> 1:09:13.960
 You say you're going to drop a nuclear bomb, but you want to minimize civilian casualties.

1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:18.300
 So the dropping of the nuclear bomb is the elimination of markets, private property and

1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:21.180
 parliaments.

1:09:21.180 --> 1:09:25.760
 But you're going to bring freedom or you're going to minimize civilian casualties.

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:34.860
 So you drop the nuclear bomb, you eliminate the capitalism and you get famine, deportation,

1:09:34.860 --> 1:09:40.880
 no constraints on executive power and not abundance, but shortages.

1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:43.500
 And people say, well, that's not what Mark said.

1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:44.660
 That's not what I said.

1:09:44.660 --> 1:09:47.820
 I said, I wanted to minimize civilian casualties.

1:09:47.820 --> 1:09:52.260
 The nuclear bomb goes off and there's mass civilian casualties.

1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:58.620
 And you keep saying, but I said, drop the bomb, but minimize civilian casualties.

1:09:58.620 --> 1:09:59.680
 So that's where we are.

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:01.860
 That's history, not philosophy.

1:10:01.860 --> 1:10:07.360
 I'm speaking about historical examples, all the cases that we have.

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:11.900
 Marx was not a theorist of inequality.

1:10:11.900 --> 1:10:22.240
 Marx was a theorist of alienation, of dehumanization, of fundamental constraints or what he called

1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:29.620
 fetters on productivity and on wealth, which he all attributed to capitalism.

1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:31.880
 Marx wasn't bothered by inequality.

1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:37.060
 He was bothered by something deeper, something worse, right?

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:44.540
 Those socialists who figured this out, who understood that if you drop the nuclear bomb,

1:10:44.540 --> 1:10:48.380
 there was no way to minimize civilian casualties.

1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:54.820
 All socialists who came to understand that if you eliminated capitalism, markets, private

1:10:54.820 --> 1:11:00.420
 property and parliaments, if you eliminated that, you wouldn't get freedom.

1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:07.960
 Those Marxists, those socialists became what we would call social Democrats or people who

1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:14.520
 would use the state to regulate the market, not to eliminate the market.

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:22.100
 They would use the state to redistribute income, not to destroy private property and markets.

1:11:22.100 --> 1:11:29.460
 And so this in the Marxist schema was apostasy because they were accepting markets and private

1:11:29.460 --> 1:11:30.460
 property.

1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:33.580
 They were accepting alienation and wage slavery.

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:38.500
 They were accepting capitalism in principle, but they wanted to fix it.

1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:40.100
 They wanted to ameliorate.

1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:42.240
 They wanted to regulate.

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:50.340
 And so they became what was denounced as revisionists, not true Marxists, not real revolutionaries,

1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:54.460
 but parliamentary road, parliamentarians.

1:11:54.460 --> 1:12:01.060
 We know this as normal politics, normal social democratic politics from the European case

1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:09.180
 or from the American case, but they are not asking to eliminate capitalism, blaming capitalism,

1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:11.880
 blaming markets and private property.

1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:20.540
 So this rift among the socialists, the ones who are for elimination of capitalism, transcending

1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:27.060
 capitalism, otherwise you could never, ever get to abundance and freedom in the Marxist

1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:34.260
 schema versus those who accept capitalism, but want to regulate and redistribute.

1:12:34.260 --> 1:12:39.220
 That rift on the left has been with us almost from the beginning.

1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:45.820
 It's a kind of civil war on the left between the Leninists and the social democrats or

1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:50.580
 the revisionists as they're known pejoratively by the Leninists.

1:12:50.580 --> 1:13:00.380
 We have the same confusion today in the world today where people also cite Marx saying capitalism

1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:08.820
 is a dead end and we need to drop that nuclear bomb and get freedom, get no civilian casualties

1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:13.940
 versus those who say, yes, there are inequities.

1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:18.340
 There's a lack of equality of opportunity.

1:13:18.340 --> 1:13:22.460
 There are many other issues that we need to deal with and we can fix those issues.

1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:24.980
 We can regulate, we can redistribute.

1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:27.980
 I'm not advocating this as a political position.

1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:30.860
 I'm not taking a political position myself.

1:13:30.860 --> 1:13:36.260
 I'm just saying that there's a confusion on the left between those who accept capitalism

1:13:36.260 --> 1:13:42.220
 and want to regulate it versus those who think capitalism is inherently evil and if we eliminate

1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:48.380
 it we'll get to a better world when in fact history shows that if you eliminate capitalism

1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:50.360
 you get to a worse world.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:54.660
 The problems might be real, but the solutions are worse.

1:13:54.660 --> 1:14:00.780
 From history's lessons, now we have deep painful lessons, but there's not that many of them.

1:14:00.780 --> 1:14:04.880
 You know, our history is relatively short as a human species.

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:13.660
 Do we have a good answer on the left of Leninist, Marxist versus Social Democrat versus capitalism

1:14:13.660 --> 1:14:18.340
 versus any anarchy?

1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:23.660
 Do we have sufficient samples from history to make better decisions about the future

1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:25.580
 of our politics and economics?

1:14:25.580 --> 1:14:26.700
 For sure.

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:34.020
 We have the American Revolution, which was a revolution not about class, not about workers,

1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:39.140
 not about a so called universal class of the working class, elimination of capitalism markets

1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:44.060
 and the bourgeoisie, but was about the category citizen.

1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:52.040
 It was about universal humanity where everyone in theory could be part of it as a citizen.

1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:55.540
 The revolution fell short of its own ideals.

1:14:55.540 --> 1:14:58.220
 Not everyone was a citizen.

1:14:58.220 --> 1:15:03.220
 For example, if you didn't own property, you were a male but didn't own property.

1:15:03.220 --> 1:15:06.000
 You didn't have full rights of a citizen.

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.300
 If you were a female, whether you own property or not, you weren't a full citizen.

1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:18.940
 If you were imported from Africa against your will, you were a slave and not a citizen.

1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:27.660
 And so not everyone was afforded the rights in actuality that were declared in principle.

1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:35.500
 However, over time, the category citizen could expand and slaves could be emancipated and

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:37.180
 they could get the right to vote.

1:15:37.180 --> 1:15:40.500
 They could become citizens.

1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:45.900
 Nonproperty owning males could get the right to vote and become full citizens.

1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:49.240
 Females could get the right to vote and become full citizens.

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:55.980
 In fact, eventually my mother was able to get a credit card in her own name in the 1970s

1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:59.660
 without my father having to co sign the paperwork.

1:15:59.660 --> 1:16:02.140
 It took a long time.

1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:09.300
 But nonetheless, the category citizen can expand and it can become a universal category.

1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:17.360
 So we have that, the citizen universal humanity model of the American Revolution, which was

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:23.860
 deeply flawed at the time it was introduced, but fixable over time.

1:16:23.860 --> 1:16:28.500
 We also had that separation of powers and constraint on executive power that we began

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:30.260
 this conversation with.

1:16:30.260 --> 1:16:37.160
 That was also institutionalized in the American Revolution because they were afraid of tyranny.

1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:41.080
 They were afraid of unconstrained executive power.

1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:48.260
 So they built a system that would contain that, constrain it institutionally, not circumstantially.

1:16:48.260 --> 1:16:50.500
 So that's a great gift.

1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:58.040
 Within that universal category of citizen, which has over time come closer to fulfilling

1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:00.260
 its original promise.

1:17:00.260 --> 1:17:05.900
 And within those institutional constraints, that separation of powers, constraint on executive

1:17:05.900 --> 1:17:14.080
 power, within that we've developed what we might call normal politics, left right politics.

1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:20.980
 People can be in favor of redistribution, and government action and people can be in

1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:29.520
 favor of small government, hands off government, no redistribution or less redistribution.

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:35.260
 That's the normal left right political spectrum, where you respect the institutions and separation

1:17:35.260 --> 1:17:37.340
 of powers.

1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:42.680
 And you respect the universal category of citizenship and equality before the law and

1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:44.620
 everything else.

1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:49.220
 I don't see any problems with that whatsoever.

1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:55.460
 I see that as a great gift, not just to this country, but around the world and other places

1:17:55.460 --> 1:18:00.020
 besides the United States have developed this.

1:18:00.020 --> 1:18:07.020
 The problems arise at the extremes, the far left and the far right that don't recognize

1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:14.180
 the legitimacy either of capitalism or of democratic rule of law institutions.

1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:17.700
 And they want to eliminate constraints on executive power.

1:18:17.700 --> 1:18:23.660
 They want to control the public sphere or diminish the independence of the media.

1:18:23.660 --> 1:18:28.700
 They want to take away markets or private property and redistribution becomes something

1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:30.660
 bigger than just redistribution.

1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:37.380
 It becomes actually that original Marxist idea of transcending capitalism.

1:18:37.380 --> 1:18:41.740
 So I'm not bothered by the left or the right.

1:18:41.740 --> 1:18:45.220
 I think they're normal and we should have that debate.

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:50.980
 We're a gigantic, diverse country of many different political points of view.

1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:57.900
 I'm troubled only by the extremes that are against the system qua system that want to

1:18:57.900 --> 1:19:03.900
 get rid of it and supposedly that will be the bright path to the future.

1:19:03.900 --> 1:19:08.500
 History tells us that the far left and the far right are wrong about that.

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:13.140
 But once again, this doesn't mean that you have to be a social democrat.

1:19:13.140 --> 1:19:15.420
 You could be a libertarian.

1:19:15.420 --> 1:19:17.380
 You could be a conservative.

1:19:17.380 --> 1:19:19.160
 You could be a centrist.

1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:24.060
 You could be conservative on some issues and liberal on other issues.

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:28.300
 All of that comes under what I would presume to be normal politics.

1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:31.920
 And I see that as the important corrective mechanism.

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:39.580
 Normal politics and market economies, non monopolistic, open, free and dynamic market

1:19:39.580 --> 1:19:40.580
 economies.

1:19:40.580 --> 1:19:47.380
 I don't like concentrations of power politically and I don't like concentrations of power economically.

1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:50.020
 I like competition in the political realm.

1:19:50.020 --> 1:19:53.580
 I like competition in the economic realm.

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.260
 This is not perfect.

1:19:55.260 --> 1:20:03.900
 It's constantly needs to be protected and reinvented and there are flaws that are fundamental

1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:11.260
 and need to be adjusted and addressed and everything else, especially equality of opportunity.

1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:18.480
 Equality of outcome is unreachable and is a mistake because it produces perverse and

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.900
 unintended consequences.

1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:27.620
 Equality of outcome attempts, attempts to make people equal on the outcome side, but

1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:33.060
 attempts to make them more equal on the front end, on the opportunity side.

1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:36.380
 That's really, really important for a healthy society.

1:20:36.380 --> 1:20:38.740
 That's where we've fallen down.

1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:46.780
 Our schools are not providing equality of opportunity for the majority of people in

1:20:46.780 --> 1:20:49.180
 all of our school systems.

1:20:49.180 --> 1:20:51.260
 And so I see problems there.

1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:59.820
 I see a need to invest in ourselves, invest in infrastructure, invest in human capital,

1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:05.860
 create greater equality of opportunity, but also to make sure that we have good governance

1:21:05.860 --> 1:21:11.260
 because governance is the variable that enables you to do all these other things.

1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:17.220
 I've watched quite a bit, returning back to Putin, I've watched quite a few interviews

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:24.140
 with Putin and conversations, especially because I speak Russian fluently, I can understand

1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:30.780
 often the translations lose a lot.

1:21:30.780 --> 1:21:40.620
 I find the man putting morality aside very deep and interesting.

1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:46.820
 And I found almost no interview with him to get at that depth.

1:21:46.820 --> 1:21:54.820
 I was very hopeful for the Oliver Stone documentary and with him, and to me, because I deeply

1:21:54.820 --> 1:22:00.660
 respect Oliver Stone as a filmmaker in general, but it was a complete failure in my eyes,

1:22:00.660 --> 1:22:03.300
 that interview.

1:22:03.300 --> 1:22:11.740
 The lack of, I mean, I suppose you could toss it up to a language barrier, but a complete

1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:16.340
 lack of diving deep into the person is what I saw.

1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:25.340
 My question is a strange one, but if you were to sit down with Putin and have a conversation,

1:22:25.340 --> 1:22:30.660
 or perhaps if you were to sit down with Stalin and have a conversation, what kind of questions

1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:32.900
 would you ask?

1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:36.460
 This wouldn't be televised unless you want it to be.

1:22:36.460 --> 1:22:43.020
 So this is only you, so you're allowed to ask about some of the questions that are sort

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:49.740
 of not socially acceptable, meaning putting morality aside, getting into depth of the

1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:50.820
 human character.

1:22:50.820 --> 1:22:52.820
 What would you ask?

1:22:52.820 --> 1:22:57.460
 So once again, they're very different personalities and very different time periods and very different

1:22:57.460 --> 1:22:58.460
 regimes.

1:22:58.460 --> 1:23:08.180
 So what I would talk to Stalin about and Putin about are not in the same category necessarily.

1:23:08.180 --> 1:23:11.120
 So let's take Putin.

1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:16.500
 So I would ask him where he thinks this is going, where he thinks Russia is going to

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:20.340
 be in 25 years or 50 years.

1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:23.140
 What's the long term vision?

1:23:23.140 --> 1:23:26.700
 What does he anticipate the current trends are going to produce?

1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:35.040
 Is he under the illusion that Russia is on the upswing, that things are actually going

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:41.740
 pretty well, that in 25 years Russia is going to still be a great power with a tremendous

1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:48.920
 dynamic economy and a lot of high tech and a lot of human capital and wonderful infrastructure

1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:56.420
 and a very high standard of living and a secure borders and sense of security at home.

1:23:56.420 --> 1:24:05.340
 Does he think the current path is leading in that direction and if not, if he understands

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:12.180
 that the current trajectory does not provide for those kinds of circumstances, does it

1:24:12.180 --> 1:24:14.740
 bother him?

1:24:14.740 --> 1:24:16.540
 Does he worry about that?

1:24:16.540 --> 1:24:20.020
 Does he care about the future 25 or 50 years from now?

1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:22.340
 Deep down, what do you think his answer is?

1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:23.340
 The honest answer?

1:24:23.340 --> 1:24:29.660
 He thinks he's on that trajectory already or he doesn't care about that long term trajectory.

1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:31.760
 So that's the mystery for me with him.

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.340
 He's clever.

1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:36.360
 He has tremendous sources of information.

1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:42.880
 He has great experience now as a world leader having served for effectively longer than

1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:47.720
 Leonid Brezhnev's long 18 year reign.

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:53.560
 And so Putin has accumulated a great deal of experience at the highest level compared

1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:55.740
 to where he started.

1:24:55.740 --> 1:25:03.000
 And so I'm interested to understand how he sees this long term evolution or non evolution

1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:10.680
 of Russia and whether he believes he's got them on the right trajectory or whether if

1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:12.480
 he doesn't believe that he cares.

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:16.760
 I have no idea because I've never spoken to him about this, but I would love to hear the

1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:18.700
 answer.

1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:23.360
 Sometimes you have to ask questions not directly like that, but you have to come a little bit

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:25.280
 sideways.

1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:30.000
 You can elicit answers from people by making them feel comfortable and coming sideways

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000
 with them.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.080
 And just a quick question.

1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:38.160
 So that's talking about Russia, Putin's role in Russia.

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:43.820
 Do you think it's interesting to ask, and you could say the same for Stalin, the more

1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:50.640
 personal question of how do you feel yourself about this whole thing?

1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:59.000
 About your life, about your legacy, looking at the person that's one of the most powerful

1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:04.760
 and important people in the history of civilization, both Putin and Stalin, you could argue.

1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:05.760
 Yeah.

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:11.480
 Once you experience power at that level, it becomes something that's almost necessary

1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:14.280
 for you as a human being.

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:15.400
 It's a drug.

1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:17.360
 It's an aphrodisiac.

1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:18.920
 It's a feeling.

1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:26.560
 You know, you go to the gym to exercise and the endorphins, the chemicals get released.

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:34.680
 And even if you're tired or you're sore, you get this massive chemical change, which has

1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:39.640
 very dynamic effects on how you feel and the kind of level of energy you have for the rest

1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:41.120
 of the day.

1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:46.680
 And if you do that for a long time and then you don't do it for a while, you're like a

1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:49.760
 drug addict not getting your fix.

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:50.760
 You miss it.

1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:55.200
 Your body misses that release of endorphins to a certain extent.

1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.000
 That's how power works for people like Putin.

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:04.640
 That's how power works for people who run universities or are secretaries of state or

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:08.360
 run corporations, fill in the blank.

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:14.720
 In whatever ways power is exercised, it becomes almost a drug for people.

1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:17.940
 It becomes something that's difficult for them to give up.

1:27:17.940 --> 1:27:20.360
 It becomes a part of who they are.

1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:25.720
 It becomes necessary for their sense of self and well being.

1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:30.840
 The greatest people, the people I admire the most are the ones that can step away from

1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:40.520
 power, can give up the drug, can be satisfied, can be stronger even by walking away from

1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:45.360
 continued power when they had the option to continue.

1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:51.000
 So with a person like Putin, once again, I don't know him personally, so I have no basis

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.680
 to judge this.

1:27:52.680 --> 1:28:00.240
 This is a general statement observable with many people and in historical terms.

1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:05.800
 With a person like Putin who's exercised this much power for this long, it's something that

1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:11.980
 becomes a part of who you are and you have a hard time imagining yourself without it.

1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:17.160
 You begin to conflate your personal power with the well being of the nation.

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:22.920
 You begin to think that the more power you have, the better off the country is this conflation.

1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:30.040
 You begin to be able to not imagine, you can no longer imagine what it would be like just

1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:38.000
 to be an ordinary citizen or an ordinary person running a company even, something much smaller

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.960
 than a country.

1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:47.840
 So I anticipate that without knowing for sure that he would be in that category of person,

1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:56.360
 but you'd want to explore that with questions with him about, so what's his day look like

1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:57.360
 from beginning to end?

1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:59.640
 Just take me through a typical day of yours.

1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:00.720
 What do you do on a day?

1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:02.280
 How does it start?

1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:03.280
 What are the ups?

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.280
 What are the downs?

1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.400
 What are the parts of the day you look forward to the most?

1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:11.140
 What are the parts of the day you don't look forward to that much?

1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:13.520
 What do you consider a good day?

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:16.460
 What do you consider a bad day?

1:29:16.460 --> 1:29:22.240
 How do you know that what you're doing is having the effects that you intend?

1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:23.760
 How do you follow up?

1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:26.680
 How do you gather the information, the reaction?

1:29:26.680 --> 1:29:31.920
 How do you get people to tell you to your face things that they know are uncomfortable

1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:34.400
 or that you might not want to hear?

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:35.400
 Those kind of questions.

1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:40.120
 And through that window, through that kind of questioning, you get a window into a man

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:42.000
 with power.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:48.000
 So let me ask about Stalin because you've done more research, there's another amazing

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:56.960
 interview you've had, the introduction was that you know more about Stalin than Stalin

1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:57.960
 himself.

1:29:57.960 --> 1:30:00.200
 You've done an incredible amount of research on Stalin.

1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:07.640
 So if you could talk to him, get sort of direct research, what question would you ask of Stalin?

1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:12.240
 I have so many questions, I don't even know where I would begin.

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:18.400
 The thing about studying a person like Stalin, who's an immense creature, right?

1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:23.660
 He's exercising the power of life and death over hundreds of millions of people.

1:30:23.660 --> 1:30:31.720
 He's making decisions about novels and films and turbines and submarines and packs with

1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:39.600
 Hitler or deals with Churchill and Roosevelt and occupation of Mongolia or occupation of

1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:41.320
 North Korea.

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:49.880
 He's making phenomenally consequential decisions over all spheres of life, all areas of endeavor

1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:56.420
 and over much of the globe, much of the landmass of the earth.

1:30:56.420 --> 1:30:59.760
 And so what's that like?

1:30:59.760 --> 1:31:06.320
 Does he sometimes reflect on the amount of power and responsibility he has that he can

1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:07.800
 exercise?

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:14.200
 Does he sometimes think about what it means that a single person has that kind of power?

1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:20.120
 And does it have an effect on his relations with others, his sense of self, the kinds

1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:22.660
 of things he values in life?

1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:27.420
 Does he sometimes think it's a mistake that he's accumulated this much power?

1:31:27.420 --> 1:31:30.960
 Does he sometimes wish he had a simpler life?

1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:41.240
 Or is he once again so drunk, so enamored, so caught up with chemically and spiritually

1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:45.500
 with exercising this kind of power that he couldn't live without it?

1:31:45.500 --> 1:31:51.200
 And then what were you thinking, I would ask him, in certain decisions that he made?

1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:56.620
 What were you thinking on certain dates and certain circumstances where you made a decision

1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:59.180
 and could have made a different decision?

1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:02.500
 Can you recall your thought processes?

1:32:02.500 --> 1:32:04.320
 Can you bring the decision back?

1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:06.180
 Was it seat of the pants?

1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:08.400
 Was it something you'd been planning?

1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:12.760
 Did you just improvise or did you have a strategy?

1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:15.000
 What were you guided by?

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.240
 Whose examples did you look to?

1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:20.960
 When you picked up these books that you read and you read the books and you made pencil

1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:25.000
 marks in them, is it because you absorbed the lesson there?

1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:29.640
 Or did it really not become a permanent lesson and it was just something that you checked

1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:32.400
 and it was like a reflex?

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:39.400
 So I have many specific questions about many specific events and people and circumstances

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:47.800
 that I have tried to figure out with the surviving source materials that we have in abundance.

1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:53.840
 But I would still like to delve into his mindset and reconstruct his mind.

1:32:53.840 --> 1:33:00.980
 The closer you get to Stalin, in some ways, the more elusive he can become.

1:33:00.980 --> 1:33:06.080
 And especially around World War II, you've already illuminated a lot of interesting aspects

1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:11.160
 about Stalin's role in the war, but it would be interesting to ask even more questions

1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:15.580
 about how seat of the pants or deliberate some of the decisions have been.

1:33:15.580 --> 1:33:23.080
 If I could ask just one quick question, one last quick question, and you're constrained

1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:28.680
 in time and answering it, do you think there will always be evil in the world?

1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:31.200
 Do you think there will always be war?

1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:33.800
 Unfortunately, yes.

1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:40.560
 There are conflicting interests, conflicting goals that people have.

1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:44.960
 Most of the time, those conflicts can be resolved peacefully.

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.520
 That's why we build strong institutions to resolve different interests and conflicts

1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:52.120
 peacefully.

1:33:52.120 --> 1:34:02.200
 But the fact, the enduring fact of conflicting interests and conflicting desires, that can

1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:04.640
 never be changed.

1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:14.040
 So the job that we have for humanity's sake is to make those conflicting interests, those

1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:20.440
 conflicting desires, to make them, to put them in a context where they can be resolved

1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:25.600
 peacefully, and not in a zero sum fashion.

1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:30.480
 So we can't get there on the global scale.

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:37.080
 So there's always going to be the kind of conflict that sometimes gets violent.

1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:43.280
 What we don't want is a conflict among the strongest powers.

1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:48.240
 Great power conflict is unbelievably bad.

1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:50.320
 There are no words to describe it.

1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:55.920
 At least 55 million people died in World War II.

1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:01.080
 If we have a World War III, a war between the United States and China, or whatever it

1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:05.160
 might be, who knows what the number could be?

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:14.000
 155 million, 255 million, 555 million, I don't even want to think about it.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.120
 And so it's horrible when wars break out in the humanitarian catastrophes.

1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:26.280
 For example, Yemen and Syria and several other places I could name today.

1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:28.640
 It's just horrible what you see there.

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.060
 And the scale is colossal for those places.

1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:34.660
 But it's not planetary scale.

1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:41.000
 And so avoiding planetary scale destruction is really important for us.

1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:49.120
 And so having those different interests be somehow managed in a way that they don't,

1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:54.400
 that no one sees advantage in a violent resolution.

1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:58.200
 And a part of that is remembering history, so they should read your books.

1:35:58.200 --> 1:35:59.440
 Stephen, thank you so much.

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.240
 It was a huge honor talking to you today.

1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:02.520
 I really enjoyed it.

1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:03.800

 And now let me leave you with words from Joseph Stalin, spoken shortly before the death of

1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:41.720
 Lenin and at the beginning of Stalin's rise to power.

1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:42.840
 FIRST IN RUSSIAN

1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:50.400
 Я считаю, что совершенно неважно, кто и как будет в партии голосовать.

1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:56.960
 Но вот что чрезвычайно важно, это кто и как будет считать голоса.

1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:04.360
 I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how, but what is extraordinarily

1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:09.560
 important is who will count the votes and how.

1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:36.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
