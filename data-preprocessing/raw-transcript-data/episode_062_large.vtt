00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
 The following is a conversation with Donald Knuth,

00:03.440 --> 00:06.640
 one of the greatest and most impactful computer scientists

00:06.640 --> 00:09.280
 and mathematicians ever.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.520
 He's the recipient of the 1974 Turing Award,

00:13.520 --> 00:16.020
 considered the Nobel Prize of Computing.

00:16.020 --> 00:18.700
 He's the author of the multi volume work,

00:18.700 --> 00:23.200
 the Magnum Opus, The Art of Computer Programming.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.360
 He made several key contributions

00:25.360 --> 00:28.280
 to the rigorous analysis of computational complexity

00:28.280 --> 00:31.640
 of algorithms, including the popularization

00:31.640 --> 00:34.760
 of asymptotic notation, that we all affectionately

00:34.760 --> 00:37.560
 know as the big O notation.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.840
 He also created the tech typesetting system,

00:40.840 --> 00:44.480
 which most computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians,

00:44.480 --> 00:47.040
 and scientists and engineers in general

00:47.040 --> 00:51.760
 use to write technical papers and make them look beautiful.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.800
 I can imagine no better guest to end 2019 with than Don,

00:56.800 --> 01:00.560
 one of the kindest, most brilliant people in our field.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.120
 This podcast was recorded many months ago.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.480
 It's one I avoided because perhaps counterintuitively,

01:06.480 --> 01:08.960
 the conversation meant so much to me.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.960
 If you can believe it, I knew even less

01:10.960 --> 01:14.320
 about recording back then, so the camera angle is a bit off.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.280
 I hope that's OK with you.

01:16.280 --> 01:19.440
 The office space was a big cramp for filming,

01:19.440 --> 01:24.120
 but it was a magical space where Don does most of his work.

01:24.120 --> 01:27.400
 It meant a lot to me that he would welcome me into his home.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.960
 It was quite a journey to get there.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.720
 As many people know, he doesn't check email,

01:31.720 --> 01:33.520
 so I had to get creative.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.720
 The effort was worth it.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.480
 I've been doing this podcast on the side

01:37.480 --> 01:38.720
 for just over a year.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.280
 Sometimes I had to sacrifice a bit of sleep,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.160
 but always happy to do it and to be

01:43.160 --> 01:46.640
 part of an amazing community of curious minds.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.960
 Thank you for your kind words of support

01:48.960 --> 01:50.600
 and for the interesting discussions,

01:50.600 --> 01:54.400
 and I look forward to many more of those in 2020.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.440
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.800
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:59.800 --> 02:03.160
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,

02:03.160 --> 02:06.520
 support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter

02:06.520 --> 02:10.640
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.600
 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.320
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
 and never any ads in the middle that break

02:18.320 --> 02:19.960
 the flow of the conversation.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.360
 I hope that works for you

02:21.360 --> 02:23.720
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.000
 I provide timestamps for the start of the conversation

02:26.000 --> 02:28.080
 that you can skip to, but it helps

02:28.080 --> 02:31.000
 if you listen to the ad and support this podcast

02:31.000 --> 02:34.240
 by trying out the product or service being advertised.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.560
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:36.560 --> 02:39.120
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.840
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:41.840 --> 02:44.200
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

02:44.200 --> 02:46.600
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.760
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.720
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,

02:52.720 --> 02:54.960
 no matter what the stock price is.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.800
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:57.800 --> 03:01.520
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.480
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

03:03.480 --> 03:06.880
 to support one of my favorite organizations called First,

03:06.880 --> 03:10.480
 best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.

03:10.480 --> 03:14.200
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

03:14.200 --> 03:17.120
 in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating

03:17.120 --> 03:19.840
 on Charity Navigator, which means that donated money

03:19.840 --> 03:23.240
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.480
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

03:26.480 --> 03:30.120
 and use code LexPodcast, you'll get $10

03:30.120 --> 03:32.920
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

03:32.920 --> 03:34.800
 which again is an organization

03:34.800 --> 03:37.640
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

03:37.640 --> 03:40.600
 to dream of engineering a better world.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.320
 And now here's my conversation with Donald Knuth.

03:44.320 --> 03:49.320
 In 1957 at Case Tech, you were once allowed

03:50.520 --> 03:55.520
 to spend several evenings with a IBM 650 computer

03:55.640 --> 03:57.080
 as you've talked about in the past

03:57.080 --> 03:59.120
 and you fell in love with computing then.

04:00.480 --> 04:05.120
 Can you take me back to that moment with the IBM 650?

04:06.040 --> 04:09.160
 What was it that grabbed you about that computer?

04:09.160 --> 04:14.080
 So the IBM 650 was this machine

04:14.080 --> 04:16.800
 that, well, it didn't fill a room,

04:16.800 --> 04:20.400
 but it was big and noisy.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.120
 But when I first saw it, it was through a window

04:23.120 --> 04:26.160
 and there were just a lot of lights flashing on it.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.160
 And I was a freshman, I had a job with the statistics group

04:34.600 --> 04:38.800
 and I was supposed to punch cards for data

04:38.800 --> 04:40.440
 and then sort them on another machine,

04:40.440 --> 04:43.920
 but then they got this new computer, came in

04:43.920 --> 04:48.360
 and it had interesting lights, okay.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.520
 So, well, but I had a key to the building

04:51.520 --> 04:55.840
 so I could get in and look at it and got a manual for it.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.600
 And my first experience was based on the fact

04:58.600 --> 05:00.400
 that I could punch cards, basically,

05:00.400 --> 05:02.440
 which is a big thing for the,

05:02.440 --> 05:06.480
 but the IBM 650 was big in size,

05:06.480 --> 05:10.880
 but incredibly small in power.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.840
 In resources.

05:11.840 --> 05:16.840
 In memory, it had 2,000 words of memory

05:16.920 --> 05:20.440
 and a word of memory was 10 decimal digits plus a sign.

05:20.440 --> 05:24.000
 And it would do, to add two numbers together,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.600
 you could probably expect that would take,

05:28.120 --> 05:30.200
 I'll say three milliseconds.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.040
 So.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.600
 It took pretty fast, the memory is the constraint,

05:33.600 --> 05:34.720
 the memory is the problem.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.960
 That was why it took three milliseconds,

05:36.960 --> 05:40.240
 because it took five milliseconds for the drum to go around

05:40.240 --> 05:45.120
 and you had to wait, I don't know, five cycle times.

05:45.120 --> 05:49.040
 If you have an instruction, one position on the drum,

05:49.040 --> 05:51.640
 then it would be ready to read the data for the instruction

05:51.640 --> 05:55.720
 and go three notches.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.800
 The drum is 50 cycles around and you go three cycles

05:59.800 --> 06:01.240
 and you can get the data and then you can go

06:01.240 --> 06:04.520
 another three cycles and get to your next instruction

06:04.520 --> 06:07.160
 if the instruction is there, otherwise you spin

06:07.160 --> 06:09.360
 until you get to the right place.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.040
 And we had no random access memory whatsoever

06:13.040 --> 06:14.480
 until my senior year.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.400
 Senior year, we got 50 words of random access memory

06:17.400 --> 06:20.600
 which were priceless and we would move stuff

06:20.600 --> 06:25.600
 up to the random access memory in 60 word chunks

06:26.760 --> 06:28.080
 and then we would start again.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.120
 So subroutine wanted to go up there.

06:31.120 --> 06:35.640
 Could you have predicted the future 60 years later

06:35.640 --> 06:37.440
 of computing from then?

06:37.440 --> 06:39.840
 You know, in fact, the hardest question I was ever asked

06:39.840 --> 06:44.600
 was what could I have predicted?

06:44.600 --> 06:47.240
 In other words, the interviewer asked me,

06:47.240 --> 06:51.480
 she said, you know, what about computing has surprised you?

06:51.480 --> 06:54.680
 And immediately I ran, I rattled off a couple dozen things

06:54.680 --> 06:57.360
 and then she said, okay, so what didn't surprise?

06:57.360 --> 07:01.160
 And I tried for five minutes to think of something

07:01.160 --> 07:04.200
 that I would have predicted and I couldn't.

07:04.200 --> 07:09.200
 But let me say that this machine, I didn't know,

07:09.320 --> 07:13.520
 well, there wasn't much else in the world at that time.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.360
 The 650 was the first machine that there were more

07:17.360 --> 07:19.400
 than a thousand of ever.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.760
 Before that there were, you know, each machine

07:22.760 --> 07:25.040
 there might be a half a dozen examples,

07:25.040 --> 07:25.880
 maybe a couple dozen.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.240
 The first mass market, mass produced.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.640
 The first one, yeah, done in quantity.

07:30.640 --> 07:35.640
 And IBM didn't sell them, they rented them,

07:36.800 --> 07:41.800
 but they rented them to universities that had a great deal.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.360
 And so that's why a lot of students learned

07:48.360 --> 07:50.720
 about computers at that time.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.760
 So you refer to people, including yourself,

07:55.760 --> 07:59.160
 who gravitate toward a kind of computational thinking

07:59.160 --> 08:03.520
 as geeks, at least I've heard you use that terminology.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.240
 It's true that I think there's something

08:06.240 --> 08:08.160
 that happened to me as I was growing up

08:08.160 --> 08:11.680
 that made my brain structure in a certain way

08:11.680 --> 08:14.120
 that resonates with computers.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.560
 So there's this space of people, 2% of the population,

08:17.560 --> 08:19.800
 you empirically estimate.

08:19.800 --> 08:24.800
 That's been fairly constant over most of my career.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.160
 However, it might be different now

08:28.160 --> 08:30.760
 because kids have different experiences when they're young.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.600
 Obviously.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.480
 So what does the world look like to a geek?

08:35.480 --> 08:40.480
 What is this aspect of thinking that is unique to,

08:43.480 --> 08:44.400
 that makes a geek?

08:45.320 --> 08:48.920
 This is a hugely important question.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.920
 In the 50s, IBM noticed that there were geeks

08:53.920 --> 08:56.920
 and nongeeks, and so they tried to hire geeks.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.880
 And they put out ads with papers saying,

08:58.880 --> 09:01.400
 if you play chess, come to Madison Avenue

09:01.400 --> 09:03.120
 for an interview or something like this.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.920
 They were trying for some things.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.800
 So what is it that I find easy

09:08.800 --> 09:11.560
 and other people tend to find harder?

09:11.560 --> 09:14.480
 And I think there's two main things.

09:14.480 --> 09:19.480
 One is this, is the ability to jump levels

09:19.480 --> 09:24.480
 of abstraction.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.720
 So you see something in the large

09:29.720 --> 09:31.440
 and you see something in the small

09:31.440 --> 09:35.840
 and you pass between those unconsciously.

09:35.840 --> 09:40.440
 So you know that in order to solve some big problem,

09:40.440 --> 09:44.840
 what you need to do is add one to a certain register

09:44.840 --> 09:47.360
 and that gets you to another step.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.360
 And below the, I don't go down to the electron level,

09:51.360 --> 09:54.200
 but I knew what those milliseconds were,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.080
 what the drum was like on the 650.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.680
 I knew how I was gonna factor a number

09:59.680 --> 10:03.080
 or find a root of an equation or something

10:03.080 --> 10:04.640
 because of what was doing.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.080
 And as I'm debugging, I'm going through,

10:08.520 --> 10:09.880
 did I make a key punch error?

10:09.880 --> 10:13.120
 Did I write the wrong instruction?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.840
 Do I have the wrong thing in a register?

10:15.840 --> 10:20.480
 And each level is different.

10:20.480 --> 10:25.240
 And this idea of being able to see something

10:25.240 --> 10:30.000
 at lots of levels and fluently go between them

10:30.000 --> 10:32.920
 seems to me to be much more pronounced

10:32.920 --> 10:37.400
 in the people that resonate with computers like I do.

10:37.400 --> 10:42.400
 So in my books, I also don't stick just to the high level,

10:42.400 --> 10:47.400
 but I mix low level stuff with high level

10:48.440 --> 10:51.280
 and this means that some people think

10:54.280 --> 10:58.680
 that I should write better books and it's probably true.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.480
 But other people say, well, but that's,

11:01.480 --> 11:04.400
 if you think like that, then that's the way

11:04.400 --> 11:06.880
 to train yourself, keep mixing the levels

11:06.880 --> 11:10.360
 and learn more and more how to jump between.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.440
 So that's the one thing.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.160
 The other thing is that it's more of a talent

11:17.040 --> 11:20.960
 to be able to deal with non uniformity

11:20.960 --> 11:24.240
 where there's case one, case two, case three,

11:25.400 --> 11:29.200
 instead of having one or two rules that govern everything.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.720
 So it doesn't bother me if I need,

11:35.720 --> 11:38.520
 like an algorithm has 10 steps to it,

11:38.520 --> 11:41.120
 each step does something else that doesn't bother me,

11:41.120 --> 11:45.440
 but a lot of pure mathematics is based on one or two rules

11:45.440 --> 11:49.760
 which are universal and so this means

11:49.760 --> 11:53.200
 that people like me sometimes work with systems

11:53.200 --> 11:54.840
 that are more complicated than necessary

11:54.840 --> 11:58.800
 because it doesn't bother us that we didn't figure out

11:58.800 --> 11:59.740
 the simple rule.

12:00.880 --> 12:05.680
 And you mentioned that while Jacobi, Boole, Abel,

12:05.680 --> 12:07.680
 all the mathematicians in the 19th century

12:07.680 --> 12:11.640
 may have had symptoms of geek,

12:11.640 --> 12:16.000
 the first 100% legit geek was Turing, Alan Turing.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
 I think he had, yeah, a lot more of this quality

12:21.480 --> 12:26.480
 than anybody, just from reading the kind of stuff he did.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.920
 So how does Turing, what influence has Turing had on you

12:33.360 --> 12:35.120
 in your way of thinking?

12:35.120 --> 12:38.120
 I didn't know that aspect of him

12:38.120 --> 12:40.640
 until after I graduated some years.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.760
 As undergraduate we had a class that talked about

12:44.760 --> 12:46.760
 computability theory and Turing machines

12:46.760 --> 12:51.760
 and it was all, it sounded like a very specific kind

12:52.280 --> 12:56.420
 of purely theoretical approach to stuff.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.320
 So when, how old were they when I learned

12:59.320 --> 13:04.320
 that he had a design machine and that he wrote a wonderful

13:08.680 --> 13:13.680
 manual for Manchester machines and he invented

13:14.680 --> 13:19.680
 all kinds of subroutines and he was a real hacker

13:21.360 --> 13:24.240
 that he had his hands dirty.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.480
 I thought for many years that he had only done

13:28.480 --> 13:31.640
 purely formal work, as I started reading

13:31.640 --> 13:35.600
 his own publications, I could feel this kinship

13:36.980 --> 13:41.000
 and of course he had a lot of peculiarities,

13:41.880 --> 13:45.960
 like he wrote numbers backwards because I mean,

13:45.960 --> 13:47.520
 left to right instead of right to left

13:47.520 --> 13:50.360
 because that's, it was easier for computers

13:50.360 --> 13:51.860
 to process them that way.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.360
 What do you mean left to right?

13:54.360 --> 13:59.360
 He would write pi as 9, 5, 1, 4.3, I mean, okay.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.120
 Right, got it.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.420
 4, 1.3, on the blackboard.

14:10.420 --> 14:15.420
 I mean, he had trained himself to do that

14:16.680 --> 14:19.680
 because the computers he was working with

14:19.680 --> 14:21.000
 worked that way inside.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.840
 Trained himself to think like a computer.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.900
 There you go, that's geek thinking.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.880
 You've practiced some of the most elegant

14:28.880 --> 14:33.080
 formalism in computer science and yet you're

14:33.080 --> 14:35.960
 the creator of a concept like literate programming

14:36.800 --> 14:40.280
 which seems to move closer to natural language

14:40.280 --> 14:43.520
 type of description of programming.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.960
 Yeah, absolutely.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.080
 How do you see those two as conflicting

14:47.080 --> 14:50.160
 as the formalism of theory and the idea

14:50.160 --> 14:51.480
 of literate programming?

14:51.480 --> 14:54.240
 So there we are in a nonuniform system

14:54.240 --> 14:57.600
 where I don't think one size fits all

14:57.600 --> 15:02.600
 and I don't think all truth lies in one kind of expertise.

15:03.320 --> 15:07.560
 And so somehow, in a way you'd say my life

15:07.560 --> 15:12.560
 is a convex combination of English and mathematics.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.520
 And you're okay with that.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.360
 And not only that, I think.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.200
 Thrive in it.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.920
 I wish, you know, I want my kids to be that way,

15:18.920 --> 15:21.680
 I want, et cetera, you know, use left brain,

15:21.680 --> 15:23.920
 right brain at the same time.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.400
 You got a lot more done.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.760
 That was part of the bargain.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.600
 And I've heard that you didn't really read

15:32.600 --> 15:37.120
 for pleasure until into your 30s, you know, literature.

15:37.120 --> 15:37.960
 That's true.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.240
 You know more about me than I do

15:39.240 --> 15:41.640
 but I'll try to be consistent with what you read.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.960
 Yeah, no, just believe me.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.800
 I just go with whatever story I tell you.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.840
 It'll be easier that way.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.680
 The conversation works.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.000
 Right, yeah, no, that's true.

15:49.960 --> 15:53.200
 So I've heard mention of Philip Roth's American Pastoral,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.960
 which I love as a book.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.320
 I don't know if, it was mentioned as something,

15:59.320 --> 16:01.520
 I think, that was meaningful to you as well.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.840
 In either case, what literary books

16:05.840 --> 16:07.320
 had a lasting impact on you?

16:07.320 --> 16:08.160
 What literature, what poetry?

16:08.160 --> 16:09.800
 Yeah, okay, good question.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.600
 So I met Roth.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.640
 Oh, really?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.680
 Well, we both got doctors from Harvard on the same day,

16:16.680 --> 16:21.480
 so we had lunch together and stuff like that.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.080
 But he knew that, you know, computer books would never sell.

16:25.080 --> 16:30.080
 Well, all right, so you say you were a teenager

16:32.480 --> 16:36.040
 when you left Russia, so I have to say

16:36.040 --> 16:38.800
 that Tolstoy was one of the big influences on me,

16:39.680 --> 16:42.640
 especially like Anna Karnina,

16:42.640 --> 16:47.640
 not because of particularly of the plot of the story,

16:48.280 --> 16:53.280
 but because there's this character who,

16:53.440 --> 16:56.400
 you know, the philosophical discussions,

17:00.400 --> 17:02.480
 the whole way of life is worked out there

17:02.480 --> 17:03.520
 among the characters,

17:03.520 --> 17:08.520
 and so that I thought was especially beautiful.

17:08.520 --> 17:12.720
 On the other hand, Dostoevsky, I didn't like at all

17:12.720 --> 17:16.000
 because I felt that his genius was mostly

17:16.000 --> 17:18.800
 because he kept forgetting what he had started out to do,

17:18.800 --> 17:20.080
 and he was just sloppy.

17:21.080 --> 17:26.080
 I didn't think that he polished his stuff at all,

17:26.120 --> 17:29.040
 and I tend to admire somebody

17:29.040 --> 17:32.440
 who dots the I's and crosses the T's.

17:32.440 --> 17:36.600
 So the music of the pros is what you admire more than...

17:36.600 --> 17:39.440
 I certainly do admire the music of the language,

17:39.440 --> 17:42.360
 which I couldn't appreciate in the Russian original,

17:42.360 --> 17:46.840
 but I can in Victor Hugo, because French is closer.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.440
 But Tolstoy, I like the same reason.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.040
 I like Herman Wouk as a novelist.

17:54.040 --> 17:59.040
 I think like his book, Marjorie Morningstar,

17:59.200 --> 18:02.000
 has a similar character in Hugo

18:02.000 --> 18:04.200
 who developed his own personal philosophy,

18:04.200 --> 18:07.720
 and it goes in the...

18:08.680 --> 18:10.200
 What's consistent?

18:10.200 --> 18:13.840
 Yeah, right, and it's worth pondering.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.720
 So, yeah.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.080
 So you don't like Nietzsche, and...

18:18.080 --> 18:18.920
 Like what?

18:18.920 --> 18:20.640
 You don't like Friedrich Nietzsche, or...

18:20.640 --> 18:23.640
 Nietzsche, yeah, no, no, yeah, this has...

18:23.640 --> 18:26.480
 I keep seeing quotations from Nietzsche,

18:26.480 --> 18:30.280
 and he never tempt me to read any further.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.880
 Well, he's full of contradictions,

18:31.880 --> 18:34.400
 and you will certainly not appreciate him.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.120
 But Schiller, I'm trying to get across

18:38.120 --> 18:40.520
 what I appreciate in literature,

18:40.520 --> 18:44.160
 and part of it is, as you say,

18:44.160 --> 18:47.680
 the music of the language, the way it flows,

18:48.560 --> 18:52.480
 and take Raymond Chandler versus Dashiell Hammett.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.640
 Dashiell Hammett's sentences are awful,

18:55.640 --> 18:59.880
 and Raymond Chandler's are beautiful, they just flow.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.120
 So I don't read literature

19:04.120 --> 19:07.320
 because it's supposed to be good for me,

19:07.320 --> 19:09.640
 or because somebody said it's great,

19:09.640 --> 19:14.080
 but I find things that I like.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.240
 I mean, you mentioned you were dressed like James Bond,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.400
 so I love Ian Fleming.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.880
 I think he had a really great gift for...

19:23.880 --> 19:26.600
 If he has a golf game, or a game of bridge,

19:26.600 --> 19:29.120
 or something and this comes into his story,

19:29.120 --> 19:32.360
 it'll be the most exciting golf game,

19:32.360 --> 19:37.360
 or the absolute best possible hands of bridge that exists,

19:38.600 --> 19:43.600
 and he exploits it and tells it beautifully.

19:45.680 --> 19:49.440
 So in connecting some things here,

19:49.440 --> 19:51.280
 looking at literate programming

19:51.280 --> 19:56.280
 and being able to convey in code algorithms

19:56.280 --> 20:01.280
 to a computer in a way that mimics how humans speak,

20:05.920 --> 20:08.680
 what do you think about natural language in general

20:08.680 --> 20:11.520
 and the messiness of our human world,

20:11.520 --> 20:15.600
 about trying to express difficult things?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.680
 So the idea of literate programming

20:17.680 --> 20:22.680
 is really to try to understand something better

20:22.680 --> 20:25.680
 by seeing it from at least two perspectives,

20:25.680 --> 20:27.560
 the formal and the informal.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.320
 If we're trying to understand a complicated thing,

20:30.320 --> 20:32.040
 if we can look at it in different ways.

20:32.040 --> 20:36.240
 And so this is in fact the key to technical writing,

20:36.240 --> 20:40.000
 a good technical writer trying not to be obvious about it,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.960
 but says everything twice, formally and informally,

20:43.960 --> 20:48.960
 or maybe three times, but you try to give the reader

20:48.960 --> 20:53.960
 a way to put the concept into his own brain

20:56.400 --> 20:57.720
 or her own brain.

20:57.720 --> 21:01.680
 Is that better for the writer or the reader or both?

21:01.680 --> 21:06.680
 Well, the writer just tries to understand the reader.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.080
 That's the goal of a writer,

21:08.080 --> 21:11.240
 is to have a good mental image of the reader

21:12.080 --> 21:15.000
 and to say what the reader expects next

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
 and to impress the reader with what has impressed the writer

21:22.920 --> 21:24.720
 why something is interesting.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.120
 So when you have a computer program,

21:26.120 --> 21:29.400
 we try to, instead of looking at it as something

21:29.400 --> 21:31.840
 that we're just trying to give instruction to the computer,

21:31.840 --> 21:35.680
 what we really wanna be is giving insight

21:35.680 --> 21:40.680
 to the person who's gonna be maintaining this program

21:40.840 --> 21:44.720
 or to the programmer himself when he's debugging it

21:44.720 --> 21:47.120
 as to why this stuff is being done.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.000
 And so all the techniques of exposition

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
 that a teacher uses or a book writer uses

21:54.000 --> 21:55.360
 make you a better programmer

21:55.360 --> 22:00.360
 if your program is gonna be not just a one shot deal.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.600
 So how difficult is that?

22:04.600 --> 22:09.600
 Do you see hope for the combination of informal and formal

22:10.280 --> 22:12.800
 for the programming task?

22:12.800 --> 22:15.920
 Yeah, I'm the wrong person to ask, I guess,

22:15.920 --> 22:19.080
 because I'm a geek, but I think for a geek it's easy.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.840
 Some people have difficulty writing

22:24.840 --> 22:29.320
 and that might be because there's something

22:29.320 --> 22:31.760
 in their brain structure that makes it hard

22:31.760 --> 22:34.400
 for them to write or it might be something

22:34.400 --> 22:36.560
 just that they haven't had enough practice.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.800
 I'm not the right one to judge,

22:39.800 --> 22:42.080
 but I don't think you can teach any person

22:42.080 --> 22:44.480
 any particular skill.

22:44.480 --> 22:49.400
 I do think that writing is half of my life

22:49.400 --> 22:53.040
 and so I put it together in a literate program.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.840
 Even when I'm writing a one shot program,

22:55.840 --> 23:00.000
 I write it in a literate way

23:00.000 --> 23:04.640
 because I get it right faster that way.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.120
 Now does it get compiled automatically?

23:07.120 --> 23:08.600
 Or?

23:08.600 --> 23:12.080
 So I guess on the technical side, my question was

23:12.080 --> 23:14.800
 how difficult is it to design a system

23:14.800 --> 23:18.320
 where much of the programming is done informally?

23:19.480 --> 23:20.560
 Informally?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.120
 Yeah, informally.

23:22.120 --> 23:27.120
 I think whatever works to make it understandable is good,

23:28.280 --> 23:33.280
 but then you have to also understand how informal is.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.000
 You have to know the limitations.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.640
 So by putting the formal and informal together,

23:39.640 --> 23:44.640
 this is where it gets locked into your brain.

23:45.400 --> 23:50.320
 You can say informally, well,

23:50.320 --> 23:52.920
 I'm working on a problem right now, so.

23:52.920 --> 23:53.760
 Let's go there.

23:54.680 --> 23:58.160
 Can you give me an example of connecting

23:58.160 --> 24:00.040
 the informal and the formal?

24:00.040 --> 24:03.440
 Well, it's a little too complicated an example.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.920
 There's a puzzle that's self referential.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.240
 It's called a Japanese arrow puzzle.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.640
 And you're given a bunch of boxes.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.720
 Each one points north, east, south, or west.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.680
 And at the end, you're supposed to fill in each box

24:19.680 --> 24:24.680
 with the number of distinct numbers that it points to.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.120
 So if I put a three in a box, that means that,

24:28.120 --> 24:30.040
 and it's pointing to five other boxes,

24:30.040 --> 24:32.200
 that means that there's gonna be three different numbers

24:32.200 --> 24:34.480
 in those five boxes.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.920
 And those boxes are pointing,

24:36.920 --> 24:38.240
 one of them might be pointing to me,

24:38.240 --> 24:40.680
 one of them might be pointing the other way.

24:40.680 --> 24:45.480
 But anyway, I'm supposed to find a set of numbers

24:45.480 --> 24:48.800
 that obeys this complicated condition

24:48.800 --> 24:52.280
 that each number counts how many distinct numbers

24:52.280 --> 24:53.120
 it points to.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.840
 And so a guy sent me his solution to this problem

24:58.840 --> 25:03.840
 where he presents formal statements

25:04.920 --> 25:07.520
 that say either this is true or this is true

25:07.520 --> 25:08.360
 or this is true.

25:08.360 --> 25:13.360
 And so I try to render that formal statement informally

25:13.600 --> 25:17.400
 and I try to say, I contain a three

25:17.400 --> 25:22.400
 and the guys I'm pointing to contain the numbers one,

25:23.600 --> 25:25.320
 two, and six.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.880
 So by putting it informally and also I convert it

25:27.880 --> 25:30.680
 into a dialogue statement,

25:32.160 --> 25:35.600
 that helps me understand the logical statement

25:35.600 --> 25:37.680
 that he's written down as a string of numbers

25:37.680 --> 25:41.120
 in terms of some abstract variables that he had.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
 That's really interesting.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.360
 So maybe an extension of that,

25:45.360 --> 25:48.200
 there has been a resurgence in computer science

25:48.200 --> 25:52.520
 and machine learning and neural networks.

25:52.520 --> 25:56.640
 So using data to construct algorithms.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.240
 So it's another way to construct algorithms, really.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.080
 Yes, exactly.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.640
 If you can think of it that way.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.280
 So as opposed to natural language to construct algorithms,

26:06.280 --> 26:08.280
 use data to construct algorithms.

26:08.280 --> 26:13.280
 So what's your view of this branch of computer science

26:13.520 --> 26:15.920
 where data is almost more important

26:15.920 --> 26:18.760
 than the mechanism of the algorithm?

26:18.760 --> 26:22.840
 It seems to be suited to a certain kind of non geek,

26:22.840 --> 26:27.840
 which is probably why it's taken off.

26:29.600 --> 26:34.560
 It has its own community that really resonates with that.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.680
 But it's hard to trust something like that

26:38.680 --> 26:43.400
 because nobody, even the people who work with it,

26:43.400 --> 26:47.160
 they have no idea what has been learned.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.520
 That's a really interesting thought

26:49.520 --> 26:54.520
 that it makes algorithms more accessible

26:54.520 --> 26:58.600
 to a different community, a different type of brain.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.520
 Yep.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.040
 And that's really interesting

27:01.040 --> 27:05.680
 because just like literate programming perhaps

27:05.680 --> 27:08.800
 could make programming more accessible

27:08.800 --> 27:10.560
 to a certain kind of brain.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.640
 There are people who think it's just a matter of education

27:13.640 --> 27:16.320
 and anybody can learn to be a great programmer.

27:16.320 --> 27:20.680
 Anybody can learn to be a great skier.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
 I wish that were true,

27:24.600 --> 27:27.080
 but I know that there's a lot of things

27:27.080 --> 27:31.360
 that I've tried to do and I was well motivated

27:31.360 --> 27:33.920
 and I kept trying to build myself up

27:33.920 --> 27:36.320
 and I never got past a certain level.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.120
 I can't view, for example,

27:38.120 --> 27:43.120
 I can't view three dimensional objects in my head.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.600
 I have to make a model and look at it

27:46.600 --> 27:48.520
 and study it from all points of view

27:48.520 --> 27:50.640
 and then I start to get some idea.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.160
 But other people are good at four dimensions.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.800
 Physicists.

27:55.800 --> 27:56.640
 Yeah.

27:57.880 --> 28:02.880
 So let's go to the art of computer programming.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.240
 In 1962, you set the table of contents

28:09.160 --> 28:12.960
 for this magnum opus, right?

28:12.960 --> 28:13.800
 Yep.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.680
 It was supposed to be a single book with 12 chapters.

28:16.680 --> 28:21.680
 Now today, what is it, 57 years later,

28:22.360 --> 28:25.240
 you're in the middle of volume four of seven?

28:26.720 --> 28:28.520
 In the middle of volume four B is.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.360
 Four B.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.200
 More precisely.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.960
 Can I ask you for an impossible task,

28:32.960 --> 28:37.480
 which is try to summarize the book so far

28:38.400 --> 28:41.600
 maybe by giving a little examples.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.640
 So from the sorting and the search

28:43.640 --> 28:46.320
 and the combinatorial algorithms,

28:46.320 --> 28:50.600
 if you were to give a summary, a quick elevator summary.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.920
 Elevator, that's great.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.760
 Yeah, right.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.640
 But depending how many floors there are in the building.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.080
 Yeah.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.440
 The first volume called Fundamental Algorithms

28:58.440 --> 29:02.360
 talks about something that you can't,

29:02.360 --> 29:03.960
 the stuff you can't do without.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.920
 You have to know the basic concepts of what is a program,

29:09.920 --> 29:11.600
 what is an algorithm.

29:11.600 --> 29:15.960
 And it also talks about a low level machine

29:15.960 --> 29:20.000
 so you can have some kind of an idea what's going on.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.280
 And it has basic concepts of input and output

29:24.280 --> 29:26.600
 and subroutines.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.880
 Induction.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.600
 Induction, right.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.600
 Mathematical, preliminary.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.200
 So the thing that makes my book different

29:34.200 --> 29:39.200
 from a lot of others is that I try to,

29:39.200 --> 29:40.800
 not only present the algorithm,

29:40.800 --> 29:42.200
 but I try to analyze them,

29:42.200 --> 29:44.480
 which means quantitatively I say,

29:44.480 --> 29:46.760
 not only does it work, but it works this fast.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.560
 Okay, and so I need math for that.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.600
 And then there's the standard way to structure data inside

29:52.600 --> 29:56.080
 and represent information in the computer.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.360
 So that's all volume one.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.520
 Volume two talks, it's called Seminumerical Algorithms.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.200
 And here we're writing programs,

30:04.200 --> 30:07.240
 but we're also dealing with numbers.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.480
 Algorithms deal with any kinds of objects,

30:10.480 --> 30:13.440
 but specific when there's objects or numbers,

30:13.440 --> 30:17.920
 well then we have certain special paradigms

30:17.920 --> 30:20.680
 that apply to things that involve numbers.

30:20.680 --> 30:24.800
 And so there's arithmetic on numbers

30:24.800 --> 30:27.400
 and there's matrices full of numbers,

30:27.400 --> 30:29.040
 there's random numbers,

30:29.040 --> 30:31.680
 and there's power series full of numbers.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.360
 There's different algebraic concepts

30:34.360 --> 30:37.280
 that have numbers in structured ways.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.800
 And arithmetic in the way a computer

30:38.800 --> 30:41.640
 would think about arithmetic, so floating point.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.880
 Floating point arithmetic, high precision arithmetic,

30:44.880 --> 30:47.080
 not only addition, subtraction, multiplication,

30:47.080 --> 30:49.200
 but also comparison of numbers.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.840
 So then volume three talks about.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.320
 I like that one, sorting and search.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.080
 Sorting and search. I love sorting.

30:57.080 --> 31:00.960
 Right, so here we're not dealing necessarily with numbers

31:00.960 --> 31:03.760
 because you sort letters and other objects

31:03.760 --> 31:06.440
 and searching we're doing all the time with Google nowadays,

31:06.440 --> 31:09.560
 but I mean, we have to find stuff.

31:09.560 --> 31:14.480
 So again, algorithms that underlie

31:14.480 --> 31:16.760
 all kinds of applications.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.160
 None of these volumes is about a particular application,

31:19.160 --> 31:20.840
 but the applications are examples

31:20.840 --> 31:23.640
 of why people want to know about sorting,

31:23.640 --> 31:26.680
 why people want to know about random numbers.

31:26.680 --> 31:31.080
 So then volume four goes into combinatorial algorithm.

31:31.080 --> 31:34.960
 This is where we have zillions of things to deal with

31:34.960 --> 31:39.960
 and here we keep finding cases where one good idea

31:41.880 --> 31:45.960
 can make something go more than a million times faster.

31:45.960 --> 31:49.480
 And we're dealing with problems

31:49.480 --> 31:53.800
 that are probably never gonna be solved efficiently,

31:53.800 --> 31:56.960
 but that doesn't mean we give up on them

31:56.960 --> 32:00.480
 and we have this chance to have good ideas

32:00.480 --> 32:02.200
 and go much, much faster on them.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.800
 So that's combinatorial algorithms

32:04.800 --> 32:06.880
 and those are the ones that are,

32:06.880 --> 32:09.840
 I mean, you said sorting is most fun for you.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.600
 It's true, it's fun, but combinatorial algorithms

32:13.600 --> 32:18.080
 are the ones that I always enjoyed the most

32:18.080 --> 32:22.160
 because that's when my skillet programming had most payoff.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.080
 The difference between an obvious algorithm

32:26.080 --> 32:31.080
 that you think up first thing and an interesting,

32:31.760 --> 32:34.160
 subtle algorithm that's not so obvious,

32:34.160 --> 32:37.360
 but run circles around the other one,

32:37.360 --> 32:42.360
 that's where computer science really comes in.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.800
 And a lot of these combinatorial methods

32:46.800 --> 32:49.640
 were found first in applications

32:49.640 --> 32:52.400
 to artificial intelligence or cryptography.

32:52.400 --> 32:57.400
 And in my case, I just liked them

32:58.160 --> 33:01.560
 and it was associated more with puzzles.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.080
 Do you like them most in the domain of graphs

33:04.080 --> 33:04.960
 and graph theory?

33:04.960 --> 33:08.560
 Graphs are great because they're terrific models

33:08.560 --> 33:10.600
 of so many things in the real world

33:10.600 --> 33:13.480
 and you throw numbers on a graph,

33:13.480 --> 33:18.480
 you got a network and so there you have many more things.

33:18.480 --> 33:23.480
 But combinatorial in general is any arrangement

33:24.360 --> 33:29.360
 of objects that has some kind of higher structure,

33:30.720 --> 33:35.160
 nonrandom structure and is it possible

33:35.160 --> 33:39.360
 to put something together satisfying all these conditions?

33:39.360 --> 33:41.800
 Like I mentioned arrows a minute ago,

33:41.800 --> 33:44.440
 is there a way to put these numbers

33:44.440 --> 33:47.120
 on a bunch of boxes that are pointing to each other?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.800
 Is that gonna be possible at all?

33:48.800 --> 33:50.040
 That's volume four.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.120
 That's volume four.

33:52.120 --> 33:52.960
 What does the future hold?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.800
 Volume four A was part one.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.720
 And what happened was in 1962,

33:58.720 --> 34:03.440
 when I started writing down a table of contents,

34:03.440 --> 34:04.800
 it wasn't gonna be a book

34:04.800 --> 34:07.400
 about computer programming in general,

34:07.400 --> 34:10.640
 it was gonna be a book about how to write compilers.

34:10.640 --> 34:14.200
 And I was asked to write a book

34:14.200 --> 34:16.840
 explaining how to write a compiler.

34:16.840 --> 34:21.840
 And at that time, there were only a few dozen people

34:22.480 --> 34:24.120
 in the world who had written compilers

34:24.120 --> 34:25.440
 and I happened to be one of them.

34:25.440 --> 34:30.440
 And I also had some experience writing

34:30.840 --> 34:35.480
 for like the campus newspaper and things like that.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.680
 So I said, okay, great.

34:38.680 --> 34:42.160
 I'm the only person I know who's written a compiler

34:42.160 --> 34:43.960
 but hasn't invented any new techniques

34:43.960 --> 34:45.400
 for writing compilers.

34:45.400 --> 34:49.760
 And all the other people I knew had super ideas

34:49.760 --> 34:52.320
 but I couldn't see that they would be able to write a book

34:52.320 --> 34:55.760
 that would describe anybody else's ideas with their own.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.760
 So I could be the journalist and I could explain

34:59.760 --> 35:04.280
 what all these cool ideas about compiler writing were.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.280
 And then I started putting down,

35:07.280 --> 35:10.200
 well, yeah, you need to have a chapter

35:10.200 --> 35:11.080
 about data structures.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.880
 You need to have some introductory material.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.200
 I wanna talk about searching

35:15.200 --> 35:20.200
 because a compiler writer has to look up the variables

35:21.440 --> 35:24.440
 in a symbol table and find out which,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.840
 when you write the name of a variable in one place,

35:29.840 --> 35:31.520
 it's supposed to be the same

35:31.520 --> 35:32.680
 as the one you put somewhere else.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.760
 So you need all these basic techniques

35:35.760 --> 35:40.000
 and I kinda know some arithmetic and stuff.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.040
 So I threw in these chapters

35:42.040 --> 35:44.560
 and I threw in a chapter on combinatorics

35:44.560 --> 35:48.400
 because that was what I really enjoyed programming the most

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
 but there weren't many algorithms known

35:50.400 --> 35:52.800
 about combinatorial methods in 1962.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.440
 So that was a kind of a short chapter

35:55.440 --> 35:58.160
 but it was sort of thrown in just for fun.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.400
 And chapter 12 was gonna be actual compilers,

36:01.400 --> 36:04.440
 applying all the stuff in chapters one to 11

36:05.600 --> 36:06.560
 to make compilers.

36:06.560 --> 36:10.640
 Well, okay, so that was my table of contents from 1962.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.400
 And during the 70s, the whole field of combinatorics

36:15.400 --> 36:17.880
 went through a huge explosion.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.040
 People talk about a combinatorial explosion

36:20.040 --> 36:23.560
 and they usually mean by that that the number of cases

36:23.560 --> 36:26.600
 goes up, you know, you change end to end plus one

36:26.600 --> 36:28.640
 and all of a sudden your problem

36:28.640 --> 36:31.600
 has gotten more than 10 times harder.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.360
 But there was an explosion of ideas

36:35.360 --> 36:38.440
 about combinatorics in the 70s to the point

36:38.440 --> 36:43.440
 that like take 1975, I bet you more than half

36:44.600 --> 36:46.840
 of all the journals of computer science

36:46.840 --> 36:49.560
 were about combinatorial methods.

36:49.560 --> 36:52.440
 What kind of problems were occupying people's minds?

36:52.440 --> 36:54.760
 What kind of problems in combinatorics?

36:54.760 --> 36:57.800
 Was it satisfiability, graph theory?

36:57.800 --> 36:59.880
 Yeah, graph theory was quite dominant.

36:59.880 --> 37:04.880
 I mean, but all of the NP hard problems

37:04.880 --> 37:08.800
 that you have like Hamiltonian path.

37:08.800 --> 37:09.800
 Travel salesman.

37:09.800 --> 37:14.280
 Going beyond graphs, you had operation research

37:14.280 --> 37:17.960
 whenever there was a small class of problems

37:17.960 --> 37:20.200
 that had efficient solutions and they were usually

37:20.200 --> 37:21.960
 associated with matron theory,

37:21.960 --> 37:24.640
 special mathematical construction.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.640
 But once we went to things that involve

37:27.640 --> 37:30.440
 three things at a time instead of two,

37:30.440 --> 37:32.480
 all of a sudden things got harder.

37:32.480 --> 37:37.480
 So we had satisfiability problems where if you have clauses,

37:37.880 --> 37:40.640
 every clause has two logical elements in it,

37:40.640 --> 37:43.120
 then we can satisfy it in linear time.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.200
 We can test for satisfiability in linear time,

37:45.200 --> 37:49.080
 but if you allow yourself three variables in the clause,

37:49.960 --> 37:52.560
 then nobody knows how to do it.

37:52.560 --> 37:56.840
 So these articles were about trying to find better ways

37:56.840 --> 38:01.840
 to solve cryptography problems and graph theory problems.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.800
 We have lots of data, but we didn't know how to find

38:05.800 --> 38:07.160
 the best subsets of the data.

38:07.160 --> 38:12.040
 Like with sorting, we could get the answer.

38:12.040 --> 38:12.920
 Didn't take long.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.920
 So how did it continue to change from the 70s to today?

38:16.920 --> 38:20.680
 Yeah, so now there may be half a dozen conferences

38:20.680 --> 38:24.920
 whose topic is combinatorics, a different kind,

38:24.920 --> 38:28.520
 but fortunately I don't have to rewrite my book every month

38:28.520 --> 38:31.120
 like I had to in the 70s.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.000
 But still there's huge amount of work being done

38:34.000 --> 38:37.680
 and people getting better ideas on these problems

38:37.680 --> 38:41.400
 that don't seem to have really efficient solutions,

38:41.400 --> 38:44.920
 but we still do a lot more with them.

38:44.920 --> 38:48.320
 And so this book that I'm finishing now is,

38:48.320 --> 38:51.320
 I've got a whole bunch of brand new methods

38:51.320 --> 38:55.520
 that as far as I know, there's no other book

38:55.520 --> 39:00.280
 that covers this particular approach.

39:00.280 --> 39:04.400
 And so I'm trying to do my best of exploring

39:04.400 --> 39:09.400
 the tip of the iceberg and I try out lots of things

39:10.080 --> 39:15.080
 and keep rewriting as I find better method.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.720
 So what's your writing process like?

39:18.720 --> 39:22.040
 What's your thinking and writing process like every day?

39:24.240 --> 39:25.600
 What's your routine even?

39:26.480 --> 39:29.720
 Yeah, I guess it's actually the best question

39:29.720 --> 39:34.720
 because I spend seven days a week doing it.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.960
 You're the most prepared to answer it.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.720
 Yeah, but okay.

39:38.720 --> 39:43.720
 So the chair I'm sitting in is where I do...

39:45.000 --> 39:46.680
 It's where the magic happens.

39:46.680 --> 39:49.920
 Well, reading and writing, the chair is usually

39:49.920 --> 39:51.760
 sitting over there where I have other books,

39:51.760 --> 39:55.520
 some reference books, but I found this chair

39:55.520 --> 40:00.400
 which was designed by a Swedish guy anyway.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.960
 It turns out this is the only chair I can really sit in

40:02.960 --> 40:05.640
 for hours and hours and not know that I'm in a chair.

40:05.640 --> 40:09.000
 But then I have the standup desk right next to us

40:09.000 --> 40:13.920
 and so after I write something with pencil and eraser,

40:13.920 --> 40:18.080
 I get up and I type it and revise and rewrite.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.160
 I'm standing up.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.560
 The kernel of the idea is first put on paper.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.400
 Yeah.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.240
 Right.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.440
 And I'll write maybe five programs a week,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
 of course, literate programming.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.480
 And these are, before I describe something in my book,

40:36.480 --> 40:39.040
 I always program it to see how it's working

40:39.040 --> 40:40.120
 and I try it a lot.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.040
 So for example, I learned at the end of January,

40:45.040 --> 40:49.960
 I learned of a breakthrough by four Japanese people

40:49.960 --> 40:54.320
 who had extended one of my methods in a new direction.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.760
 And so I spent the next five days writing a program

40:57.760 --> 40:59.480
 to implement what they did.

40:59.480 --> 41:04.480
 And then they had only generalized part of what I had done

41:04.560 --> 41:07.560
 so then I had to see if I could generalize more parts of it.

41:07.560 --> 41:10.400
 And then I had to take their approach

41:10.400 --> 41:13.840
 and I had to try it out on a couple of dozen

41:13.840 --> 41:16.440
 of the other problems I had already worked out

41:16.440 --> 41:18.320
 with my old methods.

41:18.320 --> 41:20.200
 And so that took another couple of weeks.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.920
 And then I started to see the light

41:23.920 --> 41:28.840
 and I started writing the final draft

41:28.840 --> 41:32.320
 and then I would type it up,

41:32.320 --> 41:34.720
 involve some new mathematical questions.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.440
 And so I wrote to my friends

41:36.440 --> 41:39.560
 who might be good at solving those problems

41:39.560 --> 41:42.560
 and they solved some of them.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.760
 So I put that in as exercises.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.160
 And so a month later, I had absorbed one new idea

41:50.160 --> 41:54.920
 that I learned and I'm glad I heard about it in time.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.760
 Otherwise, I wouldn't put my book out

41:56.760 --> 41:59.000
 before I'd heard about the idea.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.560
 On the other hand, this book was supposed to come in

42:01.560 --> 42:04.340
 at 300 pages and I'm up to 350 now.

42:04.340 --> 42:06.760
 That added 10 pages to the book.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.280
 But if I learn about another one,

42:09.280 --> 42:11.080
 my publisher is gonna shoot me.

42:11.080 --> 42:16.080
 Well, so in that process, in that one month process,

42:17.080 --> 42:19.280
 are some days harder than others?

42:19.280 --> 42:20.960
 Are some days harder than others?

42:20.960 --> 42:24.340
 Well, yeah, my work is fun, but I also work hard

42:24.340 --> 42:27.120
 and every big job has parts

42:27.120 --> 42:29.280
 that are a lot more fun than others.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.900
 And so many days I'll say,

42:31.900 --> 42:35.160
 why do I have to have such high standards?

42:35.160 --> 42:37.480
 Why couldn't I just be sloppy and not try this out

42:37.480 --> 42:40.240
 and just report the answer?

42:40.240 --> 42:45.240
 But I know that people are calling me to do this

42:45.240 --> 42:50.060
 and so, okay, so, okay, Don, I'll grit my teeth and do it.

42:50.060 --> 42:54.240
 And then the joy comes out when I see that actually,

42:54.240 --> 42:58.960
 I'm getting good results and I get even more

42:58.960 --> 43:01.440
 when I see that somebody has actually read

43:01.440 --> 43:02.640
 and understood what I wrote

43:02.640 --> 43:05.680
 and told me how to make it even better.

43:05.680 --> 43:10.680
 I did wanna mention something about the method.

43:10.680 --> 43:15.680
 So I got this tablet here, where I do the first,

43:20.040 --> 43:23.760
 the first writing of concepts, okay, so.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.800
 And what language is that in?

43:27.800 --> 43:29.920
 Right, so take a look at it, but you know,

43:29.920 --> 43:33.000
 here, random say, explain how to draw

43:33.000 --> 43:36.200
 such skewed pixel diagrams, okay, so.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.600
 I got this paper about 40 years ago

43:39.600 --> 43:42.120
 when I was visiting my sister in Canada

43:42.120 --> 43:47.120
 and they make tablets of paper with this nice large size

43:47.240 --> 43:48.080
 and just the right.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.680
 A very small space between lines.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.240
 Small spaces, yeah, yeah, take a look.

43:51.240 --> 43:54.400
 Maybe also just show it.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.240
 Yeah.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.720
 Yeah.

43:57.720 --> 43:58.560
 Wow.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.560
 You know, I've got these manuscripts

44:00.560 --> 44:01.960
 going back to the 60s.

44:04.600 --> 44:09.360
 And those are where I'm getting my ideas on paper, okay.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.640
 But I'm a good typist.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.640
 In fact, I went to typing school when I was in high school

44:14.640 --> 44:17.560
 and so I can type faster than I think.

44:17.560 --> 44:21.000
 So then when I do the editing, stand up and type,

44:21.000 --> 44:24.760
 then I revise this and it comes out a lot different

44:24.760 --> 44:27.840
 than what, you know, for style and rhythm

44:27.840 --> 44:31.000
 and things like that come out at the typing stage.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.840
 And you type in tech.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.160
 And I type in tech.

44:34.160 --> 44:37.240
 And can you think in tech?

44:37.240 --> 44:38.200
 No.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.040
 So.

44:39.040 --> 44:43.360
 To a certain extent, I have only a small number of idioms

44:43.360 --> 44:44.200
 that I use.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.400
 Like, you know, I'm beginning with theorem,

44:45.400 --> 44:47.640
 I do something for displayed equation,

44:47.640 --> 44:49.920
 I do something and so on.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.360
 But I have to see it and.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.280
 In the way that it's on paper here.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.120
 Yeah, right.

44:56.120 --> 44:59.400
 So for example, Turing wrote, what, The Other Direction.

44:59.400 --> 45:04.320
 You don't write macros, you don't think in macros.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.080
 Not particularly, but when I need a macro,

45:06.080 --> 45:09.840
 I'll go ahead and do it.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.840
 But the thing is, I also write to fit.

45:12.840 --> 45:17.840
 I mean, I'll change something if I can save a line.

45:18.400 --> 45:19.800
 You know, it's like haiku.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.880
 I'll figure out a way to rewrite the sentence

45:21.880 --> 45:25.200
 so that it'll look better on the page.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.360
 And I shouldn't be wasting my time on that,

45:27.360 --> 45:32.200
 but I can't resist because I know it's only another 3%

45:32.200 --> 45:33.880
 of the time or something like that.

45:33.880 --> 45:36.040
 And it could also be argued that

45:36.040 --> 45:39.000
 that is what life is about.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.480
 Ah, yes, in fact, that's true.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.360
 Like, I work in the garden one day a week

45:45.360 --> 45:48.400
 and that's kind of a description of my life

45:48.400 --> 45:50.800
 is getting rid of weeds, you know,

45:50.800 --> 45:52.880
 removing bugs for programs.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.600
 So, you know, a lot of writers talk about,

45:55.600 --> 45:58.920
 you know, basically suffering, the writing processes,

45:58.920 --> 46:02.120
 having, you know, it's extremely difficult.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.160
 And I think of programming, especially,

46:05.160 --> 46:08.800
 or technical writing that you're doing can be like that.

46:08.800 --> 46:13.440
 Do you find yourself, methodologically,

46:13.440 --> 46:16.960
 how do you every day sit down to do the work?

46:16.960 --> 46:18.560
 Is it a challenge?

46:18.560 --> 46:22.760
 You kind of say it's, you know, it's fun.

46:24.800 --> 46:29.120
 But it'd be interesting to hear if there are non fun parts

46:29.120 --> 46:31.120
 that you really struggle with.

46:31.120 --> 46:35.640
 Yeah, so the fun comes when I'm able to put together

46:35.640 --> 46:39.440
 ideas of two people who didn't know about each other.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.760
 And so I might be the first person

46:41.760 --> 46:44.240
 that saw both of their ideas.

46:44.240 --> 46:47.880
 And so then, you know, then I get to make the synthesis

46:47.880 --> 46:52.120
 and that gives me a chance to be creative.

46:52.120 --> 46:56.720
 But the dredge work is where I've got to chase everything

46:56.720 --> 46:57.720
 down to its root.

46:57.720 --> 47:00.200
 This leads me into really interesting stuff.

47:00.200 --> 47:05.200
 I mean, I learn about Sanskrit and I try to give credit

47:05.840 --> 47:06.760
 to all the authors.

47:06.760 --> 47:11.760
 And so I write to people who know the authors

47:12.480 --> 47:16.000
 if they're dead or I communicate this way.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.480
 And I got to get the math right.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.480
 And I got to tackle all my programs,

47:20.480 --> 47:22.800
 try to find holes in them.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.840
 And I rewrite the programs after I get a better idea.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.960
 Is there ever dead ends?

47:28.960 --> 47:31.720
 Oh yeah, I throw stuff out, yeah.

47:31.720 --> 47:36.160
 One of the things that I spend a lot of time preparing,

47:36.160 --> 47:39.000
 a major example based on the game of baseball.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.160
 And I know a lot of people for whom baseball

47:44.160 --> 47:46.520
 is the most important thing in the world.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.040
 But I also know a lot of people for whom cricket

47:49.040 --> 47:52.720
 is the most important in the world or soccer or something.

47:52.720 --> 47:57.720
 You know, and I realized that if I had a big example,

47:57.720 --> 47:59.840
 I mean, it was gonna have a fold out illustration

47:59.840 --> 48:00.800
 and everything.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.640
 And I was saying, well, what am I really teaching

48:02.640 --> 48:06.800
 about algorithms here where I had this baseball example?

48:06.800 --> 48:10.440
 And if I was a person who knew only cricket,

48:10.440 --> 48:12.920
 wouldn't they, what would they think about this?

48:12.920 --> 48:14.920
 And so I've ripped the whole thing out.

48:14.920 --> 48:19.160
 But I had something that would have really appealed

48:19.160 --> 48:20.960
 to people who grew up with baseball

48:20.960 --> 48:24.160
 as a major theme in their life.

48:24.160 --> 48:28.920
 Which is a lot of people, but still a minority.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.120
 Small minority, I took out bowling too.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.680
 Even a smaller minority.

48:36.560 --> 48:40.920
 What's the art in the art of programming?

48:40.920 --> 48:45.080
 Why is there, of the few words in the title,

48:45.080 --> 48:46.440
 why is art one of them?

48:46.440 --> 48:50.760
 Yeah, well, that's what I wrote my Turing lecture about.

48:50.760 --> 48:54.640
 And so when people talk about art,

48:54.640 --> 48:57.840
 it really, I mean, what the word means is

49:00.160 --> 49:02.480
 something that's not in nature.

49:02.480 --> 49:05.040
 So when you have artificial intelligence,

49:06.440 --> 49:09.240
 art comes from the same root,

49:09.240 --> 49:11.200
 saying that this is something

49:11.200 --> 49:14.560
 that was created by human beings.

49:14.560 --> 49:19.320
 And then it's gotten a further meaning often of fine art,

49:19.320 --> 49:21.840
 which has this beauty to the mix.

49:21.840 --> 49:25.120
 And so we have things that are artistically done,

49:25.120 --> 49:28.240
 and this means not only done by humans,

49:28.240 --> 49:33.240
 but also done in a way that's elegant and brings joy.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.880
 And has, I guess,

49:39.880 --> 49:44.200
 Tolstoy versus Dostoevsky going back.

49:44.200 --> 49:48.720
 But anyway, it's that part that says

49:48.720 --> 49:53.240
 that it's done well, as well as not only different

49:53.240 --> 49:54.080
 from nature.

49:54.080 --> 49:59.080
 In general, then, art is what human beings

49:59.880 --> 50:01.680
 are specifically good at.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.440
 And when they say artificial intelligence,

50:04.440 --> 50:07.400
 well, they're trying to mimic human beings.

50:07.400 --> 50:11.160
 But there's an element of fine art and beauty.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.000
 You are one.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.680
 That's what I try to also say,

50:14.680 --> 50:19.680
 that you can write a program and make a work of art.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.920
 So now, in terms of surprising,

50:27.080 --> 50:31.920
 what ideas in writing from search

50:31.920 --> 50:34.080
 to the combinatorial algorithms,

50:34.080 --> 50:37.160
 what ideas have you come across

50:37.160 --> 50:42.160
 that were particularly surprising to you

50:42.160 --> 50:47.160
 that changed the way you see a space of problems?

50:48.280 --> 50:49.960
 I get a surprise every time I have a bug

50:49.960 --> 50:51.760
 in my program, obviously.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.960
 But that isn't really what you're at.

50:53.960 --> 50:57.120
 More transformational than surprising.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.360
 For example, in volume 4A,

50:59.360 --> 51:02.280
 I was especially surprised when I learned

51:02.280 --> 51:05.480
 about data structure called BDD,

51:05.480 --> 51:06.920
 Boolean Decision Diagram.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.440
 Because I sort of had the feeling

51:10.440 --> 51:14.720
 that as an old timer,

51:14.720 --> 51:19.200
 and I've been programming since the 50s,

51:19.200 --> 51:23.240
 and BDDs weren't invented until 1986.

51:23.240 --> 51:26.880
 And here comes a brand new idea that revolutionizes

51:26.880 --> 51:29.560
 the way to represent a Boolean function.

51:29.560 --> 51:32.040
 And Boolean functions are so basic

51:32.040 --> 51:33.680
 to all kinds of things in,

51:35.480 --> 51:39.400
 I mean, logic is, underlies it.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.360
 Everything we can describe,

51:41.360 --> 51:44.120
 all of what we know in terms of logic somehow,

51:45.880 --> 51:49.240
 and propositional logic,

51:49.240 --> 51:52.800
 I thought that was cut and dried

51:52.800 --> 51:54.240
 and everything was known.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.480
 But here comes

51:58.560 --> 51:59.400
 Randy Bryant

52:00.680 --> 52:05.680
 and discovers that BDDs are incredibly powerful.

52:05.680 --> 52:10.680
 Then, so that means I have a whole new section

52:12.800 --> 52:14.400
 to the book that I never would have thought of

52:14.400 --> 52:17.480
 until 1986, not even until 1990s,

52:17.480 --> 52:21.000
 when people started to use it

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
 for a billion dollar of applications.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.280
 And it was the standard way to design computers

52:29.280 --> 52:30.120
 for a long time,

52:30.120 --> 52:34.440
 until SAT solvers came along in the year 2000.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.960
 So that's another great big surprise.

52:36.960 --> 52:40.480
 So a lot of these things have totally changed

52:40.480 --> 52:42.440
 the structure of my book.

52:42.440 --> 52:47.040
 And the middle third of volume 4B is about SAT solvers,

52:47.040 --> 52:51.200
 and that's 300 plus pages,

52:51.200 --> 52:55.000
 which is all about material,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.960
 mostly about material that was discovered in this century.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.000
 And I had to start from scratch

53:02.000 --> 53:04.120
 and meet all the people in the field

53:04.120 --> 53:07.760
 and write 15 different SAT solvers

53:07.760 --> 53:10.280
 that I wrote while preparing that.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.720
 Seven of them are described in the book.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.240
 Others were from my own experience.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.960
 So newly invented data structures

53:17.960 --> 53:19.680
 or ways to represent?

53:20.720 --> 53:22.640
 A whole new class of algorithm.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.480
 Whole new class of algorithm.

53:23.480 --> 53:27.000
 Yeah, and the interesting thing about the BDDs

53:27.000 --> 53:30.440
 was that the theoreticians started looking at it

53:30.440 --> 53:33.920
 and started to describe all the things

53:33.920 --> 53:35.400
 you couldn't do with BDDs.

53:36.440 --> 53:40.480
 And so they were getting a bad name

53:42.360 --> 53:45.480
 because, okay, they were useful,

53:45.480 --> 53:48.280
 but they didn't solve every problem.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.440
 I'm sure that the theoreticians are,

53:50.440 --> 53:51.760
 in the next 10 years,

53:51.760 --> 53:54.480
 are gonna show why machine learning

53:54.480 --> 53:56.360
 doesn't solve everything.

53:56.360 --> 53:59.680
 But I'm not only worried about the worst case,

53:59.680 --> 54:03.640
 I get a huge delight when I can actually solve a problem

54:03.640 --> 54:05.360
 that I couldn't solve before.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.520
 Even though I can't solve the problem

54:07.520 --> 54:10.560
 that it suggests is a further problem,

54:10.560 --> 54:14.160
 I know that I'm way better than I was before.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.520
 And so I found out that BDDs could do

54:16.520 --> 54:19.840
 all kinds of miraculous things.

54:19.840 --> 54:24.840
 And so I had to spend quite a few years

54:27.080 --> 54:31.040
 learning about that territory.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.800
 So in general, what brings you more pleasure?

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
 Proving or showing a worst case analysis of an algorithm

54:40.000 --> 54:43.840
 or showing a good average case

54:43.840 --> 54:45.840
 or just showing a good case?

54:45.840 --> 54:46.920
 That something good,

54:46.920 --> 54:49.320
 pragmatically can be done with this algorithm.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.640
 Yeah, I like a good case

54:50.640 --> 54:53.920
 that is maybe only a million times faster

54:53.920 --> 54:55.320
 than I was able to do before.

54:55.320 --> 54:57.680
 But, and not worry about the fact

54:57.680 --> 55:02.600
 that it's still gonna take too long

55:02.600 --> 55:04.360
 if I double the size of the problem.

55:05.640 --> 55:10.040
 So that said, you popularized the asymptotic notation

55:10.040 --> 55:13.120
 for describing running time,

55:13.120 --> 55:15.560
 obviously in the analysis of algorithms.

55:15.560 --> 55:18.440
 Worst case is such an important part.

55:18.440 --> 55:22.360
 Do you see any aspects of that kind of analysis

55:22.360 --> 55:26.080
 as lacking and notation too?

55:26.080 --> 55:29.440
 Well, the main purpose should have notations

55:29.440 --> 55:33.240
 that help us for the problems we wanna solve.

55:33.240 --> 55:36.200
 And so they match our intuitions.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.920
 And people who worked in number theory

55:38.920 --> 55:43.120
 had used asymptotic notation in a certain way,

55:43.120 --> 55:46.360
 but it was only known to a small group of people.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.280
 And I realized that, in fact,

55:49.280 --> 55:52.720
 it was very useful to be able to have a notation

55:52.720 --> 55:55.040
 for something that we don't know exactly what it is,

55:55.040 --> 55:57.400
 but we only know partial about it.

55:57.400 --> 56:00.640
 And so instead, so for example,

56:00.640 --> 56:02.240
 instead of big O notation,

56:02.240 --> 56:05.400
 let's just take a much simpler notation

56:05.400 --> 56:10.280
 where I'd say zero or one, or zero, one or two.

56:10.280 --> 56:13.880
 And suppose that when I had been in high school,

56:13.880 --> 56:18.120
 we would be allowed to put in the middle of our formula,

56:18.120 --> 56:23.120
 X plus zero, one or two equals Y, okay?

56:23.120 --> 56:27.080
 And then we would learn how to multiply

56:27.080 --> 56:32.080
 two such expressions together and deal with them.

56:32.720 --> 56:35.400
 Well, the same thing big O notation says,

56:35.400 --> 56:38.960
 here's something that's, I'm not sure what it is,

56:38.960 --> 56:40.360
 but I know it's not too big.

56:41.560 --> 56:44.200
 I know it's not bigger than some constant times N squared

56:44.200 --> 56:45.520
 or something like that.

56:45.520 --> 56:47.320
 So I write big O of N squared.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.120
 And now I learned how to add big O of N squared

56:50.120 --> 56:51.120
 to big O of N cubed.

56:51.120 --> 56:55.160
 And I know how to add big O of N squared to plus one

56:55.160 --> 56:58.400
 and square that and how to take logarithmic exponentials

56:58.400 --> 57:00.400
 where I have big O's in the middle of them.

57:00.400 --> 57:04.640
 And that turned out to be hugely valuable

57:04.640 --> 57:06.300
 in all of the work that I was trying to do

57:06.300 --> 57:09.480
 as I'm trying to figure out how good an algorithm is.

57:09.480 --> 57:12.800
 So have there been algorithms in your journey

57:12.800 --> 57:16.780
 that perform very differently in practice

57:16.780 --> 57:18.780
 than they do in theory?

57:18.780 --> 57:21.360
 Well, the worst case of a combinatorial algorithm

57:21.360 --> 57:23.560
 is almost always horrible.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.040
 But we have SAT solvers that are solving,

57:28.040 --> 57:33.000
 where one of the last exercises in that part of my book

57:33.000 --> 57:37.200
 was to figure out a problem that has 100 variables

57:37.200 --> 57:39.780
 that's difficult for a SAT solver.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.960
 But you would think that a problem

57:43.960 --> 57:46.280
 with 100 billion variables has,

57:46.280 --> 57:50.960
 requires you to do two to the 100th operations

57:50.960 --> 57:52.720
 because that's the number of possibilities

57:52.720 --> 57:56.000
 when you have 100 billion variables in two to the 100th.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.240
 Two to the 100th is way bigger than we can handle.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.040
 10 to the 17th is a lot.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
 You've mentioned over the past few years

58:05.160 --> 58:08.520
 that you believe P may be equal to NP,

58:08.520 --> 58:10.000
 but that it's not really,

58:11.640 --> 58:14.040
 if somebody does prove that P equals NP,

58:14.040 --> 58:16.680
 it will not directly lead to an actual algorithm

58:16.680 --> 58:18.540
 to solve difficult problems.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.580
 Can you explain your intuition here?

58:21.580 --> 58:23.440
 Has it been changed?

58:23.440 --> 58:25.480
 And in general, on the difference between

58:25.480 --> 58:28.760
 easy and difficult problems of P and NP and so on?

58:28.760 --> 58:33.760
 Yeah, so the popular idea is if an algorithm exists,

58:34.960 --> 58:36.960
 then somebody will find it.

58:36.960 --> 58:41.960
 And it's just a matter of writing it down.

58:44.700 --> 58:48.420
 But many more algorithms exist

58:48.420 --> 58:51.740
 than anybody can understand or ever make use of.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.200
 Or discover, yeah.

58:53.200 --> 58:56.900
 Because they're just way beyond human comprehension.

58:56.900 --> 59:01.900
 The total number of algorithms is more than mind boggling.

59:03.580 --> 59:06.500
 So we have situations now

59:06.500 --> 59:08.740
 where we know that algorithms exist,

59:08.740 --> 59:12.900
 but we don't have the farthest idea what the algorithms are.

59:12.900 --> 59:17.900
 There are simple examples based on game playing

59:18.540 --> 59:22.220
 where you have, where you say,

59:22.220 --> 59:25.140
 well, there must be an algorithm that exists

59:25.140 --> 59:27.940
 to win in the game of Hex because,

59:27.940 --> 59:29.740
 for the first player to win in the game of Hex

59:29.740 --> 59:33.500
 because Hex is always either a win

59:33.500 --> 59:35.180
 for the first player or the second player.

59:35.180 --> 59:36.220
 Well, what's the game of Hex?

59:36.220 --> 59:38.660
 There's a game of Hex which is based

59:38.660 --> 59:42.180
 on putting pebbles onto a hexagonal board

59:42.180 --> 59:45.140
 and the white player tries to get a white path

59:45.140 --> 59:47.100
 from left to right and the black player tries

59:47.100 --> 59:49.660
 to get a black path from bottom to top.

59:49.660 --> 59:51.060
 And how does capture occur?

59:51.060 --> 59:51.900
 Just so I understand.

59:51.900 --> 59:53.040
 And there's no capture.

59:53.040 --> 59:56.180
 You just put pebbles down one at a time.

59:56.180 --> 59:58.780
 But there's no draws because after all the white

59:58.780 --> 1:00:01.340
 and black are played, there's either gonna be a white path

1:00:01.340 --> 1:00:05.740
 across from east to west or a black path from bottom to top.

1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:09.700
 So there's always, it's the perfect information game

1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:13.920
 and people take turns like tic tac toe.

1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:18.780
 And the hex board can be different sizes.

1:00:18.780 --> 1:00:21.700
 But anyway, there's no possibility of a draw

1:00:21.700 --> 1:00:24.460
 and players move one at a time.

1:00:24.460 --> 1:00:26.660
 And so it's gotta be either a first player win

1:00:26.660 --> 1:00:27.900
 or a second player win.

1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:30.860
 Mathematically, you follow out all the trees

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:34.500
 and either there's always a win for the first player,

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:36.100
 second player, okay.

1:00:36.100 --> 1:00:37.300
 And it's finite.

1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:38.680
 The game is finite.

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:41.260
 So there's an algorithm that will decide.

1:00:41.260 --> 1:00:43.900
 You can show it has to be one or the other

1:00:43.900 --> 1:00:46.940
 because the second player could mimic the first player

1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:48.680
 with kind of a pairing strategy.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:54.980
 And so you can show that it has to be one way or the other.

1:00:56.540 --> 1:00:58.580
 But we don't know any algorithm anyway.

1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:01.060
 We don't know the third or the fourth.

1:01:01.060 --> 1:01:03.500
 There are cases where you can prove the existence

1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:08.500
 of a solution but nobody knows any way how to find it.

1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:10.920
 But more like the algorithm question,

1:01:12.220 --> 1:01:15.420
 there's a very powerful theorem in graph theory

1:01:15.420 --> 1:01:20.420
 by Robinson and Seymour that says that every class

1:01:21.740 --> 1:01:25.140
 of graphs that is closed under taking minors

1:01:27.020 --> 1:01:29.620
 has a polynomial time algorithm to determine

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:31.540
 whether it's in this class or not.

1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:33.740
 Now a class of graphs, for example, planar graphs.

1:01:33.740 --> 1:01:35.520
 These are graphs that you can draw in a plane

1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:37.340
 without crossing lines.

1:01:37.340 --> 1:01:41.280
 And a planar graph, taking minors means

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.940
 that you can shrink an edge into a point

1:01:45.940 --> 1:01:47.520
 or you can delete an edge.

1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:51.160
 And so you start with a planar graph

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:54.260
 and shrink any edge to a point is still planar.

1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:56.660
 Delete an edge is still planar.

1:01:56.660 --> 1:02:01.660
 Okay, now, but there are millions of different ways

1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:11.580
 to describe a family of graph that still remains

1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:14.140
 the same under taking minor.

1:02:14.140 --> 1:02:17.780
 And Robertson and Seymour proved that any such family

1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:22.540
 of graphs, there's a finite number of minimum graphs

1:02:22.540 --> 1:02:27.540
 that are obstructions so that if it's not in the family,

1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:34.540
 then it has to contain, then there has to be a way

1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:37.540
 to shrink it down until you get one

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:40.620
 of these bad minimum graphs that's not in the family.

1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:44.500
 In the case of a planar graph, the minimum graph

1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:48.460
 is a five pointed star where everything points to another

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.780
 and the minimum graph consisting of trying

1:02:50.780 --> 1:02:52.780
 to connect three utilities to three houses

1:02:52.780 --> 1:02:54.420
 without crossing lines.

1:02:54.420 --> 1:02:58.300
 And so there are two bad graphs that are not planar

1:02:58.300 --> 1:03:01.220
 and every non planar graph contains one

1:03:01.220 --> 1:03:06.220
 of these two bad graphs by shrinking and removing edges.

1:03:07.060 --> 1:03:08.260
 Sorry, can you say it again?

1:03:08.260 --> 1:03:11.020
 So he proved that there's a finite number

1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:11.860
 of these bad graphs.

1:03:11.860 --> 1:03:13.180
 There's always a finite number.

1:03:13.180 --> 1:03:15.220
 So somebody says, here's a family.

1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:16.420
 It's hard to believe.

1:03:16.420 --> 1:03:20.860
 And they present a sequence of 20 papers.

1:03:20.860 --> 1:03:25.140
 I mean, it's deep work, but it's.

1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:27.340
 Because that's for any arbitrary class.

1:03:27.340 --> 1:03:29.780
 So for any arbitrary class that's closed

1:03:29.780 --> 1:03:31.060
 under taking minors.

1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:33.980
 That's closed under, maybe I'm not understanding

1:03:33.980 --> 1:03:35.220
 because it seems like a lot of them

1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:36.820
 are closed under taking minors.

1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:39.780
 Almost all the important classes of graphs are.

1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:43.820
 There are tons of such graphs, but also hundreds

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:48.140
 of them that arise in applications.

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:51.420
 I have a book over here called classes of graphs

1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:56.420
 and it's amazing how many different classes

1:03:57.260 --> 1:03:58.980
 of graphs that people have looked at.

1:03:58.980 --> 1:04:02.380
 So why do you bring up this theorem or this proof?

1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:06.220
 So now there are lots of algorithms that are known

1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:07.420
 for special class of graphs.

1:04:07.420 --> 1:04:10.740
 For example, if I have a certain, if I have a chordal graph

1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:12.400
 then I can color it efficiently.

1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:17.400
 If I have some kind of graphs, it'll make a great network.

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:22.600
 So you'd like to test, somebody gives you a graph

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:24.320
 and says, oh, is it in this family of graphs?

1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:28.360
 If so, then I can go to the library

1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:30.960
 and find an algorithm that's gonna solve my problem

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:31.800
 on that graph.

1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:37.200
 Okay, so we wanna have a graph that says,

1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:38.960
 an algorithm that says,

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:43.960
 you give me a graph, I'll tell you whether it's in this

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:48.720
 family or not, okay?

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:53.140
 And so all I have to do is test whether or not

1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:55.400
 that does this given graph have a minor,

1:04:55.400 --> 1:04:57.080
 that's one of the bad ones.

1:04:57.080 --> 1:04:59.720
 A minor is everything you can get by shrinking

1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:01.580
 and removing edges.

1:05:01.580 --> 1:05:04.720
 And given any minor, there's a polynomial time algorithm

1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:09.640
 saying, I can tell whether this is a minor of you.

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:11.680
 And there's a finite number of bad cases.

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:15.120
 So I just try, does it have this bad case?

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:17.160
 Polynomial time, I got the answer.

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:18.220
 Does it have this bad case?

1:05:18.220 --> 1:05:19.920
 Polynomial time, I got the answer.

1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:23.280
 Total polynomial time.

1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:24.720
 And so I've solved the problem.

1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:28.640
 However, all we know is that the number of minors is finite.

1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:32.160
 We don't know what, we might only know one or two

1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:34.360
 of those minors, but we don't know if we've got a,

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.000
 if we've got 20 of them, we don't know,

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.240
 there might be 21, 25, there's just some,

1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:42.640
 all we know is that it's finite.

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:44.680
 So here we have a polynomial time algorithm

1:05:44.680 --> 1:05:46.400
 that we don't know.

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:49.840
 That's a really great example of what you worry about

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:53.200
 or why you think P equals NP won't be useful.

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:58.200
 But still, why do you hold the intuition that P equals NP?

1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:03.200
 P equals NP because you have to rule out

1:06:03.480 --> 1:06:08.300
 so many possible algorithms as being not working.

1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:14.080
 You can take the graph and you can represent it

1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:18.320
 as in terms of certain prime numbers,

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.020
 and then you can multiply those together,

1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:23.440
 and then you can take the bitwise AND

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:28.440
 and construct some certain constant in polynomial time.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.240
 And then that's perfectly valid algorithm.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:37.160
 And there's so many algorithms of that kind.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:38.680
 A lot of times we see random,

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:46.120
 take data and we get coincidences

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:51.120
 that some fairly random looking number actually is useful

1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:56.120
 because it happens to solve a problem

1:06:59.660 --> 1:07:04.660
 just because there's so many hairs on your head.

1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:10.880
 But it seems like unlikely that two people

1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:13.400
 are gonna have the same number of hairs on their head.

1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:17.520
 But they're obvious, but you can count

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:20.680
 how many people there are and how many hairs on the head.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:22.600
 There must be people walking around in the country

1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:24.720
 that have the same number of hairs on their head.

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.720
 Well, that's a kind of a coincidence

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:30.400
 that you might say also this particular combination

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:32.960
 of operations just happens to prove

1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:36.920
 that the graph has a Hamiltonian path.

1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:41.440
 I see lots of cases where unexpected things happen

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:44.260
 when you have enough possibilities.

1:07:44.260 --> 1:07:46.640
 So because the space of possibility is so huge,

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:47.960
 your intuition just says it's not.

1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:49.240
 You have to rule them all out.

1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:51.720
 And so that's the reason for my intuition.

1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:53.240
 It's by no means a proof.

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:58.240
 I mean, some people say, well, P can't equal NP

1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:00.600
 because you've had all these smart people.

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:05.440
 The smartest designers of algorithms

1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:09.080
 have been racking their brains for years and years

1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:11.080
 and there's million dollar prizes out there

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:16.080
 and none of them, nobody has thought of the algorithm.

1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:19.240
 So there must be no such algorithm.

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:23.040
 On the other hand, I can use exactly the same logic

1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:25.840
 and I can say, well, P must be equal to NP

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:27.760
 because there's so many smart people out here

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:30.520
 have been trying to prove it unequal to NP

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:31.760
 and they've all failed.

1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:36.880
 This kind of reminds me of the discussion

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:39.200
 about the search for aliens.

1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:40.540
 They've been trying to look for them

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:43.880
 and we haven't found them yet, therefore they don't exist.

1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:46.280
 But you can show that there's so many planets out there

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:48.160
 that they very possibly could exist.

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:52.040
 Yeah, right, and then there's also the possibility

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:57.040
 that they exist but they all discovered machine learning

1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:00.920
 or something and then blew each other up.

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:03.640
 Well, on that small, quick tangent, let me ask,

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:05.200
 do you think there's intelligent life

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.040
 out there in the universe?

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:08.400
 I have no idea.

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:09.240
 Do you hope so?

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:10.400
 Do you think about it?

1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:14.920
 I don't spend my time thinking about things

1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:16.880
 that I could never know, really.

1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:19.160
 And yet you do enjoy the fact that there's many things

1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:20.360
 you don't know.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:23.840
 You do enjoy the mystery of things.

1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:27.680
 I enjoy the fact that I have limits, yeah.

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:32.680
 But I don't take time to answer unsolvable questions.

1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:34.960
 Got it.

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:38.940
 Well, because you've taken on some tough questions

1:09:38.940 --> 1:09:40.520
 that may seem unsolvable.

1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:42.600
 You have taken on some tough questions

1:09:42.600 --> 1:09:44.880
 that may seem unsolvable, but they're in the space.

1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:46.640
 It gives me a thrill when I can get further

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:48.960
 than I ever thought I could, yeah.

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:53.160
 But much like with religion, these.

1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:57.440
 I'm glad that there's no proof that God exists or not.

1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.280
 I mean, I think.

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:00.760
 It would spoil the mystery.

1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:02.940
 It would be too dull, yeah.

1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.240
 So to quickly talk about the other art

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:13.120
 of artificial intelligence, what's your view?

1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:16.720
 Artificial intelligence community has developed

1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:18.680
 as part of computer science and in parallel

1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:21.360
 with computer science since the 60s.

1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:26.360
 What's your view of the AI community from the 60s to now?

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.440
 So all the way through, it was the people

1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:34.440
 who were inspired by trying to mimic intelligence

1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:37.840
 or to do things that were somehow

1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:40.140
 the greatest achievements of intelligence

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:42.520
 that had been inspiration to people

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:45.360
 who have pushed the envelope of computer science

1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:50.320
 maybe more than any other group of people.

1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:53.040
 So all the way through, it's been a great source

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:58.040
 of good problems to sink teeth into.

1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:03.040
 Sink teeth into and getting partial answers

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:10.560
 and then more and more successful answers over the years.

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:13.840
 So this has been the inspiration

1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:16.400
 for lots of the great discoveries of computer science.

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:18.840
 Are you yourself captivated by the possibility

1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:23.200
 of creating, of algorithms having echoes

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:24.720
 of intelligence in them?

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:29.720
 Not as much as most of the people in the field, I guess,

1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:34.160
 I would say, but that's not to say that they're wrong

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:36.960
 or that it's just, you asked about my own personal

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:41.960
 preferences, but the thing that I worry about

1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:49.720
 is when people start believing that they've actually

1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:54.720
 succeeded and because the, it seems to me,

1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:01.520
 there's a huge gap between really understanding something

1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:05.440
 and being able to pretend to understand something

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:08.240
 and give the illusion of understanding something.

1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.120
 Do you think it's possible to create without understanding?

1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:12.940
 Yeah.

1:12:12.940 --> 1:12:13.780
 So to.

1:12:13.780 --> 1:12:16.480
 Oh, I do that all the time too, I mean.

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:21.480
 So I use random numbers, but there's still this great gap.

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.920
 I don't assert that it's impossible,

1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:31.920
 but I don't see anything coming any closer

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:36.360
 to really the kind of stuff

1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:38.880
 that I would consider intelligence.

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:41.000
 So you've mentioned something that,

1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:45.480
 on that line of thinking, which I very much agree with,

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:49.520
 so The Art of Computer Programming as the book

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:53.320
 is focused on single processor algorithms,

1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:57.560
 and for the most part, you mentioned.

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:00.840
 That's only because I set the table of contents in 1962,

1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:02.320
 you have to remember.

1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:03.600
 For sure, there's no.

1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:08.040
 I'm glad I didn't wait until 1965 or something.

1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:12.560
 That's, one book, maybe we'll touch on the Bible,

1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:17.040
 but one book can't always cover the entirety of everything.

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:22.040
 So I'm glad the table of contents

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.960
 for The Art of Computer Programming is what it is.

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:29.560
 But you did mention that you thought

1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:31.620
 that an understanding of the way ant colonies

1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:35.000
 are able to perform incredibly organized tasks

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.440
 might well be the key to understanding human cognition.

1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:42.020
 So these fundamentally distributed systems.

1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:43.640
 So what do you think is the difference

1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:47.840
 between the way Don Knuth would sort a list

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:49.760
 and an ant colony would sort a list

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:52.840
 or perform an algorithm?

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:55.840
 Sorting a list isn't the same as cognition, though,

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.560
 but I know what you're getting at is.

1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:02.000
 Well, the advantage of ant colonies,

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.560
 at least we can see what they're doing.

1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:07.600
 We know which ant has talked to which other ant,

1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:12.600
 and it's much harder with the brains

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:17.680
 to know to what extent neurons are passing signal.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:21.680
 So I'm just saying that ant colony might be,

1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:24.020
 if they have the secret of cognition,

1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:29.880
 think of an ant colony as a cognitive single being

1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:32.360
 rather than as a colony of lots of different ants.

1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:36.040
 I mean, just like the cells of our brain

1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:41.040
 and the microbiome and all that is interacting entities,

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:47.920
 but somehow I consider myself to be a single person.

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:51.640
 Well, an ant colony, you can say,

1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:55.480
 might be cognitive somehow.

1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:57.000
 It's some suggestion.

1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000
 Yeah, I mean, okay, I smash a certain ant

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:05.160
 and the organism's saying, hmm, that stung.

1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:06.880
 What was that?

1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:10.640
 But if we're going to crack the secret of cognition,

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:13.020
 it might be that we could do so

1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:16.960
 by psyching out how ants do it

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:19.720
 because we have a better chance to measure

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.300
 their communicating by pheromones

1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:24.080
 and by touching each other in sight,

1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:27.680
 but not by much more subtle phenomenon

1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:30.280
 like electric currents going through.

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:31.860
 But even a simpler version of that,

1:15:31.860 --> 1:15:35.360
 what are your thoughts of maybe Conway's Game of Life?

1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:37.120
 Okay, so Conway's Game of Life

1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:42.120
 is able to simulate any computable process.

1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:46.800
 And any deterministic process is...

1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:48.000
 I like how you went there.

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.000
 I mean, that's not its most powerful thing, I would say.

1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:56.720
 I mean, it can simulate it,

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:00.340
 but the magic is that the individual units

1:16:00.340 --> 1:16:03.760
 are distributed and extremely simple.

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:06.880
 Yes, we understand exactly what the primitives are.

1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:08.720
 The primitives, just like with the ant colony,

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:09.560
 even simpler, though.

1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:13.560
 But still, it doesn't say that I understand life.

1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:21.480
 I mean, it gives me a better insight

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:27.920
 into what does it mean to have a deterministic universe?

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:32.920
 What does it mean to have free choice, for example?

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:37.920
 Do you think God plays dice?

1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:38.880
 Yes.

1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:41.600
 I don't see any reason why God should be forbidden

1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:44.720
 from using the most efficient ways to...

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:52.960
 I mean, we know that dice are extremely important

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:54.760
 in efficient algorithms.

1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:58.120
 There are things that couldn't be done well without randomness.

1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:03.120
 And so, I don't see any reason why God should be prohibited.

1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:06.360
 When the algorithm requires it,

1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:10.080
 you don't see why the physics should constrain it.

1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:15.760
 So, in 2001, you gave a series of lectures at MIT

1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:17.080
 about religion and science.

1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:18.480
 No, that was in 1999.

1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:22.760
 The book came out in 2001.

1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:26.880
 So, in 1999, you spent a little bit of time in Boston

1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:30.640
 enough to give those lectures.

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:35.640
 And I read the 2001 version, most of it.

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:37.360
 It's quite fascinating to read.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.800
 I recommend people, it's a transcription of your lectures.

1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:44.440
 So, what did you learn about how ideas get started

1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:46.920
 and grow from studying the history of the Bible?

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:50.320
 So, you've rigorously studied a very particular part

1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:51.160
 of the Bible.

1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:53.640
 What did you learn from this process

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:56.600
 about the way us human beings as a society

1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:59.640
 develop and grow ideas, share ideas,

1:17:59.640 --> 1:18:01.400
 and are defined by those ideas?

1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:03.960
 Well, it's hard to summarize that.

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:08.440
 I wouldn't say that I learned a great deal

1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:12.120
 of really definite things where I could make conclusions,

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:15.280
 but I learned more about what I don't know.

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:16.720
 You have a complex subject,

1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:21.640
 which is really beyond human understanding.

1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:23.400
 So, we give up on saying,

1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:24.920
 I'm never gonna get to the end of the road

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:26.200
 and I'm never gonna understand it,

1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:29.720
 but you say, but maybe it might be good for me

1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:32.360
 to get closer and closer

1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:34.400
 and learn more and more about something.

1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:39.160
 And so, how can I do that efficiently?

1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:42.920
 And the answer is, well, use randomness.

1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:47.920
 And so, try a random subset

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:52.680
 of that is within my grasp

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:56.960
 and study that in detail,

1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:59.320
 instead of just studying parts

1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:00.960
 that somebody tells me to study,

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:05.400
 or instead of studying nothing because it's too hard.

1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:14.400
 So, I decided, for my own amusement once,

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:17.080
 that I would take a subset

1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:22.080
 of the verses of the Bible

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.480
 and I would try to find out

1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:29.920
 what the best thinkers have said about that small subset.

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:35.000
 And I had about, let's say 60 verses out of 3,000,

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.560
 I think it's one out of 500 or something like this.

1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:39.360
 And so, then I went to the libraries,

1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:41.000
 which are well indexed.

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:48.200
 I spent, for example, at Boston Public Library,

1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:52.200
 I would go once a week for a year

1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:57.200
 and I went, I have done times to Hanover Harvard Library

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:02.360
 to look at this, that weren't in the Boston Public,

1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:07.360
 where scholars had looked and you can go down the shelves

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:12.200
 and you can look in the index and say,

1:20:12.200 --> 1:20:15.400
 oh, is this verse mentioned anywhere in this book?

1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:17.560
 If so, look at page 105.

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:20.520
 So, in other words, I could learn not only about the Bible,

1:20:20.520 --> 1:20:23.480
 but about the secondary literature about the Bible,

1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:25.960
 the things that scholars have written about it.

1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:32.960
 And so, that gave me a way to zoom in on parts of the thing,

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:35.960
 so that I could get more insight.

1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:40.960
 And so, I look at it as a way of giving me some firm pegs,

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.760
 which I could hang pieces of information,

1:20:45.760 --> 1:20:48.960
 but not as things where I would say,

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:50.800
 and therefore, this is true.

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:54.920
 In this random approach of sampling the Bible,

1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:59.920
 what did you learn about the most central,

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:05.440
 one of the biggest accumulation of ideas in our history?

1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:09.840
 It seemed to me that the main thrust was not the one

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:11.640
 that most people think of as saying,

1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:15.000
 oh, don't have sex or something like this,

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:21.000
 but that the main thrust was to try to figure out

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.000
 how to live in harmony with God's wishes.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000
 I'm assuming that God exists,

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:30.000
 and as I say, I'm glad that there's no way to prove this,

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:35.000
 because I would run through the proof once,

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000
 and then I'd forget it,

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:43.000
 and I would never speculate about spiritual things

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.000
 and mysteries otherwise,

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.000
 and I think my life would be very incomplete.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.000
 So, I'm assuming that God exists,

1:21:55.000 --> 1:22:01.000
 but a lot of the people say God doesn't exist,

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000
 but that's still important to them.

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.000
 And so, in a way, that might still be,

1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000
 whether God is there or not,

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:12.000
 in some sense, God is important to them.

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.000
 One of the verses I studied, Doc,

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:19.000
 you can interpret it as saying that it's much better

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:24.000
 to be an atheist than not to care at all.

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:29.000
 So, I would say it's similar to the P equals NP discussion.

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.000
 You mentioned a mental exercise that I'd love it

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.000
 if you could partake in yourself,

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:39.000
 a mental exercise of being God.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000
 So, if you were God, Doc Neuth,

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:45.000
 how would you present yourself to the people of Earth?

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000
 You mentioned your love of literature,

1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:52.000
 and there's this book that really I can recommend to you.

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.000
 Yeah, the title, I think, is Blasphemy.

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000
 It talks about God revealing Himself

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.000
 through a computer in Los Alamos,

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:09.000
 and it's the only book that I've ever read

1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:15.000
 where the punchline was really the very last word of the book

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000
 and explained the whole idea of the book.

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000
 And so, I'd only give that away,

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:27.000
 but it's really very much about this question that you raised.

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:32.000
 But suppose God said, okay,

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.000
 my previous means of communication with the world

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000
 are not the best for the 21st century,

1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000
 so what should I do now?

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:49.000
 And it's conceivable that God would choose

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000
 the way that's described in this book.

1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000
 Another way to look at this exercise

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000
 is looking at the human mind,

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000
 looking at the human spirit, the human life in a systematic way.

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000
 I think mostly you want to learn humility.

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000
 You want to realize that once we solve one problem,

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:09.000
 that doesn't mean that all of a sudden other problems are going to drop out.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:22.000
 And we have to realize that there are things beyond our ability.

1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.000
 I see hubris all around.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000
 Yeah, well said.

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:33.000
 If you were to run program analysis on your own life,

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:39.000
 how did you do in terms of correctness, running time, resource use,

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000
 asymptotically speaking, of course?

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.000
 Okay, yeah, well, I would say

1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:50.000
 that question has not been asked me before.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:25:01.000
 And I started out with library subroutines

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:08.000
 and learning how to be an automaton that was obedient,

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:18.000
 and I had the great advantage that I didn't have anybody to blame for my failures.

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000
 If I started not understanding something,

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:25.000
 I knew that I should stop playing ping pong,

1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:29.000
 and it was my fault that I wasn't studying hard enough or something,

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000
 rather than that somebody was discriminating against me in some way.

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:39.000
 And I don't know how to avoid the existence of biases in the world,

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:46.000
 but I know that that's an extra burden that I didn't have to suffer from.

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:54.000
 And then I found from parents,

1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:02.000
 I learned the idea of service to other people

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:10.000
 as being more important than what I get out of stuff myself.

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:18.000
 I know that I need to be happy enough in order to be able to be of service,

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:25.000
 but I came to a philosophy finally that I phrase as,

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:28.000
 point eight is enough.

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000
 There was a TV show once called Eight is Enough,

1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.000
 which was about somebody had eight kids.

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:43.000
 But I say point eight is enough, which means if I can have a way of rating happiness,

1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:55.000
 I think it's good design to have an organism that's happy about 80% of the time.

1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:01.000
 And if it was 100% of the time, it would be like everybody's on drugs

1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:09.000
 and everything collapses and nothing works because everybody's just too happy.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000
 Do you think you've achieved that point eight optimal balance?

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:22.000
 There are times when I'm down and I know that I've actually been programmed

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.000
 to be depressed a certain amount of time.

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:31.000
 And if that gets out of kilter and I'm more depressed than usual,

1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:36.000
 sometimes I find myself trying to think, now, who should I be mad at today?

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:39.000
 There must be a reason why.

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:45.000
 But then I realize it's just my chemistry telling me that I'm supposed to be mad at somebody,

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.000
 and so I trigger it up and say, okay, go to sleep and get better.

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:58.000
 But if I'm not 100% happy, that doesn't mean that I should find somebody that's screwing me

1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000
 and try to silence them.

1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:14.000
 But I'm saying, okay, I'm not 100% happy, but I'm happy enough to be part of a sustainable situation.

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.000
 So that's kind of the numerical analysis I do.

1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:25.000
 You've converged towards the optimal, which for human life is a point eight.

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.000
 I hope it's okay to talk about, as you talked about previously,

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000
 in 2006 you were diagnosed with prostate cancer.

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:40.000
 Has that encounter with mortality changed you in some way or the way you see the world?

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.000
 Yeah, it did. The first encounter with mortality was when my dad died,

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:59.000
 and I went through a month when I sort of came to be comfortable with the fact that I was going to die someday.

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:09.000
 And during that month, I don't know, I felt okay, but I couldn't sing.

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:14.000
 And I couldn't do original research either.

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:22.000
 I sort of remember after three or four weeks, the first time I started having a technical thought that made sense

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:29.000
 and was maybe slightly creative, I could sort of feel that something was starting to move again.

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:42.000
 So I felt very empty until I came to grips with it. I learned that this is sort of a standard grief process that people go through.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:48.000
 Okay, so then now I'm at a point in my life, even more so than in 2006,

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:54.000
 where all of my goals have been fulfilled except for finishing the art of computer programming.

1:29:54.000 --> 1:30:07.000
 I had one major unfulfilled goal. I'd wanted all my life to write a piece of music,

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:15.000
 and I had an idea for a certain kind of music that I thought ought to be written, at least somebody ought to try to do it.

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:24.000
 And I felt that it wasn't going to be easy, but I wanted proof of concept.

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000
 I wanted to know if it was going to work or not, and so I spent a lot of time.

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:36.000
 And finally, I finished that piece, and we had the world premiere last year on my 80th birthday,

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:42.000
 and we had another premiere in Canada, and there's talk of concerts in Europe and various things.

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:50.000
 But that's done. It's part of the world's music now, and it's either good or bad, but I did what I was hoping to do.

1:30:50.000 --> 1:31:03.000
 So the only thing that I have on my agenda is to try to do as well as I can with the art of computer programming until I go to CINA.

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:07.000
 Do you think there's an element of.8 that might apply there?

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:24.000
.8? Well, I look at it more that I got actually to 1.0 when that concert was over with.

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:38.000
 So in 2006, I was at.8, so when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, then I said, okay, well, I've had all kinds of good luck all my life,

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:45.000
 and I have nothing to complain about, so I might die now, and we'll see what happens.

1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:57.000
 And so quite seriously, I had no expectation that I deserved better.

1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:11.000
 I didn't make any plans for the future. I came out of the surgery and spent some time learning how to walk again and so on.

1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:21.000
 It was painful for a while, but I got home, and I realized I hadn't really thought about what to do next.

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:28.000
 I hadn't any expectation. I said, okay, hey, I'm still alive. Okay, now I can write some more books.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:44.000
 But I didn't come with the attitude that this was terribly unfair, and I just said, okay, I was accepting whatever turned out.

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:58.000
 I'd gotten more than my share already, so why should I?

1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:05.000
 When I got home, I realized that I had really not thought about the next step, what I would do after I would be able to work again.

1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:29.000
 I was comfortable with the fact that it was at the end, but I was hoping that I would still be able to learn about satisfiability and also someday even write music.

1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:34.000
 I didn't start seriously on the music project until 2012.

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:39.000
 So I'm going to be in huge trouble if I don't talk to you about this.

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:49.000
 In the 70s, you've created the tech typesetting system together with MetaFont language for font description and computer modern family of typefaces.

1:33:49.000 --> 1:34:02.000
 That has basically defined the methodology and the aesthetic of countless research fields, math, physics, beyond computer science, so on.

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:05.000
 Okay, well, first of all, thank you.

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:08.000
 I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that.

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:11.000
 But question in terms of beauty.

1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:20.000
 There's a beauty to typography that you've created, and yet beauty is hard to quantify.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:28.000
 How does one create beautiful letters and beautiful equations?

1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:35.000
 Perhaps there's no words to be describing the process.

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:50.000
 So the great Harvard mathematician George D. Burkhoff wrote a book in the 30s called Aesthetic Measure where he would have pictures of vases and underneath would be a number.

1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000
 And this was how beautiful the vase was.

1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000
 And he had a formula for this.

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.000
 And he actually also wrote about music.

1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:14.000
 So I thought maybe part of my musical composition I would try to program his algorithms so that I would write something that had the highest number by his score.

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:19.000
 Well, it wasn't quite rigorous enough for a computer to do.

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:29.000
 But anyway, people have tried to put numerical value on beauty, and he did probably the most serious attempt.

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:38.000
 And George Gershwin's teacher also wrote two volumes where he talked about his method of composing music.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.000
 But you're talking about another kind of beauty and letters and letter phrases.

1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:46.000
 Elegance and whatever that curvature is.

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:53.000
 Right. And so that's in the eye of the beholder, as they say.

1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:02.000
 But striving for excellence in whatever definition you want to give to beauty, then you try to get as close to that as you can somehow.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:13.000
 I guess I'm trying to ask, and there may not be a good answer, what loose definitions were you operating under with the community of people that you were working under?

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:21.000
 Well, the loose definition, I wanted it to appeal to me.

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.000
 To you personally.

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:23.000
 Yeah.

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:24.000
 That's a good start, right?

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:32.000
 Yeah. No, and it failed that test when Volume Two came out with the new printing, and I was expecting it to be the happiest day of my life.

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:48.000
 And I felt like a burning, like how angry I was that I opened the book and it was in the same beige covers, but it didn't look right on the page.

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.000
 The number two was particularly ugly.

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:55.000
 I couldn't stand any page that had a two in its page number.

1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:15.000
 And I was expecting that. I spent all this time making measurements and I had looked at stuff in different ways and I had great technology, but I wasn't done.

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000
 I had to retune the whole thing after 1961.

1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000
 Has it ever made you happy, finally?

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.000
 Oh, yes.

1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.000
 Or is it a 0.8?

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:31.000
 No, and so many books have come out that would never have been written without this.

1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000
 It's just a joy.

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:44.000
 But now, I mean, all these pages that are sitting up there, if I didn't like them, I would change them.

1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000
 Nobody else has this ability.

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000
 They have to stick with what I gave them.

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:59.000
 Yeah. So, in terms of the other side of it, there's the typography, so the look of the type and the curves and the lines.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000
 What about the spacing?

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.000
 What about the?

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.000
 The spacing between the white space.

1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.000
 Yeah.

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.000
 It seems like you could be a little bit more systematic about the layout or technical.

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000
 Oh, yeah. You can always go further.

1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:22.000
 I didn't stop at 0.8, but I stopped at about 0.98.

1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:27.000
 It seems like you're not following your own rule for happiness.

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.000
 No, no, no.

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:53.000
 Of course, there's this, what is the Japanese word, wabi sabi or something, where the most beautiful works of art are those that have flaws because then the person who perceives them adds their own appreciation and that gives the viewer more satisfaction or so on.

1:38:53.000 --> 1:39:11.000
 But no, no, with typography, I wanted it to look as good as I could in the vast majority of cases, and then when it doesn't, then I say, okay, that's 2% more work for the author.

1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:20.000
 But I didn't want to say that my job was to get to 100% and take all the work away from the author.

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000
 That's what I meant by that.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:31.000
 So if you were to venture a guess, how much of the nature of reality do you think we humans understand?

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.000
 You mentioned you appreciate mystery.

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.000
 How much of the world about us is shrouded in mystery?

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:45.000
 If you were to put a number on it, what percent of it all do we understand?

1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000
 How many leading zeros, 0.00?

1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:50.000
 I don't know.

1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000
 I think it's infinitesimal.

1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:55.000
 How do we think about that and what do we do about that?

1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000
 Do we continue one step at a time?

1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:58.000
 Yeah, we muddle through.

1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:01.000
 I mean, we do our best.

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:14.000
 We realize that nobody's perfect and we try to keep advancing, but we don't spend time saying we're not there, we're not all the way to the end.

1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:25.000
 Some mathematicians that would be in the office next to me when I was in the math department, they would never think about anything smaller than countable infinity.

1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.000
 We intersected that countable infinity because I rarely got up to countable infinity.

1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000
 I was always talking about finite stuff.

1:40:33.000 --> 1:41:02.000
 But even limiting to finite stuff, which the universe might be, there's no way to really know whether the universe isn't just made out of capital N, whatever units you want to call them, quarks or whatever, where capital N is some finite number.

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:08.000
 All of the numbers that are comprehensible are still way smaller than almost all finite numbers.

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:19.000
 I got this one paper called Supernatural Numbers where I guess you probably ran into something called Knuth arrow notation.

1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.000
 Did you ever run into that?

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:36.000
 Anyway, so you take the number, I think it's like, and I called it Super K, I named it after myself, but arrow notation is something like 10 and then four arrows and a three or something like that.

1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:42.000
 Now, the arrow notation, if you have no arrows, that means multiplication.

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:47.000
 X, Y means X times X times X times X, Y times.

1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000
 If you have one arrow, that means exponentiation.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:56.000
 So X one arrow Y means X to the X to the X to the X Y times.

1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:15.000
 So I found out, by the way, that this notation was invented by a guy in 1830 and he was one of the English nobility who spent his time thinking about stuff like this.

1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:23.000
 And it was exactly the same concept that I used arrows and he used a slightly different notation.

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:31.000
 But anyway, and then this Ackermann's function is based on the same kind of ideas, but Ackermann was 1920s.

1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:47.000
 But anyway, you've got this number 10 quadruple arrow three. So that says, well, we take 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10th and how many times do we do that?

1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:52.000
 Oh, 10 double arrow two times or something. I mean, how tall is that stack?

1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:58.000
 But then we do that again because that was only 10 quadruple arrow two.

1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.000
 It gets to be a pretty large number.

1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:05.000
 It gets way beyond comprehension.

1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:18.000
 But it's so small compared to what finite numbers really are because I'm only using four arrows and 10 and a three.

1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:22.000
 I mean, let's have that many number arrows.

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:29.000
 The boundary between infinite and finite is incomprehensible for us humans anyway.

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:38.000
 Infinity is a useful way for us to think about extremely large things.

1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:51.000
 And we can manipulate it, but we can never know that the universe is actually anywhere near that.

1:43:51.000 --> 1:44:02.000
 So I realize how little we know.

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:14.000
 But we found an awful lot of things that are too hard for any one person to know, even in our small universe.

1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000
 Yeah, and we did pretty good.

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:30.000
 So when you go up to heaven and meet God and get to ask one question that would get answered, what question would you ask?

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:35.000
 What kind of browser do you have up here?

1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:49.000
 No, actually, I don't think it's meaningful to ask this question, but I certainly hope we had good internet.

1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.000
 Okay, on that note, that's beautiful actually.

1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:54.000
 Don, thank you so much.

1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:55.000
 It was a huge honor to talk to you.

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000
 I really appreciate it.

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.000
 Well, thanks for the gamut of questions.

1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:00.000
 Yeah, it was fun.
