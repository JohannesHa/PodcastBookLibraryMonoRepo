00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
 The following is a conversation with Lee Smolin.

00:02.880 --> 00:04.520
 He's a theoretical physicist,

00:04.520 --> 00:06.680
 co inventor of loop quantum gravity,

00:06.680 --> 00:08.860
 and a contributor of many interesting ideas

00:08.860 --> 00:11.320
 to cosmology, quantum field theory,

00:11.320 --> 00:12.960
 the foundations of quantum mechanics,

00:12.960 --> 00:16.360
 theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.180
 He's the author of several books,

00:18.180 --> 00:21.000
 including one that critiques the state of physics

00:21.000 --> 00:24.080
 and string theory called The Trouble with Physics.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.100
 And his latest book, Einstein's Unfinished Revolution,

00:27.100 --> 00:30.240
 The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.880
 He's an outspoken personality in the public debates

00:32.880 --> 00:34.600
 on the nature of our universe,

00:34.600 --> 00:38.240
 among the top minds in the theoretical physics community.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.000
 This community has its respected academics,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.440
 its naked emperors, its outcasts and its revolutionaries,

00:44.440 --> 00:46.900
 its madmen and its dreamers.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.560
 This is why it's an exciting world to explore

00:49.560 --> 00:51.800
 through a long form conversation.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.800
 I recommend you listen back to the episodes

00:53.800 --> 00:57.200
 with Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Michio Okaku,

00:57.200 --> 01:01.200
 Max Tegmark, Eric Weinstein, and Jim Gates.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.860
 You might be asking, why talk to physicists

01:03.860 --> 01:05.320
 if you're interested in AI?

01:06.160 --> 01:08.800
 To me, creating artificial intelligence systems

01:08.800 --> 01:11.400
 requires more than Python and deep learning.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.360
 It requires that we return to exploring

01:13.360 --> 01:18.360
 the fundamental nature of the universe and the human mind.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.200
 Theoretical physicists venture out into the dark,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.560
 mysterious, psychologically challenging place

01:23.560 --> 01:27.160
 of first principles more than almost any other discipline.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.880
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.160
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:33.160 --> 01:34.960
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:34.960 --> 01:38.280
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:38.280 --> 01:41.480
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.320
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

01:45.320 --> 01:46.640
 and never any ads in the middle

01:46.640 --> 01:48.880
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.200
 I hope that works for you

01:50.200 --> 01:52.520
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.480
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.760
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.200
 When you get it, use code LEXBODCAST.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.400
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

02:02.400 --> 02:04.840
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

02:04.840 --> 02:06.760
 with as little as one dollar.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.120
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

02:09.120 --> 02:11.360
 let me mention that cryptocurrency

02:11.360 --> 02:14.640
 in the context of the history of money is fascinating.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.440
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.120
 Debits and credits on ledgers

02:20.120 --> 02:23.320
 started around 30,000 years ago.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.000
 The US dollar, of course, created over 200 years ago,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.240
 and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,

02:30.240 --> 02:32.880
 was released just over 10 years ago.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.880
 So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much

02:35.880 --> 02:37.920
 in its early days of development,

02:37.920 --> 02:39.560
 but it still is aiming to

02:39.560 --> 02:43.040
 and just might redefine the nature of money.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.360
 If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

02:45.360 --> 02:49.080
 and use the code LEXBODCAST, you'll get $10,

02:49.080 --> 02:51.920
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

02:51.920 --> 02:53.720
 one of my favorite organizations

02:53.720 --> 02:56.880
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education

02:56.880 --> 02:58.880
 for young people around the world.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.240
 And now, here's my conversation with Lee Smolin.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.280
 What is real?

03:05.120 --> 03:06.440
 Let's start with an easy question.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.160
 Put another way, how do we know what is real

03:09.160 --> 03:10.680
 and what is merely a creation

03:10.680 --> 03:14.240
 of our human perception and imagination?

03:14.240 --> 03:15.640
 We don't know.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.480
 We don't know.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.320
 This is science.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.960
 I presume we're talking about science.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.280
 And we believe, or I believe,

03:24.320 --> 03:28.520
 that there is a world that is independent of my existence

03:28.520 --> 03:32.520
 and my experience about it and my knowledge of it,

03:32.520 --> 03:34.840
 and this I call the real world.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.120
 So you said science, but even bigger than science, what?

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
 Sure, sure.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.400
 I need not have said this is science.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.840
 I just was warming up.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.480
 Warming up?

03:46.480 --> 03:47.800
 Okay, now that we're warmed up,

03:47.800 --> 03:51.040
 let's take a brief step outside of science.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.400
 Is it completely a crazy idea to you

03:54.400 --> 03:57.480
 that everything that exists is merely a creation

03:57.480 --> 03:58.800
 of our mind?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.880
 So there's a few, not many.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.200
 This is outside of science now.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.520
 People who believe sort of perception

04:06.520 --> 04:10.000
 is fundamentally what's in our human perception,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.720
 the visual cortex and so on,

04:11.720 --> 04:16.240
 the cognitive constructs that's being formed there

04:16.240 --> 04:18.040
 is the reality.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.320
 And then anything outside is something

04:20.320 --> 04:22.480
 that we can never really grasp.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.080
 Is that a crazy idea to you?

04:24.080 --> 04:27.760
 There's a version of that that is not crazy at all.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.360
 What we experience is constructed by our brains

04:33.200 --> 04:36.200
 and by our brains in an active mode.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.920
 So we don't see the raw world.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.800
 We see a very processed world.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.480
 We feel something that's very processed through our brains

04:47.480 --> 04:49.160
 and our brains are incredible.

04:50.120 --> 04:55.120
 But I still believe that behind that experience,

04:55.720 --> 04:59.400
 that mirror or veil or whatever you wanna call it,

04:59.400 --> 05:02.520
 there is a real world and I'm curious about it.

05:02.520 --> 05:06.720
 Can we truly, how do we get a sense of that real world?

05:06.720 --> 05:08.600
 Is it through the tools of physics,

05:08.600 --> 05:11.400
 from theory to the experiments?

05:11.400 --> 05:15.320
 Or can we actually grasp it in some intuitive way

05:15.320 --> 05:20.320
 that's more connected to our ape ancestors?

05:21.240 --> 05:25.160
 Or is it still fundamentally the tools of math and physics

05:25.160 --> 05:26.440
 that really allow us to grasp it?

05:26.440 --> 05:29.040
 Well, let's talk about what tools they are.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.040
 What you say are the tools of math and physics.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.480
 I mean, I think we're in the same position

05:34.480 --> 05:37.880
 as our ancestors in the caves

05:37.880 --> 05:40.160
 or before the caves or whatever.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.320
 We find ourselves in this world and we're curious.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.920
 We also, it's important to be able to explain

05:47.920 --> 05:50.800
 what happens when there are fires, when there are not fires,

05:50.800 --> 05:55.000
 what animals and plants are good to eat and all that stuff.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.640
 But we're also just curious.

05:57.640 --> 06:01.480
 We look up in the sky and we see the sun and the moon

06:01.480 --> 06:03.960
 and the stars and we see some of those move

06:03.960 --> 06:07.160
 and we're very curious about that.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.840
 And I think we're just naturally curious.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.840
 So we make, this is my version of how we work.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.040
 We make up stories and explanations.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.080
 And where there are two things

06:24.080 --> 06:27.560
 which I think are just true of being human,

06:27.560 --> 06:31.040
 we make judgments fast because we have to.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.040
 Where to survive, is that a tiger or is that not a tiger?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.400
 And we go.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
 Act.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.120
 We have to act fast on incomplete information.

06:41.120 --> 06:46.000
 So we judge quickly and we're often wrong

06:46.000 --> 06:49.120
 or at least sometimes wrong, which is all I need for this.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.520
 We're often wrong.

06:50.520 --> 06:55.520
 So we fool ourselves and we fool other people readily.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.880
 And so there's lots of stories that get told

06:59.880 --> 07:04.280
 and some of them result in a concrete benefit

07:04.280 --> 07:06.880
 and some of them don't.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.360
 So you said we're often wrong,

07:09.360 --> 07:12.440
 but what does it mean to be right?

07:12.440 --> 07:15.960
 Right, that's an excellent question.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.960
 To be right, well since I believe that there is a real world,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.280
 I believe that to be, you can challenge me on this

07:26.280 --> 07:27.480
 if you're not a realist.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.960
 A realist is somebody who believes

07:28.960 --> 07:31.240
 in this real objective world

07:31.240 --> 07:33.040
 which is independent of our perception.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.640
 If I'm a realist, I think that to be right

07:38.680 --> 07:40.200
 is to come closer.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
 I think first of all, there's a relative scale.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.480
 There's not right and wrong.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.920
 There's right or more right and less right.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.080
 And you're more right if you come closer

07:49.080 --> 07:53.040
 to an exact true description of that real world.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.800
 Now can we know that for sure?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.040
 No.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.880
 And the scientific method is ultimately

07:58.880 --> 08:00.640
 what allows us to get a sense

08:00.640 --> 08:03.000
 of how close we're getting to that real world?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.120
 No on two counts.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.920
 First of all, I don't believe there's a scientific method.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.680
 I was very influenced when I was in graduate school

08:10.680 --> 08:12.760
 by the writings of Paul Fireman

08:12.760 --> 08:15.720
 who was an important philosopher of science

08:15.720 --> 08:18.280
 who argued that there isn't a scientific method.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.840
 There is or there is not?

08:19.840 --> 08:20.920
 There is not.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.760
 Can you elaborate, I'm sorry if you were going to,

08:23.760 --> 08:27.040
 but can you elaborate on what does it mean

08:27.040 --> 08:28.800
 for there not to be a scientific method,

08:28.800 --> 08:33.080
 this notion that I think a lot of people believe in

08:33.080 --> 08:34.840
 in this day and age?

08:34.840 --> 08:36.080
 Sure.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.760
 Paul Fireman, he was a student of Popper

08:39.760 --> 08:42.320
 who taught Karl Popper.

08:42.320 --> 08:47.320
 And Fireman argued both by logic

08:48.400 --> 08:51.400
 and by historical example that you name anything

08:51.400 --> 08:55.040
 that should be part of the practice of science.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.440
 Say you should always make sure that your theories agree

08:57.440 --> 09:01.200
 with all the data that's already been taken.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.600
 And he'll prove to you that there have to be times

09:03.600 --> 09:08.120
 when science contradicts, when some scientist contradicts

09:08.120 --> 09:13.120
 that advice for science to progress overall.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.240
 So it's not a simple matter.

09:18.240 --> 09:23.240
 I think that, I think of science as a community.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.160
 Of people.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.120
 Of people and as a community of people

09:29.120 --> 09:33.080
 bound by certain ethical precepts,

09:33.080 --> 09:35.000
 precepts, whatever that is.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
 So in that community, a set of ideas they operate under,

09:40.520 --> 09:44.360
 meaning ethically of kind of the rules of the game

09:44.360 --> 09:45.460
 they operate under.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.000
 Don't lie, report all your results,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
 whether they agree or don't agree with your hypothesis.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.000
 Check the training of a scientist.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.320
 Mostly consists of methods of checking

09:59.320 --> 10:01.460
 because again, we make lots of mistakes.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.680
 We're very error prone.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.680
 But there are tools both on the mathematics side

10:06.680 --> 10:09.380
 and the experimental side to check and double check

10:09.380 --> 10:11.000
 and triple check.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.400
 And a scientist goes through a training

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
 and I think this is part of it.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.280
 You can't just walk off the street and say,

10:18.280 --> 10:20.640
 yo, I'm a scientist.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.280
 You have to go through the training

10:22.280 --> 10:27.280
 and the training, the test that lets you be done

10:27.560 --> 10:32.560
 with the training is can you form a convincing case

10:33.360 --> 10:37.800
 for something that your colleagues

10:37.800 --> 10:40.560
 will not be able to shout down

10:40.560 --> 10:42.520
 because they'll ask, did you check this?

10:42.520 --> 10:43.400
 And did you check that?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.240
 And did you check this?

10:44.240 --> 10:47.720
 And what about seeming contradiction with this?

10:47.720 --> 10:52.240
 And you've got to have answers to all those things

10:52.240 --> 10:53.800
 or you don't get taken seriously.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.560
 And when you get to the point where you can produce

10:56.560 --> 10:58.960
 that kind of defense and argument,

10:58.960 --> 11:00.500
 then they give you a PhD.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.920
 And you're kind of licensed.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.000
 You're still gonna be questioned

11:06.000 --> 11:10.640
 and you still may propose or publish mistakes.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.480
 But the community is gonna have to waste less time

11:14.480 --> 11:15.840
 fixing your mistakes.

11:15.840 --> 11:20.240
 Yes, but if you can maybe linger on it a little longer,

11:20.240 --> 11:25.240
 what's the gap between the thing that that community does

11:25.240 --> 11:27.640
 and the ideal of the scientific method?

11:28.800 --> 11:31.840
 The scientific method is you should be able

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
 to repeat and experiment.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.400
 There's a lot of elements to what construes

11:39.400 --> 11:41.960
 the scientific method, but the final result,

11:41.960 --> 11:46.720
 the hope of it is that you should be able to say

11:46.720 --> 11:50.160
 with some confidence that a particular thing

11:50.160 --> 11:53.040
 is close to the truth.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.440
 Right, but there's not a simple relationship

11:55.440 --> 11:58.600
 between experiment and hypothesis or theory.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.120
 For example, Galileo did this experiment

12:01.120 --> 12:04.440
 of dropping a ball from the top of a tower

12:04.440 --> 12:06.880
 and it falls right at the base of the tower.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.480
 And an Aristotelian would say, wow,

12:10.480 --> 12:12.760
 of course it falls right to the base of the tower.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.400
 That shows that the earth isn't moving

12:14.400 --> 12:16.720
 while the ball is falling.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.760
 And Galileo says, no way, there's a principle of inertia

12:19.760 --> 12:22.280
 and it has an inertia in the direction

12:22.280 --> 12:24.360
 where the earth isn't moving and the tower

12:24.360 --> 12:26.840
 and the ball and the earth all move together.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.080
 When the principle of inertia tells you it hits the bottom,

12:30.080 --> 12:33.000
 it does look, therefore my principle of inertia is right.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.280
 And Aristotelian says, no, our style of science is right.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.400
 The earth is stationary.

12:39.400 --> 12:44.400
 And so you gotta get an interconnected bunch of cases

12:45.600 --> 12:49.200
 and work hard to line up and explain.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.840
 It took centuries to make the transition

12:51.840 --> 12:55.880
 from Aristotelian physics to the new physics.

12:55.880 --> 13:00.880
 It wasn't done until Newton in 1680 something, 1687.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.960
 So what do you think is the nature of the process

13:04.960 --> 13:07.960
 that seems to lead to progress?

13:07.960 --> 13:11.120
 If we at least look at the long arc of science,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.360
 of all the community of scientists,

13:13.360 --> 13:16.960
 they seem to do a better job of coming up with ideas

13:16.960 --> 13:21.120
 that engineers can then take on and build rockets with

13:21.120 --> 13:26.120
 or build computers with or build cool stuff with.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.600
 I don't know, a better job than what?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.480
 Than this previous century.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.800
 So century by century, we'll talk about string theory

13:35.800 --> 13:38.040
 and so on and kind of possible,

13:38.040 --> 13:41.040
 what you might think of as dead ends and so on.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.680
 Which is not the way I think of string theory.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.840
 We'll straighten out, we'll get all the strings straight.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.640
 But there is, nevertheless in science, very often,

13:49.640 --> 13:52.040
 at least temporary dead ends.

13:52.040 --> 13:57.040
 But if you look at the, through centuries,

13:57.760 --> 14:01.120
 the century before Newton and the century after Newton,

14:01.120 --> 14:06.120
 it seems like a lot of ideas came closer to the truth

14:07.080 --> 14:10.280
 that then could be usable by our civilization

14:10.280 --> 14:12.940
 to build the iPhone, right?

14:12.940 --> 14:15.900
 To build cool things that improve our quality of life.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.480
 That's the progress I'm kind of referring to.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.440
 Let me, can I say that more precisely?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.840
 Yes, well, it's a low bar.

14:23.840 --> 14:28.840
 Because I think it's important to get the time places right.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.840
 There was a scientific revolution that partly succeeded

14:34.640 --> 14:39.520
 between about 1900 or late 1890s

14:39.520 --> 14:44.520
 and into the 1930s, 1940s and so.

14:45.440 --> 14:50.280
 And maybe some, if you stretched it, into the 1970s.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.520
 And the technology, this was the discovery of relativity

14:54.520 --> 14:58.320
 and that included a lot of developments of electromagnetism.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.600
 The confirmation, which wasn't really well confirmed

15:02.600 --> 15:06.560
 into the 20th century, that matter was made of atoms.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.880
 And the whole picture of nuclei with electrons going around,

15:09.880 --> 15:12.520
 this is early 20th century.

15:12.520 --> 15:17.520
 And then quantum mechanics was from 1905,

15:17.840 --> 15:21.760
 took a long time to develop, to the late 1920s.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.280
 And then it was basically in final form.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.440
 And the basis of this partial revolution,

15:29.440 --> 15:32.280
 and we can come back to why it's only a partial revolution,

15:33.440 --> 15:36.240
 is the basis of the technologies that you mentioned.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.840
 All of, I mean, electrical technology

15:40.840 --> 15:42.880
 was being developed slowly with this.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.000
 And in fact, there's a close relation

15:46.000 --> 15:49.560
 between the development of electricity

15:49.560 --> 15:54.120
 and the electrification of cities in the United States

15:54.120 --> 15:55.640
 and Europe and so forth.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.280
 And the development of the science.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.800
 The fundamental physics since the early 1970s

16:08.520 --> 16:11.200
 doesn't have a story like that so far.

16:11.200 --> 16:16.200
 There's not a series of triumphs and progresses

16:16.560 --> 16:19.760
 and there's not any practical application.

16:19.760 --> 16:24.760
 So just to linger briefly on the early 20th century

16:26.520 --> 16:29.000
 and the revolutions in science that happened there,

16:30.320 --> 16:33.960
 what was the method by which the scientific community

16:33.960 --> 16:38.960
 kept each other in check about when you get something right,

16:39.040 --> 16:40.120
 when you get something wrong?

16:40.120 --> 16:43.600
 Is experimental validation ultimately the final test?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.320
 It's absolutely necessary.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.600
 And the key things were all validated.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.920
 The key predictions of quantum mechanics

16:50.920 --> 16:53.280
 and of the theory of electricity and magnetism.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.800
 So before we talk about Einstein, your new book,

16:57.800 --> 17:00.720
 before String Theory, Quantum Mechanics, so on,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.040
 let's take a step back at a higher level question.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.880
 What is that you mentioned?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.360
 What is realism?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.600
 What is anti realism?

17:11.600 --> 17:13.840
 And maybe why do you find realism,

17:13.840 --> 17:15.680
 as you mentioned, so compelling?

17:15.680 --> 17:20.680
 Well, realism is the belief in an external world

17:26.000 --> 17:28.680
 independent of our existence, our perception,

17:28.680 --> 17:30.720
 our belief, our knowledge.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.520
 A realist as a physicist is somebody who believes

17:35.520 --> 17:40.520
 that there should be possible some completely objective

17:40.640 --> 17:44.760
 description of each and every process

17:44.760 --> 17:49.400
 at the fundamental level, which describes and explains

17:49.400 --> 17:52.800
 exactly what happens and why it happens.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.680
 That kind of implies that that system,

17:55.680 --> 17:58.280
 in a realist view, is deterministic,

17:58.280 --> 18:01.120
 meaning there's no fuzzy magic going on

18:01.120 --> 18:02.280
 that you can never get to the bottom,

18:02.280 --> 18:04.280
 or you can get to the bottom of anything

18:04.280 --> 18:06.240
 and perfectly describe it.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.720
 Some people would say that I'm not that interested

18:10.720 --> 18:15.560
 in determinism, but I could live with the fundamental world,

18:15.560 --> 18:18.560
 which had some chance in it.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.760
 So do you, you said you could live with it,

18:21.760 --> 18:26.520
 but do you think God plays dice in our universe?

18:26.520 --> 18:28.720
 I think it's probably much worse than that.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.080
 In which direction?

18:32.080 --> 18:33.920
 I think that theories can change,

18:33.920 --> 18:36.120
 and theories can change without warning.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.520
 I think the future is open.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.920
 You mean the fundamental laws of physics can change?

18:40.920 --> 18:42.440
 Yeah.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.800
 Oh, okay, we'll get there.

18:43.800 --> 18:48.800
 I thought we would be able to find some solid ground,

18:49.720 --> 18:54.720
 but apparently the entirety of it, temporarily so, probably.

18:55.160 --> 19:00.160
 Okay, so realism is the idea that while the ground

19:00.760 --> 19:02.920
 is solid, you can describe it.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.680
 What's the role of the human being,

19:04.680 --> 19:09.680
 our beautiful, complex human mind in realism?

19:10.480 --> 19:14.760
 Do we have a, are we just another set of molecules

19:14.760 --> 19:16.480
 connected together in a clever way,

19:16.480 --> 19:21.480
 or the observer, does the observer, our human mind,

19:22.120 --> 19:24.760
 consciousness, have a role in this realism view

19:24.760 --> 19:26.360
 of the physical universe?

19:27.200 --> 19:30.400
 There's two ways, there's two questions you could be asking.

19:30.400 --> 19:35.400
 One, does our conscious mind, do our perceptions

19:35.680 --> 19:38.800
 play a role in making things become,

19:38.800 --> 19:42.280
 in making things real or things becoming?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.320
 That's question one.

19:43.320 --> 19:47.400
 Question two is, does this, we can call it

19:47.400 --> 19:52.400
 a naturalist view of the world that is based on realism,

19:54.720 --> 19:58.080
 allow a place to understand the existence of

19:58.080 --> 20:01.760
 and the nature of perceptions and consciousness in mind,

20:01.760 --> 20:03.240
 and that's question two.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.640
 Question two, I do think a lot about,

20:06.640 --> 20:11.120
 and my answer, which is not an answer, is I hope so,

20:11.120 --> 20:12.680
 but it certainly doesn't yet.

20:14.000 --> 20:14.840
 So what kind?

20:14.840 --> 20:17.000
 Question one, I don't think so.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.720
 But of course, the answer to question one

20:18.720 --> 20:20.120
 depends on question two.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.760
 Right.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.040
 So I'm not up to question one yet.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.160
 So question two is the thing that you can kind of

20:26.160 --> 20:27.720
 struggle with at this time.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.560
 Yes.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.120
 That's, what about the anti realists?

20:32.120 --> 20:36.280
 So what flavor, what are the different camps

20:36.280 --> 20:38.440
 of anti realists that you've talked about?

20:38.440 --> 20:41.000
 I think it would be nice if you can articulate

20:42.480 --> 20:44.160
 for the people for whom there is not

20:44.160 --> 20:47.520
 a very concrete real world, or there's divisions,

20:47.520 --> 20:52.280
 or it's messier than the realist view of the universe,

20:52.280 --> 20:54.680
 what are the different camps, what are the different views?

20:54.680 --> 20:58.160
 I'm not sure I'm a good scholar and can talk about

20:58.160 --> 20:59.960
 the different camps and analyze it,

20:59.960 --> 21:04.560
 but some, many of the inventors of quantum physics

21:04.560 --> 21:07.600
 were not realists, were anti realists.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.000
 Their scholars, they lived in a very perilous time

21:11.000 --> 21:12.840
 between the two world wars.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.480
 And there were a lot of trends in culture

21:17.480 --> 21:19.240
 which were going that way.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.960
 But in any case, they said things like,

21:21.960 --> 21:26.960
 the purpose of science is not to give an objective

21:27.360 --> 21:29.360
 realist description of nature as it would be

21:29.360 --> 21:30.680
 in our absence.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.040
 This might be saying Niels Bohr.

21:33.040 --> 21:36.320
 The purpose of science is as an extension

21:36.320 --> 21:38.760
 of our conversations with each other

21:38.760 --> 21:41.280
 to describe our interactions with nature.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.640
 And we're free to invent and use terms like

21:44.640 --> 21:48.760
 particle, or wave, or causality, or time, or space.

21:48.760 --> 21:53.760
 If they're useful to us, and they carry some

21:53.960 --> 21:58.000
 intuitive implication, but we shouldn't believe

21:58.000 --> 22:00.280
 that they actually have to do with what nature

22:00.280 --> 22:02.520
 would be like in our absence,

22:02.520 --> 22:04.600
 which we have nothing to say about.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.120
 Do you find any aspect of that,

22:08.120 --> 22:10.400
 because you kind of said that we human beings

22:10.400 --> 22:13.920
 tell stories, do you find aspects of that

22:13.920 --> 22:18.800
 kind of anti realist view of Niels Bohr compelling?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.960
 That we fundamentally are storytellers,

22:20.960 --> 22:24.520
 and then we create tools of space, and time,

22:24.520 --> 22:28.520
 and causality, and whatever this fun quantum

22:28.520 --> 22:32.800
 mechanic stuff is to help us tell the story of our world.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.560
 Sure, I just would like to believe that there's

22:35.560 --> 22:38.480
 an aspiration for the other thing.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.400
 The other thing being what?

22:41.400 --> 22:44.000
 The realist point of view.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.320
 Do you hope that the stories will eventually lead us

22:47.320 --> 22:52.320
 to discovering the real world as it is?

22:56.560 --> 22:57.560
 Yeah.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.200
 Is perfection possible, by the way?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.680
 Is it? No.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.880
 Well that's, you mean will we ever get there

23:03.880 --> 23:05.200
 and know that we're there?

23:05.200 --> 23:06.480
 Yeah, exactly.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.800
 That's not my, that's for people 5,000 years in the future.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.760
 We're certainly nowhere near there yet.

23:14.240 --> 23:19.240
 Do you think reality that exists outside of our mind,

23:20.720 --> 23:24.680
 do you think there's a limit to our cognitive abilities?

23:24.680 --> 23:26.840
 Is, again, descendants of apes,

23:26.840 --> 23:28.840
 who are just biological systems,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.800
 is there a limit to our mind's capability

23:31.800 --> 23:34.780
 to actually understand reality?

23:35.880 --> 23:39.200
 Sort of, there comes a point,

23:39.200 --> 23:42.360
 even with the help of the tools of physics,

23:42.360 --> 23:46.440
 that we just cannot grasp some fundamental aspects

23:46.440 --> 23:47.280
 of that reality.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.240
 Again, I think that's a question

23:48.240 --> 23:49.840
 for 5,000 years in the future.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.160
 We're not even close to that limit.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.240
 I think there is a universality.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.920
 Here, I don't agree with David Deutsch about everything,

23:56.920 --> 24:01.280
 but I admire the way he put things in his last book.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.600
 And he talked about the role of explanation.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.880
 And he talked about the universality of certain languages

24:08.880 --> 24:11.040
 or the universality of mathematics

24:11.040 --> 24:15.760
 or of computing and so forth.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.400
 And he believed that universality,

24:18.400 --> 24:19.360
 which is something real,

24:19.360 --> 24:22.880
 which somehow comes out of the fact

24:22.880 --> 24:26.160
 that a symbolic system or a mathematical system

24:26.160 --> 24:29.040
 can refer to itself and can,

24:29.040 --> 24:30.160
 I forget what that's called,

24:30.160 --> 24:34.360
 can reference back to itself and build,

24:34.360 --> 24:38.320
 in which he argued for a universality of possibility

24:38.320 --> 24:41.360
 for our understanding, whatever is out there.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.280
 But I admire that argument,

24:45.280 --> 24:50.280
 but it seems to me we're doing okay so far,

24:51.040 --> 24:53.840
 but we'll have to see.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.160
 Whether there is a limit or not.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.240
 For now, we've got plenty to play with.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.320
 Yeah.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.760
 There are things which are right there in front of us

25:01.760 --> 25:03.640
 which we miss.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.840
 And I'll quote my friend, Eric Weinstein,

25:06.840 --> 25:10.520
 in saying, look, Einstein carried his luggage.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.040
 Freud carried his luggage.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.400
 Marx carried his luggage.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.000
 Martha Graham carried her luggage, et cetera.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.240
 Edison carried his luggage.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.000
 All these geniuses carried their luggage.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.640
 And not once before relatively recently

25:25.640 --> 25:28.160
 did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage

25:28.160 --> 25:29.000
 and pull it.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.040
 And it was right there waiting to be invented

25:33.040 --> 25:34.600
 for centuries.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.960
 So this is Eric Weinstein.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.040
 Yeah.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.520
 What do the wheels represent?

25:40.520 --> 25:42.200
 Are you basically saying that there's stuff

25:42.200 --> 25:43.760
 right in front of our eyes?

25:43.760 --> 25:46.200
 That once we, it just clicks,

25:46.200 --> 25:48.240
 we put the wheels on the luggage,

25:48.240 --> 25:49.880
 a lot of things will fall into place.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.440
 Yes, I do, I do.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.120
 And every day I wake up and think,

25:55.120 --> 25:58.560
 why can't I be that guy who was walking through the airport?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.840
 What do you think it takes to be that guy?

26:02.840 --> 26:05.760
 Because like you said,

26:05.760 --> 26:08.560
 a lot of really smart people carried their luggage.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.440
 What, just psychologically speaking,

26:12.440 --> 26:14.560
 so Eric Weinstein is a good example of a person

26:14.560 --> 26:16.120
 who thinks outside the box.

26:16.120 --> 26:16.960
 Yes.

26:16.960 --> 26:21.040
 Who resists almost conventional thinking.

26:21.040 --> 26:25.480
 You're an example of a person who by habit,

26:25.480 --> 26:28.880
 by psychology, by upbringing, I don't know,

26:28.880 --> 26:31.160
 but resists conventional thinking as well,

26:31.160 --> 26:32.000
 just by nature.

26:32.000 --> 26:32.920
 Thank you, that's a compliment.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.080
 That's a compliment?

26:34.080 --> 26:34.920
 Good.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.240
 So what do you think it takes to do that?

26:37.240 --> 26:39.280
 Is that something you were just born with?

26:40.880 --> 26:42.040
 I doubt it.

26:42.040 --> 26:47.040
 Well, from my studying some cases,

26:47.040 --> 26:49.840
 because I'm curious about that, obviously,

26:49.840 --> 26:52.520
 and just in a more concrete way,

26:52.520 --> 26:54.400
 when I started out in physics,

26:54.400 --> 26:57.880
 because I started a long way from physics,

26:57.880 --> 27:00.800
 so it took me a long, not a long time,

27:00.800 --> 27:04.280
 but a lot of work to get to study it and get into it,

27:04.280 --> 27:05.880
 so I did wonder about that.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.400
 And so I read the biographies,

27:10.400 --> 27:12.960
 and in fact, I started with the autobiography of Einstein

27:12.960 --> 27:17.960
 and Newton and Galileo and all those people.

27:18.520 --> 27:22.760
 And I think there's a couple of things.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.920
 Some of it is luck, being in the right place

27:24.920 --> 27:26.320
 at the right time.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.800
 Some of it is stubbornness and arrogance,

27:28.800 --> 27:30.440
 which can easily go wrong.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.960
 Yes.

27:31.960 --> 27:36.280
 And I know all of these are doorways.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.960
 If you go through them slightly at the wrong speed

27:38.960 --> 27:43.960
 or in the wrong angle, they're ways to fail.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.640
 But if you somehow have the right luck,

27:47.640 --> 27:52.040
 the right confidence or arrogance, caring,

27:52.040 --> 27:56.000
 I think Einstein cared to understand nature

27:56.000 --> 28:00.960
 with ferocity and a commitment that exceeded

28:00.960 --> 28:02.240
 other people of his time.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.080
 So he asked more stubborn questions.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.120
 He asked deeper questions.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.960
 I think, and there's a level of ability

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
 and whether ability is born in or can be developed

28:20.120 --> 28:21.720
 to the extent to which it can be developed,

28:21.720 --> 28:24.480
 like any of these things like musical talent.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.040
 So you mentioned ego.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.000
 What's the role of ego in that process?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.040
 Confidence.

28:30.040 --> 28:30.880
 Confidence.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.680
 But in your own life, have you found yourself

28:34.680 --> 28:38.920
 walking that nice edge of too much or too little,

28:38.920 --> 28:41.000
 so being overconfident and therefore

28:41.000 --> 28:43.960
 leaning yourself astray or not sufficiently confident

28:43.960 --> 28:47.000
 to throw away the conventional thinking

28:47.000 --> 28:50.540
 of whatever the theory of the day, of theoretical physics?

28:51.480 --> 28:54.240
 I don't know if I, I mean, I've contributed

28:54.240 --> 28:57.360
 where I've contributed, whether if I had had

28:57.360 --> 29:01.360
 more confidence in something, I would have gotten further.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.200
 I don't know.

29:03.960 --> 29:08.960
 Certainly, I'm sitting here at this moment

29:09.520 --> 29:14.480
 with very much my own approach to nearly everything.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.800
 And I'm calm, I'm happy about that.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.840
 But on the other hand, I know people

29:20.840 --> 29:25.840
 whose self confidence vastly exceeds mine.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.560
 And sometimes I think it's justified

29:28.560 --> 29:31.700
 and sometimes I think it's not justified.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.280
 Your most recent book titled

29:35.280 --> 29:37.800
 Einstein's Unfinished Revolution.

29:37.800 --> 29:42.240
 So I have to ask, what is Einstein's unfinished revolution

29:42.240 --> 29:45.480
 and also how do we finish it?

29:45.480 --> 29:48.440
 Well, that's something I've been trying to do my whole life,

29:48.440 --> 29:51.240
 but Einstein's unfinished revolution

29:51.240 --> 29:54.880
 is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theory,

29:54.880 --> 29:58.200
 special and especially general relativity,

29:58.200 --> 30:01.320
 and quantum theory, which he was the first person

30:01.320 --> 30:04.960
 to realize in 1905 that there would have to be

30:04.960 --> 30:09.920
 a radically different theory which somehow realized

30:09.920 --> 30:12.240
 or resolved the paradox of the duality

30:12.240 --> 30:14.360
 of particle and wave for photons.

30:14.360 --> 30:18.720
 And he was, I mean, people I think don't always

30:18.720 --> 30:21.160
 associate Einstein with quantum mechanics

30:21.160 --> 30:23.380
 because I think his connection with it,

30:24.320 --> 30:27.080
 founding as one of the founders,

30:27.080 --> 30:28.440
 I would say, of quantum mechanics,

30:28.440 --> 30:30.480
 he kind of put it in the closet.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.320
 Is it?

30:31.320 --> 30:34.000
 Well, he didn't believe that the quantum mechanics

30:34.000 --> 30:38.160
 as it was developed in the mid to late 1920s

30:38.160 --> 30:39.560
 was completely correct.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.160
 At first, he didn't believe it at all.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.180
 Then he was convinced that it's consistent,

30:44.180 --> 30:47.280
 but incomplete, and that also is my view.

30:47.280 --> 30:52.040
 It needs, for various reasons, I can elucidate,

30:52.040 --> 30:56.960
 to have additional degrees of freedom, particles,

30:56.960 --> 31:00.680
 forces, something to reach the stage

31:00.680 --> 31:03.960
 where it gives a complete description of each phenomenon,

31:03.960 --> 31:07.620
 as I was saying, realism demands.

31:07.620 --> 31:10.320
 So what aspect of quantum mechanics

31:10.320 --> 31:12.920
 bothers you and Einstein the most?

31:12.920 --> 31:17.920
 Is it some aspect of the wave function collapse discussions,

31:18.240 --> 31:19.880
 the measurement problem?

31:19.880 --> 31:23.220
 Is it the?

31:23.220 --> 31:24.120
 The measurement problem.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.160
 I'm not gonna speak for Einstein.

31:26.160 --> 31:31.160
 But the measurement problem, basically, and the fact that.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.120
 What is the measurement problem, sorry?

31:34.120 --> 31:36.840
 The basic formulation of quantum mechanics

31:36.840 --> 31:41.100
 gives you two ways to evolve situations in time.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.920
 One of them is explicitly when no observer is observing

31:44.920 --> 31:47.200
 and no measurement is taking place.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.720
 And the other is when a measurement

31:48.720 --> 31:50.480
 or an observation is taking place.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.960
 And they basically contradict each other.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.720
 But there's another reason why the revolution

31:56.720 --> 31:58.680
 was incomplete, which is we don't understand

31:58.680 --> 32:01.200
 the relationship between these two parts.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.680
 General relativity, which became our best theory

32:04.680 --> 32:08.720
 of space and time and gravitation and cosmology,

32:08.720 --> 32:11.600
 and quantum theory.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.120
 So for the most part, general relativity

32:14.120 --> 32:15.960
 describes big things.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.080
 Quantum theory describes little things.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.360
 And that's the revolution that we found

32:20.360 --> 32:22.520
 really powerful tools to describe

32:22.520 --> 32:24.040
 big things and little things.

32:24.040 --> 32:27.400
 And it's unfinished because we have

32:27.400 --> 32:30.120
 two totally separate things and we need to figure out

32:30.120 --> 32:32.360
 how to connect them so we can describe everything.

32:32.360 --> 32:36.820
 Right, and we either do that if we believe quantum mechanics

32:36.820 --> 32:41.820
 as understood now is correct by bringing general relativity

32:42.120 --> 32:44.160
 or some extension of general relativity

32:44.160 --> 32:46.520
 that describes gravity and so forth

32:46.520 --> 32:49.680
 into the quantum domain that's called quantize,

32:50.640 --> 32:52.960
 the theory of gravity.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.840
 Or if you believe with Einstein

32:55.840 --> 32:58.200
 that quantum mechanics needs to be completed,

32:58.200 --> 33:03.080
 and this is my view, then part of the job

33:03.080 --> 33:04.880
 of finding the right completion

33:04.880 --> 33:07.120
 or extension of quantum mechanics

33:07.120 --> 33:10.360
 would be one that incorporated space, time, and gravity.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.960
 So, where do we begin?

33:14.960 --> 33:19.620
 So first, let me ask, perhaps you can give me a chance,

33:19.620 --> 33:22.100
 if I could ask you some just really basic questions.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.520
 Well, they're not at all.

33:23.520 --> 33:24.880
 The basic questions are the hardest,

33:24.880 --> 33:26.740
 but you mentioned space, time.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.880
 What is space, time?

33:28.880 --> 33:32.260
 Space, time, you talked about a construction.

33:32.260 --> 33:36.440
 So I believe the space, time is an intellectual construction

33:36.440 --> 33:39.200
 that we make of the events in the universe.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.680
 I believe the events are real,

33:40.680 --> 33:43.520
 and the relationships between the events,

33:43.520 --> 33:45.720
 which cause which are real.

33:45.720 --> 33:50.480
 But the idea that there's a four dimensional

33:50.480 --> 33:54.000
 smooth geometry which has a metric and a connection

33:54.000 --> 33:57.320
 and satisfies the equations that Einstein wrote,

33:57.320 --> 34:00.400
 it's a good description to some scale.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.760
 It's a good approximation, it captures some

34:02.760 --> 34:05.080
 of what's really going on in nature.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.600
 But I don't believe it for a minute is fundamental.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.420
 So, okay, we're gonna allow me to linger on that.

34:12.420 --> 34:16.760
 So the universe has events, events cause other events.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.080
 This is the idea of causality.

34:19.080 --> 34:22.080
 Okay, so that's real.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.720
 That's in my.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.520
 In your view is real.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.660
 Or hypothesis, or the theories that I have been working

34:29.660 --> 34:32.200
 to develop make that assumption.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.320
 So space, time, you said four dimensional space

34:35.320 --> 34:37.220
 is kind of the location of things,

34:37.220 --> 34:42.240
 and time is whatever the heck time is.

34:42.240 --> 34:47.240
 And you're saying that space, time is,

34:47.800 --> 34:51.480
 both space and time are emergent and not fundamental?

34:51.480 --> 34:52.320
 No.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.480
 Sorry, before you correct me,

34:55.460 --> 34:58.600
 what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?

34:58.600 --> 35:01.480
 Fundamental means it's part of the description

35:01.480 --> 35:03.140
 as far down as you go.

35:03.140 --> 35:03.980
 We have this notion.

35:03.980 --> 35:04.800
 As real.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.640
 Yes.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.240
 As real as real it could be.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.160
 Yeah, so I think that time is fundamental,

35:10.160 --> 35:12.440
 and quote goes all the way down,

35:12.440 --> 35:16.080
 and space does not, and the combination of them

35:16.080 --> 35:18.960
 we use in general relativity that we call space time

35:18.960 --> 35:20.800
 also does not.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.080
 But what is time then?

35:24.080 --> 35:29.080
 I think that time, the activity of time

35:29.440 --> 35:34.360
 is a continual creation of events from existing events.

35:34.360 --> 35:37.560
 So if there's no events, there's no time.

35:37.560 --> 35:41.060
 Then there's not only no time, there's no nothing.

35:41.060 --> 35:45.800
 So I believe the universe has a history

35:47.020 --> 35:48.760
 which goes to the past.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.700
 I believe the future does not exist.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.320
 There's a notion of the present

35:53.320 --> 35:55.520
 and a notion of the past,

35:55.520 --> 35:58.720
 and the past consists of,

35:58.720 --> 36:03.640
 is a story about events that took place to our past.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.520
 So you said the future doesn't exist.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.360
 Yes.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.200
 Could you say that again?

36:10.200 --> 36:14.360
 Can you try to give me a chance to understand that

36:14.360 --> 36:15.280
 one more time?

36:15.280 --> 36:18.480
 So events cause other events.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.400
 What is this universe?

36:19.400 --> 36:23.580
 Cause we'll talk about locality and nonlocality.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.120
 Good.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.120
 Cause it's a crazy, I mean it's not crazy,

36:27.120 --> 36:32.120
 it's a beautiful set of ideas that you propose.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.640
 But, and if Kozali is fundamental,

36:34.640 --> 36:37.120
 I'd just like to understand it better.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.920
 What is the past?

36:38.920 --> 36:40.000
 What is the future?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.920
 What is the flow of time?

36:42.760 --> 36:46.680
 Even the error of time in our universe, in your view.

36:46.680 --> 36:50.440
 And maybe what's an event, right?

36:50.440 --> 36:54.360
 Oh, an event is where something changes,

36:54.360 --> 36:58.120
 or where two,

36:59.520 --> 37:02.200
 it's hard to say because it's a primitive concept.

37:02.200 --> 37:07.200
 An event is a moment of time within space.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.480
 This is the view in general relativity,

37:11.480 --> 37:15.480
 where two particles intersect in their paths,

37:15.480 --> 37:19.760
 or something changes in the path of a particle.

37:19.760 --> 37:23.600
 Now, we are postulating that there is,

37:23.600 --> 37:25.600
 at the fundamental level, a notion,

37:25.600 --> 37:27.240
 which is an elementary notion,

37:27.240 --> 37:31.480
 so it doesn't have a definition in terms of other things,

37:31.480 --> 37:34.800
 but it is something elementary happening.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.920
 And it doesn't have a connection to energy,

37:36.920 --> 37:38.240
 or matter, or exchange of energy?

37:38.240 --> 37:40.160
 It does have a connection to energy and matter.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.700
 So it's at that level.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.280
 Yeah, it involves,

37:43.280 --> 37:48.280
 and that's why the version of a theory of events

37:48.320 --> 37:50.840
 that I've developed with Marina Cortez,

37:50.840 --> 37:54.040
 and it's, by the way, I wanna mention my collaborators,

37:54.040 --> 37:55.920
 because they've been at least as important

37:55.920 --> 37:57.800
 in this work as I have.

37:57.800 --> 38:02.800
 It's Marina Cortez in all the work since about 2013,

38:02.920 --> 38:07.440
 2012, 2013, about causality, causal sets.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.200
 And in the period before that, Roberta Mangibera Unger,

38:11.200 --> 38:14.760
 who is a philosopher and a professor of law.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.560
 And that's in your efforts,

38:16.560 --> 38:17.760
 together with your collaborators,

38:17.760 --> 38:20.120
 to finish the unfinished revolution.

38:20.120 --> 38:20.940
 Yes.

38:20.940 --> 38:23.560
 And focus on causality as a fundamental.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.400
 Yes.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.520
 As fundamental to physics.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.080
 So.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.400
 And there's certainly other people we've worked with,

38:30.400 --> 38:32.720
 but those two people's thinking

38:32.720 --> 38:34.920
 had a huge influence on my own thinking.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.800
 So in the way you describe causality,

38:36.800 --> 38:39.480
 that's what you mean of time being fundamental.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.560
 That causality is fundamental.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.400
 Yes.

38:43.640 --> 38:47.320
 And what does it mean for space to not be fundamental,

38:47.320 --> 38:48.160
 to be emergent?

38:48.160 --> 38:48.980
 That's very good.

38:48.980 --> 38:52.600
 There's a level of description in which there are events,

38:52.600 --> 38:57.080
 there are events create other events,

38:58.160 --> 38:59.280
 but there's no space.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.720
 They don't live in space.

39:00.720 --> 39:04.000
 They have an order in which they caused each other.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.560
 And that is part of the nature of time for us.

39:07.560 --> 39:12.560
 But there is an emergent approximate description.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.560
 And you asked me to define emergent.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.160
 I didn't.

39:17.160 --> 39:22.160
 An emergent property is a property

39:22.400 --> 39:26.480
 that arises at some level of complexity,

39:26.480 --> 39:31.240
 larger than and more complex than the fundamental level,

39:31.240 --> 39:36.120
 which requires some property to describe it,

39:36.120 --> 39:37.960
 which is not directly

39:40.600 --> 39:44.600
 explicable or derivable is the word I want

39:44.600 --> 39:48.640
 from the properties of the fundamental things.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.800
 And space is one of those things

39:50.800 --> 39:53.120
 in a sufficiently complex universe,

39:53.120 --> 39:58.120
 space, three dimensional position of things emerged.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.880
 Yes, and we have this,

39:59.880 --> 40:03.920
 we saw how this happens in detail in some models,

40:03.920 --> 40:07.640
 both computationally and analytically.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.240
 Okay, so connected to space is the idea of locality.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.080
 Yes.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.200
 So we've talked about realism.

40:15.200 --> 40:19.840
 So I live in this world that like sports.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.400
 Locality is a thing that you can affect things close to you

40:26.280 --> 40:29.800
 and don't have an effect on things that are far away.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.880
 It's the thing that bothers me about gravity in general

40:32.880 --> 40:35.120
 or action at a distance.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.400
 Same thing that probably bothered Newton,

40:37.400 --> 40:40.080
 or at least he said a little bit about it.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.560
 Okay, so what do you think about locality?

40:45.560 --> 40:47.000
 Is it just a construct?

40:48.720 --> 40:51.680
 Is it us humans just like this idea

40:51.680 --> 40:54.200
 and are connected to it because we exist in it,

40:54.200 --> 40:57.120
 we need it for our survival, but it's not fundamental?

40:57.120 --> 40:58.920
 I mean, it seems crazy for it not to be

40:58.920 --> 41:01.920
 a fundamental aspect of our reality.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.040
 It does.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.920
 Can you comfort me on a sort of as a therapist,

41:05.920 --> 41:07.840
 like how do I?

41:07.840 --> 41:10.400
 I'm not a good therapist, but I'll do my best.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.240
 Okay.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.800
 There are several different definitions of locality

41:16.800 --> 41:19.640
 when you come to talk about locality in physics.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.680
 In quantum field theory,

41:23.680 --> 41:27.520
 which is a mixture of special relativity

41:27.520 --> 41:29.640
 and quantum mechanics,

41:29.640 --> 41:32.640
 there is a precise definition of locality.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.560
 Field operators corresponding to events in space time,

41:37.560 --> 41:38.960
 which are space like separated,

41:38.960 --> 41:41.480
 commute with each other as operators.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.520
 So in quantum mechanics,

41:43.520 --> 41:46.200
 you think about the nature of reality as fields

41:46.200 --> 41:48.800
 and things that are close in a field

41:48.800 --> 41:53.000
 have an impact on each other more than farther away.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.200
 That's, yes.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.560
 That's very comforting.

41:55.560 --> 41:56.400
 That makes sense.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.400
 So that's a property of quantum field theory

41:58.400 --> 42:00.320
 and it's well tested.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.920
 Unfortunately, there's another definition of local,

42:04.920 --> 42:07.680
 which was expressed by Einstein

42:07.680 --> 42:11.080
 and expressed more precisely by John Bell,

42:11.080 --> 42:15.720
 which has been tested experimentally and found to fail.

42:15.720 --> 42:19.600
 And this set up is you take two particles.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.000
 So one thing that's really weird about quantum mechanics

42:24.000 --> 42:26.480
 is a property called entanglement.

42:26.480 --> 42:28.880
 You can have two particles interact

42:28.880 --> 42:31.200
 and then share a property

42:31.200 --> 42:32.680
 without it being a property

42:32.680 --> 42:35.400
 of either one of the two particles.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.480
 And if you take such a system

42:38.480 --> 42:43.440
 and then you make a measurement on particle A,

42:43.440 --> 42:46.040
 which is over here on my right side,

42:46.040 --> 42:48.200
 and particle B, which is over here.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.760
 Somebody else makes a measurement of particle B.

42:50.760 --> 42:55.760
 You can ask that whatever is the real reality

42:56.840 --> 43:01.840
 of particle B, it not be affected by the choice

43:01.960 --> 43:04.680
 the observer at particle A makes about what to measure,

43:04.680 --> 43:06.160
 not the outcome,

43:06.160 --> 43:09.680
 just the choice of the different things they might measure.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.400
 And that's a notion of locality

43:11.400 --> 43:13.240
 because it assumes that these things

43:13.240 --> 43:16.080
 are very far spaced like separated.

43:16.080 --> 43:19.040
 And it's gonna take a while for any information

43:19.040 --> 43:22.160
 about the choice made by the people here at A

43:22.160 --> 43:24.080
 to affect the reality at B.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.480
 But you make that assumption,

43:25.480 --> 43:27.600
 that's called Bell locality.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.120
 And you derive a certain inequality

43:30.120 --> 43:32.400
 that some correlations,

43:32.400 --> 43:36.040
 functions of correlations have to satisfy.

43:36.040 --> 43:39.360
 And then you can test that pretty directly

43:39.360 --> 43:42.280
 in experiments which create pairs of photons

43:42.280 --> 43:44.000
 or other particles.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.800
 And it's wrong by many sigma.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.920
 In experiment, it doesn't match.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.840
 So what does that mean?

43:51.840 --> 43:54.600
 That means that that definition of locality

43:54.600 --> 43:56.440
 I stated is false.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.840
 The one that Einstein was playing with.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.720
 Yeah, and the one that I stated,

44:00.720 --> 44:04.760
 that is it's not true that whatever is real

44:04.760 --> 44:08.720
 about particle B is unaffected by the choice

44:08.720 --> 44:10.960
 that the observer makes as to what to measure

44:10.960 --> 44:12.200
 in particle A.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.600
 No matter how long they've been propagating

44:14.600 --> 44:17.640
 at almost the speed of light or the speed of light

44:17.640 --> 44:19.360
 away from each other, it's no matter.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.000
 So like the distance between them.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.640
 Well, it's been tested, of course,

44:23.640 --> 44:27.560
 if you want to have hope for quantum mechanics

44:27.560 --> 44:30.320
 being incomplete or wrong and corrected

44:30.320 --> 44:32.440
 by something that changes this.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.880
 It's been tested over a number of kilometers.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.440
 I don't remember whether it's 25 kilometers

44:39.440 --> 44:42.160
 or a hundred and something kilometers, but.

44:42.160 --> 44:47.160
 So in trying to solve the unsolved revolution,

44:47.800 --> 44:50.200
 in trying to come up with the theory for everything,

44:50.200 --> 44:55.200
 is causality fundamental and breaking away from locality?

44:57.600 --> 44:58.440
 Absolutely.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.480
 A crucial step.

45:00.480 --> 45:04.080
 So in your book, essentially, those are the two things

45:04.080 --> 45:07.880
 we really need to think about as a community.

45:07.880 --> 45:12.120
 Especially the physics community has to think about this.

45:12.120 --> 45:15.680
 I guess my question is, how do we solve?

45:15.680 --> 45:19.120
 How do we finish the unfinished revolution?

45:19.120 --> 45:22.760
 Well, that's, I can only tell you what I'm trying to do

45:22.760 --> 45:27.880
 and what I've abandoned as not working.

45:27.880 --> 45:31.440
 As one ant, smart ant in an ant colony.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.760
 Yep.

45:32.760 --> 45:35.960
 Or maybe dumb, that's why, who knows?

45:35.960 --> 45:40.280
 But anyway, my view of the,

45:40.280 --> 45:43.120
 we've had some nice theories invented.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.240
 There's a bunch of different ones.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.640
 Both relate to quantum mechanics,

45:49.640 --> 45:51.920
 relate to quantum gravity.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.920
 There's a lot to admire

45:53.920 --> 45:56.800
 in many of these different approaches.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.480
 But to my understanding,

45:58.480 --> 46:02.840
 they, none of them completely solve the problems

46:02.840 --> 46:04.080
 that I care about.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.040
 And so we're in a situation

46:08.040 --> 46:11.800
 which is either terrifying for a student

46:11.800 --> 46:14.920
 or full of opportunity for the right student,

46:14.920 --> 46:19.560
 in which we've got more than a dozen attempts.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.120
 And I never thought, I don't think anybody anticipated

46:22.120 --> 46:23.640
 it would work out this way.

46:23.640 --> 46:26.640
 Which work partly and then at some point,

46:26.640 --> 46:28.840
 they have an issue that nobody can figure out

46:28.840 --> 46:30.920
 how to go around or how to solve.

46:31.920 --> 46:36.080
 And that's the situation we're in.

46:36.080 --> 46:39.520
 My reaction to that is twofold.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.640
 One of them is to try to bring people,

46:42.640 --> 46:46.920
 we evolved into this unfortunate sociological situation

46:46.920 --> 46:48.800
 in which there are communities

46:48.800 --> 46:50.680
 around some of these approaches.

46:50.680 --> 46:53.720
 And to borrow again, a metaphor from Eric,

46:53.720 --> 46:58.000
 they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories

46:58.000 --> 47:00.360
 and throw rocks at each other.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.840
 And as Eric says, we need two things.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.400
 We need people to get off their hills

47:05.400 --> 47:08.680
 and come down into the valleys and party and talk

47:08.680 --> 47:13.000
 and become friendly and learn to say,

47:14.120 --> 47:18.200
 not no but, but yes and yes.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.640
 Your idea goes this far,

47:19.640 --> 47:21.800
 but maybe if we put it together with my idea,

47:21.800 --> 47:22.920
 we can go further.

47:22.920 --> 47:23.760
 Yes.

47:25.160 --> 47:29.280
 So in that spirit, I've talked several times

47:29.280 --> 47:32.680
 with Sean Carroll, who's also written

47:32.680 --> 47:34.200
 an excellent book recently.

47:34.200 --> 47:36.880
 And he kind of, he plays around,

47:36.880 --> 47:39.000
 is a big fan of the many worlds interpretation

47:39.000 --> 47:40.400
 of quantum mechanics.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.960
 So I'm a troublemaker.

47:42.960 --> 47:47.280
 So let me ask, what's your sense of Sean

47:47.280 --> 47:50.000
 and the idea of many worlds interpretation?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.760
 I've read many the commentary back and forth.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.800
 You guys are friendly, respect each other,

47:55.800 --> 47:57.400
 but have a lot of fun debating.

47:57.400 --> 48:02.280
 I love Sean and he, no, I really,

48:02.280 --> 48:07.280
 he's articulate and he's a great representative

48:07.920 --> 48:10.280
 or ambassador of science to the public

48:10.280 --> 48:13.400
 and for different fields of science to each other.

48:14.280 --> 48:19.280
 He also, like I do, takes philosophy seriously.

48:19.440 --> 48:24.360
 And unlike what I do in all cases,

48:24.360 --> 48:26.440
 he has really done the homework.

48:26.440 --> 48:29.120
 He's read a lot, he knows the people,

48:29.120 --> 48:34.120
 he talks to them, he exposes his arguments to them.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.520
 And I, there's this mysterious thing

48:37.520 --> 48:40.680
 that we so often end up on the opposite sides

48:40.680 --> 48:41.800
 of one of these issues.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.080
 It's fun though.

48:43.080 --> 48:47.720
 It's fun and I'd love to have a conversation about that,

48:47.720 --> 48:50.120
 but I would want to include him.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.160
 I see, about many worlds, well.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.080
 No, I can tell you what I think about many worlds.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.160
 I'd love to, but actually on that, let me pause.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.360
 Sean has a podcast.

48:57.360 --> 49:00.000
 You should definitely figure out how to talk to Sean.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.720
 I would, I actually told Sean,

49:01.720 --> 49:05.040
 I would love to hear you guys just going back and forth.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.520
 So I hope you can make that happen eventually,

49:07.520 --> 49:08.360
 you and Sean.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.560
 I won't tell you what it is,

49:09.560 --> 49:12.120
 but there's something that Sean said to me

49:12.120 --> 49:17.120
 in June of 2016 that changed my whole approach to a problem.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.240
 But I'll have to tell him first.

49:19.240 --> 49:23.280
 Yes, and that, that'll be great to tell him on his podcast.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.120
 So.

49:24.120 --> 49:26.280
 I can't invite myself to his podcast.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.560
 But I told him, yeah, okay, we'll make it happen.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.000
 So many worlds.

49:30.000 --> 49:30.840
 Anyway.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.560
 What's your view?

49:32.560 --> 49:34.840
 Many worlds, we talk about nonlocality.

49:34.840 --> 49:39.800
 Many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea

49:39.800 --> 49:43.400
 or beautiful depending on your perspective.

49:43.400 --> 49:48.400
 It's very nice in terms of,

49:49.000 --> 49:50.600
 I mean, there's a realist aspect to it.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.560
 I think you called it magical realism.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.400
 Yeah.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.720
 It's just a beautiful line.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.800
 But at the same time,

49:57.800 --> 50:00.640
 it's very difficult to far limited human minds

50:00.640 --> 50:01.480
 to comprehend.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.240
 So what are your thoughts about it?

50:04.960 --> 50:08.640
 Let me start with the easy and obvious

50:08.640 --> 50:10.760
 and then go to the scientific.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.280
 Okay.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.520
 It doesn't appeal to me.

50:13.520 --> 50:17.720
 It doesn't answer the questions that I want answered.

50:17.720 --> 50:20.480
 And it does so to such a strong case

50:20.480 --> 50:23.280
 that when Roberto Mangueber Anger and I

50:23.280 --> 50:24.960
 began looking for principles,

50:24.960 --> 50:26.440
 and I want to come back and talk about

50:26.440 --> 50:28.640
 the use of principles in science,

50:28.640 --> 50:30.240
 because that's the other thing I was going to say,

50:30.240 --> 50:32.560
 and I don't want to lose that.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.720
 When we started looking for principles,

50:34.720 --> 50:36.040
 we made our first principle,

50:36.040 --> 50:39.080
 there is just one world and it happens once.

50:39.960 --> 50:44.960
 But so it's not helpful to my personal approach,

50:47.160 --> 50:49.120
 to my personal agenda,

50:49.120 --> 50:51.400
 but of course I'm part of a community.

50:51.400 --> 50:56.400
 And my sense of the many worlds interpretation,

50:57.040 --> 51:00.800
 I have thought a lot about it and struggled a lot with it,

51:00.800 --> 51:02.840
 is the following.

51:05.320 --> 51:07.840
 First of all, there's Everett himself,

51:07.840 --> 51:09.360
 there's what's in Everett.

51:10.600 --> 51:13.560
 And there are several issues there

51:13.560 --> 51:16.880
 connected with the derivation of the Born Rule,

51:16.880 --> 51:20.960
 which is the rule that gives probabilities to events.

51:20.960 --> 51:25.440
 And the reasons why there is a problem with probability

51:25.440 --> 51:28.480
 is that I mentioned the two ways

51:28.480 --> 51:31.280
 that physical systems can evolve.

51:31.280 --> 51:34.440
 The many worlds interpretation cuts off,

51:34.440 --> 51:37.120
 one, the one having to do with measurement,

51:37.120 --> 51:39.760
 and just has the other one, the Schrodinger evolution,

51:39.760 --> 51:43.040
 which is this smooth evolution of the quantum state.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.720
 But the notion of probability is only in the second rule,

51:48.720 --> 51:50.840
 which we've thrown away.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.600
 So where does probability come from?

51:52.600 --> 51:54.960
 And you have to answer the question

51:54.960 --> 51:57.720
 because experimentalists use probabilities

51:57.720 --> 51:58.920
 to check the theory.

52:00.400 --> 52:05.040
 Now, at first sight, you get very confused

52:05.040 --> 52:07.520
 because there seems to be a real problem

52:07.520 --> 52:10.960
 because in the many worlds interpretation,

52:10.960 --> 52:13.480
 this talk about branches is not quite precise,

52:13.480 --> 52:14.520
 but I'll use it.

52:16.360 --> 52:19.240
 There's a branch in which everything that might happen

52:19.240 --> 52:23.880
 does happen with probability one in that branch.

52:23.880 --> 52:27.440
 You might think you could count the number of branches

52:27.440 --> 52:30.280
 in which things do and don't happen

52:30.280 --> 52:32.360
 and get numbers that you can define

52:32.360 --> 52:34.880
 as something like frequentist probabilities.

52:35.760 --> 52:40.200
 And Everett did have an argument in that direction,

52:41.120 --> 52:43.280
 but the argument gets very subtle

52:43.280 --> 52:45.800
 when there are an infinite number of possibilities,

52:45.800 --> 52:49.000
 as is the case in most quantum systems.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.600
 And my understanding,

52:50.600 --> 52:54.840
 although I'm not as much of an expert as some other people,

52:54.840 --> 52:59.440
 is that Everett's own proposal failed, did not work.

53:00.760 --> 53:05.480
 There are then, but it doesn't stop there.

53:05.480 --> 53:08.560
 There is an important idea that Everett didn't know about,

53:08.560 --> 53:10.000
 which is decoherence,

53:10.000 --> 53:13.680
 and it is a phenomenon that might be very much relevant.

53:13.680 --> 53:18.680
 And so a number of people post Everett

53:19.080 --> 53:22.280
 have tried to make versions of what you might call

53:22.280 --> 53:24.240
 many worlds quantum mechanics.

53:26.160 --> 53:29.640
 And this is a big area and it's subtle,

53:29.640 --> 53:33.080
 and it's not the kind of thing that I do well.

53:33.080 --> 53:36.200
 So I consulted, that's why there's two chapters on this

53:36.200 --> 53:37.560
 in the book I wrote.

53:37.560 --> 53:39.680
 Chapter 10, which is about Everett's version,

53:39.680 --> 53:44.600
 chapter 11, there's a very good group of philosophers

53:44.600 --> 53:49.440
 of physics in Oxford, Simon Saunders, David Wallace,

53:49.440 --> 53:52.800
 Harvey Brown, and a number of others.

53:52.800 --> 53:57.120
 And of course there's David Deutsch, who is there.

53:57.120 --> 54:01.480
 And those people have developed and put a lot of work

54:01.480 --> 54:04.280
 into a very sophisticated set of ideas

54:04.280 --> 54:07.560
 designed to come back and answer that question.

54:07.560 --> 54:11.400
 They have the flavor of there are really no probabilities,

54:11.400 --> 54:15.720
 we admit that, but imagine if the Everett story was true

54:15.720 --> 54:18.760
 and you were living in that multiverse,

54:18.760 --> 54:20.960
 how would you make bets?

54:20.960 --> 54:24.640
 And so they use decision theory

54:24.640 --> 54:28.640
 from the theory of probability and gambling and so forth

54:28.640 --> 54:33.040
 to shape a story of how you would bet

54:33.040 --> 54:35.400
 if you were inside an Everett in the universe

54:35.400 --> 54:37.800
 and you knew that.

54:37.800 --> 54:41.920
 And there's a debate among those experts

54:41.920 --> 54:47.560
 as to whether they or somebody else has really succeeded.

54:47.560 --> 54:50.760
 And when I checked in as I was finishing the book

54:50.760 --> 54:52.800
 with some of those people, like Simon,

54:52.800 --> 54:56.600
 who's a good friend of mine, and David Wallace,

54:56.600 --> 54:59.240
 they told me that they weren't sure

54:59.240 --> 55:02.160
 that any of them was yet correct.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.840
 So that's what I put in my book.

55:04.840 --> 55:08.160
 Now, to add to that, Sean has his own approach

55:08.160 --> 55:10.720
 to that problem in what's called self referencing

55:10.720 --> 55:13.480
 or self locating observers.

55:14.640 --> 55:19.640
 And it doesn't, I tried to read it

55:20.240 --> 55:22.520
 and it didn't make sense to me,

55:22.520 --> 55:24.120
 but I didn't study it hard,

55:24.120 --> 55:25.480
 I didn't communicate with Sean,

55:25.480 --> 55:27.000
 I didn't do the things that I would do,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.360
 so I had nothing to say about it in the book.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.800
 I don't know whether it's right or not.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.520
 Let's talk a little bit about science.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.800
 You mentioned the use of principles in science.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.080
 What does it mean to have a principle

55:43.080 --> 55:45.360
 and why is that important?

55:45.360 --> 55:48.440
 When I feel very frustrated about quantum gravity,

55:48.440 --> 55:50.720
 I like to go back and read history.

55:51.840 --> 55:55.160
 And of course, Einstein, his achievements

55:55.160 --> 55:59.840
 are a huge lesson and hopefully something

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
 like a role model.

56:00.840 --> 56:05.200
 And it's very clear that Einstein thought

56:05.200 --> 56:09.080
 that the first job when you wanna enter a new domain

56:09.080 --> 56:13.400
 of theoretical physics is to discover and invent principles

56:13.400 --> 56:15.880
 and then make models of how those principles

56:15.880 --> 56:19.280
 might be applied in some experimental situation,

56:19.280 --> 56:22.440
 which is where the mathematics comes in.

56:22.440 --> 56:27.440
 So for Einstein, there was no unified space and time.

56:27.440 --> 56:30.760
 Minkowski invented this idea of space time.

56:30.760 --> 56:33.760
 For Einstein, it was a model of his principles

56:33.760 --> 56:34.920
 or his postulates.

56:36.120 --> 56:41.120
 And I've taken the view that we don't know

56:41.280 --> 56:43.440
 the principles of quantum gravity.

56:43.440 --> 56:46.920
 I can think about candidates and I have some papers

56:46.920 --> 56:50.120
 where I discuss different candidates

56:50.120 --> 56:52.520
 and I'm happy to discuss them.

56:52.520 --> 56:56.840
 But my belief now is that those partially successful

56:56.840 --> 57:00.640
 approaches are all models,

57:01.680 --> 57:05.880
 which might describe indeed some quantum gravity physics

57:05.880 --> 57:08.960
 in some domain, in some aspect,

57:08.960 --> 57:12.720
 but ultimately would be important

57:12.720 --> 57:15.200
 because they model the principles

57:15.200 --> 57:18.200
 and the first job is to tie down those principles.

57:18.200 --> 57:21.280
 So that's the approach that I'm taking.

57:21.280 --> 57:26.240
 So speaking of principles, in your 2006 book,

57:26.240 --> 57:30.920
 The Trouble with Physics, you criticized a bit

57:30.920 --> 57:34.160
 string theory for taking us away from the rigors

57:34.160 --> 57:37.120
 of the scientific method or whatever you would call it.

57:37.120 --> 57:42.120
 But what's the trouble with physics today

57:42.760 --> 57:44.240
 and how do we fix it?

57:44.240 --> 57:47.400
 Can I say how I read that book?

57:47.400 --> 57:48.240
 Sure.

57:48.240 --> 57:52.440
 Because I, and I'm not, this of course has to be my fault

57:52.440 --> 57:55.680
 because you can't as an author claim

57:55.680 --> 57:58.320
 after all the work you put in that you are misread.

57:59.480 --> 58:04.480
 But I will say that many of the reviewers

58:04.600 --> 58:06.520
 who are not personally involved

58:06.520 --> 58:09.720
 and even many who were working on string theory

58:09.720 --> 58:12.400
 or some other approach to quantum gravity

58:12.400 --> 58:14.360
 told me, communicated with me and told me

58:14.360 --> 58:16.120
 they thought that I was fair

58:17.360 --> 58:20.840
 and balance was the word that was usually used.

58:20.840 --> 58:24.040
 So let me tell you what my purpose was in writing that book,

58:24.040 --> 58:28.760
 which clearly got diverted by,

58:28.760 --> 58:33.760
 because there was already a rather hot argument going on.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.000
 And this is.

58:36.000 --> 58:36.840
 On which topic?

58:36.840 --> 58:38.600
 On string theory specifically?

58:38.600 --> 58:40.180
 Or in general in physics?

58:41.060 --> 58:44.060
 No, more specifically than string theory.

58:44.060 --> 58:47.680
 So since we're in Cambridge, can I say that?

58:47.680 --> 58:48.520
 We're doing this in Cambridge.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.360
 Yeah, yeah, of course.

58:49.360 --> 58:52.680
 Cambridge, just to be clear, Massachusetts.

58:52.680 --> 58:55.600
 And on Harvard campus.

58:55.600 --> 59:00.600
 Right, so Andy Straminger is a good friend of mine

59:00.600 --> 59:03.460
 and has been for many, many years.

59:03.460 --> 59:08.460
 And Andy, so originally there was this beautiful idea

59:09.440 --> 59:11.360
 that there were five string theories

59:11.360 --> 59:14.420
 and maybe they would be unified into one.

59:14.420 --> 59:18.520
 And we would discover a way to break that symmetries

59:18.520 --> 59:20.640
 of one of those string theories

59:20.640 --> 59:22.760
 and discover the standard model

59:22.760 --> 59:24.560
 and predict all the properties

59:24.560 --> 59:26.280
 of standard model particles,

59:26.280 --> 59:28.960
 like their masses and charges and so forth,

59:28.960 --> 59:30.120
 coupling constants.

59:31.560 --> 59:34.880
 And then there was a bunch of solutions

59:35.840 --> 59:37.240
 to string theory found,

59:37.240 --> 59:39.700
 which led each of them to a different version

59:39.700 --> 59:42.680
 of particle physics with a different phenomenology.

59:42.680 --> 59:46.560
 These are called the Calabi Yao manifolds,

59:46.560 --> 59:50.280
 named after Yao, who is also here.

59:50.280 --> 59:52.440
 Not, certainly we've been friends

59:52.440 --> 59:54.260
 at some time in the past anyway.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.880
 And then there were, nobody was sure,

59:57.880 --> 1:00:00.200
 but hundreds of thousands of different versions

1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:01.840
 of string theory.

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:04.620
 And then Andy found there was a way

1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:07.480
 to put a certain kind of mathematical curvature

1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:10.440
 called torsion into the solutions.

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:13.860
 And he wrote a paper, String Theory with Torsion,

1:00:13.860 --> 1:00:15.940
 in which he discovered there was,

1:00:15.940 --> 1:00:20.180
 and not formally uncountable,

1:00:20.180 --> 1:00:22.220
 but he was unable to invent any way

1:00:22.220 --> 1:00:24.580
 to count the number of solutions

1:00:24.580 --> 1:00:27.480
 or classify the diverse solutions.

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:31.100
 And he wrote that this is worrying

1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:33.900
 because doing phenomenology the old fashioned way

1:00:33.900 --> 1:00:37.420
 by solving the theory is not gonna work

1:00:37.420 --> 1:00:41.100
 because there's gonna be loads of solutions

1:00:41.100 --> 1:00:42.940
 for every proposed phenomenology

1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:45.220
 for anything the experiments discovered.

1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:47.500
 And it hasn't quite worked out that way.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:50.580
 But nonetheless, he took that worry to me.

1:00:51.700 --> 1:00:56.660
 We spoke at least once, maybe two or three times about that.

1:00:56.660 --> 1:00:59.040
 And I got seriously worried about that.

1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:02.460
 And this is just a little.

1:01:02.460 --> 1:01:05.020
 So it's like an anecdote that inspired

1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:07.280
 your worry about string theory in general?

1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:10.100
 Well, I tried to solve the problem

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:12.960
 and I tried to solve the problem.

1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:15.740
 I was reading at that time, a lot of biology,

1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:17.300
 a lot of evolutionary theory,

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:22.300
 like Linmar Gullis and Steve Gould and so forth.

1:01:23.100 --> 1:01:28.100
 And I could take your time to go through the things,

1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:30.580
 but it occurred to me,

1:01:30.580 --> 1:01:33.980
 maybe physics was like evolutionary biology

1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:36.060
 and maybe the laws evolved.

1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:40.060
 And there was, the biologists talk about a landscape,

1:01:40.060 --> 1:01:44.040
 a fitness landscape of DNA sequences

1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:48.780
 or protein sequences or species or something like that.

1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:51.340
 And I took their concept and the word landscape

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:54.540
 from theoretical biology and made a scenario

1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:59.060
 about how the universe as a whole could evolve

1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:03.540
 to discover the parameters of the standard model.

1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:04.620
 And I'm happy to discuss,

1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:07.220
 that's called cosmological natural selection.

1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:09.900
 Cosmological natural selection.

1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:10.740
 Yeah.

1:02:10.740 --> 1:02:12.580
 Wow, so the parameters of the standard model,

1:02:12.580 --> 1:02:15.540
 so the laws of physics are changing.

1:02:15.540 --> 1:02:18.940
 This idea would say that the laws of physics

1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:23.420
 are changing in some way that echoes

1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:24.900
 that of natural selection,

1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:28.860
 or just it adjusts in some way towards some goal.

1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:30.000
 Yes.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.580
 And I published that,

1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:36.620
 I wrote the paper in 1888 or 89,

1:02:36.620 --> 1:02:39.140
 the paper was published in 92.

1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:40.980
 My first book in 1997,

1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:45.500
 The Life of the Cosmos was explicitly about that.

1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:49.300
 And I was very clear that what was important

1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:54.300
 is that because you would develop an ensemble of universes,

1:02:55.020 --> 1:02:59.260
 but they were related by descent to natural selection,

1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:03.500
 almost every universe would share the property

1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:08.500
 that it was, its fitness was maximized to some extent,

1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:10.920
 or at least close to maximum.

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.480
 And I could deduce predictions

1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:16.080
 that could be tested from that.

1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:18.220
 And I worked all of that out

1:03:18.220 --> 1:03:20.440
 and I compared it to the anthropic principle

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:23.320
 where you weren't able to make tests

1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:24.480
 or make falsifications.

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:28.400
 All of this was in the late 80s and early 90s.

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:30.000
 That's a really compelling notion,

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.840
 but how does that help you arrive?

1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:36.040
 I'm coming to where the book came from.

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.000
 Yes.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.080
 So what got me,

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:42.720
 I worked on string theory.

1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:47.480
 I also worked on loop quantum gravity.

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:50.640
 And I was one of the inventors of loop quantum gravity.

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:55.480
 And because of my strong belief in some other principles,

1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:58.040
 which led to this notion of wanting a quantum theory

1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:00.880
 of gravity to be what we call relational

1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:03.020
 or background independent,

1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:05.960
 I tried very hard to make string theory

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:07.600
 background independent.

1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:09.840
 And it ended up developing a bunch of tools

1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.600
 which then could apply directly to general relativity

1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:15.020
 and that became loop quantum gravity.

1:04:15.020 --> 1:04:17.280
 So the things were very closely related

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:20.440
 and have always been very closely related in my mind.

1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:22.160
 The idea that there were two communities,

1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:25.320
 one devoted to strings and one devoted to loops is nuts

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.740
 and has always been nuts.

1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:32.680
 Okay, so anyway, there's this nuts community

1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.000
 of loops and strings that are all beautiful

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.400
 and compelling and mathematically speaking.

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:38.800
 And what's the trouble with all that?

1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:40.680
 Why is that such a problem?

1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:45.620
 So I was interested in developing that notion

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:47.820
 of how science works based on a community

1:04:47.820 --> 1:04:49.700
 and ethics that I told you about.

1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:54.780
 And I wrote a draft of a book about that,

1:04:54.780 --> 1:04:58.860
 which had several chapters on methodology of science.

1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:02.520
 And it was a rather academically oriented book.

1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:06.560
 And those chapters were the first part of the book,

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:07.680
 the first third of it.

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:09.880
 And you didn't find their remnants

1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:14.520
 in what's now the last part of the trouble with physics.

1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:18.680
 And then I described a number of test cases, case studies.

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:21.480
 And one of them, which I knew was the search

1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:24.080
 for quantum gravity and string theory and so forth.

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:28.660
 And I wasn't able to get that book published.

1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:33.660
 So somebody made the suggestion of flipping it around

1:05:34.700 --> 1:05:36.820
 and starting with a story of string theory,

1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:38.620
 which was already controversial.

1:05:38.620 --> 1:05:42.460
 This was 2004, 2005.

1:05:42.460 --> 1:05:47.460
 But I was very careful to be detailed,

1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:52.900
 to criticize papers and not people.

1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:55.540
 You won't find me criticizing individuals.

1:05:55.540 --> 1:05:59.100
 You'll find me criticizing certain writing.

1:05:59.100 --> 1:06:03.820
 But in any case, here's what I regret.

1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:06.500
 Let me make your program worthwhile.

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.340
 Yes.

1:06:07.340 --> 1:06:11.980
 As far as I know, with the exception of not understanding

1:06:11.980 --> 1:06:15.380
 how large the applications to condensed matter,

1:06:15.380 --> 1:06:20.380
 say ADS CFT would get,

1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:25.380
 I think largely my diagnosis of string theory

1:06:26.580 --> 1:06:30.380
 as it was then has stood up since 2006.

1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:34.940
 What I regret is that the same critique,

1:06:34.940 --> 1:06:37.540
 I was using string theory as an example,

1:06:37.540 --> 1:06:41.780
 and the same critique applies to many other communities

1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:44.380
 in science and all of, including,

1:06:44.380 --> 1:06:46.500
 and this is where I regret my own community,

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:49.900
 that is a community of people working on quantum gravity.

1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:52.220
 Not science string theory.

1:06:52.220 --> 1:06:55.860
 But, and I considered saying that explicitly.

1:06:55.860 --> 1:06:57.220
 But to say that explicitly,

1:06:57.220 --> 1:07:00.460
 since it's a small, intimate community,

1:07:00.460 --> 1:07:02.940
 I would be telling stories and naming names

1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:06.420
 and making a kind of history

1:07:06.420 --> 1:07:08.900
 that I have no right to write.

1:07:08.900 --> 1:07:12.060
 So I stayed away from that, but was misunderstood.

1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:16.380
 But if I may ask, is there a hopeful message

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:20.260
 for theoretical physics that we can take from that book,

1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:22.100
 sort of that looks at the community,

1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:24.780
 not just your own work on,

1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:26.780
 now with causality and nonlocality,

1:07:26.780 --> 1:07:29.060
 but just broadly in understanding

1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:32.060
 the fundamental nature of our reality,

1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:35.940
 what's your hope for the 21st century in physics?

1:07:37.060 --> 1:07:39.660
 Well, that we solve the problem.

1:07:39.660 --> 1:07:44.300
 That we solve the unfinished problem of Einstein's.

1:07:44.300 --> 1:07:47.940
 That's certainly the thing that I care about most in.

1:07:47.940 --> 1:07:49.180
 Hope for most.

1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:50.620
 Let me say one thing.

1:07:50.620 --> 1:07:53.740
 Among the young people that I work with,

1:07:53.740 --> 1:07:58.740
 I hear very often and sense a total disinterest

1:07:59.220 --> 1:08:03.420
 in these arguments that we older scientists have.

1:08:03.420 --> 1:08:05.820
 And an interest in what each other is doing.

1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:09.860
 And this is starting to appear in conferences

1:08:09.860 --> 1:08:13.300
 where the young people interested in quantum gravity

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:16.300
 make a conference, they invite loops and strings

1:08:16.300 --> 1:08:20.540
 and causal dynamical triangulations and causal set people.

1:08:20.540 --> 1:08:24.060
 And we're having a conference like this next week,

1:08:24.060 --> 1:08:26.980
 a small workshop at perimeter.

1:08:26.980 --> 1:08:28.380
 And I guess I'm advertising this.

1:08:28.380 --> 1:08:30.500
 And then in the summer,

1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:33.460
 we're having a big full on conference,

1:08:33.460 --> 1:08:34.900
 which is just quantum gravity.

1:08:34.900 --> 1:08:37.260
 It's not strings, it's not loops.

1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:39.420
 But the organizers and the speakers

1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:41.780
 will be from all the different communities.

1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:43.420
 And this to me is very helpful.

1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:49.020
 That the different ideas are coming together.

1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:52.300
 At least people are expressing an interest in that.

1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:56.300
 It's a huge honor talking to you, Lee.

1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:57.700

 One possibility is God is nothing but

1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:39.580
 the power of the universe to organize itself.

1:09:39.580 --> 1:10:05.700
