00:00.320 --> 00:03.240
 The following is a conversation with Josh Barnett,

00:03.240 --> 00:04.760
 one of the greatest fighters

00:04.760 --> 00:06.860
 and submission wrestlers in history,

00:06.860 --> 00:09.720
 with an epic 25 year career

00:09.720 --> 00:12.240
 that includes being the UFC heavyweight champion

00:12.240 --> 00:14.440
 and countless other accolades.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.440
 He also happens to be one of the most intelligent

00:17.440 --> 00:20.960
 and brutally honest human beings in all of martial arts,

00:20.960 --> 00:24.080
 and especially so about his appreciation of

00:24.080 --> 00:27.120
 and fascination with violence.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:29.120 --> 00:32.120
 which feels ridiculous to say after that introduction.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.280
 Mung Pak low carb snacks,

00:34.280 --> 00:36.300
 Element electrolyte drinks,

00:36.300 --> 00:38.360
 Eight Sleep self cooling mattress,

00:38.360 --> 00:40.980
 and Rev transcription and captioning service.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.000
 As a side note, let me say that I've been a fan

00:47.000 --> 00:49.140
 of Josh Barnett for a long time.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.040
 This conversation was indeed a long time coming,

00:52.040 --> 00:54.440
 and I'm sure we'll talk many times again.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.240
 For what it's worth, I'm a student of combat sports

00:57.240 --> 01:00.040
 and admire when they're done at the highest level,

01:00.040 --> 01:02.800
 either through masterful execution of skill

01:02.800 --> 01:05.800
 or relentless dominance of pure guts.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.400
 For context, I'm a black belt in Jiu Jitsu

01:08.400 --> 01:10.960
 and have competed in wrestling, submission grappling,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.780
 Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and even catch wrestling,

01:13.780 --> 01:15.640
 which is a variant of submission grappling

01:15.640 --> 01:18.520
 that Josh is one of the great practitioners,

01:18.520 --> 01:20.540
 scholars and teachers of.

01:20.540 --> 01:21.840
 I could probably talk for hours

01:21.840 --> 01:24.240
 about what I've learned from my time on the mat,

01:24.240 --> 01:26.000
 but if I were to say one thing,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.600
 it is that the mat is honest.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.400
 You can't run away from yourself when you step on the mat.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.760
 It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself,

01:34.760 --> 01:38.160
 all the delusions you might have, or at least I had,

01:38.160 --> 01:40.760
 that there's anything in this world that can be achieved

01:40.760 --> 01:43.620
 except through blood, sweat, and tears.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.280
 That honesty, taken to the highest levels,

01:46.280 --> 01:47.880
 as is the case with Josh,

01:47.880 --> 01:50.160
 creates the most special of human beings

01:50.160 --> 01:53.260
 and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to.

 And now, here's my conversation with Josh Barnett.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.420
 Who were the philosophers and philosophical ideas

02:10.420 --> 02:11.620
 that influenced you the most?

02:11.620 --> 02:12.940
 Are we just jumping right in?

02:12.940 --> 02:14.140
 That's it. We're right in.

02:14.140 --> 02:17.180
 We're not, no foreplay on camera, all right.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.860
 I had an interesting philosophical journey,

02:19.860 --> 02:21.180
 at least I think it's interesting,

02:21.180 --> 02:26.180
 and that was, I think, as far as organized philosophy

02:27.500 --> 02:31.780
 or maybe, authentic's not the right word,

02:31.780 --> 02:33.900
 but like, yeah, we'll say organized.

02:35.880 --> 02:40.500
 I would say that Nietzsche is probably one of the people

02:40.500 --> 02:43.360
 with the most influence on me,

02:43.360 --> 02:46.360
 but I also feel like, to a degree,

02:46.360 --> 02:50.540
 your personality will oftentimes dictate

02:50.540 --> 02:53.500
 what philosophers that you can vibe with, yeah.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.660
 So what ideas from Nietzsche, was it the Ubermensch?

02:56.660 --> 02:58.740
 Definitely the Ubermensch is huge to me

02:58.740 --> 03:00.900
 because I see it as an extension

03:00.900 --> 03:04.580
 of basically the religious concepts of God

03:04.580 --> 03:06.740
 and higher ideals,

03:06.740 --> 03:09.700
 but just put into a different, a secular context.

03:09.700 --> 03:14.660
 And the idea also that the Ubermensch is striving

03:14.660 --> 03:17.500
 and overcoming something that you're always working towards

03:17.500 --> 03:20.180
 that very few will ever,

03:20.180 --> 03:25.180
 it's not like the concept that you can just make them.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.820
 It doesn't happen that way.

03:26.820 --> 03:30.860
 And it's not based simply upon if you were, say,

03:30.860 --> 03:32.220
 put through a genetic program

03:32.220 --> 03:34.660
 and turned into a super soldier,

03:34.660 --> 03:36.460
 like that wouldn't make it.

03:36.460 --> 03:40.060
 That's like the very surface level

03:40.060 --> 03:42.380
 and incorrect understanding of what the Ubermensch is.

03:42.380 --> 03:46.620
 The Ubermensch is the idea of this kind of human

03:46.620 --> 03:51.620
 that transcends all the weaker, lower aspects of humans,

03:52.100 --> 03:53.260
 which we're full of.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.860
 But I also think that there's an element in Nietzsche's

03:55.860 --> 03:58.340
 writing that suggests that it's not something

03:58.340 --> 04:01.220
 you can even be in all the time.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.380
 Like it's even a temporary state

04:03.380 --> 04:04.420
 because it's not something

04:04.420 --> 04:05.980
 that we're capable of maintaining.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.420
 It's something to strive for.

04:07.420 --> 04:12.420
 Like a morality, an image, an ideal, a set of principles

04:12.420 --> 04:16.060
 that we can connect to that doesn't rely on

04:16.060 --> 04:19.300
 otherworldly kind of out there things.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.580
 It's deeply human.

04:20.580 --> 04:23.580
 With Nietzsche, I feel like the concept of the Ubermensch

04:25.420 --> 04:28.860
 is something built on authenticity as well.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.260
 Heidegger was like Dasein, right?

04:30.260 --> 04:32.460
 So when you are authentic

04:32.460 --> 04:35.660
 and Heidegger being a follower of Nietzsche's

04:35.660 --> 04:37.460
 and highly influenced by him,

04:38.460 --> 04:41.420
 I think that the Ubermensch is an example of authenticity

04:41.420 --> 04:45.220
 in that it isn't about trying to be anything

04:45.220 --> 04:50.100
 that you cannot be or to go against who you are,

04:50.100 --> 04:52.860
 but to actually understand that, accept that,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.820
 and then work with what you can work with

04:54.820 --> 04:59.820
 and create from your lump of clay that is you.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.660
 Because I can't become...

05:04.380 --> 05:05.940
 There's certain things that are just not gonna happen

05:05.940 --> 05:07.460
 for me because it's not in my proclivity.

05:07.460 --> 05:09.500
 I mean, I'm never gonna be five foot tall

05:09.500 --> 05:14.420
 and 120 pounds, I mean, that again, I guess.

05:14.420 --> 05:19.420
 But I know, as you get more in tune with who you are,

05:20.940 --> 05:24.180
 as you start learning more about what unique things

05:24.180 --> 05:27.900
 or at least what that combination that makes you,

05:27.900 --> 05:29.940
 that gestalt part of yourself,

05:29.940 --> 05:32.220
 what those things are and how you can use them,

05:32.220 --> 05:35.500
 then you can work towards being that,

05:35.500 --> 05:38.220
 taking what that is and seeing if you can

05:38.220 --> 05:39.580
 get to that point.

05:39.580 --> 05:42.020
 Now, the likelihood is, no, maybe, probably never.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.140
 I mean, but we can never achieve Godhood yet.

05:44.140 --> 05:47.140
 Religion is a constant striving

05:47.140 --> 05:50.420
 and a look at a higher ideal concept.

05:50.420 --> 05:52.580
 Even if it's multiple gods or one God,

05:52.580 --> 05:56.180
 it's still essentially all built around this concept.

05:56.180 --> 05:59.980
 I like the idea of Catholics original sin.

05:59.980 --> 06:01.460
 If you think of sin, not as evil,

06:01.460 --> 06:04.940
 but as missing the mark, the archer's term where it derives,

06:04.940 --> 06:07.220
 or even like in Spanish,

06:07.220 --> 06:09.340
 you know, without.

06:09.340 --> 06:13.020
 So as being, if you accept that you are imperfect,

06:13.020 --> 06:15.380
 if you accept that you need to constantly strive

06:15.380 --> 06:16.700
 even against yourself,

06:16.700 --> 06:19.540
 because you will figure out the best ways

06:19.540 --> 06:22.340
 at which to submarine your own capabilities,

06:22.340 --> 06:25.380
 submarine your own dreams and wishes and whatever,

06:25.380 --> 06:27.220
 you will ruin them more than anything else.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.140
 And you will tell yourself that you ruined them on purpose

06:30.140 --> 06:32.500
 for a good reason, or you'll say that you'll figure out

06:32.500 --> 06:35.540
 a way to put it on everything else but yourself.

06:35.540 --> 06:38.620
 And so the idea of thinking of,

06:38.620 --> 06:41.380
 well, as I'm starting off on this whole thing,

06:41.380 --> 06:43.540
 I got a lot of work to do, and that's just the way it is.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.900
 And I gotta figure out what areas those are gonna be.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.980
 And so, you know, I thought, oh yeah,

06:47.980 --> 06:50.620
 if I think of original sin actually can be,

06:50.620 --> 06:52.340
 that can be kind of a clever idea,

06:52.340 --> 06:55.020
 but it's also just accepting that

06:56.020 --> 07:01.020
 we're all uniquely strange and unequal in our own ways,

07:01.060 --> 07:02.940
 but we have to figure out how that fits in.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.820
 The word authenticity kind of connects to all of that.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.780
 So striving to be your authentic self means

07:08.780 --> 07:11.540
 figuring out exactly the shape of the flaws,

07:11.540 --> 07:15.820
 the character of your little demons that you get to play with

07:15.820 --> 07:18.700
 and around them finding a path to whatever the hell

07:20.220 --> 07:22.460
 ideal versions of yourself you can carve

07:22.460 --> 07:25.420
 and pretending like that's such a thing as even possible.

07:25.420 --> 07:29.620
 The other idea about Nietzsche is on his idea of morality.

07:29.620 --> 07:33.860
 He presents the argument that morality is a human illusion

07:33.860 --> 07:37.420
 and that there's not such a thing as good and evil,

07:37.420 --> 07:39.420
 and these are all kind of constructs.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.540
 Do you think there's such a thing as good and evil

07:42.540 --> 07:44.820
 that's connected to some objective reality?

07:44.820 --> 07:47.620
 I think that there are some,

07:47.620 --> 07:49.900
 I actually do believe that there are some universals.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.500
 I'm not Kantian in any way,

07:51.500 --> 07:53.380
 but I do think that there are some universals.

07:53.380 --> 07:54.700
 And the thing that actually brought me

07:54.700 --> 07:57.020
 to even the concept of that was Jung.

07:57.020 --> 08:02.020
 So Jung's concept of collective unconsciousness

08:02.300 --> 08:04.900
 and then taking that thought

08:04.900 --> 08:08.380
 and then applying it to looking through history

08:08.380 --> 08:11.700
 and the most varied history you can find.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.100
 So I would say probably religion is your earliest one

08:15.100 --> 08:17.380
 that you can get for written history

08:17.380 --> 08:22.380
 or written examples of human behavior and psychology

08:22.380 --> 08:27.380
 at the furthest that we can look into it from man's hand

08:29.380 --> 08:32.620
 to whatever the medium is, cuneiform or whatever.

08:32.620 --> 08:34.620
 But as you do that, and then let's say going

08:34.620 --> 08:39.620
 from Mesopotamia to India to Europe

08:39.660 --> 08:41.740
 and just going from all these places,

08:41.740 --> 08:43.500
 as disparate as they may seem,

08:43.500 --> 08:45.780
 as many different cultures and ethnicities and religions

08:45.780 --> 08:47.700
 and how the religions will vary quite a bit

08:47.700 --> 08:52.700
 from monotheist to polytheist and so on and so forth.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.780
 But then just seeing how there's all the through lines.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.900
 And of course, Campbell, he did this

08:58.900 --> 09:01.780
 much earlier than me thinking about it.

09:01.780 --> 09:06.780
 But I think that by looking at things that way

09:07.180 --> 09:08.660
 and starting to find the threads

09:08.660 --> 09:10.500
 instead of always just looking at everything

09:10.500 --> 09:12.940
 as being its own compartmentalized concept

09:12.940 --> 09:16.060
 as if it only applies to this time, this people,

09:16.060 --> 09:18.580
 like getting overly pomo about it

09:18.580 --> 09:21.540
 is just a really idiotic postmodern.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.500
 So you think that there is, just like with Joseph Campbell,

09:24.500 --> 09:28.020
 there's a thread that connects all of these stories,

09:28.020 --> 09:30.980
 narratives that we constructed for ourselves as we evolve.

09:30.980 --> 09:35.260
 And that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas

09:35.260 --> 09:37.660
 of maybe on the morality side,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.380
 which is the trickiest one of good and evil.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.660
 Somewhat, yeah, I think that a lot of this stuff

09:41.660 --> 09:44.300
 is just derived from a biological perspective.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.380
 I feel like these things are innate within us.

09:47.380 --> 09:50.740
 Do you think our innately humans are good?

09:50.740 --> 09:52.820
 No, I don't.

09:52.820 --> 09:56.420
 I feel like, I also feel like there's the issue of scale too.

09:56.420 --> 10:01.300
 Like Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his,

10:01.300 --> 10:05.260
 the way he interacts with groups in terms of scale.

10:05.260 --> 10:08.300
 What is this thing about like at the familial level,

10:08.300 --> 10:12.060
 I'm a communist and then at the civic level,

10:12.060 --> 10:14.700
 I'm a Republican or something.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.020
 And at this other level,

10:16.020 --> 10:17.540
 and then it goes on at the widest level,

10:17.540 --> 10:20.100
 he's a libertarian or something of that nature.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.580
 Like fundamentally human interaction changes.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.740
 On scale. On scale.

10:23.740 --> 10:28.540
 And scale and also from subjective

10:28.540 --> 10:29.740
 to the environment around them.

10:29.740 --> 10:31.460
 So, and I don't even mean environment

10:31.460 --> 10:35.060
 just in the sake of physical environment, nature, right?

10:35.060 --> 10:36.660
 Like nature is constantly trying to murder you.

10:36.660 --> 10:37.780
 Well, it's not really trying.

10:37.780 --> 10:39.740
 It's just nature's being nature.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.140
 The universe is the universe.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.740
 And at times it takes you out.

10:43.740 --> 10:48.740
 It's just not with any particular compunction or prejudice.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.780
 It's just, oops, you know, sorry, there's no more dodos.

10:52.780 --> 10:53.820
 My bad.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.540
 But don't you think the particular flavor

10:55.540 --> 11:00.140
 of the complexity that is the human mind was created,

11:00.140 --> 11:02.180
 like let me make an argument

11:02.180 --> 11:04.860
 for that all people are fundamentally good.

11:04.860 --> 11:05.780
 Okay.

11:05.780 --> 11:08.900
 Is there's an evolutionary advantage

11:08.900 --> 11:13.060
 to being, to striving to cooperate,

11:13.060 --> 11:16.900
 to add more love to the world of like compassion, empathy,

11:16.900 --> 11:18.100
 all that kind of stuff.

11:18.100 --> 11:22.820
 And that the very thing that created the human mind

11:22.820 --> 11:25.700
 was this evolutionary advantage,

11:25.700 --> 11:28.180
 whatever the forces behind this evolutionary advantage.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.660
 And scale, yes.

11:29.660 --> 11:33.380
 So when we're dealing with a small tribe, sure.

11:33.380 --> 11:36.500
 When you meet another tribe, maybe.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.940
 There's other factors that are going into that.

11:38.940 --> 11:41.300
 Let's say you scale up.

11:41.300 --> 11:46.100
 And so your 150 has exceeded their 150.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.500
 And like, you start to get to a certain point

11:48.500 --> 11:53.500
 where you can't really be close enough

11:54.220 --> 11:56.900
 to someone down the line of some of that next,

11:56.900 --> 11:58.980
 like that 150 is 150, 150.

11:58.980 --> 12:03.980
 And they just now all of a sudden become some guy, whatever.

12:03.980 --> 12:08.060
 And when it comes to some guy, once it starts hitting scale,

12:08.060 --> 12:10.660
 I don't know that it's capable.

12:12.260 --> 12:17.260
 People can be as magnanimous to a stranger as to the known.

12:19.620 --> 12:23.020
 If they orient themselves to be secure enough,

12:23.020 --> 12:25.260
 because it does come to security, insecurity

12:25.260 --> 12:28.260
 in one way or the other, either brought on by the unknown,

12:28.260 --> 12:30.500
 brought on by an actual threat,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.100
 brought on by even their own,

12:32.100 --> 12:34.340
 as we would use the word insecurity in that

12:34.340 --> 12:36.620
 their own insecurity within their own capabilities,

12:36.620 --> 12:38.420
 their own belief in themselves,

12:38.420 --> 12:41.540
 all these things can change things

12:41.540 --> 12:44.820
 from being compassionate and what have you

12:44.820 --> 12:47.780
 to at least at the very least, maybe not evil,

12:47.780 --> 12:52.780
 but self interest driven to the point of a negative results

12:53.140 --> 12:55.460
 for those that aren't, you know what I mean?

12:55.460 --> 12:56.500
 Right.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.820
 But another way to frame that is maybe it's less about scale

13:00.820 --> 13:02.860
 and more about the amount of resources available.

13:02.860 --> 13:06.220
 So if we're overflowing with resources

13:06.220 --> 13:09.940
 in terms of security and safety,

13:09.940 --> 13:12.380
 all the things you've mentioned,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.060
 if we have more than enough resources,

13:15.060 --> 13:16.740
 then the way we treat a stranger,

13:16.740 --> 13:19.420
 the way we position ourselves towards that stranger

13:19.420 --> 13:24.420
 might be in a way that allows us to be our real human selves

13:25.700 --> 13:27.860
 as opposed to sort of our animal self.

13:27.860 --> 13:29.780
 And therefore it's mostly about

13:29.780 --> 13:32.540
 how clever can we descendants of Abe's be

13:32.540 --> 13:35.620
 in coming up with all cool kinds of technologies

13:35.620 --> 13:39.300
 and ways to efficiently use the resources we have

13:39.300 --> 13:40.980
 such that we're not constrained.

13:40.980 --> 13:45.980
 And my hope is that human innovation

13:46.580 --> 13:49.580
 will outpace the growth of our,

13:49.580 --> 13:52.980
 the number of people that are starving for resources.

13:52.980 --> 13:56.900
 Yes, I think that there's a lot of rationality

13:56.900 --> 13:59.100
 behind this argument.

13:59.100 --> 14:04.100
 And in some ways I agree and in a lot of ways

14:04.620 --> 14:09.620
 I see it as missing the point

14:09.860 --> 14:13.300
 of how this experiment has been playing out across time.

14:13.300 --> 14:18.300
 When you look at what, for one, it's like define resources.

14:18.460 --> 14:23.460
 What is a resource of as humans would define it, right?

14:25.540 --> 14:26.860
 Or wealth even.

14:26.860 --> 14:31.220
 And so you can say, well, an iPhone's a resource,

14:31.220 --> 14:34.940
 the internet's a resource, water obviously is a resource.

14:34.940 --> 14:38.020
 But if we weigh them, what is more important

14:38.020 --> 14:41.500
 to human beings, water, internet or iPhones?

14:41.500 --> 14:42.620
 It's water, right?

14:42.620 --> 14:46.220
 So if we look at resources, if we start with

14:46.220 --> 14:48.700
 what do human beings need to live?

14:48.700 --> 14:52.340
 I mean, actually live, not live here

14:52.340 --> 14:56.260
 in this bullshit fantasy creation extension

14:56.260 --> 14:59.860
 of our own ingenuity and a prison of our own creation

14:59.860 --> 15:02.220
 and also a paradise of our own creation.

15:02.220 --> 15:04.980
 But this is not how human beings normally live.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.740
 This is all built upon stuff,

15:06.740 --> 15:11.740
 it's built on concept, on idea and some of it's built

15:12.740 --> 15:15.860
 on just, well, this is the paradigm so this is what you do.

15:15.860 --> 15:19.740
 Human beings need food, they need water to survive,

15:19.740 --> 15:22.580
 they need shelter from the elements

15:22.580 --> 15:26.460
 and they need certain skills to perpetuate these things

15:26.460 --> 15:28.660
 and be able to pass them down so that they can,

15:28.660 --> 15:30.820
 so that these things don't become,

15:32.180 --> 15:34.420
 you don't end up in this gap where you have

15:34.420 --> 15:37.780
 to relearn things because if it's lost,

15:37.780 --> 15:41.620
 then that time before you can get it back again

15:41.620 --> 15:44.780
 is going to be dark ages of sorts

15:44.780 --> 15:48.220
 or it's going to be highly detrimental to your group

15:48.220 --> 15:51.500
 because not knowing how to fish, not knowing how to hunt,

15:51.500 --> 15:55.140
 not knowing how to even clean and cook the game

15:55.140 --> 15:58.380
 once you have it could be lethal.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.700
 That's fascinating to think of that as a basic resource,

16:00.700 --> 16:04.020
 the knowledge to attain the very low level things of water.

16:04.020 --> 16:05.500
 Right, and we'll figure it out.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.860
 We did it once before and we've done it over

16:07.860 --> 16:09.540
 and over and over and over again.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.020
 It's just costly.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.220
 Yes, it has costs for sure.

16:14.500 --> 16:19.500
 But when you think of how you look at the,

16:19.500 --> 16:23.100
 well, we'll just deal with the first world of the West.

16:23.100 --> 16:28.100
 You look at the pathway of Western civilization

16:29.260 --> 16:32.380
 and its growth and then you look at how technology

16:32.380 --> 16:34.500
 injected into it over time,

16:34.500 --> 16:38.660
 how it magnifies things or pushes things

16:38.660 --> 16:41.380
 at orders of magnitude faster

16:41.380 --> 16:43.900
 and then the internet comes along and even faster.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.580
 So you're watching industrial revolution to,

16:46.580 --> 16:50.300
 what is it, the capacitor and then so on.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.540
 It goes further and further.

16:51.540 --> 16:54.340
 And as the internet and technology,

16:54.340 --> 16:56.740
 especially on the electronic side of things,

16:56.740 --> 16:59.140
 start increasing in capability,

16:59.140 --> 17:04.140
 it massively outpaces even our necessity for it at times.

17:04.860 --> 17:08.340
 It becomes, you know, plant obsolescence happens quicker

17:08.340 --> 17:10.100
 and over and over and over again

17:10.100 --> 17:13.060
 and wealth increases, increases, increases, increases

17:13.060 --> 17:16.380
 in terms of the things that we're able to acquire, right?

17:16.380 --> 17:19.340
 I mean, I've seen homeless people with smartphones,

17:19.340 --> 17:23.660
 you know, so we're living in the most wealth laden,

17:23.660 --> 17:28.620
 luxury laden age of all of humanity yet.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.580
 What happens when we see calamity

17:32.580 --> 17:33.980
 or people go on hard time?

17:33.980 --> 17:36.420
 What are the things that they value?

17:36.420 --> 17:38.740
 You know, what do people go to an argument

17:38.740 --> 17:41.740
 about the cost of things that are luxury items generally

17:41.740 --> 17:44.380
 and not necessity items?

17:44.380 --> 17:49.380
 You know, we get into fights about things that are

17:50.380 --> 17:53.140
 at the end of the day, not necessities to us.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.900
 You know, people are so concerned about Netflix

17:55.900 --> 17:58.060
 and the internet and personally,

17:58.060 --> 17:59.700
 I'm very concerned about the internet

17:59.700 --> 18:02.620
 because I look at it as my own little personal library

18:02.620 --> 18:05.060
 of Alexandria in my pocket.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.020
 That's what I love about it.

18:06.020 --> 18:09.020
 And the ability to have a tool as effective as it is,

18:09.020 --> 18:10.740
 even though I'm in a constant battle

18:10.740 --> 18:13.860
 to not let that tool become a vice

18:13.860 --> 18:17.100
 or to become something that actually

18:17.100 --> 18:19.020
 brings me to a lower state.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.900
 But are we willing, the question is over the,

18:21.900 --> 18:24.780
 are we willing to murder each other over Netflix

18:24.780 --> 18:27.180
 versus murder each other over water?

18:27.180 --> 18:29.700
 We're willing to murder each other over water.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.740
 That's a given.

18:30.740 --> 18:33.060
 Right, but that's our animalistic selves.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.740
 Well, it's also a necessity for, it's animalistic,

18:35.740 --> 18:38.220
 but it's also either you do it or you don't, right?

18:38.220 --> 18:40.380
 Like unless somebody's willing to share that water

18:40.380 --> 18:44.300
 or if that water is of such a limited capability

18:45.940 --> 18:47.500
 or such a limited amount,

18:47.500 --> 18:50.980
 then you will have to murder to have that water.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.180
 Netflix, the argument is the higher,

18:53.180 --> 18:57.540
 we get up to this hierarchy of what we consider

18:57.540 --> 19:00.300
 in Los Angeles resources,

19:00.300 --> 19:02.940
 we're less willing to be, to commit violence.

19:02.940 --> 19:05.060
 We're less willing to commit violence,

19:05.060 --> 19:06.020
 I would say over Netflix,

19:06.020 --> 19:07.860
 but we are willing to commit violence over Netflix,

19:07.860 --> 19:09.420
 over everything associated with Netflix,

19:09.420 --> 19:11.660
 over televisions, over sneakers,

19:11.660 --> 19:16.660
 over, you know, I mean, when we look at a good,

19:17.940 --> 19:20.060
 I mean, the majority of the stuff

19:20.060 --> 19:21.420
 that came with the riots,

19:21.420 --> 19:26.420
 I mean, it was used car dealerships, targets.

19:26.740 --> 19:28.420
 I mean, and then you look and it's like, well, okay,

19:28.420 --> 19:30.420
 well, what are people, what do they gotta,

19:30.420 --> 19:34.780
 what are they so hell bent to get out of this whole thing?

19:34.780 --> 19:36.660
 And I'm even talking about the ideological elements

19:36.660 --> 19:37.500
 or anything like that.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.860
 Just like, okay, something's going on,

19:38.860 --> 19:41.220
 boom, looting, whatever, you know,

19:41.220 --> 19:42.660
 what are you gonna loot?

19:42.660 --> 19:46.220
 You know, you'll have AOC say, oh, people needing bread.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.340
 I didn't see a single loaf of bread.

19:48.340 --> 19:52.140
 You know, I saw televisions and shoes and you know,

19:52.140 --> 19:54.660
 but to me, it is poetry in a sense,

19:54.660 --> 19:57.860
 because you get to see who we,

19:57.860 --> 20:00.020
 how we actually are operating, you know,

20:00.020 --> 20:03.340
 what is becoming first principles to most people.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.380
 But wait, wait, but you could also argue though,

20:05.380 --> 20:07.620
 those riots were more like the madness of crowds,

20:07.620 --> 20:10.020
 which is definitely a lot more than just that.

20:10.020 --> 20:13.260
 I'm just saying that given a chance, it's like, okay, boom,

20:13.260 --> 20:15.820
 the lights are off, the grid is down.

20:15.820 --> 20:18.700
 We've hacked into the whole system,

20:18.700 --> 20:19.860
 turned into an 80s movie.

20:19.860 --> 20:24.820
 And you have the ability to go get ahold of whatever it is

20:24.820 --> 20:26.500
 that you think is most important.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.660
 And what do we do?

20:27.660 --> 20:30.580
 And I say, we, as in, you know, including all of us,

20:30.580 --> 20:32.980
 we grab a TV, we attack it.

20:32.980 --> 20:35.260
 We break into a sneaker store in Melrose.

20:35.260 --> 20:39.780
 We do, it's just like, ah, we still giant cause statues

20:39.780 --> 20:43.140
 where the value of that is completely market driven.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.940
 Like it's just a piece of polypropylene or whatever,

20:45.940 --> 20:48.260
 butyl and you know, it's cool.

20:48.260 --> 20:51.700
 I'm a big fan of art, but it's like,

20:53.460 --> 20:54.780
 you know, I can't eat that.

20:54.780 --> 20:56.220
 And at the end of the day, man,

20:56.220 --> 20:57.780
 you're sitting there with your, like,

20:57.780 --> 20:58.740
 what'd you do today, honey?

20:58.740 --> 20:59.580
 What'd you get?

20:59.580 --> 21:01.260
 You know, man, we were able to, you know,

21:01.260 --> 21:04.180
 oh, I got this, I got this designer art statue.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.780
 Are you going to go, well, you can't really sell it

21:07.780 --> 21:09.460
 on the, on like the art markets

21:09.460 --> 21:10.740
 where people were really going to pay for it.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.980
 So are you going to become an underground art dealer

21:12.980 --> 21:15.060
 with your one piece of cause art?

21:15.060 --> 21:17.460
 One interesting thing you just said before I forget it,

21:17.460 --> 21:21.180
 you mentioned the library of Alexandria and your.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.340
 Phone.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.100
 Well, your phone, but also just thinking

21:25.100 --> 21:27.220
 of your little world that you're creating

21:27.220 --> 21:28.300
 for yourself on the internet.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.580
 That's a really powerful way to actually phrase it.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.380
 One of the things that you've been on Joe Rogan

21:33.380 --> 21:34.220
 several times.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.460
 Although everybody always comes to me and go,

21:35.460 --> 21:36.300
 oh, that was so great.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.420
 I didn't know you, you're on, you've on Joe Rogan.

21:38.420 --> 21:40.260
 I go, this is like my fifth time, dude.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.140
 I've been a fan of yours for a long time

21:42.140 --> 21:45.180
 from other avenues.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.740
 This is a long time coming actually.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.140
 Everybody, you have no idea.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.620
 Like how many times through messaging

21:51.620 --> 21:54.020
 and missing each other over the years.

21:54.020 --> 21:54.860
 This is ridiculous.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.140
 This is a long time coming.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.140
 You don't realize how special this is for us.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.020
 This is, well, I'm also starstruck.

22:00.020 --> 22:00.940
 We'll talk about this,

22:00.940 --> 22:04.020
 but you symbolize something very important to me

22:04.020 --> 22:06.460
 through my journey, through wrestling,

22:06.460 --> 22:08.220
 through Jiu Jitsu, through Judo,

22:08.220 --> 22:11.420
 through just street fighting, through just combat.

22:11.420 --> 22:14.060
 There's a, you're the, in some sense,

22:14.060 --> 22:17.660
 the devil on my shoulder of like, of violence.

22:17.660 --> 22:22.260
 In a good, in a, devil gets a bad rap.

22:22.260 --> 22:23.260
 He does get a bad rap.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.980
 I realize, you know, sitting encased in ice

22:25.980 --> 22:28.220
 down at that low ass level, you know.

22:28.220 --> 22:29.060
 Yeah.

22:29.060 --> 22:32.700
 But, you know, the angel side is more like the athletic,

22:32.700 --> 22:35.500
 the sport, the science, the technical,

22:35.500 --> 22:36.540
 the chess side of things.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.620
 So, but on the library, Alexander, let me ask,

22:41.660 --> 22:43.220
 because you were on Joe Rogan,

22:44.340 --> 22:46.380
 it does make me really sad.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.540
 And I realize that I'm just probably being romantic

22:48.540 --> 22:53.260
 that his, most of his library of interviews

22:53.260 --> 22:56.660
 that were on YouTube have now been taken down

22:56.660 --> 22:58.300
 because he went to Spotify.

22:58.300 --> 23:00.420
 And that was the first, I'm probably an idiot,

23:00.420 --> 23:03.020
 but it was the first time I realized

23:03.020 --> 23:05.220
 that this knowledge that we've been building up

23:05.220 --> 23:08.340
 on the internet doesn't necessarily last forever.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.420
 No, it doesn't, unless you preserve it.

23:10.420 --> 23:11.820
 I mean, it's like all things.

23:11.820 --> 23:16.620
 If you do not preserve them, if you do not make efforts,

23:16.620 --> 23:19.260
 you know, so many of my, it just really brings

23:19.260 --> 23:20.660
 the minor off the top of my head.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.620
 All my, so many friends of mine that are Jewish,

23:25.140 --> 23:27.420
 you know, they're basically secular.

23:27.420 --> 23:31.700
 But yet through even the secular aspect

23:31.700 --> 23:33.660
 of just keeping the traditions alive, it's like,

23:33.660 --> 23:37.060
 well, you could always pick a book and read about it.

23:37.060 --> 23:39.380
 Clearly, it's called the Torah.

23:39.380 --> 23:44.340
 But if you don't put these things into action,

23:44.340 --> 23:48.580
 if you don't make them a part of your consciousness,

23:48.580 --> 23:50.220
 maybe even on the subconsciousness,

23:50.220 --> 23:53.620
 just through repetition, they will die.

23:53.620 --> 23:57.140
 They will become simply something that exists somewhere

23:57.140 --> 23:58.980
 until you find it again.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.780
 And Carl Gotch used to say something,

24:02.020 --> 24:03.900
 he would say that I don't invent moves,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.780
 I just rediscover them.

24:05.780 --> 24:10.460
 But yet Gotch and Billy Robinson also would understand

24:11.380 --> 24:15.820
 that you, if someone's not carrying the torch,

24:15.820 --> 24:16.780
 it'll go out.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.740
 Now that doesn't mean fire can't be rekindled.

24:18.740 --> 24:21.780
 It just means that it, that torch no longer

24:21.780 --> 24:24.340
 is lighting the way on this knowledge.

24:24.340 --> 24:29.340
 And so it's important to be an individual,

24:29.980 --> 24:31.460
 even on an individual level,

24:31.460 --> 24:35.740
 to be a repository for aspects of knowledge.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.180
 You mentioned Gotch.

24:37.180 --> 24:42.180
 You consider yourself a catch wrestler.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.020
 So I've mentioned to you offline that I competed

24:47.020 --> 24:49.180
 in a couple of catch wrestling tournaments.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.300
 Can we go Wikipedia level at the very basic,

24:52.300 --> 24:54.340
 you're the exactly right person to ask,

24:54.340 --> 24:56.340
 what is catch wrestling?

24:56.340 --> 24:58.580
 And what are its defining principles?

24:58.580 --> 25:02.660
 I would say the easiest way for us to talk about

25:02.660 --> 25:07.660
 and give an overview of what catch is

25:07.780 --> 25:12.140
 in the simplest terms is think of collegiate wrestling

25:12.140 --> 25:13.820
 with submissions.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.780
 That is essentially what catch is.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.260
 And it's not surprising because collegiate wrestling

25:18.260 --> 25:21.460
 is actually derived from catch as catch can.

25:21.460 --> 25:23.980
 It's just that over time certain aspects

25:23.980 --> 25:28.980
 were removed from the competition structure

25:29.020 --> 25:31.260
 so that they became null elements,

25:31.260 --> 25:33.260
 things that were discarded.

25:33.260 --> 25:36.900
 But it's funny that you can take a high level

25:38.140 --> 25:42.500
 amateur collegiate types and you can show them a move

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
 and then add a little bit to it and go,

25:44.500 --> 25:47.140
 oh, well, hey, that was just like what we already do here,

25:47.140 --> 25:49.740
 but except, oh, I didn't know you could take it

25:49.740 --> 25:50.620
 all the way to this point.

25:50.620 --> 25:53.020
 Or things of that nature,

25:53.020 --> 25:55.340
 especially when it comes to professional wrestling,

25:55.340 --> 25:58.820
 teaching people like, no, I know you're just using this

25:58.820 --> 26:00.740
 in a show, but this is actually a real move

26:00.740 --> 26:02.140
 and here's how it really feels.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.940
 And so collegiate wrestling and wrestling in general

26:04.940 --> 26:07.180
 for people who are not aware is basically

26:07.180 --> 26:10.540
 two people start on their feet and they have to score,

26:10.540 --> 26:12.140
 they're trying to take each other down

26:12.140 --> 26:15.860
 and they score points along the way.

26:15.860 --> 26:18.300
 You can end matches by pinning them,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.440
 for example, on their back.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.340
 I think one way to describe wrestling

26:23.340 --> 26:27.060
 is it's very much about figuring out ways

26:27.060 --> 26:29.160
 to establish control and leverage

26:29.160 --> 26:33.540
 in these kind of tie ups,

26:33.540 --> 26:35.720
 or there's different styles where you can do more

26:35.720 --> 26:38.020
 from a distance to where it's more about the timing

26:38.020 --> 26:39.560
 and all that kind of stuff.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.820
 Ultimately, it's an art of like both upper body

26:42.820 --> 26:45.180
 and lower body and you could choose the different puzzles

26:45.180 --> 26:46.380
 that you solve there.

26:46.380 --> 26:49.580
 You could be attacking the head, the arms,

26:49.580 --> 26:51.400
 you could be attacking the legs.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.180
 There's also part of collegiate wrestling

26:53.180 --> 26:56.340
 that's on the ground that has more,

26:56.340 --> 26:58.740
 what's called like a referee's position or whatever.

26:58.740 --> 27:01.180
 The referee's position where you're on your hands

27:01.180 --> 27:02.460
 and knees basically.

27:02.460 --> 27:04.020
 And so.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.420
 Do you understand what that's supposed to simulate?

27:06.420 --> 27:08.500
 Why is that one of the standard positions?

27:08.500 --> 27:10.540
 It's one of the standard positions because one,

27:10.540 --> 27:13.220
 it's one of the easiest ways to actually get up,

27:13.220 --> 27:15.980
 but two, it's because you cannot be on your back.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.940
 If you're on your back, you're getting pinned.

27:17.940 --> 27:22.100
 And back exposure or being pinned

27:22.100 --> 27:26.860
 is pretty much the universal wrestling thing.

27:26.860 --> 27:30.860
 One, taking the guy from their feet to the floor

27:30.860 --> 27:33.780
 and two, pinning them.

27:33.780 --> 27:36.120
 As you go from like, what is it?

27:37.340 --> 27:42.220
 Cornish wrestling, Turkish oil wrestling, Mongolian, Sumo,

27:43.460 --> 27:46.500
 Indian, well, they'll call it Palwani.

27:46.500 --> 27:51.380
 It's also called Kushti, Jiu Jitsu, Judo.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.740
 So many of them is like, there's a,

27:54.740 --> 27:58.020
 you sombo, even if it doesn't end the match,

27:58.020 --> 28:00.500
 it's still like one of the most important aspects

28:00.500 --> 28:05.220
 of the competition itself, across almost every style.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.860
 And this is where submission, like catch wrestling

28:07.860 --> 28:12.500
 or submission wrestling or Jiu Jitsu feels different,

28:12.500 --> 28:14.980
 which it seems like for most wrestling,

28:14.980 --> 28:19.820
 for a lot of wrestling, the dominance is the goal,

28:20.740 --> 28:23.460
 as opposed to submission,

28:23.460 --> 28:25.340
 which I guess those are two are related,

28:25.340 --> 28:27.340
 but dominating the position.

28:27.340 --> 28:28.420
 So that's what pinning is.

28:28.420 --> 28:31.860
 It's almost like breaking your opponent,

28:32.620 --> 28:36.060
 like breaking through all of their defenses

28:36.060 --> 28:37.580
 to where they're completely defenses

28:37.580 --> 28:39.180
 and you could do anything with them that you want.

28:39.180 --> 28:41.900
 Maybe that's what could be a definition of dominance.

28:41.900 --> 28:42.740
 I don't know.

28:42.740 --> 28:46.500
 I mean, it sounds very much like a chain to a radiator.

28:46.500 --> 28:47.340
 Yeah.

28:48.740 --> 28:52.340
 Yeah, there's a threat that connects all runners,

28:52.340 --> 28:54.260
 but submission feels different.

28:55.580 --> 28:57.300
 It is actually different when you think about it

28:57.300 --> 28:58.940
 across the landscape.

28:58.940 --> 29:00.220
 I don't think radically different,

29:00.220 --> 29:01.580
 but just still slightly different.

29:01.580 --> 29:03.900
 And that if you think of wrestling

29:03.900 --> 29:07.620
 as being derived from combat, right?

29:07.620 --> 29:11.940
 So, well, it is combat sports, but more lethal combat.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.540
 Getting somebody off their feet and onto their back

29:14.540 --> 29:15.940
 is about as lethal a place

29:15.940 --> 29:18.500
 for the person on bottom to be in general.

29:18.500 --> 29:22.420
 I mean, don't come at me with your talks

29:22.420 --> 29:25.380
 about your fucking worm guards and blah, blah, blah,

29:25.380 --> 29:29.140
 and whatever spider, bear, okay, get out of here with that.

29:29.140 --> 29:30.740
 We're not talking about you

29:30.740 --> 29:34.260
 in this highly regimented sporting environment.

29:34.260 --> 29:37.740
 We're talking about general, all the body hair,

29:37.740 --> 29:39.580
 none of the waxing human beings.

29:39.580 --> 29:44.300
 So getting someone on their back,

29:44.300 --> 29:46.940
 okay, as you're trying to get up,

29:46.940 --> 29:48.620
 you're getting hit with a rock or stabbed

29:48.620 --> 29:52.580
 or what have you set on fire, who knows?

29:52.580 --> 29:55.340
 Generally, these conflicts are not just isolated

29:55.340 --> 29:57.140
 to one on one.

29:57.140 --> 29:58.540
 If it's four on two,

29:58.540 --> 30:01.900
 your buddy that was with you back to back,

30:01.900 --> 30:03.180
 now he's on his back.

30:03.180 --> 30:04.020
 What do you think?

30:04.020 --> 30:06.580
 And now it's gonna be one on one while three go on one.

30:06.580 --> 30:10.900
 So, and then you elevate this to armored combat, right?

30:10.900 --> 30:12.460
 And it's boom, put them on the ground.

30:12.460 --> 30:13.660
 Oh, crap, it's hard to get up.

30:13.660 --> 30:16.260
 Well, while you're struggling to get up, stab.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.820
 That's where jujitsu's concepts come from

30:18.820 --> 30:20.860
 with all their leveraging and off balancing is,

30:20.860 --> 30:23.140
 oh man, if I end up in this situation

30:23.140 --> 30:24.660
 in tight close quarters combat,

30:24.660 --> 30:27.100
 yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives

30:27.100 --> 30:29.820
 and what have you, but it's way easier

30:29.820 --> 30:33.900
 if the first thing I can do is foot sweep you on your back

30:33.900 --> 30:36.340
 and then pull my knife and just go stick.

30:36.340 --> 30:40.020
 Is there a thread that connects all of these different arts

30:40.020 --> 30:45.020
 from not just arts, but from the very base violence of war,

30:45.380 --> 30:47.740
 just like you said that there's no rules

30:47.740 --> 30:52.300
 to the very regimented IBJF.

30:52.300 --> 30:53.140
 I do.

30:53.140 --> 30:54.300
 Jiu Jitsu tournaments and just,

30:54.300 --> 30:55.580
 you've kind of laid out some of it,

30:55.580 --> 30:57.460
 but can you go all the way to the.

30:57.460 --> 31:01.100
 So when you start off with absolute skills

31:01.100 --> 31:04.180
 in the sense of absolute offense and defense

31:04.180 --> 31:07.220
 in the taking or preserving of life, right?

31:07.220 --> 31:12.220
 Full on at its purest form of self defense

31:13.060 --> 31:15.420
 and self preservation, okay?

31:15.420 --> 31:18.620
 And then you extrapolate part of that

31:18.620 --> 31:23.540
 in that all animals train in violence.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.940
 All play usually degenerates

31:25.940 --> 31:27.900
 into some sort of soft violence.

31:27.900 --> 31:30.940
 So be it cats when they're kittens and puppies

31:30.940 --> 31:34.420
 and everything learns how to kill, how to fight.

31:34.420 --> 31:39.420
 Not that, you know, just that dumb alpha meme stuff

31:39.980 --> 31:42.140
 where the idea is that, oh, by being alpha,

31:42.140 --> 31:44.220
 that means you run around like basically just being a bully

31:44.220 --> 31:45.060
 and a shithead.

31:45.060 --> 31:50.060
 No, actually alpha wolves spend very little time fighting

31:50.060 --> 31:52.340
 because if you were actually alpha,

31:52.340 --> 31:55.900
 you don't get into fights, there's no need to.

31:55.900 --> 31:58.380
 And if you're probably getting

31:58.380 --> 32:00.180
 into any large amount of fights,

32:00.180 --> 32:02.660
 it's probably because you're being shitty at being an alpha

32:02.660 --> 32:05.220
 and now people are tired of you being in charge.

32:06.580 --> 32:08.620
 And yet in the animal world,

32:08.620 --> 32:10.660
 and it would be the same for human beings

32:10.660 --> 32:14.460
 at that base beginning level of violence,

32:15.420 --> 32:17.020
 there's a big risk.

32:17.020 --> 32:21.020
 So I know that we live in this place with healthcare

32:21.020 --> 32:23.980
 or you might be in a place with nationalized health,

32:23.980 --> 32:24.820
 whatever, right?

32:24.820 --> 32:29.820
 So there's band aids, there's penicillin,

32:30.140 --> 32:32.380
 there's all that kind of stuff.

32:32.380 --> 32:36.820
 But that's not the normal way of things, you know?

32:36.820 --> 32:40.540
 Yeah, there's a channel that just hurts me every time.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.980
 I used to follow it and I had to unfollow it

32:42.980 --> 32:44.620
 because it was too painful for me as a human being

32:44.620 --> 32:47.260
 called Nature is Metal on Instagram.

32:47.260 --> 32:51.300
 It was sobering and then it was like, this is too sobering.

32:51.300 --> 32:52.860
 It's very sobering.

32:52.860 --> 32:56.500
 So in there, the risk is at its highest level.

32:56.500 --> 33:01.500
 The damage you take, the winner walks away hurt.

33:02.620 --> 33:06.460
 Getting lamed when you need every aspect

33:06.460 --> 33:10.780
 of your physical and athletic faculties to survive

33:10.780 --> 33:13.900
 because this isn't the first

33:13.900 --> 33:15.540
 and it's definitely not gonna be the last,

33:15.540 --> 33:17.340
 especially if you're the slowest one.

33:17.340 --> 33:22.340
 What is it, there's a lyric from a clutch song.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.780
 Don't go for the fat ones, just go for the slow ones.

33:26.780 --> 33:31.660
 Oh man, but that's the universal truth

33:31.660 --> 33:33.540
 of the way nature works.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.460
 You said it's not cruel, it's not cruel,

33:35.460 --> 33:36.300
 it's just the way it is.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.020
 Yeah, I mean, watch animals getting into fights

33:39.020 --> 33:41.900
 on any of these sort of documentary stuff.

33:41.900 --> 33:46.020
 You'll see an intense short and then dispersal.

33:46.020 --> 33:49.020
 You'll see as soon as one feels like things have switched

33:49.020 --> 33:51.980
 just enough to boom, the bear or whatever it is takes off.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.700
 It's like, I'm done with this.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.380
 Because if you can get out of there with just some scars

33:56.380 --> 33:58.220
 and what have you, okay.

33:58.220 --> 34:01.420
 You lose an eye, nah, it's not as good.

34:01.420 --> 34:04.940
 You really get hurt bad and get infected, you're done.

34:04.940 --> 34:07.780
 So there's a serious risk to be

34:09.140 --> 34:10.820
 that can come with these sort of things.

34:10.820 --> 34:15.820
 Yet, I believe that we are inherently born

34:16.300 --> 34:19.820
 for at least aspects of and use of violence.

34:19.820 --> 34:23.620
 And so at the end of the day, we need these things

34:23.620 --> 34:26.180
 not just to, not just survive each other,

34:26.180 --> 34:30.420
 but they're a part of being able to hunt and other things.

34:31.580 --> 34:33.300
 So violence is a part of human nature.

34:33.300 --> 34:36.060
 Violence is, it's an absolute.

34:36.060 --> 34:38.700
 It is in every person, it is a part of every interaction,

34:38.700 --> 34:41.660
 it is a part of every law, everything.

34:41.660 --> 34:43.900
 And I'm not, by the way, I'm not an ANCAP.

34:43.900 --> 34:47.060
 So don't even, don't hit your wagon to me on that one.

34:47.060 --> 34:50.700
 ANCAP is anarchic capitalist. Anarchic capitalist, yes.

34:50.700 --> 34:52.420
 Not an ANCAP.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.420
 They have nice book shops.

34:54.420 --> 34:55.260
 Yeah, they do.

34:55.260 --> 34:59.460
 I mean, I'm not gonna sit here and shit talk ANCAPs.

34:59.460 --> 35:01.540
 Although I also used to get into the conversations

35:01.540 --> 35:06.540
 with an ANCOM, anarcho communist, a good friend of mine.

35:06.540 --> 35:09.380
 And he would bring up this stuff and I'm like,

35:09.380 --> 35:11.980
 yeah, cool, man, I'm down with anarchy.

35:11.980 --> 35:13.540
 You ain't gonna like it.

35:13.540 --> 35:14.380
 What do you mean?

35:14.380 --> 35:15.580
 I go, cause I'm gonna take all,

35:15.580 --> 35:17.220
 I'm gonna gather all kinds of people together.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.020
 I'm gonna make this, I'm gonna get the strongest together

35:19.020 --> 35:20.780
 and I'm going to take your shit.

35:20.780 --> 35:23.620
 Okay, can I ask you on that topic,

35:23.620 --> 35:25.860
 I have a friend of mine now,

35:27.220 --> 35:32.220
 a fellow Russian, Ukrainian, Michael Malice.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.060
 Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with Michael Malice.

35:34.060 --> 35:35.540
 I watched a little bit of your guy's show.

35:35.540 --> 35:38.620
 I watched a little bit of your guy's conversation.

35:38.620 --> 35:42.540
 So this is really good to ask you because...

35:42.540 --> 35:44.900
 I like how he's in the white suit

35:44.900 --> 35:46.780
 and you're in the white and black.

35:46.780 --> 35:49.540
 But he lives in New York City.

35:49.540 --> 35:54.540
 He espouses ideas of anarchism and his idea,

35:54.940 --> 35:59.940
 and this is different than sort of the Ayn Rand set of ideas

36:00.460 --> 36:02.660
 that there's a line between sort of capitalism

36:02.660 --> 36:05.620
 that's backed by the state and just pure anarchism.

36:06.500 --> 36:11.500
 And his idea that violence won't take over in an anarchism

36:13.020 --> 36:18.020
 is one that feels to me not grounded in reality.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.620
 I may be wrong.

36:19.620 --> 36:24.620
 So is there some, so the idea with pure capitalism is that...

36:24.860 --> 36:27.700
 You mean laissez faire, completely deregulated?

36:27.700 --> 36:28.540
 Yeah.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.260
 Yeah, well, what it will agree, it'll end up in one,

36:31.260 --> 36:34.180
 it'll end up in, if you're anti globalist,

36:34.180 --> 36:35.620
 it's gonna be that.

36:35.620 --> 36:40.060
 It's gonna be globalist 100% because it has no...

36:40.060 --> 36:45.060
 Pure capitalism has no consideration for your native users

36:47.980 --> 36:50.940
 or of any sort, like it doesn't matter.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.220
 But the idea of governments is that the land,

36:53.220 --> 36:56.300
 the little piece of land geographically you're born on

36:56.300 --> 36:57.420
 means you're going to stick

36:57.420 --> 37:01.020
 to whatever founding documents created that little land.

37:01.020 --> 37:04.060
 So anarchism is against that.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.220
 And the argument is you should be able to choose

37:06.220 --> 37:08.980
 which ideas you live with.

37:08.980 --> 37:12.300
 And the concern there is nobody,

37:12.300 --> 37:15.860
 this geographical land, the governments

37:15.860 --> 37:18.020
 that organize on that land

37:19.660 --> 37:21.820
 do not need to protect you from the violence.

37:21.820 --> 37:23.980
 And my sense is there does need to be an army,

37:23.980 --> 37:27.580
 there does need to be police that help,

37:27.580 --> 37:29.420
 however the form that police takes.

37:29.420 --> 37:33.020
 But there needs to be a more centralized,

37:33.020 --> 37:33.980
 not completely centralized,

37:33.980 --> 37:38.260
 but more centralized safety net

37:38.260 --> 37:39.380
 to protect you from the violence.

37:39.380 --> 37:40.460
 Scale again, right?

37:40.460 --> 37:44.780
 So if you want to have your anarchist utopia,

37:44.780 --> 37:46.300
 well, we won't call it utopia,

37:46.300 --> 37:49.140
 your anarchist creation here.

37:50.220 --> 37:52.540
 At certain scale, I'm sure it's doable.

37:54.900 --> 37:58.420
 But as it scales, as the scale increases,

37:58.420 --> 38:00.260
 it's completely untenable.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.060
 And a state will emerge.

38:02.060 --> 38:03.340
 A state will always emerge.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.980
 Because even people always think of states

38:05.980 --> 38:07.860
 as like people rubbing their hands

38:07.860 --> 38:09.700
 and smoking cigars in back rooms

38:09.700 --> 38:11.420
 and just out of nowhere coming around

38:11.420 --> 38:12.620
 and just like, oh, we're going to create

38:12.620 --> 38:13.740
 this big centralized thing

38:13.740 --> 38:15.860
 and just so that we can tell everybody what to do

38:15.860 --> 38:17.900
 and we can be in charge.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.940
 I mean, I know that there are people like that that exist,

38:20.940 --> 38:23.260
 that they would like to do things of that nature

38:23.260 --> 38:26.740
 and that they see the use of power

38:26.740 --> 38:31.740
 as something to be used more for their personal gains

38:32.140 --> 38:36.140
 over first, which again, self interest in human beings.

38:36.140 --> 38:41.140
 But eventually a state, people want,

38:41.220 --> 38:44.340
 they want something to go like, okay,

38:44.340 --> 38:45.420
 who's taking care of this?

38:45.420 --> 38:46.460
 And who's taking care of that?

38:46.460 --> 38:51.460
 And how do we create some sort of protocol for this?

38:53.260 --> 38:55.220
 Like, okay, well, when it's not Bob,

38:55.220 --> 38:56.940
 when is it Susie, when is it whatever?

38:56.940 --> 38:59.740
 I mean, like, how do we, it's gotta get done

38:59.740 --> 39:01.140
 if we want this thing to become bigger,

39:01.140 --> 39:04.540
 if we want all of our plumbing to work right,

39:04.540 --> 39:06.940
 if we want, it's just, I'm sorry, a state's gonna happen.

39:06.940 --> 39:10.740
 A state is also, when you think about it,

39:10.740 --> 39:13.580
 it's supposed to have consideration to tribe, right?

39:13.580 --> 39:15.900
 So if people think that we're not tribes,

39:15.900 --> 39:18.980
 well, you're not really thinking very deeply.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.660
 We're all tribes of a sort.

39:20.660 --> 39:23.980
 And everybody likes to use the word tribalism

39:23.980 --> 39:28.100
 in this idea of this antagonistic concept.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.540
 And while sure, tribalism can be antagonistic,

39:30.540 --> 39:33.500
 tribalism can also be a positive thing,

39:33.500 --> 39:36.100
 or I could just say, it just seems to be a natural thing.

39:36.100 --> 39:40.180
 People, they create their groups of one sort or another.

39:40.180 --> 39:45.180
 And so when you have, well, when you think about

39:45.260 --> 39:47.820
 when nation states really started to become a thing,

39:47.820 --> 39:52.180
 and I don't mean even the more modern looking variants

39:52.180 --> 39:54.660
 that we could think back up and say the 19th century

39:54.660 --> 39:57.500
 or something like that, even older than that.

39:57.500 --> 39:58.500
 I mean, you think the Assyrians

39:58.500 --> 40:00.140
 didn't have a state of some sort?

40:00.140 --> 40:01.060
 Of course they did.

40:02.220 --> 40:05.140
 How do you increase your empire

40:05.140 --> 40:07.340
 if you don't actually have a place to start from?

40:07.340 --> 40:08.180
 Just to be a ruler.

40:08.180 --> 40:09.820
 So you're saying like naturally,

40:09.820 --> 40:13.180
 when you start talking and thinking about scale of humans,

40:13.180 --> 40:16.380
 naturally states emerge.

40:16.380 --> 40:20.780
 And so can we try to make an argument for anarchism,

40:20.780 --> 40:25.780
 which is, so anarchy in a sense is an opposition

40:29.980 --> 40:34.140
 to the unhelpful, unproductive, inefficient bureaucracies

40:34.140 --> 40:37.020
 that eventually the states lead to.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.980
 Yes, and that's what we can see.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.860
 I mean, I would say less anarchy,

40:41.860 --> 40:46.860
 more study James Burnham, you know,

40:46.860 --> 40:51.860
 or, well, anybody that wants to talk

40:52.900 --> 40:55.180
 about the managerial problem and the managerial.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.940
 I see, so you have a sense, a hope,

40:58.940 --> 41:01.300
 maybe let's think like what is the path forward

41:01.300 --> 41:04.140
 with the inefficient state?

41:04.140 --> 41:07.460
 Is it revolution or is it to work within the system

41:07.460 --> 41:09.020
 to constantly improve it, to manage better?

41:09.020 --> 41:10.260
 Man, I don't know that one.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.620
 I mean, my general sense,

41:12.620 --> 41:14.460
 and maybe this is the Nietzschean part of me,

41:14.460 --> 41:18.860
 is that, yeah, it would take maybe not even just,

41:18.860 --> 41:22.060
 maybe not even defining it specifically as revolution.

41:22.060 --> 41:24.980
 Maybe it would just take just total calamity

41:24.980 --> 41:28.220
 to get people to stop being shitty,

41:28.220 --> 41:30.540
 to not stop being a lesser version of themselves,

41:30.540 --> 41:34.140
 to stop thinking more about things

41:34.140 --> 41:37.780
 from the paradigm that we exist in now,

41:37.780 --> 41:39.980
 where we're giving so much value to stuff

41:39.980 --> 41:41.940
 that isn't really all that valuable.

41:41.940 --> 41:45.100
 Where we're so concerned about likes,

41:45.100 --> 41:47.580
 and I don't just mean like whether we get them or not,

41:47.580 --> 41:50.380
 but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off

41:50.380 --> 41:51.220
 of our platform,

41:51.220 --> 41:53.220
 because this is too destabilizing to people.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.860
 Because once you exceed Dunbar's number,

41:54.860 --> 41:56.780
 I think it's actually,

41:56.780 --> 41:59.980
 without having the right faculties,

42:00.940 --> 42:03.380
 which would need to be developed,

42:03.380 --> 42:08.140
 because this is dealing with tech that brings things,

42:08.140 --> 42:12.340
 ways of approaching being that we are not

42:12.340 --> 42:17.340
 naturally programmed to be able to handle appropriately.

42:18.300 --> 42:23.300
 And I think it's even more detrimental to women than men,

42:23.940 --> 42:27.700
 because I think women have a more natural proclivity

42:27.700 --> 42:32.340
 towards group association

42:32.340 --> 42:37.340
 and more group oriented thinking and patterning.

42:38.220 --> 42:41.060
 And now, and with also coupled with

42:42.380 --> 42:47.380
 seemingly more sensitivity towards human states.

42:49.660 --> 42:52.780
 So I feel like women, like the classic idea is like,

42:52.780 --> 42:53.940
 oh, you know, women are psychic,

42:53.940 --> 42:55.380
 you know, they have a sixth sense and what have you.

42:55.380 --> 43:02.380
 And I think that's just a way of simplifying,

43:02.980 --> 43:05.220
 what I think is that women may be more in tune

43:05.220 --> 43:07.540
 with picking up on the unsaid.

43:07.540 --> 43:12.540
 Like they might be better at seeing physical cues,

43:12.700 --> 43:14.220
 inflection and tone, like different,

43:14.220 --> 43:16.540
 like they may be far more sensitive to these things,

43:16.540 --> 43:17.580
 which to me would make sense,

43:17.580 --> 43:22.580
 because dealing with children that can't communicate.

43:22.580 --> 43:27.580
 So distinctively, right now, okay.

43:27.780 --> 43:29.860
 Now, whether it be a woman or a man,

43:29.860 --> 43:34.340
 but especially with even the social push

43:34.340 --> 43:36.300
 on this concept of empathy,

43:36.300 --> 43:37.460
 which of course it gets to the point

43:37.460 --> 43:39.260
 where it loses any meaning anymore.

43:39.260 --> 43:41.060
 Like people use the word empathy

43:41.060 --> 43:42.580
 absolutely incorrectly all the time.

43:42.580 --> 43:44.140
 And they don't even understand

43:44.140 --> 43:47.020
 what you're really asking of people.

43:47.020 --> 43:49.740
 But let's just take it as we're using empathy

43:49.740 --> 43:50.660
 in the correct sense.

43:50.660 --> 43:53.700
 And you're taking on the emotional content

43:53.700 --> 43:55.300
 of the thing itself.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.940
 Now you open that up to thousands of people,

43:57.940 --> 44:01.420
 maybe hundreds of thousands of people all across the world

44:01.420 --> 44:03.340
 that you will never meet, that you will never know,

44:03.340 --> 44:06.660
 that you're not even getting an actual true representation

44:06.660 --> 44:08.420
 most of the time of who these people are.

44:08.420 --> 44:09.900
 You're meeting persona.

44:10.860 --> 44:15.700
 And some of these personas are even deliberately created

44:15.700 --> 44:20.020
 to elicit a response inauthentically.

44:20.020 --> 44:22.220
 Are you referring to bots or?

44:22.220 --> 44:24.220
 Could be bots or actual people.

44:24.220 --> 44:25.540
 Bots are one thing, but I mean,

44:25.540 --> 44:27.140
 there are literal people out there

44:27.140 --> 44:30.380
 that will create something, create GoFundMes

44:30.380 --> 44:32.420
 for tragedies that never didn't really,

44:32.420 --> 44:36.500
 or events that didn't happen or any number of things.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.540
 Okay, I mean, burn their own house down

44:38.540 --> 44:40.540
 and then say, you know, we were attacked.

44:40.540 --> 44:42.780
 And then it comes down, oh, you did it to yourself

44:42.780 --> 44:45.380
 because you wanted money and empathy and this, that.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.420
 And you wanted all this emotional wealth,

44:48.420 --> 44:51.340
 let's say this emotional coin,

44:51.340 --> 44:52.820
 as well as actual if possible.

44:52.820 --> 44:55.180
 You wanted to leverage it in some way.

44:55.180 --> 44:57.060
 That's not the majority of people,

44:57.060 --> 45:01.020
 but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking,

45:01.020 --> 45:03.900
 well, if I post this photo

45:05.180 --> 45:07.060
 and I put this little blurb in there,

45:07.060 --> 45:10.460
 I bet I can get this much cache out of it in this sense.

45:10.460 --> 45:12.420
 And I'm not even, and this isn't just a reference

45:12.420 --> 45:14.620
 to like butt pics and stuff like that.

45:14.620 --> 45:17.380
 Because clearly, obviously people understand

45:17.380 --> 45:22.380
 that our inborn sexual nature is easy to manipulate.

45:23.340 --> 45:25.660
 I mean, that's pretty obvious.

45:25.660 --> 45:27.740
 But you're saying this kind of new medium

45:27.740 --> 45:32.140
 of communication on social media is unnatural.

45:32.140 --> 45:33.260
 And it preys on us.

45:33.260 --> 45:36.100
 And so as you want this, you know,

45:36.100 --> 45:41.100
 you look at an anarchist kind of mindset, right?

45:41.580 --> 45:44.500
 And so you're just like, there's no,

45:44.500 --> 45:48.820
 there is no overarching state to create

45:48.820 --> 45:51.940
 any kind of a structure, right?

45:51.940 --> 45:55.460
 And so if you have that unfettered capitalism aspect

45:55.460 --> 46:00.060
 with it, and before I say anything particularly damning

46:00.060 --> 46:03.940
 about unfettered capitalism, I'm a massive capitalist

46:03.940 --> 46:06.540
 because I view capitalism essentially as,

46:06.540 --> 46:09.500
 what it boils down to is I get these arguments to people too.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.900
 They start giving me all these extra definitions

46:11.900 --> 46:13.380
 about capitalism like, no, no,

46:13.380 --> 46:15.180
 this is obviously some sort of theory

46:15.180 --> 46:16.220
 you're taking from other shit.

46:16.220 --> 46:17.540
 But that doesn't describe capitalism.

46:17.540 --> 46:22.540
 Capitalism is the ability for us to create whatever we want

46:23.260 --> 46:27.220
 or, you know, create our thoughts, ideas, physical things

46:27.220 --> 46:29.660
 and trade them freely amongst each other

46:29.660 --> 46:34.220
 in ways that we find acceptable, right?

46:34.220 --> 46:36.380
 You know, I'm not even using the word fair

46:36.380 --> 46:39.020
 because I might think it's fair to me.

46:39.020 --> 46:41.300
 You might think, huh, well, I mean, that was actually,

46:41.300 --> 46:43.500
 I think what he thought was unfair to him

46:43.500 --> 46:44.620
 and it's more fair to me.

46:44.620 --> 46:46.580
 And then someone, a third observer goes,

46:46.580 --> 46:49.220
 oh man, you should not have paid that for that.

46:49.220 --> 46:50.060
 You should have paid this.

46:50.060 --> 46:50.900
 And it's like, well, you know what?

46:50.900 --> 46:52.540
 It works for me without...

46:52.540 --> 46:55.340
 Sufficiently acceptable that you both agree

46:55.340 --> 46:56.180
 to the transaction.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.020
 Correct.

46:58.700 --> 47:01.980
 But also at the root of that is freedom, right?

47:01.980 --> 47:03.700
 And as far as I can tell,

47:03.700 --> 47:06.220
 I've been banging this around in my head,

47:06.220 --> 47:09.020
 it's like for every one unit of freedom,

47:09.020 --> 47:11.300
 you need two units of accountability.

47:12.180 --> 47:14.340
 And if you don't have that,

47:14.340 --> 47:19.340
 what you end up with is human self interest.

47:19.980 --> 47:21.420
 We're not even gonna get into evil.

47:21.420 --> 47:24.780
 Human self interest, sabotaging other things,

47:24.780 --> 47:27.020
 even not in a sense to be malicious.

47:27.020 --> 47:28.820
 Okay, so in terms of,

47:28.820 --> 47:31.300
 let's put this as mathematically speaking,

47:31.300 --> 47:32.180
 I love this.

47:32.180 --> 47:35.380
 So anarchism is more like two units of freedom

47:35.380 --> 47:37.340
 and one unit of accountability

47:37.340 --> 47:38.940
 or maybe zero units of accountability.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.940
 Possibly, I mean, the anarchists tend to think like,

47:40.940 --> 47:42.180
 no, everyone will be accountable.

47:42.180 --> 47:44.100
 It's like, fuck they will.

47:44.100 --> 47:46.700
 When have you seen this happen in real life?

47:46.700 --> 47:47.740
 People aren't even accountable

47:47.740 --> 47:49.580
 in their revolutions at the time.

47:49.580 --> 47:54.580
 So you aren't looking at the way people really are.

47:56.060 --> 47:58.700
 Marx is like, yeah, the people are like this,

47:58.700 --> 47:59.540
 they're like that.

47:59.540 --> 48:00.700
 Look at how capitalism does it.

48:00.700 --> 48:03.780
 I mean, he of course assigns a lot of really

48:03.780 --> 48:06.740
 ridiculous economic principles and practice,

48:06.740 --> 48:09.420
 but and also assumes that everybody

48:09.420 --> 48:13.060
 who makes any profit from anything is somehow stealing it

48:13.060 --> 48:15.940
 and really assigns a negative moral aspect to them.

48:15.940 --> 48:16.940
 And then it's like, oh yeah,

48:16.940 --> 48:19.340
 but then eventually communism will happen.

48:19.340 --> 48:20.580
 No one will act that way anymore.

48:20.580 --> 48:21.740
 And you're like, whoa, hold on.

48:21.740 --> 48:23.460
 You just said that people are all,

48:23.460 --> 48:25.860
 are you saying it's all due to capitalism

48:25.860 --> 48:27.860
 or is it innate?

48:27.860 --> 48:31.620
 It's just, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of,

48:31.620 --> 48:35.100
 and it's like, hey, look at you.

48:35.100 --> 48:39.420
 You're like a notorious, like antisemitic, angry,

48:39.420 --> 48:43.860
 like just absolute curmudgeon of a human being

48:43.860 --> 48:46.740
 who seems to be really not all that fun to be around.

48:46.740 --> 48:47.580
 Marx?

48:47.580 --> 48:48.580
 Yeah, and then it's just like.

48:48.580 --> 48:49.540
 So you have to think like,

48:49.540 --> 48:52.740
 if there was 1 billion Marx's in the world,

48:52.740 --> 48:53.700
 how would they behave?

48:53.700 --> 48:54.700
 It would be absolute.

48:56.020 --> 48:58.260
 They would hate each other so bad.

48:58.260 --> 49:01.980
 And this isn't, for me to even poison them well on Marx

49:01.980 --> 49:03.700
 is like, oh, his personality sucks.

49:03.700 --> 49:05.700
 Like there's lots of people whose personality sucks.

49:05.700 --> 49:07.300
 That doesn't mean they can't make,

49:07.300 --> 49:09.780
 I don't know that it's never, what?

49:09.780 --> 49:10.900
 You know what, somebody argues.

49:10.900 --> 49:12.340
 He's just a loner.

49:12.340 --> 49:14.940
 I mean, I don't know that his personality sucked at all.

49:14.940 --> 49:17.580
 Let me walk that back and that he was human.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.380
 Say his personality sucked.

49:19.380 --> 49:23.140
 He was sometimes contradictory, irrational.

49:23.140 --> 49:27.500
 Sometimes he was quite sexist

49:27.500 --> 49:29.820
 despite the emails I've gotten.

49:29.820 --> 49:34.820
 That told me that there's people who has written to me

49:37.100 --> 49:40.660
 that Nietzsche has been unfairly labeled as sexist

49:40.660 --> 49:43.340
 in his discussion about women.

49:43.340 --> 49:45.780
 I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of documents

49:45.780 --> 49:50.780
 where he's just like, he's just a bitter guy.

49:51.300 --> 49:52.700
 I will agree with you.

49:52.700 --> 49:54.620
 And Marx is as bitter as they come to,

49:54.620 --> 49:58.780
 but bitterness in and of itself

49:58.780 --> 50:03.020
 doesn't make, like why I hate Marxism

50:03.020 --> 50:08.020
 comes from the entirety of the thing.

50:08.140 --> 50:13.140
 But I'm not going to say that Marxism or practic...

50:15.420 --> 50:18.740
 Man, you can find any forbidden book

50:18.740 --> 50:20.660
 and it could have something good in it.

50:20.660 --> 50:21.700
 As colonel is a good idea.

50:21.700 --> 50:23.900
 Yeah, and like at the end of the day,

50:23.900 --> 50:25.820
 Marx is a human being.

50:25.820 --> 50:26.820
 He's got a nice beard.

50:26.820 --> 50:28.500
 He does, he had a hell of a beard.

50:28.500 --> 50:29.740
 Yeah, a decent portrait.

50:29.740 --> 50:31.860
 I mean, he looks like the kind of guy like,

50:31.860 --> 50:33.500
 I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley,

50:33.500 --> 50:35.820
 but thankfully I don't think he was much of a fighter.

50:35.820 --> 50:39.940
 But in any case, I mean, not the anarchists

50:39.940 --> 50:44.860
 or they're more hot for like Max Stirner.

50:44.860 --> 50:48.140
 People like to think that Nietzsche borrowed a lot

50:48.140 --> 50:50.660
 from Stirner and my argument is one,

50:50.660 --> 50:52.540
 you don't have any real evidence for that

50:52.540 --> 50:54.740
 and two, bullshit, you know?

50:54.740 --> 50:59.580
 I mean, anybody could, the fact that they have

50:59.580 --> 51:03.980
 some overlapping thoughts doesn't make it lifted.

51:03.980 --> 51:06.740
 Not to mention, go read a lot more philosophy

51:06.740 --> 51:08.660
 and see how there's so many different things.

51:08.660 --> 51:12.220
 Oh, this guy said it in 1722.

51:12.220 --> 51:15.100
 Well, and then this guy says it again in 1922.

51:15.100 --> 51:16.620
 Does that mean he read the other guy's stuff?

51:16.620 --> 51:17.500
 Not necessarily.

51:17.500 --> 51:19.260
 I mean, he's working from the same type

51:19.260 --> 51:23.620
 of human physiological construct as anybody else.

51:23.620 --> 51:25.260
 Like, of course it's possible

51:25.260 --> 51:26.500
 that this guy could think the same thing.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.380
 We think a lot of the same things, to be perfectly honest.

51:29.380 --> 51:31.540
 I mean, reading the Hagakure,

51:31.540 --> 51:33.380
 going back to philosophy books,

51:33.380 --> 51:36.380
 this was really impactful on me as a younger adult

51:36.380 --> 51:39.020
 because here's a book written in the 19th century

51:39.020 --> 51:41.820
 about someone who lived through the 19th

51:41.820 --> 51:45.460
 and 18th century at times as a samurai, now a monk,

51:45.460 --> 51:48.980
 and his objections to society at the time,

51:48.980 --> 51:51.980
 the same objections one was having to society

51:51.980 --> 51:53.180
 as I was reading it.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.500
 Like, the same human behaviors,

51:55.500 --> 52:00.500
 the same impetus for action that he found a problem,

52:03.620 --> 52:07.300
 like, well, that's the same shit now.

52:07.300 --> 52:09.460
 Like, we're not, and this was the thing,

52:09.460 --> 52:11.140
 and then I'm reading more religion,

52:11.140 --> 52:13.140
 and I go, oh, we're no different

52:13.140 --> 52:16.140
 than anyone who wrote the Torah or older.

52:16.140 --> 52:18.740
 We are the same thing with the same problems,

52:18.740 --> 52:21.420
 with the same psychological issues,

52:21.420 --> 52:22.660
 the same human behaviors.

52:22.660 --> 52:24.940
 Like, these things are not different,

52:24.940 --> 52:26.020
 and we haven't changed.

52:26.020 --> 52:29.140
 Growing set of tools, though, to kill each other with

52:29.140 --> 52:31.220
 or to communicate together and all that kind of stuff,

52:31.220 --> 52:33.700
 but underlying it, there's a human nature.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.580
 Well, we're also trying to understand that human nature.

52:35.580 --> 52:37.420
 I think we've, just like you said,

52:37.420 --> 52:38.420
 learning how to fish,

52:38.420 --> 52:41.940
 acquired more and more knowledge about that human nature,

52:41.940 --> 52:44.300
 but it's been a very slow journey,

52:44.300 --> 52:46.740
 slower than people realize

52:46.740 --> 52:49.020
 in terms of understanding human nature.

52:49.020 --> 52:51.100
 Let me ask, in terms of egoism,

52:51.100 --> 52:56.100
 to be curious, to get your sense about Ayn Rand

52:56.700 --> 53:01.700
 and her whole idea of virtue of selfishness and her,

53:01.820 --> 53:06.500
 because you mentioned that everybody has a kernel of truth.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.860
 There's potential for a kernel of truth

53:08.860 --> 53:10.620
 to be discovered in anything.

53:10.620 --> 53:14.420
 For example, I've been recently reading Mein Kampf.

53:16.180 --> 53:18.220
 You know what, that's the thing.

53:18.220 --> 53:22.020
 Even, there's something in, there's probably things

53:22.020 --> 53:25.820
 in Mein Kampf that are not the surface level read.

53:25.820 --> 53:27.980
 If you get all hung up on all,

53:27.980 --> 53:32.860
 probably all his crap about his anger at Jews

53:32.860 --> 53:34.220
 and this and that, all this crap,

53:34.220 --> 53:36.860
 it's like, okay, yeah, that's right on the surface.

53:37.780 --> 53:38.820
 Try to get below that.

53:38.820 --> 53:43.820
 Try to see, how is he creating the Jews as a cope somehow?

53:43.820 --> 53:46.820
 Like, how is he using, why are they his scapegoat,

53:46.820 --> 53:49.180
 and I mean scapegoat in the,

53:49.180 --> 53:51.980
 so René Girard's concept of the scapegoat,

53:51.980 --> 53:55.580
 I mean it in that sense, whereas Hitler uses,

53:55.580 --> 54:00.300
 he wants to make the Jews the scapegoat for World War I.

54:00.300 --> 54:01.140
 You know what I mean?

54:01.140 --> 54:03.980
 For me, the starting point, similar with Ayn Rand,

54:03.980 --> 54:08.180
 is that Mein Kampf is not a good place to search,

54:08.180 --> 54:09.780
 not just because Hitler is evil,

54:09.780 --> 54:11.820
 but it's just not full of ideas.

54:11.820 --> 54:13.460
 No, it is not.

54:13.460 --> 54:16.220
 It has its significance due to a lot of things.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.820
 Historically speaking.

54:17.820 --> 54:19.820
 The starting point for me with Hitler

54:19.820 --> 54:23.180
 is to acknowledge that he is human

54:23.180 --> 54:26.060
 and to at least consider the possibility

54:26.060 --> 54:28.340
 that any one of us could have been Hitler.

54:28.340 --> 54:29.180
 So like, not to make it.

54:29.180 --> 54:31.540
 Well, that's a Peterson kind of concept.

54:31.540 --> 54:33.700
 Also, Jonathan Haidt has a thing

54:33.700 --> 54:38.500
 about the difference between hate and disgust mechanisms

54:38.500 --> 54:41.900
 and things like that, and so he goes into the,

54:41.900 --> 54:45.580
 looking at Hitler through his diary entries

54:45.580 --> 54:46.620
 and journals and stuff like that

54:46.620 --> 54:50.180
 to look and see it more as the disgust mechanism

54:50.180 --> 54:52.540
 than also trying to see if there's any

54:52.540 --> 54:56.740
 evolutionary biological attachment to this, whatever.

54:56.740 --> 54:59.380
 I mean, you're right, he is a human being.

54:59.380 --> 55:02.180
 Any of us, we're all human beings.

55:02.180 --> 55:07.180
 It's not that, it's probably jarring for people to think,

55:07.820 --> 55:12.820
 but we're all, I guess, supposedly potentially capable

55:12.820 --> 55:17.140
 of just being in, and all these evil people in the world

55:17.140 --> 55:20.620
 think they're doing it for the sake of good,

55:20.620 --> 55:22.820
 which makes them the most dangerous.

55:22.820 --> 55:26.580
 And there's some, there's differences in levels of insane.

55:26.580 --> 55:29.340
 I think Hitler was way more insane than Stalin.

55:29.340 --> 55:33.780
 I think Stalin legitimately thought he was doing good.

55:33.780 --> 55:36.100
 I would say that's probably true.

55:36.100 --> 55:40.420
 Stalin was just outright brutal.

55:40.420 --> 55:44.020
 Like he had his five year plan, he had all those other things.

55:44.020 --> 55:47.180
 He just had a much lower value for human life,

55:47.180 --> 55:49.820
 and so he was willing to take, make decisions

55:49.820 --> 55:53.900
 about what he actually, as a good executive,

55:54.780 --> 55:59.420
 which he was, of managing different bureaucracies and so on,

55:59.420 --> 56:01.100
 he was willing to make decisions

56:01.100 --> 56:04.620
 that resulted in mass human suffering,

56:04.620 --> 56:09.620
 where Hitler was, it seems like to me, much moodier.

56:09.620 --> 56:12.620
 So allowed emotions and moods to make decisions.

56:12.620 --> 56:16.660
 I think we also have to consider the different trajectories

56:16.660 --> 56:19.340
 and how, where, and when they were making their decisions.

56:19.340 --> 56:21.300
 And I mean, not by time specifically,

56:21.300 --> 56:24.260
 but Hitler engaged into this conflict

56:24.260 --> 56:27.140
 across multiple continents.

56:27.140 --> 56:29.980
 And then that, everything that comes

56:29.980 --> 56:32.460
 with basically fighting the whole world,

56:33.740 --> 56:36.380
 Stalin had his conflict,

56:36.380 --> 56:41.380
 and then he really mostly compartmentalized the rest of it.

56:41.460 --> 56:43.500
 So he was dealing with his own internal

56:43.500 --> 56:46.220
 instead of dealing with the internal and the external.

56:46.220 --> 56:48.780
 So if Stalin was put under a World War scenario,

56:48.780 --> 56:49.980
 I don't know, maybe he would have

56:49.980 --> 56:51.940
 eventually lost his marbles too.

56:51.940 --> 56:54.820
 Yeah, I'm not sure that that's, you're right.

56:54.820 --> 56:58.460
 The hunger for power was more internalized for Stalin.

56:58.460 --> 57:00.940
 He wanted to control the land that already existed

57:00.940 --> 57:02.940
 as opposed to wanting to colonize other land.

57:02.940 --> 57:05.580
 He was as nationalistic as Hitler,

57:05.580 --> 57:10.380
 but, and was as capable and willing

57:10.380 --> 57:13.260
 for violent conflict as Hitler,

57:13.260 --> 57:15.900
 for the aims of the state.

57:17.540 --> 57:22.540
 But he centered and internalized

57:22.740 --> 57:26.700
 prior to then externalizing and moving outwards.

57:26.700 --> 57:28.700
 Whereas even maybe prior to him,

57:28.700 --> 57:31.700
 there was an interest to continually push communism

57:31.700 --> 57:34.180
 in an aggressive sense following on the momentum

57:34.180 --> 57:37.740
 from the 1918 revolution.

57:37.740 --> 57:42.740
 And that, the halting of that through various aspects,

57:43.860 --> 57:47.500
 I guess in Germany, part of that was the National Socialists.

57:47.500 --> 57:49.980
 Like they came up and then they were the other ones

57:49.980 --> 57:50.900
 to fight the communists,

57:50.900 --> 57:54.060
 and so you had the two totalitarians going after it.

57:54.060 --> 57:55.740
 But then in the rest of the world

57:55.740 --> 58:00.860
 that was not dealing with totalitarian aspects,

58:00.860 --> 58:02.740
 it was just, it wasn't gonna stick,

58:02.740 --> 58:04.660
 especially in the West and other places.

58:04.660 --> 58:09.020
 But Stalin, just casually thinking,

58:09.020 --> 58:11.300
 it seemed like Stalin decided to go,

58:11.300 --> 58:12.620
 all right, well, we're not gonna go

58:12.620 --> 58:14.940
 just start launching right into more conflicts here.

58:14.940 --> 58:17.180
 We're gonna, these dudes are going down,

58:17.180 --> 58:18.620
 so that's cool for us,

58:18.620 --> 58:20.580
 because they hate us and we hate them.

58:22.180 --> 58:24.780
 But now we're gonna focus internally,

58:24.780 --> 58:28.020
 and then we're gonna work on growing at a slower rate

58:28.020 --> 58:30.180
 and picking our battles a bit more specifically.

58:30.180 --> 58:32.860
 And of course there's, you can get to the,

58:32.860 --> 58:34.100
 even this is after Stalin,

58:34.100 --> 58:36.340
 but you got the Bezmenov type stuff

58:36.340 --> 58:40.620
 talking about subversion in cultural aspects.

58:40.620 --> 58:42.700
 Yeah, I mean, there's this fascinating dynamics

58:42.700 --> 58:45.100
 to propaganda throughout the whole period that's.

58:45.100 --> 58:47.020
 Yeah, it's a whole nother kernel, yeah.

58:47.020 --> 58:49.820
 Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?

58:49.820 --> 58:53.540
 One of the things that's kind of fascinating to look at

58:53.540 --> 58:57.860
 is how many nations, both journalists and nations,

58:57.860 --> 59:00.940
 wanted, almost craved to take Hitler at his word

59:00.940 --> 59:04.300
 that he wanted peace until it was too late.

59:04.300 --> 59:08.380
 They almost wanted to delude themselves.

59:08.380 --> 59:11.620
 I mean, the same is true with the Stalin,

59:11.620 --> 59:13.540
 people wanted to take Stalin at his word for.

59:13.540 --> 59:14.860
 Oh, they still delude themselves.

59:14.860 --> 59:15.700
 Yeah.

59:15.700 --> 59:19.740
 We will delude ourselves over any number of things

59:19.740 --> 59:22.540
 until even after the fact where the history just says,

59:22.540 --> 59:24.940
 hey, fuck face, you know?

59:24.940 --> 59:27.420
 You cannot supplement your pseudo reality

59:27.420 --> 59:30.220
 onto actual reality here.

59:30.220 --> 59:34.460
 But yet, we deal with people in pseudo realities constantly.

59:34.460 --> 59:36.700
 I mean, we will always find a way

59:36.700 --> 59:39.980
 to change reality to suit our needs.

59:39.980 --> 59:41.180
 Well, the nature of truth now,

59:41.180 --> 59:42.860
 there's now multiple actual truths.

59:42.860 --> 59:43.980
 It's kind of fascinating.

59:43.980 --> 59:46.580
 There's multiple versions of history

59:46.580 --> 59:47.980
 that people are telling.

59:47.980 --> 59:52.820
 You know, the version of the Great Patriotic War in Russia,

59:52.820 --> 59:55.740
 the World War II in Russia is very different today

59:55.740 --> 59:57.540
 under Putin than the version

59:57.540 --> 1:00:00.820
 that we're learning in the United States

1:00:00.820 --> 1:00:02.540
 and then different than the version in Europe.

1:00:02.540 --> 1:00:06.220
 In the United States, the hero of the war

1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:07.500
 is the United States.

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:11.580
 In Europe, there's a much more sad and solemn story

1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:12.740
 of suffering and so on.

1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:13.580
 Sure.

1:00:13.580 --> 1:00:15.300
 In Russia, it's the Great.

1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:16.220
 Patriotic War.

1:00:16.220 --> 1:00:17.060
 Yes.

1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:19.100
 It was a unifier of a sense.

1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:23.900
 And it, I mean, yeah, I mean,

1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:28.020
 you can't argue that war and conflict that,

1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:32.020
 and or just even reducing that to stressors,

1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:36.260
 agitation, suffering doesn't create human motivation.

1:00:36.260 --> 1:00:37.220
 You know, we started this off.

1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:38.580
 You brought up a Frankel.

1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:40.340
 I'm like, yeah, Frankel's dope.

1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:41.860
 Man, it serves for meaning.

1:00:41.860 --> 1:00:43.220
 Maslow's great.

1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:46.940
 And I talked to you about how I started to think like,

1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:51.940
 man, do the ability for human beings to live

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:54.700
 and or potentially flourish

1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:57.620
 in the worst environments you can think of

1:00:57.620 --> 1:00:59.980
 is pretty incredible in and of itself.

1:00:59.980 --> 1:01:04.140
 And that it's a crazy thought to think that

1:01:04.140 --> 1:01:09.140
 without Frankel and Maslow ending up in concentration camps,

1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:13.900
 do they write some of the most important books

1:01:13.900 --> 1:01:16.260
 on philosophy in the 20th century?

1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:20.060
 And that's insane on a lot of different levels.

1:01:20.060 --> 1:01:22.500
 But, yeah, suffering is a creative force.

1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:25.220
 I mean, I don't, do you think we'll always have war?

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:28.900
 Yes, we will always have war in some form or another.

1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:32.700
 We need, quote unquote, air quotes,

1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:36.100
 for those just listening, war to survive.

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:37.380
 We need war to flourish.

1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:38.260
 We need at least.

1:01:38.260 --> 1:01:40.500
 Can you explain the quote, the air quotes around the war?

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:45.020
 Well, because take, take, take, take the.

1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:46.340
 You see wars as violence?

1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:47.660
 No, wars are not violence.

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:48.500
 So like, so when we're talking.

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:52.100
 No, air quotes because while us getting on the mat

1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:53.660
 or just getting on these hardwood floors

1:01:53.660 --> 1:01:57.020
 and wrestling around is not literal war,

1:01:57.020 --> 1:01:58.580
 it's war of a sorts.

1:01:59.740 --> 1:02:01.940
 It is a diluted form of war.

1:02:01.940 --> 1:02:03.900
 American football is a diluted form of war.

1:02:03.900 --> 1:02:05.860
 All this, these are diluted forms of war.

1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:07.840
 Tennis is a diluted form of war.

1:02:09.420 --> 1:02:12.980
 And I think one of the best explanations I ever got

1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:16.580
 from this, and another person very impactful

1:02:16.580 --> 1:02:19.660
 on my life and outlook and thinking about things,

1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:20.580
 Cormac McCarthy.

1:02:20.580 --> 1:02:24.460
 And so in Blood Meridian, there's this fantastic speech

1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:26.740
 about war given by the judge,

1:02:26.740 --> 1:02:28.860
 which there's a ton of fantastic speeches

1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:31.100
 on things given by the judge, yeah.

1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:33.060
 All that exists in creation without my knowledge

1:02:33.060 --> 1:02:34.700
 does so without my consent.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:36.780
 Okay, that's pretty heavy.

1:02:36.780 --> 1:02:38.140
 That's, that's hard.

1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:39.140
 Go ahead, can you break that up?

1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:40.260
 Can you say that again?

1:02:40.260 --> 1:02:43.540
 All things that exist in creation,

1:02:43.540 --> 1:02:45.280
 all things that exist without my knowledge

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:46.820
 do so without my consent.

1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:50.460
 What does that mean?

1:02:50.460 --> 1:02:53.600
 Well, I think from the judge's perspective,

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:56.460
 it's like, well, I didn't consent to that bird

1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:59.800
 or that dog or this building or all this,

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:02.140
 like all of this, you know, I didn't create it,

1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:03.860
 so it's done so without my consent.

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:05.740
 And if it's up to my consent,

1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:08.060
 well, I'll design it how I want to.

1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:11.020
 There's another similar look into how the judge is

1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:16.020
 in that book is he would study everything

1:03:16.060 --> 1:03:17.460
 everywhere he went.

1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:21.020
 And so he's collected this group of nary do wells

1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:24.140
 from all over to go on these hunts

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:28.820
 against certain tribes in the Southwest

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.300
 and getting paid by the US government,

1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:32.860
 the Mexican government.

1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:36.500
 So he's on these Indian hunts

1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:39.660
 and yet they're going to all these different places

1:03:39.660 --> 1:03:43.860
 and they would stay the night in a cave somewhere

1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:44.940
 and he would find cave paintings,

1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:46.200
 he would write them all down,

1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:47.820
 or he would find old pieces.

1:03:47.820 --> 1:03:50.980
 There's an example of him, the narrator,

1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:53.940
 explaining how watching the judge and how he drawing,

1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:56.660
 I mean, he's got this notebook just full of things,

1:03:56.660 --> 1:03:58.900
 drawings and writings,

1:03:58.900 --> 1:04:02.140
 and how he found like a piece of armor

1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:04.220
 from a conquistador or something way back in the day,

1:04:04.220 --> 1:04:06.500
 Spanish armor, and he draws it into his book

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:07.780
 and then crushes it.

1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:12.620
 And so the reason we'll always have war

1:04:12.620 --> 1:04:15.420
 in this society is because there's this struggle

1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:18.540
 amongst people that want to be the designers.

1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:21.300
 There's that, but I'm just saying

1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:23.700
 that he's got this whole quote on war,

1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:27.700
 like war is play, war is a game,

1:04:27.700 --> 1:04:30.620
 and the difference is is that what's at stake.

1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:33.900
 So all things are a game of some sort

1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:35.460
 and you're putting up for it

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:36.860
 or what you're willing to put up for it

1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:40.160
 determines whether or not you're going to participate or not.

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:45.160
 And all aspects of any game is war

1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:48.220
 and it's just, what is at stake?

1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:49.940
 If it's your life, it's a different story.

1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:52.340
 If it's just a coin, it's another thing.

1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:56.380
 A nice way to put it is if humans play a game

1:04:56.380 --> 1:05:00.500
 in this kind of pursuit of creating,

1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:02.860
 whatever the hell the reason is

1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:07.300
 that we keep creating cooler and cooler things,

1:05:07.300 --> 1:05:08.980
 it seems to be the result of a game

1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:11.460
 that we naturally play, we naturally crave.

1:05:11.460 --> 1:05:14.660
 I don't know, I mean, that's been the struggle of philosophy

1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:17.580
 is to understand what is the underlying force of all that.

1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:19.580
 Is it the will to power?

1:05:19.580 --> 1:05:21.500
 I think will to power is a really great way

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.500
 of describing it.

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.620
 Do you want to be the winner of the game?

1:05:25.620 --> 1:05:27.660
 No, not just, no, I don't look at will to power

1:05:27.660 --> 1:05:29.300
 as being the winner of the game.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:31.680
 Well, I mean, if we're going to get philosophical,

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:33.340
 yes, you want to be the winner of the game.

1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.260
 What does winning the game define how you win?

1:05:36.260 --> 1:05:38.540
 Everybody's going to define that win differently.

1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:40.740
 You could define the win in the most base level

1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:42.400
 like, oh, I got all the things.

1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:45.120
 Well, if you got all those things

1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:48.680
 without the needing component of fulfillment,

1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:50.460
 then you're going to be a very unhappy person

1:05:50.460 --> 1:05:51.300
 with a whole lot of things.

1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:54.860
 But there's a self referential aspect to where, to me,

1:05:54.860 --> 1:05:56.660
 the winner of the game is defined

1:05:56.660 --> 1:05:58.580
 by the people playing the game.

1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:03.580
 So if I'm playing a game, I want to win in the sense

1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:06.940
 that most of the other people who are playing the game

1:06:06.940 --> 1:06:08.860
 will say, yeah, that guy won.

1:06:08.860 --> 1:06:12.260
 By our collective definition, if I just come up,

1:06:12.260 --> 1:06:14.580
 listen, I'm sort of, if I come up with my own.

1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:17.540
 That's a lot of weight on the external on you.

1:06:17.540 --> 1:06:21.100
 Right, but that's how games seem to work.

1:06:21.100 --> 1:06:21.940
 Somewhat.

1:06:21.940 --> 1:06:24.260
 So I'm already a winner in my life

1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:26.300
 by defining my own definition of success.

1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:31.300
 I'm basically the best person in the world at doing me.

1:06:32.060 --> 1:06:32.900
 At being Lex.

1:06:32.900 --> 1:06:35.700
 Yeah, so like, and I'm really happy with that.

1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:37.140
 That's a source of happiness.

1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:38.380
 Well, I mean, think about it.

1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:40.440
 Games are also iterated, right?

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:42.820
 So you start off with your game

1:06:42.820 --> 1:06:45.460
 and then your game with your immediates

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:46.980
 and then the game further than that

1:06:46.980 --> 1:06:47.940
 and the game further than that

1:06:47.940 --> 1:06:49.940
 and then the game today and the game tomorrow

1:06:49.940 --> 1:06:50.900
 and the game next week.

1:06:50.900 --> 1:06:52.480
 And so it never ends.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:54.980
 And if you try to keep thinking about it that way,

1:06:54.980 --> 1:06:56.160
 no wonder people go crazy.

1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:59.060
 But we don't want to think about things that way.

1:06:59.060 --> 1:07:01.500
 We don't want to think about being towards death.

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:04.820
 We don't want to think about whether or not

1:07:04.820 --> 1:07:06.420
 I'm going anywhere after this

1:07:06.420 --> 1:07:08.100
 other than in the ground or what have you.

1:07:08.100 --> 1:07:09.940
 Like, you know.

1:07:09.940 --> 1:07:12.020
 All of these games are a sense of some distraction.

1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:12.860
 This is where we brought up.

1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:15.780
 Kind of, but I mean, it's violence is that

1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:18.580
 we need to let this out.

1:07:18.580 --> 1:07:23.160
 And so it is of our, kids need to wrestle and play

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:25.160
 just like animals need to wrestle and play.

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:27.460
 We need to have forms of competition.

1:07:27.460 --> 1:07:29.820
 We need to have ways to test ourselves,

1:07:29.820 --> 1:07:34.180
 to create when, what is it?

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:36.860
 When at peace a man of war makes war with himself.

1:07:36.860 --> 1:07:39.720
 And so we need to be able to competently

1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:42.380
 go at war with ourselves and go at war with our neighbor

1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:44.380
 and go at war with our neighbor's neighbor

1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:47.740
 in a way that is repeatable at the very least.

1:07:47.740 --> 1:07:50.620
 So one way of saying that there will always be war,

1:07:50.620 --> 1:07:54.060
 I mean, that's my hopeful view

1:07:54.060 --> 1:07:56.740
 is that most of the war conducted in the future

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:57.900
 will be, like you said,

1:07:57.900 --> 1:08:00.460
 the man must go to war with himself.

1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:01.820
 That would be great.

1:08:01.820 --> 1:08:04.620
 That's what to me love is,

1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:07.780
 is like focusing on yourself and your own improvement

1:08:07.780 --> 1:08:12.100
 and your own creativity and towards others feeling,

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:15.820
 sort of emphasizing cooperative behavior

1:08:15.820 --> 1:08:19.420
 and compassion and empathy.

1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:20.240
 It would be great.

1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.820
 But I mean, you can have, well, I'll put it to you this way.

1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:28.820
 If you have a whole community of Randians

1:08:29.660 --> 1:08:32.660
 and a whole community of Ancoms,

1:08:32.660 --> 1:08:37.540
 and they could all like, I don't know,

1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:39.620
 toast of London on Netflix,

1:08:39.620 --> 1:08:41.900
 and they love Netflix and they love the internet

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:46.860
 and they love picking apart Mon Comp with you.

1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:49.020
 They love like, they like all these things,

1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:52.420
 even the esoteric that they can get on with.

1:08:52.420 --> 1:08:55.660
 But at the fundamental root,

1:08:55.660 --> 1:08:57.700
 they cannot help but go to war

1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:59.940
 because they are literally oil and water.

1:08:59.940 --> 1:09:01.540
 No, but see, but they would,

1:09:01.540 --> 1:09:05.740
 the very labels they assign to themselves

1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:07.500
 would need to dissipate.

1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:08.340
 Well, this is true.

1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:09.740
 Well, then you would have to stop being

1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:11.100
 whatever it is that you took on

1:09:11.100 --> 1:09:14.740
 as your ideological or religious point, right?

1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:18.260
 Yeah, I mean, there's some days I'm Ancom,

1:09:18.260 --> 1:09:23.260
 some days I'm Ancaps and whatever the anarchic capital.

1:09:24.980 --> 1:09:28.260
 I mean, it depends on the hour, the minute of the day,

1:09:28.260 --> 1:09:31.220
 you constantly changing moods and embracing that flow,

1:09:31.220 --> 1:09:34.380
 the change of opinions, of ideas.

1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:35.580
 As there's some days like,

1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:37.300
 I'm actually cognizant of the fact

1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:39.180
 because I've been not getting my sleep.

1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:41.460
 And after I get some sleep,

1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:44.260
 I see I'm so much more optimistic about the world.

1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:46.220
 The less and less sleep I get,

1:09:46.220 --> 1:09:48.020
 the more sad and cynical I get.

1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:48.860
 I can see that.

1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:50.340
 There's an up and down constantly.

1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:52.820
 I don't even let my, well, okay.

1:09:52.820 --> 1:09:54.180
 I try not to let.

1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:56.340
 And most days it's never a problem.

1:09:56.340 --> 1:10:00.340
 Any sort of like, what the kids call it now,

1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:02.140
 blackpilled way of thinking,

1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:07.140
 be my over, the umbrella which I hang under.

1:10:07.380 --> 1:10:10.900
 So we actually, to drag us back,

1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:14.580
 can we talk about Carl Gotch and Cat Tressley?

1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:18.460
 Because I do want to make sure I touch it.

1:10:18.460 --> 1:10:20.380
 I mean, what, who were?

1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:22.100
 Carl Gotch is.

1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:23.620
 Is he the greatest catch wrestler?

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:26.820
 I don't know if he was the greatest catch wrestler ever.

1:10:26.820 --> 1:10:30.860
 I don't, I mean, he's one of them for a myriad of,

1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:34.100
 Carl Gotch, Billy Robinson.

1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:38.060
 Gotch and Robinson's trainer, Billy Riley.

1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:41.860
 So who are these figures and what did they bring to you?

1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:44.620
 Joe Maeda, he's one of the greatest catch wrestlers ever

1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:47.020
 because he's responsible for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:48.620
 Along with Cristal Gracie.

1:10:48.620 --> 1:10:51.900
 Okay, there's so much of things I'd like to say here,

1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:54.140
 but one of the things that catch wrestling

1:10:54.140 --> 1:10:57.900
 seemed to espouse as a principle is that of violence.

1:10:57.900 --> 1:11:01.940
 I just, the tournaments I competed at,

1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:03.260
 the unfortunate thing,

1:11:03.260 --> 1:11:06.260
 and we'll probably hopefully talk about it a little bit.

1:11:06.260 --> 1:11:09.260
 They were disorganized and the level of competition

1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:11.140
 was pretty low where people really sucked.

1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:12.740
 Pretty typical.

1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:13.740
 Is that typical, okay.

1:11:13.740 --> 1:11:18.740
 Well, it's, I mean, think about local run of the mill

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:22.660
 Jiu Jitsu tournament versus IBJJF created,

1:11:22.660 --> 1:11:24.660
 you know, a vast difference, so.

1:11:24.660 --> 1:11:28.780
 So I, you know, but there is, to me as a human being,

1:11:30.140 --> 1:11:31.860
 like intellectually, philosophically,

1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:34.300
 it was more interesting to go to catch wrestling tournament.

1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:36.940
 It seemed more real and honest

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:39.900
 because of the way they communicate about violence

1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:40.740
 and aggression. I love that.

1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:44.140
 So it is often more honest.

1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:44.980
 I think that as.

1:11:44.980 --> 1:11:45.820
 Who is that from?

1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:48.060
 Does that originate from, gosh, is that really Rob said?

1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:50.140
 Well, I mean, it originates from all wrestling

1:11:50.140 --> 1:11:52.620
 in that even Wade Chalice,

1:11:52.620 --> 1:11:57.620
 not a classically considered catch wrestler,

1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:02.620
 yet the reason why he has the world record

1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:05.260
 for most amount of world champions pinned

1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:09.420
 or the record for pins in the NCAA is because,

1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:11.700
 well, of course the idea is to put you on your back

1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:15.340
 and pin you, but there's no way you're gonna let me do that.

1:12:15.340 --> 1:12:20.060
 So how do I make it so that you want me to pin you?

1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:22.980
 Well, it's by you put them in excruciating pain.

1:12:22.980 --> 1:12:27.340
 So at the end of the day, you're both there.

1:12:27.340 --> 1:12:28.780
 You both wanna win.

1:12:28.780 --> 1:12:31.860
 Neither one wants to allow anything to the other.

1:12:31.860 --> 1:12:36.500
 So how do I get you to lose to me?

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.220
 Well, I make it so unbearable for you

1:12:38.220 --> 1:12:40.220
 that you decide losing is better than staying.

1:12:40.220 --> 1:12:42.460
 So those two are so fascinating

1:12:42.460 --> 1:12:44.660
 because so coming from Russia,

1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.540
 I don't know if that's where I got it

1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:49.580
 or if it's just my own predisposition

1:12:49.580 --> 1:12:51.060
 is I always loved the,

1:12:52.260 --> 1:12:55.660
 there's two ways to get you to want to pin yourself.

1:12:55.660 --> 1:12:59.140
 One is to making it so painful not to pin yourself

1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:00.980
 that you pin yourself or whatever.

1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:03.940
 And the other is, it's sort of like a Bruce Lee,

1:13:03.940 --> 1:13:07.500
 water flows, make it so easy to pin yourself.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:09.980
 So it's technique, it's like the elegance,

1:13:09.980 --> 1:13:11.060
 the ease of movement.

1:13:11.060 --> 1:13:14.700
 This is the Satya brothers, Vasya, Satya,

1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:19.100
 like the, just the elegance, the efficiency.

1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:20.940
 Yeah, they're practically like ballet watching those guys.

1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:21.780
 You know, it's incredible.

1:13:21.780 --> 1:13:23.300
 Satya brothers are massive.

1:13:23.300 --> 1:13:27.980
 And I'll also caveat a little bit that like,

1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:31.900
 if you're approaching this from a Russian perspective,

1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:36.580
 Russians are quite truthful about things,

1:13:36.580 --> 1:13:38.420
 especially when it comes to something like combat.

1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:40.780
 They just, this is how it is.

1:13:40.780 --> 1:13:42.220
 And this is how it's going to be.

1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:43.420
 It's honest. Yes.

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:46.620
 And honesty is what I really like about catch wrestling

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.820
 because I find that we, given any opportunity

1:13:49.820 --> 1:13:52.500
 for us to be dishonest for any number of reasons,

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:56.020
 we're gonna, especially if it's a dishonesty

1:13:56.020 --> 1:13:57.500
 towards a positive, right?

1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:59.340
 Like, oh, well, you know, it's all technique

1:13:59.340 --> 1:14:02.460
 and it's all this and it's the gentle art and blah.

1:14:02.460 --> 1:14:06.740
 Bro, I have rolled with ADCC world champions,

1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:09.100
 you know, some of the best you have ever heard of.

1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:12.100
 There ain't a lot of gentleness when it comes to like,

1:14:12.100 --> 1:14:15.220
 oh yeah, they wanted to sweep you and you said no.

1:14:15.220 --> 1:14:17.100
 And then you did, said no again.

1:14:17.100 --> 1:14:19.260
 And then you said no and attacked their leg.

1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:20.100
 Yeah.

1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:21.700
 It ceases to be all that gentle

1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:23.060
 because at the end of the day,

1:14:23.060 --> 1:14:25.100
 these dudes are strong as hell.

1:14:25.100 --> 1:14:25.940
 They're flexible.

1:14:25.940 --> 1:14:27.340
 They're all, I mean, they're,

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:29.420
 the difference between the athleticism

1:14:29.420 --> 1:14:34.420
 and the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap.

1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:37.220
 The athleticism shows up,

1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:39.460
 but then there's all that other extra

1:14:39.460 --> 1:14:42.460
 and part of that is meanness and pain

1:14:42.460 --> 1:14:45.460
 and getting what you need out of it.

1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:47.980
 But see, there is a philosophical difference

1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:49.540
 in the way it's thought because.

1:14:50.860 --> 1:14:53.300
 I think some of it is just, they just in denial.

1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:55.140
 Like, oh, people will, they like to,

1:14:55.140 --> 1:14:57.460
 people like to espouse a lot of things as theory

1:14:57.460 --> 1:14:59.020
 and then it's like, okay, let me watch.

1:14:59.020 --> 1:15:00.980
 When they're, oh, you're not doing anything

1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:02.060
 about what you said right now.

1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:03.580
 In fact, you're doing the opposite.

1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:05.660
 You're literally hurting that guy

1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:09.260
 because your shit ain't working

1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:10.660
 in the way that you'd like it to.

1:15:10.660 --> 1:15:12.020
 So you're having to use strength.

1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:13.260
 You're having to, it's one of my favorites,

1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:14.620
 like, oh, you're using too much strength.

1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:16.260
 And it's like, well, hold on.

1:15:16.260 --> 1:15:18.900
 Do we want people not to use strength at this point

1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:21.260
 to understand more of mechanics?

1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:22.500
 Or are you trying to tell people

1:15:22.500 --> 1:15:24.020
 if they use strength at all,

1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:26.700
 that they're somehow bad at what they do?

1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:28.300
 Cause you know, it's not my fault.

1:15:28.300 --> 1:15:29.140
 You're not stronger than me.

1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:32.660
 But see, I'm speaking to something else that's, that's.

1:15:32.660 --> 1:15:34.500
 Well, I tend to think what it comes down to is like,

1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:36.900
 strength is fine until you beat me with it.

1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:38.740
 Then it sucks.

1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:41.060
 Okay, so strength is another thing.

1:15:41.060 --> 1:15:44.580
 I'm speaking, I'm thinking about more like anger.

1:15:44.580 --> 1:15:45.580
 Oh, sure.

1:15:45.580 --> 1:15:46.420
 Okay, so like.

1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:48.820
 I've seen a lot of angry guys in jiu jitsu, I know that.

1:15:48.820 --> 1:15:49.660
 Really?

1:15:49.660 --> 1:15:50.500
 Mm hmm.

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:51.740
 Okay, okay, good, well, but let's talk about,

1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:55.300
 let's talk about the highest level of competitions.

1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:56.860
 There's a book called Wrestling Tough.

1:15:56.860 --> 1:15:57.700
 Yeah.

1:15:57.700 --> 1:15:58.540
 It's a really good book.

1:15:58.540 --> 1:16:01.860
 There's, I've encountered in my life a few,

1:16:01.860 --> 1:16:02.860
 especially in wrestling,

1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:07.860
 people who really try to find a way to use anger,

1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:10.260
 to get really angry at their opponent.

1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:12.660
 Not like stupid anger, but just like.

1:16:12.660 --> 1:16:17.660
 Intense, pointed anger distilled into something

1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.740
 that you can use as fuel.

1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:22.500
 And like, I remember this story.

1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:23.420
 I don't know where I read it.

1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:24.740
 Might be Wrestling Tough,

1:16:24.740 --> 1:16:28.180
 where a person was imagining that their opponent

1:16:28.180 --> 1:16:31.420
 just raped their mother, raped their girlfriend

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:32.260
 or something like that,

1:16:32.260 --> 1:16:35.020
 to create this like method acting thing in their head

1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:38.820
 to be like, to snap them out of this polite interaction

1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:43.060
 of usual like athletic convention and like.

1:16:43.060 --> 1:16:46.460
 You know, that's a design of necessity.

1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:50.540
 So my anecdote for this was,

1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:54.620
 I was sitting with backstage before a fight,

1:16:54.620 --> 1:16:55.860
 not my fight.

1:16:55.860 --> 1:16:58.940
 And I'm working with this guy and this dude is,

1:16:58.940 --> 1:17:00.980
 this is a world champion guy.

1:17:00.980 --> 1:17:03.740
 And he's competed at the highest levels.

1:17:03.740 --> 1:17:06.600
 And he looks at me and he goes,

1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:11.540
 you know, do you ever get nervous before fights?

1:17:11.540 --> 1:17:14.660
 And I looked at him and I went, no, I don't.

1:17:14.660 --> 1:17:15.780
 And he just looks at me and he's like,

1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.260
 fuck man, I'm so nervous.

1:17:17.260 --> 1:17:18.580
 You know, how do you do it, man?

1:17:18.580 --> 1:17:19.860
 Or, you know, I wish it could be like you.

1:17:19.860 --> 1:17:21.320
 And I said, you know what?

1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:24.100
 That doesn't mean that what I'm doing is better.

1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:26.060
 It's just what is necessary for me.

1:17:26.060 --> 1:17:27.420
 It's the way I am.

1:17:27.420 --> 1:17:31.500
 And I told him, so this anecdote goes into another anecdote.

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.260
 This is a Family Guy episode, I guess.

1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:38.260
 So, where some, another famous high level guy told me

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:44.560
 about this experience with a world champion boxer in Japan.

1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:49.580
 And this guy would get insanely nervous and worked up

1:17:49.580 --> 1:17:51.500
 and anxious before his matches.

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.560
 And he hated it and hated it and hated it.

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:56.100
 And so he wanted to get rid of that feeling.

1:17:56.100 --> 1:17:58.460
 So he went to a hypnotist for a bunch of sessions

1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:02.340
 and managed to, and he goes in and next fight,

1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:06.260
 he's cool as a cucumber and doesn't perform and loses.

1:18:06.260 --> 1:18:10.020
 And so what I said, going back to anecdote one,

1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:14.420
 was, you know, whatever is necessary for you

1:18:14.420 --> 1:18:18.180
 to get yourself in the best state of being right now

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:20.540
 to compete, whatever that may be,

1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:23.660
 it could be absolute stress and fear,

1:18:23.660 --> 1:18:25.820
 it could be anger, it could be calmness,

1:18:25.820 --> 1:18:26.780
 it could be whatever.

1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:31.660
 But there is a, but there is a state

1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:34.380
 at which you need to be in to do your best.

1:18:34.380 --> 1:18:36.700
 And you as the individual, you have to find that.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:40.940
 Can you comment on Tyson, Mike Tyson?

1:18:40.940 --> 1:18:42.780
 Oh, yeah, that thing.

1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:45.140
 So first, so he, there's two things I wanna,

1:18:45.140 --> 1:18:48.580
 so he's a, in terms of fear, there's a clip there,

1:18:48.580 --> 1:18:50.500
 I think from a documentary where he talks about

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:54.820
 he is like fully afraid as he walks up to the ring

1:18:54.820 --> 1:18:56.380
 and as he gets closer and closer and closer,

1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:58.620
 he gets more confident until he gets in

1:18:58.620 --> 1:19:00.960
 and then he's a god or something like that.

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:05.700
 That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan

1:19:05.700 --> 1:19:10.700
 that he gets aroused at the possibility of true,

1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.760
 like of hurting somebody in the ring.

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:15.120
 So like he gets aroused at the violence.

1:19:16.580 --> 1:19:20.420
 I like it because it's coupled to your basically statement

1:19:20.420 --> 1:19:23.860
 that we need to own, to find our own unique way

1:19:23.860 --> 1:19:28.860
 of existing at our top level of performance.

1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:30.300
 And that perhaps is Mike Tyson.

1:19:30.300 --> 1:19:33.100
 But do you think there's something more deeply universal

1:19:33.100 --> 1:19:35.900
 to the Mike Tyson speaking to the fact

1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:37.740
 that he's aroused at the possibility of violence?

1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:38.680
 Yeah, I do actually.

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.900
 Although I don't think that it always equates to arousal

1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:45.220
 for people, in fact, I would say in general, it doesn't.

1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.460
 I can say I've never had a boner in the ring.

1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:50.160
 In fact, if anything, old combat cock is like,

1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:52.780
 we're not hanging around, we're leaving, we're going up.

1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:55.080
 We're taking off, we don't want anything to do with this.

1:19:55.080 --> 1:19:57.860
 You have fun, come back to us when you have something

1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:00.200
 warmer, softer, smells better.

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:04.900
 But the power, the feeling of aliveness,

1:20:04.900 --> 1:20:06.060
 yeah, I could see it.

1:20:07.380 --> 1:20:09.360
 Back to even the concept of the Ubermensch,

1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:12.580
 I feel like the states, the highest states of being

1:20:12.580 --> 1:20:15.900
 I've ever been in were in the midst of conflict.

1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:17.520
 I felt like that was the times,

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:20.020
 those are the moments in my life where I felt like

1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:25.020
 I was at the highest level of being as a human in existence.

1:20:25.100 --> 1:20:28.860
 But yet, even being in that state was not,

1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:31.220
 it was not something that you could interact with

1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:33.180
 people that weren't in that state with you.

1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:34.700
 They wouldn't get it, you would almost seem,

1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:36.540
 and to be that way all the time,

1:20:36.540 --> 1:20:40.900
 either A, might drive you mad, or B, is you're not,

1:20:40.900 --> 1:20:43.300
 you're something that's untenable to the rest of society.

1:20:43.300 --> 1:20:45.420
 You can't function with everybody else.

1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:46.740
 It will not work.

1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:48.220
 It's just like you said with the Ubermensch,

1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:50.220
 it's like it's perhaps that ideal

1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:52.180
 is not something you can hold for long.

1:20:52.180 --> 1:20:53.620
 That's the very nature of it is.

1:20:53.620 --> 1:20:56.700
 Yeah, well, there was an example in The Spoke Zarathustra

1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:00.860
 about a snake being down the person's throat

1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:05.860
 and biting it, and then having this maniacal laughter

1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:10.880
 erupting, and to me it was, at least I read it as,

1:21:12.060 --> 1:21:16.780
 yeah, okay, there's this insane moment that isn't forever,

1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:21.500
 but that it is life and death, and the overcoming it

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.620
 is the thing that all of a sudden gives you

1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:27.540
 that tapping into your highest state, right?

1:21:27.540 --> 1:21:32.140
 This is, man is a chasm, a tightrope

1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:35.740
 between man and Ubermensch.

1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:38.420
 Well, I don't wanna leave your thought about,

1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:42.260
 we'll call those things flourishes

1:21:42.260 --> 1:21:47.180
 to the aspect of Tyson's interpretation

1:21:47.180 --> 1:21:51.040
 or his expression of his feelings in combat,

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.820
 and so I gave this anecdote to the guy,

1:21:53.820 --> 1:21:57.200
 and my first anecdote to that athlete I was working with,

1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:00.200
 and I said, you know, there isn't a superior way

1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:01.040
 in this sense.

1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:02.660
 There is the way that works for you.

1:22:02.660 --> 1:22:05.740
 That may be something you can implement to other people

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:06.960
 if you find that person,

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:08.580
 because we all have different personalities,

1:22:08.580 --> 1:22:11.240
 and to me that's an absolute.

1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:13.580
 I don't wanna, don't come at me

1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:16.580
 with all your other fucking social sciences crap.

1:22:16.580 --> 1:22:18.660
 No, we have distinct personalities.

1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:21.380
 That personality, who you really are,

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:25.260
 and this, again, Heidegger, Dasein, being authentic.

1:22:25.260 --> 1:22:28.060
 If you're authentic with who you are, goods and bads,

1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:30.100
 you will know how to create what that is,

1:22:30.100 --> 1:22:33.840
 and for me, violence and fighting and conflict

1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:36.980
 was something that always felt normal to me,

1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:40.220
 and I don't mean normal in, like I grew up in a war zone

1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:42.980
 or an abusive household or something like that.

1:22:42.980 --> 1:22:45.620
 I just meant that, and I was a kid who was very

1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:49.560
 joyful and inquisitive,

1:22:50.780 --> 1:22:54.740
 and spent a lot of time around older people, of all things,

1:22:54.740 --> 1:22:58.840
 and also, while I don't think I have much capability

1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:02.200
 toward engineering, my mom said that one of the first things

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:03.540
 as like a little baby,

1:23:03.540 --> 1:23:06.180
 when she put me in my sister's old crib,

1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:08.700
 instead of my sister who just milled about

1:23:08.700 --> 1:23:10.020
 and was fine with it all,

1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:12.060
 the first thing I did was I completely deconstructed it.

1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:12.900
 I didn't break it.

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:14.500
 I figured out how to pull it apart.

1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.040
 Curiosity about the world, and yet,

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.620
 that wasn't in conflict with the idea of violence?

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:23.180
 No, not at all, and so being a very joyful and nice kid,

1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:28.180
 but kids are kids, and if kids can find that you respond

1:23:29.300 --> 1:23:34.300
 maybe more easily to agitation, they will agitate you,

1:23:34.580 --> 1:23:36.340
 and if you should stand out in some way

1:23:36.340 --> 1:23:40.260
 by being taller or bigger or something, or caring,

1:23:40.260 --> 1:23:42.740
 especially, they will agitate you.

1:23:42.740 --> 1:23:44.660
 They don't really fully understand it either,

1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.300
 and so I don't hold anything against any of the kids

1:23:47.300 --> 1:23:48.800
 that used to pick on me or whatever,

1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:50.540
 especially at the youngest ages.

1:23:50.540 --> 1:23:52.700
 Man, they don't know shit either, so,

1:23:54.140 --> 1:23:57.940
 but once that line was pushed, for me it was,

1:23:57.940 --> 1:24:00.400
 oh, well, I was being cool.

1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:02.420
 Now you're being uncool.

1:24:02.420 --> 1:24:04.500
 Well, then that gives me license for everything,

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:06.300
 and so, boom, we would just go at it,

1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:07.940
 or kids that would try to initiate a fight,

1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:12.000
 and I was like, okay, and being in that moment

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.700
 of just going to town with someone else,

1:24:14.700 --> 1:24:18.860
 it just felt like this is, this is.

1:24:18.860 --> 1:24:19.780
 I belong here.

1:24:19.780 --> 1:24:23.180
 Yeah, it was never a problem for me.

1:24:23.180 --> 1:24:27.620
 In fact, if anything, what I had to understand was,

1:24:27.620 --> 1:24:29.780
 well, not only did I learn the hard way,

1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:32.940
 that it doesn't matter, at the end of the day,

1:24:32.940 --> 1:24:36.080
 it doesn't really matter what anybody else does

1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:41.080
 if your response in violence, even to their violence,

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:42.740
 if you're the winner,

1:24:42.740 --> 1:24:45.580
 is often going to be penalized severely.

1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:51.300
 Society, state apparatus, they don't want any of that.

1:24:51.300 --> 1:24:53.500
 They wanna be the only arbiter of violence

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.460
 in the world, always.

1:24:55.460 --> 1:24:58.200
 But I learned a very difficult lesson with that,

1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:01.140
 and it was really impactful in a negative way on me,

1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:05.300
 but also I had to learn, on an individual sense,

1:25:05.300 --> 1:25:08.120
 to, you need to manage violence, too,

1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.940
 because, hey, if someone attacks you

1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:15.180
 or starts a fight with you and you go at it,

1:25:15.180 --> 1:25:16.980
 okay, beating them up is one thing,

1:25:18.060 --> 1:25:21.260
 trying to grab a handful of broken glass from the street

1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:22.380
 and throw it in their face,

1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:25.520
 maybe that's a bit much at seven.

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:30.520
 So you need to learn what level is necessary,

1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:33.580
 and you need to learn what comes with all,

1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:35.420
 what's the responsibility of,

1:25:35.420 --> 1:25:38.140
 when you enact violence, I mean, you take on something

1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:40.660
 when you have a responsibility for that.

1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:42.840
 This is the extension of your actions.

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:48.460
 But as I got older, and especially as I found sports,

1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:51.100
 and then combat sports,

1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:54.900
 now this was a place for me to flourish,

1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:59.900
 and to the point where I was more myself in that space

1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:02.780
 than I was outside of it until time enough

1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:05.940
 where I could learn to get this back together again.

1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:09.660
 And I never say that I'll merge the two

1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:10.500
 or anything like that.

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:12.460
 No, all what happened,

1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:21.460
 my journey from adolescence on to manhood,

1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:24.220
 a huge portion of it,

1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:27.220
 besides the normal finding yourself, whatever, whatever,

1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:32.220
 actually what it was was getting back to who I always was.

1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:33.940
 Getting back to the kid.

1:26:33.940 --> 1:26:35.140
 The curious kid, the kind kid.

1:26:35.140 --> 1:26:36.500
 Getting back to the guy

1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:38.940
 that I should have been allowed to become

1:26:38.940 --> 1:26:43.940
 instead of what happened under the pressures of other things.

1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:49.460
 And the attempt for society and certain people

1:26:50.540 --> 1:26:55.540
 within managerial positions to compress what that was

1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:58.100
 into something that they found more suitable.

1:26:58.100 --> 1:26:59.260
 Yeah, but those pressures allow you

1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:02.300
 to discover this little world, forbidden world,

1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:05.620
 in many ways, of violence that you could explore.

1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:07.380
 Through sport, you can explore it,

1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:11.420
 and it's more socially acceptable to explore it through sport.

1:27:11.420 --> 1:27:12.420
 For sure.

1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:16.540
 But even then, at times, it's socially unacceptable.

1:27:16.540 --> 1:27:21.340
 So I beat Sem Schilt.

1:27:21.340 --> 1:27:24.020
 He cut my right eyebrow.

1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:25.700
 I cut him and busted his nose,

1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:28.780
 and he's bleeding all over me as I have an armbar on top.

1:27:28.780 --> 1:27:31.740
 I'm getting, you know, it's raining blood.

1:27:31.740 --> 1:27:35.860
 Quote some slayer from a lacerated Sem Schilt,

1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:38.540
 bleeding in his horror, creating my structures.

1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:39.580
 Now I shall rain him blood.

1:27:39.580 --> 1:27:44.580
 But I win the fight, armbar, nasty one.

1:27:46.660 --> 1:27:48.860
 I get on my feet, and the first thing I do

1:27:48.860 --> 1:27:52.180
 is I wipe all the blood off onto my hands,

1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:55.580
 and I lick it, and I do my thing.

1:27:55.580 --> 1:27:59.380
 And all the MMA journalists freaked out.

1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:01.100
 Dana Wise, like, man, I don't know about that.

1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:02.740
 You know, we don't want him doing,

1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:04.900
 everybody had this huge problem.

1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:07.700
 And then some folks would even contend,

1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:10.460
 oh, you know, you're trying to do,

1:28:10.460 --> 1:28:12.260
 like, no, no, no, this isn't planned.

1:28:12.260 --> 1:28:13.780
 I don't think of these things.

1:28:13.780 --> 1:28:14.980
 This is how I really feel.

1:28:14.980 --> 1:28:16.860
 This is who I really am.

1:28:16.860 --> 1:28:21.100
 And, you know, it was even kind of comical after the fact,

1:28:21.100 --> 1:28:24.180
 you know, and BJ Penn was on the very card with me,

1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:27.100
 watching him at some point in his career all of a sudden

1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:29.780
 win fights and then do this licking the glove thing,

1:28:29.780 --> 1:28:31.260
 and everyone thinks it's the coolest thing ever.

1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:33.500
 And I'm like, hey, fuck faces.

1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:38.500
 I did this in 2002 or one, 2001,

1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:40.420
 and BJ Penn actually back then was like,

1:28:40.420 --> 1:28:43.500
 dude, you're a badass, you're a killer, you know?

1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:45.100
 Where did that come from?

1:28:45.100 --> 1:28:46.980
 Because that seems like a deeply human moment.

1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:49.820
 I could say, I could just be, you know, goofy about it

1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:52.340
 and call it orgiastic to align with Titan.

1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:53.700
 Are we back to Mike Tyson?

1:28:53.700 --> 1:28:57.940
 Yeah, but Tyson, but no, no, it isn't, it's beyond that.

1:29:00.180 --> 1:29:01.020
 Is it a celebration of human nature?

1:29:01.020 --> 1:29:02.660
 I've had some pretty decent orgasms

1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:04.300
 in my life at this point, I'm 43.

1:29:04.300 --> 1:29:06.340
 So, but no, none have ever compared to that.

1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:09.620
 Like I said, it is a feeling of highest being to me.

1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:10.460
 And I...

1:29:10.460 --> 1:29:11.900
 It's your Ubermensch moment.

1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:15.620
 This is where I feel like the restrictions

1:29:15.620 --> 1:29:20.140
 of general existence in society are gone.

1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:23.740
 And I get to fully live in a state

1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:26.540
 that feels more meaningful, of the most meaning.

1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:28.060
 You know, I think of it as life and death.

1:29:28.060 --> 1:29:32.900
 And it's just, it is the way I'm built.

1:29:32.900 --> 1:29:36.020
 And I don't have, I've never had any problem

1:29:36.020 --> 1:29:36.940
 applying violence.

1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:39.700
 Like it doesn't, I don't know where it comes from

1:29:39.700 --> 1:29:41.180
 or how you would define it or whatever,

1:29:41.180 --> 1:29:44.580
 if you want to stick me under in a psychologist chair,

1:29:44.580 --> 1:29:47.420
 but like I don't, there's a part of me

1:29:47.420 --> 1:29:49.660
 that can just like, no, if I'm gonna apply,

1:29:49.660 --> 1:29:52.820
 I can apply violence to any level and be okay with it.

1:29:52.820 --> 1:29:54.900
 And it doesn't, I don't lose sleep.

1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.420
 It doesn't bother me.

1:29:56.420 --> 1:29:57.860
 It's not a problem.

1:29:57.860 --> 1:30:02.860
 It was me learning how to fully understand violence,

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:07.380
 humans, and the broader perspective

1:30:07.380 --> 1:30:08.980
 that allowed me to think about things

1:30:08.980 --> 1:30:12.780
 and like, well, what do I really want to accomplish

1:30:12.780 --> 1:30:15.180
 with my actions in the world just on a whole?

1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:18.860
 You know, not compartmentalizing my sporting career.

1:30:18.860 --> 1:30:21.260
 Even when I get in the ring,

1:30:21.260 --> 1:30:24.460
 I don't have any mercy generally.

1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:29.460
 And if I do, it's because I make a really deliberate attempt

1:30:30.260 --> 1:30:33.380
 to be in a state where I can have mercy.

1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:36.620
 If I just go in there to fight with everything I got,

1:30:36.620 --> 1:30:37.460
 there is zero mercy.

1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:38.300
 The natural state of violence.

1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:40.100
 There's nothing, there's nothing that will hold me back

1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:42.860
 other than the referee and that's that.

1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:45.980
 You know, I know I agreed to be allowed to do

1:30:45.980 --> 1:30:49.420
 and not to do, but within that, no.

1:30:49.420 --> 1:30:51.980
 And I expect it to be done to me.

1:30:51.980 --> 1:30:56.300
 But in terms of values, in terms of seeing what,

1:30:56.300 --> 1:31:01.300
 to me, violence is just yet another canvas

1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:04.860
 that humans can paint beautifully on.

1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:07.720
 Clearly, I mean, we have venerated the violent.

1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:11.840
 There are communists that venerate the violent

1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:12.920
 on their behalf.

1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:14.480
 There are national socialists

1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:16.240
 that venerate the violent there.

1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:19.240
 And then if you remove it from an ideological perspective,

1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:23.680
 we venerate the violent when they're a hero.

1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:26.980
 We venerate the violent in our religion.

1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:29.240
 Well, I mean, I guess some people venerate the violence

1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.360
 of Yahweh and Sodom and Gomorrah, right?

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:34.720
 So, or do we say Jehovah?

1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:35.560
 I don't know.

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:38.920
 Is there, you've already mentioned one,

1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:42.520
 but is there a fight where you've achieved

1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:46.180
 the highest of heights for your own personal being

1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:48.440
 just when you look within yourself

1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:49.860
 that you're the proudest of,

1:31:49.860 --> 1:31:51.900
 or maybe it was your most beautiful creation?

1:31:51.900 --> 1:31:52.740
 Is there something that stands out?

1:31:52.740 --> 1:31:54.880
 Yeah, there are a few, actually.

1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:57.040
 Fighting Semishield and a rematch.

1:31:57.040 --> 1:31:58.840
 Well, the first one was pretty good, too.

1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:01.640
 But the rematch was, I was suffering,

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:04.980
 I had suffered prior, the week prior,

1:32:04.980 --> 1:32:07.360
 to food poisoning.

1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:09.840
 And so while my abs are looking all right,

1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:16.080
 I, in the ring, didn't have the power that I expected to.

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:19.600
 And I was struggling in ways,

1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:22.740
 in some of the grappling with the submission stuff

1:32:22.740 --> 1:32:24.200
 that I hadn't accounted for.

1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:26.760
 Just exhaustion or mental exhaustion?

1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:28.680
 No, I mean, just physical,

1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:32.080
 I wasn't back up to 100% in terms of just power output.

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:36.760
 And Semi was, well, he's always seven foot tall.

1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.600
 But this time he was, the first time I fought him,

1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:43.600
 he was 260, or 257, or 260 something, something like that.

1:32:44.900 --> 1:32:46.760
 This time he was like 290.

1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:48.940
 And so he was a significantly bigger cat.

1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:51.160
 And he's a big dude.

1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:56.160
 And I just remember being up against the ropes with him,

1:32:57.940 --> 1:33:00.280
 changing levels, trying to take him down.

1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:01.760
 And he's fighting, and he's hippin'.

1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:03.560
 And I just thought in my head,

1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:05.320
 there's no fuckin way I'm gonna lose this fight.

1:33:05.320 --> 1:33:07.200
 There's no way, you are not going to beat me.

1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:08.560
 It's not gonna happen.

1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:11.120
 And I armbarred him, the other arm.

1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:12.520
 Even out of the fact he's like,

1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:13.840
 man, I really wanted to get you for that,

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:15.000
 I wanted to get that match back.

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:16.760
 And then you fuckin got my other arm, dick.

1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:19.280
 And I'm like, eh, dude, I still love you though.

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:20.180
 You know, and that.

1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:22.240
 But the whole time you're like,

1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:24.800
 so this has to do with the dichotomy

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.080
 of you're feeling your worst.

1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:28.280
 And having to overcome.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.300
 You're like literally mentally telling yourself

1:33:30.300 --> 1:33:31.140
 there's no way.

1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:32.760
 There's no fuckin way I'm gonna lose this fight.

1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:35.400
 And then there's even my last bare knuckle match.

1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:39.480
 And getting in the ring and fighting bare knuckle boxing

1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:40.480
 for the first time.

1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.480
 And just thinking, just being in a great state.

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:48.800
 And just looking so forward to seeing.

1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:51.520
 I mean, I called someone.

1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:52.720
 I was talking to them the night before.

1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:56.080
 And I said, yeah, well, I video called you

1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:58.820
 because this face might not look like this

1:33:58.820 --> 1:33:59.960
 when I see you next.

1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:03.200
 And they're just like, ooh, uh, okay.

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:05.040
 That's not just like empty trash talk.

1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:09.040
 That's like a clarity of mind and a seriousness about.

1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:11.000
 I go, I might die.

1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.760
 Most, pretty high chance of being deformed some way.

1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:16.040
 So, but fuck it.

1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:16.880
 I don't really care.

1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:17.860
 Are you, do you think about,

1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:19.560
 are you accepting your own death?

1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.280
 Yes, 100%.

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:24.120
 Yeah, I, in fact, and that's, in a strange way,

1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:26.360
 that's partially what makes it so elevated

1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:29.160
 in terms of my sense of feeling.

1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:34.160
 By being able to have death at my side, it feels good.

1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:41.960
 And to be there and to think that this could be the one,

1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:43.760
 like, why not, you know?

1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:46.120
 I'm not a religious person at all,

1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:48.480
 even though I very much have to seem,

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:50.800
 it seems to bang on the drum about the usefulness

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:53.600
 or understanding the usefulness of religion for people.

1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:58.300
 But, you know, if I gotta do something,

1:34:58.300 --> 1:34:59.840
 then yeah, put me in Valhalla, man.

1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:00.960
 I don't wanna be anywhere else.

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.800
 Nothing else seems like a good place for me to be.

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.200
 I wanna fight all day long and feast all night.

1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:07.720
 You know, it sounds great.

1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:11.960
 I saw you throw your hat into the ring of Fader Emelianenko.

1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:13.280
 Yes.

1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:14.440
 He got COVID, I guess.

1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.720
 I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good,

1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:18.560
 if not better.

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:19.380
 Epic with that.

1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:21.960
 Did I understand correctly that might be his last fight?

1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.120
 Yes, that's my understanding.

1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:25.400
 And it would be epic as hell.

1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:26.600
 And it would be epic as hell

1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:31.200
 because the person that I wanna give my most to

1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:32.980
 is a person that I respect,

1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:37.980
 especially at this long career of mine

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:41.000
 and getting at this twilight years.

1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.360
 It's like two warriors.

1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:45.300
 And that's the thing about even this going in there

1:35:45.300 --> 1:35:47.880
 with the aspect of being with death and all that

1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.040
 is that when that person is in there,

1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:52.920
 they are my brother with me in this.

1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:55.120
 And so when you give me your best,

1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:58.200
 even if I win dominant fashion,

1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:00.520
 but if you show up and you're as authentic

1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:03.000
 and being here as I am, then I love you.

1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:04.220
 And I'm glad for you to be here.

1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:05.320
 And we're in this together.

1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:10.320
 And at this point, your loss or my loss or whatever

1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:14.560
 is no less deserving of veneration than the win.

1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:15.880
 Like we're here in this.

1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:18.040
 And so to be in the ring with Führer

1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:21.360
 and to venerate him in win or defeat,

1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:26.360
 to be in there with someone like that is, to me,

1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:30.320
 it's so rare, so.

1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:33.200
 It's incredible how the ultimate violence

1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:37.760
 is coupled with love or respect.

1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:42.760
 And it's weird how the competition in its violent form

1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:50.400
 is also a veneration of just human connection.

1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:51.240
 Human connection.

1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:52.320
 It's also the removal.

1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:55.640
 I feel like it's the purest, one of the purest ways,

1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:59.120
 purest, most honest places a person can exist.

1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:00.880
 That line in Fight Club, you don't know really

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:02.120
 who you are until you've been in a fight.

1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:03.520
 I mean, I believe that.

1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:06.440
 And I've seen so many examples of people

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:09.460
 trying to portray themselves as one thing.

1:37:09.460 --> 1:37:12.840
 And then in the ring, you see who they really are.

1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:15.160
 Or even when they're trying to portray themselves

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:18.060
 as one thing and they're winning,

1:37:18.060 --> 1:37:21.240
 the crowd, at times, will see who they really are

1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:22.880
 and still hate them, you know?

1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:25.720
 And it's like, well, I said all the good things.

1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:27.720
 Bro, don't work that way.

1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:29.440
 Yeah, but speaking of Führer,

1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:31.440
 if we take you out of the picture,

1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:33.680
 who are the greatest mixed martial arts fighters

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:34.520
 of all time?

1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:36.720
 I feel.

1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:38.240
 You out of the picture.

1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:40.640
 As a cop out, to some degree,

1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:43.980
 I feel like we need a little bit more time, you know?

1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:47.340
 So, to see how this unfolds.

1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:48.800
 Because you gotta compare a lot of things.

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.400
 And I, did I, I think I'm.

1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:53.240
 Like centuries?

1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:54.120
 I did an interview.

1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:55.080
 I don't know about centuries.

1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.200
 But that would help if we can keep accurate records

1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.620
 and not allow too much bias to fall in.

1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:02.460
 Too much propaganda.

1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:03.600
 The victor's still there, right?

1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:08.600
 Yeah, but I made an argument.

1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:13.000
 I was in, I get a, it was a interview

1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.400
 with an MMA outlet of some sort.

1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:16.320
 And I can't recall who it was.

1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:18.860
 But, oh, it was an argument about

1:38:18.860 --> 1:38:23.860
 will the winner of Cain Velasquez versus Steve Amiocik

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:26.540
 be the greatest MMA heavyweight of all time?

1:38:26.540 --> 1:38:29.160
 And I said, fucking no way.

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.040
 Oh no, it was Cormier Amiocik.

1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:32.000
 That's what it was.

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.440
 I said, absolutely not.

1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:35.160
 Not even close.

1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:37.360
 And I said, these guys need a bit more time

1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:39.320
 to see how things go.

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.160
 And also how things go for some of their opponents.

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:43.600
 And like, there's more factors than just this one fight.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:44.440
 It really is.

1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:47.680
 And I go, and when you wanna weigh these people,

1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:50.900
 even if let's say, we'll bring Alistair Overeem

1:38:50.900 --> 1:38:52.780
 into the end of the equation.

1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:56.080
 Okay, you judge him on what you know now,

1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:58.440
 what he's done for you lately, okay?

1:38:58.440 --> 1:38:59.340
 Right.

1:38:59.340 --> 1:39:01.920
 Which is a very myopic way of doing it.

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.560
 What has he done over his career?

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.440
 K1 champion.

1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:10.520
 He was a champion in DREAM.

1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:13.920
 He, Strike Force, blah, blah, blah.

1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:15.640
 His overall record.

1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:18.160
 The entirety of all the different opponents he's fought.

1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.620
 And I just sit back and I go, okay, he's not the UFC champ.

1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:27.300
 But his accolades, his merits,

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:32.940
 in some ways, actually stand up higher

1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:35.520
 than Cormier's and Amiocik's.

1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:38.760
 So what about the moments, do you give much value

1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:42.840
 to the special moments, like the highest heights

1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:46.560
 you rise to, not in terms of records or the strikes landed,

1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:50.280
 but just creating a magical moment in a fight?

1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:52.320
 It doesn't have to be even a championship fight,

1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:55.440
 but just, Conor McGregor is an example

1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:57.040
 of somebody who creates a narrative,

1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:59.120
 who creates a story, who creates a drama,

1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:02.440
 and a special magic happens, even if it's like, not with.

1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:04.360
 Myth is greater than reality.

1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:05.480
 And that is always the case.

1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:06.320
 But do you.

1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:08.200
 And so I understand that so very much,

1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:12.960
 and it takes an asshole like me to poo poo on your myth.

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:14.960
 They at least get you, at the end of the day,

1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.480
 you're not gonna abandon your myth,

1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.480
 but perhaps temper it with the facts and logic.

1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:24.080
 So you're not a fan of myth?

1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:26.500
 No, I'm an absolute massive fan of myth.

1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:28.040
 But you prefer facts and logic.

1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:29.720
 It's like when I, no, I mean.

1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.280
 I like saying facts and logic, because people,

1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:36.200
 I also, I am not a materialist in that sense.

1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.680
 I don't think that materialism can solve for everything.

1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:39.520
 It's not enough.

1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:41.320
 It's not robust enough, I'm sorry.

1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.240
 If facts and logic and, or reason,

1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:46.520
 as the Enlightenment scholars all thought,

1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:49.600
 including Marx, was enough for people,

1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.320
 then we would never, we wouldn't have any religions.

1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:55.360
 We wouldn't have any, like there would be no,

1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:56.760
 we wouldn't have narratives and myths

1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:58.060
 and all this kind of stuff.

1:40:58.060 --> 1:41:00.480
 It would not, it just, I'm sorry, there is no,

1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:04.000
 there's nothing about history that supports the idea

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:07.660
 that rationality will overcome all.

1:41:07.660 --> 1:41:09.640
 There's something about Ben Shapiro's facts

1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:10.880
 don't care about your feelings,

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:14.880
 that feels to be miss, feels to be missing

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.600
 something fundamental about human nature.

1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:20.200
 It's not clear to me exactly what is missing.

1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:24.720
 To give old Ben a fair shake.

1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.240
 And I don't know Ben Shapiro.

1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:29.000
 I don't really listen to Ben Shapiro,

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:30.720
 not against Ben Shapiro.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:33.560
 I don't, I'm not here to say anything

1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:35.840
 particularly bad about him.

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.200
 Although I will say at one time,

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:39.700
 Tom Arnold was seemingly trying to pick

1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:42.180
 an actionable fight with Ben Shapiro.

1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:43.020
 In the ring.

1:41:43.020 --> 1:41:44.600
 Or in the. Somewhere, yeah.

1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:46.280
 And I just, and I actually responded,

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:48.200
 I like, and I tried to get him to clarify,

1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:50.880
 I said, hey, are you saying that you want to fight

1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:52.920
 Ben Shapiro, that you're looking to actually,

1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:54.480
 because I was waiting for him to say something

1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:56.020
 and then I can be like, okay, well,

1:41:56.020 --> 1:41:58.120
 it's one thing to want to get into a fight with someone.

1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:01.160
 It's another thing to go pick on a little tiny,

1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:04.520
 you know, guy like Ben, who's much smaller than you

1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:06.280
 and doesn't train or whatever, but you know,

1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:08.360
 if it's not me, I can find someone your size

1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:09.800
 and you can go fight him.

1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.440
 You know, don't be a, basically,

1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:13.480
 don't be a bully piece of shit.

1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:15.520
 Yeah. You know, which by the way,

1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:17.480
 Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget.

1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:20.220
 You are never going to be able to compete

1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:22.040
 even with Ben Shapiro in an argument

1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:23.920
 on any level about anything.

1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.000
 Oh, intellectual argument.

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.640
 Yeah, intellectual argument.

1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:29.600
 Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever.

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:34.600
 But nevertheless, in the discussion of greatness in fighting.

1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.640
 I think you need to look at some of the numbers.

1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:39.120
 You need to look at some of the numbers.

1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:40.240
 And there's the magic.

1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:42.920
 There is some context also in that,

1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:45.200
 where did Alistair Overeem fight?

1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:47.400
 Oh, he fought in Pride, where you could soccer kick people

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:48.840
 and stomp their head and this and that.

1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:53.360
 And so the game environment is actually different too.

1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:55.720
 There's more uncertainty, there's more chaos in Pride,

1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:56.560
 there's more.

1:42:56.560 --> 1:42:58.800
 Go back a little further and go like,

1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:00.200
 what about the guys that used to,

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:02.880
 like Dan Severn fought bare knuckle,

1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:04.480
 head butts, the whole nine.

1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:05.560
 You beat Dan Severn, right?

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:06.560
 I did beat Dan Severn.

1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:08.960
 That was killing an idol, so to speak.

1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:11.520
 Although I didn't really kill him because I still love him.

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:13.360
 He's still an, I mean, he's still responsible

1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.400
 for inspiration along this whole pathway.

1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:21.400
 It's meeting your God and then putting a knife in it,

1:43:21.400 --> 1:43:22.240
 I guess.

1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:27.000
 Realizing they're human and then bringing them down

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:27.840
 to your level.

1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:31.360
 Exactly, but also there's a huge misconception there

1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:33.040
 and that is that I could bring,

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.800
 maybe I could bring Dan Severn down to my level,

1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:38.680
 but I couldn't bring his mustache down to my level.

1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:41.160
 It is of mythic proportions and...

1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:42.840
 Greater than yours.

1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:44.560
 Your facial hair is greater than yours.

1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:47.920
 My facial hair is creating its own legacy,

1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:50.320
 but it is not Dan Severn mustache level

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:52.680
 or now Don Fry mustache.

1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:55.760
 So Don Fry mustache, Dan Severn mustache.

1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:58.440
 Now you have like Shia versus Sunni.

1:43:58.440 --> 1:43:59.280
 Right.

1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:00.120
 Yeah.

1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:00.960
 Yeah.

1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:04.320
 You think there'll be a Karl Marx painting

1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:06.440
 of Josh Barnett one day with the beard

1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:08.160
 and is that basically what you're trying to say?

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.000
 I hope so.

1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:12.120
 I will actually comb my hair, unlike Marx, but...

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:16.440
 Chaos has a charm to it.

1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:17.400
 It does, it does.

1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:20.400
 I mean, we all thought Doc Brown in Back to the Future

1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:22.240
 was quite charming.

1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:23.760
 You have to throw that into the calculation

1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:24.800
 where they fought.

1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:25.640
 Yes.

1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:26.480
 This is the interesting thing.

1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:27.320
 And the rules that they fought under.

1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:32.320
 Some guy like Eerov Chanchin won a 32 man tournament

1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:33.260
 or something like that.

1:44:33.260 --> 1:44:34.300
 I go, okay.

1:44:36.420 --> 1:44:39.480
 Steepa and Daniel Cormier are awesome

1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.480
 and they will for sure be revered for their careers.

1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.560
 100%.

1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:52.480
 Can you say that they're particularly even better overall

1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:53.960
 than Eerov Chanchin?

1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:55.780
 Well, maybe one of them could have beat them.

1:44:55.780 --> 1:44:57.560
 Maybe one of them wouldn't have.

1:44:57.560 --> 1:44:59.640
 Maybe Eerov would have got them

1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:01.040
 with the knuckles right away.

1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:02.400
 Well, maybe if they fought them in pride,

1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:03.240
 they wouldn't have won.

1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:05.700
 Maybe if they fought them bare knuckle, they wouldn't won.

1:45:05.700 --> 1:45:06.540
 I don't know.

1:45:06.540 --> 1:45:07.720
 And there's something about the chaos,

1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:11.240
 like do you put Royce Gracie in the top 10?

1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:12.240
 There's something about...

1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:17.240
 Top 10 of all time in terms of competitors is capable.

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:19.860
 I don't know.

1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:20.700
 I'd have to think about that.

1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:24.520
 Maybe not, but I put Royce Gracie as like pyramid level.

1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:28.600
 Like, wow, dude, what an amazing man.

1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:29.920
 Yeah, he's so important.

1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:32.000
 Absolutely, incredibly important.

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.200
 But there's something about stepping into,

1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:37.760
 like fighting another human being

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:40.640
 under all the uncertainty that the early UFCs had.

1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:41.680
 I mean, you don't know.

1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:42.520
 Yup.

1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:43.520
 What is going to happen?

1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:46.780
 And coupled that with not much money.

1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:47.640
 Yup.

1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:48.480
 All of it.

1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:49.320
 Yes.

1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:50.440
 So the purity of it too.

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:51.680
 There's something about money.

1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:54.040
 I mean, I guess it's shit for that cat post world,

1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:57.200
 but that ruins the purity of the violence.

1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:00.880
 Yeah, people given the opportunity for...

1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:03.280
 Yeah, yeah.

1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:04.680
 The bigger things get, the more...

1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:07.280
 I love the fact that fighting has opened up

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.280
 to such a degree that the career business side of it,

1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:16.400
 because I absolutely distinctly separate the two.

1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:18.600
 The business side of it has opened up

1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.260
 to give me far more possibilities,

1:46:20.260 --> 1:46:23.160
 opened way more doors for me than I ever intended it to.

1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:29.840
 Whereas the athlete side of things has,

1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:33.680
 if anything, just gotten substantially worse, I would say.

1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:38.680
 And some of this is due to the nature of all games

1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:44.480
 will be learned, will be gamed

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.800
 without even the rules being broken.

1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.240
 And once that's figured out, you need to make an adjustment.

1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:53.660
 No adjustments have been made.

1:46:53.660 --> 1:46:56.480
 So the game just appears to be the same game

1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:59.520
 over and over and over and over and over again

1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:02.720
 on ESPN+, on whatever, on whatever, on whatever.

1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:04.680
 It doesn't really matter which night you watch.

1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.880
 It's the same game constantly.

1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:11.880
 And that's not because the athletes are worse or better.

1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:16.460
 It's because they have had that game structure long enough

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:19.040
 that they figured out what do you do

1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:21.280
 to be the most successful at it?

1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:23.320
 What is the highest percentage way of approaching it,

1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:26.240
 essentially, even if you're not thinking of percentages?

1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:28.040
 What were the...

1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:30.000
 If we take a step back, it's really fascinating

1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:31.880
 to think about the early UFCs.

1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:33.640
 Did you fight Dan Severn in the UFC?

1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:35.240
 I fought him in Super Brawl.

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:37.160
 Super Brawl, so that was in the early, early days,

1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:38.600
 your undefeated... 2000.

1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.480
 What were those early days, let's say,

1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:45.400
 of mixed martial arts like?

1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:49.160
 Let me tell you the day of high adventure.

1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:54.160
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:55.400
 Yeah, it is.

1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:56.680
 It was so much fun.

1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:01.680
 And it made you feel absolutely like you were a part of a novel,

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:04.480
 a comic book.

1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:08.880
 I mean, I would love to transcribe my experiences

1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:11.720
 as what I consider a second generation MMA athlete,

1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:18.000
 except I'm way too sensitive to anybody's personal,

1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.360
 any things that are not even to...

1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:26.640
 I'm not a gossipy person.

1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:29.920
 I really do believe that small people talk about others.

1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:31.680
 Big people talk about ideas.

1:48:34.220 --> 1:48:36.940
 But there's just some stories that you can't tell

1:48:36.940 --> 1:48:38.240
 without telling the whole story.

1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:43.240
 And there are so many amazing stories that could be told.

1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:45.800
 People being at their best, people being at their worst.

1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.120
 Yeah, the whole niche of gossip.

1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:51.840
 Is there something you could speak to the chaos of the time?

1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:53.160
 Oh, 100%.

1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:57.760
 Well, okay, so we at AMC got connected to somebody

1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:00.040
 that was throwing an event in Nampa, Idaho,

1:49:00.040 --> 1:49:02.240
 and we all piled into this.

1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:07.140
 And Matt Humes, Subaru Wagon, and we jammed out.

1:49:07.140 --> 1:49:10.880
 And we left Kirkland and we headed over to Idaho,

1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:15.880
 only to find out that there was nothing really put in place.

1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:21.880
 Nothing really put in place, it was absolute disrepair and chaos.

1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:26.200
 They didn't have a rain, they didn't have this.

1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:28.520
 It was such a bullshit adventure.

1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:33.520
 But we were like, well, there's hardly anywhere to fight.

1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:36.280
 It's tough to find these opportunities.

1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:39.400
 So, okay, well, how about this?

1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:42.960
 Whoever is here to fight and is willing,

1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.040
 all right, well, since there's no venue, there's no this,

1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:48.680
 whatever, we all got gloves, we got mouthpieces,

1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.640
 we'll just go to the park, as long as we still get paid.

1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:56.240
 And so folks were kind of like, I don't know about that.

1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:01.240
 The guy I was gonna fight was, he finally gets information

1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:05.560
 on who I actually am, and I was undefeated at the time.

1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:09.320
 I think I had fought Super Brawl 13

1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:10.480
 and already won that tournament.

1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:13.960
 And so he's like, yeah, I had no clue.

1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:16.920
 I'm so glad we didn't fight, you would have murdered me.

1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:18.360
 What a setup.

1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:21.760
 And eventually Matt had to strong arm the guy

1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:24.080
 and get our money that we were supposed to all get

1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:25.560
 and drive back.

1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:27.320
 And because his whole position was,

1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:28.440
 well, there ain't no fucking way,

1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:31.560
 we drove all the way out here for free.

1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:35.440
 This is on you, you fucked this up, not my problem.

1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:38.360
 But what is my problem is the lack of cash in my account.

1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.360
 So fix it, or me fighting my first organized fight

1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:50.400
 against an AMC guy on 11 days notice

1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:54.560
 through a connection to an old wrestling coach I had.

1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:59.560
 And I just gathered up with all my old martial arts instructor

1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:04.760
 that I had worked with and we grappled in his apartment.

1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:07.520
 We did tie pads in the park.

1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:10.960
 I ran a couple miles every day and then,

1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:12.160
 all right, boom, show it up.

1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:14.600
 Won my fight by front choke in two minutes.

1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:19.360
 And then Matt goes, okay, well, hey, you did really great.

1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:21.240
 We'd like you to come back and fight again in the summer.

1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:22.440
 What do you think?

1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:24.920
 Okay, go back off the university.

1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:28.440
 And then I think, hmm, well, that fight didn't go exactly

1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:29.920
 as how I wanted it to.

1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:33.680
 So I gotta find a way to get more experience.

1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:37.520
 I would literally fight people in the university,

1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:40.920
 like rec center on the old wrestling mats,

1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:42.480
 as they didn't know I had a wrestling team.

1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:44.480
 I would find anyone doing martial arts,

1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:46.480
 anyone talking about getting into street fights,

1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:48.520
 anyone, whatever, and just basically go,

1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:50.480
 oh, you ever watch UFC?

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:51.840
 Yeah, yeah, that stuff's cool.

1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:52.680
 What do you think?

1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:55.160
 Oh, man, I'm super into it, man, it's badass.

1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:56.000
 Rad.

1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.240
 So would you wanna fight?

1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:04.000
 Would you wanna fight? I mean, it was way easier picking fights

1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.320
 than it was, you know, getting a girlfriend.

1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:10.160
 So I just, you know, path least resistance.

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:11.920
 I think it might be useful for us

1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:14.320
 to get some advice from you.

1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:15.240
 Yeah, all right.

1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:16.960
 Because you've accomplished,

1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:21.120
 for the journey of a martial artist first,

1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:23.960
 if you accomplish some of the greatest accolades

1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:27.240
 there is in the sport, if somebody who's starting out now,

1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:31.800
 or early on in their journey, what advice would you give

1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:36.800
 on how to become a martial artist, catch wrestler, a fighter?

1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:41.800
 Well, I mean, really what it comes down to

1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:43.480
 is do it because you love it.

1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:46.200
 Do it for that reason and that reason alone.

1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:49.400
 Most people that get into this

1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.320
 and attempt to make any sort of professional inroads with it,

1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:55.560
 you are not going to be the world champion.

1:52:55.560 --> 1:52:59.160
 You probably will never even fight for a belt

1:52:59.160 --> 1:53:03.320
 and you're probably not going to net make money at this.

1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:06.160
 So don't do it for those reasons.

1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:08.240
 Do it for the reason of the passion.

1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:10.320
 Do it for the reason to be the absolute best

1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:13.080
 that you can be, whatever that ends up being.

1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:16.960
 You might at best only be mediocre,

1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:18.800
 but you won't even be mediocre if you don't do it

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:20.320
 like you really mean it.

1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:21.160
 So.

1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:24.400
 The passion, look, where is the kernel of the passion,

1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:26.640
 would you say, is it in the learning process itself,

1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:27.680
 the improvement?

1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:29.480
 I think it really depends on the person, right?

1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:32.960
 I mean, there's some people that really love the fact of,

1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:36.160
 they feel like they're growing, right?

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:38.600
 Well to power, you're growing, growing stronger,

1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:39.440
 growing better.

1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:44.640
 The idea of eliminating weakness.

1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:48.640
 So, to which I'll quickly define weakness

1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:51.200
 as just like things that weaken you,

1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:53.680
 not like being physically weak.

1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:55.280
 Sure, you could call that weakness,

1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:57.680
 but maybe you're not meant to be a super strong guy.

1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:02.360
 But choosing to be weak is really a different story

1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:03.200
 other than just like,

1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:07.360
 we're all deficient in some way or another.

1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:10.400
 So that's neither here nor there.

1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:12.120
 It's a matter of what you decide to do with it.

1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:13.640
 And that's different from strength and weakness,

1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:14.800
 at least the way I look at it.

1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:16.440
 Like strength is choosing,

1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:19.720
 regardless of the difficulty, to make improvements.

1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:23.200
 Strength is even choosing to acknowledge that you do lack.

1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:27.480
 And accept it and then make a decision what to do with it.

1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:30.760
 Yeah, but there's also, there's a bunch of stuff

1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:32.560
 that just like you said, it's what you're drawn to.

1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:34.960
 There's an honesty to just grappling

1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:38.280
 that it seems more real than anything else you can do.

1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.120
 Sure, well and also.

1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:41.160
 And that's where the passion and love can come from.

1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:43.920
 Yeah, I mean, being in an environment, hopefully,

1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:47.680
 that is as true as possible, would be a starter.

1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:52.360
 So, it's hard to be a bullshit person

1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:55.520
 when you're literally trying to tear each other's arms off.

1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:56.360
 Yeah.

1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:58.840
 You know, you really sort of see who somebody is.

1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:01.520
 I also feel like you really get to see somebody who,

1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:03.160
 there are a couple instances where you really see

1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:07.040
 who people are on the mats and in the bedroom.

1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:12.040
 So, even the aspect of self betterment,

1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:19.000
 growth along a path.

1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.720
 I mean, hell, that's part of the divisive capture

1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:26.440
 for martial arts as a business.

1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:29.000
 Give you a belt, put a stripe on your belt.

1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.560
 Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks.

1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:33.400
 So, you know.

1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:35.400
 But there's a benefit to that too.

1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:38.200
 I really enjoyed the progression of belts.

1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:39.040
 Sure.

1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:41.360
 You know, a bit of it is OCD or whatever,

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:44.280
 but you're enjoying the recognition, your growth

1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:46.440
 when you feel, when you're made to feel,

1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:48.840
 when I think genuinely you do earn it.

1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:49.680
 Yeah.

1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:50.500
 I agree.

1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:51.340
 I agree.

1:55:51.340 --> 1:55:52.900
 It makes complete sense to me.

1:55:52.900 --> 1:55:56.860
 It just, it's anything that is, has a goodness

1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:00.560
 in its purity can also have a detriment in its perversion.

1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:01.400
 So.

1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.340
 And there's a value to competition.

1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:06.320
 I've gotten some shit in the past for saying this.

1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:11.320
 I've gotten the most value in giving everything I have

1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:15.900
 to try to win and lose.

1:56:15.900 --> 1:56:18.700
 So like, I've gotten, I remember most of the matches

1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:23.560
 I've lost and I think that's what I've gotten the most

1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:25.160
 from the sport is losing.

1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:26.000
 Think about it.

1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:27.600
 I mean, if you really think about it,

1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:34.120
 what makes you wanna actually, in detail,

1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:36.940
 go over what happened?

1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:39.000
 Oh, it's the time when you didn't get what you wanted.

1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:39.840
 Yeah.

1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:41.580
 It's a time when you gave it everything you had

1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:42.880
 and you came up short.

1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:43.720
 Right.

1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:45.360
 Or failed miserably.

1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:46.200
 Okay, so.

1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:47.840
 Especially if you're embarrassed in some way.

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:48.680
 Right.

1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:52.040
 It's usually the only time people, again, calamity,

1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:54.040
 is the impetus for them to actually turn around

1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:55.760
 and go, who the fuck am I?

1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:57.760
 What am I doing and why am I doing it?

1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:02.380
 Instead of naturally going, hmm, okay, well I won.

1:57:02.380 --> 1:57:03.300
 Why?

1:57:03.300 --> 1:57:04.140
 What was it the cause?

1:57:04.140 --> 1:57:08.720
 And so I think part of my success is that when I win,

1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:09.840
 I'm brutal.

1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:11.880
 When I lose, I'm brutal.

1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:13.760
 And there is no in between.

1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:18.760
 So I remember losing the rematch against Noguera.

1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:24.360
 And I still feel like it was a bullshit call.

1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:25.560
 I feel like I won that fight.

1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:30.320
 But my opinion is that, and this even came up,

1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:32.960
 so one of the coaches in the back was like,

1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:35.920
 oh, you did great, don't feel bad, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:36.880
 And I go, no, fuck that.

1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:38.000
 I didn't finish him.

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:39.920
 I allowed the referees to make a judge,

1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:42.360
 a decision that I think is incorrect and bad,

1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.920
 but that came because I didn't take him out.

1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:46.560
 Fuck that, no, no.

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:48.360
 He won, he's gonna get more money,

1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:49.680
 he's gonna get more recognition,

1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:51.080
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:53.480
 I accept all this and it's not okay.

1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:57.160
 And I need to, when I get a chance to fight him again,

1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:00.320
 I gotta figure out how to take this guy out.

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:01.520
 I don't wanna say forever.

1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:03.040
 I'm not trying to put him six feet underground.

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:04.620
 Well, when I fight, yes I am.

1:58:04.620 --> 1:58:09.000
 But the point being, I need to find a way to,

1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:10.640
 this is definitive.

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.640
 You don't get to say shit about it

1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:15.080
 because I'm the only one who can stand right now.

1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:16.480
 That's the way it's gotta be.

1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:19.740
 Anything less than that is not good enough.

1:58:19.740 --> 1:58:22.880
 And even if I achieve that, then I gotta figure out,

1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:25.300
 okay, it's not a given.

1:58:25.300 --> 1:58:26.560
 How did I get to this point?

1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:27.920
 How did I make that happen?

1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:32.680
 Was it simply because of his own mistakes

1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:36.960
 or was it because of my successful action?

1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:38.680
 So it's always self critical.

1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:40.480
 Always, constantly.

1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:42.480
 You love movies.

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:44.000
 I read this somewhere.

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:45.720
 You mentioned Blade Runner is a favorite.

1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:47.520
 Number one of all time, the final cut.

1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:48.760
 That's my go to.

1:58:48.760 --> 1:58:51.560
 So you would say Blade Runner

1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:52.800
 is the greatest movie of all time.

1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:54.840
 It's one of the greatest movies of all time.

1:58:54.840 --> 1:58:55.760
 And it is my number.

1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:56.840
 What's in the top?

1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:01.400
 My top five, Blade Runner, final cut.

1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:03.240
 This is the original Blade Runner.

1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:06.920
 And I used to own, on tape, the original.

1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:07.760
 VHS?

1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:08.920
 The original cut, yeah.

1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:11.800
 And I had the director's cut on DVD.

1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:13.360
 Why Blade Runner, by the way?

1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:15.440
 What connects you to it?

1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:17.120
 As a kid, I just thought it was so cool.

1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:18.620
 There was something about it that really spoke to me.

1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:20.160
 The whole cyberpunk landscapes

1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:25.160
 and this guy chasing down rogue androids, replicants,

1:59:26.420 --> 1:59:27.840
 and all this.

1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:31.200
 Is it just the entire cyberpunk universe

1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:33.000
 or is it just robots as well?

1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:37.000
 No, I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it.

1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.720
 On the surface, I've always tended towards

1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:42.680
 dark subject matter.

1:59:42.680 --> 1:59:45.560
 Things that are of the dark, so to speak,

1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:48.560
 are things that I've always been gravitated towards.

1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:51.600
 I think maybe part of it is that things that are darker

1:59:51.600 --> 1:59:56.600
 are more accepting and more upfront with death.

2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:03.000
 And perhaps, I think, maybe that is what was...

2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:04.480
 Yeah, somehow more honest, perhaps.

2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:08.760
 I mean, there's also the aspect of rebelliousness, usually.

2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:13.760
 Like, I was never one to wanna just do

2:00:14.680 --> 2:00:17.520
 what somebody told me to do, you know?

2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:22.420
 I'm not sitting around trying to always be

2:00:22.420 --> 2:00:25.360
 such a radical individual that I can't take orders.

2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:28.440
 No, in fact, I'm more than willing to take orders

2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:32.860
 from somebody that I feel is competent and has merit

2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:34.680
 and reason behind what they're doing

2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:36.280
 and makes like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:37.320
 I'm 100% for it.

2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:38.680
 Not only can I take orders,

2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.620
 I will help you achieve whatever it is

2:00:40.620 --> 2:00:45.620
 if I think it's worthwhile, even at my own expense.

2:00:45.940 --> 2:00:49.440
 But to get to that point is a rarity.

2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:51.240
 Like, it's just not a given.

2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:54.080
 And so you can even imagine being a grade school teacher

2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:55.280
 and this kid doesn't respect you

2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:57.880
 and he doesn't really think you're that smart.

2:00:57.880 --> 2:01:00.160
 They don't really appreciate that.

2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:01.640
 So cyberpunk is number one.

2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:02.480
 What else is there?

2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:03.320
 Cyberpunk is kind of number one.

2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.520
 It's an environment I love, but at the same time,

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.160
 Conan the Barbarian by John Milius

2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:09.360
 is one of my favorite films of all time.

2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:15.360
 And you know, that's such a pure film in a way.

2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:17.080
 Like, the motivations are pure.

2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:22.080
 They're very easy to follow, but not lacking in depth.

2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:28.080
 You know, it's not just explosions and teal and orange.

2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:33.080
 It's more on the human condition and I love it.

2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:36.360
 And it's shot incredibly well.

2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:38.280
 It's got an incredible soundtrack.

2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:39.840
 Yeah, I fucking love it.

2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:41.680
 But with Blade Runner also in a deeper sense,

2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:43.320
 you know, again, the human condition.

2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:45.800
 You know, you start seeing like, what is being?

2:01:45.800 --> 2:01:47.640
 What is being human?

2:01:47.640 --> 2:01:51.320
 You know, how does this relate to if you can make it

2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:52.880
 and you can tell it what to do,

2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:56.520
 at what point is it like you should or you shouldn't?

2:01:56.520 --> 2:01:58.920
 You know, why do you get to determine what's alive

2:01:58.920 --> 2:01:59.760
 and what's not?

2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:02.680
 What's a life that should be allowed to live and what isn't?

2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:07.680
 And what would be the strain of being Roy Batty

2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:12.240
 and seeing all these incredible moments

2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:17.120
 that with his passing will no longer exist?

2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:18.920
 Especially if he hasn't had a chance

2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:22.640
 to put that flame into another torch, so to speak.

2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:23.920
 If he hasn't written them down,

2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:26.680
 if he hasn't passed them down to somebody else.

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:30.320
 Gone like tears in the rain.

2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.200
 Like tears in the rain, that scene is incredible.

2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:35.120
 But it's funny, because those two universes

2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:38.000
 are very different, Conan and the Barbarian and Cyberpunk.

2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.120
 Is there, that makes me curious about

2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:43.480
 what else might be in the list at the top.

2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:44.320
 Well, let me think.

2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:45.280
 It's a pretty.

2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:47.640
 Do you like the Godfather type of universe?

2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:49.360
 No, no, I mean, I'm sure the Godfather,

2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:51.240
 I've never actually even watched the whole Godfather.

2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:54.600
 No, but also like, was it Casino, Goodfellas?

2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.960
 Goodfellas is a good movie, but no, that's not in my top.

2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:00.360
 It's a good flick, but it doesn't really do it for me.

2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:03.440
 If people really wanna get into this a little more,

2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:07.200
 I did make a list of 100 of my favorite movies

2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:08.520
 on my Facebook fan page.

2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:09.360
 Nice.

2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:12.160
 Do you remember what like, some of the top.

2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:14.240
 Oh yeah, like Blazing Saddles is on there,

2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:15.700
 Rage of the Lost Ark,

2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:20.700
 Valhalla Rising by Nicholas from Winding Refn,

2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:25.700
 Maniac by William Lustig.

2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:30.700
 It's a 1980 gnarly video nasty horror movie

2:03:31.740 --> 2:03:36.740
 about a serial killer who murders women and scalps them.

2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:41.580
 And it's gnarly as hell and very brutal and very bleak

2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:46.580
 and very, I mean, it's the kind of thing

2:03:46.660 --> 2:03:47.740
 that like a lot of people would have

2:03:47.740 --> 2:03:49.340
 a real hard time watching.

2:03:49.340 --> 2:03:53.100
 But one, again, I like things that are dark,

2:03:53.100 --> 2:03:56.600
 but two, I thought the performances were fantastic

2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:58.740
 in this film and they really got out,

2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:00.300
 I think what the underlying thing was,

2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:05.300
 and it was a guy who was basically just like run amok

2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:08.620
 by the overbearing mother, Jungian archetype.

2:04:08.620 --> 2:04:13.380
 And it, she was, she imparted her insanity into him.

2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:17.140
 And he, but yet there is this aspect you could see

2:04:17.140 --> 2:04:19.580
 of him wanting to try and actually be able

2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:22.820
 to be in the world and have love

2:04:22.820 --> 2:04:27.820
 and have a feminine companionship

2:04:28.380 --> 2:04:31.640
 to go with his masculine aspect.

2:04:31.640 --> 2:04:34.580
 But he had no way of understanding

2:04:34.580 --> 2:04:36.420
 how to really make that happen.

2:04:36.420 --> 2:04:40.220
 And he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine.

2:04:40.220 --> 2:04:44.860
 So his struggle with, and there's a little part

2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:48.660
 in the movie where he somehow comes across

2:04:48.660 --> 2:04:52.860
 this model or something, and they actually,

2:04:52.860 --> 2:04:56.020
 he starts to feel like maybe he might be able

2:04:56.020 --> 2:04:58.860
 to actually have a relationship with somebody

2:04:58.860 --> 2:04:59.700
 and it goes somewhere.

2:04:59.700 --> 2:05:04.140
 But yeah, even the Elijah Wood remake I felt was

2:05:04.140 --> 2:05:06.300
 really well done and captured most of the essence

2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:07.380
 of what the movie was about.

2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:09.540
 But I still feel like the original

2:05:09.540 --> 2:05:12.540
 by William Lustig is the best.

2:05:12.540 --> 2:05:16.860
 What's the greatest love movie of all time?

2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:18.860
 Greatest love movie of all time.

2:05:18.860 --> 2:05:20.460
 So like something where love is, I mean,

2:05:20.460 --> 2:05:22.780
 I suppose love underlies most of these movies,

2:05:22.780 --> 2:05:23.980
 and especially like The Dark.

2:05:23.980 --> 2:05:27.940
 I mean hell, Takashi Miike's films are all about family

2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:30.620
 of all things, as bonkers as those movies are.

2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:34.660
 They, the general theme is family almost entirely

2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:36.980
 in all of his films.

2:05:36.980 --> 2:05:39.820
 Yeah, there's very, I mean, even you can argue later on.

2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:41.300
 Yeah, it's everywhere.

2:05:41.300 --> 2:05:43.140
 Greatest love film of all time.

2:05:45.660 --> 2:05:48.660
 That's, I mean, is Excalibur a film about love?

2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:51.340
 What's Excalibur about?

2:05:51.340 --> 2:05:52.180
 King Arthur.

2:05:53.060 --> 2:05:57.740
 Excalibur is about Arthur becoming king of the Britains

2:05:57.740 --> 2:06:01.540
 and his love of his country and his love of Guinevere.

2:06:01.540 --> 2:06:04.740
 But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about

2:06:06.860 --> 2:06:10.940
 the necessity for the king to love,

2:06:10.940 --> 2:06:15.940
 to hold Excalibur, to stay, to realize that while,

2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:19.660
 if you're the king, you can love your wife

2:06:19.660 --> 2:06:21.380
 and you can love your best friend,

2:06:21.380 --> 2:06:25.900
 and they may fuck each other behind your back

2:06:25.900 --> 2:06:27.820
 and as they fall in love too.

2:06:27.820 --> 2:06:29.540
 But at the end of the day, your responsibility,

2:06:29.540 --> 2:06:33.340
 your love has to be to the country and everyone else first

2:06:33.340 --> 2:06:36.620
 and not your own personal wants,

2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:40.340
 which, you know, made a much more interesting story

2:06:40.340 --> 2:06:45.340
 when you have Carmen Berenna and oh, oh, what is that one?

2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:50.540
 It's a German opera, but you know, and horses and slow mo

2:06:50.540 --> 2:06:53.380
 and sword fights and an epic death scene

2:06:53.380 --> 2:06:56.860
 between Arthur and his son.

2:06:56.860 --> 2:06:58.220
 Okay, now I definitely have to watch it

2:06:58.220 --> 2:07:01.060
 and Evan watched it and embarrassed me.

2:07:01.060 --> 2:07:05.300
 It is John Boorman's second film in Hollywood,

2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:07.420
 his first one being Point Blank with Lee Marvin,

2:07:07.420 --> 2:07:10.460
 which is also on top, one of the upper echelon movies

2:07:10.460 --> 2:07:15.460
 on my list, derived from a book called The Outfit by,

2:07:19.180 --> 2:07:20.380
 what is his name?

2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:25.220
 I forget, but Darwin Cook, the comic illustrator,

2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:28.780
 Donald Westlake wrote, so Darwin Cook does an amazing

2:07:28.780 --> 2:07:31.240
 comic book send up of Darwin Cook's novels

2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:33.820
 and they are fucking incredible.

2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:37.720
 So anyways, but the Point Blank with Lee Marvin,

2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:43.180
 you know, it's a man driven by purpose, revenge,

2:07:43.180 --> 2:07:46.620
 but also by like really pure motivations.

2:07:46.620 --> 2:07:51.620
 He wants his money, he was betrayed and he wants his cash

2:07:52.500 --> 2:07:54.500
 because this is what he agreed to do the thing for

2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:56.780
 and this is, which also is part of the reason

2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:58.540
 why I like No Country for Old Men so much,

2:07:58.540 --> 2:08:02.100
 which I felt was a great movie, even better book,

2:08:02.100 --> 2:08:04.220
 but I remember talking to my friend and I go,

2:08:04.220 --> 2:08:08.760
 you know, Anton Chigurh is the most pure human being

2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:09.940
 in that whole book.

2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:11.140
 Well, that guy's the villain.

2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:13.540
 I go, ha ha, is he evil?

2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:17.260
 He's the one, he lies to no one.

2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.300
 He does everything he says he will do.

2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.380
 He always follows his word and on the rare occasion,

2:08:22.380 --> 2:08:25.740
 he allows fate to make a decision as he figures like,

2:08:25.740 --> 2:08:29.260
 well, whatever all led us to here will lead us

2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:32.100
 one way or the other and if we're at this crossroads,

2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:34.700
 what, how is there any better or worse way

2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:36.500
 than to do it over a coin flip?

2:08:36.500 --> 2:08:39.540
 And so that whole scene where the guy's going,

2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:40.940
 well, what am I putting up?

2:08:40.940 --> 2:08:43.020
 And he goes, everything, you've been putting it up

2:08:43.020 --> 2:08:45.980
 every day of your life and that's true.

2:08:45.980 --> 2:08:50.940
 Everything we do is a decision, is a calling, is a choice.

2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:55.740
 And then it bummed me out that they reduced

2:08:55.740 --> 2:08:57.380
 the last interaction between Chigurh

2:08:57.380 --> 2:09:01.980
 and What's His Face's wife and he finally finds her

2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:03.540
 and she's like, you don't have to do this.

2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:05.580
 I mean, he's like, yes, yes, I do.

2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:06.740
 This is the way it is.

2:09:06.740 --> 2:09:08.220
 You can think that your life could've turned out

2:09:08.220 --> 2:09:09.820
 any sort of way, you could've done this,

2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:11.100
 you could've done that, but the reality is

2:09:11.100 --> 2:09:11.940
 this is the way your life is

2:09:11.940 --> 2:09:14.260
 and it's the way it was always going to be.

2:09:14.260 --> 2:09:17.060
 You know, the fact that I'm here is the end of it

2:09:17.060 --> 2:09:18.580
 and that's that.

2:09:18.580 --> 2:09:21.540
 Yeah, it's funny, if you're honest, this with dark movies

2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:26.540
 reveal that the villains are the purest of humans

2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:30.300
 and can teach us the most profound lessons

2:09:30.300 --> 2:09:32.540
 and that's certainly an example of it.

2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:34.780
 What do you think the big ridiculous

2:09:34.780 --> 2:09:36.700
 last philosophical question, what do you think

2:09:36.700 --> 2:09:39.940
 is the meaning of this whole thing we've got going on

2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:42.940
 of life and existence on Earth from your individual

2:09:42.940 --> 2:09:45.580
 perspective but the entirety of the human species?

2:09:45.580 --> 2:09:48.620
 Life, the universe and everything?

2:09:48.620 --> 2:09:49.460
 Yeah.

2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:51.460
 Don't.

2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:52.300
 Oh.

2:09:56.940 --> 2:09:58.140
 We could just leave it at that.

2:09:58.140 --> 2:09:59.820
 You knew exactly where I was going.

2:09:59.820 --> 2:10:00.660
 I love it.

2:10:00.660 --> 2:10:01.660
 Josh, I love you very much.

2:10:01.660 --> 2:10:03.260
 You've been a huge inspiration.

2:10:03.260 --> 2:10:07.020
 I have a friend who she said,

2:10:07.020 --> 2:10:08.260
 do you know Lex Friedman?

2:10:08.260 --> 2:10:09.580
 Have you gone on Lex's content?

2:10:09.580 --> 2:10:11.860
 And I go, yes, I know Lex Friedman is.

2:10:11.860 --> 2:10:15.420
 I've sadly been way too long in contact

2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:17.740
 without making it happen for too long

2:10:17.740 --> 2:10:21.740
 and yes, I will 100%, I even cut a shirt

2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.100
 at the beginning of the pandemic

2:10:23.100 --> 2:10:25.100
 to make my own little mask at one point

2:10:25.100 --> 2:10:30.100
 due to the Lex process and hello, I was like,

2:10:30.220 --> 2:10:32.380
 I can't really hear you but I'm demonstrating.

2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:36.340
 Just let's see it through but this has been a blast.

2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:39.500
 And next time, next time let's drink

2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:41.020
 some of the Warbringer whiskey.

2:10:41.020 --> 2:10:43.220
 I will bring some Warmaster.

2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:47.780
 I wasn't sure if you were, if you imbibed at all in spirits.

2:10:47.780 --> 2:10:51.540
 100%, it felt a little weird to do it early on

2:10:51.540 --> 2:10:54.060
 in the morning, especially because I'm flying out there.

2:10:54.060 --> 2:10:54.900
 Does it though?

2:10:54.900 --> 2:10:57.660
 I mean, I've had some wonderful morning whiskey at times.

2:10:57.660 --> 2:11:00.940
 It, now that you've mentioned it, it doesn't at all.

2:11:00.940 --> 2:11:03.900
 So next time let's make sure what Joe Organ calls

2:11:03.900 --> 2:11:08.620
 the adult beverages, let's make sure we indulge.

2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:11.220
 I have zero reservations for doing such a thing.

2:11:11.220 --> 2:11:12.500
 I'm into it.

2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:14.020
 Josh, thanks for talking to me.

2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:14.860
 My pleasure.

2:11:15.860 --> 2:11:17.420

2:11:36.300 --> 2:11:39.380
 from Sun Tzu in the art of war.

2:11:39.380 --> 2:11:42.780
 The Supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy

2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:44.540
 without fighting.

2:11:44.540 --> 2:12:09.540
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
