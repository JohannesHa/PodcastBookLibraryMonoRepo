00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
 The following is a conversation with Robert Breedlove,

00:03.080 --> 00:04.920
 someone who caught my attention

00:04.920 --> 00:08.040
 and was recommended highly as a rigorous scholar

00:08.040 --> 00:10.920
 and thinker in the space of decentralized finance

00:10.920 --> 00:12.160
 and Bitcoin.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.200
 His podcast titled What is Money?

00:15.200 --> 00:18.240
 is a good representation of the way his mind works.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.600
 He's willing to talk through ideas for many hours,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.080
 willing to listen, willing to think,

00:24.080 --> 00:26.780
 which makes him a great companion in conversation

00:26.780 --> 00:31.020
 to explore the history, philosophy, and future of money.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.720
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:33.720 --> 00:38.200
 Fundrise, Element, MonkPak, and BetterHelp.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.780
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.920
 As a side note, let me say that I'll have

00:43.920 --> 00:46.000
 a number of conversations in the coming months

00:46.000 --> 00:49.320
 on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.280
 None of these conversations are financial advice.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.800
 That's not a legal warning, that's a genuine description

00:54.800 --> 00:57.500
 of my goals and approach with these chats.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.560
 At least for a while, I personally won't actively invest

01:00.560 --> 01:03.360
 in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies,

01:03.360 --> 01:06.480
 except to learn about the technology itself.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.920
 I don't think this should be a journalistic standard

01:08.920 --> 01:11.320
 like the New York Times trying to establish,

01:11.320 --> 01:13.120
 which I very much disagree with.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.660
 In my humble opinion, I think journalists should be free

01:16.660 --> 01:19.240
 to invest in Bitcoin if they want to.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.460
 Luckily, I'm not a journalist.

01:21.460 --> 01:24.560
 I just know my own psychology and I feel that my thinking

01:24.560 --> 01:26.360
 will be muddled by excitement

01:26.360 --> 01:29.000
 if I invest before I understand.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.320
 I feel the same way about Tesla, for example.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.800
 I still don't own any Tesla stock

01:33.800 --> 01:37.340
 and I am still indeed fascinated by Tesla Autopilot

01:37.340 --> 01:39.500
 as an artificial intelligence system.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.600
 I work hard to be cognizant of the biases

01:42.600 --> 01:47.280
 that arise in my mind and always try to choose the path

01:47.280 --> 01:52.040
 that maximizes or maintains a freedom of thought

01:52.040 --> 01:53.720
 as much as possible.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.200
 Also, let me say that I try to be very careful

01:56.200 --> 01:59.440
 in selecting guests based not only on the contents

01:59.440 --> 02:03.000
 of their ideas, but the richness, complexity, music,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.140
 style of their mind and character.

02:05.140 --> 02:08.020
 Yes, I will talk with people with whom you

02:08.020 --> 02:12.080
 and I may disagree, people who some may call bad

02:12.080 --> 02:14.840
 or even evil human beings.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.100
 I want to understand them because I believe that,

02:18.100 --> 02:22.520
 as Solzhenitsyn said, the battle line between good and evil

02:22.520 --> 02:25.140
 runs through the heart of every man.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.040
 I think if you always run from evil,

02:27.040 --> 02:30.440
 you become blind to the truth of human nature.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.800
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast

02:32.800 --> 02:36.340
 and here is my conversation with Robert Breedlove.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.480
 Rousseau opens his 1762 book, The Social Contract,

02:41.480 --> 02:43.380
 with the following statement.

02:43.380 --> 02:47.460
 "'Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.'"

02:47.460 --> 02:50.800
 So you talk about freedom and sovereignty quite a bit.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.640
 What do these ideas mean to you, the idea of sovereignty?

02:54.640 --> 02:57.840
 Freedom and sovereignty, I think they're very

02:57.840 --> 02:59.020
 closely related.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.740
 Let's start just focusing on sovereignty,

03:01.740 --> 03:04.840
 which is a word I don't think we talk about enough.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.120
 And the general definition of that I would give

03:07.120 --> 03:10.100
 is the authority to act as you see fit.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.840
 And it's a word that's etymologically associated

03:15.840 --> 03:19.280
 with words like monarchy, money, reign.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.520
 So historically, it's referred to whatever the locus

03:23.520 --> 03:26.240
 of supreme power is in the sphere of human action.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.120
 So whether, if you go like back into ancient Egypt,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.400
 the Pharaoh had absolute sovereignty

03:32.400 --> 03:34.800
 and everyone else was pretty much operating

03:34.800 --> 03:36.800
 according to his interests.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.200
 You fast forward to today, modern Western democracy,

03:40.200 --> 03:43.360
 we have more decentralized sovereignty

03:43.360 --> 03:45.380
 and that we all get to go vote and elect officials

03:45.380 --> 03:47.700
 that make decisions on our behalf.

03:47.700 --> 03:51.000
 So the theme of sovereignty across history

03:51.000 --> 03:52.760
 is that it's been gradually decentralizing

03:52.760 --> 03:55.400
 across our different models of socioeconomics.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.100
 And it's largely, you could say it's rooted heavily

04:01.100 --> 04:03.080
 in the money, I would argue,

04:03.080 --> 04:04.700
 which is something we'll get a lot into here,

04:04.700 --> 04:08.320
 where if you have money, you have the authority

04:08.320 --> 04:10.040
 to act as you see fit in the world.

04:11.420 --> 04:14.160
 And even in our current political sphere,

04:14.160 --> 04:17.000
 if you have enough money, you can actually reshape the rules.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.200
 You can reshape laws, you can lobby Congress.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.640
 If you're in a certain situation, like many billionaires,

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
 you can negotiate your own tax treaty

04:26.640 --> 04:28.520
 such that you can get favorable tax treatment

04:28.520 --> 04:30.440
 with certain jurisdictions in the world.

04:30.440 --> 04:35.360
 So this concept of sovereignty, which today we call,

04:35.360 --> 04:39.440
 it's common to call states or nation states

04:39.440 --> 04:41.080
 or government sovereign,

04:41.080 --> 04:43.120
 meaning that they have power over people.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.040
 But as I argue in a lot of my writing,

04:46.040 --> 04:48.000
 I actually think that sovereignty

04:48.000 --> 04:49.960
 and here's within the individual

04:49.960 --> 04:54.720
 and that we each have our own interiorized space of choice,

04:54.720 --> 04:56.120
 which is something like Victor Frankl

04:56.120 --> 04:58.080
 called the final human freedom.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.440
 And that we, no matter what our circumstances are,

05:00.440 --> 05:03.340
 no matter what exogenous situation we face,

05:03.340 --> 05:05.360
 we always have this endogenous power

05:05.360 --> 05:07.640
 to choose how we respond to it.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.280
 That's one of my favorite books is,

05:09.280 --> 05:11.120
 A Man's Search for Meaning.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.360
 Maybe we can break that apart a little bit.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.880
 So you've kind of spoken about sovereignty

05:16.880 --> 05:20.000
 as a closely linked to power,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.240
 but is there something about your own mind

05:22.240 --> 05:25.400
 being able to achieve sovereignty

05:25.400 --> 05:27.260
 no matter what the monetary system is,

05:27.260 --> 05:30.240
 no matter what, who has the control over centralized power,

05:30.240 --> 05:34.040
 the money or whatever the mechanisms of sovereignty

05:34.040 --> 05:35.280
 and the societal level?

05:35.280 --> 05:39.200
 You as an individual, isn't ultimately all boiled down

05:39.200 --> 05:42.560
 to what you can do with your mind, how you see the world?

05:42.560 --> 05:43.600
 How you interpret it.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.040
 Yeah, I agree.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.520
 And as we get a little bit deeper into this,

05:47.520 --> 05:48.680
 I think we'll come to see money

05:48.680 --> 05:50.600
 as an extension of your mind.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.560
 So there's a feedback between money and mind.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.840
 For instance, you think in dollars today,

05:54.840 --> 05:57.440
 almost guarantee it, most of us do here in the US.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.200
 And it's a tool, right?

06:00.200 --> 06:03.320
 It's a tool we're using to decomplexify the world around us,

06:03.320 --> 06:08.320
 to deal with it, to understand the sacrifices and successes

06:08.700 --> 06:10.840
 across an entire history of economic transactions.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.400
 We can boil that all down to the price.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.360
 So it's data compression.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.600
 And if you can change,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.800
 if there's a central body or central governance mechanism

06:20.800 --> 06:21.880
 that can manipulate that money,

06:21.880 --> 06:23.640
 it can have an impact on your mind.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.200
 For instance, today, so I agree with you on the first hand,

06:28.200 --> 06:32.140
 say that I do believe in free will.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.860
 I do believe in individual autonomy,

06:34.860 --> 06:39.160
 but I also think that there are certain devices and powers

06:39.160 --> 06:40.000
 in the world around us

06:40.000 --> 06:42.120
 that can actually influence how we think.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.280
 And it's fascinating to think about the fact

06:44.280 --> 06:46.960
 that money might be actually deeply integrated

06:46.960 --> 06:49.680
 into the way we think and into our mind.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.120
 You think about what are the core aspects of the human mind?

06:54.120 --> 06:56.000
 What influences cognition,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.320
 the way you reason about the world?

06:58.320 --> 07:02.080
 You have the Chomsky languages at the core of everything,

07:02.080 --> 07:06.880
 but you're kind of placing money as pretty close

07:06.880 --> 07:08.660
 to the core of what it means

07:08.660 --> 07:11.960
 to be an intelligent reasoning human.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.440
 I think money is a direct derivation

07:14.440 --> 07:16.120
 of action and speech, actually.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.080
 It's another expression of the logos.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.080
 If we even think of what it means to think

07:23.000 --> 07:26.880
 is that we are generating two different courses of action,

07:26.880 --> 07:28.600
 potential courses of action,

07:28.600 --> 07:31.120
 and we're populating them with avatars, right?

07:31.120 --> 07:32.680
 Maybe ourselves or others.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.000
 And then we're comparing how we may act in each situation

07:36.000 --> 07:37.400
 and what we think the result would be.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.240
 So actually it's comparison.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.880
 Basically it's comparison and contrasting

07:41.880 --> 07:44.260
 of possible courses of action.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.440
 And that's the same thing with words themselves.

07:48.820 --> 07:53.180
 Most words, the vast majority of words

07:53.180 --> 07:55.760
 only have meaning in relationship to other words, right?

07:55.760 --> 07:59.520
 It's all contextual definitions of a word or more words.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.100
 Now people have argued with me about this

08:01.100 --> 08:02.780
 because there is a first word, right?

08:02.780 --> 08:04.920
 Where you pick up rock and say rock.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.300
 But most other words in higher abstraction

08:08.300 --> 08:10.400
 tend to be relative.

08:10.400 --> 08:15.400
 And what's funny about action and speech,

08:15.440 --> 08:18.380
 and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our paper here,

08:18.380 --> 08:21.740
 is that it's linked to evolutionary biology

08:21.740 --> 08:26.400
 and that once human beings adopted upright stance,

08:26.400 --> 08:27.940
 we freed our hands.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.300
 We no longer needed our hands for locomotion.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.040
 So we started to evolve more dexterity

08:34.280 --> 08:35.920
 and notably we have opposable thumbs.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.520
 So this gives us an ability to manipulate

08:38.520 --> 08:39.960
 and particularize the environment

08:39.960 --> 08:42.360
 in a way that most other animals cannot.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.120
 And what's interesting about this is that

08:44.120 --> 08:49.020
 as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources

08:49.020 --> 08:52.040
 and count, point, pointing was a big deal

08:52.040 --> 08:54.640
 and that we could indicate prey

08:54.640 --> 08:56.600
 or items that are far off distance

08:56.600 --> 08:58.200
 and we could organize ourselves.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.240
 At the same time we co evolved this fine musculature

09:04.240 --> 09:05.960
 in the face and tongue.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.920
 So it's as if speech developed,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.960
 co evolved really with our dexterity.

09:10.840 --> 09:15.840
 And as a natural extension of that came us making tools.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.400
 Right, we started to create things

09:18.400 --> 09:21.280
 to better satisfy our wants over time.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.940
 And the most tradable tool in any society

09:24.940 --> 09:26.680
 or the most tradable thing is money.

09:26.680 --> 09:31.240
 So I really, I argue that action and speech

09:31.240 --> 09:35.280
 are quintessential modes of self sovereign expression.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.300
 And the money is just sort of a tech layer

09:37.300 --> 09:38.920
 we've put right on top of that.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.300
 And that it's a natural derivation of action and speech.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.980
 Okay, that's fascinating to think about sovereignty

09:44.980 --> 09:47.240
 from the evolutionary perspective.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.240
 And then ultimately money is the technology layer

09:50.240 --> 09:52.000
 that enables sovereignty.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
 So, you know, it's really fascinating to think about

09:57.360 --> 10:01.120
 our modern human society as deeply rooted

10:01.120 --> 10:03.280
 in these like evolutionary roots

10:03.280 --> 10:05.380
 from the very origins of life on earth.

10:05.380 --> 10:09.780
 So what, you know, some of the ideas you just mentioned,

10:09.780 --> 10:13.080
 what do you see are some interesting characteristics

10:13.080 --> 10:17.140
 of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?

10:18.320 --> 10:20.920
 Like what ideas propagated through,

10:20.920 --> 10:23.540
 have roots in the evolution?

10:23.540 --> 10:28.040
 Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life

10:28.040 --> 10:29.880
 is the territorial imperative.

10:29.880 --> 10:34.880
 So all life is seeking to expand its dominion

10:35.260 --> 10:37.200
 over space and time.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.940
 And we think about, you know, again, physically with space,

10:40.940 --> 10:43.720
 it's advantageous to an animal or an organism

10:43.720 --> 10:45.940
 to have more territory under its control

10:45.940 --> 10:47.920
 to raise offspring.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.660
 So it's all about reproductive fitness

10:49.660 --> 10:50.880
 at the end of the day.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.840
 And then we'd also think of reproduction itself

10:53.840 --> 10:57.000
 as the genetic impulse to have more,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.880
 to replicate oneself across time.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.000
 So it's territoriality across time in a way.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.040
 And this is very common in most animals.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.380
 Not all animals are territorial, but many are.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.000
 And you see very interesting behaviors

11:10.000 --> 11:11.560
 resulting from territoriality.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.800
 This is like animal combat.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.640
 You know, the reason birds sing is territoriality,

11:17.960 --> 11:19.640
 a number of other things.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.600
 And it's my hypothesis and others have shared

11:23.600 --> 11:28.080
 this hypothesis as well, that mankind is clearly,

11:28.080 --> 11:30.280
 I think, would argue a territorial species

11:30.280 --> 11:35.000
 and that he expresses this territoriality in property rights.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.200
 So property, when we hear that word,

11:38.200 --> 11:39.480
 we typically think of an asset.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.220
 We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.080
 But property is actually the socially acknowledged

11:45.080 --> 11:48.140
 relationship between a human and an asset,

11:48.140 --> 11:51.100
 such that you have exclusive rights and responsibilities

11:51.100 --> 11:53.860
 to a particular asset.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.480
 It is not the asset itself.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.480
 So property, it's information, it's a relationship.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.120
 By the way, my mind was just blown.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.200
 Property is information, it's not the actual asset.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.580
 That's really important.

12:05.580 --> 12:06.560
 Very important.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.520
 That's really interesting.

12:07.520 --> 12:12.520
 Yeah, and then it comes down to how do we organize ourselves

12:12.520 --> 12:17.520
 such that property, that the contributions people are making

12:19.400 --> 12:22.160
 are commensurate with the consideration they're receiving.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.720
 So if you're adding value to a piece of property,

12:24.720 --> 12:27.920
 you're developing a piece of land for use,

12:27.920 --> 12:31.880
 in theory, to be fair, you should have the rights

12:31.880 --> 12:34.100
 to that fruit if you go out and plant a garden

12:34.100 --> 12:35.200
 or whatever it may be.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.640
 And this is rooted in natural law,

12:41.640 --> 12:44.440
 where we have rights to life, liberty, and property.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.000
 Those are kind of just the base,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.920
 the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly.

12:49.920 --> 12:54.320
 And you could think of, to get really primordial with it,

12:54.320 --> 12:57.960
 the first capitalist in the world,

12:57.960 --> 12:59.700
 just to kind of get some definitions out here,

12:59.700 --> 13:03.960
 I'll say capitalism versus communism or socialism

13:03.960 --> 13:06.040
 as the spectrum I'll speak on.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.400
 The first capitalist in the world would be the guy,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.380
 the caveman, that maybe dug a little hole for himself

13:12.380 --> 13:14.920
 to shield himself from the elements.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.240
 Maybe there was a rainstorm or a snowstorm

13:17.240 --> 13:20.600
 and he dug a little enclave and he protected himself.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.920
 I thought you were gonna go, because you said primordial,

13:22.920 --> 13:24.560
 I thought you were gonna go back to like

13:24.560 --> 13:26.160
 earlier biological systems.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.240
 I guess primordial for human, perhaps.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.600
 For humans, yeah.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.440
 Okay.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.100
 And then the first communist or socialist

13:34.100 --> 13:37.360
 would be someone that decided the fruits of his labor

13:37.360 --> 13:38.800
 belonged to him.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.280
 So he would have violently encroached on that individual

13:41.280 --> 13:44.140
 and taken his plot for himself, for his own use.

13:45.180 --> 13:50.180
 And that's the spectrum across which capitalism,

13:50.180 --> 13:53.560
 in the pure sense, and communism in the pure sense operate

13:53.560 --> 13:57.640
 in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights

13:57.640 --> 13:59.180
 to the fruits of their labor.

13:59.180 --> 14:02.160
 So anything they spend their time, effort, energy

14:02.160 --> 14:04.960
 creating in the world, they own the rights to that

14:04.960 --> 14:07.080
 and they can trade those rights with others,

14:07.080 --> 14:10.360
 other self owned people that have done similar things.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.740
 Communism or socialism would imply that other people,

14:13.740 --> 14:16.040
 typically the state, have the rights,

14:16.040 --> 14:19.580
 at least some rights to the value you've created.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.520
 So there's this interesting moment when that first caveman,

14:22.520 --> 14:27.400
 that first capitalist drew a line, a circle in this cave

14:27.400 --> 14:29.920
 and said, you know, this is mine.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.240
 You could say it was free to be claimed

14:32.240 --> 14:33.640
 at the time he claimed it.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.600
 But it's an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.600
 When space time, as you were referring to it,

14:43.600 --> 14:46.860
 becomes something that's now can be possessed

14:46.860 --> 14:47.960
 by a human being.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.100
 Is there something special about this moment?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.820
 Because it feels like, first of all,

14:53.820 --> 14:57.660
 in terms of space and time, it feels like there's a lot

14:57.660 --> 15:02.660
 of available space time yet to be claimed.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.380
 So if we just look at like the universe, right?

15:05.380 --> 15:06.960
 We're talking about, there's a funny thing

15:06.960 --> 15:11.220
 with Elon Musk and Mars, I think they sneaked in there

15:11.220 --> 15:15.540
 for SpaceX, that nobody on earth has any authority

15:15.540 --> 15:18.980
 on Mars or any, this is a very interesting question.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.980
 It seems almost like humorous at this time,

15:20.980 --> 15:25.200
 but perhaps not, perhaps there'll be sections of space,

15:25.200 --> 15:29.020
 not just on planets that are gonna be even fought over.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.020
 So is there something special about this moment?

15:31.020 --> 15:35.140
 Because in discussing sort of violence

15:35.140 --> 15:37.440
 and respect for property, it feels like this is

15:37.440 --> 15:42.440
 a special moment because ultimately conflict arises

15:42.440 --> 15:46.640
 when you make claims on a particular territory.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.200
 It's not always in conflict where people say,

15:50.200 --> 15:52.800
 when you look at Hitler or something, for example,

15:52.800 --> 15:57.040
 his claim would be in many of the lands that he attacked

15:57.040 --> 15:59.720
 and invaded that this is ultimately,

15:59.720 --> 16:01.780
 this has always belonged to Germany.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.200
 So is there something you could say as to like

16:06.200 --> 16:09.440
 what it means to own an asset or a property?

16:09.440 --> 16:14.000
 Yeah, so in the ancient days of hunters and gatherers,

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
 we could say that property was mostly a loyal title,

16:19.240 --> 16:22.360
 which meant it's just whatever you can defend, right?

16:22.360 --> 16:25.600
 So if you've got knives and daggers and satchels

16:25.600 --> 16:28.760
 and maybe some pelts you've hunted,

16:28.760 --> 16:32.160
 whatever you can hold and defend is yours.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.320
 And there's not like, there's a government to appeal to,

16:35.320 --> 16:39.120
 you're just sort of a free agent operating in the wild,

16:39.120 --> 16:42.740
 defending the assets you can protect on you more or less.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.360
 And what really changed the nature of property

16:48.360 --> 16:50.780
 is when we get into the agricultural age.

16:50.780 --> 16:55.240
 So there's a big flip where we went from just foraging

16:55.240 --> 16:57.320
 and hunting all the time, constantly moving,

16:57.320 --> 17:00.440
 trying to stay alive to deciding we're gonna settle here.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.200
 We figured out how to cultivate crops.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.080
 We can create, we can increase the population

17:06.080 --> 17:08.480
 because we can harvest more energy from the sun

17:08.480 --> 17:11.280
 and we can establish a longer term civilization.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.600
 What happens in that transition

17:13.600 --> 17:16.480
 is that we begin creating economic surplus.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.680
 So for the first time in history,

17:17.680 --> 17:22.040
 we have stock houses of grain to defend

17:22.040 --> 17:25.260
 or maybe meat or cattle or whatever it is we're creating,

17:25.260 --> 17:27.060
 we now have savings.

17:27.960 --> 17:32.960
 And it's at that time when government emerges as well,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.120
 because once you have savings

17:35.120 --> 17:36.320
 or you have an economic surplus,

17:36.320 --> 17:39.000
 you have something that other people want to steal, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.760
 This one thing we'll touch on a lot today

17:41.760 --> 17:44.300
 is people always want something for nothing.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.440
 People are always seeking the path

17:47.440 --> 17:48.360
 to get something for nothing.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.600
 And I think that drives a lot of our decision making.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.680
 And it actually encourages us to be innovative

17:53.680 --> 17:54.520
 in a lot of ways, right?

17:54.520 --> 17:58.060
 We're trying to, you could say it's our laziness

17:58.060 --> 17:59.760
 that's helping us be inventive in a way.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.420
 We're trying to accomplish greater results

18:01.420 --> 18:02.940
 with less efforts over time,

18:02.940 --> 18:07.440
 but we can cross that line in seeking something for nothing

18:07.440 --> 18:09.240
 where we start to violate the life, liberty,

18:09.240 --> 18:10.320
 and property of others.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.160
 And that's where we shift from kind of capitalistic society

18:13.160 --> 18:15.560
 to something more communistic.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.840
 And so that's what government is.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.680
 It's a protection producing enterprise

18:21.680 --> 18:25.860
 for the economic surplus generated by a trading society.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.460
 So when people begin to trade,

18:28.460 --> 18:30.920
 they create what's called the division of labor,

18:30.920 --> 18:33.020
 which is a very common economic term,

18:33.020 --> 18:35.440
 basically means you're better at making hats,

18:35.440 --> 18:37.440
 I'm better at making boots.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.840
 If you specialize in hats, I specialize in boots,

18:39.840 --> 18:42.600
 and we trade, we've created a positive sum game

18:42.600 --> 18:43.840
 where you and I both benefit.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.000
 So we become collectively more than the sum of our parts

18:47.000 --> 18:48.320
 through trade.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.360
 And that's why human beings do trade

18:51.360 --> 18:54.040
 because we become more energy efficient as a result.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.560
 We create more outputs per unit of input.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.280
 And you can think of government in that respect,

18:59.280 --> 19:01.240
 if we're looking at it maybe in a tech sense

19:01.240 --> 19:05.220
 that the economy is the trade network that generates wealth,

19:05.220 --> 19:07.160
 generates innovation, generates all,

19:07.160 --> 19:09.120
 this whole lap of luxury we live in today

19:09.120 --> 19:12.680
 that we've inherited from our forebears is from the market.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.120
 It's not from a government.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.500
 The government is the network security, if you will.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.880
 So we're paying expenses to a vendor to protect peace,

19:21.880 --> 19:24.480
 to preserve life, liberty, and property in that network

19:24.480 --> 19:25.760
 so that we can have, you know,

19:25.760 --> 19:28.100
 when there's inevitably disputes over private property,

19:28.100 --> 19:30.720
 we can have nonviolent dispute resolution

19:30.720 --> 19:31.980
 in the rule of law.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.040
 And we can have a reasonable expectation

19:36.040 --> 19:39.440
 of being able to conduct commerce without violence.

19:39.440 --> 19:43.680
 The problem has been that the protector tends to,

19:43.680 --> 19:46.080
 you know, they're in a monopolistic position, we would say.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.260
 They tend to start abusing that position

19:49.260 --> 19:53.040
 to obtain property for themselves.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.840
 Again, trying to get that something for nothing.

19:55.840 --> 20:00.320
 When you control, you know, you are the security guard

20:00.320 --> 20:02.200
 for the economy.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.680
 The first thing they tend to monopolize is money

20:04.680 --> 20:05.840
 because if you can control the money,

20:05.840 --> 20:08.060
 you're effectively controlling people, their energy,

20:08.060 --> 20:09.240
 their perceptions.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.360
 And that becomes a, you know,

20:12.360 --> 20:14.560
 particularly through inflation,

20:14.560 --> 20:17.520
 becomes an avenue to get something for nothing

20:17.520 --> 20:20.000
 and that you can just print more money

20:20.000 --> 20:22.840
 that everyone else is forced to sacrifice their time

20:22.840 --> 20:24.100
 and energy to obtain.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.580
 What are your thoughts about anarchism?

20:27.580 --> 20:30.940
 So I talk quite a bit, he'll be here in a few days,

20:30.940 --> 20:35.420
 actually, Michael Malice, about ideas of anarchy.

20:35.420 --> 20:38.100
 And his idea or the idea of anarchists

20:38.100 --> 20:42.100
 is that any amount of government will eventually become

20:42.100 --> 20:45.660
 the very kind of thing that you're referring to.

20:45.660 --> 20:48.460
 So there's almost no way to have a government

20:48.460 --> 20:52.180
 that doesn't then try to monopolize power,

20:52.180 --> 20:54.360
 money, and all those kinds of things.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.900
 Do you think it's possible to have a government

20:56.900 --> 20:59.760
 sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy,

20:59.760 --> 21:02.020
 maybe libertarianism,

21:02.020 --> 21:04.620
 I'm not sure how exactly the spectrum goes,

21:04.620 --> 21:07.160
 but where you have a small government

21:07.160 --> 21:09.060
 that protects the liberty and property rights

21:09.060 --> 21:11.940
 and those kinds of things and doesn't expand

21:11.940 --> 21:15.420
 to then also control the monetary system

21:15.420 --> 21:17.620
 and all those other things?

21:17.620 --> 21:18.500
 Is it possible?

21:18.500 --> 21:23.100
 Agreed completely, it was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.620
 So for the first time in history,

21:25.620 --> 21:29.180
 we have a money that cannot be monopolized,

21:29.180 --> 21:32.020
 cannot be corrupted, cannot be changed,

21:32.920 --> 21:34.460
 cannot be weaponized, frankly.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.680
 Our current monetary system is weaponized

21:36.680 --> 21:39.420
 by those who can print money against those who cannot.

21:41.660 --> 21:45.060
 And I think when you have,

21:45.060 --> 21:46.880
 at the heart of every modern economy,

21:46.880 --> 21:48.620
 which even we could say the US,

21:48.620 --> 21:51.460
 we pride ourselves as free market capitalists.

21:51.460 --> 21:54.320
 You know, we out competed communism in the 20th century.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.460
 We think that this is the superior model.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.540
 Most business people will tell you

22:00.540 --> 22:03.780
 that the free market is the best allocator of resources,

22:03.780 --> 22:05.300
 all of these things.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.500
 But what we have at the heart of every modern economy,

22:07.500 --> 22:10.740
 including the US, is an anti capitalistic institution,

22:10.740 --> 22:12.040
 which is the central bank.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.460
 The temptation to monopolize money

22:15.460 --> 22:17.100
 throughout all of history has been too strong

22:17.100 --> 22:18.680
 for anyone to resist.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.540
 So any, even benevolent, quote unquote,

22:21.540 --> 22:23.400
 dictators that have taken over,

22:23.400 --> 22:25.300
 many dictators have inherited, say,

22:25.300 --> 22:28.260
 an inflationary regime where society is coming apart

22:28.260 --> 22:29.580
 because someone was clipping the coins

22:29.580 --> 22:31.260
 or someone was printing too much money,

22:31.260 --> 22:34.140
 and they'll commit to going back to a hard money standard.

22:34.140 --> 22:37.840
 So they'll keep society on a gold standard, for instance,

22:37.840 --> 22:40.860
 such that they cannot violate the money

22:40.860 --> 22:42.140
 to benefit themselves.

22:42.140 --> 22:45.820
 But inevitably, over time, because it is

22:45.820 --> 22:50.660
 a political institution, there's an incentive there, right?

22:50.660 --> 22:53.140
 For, again, to get something for nothing,

22:53.140 --> 22:57.260
 to spend more than you're making through tax revenues.

22:57.260 --> 22:59.700
 And with that incentive, people typically,

22:59.700 --> 23:03.400
 ultimately end up pursuing that inflationary path.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.680
 So we can get deeper into that about,

23:06.680 --> 23:09.400
 inflation is a term that we've been conditioned

23:09.400 --> 23:10.940
 to think today is just something normal.

23:10.940 --> 23:14.780
 The prices just go up, and then it's pertinent

23:14.780 --> 23:18.820
 to a healthy economy, but it's actually,

23:18.820 --> 23:20.300
 if you look at it from real first principles,

23:20.300 --> 23:22.540
 it is just theft integrated into the money.

23:22.540 --> 23:23.980
 It's a technology backdoor,

23:23.980 --> 23:25.420
 is another way to think about it.

23:25.420 --> 23:27.500
 You wouldn't buy a cell phone knowing

23:27.500 --> 23:30.420
 that someone could siphon your data off your private calls

23:30.420 --> 23:31.980
 and sell it into the market.

23:31.980 --> 23:33.700
 Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff

23:33.700 --> 23:35.180
 today, and that's something else we can get into,

23:35.180 --> 23:37.580
 but you wouldn't do it willingly, right?

23:37.580 --> 23:40.280
 You prefer that your cell phone and your data

23:40.280 --> 23:43.140
 was monetized by you, or if you're gonna sell it,

23:43.140 --> 23:45.420
 you would be able to selectively sell it.

23:45.420 --> 23:49.100
 Inflation is that it's similar, it's a tech backdoor.

23:49.100 --> 23:53.500
 So it's a money that only a few people

23:53.500 --> 23:58.340
 can siphon value off of surreptitiously, typically slowly,

23:58.340 --> 24:00.080
 but eventually, as we've seen throughout history,

24:00.080 --> 24:02.580
 that slowly builds up into a rapidly

24:02.580 --> 24:05.820
 and then causes the monetary system to collapse.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.400
 Do you think there's a benefit to inflation, possibly?

24:08.400 --> 24:12.420
 So when you have perfect information,

24:12.420 --> 24:14.260
 perhaps you don't need inflation,

24:14.260 --> 24:17.220
 perhaps it is purely theft, but I think of inflation

24:17.220 --> 24:19.540
 as like the snooze button on the alarm.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.460
 So if you have a hard standard,

24:23.460 --> 24:25.820
 you better wake up when the alarm rings,

24:25.820 --> 24:29.340
 but all of us kind of like probably shouldn't,

24:29.340 --> 24:30.700
 but use the snooze button.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.220
 It's like, okay, well, five more minutes

24:32.220 --> 24:34.860
 or 10 more minutes, and then you're saying

24:34.860 --> 24:36.980
 there's naturally a slippery slope

24:36.980 --> 24:40.140
 where it becomes a drug that you fall in love with

24:40.140 --> 24:43.980
 and you abuse, but nevertheless,

24:43.980 --> 24:46.260
 the usefulness of the snooze button

24:46.260 --> 24:48.860
 is that you don't know how you'll be actually feeling

24:48.860 --> 24:50.300
 when the alarm rings.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.220
 You might be able to ready to pop up.

24:52.220 --> 24:55.420
 It might be like you really need those few more minutes

24:55.420 --> 24:57.540
 to psychologically get yourself out of bed.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.820
 This metaphor is just not working at all,

24:59.820 --> 25:04.820
 but do you think there's a use to inflation sometimes

25:04.820 --> 25:06.900
 from like an economics perspective?

25:06.900 --> 25:09.620
 I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt

25:09.620 --> 25:12.260
 in that inflation does provide

25:12.260 --> 25:17.260
 an immediately stimulative effect when used early on.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.980
 But what it's doing is it's, again,

25:22.980 --> 25:26.140
 we talk about the balance between incentives

25:26.140 --> 25:27.340
 and disincentives, right?

25:27.340 --> 25:31.580
 That being necessary for a system to function properly.

25:31.580 --> 25:35.620
 With inflation, you're essentially giving the people

25:35.620 --> 25:38.420
 that can print money a way to dampen

25:38.420 --> 25:40.780
 the disincentives they face.

25:40.780 --> 25:45.780
 So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say.

25:46.580 --> 25:49.340
 And another way to look at this is when you,

25:49.340 --> 25:52.260
 so using inflation, using quantitative easing,

25:52.260 --> 25:56.880
 you can decrease short term volatility in the marketplace.

25:56.880 --> 26:01.140
 So the market is basically this idea,

26:01.140 --> 26:03.300
 this form of free exchange that's trying to zero in

26:03.300 --> 26:04.500
 on the best ideas.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.020
 And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality,

26:07.020 --> 26:08.780
 to satisfying the most wants.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.380
 It's gonna overshoot, it's gonna undershoot,

26:10.380 --> 26:12.020
 you have these little business cycles.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.500
 But when it's undershooting

26:13.500 --> 26:16.860
 and you're experiencing a business recession,

26:18.020 --> 26:19.140
 in a capitalist environment,

26:19.140 --> 26:21.940
 the market needs to clear that malinvestment,

26:21.940 --> 26:23.260
 that misallocation of capital.

26:23.260 --> 26:25.420
 That means someone made a bet on a certain idea

26:25.420 --> 26:27.820
 that it would satisfy wants in a particular way,

26:27.820 --> 26:29.460
 and that bet did not pan out.

26:29.460 --> 26:31.460
 If you then paper over the losses

26:31.460 --> 26:33.020
 that business is creating,

26:33.020 --> 26:36.820
 you're now delaying and exacerbating the volatility

26:36.820 --> 26:39.140
 that that idea created.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.400
 So this is kind of a Tel Aviv concept

26:41.400 --> 26:46.060
 where you can dampen short run volatility,

26:46.060 --> 26:48.340
 but volatility is truth.

26:48.340 --> 26:53.340
 Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality, right?

26:53.420 --> 26:55.200
 We're constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.640
 So you delay volatility,

26:57.640 --> 26:59.820
 you're just amplifying it and exacerbating it

26:59.820 --> 27:01.180
 in the long run.

27:01.180 --> 27:02.740
 And that's what central bank is doing.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.860
 The central bank mandate is low unemployment

27:06.860 --> 27:11.280
 and low and expected inflation, basically.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.820
 And so they're trying to achieve economic growth

27:16.820 --> 27:19.500
 in a stable way, quote unquote, stable way.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.200
 This is their ostensible purpose.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.940
 And that's just not possible.

27:23.940 --> 27:27.780
 Growth is an inherently instable process.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.420
 Can you elaborate a little bit

27:29.420 --> 27:33.380
 about the nature of volatility?

27:33.380 --> 27:35.820
 Why is it communicating truth?

27:37.140 --> 27:39.060
 That's something that a lot of people are afraid of

27:39.060 --> 27:40.340
 is the volatility.

27:40.340 --> 27:44.260
 Almost like it's a sign of chaos,

27:44.260 --> 27:48.220
 and so they want to escape chaos.

27:48.220 --> 27:51.740
 But you're saying that that's actually,

27:51.740 --> 27:53.640
 whether it's chaos or not, I don't know,

27:53.640 --> 27:57.600
 but it's getting us closer to the fundamental reality

27:57.600 --> 28:00.100
 that we should not be trying to escape.

28:00.100 --> 28:04.980
 Yeah, so if we consider that the universe

28:04.980 --> 28:06.980
 is pervaded by entropy, right?

28:06.980 --> 28:08.780
 This is the second law of thermodynamics

28:08.780 --> 28:10.080
 is that every closed system

28:10.080 --> 28:12.620
 tends towards greater disorder over time.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.420
 And that life itself, again,

28:15.420 --> 28:17.740
 I would argue expressed through the logos,

28:19.080 --> 28:22.180
 we, life, is the antientropic principle.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.740
 It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order,

28:24.740 --> 28:26.500
 chaos into order.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.980
 And that's what entrepreneurs are doing, right?

28:29.980 --> 28:32.700
 We're living at the edges of the known,

28:32.700 --> 28:37.240
 and we're testing ourself against the entropy of nature,

28:37.240 --> 28:38.900
 trying to figure out new and better ways

28:38.900 --> 28:41.020
 of saying, doing, or making things.

28:41.020 --> 28:44.260
 And then if we do crack a code or figure something out,

28:44.260 --> 28:45.700
 we then have a big incentive.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.180
 The incentive is to get rich, right?

28:47.180 --> 28:48.380
 Because then you have a new idea

28:48.380 --> 28:50.940
 that you could then sell back into the marketplace.

28:50.940 --> 28:55.940
 So it's this sequence of courageously confronting

28:57.360 --> 28:59.500
 the entropy of nature and converting it

28:59.500 --> 29:00.820
 into good and useful order,

29:00.820 --> 29:04.100
 which by the way is like the ancient idea of God in Genesis,

29:04.100 --> 29:05.600
 which I think is interesting,

29:06.900 --> 29:10.120
 that actually enables us to construct civilization

29:10.120 --> 29:14.900
 in these layers of anti entropy or order, you might say.

29:14.900 --> 29:19.900
 So today we live in a bubble of anti entropy or order,

29:19.900 --> 29:22.300
 like the coastlines are guarded by the nation

29:22.300 --> 29:25.340
 and the city has a certain police force

29:25.340 --> 29:26.740
 that keeps it in order.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.260
 Even the way we talk,

29:30.260 --> 29:31.780
 like clearly the words matter,

29:31.780 --> 29:33.060
 but also the nonverbal cues,

29:33.060 --> 29:35.340
 all these things are like order that has been established

29:35.340 --> 29:39.780
 over many, many, many thousands of years of human evolution.

29:40.660 --> 29:45.660
 And I think that's, when I say volatility is truth,

29:46.180 --> 29:49.340
 what I'm saying is that the experience of uncertainty

29:49.340 --> 29:53.580
 is something that's ineradicable from life, right?

29:53.580 --> 29:57.060
 And certainty, like it's kind of a paradox

29:57.060 --> 29:58.980
 because we're fighting against it, right?

29:58.980 --> 30:01.460
 We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty

30:01.460 --> 30:03.640
 to create more capital,

30:03.640 --> 30:08.640
 which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty.

30:09.540 --> 30:12.340
 So this is why you might have like a stash of food

30:12.340 --> 30:14.620
 in case the power goes out or a generator,

30:14.620 --> 30:17.780
 like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time.

30:17.780 --> 30:21.420
 But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.660
 So there's gotta be this balance

30:22.660 --> 30:24.220
 with one foot in, one foot out.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.500
 So human society is this kind of bubble of order

30:27.500 --> 30:30.460
 that we've constructed and slowly expanding,

30:30.460 --> 30:33.180
 but at the edges, you're always going to have that chaos,

30:33.180 --> 30:36.180
 that volatility, and that the entrepreneurs

30:36.180 --> 30:39.460
 are kind of like jumping into that chaos

30:39.460 --> 30:42.000
 and some of them die and some of them succeed.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.380
 And so like, if you wanna grow this bubble of order,

30:46.380 --> 30:51.380
 you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges.

30:51.380 --> 30:52.220
 Yes.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.100
 And reverence for entrepreneurship

30:55.100 --> 30:58.940
 because these are the people putting their neck out,

30:58.940 --> 31:01.260
 so to speak, risking themselves.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.220
 And they're gonna contribute to society, by the way,

31:03.220 --> 31:05.100
 whether they go up in flames or not.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.340
 If they go up in flames,

31:06.340 --> 31:08.560
 society has witnessed their experience

31:08.560 --> 31:10.660
 as something not to do or something that doesn't work

31:10.660 --> 31:12.380
 in a particular time and place.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.780
 So that you could say them going up in flames

31:14.780 --> 31:16.780
 is a way of enlightening the rest of us.

31:16.780 --> 31:18.980
 Or if they figure something out,

31:18.980 --> 31:22.780
 Steve Jobs creates the iPhone, changes the world forever.

31:22.780 --> 31:25.780
 So enlightening the rest of us, okay.

31:25.780 --> 31:26.900
 And Taleb would say.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.580
 The fire of their failure, okay.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.020
 Yeah, exactly.

31:30.020 --> 31:35.020
 Taleb would say individual fragility

31:35.020 --> 31:38.580
 is inseparable from ensemble anti fragility.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.620
 So this means that, again,

31:40.620 --> 31:42.760
 every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames

31:42.760 --> 31:46.020
 or say a restaurant goes out of business,

31:46.020 --> 31:47.380
 when a restaurant goes out of business,

31:47.380 --> 31:50.220
 that particular cuisine strategy they were implementing

31:50.220 --> 31:51.580
 in that particular time and place,

31:51.580 --> 31:53.500
 that's a signal to all the other restaurants in the area

31:53.500 --> 31:54.900
 that that doesn't work.

31:54.900 --> 31:59.660
 So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.

31:59.660 --> 32:02.420
 So it's this death of the individual components

32:02.420 --> 32:05.460
 that contributes to the growth of the ensemble.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.860
 As a small aside, maybe you can guide me through it.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.300
 I don't know if you're paying attention,

32:09.300 --> 32:13.780
 but there was some chaos around Taleb

32:13.780 --> 32:15.580
 and the Bitcoin community.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.960
 I wasn't quite paying attention,

32:17.960 --> 32:20.220
 but from my outsider's perspective,

32:20.220 --> 32:24.500
 I thought it seemed Taleb was a supporter of Bitcoin.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.900
 And then a lot of people were very upset about something.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.260
 I'm sorry if I don't know the details,

32:28.260 --> 32:33.020
 but can you pull out some profound philosophical ideas

32:33.020 --> 32:34.860
 from the disagreement of the chaos?

32:34.860 --> 32:37.940
 I admittedly don't know too much about it either.

32:37.940 --> 32:40.160
 I'm a big fan of his writing.

32:41.300 --> 32:45.780
 He's always been a little different in person.

32:45.780 --> 32:47.500
 Like I actually, he signed one of my books.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.340
 I met him in person.

32:48.340 --> 32:50.660
 He's just, he's got a very abrasive personality.

32:50.660 --> 32:51.580
 He's kind of known for it.

32:51.580 --> 32:54.140
 It's not, I don't think I'm passing any judgment here.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.540
 He sort of embraces it.

32:55.540 --> 32:56.380
 Yeah.

32:56.380 --> 32:58.980
 But he had written the forward

32:58.980 --> 33:00.680
 to a really important book in Bitcoin

33:00.680 --> 33:03.800
 called the Bitcoin Standard for safety in a moose.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.900
 And then I think they had a little Twitter beef

33:06.900 --> 33:10.880
 because safety is very much against COVID mask

33:10.880 --> 33:12.700
 and state intervention,

33:12.700 --> 33:15.340
 whereas Taleb's on the other side of the fence.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.900
 And so, and then after that beef,

33:17.900 --> 33:19.580
 Taleb came out against Bitcoiners saying,

33:19.580 --> 33:21.840
 oh, Bitcoiners are crazy and wrong.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.700
 I think the great mask debate of the 2020

33:24.700 --> 33:25.820
 will probably be the thing

33:25.820 --> 33:28.380
 that ultimately leads to World War III.

33:28.380 --> 33:33.380
 I've been very surprised how tense, how much like division

33:33.380 --> 33:38.380
 this one little arguably silly thing has led to.

33:39.140 --> 33:41.580
 I think a lot of people sort of project their,

33:41.580 --> 33:44.020
 like, it's almost like not wearing a mask

33:44.020 --> 33:46.500
 is a statement of sovereignty, of freedom,

33:46.500 --> 33:48.860
 of like saying fuck you to the man,

33:48.860 --> 33:50.900
 the government, the centralized power,

33:50.900 --> 33:55.180
 or the dishonesty or the, in the scientific community,

33:55.180 --> 33:56.260
 all those kinds of things.

33:56.260 --> 33:59.520
 And then wearing a mask is a sort of kind of signaling

33:59.520 --> 34:03.600
 of various kind of social aspects.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.440
 I don't know.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.500
 I'm not paying attention to it.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.820
 I actually tuned out.

34:06.820 --> 34:08.480
 I was part of a group of scientists

34:08.480 --> 34:10.580
 that were looking into like, do masks work?

34:10.580 --> 34:11.980
 This very interesting question.

34:11.980 --> 34:13.880
 To me, it was an interesting question.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.580
 I sort of roll in to ask that very interesting question

34:17.580 --> 34:20.500
 because I think it is an interesting scientific question.

34:20.500 --> 34:23.820
 But then I quickly realized that just as I was doing this,

34:23.820 --> 34:27.560
 like scientific exploration of this very interesting question

34:27.560 --> 34:30.300
 about Viron particles, like what kind of things,

34:30.300 --> 34:32.300
 like from a scientific perspective,

34:32.300 --> 34:34.400
 how do we prevent the spread of a pandemic?

34:34.400 --> 34:38.020
 Forget COVID, any pandemic, super deadly or not deadly.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.660
 Like there's tools, there's testing, there's masks,

34:40.660 --> 34:43.220
 there's all these tools, how well do they work?

34:43.220 --> 34:46.740
 And then I realized, you know, in April or so,

34:46.740 --> 34:49.980
 it became a tool of politics, a tool of philosophy.

34:49.980 --> 34:51.900
 And that's when I sort of pulled out.

34:51.900 --> 34:52.740
 So it's fascinating.

34:52.740 --> 34:56.740
 I think it's a canvas on which people project

34:56.740 --> 34:59.900
 their emotions and I guess Tillam got caught up

34:59.900 --> 35:02.480
 in that kind of, so there's nothing fundamental,

35:02.480 --> 35:04.540
 I suppose, to their disagreement.

35:04.540 --> 35:07.880
 Not that I'm aware of, but he is, you know,

35:07.880 --> 35:11.340
 he's written some about in his books,

35:11.340 --> 35:13.220
 the problem with centralization.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.860
 I mean, a lot of his writing addresses that

35:15.860 --> 35:18.620
 and he actually points to, I think Switzerland

35:18.620 --> 35:20.300
 is the best government in the world

35:20.300 --> 35:21.700
 because it's decentralized.

35:21.700 --> 35:26.700
 So there's that, I don't think he has any,

35:26.900 --> 35:30.700
 I'm not to speak for him, but I don't think he's voiced

35:30.700 --> 35:34.640
 any specific critiques on Bitcoin per se.

35:34.640 --> 35:35.740
 Could be wrong about that.

35:35.740 --> 35:37.820
 It's just maybe his flavorful language

35:37.820 --> 35:39.580
 and the way he likes to communicate.

35:39.580 --> 35:42.300
 And the other theory is that maybe he's playing 4D chess

35:42.300 --> 35:44.580
 and having a Twitter boating accident, you know.

35:44.580 --> 35:48.140
 So I don't believe in Bitcoin, I've sold all my Bitcoin.

35:48.140 --> 35:48.980
 Oh, I see.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.820
 Yeah.

35:49.820 --> 35:53.780
 Sorry, the boating accident in Bitcoin is this,

35:55.020 --> 35:56.740
 I guess it's proverbial by this point,

35:56.740 --> 35:59.360
 where it's the way you lose your Bitcoin.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.880
 So if someone comes after you and says,

36:00.880 --> 36:02.880
 hey, you know, whether it's a government

36:02.880 --> 36:04.200
 or an individual's coming after you saying,

36:04.200 --> 36:06.780
 give me all your Bitcoin or pay these taxes in Bitcoin,

36:06.780 --> 36:09.060
 you go, oh, I had a boating accident and lost them all.

36:09.060 --> 36:09.900
 Lost them all.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.740
 So, yeah.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.500
 But back to the fundamental nature of space time.

36:16.500 --> 36:20.180
 Let me ask you, because we're kind of left at,

36:20.180 --> 36:22.720
 I'd like to go back to this idea of,

36:24.160 --> 36:26.520
 that you said that everything we think, say,

36:26.520 --> 36:29.100
 or do occurs within the bounds of space time.

36:31.180 --> 36:33.580
 So first of all, maybe you can comment on

36:33.580 --> 36:37.140
 what do you mean in this context about space time,

36:37.140 --> 36:40.660
 but also about the nature of truth.

36:40.660 --> 36:43.480
 Like how much of all of this is knowable?

36:43.480 --> 36:46.400
 How much of this is accessible to us humans?

36:46.400 --> 36:49.180
 How much uncertainty, like what we're talking about,

36:49.180 --> 36:50.720
 is there in the world?

36:50.720 --> 36:52.300
 Are you, do you fall in a place

36:52.300 --> 36:56.060
 where we can reason deeply about this world

36:56.060 --> 36:58.540
 and it's knowable, or is it mostly chaos

36:58.540 --> 37:01.380
 and we're just holding on for dear life?

37:01.380 --> 37:04.220
 Yeah, I think I said that all action occurs

37:04.220 --> 37:05.560
 within the bounds of space time.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.200
 The other thing, everything we say, do, or make,

37:08.200 --> 37:10.380
 the other thing is that everything we say, do, or make

37:10.380 --> 37:12.460
 starts out as an idea.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.520
 So there's this concept of universal Darwinism,

37:15.520 --> 37:20.060
 which basically applies Darwinian principles,

37:20.060 --> 37:21.980
 but outside of the biological sphere.

37:21.980 --> 37:23.820
 So we could say that this kind of gets into

37:23.820 --> 37:27.220
 Richard Dawkins memetics, that even ideas are competing,

37:27.220 --> 37:29.180
 reproducing, recombining.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.860
 That idea is so powerful, by the way.

37:30.860 --> 37:33.900
 I don't think it's been understood fully.

37:33.900 --> 37:38.900
 I think in the digital, in the 21st century,

37:38.940 --> 37:40.580
 in the digital world, from my perspective

37:40.580 --> 37:42.540
 in artificial intelligence,

37:42.540 --> 37:44.500
 there's yet to be some profound things

37:44.500 --> 37:47.220
 to be discovered about this whole construct.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.860
 Agreed completely.

37:48.860 --> 37:51.540
 It's been called an acid, actually,

37:51.540 --> 37:55.580
 in that it strips away all of the noninformational

37:55.580 --> 37:57.140
 components of something, just strips it down

37:57.140 --> 37:59.140
 to its bare bones.

37:59.140 --> 38:02.140
 I have a quote in here somewhere about that, but.

38:02.140 --> 38:03.500
 I'm sorry, which is called an acid?

38:03.500 --> 38:04.340
 The ideas?

38:04.340 --> 38:05.860
 The universal Darwinism.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.100
 Darwinism applied broadly, outside of the.

38:08.100 --> 38:12.740
 Applied broadly, and I'll condition all of this

38:12.740 --> 38:14.540
 by saying that a lot, most of my thinking

38:14.540 --> 38:16.300
 is shaped by a book I read recently

38:16.300 --> 38:17.900
 called The Case Against Reality,

38:19.340 --> 38:20.660
 which introduced me to this concept,

38:20.660 --> 38:23.380
 but it tied into Darwinism that I've used

38:23.380 --> 38:24.760
 more broadly in the past, looking at things

38:24.760 --> 38:26.340
 like money and economics.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.640
 So the book, The Case Against Reality,

38:28.640 --> 38:32.860
 by Donald Hoffman, he has a quote in the book

38:32.860 --> 38:35.740
 that describes universal Darwinism.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.640
 It says, quote, universal Darwinism can,

38:37.640 --> 38:39.340
 without risk of refuting itself,

38:39.340 --> 38:41.500
 address our key question.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.820
 Does natural selection favor true perceptions?

38:44.820 --> 38:46.780
 If the answer happens to be no,

38:46.780 --> 38:49.160
 then it hasn't shot itself in the foot.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.300
 The uncanny power of universal Darwinism

38:51.300 --> 38:54.120
 has been likened by the philosopher Dan Dennett

38:54.120 --> 38:55.700
 to a universal acid.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.940
 And Dan Dennett says, quote, there is no denying

38:58.940 --> 39:02.380
 at this point that Darwin's idea is a universal solvent,

39:02.380 --> 39:04.020
 capable of cutting right to the heart

39:04.020 --> 39:05.720
 of everything in sight.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.500
 The question is, what does it leave behind?

39:08.500 --> 39:10.860
 I have tried to show that once it passes through everything,

39:10.860 --> 39:13.100
 we are left with stronger, sounder versions

39:13.100 --> 39:15.740
 of our most important ideas.

39:15.740 --> 39:17.880
 Some of the traditional details perish,

39:17.880 --> 39:20.380
 and some of these are losses to be regretted,

39:20.380 --> 39:22.220
 but good riddance to the rest of them.

39:22.220 --> 39:25.140
 What remains is more than enough to build on, unquote.

39:26.340 --> 39:31.340
 So the way I would interpret that is that life itself,

39:31.660 --> 39:34.620
 I've come to view life as information propagating

39:34.620 --> 39:38.620
 through flesh, and that we are,

39:38.620 --> 39:42.820
 I guess DNA is a quadratic code.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.220
 I think it's four letters, maybe,

39:44.220 --> 39:46.540
 versus a binary, zeros and ones.

39:46.540 --> 39:49.620
 And we are ideas, we are strategies competing

39:49.620 --> 39:54.300
 with each other, and nature is that which selects.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.500
 It's what selects the winning ideas,

39:56.500 --> 39:57.740
 the ones that are most fit

39:59.100 --> 40:02.400
 to environmental conditions, frankly.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.280
 You know, talking about sovereignty and individualism,

40:06.280 --> 40:10.680
 there might need to be some rethinking here

40:10.680 --> 40:13.940
 about what is actually the basic individual entity

40:13.940 --> 40:15.600
 that is to be sovereign.

40:15.600 --> 40:20.600
 Like maybe our biological meat vehicles

40:20.760 --> 40:23.400
 were like way overly attached to them.

40:25.220 --> 40:28.040
 Like maybe, especially with genetics

40:28.040 --> 40:29.000
 and all those kinds of things,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.120
 or artificial intelligence, or living more and more

40:31.120 --> 40:34.200
 in virtual worlds will become detached

40:34.200 --> 40:35.860
 from that kind of idea.

40:35.860 --> 40:38.280
 So for example, if I can clone you,

40:38.280 --> 40:42.280
 you know, make one million robbers,

40:42.280 --> 40:46.160
 and, you know, but you'll all have the same idea,

40:46.160 --> 40:48.880
 what is your real value as the,

40:48.880 --> 40:50.000
 like I could just shoot you,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.840
 and there'll still be 999 of you,

40:52.840 --> 40:55.200
 but the idea is the important thing,

40:55.200 --> 40:57.120
 the things you believe, so.

40:58.260 --> 41:00.200
 I would argue that I don't know,

41:00.200 --> 41:02.080
 even if you clone someone perfectly,

41:02.080 --> 41:05.500
 I don't think you can reproduce the individual themselves,

41:05.500 --> 41:09.000
 because we're all a product of nature and nurture, right?

41:09.000 --> 41:12.380
 So my particular concourse of experiences,

41:12.380 --> 41:15.800
 the path dependence that I represent cannot be replicated,

41:15.800 --> 41:17.560
 nor can anyone's for that matter.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.520
 Well, that's a hypothesis, so.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.360
 True.

41:21.360 --> 41:25.720
 That's of course a human meat bag would say.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.080
 Good point.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.920
 Like desperate trying to preserve himself.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.960
 You know, I think it reduces

41:33.960 --> 41:36.440
 to some fundamental questions about what is consciousness,

41:36.440 --> 41:38.000
 and whether that can be cloned.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.200
 All those kind of, you know,

41:39.200 --> 41:41.880
 it gets to the core of what it is to be human.

41:41.880 --> 41:45.160
 What are the things that make you particularly you?

41:45.160 --> 41:46.880
 Yeah, I think it would assume

41:46.880 --> 41:49.200
 kind of a materialist viewpoint on reality,

41:49.200 --> 41:52.160
 and that if you could reproduce every atom of an individual

41:52.160 --> 41:55.160
 that you would have their experience encapsulated in that.

41:55.160 --> 41:58.620
 And, you know, Hoffman's, which his book is very radical,

41:58.620 --> 42:03.620
 he argues that space and time is not an objective reality,

42:03.620 --> 42:06.040
 it's a biological interface.

42:06.040 --> 42:11.040
 So we are scanning our environment for fitness payoffs,

42:11.080 --> 42:13.520
 and this space and time is the rendering

42:13.520 --> 42:15.040
 specific to human beings

42:15.040 --> 42:18.960
 that allows us to navigate reality effectively.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.840
 So the further argument would be

42:20.840 --> 42:23.240
 that we all have pretty similar interfaces,

42:23.240 --> 42:25.000
 but they're all slightly different too,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.120
 because we're all, you know, adapting in different ways,

42:27.120 --> 42:30.280
 and that different animals have their own unique interfaces.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.780
 So we have a certain amount of photoreceptors in our eye,

42:32.780 --> 42:35.920
 whereas I think the number is three, might be five,

42:35.920 --> 42:39.320
 or something like the mantis shrimp has like seven or nine.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.960
 So they can see,

42:40.960 --> 42:45.960
 and we only see one 10 trillionth of the light spectrum.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.640
 So talk about a tiny fraction.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.640
 I mean, one 10 trillionth is a very minuscule number,

42:51.640 --> 42:53.340
 and that makes up all of the light

42:53.340 --> 42:55.320
 that we can interpret with our eyes.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.480
 But something like a mantis shrimp

42:56.480 --> 42:58.760
 could see, you know, much more of that.

42:58.760 --> 43:03.760
 So I think there's this, we're very conditioned

43:04.160 --> 43:07.280
 to have a fully materialist viewpoint on reality today,

43:07.280 --> 43:10.280
 where we think, you know,

43:10.280 --> 43:12.940
 the atomic clockwork kind of universe.

43:12.940 --> 43:16.460
 But I think there's, I don't think that's true exactly.

43:16.460 --> 43:19.740
 And another school that goes into that

43:19.740 --> 43:22.000
 is actually Austrian economics,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.640
 where we could say that, you know,

43:24.640 --> 43:27.580
 we mentioned earlier that an asset is not property.

43:27.580 --> 43:29.120
 It's actually based on the relationship

43:29.120 --> 43:31.120
 between the individual and the property.

43:32.720 --> 43:36.920
 There's this whole realm of relevance associated with,

43:39.860 --> 43:41.600
 we're all moving through life

43:41.600 --> 43:43.540
 in the course of a goal directed action.

43:43.540 --> 43:47.400
 So when we walk across a room, I go from A to B,

43:47.400 --> 43:50.160
 it's because I valued B more than A.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.920
 So value is inseparable from human action.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.160
 We have a rank ordered value system in our mind,

43:56.160 --> 43:58.360
 each of us, and we're constantly taking action

43:58.360 --> 44:00.440
 in accordance with those rank values.

44:01.500 --> 44:04.560
 Anything that accelerates us on the course

44:04.560 --> 44:08.480
 of our goal directed action towards our goal is useful.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.720
 Anything that impedes us, or we could say is valuable,

44:12.720 --> 44:16.200
 anything that impedes us is actually obstructing to value.

44:16.200 --> 44:19.160
 And anything that's irrelevant is just valueless.

44:19.160 --> 44:23.880
 So this table that we're using right now,

44:23.880 --> 44:26.360
 like this is an accessory to UNI

44:26.360 --> 44:27.480
 because it's holding this paper

44:27.480 --> 44:28.480
 that's holding the information

44:28.480 --> 44:30.320
 that's guiding our conversation.

44:30.320 --> 44:34.320
 But we could pay someone $100 to jump over this table.

44:34.320 --> 44:37.080
 And this table could simultaneously be an accessory to UNI

44:37.080 --> 44:39.500
 and an obstacle to someone else.

44:39.500 --> 44:43.880
 So it's this domain, this silent contention of willpower

44:43.880 --> 44:46.740
 and agendas occurring across the face of the earth

44:46.740 --> 44:50.040
 that is what Austrian economics really looks at.

44:50.040 --> 44:54.040
 It's the realm of human action, as they call it.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.560
 It's called praxeology.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.560
 So it's a non materialist viewpoint on reality

44:58.560 --> 45:03.200
 and that things, we think in terms of matter being reality,

45:03.200 --> 45:06.160
 but it's often more so in the sphere of human action,

45:06.160 --> 45:08.620
 what matters, that is reality.

45:08.620 --> 45:10.240
 It's the relevance of a thing

45:10.240 --> 45:12.400
 to the course of one's goal directed action.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.960
 And that's ultimately exists in the space of ideas.

45:15.960 --> 45:16.940
 Yes.

45:16.940 --> 45:19.040
 Not in the space of physical matter.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.400
 And just to jump back to this line here,

45:20.400 --> 45:24.620
 I think his fundamental line here is the question is,

45:24.620 --> 45:26.880
 talking about universal Darwinism as an asset,

45:26.880 --> 45:28.360
 what does it leave behind?

45:28.360 --> 45:30.760
 I've tried to show that once it passes through everything,

45:30.760 --> 45:32.920
 we're left with stronger, sounder versions

45:32.920 --> 45:35.320
 of our most useful ideas.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.520
 That's the key point to me.

45:36.520 --> 45:40.400
 And that ideas and information, so far as we can tell,

45:40.400 --> 45:43.260
 are the most fundamental substrate of reality.

45:44.360 --> 45:47.560
 And information itself, back to entropy,

45:47.560 --> 45:50.320
 information is the resolution of entropy.

45:50.320 --> 45:51.560
 That's what the bit is, right?

45:51.560 --> 45:52.440
 It's a one or a zero.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.040
 Whatever reduces your entropy by half is a bit.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.480
 And we measure information in bits.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.640
 So.

45:58.640 --> 45:59.760
 And you're right.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.980
 People don't have ideas, ideas have people.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.800
 Honestly, it's a really profound idea

46:07.080 --> 46:11.620
 or a statement about reality, a reframing of reality.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.320
 If we're actually being deeply honest about it,

46:15.320 --> 46:17.240
 it's quite painful.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.280
 I do appreciate that you defended

46:19.280 --> 46:21.760
 your biological meatbag earlier,

46:21.760 --> 46:26.020
 but it seems like ideas are the things that have power.

46:26.020 --> 46:31.040
 That me, Lex, for example, is worthless.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.820
 And relative to the ideas that used my brain

46:35.820 --> 46:37.600
 for a bit of a time.

46:37.600 --> 46:40.800
 But so far as we know, only human beings

46:40.800 --> 46:42.400
 can generate and share ideas.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.440
 So you can't say Lex is worthless.

46:44.440 --> 46:47.960
 Like you are the node of the idea sphere.

46:47.960 --> 46:49.080
 I'm the newest fear.

46:49.080 --> 46:49.920
 So.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.040
 What is it?

46:52.040 --> 46:55.160
 From a Bitcoin perspective, I'm like, I'm mining.

46:55.160 --> 46:59.000
 I'm solving the cryptographic problem and generate.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.200
 In that sense, I'm a useful node.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.560
 Yeah, you're competing to solve the puzzle of entropy,

47:06.560 --> 47:07.400
 right?

47:07.400 --> 47:09.620
 And when you do solve it, it benefits the entire network.

47:09.620 --> 47:13.320
 But I guess from my perspective,

47:13.320 --> 47:15.400
 just because just working in AI,

47:15.400 --> 47:17.600
 I'm looking at the longterm vision.

47:17.600 --> 47:22.500
 I see us humans and AI systems as really the same

47:22.500 --> 47:25.000
 and AI systems ultimately as something

47:25.000 --> 47:27.120
 that supersedes humans.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.620
 So what is intelligence?

47:33.360 --> 47:36.780
 So in the context of our current discussion,

47:36.780 --> 47:41.080
 I think intelligence is very closely linked

47:41.080 --> 47:45.340
 to this notion of ideas.

47:45.340 --> 47:48.560
 And it's the ability to generate ideas,

47:48.560 --> 47:53.560
 to mold ideas, to compress seeming chaos

47:54.600 --> 47:58.680
 into some model, into some theory

47:58.680 --> 48:01.440
 that efficiently compresses the chaos

48:01.440 --> 48:04.880
 in a way where you can then integrate it with other ideas

48:04.880 --> 48:07.080
 and they can play and all those kinds of things.

48:07.080 --> 48:11.840
 So in that sense, it's the turning chaos into order.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.720
 It's the molding of ideas such that our human brains

48:15.720 --> 48:17.840
 can work with it.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.600
 And just from my perspective,

48:19.600 --> 48:22.880
 I don't see any reason why that can not be algorithmatized,

48:22.880 --> 48:25.580
 converted into computational systems.

48:25.580 --> 48:27.220
 I would agree.

48:27.220 --> 48:28.220
 Which is scary.

48:29.240 --> 48:33.400
 Scary or potentially really promising, right?

48:33.400 --> 48:34.820
 It's kind of the case of all novelty.

48:34.820 --> 48:37.160
 It's terrifying as much as it is promising.

48:37.160 --> 48:39.440
 That's why you're pursuing it so heavily.

48:39.440 --> 48:42.520
 I would maybe take it a step further

48:42.520 --> 48:44.720
 and say that intelligence

48:44.720 --> 48:47.360
 in maybe its most simplistic form is error correction.

48:48.260 --> 48:53.260
 So we, humans have wants.

48:53.300 --> 48:56.240
 Again, we're constantly expressing our value through action.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.000
 There's no other way to express it by the way.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.380
 It's whatever you choose to do in any moment,

49:00.380 --> 49:02.280
 you are expressing the values you hold

49:02.280 --> 49:03.680
 in your mind and your heart.

49:03.680 --> 49:08.680
 So as we move from less valued A to more valued B,

49:12.120 --> 49:16.160
 entropy happens, uncertainty happens, we fall off course.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.320
 And it is intelligence that enables us

49:19.320 --> 49:21.680
 to render information from that experience

49:21.680 --> 49:23.720
 and error correct, right?

49:23.720 --> 49:25.920
 So that we can move slightly,

49:25.920 --> 49:29.120
 shift our trajectory slightly more towards B

49:29.120 --> 49:30.860
 that we're trying to move towards.

49:30.860 --> 49:35.600
 So I think that there's something there

49:35.600 --> 49:40.600
 that I don't know that we can make synthetically.

49:41.840 --> 49:45.800
 And that if we define intelligence as error correction,

49:45.800 --> 49:47.120
 it's like error correction to what?

49:47.120 --> 49:50.600
 It's error correction towards what we find is valuable.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.560
 So we're trying to satisfy human wants.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.240
 Might not just be our own, could be others as well.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.080
 If I'm an entrepreneur,

49:55.080 --> 49:57.560
 I'm trying to solve the wants of others, not just myself.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.400
 And I'm trying to error correct myself towards that goal,

50:01.400 --> 50:04.680
 using intelligence and processing environmental feedback

50:04.680 --> 50:06.560
 through intelligence to error correct.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.040
 So I don't know how,

50:08.040 --> 50:12.440
 if you eliminate the human element completely,

50:12.440 --> 50:13.940
 who's doing the wanting, right?

50:13.940 --> 50:15.320
 Where does value come from?

50:15.320 --> 50:18.240
 I know the machine learning people who are listening

50:18.240 --> 50:20.280
 are saying that's exactly what machine learning is,

50:20.280 --> 50:21.480
 which is error correction

50:21.480 --> 50:24.060
 because you have a loss function, objective function

50:24.060 --> 50:28.320
 that measures how wrong your thing is

50:28.320 --> 50:30.240
 and you wanna make it less wrong next time.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.000
 That's the whole process of machine learning.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.560
 But you're saying what humans are able to do

50:35.560 --> 50:40.560
 is in a world where there's no maybe objective values,

50:42.280 --> 50:46.480
 absolute values, you're generating that very loss function,

50:46.480 --> 50:51.480
 that objective function that measures the error

50:51.480 --> 50:55.120
 comes from the human mind.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.240
 Some aliens might disagree with you

50:57.240 --> 51:00.040
 because they might have a different objective function.

51:00.040 --> 51:02.800
 Obviously, the purpose comes from consciousness, I think.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.560
 And without purpose, there's not error correction.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.000
 Yeah, I mean, this is again, a hypothesis.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.560
 Like where does purpose come from?

51:09.560 --> 51:12.000
 It seems to come from consciousness, you're right.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.160
 That's where suffering comes from

51:15.160 --> 51:17.060
 and you want to lessen suffering.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.120
 That's where pleasure comes from.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.920
 It seems like it's consciousness.

51:21.920 --> 51:25.160
 Maybe there's something to this biological meat bag.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.320
 So to take it one layer deeper on this

51:27.320 --> 51:29.120
 and the reason I like this book so much,

51:29.120 --> 51:30.720
 again, The Case Against Reality.

51:31.660 --> 51:33.600
 So he's making the case that space and time

51:33.600 --> 51:35.200
 are not fundamental.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.040
 Yes.

51:36.040 --> 51:39.260
 Which I started my intellectual explorations in physics,

51:39.260 --> 51:40.180
 actually astrophysics.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.660
 So for the longest time, even the way I describe money

51:42.660 --> 51:46.560
 as I talk about space and time, so that blew my mind.

51:46.560 --> 51:49.960
 But this dovetailed nicely with another book called Lila.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.400
 The author is Robert Persig.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.560
 So he wrote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,

51:55.560 --> 51:57.280
 which is a very popular book.

51:57.280 --> 52:00.120
 20 years later, he wrote Lila, which no one's heard of,

52:00.120 --> 52:01.400
 which is crazy.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.920
 And he basically says he was wrong about his first book.

52:03.920 --> 52:08.400
 And he lays out this entire other metaphysics of quality,

52:08.400 --> 52:09.240
 he calls it.

52:09.240 --> 52:12.480
 So it's the metaphysics, I think it's metaphysics of quality.

52:12.480 --> 52:17.480
 But his supposition is that it's not physical reality

52:18.080 --> 52:19.040
 that's fundamental.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.240
 It's not informational information that's fundamental,

52:22.240 --> 52:23.220
 it's value.

52:24.240 --> 52:26.960
 So he actually, and it's a beautiful book,

52:26.960 --> 52:28.340
 I highly recommend it.

52:29.200 --> 52:33.180
 He essentially is refuting causality itself.

52:33.180 --> 52:34.960
 We think A causes B.

52:34.960 --> 52:41.960
 This book makes the case that B values precondition A,

52:42.580 --> 52:45.980
 so that we are actually creating our future

52:45.980 --> 52:48.420
 through our value systems.

52:48.420 --> 52:50.900
 And this goes back to something,

52:50.900 --> 52:52.260
 I think Solzhenitsyn said this,

52:52.260 --> 52:54.300
 that the line between good and evil

52:54.300 --> 52:56.220
 runs down the heart of every man.

52:56.220 --> 52:58.940
 So it's as if our moral decisions

52:58.940 --> 53:01.500
 are actually what's creating the outcomes

53:01.500 --> 53:03.260
 in reality over time.

53:03.260 --> 53:05.500
 And then that gets into all the wisdom traditions

53:05.500 --> 53:06.620
 related to religion,

53:06.620 --> 53:10.180
 where it's always talking about loving thy neighbor

53:10.180 --> 53:12.380
 and loving God and all of these other things

53:12.380 --> 53:15.260
 that are good morally to create the best outcomes.

53:15.260 --> 53:17.840
 So values are fundamental.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.260
 Value, yes.

53:19.260 --> 53:21.340
 Value is fundamental.

53:22.300 --> 53:24.100
 Oh boy, yeah, that's interesting.

53:26.940 --> 53:30.140
 It does feel like physics is not capturing something.

53:30.140 --> 53:35.140
 You know, there's some people, panpsychists argue

53:35.500 --> 53:38.300
 that consciousness might be one of the fundamental

53:38.300 --> 53:39.620
 properties of nature,

53:39.620 --> 53:42.820
 like from which emerges everything we see.

53:42.820 --> 53:46.420
 So that could be just other words

53:46.420 --> 53:49.420
 for this same notion of value.

53:49.420 --> 53:51.700
 And then the basic laws of physics

53:51.700 --> 53:54.020
 are not capturing that currently.

53:54.020 --> 53:56.500
 So maybe humans, in order to understand

53:56.500 --> 53:57.820
 from where humans came from,

53:57.820 --> 54:00.580
 we have to understand these other properties of nature,

54:00.580 --> 54:03.500
 which are yet to be discovered at the physics level.

54:03.500 --> 54:08.140
 And it's, we contend with that underlying nature,

54:08.140 --> 54:10.760
 whatever it is, with the logos, right?

54:10.760 --> 54:15.760
 So we're looking at uncategorized nature

54:16.220 --> 54:18.540
 and then we're assigning a word to it.

54:18.540 --> 54:23.260
 So we're slicing up chaos into little boxes of order.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.740
 And then we're establishing this social consensus

54:25.740 --> 54:28.860
 as to those labels, which we'd call words.

54:28.860 --> 54:30.780
 And we're using that to communicate.

54:30.780 --> 54:32.180
 And when we communicate,

54:33.820 --> 54:35.260
 we can start to build these other things.

54:35.260 --> 54:37.980
 This is like the Yuval Harari imagined orders.

54:37.980 --> 54:41.060
 So we can create these useful fictions, right?

54:41.060 --> 54:44.060
 Whether it's the nation state or human rights or money.

54:44.060 --> 54:48.580
 And that allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers

54:48.580 --> 54:50.500
 so that we can better contend with reality.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.720
 We can produce more complicated things.

54:53.720 --> 54:58.380
 We can enlarge that bubble of civilization against entropy.

54:58.380 --> 55:01.100
 And that's what capitalism is all about.

55:01.100 --> 55:04.520
 It's about further specializing knowledge,

55:04.520 --> 55:07.500
 further enriching mankind's treasury of knowledge

55:08.700 --> 55:09.580
 and doing it.

55:09.580 --> 55:14.240
 But to do that, the communication media that we're using,

55:14.240 --> 55:16.780
 the words have to have stable meaning.

55:16.780 --> 55:21.540
 The money needs to have value that's dependable, right?

55:21.540 --> 55:25.600
 It needs to be something that's, it's not dictated

55:25.600 --> 55:26.920
 by any one group.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.620
 It's reached by consensus of the entire group.

55:30.620 --> 55:35.580
 That's how, so you could think it's like optimizing

55:35.580 --> 55:36.760
 for error correction again,

55:36.760 --> 55:39.980
 where a free market would be harnessing the intelligence

55:39.980 --> 55:43.860
 of all market actors and a central planning

55:43.860 --> 55:46.020
 or essentially planned market would be harnessing

55:46.020 --> 55:49.860
 just the intelligence of a small group of bureaucrats.

55:49.860 --> 55:51.620
 And it's not obvious how to achieve this kind

55:51.620 --> 55:53.460
 of consensus mechanism.

55:53.460 --> 55:56.780
 I mean, there's obviously, we'll talk about sort of Bitcoin

55:56.780 --> 55:57.880
 as an idea.

55:57.880 --> 56:01.900
 Ultimately, the idea of Bitcoin is connecting it to physics.

56:02.860 --> 56:07.740
 So like, you can trust that physical matter won't change.

56:09.060 --> 56:12.940
 But, you know, there could be other ideas that we get.

56:12.940 --> 56:14.660
 Maybe physics could be changed.

56:14.660 --> 56:17.420
 If Eric Weinstein has anything to say about it.

56:17.420 --> 56:19.980
 Like it's, you know, we right now believe

56:19.980 --> 56:21.580
 that physics can't be changed.

56:21.580 --> 56:24.460
 The physical matter of the world, but maybe it can

56:24.460 --> 56:26.480
 in a way that we're totally not understanding.

56:26.480 --> 56:28.460
 You mentioned sort of reality

56:28.460 --> 56:32.460
 from Donald Hoffman's perspective.

56:32.460 --> 56:35.440
 Like if we don't have even close to direct access

56:35.440 --> 56:39.600
 to the fabric of reality, maybe we're living in a world

56:39.600 --> 56:42.420
 that's very like many dimensions,

56:42.420 --> 56:45.180
 that the notions of space and time is just like a silly,

56:45.180 --> 56:48.480
 useful construct that's not at all connected.

56:48.480 --> 56:51.020
 You're starting to look at like Stephen Wolframs.

56:51.020 --> 56:53.500
 I don't know if you're familiar with this view

56:53.500 --> 56:57.140
 of the world that it's like hypergraphs underneath it all.

56:57.140 --> 56:58.660
 Like these mathematical structures

56:58.660 --> 57:00.460
 from which everything emerges.

57:00.460 --> 57:05.460
 Like they're like many, many, many orders of magnitude,

57:07.380 --> 57:10.140
 smaller than what we think of.

57:10.140 --> 57:13.240
 They're even smaller than like strings and string theory.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.300
 So like those are the basic mathematical objects

57:15.300 --> 57:16.540
 from which it emerges.

57:16.540 --> 57:17.620
 I don't, you know,

57:17.620 --> 57:20.540
 I think that's an interesting philosophical framework.

57:20.540 --> 57:25.340
 It's also, people should check out a cool way to play

57:25.340 --> 57:27.700
 with beautiful hypergraph mathematical structures.

57:27.700 --> 57:30.040
 So he has, I don't know if you know who Stephen Wolfram is,

57:30.040 --> 57:34.240
 but he created Wolfram Alpha and all these tools

57:34.240 --> 57:36.360
 that you can actually visualize and play with.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.280
 So you can play with physics in a visual way,

57:39.280 --> 57:43.540
 which, or at least discrete mathematics,

57:43.540 --> 57:45.060
 which I think is incredible.

57:45.060 --> 57:46.820
 He doesn't get enough love.

57:46.820 --> 57:50.420
 One of the reasons he, I think doesn't get enough love

57:50.420 --> 57:53.360
 is because of this little quirk of human nature,

57:53.360 --> 57:54.780
 which is the ego.

57:55.700 --> 57:59.860
 And he sometimes frustrates a few folks

57:59.860 --> 58:03.980
 because he's very, let's say proud of his work.

58:03.980 --> 58:04.820
 I guess.

58:04.820 --> 58:09.820
 But it's interesting to think about a world

58:10.380 --> 58:13.580
 where we don't have direct access to reality,

58:13.580 --> 58:14.980
 as Hoffman argues.

58:14.980 --> 58:17.300
 And maybe, I don't know if you can comment.

58:17.300 --> 58:19.380
 I don't know if you're familiar with Ayn Rand's work

58:19.380 --> 58:21.980
 and her whole philosophy of objectivism

58:21.980 --> 58:25.700
 or her whole contention is that, you know,

58:25.700 --> 58:27.040
 we do have access.

58:28.360 --> 58:29.420
 I don't want to misstate it,

58:29.420 --> 58:33.220
 but at least she would claim

58:33.220 --> 58:38.220
 that it's not useful,

58:39.180 --> 58:41.600
 or I think she would probably say it's not correct

58:41.600 --> 58:44.220
 to argue that we don't have access to reality.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.060
 We have, hence, objectivism.

58:46.060 --> 58:49.140
 We have direct access to reality.

58:49.140 --> 58:52.380
 That's the only thing we can reason about.

58:52.380 --> 58:55.120
 And the only way to live life morally

58:55.120 --> 58:57.740
 is to reason through everything,

58:57.740 --> 58:59.620
 starting with the axioms of reality,

58:59.620 --> 59:02.060
 which we do have direct access to.

59:02.060 --> 59:04.580
 Do you have thoughts about her work?

59:04.580 --> 59:08.900
 I am slightly ashamed to say I have not read Ayn Rand yet.

59:08.900 --> 59:10.500
 So she is high on my list

59:10.500 --> 59:13.300
 and she's been recommended a number of times.

59:14.700 --> 59:16.260
 So I don't know a lot specifically

59:16.260 --> 59:18.300
 about her philosophy or objectivism,

59:18.300 --> 59:21.620
 but to me, it resonates closely

59:21.620 --> 59:25.780
 with what the American pragmatist commented on truth.

59:25.780 --> 59:28.140
 And they distinguished what you could say

59:28.140 --> 59:31.300
 is absolute truth, which is at the bottom of reality,

59:31.300 --> 59:34.340
 whether it's Mr. Wolfram's mathematical formulas or value,

59:34.340 --> 59:37.020
 whatever it may be, it's something ineffable,

59:37.020 --> 59:41.420
 something beyond the reach of epistemology, perhaps even.

59:42.340 --> 59:45.580
 And maybe that's why religion just sort of points to it.

59:45.580 --> 59:50.060
 It's trying to use, I think Joseph Campbell said something

59:50.060 --> 59:55.060
 like religion is using stories

59:55.700 --> 59:58.460
 to point towards the same transcendental mystery

59:58.460 --> 1:00:01.220
 we all experience but cannot articulate.

1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:03.180
 So something like the artist,

1:00:03.180 --> 1:00:06.820
 the artist uses lies to point to the truth,

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:08.980
 something like that, that kind of thing.

1:00:10.140 --> 1:00:10.980
 That's really good.

1:00:10.980 --> 1:00:13.700
 But the American pragmatist said that,

1:00:13.700 --> 1:00:16.300
 because at the end of the day, this is all about,

1:00:16.300 --> 1:00:18.580
 when we say truth, we need something

1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:23.420
 that is close to social consensus

1:00:23.420 --> 1:00:25.980
 and is not shakable by political action.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.380
 So that's what physics and mathematics are.

1:00:28.380 --> 1:00:33.380
 It's an unshakable point of reference,

1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:35.140
 I guess you might say.

1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:39.420
 So the American pragmatist defined truth

1:00:39.420 --> 1:00:41.180
 as the end of inquiry.

1:00:42.460 --> 1:00:47.460
 And in markets, we could say that the market itself

1:00:48.420 --> 1:00:50.620
 is a forum that generates truth.

1:00:50.620 --> 1:00:51.940
 We call this pragmatic truth

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:53.940
 to separate pure objective truth

1:00:53.940 --> 1:00:56.580
 that we can't even talk about without polluting it

1:00:56.580 --> 1:00:57.700
 versus pragmatic truth,

1:00:57.700 --> 1:00:59.340
 which is something that's useful.

1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:01.940
 So the example here would be,

1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:05.580
 if I give you a map and you're trying to go

1:01:05.580 --> 1:01:09.060
 from your house to the local brisket restaurant,

1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:10.780
 and the map gets you from your house

1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:12.420
 to the brisket restaurant,

1:01:12.420 --> 1:01:13.940
 is that because the map is true

1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:15.700
 or is that because the map is useful?

1:01:16.740 --> 1:01:18.620
 They're very hard to disentangle

1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:21.420
 when you're just looking at it pragmatically.

1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:23.900
 And in markets, markets, I argue,

1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:26.460
 generate three forms of pragmatic truth.

1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:28.420
 One is the price.

1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:33.420
 So this is the collective subjective demand

1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:35.860
 and purchasing power of humanity

1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:39.860
 running up against the objective supply of capital

1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:41.820
 and resources in the marketplace.

1:01:41.820 --> 1:01:44.380
 So there's demand overlaid on supply.

1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:46.060
 The result of that is the price.

1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:51.060
 So that is the most truthful exchange ratio,

1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:54.180
 which is the closest approximation to the value

1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:56.100
 of any good in the marketplace.

1:01:56.100 --> 1:01:58.660
 So it gives us a data point on which we can operate.

1:01:58.660 --> 1:02:01.420
 It's compressing all known market realities

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:03.860
 down into a single actionable number.

1:02:03.860 --> 1:02:05.980
 You know, based on the price of bread or copper,

1:02:05.980 --> 1:02:07.580
 whether you wanna buy more of it,

1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:09.060
 you wanna abstain from buying it,

1:02:09.060 --> 1:02:11.420
 or maybe you wanna try and find substitutes.

1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:13.940
 And you can think of that price signal,

1:02:13.940 --> 1:02:15.580
 it's like an economic nerve signal.

1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:17.620
 It's coordinating human action across time.

1:02:17.620 --> 1:02:22.620
 So if we're one socioeconomic superorganism or collective,

1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:24.620
 that the price signal is the nerve.

1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:27.060
 And that's the first form of pragmatic truth

1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:28.460
 that markets generate.

1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:32.300
 The second form would be tools and innovations themselves.

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:35.700
 So entrepreneurs are experimenting across time.

1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:37.700
 They're trying to satisfy the wants of consumers.

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.540
 Consumers are sovereign in the marketplace.

1:02:40.540 --> 1:02:43.940
 Whatever the consumer wants, the consumer gets, right?

1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:44.980
 I'm trying to satisfy that.

1:02:44.980 --> 1:02:46.460
 I'm trying to do it at a profit.

1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:49.740
 So I'm trying to take viewing the existing price signals

1:02:49.740 --> 1:02:50.700
 of goods in the marketplace.

1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:53.260
 I'm trying to assemble those in a way

1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:55.780
 at a cost lower than the final solution

1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:57.380
 I'm delivering to my customer.

1:02:57.380 --> 1:02:58.700
 I'm selling it at a price higher

1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:01.380
 than the productive factors I combined to create it.

1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:05.100
 And in that iterative process,

1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.980
 we're constantly discovering new and better ways

1:03:08.980 --> 1:03:11.420
 of solving problems or satisfying the wants.

1:03:11.420 --> 1:03:14.900
 So we could say, to go out and dig a hole, right?

1:03:14.900 --> 1:03:16.540
 Someone wants a hole dug,

1:03:16.540 --> 1:03:20.260
 that a shovel is gonna let you do it much faster per hour

1:03:20.260 --> 1:03:22.460
 than you would with your bare hands.

1:03:22.460 --> 1:03:24.900
 So what is the pragmatic truth of digging holes?

1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:27.380
 It's a shovel, right?

1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:30.020
 It's the best way we know how to solve

1:03:30.020 --> 1:03:33.020
 any particular problem based on

1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:35.340
 the existing treasury of knowledge.

1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:39.140
 So every tool, again, we're back to ideas being fundamental.

1:03:39.140 --> 1:03:42.980
 The shovel itself is just a knowledge structure.

1:03:42.980 --> 1:03:45.620
 We've figured out a way to create this particular implement

1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:47.780
 and then we've indexed the raw materials

1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:49.980
 we found in nature to this knowledge structure

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.220
 to create a shovel,

1:03:51.220 --> 1:03:54.220
 which allows us to better satisfy human wants

1:03:55.940 --> 1:03:57.260
 faster, cheaper, better, effectively.

1:03:57.260 --> 1:03:59.460
 I'm trying to generalize,

1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:01.220
 you're blowing my mind a little bit here.

1:04:01.220 --> 1:04:03.660
 I'm trying to generalize the idea of tool

1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:04.780
 to how to think about it.

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:07.780
 Cause I keep just, when you say tool,

1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:09.580
 I keep imagining different tools,

1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:12.220
 like specific instantiations of a tool.

1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:16.100
 I'm trying to see, so the price is a pragmatic truth

1:04:16.100 --> 1:04:21.100
 that's communicating value in this network.

1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:26.660
 Subjective demands against objective supply.

1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:27.500
 Subjective.

1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:29.260
 So it's an economic democracy.

1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:30.100
 Got it.

1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:32.260
 So that's the demand supply.

1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:35.460
 And then the tools are the ways of extracting

1:04:36.380 --> 1:04:39.500
 or solving problems is the more general kind of thing.

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:40.860
 Or satisfying wants.

1:04:40.860 --> 1:04:42.740
 Satisfying wants.

1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:46.980
 So wants are somehow, that's part of the supply

1:04:46.980 --> 1:04:48.060
 and the demand.

1:04:48.060 --> 1:04:49.900
 And wants are back to value, right?

1:04:49.900 --> 1:04:51.140
 Cause everything someone wants,

1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:53.180
 they're expressing their value.

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:54.020
 Okay.

1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:54.860
 Yeah.

1:04:54.860 --> 1:04:57.460
 So the shovel is a pragmatic truth.

1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:58.860
 The shovel is truth.

1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:00.540
 It feels like a good book title.

1:05:00.540 --> 1:05:01.380
 Okay, sorry.

1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:03.220
 So what other pragma, what is it?

1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:08.220
 And then the third one I would argue is virtue actually.

1:05:08.540 --> 1:05:09.740
 Oh wow.

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:13.340
 And another way to maybe think about this

1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:14.740
 is competitive competency,

1:05:14.740 --> 1:05:17.140
 but it's also cooperative competency.

1:05:17.140 --> 1:05:20.740
 So we're learning over time what characteristics,

1:05:20.740 --> 1:05:24.780
 what patterns of action, what mindsets,

1:05:24.780 --> 1:05:27.980
 what mental tools, what heuristics are most useful

1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.660
 to satisfying customer wants.

1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:32.780
 So I think that becomes over time,

1:05:32.780 --> 1:05:34.380
 becomes sharpened into virtue, right?

1:05:34.380 --> 1:05:36.500
 Like we know it's best to be honest

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:39.340
 because if you lie, it's very energy inefficient, right?

1:05:39.340 --> 1:05:41.700
 You're creating this little fork of reality.

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:43.460
 And then if someone else asks you about that lie again,

1:05:43.460 --> 1:05:46.140
 you have to put another layer of lies on top of it.

1:05:46.140 --> 1:05:47.220
 Where if you just tell the truth,

1:05:47.220 --> 1:05:49.300
 you're just recollecting what happened.

1:05:49.300 --> 1:05:50.860
 And so that sort of keeps,

1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:55.620
 again, when we're talking about delaying volatility, right?

1:05:55.620 --> 1:05:59.220
 If you lie, you're delaying short term volatility,

1:05:59.220 --> 1:06:00.860
 but you're increasing longterm volatility.

1:06:00.860 --> 1:06:01.700
 What about murder?

1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:04.140
 I haven't been able to figure out why murder is bad

1:06:04.140 --> 1:06:07.140
 because I just keep wanting to murder people.

1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.300
 And I've murdered many.

1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:09.660
 She's the one for that.

1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:11.820
 Well, that's why I'm trying to get an interview

1:06:11.820 --> 1:06:13.380
 with Vladimir Putin.

1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:16.980
 So that's fascinating, virtue in this market

1:06:16.980 --> 1:06:19.740
 with the supplies and demands, and there's the tools,

1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:23.300
 which is also a pragmatic truth, and there's virtue.

1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:24.980
 It's a pragmatic truth.

1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:28.220
 Yeah, and if we interfere with that free market process,

1:06:28.220 --> 1:06:31.340
 again, if we overstep, which this maybe ties into murder,

1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:34.580
 if you start to be coercive against life,

1:06:34.580 --> 1:06:35.980
 liberty or property,

1:06:35.980 --> 1:06:38.900
 so if you're forcibly taking someone's life,

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:41.380
 you're breaking down the trust in that market

1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:44.100
 that generates these pragmatic truths.

1:06:44.100 --> 1:06:47.500
 If you forcibly infringe on someone's liberty, right?

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:52.260
 For any reason other than them originally breaking

1:06:53.220 --> 1:06:55.060
 or infringing upon life, liberty or property,

1:06:55.060 --> 1:06:56.860
 then that's not gonna work either.

1:06:56.860 --> 1:06:59.340
 And then if you violate private property rights,

1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:01.140
 if you steal property from others,

1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:04.340
 you're breaking down the trust

1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:08.780
 that the intersubjective fabric of money and markets

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:11.140
 and the rule of law, all of these useful fictions

1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:12.140
 are meant to preserve,

1:07:12.140 --> 1:07:14.780
 you're corrupting it and breaking it down.

1:07:14.780 --> 1:07:16.500
 What's kind of interesting to think about the market

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:19.540
 as helping evolve the virtues.

1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:22.980
 It's sharpened into virtues.

1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:24.700
 And then these virtues can then go

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:26.300
 into motivational posters,

1:07:27.380 --> 1:07:30.340
 or like in books that we all agree on,

1:07:30.340 --> 1:07:32.740
 and then eventually take for granted

1:07:32.740 --> 1:07:35.340
 as if they were somehow fundamental to human nature,

1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:37.700
 but they're not perhaps fundamental,

1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.460
 they're just pragmatic truths.

1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:45.460
 Yeah, another way to consider competition itself

1:07:45.580 --> 1:07:48.380
 is that it is a discovery process.

1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:52.620
 So, you know, entrepreneurs are competing with one another

1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:56.460
 and they're trying to best satisfy consumer wants

1:07:56.460 --> 1:07:57.700
 at the lowest possible price.

1:07:57.700 --> 1:08:00.460
 So they're placing bets of time, energy and capital

1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:03.740
 on themselves, on their idea, their business plan.

1:08:03.740 --> 1:08:06.420
 And then the market decides, right?

1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:10.260
 The consensus of market actors decide which one was better.

1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:11.780
 One lives, one dies.

1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:16.900
 So competition itself is helping us get closer to truth,

1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:18.060
 to pragmatic truth.

1:08:18.060 --> 1:08:21.380
 So we're discovering what is the right price for this asset.

1:08:21.380 --> 1:08:24.180
 And that price, by the way, it's derived,

1:08:24.180 --> 1:08:26.500
 again, in the sense of data compression.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:28.940
 Everyone in the world can see that price.

1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:31.580
 Everyone in the world can then put their skin in the game

1:08:31.580 --> 1:08:34.300
 by choosing to buy or sell or short or go long

1:08:34.300 --> 1:08:37.380
 or do any number of financial actions on that price.

1:08:38.220 --> 1:08:40.420
 And that information is then propagated back out

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:41.260
 to everyone else.

1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:44.980
 So it's this feedback loop between market actor and price

1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:48.100
 that makes it so useful.

1:08:48.100 --> 1:08:52.500
 And that's what carries us,

1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:56.060
 so it's these collisions of interest that carry us,

1:08:56.060 --> 1:09:00.900
 it removes the unuseful aspects of ourselves

1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:02.940
 or of our tools or of a price

1:09:02.940 --> 1:09:05.420
 and reveals pragmatic truth to us.

1:09:05.420 --> 1:09:08.220
 Can you play my therapist for a second?

1:09:08.220 --> 1:09:11.300
 And if we talk about creative destruction,

1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:13.340
 I think, not Bukowski,

1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:17.460
 Hunter S. Thompson has a quote,

1:09:17.460 --> 1:09:20.940
 something like, for all instances of beauty,

1:09:20.940 --> 1:09:22.820
 many souls must be trampled.

1:09:22.820 --> 1:09:25.060
 Wow.

1:09:25.060 --> 1:09:30.060
 But there does seem to be an aspect of competition

1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:36.500
 that destroys, you were talking about entrepreneurs

1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:40.780
 sort of on the outside of the circle of order,

1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:45.140
 striving to make sense, to compress volatility

1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:47.860
 of the chaos of the universe.

1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:52.860
 Is there some way to protect a little bit

1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:55.380
 against the pain of that destruction

1:09:55.380 --> 1:09:57.100
 or that creative destruction,

1:09:57.100 --> 1:10:00.340
 that entrepreneur screaming on fire

1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:03.660
 as he enlightens the rest of us,

1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:06.740
 is there some role for us humans together

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:08.260
 in the togetherness of it?

1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:15.060
 Also government, but any kind of collectives

1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:18.300
 in helping that entrepreneur who's on fire

1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:22.860
 maybe after a few minutes to spray him with some water

1:10:22.860 --> 1:10:25.100
 and put him out of his misery?

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:31.460
 I would say that pain is the inarguable basis of being.

1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:39.380
 Pain is, no matter how you try to explain it away

1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:41.340
 or describe it,

1:10:41.340 --> 1:10:46.340
 or it's not something you can rationalize away.

1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:50.900
 No one, I think ever,

1:10:50.900 --> 1:10:53.180
 someone may want to cut themselves to have an endorphin high

1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:55.060
 but no one wants to suffer, we'd say, right?

1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:56.980
 So pain in that sense,

1:10:56.980 --> 1:10:59.580
 it is what we're constantly trying to deal with

1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:04.780
 and to move away from or create buffers between us

1:11:04.780 --> 1:11:07.620
 and potential pain or potential uncertainty.

1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:10.900
 And that pain is information.

1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:12.500
 When we experience something

1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:16.100
 that is misfit to the outcome we desired,

1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:17.820
 that pain is what puts us,

1:11:17.820 --> 1:11:20.820
 it encourages us to change our trajectory

1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:24.060
 to get back on course towards our valued aim.

1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:29.060
 So as far as, you need entrepreneurs that are exploring,

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:32.340
 and you're trying to do something new,

1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:33.860
 if you're a pioneer of any kind,

1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:36.140
 you are courageously facing pain.

1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:38.060
 You're willfully confronting it.

1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:40.900
 So I don't think it's avoidable in that sense.

1:11:40.900 --> 1:11:44.540
 It's not like we can have pain free economic growth

1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:48.020
 like the central bank would maybe have us lend to believe

1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:50.220
 that we can just run these experiments

1:11:50.220 --> 1:11:51.060
 and when they fail,

1:11:51.060 --> 1:11:52.900
 we'll just paper over all the losses and continue.

1:11:52.900 --> 1:11:56.140
 Or you're just delaying and exacerbating

1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:58.300
 the inevitable volatility back to reality.

1:11:59.660 --> 1:12:02.660
 But what I would say is that capitalism,

1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:03.820
 because we're building,

1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:05.620
 we're increasing the capital stock of the world,

1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:08.060
 which again, capital is the mitigation of risk.

1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:10.420
 So we're reducing the overall risk of existence

1:12:10.420 --> 1:12:12.580
 by accumulating more capital in the world.

1:12:12.580 --> 1:12:14.900
 And that's what protects that entrepreneur

1:12:14.900 --> 1:12:17.580
 that's deciding, hey, I saved up a million bucks.

1:12:17.580 --> 1:12:20.100
 I'm gonna go try this business idea.

1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:22.300
 I'm gonna put all my money on the line.

1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:24.420
 And if he goes up in flames,

1:12:24.420 --> 1:12:27.180
 then his cost of living when he comes back to reality

1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:28.380
 and he's starting over from zero,

1:12:28.380 --> 1:12:31.060
 his cost of living is substantially lower

1:12:31.060 --> 1:12:33.700
 starting over from zero than it was in the past.

1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:37.020
 So then he would be out in the wilderness on his own.

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:40.020
 So it's the accumulation of capital stock

1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:43.300
 is the buffer against uncertainty for everyone.

1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:47.060
 And it gives you actually more potential

1:12:47.060 --> 1:12:48.420
 to go out and experiment,

1:12:48.420 --> 1:12:51.180
 to go out and confront the chaos of nature

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:53.940
 because you are better healed effectively.

1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:56.500
 So I think we're speaking

1:12:58.980 --> 1:13:03.020
 in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitals

1:13:03.020 --> 1:13:04.740
 and when it works well.

1:13:04.740 --> 1:13:07.020
 Is there any aspects that you think

1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:10.500
 that don't work well in a free market

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:12.460
 in all the basic pragmatic truths

1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:13.580
 that we were talking about?

1:13:13.580 --> 1:13:15.540
 Is there ways it can go wrong?

1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:21.900
 So I would first argue that we have never seen

1:13:22.940 --> 1:13:25.500
 an actual purely free market.

1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:30.500
 Closest example would be kind of geopolitically

1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:35.740
 we have a free market

1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:38.540
 and that governments are not necessarily governed

1:13:41.580 --> 1:13:46.580
 but they are premised on governing large groups

1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:47.620
 of individuals.

1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:49.940
 So that's not, doesn't exactly.

1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:52.100
 You mean between governments?

1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:53.140
 Yes.

1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:54.620
 See, but isn't there still,

1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:57.780
 so a free market, maybe you can correct me,

1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:00.460
 is the free market still grounded in the ideas

1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:03.980
 of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?

1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:06.300
 So governments tend to also sometimes

1:14:06.300 --> 1:14:07.820
 be violent towards each other.

1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:08.660
 That's right.

1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:11.820
 So they don't respect all the basic aspects of capitalism.

1:14:11.820 --> 1:14:12.660
 That's right.

1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:15.020
 So maybe another way to look at this is that

1:14:15.020 --> 1:14:20.020
 gold is the original governor of government actually.

1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:24.140
 And this is the reason governments have abused

1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:26.980
 and gone off of the gold standard.

1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:31.980
 So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state

1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:37.820
 and you produce more currency

1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:40.060
 than your gold reserves can justify,

1:14:41.020 --> 1:14:43.860
 then gold will flow out of your bank

1:14:43.860 --> 1:14:45.020
 or out of your country.

1:14:45.020 --> 1:14:50.020
 So there's this natural check via the money

1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:53.300
 that via capitalistic money, which is gold, right?

1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:55.060
 Gold was selected by the free market.

1:14:55.060 --> 1:14:57.460
 It's not decreed by government.

1:14:57.460 --> 1:15:01.460
 It provided this natural check on government action.

1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:06.460
 So my, I guess to get back to the original question is

1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:10.580
 we've never seen a pure free market

1:15:10.580 --> 1:15:13.780
 because money has always been monopolized

1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:16.980
 and coerced, frankly.

1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:20.780
 So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market

1:15:20.780 --> 1:15:23.580
 is really difficult because we've never actually seen it.

1:15:23.580 --> 1:15:27.620
 And I would define free market is one

1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:31.580
 in which government only protects life, liberty and property.

1:15:31.580 --> 1:15:35.060
 And so that has a very minimal role in society.

1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:37.340
 Again, just as network security

1:15:37.340 --> 1:15:39.740
 for the economic trade network.

1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:44.660
 And anything that, any government function that goes beyond

1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:47.140
 those three core functions, which by the way,

1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:49.540
 are pretty much the core tenants of morality as well.

1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:52.340
 So government's just really intended to preserve,

1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:55.060
 you know, natural law, if you will.

1:15:55.060 --> 1:15:58.060
 Anything that goes beyond that is,

1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:00.580
 moves us closer to an unfree market.

1:16:00.580 --> 1:16:05.100
 So every regulation, every act of coercion

1:16:05.100 --> 1:16:10.100
 is actually a gradation closer to a purely unfree market,

1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:12.260
 which would be a monopoly.

1:16:12.260 --> 1:16:15.980
 So in terms of what I guess theoretically we could say

1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:20.220
 goes wrong in the free market is that it's volatile.

1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:25.220
 It's trading off, it's accepting short term volatility

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:29.820
 in exchange for less long run volatility.

1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:32.300
 And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way.

1:16:32.300 --> 1:16:37.300
 So if we look at something like there's a region

1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:40.300
 in North America called Baja, California,

1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:43.660
 and it runs into the United States

1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:45.420
 and it runs down into Mexico as well.

1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:49.380
 So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions.

1:16:50.340 --> 1:16:55.340
 In the US, we very heavily manage forest fires.

1:16:55.580 --> 1:16:57.900
 We're trying to manage nature effectively.

1:16:57.900 --> 1:16:59.980
 Whereas in Mexico is much more unregulated.

1:16:59.980 --> 1:17:04.260
 It just, when wildfires spring up, they let them burn off.

1:17:04.260 --> 1:17:06.220
 North America, when wildfires spring up,

1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:08.140
 we're actually extinguishing them.

1:17:08.140 --> 1:17:09.660
 So we're constantly trying to dampen

1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:12.260
 the short run volatility of these small brush fires.

1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:13.660
 Whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn.

1:17:13.660 --> 1:17:15.500
 We let nature do its thing.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.860
 The consequence of this is that the wildfires

1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:21.260
 still occur eventually, but they're much larger

1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:23.140
 and much more devastating in North America

1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:25.180
 where human intervention has occurred

1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:30.180
 because it's dampening nature's natural corrective mechanism

1:17:31.820 --> 1:17:34.620
 of clearing this underbrush with these more frequent

1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:38.020
 and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires.

1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:39.860
 So again, we're delaying short term volatility

1:17:39.860 --> 1:17:42.580
 and exacerbating long run volatility.

1:17:42.580 --> 1:17:44.340
 And in Mexico, it's the opposite, right?

1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:46.500
 Just these wildfires burn much smaller

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:49.340
 and more continuously over time.

1:17:49.340 --> 1:17:51.020
 The further effect of that in North America

1:17:51.020 --> 1:17:53.180
 is that the fires can get so big and so hot

1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:55.100
 that it burns away the top soil.

1:17:55.100 --> 1:17:58.460
 So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself.

1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:02.940
 So the point of this is that human intervention, right?

1:18:02.940 --> 1:18:06.540
 Even the intention behind North American authorities

1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:10.260
 managing that forest fire is to create less destruction.

1:18:10.260 --> 1:18:11.940
 That is the intention,

1:18:11.940 --> 1:18:15.300
 but the intention is divergent from the outcome.

1:18:15.300 --> 1:18:18.900
 So in Taliban speak, he would say that human intervention

1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:23.900
 moves us from mediocre stan into extremist stan.

1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:27.340
 So mediocre stan would be something much more like nature

1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:30.140
 where for instance, you can't double your body weight

1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:33.700
 in a day, probably can't even do it in a year, right?

1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:34.740
 But in extremist stan,

1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:37.140
 which is something much more information based,

1:18:37.140 --> 1:18:41.900
 you can double or send your net worth to zero

1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:44.740
 in a single trade in a single moment, right?

1:18:44.740 --> 1:18:46.700
 So when we try and intervene

1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:48.620
 with natural biological systems

1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:51.740
 that have these feedback loops,

1:18:51.740 --> 1:18:53.820
 we actually start to push the system more

1:18:53.820 --> 1:18:56.260
 to behave more like an extremist stan system

1:18:57.340 --> 1:18:59.900
 that has less short run volatility,

1:18:59.900 --> 1:19:03.260
 but more extreme long run volatility.

1:19:03.260 --> 1:19:04.820
 So, but the question is,

1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:09.340
 where you look at capitalism or communism, for example,

1:19:09.340 --> 1:19:10.580
 and by the way, yes,

1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:13.180
 I will talk to somebody who's a Marxist or a communist,

1:19:13.180 --> 1:19:15.700
 like Richard Wolff is a pretty eloquent defender

1:19:15.700 --> 1:19:18.300
 of these ideas because it's always good

1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:19.980
 to really understand ideas

1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:22.260
 as opposed to just reject them offhand.

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:26.300
 When you look at the system of capitalism

1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:27.900
 or the system of communism,

1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:32.140
 there's ideals and a lot of people argue

1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:35.780
 in this perfect form would actually be good for the world.

1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:38.620
 The question is how resilient are they

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:42.220
 to the corruption of human nature?

1:19:42.220 --> 1:19:45.220
 And I mean, you're saying that there's not a,

1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.380
 there's never been a free market.

1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:48.820
 It's a very true statement.

1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:52.940
 The question is how resilient is capitalism

1:19:52.940 --> 1:19:54.700
 or whatever implementations of capitalism

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:57.340
 we had up to this point to human nature

1:19:57.340 --> 1:19:59.340
 where one person will become successful

1:19:59.340 --> 1:20:03.060
 through legitimate means

1:20:03.060 --> 1:20:05.940
 and starts to try to manipulate the system

1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:07.580
 that takes it away from a free market

1:20:07.580 --> 1:20:10.940
 or takes it away from the things

1:20:10.940 --> 1:20:13.900
 that gave them the riches in the first place.

1:20:13.900 --> 1:20:17.220
 And then try to, through corruption, get more,

1:20:17.220 --> 1:20:20.780
 get this, the thing you said, the lazy human ways.

1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:22.980
 Now try to figure out how to get something for nothing.

1:20:22.980 --> 1:20:24.220
 That's right.

1:20:24.220 --> 1:20:26.820
 So how resilient do you think is capitalism to that?

1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:31.460
 Well, the best implementation we've had of it

1:20:31.460 --> 1:20:35.700
 really has been the United States, I think,

1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:36.620
 up until this point.

1:20:36.620 --> 1:20:41.620
 But it's still the central banking itself.

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:45.820
 This was in the 1848 Manifesto to the Communist Party.

1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:49.740
 Measure number five reads an exclusive state monopoly

1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:51.860
 and centralized control over cash and credit.

1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:56.620
 So the central bank is a Marxist or communist institution.

1:20:56.620 --> 1:20:58.740
 It is antithetical to the free market principles

1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:00.460
 on which the United States was founded.

1:21:00.460 --> 1:21:02.060
 And indeed, the United States resisted

1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:04.460
 the implementation of a central bank.

1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:06.500
 I think it was Andrew Jackson.

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.420
 I know there was the first national bank,

1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:10.820
 the second national bank were both disbanded.

1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:14.060
 And then Andrew Jackson, which is my favorite Tennessean,

1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:18.180
 he has some famous quotes about routing out the bankers

1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:19.700
 like a den of vipers.

1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:23.060
 I think he punched one of the central bankers in the face.

1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:26.980
 Back when our leaders were a bit more badass,

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:28.820
 I guess you might say.

1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:33.820
 And finally in 1913, the Federal Reserve was implemented.

1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:39.460
 And it's been kind of all downhill from there.

1:21:39.460 --> 1:21:41.940
 So what is, can you, oh, sorry, go ahead.

1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:45.620
 I was just gonna say that communism and capitalism,

1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:47.220
 it's also a matter of scale.

1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:51.500
 The ideal behind communism is from each

1:21:51.500 --> 1:21:54.100
 according to their ability to each according to their need.

1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:55.420
 Sounds beautiful, right?

1:21:55.420 --> 1:21:58.380
 Sounds like a great, peaceful, harmonious way

1:21:58.380 --> 1:22:00.020
 to organize ourselves.

1:22:00.020 --> 1:22:03.700
 The problem is, and by the way, I am a communist

1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:05.500
 in my family, in my home, right?

1:22:05.500 --> 1:22:07.140
 At that very smallest of scales.

1:22:07.140 --> 1:22:10.220
 Yes, in your very small circles of trust,

1:22:10.220 --> 1:22:13.940
 you're much more likely to behave selflessly

1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:14.780
 towards one another.

1:22:14.780 --> 1:22:17.260
 By the way, I look forward to the Bitcoin community

1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:20.900
 clipping out that part, saying that Robert Breedlove

1:22:20.900 --> 1:22:23.980
 was a communist and the ideals of communism are beautiful.

1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:25.580
 Yeah, context matters, people.

1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:28.260
 Sorry, go ahead.

1:22:29.420 --> 1:22:33.100
 But to your point, it does not scale, right?

1:22:33.100 --> 1:22:37.900
 As we move into this larger system

1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:41.580
 of socioeconomic cooperation, which is necessary

1:22:41.580 --> 1:22:44.940
 to deepen the division of labor, to generate more wealth.

1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:48.540
 We need to interact with one another on much larger scales

1:22:48.540 --> 1:22:52.220
 than this communistic utopian ideal.

1:22:52.220 --> 1:22:54.340
 We get into the realm of capitalism

1:22:54.340 --> 1:22:58.020
 where we need really sound rules, hard rules,

1:22:58.020 --> 1:23:03.020
 consensus, verifiability, and frankly, prices.

1:23:03.620 --> 1:23:06.340
 Because the other thing in Soviet Russia

1:23:06.340 --> 1:23:08.780
 is they tried to replace the profit motive

1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:13.140
 or the price signal with this devotion to,

1:23:13.140 --> 1:23:15.420
 this nationalistic faith and devotion.

1:23:15.420 --> 1:23:18.340
 Where it's like, you don't need self interest anymore.

1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:20.300
 You don't need prices or profits.

1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:23.220
 You can just protect Mother Russia, right?

1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:26.420
 And serve Mother Russia and that would create wealth.

1:23:26.420 --> 1:23:28.060
 And what happened, right?

1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:29.780
 They destroyed price signals.

1:23:29.780 --> 1:23:32.180
 There were shortages, there were famines,

1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:35.980
 there's all levels of corruption.

1:23:35.980 --> 1:23:38.380
 Because to your point, it's once you,

1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:42.500
 people have to run the system no matter what.

1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:45.420
 So when people are always pursuing something for nothing

1:23:45.420 --> 1:23:46.700
 and you put someone in a seat

1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:49.260
 of much closer to absolute power

1:23:49.260 --> 1:23:51.420
 where they're making all the pricing decisions,

1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:54.820
 they own all of the productive factors in the economy,

1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:57.780
 they're not beholden to any market force.

1:23:57.780 --> 1:24:01.700
 There's no market check on their action

1:24:01.700 --> 1:24:04.820
 that that institution tends to become more corrupt.

1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:08.900
 And further, it's an inferior resource strategy.

1:24:10.700 --> 1:24:12.860
 I alluded to this earlier where the other way

1:24:12.860 --> 1:24:17.340
 to think about free market versus central planning is

1:24:17.340 --> 1:24:20.460
 it's decentralized or distributed computing

1:24:20.460 --> 1:24:21.980
 versus centralized computing.

1:24:22.820 --> 1:24:26.180
 So each one of us, I think that the number

1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:29.460
 is 120 bits per second of active awareness.

1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:32.060
 And so we can take in, clearly we process a lot more

1:24:32.060 --> 1:24:33.180
 than that, but our active awareness,

1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:34.860
 I think is 120 bits per second.

1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:40.700
 In a centralized planning body like in Soviet Russia,

1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:41.900
 they had the pricing czar.

1:24:41.900 --> 1:24:44.740
 Maybe they had 10, 20,000 people deciding the prices

1:24:44.740 --> 1:24:46.100
 for the entire country.

1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:48.980
 You're only getting that much data throughput, right?

1:24:48.980 --> 1:24:52.340
 20,000 people times 120 bits per second.

1:24:52.340 --> 1:24:56.140
 Whereas in a free market, if everyone is free to interact

1:24:56.140 --> 1:24:59.060
 with deep capital markets based on an accurate price,

1:24:59.060 --> 1:25:02.060
 you're getting the data throughput of 120 bits per second

1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:04.460
 times the entire economy, right?

1:25:04.460 --> 1:25:08.820
 So you're getting, it's a more efficient means

1:25:08.820 --> 1:25:11.780
 for disseminating knowledge effectively.

1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:14.020
 And then again, knowledge is just,

1:25:14.020 --> 1:25:17.300
 the more knowledge a socioeconomic structure can contain,

1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.180
 the more wealthy it is, right?

1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:21.780
 Prices, tools, all these things are just knowledge.

1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:26.780
 So in that respect, that's why something like capitalism,

1:25:27.100 --> 1:25:30.740
 even in its marginalized form, state capitalism,

1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:33.100
 out competes communism.

1:25:33.100 --> 1:25:36.420
 It's distributed computing versus centralized computing.

1:25:36.420 --> 1:25:40.620
 You know, we kind of brought up religion

1:25:40.620 --> 1:25:45.620
 and Joseph Campbell and myth and the propagation of ideas.

1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:48.020
 And kind of before I forget,

1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:50.580
 I wanted to ask your thoughts about this.

1:25:50.580 --> 1:25:55.060
 You know, Jordan Peterson, I haven't really understood

1:25:55.060 --> 1:25:58.580
 exactly like be able to pin him down exactly

1:25:58.580 --> 1:26:03.580
 what he sees as the role of religion in human society.

1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:08.580
 But it feels like he's describing it as having value for us.

1:26:12.140 --> 1:26:15.300
 The ideas of myth are valuable.

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:18.460
 They're valuable mechanisms toward,

1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.340
 I think you mentioned kind of directing us

1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:23.620
 in this world as a human society.

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:26.060
 Do you think about myth?

1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:27.460
 Do you think about religion?

1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:31.820
 What's the use of it in this construct of markets

1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:36.820
 in this framework of where ideas are ultimately

1:26:37.940 --> 1:26:42.940
 the fundamental thing that makes societies work?

1:26:44.540 --> 1:26:49.540
 Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson, who I'm a huge fan of,

1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:52.740
 he's been very influential in my thinking

1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:56.180
 and influential on my own religious views as well.

1:26:56.180 --> 1:27:00.180
 I think his position would be, and he's said this before,

1:27:00.180 --> 1:27:03.820
 that he acts as if God exists.

1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.460
 And I've had some arguments about this before,

1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:12.660
 but to me that points towards the preeminence of action

1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:14.180
 and how important action is

1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:17.700
 versus your cognitive beliefs necessarily.

1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:20.820
 And I think there is a lot of utility in that,

1:27:20.820 --> 1:27:24.380
 that if you follow the moral code of something,

1:27:24.380 --> 1:27:28.420
 like the Bible, you do reap benefits from that.

1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:30.500
 Society reaps benefits from that.

1:27:32.700 --> 1:27:35.460
 And sometimes I bring up this point and people are like,

1:27:35.460 --> 1:27:36.300
 oh my God, are you kidding me?

1:27:36.300 --> 1:27:37.620
 Have you read the Old Testament?

1:27:37.620 --> 1:27:39.540
 They're clobbering people with rocks

1:27:39.540 --> 1:27:41.500
 when they do the wrong thing.

1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:44.580
 The Bible doesn't claim to be this,

1:27:44.580 --> 1:27:46.500
 like do everything that was done in the Bible.

1:27:46.500 --> 1:27:48.940
 It's more like charting this moral progression

1:27:48.940 --> 1:27:51.620
 where we came from this very barbaric society

1:27:51.620 --> 1:27:54.220
 into something more like the New Testament

1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:56.820
 where we're honoring individual sovereignty

1:27:56.820 --> 1:27:58.220
 above the state and things like that.

1:27:58.220 --> 1:28:02.980
 So I think that mythology itself

1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:05.580
 is another form of data compression.

1:28:05.580 --> 1:28:08.100
 If you look at these stories,

1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:10.020
 Cain and Abel is a good example,

1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:13.020
 or Peterson makes the point that it's a tiny story.

1:28:13.020 --> 1:28:16.020
 It's a paragraph ish long,

1:28:16.020 --> 1:28:18.620
 but it contains so many layers of meaning

1:28:18.620 --> 1:28:22.620
 in regards to violence, to evil, betrayal, work,

1:28:24.620 --> 1:28:27.220
 the divergence between intention and result,

1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:29.620
 because I think Cain is actually making,

1:28:31.180 --> 1:28:34.420
 he's making the effort to sacrifice for God,

1:28:34.420 --> 1:28:36.700
 but the sacrifices he's making are not,

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:39.180
 God doesn't find them useful.

1:28:39.180 --> 1:28:41.460
 And so he sort of rejects them.

1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:48.260
 Again, if we're organizing these stories

1:28:48.260 --> 1:28:50.500
 we're organized by these useful fictions, right?

1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:53.420
 These, these Herarian imagined orders.

1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:56.820
 I think mythology is kind of the original version of that,

1:28:56.820 --> 1:29:01.820
 where we were learning to organize ourselves around stories

1:29:03.340 --> 1:29:08.340
 to best coordinate our action across space and time.

1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:12.420
 And so I think it's very foundational.

1:29:14.220 --> 1:29:16.180
 And back to what we were saying in the beginning

1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:18.420
 that if value truly is fundamental,

1:29:18.420 --> 1:29:20.900
 I think it's interesting that all these stories

1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:24.620
 point towards often common moral values.

1:29:24.620 --> 1:29:26.380
 They're not perfectly aligned,

1:29:27.700 --> 1:29:32.220
 but it does speak to just the evolutionary importance

1:29:32.220 --> 1:29:34.620
 of morality and the subjectivity of morality,

1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:38.060
 where morality sort of evolves over time based on,

1:29:39.100 --> 1:29:40.900
 frankly, the capital stock we've accumulated.

1:29:40.900 --> 1:29:42.580
 The more capital stock we've accumulated,

1:29:42.580 --> 1:29:45.700
 the easier life is, the less barbaric we have to be.

1:29:45.700 --> 1:29:49.540
 Whereas if we're living in conditions of true scarcity,

1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:54.140
 then we tend to be a bit more barbaric towards one another.

1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:57.180
 And that too, to dovetail this

1:29:57.180 --> 1:29:59.380
 into something largely unrelated,

1:29:59.380 --> 1:30:02.140
 but I think is really important is inflation.

1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:07.380
 Inflation by artificially increasing the prices

1:30:07.380 --> 1:30:09.620
 of goods and services in the world, right?

1:30:09.620 --> 1:30:12.060
 We're injecting more dollars,

1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:15.020
 chasing the same level of goods and services.

1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:17.940
 We are artificially increasing scarcity,

1:30:19.460 --> 1:30:21.700
 perceived scarcity, right?

1:30:21.700 --> 1:30:24.780
 And when you increase perceived scarcity,

1:30:24.780 --> 1:30:27.700
 you are amplifying divisiveness.

1:30:30.060 --> 1:30:33.300
 The natural state of man is when everything is scarce

1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:34.700
 and you really have to fight hard

1:30:34.700 --> 1:30:37.580
 just to eat or drink water that day.

1:30:37.580 --> 1:30:40.540
 So it's decivilizing in a way

1:30:40.540 --> 1:30:42.540
 by artificially amplifying

1:30:42.540 --> 1:30:44.780
 the perceived scarcity in the world.

1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:47.340
 Can you elaborate how does inflation increase

1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:49.220
 the perceived scarcity in the world?

1:30:49.220 --> 1:30:52.980
 So we could think the price itself is an indication,

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:54.620
 it's a data packet, if you will.

1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:57.820
 The price is a data packet on supply and demand, right?

1:30:57.820 --> 1:31:00.460
 It's telling you how much supply there is

1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.540
 of something in the world relative to the demand.

1:31:03.540 --> 1:31:06.460
 So when you print money

1:31:06.460 --> 1:31:08.620
 and artificially increase that price,

1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:10.820
 it's diverging away from supply and demand.

1:31:10.820 --> 1:31:13.820
 It's becoming just more of a product of policy

1:31:13.820 --> 1:31:16.180
 than it is of free market fundamentals.

1:31:17.900 --> 1:31:19.980
 The more expensive something is,

1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:22.860
 that is a signal to the marketplace and to market actors

1:31:22.860 --> 1:31:24.700
 that it is scarce, right?

1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:28.340
 That's why a Leonardo painting

1:31:28.340 --> 1:31:30.780
 might sell for $16 million, there's only one,

1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:32.940
 there's a lot of demand for it.

1:31:32.940 --> 1:31:36.020
 Maybe my numbers are off, but you get the point.

1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:38.420
 It's the reason mask spiked in price

1:31:38.420 --> 1:31:39.940
 after the COVID announcement, right?

1:31:39.940 --> 1:31:41.900
 There was not enough supply,

1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:43.660
 toilet paper, et cetera, et cetera.

1:31:43.660 --> 1:31:47.700
 So inflation, and by inflation,

1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:50.900
 I specifically mean arbitrary fiat currency

1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:53.900
 supply inflation by legal monopoly,

1:31:53.900 --> 1:31:57.340
 not inflation is a commonly misunderstood word.

1:31:57.340 --> 1:32:01.380
 That is amplifying the perception of scarcity

1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:03.580
 among market actors in the world.

1:32:03.580 --> 1:32:07.860
 And I would argue that it actually amplifies divisiveness.

1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:12.060
 I think this is the key maybe to looking at

1:32:12.060 --> 1:32:15.140
 the connection between the monopolization of money

1:32:15.140 --> 1:32:17.180
 and things like cancel culture,

1:32:17.180 --> 1:32:22.180
 because it's increasing our natural predilection

1:32:22.820 --> 1:32:24.340
 to be combative with one another,

1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:26.740
 because we think there's more scarcity in the world

1:32:26.740 --> 1:32:27.980
 than there actually is,

1:32:27.980 --> 1:32:29.900
 versus in a world where you're not increasing

1:32:29.900 --> 1:32:33.220
 the money supply, prices are declining every year.

1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:36.460
 As prices decline, this is a signal to market actors

1:32:36.460 --> 1:32:39.020
 and the market that scarcity is declining.

1:32:39.020 --> 1:32:41.940
 There's less need to fight over things.

1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:46.180
 And all of this ties back into the old Bastiat saying

1:32:46.180 --> 1:32:49.460
 that if goods don't cross borders, soldiers will.

1:32:50.300 --> 1:32:52.020
 So if we're not trading with one another,

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:53.940
 if we're not acting interdependently,

1:32:53.940 --> 1:32:58.940
 and we're not becoming more intelligent as a market,

1:33:00.140 --> 1:33:03.820
 and that increased intelligence or increased knowledge

1:33:03.820 --> 1:33:06.620
 is reflected in decreased prices,

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:11.020
 because prices are just the exchange ratios of things.

1:33:11.020 --> 1:33:12.980
 So the smarter we can solve problems,

1:33:12.980 --> 1:33:15.900
 the better we can solve problems, the less prices would be.

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:18.820
 So it induces more cooperation.

1:33:18.820 --> 1:33:21.660
 I love how you tie inflation and cancel culture together

1:33:21.660 --> 1:33:26.660
 as essentially artificial creation of increase of conflict.

1:33:28.380 --> 1:33:30.420
 Artificially increasing scarcity

1:33:30.420 --> 1:33:33.300
 and thereby artificially increasing conflict.

1:33:33.300 --> 1:33:34.900
 That's really fascinating.

1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:38.460
 You're short circuiting my brain

1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:40.500
 many times throughout this conversation.

1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:45.340
 Okay, this robot is struggling to keep up.

1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:50.340
 Okay, maybe to step back at the useful fictions

1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:53.860
 or pragmatic truths.

1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:56.180
 Let me ask the question that you've answered

1:33:56.180 --> 1:34:00.260
 in many ways already, but let's explicitly look at.

1:34:00.260 --> 1:34:01.900
 What is money?

1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:04.060
 Oh, as you know, that's my favorite question.

1:34:04.060 --> 1:34:04.900
 Yes.

1:34:07.500 --> 1:34:09.940
 Is the name of the show I just launched,

1:34:09.940 --> 1:34:11.420
 the What is Money show?

1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:16.980
 Clearly, we could say that the Bitcoin rabbit hole

1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:20.580
 is what's led me to explore a lot of these ideas in depth.

1:34:22.180 --> 1:34:23.860
 And I think as we've demonstrated today,

1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:26.660
 it goes well beyond just the economic sphere

1:34:26.660 --> 1:34:28.780
 when you start to think about things like exchange

1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:33.140
 and morality and time preference and civilization.

1:34:33.140 --> 1:34:35.980
 So I love the question, what is money?

1:34:35.980 --> 1:34:40.340
 I think it is the key to incepting a deeper understanding

1:34:40.340 --> 1:34:42.260
 of the world into people that if you actually

1:34:42.260 --> 1:34:47.220
 just start to ask the seemingly simple question,

1:34:47.220 --> 1:34:51.420
 it surfaces more and more layers of truth.

1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:55.820
 And I recently, I just wrote a piece,

1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:59.780
 I think I have 30 something answers to this question.

1:34:59.780 --> 1:35:00.620
 So there's.

1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:03.340
 So sometimes it's actually a more systematic way

1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:06.540
 of asking the question of what is the meaning of life?

1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:11.180
 There's some questions that are almost unanswerable,

1:35:11.180 --> 1:35:16.180
 but in their asking allow you to deeply get closer to truth,

1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:21.420
 deeply understand the nature of our human existence.

1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:23.020
 And the meaning of life is almost like

1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:28.020
 this initial philosophers striving towards that.

1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:33.020
 If money is indeed as fundamental as you've described,

1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:38.140
 especially in the context of value being fundamental,

1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:40.380
 then that is a really, that's a more,

1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:43.140
 let's take a 21st century way of asking the same question

1:35:43.140 --> 1:35:45.060
 about what is the meaning of life.

1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:47.740
 You mentioned that it's a meta property

1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:51.080
 out of the list of many ways to answer that question.

1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:53.260
 How would you help people to think about that?

1:35:53.260 --> 1:35:58.260
 Yeah, the first most serious answer

1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:01.440
 comes from the school of Austrian economics

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:06.440
 and it defines money as a universal medium of exchange.

1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:11.500
 So this would be any good that is used,

1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:17.540
 held and used purely for purposes of facilitating exchange.

1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:22.540
 So in the configuration of demand for any particular asset,

1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:26.780
 it's bifurcated between its utility,

1:36:26.780 --> 1:36:28.220
 which is something a service

1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:31.020
 that it can render to you in real time,

1:36:31.020 --> 1:36:35.060
 whether it's, if it's water, you're thirsty,

1:36:35.060 --> 1:36:38.060
 that's the utility of water is that it can quench your thirst

1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:41.900
 whereas the marketability would be the expectation

1:36:41.900 --> 1:36:44.980
 of future exchange that other people would want this asset

1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:47.580
 in the future to trade it for whatever they may have.

1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:53.660
 Money is just going to be the good in any trading economy

1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:56.020
 that has the highest proportion of marketability

1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:57.900
 relative to utility.

1:36:57.900 --> 1:37:00.580
 So today that would be gold.

1:37:00.580 --> 1:37:03.460
 Gold has utility, it's used in electronics,

1:37:03.460 --> 1:37:06.540
 it's used in dental dentistry and whatnot,

1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:09.920
 but it's largely used as a store of value across time

1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:12.200
 and that's what it's been used for for 5,000 years.

1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:16.700
 So if we say gold has a $10 trillion market cap,

1:37:16.700 --> 1:37:19.380
 maybe 2 trillion of that is its utility value

1:37:19.380 --> 1:37:22.620
 or it's actually demand for use in computers and dentistry

1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:24.500
 and an 8 trillion of that is demand

1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:26.240
 for its use as a store of value.

1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:32.540
 Money, the marketability aspects of money

1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:35.820
 boils down to five services that money can render.

1:37:36.780 --> 1:37:40.340
 Money needs to be divisible, it needs to be durable,

1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:42.820
 it needs to be recognizable, it needs to be portable

1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:44.320
 and it needs to be scarce.

1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:47.240
 So I'll gloss over a lot of history with this

1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:50.040
 and just say that historically,

1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:51.920
 money's always been a technology,

1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:53.700
 still is a technology or a tool.

1:37:53.700 --> 1:37:55.180
 I use these terms interchangeably

1:37:55.180 --> 1:37:56.780
 and you think of a technology

1:37:56.780 --> 1:37:59.080
 as just a more sophisticated tool effectively.

1:38:02.620 --> 1:38:03.980
 To best satisfy those properties,

1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:05.620
 monetary metals were determined

1:38:05.620 --> 1:38:08.340
 to be the most satisfactory tool,

1:38:08.340 --> 1:38:10.060
 the most divisible, most durable, most recognizable,

1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:13.180
 most portable tool in the marketplace.

1:38:13.180 --> 1:38:17.060
 Of the monetary metals, gold was the most scarce

1:38:17.060 --> 1:38:20.620
 as quantified by either its stock to flow ratio

1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:22.280
 or its inflation resistance.

1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:25.580
 So simple way to say this is that people always prefer

1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:27.980
 the money most resistant to inflation.

1:38:27.980 --> 1:38:30.780
 That's a nice definition of scarcity in the context.

1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:34.020
 The money is, if you were to measure it,

1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:36.180
 the resistance to inflation.

1:38:36.180 --> 1:38:38.340
 So how hard is it to artificially increase

1:38:38.340 --> 1:38:39.980
 the supply of the thing?

1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:41.860
 That is the hardness of money.

1:38:41.860 --> 1:38:43.420
 And that's why gold is hard money.

1:38:43.420 --> 1:38:44.900
 Because the alchemy is hard.

1:38:44.900 --> 1:38:46.140
 That's right.

1:38:46.140 --> 1:38:47.300
 Because no one cracked the alchemy.

1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:48.380
 So gold became money.

1:38:49.820 --> 1:38:54.820
 So that's such a nice clean explanation of what is money

1:38:56.180 --> 1:38:59.340
 with the five elements and gold ultimately won out

1:38:59.340 --> 1:39:01.740
 because of the last piece of scarcity.

1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:02.580
 That's right.

1:39:02.580 --> 1:39:04.660
 And to get to maybe dig a little deeper there.

1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:08.460
 So scarcity, we commonly think of scarcity

1:39:08.460 --> 1:39:12.460
 as strictly a supply property,

1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:15.260
 where if there's not much of something, then it's scarce.

1:39:15.260 --> 1:39:16.580
 But it's not actually true.

1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:20.780
 Scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply.

1:39:20.780 --> 1:39:24.380
 So when there's more demand than the supply can justify,

1:39:24.380 --> 1:39:26.300
 the thing becomes an economic good

1:39:26.300 --> 1:39:30.060
 and it establishes itself a market price.

1:39:30.060 --> 1:39:31.560
 So there's more demand for the thing

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.780
 than the supply can satisfy.

1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:37.060
 The unique thing about money as a concept at least

1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:40.780
 is that demand always exceeds supply.

1:39:40.780 --> 1:39:43.500
 There's never enough money to satisfy everyone, right?

1:39:43.500 --> 1:39:46.380
 Because another definition for money,

1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.580
 it's the most marketable good.

1:39:48.580 --> 1:39:53.080
 So it can be traded for any other good service,

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:55.140
 piece of knowledge in the marketplace.

1:39:55.140 --> 1:39:58.220
 So humans being what we are, we're never satisfied, right?

1:39:58.220 --> 1:40:01.220
 We always want more of something, whatever it may be.

1:40:01.220 --> 1:40:04.980
 So money as the ultimate token of obtaining that something

1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:07.280
 is always scarce as a concept.

1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:12.580
 But the problem with money is that if you can,

1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:15.500
 as you alluded to, easily increase its supply,

1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:17.060
 then all of a sudden you can compromise

1:40:17.060 --> 1:40:18.580
 the scarcity of it over time

1:40:19.980 --> 1:40:22.180
 and you can rob people through inflation.

1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:26.580
 So that's why the market settled on gold as money.

1:40:26.580 --> 1:40:31.500
 And robbing is reallocating the value that I,

1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:35.540
 so essentially the one property, like why scarcity

1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:40.880
 is important is it adds a lot more friction

1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:45.880
 to the reallocation, like through essentially violence

1:40:47.460 --> 1:40:48.900
 or implied violence.

1:40:48.900 --> 1:40:51.380
 Well, it prevents it through cost of extraction too.

1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:54.460
 So if you want to go out and dilute gold holders today,

1:40:54.460 --> 1:40:57.420
 you have to go out into the world and mine gold.

1:40:57.420 --> 1:40:59.720
 It's a very expensive process.

1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:02.700
 That process tends to find equilibrium

1:41:02.700 --> 1:41:05.180
 where production cost equals the market value of gold.

1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:08.500
 So if market value is $2,000 an ounce today of gold,

1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:10.960
 its production cost is going to be around there.

1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:12.420
 That's the natural market equilibrium.

1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:16.820
 So that way gold miners cannot just dilute people over time.

1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:19.700
 Whereas if you look at something like fiat currency,

1:41:19.700 --> 1:41:21.180
 which we're jumping ahead a little bit,

1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:23.860
 but its production cost is zero.

1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:26.540
 So there's a reason the market value of fiat currency

1:41:26.540 --> 1:41:29.500
 historically has always converged to zero

1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:31.500
 because its production cost is near zero.

1:41:31.500 --> 1:41:34.060
 So the extension to that question might be

1:41:34.060 --> 1:41:37.700
 how did we get from gold to paper currency?

1:41:37.700 --> 1:41:40.460
 And again, this is rooted in the properties of money.

1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:43.140
 As good as monetary metals were

1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:47.660
 and as good as gold is as money at holding value across time,

1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:50.740
 it's rather limited in terms of portability.

1:41:50.740 --> 1:41:54.100
 It is not as useful for moving value across space.

1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:55.820
 This is another definition of money, by the way,

1:41:55.820 --> 1:42:00.340
 a social device for moving value across space and time.

1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:04.820
 So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold,

1:42:04.820 --> 1:42:08.180
 we introduced, first of all,

1:42:08.180 --> 1:42:10.900
 the custody of gold was gradually centralized

1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:15.580
 into fewer and fewer warehousing operations.

1:42:15.580 --> 1:42:17.780
 This is because there are economies of scale

1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:20.980
 associated with using gold as money.

1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:23.120
 And that if you centralize the custody,

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.460
 the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt

1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:28.540
 called a warehouse receipt for that gold.

1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.100
 And then market participants can trade that paper

1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:32.500
 as if it's good as gold.

1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:34.160
 And everyone has an option at any time

1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:36.860
 to go and redeem real gold from the warehouse.

1:42:36.860 --> 1:42:40.740
 So that system works until the problem with it

1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:44.120
 is that it introduces the need to trust the custodian.

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:45.820
 So it's introducing counterparty risk

1:42:45.820 --> 1:42:47.660
 in the form of the custodian.

1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:50.240
 And now should that warehouse choose

1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.140
 to increase the supply of paper notes to gold

1:42:54.140 --> 1:42:55.420
 beyond its supply.

1:42:55.420 --> 1:42:57.580
 So if it's got three tons of gold

1:42:57.580 --> 1:43:00.900
 and it issues six tons worth of paper receipts,

1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:03.440
 all of a sudden it's participating in a fraud.

1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:04.520
 It's basically lying.

1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:06.140
 It's representing that it has more gold

1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:07.460
 than it actually does.

1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.780
 And that is the pathway that we got into banking

1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:14.000
 and central banking,

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.540
 is we needed a convenience mechanism

1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:19.460
 to rectify the portability shortcomings of gold.

1:43:19.460 --> 1:43:22.180
 We needed to be able to move value across space, right?

1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:24.660
 Gold was doing a great job at moving value over time,

1:43:24.660 --> 1:43:26.020
 but not space.

1:43:26.020 --> 1:43:27.380
 Paper currency gave us the ability

1:43:27.380 --> 1:43:29.140
 to move value across space,

1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:31.560
 but it introduced this attack vector

1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:34.200
 for warehouse operators, which became banks,

1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:36.040
 which became central banks,

1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:39.980
 to modify the supply to suit their own political agendas.

1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:41.440
 Added the snooze button.

1:43:42.380 --> 1:43:45.900
 That allows you to do a little fraud.

1:43:45.900 --> 1:43:47.300
 To get something for nothing.

1:43:47.300 --> 1:43:49.140
 Something, just a little bit at first.

1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:53.500
 Just this one morning, just a little bit.

1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:55.020
 I mean, I don't know if you can speak

1:43:55.020 --> 1:44:00.020
 to the birth of fiat currency.

1:44:00.140 --> 1:44:04.180
 Is there some interesting characteristics

1:44:04.180 --> 1:44:07.580
 to those early steps that created it?

1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.940
 Like, could it have been averted?

1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:14.940
 Or is this the natural progression of governments?

1:44:14.940 --> 1:44:18.240
 You know, what's funny is that central banking

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:22.560
 was initially designed to be the custodian of gold, right?

1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:25.640
 And so they were going to custody the gold,

1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:27.800
 issue paper on top of it,

1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:30.560
 and then they would maintain,

1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:32.560
 you could trust the public stamp effectively.

1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:33.840
 You could trust that the central bank

1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:36.480
 had as much gold on reserve as they said they had,

1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:38.360
 and they were supposed to be the trustworthy institution.

1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:41.160
 So we went from placing our trust

1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:43.800
 in a free market game theoretic process,

1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:45.960
 or trusting gold,

1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:48.360
 and we began trusting this institution instead.

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:54.440
 This, that institution would not have arisen

1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:58.160
 if the portability of gold was really high.

1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:00.380
 If we could have somehow sent gold

1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:02.320
 across a telecommunications channel,

1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:05.080
 there would have been no need for a central bank.

1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:07.560
 Everyone could have custodyed their gold

1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:10.760
 in any information bearing medium, frankly,

1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:13.760
 and they could beam it around the world at any time.

1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:16.920
 So this whole institution itself

1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.080
 is rooted in a technological shortcoming of gold.

1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:24.160
 So I think it's, another way to think about that

1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:28.600
 is maybe had there been all the gold in the world today

1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:31.000
 fills two Olympic sized swimming pools,

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.960
 all the gold mined throughout all of human history.

1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:34.780
 So there's not a lot, right?

1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.760
 What if there had been just like way more?

1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:39.600
 There'd just been, I don't know,

1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:41.840
 20,000 Olympic swimming pools worth.

1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:45.280
 Portability wouldn't have been as much of an issue, right?

1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:46.960
 We could have, and this is to say,

1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:48.920
 assuming gold was still the most scarce metal

1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:50.000
 and all these things,

1:45:52.100 --> 1:45:53.440
 portability would have been less of an issue.

1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:55.960
 We would have had less dependence

1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:57.960
 or need for a central bank.

1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:00.200
 So I think it's kind of idiosyncratic

1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:03.720
 in that we just happened to end up here on this planet

1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:05.120
 with a certain amount of gold.

1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:07.400
 It best satisfied the properties of money.

1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:08.920
 And a certain amount of humans,

1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:12.120
 a geographic dispersed such that portability

1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:14.280
 had certain properties that you want to achieve

1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:16.080
 for humans in the geographical space

1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:18.720
 to be able to be a exchange value.

1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:20.920
 It became more of an issue as we globalized, right?

1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:22.560
 As we became more of a global society,

1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:26.440
 we needed money that could move across space really fast.

1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:29.620
 So we could trade in international capital markets.

1:46:29.620 --> 1:46:33.520
 So that drove the central bank

1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:35.680
 to become the dominant institution of the world.

1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.080
 And if you follow the flows of gold throughout history,

1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:41.200
 you know, I've been watching this documentary

1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:43.640
 on World War I and World War II on Netflix.

1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:45.840
 I think it's called World War II in Color.

1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:47.680
 Oh yeah, that's really good.

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:48.520
 So good.

1:46:50.640 --> 1:46:53.480
 When I say gold has been the governor of governments

1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:55.080
 or gold is geopolitical money,

1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:59.140
 like it is the base layer operating system,

1:46:59.140 --> 1:47:02.120
 has been the base layer operating system for analog society.

1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:05.680
 So it's always been about who controls the gold,

1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:07.760
 is who makes the rules.

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.200
 And that's, in that context,

1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:12.720
 is why Bitcoin is so interesting

1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:16.280
 because it is the disruptor to

1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:18.840
 this base level operating system

1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:22.040
 that's functioned for all of human history.

1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:24.440
 I think this is a good place to ask,

1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:26.320
 we asked the what is money question.

1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:29.100
 What is Bitcoin?

1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:34.100
 That's a question as complicated as what is money?

1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:39.160
 I think if you get a general understanding of money

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:42.800
 from a number of angles,

1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:47.800
 that we could say Bitcoin is the most superior

1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:50.480
 monetary technology that has ever existed.

1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.760
 So one of the most superior implementation

1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:56.720
 of the ideas of money that you talked about,

1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.320
 you talked about money as speech,

1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:00.120
 you talked about money as an idea,

1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:04.040
 we talked about money as sovereignty.

1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:04.880
 Yeah.

1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:08.160
 So we're attaching the concept of money, to your point,

1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:13.160
 to whatever tool best satisfies those properties of money

1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:16.840
 or best renders those services we need for money.

1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:19.320
 And as you said, you're using the word tool

1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:20.720
 and technology interchangeably here.

1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:22.300
 Yes, yes.

1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:24.820
 And another thing to think about here is that

1:48:24.820 --> 1:48:28.480
 we think often in terms of goods or services,

1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:31.880
 but actually everything is a service.

1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:35.520
 So it's not the physical properties of this pen

1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:36.800
 that I find valuable,

1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.800
 it's the services that it renders to me,

1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:40.460
 that I want to write a letter,

1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:45.460
 this serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper

1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:47.880
 and communicate information.

1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:52.880
 So value, humans attach value as we alluded to earlier,

1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:55.520
 two services, not goods.

1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:58.080
 So the properties or the services that money renders

1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:00.760
 that human beings value are those five properties,

1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:01.920
 divisibility, durability,

1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:04.320
 recognizability, portability, scarcity.

1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:09.280
 Metals best satisfied those services historically,

1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.280
 but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology

1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:16.640
 in human history, essentially perfects them.

1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:18.400
 It's as close to perfection as we've ever been.

1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:21.040
 So in terms of divisibility,

1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.120
 each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million subunits

1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:26.200
 called a satoshi.

1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:31.480
 If that divisibility were ever a problem,

1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:35.120
 which actually there was a question that came up recently,

1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:37.440
 if you divide the world population

1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:38.760
 by the total supply of Bitcoin,

1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:42.000
 you end up at like 0.3 Bitcoin per person,

1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.060
 call it 300,000 satoshis per person.

1:49:46.060 --> 1:49:50.560
 What if that was not enough to facilitate economic activity?

1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:53.200
 And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork

1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:54.560
 into further divisibility.

1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:57.000
 So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world

1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:00.480
 and the average Bitcoin or wealth

1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:02.080
 will say 300,000 satoshis each,

1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:06.160
 but that wasn't divisible enough maybe to buy coffee

1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:07.560
 and do all these day to day transactions,

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:08.400
 what would happen?

1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:09.800
 Well, we would increase its divisibility.

1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:12.480
 So Bitcoin's perfected divisibility,

1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:13.820
 the divisibility of money,

1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:16.440
 lets us transact across scales, right?

1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:21.240
 We can buy coffee or we can buy a house.

1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.160
 Durability is an interesting one.

1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:25.400
 So clearly something like gold is very durable.

1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:28.280
 It's resistant to degradation over time.

1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:30.280
 Bitcoin is just pure information,

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:33.540
 but it's stored in a distributed format.

1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:37.000
 So information stored in a distributed fashion

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.840
 tends to be virtually infinitely durable.

1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:41.800
 The example I'd like to give here

1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:43.600
 is something like the Bible.

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.100
 The Bible is just distributed information.

1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.240
 It's stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.

1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:52.060
 And for that reason, it has outlasted empires.

1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:54.360
 And Bitcoin's similar, right?

1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:57.080
 You can't make changes to it unilaterally.

1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:01.960
 But to make explicit the ways in which it is not durable

1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:05.440
 is the fact that it relies on computing infrastructure.

1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:08.360
 Like it needs computers.

1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:11.160
 So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world,

1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:16.160
 it needs mechanisms that store and transfer information.

1:51:17.620 --> 1:51:20.100
 And so you could attack it.

1:51:20.100 --> 1:51:22.100
 I mean, you could attack gold in the same kind of way,

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:23.800
 I suppose, through the physics,

1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:26.260
 but it's probably easier to destroy

1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:27.380
 all the computers in the world

1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:30.300
 than it is to destroy all the gold in the world.

1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:32.340
 Maybe not, I don't know.

1:51:32.340 --> 1:51:33.660
 Anyway.

1:51:33.660 --> 1:51:34.740
 Yeah, you're right.

1:51:35.660 --> 1:51:38.480
 Maybe, I'm not sure which one would be harder to destroy.

1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:41.900
 The other thing is there's a dynamic incentive.

1:51:41.900 --> 1:51:44.820
 So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners,

1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:46.580
 you're creating incentives for anyone else

1:51:46.580 --> 1:51:48.900
 with access to electricity to mine

1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:50.700
 because you're making the algorithm easier.

1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:54.100
 Yeah, so the destruction is difficult

1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:56.580
 because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing.

1:51:56.580 --> 1:51:57.900
 And the difficulty adjustment.

1:51:57.900 --> 1:52:00.480
 Yeah, so you're gonna have to use nuclear weapons

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.620
 and cover the whole globe, but anyway.

1:52:02.620 --> 1:52:03.860
 Yeah, and by then,

1:52:03.860 --> 1:52:06.020
 we've got much bigger problems than money, right?

1:52:06.020 --> 1:52:09.660
 That's right, so okay, so that's durability.

1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:12.300
 So portability, Bitcoin's pure information,

1:52:12.300 --> 1:52:13.620
 it can move at the speed of light,

1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:15.900
 can't get much faster than that.

1:52:15.900 --> 1:52:19.540
 Recognizability refers to the ability

1:52:19.540 --> 1:52:23.360
 to verify the veracity of the money or its authenticity.

1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:27.320
 So you can actually, when we used to transact gold,

1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:30.000
 there were time honored techniques for verifying

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.980
 that it was gold and not gold plated lead, for instance.

1:52:32.980 --> 1:52:34.860
 This is where we get the term sound money.

1:52:34.860 --> 1:52:36.760
 A gold coin made a very particular sound

1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:38.620
 when dropped from a certain height.

1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:40.220
 You've seen people biting coins.

1:52:40.220 --> 1:52:44.100
 These are all techniques for testing the authenticity of gold.

1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:46.440
 And with Bitcoin, we have something unique

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:48.300
 in that if you're running a full node,

1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:51.180
 you can verify that the Bitcoin is Bitcoin, right?

1:52:51.180 --> 1:52:54.880
 It cannot be tampered with, it cannot be faked.

1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:57.260
 And in addition to that, as a node operator,

1:52:57.260 --> 1:53:00.000
 you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin at any time,

1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.560
 which is unlike any money in history.

1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:04.180
 So you know with full certainty,

1:53:04.180 --> 1:53:06.820
 if you're holding 1000 Bitcoin,

1:53:06.820 --> 1:53:10.420
 you have 1000 out of a possible 21 million forever.

1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:13.040
 You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply.

1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:14.740
 Yeah, so a full node contains information

1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:16.580
 about every transaction that's ever been had

1:53:16.580 --> 1:53:19.180
 so you can figure out, yeah, I mean,

1:53:19.180 --> 1:53:23.840
 all the truth of this money is all right there.

1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:25.800
 Yeah, it's like a fractal constituent

1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:27.100
 of the whole network, right?

1:53:27.100 --> 1:53:30.820
 The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node too.

1:53:30.820 --> 1:53:32.180
 Not the proof of work piece,

1:53:32.180 --> 1:53:34.380
 but the entire transaction history.

1:53:34.380 --> 1:53:37.060
 And so that's unique as well.

1:53:37.060 --> 1:53:39.940
 And that's what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store of value

1:53:39.940 --> 1:53:43.780
 is that you know with certainty what the total supply is

1:53:43.780 --> 1:53:45.100
 and will ever be.

1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:49.440
 And you know that your share of that supply is fixed.

1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:50.460
 It cannot change.

1:53:50.460 --> 1:53:51.860
 It can only improve actually.

1:53:51.860 --> 1:53:53.700
 If someone loses, you know,

1:53:53.700 --> 1:53:56.020
 if the Satoshi stash is truly gone forever,

1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:58.000
 the million Bitcoin never moves,

1:53:58.000 --> 1:53:59.960
 then we're talking about 1000 Bitcoin

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:03.140
 out of 20 million instead and so on and so forth.

1:54:03.140 --> 1:54:05.760
 As more people lose access to their Bitcoin,

1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:08.060
 they're basically making a contribution to everyone else.

1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:09.560
 It's anti dilutive.

1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:13.200
 And there's certain properties of Bitcoin

1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:15.500
 that are sort of a little bit more into the details

1:54:15.500 --> 1:54:19.080
 that ensure that the full nodes,

1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.860
 like the size of all the transactions that ever happened,

1:54:22.860 --> 1:54:24.340
 at least currently can be stored

1:54:24.340 --> 1:54:25.740
 in a single computer, for example.

1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:28.040
 So it doesn't blow up too quickly.

1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:28.880
 That's right.

1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:32.100
 But you know, there's arguments that that's not necessarily,

1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:35.660
 you can make arguments for that to be a very nice property,

1:54:35.660 --> 1:54:38.260
 but you can also say that there's like drawbacks to it.

1:54:38.260 --> 1:54:41.540
 That's hence the block size debates

1:54:41.540 --> 1:54:42.500
 and all those kinds of things.

1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:45.300
 Yeah, that was the Bitcoin Cash Civil War, right?

1:54:45.300 --> 1:54:47.580
 Was that particular piece.

1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:48.420
 Yeah.

1:54:48.420 --> 1:54:50.780
 And, you know, ostensibly they were saying,

1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:52.840
 oh, we need more transaction throughput

1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:55.380
 to buy more coffee and do more transactions.

1:54:55.380 --> 1:54:57.520
 But what they were actually doing

1:54:57.520 --> 1:55:01.900
 was increasing the size computing power necessary

1:55:01.900 --> 1:55:03.060
 to run a full node,

1:55:03.060 --> 1:55:06.800
 which would have theoretically compromised decentralization.

1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:09.540
 So yeah, but it would in theory,

1:55:09.540 --> 1:55:11.660
 and this is, you know, in theory,

1:55:11.660 --> 1:55:15.100
 it would allow you to have much more transactions.

1:55:15.100 --> 1:55:16.020
 That's right.

1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:18.540
 But the drawback, it would,

1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:21.740
 because of no longer can be stored in a single computer,

1:55:21.740 --> 1:55:24.740
 personal computer, then it naturally leads

1:55:24.740 --> 1:55:25.940
 to the centralization.

1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:26.780
 Yes.

1:55:26.780 --> 1:55:28.060
 Which you see with gold.

1:55:28.060 --> 1:55:30.660
 Which would have compromised its survivability.

1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:31.780
 Right.

1:55:31.780 --> 1:55:34.300
 So, I said, what else is there?

1:55:34.300 --> 1:55:36.300
 The last one, which leads straight into this one,

1:55:36.300 --> 1:55:38.460
 actually is the most important one of money,

1:55:38.460 --> 1:55:40.020
 which is scarcity.

1:55:40.020 --> 1:55:45.020
 And that you need to know the supply is fixed

1:55:45.220 --> 1:55:49.460
 and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation,

1:55:49.460 --> 1:55:52.620
 which counterfeiting and inflation are the same thing,

1:55:52.620 --> 1:55:53.740
 by the way.

1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:57.460
 Counterfeiting is criminalized inflation.

1:55:57.460 --> 1:56:00.140
 Inflation is legalized counterfeiting.

1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:01.780
 So central banks today,

1:56:01.780 --> 1:56:03.220
 when they say they're printing money, they're not.

1:56:03.220 --> 1:56:05.480
 They're counterfeiting currency.

1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.140
 That's a very important part.

1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:10.420
 And Bitcoin, as I've argued in some of my writing,

1:56:11.380 --> 1:56:13.540
 is more than just an invention.

1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:16.840
 It's actually the discovery of absolute scarcity.

1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.040
 And that we have unveiled a property of money

1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:25.040
 that we will only discover once, and it's got really

1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:28.720
 major ramifications for the world at large.

1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:33.660
 So with gold, for instance, as we've covered,

1:56:33.660 --> 1:56:36.980
 it became money because it was the most relatively scarce

1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:37.980
 monetary metal, right?

1:56:37.980 --> 1:56:41.100
 Its supply was hardest to increase over time.

1:56:41.100 --> 1:56:44.180
 However, if we could somehow flip a switch today

1:56:44.180 --> 1:56:46.920
 and make everyone in the world go out and start mining gold,

1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:49.100
 we could increase the supply much more quickly.

1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:50.980
 We could, you know, it's historic inflation rates

1:56:50.980 --> 1:56:53.480
 about 2%, we could double that pretty quickly.

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:58.580
 Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible.

1:56:58.580 --> 1:57:02.500
 So no matter how much effort and energy and capital

1:57:02.500 --> 1:57:05.540
 and operational expenditure we pour into the mining network,

1:57:05.540 --> 1:57:08.300
 we cannot deviate from its fixed

1:57:08.300 --> 1:57:11.000
 and diminishing supply curve from between now

1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.620
 and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140

1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:15.020
 because of the difficulty adjustment.

1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:18.420
 It's constantly, it's adapting to human action actually.

1:57:18.420 --> 1:57:21.940
 So the harder we pursue it, the more that it recedes,

1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:23.340
 and then the less we pursue it,

1:57:23.340 --> 1:57:26.020
 the more available it makes itself.

1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:30.300
 And this is, it's a real major breakthrough

1:57:30.300 --> 1:57:34.640
 because it's the closest thing to perfect information

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:37.340
 we've ever had in an economy.

1:57:37.340 --> 1:57:41.340
 And perfect information is this, it's a theoretical,

1:57:41.340 --> 1:57:46.340
 but unattainable state of the market where all market actors

1:57:46.340 --> 1:57:50.220
 have all the relevant information about everything

1:57:50.220 --> 1:57:53.100
 so that they can compete as efficiently as possible.

1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:56.060
 And in a state of pure information, we have,

1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:59.020
 I'm sorry, perfect information, we have perfect competition.

1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:03.140
 And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation.

1:58:03.140 --> 1:58:06.420
 So we're competing as freely as possible

1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:10.140
 from coercive and violent impediments.

1:58:10.140 --> 1:58:13.220
 And so I think Bitcoin in that sense

1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:17.900
 is going to pull the world closer to a state

1:58:17.900 --> 1:58:21.720
 of perfect competition than we've ever been before,

1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:24.560
 which would increase wealth generation

1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:26.460
 to an extent we've never seen before.

1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:30.460
 Many of the things you said about Bitcoin

1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:32.860
 also hold for other cryptocurrency technologies

1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:34.320
 that followed after.

1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:40.680
 Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin

1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:43.900
 is the superior technology

1:58:43.900 --> 1:58:48.900
 from a pragmatic truth perspective than say Ethereum,

1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:52.660
 but also other crypto, like Bitcoin Cash,

1:58:52.660 --> 1:58:55.380
 like other hard forks of Bitcoin,

1:58:55.380 --> 1:58:59.780
 and maybe things that might yet to be invented,

1:58:59.780 --> 1:59:01.420
 tools yet to be invented?

1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:05.100
 Yeah, so this is a good point of argument

1:59:05.100 --> 1:59:08.380
 because a lot of people have countered me and said,

1:59:08.380 --> 1:59:11.260
 Bitcoin cannot be absolute scarcity

1:59:11.260 --> 1:59:13.220
 because you can fork it and create something

1:59:13.220 --> 1:59:15.500
 with the same properties as Bitcoin

1:59:15.500 --> 1:59:17.700
 or potentially even better properties, right?

1:59:17.700 --> 1:59:20.500
 You create something with a deflationary monetary policy.

1:59:21.620 --> 1:59:23.620
 That's what Bitcoin Cash was actually.

1:59:23.620 --> 1:59:26.220
 It forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties

1:59:26.220 --> 1:59:29.260
 except for the block size that we alluded to earlier.

1:59:29.260 --> 1:59:33.020
 The problem is that money is valued.

1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:36.580
 Again, it's the good with a configuration of demand

1:59:36.580 --> 1:59:40.400
 that is predominantly marketability.

1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:43.560
 So it is valued based on its liquidity.

1:59:43.560 --> 1:59:46.620
 That is how many other trading partners are there

1:59:46.620 --> 1:59:48.780
 in that monetary network.

1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:53.420
 So it is a network valued because of its liquidity

1:59:53.420 --> 1:59:54.820
 and network effects.

1:59:54.820 --> 1:59:57.980
 So any new entrant into the market for money

1:59:59.180 --> 2:00:02.780
 is incentivized to always choose the money

2:00:02.780 --> 2:00:06.460
 with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects.

2:00:06.460 --> 2:00:10.540
 This is why money has tended to be a winner take all market

2:00:10.540 --> 2:00:13.480
 because it's essentially a single purpose tool, right?

2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:15.620
 It is a tool for,

2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:19.700
 if we consider that tools are time saving devices, right?

2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:21.680
 The shovel that you dig more holes per man hour

2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:23.180
 than you can with your bare hands.

2:00:23.180 --> 2:00:26.280
 Money is a tool, there's yet another definition of money

2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:28.580
 that lets us calculate, negotiate

2:00:28.580 --> 2:00:30.520
 and execute trades more quickly.

2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:36.180
 So that function tends to coalesce

2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:38.500
 towards one solution.

2:00:38.500 --> 2:00:40.860
 And so the short answer would be that

2:00:40.860 --> 2:00:44.620
 for the same reasons, quantifiable reasons, right?

2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:48.500
 Like inflation resistance and liquidity and network effects

2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:50.660
 that we have one analog gold,

2:00:50.660 --> 2:00:53.540
 we're only likely to have one digital gold.

2:00:53.540 --> 2:00:55.500
 And I think the Bitcoin Cash Fork

2:00:55.500 --> 2:00:57.220
 proves that out empirically.

2:00:57.220 --> 2:00:59.540
 It's a good case study because.

2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:00.860
 Well, it's one case study, right?

2:01:00.860 --> 2:01:02.980
 But okay, so that's really well put.

2:01:02.980 --> 2:01:04.580
 So like gold was sticky.

2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:08.460
 Once it was accepted, the network effects,

2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:11.020
 the winner take all took over.

2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:15.380
 And here's a fundamentally different kind of like

2:01:15.380 --> 2:01:18.700
 analog versus digital is a leap in technologies.

2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:19.900
 That's right.

2:01:19.900 --> 2:01:23.040
 And you're suggesting that there may not be,

2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:29.100
 there's unlikely to be other leaps of that kind

2:01:29.100 --> 2:01:32.260
 into a whole nother kind of space of technologies.

2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:34.700
 I would argue that Bitcoin,

2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:38.040
 it's kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold,

2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:39.380
 taking the monetary properties of gold

2:01:39.380 --> 2:01:41.860
 and combining them with the internet itself.

2:01:41.860 --> 2:01:43.220
 And in doing so,

2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:47.140
 it has essentially perfected the properties of money, right?

2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:49.700
 You can't get more divisible, durable, recognizable,

2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:51.780
 portable, or scarce than Bitcoin.

2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:54.260
 So Satoshi has kind of,

2:01:54.260 --> 2:01:58.360
 he left no design space for a superior technology

2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:01.320
 to intercede and out compete Bitcoin at this point.

2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:02.720
 Now that it's established liquidity

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.740
 in the network effects. Far superior technology, right?

2:02:04.740 --> 2:02:07.340
 Yeah, but it's a combination of the tech itself

2:02:07.340 --> 2:02:10.220
 and the social layer that is coalesced to it.

2:02:10.220 --> 2:02:11.740
 You can't separate those two out.

2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:15.020
 Like they're all connected and then the political as well.

2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:17.460
 I mean, but the portability, for example,

2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:20.060
 that's another way to phrase that is the,

2:02:20.060 --> 2:02:22.000
 what is it, the scaling.

2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.400
 So the number of transactions,

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:27.080
 that's a limitation for Bitcoin

2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:30.880
 that many argue is a feature, many argue is a bug.

2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:33.500
 You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies

2:02:33.500 --> 2:02:37.020
 that are able to achieve much higher,

2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:40.420
 much faster frequency of transactions,

2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:43.500
 much more transactions, you know, all that kind of stuff.

2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:46.420
 What are your thoughts on that?

2:02:47.380 --> 2:02:49.660
 You know, the low level of transactions

2:02:49.660 --> 2:02:51.760
 that's possible with Bitcoin.

2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:52.880
 Do you think that's a feature?

2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:54.500
 Do you think that's a bug?

2:02:54.500 --> 2:02:56.860
 Necessary for security actually.

2:02:56.860 --> 2:03:00.280
 And even these other crypto assets that settle more quickly,

2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:03.660
 they settle with less assurance of finality.

2:03:03.660 --> 2:03:07.080
 So Nick Carter has a great piece on this actually called,

2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:09.260
 the settlement assurance is stupid.

2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:11.540
 It's really good where the gist of it is

2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:16.540
 that there is more work being done in each block of Bitcoin

2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:20.700
 that it can't, it is less vulnerable to reversion.

2:03:20.700 --> 2:03:23.900
 So it's giving you higher degrees of assurance

2:03:23.900 --> 2:03:26.040
 that your settlement or your trade has occurred

2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:28.540
 with finality, whereas other blockchains

2:03:28.540 --> 2:03:30.140
 are much more vulnerable.

2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:35.780
 And again, with Bitcoin, the evolutionary path of money

2:03:35.780 --> 2:03:40.600
 with gold is that it was first used as a collectible.

2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:43.140
 It then became used as a store value.

2:03:43.140 --> 2:03:44.740
 After it had stored enough value,

2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:48.740
 it began to be used as a medium of exchange.

2:03:48.740 --> 2:03:50.260
 And then finally, when it was used widely enough

2:03:50.260 --> 2:03:52.580
 as a medium of exchange, it becomes a unit of account.

2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:54.940
 We actually start to think in the money.

2:03:54.940 --> 2:03:56.880
 Bitcoin's following a similar path.

2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:00.420
 So started out as kind of a collectible.

2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:02.260
 Today, I would argue it's a store value,

2:04:02.260 --> 2:04:05.620
 one of the most effective store value we've ever seen.

2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:08.580
 So that evolutionary path that Bitcoin's following

2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:10.260
 is similar to gold.

2:04:10.260 --> 2:04:12.260
 First a collectible, today a store value.

2:04:12.260 --> 2:04:13.940
 To be an effective store value,

2:04:13.940 --> 2:04:18.540
 it has to optimize for supply cap.

2:04:18.540 --> 2:04:19.900
 That has to be the first,

2:04:19.900 --> 2:04:22.300
 and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do

2:04:22.300 --> 2:04:23.780
 to be successful by the way.

2:04:23.780 --> 2:04:25.860
 Exactly what it's been doing for 12 years,

2:04:25.860 --> 2:04:27.420
 virtually flawlessly,

2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:30.340
 which is keep creating a block every 10 minutes

2:04:30.340 --> 2:04:33.120
 and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million.

2:04:34.020 --> 2:04:35.860
 As long as those two things hold,

2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:40.620
 it is sound money, the ultimate sound money,

2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:44.620
 the most inflation resistant money there's ever been.

2:04:44.620 --> 2:04:47.800
 It's actually completely immune.

2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:50.340
 It's taken unexpected inflation to 0%.

2:04:50.340 --> 2:04:51.620
 We know with perfect certainty

2:04:51.620 --> 2:04:53.420
 what Bitcoin supply will ever be.

2:04:53.420 --> 2:04:58.420
 For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange,

2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:02.260
 it can't make trade offs at the base layer

2:05:02.260 --> 2:05:05.340
 to increase its portability for instance.

2:05:05.340 --> 2:05:07.980
 Even though portability is maybe kind of a misnomer

2:05:07.980 --> 2:05:10.620
 because Bitcoin has extremely high portability,

2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:13.500
 just doesn't have extremely high transaction throughput.

2:05:13.500 --> 2:05:16.680
 So we could say you can move it pretty quickly

2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:17.520
 anywhere in the world

2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:20.980
 as long as you're willing to bid up for the block space,

2:05:20.980 --> 2:05:24.980
 but you can't satisfy all the world's economic volume.

2:05:24.980 --> 2:05:27.100
 You can't do 300 million transactions per second

2:05:27.100 --> 2:05:29.580
 like you can on a centralized database like Visa.

2:05:30.700 --> 2:05:34.740
 But Bitcoin needs to be this,

2:05:34.740 --> 2:05:36.380
 it has to be a store value first

2:05:36.380 --> 2:05:38.740
 before it can be a medium of exchange.

2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:42.620
 So it has to protect the supply cap first

2:05:42.620 --> 2:05:44.340
 before making any trade offs for that.

2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:48.340
 And I would argue that that's why Bitcoin is so rigid,

2:05:48.340 --> 2:05:50.140
 is that it's optimized for survivability

2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:51.720
 and optimized for that supply cap.

2:05:51.720 --> 2:05:56.100
 And it's pushing experimentation and other features

2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:57.760
 that would increase its transaction throughput

2:05:57.760 --> 2:05:59.420
 to higher layers.

2:05:59.420 --> 2:06:01.420
 So I think Lightning Network

2:06:01.420 --> 2:06:03.460
 is something that's very interesting.

2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:05.700
 It's still early,

2:06:05.700 --> 2:06:08.660
 but there's a lot of throughput already being used

2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:10.540
 on the Lightning Network.

2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:14.260
 And it makes some slight trade offs

2:06:14.260 --> 2:06:16.060
 in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin.

2:06:16.060 --> 2:06:18.180
 You end up trusting these smart contracts

2:06:18.180 --> 2:06:19.500
 instead of move the Bitcoin,

2:06:19.500 --> 2:06:22.940
 but you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput.

2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:25.620
 So that's how, and that's how biology evolves.

2:06:25.620 --> 2:06:26.780
 That's how the internet evolved.

2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:27.860
 It evolves in layers.

2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:29.960
 So I think Bitcoin,

2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:31.020
 you can sort of conceive of it

2:06:31.020 --> 2:06:33.820
 as the latest layer to the internet.

2:06:33.820 --> 2:06:36.860
 And it's one that preserves this store value property

2:06:36.860 --> 2:06:38.920
 better than any asset we've ever had.

2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:41.820
 Let me ask sort of a critical question of,

2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:46.060
 if you're wrong about your statements about Bitcoin,

2:06:46.060 --> 2:06:51.060
 and you find out years from now that you were wrong,

2:06:51.860 --> 2:06:53.140
 what would that look like?

2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:55.300
 What would be the things

2:06:55.300 --> 2:06:57.520
 that make you realize you were wrong?

2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:01.320
 Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:03.180
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:04.020
 All the time.

2:07:04.020 --> 2:07:08.480
 Because you speak very confidently about Bitcoin.

2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:11.580
 And one of the things, let me put it this way.

2:07:11.580 --> 2:07:13.440
 I think certainty,

2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:16.640
 I feel like that's like a stoic statement.

2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:19.800
 Certainty leads to ruin, something like that.

2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:24.800
 Like certainty, I think is an antithesis to progress often.

2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:28.260
 And especially in your writing,

2:07:28.260 --> 2:07:29.920
 but this is true for the Bitcoin community.

2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:34.920
 There's a certainty about the Bitcoin.

2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:36.860
 And that makes me very skeptical,

2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:38.880
 no matter how good the ideas are.

2:07:38.880 --> 2:07:42.220
 Whenever things are good, this might be the Russian in me.

2:07:42.220 --> 2:07:46.160
 I think like, what are the ways this is gonna go wrong?

2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:48.800
 So what do you think are the ways this might go wrong

2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:53.040
 or you're wrong in your conception of what Bitcoin is?

2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:58.040
 Yeah, so science evolves via negativa,

2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:04.200
 meaning that we're not proving hypotheses

2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:06.940
 and that's what becomes the body of science.

2:08:06.940 --> 2:08:11.940
 Science is whatever is left over as we disprove hypotheses.

2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:17.340
 Whatever we can empirically, through experimentation,

2:08:17.340 --> 2:08:19.680
 disprove, gets discarded.

2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:23.180
 And whatever remains, whatever theory remains,

2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:26.660
 it hasn't been disproven, is science, effectively.

2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:33.500
 This process is similar to market actors zeroing in

2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:35.620
 on a store value, right?

2:08:35.620 --> 2:08:37.760
 They're experimenting with different forms

2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:41.180
 of storing wealth across time.

2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.540
 Some do better than others

2:08:42.540 --> 2:08:45.540
 and eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best.

2:08:45.540 --> 2:08:46.800
 That's what gold was.

2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:51.280
 In terms of understanding Bitcoin,

2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:53.460
 I look at it as a similar approach.

2:08:53.460 --> 2:08:55.660
 And that is the main question I'm asking myself

2:08:55.660 --> 2:08:57.580
 is how do you stop this thing?

2:08:57.580 --> 2:08:59.220
 How do you turn it off?

2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:00.060
 How do you end it?

2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:02.220
 If you're a nation state, particularly,

2:09:02.220 --> 2:09:05.220
 who has the most to lose in this transition,

2:09:05.220 --> 2:09:08.500
 what is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin?

2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:12.140
 I mean, that is the $250 trillion question.

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:16.580
 And I've spent five years thinking about this thing

2:09:16.580 --> 2:09:17.420
 very deeply.

2:09:17.420 --> 2:09:19.400
 I've read everything on monetary history.

2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:20.760
 I can get my hands on.

2:09:23.660 --> 2:09:27.860
 The general thought of how it is stopped,

2:09:27.860 --> 2:09:31.300
 and this is the snag point that a lot of people get to

2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:32.820
 in their explorations down the rabbit hole,

2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:35.180
 is they just say the government will never allow it.

2:09:35.180 --> 2:09:36.580
 And that becomes kind of their bottom.

2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:37.800
 It's like, all right, Bitcoin's interesting,

2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:39.140
 it's superior money, blah, blah, blah,

2:09:39.140 --> 2:09:40.780
 but the government will never allow it.

2:09:40.780 --> 2:09:41.620
 And they say.

2:09:41.620 --> 2:09:43.340
 Was Ray Dalio, did he say that?

2:09:43.340 --> 2:09:45.800
 Dalio was currently stuck there, yeah.

2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:50.800
 So Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising.

2:09:52.580 --> 2:09:55.880
 If it is in fact as promising as it looks,

2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:58.260
 governments are going to,

2:09:59.260 --> 2:10:00.860
 I don't forget what the exact quote is,

2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:02.280
 but not allowed.

2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:03.660
 Ban it.

2:10:03.660 --> 2:10:05.300
 Governments will ban it.

2:10:05.300 --> 2:10:09.940
 So how do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?

2:10:09.940 --> 2:10:10.780
 Well.

2:10:10.780 --> 2:10:12.740
 And how do you get unstuck from that idea

2:10:12.740 --> 2:10:14.860
 that governments, will governments,

2:10:14.860 --> 2:10:18.440
 how do you prevent governments from stopping a thing

2:10:18.440 --> 2:10:21.280
 that threatens centralized power?

2:10:22.580 --> 2:10:24.500
 Well, Bitcoin is an idea.

2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:30.300
 So governments that are really good

2:10:30.300 --> 2:10:35.060
 at fighting centralized threats to their power, right?

2:10:35.060 --> 2:10:36.700
 Whether that's a currency counterfeiter

2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:40.400
 or competing nation state or business they don't like,

2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:42.500
 or an individual they don't like,

2:10:42.500 --> 2:10:44.940
 you know, they can kill them, they can throw them in jail.

2:10:44.940 --> 2:10:46.700
 They can use any number of course

2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:49.300
 of a violent tactics to suppress it.

2:10:49.300 --> 2:10:52.600
 But how do you point a gun at an idea?

2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.580
 How do you coerce an idea?

2:10:56.580 --> 2:11:01.580
 And that's, you know, there's some anecdotal history here

2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:08.400
 where there's the PGP case, which in the United States,

2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:12.320
 the court was trying to classify it as munitions.

2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:13.920
 When we were shipping this

2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:17.920
 pretty good privacy software overseas,

2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:19.440
 government wanted to classify it as munitions

2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:21.140
 and restrict that exportation.

2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:25.320
 But, and this was a circuit court case precedent.

2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:30.000
 When the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code

2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:33.560
 on paper and presented it as evidence in the court,

2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:36.400
 all of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech

2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:40.360
 and that it's just code is speech, code is language.

2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:43.080
 And therefore, at least in the United States,

2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:45.080
 it's protected under the first amendment.

2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:52.760
 I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable,

2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:54.560
 frankly, on Bitcoin.

2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:56.920
 Being that it's pure information,

2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:00.440
 if you suppress market actors

2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:02.160
 from using it in one jurisdiction,

2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:05.860
 you're just creating incentives for them to go elsewhere.

2:12:05.860 --> 2:12:07.440
 And you're actually increasing the incentive

2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:11.320
 for other jurisdictions to be favorable towards it

2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:12.880
 because then they can create,

2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.480
 they get to benefit from the tax revenue

2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:16.400
 and the businesses and the innovation

2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:19.360
 that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result.

2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:21.920
 So you don't think if a particular central bank,

2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:25.040
 like in Europe or United States,

2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:28.440
 bans it, not maybe using those terms,

2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:30.440
 but in some kind of way,

2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:32.760
 you think that provides a really strong incentive

2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:36.320
 for the other big players to enable it.

2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:37.160
 That's right.

2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:40.640
 And that they're more likely, by the way,

2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:42.560
 and governments know this, by the way, too.

2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:46.160
 The other thing that causes a government

2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:48.320
 to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something,

2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:50.520
 they draw a lot of attention to it.

2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:51.520
 People are smart.

2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:53.920
 I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban it?

2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:55.220
 Why can't I use this?

2:12:55.220 --> 2:12:57.640
 So that's kind of typically be the last arrow

2:12:57.640 --> 2:12:58.480
 in their quiver.

2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:02.280
 They may try to ban it if Bitcoin

2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:04.080
 really starts to monetize very quickly.

2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:06.640
 And the power structures that they impose today

2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:11.640
 start to dissolve faster than others might think they will,

2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:13.440
 then they might try and ban it.

2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:16.660
 But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable.

2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:19.480
 They're more likely to tax it,

2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:21.480
 which they already do tax it.

2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:23.600
 They're likely to increase taxation of it.

2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:28.520
 They're likely to try and make it more white market

2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:32.400
 by actually tracing Bitcoin, seeing who has it,

2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:35.040
 attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership,

2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:38.280
 and making sure that they're getting their pound of flesh

2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:41.600
 on all the transactions it results in.

2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:45.760
 But I don't think, the other thing about this is,

2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:50.500
 so we saw the internet outcompete intranets,

2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.200
 in that we'd say that open source networks

2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:57.100
 tend to outcompete closed source networks.

2:13:57.100 --> 2:13:59.320
 And there's a really good reason for this.

2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:02.260
 And it's because in a closed source network,

2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:06.980
 there are costs associated with defending the network itself.

2:14:08.180 --> 2:14:12.180
 So you have to, the network owners,

2:14:12.180 --> 2:14:13.460
 the owners of the closed source network

2:14:13.460 --> 2:14:17.560
 have to expend resources protecting it from competitors.

2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:21.000
 And they have to expend resources imposing its rules

2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.220
 because they're not voluntarily adopted rules.

2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:25.380
 So you actually have to impose these rule sets.

2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:26.880
 Whereas an open source network,

2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:29.160
 which is something much more akin to capitalism

2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:33.000
 in its pure sense, these are voluntarily adopted rules.

2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:34.880
 So all market participants have agreed

2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:36.720
 and consented to this rule set.

2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:38.400
 So there's no enforcement costs

2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:39.620
 and there's no turf protection

2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:43.000
 because anyone can freely enter or exit the open network.

2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.020
 For that energetic reason,

2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:50.020
 I think open networks outcompete close networks typically.

2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:53.560
 And in the digital age, that's why I think open,

2:14:53.560 --> 2:14:55.200
 that's why internet outcompetes intranet

2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:57.240
 and that's why open source networks

2:14:57.240 --> 2:14:58.840
 are gonna eat closed source networks.

2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:01.180
 So what Bitcoin would be in that lens

2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:04.220
 is the ultimate open source monetary network

2:15:04.220 --> 2:15:08.460
 devouring closed source central bank monetary networks.

2:15:08.460 --> 2:15:13.460
 And I just don't see how there's no possibility

2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:17.560
 of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying it.

2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:21.480
 So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it.

2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:25.160
 And again, the other fallacy here

2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:26.780
 is that a lot of people tend to think of governments

2:15:26.780 --> 2:15:30.760
 as these singular indivisible entities,

2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:32.920
 like they just move under one plan.

2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:34.960
 But in reality, it's a lot of people, right?

2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.880
 A lot of people with loosely coupled interests

2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:41.880
 and agendas and whatnot, regulators and others

2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:45.640
 whether wearing their citizen hat,

2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:47.320
 they're gonna see this thing monetizing,

2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:48.640
 they're gonna be on the front lines

2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.120
 of trying to regulate it, trying to control it.

2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:53.480
 And I think what's likely to happen

2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:55.600
 is they're gonna start to adopt it,

2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:59.480
 to buy some of it even as an individual

2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:02.040
 or possibly even ultimately at a central bank

2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:03.760
 or sovereign wealth fund level,

2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:07.200
 as an insurance policy against its success.

2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:09.640
 And once you start to acquire something

2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:12.760
 and then you have a vested economic interest

2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:14.360
 in its monetization,

2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:17.560
 I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures

2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:20.520
 that are arrayed against it from the inside.

2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:22.720
 So I've written a lot about this

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.480
 in a new series called Sovereignism,

2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:26.640
 which is based loosely on a book

2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:28.760
 called The Sovereign Individual.

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.240
 And that's the general thesis

2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:34.080
 is that microprocessing technology would devour

2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:35.780
 our organizational models,

2:16:35.780 --> 2:16:38.300
 the most important of which is the nation state.

2:16:38.300 --> 2:16:39.960
 So I think we're going into this world

2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:44.420
 where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding.

2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:50.380
 The economics of violence are declining

2:16:50.380 --> 2:16:54.460
 because of the low cost of protecting property, right?

2:16:54.460 --> 2:16:59.460
 You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin

2:16:59.460 --> 2:17:01.800
 at orders of magnitude less cost

2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:04.020
 than is necessary to run a banking network.

2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:09.020
 So it changes the way we organize ourselves.

2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:12.240
 And again, zooming back to gold

2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:14.740
 as kind of the original governor to governments,

2:17:14.740 --> 2:17:16.200
 where if they manipulated the money,

2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:18.040
 gold would leave their country.

2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:23.040
 That's why governments have taken relatively concerted action

2:17:23.180 --> 2:17:25.320
 to go off of the gold standard.

2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:27.720
 There's a great book on this called The Gold Wars

2:17:27.720 --> 2:17:32.120
 that outlines how governments have been waging

2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:34.820
 a cold war against gold for the past 50 years.

2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:39.240
 Bitcoin sort of renews hope

2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:41.600
 for that free market governor of governments.

2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:42.860
 And that is this digital gold

2:17:42.860 --> 2:17:45.520
 that governments cannot stop or coopt.

2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:47.680
 So I think it's something,

2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:49.480
 that's why I think it's such a big deal

2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:54.480
 is that it is changing,

2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:56.800
 it's a new useful fiction, you might say.

2:17:56.800 --> 2:17:58.600
 A useful fiction that's superordinate

2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:02.240
 to the mythology of the nation state and government

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:04.240
 as the dominant institution in the world.

2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:05.400
 Well, I hope you're right

2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:08.920
 that all forms of centralized power

2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:12.660
 start breaking apart naturally.

2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:14.960
 So governments, the more and more power

2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:18.400
 is given to the individual, whatever the technology is.

2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:20.720
 And Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology

2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:22.880
 that empowers that, enables that.

2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:24.720
 That seems to be the trend.

2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:26.320
 And that's a promising trend

2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.120
 at least from a perspective of somebody

2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:33.400
 who values this particular biological meat bag

2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:34.800
 that's full of consciousness.

2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:37.680
 I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam

2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:40.720
 in human history, which is political authority.

2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:43.860
 Like who gives anyone the right to be politically,

2:18:43.860 --> 2:18:46.100
 have political authority over anyone else?

2:18:46.100 --> 2:18:49.040
 People should be free to adopt the rules

2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:52.040
 and systems and tools that best suit their needs.

2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:56.180
 And that arc of history we covered earlier

2:18:56.180 --> 2:19:01.180
 where as socioeconomic systems have become more favorable

2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:03.440
 towards individual sovereignty,

2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:06.120
 the more wealthy we have become,

2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:07.880
 the more we have given the individual,

2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:10.520
 we've maximized individual choice,

2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:12.440
 the more wealth that society has created

2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:14.460
 and the more it has out competed

2:19:14.460 --> 2:19:15.840
 the systems that have come before it.

2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:19.360
 The latest would be capitalism triumphing over socialism.

2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:23.920
 Before maybe we eat, you are in Texas,

2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:25.720
 you brought over some brisket.

2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:28.000
 Before we may be indulge in that,

2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000
 let me bring up one quick topic

2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:31.680
 and then we'll take a break.

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:35.720
 And the topic of what some may term

2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:37.760
 the toxicity of the Bitcoin community.

2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:43.200
 You've written that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love.

2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:46.660
 Do you wanna break that apart a little bit

2:19:46.660 --> 2:19:51.660
 sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity

2:19:51.660 --> 2:19:56.660
 that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?

2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:01.380
 Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit

2:20:01.380 --> 2:20:04.780
 before we recorded and I've been through the gauntlet

2:20:04.780 --> 2:20:06.700
 with Bitcoin toxicity as well.

2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:12.580
 I came into this space professionally in 2017.

2:20:12.940 --> 2:20:15.000
 I was originally running a multi strategy

2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:17.160
 crypto asset hedge fund.

2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:21.620
 And my initial investment thesis on the world

2:20:21.620 --> 2:20:23.260
 was that Bitcoin was a big deal,

2:20:23.260 --> 2:20:25.220
 but there were all these other exciting coins

2:20:25.220 --> 2:20:28.880
 and projects and ways the technology was going to be used.

2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:33.880
 And that view of reality met this immune,

2:20:35.420 --> 2:20:37.980
 I guess you could say as an ideological immune system,

2:20:37.980 --> 2:20:40.940
 this Bitcoin toxicity and that it's kind of a filter

2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:45.460
 that's trying to catch bad or useless

2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:50.460
 or even scamming ideas that this space is very well known for.

2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:55.180
 As we've touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion,

2:20:55.180 --> 2:20:57.940
 is this world shattering innovation,

2:20:57.940 --> 2:21:01.500
 but it's in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever, right?

2:21:01.500 --> 2:21:04.360
 People, anybody can go and create a coin.

2:21:05.460 --> 2:21:08.340
 So you can go and launch one immediately online

2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:12.860
 and you can throw up a website, an advisor page,

2:21:14.020 --> 2:21:15.060
 post a white paper talking about

2:21:15.060 --> 2:21:16.500
 how great your technology is gonna be

2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:17.640
 and how it's gonna change the world.

2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:20.240
 And then you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin

2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:22.660
 or Ethereum in 30 seconds kind of thing.

2:21:22.660 --> 2:21:27.500
 So it's drawn in a lot of this scam artistry, you might say.

2:21:27.500 --> 2:21:31.180
 And I think people living through that,

2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:33.500
 because there is this natural predilection for people

2:21:33.500 --> 2:21:35.920
 when they first come into Bitcoin, you're excited about it,

2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:39.460
 then you get lost in the shit coin universe.

2:21:39.460 --> 2:21:43.340
 And then just looking at the market success

2:21:43.340 --> 2:21:46.060
 of Bitcoin versus, and when I use the word shit coin,

2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:47.040
 I'm just.

2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:49.020
 You say with all the love in the world.

2:21:49.020 --> 2:21:50.660
 All the love in the world.

2:21:50.660 --> 2:21:53.180
 I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways,

2:21:53.180 --> 2:21:55.420
 although I consider myself a freedom maximalist,

2:21:55.420 --> 2:21:56.260
 not a Bitcoin maximalist.

2:21:56.260 --> 2:21:59.740
 Yeah, I saw that line, that's a good line.

2:21:59.740 --> 2:22:03.100
 Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin

2:22:03.100 --> 2:22:05.300
 versus alternative crypto assets,

2:22:06.300 --> 2:22:07.400
 the signal is very clear

2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:09.480
 that Bitcoin has out competed all of them.

2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:13.140
 So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved

2:22:13.140 --> 2:22:15.620
 as an immune response to those bad ideas,

2:22:15.620 --> 2:22:17.780
 which is actually, if you think about it,

2:22:17.780 --> 2:22:19.100
 kind of is a tough love, right?

2:22:19.100 --> 2:22:21.660
 You don't want new entrance to the space

2:22:21.660 --> 2:22:26.140
 to get lost in shit coin jungle and learn the hard way,

2:22:26.140 --> 2:22:28.060
 the way many Bitcoin maximalists have

2:22:28.060 --> 2:22:31.320
 that the real innovation is Bitcoin.

2:22:31.320 --> 2:22:36.320
 But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far.

2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:40.840
 And so I think it's useful when it is defending the space

2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:43.460
 from false narratives, we might say,

2:22:43.460 --> 2:22:48.180
 but it becomes detrimental when it's attacking people

2:22:48.180 --> 2:22:50.080
 that are inquiring about Bitcoin

2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:52.240
 or people that are approaching Bitcoin

2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:54.860
 with a good spirit and good intention

2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:57.420
 and a desire to learn.

2:22:57.420 --> 2:22:58.340
 Because then at that point,

2:22:58.340 --> 2:23:01.720
 it's actually impeding the free flow of ideas,

2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:04.580
 which the example in your clip

2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:06.500
 that was totally taken out of context.

2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:07.940
 And then you're literally just saying,

2:23:07.940 --> 2:23:09.240
 I'm here to learn and contribute.

2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:10.780
 I think I've got some stuff to do.

2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:11.860
 And then people attack that.

2:23:11.860 --> 2:23:13.900
 Like that doesn't make any fucking sense.

2:23:13.900 --> 2:23:16.140
 It's like you're attacking someone who's approaching it

2:23:16.140 --> 2:23:18.380
 in a good spirit and asking questions.

2:23:18.380 --> 2:23:21.480
 Yeah, and I think sometimes talking about it,

2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:25.580
 the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune response

2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:29.540
 has a negative effect of giving it a pass

2:23:30.740 --> 2:23:32.620
 because like it almost says,

2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:35.940
 look, it equates it with the human immune system,

2:23:35.940 --> 2:23:38.620
 which seems to do a really good job.

2:23:38.620 --> 2:23:42.500
 And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features

2:23:42.500 --> 2:23:47.500
 in the sea of fraudulent projects

2:23:47.780 --> 2:23:52.180
 that steal money from people.

2:23:52.180 --> 2:23:53.860
 It's really useful to make sure

2:23:53.860 --> 2:23:56.420
 that you give people the harsh truth

2:23:56.420 --> 2:23:58.540
 about who is and isn't a scammer.

2:24:00.020 --> 2:24:02.260
 You have to take it apart,

2:24:02.260 --> 2:24:04.460
 take it away from that metaphor of the immune system

2:24:04.460 --> 2:24:06.620
 and look at basic human nature.

2:24:06.620 --> 2:24:09.180
 And human nature can go to some dark places,

2:24:09.180 --> 2:24:14.180
 which is it's sad to say that some people,

2:24:15.220 --> 2:24:20.220
 maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake, the toxicity,

2:24:21.060 --> 2:24:23.300
 the mockery, the derision,

2:24:23.300 --> 2:24:27.940
 and you stop being part of the immune system

2:24:27.940 --> 2:24:31.000
 that makes a successful idea propagate

2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:35.120
 and start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself.

2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:37.740
 And that's something I think about

2:24:37.740 --> 2:24:42.740
 because I am new to this particular immune system,

2:24:43.140 --> 2:24:45.980
 but I've explored other immune systems.

2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:50.980
 And I think you understand this world much better than me,

2:24:54.820 --> 2:24:57.780
 but I tend to prefer sort of love

2:24:57.780 --> 2:25:00.340
 as a mechanism for spreading ideas,

2:25:00.340 --> 2:25:05.340
 to err on the side of love and kindness

2:25:06.220 --> 2:25:09.300
 and almost like an open mindedness

2:25:09.300 --> 2:25:13.180
 in a way where you're constantly lowering yourself

2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:16.880
 in the face of other ideas, constantly questioning yourself.

2:25:17.820 --> 2:25:22.820
 But I think I understand that that might be more applicable

2:25:24.180 --> 2:25:25.180
 in certain contexts,

2:25:25.180 --> 2:25:28.080
 like maybe in the space of science or something like that.

2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:31.260
 But in the space of Bitcoin, as it currently stands,

2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:33.980
 there's so many people that are trying to scam others

2:25:33.980 --> 2:25:35.580
 out of their money

2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:39.100
 that the kind of harshness required is different.

2:25:39.100 --> 2:25:44.100
 Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself

2:25:45.060 --> 2:25:48.180
 and others who I know you wouldn't consider yourself this,

2:25:48.180 --> 2:25:51.460
 but you're one of the faces or leaders in this space

2:25:51.460 --> 2:25:53.660
 to call people out a little bit,

2:25:53.660 --> 2:25:57.220
 to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose.

2:25:57.220 --> 2:25:58.140
 But it's difficult,

2:25:58.140 --> 2:26:00.260
 because you want to walk that line carefully.

2:26:00.260 --> 2:26:03.260
 You don't want to be too loving and open minded,

2:26:03.260 --> 2:26:04.540
 otherwise your brain falls out.

2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:06.980
 I get it, it's a difficult balance to walk.

2:26:06.980 --> 2:26:11.140
 It is subtle and it's nuanced and it is difficult to walk.

2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:14.220
 And I think that, that's why I try to say tough love,

2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:19.220
 because when we're young, we may have certain ideas

2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:21.620
 about the way we want our life to go,

2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:22.980
 but then maybe our parents

2:26:22.980 --> 2:26:25.300
 are not letting us do certain things.

2:26:25.300 --> 2:26:27.260
 And we think they're, I know when I was a kid,

2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:28.620
 I wanted to get my, when I was in fifth grade,

2:26:28.620 --> 2:26:30.220
 I wanted to get my ear pierced.

2:26:30.220 --> 2:26:31.580
 My mom wouldn't let me do it.

2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:34.460
 And I was, oh, come on, mom, I thought it was so cool.

2:26:34.460 --> 2:26:36.700
 And then two years later, I'm like, thank you, mom,

2:26:36.700 --> 2:26:38.340
 for letting me get my ear pierced.

2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:41.700
 I think it comes from a place of good intention

2:26:41.700 --> 2:26:43.400
 that they are actually,

2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:46.780
 they have asked themselves that question, right?

2:26:46.780 --> 2:26:48.660
 That they've been inquiring

2:26:48.660 --> 2:26:51.940
 in why not this crypto asset or this crypto asset?

2:26:51.940 --> 2:26:53.380
 And they've done the exploration,

2:26:53.380 --> 2:26:54.940
 they keep coming back to Bitcoin

2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:57.840
 and they've seen people being taken advantage of.

2:26:59.580 --> 2:27:03.880
 But to your point, it's like it can,

2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:06.780
 this tough love can become detrimental,

2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:08.980
 just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?

2:27:08.980 --> 2:27:12.420
 It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body.

2:27:12.420 --> 2:27:16.220
 So I would say that it's such a tricky and nuanced topic

2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:18.180
 that even biology hasn't figured it out, right?

2:27:18.180 --> 2:27:20.180
 A lot of people have autoimmune diseases.

2:27:21.980 --> 2:27:22.820
 And then there's the other thing

2:27:22.820 --> 2:27:25.780
 that we have this natural, I agree with you about love.

2:27:25.780 --> 2:27:28.660
 I think love is like the deepest value.

2:27:28.660 --> 2:27:30.540
 That's a whole nother philosophical thing,

2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:35.540
 but we're biologically programmed to pay more attention

2:27:36.260 --> 2:27:38.860
 to things that are adversarial or harmful, right?

2:27:38.860 --> 2:27:42.340
 That's part of us protecting the meat suit, so to speak.

2:27:42.340 --> 2:27:47.340
 So there is some maybe better delivery method

2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:50.980
 by being a little bit toxic to really get the point across,

2:27:50.980 --> 2:27:53.580
 like, hey, don't get lost over here.

2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:55.580
 These things can hurt you.

2:27:55.580 --> 2:27:57.140
 Really try to focus on Bitcoin.

2:27:57.140 --> 2:27:59.620
 But the toxicity of that message,

2:27:59.620 --> 2:28:01.100
 I guess it increases its ability

2:28:01.100 --> 2:28:04.140
 to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far.

2:28:04.140 --> 2:28:05.220
 So it is very...

2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:08.780
 It's interesting, but I almost to push back a little bit,

2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:11.100
 toxicity is a funny word.

2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:15.540
 I think maybe another way to say it is,

2:28:15.540 --> 2:28:17.660
 I brought up like Christopher Hitchens

2:28:17.660 --> 2:28:20.980
 and somebody who like, okay,

2:28:20.980 --> 2:28:23.660
 you might say he's toxic or something like that,

2:28:23.660 --> 2:28:27.100
 because he's basically a intellectual powerhouse

2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:28.740
 who's also a troll.

2:28:28.740 --> 2:28:31.140
 So he's constantly, it's like guerrilla warfare

2:28:31.140 --> 2:28:33.340
 in the space of ideas.

2:28:33.340 --> 2:28:37.020
 He's very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms,

2:28:37.020 --> 2:28:42.020
 but he's done with incredible grace and skill and poetry.

2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:43.180
 So...

2:28:43.180 --> 2:28:44.380
 We could use more of that.

2:28:44.380 --> 2:28:45.780
 We could use more of that.

2:28:45.780 --> 2:28:49.140
 So toxicity just like...

2:28:52.540 --> 2:28:53.540
 These are just words.

2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:55.180
 They can mean a lot of different things,

2:28:55.180 --> 2:28:59.060
 but disagreement doesn't have to be done with love,

2:28:59.940 --> 2:29:04.340
 but it should be done with skill if it's to be effective.

2:29:04.340 --> 2:29:08.300
 So there's a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare,

2:29:08.300 --> 2:29:10.180
 but you wanna learn how to shoot

2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:12.820
 or whatever the weapon you're using and to do it well.

2:29:12.820 --> 2:29:14.540
 Some people do it better than others.

2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:17.780
 And it's worthwhile to learn to do it well.

2:29:17.780 --> 2:29:20.140
 Again, I prefer love, but even love,

2:29:21.180 --> 2:29:25.420
 just because you think you're communicating a good idea,

2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:26.740
 which you very well may be,

2:29:26.740 --> 2:29:28.820
 doesn't mean it also doesn't require skill

2:29:28.820 --> 2:29:30.260
 to do the communication well,

2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:33.220
 whether it's disagreement and harsh

2:29:33.220 --> 2:29:36.860
 or more agreement and loving and so on.

2:29:36.860 --> 2:29:41.860
 Yeah, I think very fundamentally that all of our decisions,

2:29:41.860 --> 2:29:44.500
 we alluded to earlier that every decision

2:29:44.500 --> 2:29:47.100
 is an expression of value, every action we take,

2:29:47.100 --> 2:29:49.380
 they ultimately come from fear or love.

2:29:49.380 --> 2:29:53.660
 Fear would be something much more in the biological domain

2:29:53.660 --> 2:29:56.820
 where it's like, we're trying to protect ego,

2:29:56.820 --> 2:29:58.420
 we're trying to behave selfishly.

2:29:58.420 --> 2:30:00.060
 This is the domain of sin.

2:30:01.260 --> 2:30:03.700
 I don't know all the sins, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath,

2:30:03.700 --> 2:30:07.660
 lust, pride, envy, these are all selfish behaviors.

2:30:07.660 --> 2:30:09.420
 Whereas something like love,

2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:14.420
 it's morally superior in that it's more selfless.

2:30:14.420 --> 2:30:15.740
 I don't know that we can properly

2:30:15.740 --> 2:30:17.020
 define love with words at all,

2:30:17.020 --> 2:30:19.660
 but I would say maybe like selfless action

2:30:19.660 --> 2:30:22.620
 could be kind of a generalization of it.

2:30:22.620 --> 2:30:25.620
 And that way, it is really hard to your point.

2:30:25.620 --> 2:30:30.620
 It's hard to love in a world that has a lot of conflict

2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:34.500
 that might make you fearful

2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:36.060
 if you're really focused on your meat suit.

2:30:36.060 --> 2:30:37.780
 But if you're focused on the bigger picture

2:30:37.780 --> 2:30:40.900
 and you're focused on others and legacy and life,

2:30:40.900 --> 2:30:43.020
 that there is a way to do it.

2:30:43.020 --> 2:30:44.820
 And that's why I actually think Christ,

2:30:44.820 --> 2:30:46.580
 that is the highest moral aim, right?

2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:50.020
 He met all of the vitriol in life,

2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:52.540
 betrayal, hate, violence,

2:30:52.540 --> 2:30:55.700
 he met it all with love and he met it with compassion.

2:30:55.700 --> 2:30:58.220
 And that's why, regardless of if you believe

2:30:58.220 --> 2:31:00.820
 that he actually lived or any of this,

2:31:00.820 --> 2:31:05.820
 he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible.

2:31:05.820 --> 2:31:09.540
 And Carl Jung would say that that was a suitable

2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:12.340
 alternative to psychoanalysis,

2:31:12.340 --> 2:31:14.740
 was actually setting your moral aim higher

2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:16.940
 and striving towards it diligently.

2:31:16.940 --> 2:31:20.180
 So, I mean, I agree completely.

2:31:20.180 --> 2:31:22.740
 We need more of that in the Bitcoin space.

2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:24.140
 We need more of that in the world, frankly.

2:31:24.140 --> 2:31:24.980
 In the world, yeah.

2:31:24.980 --> 2:31:28.100
 And these things, they're all intertwined.

2:31:28.100 --> 2:31:32.140
 We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide,

2:31:32.140 --> 2:31:34.740
 but the world does influence what we do.

2:31:34.740 --> 2:31:37.980
 It does influence kind of if we adopt fear or love,

2:31:39.860 --> 2:31:42.100
 but it takes, I don't know, it takes good systems

2:31:42.100 --> 2:31:45.420
 and it takes, I guess, good leaders to set an example.

2:31:45.420 --> 2:31:48.860
 Yeah, I do believe that there's like individual people

2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:50.620
 can have a ripple effect.

2:31:50.620 --> 2:31:53.500
 So that's what I try to do, sort of embody the,

2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:55.060
 I'm just one ant.

2:31:55.060 --> 2:31:58.260
 But one of the things I have faith in is,

2:31:59.580 --> 2:32:02.380
 I'm trying to do that more.

2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:04.620
 I know this is a podcast,

2:32:04.620 --> 2:32:07.900
 but I'm trying to do less talking and more doing.

2:32:10.820 --> 2:32:13.260
 I've been disappointed in myself, if I'm being honest,

2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:14.980
 how much talking I've been doing,

2:32:15.980 --> 2:32:20.140
 as opposed to, like in my own private life,

2:32:20.140 --> 2:32:22.100
 I live the thing I talk about,

2:32:22.100 --> 2:32:24.660
 but I also haven't created much.

2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:30.660
 And I believe in the power of individuals that create stuff,

2:32:30.660 --> 2:32:33.460
 like create an idea through those individuals

2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:35.700
 that try to create something new, the world progresses.

2:32:35.700 --> 2:32:37.100
 And hopefully there's more and more,

2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:39.260
 more and more of those people.

2:32:39.260 --> 2:32:41.580
 So you mentioned kind of people who,

2:32:42.540 --> 2:32:45.020
 what the Bitcoin community might call scammers.

2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:50.460
 I have a lot of passions in my life

2:32:50.460 --> 2:32:52.700
 that I focus a lot of my attention to.

2:32:54.340 --> 2:32:59.340
 Bitcoin doesn't happen to be yet one of them.

2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:01.460
 Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, you know.

2:33:01.460 --> 2:33:06.460
 I'm always looking for things to really fall in love with.

2:33:08.460 --> 2:33:12.860
 So how is a person like me supposed to figure out,

2:33:13.780 --> 2:33:16.300
 I also happen to have a platform a little bit,

2:33:16.300 --> 2:33:21.300
 and how am I supposed to figure out who is interesting,

2:33:21.460 --> 2:33:25.060
 what is an interesting set of ideas and what are not?

2:33:25.060 --> 2:33:27.220
 Because people are financially tied into

2:33:27.220 --> 2:33:29.900
 a lot of the cryptocurrencies that we're talking about,

2:33:29.900 --> 2:33:33.740
 certainly with Bitcoin, you know, their livelihood,

2:33:33.740 --> 2:33:35.340
 their wellbeing is tied up to it.

2:33:35.340 --> 2:33:37.940
 So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal.

2:33:37.940 --> 2:33:41.500
 It's no longer purely an exploration of ideas.

2:33:41.500 --> 2:33:44.060
 It's really almost like a threat on your property.

2:33:44.060 --> 2:33:45.900
 Like it's a personal threat

2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:47.940
 and it makes it very difficult to explore those ideas.

2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:50.420
 So I understand that, but it makes it very difficult

2:33:50.420 --> 2:33:55.420
 for somebody like me to just walk in and be curious.

2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:59.540
 So how do I proceed in this difficult world

2:33:59.540 --> 2:34:01.020
 in exploring this landscape

2:34:02.100 --> 2:34:07.100
 and not give a platform to ideas that may harm others?

2:34:10.700 --> 2:34:14.700
 I guess first I'd like to commend your forthrightness

2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:17.180
 about this, because I don't think many people

2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:18.980
 try to walk that line necessarily.

2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:22.540
 People, again, kind of the territorial imperative,

2:34:22.540 --> 2:34:25.780
 they'll put whoever on, they'll help expand their reach.

2:34:25.780 --> 2:34:27.540
 Oh yeah, that's true.

2:34:27.540 --> 2:34:29.540
 Or say whatever needs to be said to expand their reach.

2:34:29.540 --> 2:34:31.340
 So I think you're coming from a good place.

2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:32.180
 I'll say that.

2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:36.020
 There's a great piece written

2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:38.540
 on the topic of scammers and scamming.

2:34:38.540 --> 2:34:40.140
 I think it was by Goldstein.

2:34:40.140 --> 2:34:42.460
 He wrote a piece called, Everyone's a Scammer.

2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:46.140
 And it's sort of back to this general human proclivity

2:34:46.140 --> 2:34:48.540
 to try and get something for nothing always,

2:34:48.540 --> 2:34:50.900
 which again, it can be positive,

2:34:50.900 --> 2:34:52.980
 it can be innovative, or it can be a negative.

2:34:52.980 --> 2:34:54.900
 You can be trying to steal from people.

2:34:57.900 --> 2:34:59.940
 That might be, I think that's a useful piece

2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:03.300
 just to kind of see the crypto world through that lens.

2:35:03.300 --> 2:35:06.140
 And that's how Bitcoiners are thinking all the time.

2:35:06.140 --> 2:35:08.980
 They are by nature adversarial thinkers.

2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:11.860
 So they're trying to minimize the need for trust

2:35:11.860 --> 2:35:14.700
 in any situation and maximize verification.

2:35:14.700 --> 2:35:18.860
 As far as sifting through the ideas,

2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:23.860
 I guess this is back where the cultural immune system

2:35:23.860 --> 2:35:25.900
 has some utility.

2:35:25.900 --> 2:35:28.100
 Because there were times when I thought

2:35:28.100 --> 2:35:30.700
 this particular crypto asset,

2:35:30.700 --> 2:35:32.700
 Augur was one I was really into,

2:35:32.700 --> 2:35:34.900
 that it could facilitate prediction markets

2:35:34.900 --> 2:35:38.020
 and prediction markets could make markets more efficient,

2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:39.140
 et cetera, et cetera.

2:35:39.140 --> 2:35:43.460
 But when that investment does get to the point

2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:45.940
 when that investment thesis basically met

2:35:45.940 --> 2:35:49.540
 the cultural filter or immune system,

2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:51.740
 it forced me to reevaluate my position,

2:35:51.740 --> 2:35:54.220
 forced me to really look into it more deeply.

2:35:54.220 --> 2:35:55.900
 And through that exploration,

2:35:55.900 --> 2:35:58.460
 I realized that it would need to be built on Bitcoin

2:35:58.460 --> 2:35:59.940
 to work basically.

2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:03.540
 So it really comes down to like you doing your homework,

2:36:03.540 --> 2:36:08.100
 but we can't all deeply evaluate every idea out there.

2:36:08.100 --> 2:36:11.460
 One of the things I struggle with was Alex Jones,

2:36:11.460 --> 2:36:13.740
 for example, had dinner with him.

2:36:16.420 --> 2:36:19.060
 I could tell that will be a very fun conversation,

2:36:19.060 --> 2:36:22.860
 but like then I also understand that there's

2:36:24.140 --> 2:36:27.820
 like consequences to that conversation

2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:30.700
 that should be explored with care.

2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:34.060
 And so you need to take on the responsibility

2:36:34.060 --> 2:36:35.780
 of being a chef with the puffer fish

2:36:35.780 --> 2:36:37.540
 and all those kinds of things.

2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:39.540
 That said, just like you said,

2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:42.060
 it's very difficult to know this ahead of time

2:36:43.300 --> 2:36:46.620
 and I will probably make mistakes.

2:36:46.620 --> 2:36:49.860
 And that's a shitty thing to have to live with

2:36:49.860 --> 2:36:51.260
 that I'm going to make mistakes

2:36:51.260 --> 2:36:52.900
 and some of them very large.

2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:57.540
 Like, yeah, I mean, I can imagine a bunch of different ways,

2:36:57.540 --> 2:36:59.060
 but all we can do in this world

2:36:59.060 --> 2:37:00.860
 is once we make the mistakes,

2:37:00.860 --> 2:37:04.980
 we acknowledge those mistakes and learn.

2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:09.740
 And also, I have to put this on the rest of us

2:37:09.740 --> 2:37:14.740
 that you don't take one thing that a person did

2:37:15.260 --> 2:37:17.860
 and then burn them at the stake for it.

2:37:17.860 --> 2:37:20.620
 That you realize that we all make mistakes,

2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:23.220
 that a particular mistake does not make the person.

2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:27.660
 And this applies to taking stuff out of context

2:37:27.660 --> 2:37:30.660
 over hundreds of hours of talking,

2:37:30.660 --> 2:37:35.660
 but it applies to actual, in context, big mistake.

2:37:37.380 --> 2:37:39.260
 So what if I murdered somebody at some point?

2:37:39.260 --> 2:37:40.100
 Just give me a break.

2:37:40.100 --> 2:37:42.340
 No, there are some things that are too far, of course,

2:37:42.340 --> 2:37:47.140
 but in general, we need to give each other a chance.

2:37:47.140 --> 2:37:48.560
 Yeah, but I'm still,

2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:51.980
 I walk with a heavy heart

2:37:51.980 --> 2:37:54.180
 knowing that I'll probably make a mistake,

2:37:54.180 --> 2:37:56.540
 especially one that I didn't mean to.

2:37:56.540 --> 2:37:58.340
 That's the one that worries me most.

2:37:58.340 --> 2:38:03.340
 This is human nature, like hamartia, to miss the mark.

2:38:03.940 --> 2:38:05.500
 That's the root word of sin.

2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:07.300
 We are sinful by nature.

2:38:07.300 --> 2:38:08.300
 We can't help it.

2:38:08.300 --> 2:38:11.020
 There's no way, again, pain is information, right?

2:38:11.020 --> 2:38:14.540
 There's no way to learn other than trying, failing,

2:38:15.460 --> 2:38:19.620
 learning, and then you put yourself in better formation,

2:38:19.620 --> 2:38:22.900
 right, in formation to better deal with it next time.

2:38:22.900 --> 2:38:26.340
 So I hope, I don't get the sense

2:38:26.340 --> 2:38:30.580
 that you're actually afraid of making a misstep.

2:38:30.580 --> 2:38:35.580
 I think you're just maybe disappointed's a better word.

2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:36.900
 You know you're gonna make the mistakes.

2:38:36.900 --> 2:38:39.380
 Yeah, that's exactly, that's a much, much better word.

2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:41.100
 But we have to embrace that.

2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:42.260
 That's the only way anything,

2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:43.880
 that's the only way we can advance,

2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:46.660
 is that we're dealing with an incomprehensible reality.

2:38:46.660 --> 2:38:48.460
 All we can do is throw spaghetti at the wall

2:38:48.460 --> 2:38:50.180
 and see what sticks.

2:38:50.180 --> 2:38:53.020
 And in that process, we're all inherently gonna hurt

2:38:53.020 --> 2:38:54.100
 ourselves and hurt others,

2:38:54.100 --> 2:38:57.740
 and that's where love and forgiveness come into play, right?

2:38:57.740 --> 2:39:02.540
 And yeah, I think the other thing is that this culture

2:39:02.540 --> 2:39:05.380
 of reducing people down to a label, right,

2:39:05.380 --> 2:39:07.780
 whether it's racism or whether you're calling them a scammer

2:39:07.780 --> 2:39:11.060
 or any number of terms,

2:39:11.060 --> 2:39:14.780
 you're discounting their sovereignty to zero, right?

2:39:14.780 --> 2:39:18.980
 You're taking a super complex human that is vast,

2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:21.880
 contains multitudes, is changing over time,

2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:24.460
 and you're trying to put them in a bucket of a word.

2:39:25.620 --> 2:39:28.700
 And that is just, I think, a cognitive fallacy.

2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:30.540
 Like, it's not only gonna hurt the person

2:39:30.540 --> 2:39:32.980
 that you're winnowing down to a word,

2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:34.420
 it's also gonna hurt you.

2:39:34.420 --> 2:39:38.860
 And it's gonna, in your attempt to decomplexify reality

2:39:38.860 --> 2:39:40.260
 by assigning this person to a term,

2:39:40.260 --> 2:39:42.880
 you're actually gonna create bad outcomes for yourself.

2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:45.200
 Because you're not gonna understand that person.

2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:46.900
 I do also think there's a failure

2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:50.640
 of our social media technology that incentivizes

2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:53.140
 that kind of reduction to a label.

2:39:53.140 --> 2:39:56.820
 It's just the viral nature of that reduction.

2:39:56.820 --> 2:39:59.400
 So not only do we humans naturally do that,

2:40:01.140 --> 2:40:06.080
 our social media platforms make that easier, more fun,

2:40:07.260 --> 2:40:11.340
 more effective to do that at scale, the mass hysteria.

2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:15.580
 So I think there's actually technological ways

2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:18.180
 of adding friction to that.

2:40:18.180 --> 2:40:21.220
 Yeah, I wonder, I mean, I agree with you that it's,

2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:24.920
 social media is an amplifier to our natural,

2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:27.180
 this natural way of dealing with one another.

2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:30.500
 But I wonder, and my thinking has evolved a lot on this,

2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:32.380
 that there's something below

2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:35.100
 the way we're treating each other too, right?

2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:37.800
 We could say civilization sort of advances

2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:40.100
 in the tools we make and the way we treat each other.

2:40:40.100 --> 2:40:42.780
 We tend to have better tools, better quality of life,

2:40:42.780 --> 2:40:46.260
 and better morality, better quality of living,

2:40:46.260 --> 2:40:49.180
 and ways of dealing with one another.

2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:53.540
 And I think that when you corrupt the money,

2:40:53.540 --> 2:40:56.580
 that it really does push us the negative direction,

2:40:56.580 --> 2:41:01.580
 pushes us away from, again, encouraging,

2:41:02.300 --> 2:41:05.580
 or magnifying scarcity artificially

2:41:05.580 --> 2:41:07.480
 causes us to be more divisive.

2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:08.660
 When things are more divisive,

2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:11.620
 we tend to be less civilized, less nuanced,

2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:14.480
 more black or white, or this or that,

2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:17.980
 or you're this, or you're label A or label B.

2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:20.620
 So I really think, and this is a harder one to unravel,

2:41:20.620 --> 2:41:24.020
 but I think if we can fix the money, right,

2:41:24.020 --> 2:41:26.900
 which again is the base layer operating system

2:41:26.900 --> 2:41:29.240
 for human moral action in the world,

2:41:30.220 --> 2:41:32.580
 that it has downstream effects.

2:41:32.580 --> 2:41:34.440
 So we'd actually maybe start to treat each other

2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:36.320
 a little better on social media,

2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:41.180
 despite the fact that it enables this faster communication.

2:41:41.180 --> 2:41:44.540
 That's interesting, so perhaps fixing social media

2:41:44.540 --> 2:41:48.500
 as I've been thinking about is treating the symptom,

2:41:48.500 --> 2:41:49.620
 not the cause.

2:41:49.620 --> 2:41:52.840
 Yeah, that is the Bitcoin rabbit hole in a nutshell,

2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:54.980
 is that they say fix the money, fix the world.

2:41:54.980 --> 2:41:58.780
 You keep tracing these different social malaises

2:41:58.780 --> 2:42:03.780
 or technological difficulties, lack of innovation.

2:42:03.820 --> 2:42:06.140
 Weinstein's entire Portal podcast,

2:42:06.140 --> 2:42:08.540
 something went wrong in the early 70s.

2:42:08.540 --> 2:42:11.220
 We went off the gold standard in 1971,

2:42:11.220 --> 2:42:15.980
 and there's a great website, wtfhappat1971.com,

2:42:15.980 --> 2:42:18.400
 goes through this whole gamut of socioeconomic data

2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.860
 that's completely gone askew since the early 70s.

2:42:22.860 --> 2:42:24.540
 Yeah, you had this whole video,

2:42:24.540 --> 2:42:28.500
 what do you think about Eric Weinstein and Bitcoin

2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:31.620
 and the gold standard?

2:42:31.620 --> 2:42:35.600
 Does he, I actually haven't heard him talk about his thesis

2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:39.620
 about the 70s in connection to the,

2:42:39.620 --> 2:42:42.060
 going off of the gold standard.

2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:43.540
 Yeah, what are your thoughts there?

2:42:43.540 --> 2:42:46.060
 What are your thoughts about his general relationship

2:42:46.060 --> 2:42:49.740
 with the Bitcoin idea and the community?

2:42:49.740 --> 2:42:52.940
 Yeah, the first exposure I had to Eric was his,

2:42:52.940 --> 2:42:55.420
 I think it was his first episode with Peter Thiel,

2:42:55.420 --> 2:42:57.100
 and they're going through that thesis

2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:00.980
 that there's been this general institutional rot

2:43:00.980 --> 2:43:03.900
 and suppression of innovation since the early 70s,

2:43:03.900 --> 2:43:05.980
 and he's trying to identify what it is.

2:43:05.980 --> 2:43:08.100
 I don't think they ever pended on the money

2:43:09.300 --> 2:43:11.260
 on going off the gold standard,

2:43:11.260 --> 2:43:14.580
 but in recent interactions with Eric,

2:43:14.580 --> 2:43:16.640
 I've interacted with him on Clubhouse.

2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:19.920
 We recently released an episode of the show

2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:22.060
 I did with Chris Espley,

2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:24.260
 and it was titled Dear Eric Weinstein.

2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:26.760
 So we're going through his worldview

2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:27.980
 that he's expressed in the portal

2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:31.780
 and tying it back to the money in different ways.

2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:33.300
 And he's been, he's engaged.

2:43:33.300 --> 2:43:35.180
 Eric retweeted the show.

2:43:35.180 --> 2:43:36.720
 We've exchanged some messages.

2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:38.340
 He's been very open minded.

2:43:38.340 --> 2:43:40.420
 He's asked some really good questions.

2:43:40.420 --> 2:43:42.060
 So I get the sense that he's approaching

2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:45.940
 this very wholeheartedly.

2:43:45.940 --> 2:43:48.900
 He does bring with him his existing worldview

2:43:48.900 --> 2:43:50.260
 and his existing theory.

2:43:50.260 --> 2:43:52.140
 The one that really blew up was gauge theory.

2:43:52.140 --> 2:43:53.300
 They got really popular.

2:43:53.300 --> 2:43:54.820
 I don't know a lot about gauge theory.

2:43:54.820 --> 2:43:56.680
 I actually messaged Eric and said,

2:43:56.680 --> 2:43:58.100
 I want to learn more genuinely,

2:43:58.100 --> 2:44:01.280
 because he seems to be serious

2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:03.980
 that that needs to be considered in the sphere of money.

2:44:03.980 --> 2:44:05.780
 And so I want to learn more about it.

2:44:06.780 --> 2:44:08.220
 But I think overall it's great.

2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:10.860
 It's great to see an intellectual heavyweight

2:44:10.860 --> 2:44:13.700
 of his caliber gravitating towards Bitcoin.

2:44:14.700 --> 2:44:18.980
 Yeah, he has some gauge theoretic conceptions

2:44:18.980 --> 2:44:23.900
 about the world broadly, but also about economics,

2:44:23.900 --> 2:44:27.140
 which ultimately boils down to just a set of mathematics,

2:44:27.140 --> 2:44:30.740
 which allows you to more effectively reason about the world.

2:44:30.740 --> 2:44:32.740
 And he has a certain set of views there.

2:44:33.700 --> 2:44:37.140
 So it's fascinating to see him grapple with it.

2:44:37.140 --> 2:44:42.140
 I think he's also kind of actually kind of like all of us,

2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:45.800
 grappling with the idea of what is Bitcoin in this world.

2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:47.700
 It's a very young technology,

2:44:47.700 --> 2:44:52.700
 and it's unclear exactly how the ideas of the past

2:44:52.860 --> 2:44:57.480
 fit with it and integrate, how the two integrate together.

2:44:57.480 --> 2:44:59.900
 And so it's interesting to explore,

2:44:59.900 --> 2:45:01.460
 not just Bitcoin in the particular.

2:45:01.460 --> 2:45:06.460
 So for me, like what I've always saw Bitcoin as

2:45:06.820 --> 2:45:11.060
 from the beginning, from a narrow worldview

2:45:11.060 --> 2:45:14.500
 is computer science, which is where I come from.

2:45:14.500 --> 2:45:16.740
 And so I wasn't almost aware

2:45:16.740 --> 2:45:21.660
 in the social, political, financial aspects of Bitcoin.

2:45:21.660 --> 2:45:26.440
 But now I see that there's not just power,

2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:29.900
 but there's fascinating ideas to explore on that side

2:45:29.900 --> 2:45:31.500
 of things, not just the computer science,

2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:33.820
 not just the technical details,

2:45:33.820 --> 2:45:38.820
 but the political, the socioeconomic, the philosophical.

2:45:39.580 --> 2:45:43.000
 That's where I find all the fascination in the world,

2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:43.840
 frankly.

2:45:45.180 --> 2:45:49.500
 One other thing about Weinstein and intellectuals

2:45:49.500 --> 2:45:52.340
 more generally that are skeptical of Bitcoin,

2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:54.340
 I would challenge them to read the book,

2:45:54.340 --> 2:45:57.500
 Human Action, written by Mises.

2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:00.280
 I think in 1949, he published the English version.

2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:04.820
 It's essentially the Bible of Austrian economics.

2:46:04.820 --> 2:46:09.620
 And I think Austrian economics is a noticeable gap

2:46:09.620 --> 2:46:13.760
 in most modern intellectuals worldviews,

2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:15.240
 that it's not taught in school.

2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:17.540
 I mean, I have a master's degree in accounting and finance,

2:46:17.540 --> 2:46:19.260
 studied a lot of economics in school.

2:46:19.260 --> 2:46:21.340
 There's not one peep of Austrian econ.

2:46:21.340 --> 2:46:26.340
 The least we'd love talking about all the degrees he has.

2:46:26.500 --> 2:46:27.860
 I was a CPA.

2:46:27.860 --> 2:46:32.860
 But that curriculum that we get in college

2:46:35.540 --> 2:46:38.660
 is noticeably deficient in Austrian economics.

2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.100
 And I think there's a reason why, right?

2:46:40.100 --> 2:46:43.280
 It's heavily government influenced.

2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:46.640
 Again, master's degree in accounting,

2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:48.680
 they never taught me about what money is

2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:49.980
 or where money comes from.

2:46:49.980 --> 2:46:53.820
 All you learn is that the central bank issues money

2:46:53.820 --> 2:46:55.980
 and the central bank takes money away.

2:46:55.980 --> 2:46:58.780
 So it's conceived of in the textbooks

2:46:58.780 --> 2:47:00.580
 quite literally as God, right?

2:47:00.580 --> 2:47:03.720
 An entity that suffers no opportunity costs,

2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:06.780
 that basically is the foundation

2:47:06.780 --> 2:47:09.100
 of the entire Keynesian worldview

2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:10.900
 that you're taught in economics.

2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:14.740
 And Austrian economics is the opposite

2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:16.060
 end of the spectrum of that, right?

2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:18.420
 It's actually the culmination,

2:47:18.420 --> 2:47:20.740
 which economics is the youngest science in the world,

2:47:20.740 --> 2:47:21.580
 by the way.

2:47:21.580 --> 2:47:24.960
 So it is kind of the front,

2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:27.000
 it's the frontiers of science in many ways,

2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.500
 like to actually, when I say praxeology,

2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:31.300
 many people have never even heard of that.

2:47:31.300 --> 2:47:35.860
 But it's something, it's an a priori study

2:47:35.860 --> 2:47:37.360
 equivalent to something like mathematics,

2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:39.560
 that you're building things from first principles

2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:42.400
 to reason about economic reality.

2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:46.380
 And I think that book, it's a very difficult book

2:47:46.380 --> 2:47:49.780
 written by Mises, 1200 pages, translated from German.

2:47:49.780 --> 2:47:52.180
 The way he wields English is fascinating

2:47:52.180 --> 2:47:53.980
 and terrifying all at the same time.

2:47:54.900 --> 2:47:56.540
 It'd probably take you six months to read it

2:47:56.540 --> 2:47:58.100
 if you read it daily, seriously.

2:47:58.100 --> 2:48:00.460
 Like it's a beast of a book.

2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:04.380
 But that will plug the gap, I think in most,

2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:06.140
 any intellectual that's skeptical about Bitcoin,

2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:08.000
 I think that will plug the gap that's necessary

2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.340
 for you to see it in a new light.

2:48:10.340 --> 2:48:12.620
 Well, I'll take that as a challenge.

2:48:12.620 --> 2:48:14.460
 Now that we took a little bit of a break,

2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:16.480
 ate some good Texas brisket, thank you for that,

2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:17.700
 by the way, for passing over.

2:48:17.700 --> 2:48:18.900
 Quite welcome.

2:48:18.900 --> 2:48:21.560
 Let me ask the ridiculous question.

2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:24.180
 At the core of the idea of Bitcoin,

2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:28.360
 is this guy or this entity named Satoshi Nakamoto?

2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:32.220
 So the ridiculous question is, who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:33.780
 And first of all, is it you?

2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:35.960
 It's not me.

2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:38.260
 I wish.

2:48:38.260 --> 2:48:41.780
 And is this an interesting question?

2:48:41.780 --> 2:48:43.460
 Or is it just something about our human nature

2:48:43.460 --> 2:48:47.140
 that wants to, that always tends towards mystery?

2:48:47.140 --> 2:48:50.620
 Well, as we've touched on a bit today,

2:48:51.620 --> 2:48:53.820
 you know, mythology, in my opinion,

2:48:53.820 --> 2:48:57.380
 is something that is intrinsic to how we see the world

2:48:57.380 --> 2:48:58.220
 in a lot of ways.

2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:00.780
 Like it's how, it's kind of the structure

2:49:02.240 --> 2:49:04.440
 by which we build these useful fictions.

2:49:05.460 --> 2:49:08.260
 And so in that way, you could just say that

2:49:08.260 --> 2:49:11.840
 Satoshi is the godhead of Bitcoin, effectively.

2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:15.560
 And I think a compelling argument could be made

2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:18.020
 that his disappearance is what really solidifies

2:49:18.020 --> 2:49:20.140
 Bitcoin's decentralization.

2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:25.140
 Because if there were one individual to personally vilify

2:49:25.460 --> 2:49:30.380
 or denigrate or attack, you know, to disparage

2:49:30.380 --> 2:49:33.560
 or question the motives of, you know,

2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:37.780
 if he's out on the Hollywood Hills partying,

2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:40.500
 everyone knows he's got a million Bitcoin, you know,

2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:43.500
 it would just kind of tarnish the entire project

2:49:43.500 --> 2:49:44.340
 in a lot of ways.

2:49:44.340 --> 2:49:48.100
 But the fact that on that theme, something for nothing,

2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:51.140
 this guy actually gave humanity something for nothing.

2:49:51.140 --> 2:49:56.140
 And it appears that he didn't profit in any way.

2:49:56.780 --> 2:49:58.220
 He, she, or they.

2:49:59.420 --> 2:50:01.820
 I actually heard recently that he identified as a he

2:50:01.820 --> 2:50:03.100
 in some of his communications.

2:50:03.100 --> 2:50:04.700
 So it sounds like it is a he.

2:50:04.700 --> 2:50:09.700
 So like his communication is being like studied,

2:50:11.060 --> 2:50:14.460
 like almost like exactly as if he is a religious.

2:50:14.460 --> 2:50:15.580
 That's right.

2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:16.620
 Like a prophet.

2:50:18.420 --> 2:50:23.420
 It's fascinating to imagine that he's still alive

2:50:24.420 --> 2:50:27.260
 and living in this world.

2:50:27.260 --> 2:50:29.140
 And it's even more fascinating to imagine

2:50:29.140 --> 2:50:32.220
 that he's perhaps participating in the Bitcoin community

2:50:32.220 --> 2:50:36.780
 because I mean, that takes a special human being

2:50:36.780 --> 2:50:41.420
 to out of principle do that, to do, to remain anonymous.

2:50:41.420 --> 2:50:43.460
 That's very much the George Washington.

2:50:43.460 --> 2:50:46.480
 Yeah, I always wonder like how many people are like that?

2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:48.900
 There's a cliche that like absolute power corrupts,

2:50:48.900 --> 2:50:51.380
 absolutely, like power corrupts.

2:50:51.380 --> 2:50:55.000
 But it seems like the progress of humanity depends

2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.900
 on the people whom power doesn't corrupt.

2:50:57.900 --> 2:51:02.760
 And it's enough to have just a small selection of those.

2:51:04.340 --> 2:51:09.340
 And even if most of us are too weak, we give into power.

2:51:09.500 --> 2:51:14.020
 If given the chance, all it takes is a few.

2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:15.540
 That's, I've never thought of it like that,

2:51:15.540 --> 2:51:18.300
 but Marcus Aurelius immediately came to mind.

2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:21.780
 You know, the guy that he had the keys to the kingdom

2:51:21.780 --> 2:51:26.300
 and he apparently adhered to the stoic virtues

2:51:26.300 --> 2:51:30.140
 until the end, but yeah, I agree with Satoshi.

2:51:30.140 --> 2:51:35.140
 The other thing that's interesting is he would be by far

2:51:35.500 --> 2:51:39.980
 the most wealthy person in the world on a liquid asset basis

2:51:39.980 --> 2:51:42.220
 because he has a million Bitcoin,

2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:47.220
 which is 60 billion liquid net worth at current prices.

2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:51.620
 So if he is still alive and just operating in the world,

2:51:51.620 --> 2:51:56.180
 he is daily and moment to moment resisting massive

2:51:56.180 --> 2:52:01.180
 incentives to go and just be the richest guy in the world.

2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:02.740
 He's the ultimate hodler.

2:52:02.740 --> 2:52:03.580
 Yeah.

2:52:03.580 --> 2:52:05.020
 Yeah.

2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:07.740
 I mean, so it's, I mean, it's turning down

2:52:07.740 --> 2:52:12.300
 not just financial success, but also fame.

2:52:12.300 --> 2:52:14.140
 I mean, fame is another drug.

2:52:14.140 --> 2:52:17.340
 It's kind of power, but it's in itself is also a drug,

2:52:17.340 --> 2:52:20.540
 especially in this modern society, in this attention.

2:52:20.540 --> 2:52:21.660
 And he would have both.

2:52:21.660 --> 2:52:22.900
 He would have both.

2:52:22.900 --> 2:52:25.780
 It's fun to imagine who it could be.

2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:27.900
 It's fascinating if it's somebody like you

2:52:27.900 --> 2:52:30.580
 or somebody like Elon or somebody like that.

2:52:30.580 --> 2:52:31.900
 That's fascinating to think about.

2:52:31.900 --> 2:52:34.620
 I think Elon would be hilarious if he came out

2:52:34.620 --> 2:52:36.860
 and he was Satoshi and be like,

2:52:36.860 --> 2:52:38.900
 hey guys, I know I'm already the richest guy in the world,

2:52:38.900 --> 2:52:41.460
 but I gotta go ahead and double my lead here.

2:52:42.460 --> 2:52:46.420
 What do you make of Elon Musk investing with Tesla,

2:52:46.420 --> 2:52:50.380
 investing in Bitcoin and maybe broaden it out

2:52:50.380 --> 2:52:54.660
 in some of these other, you know,

2:52:54.660 --> 2:52:57.980
 big billionaires, but also people tied to major companies

2:52:57.980 --> 2:52:59.900
 investing in Bitcoin?

2:52:59.900 --> 2:53:04.020
 Yeah, I think Michael Saylor really led the charge on that.

2:53:04.900 --> 2:53:06.460
 He's the CEO of MicroStrategy

2:53:06.460 --> 2:53:09.220
 that I think they've acquired upwards

2:53:09.220 --> 2:53:11.020
 of $2 billion in Bitcoin now.

2:53:11.020 --> 2:53:14.780
 Started acquiring August, maybe of 2020.

2:53:15.940 --> 2:53:19.020
 And he's, you know, personally bought a lot of it.

2:53:19.020 --> 2:53:22.500
 He bought a lot as a treasury reserve asset

2:53:22.500 --> 2:53:24.140
 for his company, MicroStrategy.

2:53:24.140 --> 2:53:27.460
 Then they leveraged up on a convertible note

2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:28.300
 and bought more.

2:53:28.300 --> 2:53:32.340
 So he's really gone, really leading the charge

2:53:32.340 --> 2:53:35.940
 in this Bitcoin institutional adoption.

2:53:35.940 --> 2:53:38.100
 Your conversation with him is a really interesting one.

2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:41.780
 Your series of, I mean, series of episodes I suppose,

2:53:41.780 --> 2:53:44.220
 but it's only a couple of conversations, I guess.

2:53:44.220 --> 2:53:48.180
 Yeah, we recorded twice, five and a half hours each.

2:53:48.180 --> 2:53:50.140
 So it's about 11 hours of content.

2:53:50.140 --> 2:53:50.980
 Yeah, thank you.

2:53:50.980 --> 2:53:55.140
 A lot of people have said that it's the best

2:53:55.140 --> 2:53:57.300
 first principle thing they've ever seen on Bitcoin,

2:53:57.300 --> 2:53:59.300
 which I take no credit for that at all.

2:53:59.300 --> 2:54:02.540
 I mean, I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him.

2:54:02.540 --> 2:54:04.020
 He's just a beast.

2:54:04.020 --> 2:54:09.020
 Yeah, but it's fascinating that his longterm vision with it.

2:54:11.300 --> 2:54:15.500
 I mean, I'm not sure I'm all philosophically bought in,

2:54:15.500 --> 2:54:20.500
 but if he's right, if this set of ideas are as powerful

2:54:20.500 --> 2:54:24.140
 as he describes, as you described,

2:54:24.140 --> 2:54:26.700
 that this would change the world,

2:54:26.700 --> 2:54:28.700
 which as you say, it's funny that a company

2:54:28.700 --> 2:54:33.700
 like MicroStrategy might be the company

2:54:34.540 --> 2:54:38.060
 that has the biggest macro effect

2:54:38.060 --> 2:54:40.180
 on our economy and our world.

2:54:40.180 --> 2:54:44.420
 Yeah, the conversation reshaped my worldview a lot too,

2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:48.100
 because he framed money as energy,

2:54:48.100 --> 2:54:50.940
 which I had often thought of money as time.

2:54:50.940 --> 2:54:53.460
 And it explored those connections a lot in my writing,

2:54:53.460 --> 2:54:57.300
 but looking at it as energy, and then his supposition

2:54:57.300 --> 2:55:01.980
 that the purpose of life is to basically channel energy

2:55:01.980 --> 2:55:03.140
 across space and time.

2:55:03.140 --> 2:55:05.100
 So we're just trying to figure out how to channel

2:55:05.100 --> 2:55:07.100
 more energy across space and time

2:55:07.100 --> 2:55:08.860
 toward the satisfaction of aims.

2:55:09.940 --> 2:55:12.660
 And his definition, or his answer to that question,

2:55:12.660 --> 2:55:15.300
 what is money, is that money is the highest form of energy

2:55:15.300 --> 2:55:17.140
 a human being can channel.

2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:19.420
 So it's a claim to all other forms of energy

2:55:19.420 --> 2:55:20.780
 we can manifest in the world.

2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:24.900
 And that just completely reshaped how I see it,

2:55:24.900 --> 2:55:26.300
 brought in this whole other side

2:55:26.300 --> 2:55:30.820
 to my intellectual explorations of money.

2:55:30.820 --> 2:55:32.180
 Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:34.300
 So I understand money is time,

2:55:34.300 --> 2:55:37.100
 which in itself is a really powerful idea.

2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:39.740
 But money is energy, and channeling energy,

2:55:39.740 --> 2:55:40.700
 can you break that apart?

2:55:40.700 --> 2:55:44.980
 Yeah, so I guess I definitely have to check out

2:55:44.980 --> 2:55:46.980
 the whole series to really get his perspective,

2:55:46.980 --> 2:55:49.420
 but I'll do my best to condense it.

2:55:51.300 --> 2:55:54.980
 Life itself, all forms of life are,

2:55:54.980 --> 2:55:56.500
 they're dependent on energy, right?

2:55:56.500 --> 2:56:00.500
 Energy fuels everything, fuels life in action and motion

2:56:00.500 --> 2:56:01.340
 and all of that.

2:56:02.340 --> 2:56:04.820
 And we could say that maybe like a plant

2:56:06.180 --> 2:56:08.980
 is harnessing solar energy

2:56:08.980 --> 2:56:11.820
 and then reallocating that into growth.

2:56:11.820 --> 2:56:15.220
 So its aim is to grow towards the sun, right?

2:56:15.220 --> 2:56:17.620
 So it's allocating energy towards its goal

2:56:17.620 --> 2:56:20.740
 of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing.

2:56:20.740 --> 2:56:25.740
 So, and humans too have evolved

2:56:27.220 --> 2:56:30.580
 to figure out how to harness energy in different ways

2:56:30.580 --> 2:56:35.180
 to satisfy higher and more complicated aims.

2:56:35.180 --> 2:56:37.540
 So the original energy network

2:56:38.700 --> 2:56:41.220
 that he referenced was fire, right?

2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:45.740
 We actually learned to wield fire as a tool in and of itself.

2:56:45.740 --> 2:56:48.140
 So not only are we learning to channel energy,

2:56:48.140 --> 2:56:51.380
 but we're actually learning how to isolate energy

2:56:51.380 --> 2:56:53.820
 as a tool in and of itself.

2:56:53.820 --> 2:56:55.020
 And so we went into that,

2:56:55.020 --> 2:56:59.700
 how harnessing fire had changed human beings.

2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:04.140
 And actually, this is one of the earliest examples too

2:57:04.140 --> 2:57:07.660
 of a coevolution between tool and our biology,

2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:11.580
 because when we developed fire, we developed cooking.

2:57:11.580 --> 2:57:13.180
 And cooking is, you can kind of think of it

2:57:13.180 --> 2:57:14.540
 as pre digestion in a way.

2:57:14.540 --> 2:57:16.300
 We're liberating these macronutrients

2:57:16.300 --> 2:57:18.420
 or making things that otherwise

2:57:18.420 --> 2:57:21.020
 would not be digestible, edible.

2:57:22.020 --> 2:57:23.340
 And it increases the efficiency

2:57:23.340 --> 2:57:26.220
 by which we extract nutrients from food.

2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:27.540
 That's what cooking does.

2:57:27.540 --> 2:57:29.900
 So when we figured out cooking,

2:57:29.900 --> 2:57:33.660
 we liberated all these digestive resources

2:57:33.660 --> 2:57:36.660
 that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development.

2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:39.620
 So there's this evolutionary path

2:57:39.620 --> 2:57:42.820
 between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter,

2:57:42.820 --> 2:57:44.060
 which is interesting.

2:57:45.900 --> 2:57:47.740
 Some other early examples he gave,

2:57:47.740 --> 2:57:50.340
 he went into were missiles and hydraulics.

2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:56.660
 So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance.

2:57:56.660 --> 2:57:58.900
 We can't bring down a wooly mammoth,

2:57:58.900 --> 2:58:03.900
 maybe with spears and up close and personal force,

2:58:03.900 --> 2:58:07.500
 but we could with spears and javelins and slings and whatnot.

2:58:07.500 --> 2:58:11.500
 And then he went into how we've used water

2:58:11.500 --> 2:58:12.900
 to channel hydraulic energy.

2:58:12.900 --> 2:58:14.540
 So we can basically overcome gravity.

2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:19.540
 We can move, there's theories that the pyramids

2:58:19.940 --> 2:58:22.300
 were constructed using, the blocks were moved

2:58:22.300 --> 2:58:25.220
 using hydraulic energy or using water.

2:58:25.220 --> 2:58:27.660
 Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot

2:58:27.660 --> 2:58:29.900
 to move things much more efficiently across water

2:58:29.900 --> 2:58:32.140
 than we could the land.

2:58:32.140 --> 2:58:37.140
 So his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways

2:58:37.300 --> 2:58:40.300
 and more efficient ways to harness energy and channel it.

2:58:40.300 --> 2:58:45.300
 And in that perspective, money has always represented

2:58:46.580 --> 2:58:48.740
 a claim on all other forms of energy.

2:58:48.740 --> 2:58:51.660
 So whatever energy couldn't be channeled

2:58:51.660 --> 2:58:54.580
 towards something useful in the economy historically

2:58:54.580 --> 2:58:55.980
 would go into gold mining.

2:58:55.980 --> 2:58:59.340
 So gold became this residual, this economic,

2:58:59.340 --> 2:59:03.860
 this token of the excess energy created

2:59:03.860 --> 2:59:05.300
 by the market economy.

2:59:05.300 --> 2:59:07.220
 And then you could take that token of energy

2:59:07.220 --> 2:59:10.420
 and use it to redeem for any other form of energy

2:59:10.420 --> 2:59:13.340
 or any of the products of energy itself.

2:59:13.340 --> 2:59:17.820
 So it's, I guess it's my best approximation of it.

2:59:17.820 --> 2:59:22.060
 And it just really shattered my worldview again,

2:59:22.060 --> 2:59:23.540
 because I'd always thought about it as time.

2:59:23.540 --> 2:59:26.380
 Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money

2:59:26.380 --> 2:59:28.420
 that we then redeem for commencement sacrifices

2:59:28.420 --> 2:59:32.420
 from others, but I'd never considered it purely as energy.

2:59:32.420 --> 2:59:34.340
 And then it also ties back into gold,

2:59:35.260 --> 2:59:38.940
 where there was an energy expenditure necessary

2:59:38.940 --> 2:59:40.260
 to obtain gold.

2:59:40.260 --> 2:59:43.700
 So there's a proof of work associated with obtaining gold

2:59:43.700 --> 2:59:46.100
 that protected its market value, right?

2:59:46.100 --> 2:59:47.780
 So you had to expend, again,

2:59:47.780 --> 2:59:50.220
 if market value of gold's 2000 an ounce,

2:59:50.220 --> 2:59:53.180
 you had to expend 1900 an ounce mining.

2:59:53.180 --> 2:59:56.580
 So it kept producers honest in a way.

2:59:56.580 --> 2:59:58.980
 So do you think something like proof of stake

2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:01.940
 that's more about reputation

3:00:01.940 --> 3:00:06.940
 than actual exertion, like energy can work?

3:00:10.180 --> 3:00:13.660
 No, I think proof of stake is inherently centralizing.

3:00:15.460 --> 3:00:18.380
 It's like the old Matthew principle,

3:00:18.380 --> 3:00:20.900
 from those who have to those who have,

3:00:20.900 --> 3:00:22.900
 more will be given from those who have not,

3:00:22.900 --> 3:00:24.100
 everything will be taken.

3:00:24.100 --> 3:00:26.420
 That's what proof of stake is.

3:00:26.420 --> 3:00:29.860
 You need proof of work to embody skin in the game

3:00:29.860 --> 3:00:33.580
 in the marketplace, such that contributions

3:00:33.580 --> 3:00:36.420
 are commensurate with consideration received.

3:00:36.420 --> 3:00:37.900
 That's how systems work.

3:00:39.420 --> 3:00:42.820
 What's the idea why proof of work might

3:00:44.900 --> 3:00:46.980
 incentivize decentralization?

3:00:49.620 --> 3:00:53.220
 Do you worry that as Bitcoin becomes more powerful,

3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:56.820
 it may become, again, more centralized?

3:00:56.820 --> 3:00:59.580
 Well, the decentralization of Bitcoin

3:01:00.980 --> 3:01:03.780
 is largely driven by the nodes, actually,

3:01:03.780 --> 3:01:05.300
 which aren't actually mining.

3:01:05.300 --> 3:01:07.780
 They're just choosing which rule set to implement.

3:01:10.660 --> 3:01:12.140
 And then the mining network's

3:01:12.140 --> 3:01:14.580
 actually enforcing that rule set.

3:01:14.580 --> 3:01:17.660
 So I think the mining network

3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:22.140
 is inherently decentralized in that,

3:01:22.140 --> 3:01:24.540
 really anyone with access to cheap energy

3:01:24.540 --> 3:01:25.580
 can become a miner.

3:01:25.580 --> 3:01:27.860
 You can freely enter or exit the market

3:01:27.860 --> 3:01:29.300
 or the network at any time.

3:01:30.860 --> 3:01:34.780
 But maintaining the block size at a manageable level

3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:38.020
 is what's key to maintaining node decentralization.

3:01:38.020 --> 3:01:39.580
 This is an interesting question.

3:01:40.540 --> 3:01:43.300
 Who do you think has more power, the miners or the nodes?

3:01:44.340 --> 3:01:49.340
 Because the nodes carry the idea of the protocol,

3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:52.340
 like the specifics.

3:01:52.340 --> 3:01:55.140
 So in some sense, they have more power,

3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:56.700
 if Bitcoin is an idea.

3:01:58.340 --> 3:02:00.500
 They're kind of mutually indispensable though,

3:02:00.500 --> 3:02:01.740
 because you can't have,

3:02:03.580 --> 3:02:05.740
 there's no security without the miners.

3:02:05.740 --> 3:02:08.260
 So without the miners, Bitcoin is just an idea.

3:02:08.260 --> 3:02:11.980
 And the idea of Bitcoin has maybe existed

3:02:11.980 --> 3:02:13.060
 even before Bitcoin, right?

3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:13.900
 Just sound money.

3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:15.660
 We just say sound money as an idea.

3:02:15.660 --> 3:02:19.620
 But there was no way to root that into thermodynamic reality

3:02:19.620 --> 3:02:24.060
 without Satoshi figuring out, not just proof of work,

3:02:24.060 --> 3:02:27.340
 it's the entire composite of the difficulty adjustment,

3:02:27.340 --> 3:02:31.700
 proof of work, one way hashing, et cetera.

3:02:31.700 --> 3:02:34.020
 So I don't know, that's hard to say,

3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:35.420
 hard to disentangle the two.

3:02:36.340 --> 3:02:39.140
 You've talked about money as morality too.

3:02:40.460 --> 3:02:43.540
 How do you think about moral and immoral action

3:02:43.540 --> 3:02:45.780
 in the context of money?

3:02:47.340 --> 3:02:51.020
 There's this great quote by Rothbard,

3:02:51.020 --> 3:02:53.740
 who's a famous Austrian economist.

3:02:53.740 --> 3:02:57.780
 And he says, quote, to be moral, an act must be free,

3:02:58.900 --> 3:02:59.740
 unquote.

3:03:00.860 --> 3:03:05.860
 And I think morality, it changes over time

3:03:07.900 --> 3:03:12.220
 and it is, it has its roots

3:03:12.220 --> 3:03:14.420
 in biology.

3:03:15.700 --> 3:03:17.540
 Jordan Peterson makes the point that even animals

3:03:17.540 --> 3:03:21.100
 have their own sort of pseudo morality.

3:03:21.100 --> 3:03:24.420
 Where like with wolf packs, for instance,

3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:26.900
 if there's a dispute between the alpha males,

3:03:26.900 --> 3:03:30.780
 or I guess between an alpha male and a incumbent,

3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:35.460
 the two males will have a fight basically.

3:03:35.460 --> 3:03:39.420
 And then when one, it's decided that one has won,

3:03:39.420 --> 3:03:42.020
 the loser will basically roll over and give up his neck

3:03:42.020 --> 3:03:44.940
 to the alpha male.

3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:47.780
 And they do this instead of fighting to the death

3:03:47.780 --> 3:03:50.980
 because in a wolf pack, they need every wolf

3:03:50.980 --> 3:03:52.780
 so they can go out and bring down,

3:03:52.780 --> 3:03:54.900
 you never know when you're gonna need the 20th wolf

3:03:54.900 --> 3:03:56.980
 to bring down the big buffalo the next day or whatever.

3:03:56.980 --> 3:04:01.260
 So they've developed this less than fight to the death

3:04:01.260 --> 3:04:04.540
 social morality to optimize their effectiveness

3:04:04.540 --> 3:04:05.620
 as a wolf pack.

3:04:07.860 --> 3:04:10.740
 And similarly for humans, like our morality

3:04:10.740 --> 3:04:15.740
 sort of emerges through competition and play even.

3:04:16.140 --> 3:04:19.860
 There are these implicit rules that come into place

3:04:19.860 --> 3:04:22.780
 based on how we're organizing ourselves over time.

3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:28.980
 And with, so with money it's interesting

3:04:29.380 --> 3:04:33.500
 because most tools we would consider to be amoral,

3:04:34.380 --> 3:04:38.060
 as in a hammer can be used to build a house

3:04:38.060 --> 3:04:39.340
 which could be seen to be good,

3:04:39.340 --> 3:04:40.780
 like a good constructive purpose,

3:04:40.780 --> 3:04:43.060
 or it could be used to bash them on skull,

3:04:43.060 --> 3:04:44.580
 which could be something evil.

3:04:45.940 --> 3:04:49.380
 And that the tool itself is amoral,

3:04:49.380 --> 3:04:51.500
 doesn't have any independent morality of its own.

3:04:51.500 --> 3:04:54.020
 All of the morality is associated

3:04:54.020 --> 3:04:55.380
 with the wielder of the tool.

3:04:55.380 --> 3:04:58.620
 So what's the quote like, any tool can be a weapon

3:04:58.620 --> 3:05:00.380
 if you hold it right sort of thing.

3:05:01.460 --> 3:05:05.660
 But money's maybe a little bit different in that

3:05:05.660 --> 3:05:10.660
 when you monopolize money,

3:05:11.860 --> 3:05:15.260
 it's only useful as a tool for one thing.

3:05:15.260 --> 3:05:17.820
 And that's for allocating wealth away from some

3:05:17.820 --> 3:05:19.420
 and to others.

3:05:19.420 --> 3:05:23.620
 So it is the only utility of monopolized money is theft.

3:05:24.500 --> 3:05:28.220
 There's no other, there's a lot of propaganda out there

3:05:28.220 --> 3:05:29.660
 that will say, oh, we need to print money

3:05:29.660 --> 3:05:34.340
 to get out of this disaster or to give to the poor,

3:05:34.340 --> 3:05:39.340
 whatever moralistically camouflaged political aim

3:05:40.260 --> 3:05:44.260
 is being discussed, the base layer of monopolized money

3:05:44.260 --> 3:05:46.300
 is that it's only useful for taking from some

3:05:46.300 --> 3:05:47.780
 and giving to others.

3:05:47.780 --> 3:05:51.500
 So another way to think about this is that money

3:05:51.500 --> 3:05:55.100
 is a paper claim on the savings of society.

3:05:55.100 --> 3:05:58.100
 So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings,

3:05:58.100 --> 3:06:00.820
 which could be time, could be capital,

3:06:00.820 --> 3:06:04.580
 it could be knowledge from any market actor in the world.

3:06:04.580 --> 3:06:06.780
 So it's kind of a list of who owns what,

3:06:06.780 --> 3:06:08.100
 if you will, it's a proxy list.

3:06:08.100 --> 3:06:11.180
 If there's one group that can amend that list

3:06:11.180 --> 3:06:14.700
 and others cannot, then they're basically able

3:06:14.700 --> 3:06:18.900
 and incented to modify that list to their own benefit.

3:06:20.380 --> 3:06:23.060
 And that's effectively what a central bank is doing.

3:06:23.060 --> 3:06:27.100
 So a central bank is determining how much money to create.

3:06:27.100 --> 3:06:28.740
 They're also determining who gets to receive

3:06:28.740 --> 3:06:33.140
 that money first and the first recipients of that money

3:06:33.140 --> 3:06:37.300
 are gonna be the beneficiaries in an inflationary regime.

3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:39.060
 So those that receive the money last

3:06:39.060 --> 3:06:40.620
 are the ones being robbed.

3:06:40.620 --> 3:06:42.580
 Those that receive the money first are the ones

3:06:42.580 --> 3:06:47.180
 that are receiving the stolen proceeds, let's say.

3:06:48.460 --> 3:06:53.460
 And this has a really corrosive effect on social morality

3:06:53.460 --> 3:06:58.460
 because if we consider that people's time horizon,

3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:01.780
 which the Austrians call the time preference,

3:07:02.940 --> 3:07:05.940
 the more short term thinking you are,

3:07:05.940 --> 3:07:10.940
 the more likely you are to engage in selfish behavior.

3:07:10.940 --> 3:07:14.580
 If you know that it's all over tomorrow

3:07:15.580 --> 3:07:16.900
 and you've been working your whole life

3:07:16.900 --> 3:07:20.380
 to develop this business or create this reputation

3:07:20.380 --> 3:07:21.220
 or whatever your thing is,

3:07:21.220 --> 3:07:23.660
 but you just are given the foreknowledge that tomorrow

3:07:23.660 --> 3:07:26.620
 it's all gonna end, you're much more likely to go out

3:07:26.620 --> 3:07:28.740
 and just maybe get drunk and party that night

3:07:28.740 --> 3:07:30.740
 because there's no more repercussions.

3:07:32.220 --> 3:07:35.700
 Whereas if you know that you're gonna live

3:07:35.700 --> 3:07:38.860
 for a very long time, you're much more likely

3:07:38.860 --> 3:07:40.420
 to plan for the future.

3:07:45.140 --> 3:07:46.460
 So we just say that your time horizon

3:07:46.460 --> 3:07:48.900
 is closely related to your morality.

3:07:48.900 --> 3:07:51.500
 The longer term thinking you are, the more moral

3:07:51.500 --> 3:07:53.140
 you would tend to behave, the more you would care

3:07:53.140 --> 3:07:55.020
 about long term relationship building

3:07:55.020 --> 3:07:57.580
 versus going out and getting wasted.

3:07:57.580 --> 3:08:02.580
 And money too impinges very closely on our time preference.

3:08:03.580 --> 3:08:05.300
 And again, time preference is the Austrian term.

3:08:05.300 --> 3:08:09.020
 So low time preference means you're long term oriented,

3:08:09.020 --> 3:08:11.260
 high time preference means you're short term oriented,

3:08:11.260 --> 3:08:13.300
 which can be a little trippy for some people

3:08:13.300 --> 3:08:14.460
 because it sounds backwards.

3:08:14.460 --> 3:08:19.460
 But if your money constantly loses value,

3:08:21.220 --> 3:08:25.460
 you are incentivized to become more short term oriented.

3:08:25.460 --> 3:08:29.820
 You are handicapped in your ability to plan for the future

3:08:29.820 --> 3:08:33.980
 because your money, which is intended to be,

3:08:33.980 --> 3:08:35.380
 here's another definition of money,

3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:38.260
 as an insurance policy against uncertainty.

3:08:38.260 --> 3:08:40.580
 So no matter what problems you encounter in the world,

3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:44.060
 this money will best help you deal with those problems.

3:08:44.060 --> 3:08:46.660
 When that insurance policy against uncertainty

3:08:46.660 --> 3:08:49.660
 is injected with uncertainty, it's polluted

3:08:49.660 --> 3:08:51.500
 with the uncertainty of inflation,

3:08:51.500 --> 3:08:53.060
 your time horizon shrinks,

3:08:53.060 --> 3:08:55.300
 your ability to plan long term shrinks.

3:08:55.300 --> 3:08:58.100
 And this impinges on social morality.

3:08:58.100 --> 3:09:01.380
 So there's a great book on this called Honest Money

3:09:01.380 --> 3:09:02.820
 by Gary North.

3:09:02.820 --> 3:09:06.340
 And in that book, he gives the parable of the wine maker.

3:09:06.340 --> 3:09:10.780
 And the wine maker, if we just imagine

3:09:10.780 --> 3:09:12.420
 the hypothetical wine maker,

3:09:12.420 --> 3:09:15.500
 operating a business in a centrally banked economy.

3:09:15.500 --> 3:09:17.540
 And let's say his central bank just doubled

3:09:17.540 --> 3:09:20.460
 the money supply to quote unquote save the economy.

3:09:21.620 --> 3:09:24.780
 Say an increase in money supply from one to $2 trillion.

3:09:24.780 --> 3:09:26.940
 This wine maker that's accustomed to selling wine

3:09:26.940 --> 3:09:30.380
 at $20 a bottle is now faced with basically three choices.

3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:36.020
 And an important point here too,

3:09:36.020 --> 3:09:37.420
 before we get into his three choices,

3:09:37.420 --> 3:09:39.340
 are what prices are themselves.

3:09:39.340 --> 3:09:43.980
 Prices are the most visible aspect of any service.

3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:45.940
 So when you increase prices,

3:09:46.940 --> 3:09:49.740
 you're incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere.

3:09:49.740 --> 3:09:51.380
 They're gonna look at your competition.

3:09:51.380 --> 3:09:53.100
 When you decrease prices,

3:09:53.100 --> 3:09:55.380
 you're incentivizing market actors

3:09:55.380 --> 3:09:57.180
 to look closer at your product, right?

3:09:57.180 --> 3:10:00.100
 You're delivering a solution at a lower price.

3:10:00.100 --> 3:10:02.420
 So this wine maker that's accustomed to selling his wine

3:10:02.420 --> 3:10:05.260
 at a $20 price point, all of a sudden,

3:10:05.260 --> 3:10:07.900
 because of a central bank has tripled the money supply,

3:10:07.900 --> 3:10:09.340
 he has three choices.

3:10:10.260 --> 3:10:14.500
 He can either keep selling his bottle at $20

3:10:14.500 --> 3:10:19.020
 and all of his inputs will increase due to inflation by 50%.

3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:22.740
 So he will lose 50% of his profit margin as a result.

3:10:24.220 --> 3:10:26.100
 So he can choose to eat that loss.

3:10:26.100 --> 3:10:28.420
 He can choose to double the selling price

3:10:28.420 --> 3:10:31.380
 of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40,

3:10:31.380 --> 3:10:33.820
 because all of the price of his inputs doubled.

3:10:33.820 --> 3:10:36.060
 So then he would maintain his profit margin.

3:10:36.060 --> 3:10:40.100
 Or the third one is that he could choose

3:10:40.100 --> 3:10:44.740
 to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients.

3:10:44.740 --> 3:10:46.740
 So he could use cheaper inputs

3:10:46.740 --> 3:10:49.460
 and maintain the output at the same price.

3:10:51.100 --> 3:10:53.900
 So he could basically start selling his customers

3:10:53.900 --> 3:10:55.460
 an inferior product for the same price

3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:56.980
 to preserve his profit margin.

3:10:57.980 --> 3:11:01.420
 Now, again, case number one, it's not very palatable.

3:11:01.420 --> 3:11:03.220
 He doesn't wanna eat the economic loss.

3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:06.020
 Case number two, he doesn't wanna eat the profit margin.

3:11:06.020 --> 3:11:08.340
 Case number two, it's not very good either,

3:11:08.340 --> 3:11:10.660
 because he's then incentivizing all of his customers

3:11:10.660 --> 3:11:14.220
 to go shop other winemakers if he doubles his price.

3:11:14.220 --> 3:11:16.580
 So human nature being what it is,

3:11:16.580 --> 3:11:18.580
 trying to get something for nothing,

3:11:18.580 --> 3:11:21.340
 inflation actually seeps into other industries

3:11:21.340 --> 3:11:24.740
 by encouraging producers into option three,

3:11:24.740 --> 3:11:27.940
 which is to deceive your customer in the short run.

3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:31.020
 And again, this would be done initially at the margins.

3:11:31.020 --> 3:11:32.460
 Maybe it's just a few drops of water.

3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:35.260
 Maybe it's just some cheaper grapes.

3:11:35.260 --> 3:11:40.260
 But over time, this inflation is actually inducing producers

3:11:42.500 --> 3:11:45.300
 to weigh their financial wellbeing

3:11:45.300 --> 3:11:47.300
 against their moral integrity.

3:11:47.300 --> 3:11:49.700
 So it's forcing them into this dilemma

3:11:49.700 --> 3:11:52.340
 that would not exist in a free market economy.

3:11:53.220 --> 3:11:58.220
 And as they charge more money for wine that is inferior,

3:11:58.940 --> 3:12:00.940
 the buyers of that wine,

3:12:00.940 --> 3:12:02.620
 also living in a central banked economy

3:12:02.620 --> 3:12:05.180
 are also getting scammed by not only the inflation,

3:12:05.180 --> 3:12:06.420
 but also the wine.

3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:10.940
 So it becomes this kind of corrosive contagious moral effect

3:12:12.260 --> 3:12:14.860
 that propagates throughout an economy.

3:12:14.860 --> 3:12:18.500
 And that's why I've argued in a lot of my writing

3:12:18.500 --> 3:12:23.500
 that inflation is this infectious moral cancer on the world.

3:12:24.100 --> 3:12:29.100
 I think it is tied back to a lot of the social strangeness

3:12:30.860 --> 3:12:32.460
 we've seen in modern times,

3:12:32.460 --> 3:12:35.900
 where there seems to be a lot of fake people

3:12:35.900 --> 3:12:38.020
 and a lot of fake businesses and a lot of scams,

3:12:38.020 --> 3:12:38.860
 all of these things.

3:12:38.860 --> 3:12:40.940
 I think it really is rooted in the money.

3:12:40.940 --> 3:12:45.100
 And Bitcoin, as the first money in history

3:12:45.100 --> 3:12:47.340
 that has a 0% terminal inflation rate,

3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:50.480
 or said differently, zero unexpected inflation.

3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:54.340
 There's no theft integrated into Bitcoin.

3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:56.020
 You can only earn it through work

3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:58.280
 or sacrificing resources to obtain it.

3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:03.280
 It is the antidote to this moral cancer

3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:06.120
 that inflation riddles our society with.

3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:08.820
 Again, you're blowing my mind a little bit

3:13:08.820 --> 3:13:11.840
 to think about the ripple effects of inflation,

3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:15.120
 the way it seeps through our interactions.

3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:18.560
 So at the very, the early ripples

3:13:18.560 --> 3:13:20.400
 is the effect it has on the products,

3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:23.080
 on the dilution of the wine.

3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:27.160
 But also it might have ripple effects on the character,

3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:28.680
 on the behavior of people.

3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:33.320
 That's interesting, artificial creation of scarcity,

3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:38.320
 creating, having effects on society at the social,

3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:40.200
 like the social fabric.

3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:42.240
 And I guess you're arguing the morality.

3:13:43.980 --> 3:13:45.960
 It's perverting free market dynamics,

3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:49.000
 which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic truth.

3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.000
 So inflation distorts price signals,

3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.960
 which means it confuses capital allocation.

3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:56.280
 So we're trying to solve problems,

3:13:56.280 --> 3:13:58.080
 but all of a sudden we can't tell

3:13:58.080 --> 3:13:59.560
 if this price increase is a matter

3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:01.640
 of true supply and demand change

3:14:01.640 --> 3:14:03.520
 or a matter of policy change.

3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:07.200
 So it clouds our economic perceptions.

3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:09.360
 It suppresses innovation

3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:11.120
 because now you've exacerbated

3:14:11.120 --> 3:14:12.520
 the boom and bust business cycle.

3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:14.960
 People are gonna overborrow and go into projects

3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:16.840
 that they can't profitably sustain.

3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:18.360
 So then there'll be a huge collapse.

3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:22.280
 So that actually breaks the market's function

3:14:22.280 --> 3:14:24.080
 of generating innovation.

3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:25.220
 And then, yeah, I would argue too

3:14:25.220 --> 3:14:29.560
 that it pollutes our pursuit of virtue, let's say.

3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:33.320
 Maybe it's pushing back, but I don't think so.

3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:34.880
 It's not as clear to me,

3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:36.860
 perhaps because I haven't thought about it deeply,

3:14:36.860 --> 3:14:41.860
 that money is core to life and human interaction

3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:45.600
 because there might be other forces,

3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:48.900
 other fraudulent forces, other things in human nature

3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:51.200
 that are creating these effects as well.

3:14:51.200 --> 3:14:53.320
 So it's clear, I think you're articulating really well

3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:56.200
 that there's these negative effects from inflation.

3:14:56.200 --> 3:14:59.040
 I wonder if there's other undiscovered,

3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:02.320
 not undiscovered, but ones we're not making explicit now,

3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:07.320
 forces that are creating all the things we're seeing now

3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:11.500
 with, like you said, cancer culture and all those things,

3:15:11.500 --> 3:15:16.500
 but also the negative effects on the quality of products,

3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:20.360
 on the excellence of the creativity and the innovation,

3:15:20.360 --> 3:15:21.200
 all those kinds of things.

3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:23.160
 I wonder if there's other factors.

3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:26.760
 It's kind of, listen, it's compelling to think money's

3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:28.360
 at the core of it all.

3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:30.760
 Like if you fix, I forgot what the phrase was.

3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:31.760
 Fix the money, fix the world.

3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:33.560
 Yeah, fix the money, fix the world.

3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:40.520
 Again, things that sound good, I'm skeptical of by nature.

3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:44.480
 So I wonder if there's other things that are beyond money

3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:47.320
 that are somehow deeply integrated into our human nature.

3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:51.640
 Another one related to money is social cohesion itself.

3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:56.640
 So very simple anecdote for this was the more you increase

3:15:57.140 --> 3:16:01.120
 the inflation rate, social cohesion is inversely

3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:02.140
 proportionate to that.

3:16:02.140 --> 3:16:04.620
 So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, right?

3:16:04.620 --> 3:16:07.300
 Where the money is produced in such excess

3:16:07.300 --> 3:16:09.800
 that it loses all meaning and relevance.

3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:14.400
 So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters,

3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:16.720
 clogging the streets, clogging the sewer system,

3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:21.160
 because the cash has lost all relevance.

3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:23.640
 And so anecdotally, we would suspect that,

3:16:23.640 --> 3:16:27.080
 okay, if there's a inverse relationship

3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:29.960
 between inflation and social cohesion,

3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:32.700
 if we could then take inflation to zero,

3:16:32.700 --> 3:16:34.520
 couldn't we theoretically increase

3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:36.980
 social cohesion to its maximum?

3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:40.600
 So another way to say that is inflation

3:16:40.600 --> 3:16:45.600
 is a decivilizing force, whereas natural price deflation,

3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:48.600
 which would occur in a hard money economy,

3:16:48.600 --> 3:16:51.040
 where there's either a fixed supply of Bitcoin

3:16:51.040 --> 3:16:56.040
 or a relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance,

3:16:56.200 --> 3:17:00.280
 that lays claim to an increasing capital stock

3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:03.500
 of goods and services, prices would naturally decline

3:17:03.500 --> 3:17:06.120
 every year as we became smarter.

3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:07.840
 So the market price becomes a reflection

3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:09.840
 of our collective knowledge.

3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:12.680
 So by letting prices decline naturally over time,

3:17:12.680 --> 3:17:16.120
 we can actually induce civilization.

3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:18.640
 But by trying to force prices higher all the time

3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:21.880
 via the central bank, we're creating the opposite effect.

3:17:21.880 --> 3:17:24.160
 So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union,

3:17:24.160 --> 3:17:26.380
 and I happened to have lived through the collapse

3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:27.460
 of the Soviet Union.

3:17:28.780 --> 3:17:33.780
 And so what are the factors, the causes in your mind

3:17:34.660 --> 3:17:36.900
 to why the Soviet Union collapsed?

3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:42.920
 So, you know, definitely a multivariate situation.

3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:45.160
 I think there's a lot of factors.

3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:48.860
 One that jumped out to me recently,

3:17:48.860 --> 3:17:51.420
 again, from that documentary that I didn't note before

3:17:51.420 --> 3:17:54.060
 was that at one point, Stalin eliminated,

3:17:54.060 --> 3:17:56.940
 I think 75% of his intelligence force,

3:17:59.420 --> 3:18:01.300
 which I think when you're competing

3:18:01.300 --> 3:18:04.100
 with another nation state, you know,

3:18:04.100 --> 3:18:06.820
 and intelligence and covert operations

3:18:06.820 --> 3:18:08.820
 are very integral to your survival,

3:18:08.820 --> 3:18:13.560
 I think that was definitely a shot in the foot.

3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:18.560
 But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism

3:18:19.780 --> 3:18:23.620
 and communism were each resource strategies

3:18:23.620 --> 3:18:25.600
 of the 20th century nation state.

3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:30.080
 And they seem, you know, we commonly consider them

3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:31.460
 to be diametrically opposed,

3:18:31.460 --> 3:18:34.780
 but there's actually a lot of commonality between the two.

3:18:34.780 --> 3:18:38.260
 The difference would be that in Soviet Russia,

3:18:39.300 --> 3:18:40.460
 as we alluded to earlier,

3:18:40.460 --> 3:18:43.580
 they tried to completely replace price signals

3:18:44.720 --> 3:18:46.860
 with this nationalistic faith and devotion.

3:18:46.860 --> 3:18:50.660
 So they removed the economic nerve signal,

3:18:50.660 --> 3:18:53.700
 which coordinated the allocation of capital over time.

3:18:53.700 --> 3:18:57.020
 So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.

3:18:57.020 --> 3:18:58.240
 Whereas in the United States,

3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:02.340
 we left most markets open to free enterprise.

3:19:02.340 --> 3:19:06.100
 So we honored the integrity of price signals

3:19:06.100 --> 3:19:11.100
 and we allowed people to trade and accumulate wealth.

3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:14.600
 So in every market, except the market for money,

3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:18.280
 both markets maintained a central bank as we've gotten to.

3:19:18.280 --> 3:19:23.060
 So I think in a really big picture standpoint,

3:19:23.060 --> 3:19:27.540
 that's why capitalism outcompetes communism

3:19:27.540 --> 3:19:31.220
 is because it is able to generate more wealth

3:19:31.220 --> 3:19:32.940
 than communism was,

3:19:32.940 --> 3:19:35.620
 and therefore was able to put financial pressure

3:19:35.620 --> 3:19:39.340
 on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy,

3:19:39.340 --> 3:19:40.180
 essentially.

3:19:41.180 --> 3:19:44.120
 A similar model, I would argue,

3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:48.580
 is that for the same reasons we saw

3:19:48.580 --> 3:19:50.100
 capitalism outcompete communism,

3:19:50.100 --> 3:19:53.880
 which I think the data that I recall

3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:56.580
 was that the USSR's economy was valued

3:19:56.580 --> 3:19:59.660
 at close to one third of its inputs.

3:19:59.660 --> 3:20:02.820
 So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR

3:20:02.820 --> 3:20:05.380
 and just sold all the raw materials that were going into it,

3:20:05.380 --> 3:20:07.940
 it would have been worth three times as much

3:20:07.940 --> 3:20:09.820
 as sending the materials in,

3:20:09.820 --> 3:20:10.900
 running it through the efforts

3:20:10.900 --> 3:20:12.620
 and then shipping things back out.

3:20:12.620 --> 3:20:16.260
 It was value destructive versus value creative.

3:20:16.260 --> 3:20:18.580
 And I would argue this is because,

3:20:18.580 --> 3:20:21.420
 again, the centralized computing model

3:20:21.420 --> 3:20:23.340
 versus decentralized computing model,

3:20:23.340 --> 3:20:26.160
 it just became more and more corrupt over time.

3:20:27.780 --> 3:20:30.900
 It got to the point where I think most of the occupations

3:20:30.900 --> 3:20:34.220
 in USSR towards the end were as informants, right?

3:20:34.220 --> 3:20:35.820
 They were working for the state.

3:20:37.140 --> 3:20:38.500
 Jordan Peterson makes this point too,

3:20:38.500 --> 3:20:40.540
 that at some point it was actually illegal

3:20:40.540 --> 3:20:43.100
 to be sad in Soviet Russia.

3:20:43.100 --> 3:20:44.980
 Because if you were sad,

3:20:44.980 --> 3:20:48.900
 you were contradicting the utopian view of the state.

3:20:48.900 --> 3:20:49.740
 So if you were sad,

3:20:49.740 --> 3:20:51.940
 you're implying the state's not doing something wrong.

3:20:51.940 --> 3:20:53.780
 But by the way, this does remind me,

3:20:55.020 --> 3:20:57.180
 do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin

3:20:57.180 --> 3:21:02.180
 and about the future impact of Bitcoin on the society?

3:21:02.180 --> 3:21:05.540
 No, I don't actually.

3:21:06.980 --> 3:21:10.620
 We're hopefully gonna be talking to him soon about that.

3:21:10.620 --> 3:21:14.140
 We did a book club on his book, Maps of Meaning,

3:21:14.140 --> 3:21:16.100
 and he engaged with us about it.

3:21:16.100 --> 3:21:19.060
 So we're hoping to deliver the orange bill to Mr. Peterson.

3:21:19.060 --> 3:21:20.660
 The orange bill.

3:21:20.660 --> 3:21:24.020
 I think his audience is one of the most important audiences

3:21:24.020 --> 3:21:25.340
 in the world to understand Bitcoin,

3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:29.380
 these people that are conscientious and responsible.

3:21:29.380 --> 3:21:34.380
 I think they'll quickly understand Bitcoin's

3:21:34.660 --> 3:21:38.460
 value proposition and help elucidate it to the world.

3:21:38.460 --> 3:21:41.180
 I'm trying to remember what he said about it.

3:21:41.180 --> 3:21:44.180
 Basically, I think his support of Bitcoin

3:21:44.180 --> 3:21:47.060
 is grounded in the kind of people

3:21:47.060 --> 3:21:48.700
 who are opposing Bitcoin.

3:21:49.860 --> 3:21:52.700
 So without understanding Bitcoin,

3:21:52.700 --> 3:21:54.420
 he starts to like Bitcoin

3:21:54.420 --> 3:21:56.620
 because of the people who are opposing it.

3:21:56.620 --> 3:21:59.580
 He's, you know, you start to, I mean,

3:21:59.580 --> 3:22:03.660
 that's partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.

3:22:03.660 --> 3:22:08.540
 It's like all the people in power

3:22:08.540 --> 3:22:12.340
 and all the kind of shady, fraudulent,

3:22:12.340 --> 3:22:15.900
 non genuine people who are dismissing Bitcoin

3:22:17.540 --> 3:22:19.420
 are making me think, hmm.

3:22:19.420 --> 3:22:23.500
 One of Jordan's definitions of God is,

3:22:23.500 --> 3:22:26.740
 he says, God is found in the truthful speech

3:22:26.740 --> 3:22:29.140
 that rectifies pathological hierarchies.

3:22:30.300 --> 3:22:34.660
 And I think that is a beautiful definition

3:22:34.660 --> 3:22:36.660
 of what Bitcoin is doing in the world.

3:22:36.660 --> 3:22:39.060
 And that we have this pathological hierarchy

3:22:39.060 --> 3:22:40.820
 called central banking,

3:22:40.820 --> 3:22:43.580
 by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,

3:22:45.020 --> 3:22:48.260
 that is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft

3:22:48.260 --> 3:22:51.300
 and funding warfare at a global scale.

3:22:51.300 --> 3:22:53.540
 Like Ron Paul said, it's no coincidence

3:22:53.540 --> 3:22:56.020
 that the 20th century of total war

3:22:56.020 --> 3:22:58.020
 was also the century of central banking.

3:22:59.540 --> 3:23:04.540
 When you have an institution of currency counterfeiting,

3:23:04.540 --> 3:23:06.660
 which the central bank is,

3:23:06.660 --> 3:23:09.340
 you are no longer bounded by your own balance sheet

3:23:09.340 --> 3:23:10.300
 when you go to war.

3:23:10.300 --> 3:23:12.340
 You don't have to just go to war on your own resources.

3:23:12.340 --> 3:23:15.180
 You can now pillage the commonwealth

3:23:15.180 --> 3:23:18.940
 and pull for the savings of society as a whole

3:23:18.940 --> 3:23:21.380
 before you go bankrupt.

3:23:21.380 --> 3:23:23.900
 And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right?

3:23:23.900 --> 3:23:28.260
 Hitler hyperinflated in the Weimar Republic

3:23:28.260 --> 3:23:30.460
 to fund his war efforts.

3:23:31.780 --> 3:23:35.620
 And frankly, every dictator, every world war,

3:23:35.620 --> 3:23:39.700
 every internment camp in history was made possible

3:23:39.700 --> 3:23:43.460
 by the weaponization of money in fiat currency.

3:23:43.460 --> 3:23:46.900
 So I hope, I know Jordan Peterson

3:23:46.900 --> 3:23:49.340
 is a huge proponent of free speech.

3:23:49.340 --> 3:23:51.740
 And I think that's ultimately at its deepest essence,

3:23:51.740 --> 3:23:53.180
 that's what Bitcoin really is, right?

3:23:53.180 --> 3:23:55.420
 It is just the purest form

3:23:55.420 --> 3:23:58.540
 of monetary speech we've ever had.

3:23:58.540 --> 3:24:02.940
 And by purifying that primary operating system

3:24:02.940 --> 3:24:06.180
 of human action, I think we can eliminate

3:24:06.180 --> 3:24:09.220
 this pathological hierarchy that is unfortunately

3:24:09.220 --> 3:24:11.780
 the dominant institution in the world today.

3:24:11.780 --> 3:24:13.380
 Yeah, I'm definitely,

3:24:13.380 --> 3:24:16.340
 especially with these explorations of Bitcoin,

3:24:16.340 --> 3:24:18.020
 this journey I've been on,

3:24:18.020 --> 3:24:21.380
 I'll revisit some of the aspects of human history

3:24:21.380 --> 3:24:24.620
 that I've been looking at like Stalin and Hitler

3:24:24.620 --> 3:24:28.820
 with a, from a perspective of a monetary perspective,

3:24:28.820 --> 3:24:33.140
 like what are the effects of inflation?

3:24:33.140 --> 3:24:37.980
 How was it used as a tool in gaining power

3:24:37.980 --> 3:24:42.980
 and maintaining power and manipulating the populace

3:24:42.980 --> 3:24:47.820
 in doing, in inflicting suffering

3:24:47.820 --> 3:24:51.380
 and I would say evil onto the world.

3:24:51.380 --> 3:24:52.260
 It's interesting.

3:24:52.260 --> 3:24:54.740
 I, it's interesting.

3:24:54.740 --> 3:24:56.860
 I'm gonna have to sort of go back into the hole.

3:24:56.860 --> 3:25:01.700
 So I tend to focus more on the human nature

3:25:02.780 --> 3:25:05.780
 and less about the tools

3:25:05.780 --> 3:25:08.820
 that human nature leverages to affect change.

3:25:08.820 --> 3:25:11.100
 But you're right that in some sense,

3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:16.100
 money is a tool which can be effectively used

3:25:17.500 --> 3:25:21.740
 to perform moral and immoral actions

3:25:21.740 --> 3:25:23.500
 depending on how it's used.

3:25:23.500 --> 3:25:25.660
 There's a feedback between the two, right?

3:25:25.660 --> 3:25:30.660
 There's, specifically with money itself,

3:25:31.700 --> 3:25:36.700
 it's the, here's the way I've been posing it lately

3:25:36.700 --> 3:25:39.700
 is that I actually think we typically think of people

3:25:39.700 --> 3:25:41.540
 as good or bad, or again,

3:25:41.540 --> 3:25:43.300
 trying to label people all the time,

3:25:43.300 --> 3:25:45.620
 but I think people and their characters

3:25:45.620 --> 3:25:48.540
 are emergent properties of the incentive structures

3:25:48.540 --> 3:25:49.380
 they inhabit.

3:25:49.380 --> 3:25:50.220
 Yeah.

3:25:50.220 --> 3:25:53.060
 So, you know, what does Charlie Munger say?

3:25:53.060 --> 3:25:54.300
 Don't show me the incentives,

3:25:54.300 --> 3:25:56.900
 I'll show you the outcome kind of thing.

3:25:56.900 --> 3:25:59.180
 This is a flawed incentive structure

3:25:59.180 --> 3:26:01.100
 we've been operating within.

3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:03.220
 Now I'm not speaking to the intention.

3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:04.620
 People want to argue with me all the time.

3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:06.980
 Like Jerome Powell's not a bad guy.

3:26:06.980 --> 3:26:08.620
 He's doing his best at the central bank.

3:26:08.620 --> 3:26:09.940
 He's doing what he thinks is right.

3:26:09.940 --> 3:26:10.780
 That's fine.

3:26:11.780 --> 3:26:13.700
 Well, that's true or not, it actually doesn't matter.

3:26:13.700 --> 3:26:16.420
 The intention is divergent from the outcome.

3:26:16.420 --> 3:26:18.020
 The institution that they are running

3:26:18.020 --> 3:26:20.340
 is premised on deception and theft,

3:26:20.340 --> 3:26:22.980
 and it is handicapping the productive economy.

3:26:22.980 --> 3:26:26.300
 So when we're, even the terms we use, printing money,

3:26:26.300 --> 3:26:27.980
 you're not creating any new value.

3:26:27.980 --> 3:26:29.860
 You're not infusing the economy with anything,

3:26:29.860 --> 3:26:31.860
 any new productive factors whatsoever.

3:26:31.860 --> 3:26:33.540
 You're just creating new value.

3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:35.260
 You're not infusing the economy with anything,

3:26:35.260 --> 3:26:37.220
 any new productive factors whatsoever.

3:26:37.220 --> 3:26:39.500
 You're just harvesting the economic surplus

3:26:39.500 --> 3:26:42.300
 created by entrepreneurs in the marketplace.

3:26:42.300 --> 3:26:45.300
 It's impossible to add any value to an economy

3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:48.420
 by increasing the paper claims on its savings.

3:26:48.420 --> 3:26:53.420
 So there's a feedback loop between man and tool,

3:26:54.460 --> 3:26:56.020
 between creator and created.

3:26:56.020 --> 3:26:59.780
 And I think we have to honor the relationship

3:26:59.780 --> 3:27:01.300
 above either one, right?

3:27:01.300 --> 3:27:03.300
 Trying to put the right people in the system

3:27:03.300 --> 3:27:04.140
 in the right place.

3:27:04.140 --> 3:27:05.220
 Do you think the interesting question

3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:10.220
 of whether the people that are in control of central banks

3:27:12.060 --> 3:27:14.700
 or in positions of power there,

3:27:14.700 --> 3:27:17.220
 if they themselves are malevolent,

3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:19.820
 they themselves are bad actors,

3:27:19.820 --> 3:27:24.820
 or they're simply like leaves floating along the river,

3:27:25.220 --> 3:27:29.820
 sort of just the cog in the machine,

3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:31.380
 an ant in an ant colony

3:27:31.380 --> 3:27:33.940
 that operates in a certain kind of way.

3:27:33.940 --> 3:27:36.740
 Like, where do you put the blame?

3:27:36.740 --> 3:27:40.740
 Do you put the blame on the way things are operating

3:27:40.740 --> 3:27:44.460
 onto the individuals or onto the system itself,

3:27:44.460 --> 3:27:46.980
 the idea behind the system?

3:27:46.980 --> 3:27:50.860
 Where, and is it useful to place the blame somewhere?

3:27:50.860 --> 3:27:53.380
 Because for me, it might be useful to understand that

3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:57.080
 in order to figure out what the solution is.

3:27:57.080 --> 3:27:59.840
 I tend to not put the blame on the individual.

3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:02.460
 Like I tend to believe most people are good

3:28:02.460 --> 3:28:04.320
 and want to see themselves as good.

3:28:05.340 --> 3:28:07.760
 And so in that case, it's very difficult

3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:11.100
 to be truly malevolent as you would need to be to control,

3:28:11.100 --> 3:28:13.880
 to gain centralized power at the large scale.

3:28:14.820 --> 3:28:18.180
 But I know a lot of conspiracy theorists

3:28:19.140 --> 3:28:23.140
 and just a lot of people think that there is evil humans

3:28:23.140 --> 3:28:26.700
 in the world that seek power, maintain that power,

3:28:26.700 --> 3:28:29.940
 and then use that power for bad purposes.

3:28:29.940 --> 3:28:32.300
 I think they're just people.

3:28:32.300 --> 3:28:34.380
 And they're just trying to get something for nothing,

3:28:34.380 --> 3:28:35.380
 like all of us do.

3:28:35.380 --> 3:28:37.860
 I like this framework of thought.

3:28:37.860 --> 3:28:42.120
 Well, honestly, and that's what the central bank is,

3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:44.980
 is the ultimate institution to get something for nothing.

3:28:44.980 --> 3:28:49.680
 You get a perpetual income stream,

3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:53.260
 the ability to acquire more and more territory in the world

3:28:53.260 --> 3:28:56.020
 through monopolizing the supply of money.

3:28:56.620 --> 3:28:59.260
 And you can literally print money.

3:28:59.260 --> 3:29:01.300
 You can buy your way out of anything

3:29:01.300 --> 3:29:03.740
 and buy your way into anything in the world.

3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:08.740
 So it is, I think the most, not say the most,

3:29:08.900 --> 3:29:10.820
 but a group of very intelligent people

3:29:10.820 --> 3:29:12.740
 put this thing together and figured out

3:29:12.740 --> 3:29:15.140
 how to get something for nothing in perpetuity

3:29:17.780 --> 3:29:20.540
 by clouding people's conception of money.

3:29:20.540 --> 3:29:24.780
 And if we look at the central bank is,

3:29:24.780 --> 3:29:25.700
 it's been around for a while,

3:29:25.700 --> 3:29:29.420
 but the latest implementation here in the US is the Fed.

3:29:29.420 --> 3:29:30.540
 It's about a hundred years old.

3:29:30.540 --> 3:29:34.240
 It's an analog age institution that I think has lost

3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:37.900
 a lot of its relevance in the modern age.

3:29:37.900 --> 3:29:40.160
 And I don't think it will survive

3:29:40.160 --> 3:29:43.020
 the ever galvanizing gaze of the digital age.

3:29:43.020 --> 3:29:47.020
 There's just too much sunlight, too much transparency today.

3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:49.380
 Ideas move too quickly for something like this

3:29:49.380 --> 3:29:51.300
 to remain relevant.

3:29:51.300 --> 3:29:53.980
 But they are just people.

3:29:53.980 --> 3:29:55.740
 They are just seeking something for nothing.

3:29:55.740 --> 3:29:58.220
 But I think when you concentrate that much power

3:29:58.220 --> 3:30:00.340
 and that much control, that much wealth

3:30:00.340 --> 3:30:04.980
 into the hands of few, it does change.

3:30:04.980 --> 3:30:07.780
 Hayek argued that the nature of power,

3:30:09.300 --> 3:30:11.580
 again, it's something that we all sort of desire.

3:30:11.580 --> 3:30:14.100
 To be completely powerless, you're really unhappy, right?

3:30:14.100 --> 3:30:16.340
 If you're totally powerless, you're a slave.

3:30:16.340 --> 3:30:17.700
 Someone else tells you what to do.

3:30:17.700 --> 3:30:18.980
 You have no autonomy.

3:30:18.980 --> 3:30:20.580
 It's miserable, right?

3:30:20.580 --> 3:30:23.140
 So there's this, it makes the consolidation

3:30:23.140 --> 3:30:25.880
 of power alluring and that we want to protect ourselves

3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:28.360
 from that slave state, let's say.

3:30:28.360 --> 3:30:30.740
 But like many things, it can be taken too far.

3:30:31.660 --> 3:30:35.480
 And when you concentrate power into too few hands,

3:30:35.480 --> 3:30:38.460
 Hayek argues that it actually transforms.

3:30:38.460 --> 3:30:41.020
 It becomes something much more intoxicating

3:30:41.020 --> 3:30:44.140
 than it would be if it was held in a more distributed way.

3:30:44.140 --> 3:30:47.380
 And I think that gets into a lot of these,

3:30:47.380 --> 3:30:50.200
 I don't know if they call themselves elites

3:30:50.200 --> 3:30:51.720
 or people call them elites or whatever,

3:30:51.720 --> 3:30:54.920
 like let's say shareholders of central banks,

3:30:54.920 --> 3:30:56.760
 people participating in the World Economic Forum,

3:30:56.760 --> 3:30:57.740
 things like this.

3:30:59.260 --> 3:31:01.700
 They come, I guess the incentives, right?

3:31:01.700 --> 3:31:05.400
 The incentive schema they're in is rewarding them constantly,

3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:06.680
 telling them everything they're doing,

3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:08.000
 saying and thinking is correct

3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:10.880
 because they just keep getting richer all the time.

3:31:10.880 --> 3:31:15.140
 And it leads you closer to this definition of evil,

3:31:15.140 --> 3:31:19.200
 which in the book, Paradise Lost,

3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:20.940
 Friedman said, evil is the force

3:31:20.940 --> 3:31:23.740
 which believes its knowledge is complete.

3:31:23.740 --> 3:31:27.380
 So these people become more and more convinced

3:31:27.380 --> 3:31:32.180
 that they have the plan or they have the course of action

3:31:32.180 --> 3:31:33.280
 that will save the world,

3:31:33.280 --> 3:31:35.640
 that if everyone would just listen to them,

3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:38.000
 that they would lead us to the promised land, right?

3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:41.160
 Whether this is Bill Gates saving us from a climate crisis

3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:44.560
 or any of these other economic policies

3:31:44.560 --> 3:31:46.420
 that are targeted at a certain outcome,

3:31:46.420 --> 3:31:49.300
 but almost always diverge almost perfectly

3:31:49.300 --> 3:31:51.700
 from that outcome, creating its opposite effect.

3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:55.600
 I think that's the problem,

3:31:55.600 --> 3:31:58.700
 that we have this mechanism that can concentrate wealth

3:31:58.700 --> 3:32:01.440
 and power into the hands of so few

3:32:01.440 --> 3:32:04.420
 that it leads to the proliferation of evil,

3:32:05.660 --> 3:32:06.980
 meaning that it convinces people

3:32:06.980 --> 3:32:08.280
 that their knowledge is complete.

3:32:08.280 --> 3:32:12.760
 Whereas something like a Bitcoin

3:32:12.760 --> 3:32:14.660
 almost forces the opposite outcome.

3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:22.220
 In a Bitcoin denominated world, a pure free market,

3:32:22.220 --> 3:32:24.480
 the consumer is sovereign.

3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:28.000
 So you cannot earn value in the world

3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:30.520
 unless you are serving your fellow man,

3:32:30.520 --> 3:32:34.060
 unless they have expressed through their buy and sell

3:32:34.060 --> 3:32:35.800
 decisions in the marketplace, right?

3:32:35.800 --> 3:32:39.560
 You've created a satisfaction of a particular want

3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:41.520
 that they value so much,

3:32:41.520 --> 3:32:43.160
 they've acquired so much of your good or service

3:32:43.160 --> 3:32:45.180
 that you've become rich.

3:32:45.180 --> 3:32:47.200
 You can only maintain that position of wealth

3:32:47.200 --> 3:32:49.960
 so long as you continue to serve your fellow man.

3:32:49.960 --> 3:32:54.240
 So it changes the incentives such that dominance

3:32:54.240 --> 3:32:59.080
 in the world can no longer be paired with coercion.

3:32:59.080 --> 3:33:01.660
 It has to be paired with competence.

3:33:01.660 --> 3:33:05.460
 And that's how this, when we say Bitcoin fixes this,

3:33:05.460 --> 3:33:06.300
 that's what we mean.

3:33:06.300 --> 3:33:09.320
 Like it restores that skin in the game,

3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:11.380
 that balance of incentives and disincentives

3:33:11.380 --> 3:33:13.920
 that help us properly navigate reality.

3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:17.280
 And it prevents the buildup of systemic rot

3:33:17.280 --> 3:33:19.120
 like we see with the central bank.

3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:21.400
 What books?

3:33:21.400 --> 3:33:23.120
 People love this question.

3:33:23.120 --> 3:33:25.840
 And you're exceptionally well read.

3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:28.200
 You've explored all kinds of ideas.

3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:31.960
 Is there some books, technical, fiction, philosophical,

3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:35.680
 coloring books, children's books had an impact on your life

3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:38.760
 and you would maybe recommend to others

3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:39.860
 that they should read?

3:33:39.860 --> 3:33:43.160
 I think we mentioned a couple of them here today,

3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:47.780
 but I think a really useful triplet of books

3:33:49.180 --> 3:33:50.880
 that I've been recommending recently

3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:56.080
 to help diffuse this materialist worldview of reality

3:33:56.080 --> 3:33:58.920
 where we still think in kind of the Newtonian model

3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:01.200
 that it's atoms and cause and effect.

3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:05.160
 I'd first recommend Jordan Peterson's book,

3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:06.160
 Maps of Meaning.

3:34:06.160 --> 3:34:11.160
 It's a deep dive into mythology

3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:14.160
 and how it's developed over the course of history

3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:17.260
 and how it's reflected both in our social structures

3:34:17.260 --> 3:34:21.360
 and our intra psychic nature really,

3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:23.320
 and how they come to reflect one another in a way.

3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:25.800
 Like the way we think again shapes the world

3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:26.960
 and then the way the world is shaped,

3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:28.160
 shapes the way we think.

3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:30.800
 That's an excellent book.

3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:33.480
 It's very dense and difficult read.

3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:35.360
 Actually this trilogy is pretty brutal.

3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:38.540
 Probably take you a year to read, hours a day.

3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:40.640
 The second one I mentioned earlier

3:34:40.640 --> 3:34:42.420
 was Human Action by Mises.

3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:46.560
 The ultimate tome on Austrian economics

3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:50.240
 will help explicate this realm of relevance.

3:34:50.240 --> 3:34:54.400
 I think that economics truly is where again,

3:34:56.040 --> 3:35:00.080
 there are things and then these things become means or ends

3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:03.200
 once we channel our purpose through them.

3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:07.520
 So this realm of non materialist relevance

3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:10.480
 that I think is really important to grasping economics

3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:11.720
 at a first principles level,

3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:14.040
 I think that book lays it out tremendously.

3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:16.480
 And then the last one would be,

3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:17.560
 I think I mentioned this at the beginning,

3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:19.960
 was that book Lila by Robert Persig,

3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:23.800
 where he's making the case that value is fundamental.

3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:25.640
 And all of these books,

3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:27.560
 they kind of all point to that actually.

3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:31.080
 They're pointing back to value being the fundamental thing,

3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:35.320
 values expressed through moral action

3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:37.920
 as being the fundamental substrate of reality.

3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:42.040
 So if you're like me, I grew up quite scientific minded.

3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:43.320
 It'll help diffuse some of that

3:35:43.320 --> 3:35:45.920
 and maybe retrain you to the other side of reality.

3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:49.200
 So you said these books are difficult.

3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:52.800
 Maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.

3:35:52.800 --> 3:35:54.400
 Is it just the technical nature?

3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:55.320
 Is it the length?

3:35:55.320 --> 3:35:56.880
 Is it the depth of the ideas

3:35:56.880 --> 3:35:58.880
 or how long it takes to integrate them?

3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:01.720
 And more sort of importantly,

3:36:01.720 --> 3:36:04.200
 is there recommendation advice you can give

3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:09.200
 on how to integrate these ideas,

3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:13.840
 how to read, how to learn in the spaces there

3:36:13.840 --> 3:36:15.200
 from your own life?

3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:17.000
 Like how do you enjoy taking in ideas?

3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:18.160
 And this could be for these books,

3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:21.120
 but also in the Bitcoin world

3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:24.520
 and reading a bunch of different ideas written by others,

3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:28.200
 just integrating stuff, even watching podcasts

3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:29.680
 and all those kinds of things.

3:36:29.680 --> 3:36:31.440
 Yeah, I'm a reader.

3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:32.520
 I love to read.

3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:35.960
 One of the most useful things I've ever done

3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:37.680
 was take a speed reading course.

3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:40.120
 I actually think there's a version of this

3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:41.640
 available on Tim Ferriss's website.

3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:44.280
 It's like a 30 minute speed reading course.

3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:45.760
 It's all about eye movement.

3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:48.600
 Instead of moving your eye continuously line over line,

3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:50.600
 it's more about jumping in your brain.

3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:53.560
 You can train your brain to just absorb words

3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:56.960
 in their totality versus kind of reading word by word.

3:36:56.960 --> 3:37:00.800
 And also not, I haven't fully taken that journey actually,

3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:05.400
 but I remember taking a few steps on that journey,

3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:08.640
 realizing that I'm speaking inside my head.

3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:09.480
 Yeah.

3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:10.840
 I'm saying the words inside my head

3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:12.200
 and that's actually getting in the way.

3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:13.040
 That's right.

3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:15.080
 So there's a lot of little hacks like that.

3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:17.880
 I maybe lazily, now that you mentioned,

3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:19.320
 I'll have to revisit this.

3:37:19.320 --> 3:37:23.720
 But I have convinced myself that I don't need to read faster

3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:25.440
 because that's not ultimately the bottleneck.

3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:28.360
 The bottleneck is in me thinking about stuff.

3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:30.440
 In fact, I like reading really slowly

3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:31.920
 or so I convinced myself.

3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:35.520
 Because ultimately it's not about gaining more information.

3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:38.680
 It's about time spent thinking deeply.

3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:40.280
 Yes, yes.

3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:43.280
 But maybe that's just me being very lazy

3:37:43.280 --> 3:37:44.200
 because yes, it's true.

3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:45.480
 It's important to think deeply,

3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:49.360
 but maybe I could speed up the consumption of information.

3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:50.440
 It's fine.

3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:51.880
 I like to be dynamic actually.

3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:55.320
 So usually speed reading initially

3:37:55.320 --> 3:37:58.400
 and that diffused that internal dialogue for me

3:37:58.400 --> 3:37:59.720
 because when I was reading one word at a time,

3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:00.560
 I was having that too.

3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:02.080
 You almost get a feedback in your own head

3:38:02.080 --> 3:38:03.240
 when you're reading the word out loud

3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:04.640
 and it's clouding your thoughts.

3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:06.560
 If you're speed reading, you can't do that.

3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:08.640
 You're taking in groups of words at a time

3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:13.080
 so you can't internally verbalize it, I guess.

3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:15.560
 And then I also am really big on annotating,

3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:17.720
 underlining, writing in the margins.

3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:20.000
 I prefer a physical book,

3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:21.400
 but I also read the Kindle a lot

3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:23.120
 because it's just so convenient.

3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:25.440
 Anywhere you're waiting in line or every night before bed,

3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:27.080
 I'm reading my Kindle.

3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:30.120
 And I also advocate rereading a lot.

3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:34.560
 So if you found something that struck you at a deep level

3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:36.080
 or you found particularly fascinating,

3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:37.520
 like you have to listen to that.

3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:41.360
 That's your, I don't know, your mind or your spirit signal

3:38:41.360 --> 3:38:43.520
 that that is something meaningful to you

3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:46.320
 and you should, to your point, reread it,

3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:49.200
 sit with it for a long time, write about it.

3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:52.880
 And that becomes the ultimate triumvirate

3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:55.000
 of synthesizing an idea, actually.

3:38:55.000 --> 3:38:58.400
 If you can read about it and then write about it

3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:01.000
 and then go and talk about it,

3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:03.040
 you get this crystallization of understanding

3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:05.520
 that's just not possible doing any one of the three

3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:06.760
 or any two of the three.

3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:12.560
 So I definitely highly recommend people to do that.

3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:16.280
 And in terms of how are those books difficult?

3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:18.120
 I mean, and if you're reading a lot of books,

3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:19.680
 are difficult, I mean, in every way,

3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:21.200
 they're all long books.

3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:26.600
 In terms of density, I would say Lila is the less,

3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:30.520
 the least dense, maybe Maps of Meaning.

3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:33.280
 I don't know, but Maps of Meaning

3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:35.760
 and Human Action are both extremely dense.

3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:40.160
 But they're just, I had to read those books very slow.

3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:42.600
 That you just have to take your time with them.

3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:44.040
 To give you an idea with Jordan Peterson,

3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:46.920
 he's said this a lot with Maps of Meaning.

3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:50.240
 He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years

3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:51.160
 to write that book.

3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:53.680
 It's probably, I think it's a 600 page book.

3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:55.720
 He said he estimates he rewrote every sentence

3:39:55.720 --> 3:39:58.920
 in the book 50 times, five, zero,

3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:01.840
 to try and get it just perfected.

3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:04.080
 And when you read these sentences,

3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:07.600
 you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.

3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:12.520
 I've used actually Anki for spaced repetition.

3:40:13.800 --> 3:40:15.560
 It's like a piece of, it's an app.

3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:17.000
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,

3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:22.000
 but it allows you to load in facts or terms

3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:24.200
 or entire paragraphs.

3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:29.200
 And then it brings them, you review them every day

3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:33.560
 and then it brings them up less and less often over time

3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:36.160
 as you show yourself being able to remember

3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:39.440
 the thing that you wanted to memorize.

3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:41.320
 And oftentimes when I'm reading,

3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:43.880
 what I want to memorize is the key idea.

3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:47.160
 But also like I use it for, I'm terrible with names.

3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:49.240
 So I'm starting to use it for names too,

3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:52.040
 names of people, names of like people

3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:53.560
 that I want to remember.

3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:56.560
 And also throughout history and also in my own personal life

3:40:56.560 --> 3:40:59.040
 but also events, you know, dates to me

3:40:59.040 --> 3:41:00.200
 are usually not important,

3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.040
 but sometimes dates are really important.

3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:04.440
 And so it's really useful.

3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:05.280
 I recommend it highly.

3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:08.680
 Naval, I think mentioned a piece of software

3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:11.560
 called Readwise or something like that,

3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:14.640
 that I hope I'm saying that correctly.

3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:16.280
 It's something like that.

3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:18.920
 And what it does is it goes to your highlights

3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:23.000
 from your Kindle or the various places

3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:27.760
 where you highlight stuff that integrates with Goodreads.

3:41:27.760 --> 3:41:29.960
 And it does the same kind of spaced repetition

3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:31.640
 but for things you've highlighted.

3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:34.760
 So it sends an email every day.

3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:38.360
 It's been really, I recommend it highly

3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:43.360
 because it sends like to me an email form,

3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:45.360
 a selection of the things I've highlighted

3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.120
 and previous things I've read.

3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:52.120
 And it's like this weird like shock to your memory

3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:56.760
 that sprinkles like I have probably way too much Orwell

3:41:56.760 --> 3:42:00.240
 in there and it just kind of like, it brings you back.

3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:03.240
 And these ideas are, because what you realize,

3:42:03.240 --> 3:42:07.280
 depending on how you highlight, but at least for me,

3:42:07.280 --> 3:42:08.880
 and I think it's probably true for a lot of people,

3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:11.360
 the things you've highlighted had at that moment

3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:13.840
 and like an emotional impact on you.

3:42:13.840 --> 3:42:16.200
 And so like these things are just like hitting you hard

3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:19.520
 again, it's like, whoa, it might not be meaningful

3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:20.720
 to anyone else except you.

3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:23.240
 And it's something I recommend.

3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:25.760
 You never know with these like hacks or tools and so on,

3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:29.440
 like what's actually BS and what is amazing.

3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:31.360
 And that one is kind of amazing.

3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:34.600
 So at least for me, it works for me and Naval.

3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:35.760
 I think he's the one.

3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:37.920
 Read wise you said. Read wise.

3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:39.920
 Or something close to that.

3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:41.480
 It could be read something else,

3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:43.680
 like read wealth or something.

3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:46.840
 The one other thing I really like,

3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:48.080
 and this is more of a new one,

3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:50.920
 is I used to always listen to music at the gym,

3:42:50.920 --> 3:42:54.280
 but now I've just, because I'm so backlogged on podcasts,

3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:59.160
 right, there's so many, I exclusively listen to podcasts

3:42:59.160 --> 3:43:00.440
 when I'm walking or when I'm at the gym,

3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:03.820
 anytime I'm doing something that I can't read basically.

3:43:03.820 --> 3:43:07.000
 And I think there's something really special

3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:09.340
 about exercise and ideation.

3:43:09.340 --> 3:43:12.360
 I mean, I don't know if this happens to everyone,

3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:14.480
 but my creative juices just go ballistic.

3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:17.520
 When I'm at the gym, like I hit a certain point of,

3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:19.480
 I guess, heart rate and you're sweating enough,

3:43:19.480 --> 3:43:21.760
 then the ideas just start to flow.

3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:25.440
 So I'm basically at the gym now listening to podcasts,

3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:28.980
 exercising as fast as I can to try to get to that state of,

3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:31.880
 you know, where you're just straining,

3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:34.320
 your strenuous exercise, I guess you would say,

3:43:34.320 --> 3:43:36.320
 and then I end up typing notes into my phone

3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:39.160
 as fast as I can with all these ideas that are flowing.

3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:42.520
 So I've created a lot of good writing out of that.

3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:43.560
 Yeah, it's kind of work.

3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:47.900
 So I do running quite a bit, so running outside,

3:43:47.900 --> 3:43:51.520
 and I'll listen to, I've been, okay,

3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:55.000
 I told myself this has been going on for about a year,

3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:00.000
 is I only listen, like the stuff that's either World War II

3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:01.840
 or World War I related.

3:44:01.840 --> 3:44:06.840
 So Hitler, Stalin, like difficult historical stuff.

3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:13.160
 And also listen to brown noise.

3:44:13.160 --> 3:44:14.480
 So those are the two modes.

3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:18.420
 So brown noise helps me, this is like white noise,

3:44:18.420 --> 3:44:22.560
 but like deeper, I guess, it helps me remove the world.

3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:24.840
 And at the gym, there's a lot of distractions.

3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:26.600
 When you're running, there's a lot of distractions.

3:44:26.600 --> 3:44:27.680
 It helps me remove the world.

3:44:27.680 --> 3:44:32.400
 So one, I'll be listening to difficult historical ideas.

3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:34.240
 And then when my mind is all of a sudden

3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:36.480
 starting to generate ideas,

3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:40.080
 I'll listen to brown noise and then force myself to think.

3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:44.400
 It's kind of, it's meditative in a sense,

3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:46.440
 and your mind wants to be lazy.

3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:51.440
 You want to, it's hard, man, like running and thinking

3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:53.720
 in the sense that some of the ideas

3:44:53.720 --> 3:44:56.240
 that come into your head are pretty heavy.

3:44:56.240 --> 3:44:59.600
 It's about your own life, your own demons come in there,

3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:01.600
 but also just difficult ideas

3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:02.920
 that require you thinking through

3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:05.440
 and persevering through that,

3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:07.120
 like not letting yourself get lazy

3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:10.480
 and thinking through it has been really for me rewarding

3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:13.920
 in the same way that you're saying it is for you.

3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:16.840
 It's true that like podcasts and music,

3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:20.920
 like shallow, like funny podcasts or music

3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:23.360
 have been a kind of filler distraction.

3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:27.000
 But informational podcasts, like podcasts

3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:30.920
 that have some depths of ideas or audio books

3:45:30.920 --> 3:45:32.600
 have been truly rewarding.

3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:34.960
 I try to listen now less and less to podcasts

3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:35.880
 that are just fun,

3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:39.600
 because I feel like I enjoy it too much

3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:41.840
 and I don't allow my mind to get bored

3:45:41.840 --> 3:45:45.000
 and to think through stuff, to explore ideas.

3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:48.200
 It's so easy to fill the space

3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:52.680
 that usually would be filled with thought

3:45:52.680 --> 3:45:55.680
 and instead fill it with fun podcasts.

3:45:55.680 --> 3:45:58.280
 Like there's a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.

3:45:58.280 --> 3:46:00.240
 So there's value to that, of course,

3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:02.200
 but you have to realize it's entertainment.

3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:07.200
 It's not, you don't get much value except entertainment.

3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:08.120
 Right, right.

3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:10.800
 And there's utility to the boredom too, I think,

3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:15.360
 where to give your mind the space,

3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:16.440
 I guess your subconscious,

3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:19.080
 maybe the space to chew on some of these problems, right?

3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:21.960
 Where you've imbibed so much knowledge,

3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:23.400
 you've highlighted and thought about something,

3:46:23.400 --> 3:46:25.720
 but then you need to stop thinking about it for a while

3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:27.920
 and let it marinate in the subconscious.

3:46:27.920 --> 3:46:30.880
 And then these flashes of insight

3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:32.080
 that people have described,

3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:33.440
 sometimes I get them in the middle of the night,

3:46:33.440 --> 3:46:35.040
 like I just wake up from a dream and have them

3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:35.880
 and I got to write it down

3:46:35.880 --> 3:46:38.760
 or sometimes just in nature taking a walk.

3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:40.440
 But I think that's very important too.

3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:44.040
 We can't just brute force our way into understanding.

3:46:44.040 --> 3:46:46.040
 There's this interplay between

3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:47.680
 kind of the brute force reading intake

3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:52.280
 and then just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored,

3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:56.120
 letting your subconscious do the heavy lifting.

3:46:56.120 --> 3:46:59.200
 And there's, you should be aware of the fact

3:46:59.200 --> 3:47:01.120
 that there's a war for your attention going on.

3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:02.720
 So there's a lot of,

3:47:02.720 --> 3:47:05.520
 there's been better and better and better mechanisms

3:47:05.520 --> 3:47:08.480
 that are designed to steal your attention.

3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:10.840
 So I kind of see it as a war zone

3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:14.080
 between my right for boredom

3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:17.240
 and the internet wanting your attention.

3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:21.960
 In fact, Clubhouse as an app has been,

3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:24.560
 I'm probably not gonna use Clubhouse much anymore.

3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:27.760
 There's some aspect of my own inner loneliness

3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:31.120
 and whatever it is that pulled me into Clubhouse

3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:33.480
 a little bit too much to where it robbed me

3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:36.400
 from that lonely time alone

3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:38.080
 where I sit and listen to Bruce Springsteen

3:47:38.080 --> 3:47:39.640
 and think about life, right?

3:47:39.640 --> 3:47:40.640
 So I wanna.

3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:41.680
 That's way more important.

3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:44.520
 That's way, well yeah, at least it's all in balance

3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:47.200
 because there is a Clubhouse like a lot

3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:48.760
 of these social networks when you use right

3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:52.120
 can be a way to discover new ideas, new people.

3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:55.160
 But the boredom is just being alone

3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:57.320
 with your thoughts is priceless.

3:47:57.320 --> 3:47:58.160
 Absolutely.

3:47:58.160 --> 3:47:59.520
 And you gotta know yourself, right?

3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:03.200
 Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude.

3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:05.320
 Like just how I'm wired, how I'm built.

3:48:05.320 --> 3:48:07.400
 I need like an hour a day solitude.

3:48:07.400 --> 3:48:08.860
 So you gotta listen to that part of yourself.

3:48:08.860 --> 3:48:11.740
 You might be compromising something like that

3:48:11.740 --> 3:48:12.960
 where you feel like you always need to be

3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:14.560
 with your girlfriend or whatever it may be.

3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:18.120
 But I would suggest listening to that voice.

3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:20.840
 Yeah, I try to, I tried to remember things

3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:23.020
 that made me feel good over time.

3:48:23.020 --> 3:48:25.400
 Like longterm had positive impact

3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:27.680
 and longterm had negative impact

3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:31.120
 and do more of the former and less of the latter.

3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:33.160
 We don't often think like that.

3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:35.560
 You know, we talked offline about like carnivore diets

3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:38.880
 for example, I try to remember

3:48:38.880 --> 3:48:40.720
 that carbs don't make me feel good.

3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:41.960
 Yeah.

3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:43.520
 In the moment it's hard to remember that.

3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:45.000
 It's hard, it's hard.

3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:47.920
 But you have to remember that that's the case.

3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:51.880
 And in the same way, exercise,

3:48:51.880 --> 3:48:54.900
 it's hard to remember that exercise makes me feel good.

3:48:56.160 --> 3:48:58.000
 Like especially when it's time to go to the gym, right?

3:48:58.000 --> 3:48:59.360
 Especially when it's time to go to the gym.

3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:00.560
 But you should remember that

3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:03.840
 because the kind of person you are without exercise,

3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:06.360
 for me, just like you beautifully said

3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:07.400
 that you have to know yourself.

3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:10.560
 The kind of person I am without exercise

3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:15.560
 is a less good person, a person I'm less proud of.

3:49:15.640 --> 3:49:16.920
 The food thing is so hard.

3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:19.840
 By the way, I still, you know,

3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:21.840
 I can't tell you how many times I've learned the lesson,

3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:23.520
 like don't eat that.

3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:25.160
 But then, you know, you go a few weeks

3:49:25.160 --> 3:49:26.960
 of not eating whatever that is,

3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:28.280
 and you're feeling good.

3:49:28.280 --> 3:49:29.840
 And then you're, I don't know,

3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:30.880
 something creeps up inside you.

3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:33.080
 Like, ah, you could just have one or you could just do this.

3:49:33.080 --> 3:49:34.160
 But for me, it's sugar.

3:49:34.160 --> 3:49:36.880
 Like sugar just makes me feel terrible.

3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:40.040
 But I always, not always, but if it's been a long time,

3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:41.560
 I start to make that exception in my mind.

3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:43.000
 Like, oh, you can have a little bit.

3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:44.120
 And then I eat it and I feel terrible.

3:49:44.120 --> 3:49:45.880
 So I don't know how many times I've done that dance,

3:49:45.880 --> 3:49:47.400
 but it's not cool.

3:49:47.400 --> 3:49:48.760
 Well, it depends on how painful it is

3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:49.960
 and then you learn the lesson.

3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:51.800
 I actually embraced the fact

3:49:51.800 --> 3:49:54.560
 that I'll never learn the lesson with vodka.

3:49:54.560 --> 3:49:57.720
 Every time I drink, especially with Russians,

3:49:57.720 --> 3:50:00.280
 is like, I quit drinking every time.

3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:02.880
 And then I forget, there's like a slow drop off.

3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:05.000
 It'll be like two weeks and then.

3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:05.840
 Na zdorovie.

3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:08.560
 Na zdorovie, very good.

3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:12.040
 So it never makes you feel good.

3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:13.800
 It never results in anything good

3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:20.040
 except the beautiful social chaos,

3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:24.680
 which is ultimately somehow, there's value to chaos too.

3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:25.720
 There's value to that.

3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:29.120
 Whatever the hell stupid stuff you do when you get trashed.

3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:32.840
 The over the top emotion of love usually

3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:36.160
 or whatever camaraderie, there's value to that too.

3:50:36.160 --> 3:50:39.600
 Like as I get older, I realize,

3:50:39.600 --> 3:50:43.040
 because the world,

3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:44.400
 sometimes especially when you get older

3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:46.360
 and the world wants you to be an adult,

3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:49.440
 in order to maintain the youthful spirit,

3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:51.720
 you have to use all the tools you can.

3:50:51.720 --> 3:50:53.680
 Alcohol is one of them.

3:50:53.680 --> 3:50:55.480
 To do all the stupid shit you can,

3:50:55.480 --> 3:50:57.920
 even if you're like getting older.

3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:00.000
 To lower the inhibitions.

3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:01.920
 Again, it's that taste of uncertainty

3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:03.440
 that is the sweetness of life, right?

3:51:03.440 --> 3:51:06.520
 To be able to go out and be a flaneur at a party

3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:08.160
 and not really know what you're gonna do.

3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:12.800
 And we have this draw to the wild side of life.

3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:15.400
 As much as we try and build up order around ourselves,

3:51:15.400 --> 3:51:18.560
 I think there's always gonna be an appetite for that.

3:51:18.560 --> 3:51:21.080
 I've always, most of my life,

3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:23.000
 I've always been a social drinker,

3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:25.280
 but I actually gave up alcohol a year ago.

3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:29.360
 And I would add that to the idea,

3:51:30.880 --> 3:51:33.160
 the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas

3:51:33.160 --> 3:51:37.720
 because alcohol is fun, it's amazing, good times.

3:51:39.240 --> 3:51:42.320
 It can be analgesic, it can give you all these benefits

3:51:42.320 --> 3:51:43.880
 if you use the right amounts.

3:51:43.880 --> 3:51:46.520
 But I got to the point personally

3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:48.400
 where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas

3:51:48.400 --> 3:51:50.280
 that are just so much bigger than me.

3:51:50.280 --> 3:51:52.400
 And I have this backlog of books

3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:55.160
 that was growing faster than I could read them

3:51:55.160 --> 3:51:57.320
 that I just reached a point where I decided

3:51:58.400 --> 3:52:01.520
 I wanted to start making sacrifices toward attaining that.

3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:03.680
 And alcohol was just an easy one.

3:52:03.680 --> 3:52:04.800
 It's you spend,

3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:08.160
 even if you just drink socially on the weekends,

3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:12.280
 you're probably spending five to 10 hours drinking

3:52:12.280 --> 3:52:13.560
 and then maybe another, what?

3:52:13.560 --> 3:52:17.120
 Five to 10 hours recovering perhaps on the day after.

3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:23.000
 So it was a difficult transition initially,

3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:25.880
 but once you get through a couple of months,

3:52:25.880 --> 3:52:27.200
 I feel amazing without it.

3:52:27.200 --> 3:52:28.760
 I sleep better than ever.

3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:30.680
 My workouts are better than ever.

3:52:30.680 --> 3:52:31.640
 I'm sharper than ever.

3:52:31.640 --> 3:52:33.040
 I'm more lucid.

3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:35.840
 So I'm not trying to be a proponent for not drinking,

3:52:35.840 --> 3:52:36.680
 but I just want to say.

3:52:36.680 --> 3:52:38.200
 But you're a proponent for sacrifice.

3:52:38.200 --> 3:52:40.840
 I am a big proponent for sacrifice, yes.

3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:43.680
 Is there advice you would give to a young person today

3:52:43.680 --> 3:52:45.280
 curious about Bitcoin,

3:52:45.280 --> 3:52:49.400
 curious about how they succeed in the world

3:52:50.560 --> 3:52:55.440
 or both career wise and just in life in general?

3:52:55.440 --> 3:52:58.360
 I mean, the strongest piece of advice I have for,

3:52:58.360 --> 3:53:01.120
 this is beyond just Bitcoin.

3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:05.920
 This is you managing your own personal and financial affairs

3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:09.920
 is that you need to invest in knowledge first.

3:53:11.640 --> 3:53:15.720
 It's not good enough to just follow the crowd

3:53:15.720 --> 3:53:20.040
 and buy a 60, 40 portfolio and put it in a Roth RA

3:53:20.040 --> 3:53:22.120
 and plan on social security.

3:53:22.120 --> 3:53:25.640
 I mean, the world's changing much faster

3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:28.920
 than any existing institution

3:53:28.920 --> 3:53:31.160
 is going to be able to keep up with.

3:53:31.160 --> 3:53:33.400
 So that's why I like,

3:53:33.400 --> 3:53:34.600
 I mean, that's why I named the show,

3:53:34.600 --> 3:53:35.600
 the question, what is money?

3:53:35.600 --> 3:53:38.960
 Like, I think that to me is the rabbit

3:53:38.960 --> 3:53:40.240
 that took me down the rabbit holes.

3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:43.880
 Like just asking that question naturally progressed

3:53:43.880 --> 3:53:45.040
 to these other questions.

3:53:45.040 --> 3:53:46.160
 Like what is value?

3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:47.160
 What is government?

3:53:47.160 --> 3:53:50.320
 What is the purpose of society?

3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:52.360
 Speech, all of these things.

3:53:52.360 --> 3:53:57.360
 So I would encourage people to arm yourself

3:53:57.480 --> 3:53:58.600
 with knowledge and study.

3:53:58.600 --> 3:54:01.600
 And like that, a lot of financial people

3:54:01.600 --> 3:54:04.200
 always give you a line of advice

3:54:04.200 --> 3:54:06.000
 and then say, this is not financial advice.

3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:07.600
 I'm like, this is financial advice.

3:54:07.600 --> 3:54:10.520
 Like study, study, learn.

3:54:12.040 --> 3:54:13.200
 Knowledge is power.

3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:14.040
 Yeah.

3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:16.040
 This is official financial advice.

3:54:16.040 --> 3:54:19.120
 And you're exercising your divine trait,

3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:22.320
 which is the logos, right?

3:54:22.320 --> 3:54:24.920
 That we are these animals

3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:26.440
 that can tell and believe stories.

3:54:26.440 --> 3:54:28.960
 So it feels like almost a sacred duty

3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:31.680
 to really sharpen that part of ourselves

3:54:31.680 --> 3:54:34.160
 and use it to create the best world possible.

3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:39.000
 And then the second one was the,

3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:40.560
 I think health and fitness stuff.

3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:45.560
 I was, maybe everyone does this in their 20s.

3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:49.440
 They just live a little fast and beat themselves up.

3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:54.120
 Not that I wasn't, like I was living well

3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:58.280
 and successful by a lot of measures,

3:54:58.280 --> 3:55:00.360
 but I wish I had maybe got my act together

3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:01.360
 a little bit sooner.

3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:05.240
 I just think.

3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:07.480
 Health wise, morality wise.

3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:11.320
 Yeah, drinking, I think morality and eating.

3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:14.840
 I just was kind of doing whatever I wanted in some ways.

3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:15.680
 Let's say.

3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:18.000
 Is there a value to a trajectory

3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:19.880
 that includes a lot of mistakes?

3:55:19.880 --> 3:55:22.520
 So maybe you're supposed to make the mistakes in your 20s.

3:55:22.520 --> 3:55:23.360
 That's a great point.

3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:25.480
 Maybe the 20s are all about the mistakes.

3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:27.000
 Accumulate the most mistakes possible.

3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:28.000
 Yeah, I don't.

3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:30.640
 As quickly as possible.

3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:32.240
 I don't regret any of it,

3:55:32.240 --> 3:55:35.600
 but now that I'm kind of in this place where I feel good

3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:37.680
 and I know the value of a good night's sleep

3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:42.240
 and just, I've more deeply explored my own potential

3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:44.120
 that I feel maybe a little regretful

3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:46.160
 that I didn't do this earlier is all I'm saying.

3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:50.560
 So maybe just exploring different sides of yourself.

3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:52.640
 See what it's like to go and make a bunch of mistakes

3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:53.920
 and be wild and crazy

3:55:53.920 --> 3:55:55.360
 and then maybe try to walk the straight and narrow

3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:58.360
 for a few months and just see what it's like.

3:55:58.360 --> 3:56:02.120
 There's probably a guy doing vodka shots right now

3:56:02.120 --> 3:56:03.960
 listening to this podcast with his buddies

3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:07.520
 and if you are, please take a shot for us

3:56:07.520 --> 3:56:11.240
 for all the mistakes you should make in your 20s.

3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:15.600
 And what about love?

3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:21.880
 We talked about money is ultimately a mechanism

3:56:21.880 --> 3:56:26.880
 by which you can pave a moral path through life.

3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:31.720
 To me, one of the purest expressions

3:56:31.720 --> 3:56:36.080
 that is love broadly defined for a family, for others,

3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:38.080
 for knowledge, for the world,

3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:40.840
 is basically an optimistic open view to the world

3:56:40.840 --> 3:56:44.800
 that embraces all that is beautiful about this world.

3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:49.800
 So do you think about love often in a personal sense,

3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:54.920
 romantic, family, friendship, and in the broad sense

3:56:54.920 --> 3:56:58.400
 about its value in a successful life?

3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:01.440
 Yeah, of course.

3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:04.600
 I'm blessed to have a two and a half year old daughter

3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:09.160
 and love is a word we throw around.

3:57:09.160 --> 3:57:11.400
 I love these potato chips, I love you, man.

3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:12.760
 I love you, my daughter.

3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:15.560
 It's got so many different intensities,

3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:16.600
 I guess you might say.

3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:21.920
 I don't know, my intuition is that

3:57:23.480 --> 3:57:27.200
 it is something very fundamental to the universe.

3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:29.120
 Again, I know words don't do it justice,

3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:33.280
 but if we just proxy love with selfless action,

3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:38.400
 the whole damn universe is selflessly acting, right?

3:57:38.400 --> 3:57:43.400
 It's just unfolding and it may sound a bit hippy dippy,

3:57:43.760 --> 3:57:45.160
 but my intuition is just that love

3:57:45.160 --> 3:57:47.520
 is the core of it somehow.

3:57:48.920 --> 3:57:51.920
 I don't have anything to back that up really, it's just.

3:57:51.920 --> 3:57:55.160
 In the way you're framing it, it's making me think

3:57:55.160 --> 3:58:00.040
 that love, we talked about sort of meditation,

3:58:00.040 --> 3:58:05.040
 is as opposed to thinking from an egocentric perspective

3:58:05.680 --> 3:58:08.280
 of you, the individual operating in this world,

3:58:08.280 --> 3:58:10.960
 is allowing you to be empathetic towards the world

3:58:10.960 --> 3:58:13.440
 and thereby think of the universe,

3:58:13.440 --> 3:58:15.840
 think of the world acting through you.

3:58:15.840 --> 3:58:20.680
 Almost like accepting this notion that ideas have you,

3:58:20.680 --> 3:58:21.800
 you don't have ideas,

3:58:22.840 --> 3:58:25.240
 that you're not existing in the universe,

3:58:25.240 --> 3:58:27.240
 the universe is existing through you.

3:58:27.240 --> 3:58:32.240
 It's sort of like, that's what selfless in that context means

3:58:32.400 --> 3:58:34.600
 is like embracing that thought.

3:58:34.600 --> 3:58:36.560
 That's a weird thought.

3:58:36.560 --> 3:58:38.640
 It's a weird thought that we're just here for a little bit

3:58:38.640 --> 3:58:43.640
 of time, these meat vehicles, receptacles,

3:58:45.120 --> 3:58:50.120
 and this much bigger thing is just using us,

3:58:51.560 --> 3:58:55.960
 not in a malevolent way, but just like a river flows,

3:58:55.960 --> 3:58:59.160
 is using us to create more and more beautiful things.

3:58:59.160 --> 3:59:01.920
 Yes, yes, more and more beautiful things.

3:59:01.920 --> 3:59:06.120
 We are the universe experiencing itself, frankly, right?

3:59:06.120 --> 3:59:06.960
 So.

3:59:06.960 --> 3:59:08.160
 That's a trippy thought, man.

3:59:08.160 --> 3:59:09.480
 Yeah.

3:59:09.480 --> 3:59:12.200
 That in some sense the universe created us

3:59:12.200 --> 3:59:13.800
 to experience itself.

3:59:13.800 --> 3:59:17.800
 And we are one of the highest forms of beauty

3:59:17.800 --> 3:59:19.280
 that nature has created, right?

3:59:19.280 --> 3:59:23.320
 If we just think one of the most complex

3:59:23.320 --> 3:59:26.640
 and adaptive thing, we're a reflection of nature.

3:59:26.640 --> 3:59:30.440
 And another thing that comes to mind here is that

3:59:30.440 --> 3:59:35.440
 Dalio has this quote where he says, truth or more accurately,

3:59:36.360 --> 3:59:39.600
 an accurate depiction of reality is necessary

3:59:39.600 --> 3:59:41.200
 for any good outcome.

3:59:42.400 --> 3:59:47.400
 So when we think that love or value is primary,

3:59:47.400 --> 3:59:49.880
 I think that too reinforces this thesis

3:59:49.880 --> 3:59:54.840
 that acting out of love or acting out of proper moral action,

3:59:54.840 --> 3:59:58.320
 you're best reflecting the fundamental nature of reality.

3:59:58.320 --> 4:00:01.040
 Therefore, you're best creating the best possible outcomes

4:00:01.040 --> 4:00:02.200
 or the things of the most beauty,

4:00:02.200 --> 4:00:03.920
 whether that's your artistic expression,

4:00:03.920 --> 4:00:06.480
 your children, your business, whatever it is.

4:00:07.960 --> 4:00:09.640
 And Jordan Peterson goes deep into that

4:00:09.640 --> 4:00:12.640
 where you have to listen to that sense of meaning

4:00:12.640 --> 4:00:13.640
 in your life.

4:00:13.640 --> 4:00:15.280
 Or you might have some decision on paper

4:00:15.280 --> 4:00:18.280
 that's so great this way, but your heart says no,

4:00:18.280 --> 4:00:19.600
 your heart says otherwise.

4:00:22.040 --> 4:00:24.160
 I've tried to listen to my heart throughout

4:00:24.160 --> 4:00:26.440
 and I think that creates the best outcomes.

4:00:26.440 --> 4:00:30.240
 But nevertheless, does it make you sad

4:00:30.240 --> 4:00:34.400
 that you in particular, Robert,

4:00:34.400 --> 4:00:36.080
 are gonna be dead pretty soon?

4:00:38.160 --> 4:00:42.280
 As we talk about scarcity, one of the certain things

4:00:42.280 --> 4:00:45.920
 that ensure the scarcity of the human experience

4:00:45.920 --> 4:00:48.440
 is the fact that you and your consciousness

4:00:48.440 --> 4:00:51.480
 are gonna be done, they have a deadline.

4:00:51.480 --> 4:00:54.320
 Only time and Bitcoin are absolutely scarce.

4:00:54.320 --> 4:00:59.320
 I'm fortunate, I guess I got started

4:01:03.200 --> 4:01:05.480
 on this philosophical journey a bit when I was younger,

4:01:05.480 --> 4:01:09.840
 but I got into Musashi and Sun Tzu quite a bit,

4:01:11.280 --> 4:01:13.800
 who wrote, Musashi wrote the Book of Five Rings,

4:01:16.160 --> 4:01:17.400
 Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War.

4:01:17.400 --> 4:01:19.880
 And one of the things that, I mean,

4:01:19.880 --> 4:01:22.880
 these guys were just absolute beasts.

4:01:22.880 --> 4:01:24.440
 They lived and died by the sword

4:01:24.440 --> 4:01:28.880
 and they were just very great equanimity

4:01:28.880 --> 4:01:30.240
 about all things in life.

4:01:30.240 --> 4:01:32.880
 And I also found this kind of in the stoic philosophy

4:01:32.880 --> 4:01:37.440
 where they just are very cool with everything.

4:01:37.440 --> 4:01:40.560
 And one of the lines there is that the way of the warrior

4:01:40.560 --> 4:01:42.440
 is the resolute acceptance of death.

4:01:43.560 --> 4:01:45.120
 And so I've always tried to think about that.

4:01:45.120 --> 4:01:46.920
 Like, of course I experienced fear,

4:01:46.920 --> 4:01:51.800
 I experienced everything that you do on a meat suit, right?

4:01:51.800 --> 4:01:53.280
 Like anxiety and all the things,

4:01:53.280 --> 4:01:58.280
 but I always try to have that higher order view of myself

4:01:58.320 --> 4:02:02.640
 and that it's just a certain experience occurring

4:02:02.640 --> 4:02:03.680
 at a certain level,

4:02:03.680 --> 4:02:06.960
 but it shouldn't override your kind of highest order self.

4:02:06.960 --> 4:02:09.720
 That's just resolutely accepted death

4:02:09.720 --> 4:02:13.520
 and that this is your one play in life.

4:02:13.520 --> 4:02:18.520
 So hopefully that propels me towards proper action.

4:02:18.520 --> 4:02:23.520
 I think scarcity cannot help, but lead to something good.

4:02:25.040 --> 4:02:26.760
 Just like with this conversation,

4:02:26.760 --> 4:02:29.280
 sadly must come to an end.

4:02:29.280 --> 4:02:31.400
 The scarcity of it is what makes it beautiful.

4:02:31.400 --> 4:02:34.880
 So Robert, this was one of my favorite conversations

4:02:35.920 --> 4:02:40.040
 philosophically and in every other level,

4:02:40.040 --> 4:02:44.360
 just the ideas and the way you express them around Bitcoin,

4:02:44.360 --> 4:02:47.100
 around morality, around money.

4:02:47.100 --> 4:02:51.260
 Has been really inspiring and really educational.

4:02:51.260 --> 4:02:54.120
 And I'm glad you're out there fighting the good fight.

4:02:54.120 --> 4:02:57.020
 And I'm glad you're wasting all of this time with me.

4:02:57.020 --> 4:02:58.340
 It was really fun.

4:02:58.340 --> 4:03:01.680
 And thank you for coming down to Texas

4:03:01.680 --> 4:03:05.020
 and having some good old brisket together.

4:03:05.020 --> 4:03:06.580
 This was really fun, man.

4:03:06.580 --> 4:03:07.920
 This was awesome.

4:03:07.920 --> 4:03:09.980
 Thanks for having me, man.

4:03:09.980 --> 4:03:11.660
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

4:03:11.660 --> 4:03:13.060
 with Robert Breedlove.

4:03:13.060 --> 4:03:18.060
 And thank you to Fundrise, Element, Mugpack, and BetterHelp.

4:03:18.540 --> 4:03:21.980
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

4:03:21.980 --> 4:03:24.060
 And now let me leave you with some words

4:03:24.060 --> 4:03:26.420
 from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

4:03:26.420 --> 4:03:29.940
 "'Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness.

4:03:29.940 --> 4:03:33.620
 "'The resilient resists shocks and stay the same.

4:03:33.620 --> 4:03:36.420
 "'The antifragile gets better.'"

4:03:36.420 --> 4:03:41.420
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
