00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Tom Brands,

00:02.640 --> 00:06.640
 Olympic champion and world champion in freestyle wrestling,

00:06.640 --> 00:10.320
 three time NCAA wrestling champion at University of Iowa,

00:10.320 --> 00:14.080
 and one of the greatest coaches in the history of wrestling,

00:14.080 --> 00:18.160
 leading the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for 15 years,

00:18.160 --> 00:22.960
 including in 2021 winning the national championships,

00:22.960 --> 00:26.640
 and getting a coach of the year award, his third.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.320
 He's known for his intensity, focus, and mental toughness,

00:30.320 --> 00:33.120
 embodying both as a wrestler and coach,

00:33.120 --> 00:36.480
 the culture and spirit of Iowa wrestling.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.520
 We recorded this conversation almost exactly three years ago

00:39.520 --> 00:42.400
 after I attended the University of Iowa

00:42.400 --> 00:45.280
 versus Iowa State wrestling meet

00:45.280 --> 00:48.400
 in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.880
 Tom graciously invited me to his home,

00:50.880 --> 00:54.160
 where his family, a couple of friends, and me

00:54.160 --> 00:57.680
 spent several hours chatting about wrestling and life.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.520
 We recorded this brief podcast conversation that evening,

01:01.520 --> 01:06.080
 and I wasn't sure where, how, or whether we'll publish it.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.880
 But returning to it now three years later,

01:08.880 --> 01:12.000
 I realized just how meaningful that evening was for me.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.320
 And even though I was nervous,

01:14.320 --> 01:16.400
 didn't even put on my jacket,

01:16.400 --> 01:19.360
 it's a moment I would love to share with others.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.840
 The mix of intensity and heartfelt kindness

01:21.840 --> 01:23.440
 from Tom and his family

01:23.440 --> 01:26.080
 made me want to stay in Iowa forever.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.480
 I think I will return there soon enough

01:28.480 --> 01:30.560
 because of the amazing people there,

01:30.560 --> 01:34.160
 and because Iowa is still, in many ways,

01:34.160 --> 01:37.920
 the heart of the indomitable spirit of American wrestling,

01:37.920 --> 01:41.200
 a sport I love and to which I'm deeply grateful

01:41.200 --> 01:43.200
 for humbling me early in life

01:43.200 --> 01:46.080
 and helping me and many others

01:46.080 --> 01:49.840
 build character through hard work.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.000
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.240
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:54.240 --> 01:55.360
 in the description.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.040
 And now here's my conversation with Tom Brands.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.360
 What's the best motivator for you or for your athletes?

02:04.160 --> 02:07.040
 Hatred of losing or love of winning?

02:08.160 --> 02:10.560
 For me personally, it was definitely the hatred of losing.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.040
 I was not a guy that was about pageantry.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.240
 I was not a guy that was about the parade.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.240
 When I wrestled in Atlanta,

02:20.240 --> 02:22.800
 I rented a three cylinder Geo with my wife,

02:22.800 --> 02:23.920
 drove home and mowed the lawn

02:23.920 --> 02:25.360
 because it hadn't been mowed for a month.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.000
 And I remember one of our neighbors driving by

02:28.000 --> 02:29.600
 and they were like, they did a double take,

02:29.600 --> 02:31.920
 like, well, that's the, I thought he was in Atlanta.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.120
 Well, I was in Atlanta yesterday.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.080
 I just sat on the stand

02:34.080 --> 02:35.600
 and got a gold medal put around my neck.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.920
 That's how I was.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.160
 That doesn't mean that it was the right approach

02:40.160 --> 02:41.120
 or the wrong approach.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.640
 It's just what worked for me.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.560
 But when you were a kid, you and Terry,

02:44.560 --> 02:46.800
 you dreamed about winning that Olympic gold.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.360
 Yeah, so.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.400
 That's about winning then.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.000
 So there is the lure of winning,

02:52.000 --> 02:53.920
 but what drives you is that,

02:55.520 --> 02:56.720
 you know, as you move forward,

02:56.720 --> 03:01.120
 there's just no reason that you have to settle

03:01.120 --> 03:02.400
 for anything but being the best.

03:03.120 --> 03:07.440
 And if, it just, it would get to you to the point where

03:08.000 --> 03:09.360
 that's not gonna happen to me again.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.120
 So what, the thing that keeps you up at night

03:13.120 --> 03:15.360
 is the losses and that's not,

03:15.360 --> 03:17.120
 that's not gonna happen to me again.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.800
 That's the thought that keeps you up at night.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.440
 That's the thought that drives you in your training.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.480
 That's why you do, you know, nine ropes

03:24.480 --> 03:27.520
 when Gable says do three ropes and buddy pushups

03:27.520 --> 03:29.360
 and you're out of here and you do nine

03:29.360 --> 03:31.200
 or you do them until you can't do any more.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.320
 And it's a very rare ingredient.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.320
 The older I get, the more rare I find it is.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.560
 The ingredient of loss feeding,

03:41.680 --> 03:44.240
 feeding that, the drive of hard training?

03:44.240 --> 03:46.240
 Maybe that because everybody's so worried

03:46.240 --> 03:48.320
 about the negative whatever

03:48.320 --> 03:50.480
 and you're putting too much pressure on yourself.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.600
 So maybe that.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.760
 But what I meant was it's when a coach says,

03:53.760 --> 03:56.960
 okay, finish with four ropes and, you know,

03:56.960 --> 04:00.240
 buddy pushups and four way neck, you know,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.640
 I would do 12 or 10.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.760
 That's rare.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.280
 It's no longer about what the coach says.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.680
 It's your own demons that you're trying to exercise out.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.640
 What's the few losses you've had in your life?

04:12.640 --> 04:16.160
 Are all of them just melt together

04:16.160 --> 04:18.160
 or is there something that stands out in your mind?

04:18.160 --> 04:22.560
 I'm a guy that remembers my career that well.

04:23.680 --> 04:29.680
 I know that I am judged on a very small portion of my life

04:29.680 --> 04:32.320
 and that's minutes of wrestling matches,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.920
 you know, a lot of winning,

04:33.920 --> 04:35.440
 but there's some losing in there too.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.640
 And, you know, people think they know you because of that

04:38.640 --> 04:40.480
 and they think they know you

04:40.480 --> 04:42.080
 because they see you in a press conference.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.920
 But, you know, to go back to the original question,

04:47.440 --> 04:49.040
 you know, I don't know how to answer that.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.440
 So there's no losses that just that eat at you still.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.280
 There's opponents that I have learned a great deal from.

04:57.280 --> 05:02.080
 I mean, my loss to John Smith in 1991,

05:02.880 --> 05:07.360
 US Open was something that I learned a lot about.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.680
 I learned a lot about positioning.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.400
 I learned a lot about the importance of par terre.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.240
 You know, in a certain kind of crazy way,

05:16.240 --> 05:18.240
 I learned that I could go with the best guy in the world,

05:18.240 --> 05:19.520
 even though it was 14 to four.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.720
 And this is when Tech Falls were 15 or 12 points.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.280
 I didn't get Tech Fall and that wasn't a badge of honor for me.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.280
 But I knew I could go with him

05:27.280 --> 05:28.560
 because it was one point takedowns.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.840
 I scored four takedowns on him.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.280
 And I learned that I had to move my feet

05:34.480 --> 05:37.680
 and I learned what it meant to move your feet constantly.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.520
 And there's no break.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.440
 John Smith is a very, very intense competitor

05:43.440 --> 05:47.120
 that people know that now, six time world Olympic champion.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.720
 And I felt that firsthand.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.440
 But I did not go in there taking a back seat,

05:53.440 --> 05:57.360
 even though the score was very lopsided.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.520
 But you knew you could stand with the best of the world.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.040
 I knew that this is what this is about.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.640
 And you know what, you move your feet

06:04.640 --> 06:07.760
 and you don't give up a lace that's so damn tight

06:07.760 --> 06:10.640
 that you can't feel your calf muscle.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.960
 And I had to get ready for the consolation

06:12.960 --> 06:13.680
 side of the bracket,

06:13.680 --> 06:15.040
 because I believe that was in the semis.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.640
 And you just learn from that.

06:18.640 --> 06:23.520
 And it was better than learning from a win

06:23.520 --> 06:26.320
 over a second ranked senior level guy

06:26.320 --> 06:27.520
 when you're a junior in college.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.040
 You're wrestling the best on a stage.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.960
 So if you look back, you probably spent tens of thousands

06:34.960 --> 06:38.560
 of hours on the mat, spilled sweat, blood,

06:39.280 --> 06:41.600
 even tears, maybe, maybe a few times.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.760
 So technically or philosophically,

06:43.760 --> 06:45.840
 how would you do any of those hours differently?

06:45.840 --> 06:49.200
 Just looking back at the tens of thousands of hours.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.440
 I would be more, probably in my older age,

06:53.440 --> 06:56.080
 I probably would have been more relaxed in my training

06:56.800 --> 06:59.040
 and probably would have went another cycle.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.640
 If I could do it over again, in 96,

07:02.640 --> 07:05.680
 I really thought that when Gable retired,

07:05.680 --> 07:07.040
 that I would be the next guy in line.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.800
 And I was wrong and that was immature of me.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.720
 In terms of the coach.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.480
 In terms of the coach, yes.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.240
 And I knew that Gable was close.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.480
 I mean, I didn't know when, but it just so happens,

07:16.480 --> 07:18.560
 you know, 97 was his record breaking year

07:18.560 --> 07:21.760
 and then he retired, but I didn't know how close he was.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.760
 But I knew that he had, you know,

07:23.760 --> 07:25.760
 he went down with a bad hip injury.

07:25.760 --> 07:29.120
 And so, you know, you're just, you're not gonna.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.280
 So what does a relaxed Tom Brands look like?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.680
 You're saying you would have been a little more relaxed.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.040
 More like where, you know what, I was pretty dang good

07:39.040 --> 07:40.880
 and I was getting better every day,

07:41.440 --> 07:43.760
 but maybe doing a little bit different, a little bit smarter.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.680
 And Terry actually did that going through 2000.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.680
 He had to do it.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.280
 And he would have been in the, you know,

07:53.280 --> 07:58.560
 the funny farm, let alone the, you know, the physical farm,

07:58.560 --> 08:02.000
 whatever you want to say, mentally and physically beat up.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.840
 But he had to learn to less is more type approach.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.400
 And how it came around was, is, you know,

08:12.400 --> 08:14.160
 you work hard at feeling good.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.720
 You work hard in your recovery.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.440
 So even when you're not wrestling hard in that wrestling room,

08:21.440 --> 08:25.760
 and looking for the toughest partner to go,

08:25.760 --> 08:28.720
 you're still working hard in your recovery.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.480
 And massage could be that.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.240
 Stretching could be that.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.480
 Things like that, that are more fluffy.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.520
 And that's something you weren't as good at?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.120
 The recovery aspect of this?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.080
 Never, never.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.800
 There's not a place for it with young people.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.280
 Because in my opinion, there's so much development to have,

08:49.280 --> 08:51.600
 there's so much development to have happened.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.280
 I mean, when you need to learn wrestling,

08:55.280 --> 08:56.320
 you need to be wrestling.

08:57.760 --> 09:02.240
 And as you get older, your body won't do it anymore.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.920
 And so to learn wrestling, it's more of a,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.440
 probably a relaxed approach.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.400
 So if you had to choose between two athletes

09:11.760 --> 09:14.320
 who would dominate competition,

09:14.320 --> 09:17.920
 one who drills 100,000 reps of a specific take down,

09:17.920 --> 09:22.240
 specific technique, or one that spends that time live wrestling?

09:22.240 --> 09:24.240
 Both, it's the same.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.920
 And I like to live wrestling,

09:25.920 --> 09:27.520
 I was always wanting to live wrestle,

09:27.520 --> 09:29.600
 bring the warm up into the live wrestle, let's go.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.600
 But where I got really, really good was a repetition.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.200
 And I was disciplined enough to know that the things

09:37.200 --> 09:40.240
 that you hate to do in this sport

09:40.240 --> 09:42.080
 are the things that make you the very best.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.760
 And that is a rare ingredient as I've gotten older.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.920
 And you spend a lot of time communicating that

09:47.920 --> 09:49.120
 to younger athletes.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.280
 So the thing, if you feel yourself hating something,

09:53.280 --> 09:55.280
 that's probably the thing you should be doing.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.080
 Yes, as a matter of fact,

09:56.080 --> 09:57.680
 I had a strength coach when I was really young.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.800
 He was just a fricking guy that would,

10:01.360 --> 10:04.480
 he wore white, like he was almost like a nurse,

10:04.480 --> 10:05.680
 nurses clothes.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.920
 He wore all white from head to toe.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.680
 And he was in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.840
 And his first name was Walt.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.280
 And he taught Terry and I to hate the bar away from you

10:15.280 --> 10:16.800
 on that last rep when you're dead.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.280
 And whether it's a curl, you hate it up.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.920
 And then you do the negative and you hate it down

10:21.920 --> 10:23.920
 and you hate that bench up and you hate it.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.760
 You look at the bar and you hate it away from you.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.560
 So I learned and I was young, I was young.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.880
 And I remember being born, my mom's sister lived out there

10:34.880 --> 10:36.720
 and we were dropped off to stay out there with our cousins.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.320
 And I was born a little bit.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.840
 And they always treated us really good.

10:39.840 --> 10:45.360
 But this was like the single most bright spot

10:45.360 --> 10:48.160
 in a weightlifting, like enlightenment,

10:48.160 --> 10:49.440
 even though I lifted weights.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.880
 But I never knew the psychology behind lifting weights.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.800
 It's just to look good and so you can flex

10:54.800 --> 10:56.720
 and look in the mirror or is it for performance?

10:57.280 --> 10:58.880
 And this guy was about performance.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.840
 And you said repetition.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.280
 Do you mean technique?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.520
 I'm talking repetition, technique, technique, technique,

11:05.520 --> 11:07.760
 drill, drill, drill, hit, hit, hit, drive, finish,

11:07.760 --> 11:08.960
 hit, hit, hit, drive, finish.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.320
 So you believe in that.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.000
 I believe in that wholeheartedly.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.080
 And I believe that you have to do it on your own.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.640
 I don't believe in the coach taking you to the promised land.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.680
 So in the guys today or in yourself,

11:25.680 --> 11:29.840
 how often do you see people that grow the belief

11:29.840 --> 11:32.400
 of doing 10,000, 20,000 reps?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.520
 I think it's rare.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.480
 I think it's very rare.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.080
 And I think it's especially rare.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.680
 I mean, you can talk about that as a coach,

11:37.680 --> 11:42.320
 but it's especially rare to bring a guy to that understanding,

11:42.320 --> 11:43.920
 but you never stop trying.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.520
 You're always trying to reach him.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.280
 I mean, we didn't have a good performance out there tonight,

11:49.280 --> 11:50.800
 but you know what?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.080
 You don't stop communicating.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.080
 And there's a lot of programs out there

11:56.080 --> 11:59.120
 that put their head down when things aren't going their way.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.560
 And then as things start going their way,

12:00.560 --> 12:01.920
 then they rise with the tide.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.840
 There was no difference in the demeanor of our corner.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.160
 And we talk about that, that's a philosophy.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.000
 And so you're reaching your guys that way.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.840
 So go back to your point or your question.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.800
 Do you believe in the 10,000 reps?

12:16.800 --> 12:17.600
 And yes, I do.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.560
 How do you inspire people to do that?

12:20.560 --> 12:23.120
 So by example, but communication.

12:23.120 --> 12:28.240
 But I mean, in my experience, what I've seen communicating

12:28.240 --> 12:30.400
 the value of repetition and drilling

12:30.400 --> 12:31.440
 is a hard thing to communicate.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.000
 It's hard.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.800
 And it's very rare to have somebody that goes in there

12:34.800 --> 12:36.720
 and will do it on their own.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.200
 Do you have young guys that step up and do that?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.120
 We do, and it's rare.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.960
 And the guys that do it on their own

12:42.960 --> 12:44.080
 and have done it on their own

12:44.080 --> 12:47.600
 are the guys that are in that lineup and doing well.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.600
 The other thing is that when you talk about

12:52.240 --> 12:53.520
 getting to that next level,

12:54.880 --> 12:58.320
 a lot of times what held you back

12:58.320 --> 13:01.600
 was I did everything the coach asked of me and nothing more.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.440
 Right.

13:03.440 --> 13:08.320
 I mean, you can be a great guy for a coach as an athlete,

13:09.120 --> 13:10.800
 and you did everything that coach asked,

13:10.800 --> 13:12.000
 but you did nothing more.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.800
 So you're really looking for the guys

13:14.800 --> 13:17.440
 that go way beyond what the coach says.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.080
 We don't want guys that are looking at their watch

13:20.080 --> 13:21.920
 running out of the room when practice is over.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.040
 We want guys that know what they have to get done,

13:25.040 --> 13:26.240
 and they might leave early,

13:26.960 --> 13:28.720
 but they're not looking at their watch.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.600
 They might be done early.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.560
 They might be, we might be on a whole different path,

13:32.560 --> 13:34.640
 and this guy just excuses himself.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.680
 I'm all about that.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.800
 We are not autocrats.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.320
 There's an internal engine in there.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.680
 Is that something you're born with,

13:42.240 --> 13:43.760
 or is that something you can develop?

13:43.760 --> 13:45.440
 I think you are born with it.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.960
 You develop it also,

13:46.960 --> 13:48.880
 and I think that there has to be comfort,

13:48.880 --> 13:50.320
 and I go back to communication,

13:50.880 --> 13:55.600
 that young people are comfortable enough to communicate

13:55.600 --> 13:57.360
 that I need to take the day off.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.320
 So what do you mean by communication?

14:00.320 --> 14:00.880
 Or I need to do something different.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.480
 Communication, exactly.

14:02.480 --> 14:07.120
 So letting athletes be part of their own development.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.480
 Communication to me is letting them know

14:11.760 --> 14:15.040
 what they need to do to get themselves in contention

14:15.040 --> 14:16.240
 to be the starting quarterback,

14:18.080 --> 14:22.720
 and then to give them boosts and compliments

14:22.720 --> 14:23.760
 when they earn them,

14:23.760 --> 14:31.760
 and I don't have time to waste with lies and cheating.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.280
 And when I say cheating,

14:33.280 --> 14:34.880
 I'm talking about when they cheat themselves,

14:34.880 --> 14:37.600
 and so those become very direct conversations,

14:37.600 --> 14:39.760
 and the conversation starts like this.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.760
 I don't have time to waste, and neither do you,

14:42.560 --> 14:44.000
 and so why are we wasting our time?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.360
 And here's what I mean by that.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.920
 We're having a conversation about your accountability.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.240
 If you look in the mirror and you're accountable,

14:52.240 --> 14:54.640
 then we aren't taking the time to go through this.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.600
 We're already on our way to solving the problem.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.080
 Problem can't be solved without that understanding.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.200
 And that has to do with symptoms

15:03.200 --> 15:04.560
 that you see in the wrestling room.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.680
 There's something where the fire's not quite there.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.600
 That has to do with mental, emotional,

15:07.600 --> 15:10.480
 spiritual, physical, everything.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.680
 Everything that you know about.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.000
 You know, I had a boss,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.240
 and our athletic director is a great athletic director,

15:16.240 --> 15:17.280
 and he's a great athlete,

15:17.280 --> 15:18.320
 and he's a great athlete,

15:18.320 --> 15:20.080
 and our athletic director is a great athletic director,

15:20.080 --> 15:22.400
 and he gives us everything we need to be successful,

15:22.400 --> 15:24.240
 but I had a boss, his name was Fred Mims,

15:24.240 --> 15:26.160
 and I didn't think anybody could be better than him,

15:26.160 --> 15:28.400
 and then all of a sudden this Gene Taylor guy came in,

15:29.120 --> 15:30.800
 and then he was pretty doggone good too,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.680
 and he actually was just like Fred

15:33.680 --> 15:35.840
 and maybe even a little bit more current,

15:35.840 --> 15:37.680
 and then he ended up taking a job at Kansas State

15:37.680 --> 15:39.120
 where he's the athletic director now,

15:39.840 --> 15:42.880
 and then this lady, Barbara Burke, comes in,

15:43.520 --> 15:45.280
 and I didn't think anybody could be better

15:45.280 --> 15:46.880
 than Gene Taylor or Fred Mims,

15:46.880 --> 15:49.600
 and this Barbara Burke, she's better than both of them,

15:50.160 --> 15:52.880
 and the reason why is because she's a problem solver.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.080
 She doesn't waste time.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.320
 She's direct, and she's a problem solver,

15:56.320 --> 15:57.520
 and that's what we need.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.800
 You need problem solvers.

16:01.120 --> 16:06.080
 So on the flip side of problems and technique and repetition,

16:06.880 --> 16:10.160
 here's a thing called toughness, mental toughness,

16:10.720 --> 16:14.160
 something that maybe you or maybe even Iowa in general

16:14.160 --> 16:15.680
 is a little bit known for.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.040
 So how do you train mental toughness as a coach?

16:19.040 --> 16:23.040
 You train mental toughness by putting them in situations

16:23.040 --> 16:27.280
 that they're willing to go through

16:27.280 --> 16:28.560
 but don't think they can make it,

16:28.560 --> 16:29.440
 and then they go through it,

16:29.440 --> 16:31.040
 and then all of a sudden those berries are down.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.840
 Does that have to do with physical usually exhaustion,

16:36.640 --> 16:38.240
 the four reps on the ropes?

16:38.240 --> 16:40.720
 It has to do with that,

16:40.720 --> 16:45.040
 and it has to do with understanding why we're doing it.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.760
 And sometimes understanding why we're doing it

16:47.760 --> 16:51.360
 might not come for months, but there's blind faith,

16:52.320 --> 16:54.880
 and we have a heavyweight in the room right now,

16:54.880 --> 16:58.080
 this young guy that he's like that.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.000
 He doesn't necessarily understand it.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.480
 He asks a lot of questions, but he doesn't,

17:03.360 --> 17:04.880
 and he's been here four months now,

17:04.880 --> 17:05.760
 four and a half months now,

17:05.760 --> 17:06.960
 and he's getting better every day.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.320
 So mental toughness too is a matter of repetition.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.280
 Mental toughness is a matter of repetition

17:13.280 --> 17:15.920
 and having an open mind and being extremely accountable,

17:15.920 --> 17:20.400
 and not only accountable that when you maybe,

17:21.840 --> 17:22.960
 when something doesn't go your way,

17:22.960 --> 17:24.320
 that you look in the mirror and own it,

17:24.320 --> 17:27.600
 but accountable to the point of view that,

17:27.600 --> 17:30.400
 you know what, I gotta get tough in this situation

17:30.400 --> 17:31.760
 right here, right now,

17:31.760 --> 17:33.760
 and this is what's gonna make or break me.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.640
 And I talked about my own career being defined by,

17:36.640 --> 17:38.320
 you know, a couple of minutes on the mat,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.440
 but that's when you're gonna be defined.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.360
 That's how you're gonna be defined.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.000
 That's okay.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.640
 So people are gonna talk about you,

17:46.640 --> 17:47.920
 so you might as well have them talking about

17:47.920 --> 17:48.960
 how doggone tough you are.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.760
 What about, we live in a world now,

17:53.760 --> 17:55.840
 I have often in my own work,

17:55.840 --> 17:58.720
 I hear about this concept of work life balance

17:58.720 --> 17:59.760
 or overtraining.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.720
 So you've been one of the hardest workers ever on the mat.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
 You've coached some of the hardest workers ever.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.480
 Do you think it's possible to over train, train too much?

18:10.480 --> 18:11.440
 How big of a concern is it?

18:11.440 --> 18:15.520
 I think peaking and burnout are frames of mind

18:15.520 --> 18:19.440
 or burnout is a like you let things probably

18:19.440 --> 18:21.760
 get to the point where you could have arrested them

18:22.320 --> 18:23.440
 with a good frame of mind.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.840
 But peaking is a frame of mind

18:25.840 --> 18:28.880
 and you have to know, be able to read,

18:28.880 --> 18:29.840
 and that's a lot of it.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.040
 And the individual athlete also has to know

18:33.920 --> 18:35.760
 that it's a frame of mind.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.480
 And so when you have a coach that's reading that the right way

18:38.480 --> 18:42.160
 and you have an athlete that is knowing that

18:42.160 --> 18:45.200
 when zero hour comes that you're gonna be ready to go

18:46.160 --> 18:48.880
 and knowing that there's light at the end of the tunnel

18:48.880 --> 18:51.840
 if you feel like you're burning that candle at both ends,

18:51.840 --> 18:53.920
 light's coming at the end of the tunnel.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.880
 I mean, you're good to go.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.280
 So you think about Gable and that whole dream

18:59.280 --> 19:02.160
 of being carried off the mat because you worked so hard.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.800
 And again, do you think it's possible to overtrain?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.040
 So you said it's mental.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.880
 I do think it's possible to overtrain

19:08.880 --> 19:10.240
 if you have a lot of distractions.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.280
 And if you're looking at your watch running out of the room,

19:14.400 --> 19:16.960
 then yeah, that frame of mind

19:16.960 --> 19:19.200
 isn't gonna lend itself to excellency.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.560
 And the thing is, is we have to accomplish

19:22.560 --> 19:24.800
 what we need to get accomplished to get better every day.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.880
 You can't kind of accomplish what you need to accomplish.

19:26.880 --> 19:27.840
 You have to accomplish it.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.520
 And when you're in that mindset,

19:31.520 --> 19:33.440
 then the clock is irrelevant.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.920
 There's no place for a clock in the wrestling room.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.000
 And maybe a clock that times a match,

19:39.200 --> 19:40.240
 but it may be a clock.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.800
 We're student athletes here,

19:42.800 --> 19:47.120
 but that's why we encourage when you schedule your classes

19:47.120 --> 19:53.200
 that you don't have a class that comes right up to practice time

19:53.200 --> 19:56.960
 or starts as a night class and it starts at 5.30.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.520
 Go to get the 6.30 class or the seven o clock.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.520
 So you leave it all behind your heart,

20:01.520 --> 20:02.960
 your passion is completely in it.

20:02.960 --> 20:03.360
 There's no problem.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.040
 When you walk in that wrestling room,

20:05.040 --> 20:08.320
 there's no distractions and it's never eternal.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.240
 The only thing that's eternal is death.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.720
 You know, there's nothing.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.640
 Sometimes guys come in there and they wig out.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.320
 It's an hour and 25 minutes,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.280
 or an hour and 45 minutes.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.520
 You have to be willing to go as long as it takes.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.400
 There's no clock.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.120
 There's no clock.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.080
 Again, wrestlers are some of the hardest,

20:30.080 --> 20:33.040
 some of the toughest people in all of sports,

20:33.040 --> 20:35.840
 but weight cutting often breaks people.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.400
 So what's your thought on weight cutting,

20:38.400 --> 20:40.640
 both nutrition wise, mental wise?

20:40.640 --> 20:43.680
 How do you approach and think of it as a coach

20:43.680 --> 20:44.800
 in your own career too?

20:45.520 --> 20:49.440
 It's a lot of discipline and it's a lot of discipline

20:50.000 --> 20:51.840
 during a very uncomfortable time period

20:51.840 --> 20:53.120
 that really doesn't last that long,

20:53.120 --> 20:54.960
 but it feels like it lasts long and it's painful.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.920
 But once you shrink your body down

20:58.880 --> 21:01.120
 and if you're hydrated, you'll get through it.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.280
 If you're a little hungry, but you're eating,

21:04.080 --> 21:06.960
 but you're hydrated, once you break that sweat,

21:06.960 --> 21:09.120
 your energy depletion goes away.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.320
 That's a fact.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.680
 I've practiced that.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.200
 You come in and you're yawning

21:13.840 --> 21:16.560
 and you're starting to shrink your body down

21:16.560 --> 21:17.760
 and it's that time of year where,

21:17.760 --> 21:19.360
 hey, I gotta get my body shrunk down

21:20.080 --> 21:22.960
 and you're dehydrated, you are dead in the water.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.720
 But if you're hungry and hydrated,

21:26.720 --> 21:27.840
 when you break that sweat...

21:27.840 --> 21:30.000
 Have people gotten better with that over the years,

21:30.000 --> 21:30.880
 over the past few decades?

21:30.880 --> 21:34.000
 I think that coaches, science is better.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.600
 I think that coaches communicate it.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.720
 I think they always have.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.960
 I think the bottom line is,

21:38.960 --> 21:41.680
 is having the energy to implement that

21:41.680 --> 21:46.480
 and taking a guy by the hand when he doesn't understand

21:46.480 --> 21:48.480
 and he's new in your program and he's essential

21:49.120 --> 21:51.760
 and or he's unwilling to and not disciplined enough

21:51.760 --> 21:53.040
 because when you take him by the hand enough,

21:53.040 --> 21:54.240
 they won't learn that discipline.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.400
 This is a fact.

21:56.400 --> 22:00.080
 This is an important aspect of wrestling, buddy.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.760
 You know what I'm saying?

22:01.760 --> 22:05.760
 So, you know, it's not just go and show up for the match.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.960
 I mean, it's not about just making weight either.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.160
 You gotta be able to make weight.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.000
 That's part of the warm up.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.240
 That's part of the process, getting ready to wrestle.

22:14.240 --> 22:14.720
 It's a whole thing.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.600
 It's a lifestyle.

22:15.600 --> 22:15.840
 Yeah.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.400
 When did you first start believing

22:19.120 --> 22:20.720
 you're going to win Olympic gold?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.880
 I don't know.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.840
 I mean, I found out I got really addicted

22:25.840 --> 22:28.640
 to wrestling really, really fast, started late.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.480
 But looking back at my life,

22:31.920 --> 22:33.920
 wrestled my whole life with my twin brother.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.840
 And when Terry and I would fight, it was wrestling

22:37.840 --> 22:38.960
 and it was to maim.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.840
 And so if you're trying to maim me,

22:43.840 --> 22:46.480
 I better be tough because if I roll over

22:47.680 --> 22:49.280
 and expect you to scratch my belly

22:49.280 --> 22:51.040
 when you're trying to maim me, I won't lose my head.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.360
 And Tom and Terry Brands, there was no alpha male.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.160
 And when it was on, it was on for real.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.520
 What do you mean there's no alpha male?

22:59.520 --> 23:00.880
 There's both?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.160
 There are a lot of twins.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.360
 There's a dominant twin.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.160
 Oh, a lot of them.

23:04.160 --> 23:04.640
 Ah.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.400
 Very few times is there a situation

23:08.400 --> 23:11.440
 where I'm going to win every time in everything

23:11.440 --> 23:13.840
 and then he's thinking the same exact way.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.840
 And Terry used to describe it like when we used

23:15.840 --> 23:17.520
 to get interviewed a lot about our careers.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.920
 Like it'd be like you grabbing a steering wheel

23:19.920 --> 23:22.160
 and me grabbing a steering wheel and fighting.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.240
 And that's what it was like when you would wrestle him

23:24.240 --> 23:25.040
 or fight him.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
 And so I had that benefit.

23:27.760 --> 23:28.720
 So when did I know?

23:28.720 --> 23:31.280
 Well, I got addicted to wrestling really, really fast

23:31.280 --> 23:34.000
 in fifth grade and started to research it.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.520
 And I don't know why and talked about the Olympics

23:37.520 --> 23:43.600
 and put it in my head and remember said something

23:43.600 --> 23:45.760
 about being an Olympic champion in fifth grade.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.760
 And somebody made fun of me and I got in a fight

23:47.760 --> 23:48.560
 in the playground.

23:49.360 --> 23:53.040
 And I remember getting pulled in,

23:53.040 --> 23:54.000
 getting in trouble for that.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.600
 And the people that got me in trouble for that

23:57.600 --> 24:00.880
 were smart enough to not rake me over the coals,

24:00.880 --> 24:03.440
 but they researched or they actually found out

24:03.440 --> 24:04.800
 what the fight was about.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.920
 And I was distraught.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.600
 I was really emotional, like crying

24:09.600 --> 24:10.640
 or whatever you want to say.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.480
 You don't want to admit that too many times.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.600
 But it wasn't because I got beat up or got my nose bloodied

24:15.600 --> 24:18.720
 or got punched in the face or broke my arm

24:19.440 --> 24:20.400
 or there was any pain.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.000
 It was because they stomped on my dream and they doubted me.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.360
 And so I fought for that.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.840
 And that was a lesson.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.360
 There's going to be a lot of doubters.

24:29.920 --> 24:34.320
 And one thing we talk about as a staff is our staff

24:34.320 --> 24:38.800
 has to be lockstep in that hallway, in our offices.

24:38.800 --> 24:43.920
 And when you deviate outside of that, that is heresy.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.840
 So everybody has to be on board,

24:45.840 --> 24:48.400
 confident that you're going to be number one in the country.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.280
 When we go forward and we go put our public foot forward,

24:51.280 --> 24:52.080
 there is a decision.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.800
 We are unified and there is no backbiting.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.960
 And we have great people right now.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.320
 And we hadn't had that before.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.520
 We've had detractors in our Hawkeye Wrestling Club.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.840
 We've had guys that would go out and get rolled up

25:03.840 --> 25:05.920
 in ankle laces and not be able to walk.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.880
 We've had guys that would go out and get rolled up in ankle laces

25:08.880 --> 25:11.200
 and not care in our club.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.560
 And we got Brandon Sorensen,

25:12.560 --> 25:15.440
 who got rolled up by James Green last night.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.080
 But I'll tell you what, I don't have a problem with that.

25:18.080 --> 25:18.720
 You know why?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.400
 Because I know it means a lot to him.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.520
 He didn't roll over.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.960
 He didn't quit because he was on the consolation side of a bracket.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.160
 And so when you have that and then you have,

25:29.120 --> 25:31.440
 if there's a disagreement, it's behind closed doors.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.560
 And then you're moving forward.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.680
 And when you have people that when they're meeting your fans

25:35.680 --> 25:38.800
 and your supporters, you know, they're talking the right way

25:38.800 --> 25:39.840
 with the right message.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.880
 And anything that's cattywonk is to that,

25:42.880 --> 25:44.080
 you got to be careful there.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.600
 You got to be careful there.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.840
 So that in terms of affirmation, in terms of really believing

25:49.840 --> 25:52.720
 as a team, as an individual, believing that you're the best

25:52.720 --> 25:57.040
 in the world, did you, I'm sure you had detractors.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.600
 You had people that continued after fifth grade.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.440
 And that's probably where my hatred of losing trumps

26:03.440 --> 26:06.640
 my love for winning because I wanted to shove it up

26:06.640 --> 26:07.920
 their rear end bad.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.300
 Yeah.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.760
 And the thing is, is we maintain a high level

26:13.760 --> 26:15.440
 and there's very few programs.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.880
 Oklahoma State, Ohio State now, Penn State.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.760
 I mean, there's four programs that try to win

26:21.760 --> 26:22.880
 a national title every year.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.480
 And that's it.

26:24.480 --> 26:28.320
 And these other teams, they get up and they got a good team

26:28.320 --> 26:29.840
 and they get up and they get going.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.720
 And then when things don't go well, okay,

26:32.720 --> 26:34.080
 we're going to do it next year.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.440
 Or this is a down year.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.320
 We're going to get right.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.360
 We're three years out.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.920
 So no matter what you're fighting for first.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.400
 We do.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.040
 And we haven't won and you say, well, even one in eight years.

26:43.040 --> 26:43.520
 Well, you're right.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.020
 We haven't.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.760
 But look at our results are better than anybody out there.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.520
 And it's besides Penn State.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.240
 And it's because of our mentality and because we have great people.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.560
 Ryan Morningstar, Bobby Telfer, Terry Brands,

26:56.560 --> 26:59.680
 our medical team, even our strength coach,

26:59.680 --> 27:01.680
 Quinn Holland, we're all on the same page.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.880
 And when I send something, I hit it immediately.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.000
 I don't have time to waste.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.200
 There will not be dissension in that hallway.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.640
 Everybody's in together.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.140
 Yeah.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.160
 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.

27:14.160 --> 27:19.760
 Can you take me through the day when you're going for the 62 kg gold?

27:19.760 --> 27:20.560
 What did you eat?

27:21.200 --> 27:22.000
 Drink?

27:22.000 --> 27:22.720
 What did you think?

27:23.360 --> 27:24.640
 It really doesn't matter.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.960
 Um, I have a routine that, you know, I had a routine as a competitor

27:28.960 --> 27:30.320
 that I could run through right now.

27:31.200 --> 27:35.440
 Um, it was a lot of self talk, very, very positive self talk.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.320
 Visualization.

27:36.320 --> 27:36.720
 Yes.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.880
 Visualization, um, self talk.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.520
 Um, and, and that's how I was able to relax and getting ready for

27:43.520 --> 27:44.640
 matches my whole life.

27:45.440 --> 27:49.120
 Learned that very early age at a camp and a developmental camp

27:49.680 --> 27:51.040
 at a young age, Terry and I did.

27:51.040 --> 27:57.600
 And, um, I can tell you what I ate and I can tell you what I did to

27:57.600 --> 27:59.200
 relax and it doesn't matter.

27:59.840 --> 28:03.040
 Um, what you have to do is you have to find that piece.

28:03.840 --> 28:08.320
 And I just know that when I was getting ready for the finals match,

28:08.320 --> 28:09.680
 I had gone back to my room.

28:09.680 --> 28:15.440
 I had my relaxed material, you know, and I was able to relax

28:15.440 --> 28:17.520
 because I prepared for it.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.680
 Hopefully I'm right on this, but just looking at the insane bracket

28:21.680 --> 28:24.240
 you had to go through, you had to beat, just to get to the finals,

28:24.240 --> 28:27.120
 it had to be three world champions, eventually world champ.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.040
 I mean, Dave, and you know what?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.920
 I don't talk about that and nobody else does either, but everybody

28:31.920 --> 28:33.200
 talks about it in their own career.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.120
 So now you're making my head big, but yeah, I had a road, I had a road.

28:39.120 --> 28:39.680
 You're right.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.440
 That is the hardest bracket I've seen.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.360
 So I've talked to a lot of Olympic champions.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.320
 That is the hardest bracket I've seen of any champion.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.880
 So maybe I'm confused on this, but it seemed like a really tough day for you.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.920
 Did you have, did you know the bracket ahead of time?

28:53.920 --> 28:55.280
 Did you know who you faced?

28:55.280 --> 28:58.240
 You see the draw and it's a two day tournament.

28:58.960 --> 29:05.040
 So psychology comes into it as much as physical shape, you know,

29:05.040 --> 29:09.040
 because there's those, you got to sleep, you know, the night before

29:09.040 --> 29:11.520
 after the weigh in, then you got to sleep again that next night

29:11.520 --> 29:14.800
 after your semi final match is going to be in the morning.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.960
 You know, and then you have to go back and rest because your final

29:16.960 --> 29:18.880
 matches in Intel, whatever time it was.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.280
 And so all this relaxation and all that stuff that you just talked about,

29:23.280 --> 29:25.200
 that visualization and self talk, that's what helps you.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.000
 It's your routine.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.520
 And was there any doubt, any fear, any, anything there?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.920
 The fear is the type of fear.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.280
 And I just talked about this to one of my athletes today.

29:38.320 --> 29:43.040
 Jack Dempsey talked about fear and the fear of losing is what motivates

29:43.040 --> 29:45.200
 him to try to take his opponent's head off.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.720
 He was a boxer and that's okay.

29:49.360 --> 29:54.320
 So fear of competition, fear of screwing up, fear of, oh, I don't feel good.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.520
 No, no.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.720
 But that little fear that, you know what, there's somebody out there

29:58.720 --> 30:02.800
 that thinks that, you know what, they're going to, they're going to revel in my,

30:03.600 --> 30:07.040
 they're going to, they're going to, they're going to eat it up in my misery.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.240
 They're going to love, they're going to be thriving because I fail.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.160
 And I'm not going to let that happen.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.920
 You're identical twin brother, Terry.

30:15.920 --> 30:21.280
 You've been at him, like you said, your whole life, and you're both some of the

30:21.280 --> 30:22.640
 greatest wrestlers of all time.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.000
 You won the gold medal.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.200
 He won the bronze medal.

30:25.840 --> 30:30.000
 You've mentioned, you know, all that really matters is the six minutes or,

30:30.400 --> 30:33.840
 you know, just a few minutes, sometimes a few seconds to find your whole career.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.480
 So how do you think about that thin line, the tragic line, and how do you

30:38.480 --> 30:42.880
 think about that line, the tragic line at the Olympic level between winning and

30:42.880 --> 30:43.360
 losing?

30:43.360 --> 30:47.840
 I think you come to peace that in the end, when it's over, that you did the

30:47.840 --> 30:48.400
 best you could.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.320
 And that's certainly the case with Terry.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.320
 He has a career credentials are better than mine internationally.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.560
 You know, he won two world championships.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.840
 I won one and he won an Olympic bronze medal.

31:01.840 --> 31:06.320
 And, you know, I won an Olympic gold medal, but I only won one.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.920
 The thing is, is that's not what's important anyway.

31:09.920 --> 31:17.440
 What's important is, is that when it's all over, you know, how do you look

31:17.440 --> 31:18.080
 back on it?

31:18.720 --> 31:22.160
 And you're kind of like, well, you just said that you made sure that you

31:22.160 --> 31:23.520
 weren't going to leave anything undone.

31:24.160 --> 31:24.880
 But you know what?

31:24.880 --> 31:27.280
 There were tournaments where I did leave things undone.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.120
 And so how do you come back from that?

31:29.120 --> 31:31.760
 Well, Terry never came back from 2000 because he retired.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.680
 Well, you know what?

31:33.680 --> 31:37.360
 Duplicate and exceed when you're communicating to these young athletes.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.600
 And because of that experience, that makes Terry a better coach.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.680
 Because of, you know, 1995, that makes me a better coach.

31:46.560 --> 31:51.680
 You know, realizing that there are certain things that unraveled in that

31:51.680 --> 31:54.320
 year that I could have controlled looking back on it.

31:54.960 --> 31:58.640
 And when you have that perspective, you can communicate.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.520
 So what control is there?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.880
 Can you control everything?

32:02.880 --> 32:04.720
 How big of a role is luck?

32:04.720 --> 32:09.040
 Control how you react to an injury, control that.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.880
 So you can't, you don't have any control over it.

32:10.880 --> 32:18.080
 It's over, you know, you have whatever and whatever happened, but relax.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.640
 And you learn to deal with injuries better because of that.

32:20.640 --> 32:25.520
 You have that experience that you let this thing maybe get the best of you.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.120
 And that's just an example.

32:27.120 --> 32:33.520
 And, you know, Terry put a lot of demons to rest with that bronze medal.

32:34.640 --> 32:38.400
 So becoming an Olympic medalist, a few demons could relax.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.160
 Well, a little, he will never admit that.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.080
 And he probably isn't truthful.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.280
 And I should, I'm speaking for him, but he's truthful when he says that.

32:45.760 --> 32:54.240
 But if I look at it and bronze sucks, but if I look at it, he did put some

32:54.240 --> 32:56.000
 demons to rest and I'm proud of him for it.

32:56.000 --> 33:03.760
 There's something there that is a consolation in the fact that he won the consolation medal.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.800
 The consolation medal sucks, but there is a consolation that he won the consolation medal.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.400
 That's a tough medal to win, by the way.

33:10.400 --> 33:10.900
 Yeah.

33:11.920 --> 33:18.800
 But do you see the Shakespearean tragedy of it all that the line between winning and losing?

33:18.800 --> 33:23.280
 So you often say that, you know, winning is everything, but it feels like, especially

33:23.280 --> 33:30.160
 at the Olympic level, or you talk about NCAA finals or that tournament, you know, a split

33:30.160 --> 33:37.040
 second miss move can result in a loss where you dominated all the way up to there.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.200
 That's where your psychology comes in.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.840
 And that's where the repetition and all of the self talk and visualization

33:43.840 --> 33:47.040
 and the physical shape and everything comes together.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.360
 And so that doesn't happen.

33:49.360 --> 33:55.520
 And tonight, we got beat twice, actually three times, and we out wrestled those.

33:55.520 --> 34:01.520
 We lost three matches and we out wrestled the guy for six minutes and 30 seconds, or

34:01.520 --> 34:03.440
 one match went to overtime.

34:04.160 --> 34:09.520
 And if our guys can move forward with the right perspective, I'm confident that they'll

34:09.520 --> 34:10.320
 be better.

34:11.680 --> 34:16.400
 I'll tell you what, I'd take our guy over their guy any day, any day, because our guys

34:16.400 --> 34:17.760
 get up for every match.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.440
 And now we got a lot to work on.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.920
 A lot to work on.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.880
 But you know what?

34:22.880 --> 34:26.000
 I can say all that and I'll take our guy and blah, blah, blah.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.640
 But what are they going to do tonight in their meal?

34:28.640 --> 34:30.880
 What are they going to do tonight in their rest?

34:30.880 --> 34:35.040
 What are they going to do tomorrow in their recovery on their own, necessarily?

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
 What are they going to do Monday?

34:37.040 --> 34:46.240
 Great wrestlers can use their imagination with a win that they're not satisfied with

34:46.800 --> 34:49.520
 and go forward as if it was a loss.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.600
 But it's still easier to go forward with that win.

34:52.160 --> 34:56.800
 But they can, they don't just, oh, I won, I'm fine, goes on.

34:56.800 --> 35:01.520
 But then when they lose the exact same way that they could have lost before, then they

35:01.520 --> 35:02.560
 go off the deep end.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.760
 And then that's when they lose.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.280
 They could have lost before, then they go off the deep end and then that's when they're

35:07.280 --> 35:08.960
 going to make the change in their life.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.680
 And we talked about that to our team tonight.

35:12.400 --> 35:21.920
 And the mature, rare ingredient is, is guys that can get better even with success like

35:21.920 --> 35:24.400
 it was a loss without beating themselves up.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.760
 That's complicated.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.240
 It is.

35:26.240 --> 35:26.880
 It's a balance.

35:26.880 --> 35:33.040
 You often talk about Iowa's focus on creating individual champions like Spencer Lee.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.920
 Can you explain the philosophy of focusing on individuals versus the team?

35:39.040 --> 35:45.760
 I think that we need to put them both together and the individual impacts the team.

35:45.760 --> 35:53.280
 And, you know, we haven't done that since 2010 and we need to do a better job of putting

35:53.280 --> 35:57.040
 10 weight classes out there that contribute to the team.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.880
 And if it's not 10, then it's nine.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.520
 And if it's not nine, it can't be four, you know?

36:03.520 --> 36:10.560
 And that takes a lot of pride and it takes a lot of, you know, where the coach is on

36:10.560 --> 36:11.120
 top of it.

36:12.000 --> 36:19.520
 And, you know, you're not just working on the easy things, the glaring things.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.120
 You're working on everything.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.400
 What do you mean by everything?

36:22.400 --> 36:23.440
 So, the…

36:24.400 --> 36:32.480
 Like there's just some, you know, there's ideas that when you're a coach that aren't

36:32.480 --> 36:34.720
 there beneath the surface and you got to find them.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.320
 And that's where communication comes in.

36:38.320 --> 36:38.800
 Yeah.

36:38.800 --> 36:42.480
 But you're talking about, yeah, we got to move forward.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.680
 Well, what does that mean?

36:43.680 --> 36:45.040
 Well, I know what that means.

36:45.040 --> 36:52.320
 But how many guys really know what that means in their program?

36:52.320 --> 36:55.120
 You know, there's so many levels of that.

36:55.120 --> 37:00.400
 You've said before that winning is everything and that means people lose.

37:00.400 --> 37:06.080
 Most people lose, you know, there's really in whatever the context is only one winner.

37:06.080 --> 37:10.800
 In many parts of our world today, outside of wrestling, that concept, the brutal honesty

37:10.800 --> 37:12.800
 of that is uncomfortable for people.

37:12.800 --> 37:23.120
 So, how do you think about this very philosophical, difficult concept of, you know, there only

37:23.120 --> 37:27.920
 being one winner, that winning is everything, this kind of really painful idea?

37:27.920 --> 37:31.920
 I don't think that that's a bad thing to have that mentality.

37:31.920 --> 37:36.240
 I mean, I think Akutukov, I remember a story I read about him.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.200
 He comes to mind.

37:37.200 --> 37:45.120
 You know, Sargush, I remember when he lost in London and I remember the look on his face.

37:45.120 --> 37:49.360
 And those are some of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport, freestyle wrestling.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.080
 And, you know what?

37:52.080 --> 37:53.120
 It's what works for you.

37:54.160 --> 38:00.240
 You can talk about being at peace with your results and that the approach is and the journey

38:00.240 --> 38:01.200
 is what it's about.

38:01.200 --> 38:07.200
 But, and that's great and that relaxes some champions and that makes some champions really,

38:07.200 --> 38:10.560
 really tick, but not everybody.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.400
 So, it's okay, it's okay.

38:14.400 --> 38:20.240
 And if that wigs you out and that really makes you uptight, then go the other route.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.160
 You have to find what works for you.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.120
 And that takes a lot of work.

38:23.120 --> 38:26.960
 If you're lazy, forget it, forget it.

38:26.960 --> 38:33.360
 So, you and Terry, but in general, how do you find the line between extremely physical,

38:33.360 --> 38:37.040
 extreme physical wrestling and rough wrestling or angry wrestling?

38:37.040 --> 38:41.040
 So, to which degree has anger, whether it's in your wrestling room these days or in your

38:41.040 --> 38:43.280
 own career, entered wrestling?

38:43.280 --> 38:47.440
 Do you see it as a tool that can be used in the wrestling match?

38:47.440 --> 38:50.400
 I think there's a balance or not even a balance.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.880
 There's a lot of balance in the wrestling world.

38:52.880 --> 38:58.880
 I think there's a balance or not even a balance, there's a line that you go up to and you can't

38:58.880 --> 38:59.760
 cross it.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.040
 Sportsmanship is everything.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.640
 You can get dinged for points.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.520
 You can get thrown out of tournaments.

39:05.520 --> 39:12.080
 There's rules with flagrant misconduct where you're kicked out of the match, other team

39:12.080 --> 39:14.800
 gets the points and then you have to sit the next meet.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.200
 So, it's very serious.

39:17.200 --> 39:22.720
 The NCAA sends a message, a very serious message about sportsmanship.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.120
 Yeah.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.640
 And so, we talk about that.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.200
 The other thing with wrestling is there's rules in wrestling.

39:27.760 --> 39:34.240
 These guys that are tough guys outside of the rules, that's what you want in your opponent.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.280
 That means they're frustrated.

39:38.480 --> 39:42.480
 You got to be a tough guy inside the rules of the sport.

39:43.680 --> 39:47.760
 That's more honorable than cold cocking somebody and knocking them out.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.840
 So, yeah, anger doesn't mean breaking the rules.

39:49.840 --> 39:53.840
 But I mean, you know, a lot of people know you just watching you as a coach.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.160
 There's quite a bit of passion there.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.000
 Well, come and do what you're doing tonight.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.920
 I mean, break bread with me in my kitchen and see how big of a jackass I am.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.040
 Now, you're a pretty nice guy.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.600
 Well, I'm not asking for that necessarily, but thanks.

40:05.600 --> 40:12.080
 I'm saying, you know what, as a coach, I mean, okay, come spend a month in our program and

40:12.080 --> 40:15.600
 you'll see really what kind of people we are.

40:15.600 --> 40:20.000
 And there's a stigma out there because they are very threatened by our program.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.520
 There's nobody else that threatens the sport of wrestling like we do.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.320
 And that's the truth.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.360
 There's a legend to Iowa wrestling.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.920
 There's one of the most intimidating.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.240
 There's a legend to John Smith.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.120
 It's the same thing.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.680
 They get up for John Smith.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.040
 They get up for Oklahoma State.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.360
 They get up for Penn State.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.800
 My question is, okay, I'll answer it.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.680
 I'll answer it this way.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.160
 I'll give you an example in my coaching career.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.320
 I coached at Virginia Tech for 22 months.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.240
 We recruited the number one recruiting class.

40:54.960 --> 41:00.160
 We got the administration to change 100% 180 how they looked at wrestling.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.600
 Here's the thing.

41:01.600 --> 41:05.200
 And because of how serious we were and because we weren't idiots,

41:06.960 --> 41:09.120
 we were able to do that with our administration.

41:09.120 --> 41:12.480
 But my point is this, we tried to win.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.080
 We tried to win, even at Virginia Tech.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.520
 It wasn't a stepping stone for me.

41:15.520 --> 41:18.880
 It ended up being one quickly and looking back on it.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.680
 I was a fool to think that I'd be there for 20 years.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.120
 But you believed you would be.

41:23.120 --> 41:23.600
 I did.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.160
 Yeah, I did.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.100
 I did.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.520
 So do you remember a time that you really pushed yourself to your limits?

41:32.320 --> 41:35.040
 So Gable talks about having to be carried off the mat.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.600
 Have you really found that level?

41:37.600 --> 41:41.280
 I said something about that too in a book and I think I was mistaken.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.440
 A book and I think I was misquoted one time.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.920
 And actually it was Gable's quote.

41:45.920 --> 41:50.560
 And I was trying to make the point that Gable's quote was like this.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.440
 And they were making it like it was my own words.

41:53.440 --> 41:57.760
 I think it was a first wrestling tough book, but it's a good book.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.240
 But the story is Gable's.

42:00.960 --> 42:05.440
 And I don't know if there's anybody that has done that besides him.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.960
 And I think that's a very rare quality.

42:08.960 --> 42:16.960
 But I've definitely been in that nirvana level of, you know, you could go all day long.

42:17.920 --> 42:20.720
 And it doesn't, you have to shoot me to stop me.

42:20.720 --> 42:21.220
 Yeah.

42:21.680 --> 42:25.760
 But there's a balance because you're not going hard with and holding your breath.

42:25.760 --> 42:34.320
 It's not a, it's a relaxed and like you got a guy cornered and who's most dangerous?

42:34.880 --> 42:36.400
 Well, the guy that's cornered.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.120
 And so that's where you relax, I'm not bum rushing him.

42:40.000 --> 42:40.960
 I'm relaxed.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.120
 I'm still moving, fake and very fluid.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.080
 Guy falls down his face.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.120
 I run around behind him.

42:45.680 --> 42:46.640
 That's offense.

42:47.680 --> 42:51.760
 You don't have to just grunt to the leg and call that offense.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.080
 Offense is a in and out, smooth.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.920
 Now you sound like a Russian wrestler.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.140
 Yeah.

42:59.140 --> 43:04.240
 Well, that's, they're the best in a certain light, looking at the history of wrestling.

43:04.240 --> 43:07.360
 Wrestling is much bigger than folk style, freestyle, Greco.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.800
 It's, it's one of the oldest forms of combat period.

43:11.360 --> 43:14.000
 There's been cave drawings 15,000 years ago.

43:14.560 --> 43:19.600
 Do you ever see, so you're, you're, uh, one of the great coaches of all time.

43:19.600 --> 43:23.760
 You're now focused on a particular rule style right now, but do you ever see wrestling

43:23.760 --> 43:29.840
 as bigger than all of the, this, you know, as, as, uh, one of the pure combats?

43:29.840 --> 43:34.960
 I do, and we're raising $20 million for a facility to make it the best facility on the planet.

43:34.960 --> 43:40.640
 We have a vision to build the best facility on planet earth and put the best wrestlers in it.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.920
 And that is bigger than wrestling.

43:45.040 --> 43:52.000
 It's for the university of Iowa and our donors are doing it for the university of Iowa, but it is

43:52.000 --> 43:55.600
 about the value of wrestling to me.

43:55.600 --> 44:01.600
 Also, there is so much value to wrestling blind, blind people don't play football.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.240
 They wrestle blind people, don't play basketball.

44:04.240 --> 44:08.080
 I mean, maybe they do, but it'd be very difficult.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.120
 They can wrestle.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.760
 Wrestling is a field sport.

44:12.800 --> 44:12.800
 Yeah.

44:12.800 --> 44:13.600
 There's no ball.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.080
 There's nothing.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.720
 It's just two guys or two girls and that's it.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.360
 That's right.

44:17.360 --> 44:21.920
 And, and you, I mean, I'm not going to say you can't because somebody will get a hold of this

44:21.920 --> 44:26.800
 and I'll get an email or a letter that says, you said blind people can't play baseball and blah, blah.

44:27.520 --> 44:31.040
 I'm just saying that blind people can wrestle very effectively.

44:31.040 --> 44:31.520
 Yes.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.280
 I've wrestled with, with my eyes shut.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.880
 I mean, was honest about it too.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.680
 And it was, I was effective.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.080
 So why, why was I able to be effective?

44:40.080 --> 44:47.280
 Because wrestling is a, is a, is a sport that you, you can overcome a lot, your demons that

44:47.280 --> 44:54.400
 you're overcoming, they're not limited with whether I'm blind or not.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.400
 The demons that are overcoming are inside you.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.160
 You have to overcome those demons from within.

44:59.600 --> 45:04.800
 So what's the future of Iowa wrestling look like with this facility and this momentum you have now

45:04.800 --> 45:06.560
 and this great group of guys you have now?

45:06.560 --> 45:14.560
 We have a good young group of guys and, um, you know, there is a lot of buzz in the program.

45:14.560 --> 45:17.520
 And probably hasn't been this much buzz for quite some time.

45:18.560 --> 45:26.960
 And our job is to, you know, be relaxed and be focused and not get caught up in the buzz.

45:27.680 --> 45:32.240
 Um, but we have to put it together and we have a catalyst Spencer Lee, but he's going to have to,

45:32.240 --> 45:33.600
 he's going to have to get better.

45:34.400 --> 45:39.680
 And we have some other catalysts as well that are, um, you know, going to help us in the future.

45:39.680 --> 45:44.480
 Um, but they got to get better.

45:44.480 --> 45:51.520
 And so all this stuff about independence and accountability and, you know, being able to

45:51.520 --> 45:59.200
 get better every day under duress and not knowing that you're getting better, but you are, you know,

45:59.200 --> 46:00.720
 you know what that, you know what I mean by that?

46:01.280 --> 46:05.920
 Like the great thing about Gabo was wrestling for him was, is you were getting better and

46:05.920 --> 46:07.280
 you didn't know you were getting better.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.800
 Well, yeah, just like you said, uh, grow from success.

46:10.800 --> 46:16.400
 So even you, you never allow yourself to think that you're, that you're, you're getting good.

46:16.400 --> 46:20.000
 All of a sudden you do something in the practice room that you've been working on and all of a

46:20.000 --> 46:22.240
 sudden you hit it and it's like, it was automatic.

46:22.240 --> 46:26.640
 And then that, you know, yeah, that multiplies success.

46:26.640 --> 46:31.840
 And so if I may say, so you're a bit of a man of the Bible.

46:31.840 --> 46:39.760
 What's, where do you go, what do you go to the Bible for your faith, strength, love, patience?

46:39.760 --> 46:41.920
 I talked about things that you can't control.

46:41.920 --> 46:42.720
 You turn them over.

46:43.520 --> 46:48.320
 So the biggest thing for me is I got to turn over the things that I can't control, turn them over

46:49.280 --> 46:52.080
 to that power and I'm going to be a lot better off.

46:52.080 --> 46:57.040
 And that's the reason why I'm not in the funny farm because very competitive to me.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.240
 Yeah.

46:58.240 --> 47:05.760
 It's very serious that we, we know that these young wrestlers come to school here to be the

47:05.760 --> 47:11.280
 best that they can be and to accomplish goals that like me, when I was young, they've set out

47:11.280 --> 47:14.480
 to accomplish and they chose Iowa to do that.

47:14.480 --> 47:15.600
 So we have to deliver.

47:16.560 --> 47:26.320
 And because of that, um, peace with God, you know, it's peer, it's a peer motivation.

47:26.320 --> 47:31.360
 It's a peer motivation and it's a peer platform.

47:31.360 --> 47:34.800
 It's not, it's not doing this for my ego.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.360
 We're not corrupt people.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.520
 We're not liars and cheaters.

47:40.320 --> 47:45.200
 And so often that gets in the way of a decent person.

47:46.320 --> 47:46.560
 Yeah.

47:46.560 --> 47:50.160
 First and foremost, you're a good person and God helps you be that.

47:50.880 --> 47:51.040
 Yeah.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.320
 And we're serious about wrestling.

47:52.320 --> 47:52.820
 Right.

47:55.920 --> 47:57.920
 So a couple more questions.

47:58.480 --> 48:01.280
 What's the role of family in wrestling?

48:01.280 --> 48:08.960
 You mentioned your wife, who I read, uh, turned you down when you asked her for a phone number,

48:08.960 --> 48:10.400
 said it's in the phone book.

48:10.400 --> 48:11.680
 That's pretty smooth.

48:11.680 --> 48:16.720
 Her story of that is that she didn't want me to have to remember the number.

48:16.720 --> 48:21.280
 And I say at this point, and I say, there's no way.

48:21.280 --> 48:24.320
 And I remember it very clearly like, Hey, it's in the phone book.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.840
 And I was like, okay, she's blowing me off.

48:25.840 --> 48:26.320
 That's okay.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.960
 But luckily here's the thing with family.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.440
 I mean, we, we have great people in our program.

48:33.440 --> 48:34.720
 We have great parents.

48:34.720 --> 48:38.640
 We have a culture of parents that that's part of the buzz.

48:39.760 --> 48:43.440
 And this class that you see wrestling right now, that's been here a year now,

48:43.440 --> 48:49.040
 um, Lee, Mirren, Costello, Warner, and then Lugo was a transfer and I'm forgetting somebody.

48:49.040 --> 48:53.360
 I don't want to forget anybody, but, um, these parents are phenomenal.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.200
 And that's a different parental culture.

48:56.560 --> 49:02.560
 Um, so the Kemmerer's dad is the same and, and, um, so there's a lot of good there.

49:02.560 --> 49:07.840
 And that, that's a big, that's a big, a big move because how we talk to parents, we don't

49:07.840 --> 49:10.160
 talk to parents to get along with them.

49:10.160 --> 49:14.720
 We talk to parents to help them understand, you know, where we're at with their sons.

49:15.680 --> 49:21.200
 And when you can have a direct conversation with a parent who helping his son or her son,

49:21.200 --> 49:28.160
 the mom helping her son to be accountable and to own it, then you can get a lot accomplished.

49:28.160 --> 49:29.680
 And that's what we've been able to do.

49:29.680 --> 49:31.120
 And so you're solving problems.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.560
 Like I talked about earlier, um, that's part of the family.

49:34.560 --> 49:38.960
 The other part of the family is the coaches, um, are like family.

49:38.960 --> 49:44.480
 The other part of the family is the coaches, uh, significant others and wives are part

49:44.480 --> 49:45.520
 of the family.

49:45.520 --> 49:52.720
 And we fed, you know, we fed 40 guys and an entire coaching staff and wives and their

49:52.720 --> 49:56.720
 children here at Thanksgiving, and that equals 70 people.

49:57.520 --> 49:59.520
 And it's, it's fun.

50:00.240 --> 50:00.720
 It's fun.

50:01.360 --> 50:04.320
 So family means administration.

50:04.320 --> 50:09.600
 Gary Varda, my, my athletic director gives us everything that we need to be successful.

50:09.600 --> 50:14.240
 And he has an open mind for, for the sport of wrestling and wrestling is important in

50:14.240 --> 50:14.720
 Iowa.

50:14.720 --> 50:20.000
 So that's a no brainer, but not if you're not a wrestling guy, but he sees we do it

50:20.000 --> 50:20.720
 the right way.

50:20.720 --> 50:23.200
 And so the commitment is there from him.

50:23.200 --> 50:27.280
 If we were doofuses, you know, he, the commitment wouldn't be there.

50:28.320 --> 50:32.320
 So family is, everybody's all in, I mean, it's from the wrestlers to the family.

50:32.320 --> 50:35.200
 It goes back to what I said earlier about our people.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.080
 Our people are great.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.680
 Ryan Morty Star is great.

50:37.680 --> 50:38.880
 Bobby Telford is great.

50:39.760 --> 50:43.120
 Bobby Telford took over for a guy named Ben Burhow, who is great.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.840
 Our medical team is great.

50:45.840 --> 50:51.360
 Dr. Westerman, Dr. Wolf, Jesse Donaworth, our athletic trainer is great.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.200
 Terry Brands is great.

50:55.200 --> 50:59.040
 Mariah Stickley and, and Elise Owens, our managers are great.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.240
 My daughter's a manager as well.

51:00.240 --> 51:00.800
 It's great.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.120
 They're, they're hardworking young women.

51:03.120 --> 51:09.120
 Our rest, our Hawkeye Wrestling Club is, is where it needs to be in terms of how they

51:09.120 --> 51:11.360
 help in their role.

51:11.360 --> 51:15.360
 And now we have four women in there and that's great.

51:16.240 --> 51:20.480
 And, you know, at least one of their dads is super involved with us.

51:20.480 --> 51:26.880
 But, and so it's, one thing that I've learned is that you have to have that.

51:26.880 --> 51:30.720
 And if you don't have that, then you have to address it quickly.

51:31.440 --> 51:34.240
 And those outliers, you know, let's solve that problem.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.600
 Let's get it out in the open here.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.960
 And if they're, you know, if it doesn't work out, it's not going to work out.

51:39.840 --> 51:41.520
 That's a heck of a Thanksgiving dinner.

51:42.400 --> 51:42.720
 Yeah.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.200
 Next year.

51:43.200 --> 51:48.000
 Well, I don't know if it'd be legal, but I'd have to check with our compliance and, you

51:48.000 --> 51:49.280
 know, they'd have to vet you.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.640
 You could come, you can come and see what it's all about.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.000
 This room is full.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.280
 Oh man.

51:57.280 --> 51:58.960
 Well, yeah, I'll be back next year then.

51:58.960 --> 51:59.440
 All right.

51:59.440 --> 51:59.920
 Awesome.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.200
 Last question.

52:01.200 --> 52:10.320
 In 2014, I watched this video four years ago of you competing in, I believe, your first

52:10.320 --> 52:13.520
 swim meet against your brother, Terry.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.240
 And you came out victorious.

52:17.200 --> 52:17.920
 Not really.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.200
 Okay.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.360
 So let's, did you cheat?

52:21.360 --> 52:22.400
 Here's what happened.

52:22.400 --> 52:26.640
 I had researched this thing because I'm, that's how I am.

52:26.640 --> 52:27.600
 You practiced.

52:27.600 --> 52:28.320
 No, I didn't.

52:28.320 --> 52:29.120
 But I researched it.

52:29.120 --> 52:34.160
 In swimming, if you flinch on that starter block, it's a false start.

52:34.160 --> 52:38.800
 You can't twitch a finger and because they would be doing that to get their buddy to

52:38.800 --> 52:40.560
 move or the guy next to him, you know?

52:40.560 --> 52:43.280
 So you have to be rock solid.

52:43.280 --> 52:47.280
 Well, when we went, Terry was leaning forward as the gun was going off.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.240
 So he's moving.

52:48.240 --> 52:51.360
 And so I was like, no, no, no, false start, no, no, no, no.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.080
 And he couldn't hear me.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.280
 It was already in the water.

52:53.280 --> 52:57.920
 And so he took off like a bat out of you know where for the end of the pool and couldn't

52:57.920 --> 53:00.640
 hear me and got to the end of the pool and it was a down and back.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.720
 Well, that's a hard thing to do with a guy with no body fat.

53:05.280 --> 53:09.360
 And so he burned a lot of energy and he come up on that end of the pool and he was like,

53:09.360 --> 53:10.160
 where's, where's he at?

53:10.160 --> 53:10.800
 Cause he didn't see me.

53:11.760 --> 53:15.600
 And so we stopped him and then he came back and then we went another one and I beat him.

53:15.600 --> 53:21.040
 Um, but it's the only time that, you know, I would say that he was tuckered out.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.000
 And that's the reason why.

53:22.720 --> 53:31.920
 And, um, I'll also say this, we did a time where we timed my race, the one I won, and

53:31.920 --> 53:34.640
 then we timed his first down to the wall.

53:35.200 --> 53:39.440
 And then we timed his, the actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the

53:39.440 --> 53:41.040
 way back and he'd beat me.

53:42.080 --> 53:42.880
 That's the only time.

53:42.880 --> 53:45.600
 The way back and he'd beat me now.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.320
 How's that for being a, that's pretty honest.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.520
 That's pretty honest.

53:49.520 --> 53:50.480
 Accountable.

53:50.480 --> 53:51.200
 Wow.

53:51.200 --> 53:51.600
 Person.

53:52.320 --> 53:53.440
 And I'm going to tell you something else.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.680
 Getting in those shorts, those swim trunks.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.400
 That's impressive.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.520
 They are tight.

53:57.520 --> 53:57.760
 Yeah.

53:58.400 --> 54:05.120
 So is there, outside of wrestling, is there a thing that Terry got the better of you?

54:05.120 --> 54:10.320
 I mean, I guess this could count as one, uh, that you're still really bitter about that

54:10.320 --> 54:11.280
 you need to avenge.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.400
 I mean, that's past.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.480
 I mean, we, he's got an UNO title.

54:14.480 --> 54:16.800
 We have UNO world championships.

54:16.800 --> 54:17.920
 He's got an UNO title.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.600
 I have, I have yet to have one.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.360
 Morningstar has two titles.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.480
 That's unprecedented.

54:23.680 --> 54:26.960
 So there's only four trophies out there and Terry's got one of those and I don't have

54:26.960 --> 54:27.440
 one yet.

54:27.440 --> 54:27.920
 Yeah.

54:27.920 --> 54:28.720
 Well, it's still time.

54:29.520 --> 54:33.200
 Tom, thank you so much for letting a Russian with a tie into your home.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.640
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tom Brands.

54:36.640 --> 54:40.400
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

54:40.400 --> 54:44.560

54:45.280 --> 54:49.360

54:49.360 --> 55:10.400
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
