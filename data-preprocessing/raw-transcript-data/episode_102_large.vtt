00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Pressfield,

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
 author of several powerful nonfiction

00:06.000 --> 00:10.120
 and historical fiction books, including The War of Art,

00:10.120 --> 00:12.920
 a book that had a big impact on my life

00:12.920 --> 00:15.240
 and the life of millions of people

00:15.240 --> 00:20.000
 whose passion is to create in art, science, business,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.720
 sport, and everywhere else.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.840
 I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic,

00:26.840 --> 00:30.480
 including Turning Pro, Do the Work,

00:30.480 --> 00:35.400
 Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, and The Warrior Ethos.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.440
 Also, his books Gets a Fire about the Spartans

00:38.440 --> 00:42.640
 and the Battle of Thermopylae, The Lionsgate, Tides of War,

00:42.640 --> 00:44.480
 and others are some of the best

00:44.480 --> 00:47.440
 historical fiction novels ever written.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.800
 As some of you know, I don't shy away

00:50.800 --> 00:53.640
 from taking on a big, difficult challenge.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.920
 One of the hardest for me and for millions of others

00:56.920 --> 01:01.560
 is the discipline of staring at an empty page every day,

01:01.560 --> 01:04.840
 pushing on to think deeply, to create,

01:04.840 --> 01:07.400
 despite the millions of excuses that fill the head.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.800
 In his work, Stephen has articulated this struggle

01:11.800 --> 01:14.120
 better than anyone I've ever read.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.600
 Quick summary of the ads.

01:16.600 --> 01:21.400
 Two sponsors, The Jordan Harbinger Show and Cash App.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.520
 It really is the best way to support this podcast.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.760
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.400
 I recently considered renaming this podcast

01:46.400 --> 01:48.080
 but decided against it.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.200
 AI is my passion, and in some sense,

01:51.200 --> 01:53.560
 this podcast is not as much about AI

01:53.560 --> 01:56.000
 but more about a journey of an AI researcher

01:56.000 --> 01:58.640
 struggling to explore the human mind,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.280
 the physics of our universe,

02:00.280 --> 02:02.320
 and the nature of human behavior,

02:02.320 --> 02:07.240
 intelligence, consciousness, love, and power.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.640
 I will continue to return home to the technical,

02:09.640 --> 02:11.080
 computer science, machine learning,

02:11.080 --> 02:12.920
 engineering, math, programming,

02:12.920 --> 02:15.760
 but also venture out to talk to people

02:15.760 --> 02:17.840
 who had a big impact on my life

02:17.840 --> 02:19.880
 outside the technical fields.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.120
 Writers like Steven Pressfield and Stephen King,

02:24.120 --> 02:26.520
 musicians like Tom Waits,

02:26.520 --> 02:30.560
 political leaders like, well, you know who,

02:31.520 --> 02:32.680
 and even athletes.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.040
 I hope you join me on this journey.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.360
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

02:38.360 --> 02:39.520
 and no ads in the middle

02:39.520 --> 02:41.760
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.520
 Click on the links, buy all of the stuff.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.880
 It's the best way to support this podcast.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.880
 This episode is supported by the Jordan Harbinger Show.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.840

02:53.840 --> 02:55.760
 It's how he knows I sent you.

 On that page, there's links to subscribe to it

02:58.040 --> 03:00.840
 on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.920
 I've been binging on this podcast.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.480
 Jordan is a great human being.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.200
 He gets the best out of his guests,

03:07.200 --> 03:10.080
 dives deep, calls them out when it's needed,

03:10.080 --> 03:12.360
 and makes the whole thing fun to listen to.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.400
 He's interviewed Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban,

03:15.400 --> 03:18.960
 Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gary Kasparov, and many more.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.200
 I just finished listening to his recent conversation

03:21.200 --> 03:24.920
 with Mick West about debunking conspiracy theories.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.400
 This topic can be both fascinating and frustrating

03:28.400 --> 03:31.320
 on both sides, but in this conversation,

03:31.320 --> 03:33.400
 Jordan thread the needle beautifully,

03:33.400 --> 03:35.840
 and so it turned out to be a great listen.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.800
 I highly recommend it.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.880
 Again, go to jordanharbinger.com slash Lex.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.840
 It's how he knows I sent you.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.760
 On that page, there's links to subscribe to this show

03:45.760 --> 03:49.680
 on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.880
 This show is presented by Cash App,

03:51.880 --> 03:54.480
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.000
 When you get it, use code LexPodcast.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.920
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

04:00.920 --> 04:04.320
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.520
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

04:06.520 --> 04:08.480
 let me mention that the cryptocurrency

04:08.480 --> 04:11.960
 in the context of the history of money is fascinating.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.080
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.480
 Debits and credits on ledgers started

04:18.480 --> 04:20.720
 around 30,000 years ago.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.800
 The US dollar created over 200 years ago,

04:23.800 --> 04:26.040
 and the first decentralized cryptocurrency

04:26.040 --> 04:28.320
 released just over 10 years ago.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.240
 So given that history, cryptocurrency's still very much

04:31.240 --> 04:33.440
 in its early days of development,

04:33.440 --> 04:34.880
 but it's still aiming to,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.840
 and just might redefine the nature of money.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.480
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store

04:41.480 --> 04:44.840
 or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,

04:44.840 --> 04:49.000
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.320
 an organization that is helping advance robotics

04:51.320 --> 04:54.080
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.360
 And now, here's my conversation with Steven Pressfield.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.240
 Modern society in many ways dreams

05:03.240 --> 05:05.320
 of creating universal peace,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.880
 and yet war has molded civilization

05:08.880 --> 05:10.760
 as we know it throughout its history.

05:10.760 --> 05:15.760
 So let's start at the high philosophical level.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.800
 If you could imagine a world without war,

05:18.800 --> 05:20.440
 how would that world be different?

05:20.440 --> 05:24.800
 Perhaps put another way, what purpose has war served?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.400
 Why do we fight?

05:27.400 --> 05:31.760
 I think we're basically the same creatures internally

05:31.760 --> 05:34.440
 that we were in the cave, right?

05:34.440 --> 05:39.440
 In tribal society, back for however many,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.840
 you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of years,

05:41.840 --> 05:46.720
 which means that we're in the dynamic in our mind

05:46.720 --> 05:48.960
 is a kind of an us versus them dynamic

05:48.960 --> 05:52.000
 where our tribe is the people,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.760
 and everybody else are whatever, you know?

05:54.760 --> 05:57.000
 And I don't see that,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.520
 I don't think that's changed one iota over the centuries.

06:01.520 --> 06:06.360
 It's just a question of how one might sublimate

06:06.360 --> 06:10.120
 that urge to compete.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.760
 When you're a martial artist, you know,

06:12.760 --> 06:14.960
 a great part of your day I'm sure is dedicated

06:14.960 --> 06:19.960
 to reaching that place of total commitment

06:21.360 --> 06:23.280
 and in the face of competition,

06:23.280 --> 06:25.120
 in the face of adversity, et cetera, et cetera,

06:25.120 --> 06:28.920
 which is, I think, natural and great for the human race

06:28.920 --> 06:30.960
 on an individual basis.

06:30.960 --> 06:35.680
 So the hope that I have, if there is any hope,

06:35.680 --> 06:37.040
 personally, I don't think the human race

06:37.040 --> 06:38.920
 is gonna be around very long,

06:38.920 --> 06:43.920
 but would be in sports

06:43.920 --> 06:47.480
 or in other kind of sublimated activities

06:47.480 --> 06:51.560
 where people can act out their need for conquest

06:51.560 --> 06:53.200
 or aggression or so forth,

06:53.200 --> 06:56.080
 but at the same time relate to their opponents

06:56.080 --> 06:58.360
 as human beings, and when the game is over,

06:58.360 --> 07:01.320
 you know, you embrace your competitors, stuff like that.

07:01.320 --> 07:06.320
 So you think war was inevitable, it's a part of human nature

07:06.840 --> 07:11.840
 as opposed to a force, a creative force in society

07:11.960 --> 07:14.160
 that served a benefit.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.280
 Well, I'm sure it has benefited, you know,

07:17.280 --> 07:21.000
 spreading cultures and mixing cultures and stuff like that,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
 but I think the urge to conquest,

07:26.440 --> 07:28.040
 if you think about Alexander the Great

07:28.040 --> 07:30.360
 or Julius Caesar or Napoleon or anybody like that,

07:30.360 --> 07:33.080
 or even individual, or if we even think about

07:33.080 --> 07:36.240
 one of the plants that we're looking at right outside,

07:36.240 --> 07:39.120
 I mean, if you let a particular plant have its way,

07:39.120 --> 07:41.520
 it would take over, you know, the whole hillside.

07:41.520 --> 07:46.520
 And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great, let's say,

07:47.080 --> 07:50.760
 there were, who knows, over the face of the earth,

07:50.760 --> 07:54.240
 hundreds of little kingdoms, China, Japan,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.480
 you know, Asia, Europe, wherever,

07:56.480 --> 08:01.480
 and every prince that grew up dreamt of conquering

08:01.960 --> 08:04.580
 his neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that.

08:04.580 --> 08:09.580
 That seems to be a universal human imperative,

08:11.120 --> 08:14.040
 at least in the male of the species.

08:14.040 --> 08:14.880
 So...

08:14.880 --> 08:16.920
 The war is just a realization of that imperative.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.320
 I think so.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.120
 So you've written about Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae,

08:22.120 --> 08:23.520
 you've about Alexander the Great,

08:23.520 --> 08:26.420
 about the Six Day War in 67 in Israel,

08:28.160 --> 08:30.360
 against Egypt, Jordan, Syria.

08:30.360 --> 08:35.280
 What war, not just out of those, but in general,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.880
 do you think has been most transformative for the world?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.680
 Well, these are great questions, Lex.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.560
 Tough, easy ones, right?

08:42.560 --> 08:47.120
 I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols,

08:47.120 --> 08:49.660
 because I certainly, from what little I know,

08:49.660 --> 08:51.360
 I think that was a very,

08:51.360 --> 08:54.200
 their conquests were very transformative,

08:54.200 --> 08:59.200
 bringing cultures in a horrible, bloody way together.

09:00.520 --> 09:05.180
 But gosh, what's then the most transformative?

09:05.180 --> 09:07.480
 Maybe the Roman conquest,

09:07.480 --> 09:10.680
 establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.680
 Maybe Alexander the Great's wars

09:13.680 --> 09:18.680
 that united east and west, at least for a minute.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.760
 So building of empire.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.680
 Do you have a sense, so there's wars,

09:23.680 --> 09:28.680
 I mean, the Six Day War is not about building empires.

09:30.280 --> 09:35.280
 It's about deeply held religious, cultural conflict

09:39.180 --> 09:42.680
 and holding the line, holding the border.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.400
 And then there is conquests, like the Mongols,

09:45.400 --> 09:48.800
 that, what is it, some large percentage of the population

09:48.800 --> 09:52.240
 is a descendant of Genghis Khan, I believe, right?

09:52.240 --> 09:54.360
 So that has transformative effects.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.800
 And then World War II, I mean, personally,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.800
 and my family and so on, had transformative effects.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.080
 Let me ask you this, Lex.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.520
 Why are you, what are you trying to get at

10:03.520 --> 10:04.880
 with these questions?

10:04.880 --> 10:09.180
 What is this kind of the theme that you're aiming at?

10:09.180 --> 10:11.680
 Well, I talked to Eric Weinstein,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.800
 and he said everything is great about war

10:13.800 --> 10:15.300
 except the killing.

10:15.300 --> 10:20.300
 And there's a romantic notion of war.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.920
 Certainly there's a romantic notion of being a warrior,

10:23.920 --> 10:26.440
 but there's a romantic notion of war

10:26.440 --> 10:31.080
 that somehow there's a creative force to it,

10:32.200 --> 10:37.200
 that because we fight, out of that fighting comes culture,

10:37.280 --> 10:42.280
 comes music and art, and more and more desire to create

10:42.280 --> 10:45.780
 with the societies that win.

10:45.780 --> 10:50.780
 And to me, war is not just, hey, I have a stick

10:51.020 --> 10:53.380
 and I want your land.

10:53.380 --> 10:58.380
 It's some kind of, like it has echoes of the creative force

11:02.420 --> 11:05.940
 that makes humans unique to other animals.

11:05.940 --> 11:09.740
 Like, war is, it can't be just four people

11:09.740 --> 11:11.620
 or 10 people or 100 people.

11:11.620 --> 11:14.740
 You have to have thousands of people agreeing,

11:14.740 --> 11:19.740
 usually thousands or more, for something so deeply

11:20.500 --> 11:22.980
 that you would be willing to risk your own life.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.940
 And there's a romantic notion to that.

11:24.940 --> 11:27.500
 And because you've written so well and passionate

11:27.500 --> 11:29.940
 about some of these, I wanted to see,

11:29.940 --> 11:31.220
 because I don't have any answers,

11:31.220 --> 11:32.780
 I wanted to untangle that.

11:32.780 --> 11:37.780
 If there is a reason we fight that's more than just anger

11:37.780 --> 11:42.780
 and hate and a way to conquer.

11:43.280 --> 11:47.480
 Well, let me take it from a completely different side.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.580
 I don't think that I, in writing about war,

11:51.580 --> 11:55.240
 am really that interested in war per se.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.460
 I'm more interested in the metaphor.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.860
 I think for me, I'm really writing about my own internal

12:02.860 --> 12:07.860
 war and the war against myself and against my own resistance,

12:10.880 --> 12:13.440
 my own negativity, all of those things

12:13.440 --> 12:18.440
 that spirituality would be the opposite of.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.920
 So I'm not really an expert on war.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.720
 It's not like talking to Jim Mattis

12:25.720 --> 12:30.720
 or to Victor Davis Hanson or whatever. To me, the human being,

12:37.840 --> 12:42.840
 we are spiritual beings in a physical envelope.

12:43.080 --> 12:48.080
 And there's an automatic terrible tension within that.

12:48.220 --> 12:53.140
 And which creates a war inside ourselves.

12:53.140 --> 12:58.140
 So the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army

12:58.640 --> 13:02.440
 standing up to, whatever, 10 to one odds

13:02.440 --> 13:07.440
 or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me

13:07.600 --> 13:10.080
 of the fight we're fighting inside ourselves.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.360
 For me, the six day war was, as you know,

13:12.360 --> 13:15.600
 my feeling was it was about a return from exile.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.480
 It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment

13:19.480 --> 13:22.040
 of the state of Israel, which had never really

13:22.040 --> 13:24.840
 been completed because the holiest places

13:24.840 --> 13:27.260
 of the Jewish people were in the hands of their enemies.

13:27.260 --> 13:31.580
 So now, on the other hand, Alexander the Great's conquests,

13:31.580 --> 13:34.280
 I think, were a whole other different scenario

13:34.280 --> 13:38.680
 where the metaphor was that Alexander's father, Philip,

13:39.520 --> 13:43.360
 I think created the First Nation, capital N Nation,

13:43.360 --> 13:48.280
 and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys

13:48.280 --> 13:53.280
 who were mountain men and basically barbarians,

13:54.800 --> 13:59.720
 Macedonians, and by creating this army

13:59.720 --> 14:03.440
 and this dream of conquering the world,

14:03.440 --> 14:07.120
 which Alexander took to the, you know, really enacted,

14:07.120 --> 14:10.080
 he gave them a way of rising out of themselves,

14:10.080 --> 14:12.940
 of transcending themselves, not just individually,

14:12.940 --> 14:14.040
 but as a people.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.400
 So that would go along with what you're saying, Lex,

14:16.400 --> 14:19.260
 of a certain creativity to it.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.640
 But again, that's not, for whatever,

14:24.640 --> 14:27.720
 and I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this,

14:27.720 --> 14:29.380
 that's not really what's interesting to me

14:29.380 --> 14:31.360
 about these stories.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.580
 And the Spartans, what was a whole, at Thermopylae,

14:34.580 --> 14:37.540
 that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war.

14:37.540 --> 14:42.540
 That was a sort of a willingly going to one's own death

14:42.540 --> 14:46.140
 for a greater cause, just like, to me,

14:46.140 --> 14:49.340
 the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group

14:49.340 --> 14:52.220
 what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual,

14:52.220 --> 14:57.220
 a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.900
 I don't know if that answers your question,

14:58.900 --> 15:01.100
 but that's how I see it.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.340
 I do feel like, you know, I get invited to speak

15:04.340 --> 15:07.780
 to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time,

15:07.780 --> 15:10.580
 and I decline because I don't really feel

15:10.580 --> 15:15.540
 like I'm a spokesman for the warrior class

15:15.540 --> 15:17.140
 or anything like that.

15:18.860 --> 15:22.980
 That's not what's interesting about it to me.

15:24.860 --> 15:28.540
 But didn't you just say, with war as a metaphor,

15:28.540 --> 15:33.180
 that we're all essentially, in various ways, warriors?

15:33.180 --> 15:36.900
 If we think of it in terms of Jungian archetypes,

15:36.900 --> 15:40.900
 and think of our life at least as males,

15:40.900 --> 15:44.060
 and the earliest archetypes that kick in

15:44.060 --> 15:46.540
 are the youth and the wanderer and the student

15:46.540 --> 15:48.700
 and that kind of thing, and then at some point

15:48.700 --> 15:52.180
 around age 15 to 20, whatever,

15:52.180 --> 15:54.460
 the warrior archetype kicks in,

15:54.460 --> 15:56.700
 and we want to play football, we want to do martial arts,

15:56.700 --> 15:58.860
 we want to join the special forces,

15:58.860 --> 16:00.340
 we want to hang out with our buddies,

16:00.340 --> 16:03.140
 that's our great bond, we want to test ourselves

16:03.140 --> 16:05.360
 against adversity and so on and so forth.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.920
 But at some point, that archetype,

16:07.920 --> 16:09.740
 we move beyond that archetype,

16:09.740 --> 16:14.620
 and we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth.

16:14.620 --> 16:17.060
 And then there are many archetypes beyond that

16:17.060 --> 16:18.380
 towards the end.

16:18.380 --> 16:23.380
 So I'm interested in the warrior archetype,

16:23.460 --> 16:27.460
 but not to the be all and end all of everything else.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.780
 In my book, The Virtues of War, have you read that?

16:34.780 --> 16:37.460
 Well, there's a character named Telamon,

16:37.460 --> 16:39.460
 who's actually, it's a long story,

16:39.460 --> 16:44.380
 but when he's with Alexander's army,

16:44.380 --> 16:46.820
 and when they arrive in India,

16:46.820 --> 16:51.820
 he becomes fascinated by the gymnosophists,

16:51.860 --> 16:55.620
 the fakirs, the naked wise men, the yogis.

16:55.620 --> 17:00.020
 And he says to Alexander that these guys

17:00.020 --> 17:05.020
 are warriors beyond what we are, even though they do nothing

17:06.380 --> 17:11.380
 because they are inside their own selves all day long.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.700
 If we go to the Six Day War,

17:17.400 --> 17:19.640
 you write about, in Lionsgate,

17:19.640 --> 17:21.740
 you write about the Six Day War in Israel.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.680
 I think of the wars you've written about

17:24.680 --> 17:28.220
 as the one we're still in many ways in the midst of today.

17:28.220 --> 17:29.540
 Yes.

17:29.540 --> 17:34.540
 So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel?

17:35.860 --> 17:37.860
 The Israeli Palestinian conflict?

17:37.860 --> 17:40.820
 I mean, today it's the Israeli Palestinian conflict,

17:40.820 --> 17:44.420
 but it echoes of the same conflict

17:44.420 --> 17:47.340
 in that part of the world with Israel.

17:47.340 --> 17:52.340
 What is, in your sense, the nature of that conflict?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.060
 What can we learn about society

17:55.060 --> 17:57.180
 and human nature from that conflict?

17:57.180 --> 17:59.820
 That is one of the hottest conflicts

17:59.820 --> 18:01.780
 that still goes on today.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.700
 Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate

18:04.700 --> 18:08.700
 about the Six Day War, I wrote in the introduction

18:10.740 --> 18:14.180
 that this was not gonna be a multi sided story.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.620
 I was taking it entirely, I'm a Jew,

18:17.620 --> 18:20.140
 I identify with the Israeli people,

18:20.140 --> 18:23.740
 I was gonna see it entirely from their side.

18:23.740 --> 18:27.100
 So that's probably not what you're asking,

18:27.100 --> 18:32.100
 but to me, the Six Day War and that whole,

18:34.060 --> 18:35.780
 it's a piece of land that's holy

18:35.780 --> 18:39.620
 to at least three religions and probably more.

18:39.620 --> 18:43.760
 And from the Jewish point of view,

18:43.760 --> 18:46.220
 it's where the state of Israel,

18:46.220 --> 18:47.780
 it's where David founded Jerusalem,

18:47.780 --> 18:50.700
 it's all where the 12 tribes were, et cetera, et cetera,

18:50.700 --> 18:52.900
 where Moses came and brought the people.

18:52.900 --> 18:57.900
 So to me, the Six Day War was about,

18:58.820 --> 19:00.780
 as I said, a return from exile,

19:00.780 --> 19:03.380
 from diaspora after 2000 years.

19:03.380 --> 19:06.580
 Now, obviously, from the Palestinian point of view

19:06.580 --> 19:09.340
 or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever,

19:09.340 --> 19:12.060
 it's a whole other scenario.

19:12.060 --> 19:14.980
 Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways,

19:14.980 --> 19:15.980
 but religious beliefs.

19:15.980 --> 19:20.980
 Religion and racial slash ethnic tribal identity.

19:20.980 --> 19:23.060
 I mean, again, what is a Jew?

19:23.060 --> 19:26.220
 Is a Jew somebody that believes in the religion

19:26.220 --> 19:28.380
 or is it somebody of a certain race

19:28.380 --> 19:31.700
 that race arose in a certain place?

19:31.700 --> 19:32.740
 Same thing as a Muslim.

19:32.740 --> 19:33.580
 What is a Muslim?

19:33.580 --> 19:36.200
 Do they believe in Muhammad or whatever?

19:37.260 --> 19:40.500
 Or did they arise in a certain place and a certain ethnicity?

19:40.500 --> 19:43.020
 Because if we landed from Mars,

19:43.020 --> 19:46.260
 we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we?

19:46.260 --> 19:47.740
 Just looking at them,

19:47.740 --> 19:50.020
 you could easily mix them and you'd never know.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.260
 And the specifics of the faith

19:52.260 --> 19:54.700
 is not necessarily the thing that defines a person.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.340
 No, I don't think so.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.140
 So you could be, like many are,

19:58.140 --> 20:01.980
 secular Jew living in Israel

20:01.980 --> 20:04.100
 and still have a strong bond.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.540
 Definitely, definitely.

20:05.540 --> 20:08.460
 In fact, almost all of the Jews,

20:08.460 --> 20:12.020
 the fighters that I spoke to from the Six Day War

20:12.020 --> 20:15.020
 were secular and it really was not

20:15.020 --> 20:19.460
 a religious thing with them

20:19.460 --> 20:21.340
 as much as it was a national thing.

20:22.540 --> 20:24.820
 So having spent time in Israel,

20:27.220 --> 20:30.700
 how's the world where military conflict is directly felt

20:30.700 --> 20:33.220
 as opposed to maybe if we look at the US

20:33.220 --> 20:35.180
 where it's distant and far away?

20:35.180 --> 20:36.380
 How is that world different?

20:36.380 --> 20:37.460
 How are the people different?

20:37.460 --> 20:40.300
 It's very different, as you know.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.860
 I've never been to Israel, actually.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.620
 Oh, you haven't? I haven't felt it.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.940
 Ah, well, you should definitely go.

20:46.940 --> 20:50.260
 I mean, here in the United States,

20:51.460 --> 20:56.140
 where when an incident like Charlottesville comes up,

20:56.140 --> 20:56.980
 where people are chanting,

20:56.980 --> 20:59.260
 Jews will not replace us, blah, blah, blah,

20:59.260 --> 21:02.740
 the impulse in the Jewish community is to think of,

21:02.740 --> 21:05.820
 well, how can we reach out to the other side?

21:05.820 --> 21:10.820
 How can we show them that we are human beings like they are

21:10.820 --> 21:13.380
 and show them that we care for them, et cetera, et cetera?

21:13.380 --> 21:16.660
 That's the sort of distant from war.

21:16.660 --> 21:18.300
 From, if you're in Israel,

21:20.020 --> 21:23.860
 like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now,

21:23.860 --> 21:27.540
 you would be a fighter pilot or a tank commander or whatever.

21:27.540 --> 21:30.980
 You would not just be working at MIT or whatever.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.220
 And I would be in the army too.

21:33.220 --> 21:35.220
 And so from their point of view,

21:35.220 --> 21:38.180
 they say all those people who hate us,

21:38.180 --> 21:39.500
 can I curse on this?

21:39.500 --> 21:40.340
 Of course.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.700
 Can I curse on this thing?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.420
 Fuck them, we'll kill them.

21:43.420 --> 21:44.260
 We'll kill them.

21:44.260 --> 21:46.660
 If they dared to cross the line,

21:46.660 --> 21:49.020
 and that's their whole different point of view.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.260
 To me, it's actually a healthier point of view.

21:52.260 --> 21:53.100
 You think so?

21:53.100 --> 21:53.940
 Yeah.

21:53.940 --> 21:57.220
 So there's no, so let me ask the hard question is,

21:57.220 --> 21:59.700
 well, maybe it's an impossible question is,

21:59.700 --> 22:02.980
 how do we resolve that conflict?

22:02.980 --> 22:04.140
 In Israel and?

22:04.140 --> 22:05.420
 In Israel or?

22:05.420 --> 22:06.260
 Anywhere?

22:06.260 --> 22:09.260
 Anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in US

22:09.260 --> 22:13.900
 and say, F you and the people, yeah.

22:13.900 --> 22:18.900
 Here's my, I think that the only way that two warring sides

22:19.060 --> 22:21.460
 or two sides that are opposed to one another

22:21.460 --> 22:22.980
 can ever really come together

22:22.980 --> 22:24.660
 is when there's mutual respect,

22:24.660 --> 22:26.540
 we'll get just more water.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.380
 I got it, I got this.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.780
 When there's mutual respect

22:31.300 --> 22:33.260
 and they can see each other as equals

22:33.260 --> 22:36.740
 and when there's mutual fear, you know,

22:36.740 --> 22:40.300
 where one side says, we don't dare cross the line

22:40.300 --> 22:41.500
 with this other side,

22:41.500 --> 22:43.460
 and the other side says the same thing.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.620
 I think then you can kind of reach across that thing

22:45.620 --> 22:48.340
 and say, okay, we'll stay here, you stay here.

22:48.340 --> 22:51.580
 We'll mingle in cultural ways

22:51.580 --> 22:54.580
 and we'll have interchange, you know, winter marriage,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.060
 da, da, da, da, da, da.

22:56.060 --> 22:58.860
 But as soon as one side has no power,

22:58.860 --> 23:01.300
 as the Jewish people have had no power

23:01.300 --> 23:04.460
 throughout the diaspora forever, right?

23:04.460 --> 23:07.620
 Then it's just a human nature.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.300
 You can see it in Trump

23:09.300 --> 23:13.100
 and what he does to any vulnerable minority, right?

23:15.380 --> 23:16.500
 And he's not alone.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.460
 I'm not blaming him alone.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.860
 That's human nature.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.700
 So I do think that that idea of like, fuck you,

23:22.700 --> 23:24.740
 if you cross the line, we'll kill you,

23:24.740 --> 23:28.140
 is really a good way, is a good place to start from.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.940
 Because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table

23:30.940 --> 23:33.100
 and say, you know, what do we have in common?

23:33.100 --> 23:35.100
 How can we, we want to raise our children.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.620
 You want to raise your children.

23:36.620 --> 23:41.100
 How can we do this in a way that we're not hurting each other?

23:42.460 --> 23:45.180
 So you kind of said that you need to arrive at a balance,

23:45.180 --> 23:46.740
 some kind of balance of power.

23:46.740 --> 23:47.580
 Yeah.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.220
 But you haven't spoken to the fact

23:49.220 --> 23:54.220
 that there's deeply rooted hatred of the other.

23:54.820 --> 23:57.300
 So is there no way to alleviate that hatred?

23:57.300 --> 24:03.260
 Or is that, I mean, what role does love and hate come?

24:03.260 --> 24:04.100
 I think that hatred can go away.

24:04.100 --> 24:04.940
 I really do.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.140
 I mean, if you look at even now

24:07.140 --> 24:09.700
 that I haven't seen this in person,

24:09.700 --> 24:12.700
 but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis

24:12.700 --> 24:15.220
 are collaborating in certain things, you know,

24:15.220 --> 24:18.500
 by their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran.

24:19.420 --> 24:24.420
 I do think that even really long, long, longstanding

24:24.420 --> 24:27.700
 hatreds and animosities, thousands of years old,

24:27.700 --> 24:30.660
 can go away under the right circumstances.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.020
 In a, on what time scale?

24:34.540 --> 24:37.340
 I mean, for instance, I don't know if there's some,

24:37.340 --> 24:39.220
 do people have to die?

24:39.220 --> 24:41.380
 Do generations have to die and pass away

24:41.380 --> 24:44.340
 and new generations come up with less hate?

24:44.340 --> 24:47.180
 Or can a single individual learn to not hate?

24:47.180 --> 24:49.420
 I think a single individual can learn to not hate

24:49.420 --> 24:50.860
 because it certainly doesn't seem to,

24:50.860 --> 24:52.940
 over thousands of years, doesn't seem to work.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.340
 You know, we keep thinking that that's gonna happen.

24:55.340 --> 25:00.340
 But I think it's, we're in a real spiritual realm here

25:00.740 --> 25:02.140
 when you're talking about that.

25:02.140 --> 25:05.660
 You're in a realm of, you know, Buddha, Jesus, whatever,

25:05.660 --> 25:09.500
 something like that, that where, you know,

25:10.460 --> 25:13.380
 a true change of soul happens.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.020
 But I do think that's possible.

25:16.340 --> 25:20.700
 So what do you think is the future of warfare?

25:20.700 --> 25:25.140
 Especially with what many people see as the expansion

25:25.140 --> 25:27.340
 of the military industrial conflict.

25:27.340 --> 25:31.600
 To what, do you, I know you're not a military historian.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.260
 I'm asking more as a metaphor.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.380
 And do you see us as people continuing to fight?

25:41.380 --> 25:43.740
 You know, it's a really great question, Alex,

25:43.740 --> 25:48.740
 because I think now with social media, TV, movies,

25:48.740 --> 25:53.740
 all of these things that create empathy across cultures,

25:55.220 --> 25:58.820
 it becomes harder and harder, I think, I think,

25:58.820 --> 26:02.080
 to totally demonize the other,

26:02.080 --> 26:05.100
 the way it was in previous wars.

26:05.100 --> 26:08.780
 I also think, I don't really see an appetite

26:08.780 --> 26:12.060
 for people wanting to go to war these days.

26:12.060 --> 26:15.140
 And in a way, I don't know if that's good or bad.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.580
 It's like everybody's so fat and lazy

26:17.580 --> 26:20.500
 and so concerned with how many clicks they're getting

26:20.500 --> 26:25.500
 that, you know, whereas I know at the start of World War I,

26:26.420 --> 26:30.900
 both the younger generations were eager to go to war.

26:30.900 --> 26:34.500
 You know, I think it was insane,

26:34.500 --> 26:36.540
 but it was that sort of warrior archetype

26:36.540 --> 26:38.540
 that we were talking about before that,

26:38.540 --> 26:43.540
 that generational testosterone eros thing.

26:43.540 --> 26:48.060
 Whereas nowadays, I don't know.

26:48.060 --> 26:52.180
 I mean, it's hard to say there's not gonna be another war

26:52.180 --> 26:53.940
 because there always are,

26:53.940 --> 26:55.780
 but it's sort of hard to imagine people

26:55.780 --> 26:59.380
 getting off their ass these days to do anything.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.460
 Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media

27:01.460 --> 27:03.700
 as a place for empathy, sure.

27:03.700 --> 27:08.140
 But in a sense, it's a place for war as well.

27:08.140 --> 27:08.980
 For hatred, yeah, true.

27:08.980 --> 27:09.820
 For hatred.

27:09.820 --> 27:14.820
 And perhaps the positive aspect of hatred on social media

27:16.700 --> 27:21.340
 is that it's somewhat less harmful than murder.

27:22.220 --> 27:26.140
 And so it kind of dissipates sort of the hatefuls.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.580
 You get the hate out at a less,

27:35.100 --> 27:37.900
 on a daily basis and thereby never boils up

27:37.900 --> 27:39.460
 to a point where you want to kill.

27:39.460 --> 27:42.300
 It's also a really weird thing that's going on

27:42.300 --> 27:43.820
 that I don't know if anybody really understands,

27:43.820 --> 27:47.700
 like with video games where kids are acting out

27:47.700 --> 27:49.980
 these incredible horror things, right?

27:49.980 --> 27:52.660
 But you know that if they cut their finger,

27:52.660 --> 27:55.860
 they would like freak out, you know?

27:55.860 --> 27:58.860
 And I also don't think that many of the people

27:58.860 --> 28:02.380
 that are hateful on social media,

28:02.380 --> 28:05.260
 if they were face to face with the person, they wouldn't.

28:05.260 --> 28:10.260
 So there's a sort of two mental spheres

28:11.060 --> 28:13.180
 happening at the same time.

28:13.180 --> 28:15.620
 And I don't know how that plays out.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.260
 Maps to the actual military,

28:17.260 --> 28:19.220
 how that actually maps to military conflict.

28:19.220 --> 28:20.060
 Yeah, yeah.

28:21.020 --> 28:25.380
 Like if you in the United States have a draft, for example,

28:25.380 --> 28:28.300
 how the populace would respond different than they did

28:28.300 --> 28:29.460
 in previous generations.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.820
 Yeah, I think they certainly would.

28:30.820 --> 28:31.780
 Yeah.

28:31.780 --> 28:34.260
 Another question, not sure if you've thought about it,

28:34.260 --> 28:38.140
 but I work on building artificial intelligence systems.

28:38.140 --> 28:39.780
 In our community, many people are worried

28:39.780 --> 28:41.740
 about AI being used in war.

28:41.740 --> 28:46.740
 So automating the killing process with drones

28:46.940 --> 28:49.080
 and in general, it's being used more and more.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.680
 I should recuse myself on that one.

28:50.680 --> 28:51.740
 I really haven't thought about that one.

28:51.740 --> 28:52.580
 You haven't thought about it.

28:52.580 --> 28:55.300
 I'd rather ask you what you think about it.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.260
 Well, it's interesting, I mean,

28:56.260 --> 28:57.920
 because it's so fundamentally different

28:57.920 --> 29:02.020
 from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae.

29:02.020 --> 29:05.020
 It means just if we talk about the difference between a gun

29:05.020 --> 29:07.460
 and a sword.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.360
 I'll tell you one little anecdote.

29:09.360 --> 29:13.540
 There was a Spartan king, I don't know which one it was,

29:13.540 --> 29:16.540
 but at one point they showed him a new invention

29:16.540 --> 29:20.620
 and it could launch a bolt that would kill someone

29:20.620 --> 29:22.380
 at a range of 200 yards.

29:22.380 --> 29:27.380
 And the king wept and said, alas, valor is no more.

29:27.380 --> 29:30.460
 Because their point of view of war,

29:30.460 --> 29:32.740
 it was highly ritualized, as you know,

29:32.740 --> 29:37.420
 and the code of honor was that you were not supposed

29:37.420 --> 29:39.420
 to be able to kill another person

29:39.420 --> 29:43.180
 unless you yourself were in equal danger of being killed.

29:43.180 --> 29:44.740
 And any other way of doing that,

29:44.740 --> 29:49.740
 even bow and arrow was considered less than manly

29:50.540 --> 29:51.700
 and less than honorable.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.220
 And maybe we should go back to that

29:53.220 --> 29:56.540
 because at least it makes the stakes real and true.

29:56.540 --> 30:01.540
 Not that we could.

30:02.220 --> 30:04.980
 Not that's the point.

30:04.980 --> 30:06.660
 You were in the Marine Corps,

30:06.660 --> 30:11.660
 so we talk about the real, the bloody conflicts

30:13.780 --> 30:16.620
 that you've written about, many of them.

30:16.620 --> 30:20.280
 So let me ask a personal question.

30:21.180 --> 30:24.340
 Have you, sort of as a writing and in general,

30:24.340 --> 30:28.940
 have you thought about what it takes to kill a person

30:30.260 --> 30:33.180
 if you yourself could do it in the war?

30:33.180 --> 30:34.220
 I have thought about it, yeah.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.920
 And how that would make you feel?

30:37.940 --> 30:39.660
 Of course, one never knows.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.340
 I certainly, I have not been in combat.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.140
 I haven't killed anybody.

30:43.140 --> 30:47.700
 But I would imagine in the real world

30:47.700 --> 30:51.720
 that it would change you utterly forever.

30:51.720 --> 30:56.720
 Because you can't help but identify

30:58.880 --> 31:01.280
 with the person that you've just killed.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.920
 And it's another human being.

31:02.920 --> 31:07.100
 And I mean, I have a hard time killing a spider.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.880
 So I would imagine that it's something

31:09.880 --> 31:14.260
 that warriors understand and nobody else understands.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.760
 And you've spoken with many.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.320
 How, I mean, you've spoken with people

31:19.320 --> 31:21.940
 who've seen military combat in Israel.

31:23.160 --> 31:26.640
 What, have they been able to articulate

31:26.640 --> 31:28.980
 the experience of killing?

31:28.980 --> 31:31.100
 It's sort of just what I said.

31:31.100 --> 31:34.600
 I mean, I'm even thinking of one pilot

31:34.600 --> 31:36.580
 that I interviewed over there

31:37.880 --> 31:42.880
 who was strafing a tank in his Mustang

31:45.180 --> 31:48.120
 and saw, at really low altitude,

31:48.120 --> 31:50.880
 and saw what his bullets did to the guy

31:50.880 --> 31:52.920
 and could see his face and everything like that,

31:52.920 --> 31:56.360
 which is even one remove or more removes

31:56.360 --> 31:59.200
 from an infantryman, what an infantryman does.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.000
 And he said that same thing that I said,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.600
 that it just changes you and you can never say it,

32:04.600 --> 32:07.000
 never look at the world or look at anything

32:07.000 --> 32:08.640
 the same way again.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.700
 And when that happens at scale,

32:10.700 --> 32:13.120
 it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.600
 That changes entire societies.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.560
 I mean, that's what we've seen.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.200
 At least it, but the problem is

32:18.200 --> 32:20.440
 it doesn't change the politicians back home.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.280
 Right.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.280
 How important is mortality, finiteness,

32:28.480 --> 32:32.280
 the fact that this thing ends to the creative process?

32:32.280 --> 32:37.280
 So, killing and war really emphasizes that,

32:37.800 --> 32:41.380
 but in general, the fact that this thing ends.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.920
 It does?

32:43.920 --> 32:46.280
 It does, and uh.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.120
 Shit.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.560
 And on a serious note,

32:51.560 --> 32:53.640
 do you think about your own mortality?

32:53.640 --> 32:55.520
 Do you meditate on your own mortality

32:55.520 --> 32:57.240
 when you think about the work you do?

32:57.240 --> 32:59.320
 That's another great question, Lex.

32:59.320 --> 33:03.480
 I actually, I'm 75, and I just was having,

33:03.480 --> 33:05.620
 I had breakfast in New York a few months ago

33:05.620 --> 33:08.880
 with a friend of mine who's like my exact same age.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.720
 And I said to him, I said,

33:10.720 --> 33:12.940
 Nick, do you ever think about mortality?

33:12.940 --> 33:16.680
 And he said, every fucking minute of every day.

33:16.680 --> 33:21.020
 And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do too.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.640
 But actually, I always have, I think.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.360
 And I think, you know, the fact of mortality

33:31.000 --> 33:32.460
 gives meaning to life, you know?

33:32.460 --> 33:34.520
 I think that's why we want to create.

33:36.160 --> 33:39.540
 That's why we want to make a mark of some kind.

33:39.540 --> 33:43.980
 Or, and the other aspect of it is

33:43.980 --> 33:46.860
 what's on the other side of that mortality?

33:46.860 --> 33:49.500
 I'm a believer in previous lives.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.780
 So I sort of, and I,

33:52.780 --> 33:54.980
 the question I've never been able to answer

33:54.980 --> 33:58.740
 among many, many others is like, why are we even here?

33:58.740 --> 34:01.620
 Why are we in the flesh?

34:01.620 --> 34:04.060
 You know, I sort of, I like to believe that God

34:04.060 --> 34:13.060
 or some force is, we're on some kind of journey, but I'm not sure why,

34:13.060 --> 34:17.340
 why we were put in this world where the ground rules are,

34:17.340 --> 34:19.980
 if you think about animal life,

34:19.980 --> 34:22.660
 that you cannot live from one day to the next

34:22.660 --> 34:26.780
 without killing and eating some other form of life.

34:26.780 --> 34:29.820
 I mean, what a demented thing, you know?

34:29.820 --> 34:33.100
 Why couldn't we just have a solar panel on our head

34:33.100 --> 34:35.500
 and, you know, be friends with everybody?

34:35.500 --> 34:40.160
 So I sort of, I don't get what that was all about,

34:40.160 --> 34:42.380
 but that's sort of the big issue.

34:42.380 --> 34:46.160
 Have you read to Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, for example?

34:46.160 --> 34:51.160
 Is Ernest Becker's a philosopher that said that the death,

34:52.100 --> 34:57.100
 that the fear of death is really the primary driver

34:57.380 --> 34:58.420
 of everything we do.

34:58.420 --> 35:00.460
 So Freud had what the?

35:00.460 --> 35:02.420
 Right, I would agree with that.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.660
 So to you, you've always thought about your,

35:04.660 --> 35:06.080
 even your own mortality.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.820
 Yes, definitely.

35:07.820 --> 35:13.780
 And can you elaborate on the reincarnation aspect

35:13.780 --> 35:14.780
 of what you were talking about?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.540
 Like that we kind of, what's your sense

35:17.540 --> 35:19.580
 that we had previous lives?

35:20.860 --> 35:22.720
 In what, have you thought concretely

35:22.720 --> 35:24.900
 or is it a lot of it kind of is?

35:24.900 --> 35:27.540
 No, I've thought concretely about it.

35:27.540 --> 35:32.540
 I mean, it's very clear when you see children,

35:32.860 --> 35:36.780
 young kids, or even dogs and cats,

35:36.780 --> 35:40.620
 that they come into the world with personalities, you know,

35:40.620 --> 35:43.700
 and three kids in a family are gonna be completely different

35:43.700 --> 35:45.420
 and completely their own person.

35:45.420 --> 35:50.420
 And that person that they are doesn't change over life.

35:50.420 --> 35:57.420
 And I, you know, there's one of the things that I did in my book

35:58.100 --> 36:00.420
 The Artist's Journey is that there were certain things

36:00.420 --> 36:02.900
 where I tracked or just listed in order,

36:02.900 --> 36:05.400
 like all of Bruce Springsteen's albums

36:05.400 --> 36:07.900
 or all of Philip Roth's books, you know,

36:07.900 --> 36:10.180
 kind of a body of work throughout over, you know,

36:10.180 --> 36:13.020
 a period of 30, 40, 50 years, you know.

36:13.020 --> 36:18.020
 And you can see that there's a theme running through all

36:18.020 --> 36:22.740
 of those things, that it's completely unique to that person.

36:22.740 --> 36:25.140
 Nobody else could have written Philip Roth's books

36:25.140 --> 36:28.060
 or Bruce Springsteen's songs.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.620
 And you can even see sort of a destiny there.

36:31.620 --> 36:36.020
 So I ask myself, well, where did that come from?

36:36.020 --> 36:41.020
 What, it seems to be a continuation of something that was,

36:41.220 --> 36:44.420
 that happened before, and that will lead to something else

36:44.420 --> 36:47.020
 because it's not starting from scratch.

36:47.020 --> 36:52.020
 It seems like there's a calling, a destiny in there already.

36:53.340 --> 36:56.020
 This gets back to the muse and all that kind of thing.

36:56.020 --> 36:59.540
 So yeah, it's almost like the, there's this,

36:59.540 --> 37:03.380
 let's call it a God, it's passing,

37:03.380 --> 37:07.300
 it's almost like sampling parts of a previous human

37:07.300 --> 37:10.840
 that has lived and putting those into the new one.

37:11.740 --> 37:14.060
 Sampling is probably a pretty good word.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.700
 Taking some of the good, well, you can't take

37:15.700 --> 37:17.500
 all the good parts because the bad parts

37:17.500 --> 37:19.660
 is what makes the person.

37:19.660 --> 37:21.160
 Let's say you're taking it all together.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.060
 Okay, this is humans only, or does it pass around

37:24.060 --> 37:25.360
 from animals in your view?

37:26.340 --> 37:29.580
 I don't know, that's above my pay grade, I don't know.

37:29.580 --> 37:33.180
 So, okay, so you talk about the muse

37:33.180 --> 37:38.180
 as the source of ideas maybe.

37:39.240 --> 37:44.240
 Since you've gotten a few glimpses of her in your writing,

37:44.240 --> 37:49.240
 tell me, what is it possible for you to tell me about her?

37:51.680 --> 37:53.680
 Where does she reside?

37:53.680 --> 37:54.920
 What does she look like?

37:54.920 --> 37:57.680
 I mean, you can look at it many different ways, right?

37:57.680 --> 38:00.480
 The Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic way, right?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.840
 They created gods that were like human beings.

38:03.720 --> 38:07.440
 But if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish perspective,

38:07.440 --> 38:09.440
 Jewish mysticism, you could say

38:09.440 --> 38:11.800
 that it's the soul, the neshama, right?

38:11.800 --> 38:14.320
 That the soul is above us on a higher plane,

38:14.320 --> 38:16.480
 our own, your soul, my soul,

38:16.480 --> 38:21.360
 and is trying to reach down to us and communicate with us.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.680
 And we're trying simultaneously to reach up to it

38:24.680 --> 38:28.520
 through prayer or through, if you're a writer or an artist,

38:28.520 --> 38:31.000
 you know, when you sit down at the keyboard,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.580
 you're entering into a kind of prayer.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.520
 You're entering into a different state

38:35.520 --> 38:39.480
 of an altered consciousness to some extent.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.840
 You're opening yourself, opening the pipeline,

38:41.840 --> 38:44.080
 or turning on the radio to tune into

38:44.080 --> 38:46.640
 the cosmic radio station.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.280
 And another way of looking at it, this is an,

38:49.280 --> 38:53.800
 did you ever see the movie City of Angels?

38:53.800 --> 38:58.800
 The visual of the movie, it was Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.200
 Yeah, yeah, I've seen it, yep.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.200
 And right, the visual of the movie sort of was

39:05.240 --> 39:08.960
 Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.320
 And as she's operating on somebody,

39:11.320 --> 39:14.780
 suddenly Nicolas Cage in this long duster coat,

39:14.780 --> 39:17.680
 like Jesse James, appears right next to her

39:17.680 --> 39:19.920
 in the operating room, and he's an angel.

39:19.920 --> 39:23.520
 And he's waiting to take out the soul

39:23.520 --> 39:27.000
 of the patient on the operating table.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.720
 And she doesn't see him, she's totally unaware of him.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.820
 And so is everybody else in the operating room,

39:31.820 --> 39:33.920
 except maybe the guy who's about to die,

39:33.920 --> 39:35.480
 who suddenly sees him.

39:35.480 --> 39:40.480
 But I kind of believe that there are beings like that,

39:42.160 --> 39:44.640
 or if you don't like that, it's a force,

39:44.640 --> 39:46.840
 it's a consciousness, it's something

39:46.840 --> 39:48.480
 that are right here, right now.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.560
 And they're trying to communicate to us.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.200
 And like through a membrane,

39:57.200 --> 39:59.160
 like tapping on that window over there,

39:59.160 --> 40:00.720
 they're like right out there.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.600
 And they carry the future.

40:03.600 --> 40:08.160
 They are everything that is in potential.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.340
 All the works that you will do, Lex,

40:11.340 --> 40:14.480
 your startup, whatever else you're doing,

40:14.480 --> 40:17.780
 they know that.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.800
 And it's not really you

40:19.800 --> 40:22.680
 that's coming up with those ideas, in my opinion.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.740
 Those things are appearing,

40:24.740 --> 40:28.080
 it's like somebody knocks on the door and puts it in.

40:28.080 --> 40:33.080
 I mean, in the Iliad, where gods and goddesses appear,

40:33.880 --> 40:35.840
 along with the human antagonists

40:35.840 --> 40:37.960
 on the battlefield all the time, right?

40:37.960 --> 40:40.880
 There'll be, you know, Homer flashes to Olympus

40:40.880 --> 40:42.520
 and then back to the real world.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.280
 And there's a thing where one Aphrodite,

40:45.280 --> 40:47.880
 let's say wants to help Paris.

40:47.880 --> 40:52.520
 And so she says, well, I will appear to him in a dream.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.800
 And I'll take the form of his brother

40:55.800 --> 40:57.680
 and I'll say, bump, bump, bump, bump.

40:57.680 --> 41:02.680
 So that's creatures, beings on one dimension,

41:03.520 --> 41:06.600
 as the Greeks saw it, communicating with,

41:06.600 --> 41:09.380
 and I believe that that's exactly what's going on,

41:09.380 --> 41:12.560
 in one, whatever analogy you want to use.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.800
 That communication, to which degree

41:17.600 --> 41:20.500
 do you play the role in that communication?

41:20.500 --> 41:23.080
 As opposed to sitting at the computer,

41:23.080 --> 41:27.120
 if you're a writer, and staring at the blank page

41:27.120 --> 41:29.440
 and putting in the time and waiting.

41:30.640 --> 41:35.640
 So if, in your view, are these creatures

41:39.240 --> 41:42.040
 basically waiting to tell you about your future?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
 Or is there choice?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.720
 How many possible futures are there?

41:46.720 --> 41:48.480
 How many possible ideas are there?

41:48.480 --> 41:49.680
 That's a great question.

41:49.680 --> 41:54.440
 I think there's basically, yes, there are alternatives,

41:54.440 --> 41:56.800
 you know, degrees within it.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.700
 But if you look at Bruce Springsteen's albums,

42:01.280 --> 42:05.840
 how much could he have done really differently?

42:05.840 --> 42:08.120
 Yeah, he would, you can just see

42:08.120 --> 42:11.360
 there's a whole impetus going through the whole thing.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.080
 And nothing was going to shake him off that, you know?

42:14.080 --> 42:16.880
 And yeah, maybe the river could have been different,

42:16.880 --> 42:18.960
 could have been called something else,

42:18.960 --> 42:23.080
 but he was dealing with certain issues.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.220
 His conscious self was dealing with certain issues

42:26.220 --> 42:28.040
 that were really out of his control.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.900
 He was drawn, he was called to it, right?

42:30.900 --> 42:32.760
 Nothing could stop him.

42:32.760 --> 42:37.320
 And so it is sort of a partnership, I think,

42:37.320 --> 42:41.640
 the creative process, between the creative impulse

42:41.640 --> 42:43.600
 that's coming from some other place,

42:45.360 --> 42:47.120
 or it's coming from deep within us

42:47.120 --> 42:48.480
 is another way to look at it.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.520
 You know, it's like if we are acorns

42:50.520 --> 42:53.300
 and we're growing into oaks.

42:53.300 --> 42:58.200
 So the conscious artist,

42:58.200 --> 43:01.040
 who's sitting there at the keyboard or whatever,

43:01.040 --> 43:04.800
 is applying his or her consciousness to that,

43:04.800 --> 43:08.960
 but is also going into opening themselves

43:08.960 --> 43:11.120
 to the unconscious or to this other realm,

43:11.120 --> 43:13.140
 whatever that is.

43:13.140 --> 43:16.200
 I mean, certainly songwriters for a million years

43:16.200 --> 43:18.280
 have said, you know, a song just came into their head,

43:18.280 --> 43:19.120
 right?

43:19.120 --> 43:21.020
 A poem, just all they had to do was write.

43:21.020 --> 43:23.920
 But then, you ever see that thing where,

43:23.920 --> 43:28.360
 of Keats's notes for a thing of beauty is a joy forever?

43:28.360 --> 43:29.760
 It's like covers an entire page,

43:29.760 --> 43:32.000
 and it's like, you know, he's crossing this out

43:32.000 --> 43:33.080
 and that out, and he has to go.

43:33.080 --> 43:36.660
 His consciousness is, his conscious mind is working on it.

43:36.660 --> 43:39.600
 But, so I do think it's a partnership.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.800
 And I think that, I know when I was first starting out

43:42.800 --> 43:45.680
 as a writer, I worked in advertising,

43:45.680 --> 43:49.040
 and I tried to do novels that I could never do.

43:49.040 --> 43:54.040
 I was like, really unskilled at getting to that,

43:54.880 --> 43:56.760
 tuning into that station.

43:56.760 --> 44:01.760
 I just, I beat my brains out and was unable to do it,

44:01.900 --> 44:03.240
 you know, except in,

44:03.240 --> 44:05.320
 because I was sort of trying too hard,

44:05.320 --> 44:08.980
 it was sort of like a Zen monk or a monk of some kind

44:08.980 --> 44:12.520
 trying to meditate and just like constantly thoughts

44:12.520 --> 44:14.240
 driving you crazy.

44:14.240 --> 44:16.420
 But over time, you know, knock wood,

44:16.420 --> 44:19.280
 I've kind of gotten better at it.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.200
 And I can sort of let go of those,

44:22.200 --> 44:25.520
 that part of me that's trying so hard.

44:25.520 --> 44:30.520
 And so these angels can speak a little more easily

44:31.140 --> 44:32.400
 through the membrane.

44:32.400 --> 44:36.760
 Can you put into words the process of letting go

44:36.760 --> 44:40.080
 and clearing that channel of communication?

44:40.080 --> 44:41.080
 What does it take?

44:41.080 --> 44:42.200
 That's another great question.

44:42.200 --> 44:46.440
 For me, it just took, it took probably 30 years.

44:46.440 --> 44:49.680
 And I don't even, I guess I would liken it to meditation,

44:49.680 --> 44:51.280
 even though I'm not a meditator.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.720
 But it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things

44:54.720 --> 44:59.720
 in the world to just sit still and stop thinking, right?

45:00.560 --> 45:03.240
 And so it's very hard to put into words.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.400
 And I think that's why these teachers of meditation

45:06.400 --> 45:10.880
 use tricks and koans and stuff like that.

45:10.880 --> 45:15.500
 But for me, at least, I think it was just a process

45:15.500 --> 45:17.920
 of years of years and years of trying,

45:17.920 --> 45:20.560
 and finally beating my head in the wall.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.840
 And finally, little by little giving up

45:22.840 --> 45:25.080
 the beating of the head.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.000
 But there doesn't seem to be any trick.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.580
 Everybody wants a hack these days.

45:30.580 --> 45:32.280
 And I don't think there is a hack.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.360
 If you look at it in terms of the goddess, the muse,

45:37.360 --> 45:39.360
 she's watching you down there,

45:39.360 --> 45:40.800
 beating your head in the wall.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.560
 You're like a Marine going through an obstacle course,

45:43.560 --> 45:46.080
 or a martial artist trying to learn,

45:46.080 --> 45:49.000
 like Uma Thurman doing the casket deal,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.800
 trying to make that little four inch punch, you know?

45:54.040 --> 45:56.400
 The muse or the goddess is just sort of watching,

45:56.400 --> 45:59.620
 going, it's Lex, he's trying, he's trying.

45:59.620 --> 46:01.380
 I'm gonna come back in another couple of months

46:01.380 --> 46:03.080
 and see if he's still there.

46:03.080 --> 46:06.160
 And finally, she'll say, all right, he's had it,

46:06.160 --> 46:09.760
 he's paid his dues, I'm gonna give it to him.

46:09.760 --> 46:13.560
 So, the hard work and the suffering, yeah.

46:13.560 --> 46:18.560
 But I'm also, being Russian, in wrestling and martial arts,

46:18.740 --> 46:21.080
 we're big into drilling technique.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.200
 I was also just even getting at,

46:24.560 --> 46:26.360
 certainly there's no shortcut.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.100
 But is there a process?

46:28.100 --> 46:33.100
 So you're, that can be, the process of practice.

46:33.100 --> 46:35.660
 So you had two.

46:35.660 --> 46:39.020
 One, you had an example of meditation.

46:39.020 --> 46:41.860
 So it's essentially the practice of meditation.

46:41.860 --> 46:42.700
 Is you sitting here?

46:42.700 --> 46:44.100
 I think a lot of drill, I think,

46:44.100 --> 46:45.980
 is a good way to look at it too.

46:45.980 --> 46:48.220
 But what are you drilling?

46:48.220 --> 46:50.220
 You're just sitting and?

46:50.220 --> 46:51.780
 You're writing, you know?

46:51.780 --> 46:52.620
 Just writing.

46:52.620 --> 46:55.540
 You're writing, then you're looking at what you wrote,

46:55.540 --> 46:56.380
 you know?

46:56.380 --> 47:00.660
 You're hitting moments when it flows, you know?

47:00.660 --> 47:02.600
 And then your other hitting moments

47:02.600 --> 47:03.740
 where you just can't do anything.

47:03.740 --> 47:07.060
 And you're trying to, from the moments where it flowed,

47:07.060 --> 47:08.500
 you're trying to come back and look at it and say,

47:08.500 --> 47:09.820
 what did I do?

47:09.820 --> 47:11.600
 How did that happen?

47:11.600 --> 47:13.780
 Where was my mind, you know?

47:13.780 --> 47:16.300
 But I think it's just a process of over and over

47:16.300 --> 47:21.160
 and over and over until finally it gets a little bit easier.

47:22.220 --> 47:26.420
 And did you always, when you read something you write,

47:26.420 --> 47:28.620
 did you always have a pretty good radar

47:28.620 --> 47:33.100
 for what's good and not after it's written?

47:33.100 --> 47:33.940
 No.

47:33.940 --> 47:37.460
 I think I do now.

47:37.460 --> 47:42.460
 But no, it was always really hard

47:42.860 --> 47:44.340
 for me to know what was good.

47:45.680 --> 47:48.220
 I mean, do you edit, the process of editing

47:49.300 --> 47:52.100
 is the process of looking at what you've written

47:52.100 --> 47:54.060
 and improving it.

47:54.060 --> 47:56.460
 Are you a better writer or an editor?

47:56.460 --> 47:57.820
 How often do you edit?

47:57.820 --> 47:59.300
 That's another great question.

47:59.300 --> 48:00.140
 Great question.

48:00.140 --> 48:01.980
 Cause I do think that in writing,

48:01.980 --> 48:03.740
 the real process of looking at it

48:03.740 --> 48:05.820
 is the process that an editor does

48:05.820 --> 48:08.100
 rather than what a writer does.

48:08.100 --> 48:10.420
 The gentleman I was just talking to on the phone

48:10.420 --> 48:12.020
 is my editor, Sean Coyne,

48:12.020 --> 48:14.600
 who was the guy who bought Gates of Fire

48:14.600 --> 48:16.780
 when he was an editor at Doubleday.

48:16.780 --> 48:20.360
 And who basically when I finish a book, I give it to him.

48:21.220 --> 48:23.860
 And he gives me, you know,

48:23.860 --> 48:28.860
 editing doesn't really mean like crossing out commas.

48:29.580 --> 48:34.220
 It really means looking at the overall work

48:34.220 --> 48:36.380
 and saying, does it work?

48:36.380 --> 48:39.100
 And if it doesn't work, why doesn't it work?

48:39.100 --> 48:41.020
 Is there something wrong here?

48:41.020 --> 48:44.540
 You know, like if you were building the Golden Gate Bridge,

48:44.540 --> 48:46.620
 you know, and one span was out of whack, you know,

48:46.620 --> 48:50.260
 you could, and I think a really skilled editor,

48:50.260 --> 48:54.860
 which Sean is, understands what makes a story tick.

48:54.860 --> 48:58.220
 And he also has the perspective that I've lost

48:58.220 --> 49:01.060
 in something I've wrote, cause I'm so close to it,

49:01.060 --> 49:06.020
 to say, you know, this isn't working and that is working.

49:06.020 --> 49:07.700
 What kind of advice has he given you?

49:07.700 --> 49:09.900
 Is it like layout?

49:09.900 --> 49:12.700
 Like this story doesn't flow correctly.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.180
 Like you shouldn't start at this point.

49:15.180 --> 49:18.580
 Or does he even sit back at a higher level and say,

49:18.580 --> 49:22.460
 I see what you're doing, but you could do better.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.020
 No, he doesn't do that.

49:24.020 --> 49:28.180
 But a lot of it is about genre

49:28.180 --> 49:32.620
 and kind of the defining what genre you're working in.

49:32.620 --> 49:37.140
 And I'm gonna get up here to just bring something over here

49:37.140 --> 49:37.980
 for the camera.

49:39.220 --> 49:42.540
 This was one where Sean tore this down

49:42.540 --> 49:44.540
 and made me start from scratch.

49:44.540 --> 49:47.820
 And what the specifics of it were really,

49:47.820 --> 49:50.140
 this is a supernatural thriller.

49:50.140 --> 49:51.380
 That's the genre.

49:51.380 --> 49:55.980
 Sort of like Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist.

49:55.980 --> 50:00.460
 And what he showed me was that I had violated

50:00.460 --> 50:02.540
 certain conventions of the genre.

50:05.460 --> 50:08.300
 And you just can't do that.

50:08.300 --> 50:12.660
 It's gotta be, it has to be done the right way.

50:12.660 --> 50:17.660
 And so he pointed out certain things to me.

50:18.820 --> 50:22.860
 So he must be a prolific reader himself too, actually.

50:22.860 --> 50:26.060
 That's such a tough job of editor.

50:26.060 --> 50:26.900
 Yeah.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.620
 Again, he was sort of born to do that.

50:28.620 --> 50:30.500
 He just kind of glommed onto it.

50:31.900 --> 50:36.900
 But since he was his first job publishing

50:36.900 --> 50:41.900
 cat thrillers, cat detective books,

50:43.020 --> 50:46.220
 he studied how it works, what makes a story work,

50:46.220 --> 50:47.060
 et cetera, et cetera.

50:47.060 --> 50:48.940
 And so he really, he's great.

50:48.940 --> 50:52.340
 And I think any really successful writer,

50:52.340 --> 50:55.300
 unless they're utterly brilliant on their own,

50:55.300 --> 50:57.740
 has gotta have a great editor behind them.

50:57.740 --> 51:00.100
 But you yourself edit as well.

51:00.100 --> 51:03.940
 I'm constantly trying to learn from him and teach myself.

51:03.940 --> 51:07.580
 Everything you see in my blog posts

51:07.580 --> 51:09.460
 that it's about the craft of writing

51:09.460 --> 51:12.860
 is me trying to teach myself the rules

51:12.860 --> 51:15.660
 so that, I'm sure it's the same in martial arts

51:15.660 --> 51:16.860
 or anything else, right?

51:16.860 --> 51:21.740
 You try to not be dependent on that other person

51:21.740 --> 51:24.300
 because it's so painful to make those mistakes.

51:24.300 --> 51:27.060
 You really feel like, ah, I wish I could get it right

51:27.060 --> 51:29.100
 the first time the next time I do it.

51:29.100 --> 51:30.980
 Well, in research, we go through that.

51:30.980 --> 51:33.100
 In research more than writing,

51:33.100 --> 51:35.780
 so what you do is a little more solitary.

51:35.780 --> 51:38.340
 In research, there's usually two, three, four people

51:38.340 --> 51:41.220
 working on something together and we write a paper.

51:41.220 --> 51:44.220
 And there's that painful process of where you write it down

51:44.220 --> 51:46.420
 and then you share it with other.

51:46.420 --> 51:49.940
 And not only do they criticize the writing,

51:49.940 --> 51:53.380
 they criticize the fundamental aspects

51:53.380 --> 51:54.940
 of the approach you've taken.

51:54.940 --> 51:55.780
 I would think so.

51:55.780 --> 51:58.740
 So it's exactly like they would say you're attacking,

51:58.740 --> 52:01.100
 you're asking the wrong questions, right?

52:01.100 --> 52:03.700
 And that's extremely painful, especially when you,

52:03.700 --> 52:06.260
 well, yes, painful and helpful,

52:06.260 --> 52:08.500
 but there's disagreement and so on.

52:09.900 --> 52:12.300
 And through that comes out a better product.

52:12.300 --> 52:15.660
 And if you want to still have an ego,

52:15.660 --> 52:17.940
 but you also want to silence it every once in a while,

52:17.940 --> 52:19.860
 so there's a balance.

52:19.860 --> 52:21.460
 In your book, The War of Art,

52:21.460 --> 52:24.700
 you talk about resistance, what the capital R,

52:24.700 --> 52:27.860
 as the invisible force in this universe of ours

52:27.860 --> 52:32.660
 that finds a way to prevent you from starting

52:32.660 --> 52:34.460
 or doing the work.

52:36.660 --> 52:39.140
 Where do you think resistance comes from?

52:39.140 --> 52:40.860
 Why is there a force in our mind

52:40.860 --> 52:44.060
 that's constantly trying to jeopardize our efforts

52:44.060 --> 52:46.580
 with laziness, excuses, and so on?

52:46.580 --> 52:48.300
 That's another great question.

52:48.300 --> 52:53.180
 I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking,

52:53.180 --> 52:55.460
 it's called the yetzer hurrah, right?

52:55.460 --> 52:59.540
 And it's a force that if this up here is your soul

52:59.540 --> 53:03.100
 of Neshama trying to talk to you, us down here,

53:03.100 --> 53:06.020
 the yetzer hurrah is this negative force in the middle.

53:06.020 --> 53:08.540
 So I'm not the only one that ever thought about this.

53:08.540 --> 53:11.540
 But, and I don't know if anybody really knows the answer,

53:11.540 --> 53:13.020
 but here's my answer.

53:13.940 --> 53:18.380
 I think that there are two places

53:18.380 --> 53:21.620
 where we as human beings can see our identity.

53:21.620 --> 53:24.900
 One is the ego, the conscious ego,

53:24.900 --> 53:27.460
 and the other is the greater self.

53:27.460 --> 53:30.220
 And the self in the Jungian sense,

53:30.220 --> 53:33.660
 the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious

53:33.660 --> 53:37.420
 and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground,

53:37.420 --> 53:40.580
 which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever.

53:40.580 --> 53:43.380
 And I think, and the ego is just this little dot

53:43.380 --> 53:45.460
 inside this bigger self.

53:45.460 --> 53:50.460
 And the ego has a completely different view of life

53:52.500 --> 53:53.700
 from the self.

53:53.700 --> 53:56.980
 The ego believes, I'm gonna give you a long answer here.

53:56.980 --> 53:57.940
 No, perfect.

53:57.940 --> 54:01.300
 The ego believes that death is real.

54:01.300 --> 54:05.180
 The ego believes that time and space are real.

54:05.180 --> 54:07.940
 The ego believes that each one of us

54:07.940 --> 54:09.820
 is separate from the other.

54:09.820 --> 54:11.220
 I'm separate from you.

54:11.220 --> 54:14.380
 If I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me,

54:14.380 --> 54:16.220
 it would only hurt you.

54:16.220 --> 54:21.220
 And in the ego's world, the dominant emotion is fear

54:21.500 --> 54:23.460
 because we were all made of flesh.

54:23.460 --> 54:24.300
 We can all die.

54:24.300 --> 54:25.140
 We can all be hurt.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.820
 We can all be ruined.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.420
 So we are protecting ourselves

54:28.420 --> 54:30.940
 and even our desire to create,

54:30.940 --> 54:32.380
 as we were talking about before,

54:32.380 --> 54:33.980
 comes out of that fear of death.

54:35.020 --> 54:37.020
 The self, on the other hand,

54:37.020 --> 54:40.020
 the greater self that butts up against the divine ground

54:40.020 --> 54:42.500
 believes that death is not real,

54:42.500 --> 54:44.980
 that time and space are not real,

54:44.980 --> 54:48.300
 that the gods travel swift as thought.

54:48.300 --> 54:51.380
 And the ego also believes that,

54:51.380 --> 54:53.940
 I mean, the self believes that there's no difference

54:53.940 --> 54:55.500
 between you and me, that we're all one.

54:55.500 --> 55:00.100
 If I hurt you, I hurt myself, karma, right?

55:00.100 --> 55:03.660
 And in the world of the self, of the greater self,

55:03.660 --> 55:06.300
 the dominant emotion is love, not fear.

55:07.180 --> 55:11.340
 Now, so I think that, I'll go farther back here,

55:11.340 --> 55:13.100
 a long way to answer your question.

55:14.220 --> 55:17.540
 When Jesus died on the cross,

55:17.540 --> 55:22.540
 or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives

55:22.940 --> 55:25.020
 at Thermopylae, they were acting

55:25.020 --> 55:27.540
 according to the rules of the self.

55:28.420 --> 55:30.180
 Death is not real.

55:30.180 --> 55:32.380
 No difference between you and me.

55:32.380 --> 55:33.580
 Time and space are not real.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.020
 Predominant emotion is love.

55:36.020 --> 55:38.820
 So, in my opinion,

55:39.860 --> 55:43.260
 we as conscious human vessels

55:44.500 --> 55:46.580
 are in a struggle between these two things,

55:46.580 --> 55:48.180
 the ego and the self.

55:48.180 --> 55:53.180
 To me, resistance is the voice of the ego saying,

55:53.700 --> 55:55.580
 and it's a fearful voice,

55:55.580 --> 56:00.500
 because if, when we identify with the self,

56:00.500 --> 56:03.060
 we move our consciousness over to the self

56:03.060 --> 56:06.660
 as artists or scientists opening ourselves up

56:06.660 --> 56:10.940
 to the cosmic dimension, to the other forces,

56:10.940 --> 56:13.300
 the ego is tremendously threatened by that.

56:13.300 --> 56:18.260
 Because if we're in that space, that head space,

56:18.260 --> 56:20.460
 we don't need the ego anymore.

56:20.460 --> 56:23.940
 So I think resistance is a voice of the ego

56:23.940 --> 56:27.260
 trying to keep control of us.

56:27.260 --> 56:31.540
 In a way, I'll give you a bad example, Trump is the ego.

56:31.540 --> 56:33.860
 That's probably a very good example, right?

56:33.860 --> 56:35.300
 Yeah.

56:35.300 --> 56:38.820
 It's a zero sum world for him,

56:38.820 --> 56:41.340
 and for anybody that's in that.

56:41.340 --> 56:43.940
 And the opposite of that would be somebody

56:43.940 --> 56:46.460
 like Martin Luther King or Gandhi.

56:46.460 --> 56:47.740
 Gandhi, yep.

56:47.740 --> 56:49.380
 And that's, of course, why they all wind up

56:49.380 --> 56:51.260
 getting assassinated.

56:51.260 --> 56:55.260
 Because that voice, that ego, is hanging on to itself

56:55.260 --> 56:59.060
 and feels so threatened by,

57:00.060 --> 57:01.700
 I could talk more about this if you want to.

57:01.700 --> 57:04.140
 No, for sure, that's fascinating.

57:04.140 --> 57:07.940
 It's just, it's interesting why the fear is attached

57:07.940 --> 57:08.940
 to the ego.

57:08.940 --> 57:12.220
 I really like this dichotomy of ego and self

57:12.220 --> 57:14.060
 and that struggle.

57:14.060 --> 57:19.060
 It's just, ego has a, the self obsession of it.

57:20.500 --> 57:25.340
 Why fear is such a predominant thing?

57:25.340 --> 57:29.460
 Why is resistance trying to undermine everything?

57:29.460 --> 57:32.020
 It's fear, it's out of fear.

57:32.020 --> 57:34.740
 Let's think about the whole thing in terms of stories.

57:34.740 --> 57:39.740
 In a story, the villain is always resistance,

57:41.540 --> 57:42.940
 is always the ego.

57:42.940 --> 57:46.940
 The hero is always, of course, always is not everything,

57:46.940 --> 57:47.780
 but you know what I mean?

57:47.780 --> 57:50.580
 Pretty much represents kind of the self.

57:50.580 --> 57:53.660
 If you think about the alien on the spaceship,

57:53.660 --> 57:55.300
 that's like the ultimate kind of villain.

57:55.300 --> 57:57.220
 It keeps changing form, right?

57:57.220 --> 57:58.980
 First it goes on the guy's face,

57:58.980 --> 58:00.820
 then it pops out of his chest,

58:00.820 --> 58:05.340
 but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing

58:05.340 --> 58:07.700
 to destroy, you know?

58:07.700 --> 58:12.580
 And just like the ego, just like resistance.

58:12.580 --> 58:15.540
 And maybe alien is a bad example

58:15.540 --> 58:18.620
 because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of fight

58:18.620 --> 58:20.820
 on the same terms as the alien,

58:20.820 --> 58:23.100
 but maybe a better example might be

58:23.100 --> 58:24.740
 something like Casablanca,

58:24.740 --> 58:28.860
 where in the end, the Humphrey Bogart character

58:28.860 --> 58:32.500
 has to, acting, operating out of the self,

58:32.500 --> 58:37.340
 has to give up his selfish dream

58:37.340 --> 58:39.500
 of going off with Ingrid Bergman,

58:39.500 --> 58:41.460
 Neil Salon, the love of his life,

58:41.460 --> 58:46.260
 and instead, you know, puts her on the plane to Lisbon

58:46.260 --> 58:49.340
 while he goes off to fight the Nazis in the desert.

58:50.420 --> 58:51.260
 I don't know if that's clear,

58:51.260 --> 58:54.820
 but in almost every story,

58:54.820 --> 58:59.420
 the villain is the ego, is resistance, is fear,

58:59.420 --> 59:01.780
 is that zero sum thing.

59:01.780 --> 59:03.340
 And in almost every story,

59:03.340 --> 59:08.260
 the hero is someone that is willing to make a sacrifice

59:09.340 --> 59:10.580
 to help others.

59:11.540 --> 59:13.620
 It's letting go of that fear

59:13.620 --> 59:15.900
 is what leads to productivity and to success.

59:15.900 --> 59:16.740
 Yeah.

59:18.780 --> 59:20.420
 Do you think there's a,

59:20.420 --> 59:25.420
 this is probably the answer is either obvious or impossible,

59:25.900 --> 59:28.740
 but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage

59:28.740 --> 59:31.420
 to resistance?

59:31.420 --> 59:35.780
 Like, what would life look like without resistance?

59:36.740 --> 59:38.420
 That's another great question.

59:38.420 --> 59:43.220
 I think, I also believe that resistance, like death,

59:43.220 --> 59:44.780
 gives meaning to life.

59:44.780 --> 59:48.580
 If we didn't have it, it's gonna be, you know,

59:48.580 --> 59:49.460
 what would we be?

59:49.460 --> 59:51.060
 We'd be in the Garden of Eden,

59:51.060 --> 59:54.980
 picking fruit and just happy and stupid, you know?

59:56.660 --> 59:58.860
 And I do think that that myth of the Garden of Eden

59:58.860 --> 1:00:00.860
 is really about this kind of thing, you know,

1:00:00.860 --> 1:00:04.660
 where Adam and Eve decide to sort of take matters

1:00:04.660 --> 1:00:09.660
 into their own hands and acquire knowledge

1:00:10.180 --> 1:00:12.180
 that until then, God had said,

1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:14.620
 I'm the only one that's got that knowledge.

1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:17.940
 And of course, once they have acquired that knowledge,

1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:21.540
 they're cast out into the world you and I live in now,

1:00:21.540 --> 1:00:23.260
 where they do have to deal with that fear

1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:26.380
 and they do have to deal with all that stuff.

1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:27.820
 The human condition.

1:00:27.820 --> 1:00:31.780
 The human condition and the meaning and the purpose comes

1:00:31.780 --> 1:00:36.700
 from the resistance being there

1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:38.540
 and the struggle to overcome it.

1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:39.940
 To overcome it, right.

1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:42.340
 And also the other aspect of it is that

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:45.220
 it's not real at all.

1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:48.180
 It's not even like it's an actual force.

1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:50.540
 It's all here, right?

1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:53.140
 So the sort of,

1:00:55.420 --> 1:00:58.260
 in a way, it's sort of a surrender to it, you know?

1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:05.180
 You know, or it's just a sort of like turning on the light

1:01:05.180 --> 1:01:06.020
 in a dark thing.

1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:07.180
 It's like, oh, it's gone.

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:11.420
 But not quite because it's never really.

1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:13.260
 Because it comes back again tomorrow morning.

1:01:13.260 --> 1:01:14.100
 Exactly.

1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:17.780
 So you have to keep changing light bulbs every day.

1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:20.820
 So what's been, maybe recently, but in general,

1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:24.180
 maybe in your life, what's been the most relentless

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:26.820
 or one of the more relentless sources of resistance

1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:28.220
 to you personally?

1:01:28.220 --> 1:01:30.620
 I mean, it's always the same.

1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:32.220
 It's about writing for me

1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:38.660
 and evolving within my own body of work, you know?

1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:43.660
 It never goes away, it never gets any less.

1:01:43.860 --> 1:01:45.540
 Do you have particular excuses,

1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:49.900
 particular justifications that come out?

1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:51.540
 No, it's always the same.

1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:53.260
 Well, I would say it's always the same,

1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:56.260
 but it's really not because resistance is so protean,

1:01:56.260 --> 1:01:58.340
 you know, it keeps changing form.

1:01:58.340 --> 1:02:02.460
 And as you move to hopefully a higher level,

1:02:02.460 --> 1:02:04.460
 resistance gets a little more nuanced

1:02:04.460 --> 1:02:07.220
 and a little more subtle trying to fake you out.

1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:11.980
 But I think you learn that it's always there

1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:14.380
 and you're always gonna have to face it, so.

1:02:14.380 --> 1:02:18.780
 I mean, your battle is sitting down

1:02:18.780 --> 1:02:22.940
 and writing to some number of words to a blank page.

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:28.060
 Do you have a process there with this battle?

1:02:28.060 --> 1:02:31.500
 Do you have a number of hours that you put in?

1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:32.340
 Do you sit down?

1:02:32.340 --> 1:02:34.940
 Yeah, I'm definitely a believer

1:02:34.940 --> 1:02:37.460
 that even though this battle is fought

1:02:37.460 --> 1:02:40.060
 on the highest sort of spiritual level,

1:02:40.060 --> 1:02:43.060
 that the way you fight it is on the most mundane,

1:02:44.060 --> 1:02:46.860
 I'm sure it's like martial arts, must be the same way.

1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:49.980
 I mean, I go to the gym first thing in the morning

1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:53.180
 and I sort of am rehearsing myself.

1:02:54.900 --> 1:02:57.180
 The gym is called resistance training, right?

1:02:57.180 --> 1:02:59.180
 You're working against resistance, right?

1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:01.620
 And I don't wanna go, I don't wanna get out of bed,

1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:06.580
 I hate that, but I'm sort of fortifying myself

1:03:06.580 --> 1:03:09.700
 to be ready for the day.

1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:13.740
 And like I said, over Knockwood, over years,

1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:17.100
 I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset

1:03:17.100 --> 1:03:20.060
 and it's not as hard for me as it used to be.

1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:22.180
 The real resistance, I think, for me,

1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:23.580
 and I think this is true for anybody,

1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:26.860
 is the question of sort of what's the next idea?

1:03:27.820 --> 1:03:29.100
 What's the next book?

1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:31.500
 What's the next project that you're gonna work on?

1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:35.820
 And when I ask that question, I'm asking it of the muse.

1:03:35.820 --> 1:03:38.020
 I'm kind of saying, what do you want me,

1:03:38.020 --> 1:03:40.420
 or I'm asking it of my unconscious.

1:03:40.420 --> 1:03:43.260
 If we're looking at Bruce Springsteen's albums,

1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:45.060
 it's kind of, well, what's the next album?

1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:46.420
 Now he's on Broadway.

1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:47.980
 That was a great idea, right?

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.900
 Where'd that come from, you know?

1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:55.740
 But, and then for him, what's after that, you know?

1:03:55.740 --> 1:04:00.740
 Because that body of work is already alive.

1:04:03.980 --> 1:04:07.020
 It already exists inside us,

1:04:07.020 --> 1:04:09.460
 kind of like a woman's biological clock,

1:04:10.340 --> 1:04:12.340
 and we have to serve it.

1:04:12.340 --> 1:04:16.540
 And we have to, otherwise it'll give us cancer, you know?

1:04:17.740 --> 1:04:19.460
 I don't mean to say that if anybody has cancer

1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:21.180
 that they're not, you know what I mean?

1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:24.060
 It'll take its revenge on us.

1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:26.300
 So the next resistance to me is sort of,

1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.100
 or a big aspect of it is, what's next?

1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:31.780
 You know, when I finish the book I'm working on now,

1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:33.460
 I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next.

1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:35.900
 And I see at the same time you have a kind of,

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:42.660
 you have a sense that there's a Bruce Springsteen

1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:45.980
 single line of albums.

1:04:45.980 --> 1:04:49.420
 So like, it's already known somewhere in the universe

1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:51.900
 what you're going to do next, is the sense you have.

1:04:51.900 --> 1:04:53.460
 In a sense, yes.

1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:55.940
 I don't know if it's predetermined, you know?

1:04:55.940 --> 1:04:58.420
 But there's something like that.

1:05:00.220 --> 1:05:03.380
 Yeah, I'd like to believe that there's,

1:05:03.380 --> 1:05:06.460
 well, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess.

1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:11.020
 Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse,

1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:13.580
 it's one thing for sure.

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:15.540
 It was always going to be that one thing.

1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:19.260
 But really, in reality, it's a distribution.

1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:20.780
 It could be any number of things.

1:05:20.780 --> 1:05:21.620
 Yeah, I think so.

1:05:21.620 --> 1:05:22.820
 There's alternate realities.

1:05:22.820 --> 1:05:24.100
 Alternate realities, yeah.

1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:25.460
 But they're not that far apart.

1:05:25.460 --> 1:05:28.260
 I mean, Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write

1:05:28.260 --> 1:05:30.620
 a Joni Mitchell song, you know?

1:05:30.620 --> 1:05:31.460
 No matter how hard he tries.

1:05:31.460 --> 1:05:32.420
 But he still went on Broadway.

1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:33.860
 I mean, he still did that,

1:05:33.860 --> 1:05:36.320
 which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:39.940
 So I think you're being, in retrospect,

1:05:39.940 --> 1:05:40.780
 it all makes sense. I think it is

1:05:40.780 --> 1:05:41.860
 a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.

1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:43.740
 It's a next sort of evolution for him.

1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:46.860
 Why not take his music to there, you know?

1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:50.340
 In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, I think.

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:51.180
 Yeah.

1:05:51.180 --> 1:05:53.080
 If you pull it off, especially.

1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:57.620
 Do you visualize yourself completing the work?

1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:01.140
 Like, Olympic athletes visualize getting the gold medal.

1:06:02.780 --> 1:06:06.080
 Do you, you know, they go through,

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:08.260
 I mean, that's actually a really,

1:06:08.260 --> 1:06:09.940
 you can learn something from athletes on that,

1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:12.340
 is years out,

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:15.260
 certainly two, three years out,

1:06:15.260 --> 1:06:16.620
 some people do much longer,

1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:19.500
 every day, you visualize how the day

1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:24.060
 of the championship will go down to,

1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:25.980
 I mean, everything, down to how will it feel

1:06:25.980 --> 1:06:27.900
 to stand on the podium and so on.

1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:29.860
 Do you do anything like that

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.260
 in how you approach writing?

1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:32.260
 No.

1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:33.580
 Because it's. It's always in the moment.

1:06:33.580 --> 1:06:35.700
 Because, yeah, it is in the moment, I think.

1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:36.860
 Because it's such a mystery.

1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:37.700
 You just don't know.

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:39.260
 I think it's different from sports.

1:06:39.260 --> 1:06:40.700
 Right.

1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:41.700
 Because you don't know the destiny.

1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:43.700
 There's no gold medal at the end.

1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:44.540
 No.

1:06:44.540 --> 1:06:48.540
 In fact, I would like to think that

1:06:48.540 --> 1:06:50.300
 as soon as you finish one,

1:06:51.220 --> 1:06:53.580
 the next day you're on the other.

1:06:53.580 --> 1:06:56.460
 And in fact, hopefully you've already started the other.

1:06:56.460 --> 1:07:00.900
 You're already, you know, 100 pages into the other

1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:03.220
 when you finish the first one.

1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:04.860
 But it is a, it is a,

1:07:08.620 --> 1:07:10.060
 it's a journey, it's a process.

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:11.540
 I don't think it is a,

1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:14.340
 in fact, I think it's very dangerous to think that way.

1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:19.340
 To think, oh, this, I'm gonna win the Oscar, you know?

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:21.900
 It's interesting.

1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:24.780
 For the creative process, it might be dangerous.

1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:29.060
 It's a, maybe you can, like, why is that dangerous?

1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:30.900
 Because I kind of know where you're coming from.

1:07:30.900 --> 1:07:32.220
 Because it's the ego.

1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:33.060
 It's the ego.

1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:34.980
 Because you're giving yourself over to the ego.

1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:38.740
 You know, I keep saying this myself.

1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:41.580
 My job, I'm a servant of the muse.

1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:44.820
 I'm there to do what she tells me to do.

1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:48.220
 And if I suddenly think, oh, I'm really,

1:07:48.220 --> 1:07:50.100
 I just wanna, you know, whatever,

1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:51.740
 the muse doesn't like that.

1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:56.660
 And, you know, and she's on another dimension from me.

1:07:58.220 --> 1:08:01.260
 I'm trying to square that, because I agree.

1:08:01.260 --> 1:08:03.060
 I'm trying to square that with the,

1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:07.900
 I think there's a meditation to visualizing success

1:08:07.900 --> 1:08:12.820
 in the athletic realm, to where it focuses,

1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:15.500
 it removes everything else away,

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:18.180
 to where you focus on this particular battle.

1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:23.180
 I mean, I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways.

1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:28.620
 And in sports, the ego serves a more important role,

1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:31.580
 I think, than it does in writing.

1:08:31.580 --> 1:08:33.860
 And the ego, there's something.

1:08:33.860 --> 1:08:35.940
 Well, let me, when you say that,

1:08:35.940 --> 1:08:39.100
 I know what you mean, Lex, and I do think there is

1:08:39.100 --> 1:08:43.180
 a sort of a, you know, it's interesting to watch interviews

1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:47.980
 with Steph Curry, who's such, obviously such a nice guy,

1:08:49.780 --> 1:08:54.500
 but he's got such tremendous self confidence,

1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:58.460
 you know, that it, but it doesn't border on ego so much

1:08:58.460 --> 1:09:01.060
 because he's worked so hard for it, you know?

1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:04.420
 But he knows, so he has visualized.

1:09:04.420 --> 1:09:08.100
 He has visualized maybe not so much winning, you know,

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:11.740
 as just him being the best he can be,

1:09:11.740 --> 1:09:15.500
 him being in the flow, you know,

1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:18.420
 doing his thing that he knows he can do.

1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:21.260
 And I do think in the creative world,

1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:23.140
 yeah, there is a sort of a thing like that,

1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:27.180
 where you, where, and, you know,

1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:29.700
 a choreographer or a filmmaker or whatever

1:09:29.700 --> 1:09:34.700
 might be, do an internal thing where they're saying,

1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:36.980
 I can make an Oscar winning movie.

1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:38.700
 I can direct this movie.

1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:40.700
 You know, I'm banishing these thoughts

1:09:40.700 --> 1:09:42.020
 that I'm not good enough.

1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:42.860
 I can do that.

1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:44.220
 I can edit it.

1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:45.420
 I can score it.

1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:47.500
 I can, you know, bump it, bump it, bump.

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.380
 But, and I don't think that's really ego.

1:09:49.380 --> 1:09:53.580
 I think that's part of the process in a good way,

1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:55.180
 like an athlete does that.

1:09:55.180 --> 1:09:58.140
 So extreme confidence is what some of the best athletes

1:09:58.140 --> 1:10:02.020
 come with, and you think it's possible to,

1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:04.740
 as a writer, to have extreme confidence in yourself?

1:10:04.740 --> 1:10:07.500
 I do think so, you know, that I'm sure

1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:11.420
 when John Lennon sat down to write a song,

1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:14.260
 he felt like, shit, I can do this, you know?

1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:16.020
 I'm not so sure.

1:10:16.020 --> 1:10:19.660
 I think, because the great artists I've seen,

1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:23.340
 and you're haunted by self doubt.

1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.020
 It's that resist, I mean, the confidence.

1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:29.100
 Yes, but I mean, I guess, but even beyond the self,

1:10:29.100 --> 1:10:30.940
 within the self, above the self doubt.

1:10:30.940 --> 1:10:33.900
 Oh, it's the bigger picture of the self belief, you know?

1:10:33.900 --> 1:10:35.100
 Yeah, I'm freaking out.

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.860
 Yeah, I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to do it.

1:10:36.860 --> 1:10:38.460
 But, you know, I know I can do this.

1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:39.500
 Yeah, and when you look at,

1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:41.860
 when you take a bigger picture of it.

1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:46.860
 So the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely?

1:10:48.780 --> 1:10:53.540
 No, because you're with your characters.

1:10:53.540 --> 1:10:55.700
 You are.

1:10:55.700 --> 1:10:58.300
 So you really put yourself in the world.

1:10:58.300 --> 1:11:02.420
 Absolutely, you know, I've written about this before

1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:04.740
 that I used to, my desk used to face a wall

1:11:04.740 --> 1:11:06.460
 instead of seeing, and people would say,

1:11:06.460 --> 1:11:08.340
 well, don't you wanna look out the window?

1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:11.900
 But I'm in here, I mean, I'm seeing, you know,

1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:14.700
 the Spartans, I'm seeing, you know, whatever.

1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:18.500
 And the characters that are on the page,

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:22.300
 or that you create, are not accidents, you know?

1:11:22.300 --> 1:11:24.820
 They're coming out of some issue,

1:11:24.820 --> 1:11:27.300
 some deep issue that you have.

1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:28.380
 Whether you realize it or not,

1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:30.260
 you might not realize it till 20 years later,

1:11:30.260 --> 1:11:31.900
 or somebody explains it to you.

1:11:31.900 --> 1:11:35.180
 So your characters are kind of fascinating to you.

1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.340
 And their dilemmas are fascinating to you.

1:11:38.340 --> 1:11:42.820
 And you're also trying to come to grips with them,

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:46.300
 you know, you sort of see them through a glass darkly,

1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:49.100
 you know, and you really wanna see them more clearly.

1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:52.260
 So yeah, no, it's not lonely at all.

1:11:52.260 --> 1:11:55.180
 In fact, I'm more lonely sometimes later,

1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:56.620
 going out to dinner with some people

1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:58.180
 and actually talking to people.

1:11:59.300 --> 1:12:02.540
 Do you miss the characters after it's over?

1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:06.340
 Let's say I have affection for them,

1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:09.220
 kind of like children that have gone off to college

1:12:09.220 --> 1:12:12.500
 and now are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving.

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:17.500
 Definitely, I have affection for them, even the bad guys.

1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:22.500
 Maybe especially the bad guys.

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:23.700
 Especially the bad guys.

1:12:25.540 --> 1:12:29.060
 You've said that writers, even successful writers,

1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:32.300
 are often not tough minded enough.

1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:34.540
 I've read that in the post,

1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:35.820
 that you have to be a professional

1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:38.500
 in the way you handle your emotions.

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:41.740
 You have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer.

1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:46.740
 So what do you think makes a warrior?

1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:51.580
 Is a warrior born or trained in the realm,

1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:53.780
 in the bigger realm, in the realm of writing,

1:12:53.780 --> 1:12:55.100
 in the creative process?

1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:57.580
 I think they're born to some extent.

1:12:57.580 --> 1:12:59.820
 You have the gift, like you might have the gift

1:12:59.820 --> 1:13:02.820
 as a martial artist to do whatever martial artists do,

1:13:02.820 --> 1:13:05.140
 but the training is the big thing.

1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:09.100
 90% training, 10%, 10% genetics.

1:13:09.100 --> 1:13:13.740
 And, you know, I use another analogy other than warrior

1:13:13.740 --> 1:13:16.580
 as far as writer, and that's like to be a mother.

1:13:16.580 --> 1:13:19.220
 If you think about, if you're a writer

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.420
 or any creative person, you're giving birth to something,

1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:23.860
 right, you're carrying a new life inside you.

1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:26.900
 And in terms of bravery,

1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:30.460
 if your child, your two year old child

1:13:30.460 --> 1:13:33.620
 is underneath a car that's coming down the street,

1:13:33.620 --> 1:13:35.780
 the mother's gonna like stop a Buick,

1:13:35.780 --> 1:13:37.900
 you know, with her bare hands.

1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:41.220
 So that's another way to think about

1:13:41.220 --> 1:13:43.380
 how a writer has to think about,

1:13:43.380 --> 1:13:45.620
 or any creative person has to think about,

1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:47.260
 I think, what they're doing,

1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:50.220
 what this child, this new creation

1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:51.580
 that they're bringing forth.

1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:57.100
 Yeah, so the hard work that's underlying that.

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:59.780
 I've just, a couple weeks ago, talked to,

1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:01.860
 just happened to be in the same room,

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:03.940
 both gave talks, Arianna Huffington.

1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:08.180
 I did this conversation with her.

1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:11.100
 I didn't know much about her before then,

1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:14.420
 but she has recently been, she wrote a couple books

1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:16.140
 and been promoting a lifestyle

1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:20.180
 where she basically, she created the Huffington Post,

1:14:20.180 --> 1:14:23.140
 and she gave herself like, I don't know,

1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:26.340
 20 hours a day just obsessed with her work.

1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:29.260
 And then she fainted, passed out,

1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:31.620
 and kind of, there was some health issues.

1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:36.140
 And so she wrote this book saying that, you know, sleep,

1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:38.860
 basically you wanna establish a lifestyle

1:14:38.860 --> 1:14:41.320
 that doesn't sacrifice health,

1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:43.420
 that's productive but doesn't sacrifice health.

1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:44.620
 She thinks that you can have both,

1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:46.380
 productivity and health.

1:14:46.380 --> 1:14:49.780
 Criticizing Elon Musk, who I've also spoken with,

1:14:49.780 --> 1:14:51.820
 for working too hard,

1:14:51.820 --> 1:14:56.820
 and thereby sacrificing, you know,

1:14:56.820 --> 1:14:59.380
 being less effective than he could be.

1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:04.380
 So I'm trying to get this balance between health

1:15:04.420 --> 1:15:06.780
 and obsessively working at something

1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:09.060
 and really working hard.

1:15:09.060 --> 1:15:12.100
 So what Arianna is talking about makes sense to me,

1:15:12.100 --> 1:15:13.540
 but I'm a little bit torn.

1:15:13.540 --> 1:15:17.100
 To me, passion and reason do not overlap much

1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:19.080
 or at all sometimes.

1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:20.340
 Maybe I'm being too Russian,

1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:25.340
 but I feel madness and obsession does not care for health

1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:28.580
 or sleep or diet or any of that.

1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:32.220
 And hard work is hard work,

1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:34.180
 and everything else can go to hell.

1:15:34.180 --> 1:15:37.420
 So if you're really focused on whether it's writing a book,

1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:39.820
 it should, everything should just go to hell.

1:15:40.860 --> 1:15:43.120
 Where do you stand on this balance?

1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.280
 How important is health for productivity?

1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:49.300
 How important is it to sort of get sleep and so on?

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.320
 I'm on the health side.

1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.940
 I mean, there was a period of my life

1:15:54.940 --> 1:15:59.940
 when I was just, I had no obligations

1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:02.260
 and I was just living in a little house

1:16:02.260 --> 1:16:05.300
 and just working nonstop, you know?

1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:07.220
 But even then I would get up in the morning

1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:10.940
 and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast every day,

1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:13.760
 and I would do my, you know, exercise, whatever it was.

1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:16.800
 But although I was still doing like 18 hours a day,

1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.380
 but I'm definitely, I kind of think of it

1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:22.140
 sort of like an athlete does.

1:16:22.140 --> 1:16:27.140
 I'm sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed

1:16:27.620 --> 1:16:29.940
 to winning championships and stuff like that.

1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:31.640
 But he has his family, he sees his family,

1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:33.700
 you know, the family is always there.

1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:38.700
 He, I'm sure he eats, you know, perfect, great stuff,

1:16:38.900 --> 1:16:43.700
 gets his sleep, you know, gets the training,

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:45.300
 you know, the whatever a trainer does to him

1:16:45.300 --> 1:16:47.320
 for his knees and his ankles and whatever.

1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:49.820
 So I, or Kobe Bryant or anybody

1:16:49.820 --> 1:16:52.580
 that's operating at a high level.

1:16:52.580 --> 1:16:55.020
 So I do think I'm from that kind of the health school.

1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:57.500
 The good thing about being a writer

1:16:57.500 --> 1:17:00.820
 is you can't work very many hours a day.

1:17:00.820 --> 1:17:03.820
 You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work.

1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:05.580
 I've never been able to work more than that.

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:06.820
 I don't know how people do it.

1:17:06.820 --> 1:17:11.220
 I've heard of people do 10, 12, I don't know how they do it.

1:17:11.220 --> 1:17:14.780
 So that gives you a lot of other time to do it.

1:17:14.780 --> 1:17:16.180
 Optimize your health.

1:17:16.180 --> 1:17:17.020
 Yeah, to optimize your health.

1:17:17.020 --> 1:17:19.020
 Because you need to, you're in training, you know?

1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:22.260
 You're really, you're burning up a lot of B vitamins

1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:24.500
 when you're working here, aren't you?

1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:25.500
 Yeah, but.

1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:28.860
 Maybe it's a Russian thing with you, Lex.

1:17:28.860 --> 1:17:30.460
 Well, it's not even a Russian thing.

1:17:30.460 --> 1:17:32.260
 It also may be youth, you know?

1:17:32.260 --> 1:17:35.380
 At 35, you can be crazy.

1:17:35.380 --> 1:17:38.060
 You know, that's the thing, they keep telling me,

1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:43.060
 but I'm pretty sure I'll be added still at a later time too.

1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:47.100
 I think it has to do with the career choice too.

1:17:47.100 --> 1:17:51.580
 I think writing is almost, from everything I've heard,

1:17:51.580 --> 1:17:52.700
 it's almost impossible to do it

1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:55.860
 more than a few hours really well.

1:17:56.860 --> 1:17:58.820
 When you start to get into certain disciplines,

1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:02.660
 like with Elon Musk and me, engineering disciplines,

1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:07.660
 that really there's a lot more non muse time needed.

1:18:09.300 --> 1:18:10.140
 Right, right, right.

1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:17.140
 So the crazy hours that you often are talking about

1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:20.660
 have to be done, and it doesn't.

1:18:20.660 --> 1:18:22.260
 I think that's true.

1:18:22.260 --> 1:18:26.060
 Yeah, so there's still the two, three hours of muse time

1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:27.820
 needed for truly genius ideas,

1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:32.820
 but it's something I certainly struggle with.

1:18:34.620 --> 1:18:39.500
 But yeah, I hear you loud and clear on the health.

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:44.180
 So what does a perfect day look like for you

1:18:44.180 --> 1:18:46.740
 if we're talking about writing?

1:18:46.740 --> 1:18:49.180
 An hour by hour schedule of a perfect day.

1:18:51.340 --> 1:18:54.340
 I get up early, I go to the gym,

1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:57.380
 I have breakfast with some friends of mine.

1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:58.660
 What's early by the way?

1:18:58.660 --> 1:19:00.180
 Let's, like how early?

1:19:00.180 --> 1:19:01.020
 3.15.

1:19:02.020 --> 1:19:02.860
 A.M.

1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:03.820
 A.M.

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.300
 So we're talking really early.

1:19:05.300 --> 1:19:06.180
 Really early.

1:19:06.180 --> 1:19:08.980
 Now I'm crazy early, it's ridiculously early.

1:19:08.980 --> 1:19:10.900
 But, and I haven't done that always,

1:19:10.900 --> 1:19:13.700
 but that's kind of what I'm on now.

1:19:15.740 --> 1:19:19.140
 So I'm in bed, like when I'm with my nephews

1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:21.260
 that are like four years old and three years old,

1:19:21.260 --> 1:19:22.660
 I'm in bed before them.

1:19:22.660 --> 1:19:25.020
 Okay, you got a beat.

1:19:25.020 --> 1:19:28.340
 You wake up, sorry, you said exercise first.

1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:29.700
 Yeah.

1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:30.780
 And what does that look like?

1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:32.100
 What's exercise for you?

1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:32.940
 You go out to the gym?

1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:33.780
 I go to the gym.

1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:37.380
 I have a trainer, I have a couple of guys

1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:40.980
 that I work out with, and I'll, you know,

1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:43.180
 it's maybe an hour, maybe a little more.

1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:45.660
 I'll do a little warmup before stretching afterwards,

1:19:45.660 --> 1:19:47.380
 take a shower, go have breakfast.

1:19:49.260 --> 1:19:51.620
 But it's an intense kind of a thing

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:55.860
 that I definitely don't wanna do that's hard, you know?

1:19:55.860 --> 1:19:57.980
 So you feel like you've accomplished something, first thing.

1:19:57.980 --> 1:19:58.980
 Yeah.

1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:00.460
 That's a big accomplishment of the day.

1:20:00.460 --> 1:20:02.540
 At the same time, it's not like so hard

1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:04.940
 that I'm completely exhausted, you know?

1:20:04.940 --> 1:20:09.940
 And then I'll come home and handle whatever correspondence

1:20:10.100 --> 1:20:11.580
 and stuff has to be done, and then I work

1:20:11.580 --> 1:20:15.580
 for maybe three hours, and then I just sort of crash.

1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:18.900
 The office is closed, I turn the switch,

1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:21.340
 I don't think about anything.

1:20:21.340 --> 1:20:23.420
 I don't think about the work at all.

1:20:23.420 --> 1:20:25.660
 Do you listen to, oh, you mean afterwards?

1:20:25.660 --> 1:20:27.620
 After work, once the office is closed.

1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:31.020
 But during, so this was like 12 to three kind of thing?

1:20:31.020 --> 1:20:31.860
 Something like that, yeah.

1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:33.540
 Something like that, okay.

1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:34.660
 You listen to music?

1:20:34.660 --> 1:20:35.500
 No.

1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:36.340
 Do you have anything?

1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.500
 But that's just me, I mean, I don't think, you know,

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:40.500
 but somebody could do it a million different ways.

1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:42.380
 It's fascinating, you know, the,

1:20:43.580 --> 1:20:47.820
 I mean, you've also, of most, of many writers,

1:20:47.820 --> 1:20:51.900
 you've really, but like I've read Stephen Kington writing,

1:20:51.900 --> 1:20:55.180
 you've optimized this conversation

1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:56.420
 with the muse you're having.

1:20:56.420 --> 1:20:59.700
 Not optimized, but you've at least thought about it.

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:02.660
 So what's, can you say a little bit more

1:21:02.660 --> 1:21:05.900
 about the trivialities of that process,

1:21:05.900 --> 1:21:10.700
 of the, like you said, facing the wall?

1:21:10.700 --> 1:21:13.340
 What's, do you have little rituals?

1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:15.300
 You mean like the granular aspect of it?

1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:17.020
 The granular aspects, yeah.

1:21:19.540 --> 1:21:20.380
 Is there?

1:21:20.380 --> 1:21:21.740
 I do have little rituals, I do have all kinds of,

1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:22.940
 which I'm not even gonna tell you about.

1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:23.780
 Sure.

1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:27.660
 But the one thing,

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:30.740
 and I don't wanna like talk about this too much

1:21:30.740 --> 1:21:32.460
 because it sort of jinxes things, I think,

1:21:32.460 --> 1:21:37.140
 but the one thing I do try to do is when I sit down,

1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:41.060
 I immediately get into it, first, second.

1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.660
 I don't sit and fuck around with anything.

1:21:43.660 --> 1:21:47.300
 I immediately try to get into it as quickly as I can.

1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:50.180
 The other thing is that writing a book

1:21:50.180 --> 1:21:51.420
 or screenplay or anything like that

1:21:51.420 --> 1:21:54.060
 is a process of multiple drafts.

1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:56.060
 And it's the first draft

1:21:56.060 --> 1:21:58.780
 that's where you're most with the muse,

1:21:58.780 --> 1:22:00.620
 where you're going through the blank page.

1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:02.820
 Like right now I'm on, I don't know what,

1:22:02.820 --> 1:22:04.260
 the fifth or sixth, seventh draft

1:22:04.260 --> 1:22:05.860
 of the thing I'm working on.

1:22:05.860 --> 1:22:09.260
 So I've got pages already written

1:22:09.260 --> 1:22:12.140
 and I'm kind of reading them afresh

1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:14.820
 as I go through the story.

1:22:14.820 --> 1:22:17.460
 So it's not quite where I am now.

1:22:17.460 --> 1:22:22.460
 It's not quite a deep muse scenario, partly it is,

1:22:22.540 --> 1:22:25.900
 but it's also sort of bouncing back and forth

1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.100
 between the different,

1:22:27.100 --> 1:22:28.500
 between the right brain and the left brain.

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:29.500
 I'm kind of looking at it

1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.620
 and trying to evaluate it.

1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:33.060
 And then I'm going into it

1:22:33.060 --> 1:22:35.140
 and try to change it a little bit.

1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:37.100
 And when, do you know,

1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:38.580
 sit down and get right into it,

1:22:38.580 --> 1:22:40.860
 do you know the night before

1:22:40.860 --> 1:22:43.540
 of what that starting point is?

1:22:43.540 --> 1:22:46.220
 I always try to stop.

1:22:46.220 --> 1:22:47.060
 And I learned this,

1:22:47.060 --> 1:22:48.260
 I think Hemingway wrote about this

1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:49.940
 or John Steinbeck or one of the,

1:22:49.940 --> 1:22:51.180
 or maybe both of them,

1:22:51.180 --> 1:22:54.780
 to always stop when you kind of know what's coming next.

1:22:54.780 --> 1:22:58.220
 So you're not at a facing a chasm, you know?

1:22:58.220 --> 1:22:59.460
 Yeah.

1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:02.260
 Okay, so and afterwards when you're done,

1:23:02.260 --> 1:23:03.340
 the office is closed.

1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:04.180
 The office is closed,

1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:05.700
 I let the muse take care of it, you know?

1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:07.380
 And I don't want to,

1:23:07.380 --> 1:23:09.740
 and I think it's a very unhealthy thing

1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:13.380
 to worry about it or think about any creative process.

1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:18.700
 You don't, like on a long walk later, think about?

1:23:18.700 --> 1:23:22.220
 Yeah, then I will sort of keep my mind open to it,

1:23:22.220 --> 1:23:24.340
 but I won't be like obsessing about it.

1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:25.180
 Okay.

1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:26.660
 Because actually on walks,

1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:28.380
 sometimes things will pop in your head, you know,

1:23:28.380 --> 1:23:30.420
 and you'll go, oh, I should change that.

1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:33.560
 But that's not your ego doing it,

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.280
 that's the deeper level.

1:23:36.300 --> 1:23:38.620
 Okay, so how does the day end?

1:23:38.620 --> 1:23:39.820
 So go. In terms of writing?

1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:41.540
 So yeah, the writing, well no,

1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:45.220
 the writing, the office door closes

1:23:45.220 --> 1:23:48.520
 and then the rest of the day just do whatever the hell.

1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:51.020
 Maybe go out to dinner,

1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:52.420
 my girlfriend is not here now,

1:23:52.420 --> 1:23:53.540
 she's in New York working,

1:23:53.540 --> 1:23:56.100
 we'll make dinner or whatever.

1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.380
 Go out to dinner, something like that,

1:23:57.380 --> 1:24:01.260
 and maybe I'll read something, nothing heavy.

1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:04.660
 And I go to bed pretty early,

1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:08.260
 and the gym is a big thing for me.

1:24:08.260 --> 1:24:10.660
 I'll already, sort of probably like with you

1:24:10.660 --> 1:24:12.020
 with martial arts, the night before,

1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:15.460
 I'll be visualizing what I have to do the next day

1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:20.020
 and getting myself psyched up for that.

1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:22.140
 And then I'll just conk out like a light

1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:24.340
 and wake up at the crack of dawn.

1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:28.140
 Okay, so looking out into the future,

1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:30.940
 this year, next few years,

1:24:30.940 --> 1:24:33.340
 what do you think the muse has in store for you?

1:24:34.900 --> 1:24:36.500
 I don't think you can ever know.

1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:40.060
 It's probably something along the same,

1:24:40.060 --> 1:24:43.740
 I really believe there's that exercise

1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:45.780
 where they say to you,

1:24:45.780 --> 1:24:48.180
 visualize yourself five years in the future

1:24:48.180 --> 1:24:50.820
 and write a letter from that person to yourself.

1:24:50.820 --> 1:24:52.300
 I don't believe in that at all

1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:54.460
 because I don't think you can,

1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:57.220
 there's a line out of Africa

1:24:57.220 --> 1:24:59.340
 that God made the world round

1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:01.900
 so that we couldn't see too far ahead.

1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:07.800
 You just don't know as a writer or as a person,

1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:12.860
 I never knew, my first book was A Legend of Bag of Ants.

1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.740
 I hadn't, before that happened,

1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:17.900
 I had no clue that I was gonna be writing anything like that

1:25:17.900 --> 1:25:20.900
 on that subject, anything at all, no clue,

1:25:20.900 --> 1:25:22.260
 until it just sort of came.

1:25:22.260 --> 1:25:24.460
 And then when that was done,

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:25.780
 people said, well, you gotta write another one.

1:25:25.780 --> 1:25:27.200
 I had no idea what it was,

1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:30.160
 which was gonna be Gates of Fire, no clue.

1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.660
 So if somebody had sat me down at the start of that

1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:36.020
 and asked the question,

1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:39.660
 I would have been crazy to have said it.

1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:44.080
 So I just hope as the future unfolds,

1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:45.940
 that I'm open to it.

1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:51.300
 Well, I think I speak for a lot of people

1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:54.780
 in saying that we look forward to what that future looks like.

1:25:54.780 --> 1:25:57.380
 Stephen, thank you so much for talking today, it was fun.

1:25:57.380 --> 1:25:59.200
 You got the best job in the world going around

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.940
 talking to people that you wanna talk to

1:26:01.940 --> 1:26:04.220
 and that they will talk to you.

1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:05.300
 So thank you for doing it.

1:26:05.300 --> 1:26:07.460
 Hey, thank you for the great questions you made me think.

1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:08.820
 I've certainly a bunch of questions

1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:10.980
 I've never ever answered before.

1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:11.820
 Awesome, thank you so much.

1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:12.780
 So thanks a lot, great.

1:26:12.780 --> 1:26:14.180
 Thank you.

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:26:54.100 --> 1:26:56.060
 from Stephen Pressfield.

1:26:56.060 --> 1:26:58.180
 Are you paralyzed by fear?

1:26:58.180 --> 1:26:59.660
 That's a good sign.

1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:00.900
 Fear is good.

1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:03.980
 Like self doubt, fear is an indicator.

1:27:03.980 --> 1:27:06.900
 Fear tells us what we have to do.

1:27:06.900 --> 1:27:08.860
 Remember one rule of thumb,

1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:12.300
 the more scared we are of a work or a calling,

1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:15.340
 the more sure we can be that we have to do it.

1:27:15.340 --> 1:27:19.900
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
