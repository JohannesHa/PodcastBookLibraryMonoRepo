00:00.000 --> 00:04.420
 The following is a conversation with Nick Carter, who is a partner at Castle

00:04.420 --> 00:09.940
 Island Ventures, cofounder of CoinMetrics.io, and previously a crypto

00:09.940 --> 00:12.780
 asset research analyst at Fidelity Investments.

00:13.220 --> 00:18.820
 He's a prominent writer, speaker, and podcaster on topics around decentralized

00:18.820 --> 00:21.300
 finance and especially Bitcoin.

00:22.100 --> 00:26.500
 Quick mention of our sponsors, The Information, Athletic Greens,

00:26.500 --> 00:31.000
 Four Sigmatic, and Blinkist. Check them out in the description to support this

00:31.000 --> 00:35.800
 podcast. This conversation with Nick Carter is part of a series of episodes on

00:35.800 --> 00:40.400
 cryptocurrency that is a small journey of exploration I'm on because I find

00:40.400 --> 00:45.200
 decentralized finance and especially Bitcoin fascinating, technically and

00:45.200 --> 00:50.200
 philosophically, especially because it may be the very mechanism that achieves a

00:50.200 --> 00:55.200
 global decentralization of power, giving more sovereignty to the individual and

00:55.200 --> 01:00.400
 making our systems more resilient to corruption, manipulation, and in general

01:00.600 --> 01:02.600
 to the darker side of human nature.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.600
 Please let me also address something for a few minutes that happened recently

01:08.000 --> 01:09.400
 that's been weighing heavy on me.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.600
 If you find me annoying to listen to, please skip to the actual conversation

01:13.600 --> 01:14.100
 with Nick.

01:14.700 --> 01:19.600
 I had a recent podcast episode with Anthony Pompliano where we spoke about

01:19.600 --> 01:23.300
 Bitcoin and life in general for three hours.

01:23.300 --> 01:28.800
 I was curious, inspired, positive, or at least I tried to be as I usually do.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.400
 Someone clipped out, out of context, a short segment of me mumbling something

01:34.600 --> 01:39.700
 about having a PhD and I started getting mocked online because that made it

01:39.700 --> 01:44.800
 convenient for people to mock me for being yet another quote unquote expert

01:45.000 --> 01:47.800
 who learns about Bitcoin and thinks he knows everything.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.600
 I almost never mentioned that I have a PhD, except to make fun of myself as

01:52.600 --> 01:57.100
 I was doing, or at least trying to do in the full context of the conversation.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.900
 I brought up grad school as a random example of one of the many journeys

02:01.900 --> 02:07.900
 I've taken that was hard, but where the destination was in itself, not very useful.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.200
 I was saying I enjoy exploring with a curious mind and I'm willing to be

02:12.200 --> 02:17.100
 patient, to learn, to listen, to humble myself with knowledge, and to

02:17.100 --> 02:20.000
 help with knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.500
 Grad school was an example of that.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.700
 The PhD means nothing, at least to me.

02:26.300 --> 02:30.300
 I never call myself an expert or at least try not to because that would

02:30.300 --> 02:33.800
 be dumb because I know how little I know.

02:34.400 --> 02:40.000
 I'm not a influencer or a thought leader or whatever else silly self

02:40.000 --> 02:42.800
 aggrandizing label people put on their LinkedIn.

02:43.300 --> 02:46.200
 I try to be the opposite of what I was mocked for.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.700
 I try to think deeply about the world, to look for the beautiful ideas

02:49.700 --> 02:52.300
 and the minds of others, and to be inspired by them.

02:53.200 --> 02:57.600
 I wanted to say all this because psychologically, it struck a bit of a blow.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.500
 It made me realize that even when I approach things with love, I may be

03:02.500 --> 03:07.800
 mocked, I may be derided, I may be taken out of context or even lied about.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.100
 But the growing platform, this is sadly only increasing.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.700
 I now have learned that there's people who are waiting for my missteps

03:15.800 --> 03:20.300
 so they can point the finger, laugh, and say, see, I told you so.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
 That guy's a joke.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.700
 He's a fraud.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.900
 As a fellow human being, the knowledge of this is painful.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.500
 Yes, I know people tell me to toughen up, and my life has been about

03:32.500 --> 03:36.500
 strengthening my mind in the face of my limits, but I refuse to not be

03:36.500 --> 03:38.900
 fragile and wear my heart on my sleeve.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.000
 It's who I am.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.100
 In some sense, this is the immune system of the internet, but let us

03:44.100 --> 03:47.500
 be careful not to destroy the good ones in the process.

03:48.300 --> 03:52.000
 The Bitcoin community had to endure many years of attacks from

03:52.000 --> 03:55.600
 quote unquote experts and also fraudulent cryptocurrency efforts

03:55.800 --> 03:57.500
 that scam people out of their money.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
 This created a powerful immune system that fought the attackers

04:02.000 --> 04:02.800
 and the scammers.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.900
 I understand this, and I also understand that one of the beautiful

04:06.900 --> 04:12.300
 aspects of Bitcoin is its community of humans is decentralized, but

04:12.300 --> 04:15.900
 some small part of this community has come to enjoy the us versus

04:15.900 --> 04:20.000
 them battles, sometimes for the sake of the battle in itself.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.900
 This happens in political discourse as well.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.900
 I understand this, but to my limited mind, it sounds like group

04:27.900 --> 04:32.500
 think, which has powerful defense mechanisms against bad ideas, but

04:32.800 --> 04:35.500
 has dangerous consequences if taken too far.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.500
 As in many periods of human history that I often talk about, where

04:39.500 --> 04:43.700
 the us versus them thinking has led to the suffering of many.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.900
 Again, I understand the value of this as many Bitcoin has explained

04:47.900 --> 04:52.400
 to me, but it's not the way I, as a sovereign individual, choose to

04:52.400 --> 04:53.500
 walk in this life.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.000
 By the way, none of this podcast should be treated as financial

04:57.000 --> 05:01.300
 advice. Before Nick kindly gifted me with a hundred dollars worth

05:01.300 --> 05:05.600
 of Bitcoin in hardware form, I didn't own any.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.100
 I'll probably buy some Bitcoin on Cash App, Coinbase, and other

05:10.100 --> 05:13.600
 platforms, and also transfer to a hardware wallet just to learn

05:13.600 --> 05:14.200
 how to do it.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.100
 But other than that, I don't necessarily make wise investment

05:18.100 --> 05:21.100
 decisions. Money is not a motivation for me personally.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.800
 I try to avoid it actually.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.500
 I'm grateful for every day I'm alive, no matter how much money is

05:26.500 --> 05:29.700
 in my bank account. For long stretches of my life, that number

05:29.700 --> 05:34.100
 was very close to zero, and I was always fortunate to be free and

05:34.100 --> 05:38.100
 happy. So I encourage you to listen to people much smarter than

05:38.100 --> 05:42.800
 me for actual good financial advice. Here, I'm just exploring

05:42.800 --> 05:47.500
 ideas. And as if this has not already gone on too long, let me

05:47.500 --> 05:50.900
 please make another comment on the style of discourse among some

05:50.900 --> 05:55.800
 Bitcoin maximalists on platforms like Twitter, that in my humble

05:55.800 --> 06:00.100
 view, I may be wrong, but I believe is not conducive to the

06:00.100 --> 06:04.100
 nuanced empathetic exchange of ideas I very much look for and

06:04.100 --> 06:07.300
 enjoy. Again, I appreciate their style of discourse.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.600
 I think I understand the value of it, but it's not my thing.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.300
 So I don't want to engage in it.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
 I want to hear the quiet voices in the room.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.600
 I look for people to inspire each other, and when we disagree,

06:18.600 --> 06:22.500
 I look for disagreement that is grounded in respect and empathy.

06:22.500 --> 06:26.200
 I think that mockery and derision destroys the possibility of

06:26.200 --> 06:27.600
 those nuanced conversations.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
 It drives away the quiet, thoughtful, empathetic voices, and

06:32.000 --> 06:35.900
 I try to give those voices space to be heard, to shine, to

06:35.900 --> 06:39.000
 exchange ideas, whether we agree or disagree.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.600
 So, if I happen to block you on Twitter, I block you with love.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.200
 Honestly, I will never speak poorly of you or even think poorly

06:49.200 --> 06:52.600
 of you. I would love to hang out in person, give you a big old

06:52.600 --> 06:57.000
 hug, and talk about life over some beers. If you see or hear

06:57.000 --> 07:01.500
 me say something stupid, which I'm sure I do often, or something

07:01.500 --> 07:04.600
 you disagree with, and you still respect me as a human being,

07:04.600 --> 07:08.100
 please show your love, as I always do to you, but also send

07:08.100 --> 07:12.700
 me some links to blogs, books, videos, podcasts, where people

07:12.700 --> 07:16.200
 describe why my stated idea may be totally wrong.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.600
 I love this kind of long form disagreement. I humble myself

07:19.600 --> 07:23.300
 every day by reading books and blogs by people much smarter

07:23.300 --> 07:27.200
 than me. Sometimes it strengthens my ideas, sometimes it

07:27.200 --> 07:32.000
 totally changes them, but I always learn. This is a too long

07:32.000 --> 07:36.100
 way of saying that I'm here trying to walk with grace and

07:36.100 --> 07:41.200
 with an open mind, a bit of patience, and always love. If I

07:41.200 --> 07:45.500
 make mistakes, cut me some slack. Like you, I'm here trying

07:45.500 --> 07:51.700
 to love. Like you, I'm only human. Allegedly. This is the

07:51.700 --> 07:56.000
 Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Nick

07:56.000 --> 08:00.900
 Carter. What philosopher or philosophical idea had a big

08:00.900 --> 08:04.100
 impact on your life, not just in the space of cryptocurrency,

08:04.100 --> 08:04.800
 but in general?

08:05.400 --> 08:08.200
 Oh, so we're going now. We're rolling. We're going right in.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.000
 We're rolling. Because you majored philosophy. I did. I majored

08:11.000 --> 08:14.500
 in philosophy. I didn't know what to do with my life, and my

08:14.500 --> 08:16.900
 parents said, do whatever you find interesting. It's like,

08:16.900 --> 08:21.300
 okay, philosophy, great. I find that interesting. And it had

08:21.300 --> 08:25.500
 way more of an impact on my career, actually, than I thought

08:25.500 --> 08:28.700
 it might. Typically, I guess, if you do philosophy, you go into

08:28.700 --> 08:33.800
 law or finance, so it sort of makes sense. But there are a number

08:33.800 --> 08:38.000
 of philosophers I really admire. One of my favorites would

08:38.000 --> 08:42.200
 be Descartes, probably the notion of skepticism. It's sort of

08:42.200 --> 08:44.900
 a rabbit hole. It's kind of hard to pull yourself out of it.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.000
 Basically, the brain in the vat theory, pulling yourself out

08:48.000 --> 08:52.100
 of that. But yeah, I really like epistemology, you know,

08:52.100 --> 08:56.800
 questioning what it is to have knowledge. So Descartes was

08:56.800 --> 08:58.300
 one of my gateways to that.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.100
 Do you think everything is knowable? Like, we humans can

09:03.000 --> 09:05.800
 can know fully the objective reality?

09:05.900 --> 09:10.600
 Oh, definitely not. No, I mean, reality is very much processed

09:10.600 --> 09:13.000
 through your own, you know, subjective lens.

09:13.900 --> 09:18.100
 So how much do you think do we understand about this world?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.300
 Because a lot of your ideas, a lot of things we might talk

09:21.300 --> 09:25.300
 about today are kind of trying to figure out human civilization,

09:25.300 --> 09:29.400
 how humans, how human behavior works at scale, all those

09:29.400 --> 09:33.200
 kinds of things. That kind of assumes that we have it or

09:33.200 --> 09:38.800
 we're able to somehow figure most of it out, right? So in your

09:38.800 --> 09:42.300
 sort of when you step way back, how much of it have we really

09:42.300 --> 09:43.100
 figured out?

09:43.700 --> 09:47.000
 Well, I think that's the conceit of economics is thinking

09:47.000 --> 09:50.400
 that you can model human behavior in these unbelievably

09:50.400 --> 09:54.600
 complex systems. And then I think that's the modern critique

09:54.600 --> 09:58.200
 of economics, like the sort of Taliban critique is that you

09:58.200 --> 10:01.700
 can't have true knowledge, and they're much less predictable

10:01.700 --> 10:06.000
 than we think they are. And, you know, we behave according

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
 to our accumulated assumptions, and we're using tiny sort

10:09.000 --> 10:13.200
 of data sets trained on the last 50, 100 years, and they turn

10:13.200 --> 10:16.700
 out to be horribly askew. And that's when we have our gray

10:16.700 --> 10:21.900
 swans and our black swans. So I'm much more on the sort

10:21.900 --> 10:25.500
 of, you know, reality is much less noble than we think side

10:25.500 --> 10:28.800
 of things. But it is nice to have very concrete things like

10:28.800 --> 10:29.900
 Bitcoin, that's for sure.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.500
 Oh, so you think so most of it is shaky ground, but there

10:33.500 --> 10:36.200
 are some things there's like islands of stoniness.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.400
 Yeah, Bitcoin is one of them.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.000
 That's a good way to put it.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.700
 Yeah, I mean, like look at the dollar system, not to pivot

10:42.700 --> 10:46.400
 this into the dollar right away, but the dollar is like

10:46.400 --> 10:47.200
 shaky ground.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.600
 It's the most who truly understands the dollar system.

10:50.600 --> 10:55.000
 I mean, the totality of it, the Euro dollar system, the

10:55.000 --> 10:58.700
 way that monetary policy interacts with the economy is

10:58.800 --> 11:01.100
 monetary issuance inflationary.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.100
 What's the relationship between unemployment and inflation?

11:04.100 --> 11:06.600
 Even policymakers don't understand these things.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.600
 Economists don't seem to understand them.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.100
 What is inflation?

11:10.100 --> 11:11.100
 How do you define inflation?

11:11.100 --> 11:13.700
 None of these things are really known or knowable.

11:13.700 --> 11:17.100
 So a lot of people kind of make a claim that there's a

11:17.100 --> 11:20.300
 lot of manipulation possible with the dollar with those

11:20.300 --> 11:24.200
 currencies. If you couple that with the fact that people

11:24.200 --> 11:27.800
 don't understand it, and yet there's claims that being

11:27.800 --> 11:32.200
 manipulated by centralized power, how do you bring those

11:32.300 --> 11:33.700
 two ideas together?

11:33.900 --> 11:36.300
 If no one understands that, how can you manipulate it?

11:36.600 --> 11:39.700
 I think what we don't understand are the long term consequences

11:39.700 --> 11:41.600
 of our structures.

11:41.600 --> 11:46.400
 So like the Fed's mandate to target unemployment and

11:46.800 --> 11:51.700
 steady, you know, exchange rates or low inflation, you

11:51.700 --> 11:54.900
 know, what we don't understand is okay, what is the result

11:54.900 --> 11:57.000
 of doing that continuously for 40 years?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.200
 What is the net effect of that?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.700
 What is the consequence of the long term accumulation of

12:02.700 --> 12:06.200
 debt and, you know, basement interest rates?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.000
 What is the net effect of that on society?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.900
 We might understand there's much short term features of

12:12.900 --> 12:15.800
 the system, but I think it's the longer term features

12:15.800 --> 12:16.500
 we don't understand.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.600
 Do you think there's like malevolent people with people

12:20.600 --> 12:24.400
 that don't have good intent in central banks like in the

12:24.400 --> 12:29.800
 system, you know, when you have centralized power in any

12:29.800 --> 12:35.700
 forms, it's susceptible to somebody hacking the system,

12:35.900 --> 12:39.600
 taking the power, and in the shadows, this is where conspiracy

12:39.600 --> 12:40.900
 theories come in, right?

12:40.900 --> 12:48.900
 In the shadows, be able to, you know, act out things that

12:48.900 --> 12:51.200
 have a lot of negative impacts on a large percent of the

12:51.200 --> 12:54.600
 population in greedy self interest.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.900
 Do you think there's people like that?

12:55.900 --> 12:59.000
 Or do you think fundamentally most people are good, even

12:59.300 --> 13:03.200
 those associated with the sort of central banking?

13:03.800 --> 13:06.100
 I mean, I don't villainize those people.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.000
 I think everyone is the hero of their own story, right?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.300
 So they all believe that their force are good in the world.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.100
 You have to.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.100
 Are there any true villains?

13:15.100 --> 13:15.800
 I don't think so.

13:15.800 --> 13:20.000
 I think they get socialized into a world where they believe

13:20.000 --> 13:24.400
 there's particular skills and their mandate is, you know,

13:24.400 --> 13:25.600
 what they should be doing.

13:27.100 --> 13:31.400
 I think they might be presumptuous or arrogant in some cases.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.300
 And, you know, I think it's more of a systemic issue where

13:36.300 --> 13:41.700
 you have a small handful of very homogenous types of people

13:41.700 --> 13:45.500
 with PhDs from the same institutions that are brought up

13:45.500 --> 13:50.100
 in the same cultural context that, you know, set policy and

13:50.100 --> 13:52.700
 wield a tremendous amount of control over society.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.400
 And I think they have this notion that you can tinker society.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.500
 You can play with a few key variables and tinker society

14:00.500 --> 14:03.800
 into a state that is desirable or good.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.600
 And that's what they're trying to do.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.100
 And I think the consequences of that can be pretty bad.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.300
 But no, I don't think it's born out of malevolence.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.500
 There's an interesting idea.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.500
 I think Michael Malas brought it up as a test whether you're

14:17.500 --> 14:18.700
 on the left or the right.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.400
 The question he asks, which is, do you think some people

14:24.400 --> 14:25.600
 are better than others?

14:27.700 --> 14:30.400
 If you say yes, he claims you're on the right.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.700
 If you start answering, if you start like saying a lot of

14:34.700 --> 14:39.800
 things, like you're on the left.

14:39.900 --> 14:44.000
 So if you start explaining yourself, well, it's a good term for it.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
 I was really, so in this test, I suppose I would be on the left

14:51.000 --> 14:54.500
 because I'm uncomfortable with the idea that some people are

14:54.500 --> 14:59.200
 better than others as a basic feeling, as a starting point in

14:59.200 --> 15:00.500
 the way you think about the world.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.500
 Because as we're talking about, everybody's a hero of their own

15:04.500 --> 15:08.200
 story. When you start to think some people are better than

15:08.200 --> 15:15.000
 others, as a starting axiom, it's like a slippery slope to

15:15.000 --> 15:20.200
 where you think you're way better than others.

15:20.900 --> 15:25.700
 And then you start to like, basically, it's okay to take

15:25.700 --> 15:29.200
 advantage of a large percent of the population for the greater

15:29.200 --> 15:33.800
 good. And then you go into Stalin mode and Hitler mode where

15:33.800 --> 15:37.600
 it's okay to murder a larger part of the population for the

15:37.600 --> 15:41.100
 greater good. So it's like, it's this very dangerous slippery

15:41.100 --> 15:42.100
 slope in my mind.

15:42.100 --> 15:46.000
 So I try to not, yeah, I was always uncomfortable with that

15:46.000 --> 15:48.700
 kind of test or even that kind of thought. And yes, the same

15:48.700 --> 15:54.300
 applies and suppose in government, in central banking is if

15:54.300 --> 15:58.000
 you think some people are better than others, applying your

15:58.000 --> 16:03.100
 idea of what is good can have large scale detrimental effects.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.400
 Of course.

16:04.400 --> 16:04.900
 Yeah.

16:04.900 --> 16:09.900
 I'm glad you didn't pose me the question. I mean, I think it

16:09.900 --> 16:14.700
 maybe not the left right axiom isn't the disjunction isn't the

16:14.700 --> 16:20.200
 way I would sort of put it. But you know, to me, it's just if

16:20.200 --> 16:23.700
 you reason in a consequentialist way, you know, that lends

16:23.700 --> 16:27.300
 itself to authoritarianism. Yeah, where whereby you think

16:27.300 --> 16:30.500
 you can shape society and only you can shape society in a

16:30.500 --> 16:35.600
 positive direction according to your, you know, specific objectives.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.900
 So let's step onto the land of sturdiness that is Bitcoin.

16:39.900 --> 16:45.700
 What is Bitcoin and in your view, what are, you know, the

16:45.700 --> 16:48.600
 principles, the philosophical foundations of Bitcoin?

16:48.600 --> 16:54.100
 Well, Bitcoin the term I think refers to two things specifically.

16:54.100 --> 16:59.300
 So one is the protocol for conveying value through a communications

16:59.300 --> 17:03.100
 channel. So just a set of rules that we collectively opt into

17:03.100 --> 17:08.000
 in order to transact online or just at a distance.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.400
 And then the other thing is the name of the asset, the sort of

17:13.400 --> 17:17.900
 monetary unit which circulates within the system and that always

17:17.900 --> 17:20.700
 confuse people a lot because it's like, well, you got uppercase

17:20.700 --> 17:24.400
 Bitcoin, lowercase Bitcoin, why didn't Satoshi just give them

17:24.400 --> 17:28.600
 different names? Like in Ethereum, you've got Ethereum, the system

17:28.600 --> 17:31.900
 and then Ether. Although people don't really talk about Ether very

17:31.900 --> 17:37.100
 much, but they, you know, chose to distinguish them. In Bitcoin,

17:37.100 --> 17:41.600
 for whatever reason, they're not distinct. So the two Bitcoins

17:41.600 --> 17:45.800
 get commingled all the time in the explanations. Did you find

17:45.800 --> 17:48.600
 that's a problem that confuses things? I mean, what's what's

17:48.600 --> 17:51.100
 really a distinction between the protocol and the currency?

17:51.100 --> 17:55.700
 Well, they are sometimes distinguished practically, like you can

17:55.700 --> 17:59.600
 transact with Bitcoin outside of the Bitcoin protocol, for instance.

17:59.600 --> 18:06.100
 So, you know, you can transact with Bitcoin on Ethereum or I have

18:06.100 --> 18:10.300
 Bitcoin on Opendime here. This would be a Bitcoin transaction.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.000
 It wouldn't settle on the Bitcoin network. Do you mind explaining

18:13.000 --> 18:16.400
 what you have on the table before us? Yeah, so I brought you some

18:16.400 --> 18:20.700
 presents. This is awesome. This isn't a bribe. This is just a proof

18:20.700 --> 18:27.100
 of concept. So this is basically a Bitcoin bearer instrument.

18:27.100 --> 18:32.100
 So I put a hundred bucks of Bitcoin on here. And to spend it,

18:32.100 --> 18:35.100
 you have to basically physically destroy part of the device.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.600
 You have to poke a hole and, you know, poke off one of the little

18:38.600 --> 18:44.800
 transistors on this. So it can only be spent once. And you can't

18:44.800 --> 18:48.100
 extract the private key from this device. So the private key was

18:48.100 --> 18:52.600
 generated on device, always stays on the device. So what it means

18:52.600 --> 18:59.900
 without breaking off, like a small part. So this basically is a way

18:59.900 --> 19:06.100
 to physically instantiate Bitcoin. So it's basically gold.

19:06.100 --> 19:10.300
 Yeah, effectively. So here. Thank you so much. This one's limited

19:10.300 --> 19:15.100
 edition. It's orange. So what is it called again? Opendime.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.700
 The point is, if you wanted to settle a Bitcoin transaction

19:18.700 --> 19:22.800
 instantly, the kind of same way that a cash transaction is instant

19:22.800 --> 19:27.100
 final settlement, right? You would do it with a device like this.

19:27.100 --> 19:32.300
 So if I was buying a house from you, you know, you might prefer

19:32.300 --> 19:36.500
 to do it with a physical bearer instrument as opposed to waiting

19:36.500 --> 19:40.900
 for confirmation on the Bitcoin blockchain. So the moment I hand

19:40.900 --> 19:43.600
 that over to you, goes in your possession, you're the owner.

19:43.600 --> 19:47.700
 There's no way for me to have retained the private key. Like I

19:47.700 --> 19:50.400
 could have created a Bitcoin paper wallet and given that to you,

19:50.400 --> 19:54.100
 but you have no assurance that I didn't copy down that, you know,

19:54.100 --> 19:57.100
 the key elsewhere. So this solves that problem.

19:57.100 --> 20:03.100
 So this is a physical instantiation of the Bitcoin transaction

20:03.100 --> 20:04.800
 outside the Bitcoin protocol.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.400
 That's right.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.200
 So this is, you're transacting the currency outside of the protocol.

20:08.200 --> 20:13.000
 So it's analog Bitcoin. We're running it analog, which I was like,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.300
 because Bitcoin is this immaterial thing. And so it's nice to have

20:16.300 --> 20:17.500
 physical totems.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.600
 How much does it cost to manufacture this, do you know?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.300
 Like 15 bucks or something.

20:22.300 --> 20:27.100
 So this is just kind of almost like a philosophical statement

20:27.100 --> 20:33.900
 versus something that's scalable for use. Like, you know, the point

20:33.900 --> 20:35.900
 of Bitcoin is to be in the digital space, right?

20:35.900 --> 20:38.900
 But this shows like Bitcoin can be anywhere.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.200
 It's useful for gifts.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.600
 But yeah, I mean, I don't know if it would be a suitable foundation

20:44.600 --> 20:48.100
 for a physical Bitcoin economy. In theory, these would be like

20:48.100 --> 20:50.400
 cash like instruments that you could use to transact.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.400
 Well, I just mean post apocalypse.

20:52.400 --> 20:57.100
 Yeah, yeah. But you still need to plug it into your laptop to

20:57.100 --> 20:59.800
 actually verify that there's coins on there.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.800
 So you still need the internet.

21:01.800 --> 21:06.300
 So I have to take your word for how much money is on here.

21:06.300 --> 21:10.100
 No, I mean, you can plug it into your laptop and check.

21:10.100 --> 21:15.000
 Yeah, but to transact, to extract Bitcoin from this, I need to break.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.900
 Yeah, you have to poke a hole through the little hole and that

21:18.900 --> 21:21.400
 renders it spendable, basically.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.800
 So, you know, that's protection against you spending it and then

21:25.800 --> 21:27.500
 representing that it's still loaded.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.100
 That's fascinating. Cool.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.300
 Yeah, so that the other thing I brought here, basically dice,

21:32.300 --> 21:37.400
 12 sided, they don't have any Bitcoin on them.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.200
 So they just have a bunch of different critiques of Bitcoin on

21:41.200 --> 21:44.900
 each side. We'll go through them then.

21:44.900 --> 21:45.700
 This is awesome.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.900
 I don't know if we have time to do all 11 because there's one

21:48.900 --> 21:50.700
 with my funds logo on it.

21:50.700 --> 21:55.600
 But it's just basically a tongue in cheek joke that the critiques

21:55.600 --> 21:58.300
 of Bitcoin are so formulaic at this point that you can just

21:58.300 --> 21:59.200
 put them on dice.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.800
 Yeah, it's silly.

22:01.800 --> 22:06.900
 Well, some of them might be topics for interesting conversations.

22:06.900 --> 22:10.100
 Oh, yeah. We could even arrange the conversation that way.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.700
 You can roll the dice and see what you got.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.600
 All right.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.400
 But first, the philosophical foundations of Bitcoin.

22:17.400 --> 22:21.500
 Like, how do you see Bitcoin outside of just a basic protocol

22:21.500 --> 22:22.700
 and a basic currency?

22:22.700 --> 22:27.400
 It seems to be, like you said, it seems like sturdy ground.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.400
 So what do you mean by this?

22:28.400 --> 22:28.600
 Yeah.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.200
 Yeah.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.000
 So it's not just any protocol for moving value around.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.100
 It's not just any currency.

22:33.100 --> 22:37.700
 It's got specific rules and values that are embedded in it.

22:37.700 --> 22:41.400
 And this is an important point is that Bitcoin is the encoding

22:41.400 --> 22:47.800
 of certain values, which are often misunderstood or not acknowledged

22:47.800 --> 22:48.500
 necessarily.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.600
 And so it's sort of impregnated with values.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.300
 And what they are specifically is a topic of debate.

22:55.300 --> 22:59.900
 And there have been civil wars fought over the values inherent

22:59.900 --> 23:00.500
 in Bitcoin.

23:00.500 --> 23:05.700
 One of them was, should Bitcoin be this cheap, scalable, the base

23:05.700 --> 23:10.400
 layer, low fee payments system with an emphasis on P2P payments?

23:10.400 --> 23:16.300
 Or should it be more of this gold like digital commodity that

23:16.300 --> 23:21.200
 would eventually settle infrequently and mainly between institutions?

23:21.200 --> 23:21.500
 Right?

23:21.500 --> 23:24.100
 So that's fundamentally a conflict of visions.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.000
 Right?

23:25.000 --> 23:30.500
 So keep in mind that this is just one man's opinion.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.600
 I don't speak for Bitcoin.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.500
 Right?

23:32.500 --> 23:38.000
 So I would say the key number one value that's embedded in

23:38.000 --> 23:41.300
 Bitcoin is the notion of nondiscretionary monetary policy.

23:41.300 --> 23:45.800
 So algorithmic monetary policy as opposed to human based

23:45.800 --> 23:46.700
 monetary policy.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.800
 Satoshi was very clear about that.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.900
 Bitcoin is an alternative to modern central banking where you

23:52.900 --> 23:57.700
 have constant tweaking, constant intervention, which Satoshi felt

23:57.700 --> 23:59.800
 leads to credit bubbles and so on.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.700
 So Bitcoin proposes a completely nondiscretionary monetary

24:04.700 --> 24:08.600
 policy, sort of decays over time.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.800
 50% of the coins were issued in the first four years and then

24:11.800 --> 24:16.100
 the next 25% in the next four years, then 12.5% in the next

24:16.100 --> 24:18.800
 four years until you get to 21 million units.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.000
 And none of those numbers really matter.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.300
 Like it could have been 25 million units and it could have

24:24.300 --> 24:26.700
 been a more aggressive slope or more gradual slope.

24:26.700 --> 24:31.500
 What matters is that this schedule was proposed even before

24:31.500 --> 24:33.500
 the code was public.

24:33.500 --> 24:37.600
 The schedule was proposed and then we all collectively agreed

24:37.600 --> 24:38.300
 to stick to it.

24:38.300 --> 24:41.800
 And that is kind of a first for monetary system.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.600
 I mean, gold kind of has that property, right?

24:45.600 --> 24:49.300
 Because the supply of gold above ground only really increases

24:49.300 --> 24:53.700
 at 1% to 2% a year. So it's sort of inhuman, which is a good

24:53.700 --> 24:54.300
 feature, right?

24:54.300 --> 24:56.600
 You don't want to give humans that much control over it.

24:56.600 --> 25:02.500
 Bitcoin is a much more, you know, fastidious approach to that.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.600
 It really is super concrete about what the supply schedule

25:06.600 --> 25:09.600
 is and the fact, crucially, that it can't change.

25:09.600 --> 25:13.400
 So we can't have a bailout of debtors.

25:13.400 --> 25:17.900
 Let's say a lot of people had debts denominated in Bitcoin

25:17.900 --> 25:21.200
 and we needed loose, accommodative monetary policy to bail them

25:21.200 --> 25:22.700
 out. That's not possible.

25:22.700 --> 25:26.900
 We couldn't have a jubilee denominated in Bitcoin because the

25:26.900 --> 25:32.500
 social contract we've all bought into and committed to is that

25:32.500 --> 25:36.400
 it's nondiscretionary. So that's sort of one of the first things.

25:36.400 --> 25:41.700
 And I think ultimately that comes back to basically a strong

25:41.700 --> 25:46.600
 respect for property rights because if we were to have unanticipated

25:46.600 --> 25:51.000
 inflation, let's say a really charismatic leader somehow commandeered

25:51.000 --> 25:53.900
 Bitcoin and convinced everyone that we should have 30 million units

25:53.900 --> 25:58.800
 and not 21 million, that would basically be dilutive on everybody

25:58.800 --> 26:05.100
 that held Bitcoin and had opted into the 21 million set of coins.

26:05.100 --> 26:09.100
 An additional 9 million unanticipated would have a dilutive effect

26:09.100 --> 26:09.800
 on everyone else.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.000
 And that would be a covert way of effectively stealing their

26:13.000 --> 26:14.800
 purchasing power through inflation.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.200
 Is that possible, that kind of thing?

26:16.200 --> 26:20.700
 I mean, what's the mechanism of Bitcoin that resists that kind of

26:20.700 --> 26:21.500
 charismatic leader?

26:21.500 --> 26:26.700
 Well, we've had people that have had a lot of influence in Bitcoin

26:26.700 --> 26:30.200
 in the past and they've tried to make changes to the protocol, not

26:30.200 --> 26:36.100
 as dramatic as that, but Bitcoiners have generally resisted those

26:36.100 --> 26:41.100
 individuals, institutions, and Bitcoiners have a good track record

26:41.100 --> 26:44.200
 of sort of staying true to those core values.

26:44.200 --> 26:51.000
 So you mentioned values and sticking to the monetary thing, but

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
 there's bigger values.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.600
 There's almost like psychological values that are instilled in

26:56.600 --> 27:01.100
 Bitcoin. You make a point that Bitcoin for many is a vessel, quote,

27:01.100 --> 27:04.300
 for their expectations, hopes, and dreams.

27:04.300 --> 27:11.000
 Can the Bitcoin protocol support this kind of complexity of the

27:11.000 --> 27:11.800
 human condition?

27:11.800 --> 27:17.200
 So, like, there's ideas of freedom that seem to be spoken about.

27:17.200 --> 27:23.300
 There's a sort of ideas of, I mean, even love.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.300
 Yeah.

27:24.300 --> 27:28.500
 I mean, some people kind of use it as a meme, like, you know, Bitcoin

27:28.500 --> 27:32.600
 is love or something like that, you know, mostly to troll me because

27:32.600 --> 27:33.800
 I talk about love all the time.

27:33.800 --> 27:39.900
 But, you know, these bigger ideas than just the exchange of

27:39.900 --> 27:40.500
 currencies.

27:40.500 --> 27:45.300
 Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin itself is very simple, I would say.

27:45.300 --> 27:50.400
 Like, ultimately, it doesn't, you know, pretend to do very much.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.200
 It really just settles transactions.

27:52.200 --> 27:57.900
 But people do superimpose their own views on it, for sure.

27:57.900 --> 28:05.100
 And Bitcoin's qualities give rise to these perceptions of it having

28:05.100 --> 28:09.900
 censorship resistance or giving you transactional freedom or a measure

28:09.900 --> 28:11.200
 of transactional privacy.

28:11.200 --> 28:18.400
 So because anyone can operate a node and join the consensus process

28:18.400 --> 28:22.900
 and because mining is a competitive free market process, that means

28:22.900 --> 28:28.100
 that it's likely that you can't be censored by the miners.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.000
 So that means you have transactional freedom.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
 So you have these computer science technical features of the system

28:34.000 --> 28:38.200
 that cause it to have these political qualities, which is it's very

28:38.200 --> 28:41.500
 hard or impossible to censor a specific individual.

28:41.500 --> 28:45.900
 So it's interesting to see that flow.

28:45.900 --> 28:50.400
 So that's one of the core values, for sure, is the censorship resistance.

28:50.400 --> 28:56.000
 Then you have the fact that it's a cryptographic based system and you

28:56.000 --> 28:59.500
 can hold value in your brain by memorizing 12 words, for instance.

28:59.500 --> 29:04.600
 That gives it seizure resistance, which is, again, a political concept.

29:04.600 --> 29:09.800
 If you wanted to desert your jurisdiction with your wealth intact in your

29:09.800 --> 29:15.400
 brain, that cryptographic feature of the system, the fact that it's

29:15.400 --> 29:20.100
 built on public key cryptography and that you can encode a Bitcoin private

29:20.100 --> 29:27.400
 key in 12 words, that gives it this political salience that you're now

29:27.400 --> 29:30.200
 empowered relative to a despot, basically.

29:30.200 --> 29:35.300
 Yeah, I mean, there's so many beautiful concepts behind cryptocurrency,

29:35.300 --> 29:40.800
 behind Bitcoin, that stand for sort of freedom, some of the basic

29:40.800 --> 29:42.300
 things at the founding of this country.

29:42.300 --> 29:48.500
 The one thing I don't like personally behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies

29:48.500 --> 29:52.700
 that money is involved and it's like people's life savings sometimes are

29:52.700 --> 30:01.100
 involved, so there is naturally a kind of fear, a self preservation, like

30:01.100 --> 30:07.400
 instinctual kind of dogmatic thing that comes in where you're not the best

30:07.400 --> 30:08.100
 of human nature.

30:08.100 --> 30:14.000
 You stop being a George Washington and you lose touch of the foundational

30:14.000 --> 30:17.100
 principles, which I think are beautiful, just like the founding principles

30:17.100 --> 30:17.800
 of this country.

30:17.800 --> 30:23.000
 So that's just like, so I like staying on the level of like the

30:23.000 --> 30:29.300
 philosophy versus the level of like all my money is invested in Bitcoin

30:29.300 --> 30:35.600
 and that becomes very tricky territory to have principle discussions

30:35.600 --> 30:37.300
 about ideas.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.500
 Well, it's an interesting tension.

30:39.500 --> 30:43.100
 I try to stay balanced despite being very exposed to Bitcoin.

30:43.100 --> 30:48.300
 So let me ask the ridiculous question, just in case, who is Satoshi

30:48.300 --> 30:50.300
 Nakamoto and is it you?

30:50.300 --> 30:51.100
 We don't know.

30:51.100 --> 30:59.800
 It's probably not me because I was like 17 when Satoshi mounted Bitcoin,

30:59.800 --> 31:04.700
 16, so unlikely and also not really a programmer.

31:04.700 --> 31:09.500
 So there's a lot of theories, but honestly, it's one of the greatest

31:09.500 --> 31:13.300
 mysteries of all time because even Bitcoiners that have been around

31:13.300 --> 31:19.000
 since day one, really, you know, people that were around before Bitcoin

31:19.000 --> 31:21.700
 came out, they're on the mailing list, they're active in the cypherpunk

31:21.700 --> 31:26.400
 community, you ask them and they sincerely will not know and they may

31:26.400 --> 31:29.000
 not even have a good guess as to who Satoshi is.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.500
 Is it important to know or is it like actually important not to know?

31:32.500 --> 31:35.500
 Do you think that's a feature or bug that you, we don't know?

31:35.500 --> 31:39.700
 Some people don't like the uncertainty, especially, you know, folks on

31:39.700 --> 31:41.400
 Wall Street, they really want to know.

31:41.400 --> 31:48.200
 And if you read the Coinbase S1, their disclosure pre IPO, that's a risk

31:48.200 --> 31:50.200
 factor that Satoshi could come back.

31:50.200 --> 31:56.000
 So the risk management crowd wants to know because they want to know

31:56.000 --> 32:00.400
 if maybe Satoshi had, you know, undesirable political opinions or

32:00.400 --> 32:02.700
 something that would forever taint the project.

32:02.700 --> 32:06.800
 Do you think they were just trolling with that risk with Satoshi's

32:06.800 --> 32:11.800
 identity being a risk factor or is that like actual, like, was there

32:11.800 --> 32:14.800
 an actual meeting and a discussion of that being a risk factor?

32:14.800 --> 32:18.300
 I think in the risk factor sections of the prospectuses, it's really

32:18.300 --> 32:21.500
 just the lawyers doing a total brain dump to cover absolutely everything

32:21.500 --> 32:22.200
 they can think of.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.200
 So it's just lawyers.

32:23.200 --> 32:29.000
 It's not like, you know, it's like, I think Elon was somewhere in the

32:29.000 --> 32:34.800
 legal documents for SpaceX mentioned that like Earth governments have

32:34.800 --> 32:36.300
 no jurisdiction on Mars.

32:36.300 --> 32:39.800
 Like they threw that in there and it feels like, yeah, that could be

32:39.800 --> 32:42.300
 lawyers, but it could also just be Elon trolling.

32:42.300 --> 32:42.700
 Yeah.

32:42.700 --> 32:48.900
 So I wonder if it's like the Coinbase folks trolling or if it's lawyers.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.000
 I hope it's the trolling, not the lawyers.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.800
 The Coinbase leadership, they're not as big trolls as Elon is, but I

32:56.800 --> 33:01.100
 mean, it's a risk for sure from their perspective because let's say

33:01.100 --> 33:04.300
 Satoshi returned, doesn't seem likely, and let's say they decided to

33:04.300 --> 33:07.300
 spend all their coins, which also seems very unlikely.

33:07.300 --> 33:14.100
 That's, you know, rumored to be or estimates have it at 1 to 1.2

33:14.100 --> 33:19.900
 million Bitcoin, which is like 50, 60 billion dollars worth.

33:19.900 --> 33:23.300
 So some people consider that to be a risk.

33:23.300 --> 33:27.600
 You think it's, you know, this is almost like a topic of leadership.

33:27.600 --> 33:32.400
 It doesn't feel like anybody, any one person speaks for Bitcoin.

33:32.400 --> 33:38.200
 There's not even like prominent figures.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.800
 Like you have for like Ethereum, you have Vitalik Buterin.

33:41.800 --> 33:48.800
 There's a lot of like top minds talking about it like yourself, but

33:48.800 --> 33:50.200
 it's not like one or two.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.100
 Do you think again, is that a feature or a bug?

33:53.100 --> 33:58.400
 Like, do you think for effective, for Bitcoin to effectively have a

33:58.400 --> 34:04.700
 role in society that like is as large or larger than the dollar, there

34:04.700 --> 34:10.100
 needs to be like leadership that represents it, almost like democratic

34:10.100 --> 34:10.600
 kind of thing.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.600
 Well, that's a real counterintuitive point because most Bitcoiners,

34:14.600 --> 34:18.300
 including myself, would say, no, the lack of leadership is a great

34:18.300 --> 34:22.700
 quality to have because if you have a charismatic leader and a foundation

34:22.700 --> 34:26.700
 or corporation that controls it, maybe they can control the features

34:26.700 --> 34:31.400
 of the protocol and maybe they can expropriate holders of the coin

34:31.400 --> 34:37.500
 or, you know, build in an endowment that pays them off and gives them

34:37.500 --> 34:40.700
 privileged access to the units of the coin, for instance.

34:40.700 --> 34:45.900
 So, you know, we call people that have privileged access to the money

34:45.900 --> 34:50.800
 spigot Cantillon insiders, which is there is this economist that pointed

34:50.800 --> 34:55.500
 out that as you know, I think Richard Cantillon that as money enters

34:55.500 --> 34:58.200
 the economy has an uneven flow, right?

34:58.200 --> 35:04.400
 So you see this in last last decade or so before that to the consequence

35:04.400 --> 35:07.900
 of money printing in this country is people that own financial assets

35:07.900 --> 35:10.300
 made a lot of money and people that didn't didn't.

35:10.300 --> 35:15.900
 So you see that Cantillon insider Cantillon outsider effect and it's

35:15.900 --> 35:20.300
 the same with a cryptocurrency in many other alternative cryptocurrencies

35:20.300 --> 35:24.900
 that do have these corporate entities or these leaders and CEOs.

35:24.900 --> 35:29.700
 They're able to make specific decisions regarding the protocol and the

35:29.700 --> 35:33.100
 currency of the asset the benefit themselves the cronies, etc.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.800
 And that's not a good feature to have.

35:35.800 --> 35:41.800
 I mean, it does grant you, you know, the ability to orchestrate decisions

35:41.800 --> 35:43.500
 in a faster and more efficient way.

35:43.500 --> 35:47.800
 But long term what you're trying to optimize for if you're creating

35:47.800 --> 35:52.000
 a money is monetary credibility and soundness so you don't really

35:52.000 --> 35:55.600
 want it changing all that often and you don't want to have the

35:55.600 --> 35:59.900
 appearance of you know, these elites that are engaging in rent

35:59.900 --> 36:01.000
 seeking or anything like that.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.500
 So there's definitely people that are influential in Bitcoin this

36:04.500 --> 36:07.600
 core developers that people listen to because it's I would say

36:07.600 --> 36:11.600
 meritocracy largely and they're sort of self appointed high priest

36:11.600 --> 36:12.300
 of the protocol.

36:12.300 --> 36:16.600
 I write a lot about Bitcoin people listen to me but is a completely

36:16.600 --> 36:18.800
 free market of ideas, right?

36:18.800 --> 36:21.800
 I don't have any authority within Bitcoin whatsoever.

36:21.800 --> 36:30.300
 I'm just a scribbler, you know, so was Aristotle and Socrates and Nietzsche.

36:30.300 --> 36:36.300
 Okay, at the high level, technically, how does Bitcoin work?

36:36.300 --> 36:38.800
 Is there interesting things you could say?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.900
 Like what are miners?

36:39.900 --> 36:41.900
 What are nodes, full nodes?

36:41.900 --> 36:42.800
 What are blocks?

36:42.800 --> 36:44.500
 What's proof of work?

36:44.500 --> 36:50.300
 Is there a nice way to wrap up a clean explanation of the protocol?

36:50.300 --> 36:54.300
 Oh man, that could be a whole, that could be another five hours.

36:54.300 --> 36:58.000
 Is there interesting because I'd love to talk to you about block

36:58.000 --> 37:02.700
 size wars and sort of the politics psychology, the principles

37:02.700 --> 37:04.600
 around that, but sort of building up to that.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.900
 It'd be nice to talk about how the thing works.

37:06.900 --> 37:07.800
 That's fair.

37:07.800 --> 37:12.000
 I mean, and the block size wars are really fascinating discussion

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
 of how governance debates intersect with technical features.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
 So I guess we can, yeah, so basically at the highest possible

37:23.000 --> 37:26.400
 level, Bitcoin is a globally shared.

37:26.400 --> 37:32.500
 It's really a replicated ledger that any participant that wants to

37:32.500 --> 37:37.200
 be an equal peer on that ledger, they want to maintain that ledger

37:37.200 --> 37:40.700
 and they want to stay up to date with the global state of the ledger.

37:40.700 --> 37:46.700
 And really any monetary system is just a ledger with physical

37:46.700 --> 37:52.600
 cash. We benefit from the physical instantiation of the money.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.400
 So the physics is the ledger.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.800
 The physics is a ledger, right?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.200
 Same with gold, right?

37:57.200 --> 37:59.100
 You can't just produce new units of gold.

37:59.100 --> 38:05.600
 So we trust that gold atoms are hard to create, although not

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
 impossible, right?

38:06.600 --> 38:12.300
 You could find a bunch of protons and whatever is the adjacent

38:12.300 --> 38:15.200
 metal and create gold atoms would be expensive.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.600
 And the same with dollars, you know, we trust that it's hard to

38:18.600 --> 38:19.400
 counterfeit a dollar.

38:19.400 --> 38:23.900
 So we trust the physical analog world to help maintain the state

38:23.900 --> 38:28.400
 of that ledger with digital money, like, you know, the money in

38:28.400 --> 38:30.500
 your bank account, your checking account.

38:30.500 --> 38:34.800
 We basically trust our institutions or banking institutions to

38:34.800 --> 38:36.600
 keep a faithful record.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.800
 And then ultimately we trust the central bank to administer that

38:39.800 --> 38:42.600
 system. So there's kind of a handful of nodes.

38:42.600 --> 38:46.600
 In Bitcoin, we trust that the economic incentives of the system

38:46.600 --> 38:49.200
 are carefully poised, basically.

38:49.200 --> 38:54.500
 So we trust that the free market mining competition will lead to

38:54.500 --> 38:58.800
 the miners assembling transactions into blocks in a faithful and

38:58.800 --> 39:03.000
 correct way, and that we are going to converge on a global state

39:03.000 --> 39:04.500
 of the ledger continuously.

39:04.500 --> 39:08.300
 Which updates every 10 minutes or so with some variance.

39:08.300 --> 39:12.700
 And then the miners aren't the sole entities that control the

39:12.700 --> 39:17.000
 system. To really participate, if you are a merchant and you're

39:17.000 --> 39:20.700
 accepting Bitcoin, you really want to run your own full node and

39:20.700 --> 39:22.500
 check the whole history of transactions.

39:22.500 --> 39:26.100
 Sort of something like, I want to say, five to six hundred million

39:26.100 --> 39:28.100
 transactions that have ever occurred on Bitcoin.

39:28.100 --> 39:33.100
 So full node contains all the transactions ever transacted on

39:33.100 --> 39:34.800
 the Bitcoin blockchain.

39:34.800 --> 39:39.300
 And that's, I saw it's like 200 gigs or something like that.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.400
 Like 350, something like that.

39:41.400 --> 39:45.600
 It's doable on a regular consumer laptop and that is going to be

39:45.600 --> 39:47.700
 really key later on in the discussion.

39:47.700 --> 39:53.000
 But so, you know, that's really the ultimate trust models.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.700
 First of all, we trust that the miners that assemble transactions

39:55.700 --> 39:59.900
 into blocks and they are the archivists, you know, they inscribe

39:59.900 --> 40:03.700
 those transactions onto the ledger and they have an economic

40:03.700 --> 40:06.100
 incentive to sort of behave correctly because they're getting

40:06.100 --> 40:07.700
 paid in no units of Bitcoin.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.600
 That's part of it.

40:09.600 --> 40:13.900
 But then really you are also, you're not fully trusting them.

40:13.900 --> 40:16.500
 You're actually, if you want to run a node, you replay every

40:16.500 --> 40:19.900
 single transaction in the history of Bitcoin from the beginning

40:19.900 --> 40:23.300
 to the current day and you arrive at the present state that way.

40:23.300 --> 40:27.400
 So you don't really have to trust too many people or entities.

40:27.400 --> 40:31.800
 You can validate the correctness that all the rules have been

40:31.800 --> 40:34.800
 followed, that all the Bitcoins that were created were done so in

40:34.800 --> 40:39.900
 the valid way, that the inflation rate was adhered to and that

40:39.900 --> 40:44.000
 there's no covert inflation, you know, that if you're spending

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
 50 units of Bitcoin, you had that Bitcoin to spend in the first

40:49.000 --> 40:54.100
 place. So it's sort of delicately poised between node operators

40:54.100 --> 40:58.500
 who, you know, engage in this validity checking kind of anti

40:58.500 --> 41:01.700
 counterfeiting checking and then also the miners which are an

41:01.700 --> 41:06.400
 industrial entity and they basically produce block space and

41:06.400 --> 41:08.500
 assemble transactions in a box.

41:08.500 --> 41:12.900
 And everybody, so the miners are incentivized to not mess with

41:12.900 --> 41:15.300
 the system because they're getting value from the system.

41:15.300 --> 41:20.200
 So if they mess with it, it's going to decrease the value of

41:20.200 --> 41:23.100
 their physical work investment.

41:23.100 --> 41:27.500
 Yeah, so they have to incur a real physical cost to produce a

41:27.500 --> 41:28.100
 block, right?

41:28.100 --> 41:34.200
 So right now you get 6.25 Bitcoins in a block at a minimum

41:34.200 --> 41:35.900
 and then maybe some fees as well.

41:35.900 --> 41:38.400
 How hard is it to produce a block now?

41:38.400 --> 41:39.600
 Well, challenging.

41:39.600 --> 41:44.800
 I mean, you need, so 6.25 Bitcoins and a Bitcoin is worth

41:44.800 --> 41:46.400
 $55,000 or so.

41:46.400 --> 41:50.700
 So it's probably going to cost you about that amount to produce

41:50.700 --> 41:54.400
 it because it's a free market competition and miners have

41:54.400 --> 41:56.100
 very thin margins.

41:56.100 --> 42:00.500
 So it's like if I auction off a dollar, you would pay up to

42:00.500 --> 42:02.700
 $0.99 to buy that dollar from me.

42:02.700 --> 42:05.000
 Exactly what happens with miners.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.700
 They're, you know, basically competing for the right to obtain

42:10.700 --> 42:11.600
 new units of money.

42:11.600 --> 42:15.200
 So logically speaking, they would pay up to the value of that

42:15.200 --> 42:16.500
 money in order to earn it.

42:16.500 --> 42:21.300
 And for people who are not familiar, the process of mining is solving

42:21.300 --> 42:25.000
 a difficult cryptographic problem that's a computational problem.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.600
 I would say it's not like people sometimes represent it as like

42:28.600 --> 42:30.000
 a really challenging puzzle.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.600
 Like the individual puzzle is very simple.

42:32.600 --> 42:35.400
 Like you can do it with pen and paper if you wanted, you know,

42:35.400 --> 42:36.600
 like SHA256.

42:36.600 --> 42:40.100
 It's just that you're searching through the big mathematical

42:40.100 --> 42:42.300
 space to find the needle in the haystack.

42:42.300 --> 42:45.900
 You're just doing lots of iterations of a simple puzzle.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.100
 It's just brute force.

42:47.100 --> 42:50.700
 Hence, like the stability of the whole idea of the proof of work.

42:50.700 --> 42:55.100
 If there was a shortcut, it wouldn't work.

42:55.100 --> 42:56.100
 Exactly.

42:56.100 --> 42:59.700
 So let's hope nobody solves SHA256.

42:59.700 --> 43:03.300
 Yeah, there's a lot of discussions from the quantum computing

43:03.300 --> 43:08.400
 space, but everybody I talked to, all my colleagues that work in

43:08.400 --> 43:13.800
 quantum computers say that we're quite a long way away from that

43:13.800 --> 43:18.700
 being an issue in cryptography and certainly an issue in cryptocurrency.

43:18.700 --> 43:22.200
 That should have been one of the sides on these dice.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.100
 It should have been quantum because I don't think it is.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.600
 I forgot to put it on this edition.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.900
 People should check out Scott Aaronson.

43:28.900 --> 43:36.000
 There's a lot of people that are kind of selling quantum snake

43:36.000 --> 43:38.700
 oil, so you should be very careful.

43:38.700 --> 43:43.100
 I think it is a really exciting space that might change the

43:43.100 --> 43:49.000
 world in the next decade or hundred, couple hundred years, especially

43:49.000 --> 43:53.400
 for simulating quantum mechanical systems, but in quantum machine

43:53.400 --> 43:56.300
 learning, people should check out TensorFlow quantum.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.900
 It's a nice way to sort of educate yourself about the space.

43:59.900 --> 44:05.100
 And actually, if you're pragmatically minded to, you know, through

44:05.100 --> 44:09.200
 software engineering, explore how you simulate quantum circuits, how

44:09.200 --> 44:11.000
 you run machine learning on those quantum circuits.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.600
 The main point that Scott makes, Scott Aaronson, people should check

44:15.600 --> 44:21.100
 out his blog too, is that like, there's not yet a single machine

44:21.100 --> 44:25.800
 learning application that doesn't do almost as well in a classical

44:25.800 --> 44:31.100
 computer. So it doesn't like, yes, the dream is somehow quantum

44:31.100 --> 44:35.600
 computers will change the nature of artificial intelligence, but

44:35.600 --> 44:42.900
 there's yet to be an actual algorithm or problem set or data set

44:42.900 --> 44:44.400
 where that would be the case.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.600
 So skepticism is good in this space.

44:47.600 --> 44:53.100
 Anyway, that said, so you kind of explained how Bitcoin works.

44:53.100 --> 44:58.400
 You also wrote a blog post recently, giving a shout out to the

44:58.400 --> 45:00.500
 new book, The Block Size Wars.

45:00.500 --> 45:03.500
 What is a block size?

45:03.500 --> 45:05.800
 What are the block size wars?

45:05.800 --> 45:10.900
 It's history, it's importance, it's philosophical foundations.

45:10.900 --> 45:15.300
 Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin, at this point, we have our own civil wars,

45:15.300 --> 45:19.000
 if you're wondering about how politically intense it gets.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.200
 It's currently not hot, it's cold.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.400
 Oh yeah, we're in a detente right now.

45:23.400 --> 45:28.600
 There's no tanks or missiles, at least not yet, hopefully.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.000
 It can get a little violent, I guess.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
 I think one of the Bitcoin core developers or one of the participants

45:35.000 --> 45:37.500
 in the war got swatted at one point.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.000
 What swatted means?

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
 When someone does a fake phone call saying that you're holding

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
 someone hostage at your house and the SWAT team goes,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
 it's pretty scary.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
 Internet warfare tactic, yeah.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
 But the block size war, I would say, effectively ended, although

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
 we're definitely going to have more civil wars in Bitcoin, for sure.

46:00.000 --> 46:05.500
 But basically, the core argument was a technical one on its surface,

46:05.500 --> 46:09.000
 but a very deep political one at its core.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
 The technical question is, how many megabytes should be

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
 in each successive block?

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
 So, Satoshi basically installed a limit of one megabyte per block.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
 So, we should backtrack.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.500
 There was no limit in the beginning, and it seems like Satoshi,

46:26.500 --> 46:32.000
 what is this, 2000, the war started in what, 2017 or something like that?

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
 I don't know.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
 2015 was when the battle cries began.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
 What was the first battle in the Civil War?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
 I don't remember.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
 But, Satoshi, I don't know if you can comment on it.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
 Why did Satoshi set the limit to one megabyte all of a sudden,

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
 almost secretively, and in the beginning, there was no limit whatsoever?

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
 Yeah, I mean, we can get into, and people have spent thousands of hours

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
 poring over Satoshi's writings to find which side Satoshi was on,

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
 and you can find, like any textual exegesis, you can find evidence

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
 for either side, right?

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
 But, yeah, I mean, effectively, when Bitcoin was launched,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
 there was a block size, because if you made a block over a certain size

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
 with the first edition of the code, it would have crashed nodes.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
 But then, yeah, in 2010, Satoshi added the one megabyte limit

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
 in a covert way with no comments or anything, and that stuck, basically.

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
 And then Bitcoin blocks filled up, and people that had been socialized

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
 into this vision of Bitcoin as an effectively free transactional network

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
 were like, why pay a transaction fee if you're not at congestion?

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
 If the block isn't full, the miner will mine your transaction for free, right?

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
 And people that had been brought up in that status quo from 2009

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
 to kind of 2015, they noticed the block started to fill up,

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
 and they're like, okay, well, let's just remove this arbitrary limit, right?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
 What could possibly be the harm?

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
 And then a whole other faction said, no, you need to cap the data

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
 throughput of the system, because if you increase it,

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
 it's going to be highly exclusionary, and ultimately, regular folks

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
 are not going to be able to run a full node.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
 So there's a fixed number, there's a fixed frequency of blocks,

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
 and so if you want to increase the number of transactions per second,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
 you want to increase the size of the block.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
 So huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot of transactions.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
 Small blocks don't, so that's what you mean like constraining the system.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
 So what's the benefit of a small block size where transactions,

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
 you can squeeze in only a small number of transactions,

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
 and what's the benefit of a huge block size where you can squeeze in

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
 a lot of transactions?

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
 Well, it really comes down to the way that you think about the system.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
 So a lot of people wanted Bitcoin to be Visa scale,

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
 so to have blocks sufficiently large that you could accommodate

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
 a Visa level scale of transactions.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
 Which is many orders of magnitude more transactions.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
 That's right, I mean, preposterously larger in terms of data throughput.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
 Then, you know, Bitcoin offers up, or at least it used to,

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
 144 megabytes of space per day, and your average transaction is 350 bytes.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
 So, you know, you could, at a push, do four or five hundred thousand

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
 transactions a day, which is not many.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
 So if you wanted to get to Visa scale, you'd have to increase blocks

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
 obnoxiously large.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
 The small blockers claimed that this would overwhelm the ability

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
 of any regular person to ingest that data and stay current

49:49.000 --> 49:54.000
 at the state of the ledger, to replay all those transactions

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
 to ensure that the protocol rules were valid.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
 So basically, the small blocker contention is that you eliminate

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
 the trustlessness of the system by pushing a ton of data

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
 through the system, because only one or two industrial heavy duty

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
 nodes would ever be able to run the protocol at that point.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
 So, by the way, in the Civil War, the two sides, as you're calling them,

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
 the small blocker and the big blocker sides.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
 And so that takes us back to the thing that you mentioned,

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
 that a regular computer could be a node.

50:30.000 --> 50:36.000
 And with big blocks, that's no longer going to be the case.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
 So just the number of transactions is going to blow up the size

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
 of the blockchain that every full node has to store.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
 And so then, as opposed to a regular mom and pop type of node,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
 you're going to have to have data centers.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
 So they're going to have to be owned by large organizations.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
 There's going to have to be very few of them.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
 And that's how you centralize the control over this whole operation.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
 So the big blocker, yes, it allows you to be Visa

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
 and do a huge number of transactions, but it becomes centralized.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
 And then the small blocker is, you cannot actually do kind of

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
 merchant style transactions, but you get the decentralized benefit.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
 Well, I don't even think the big blocker approach would allow you

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
 to be Visa, frankly, because there's effectively one node

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
 in the Visa network, right?

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
 So you don't really need to maintain this peer to peer architecture at all.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
 And the amount of data you'd have to push through the network

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
 to reach Visa scale is a really preposterous amount.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
 And we have now evidence for what happens when you try and scale up

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
 as a blockchain and do 10 million transactions a day,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
 which is still not Visa scale, right?

51:51.000 --> 51:58.000
 I've seen what it's like to operate those nodes, and it's not pretty.

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
 So there are totally genuine computer science physical limits,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
 because it's a broadcast network.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
 Everyone has to be aware of every transaction.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
 And that model, which gives you the trustlessness, the nice guarantees

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
 where everyone's an equal peer on the network, everyone has audited

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
 the full history of the transactions, that model falls apart under stress.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
 So the small blocker vision is that ultimately you would scale

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
 in a layered approach, with the base layer transactions

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
 being settlement style transactions, and payments happening

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
 at the other layers, basically.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
 Is that universally agreed upon, or to a large degree agreed upon

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
 that the small blockers have won in this debate?

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
 Where would you put the current state of affairs?

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
 There was a wave of competing Bitcoin implementations,

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
 starting in 2015 with Bitcoin XT.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
 Actually Gavin Andresen, who was the guy that Satoshi handed the reins to

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
 when Satoshi left, Gavin supported this large block proposal.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
 And so that didn't achieve consensus, and then there was Bitcoin Unlimited.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
 And then later on, there was a genuine hard fork,

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
 where the large blockers couldn't push through their proposals

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
 on Bitcoin itself, so they just created a competing version of Bitcoin.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
 So by the way, maybe you can comment on, but sort of hard fork

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
 versus a soft fork, a hard fork is when it's no longer compatible.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
 What's the right way to put it?

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
 They can't operate on the same blockchain, with the same protocol.

53:41.000 --> 53:47.000
 Yeah, so there's a few ways to define them, and it gets controversial as well.

53:47.000 --> 53:54.000
 One way to define it as a hard fork is an expansion of protocol rules,

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
 and a soft fork is a shrinking of protocol rules.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
 That's an interesting way to find it.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
 It's not very intuitive, so I don't like that way.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
 Another way is that a hard fork is backwards incompatible,

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
 whereas a soft fork is, in theory, backwards compatible.

54:09.000 --> 54:15.000
 So in August 2017, basically the large blockers had had enough,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
 and they said, we're going to hard fork Bitcoin,

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
 we're going to create a clone, an alternative version of Bitcoin,

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
 which has a shared history as Bitcoin itself,

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
 but you completely fork it and you create a new future.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
 But everybody that had a balance on Bitcoin at the time

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
 also had a balance on the alternative coin, Bitcoin Cash.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
 That's what it's called, Bitcoin Cash is the hard fork.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
 That was one of them, there were more actually.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
 What the heck is Bitcoin Satoshi's vision BSV, Bitcoin SV?

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
 So this is all talking about increasing the max,

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
 the limit of the block size more and more and more.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
 Yeah, that was one of the changes they wanted to push through.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
 But BSV was a fork of Bitcoin Cash.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
 Hard fork of Bitcoin Cash.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
 Yeah, so now there's multiple big blocker blockchains floating around.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
 What are your thoughts about them?

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
 These are pretty popular, sorry to interrupt.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
 Are they popular?

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
 I mean, if you look at the metrics, they're not.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
 And they don't trade,

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
 I think each trade below 1% of the value of Bitcoin itself.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
 I see, so measuring popularity is like how much they actually,

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
 oh, value of the frequency of trade.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
 Oh, no, no, I mean, they do like a fair number of transactions,

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
 but there's no way to know that that is genuine or just contrived.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
 So ultimately, the true measure I think in my mind is just where the market

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
 prices these protocols relative to Bitcoin,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
 because that's like a prediction market.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
 If Bitcoin Cash was being priced at 50% of Bitcoin,

55:52.000 --> 55:58.000
 you could say the market has given it a 50% chance of unseating Bitcoin, right?

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
 But both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV,

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
 which was a hard fork from Bitcoin Cash itself,

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
 are well, I believe at this point, well below 1% of the value of Bitcoin.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
 And in like the ranking of different cryptocurrencies,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
 what is it, Bitcoin, Ethereum?

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
 Is Ethereum in value second?

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
 Yes, number two.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
 And then Bitcoin Cash is in the top five, right?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
 But it's just a fast drop off?

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
 You know, I haven't checked lately, but I think it's reached kind of morbidity.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
 You know, it doesn't really have much traction.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
 The blocks aren't full.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
 So the whole value proposition was, you know,

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
 we will get all this merchant adoption if we increase the block size.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
 That just didn't materialize.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
 In my view, they had a flawed vision of how adoption works

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
 and what blockchain should optimize for.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
 Maybe you get a Bitcoin Cash supporter on the show,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
 they'll give you a different answer.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
 But yeah, full disclosure, you know, I have my sympathies.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
 And I think the small blockers won that skirmish for sure.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
 So at this time, there's no merchant adoption and so on.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.000
 So it's kind of its vision, the whole reason for existence,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
 at least for now, hasn't materialized.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
 And so that's an indication as possible that, well,

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
 it's a sign that perhaps that's the wrong way to accomplish the scalability.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
 Well, you know, first of all,

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
 I think the layered scaling model is definitely, definitely correct.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
 I mean, that's absolutely the way these things have to work,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
 given the constraints of blockchains.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
 What is the layered scaling model?

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
 It's really how all payment systems scale, blockchain or otherwise.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
 And I think a lot of people don't understand this,

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
 is that there is no equivalent to scaling of the base layer

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
 in the regular payment space.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
 That totally doesn't happen.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
 All of them are built on layers.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
 So Visa is like the fifth layer in the payment stack

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
 that ultimately depends on these utility scale settlement systems,

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
 like Fedwire, CHIPS, ACH, basically interbank settlement systems.

58:01.000 --> 58:07.000
 So you've got these slow moving but high assurance settlement systems.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
 Fedwire is probably the number one, you know, like when you send a wire,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
 that's using the Fedwire system typically.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
 On top of that, you know, you have banks and then you have payment processors,

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
 and then you build up these layers and layers and layers,

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
 and then you have these fast payments, you know, Venmo PayPal,

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
 credit, debit, Visa, you name it.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
 Those payments are not final when they occur.

58:30.000 --> 58:36.000
 You know, a credit card transaction will not be final for 90 to 120 days.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
 So you've decoupled the payment, the financial message, and the settlement.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
 Those are distinct concepts.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
 And the settlement happens on a deferred basis.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
 So that's how you get scalability, is you have lots and lots of messages,

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
 but they don't settle for a long time.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
 They might settle on a net basis, on an end of day basis.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
 But so that's really how it works.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
 And then you have Fedwire where your average transaction is in the millions of dollars,

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
 and there's only a few hundred thousand transactions a day.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
 It's sort of an interbank settlement network.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
 So that's my vision for how I think Bitcoin will develop too.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
 Bitcoin itself on the base layer is the slow moving high assurance final settlement network,

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
 where if you're sending money to the other side of the globe to someone you don't trust,

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
 where you want that payment to be final in a short period of time,

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
 and both counterparties know it's final, then you would use that.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
 But if you wanted to buy coffee, you could do it on a second layer.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
 Lightning would be one way.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
 There's a bunch of side chains now.

59:41.000 --> 59:46.000
 Or you could use a more centralized solution if you wanted.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
 It's kind of a profound idea that in the space of transactions,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
 when you're buying coffee or buying anything really from a merchant

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
 or exchanging goods and all those kinds of things,

59:57.000 --> 1:00:04.000
 that most of the time, like basic honest behavior, human behavior,

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:09.000
 which it does appear that most of our societies is based on the fact that we're all,

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:15.000
 most of us are honest, is like stuff is not going to go wrong when you do the transaction.

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:19.000
 And you only need like the base layer, whether it's Bitcoin,

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:24.000
 whether it's, I forget the terms you use for the credit card version,

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:33.000
 but you need that just to verify, just to like resolve any disagreements or shady shit.

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.000
 Yeah.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000
 And that's a really rare occurrence.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:43.000
 So it's okay for that to be handled in a small block debate,

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:48.000
 handled at a rate that's much, much lower than the rate of the transactions.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:52.000
 That's a really interesting idea that when we spend money,

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.000
 we didn't actually exchange the money most of the time.

1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.000
 Yeah, most of the time you're not getting final settlement when you do a transaction.

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:08.000
 And oftentimes that causes, there's pluses and minuses on the plus side of huge efficiency

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.000
 if you use a credit network like Visa, but it's in the name credit, right?

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000
 Visa is extending you credit, right?

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000
 They're kind of guaranteeing your reputation to the merchant.

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000
 But fraud happens all the time, right?

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:25.000
 There's always fraud because you have this reversibility, right?

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:30.000
 And so you can engage in fraud against the merchant.

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000
 If you have a final settlement, there's no possibility for fraud.

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000
 So that's one reason merchants kind of like accepting Bitcoin

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:44.000
 because once you receive an inbound Bitcoin payment and you deliver some good or service,

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000
 that payment can't be reversed.

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000
 But frankly, most of the transactions we undertake on a daily basis

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:56.000
 do not require the strong assurances of final settlement.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000
 There's one exception, which is physical cash.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.000
 With physical cash or the open dime, a cash like product,

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.000
 you actually are getting final settlement.

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:14.000
 But most online banking transactions, most P2P digital wallet transactions

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000
 in the dollar system, they're not really final at all.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.000
 You mentioned Lightning, Lightning Network.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000
 What is it? What are your thoughts on it?

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.000
 And what are your thoughts about any kind of alternatives?

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:34.000
 So Lightning is one potential payment solution built on top of Bitcoin

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000
 where you have different assurances, different transactional assurances,

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000
 but ultimately it's very proximate to the base layer.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000
 So if something goes wrong, you can always basically settle to the base layer.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000
 Just layer two.

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000
 Yeah, layer two, you could say.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000
 And basically the intuition is it's kind of like opening a bar tab.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:57.000
 So you go to the bar and you might drink a dozen beers over the course of the night,

1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000
 maybe half a dozen.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000
 And well, I guess nobody goes to the bar these days,

1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000
 but let's say you did.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.000
 You open a tab and at the end of the night you settle up once.

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.000
 You're not necessarily paying each time you get another beer.

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.000
 So it's the same idea.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.000
 You're opening a channel, an ongoing relationship with your counterparty.

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000
 And so Lightning has you open a channel with the counterparty

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000
 and you're sort of sending back and forth these cryptographic commitments saying,

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000
 you know, I agree to send you some Bitcoin,

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000
 but you don't necessarily settle each time you make a transaction.

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:35.000
 So you can do hundreds of thousands of transactions in a channel.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000
 The other thing Lightning proposes is saying, okay, well,

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:41.000
 now that we have channels established,

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.000
 what if we interlocked a number of channels together?

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000
 So if you and I have a channel and, you know, me and my buddy have a channel,

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000
 my buddy can now pay you because you have a relationship through me basically.

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000
 And so Lightning is this network, this overlay network that sits on top of Bitcoin

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.000
 and allows people to transact in a much faster and less frictional way

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:08.000
 without the need for Bitcoin's kind of slow periodic settlement,

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000
 assuming that everything sort of goes well.

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000
 Do you see any downsides to this?

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000
 Like, have you seen flaws in the whole system from a security perspective,

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000
 from a scaling perspective, any of that?

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000
 Or is Lightning working well?

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000
 It works.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000
 I use it.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000
 When I initially sold those dice, I sold them on Lightning.

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000
 I was one of the first merchants to use Lightning back in the day,

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000
 the first edition of the dice.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000
 So people could buy these dice somewhere?

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000
 Well, they used to be able to.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000
 I haven't made a new edition recently.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000
 They're very scarce and very special.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000
 They're like physical NFTs.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000
 Physical NFTs.

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000
 Yeah.

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000
 I mean, the flaw with Lightning is really that you, you know,

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000
 and this can be remedied in a number of ways,

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000
 but you have to kind of prefund these channels.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:59.000
 So it's a weird concept to have to inject liquidity into a channel

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000
 in order to accept a payment, you know.

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.000
 So I'm sure those user experience problems can be solved,

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:10.000
 but it's still in a state of relative immaturity.

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.000
 So we'll see.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:18.000
 In terms of other ideas that are sidechains or soft forks of Bitcoin,

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.000
 you've mentioned something about Schnorr and Taproot.

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000
 What are your thoughts about this update to Bitcoin

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:30.000
 in terms of its promise to improve privacy and scaling and so on?

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.000
 And what other things are you interested, excited about

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000
 in terms of the development of Bitcoin?

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000
 Well, Schnorr and Taproot,

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:43.000
 that's the first new protocol upgrade since SegWit in 2017,

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.000
 which was what laid the groundwork for Lightning to be developed, basically.

1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000
 Schnorr and Taproot is really the first protocol change

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.000
 in three, almost four years now.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:00.000
 So we're very excited about it.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.000
 I mean, is there something interesting to say technically

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:06.000
 about what are the things it's actually going to improve?

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:10.000
 And maybe on the politics side,

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:15.000
 bringing a protocol change on Bitcoin,

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:17.000
 what does that actually involve?

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.000
 Yeah, I mean, it's a huge deal because the last time

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000
 we tried to make a change to the protocol,

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000
 we had a whole civil war over it,

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:28.000
 and it was incredibly difficult to get SegWit activated in 2017.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000
 And it took all this brinksmanship and threats

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000
 and all these campaigns, and it was this whole thing.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000
 Luckily, I think things have quieted down

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000
 and there's much more consensus that Schnorr and Taproot

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000
 is a good change to Bitcoin, and everyone generally supports it.

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000
 But everyone kind of has PTSD over the last time.

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000
 When we tried to change Bitcoin.

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000
 And so we're sort of really dithering

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000
 over how we actually want to implement it.

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:56.000
 So it's taking forever because we're trying to set the protocol

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000
 for how do you change Bitcoin itself.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000
 And all of our assumptions went out the window last time.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:05.000
 So we're trying to reset and decide what is a legitimate way

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000
 to institute a change to Bitcoin.

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000
 So that's actually the big question right now.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000
 It's not, should we implement these changes?

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000
 We basically all agree that we should.

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000
 It's a meta question is, what's the valid way

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000
 to implement new changes to Bitcoin?

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000
 What's a way that is scalable in the long term

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000
 and will last and people will consider credible?

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000
 Even if this one isn't controversial at all.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000
 So that's where we're at.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.000
 We're basically debating over how do we implement this change

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000
 that we all want.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000
 To get a feeling of how slow Bitcoin governance is

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000
 and how deliberate it is,

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000
 everybody collectively wants the change.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.000
 But we haven't fully agreed on how we're going to put it into Bitcoin.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000
 So it's a classic sort of Bitcoin situation.

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000
 But what it is, I mean, Schnorr is an alternative signature scheme.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000
 I think it was encumbered by a patent.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000
 And it had only just been unencumbered

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000
 when Satoshi created Bitcoin, I believe.

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.000
 It's a better signature scheme than Elliptic Curves,

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000
 which is what, than ECDSA, which is what Bitcoin uses.

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.000
 And so it's been long enough that we now trust it.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000
 Kind of in cryptography, it's meant to be Lindy.

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.000
 You want to test it over time,

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000
 and then it's considered safe to use.

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000
 So Schnorr has been around for long enough

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.000
 that we've decided to rip out ECDSA and insert Schnorr,

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000
 which is just a different signature scheme,

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000
 which is more efficient.

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000
 And it has better properties.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000
 Like if you want to do a multi signature transaction

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000
 where many people collectively sign

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000
 in order to permission a spend,

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.000
 that would be more efficient in a bytes sense

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000
 than ECDSA, for instance.

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000
 So it's pretty incremental.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:53.000
 And then Taproot is all about having transactional conditions

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:58.000
 that are sort of withheld from final entry onto the blockchain.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:07.000
 So it's kind of a way to have more private conditional transactions on Bitcoin.

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:11.000
 So both of them, I would say, are incremental changes.

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000
 Is this an over exaggeration that Schnorr and Taproot

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000
 might improve privacy and scaling,

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.000
 which is like at the high level things that people mention?

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000
 Is that just like a dramatic way of trying to frame

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000
 what's fundamentally an incremental improvement?

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000
 Yes, but incremental is the word, right?

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000
 We're not going to get an order of magnitude enhancement

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000
 to either privacy or scaling,

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000
 but we will get a considerable enhancement.

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000
 But privacy and scaling are actually two sides of the same coin

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000
 because you get more transactional privacy

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000
 by removing data from the ledger

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000
 so that there's less metadata for people to surveil and analyze.

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000
 And that's also how you scale

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.000
 by compressing and being really space efficient with transactions.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000
 And the more parsimonious you are,

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:04.000
 the more economically dense each byte that everyone has to retain on the ledger is.

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:09.000
 And so those are very closely allied concepts.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:16.000
 So do you mind if we go through some potential criticisms of Bitcoin?

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:22.000
 Totally. I spent the last five years tackling these every day.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000
 Are the dice the same?

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000
 Those two are the same, yeah. There are three editions.

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.000
 So let's go with the dice.

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000
 Silk Road. What does that mean?

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000
 Silk Road. Classic. Classic situation.

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000
 So that was the darknet marketplace set up by Ross Albrecht

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000
 in the early days of Bitcoin.

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000
 That's one of the first killer apps for Bitcoin

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:50.000
 was being the payments network behind this darknet marketplace

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000
 where you'd go to buy drugs and things.

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000
 And so that became associated with Bitcoin,

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000
 if you remember the press coverage from back then.

1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000
 But over time that faded and it became less of a critique.

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:06.000
 So like the critique is that Bitcoin is something you would use

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000
 for illegal activity, for drugs, for crimes, all those kinds of things,

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:15.000
 as opposed to for any kind of legitimate transactions and merchant transactions.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:18.000
 And today Bitcoin settles $10 billion a day

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000
 and the vast, vast majority of it is completely legitimate.

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000
 It's just a useful alternative system.

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000
 But back then a huge fraction of all Bitcoin transactions

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000
 were related to the basically illicit marketplaces.

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000
 And if you're just tuning in, this incredible tall sighted guy

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:41.000
 has 11 common criticisms of Bitcoin that Nick,

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000
 in a genius way, has put together.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000
 Maybe you could do a couple more.

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000
 It was Satoshi something, Satoshi Coins.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000
 Satoshi Coins, we touched on that earlier in the episode.

1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.000
 What if Satoshi returns and sells all of their coins?

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.000
 So we don't know for sure how many coins Satoshi actually mined or produced

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:10.000
 because there's a degree of probabilistic analysis that you would do.

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:17.000
 There's a few thousand blocks that were mined by what we think is a single entity

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000
 in sort of 2009.

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000
 And so if you add them all up, you get to about a million.

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.000
 So people think that Satoshi mined a million coins

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.000
 and then they're worried that Satoshi would return

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:33.000
 and market sell all the coins, thus crushing the price of Bitcoin.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:39.000
 So looking at some of these, no CEO, I think we touched on that.

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000
 We did, we see, we've already hit on the dice.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000
 No merchants, that's no longer true.

1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000
 There's a scalability one, and I think that one has addressed

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000
 the idea that you're mentioning with the block size debates

1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000
 and the lightning network that by adding extra layers on top,

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000
 you can achieve scalability.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000
 That's my vision, that's my theory.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000
 And you can do it in a permissionless and a permissioned way.

1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000
 Like Coinbase is a big Bitcoin exchange.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000
 They provide scalability.

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000
 They're a financial institution.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000
 You can settle up internally on their own database

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:22.000
 and then periodically settle to Bitcoin.

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000
 So they do something like the lightning network internally,

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000
 something like this similar kind of mechanism.

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000
 Well, honestly, I'm not sure exactly how it works.

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:34.000
 They might have that built in, but just generally speaking,

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000
 institutional scaling is a model for scaling, right?

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000
 Where you could have banks holding Bitcoin

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000
 and they issue notes against Bitcoin,

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000
 and those are your payments,

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000
 and then the base layer is the settlement layer.

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.000
 I think that's what you're getting with the boiling oceans,

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.000
 is this is like the impact on weather,

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000
 I suppose, on the environment.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000
 So, you know, that is a concern that people have

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000
 in terms of like the proof of work requires

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.000
 that there's a lot of computational resources being used

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000
 and that requires a lot of energy

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000
 and like some large percentage of the world's energy

1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000
 is used to mine Bitcoin.

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.000
 How would you respond to that criticism?

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:21.000
 Yeah, I mean, that's been the loudest critique of Bitcoin

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:22.000
 this year in the press.

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000
 This year, really?

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000
 Yeah, so, I mean, it's not like a new criticism,

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000
 but Bitcoin is consuming more energy than ever.

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.000
 So, as the price rises, the electricity consumption rises,

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:40.000
 and so we've heard renewed, you know, bellyaching over this,

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000
 for sure.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000
 I mean, if you don't believe that Bitcoin is useful,

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000
 then you're inclined to think that all the energy consumption

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000
 is a waste.

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000
 So that's, you know, it's something that's sort of unrebuttable

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.000
 if you fundamentally contest the validity of the Bitcoin system.

1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:04.000
 So if Bitcoin is like a thing that will take over,

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000
 it will become like the main mechanism of financial transactions

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.000
 or transactions period in the world, then you say,

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:15.000
 well, the cost of energy use is actually quite low

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000
 relative to the benefit it provides.

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000
 If you think it's not going to be,

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:25.000
 if it's just a volatile way to make a little money in the short term,

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000
 then you see the energy use as really wasteful.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000
 That's totally spurious, yeah.

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000
 So then there's no really response, I suppose.

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000
 That's, so I can totally, you know, get into the details

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000
 of Bitcoin's energy mix and things like that,

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000
 but that's like at a high level what the debate is.

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000
 It's this normative question, like, does Bitcoin have an entitlement

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000
 to consume any of the world's resources?

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:52.000
 And that's actually where the debate should end much of the time

1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:57.000
 because a lot of people fundamentally dispute the validity

1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:00.000
 or usefulness of Bitcoin as a system.

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:04.000
 And so, of course, they're going to consider the energy usage illegitimate.

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.000
 Now, there's a lot of mitigating factors if you, you know,

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.000
 think the Bitcoin is potentially a useful system,

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:15.000
 which is Bitcoin consumes energy in a very peculiar way,

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:18.000
 which virtually no other industry does,

1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:25.000
 which is that Bitcoin is a geography independent buyer of energy,

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000
 which is not how we humans typically consume energy.

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.000
 Like, we need energy to be produced near to population centers,

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:36.000
 and we need it to be produced at the, you know,

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.000
 corresponding to the peaks and troughs of our consumption, right?

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:44.000
 Because we have to 100% match the demand and the supply at all times, right?

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:46.000
 Otherwise, we'd blackouts.

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:50.000
 So, Bitcoin doesn't care about any of that.

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.000
 It just buys energy on a constant basis.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:57.000
 And so, it's, you know, indifferent to where it's being produced.

1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:02.000
 And so, the consequence of all that is that Bitcoin will buy energy

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.000
 that's otherwise being wasted, basically.

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000
 So, it will buy so called stranded energy assets

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000
 that would not make it to a population center.

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:16.000
 And in fact, most energy produced is, ultimately,

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:21.000
 does not sort of make it to, you know, your socket in your wall.

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.000
 And so, this is why so much Bitcoin is mined in China, for instance.

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.000
 It's not because, you know, Chinese industrialists had a special affinity for Bitcoin.

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:36.000
 It's because the Chinese grid had a massive overabundance of energy,

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.000
 and particularly in four provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia,

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000
 and Xinjiang.

1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:45.000
 So, in those four provinces, those are all pretty distant

1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000
 from major population centers.

1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.000
 So, because of that, you can't really transport the energy that easily.

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.000
 And so, huge amounts of energy are curtailed

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000
 or basically wasted in all those provinces.

1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000
 And so, miners set up shop there

1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:02.000
 because they could mine Bitcoin with the excess energy.

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.000
 They could monetize this thing that otherwise was going to go to waste.

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:11.000
 So, you know, there's things like that which, you know, I think mitigate the reality.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.000
 Bitcoin is not really rival with our consumption of electricity.

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000
 It's not depriving anyone of electricity.

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:24.000
 It's mostly these stranded assets that are going into supporting the Bitcoin network.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000
 So, maybe let's do a last one since you mentioned China.

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000
 This is China control.

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000
 So, if so much mining is happening in China,

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:39.000
 how do we prevent nation states from controlling much of Bitcoin?

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:44.000
 Yeah, that's the flip side of a large portion of the blocks being mined in China

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000
 due to this energy feature which I discussed,

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000
 which is that there's a lot of Chinese miners for sure.

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000
 Now, the question ultimately is,

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000
 what degree of control do miners have over the Bitcoin system?

1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:01.000
 And that was part of the block size debate.

1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:06.000
 I mean, the miners, when we implemented subgraded witness in 2017,

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.000
 the miners just didn't want to do it.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:15.000
 Eventually, the users, the regular folks running nodes rebelled and basically said,

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000
 look, we're going to implement this whether or not you do it.

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000
 And it was a threat to the value of Bitcoin because if this threat had gone through,

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:25.000
 it could have split Bitcoin and it would have been really messy.

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000
 So, the miners sort of capitulated.

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:34.000
 So, I think the current consensus is that miners do not have unilateral control over Bitcoin

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:39.000
 and that governance is more poised between people that run nodes, developers and miners.

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:44.000
 It's sort of a triumvirate where neither of them has, you know, total control.

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.000
 So, that's my current model for controlling Bitcoin.

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000
 I think if you asked a miner, they would tell you they didn't feel

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.000
 that they had sort of unilateral control over Bitcoin either.

1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:03.000
 Almost as a thought experiment, can I ask you to think about if some of your predictions,

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:09.000
 some of your analysis, some of your understanding of Bitcoin is wrong in the following sense

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:16.000
 where it will not have the impact that you have a vision for it,

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:21.000
 that you will not have the scale of impact and perhaps in terms of value will go to zero

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000
 to something very low and other cryptocurrency or other financial systems will overtake it.

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000
 What would be the reason for that in your mind?

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:32.000
 Like, why might you be wrong?

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:41.000
 If you look back at it in the future, what did you not understand about Bitcoin that will result in that?

1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:43.000
 Yeah, that's a great question.

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:48.000
 I think for that to happen, one of two things would have to obtain,

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:53.000
 one of two things would have to happen for Bitcoin to just be irrelevant basically.

1:20:53.000 --> 1:21:01.000
 Either central banks totally clean up their act and stop engaging in rampant money printing,

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000
 which I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:09.000
 I mean, it looks like we're normalizing this new regime of inflation, pro inflation,

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:12.000
 just to remediate the debt issues we have.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:18.000
 So that would be one thing that would make Bitcoin cryptocurrency much less relevant

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:25.000
 as if everyone becomes totally assured of the soundness of sovereign currencies basically,

1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:29.000
 namely the dollar, like the dollar being the main one.

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.000
 It seems like we're going in completely opposite direction.

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.000
 Most people seem to be noticing the stirrings of inflation in society.

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000
 You might have noticed that too.

1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:45.000
 It's showing up in commodity prices, lumber prices, in food, obviously in financial assets.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.000
 It'll show up in consumer prices generally soon.

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:53.000
 So that would be one way for Bitcoin to basically become irrelevant

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000
 because it's a dialectical thing.

1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:02.000
 Bitcoin is held in opposition to the established monetary regime.

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:09.000
 So if they completely reform themselves and the dollar becomes super sound once again

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:18.000
 and the Fed stops tinkering the way they constantly do, then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as much.

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:28.000
 The other thing would be if a completely superior design for a new sort of state independent monetary system emerged.

1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.000
 But it's really hard to even imagine how that would come to emerge.

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:42.000
 And there's good reasons to think that Bitcoin, the conditions of its launch were extremely favorable and hard to replicate.

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:50.000
 Can you speak to some of those conditions, why it's a unique timing wise moment for Bitcoin to emerge?

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:58.000
 Yeah. So obviously Bitcoin was born in the depths of the financial crisis, which gives it a nice historical element.

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000
 But that was kind of a coincidence.

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:07.000
 Honestly, we know that Satoshi had been working on it earlier in 2017.

1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:12.000
 The really special thing about Bitcoin was that it was launched anonymously

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:19.000
 by an entity that did not seek any glory or credit for what they did and apparently never monetized it at all.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:23.000
 So they never really moved any of their coins.

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:29.000
 Satoshi sent one test transaction to Hal Finney, who is one of the earliest Bitcoiners.

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.000
 Aside from that, as far as we know, Satoshi never spent any of their coins.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:39.000
 So you have this wonderful Promethean quality whereby it's almost self sacrificial.

1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:48.000
 I mean, it's like this borderline godlike figure in terms of their restraint finds this monetary technology

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000
 and releases it to the world and pays the price.

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.000
 They never took advantage of their filthy lucre.

1:23:53.000 --> 1:24:00.000
 They never recognized any of the $50 billion that they made from Bitcoin.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:06.000
 And Satoshi also didn't assign themselves any privileged access to the coins.

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:11.000
 Satoshi could have just written in the code, I own 10% of the coins.

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:15.000
 But they didn't. They just mined in the open free market competition like everyone else.

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:21.000
 It's just that Satoshi is an early miner to support the network, accumulate a lot of coins for sure.

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000
 But they didn't have any privileged special access.

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:29.000
 So that's one thing that's extremely special about the launch is that we had a founder

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:36.000
 that was truly committed to the monetary protocol and didn't seek either recognition or financial spoils.

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:42.000
 And then also left. Satoshi left in 2010, 2011 and hasn't really been heard from since.

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:49.000
 It's a very George Washington gangster move where he didn't want power and once he got power, he let go of it.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.000
 Precisely.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:58.000
 That was a key actually move. That was probably one of the most important moves at the founding of this country.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.000
 That's right. George Washington could have been a king, probably if he'd wanted.

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.000
 And Satoshi could have been Jerome Powell if he'd wanted.

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.000
 And Satoshi could have held on to power indefinitely but chose to leave.

1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:23.000
 The other thing is that Bitcoin circulated for a long period of time from January 2009 to about July 2010 without really having a financial value.

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.000
 So there weren't really any marketplaces. It didn't have a value.

1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:33.000
 And so that gave it this really great distribution among a broad set of stakeholders.

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:40.000
 And there were no venture funds or hedge funds trying to aggressively buy up all the supply back then.

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:50.000
 Now when you have new cryptocurrencies launched, they're aggressively pre mined and some gigantic Silicon Valley venture fund is going to own 30% of it.

1:25:50.000 --> 1:26:02.000
 And so it's impossible to conceive of how that could become a global money because how could a Silicon Valley investment firm own 30% of the money supply?

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:07.000
 That doesn't make sense. That's just so oligarchical. It's unbelievable.

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:19.000
 So Bitcoin by contract is a very bottom up thing. It was the early enthusiasts, people that were really excited about the technology.

1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:22.000
 They're the ones that obtained those early coins.

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:30.000
 And so there was a real element of fairness and just an organic nature to its launch, which would be incredibly hard to recapture today.

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:37.000
 Let's say Satoshi came back and they said, OK, I made Bitcoin 2.0. I'm going to release it.

1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:48.000
 There would be the most aggressive land grab ever by gigantic pools of capital to sort of get favorable allocations of the new system.

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:58.000
 Can Satoshi with Bitcoin 2.0 build in a resistance mechanism or a prevention mechanism for the land grab?

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:07.000
 It would be hard to because if you have capital and resources, I mean, if it was a proof of work chain, you just have people that would invest a ton of money in mining, for instance.

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:16.000
 But most new blockchains, cryptocurrencies are just sold, basically. They're issued in token offerings kind of thing.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:22.000
 So it's hard to enforce through the protocol the decentralization of control power.

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:29.000
 It'd be challenging to and people have tried to do airdrops where they distribute coins to a large number of people.

1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:36.000
 Basically doesn't work. Most people don't care about the airdrop. So it's hard to have an equitable distribution.

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:43.000
 I think the conditions of Bitcoin's launch were so lucky and favorable that they're very unlikely to be replicated.

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:55.000
 So I do think it's going to be a real challenge to ever have a new competitor that's as decentralized, as leaderless, as dispersed, sort of distributed as Bitcoin is, has its credibility.

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.000
 I don't know how you could overrule it on those important features.

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:06.000
 What about Bitcoin's comparison to other current cryptocurrencies? So Bitcoin versus Ethereum, for example.

1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:12.000
 Why is it possible that Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin?

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:15.000
 It's certainly possible. Yeah, I'm not ruling it out.

1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:26.000
 Ethereum leadership is sort of wise enough to understand that they shouldn't compete with Bitcoin on those most profound qualities.

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:33.000
 Ethereum doesn't really aspire to be more sound from a monetary perspective than Bitcoin.

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:37.000
 In fact, the Ethereum leadership are sort of constantly tweaking the monetary policy.

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000
 So they went for a completely different trade off.

1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:47.000
 They also don't compete to be as decentralized from a governance perspective, right?

1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:52.000
 Because there's leadership. There's an ETH foundation. There's a charismatic leader, Vitalik.

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:59.000
 And Ethereum has this policy of hard forks. So in Bitcoin, hard forks are extremely rare.

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.000
 In Ethereum, it's the default way to change things.

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.000
 So it's a much more adaptive system and it changes more frequently.

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:11.000
 But that also means that it's sort of they're incurring more risk when they introduce those changes.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:23.000
 There's much more complexity. So Ethereum is smart because they sort of understood Bitcoin as the top dog when it comes to a sound money, a digital gold type thing.

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:29.000
 And they went for all of the different trade offs. They wanted to be more of a platform.

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.000
 They wanted to have more complexity of the transactional layer.

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:38.000
 They wanted to take on more risk in terms of changing the protocol. They wanted to change more quickly.

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:46.000
 They wanted to make the monetary policy more mutable. So Ethereum takes that completely different tack.

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:51.000
 Of course, you know, I'm not ruling out that it could take over Bitcoin from a market cap perspective.

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000
 It's just a very different system.

1:29:53.000 --> 1:30:03.000
 And I tend to think that Bitcoin is the most disruptive one because it's the most equipped to challenge sovereign currencies in the grand scheme.

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:18.000
 Do you think they can coexist? So like in the future, do you see a world where, you know, Ethereum captures some large percent of the market but nevertheless the minority?

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000
 A hundred percent.

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:28.000
 Bitcoin has already been tokenized and put onto Ethereum. Many units of Bitcoin, I think over a billion dollars worth.

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:43.000
 So not only do they coexist, they are actually mutualistic. So they're like two creatures that have this, you know, it's like the rhino and like the bird that packs the parasites off the rhino's back or whatever.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.000
 Yeah. Right. So I don't know which is which in the analogy.

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:51.000
 But yeah, I don't know who the parasites are.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:31:02.000
 Or, you know, the alligator and the teeth cleaning fish or whatever. Right. So, you know, I always wonder why the alligator doesn't just eat the fish, but I guess they're brushing its teeth basically.

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:14.000
 So Ethereum is it gives you more transactional flexibility. There's much more experimentation happening there. It has this whole decentralized finance element.

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:22.000
 There's a huge number of Bitcoins that circulate on the Ethereum protocol, right? Because Ethereum is open to other asset types, basically.

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:34.000
 So I think that's actually accretive to both systems because Ethereum gets to have this good form of collateral Bitcoin on the system, which is good volatility characteristics.

1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:48.000
 And then it's a supply sink for Bitcoins, which are sort of now they're injected into this third party protocol. And that, I think, reduces the velocity of Bitcoin overall, and it's probably good for the valuation.

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:53.000
 So you see it quite possibly could be a symbiotic relationship. That's really interesting.

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:55.000
 I think so. I think so.

1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:07.000
 What are your thoughts about Vitalik, Buterin? What are your thoughts about some of the other figures in the space outside of Bitcoin?

1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:15.000
 I think Vitalik made some mistakes with Ethereum ultimately. Like, I disagree with some of the decisions that were made along the way.

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:29.000
 Like, there's this infamous case of this bailout where 14% of Ether was lost in the smart contract, or really this smart contract that a lot of Ethereum leadership were sort of backing and supporting was hacked.

1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:39.000
 And then the foundation with Vitalik's support chose to make a change to the underlying protocol to undo the hack, right?

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:56.000
 So to me, that was not the most prudent approach, because you're basically violating the core protocol rules in order to undo, you know, to bail out a specific contract, which has failed.

1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:05.000
 Granted, there was a lot of Ether in there. But I think that shook the credibility of the Ethereum system that happened back in 2016, I think.

1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:09.000
 That was one reason why I became disenchanted with Ethereum.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:22.000
 So basically, even if in that case that might fix an important problem that opens the door to centralized, like, manipulation of the protocol in the future.

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:42.000
 Yeah, it basically demonstrates that there's certain elites at the protocol level that can exercise specific control over the system. And, you know, a lot of people have lost money in hacks on Ethereum, a lot of contracts have gone south, huge amount of value, but they didn't get a bailout.

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:53.000
 And it was just when, you know, this specific contract called the DAO was hacked, that, you know, the leadership intervened.

1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:04.000
 And, you know, to their credit, they haven't had a significant intervention or bailout since then. But it did normalize the practice. And I think it weakened the social contract.

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:12.000
 So I would prefer that you sort of bite the bullet in that situation, and you accept the failure of that contract.

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:15.000
 There'll be a ballsy move to bite that bullet.

1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.000
 Yeah, I mean, and then you would have had like, what they thought was a malicious entity in control of a lot of coins.

1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:34.000
 I think the real reason they sort of felt that they had to undo it was because they'd always planned to move to this proof of stake world, where your political control over the system is a function of your wealth in the system.

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:46.000
 And they didn't want this attacker, which would have inherited all this significant wealth, to have influence over that future proof of stake version. That's sort of my theory.

1:34:46.000 --> 1:35:01.000
 Yeah, I mean, that makes sense. It kind of reminds me of the bailout of car companies. You know, this is difficult. There's a lot of people that criticize the bailout of these large companies, you know.

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:19.000
 Yeah, creative destruction. I mean, I was critical of the bailouts that happened during COVID. I mean, I generally think that it's healthier for society for bad firms that aren't making money to fail or be reorganized under the various forms of bankruptcy.

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:32.000
 And you saw what happens. You see the, you know, the corporate sector in Japan in the 90s, there was this like slow motion insolvency where basically firms weren't allowed to fail.

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:44.000
 And the Japanese corporate sector lost competitiveness because bad firms did not fail. And so, you know, the process of actual capitalism for the market clearing didn't occur.

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:53.000
 So I'm always in support of, you know, of the free market being allowed to clear for non profitable firms to fail.

1:35:53.000 --> 1:36:10.000
 It's complicated, man, because creative destruction seems to be in the long term a positive. But human civilization is such that short term pain has real impact on people, you know.

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:19.000
 Yeah, policymakers don't ever want to incur that short term pain because they have a short term outlook and term limits often.

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:29.000
 And also just it's short term pain. Forget policymakers, forget politicians. It sucks to lose a job for an individual.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:41.000
 You know, you could say the company, you know, creative destruction of a company means the company was inefficient and that's going to have a ripple effect of teaching everybody else what an efficient operation looks like.

1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:46.000
 But like there's jobs that are being lost. There's families that have to suffer because of that.

1:36:46.000 --> 1:37:01.000
 I mean, that's the tension we live in society is having a basic safety net for our world because there's a level beyond which, like if through creative destruction,

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:08.000
 you have some percent of the population that dips below a certain level that you would call like suffering.

1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:21.000
 We don't want that. And that's a difficult thing to live with. Like, yes, in the long term, you want inefficiency to be destroyed and efficiency to be rewarded.

1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:29.000
 But there does seem to be a base level of like quality of life that we want to uphold. That's a difficult thing to think about.

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:41.000
 I think about that a lot. There's a doctor called Paul Farmer that, you know, there's like in Haiti or in Africa, there's a child who's dying.

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:52.000
 And as a doctor, you want to give everything you have, all the money you have to save that one child. And you do, actually.

1:37:52.000 --> 1:38:07.000
 But that's a very human action. It's not a rational action from a game theoretic perspective because there's no way you can take that action for every child who is suffering.

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:16.000
 But there's something deeply human about doing that for that one particular child. In that same sense, creative destruction is an economic principle.

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:23.000
 But it's not necessarily that same kind of human principle. And there's a tension there.

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:34.000
 I see it. I mean, I think that's the issue with modern central banking, really, is that the central bank always has an incentive to lower interest rates.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:52.000
 And they've been doing that from the 70s towards today on this, you know, well, 80s, really, on this slow march down. Because whenever there was a hint of a crisis in the economy or financial asset prices started to fall, their reaction is, okay, we'll inject more capital into the economy, we'll save it.

1:38:52.000 --> 1:39:11.000
 But my view is that these palliative short term measures cause the buildup of a huge amount of fragility in the long term. And then the ultimate collapse is much worse than the counterfactual situation where you raised interest rates, you took your medicine, and the economy was healthier.

1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:34.000
 So and that's sort of, that's why, you know, people like Ray Dalio point out that you have these long term debt cycles. And we're sort of at the end of one now, is because we couldn't take our medicine, we couldn't, you know, let interest rates clear, we constantly wanted to ward off any difficulty, and we didn't ever want to de leverage truly.

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:41.000
 And then when the when the debt crisis happens, and it hits, it's, you know, horrendously bad.

1:39:41.000 --> 1:40:03.000
 So do you think Bitcoin might reach a million dollars in value? It's, it's having a current resurgence, a crazy one in 2021, in the recent months of over 60,000, I guess it is now. Do you think it's possible it goes over 100,000? Do you think it's possible it goes to a million?

1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:15.000
 You can't rule anything out with Bitcoin. So I mean, I'm not, you know, wanting to put price targets on it. But one way it could reach a million dollars is Bitcoin's value stays unchanged in real terms.

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:44.000
 And the dollar depreciates. Not that I expect hyperinflation. But yeah, I mean, like Bitcoin is worth about one 10th, slightly under one 10th the value of all the gold in the world. And, you know, gold is worth 10 trillion, 11 trillion dollars in the aggregate. Do I think Bitcoin can be more culturally and economically salient than gold in two decades time? 100%. Bitcoin was unknown.

1:40:44.000 --> 1:41:07.000
 12 years ago, and today 100 million people worldwide own Bitcoin. So just extrapolate that what is the level of penetration you think we'll get 500 million a billion? You know, you can easily tune these adoption curves, however you like. I don't think it's done, you know, monetizing and being adopted globally.

1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:29.000
 You think it can become like the base layer for a lot of our financial operation, like become the main base layer for all our transactions. So like, even banks will use Bitcoin, essentially, and like Visa would use Bitcoin as the base layer, like it would actually operate very similarly at the surface layer, but at the base layer would all be Bitcoin.

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:58.000
 That's precisely what I expect. And banks and Visa are already using Bitcoin. So Visa has embraced Bitcoin in a really big way, actually. And it's always funny to the people saying Bitcoin has to change in a certain way so it can compete with Visa. No, Visa adopted Bitcoin, right? PayPal adopted Bitcoin, Square adopted Bitcoin. Obviously, they're not tearing out all of their existing infrastructure, but they're totally engaging with this thing.

1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:23.000
 Banks have now begun, they got the green light to provide custody for Bitcoin for their depositors. That's the first step. Eventually, you know, it'll happen one of two ways, either Bitcoin native financial institutions will become banks, that's already happening. There's Bitcoin exchanges that have gotten banking licenses, or banks themselves will start to engage with Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:45.000
 It'll converge either way. That's totally happening. And yes, I mean, I don't think Bitcoin is going to power every financial transaction, I think it'll coexist alongside sovereign currencies. But I think it's a great reserve asset. It's a very powerful asset to build a financial system on top of because it's highly, highly auditable.

1:42:45.000 --> 1:43:07.000
 It's something that you can take physical delivery of very cheaply. And those are great qualities. If you're a depositor in a bank, they can prove to you how much Bitcoin they have. They can't really easily prove, you know, in the old system, how much gold they held on deposit. And you can easily conduct a run on the bank, you can hold them accountable, because you can withdraw it.

1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:30.000
 Because, you know, making Bitcoin transaction is pretty easy at the end of the day. Unlike fiat currency, it's like kind of, you can't really withdraw your dollars from the bank. I mean, you sort of can, but you're not going to want to take delivery of pounds of cash or anything like that. So it's a good modern asset upon which to build a financial system, basically.

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:54.000
 You mentioned Square and Visa sort of investing in Bitcoin. What do you make of probably one of the higher profile big investments in Bitcoin, which is Tesla and Elon Musk? But there's also a few billionaires like Chamath and all of them investing. What do you make of this whole movement? Why do you think they're doing it? I mean, Tesla is an interesting case. Why do you think Tesla is buying so much Bitcoin?

1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:11.000
 I honestly don't know. And I would love to truly know Elon's genuine thoughts on Bitcoin. Because he's kind of sending us mixed messages, honestly, with his embrace of Dogecoin, which is sort of playful, not exactly sure what point he's trying to make there.

1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:36.000
 So you were involved with Dogecoin, you mentioned offline a little bit in the early days, or at least played around with it. What do you make of Dogecoin? What do you make of Elon and Doge? What do you make of this particular meme coin? Is it one, like a legitimate cryptocurrency? Or is it two, like a funny internet way of saying F you to the man?

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:58.000
 Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, so I wasn't like a figurehead in Dogecoin or anything. But that was totally my introduction to crypto was mining Dogecoin in my dorm room. And then tipping people online in Dogecoin, which I just thought was the funniest thing. So I guess that was really easy to entertain back in 2013.

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:15.000
 But it was very playful at the time, there was a culture around Dogecoin. And the people liked it, because it was in opposition to the Bitcoin culture, which was really serious and involved lots of Austrian economics, and Rothbard and Hayek and stuff like that.

1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:35.000
 So that was my introduction to cryptocurrency was because I thought the Bitcoin people were pretty lame. Yeah. And they were like, way too serious about all this stuff. And I was like, okay, I'll just be a part of the Dogecoin community. And they did all these funny publicity stunts, like, they paid to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics.

1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:55.000
 You know, like, great stuff. Like they put the Dogecoin logo on top of a NASCAR car. Yeah. And I just that tickled me so much because it's like this made up internet coin. This was back when crypto is pretty novel and still like kind of funny and stuff. And that was really entertaining. Fast forward seven, eight years.

1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:10.000
 Dogecoin is way less entertaining now, frankly, because it's the leadership left the community spirit evaporated. The meme didn't persist. I mean, Doge itself is not really a contemporary meme, right? I mean, it's an old meme.

1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:30.000
 Although that new refresh of the meme, like Doge, I haven't heard that name in a long time. Like, or Doge is like in a hat smoking a cigarette. I mean, there's some sense where Elon is reinvigorating the meme. And it's funny, because like one influential figure could do just that, which just speaks to the tension that you're talking about.

1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:47.000
 Like Tesla is investing Bitcoin. And yet, Elon, he also tweets about Bitcoin. But yeah, he's, I mean, who am I to question the meme, right? Like, yeah, I can't, you know, dissect internet culture and penantically sit here and tell you it's an invalid meme.

1:46:47.000 --> 1:47:16.000
 You know, if people believe in it, then it's real. Is there a space for meme coins at this time? Like Doge or somebody else to almost like, you know, it does serve a lot of purposes, which is, like you said, it pulls in people into this whole space of digital currency, into cryptocurrency, allow them to explore, allow them to have fun as opposed to taking everything very seriously.

1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000
 Is there still space for that?

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:46.000
 Yeah, yeah. And I mean, the crypto landscape is very broad today. So whatever, you know, cultural element you seek to find within crypto, you will find. It was a bit different in 2013, because Bitcoin was kind of the only game in town, there were a couple altcoins. And so Dogecoin made a lot of sense as a counterpart to Bitcoin as a less serious counterpart. Today, crypto is just like gigantic cultural and economic trend.

1:47:46.000 --> 1:48:04.000
 So it's, you know, very multifaceted. Dogecoin is one of the many, you know, ways that people have to engage with it. I think a lot of people that buy Dogecoin based on Elon's implied guidance are going to lose money, because fundamentally, there's nothing enduring about Dogecoin.

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:31.000
 It's an ancient fork of Bitcoin. It's unmaintained. There, you know, it's probably at risk, actually, from a protocol perspective. It's merge mined with Litecoin, I think. If there was an inflation bug on Dogecoin, it's unclear who would sort of be able to remediate that, you know, so it's not technologically very sound. So I wouldn't recommend that anyone stores wealth in it, you know.

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:56.000
 Yes, it's funny because cryptocurrency, like my interest in cryptocurrency is in the exploration of technical ideas. But cryptocurrency is also, like in the case of Dogecoin, like for LOLs, at least originally, like a meme coin, but it's also a mechanism for investment.

1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:20.000
 And so those are sometimes a tension. And it's unclear, sort of like, yeah, you know, there's the meme with Doge has almost become to take it to, I guess, to a dollar, trying to drive the price of the value up to a dollar. But, you know, implied in that is like this overlap of the meme coin and like legitimate investment.

1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:42.000
 And so you have a lot of young people, I think, who almost start getting greedy and want to make money, like as opposed to having fun. And that becomes a different beast then because you're essentially making financial decisions that can have a long lasting, like, you know, money is freedom.

1:49:42.000 --> 1:50:03.000
 And if you make stupid financial decisions, you can remove freedom from your life. And that's, it can be detrimental in that sense. So I don't, it's difficult. I don't know what to do with that set of ideas because a lot of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, is very volatile because it's new.

1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:30.000
 So you're trying to figure out the space of like, what's actually going to be a large part of, like you speak of network effects, like what's going to take over the world. And through that process, there's going to be a lot of volatility. And if you're talking about cryptocurrency as an investment mechanism, then it can have a real detrimental effects on people's lives.

1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:53.000
 Yeah. And that's really the challenge with operating in the crypto space, talking about it, overlaid on top of everything that's interesting politically or culturally about it is the financial incentive. And so, you know, it's not all fun and games because there are literally billions over a trillion dollars at stake now.

1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:22.000
 So if you buy Dogecoin, because some influencer on TikTok said so, you've now made a financial decision, right? So I'm not going to scold any Dogecoin buyers or any crypto asset buyer for that matter. But be aware that there are like billions of dollars of really elite hedge funds that are trying to front run all of your decisions and evaluate social sentiment, things like that. So it's a waterfall of sharks, basically.

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:36.000
 And by the way, if you're listening to this, don't take this podcast or anything I ever say as financial advice. That's definitely not my interest or expertise level. The interest here is to explore different ideas.

1:51:36.000 --> 1:52:02.000
 Speaking of which, you've written a little bit about NFTs. I'd be interested to hear your opinions on this space of ideas, these non fungible tokens. They seem to have a cultural impact currently, but do they have a long lasting technical, financial or cultural impact or is this just a fad? What do you think of NFTs?

1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:30.000
 Yeah, I think the current enthusiasm for NFTs and the financial metrics, you see the growth there in that sector is partially a function of where we are in the actual credit cycle. So oftentimes, when inflationary events occur, you have correspondence speculative manias that occur at the same time, because people intuitively feel that the fiat currency that they hold is being debased.

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:53.000
 And so they frantically look around for other places to put it. So stocks, property, commodities, and then other asset classes, NFTs are an asset class. And this is a case with any inflation you look at in history, you saw these correspondence speculative manias, basically, speculative episodes.

1:52:53.000 --> 1:53:22.000
 So a lot of us feel that inflation is occurring, whether it's in CPI or not, that basically lots of dollars are being injected into the economy. We've all seen stocks massively appreciate even as GDP contracted. And so a lot of people sort of got caught on to this notion that, wow, is the Fed, you know, lowers interest rates, and Congress spends a huge amount of stimulus dollars into the economy, financial assets going to go up, so I better have exposure to all that stuff.

1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:46.000
 And so you see, virtually every asset class is awash with cash right now, people are investing like their lives depend on it, investing, trading, whatever, whether it's options, volumes, on Robin Hood, you know, like kind of retail brokerages, things like that, whether it's stocks, whether it's crypto, and then other collectibles, baseball cards, their valuations have been skyrocketing.

1:53:46.000 --> 1:54:07.000
 And so I think NFTs are part of that. It's a new asset class. It's basically an opportunity to invest in sort of art or collectibles, in game items, things like that. I think that explains a large degree of the enthusiasm, the excitement is that it's a novel asset class that people can trade.

1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:29.000
 And right as you know, these inflationary tailwinds pick up. Now as for the sort of virtues of the actual technical phenomenon, NFTs are actually not a new idea at all. So you've had NFTs, I didn't call them NFTs, but in 2016, built on Bitcoin, for instance, so it's been around for a while.

1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:45.000
 What it is, is a serial code, basically a string of data that is inserted onto a public blockchain, and then circulates as a unique token. And then the question is, okay, well, what does that data refer to? What's the external reference?

1:54:45.000 --> 1:55:00.000
 And that has to be defined, there has to be some entity which says, oh, yeah, this unique string refers to like this piece of art or digital content, or, you know, trading card or whatever. So NFT, the concept itself is like an incredibly broad idea.

1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:12.000
 It's just, well, what if we took, you know, barcodes, and put them on chain so that they could be traded. And so they could circulate freely on a peer to peer basis and plugged into exchanges and things like that.

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:25.000
 So that concept is super valid, clearly has protocol market fit, right? People are using it for a really wide array of purposes, it's completely going to exist.

1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:48.000
 May the valuations contract of NFTs in the aggregate? Definitely possible, probably likely. But I think the notion of creating enduring collectibles or artworks that have accompanying signatures, basically autographed art on the blockchain, that has totally been validated.

1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000
 I think that won't go away.

1:55:50.000 --> 1:56:07.000
 I wonder if there's ideas, like BitCloud, for example, I don't know if you saw that, if there's ideas built on top of this concept, it doesn't have to be like Ethereum NFTs, it could be just the concept of non fungible tokens, whether those kinds of things can take hold.

1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:33.000
 And they, it's less about financial transactions, and more about almost like, I don't know how to put it, but like staking identity in some way, whether it's BitCloud or identity of objects, like there might be some way of connecting physical reality and digital reality in some interesting ways.

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:56.000
 So just the financial aspect is a way to put some validity behind the identity. I wonder if there's ideas there that are yet to be discovered, or ideas that are yet to take hold. Like BitCloud seems interesting, seems shady as hell, seems a little scammy.

1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:01.000
 I don't know if I like the idea that you can bet on people, essentially.

1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:09.000
 Yeah, I think my market cap on BitCloud is like $90,000, and I haven't done anything there, so.

1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000
 Did you take, did you like take, like verify yourself or whatever?

1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.000
 I have not. I think people would yell at me on Twitter if I did, so.

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:22.000
 And it's unclear whether it's a scam yet or not, right? It's unclear where it's coming from.

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:36.000
 Well, there is some details about the, you know, investors. It's backed by some pretty big name investors, so I probably wouldn't use the word scam to describe it, but it's got Ponzi like dynamics, like everything in crypto.

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:58.000
 So there's very questionable, and then also is it using people's likeness without their permission, which is, I think, a legal question, you know, so there's open questions around it. But, you know, is our public blockchains and, you know, that sort of architecture, is that going to be useful for decentralized or alternative forms of social media?

1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:19.000
 100% yes. You know, I'm super, super bullish on that idea. Basically, creating open protocols, open namespaces, ways to organize without the dependence on a single node effectively in Silicon Valley, you know, the Twitter node or the Facebook node.

1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:32.000
 I think it's a matter of urgency that we create, you know, digital gathering spaces where you have strong property rights, you know, you have a claim on your identity, you have a claim on your data. And open architecture is our way to do that.

1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:46.000
 I don't know if it'll be a blockchain, but certainly I think the general, you know, concept introduced by blockchains is a good template for how to, you know, organize these systems.

1:58:46.000 --> 1:59:09.000
 Yeah, value freedom, value decentralization of power, whatever the mechanism. Let me ask you about love. So there is a Bitcoin maximalist community that sometimes, so those folks in general have a strong belief that Bitcoin is good for the world.

1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:25.000
 And it's almost an ethical imperative to sort of help Bitcoin succeed, which I think as a member of any community, I think is beautiful to believe in the vision of the community.

1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:26.000
 Right.

1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:50.000
 There does seem to be some properties of what some may call like toxicity or derision and mockery and those kinds of things. You know, some folks have criticized this, right, that Bitcoin maximalism is not necessarily good for the world, even if Bitcoin is good for the world.

1:59:50.000 --> 2:00:05.000
 What are your thoughts about this kind of approach philosophically or practically to the spread of Bitcoin? And is there a way that we can add more love to the world while we add more Bitcoin to the world?

2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:30.000
 That's a great question. I mean, you know, Bitcoin is sort of what you make of it. So you can define your own path as you advocate for Bitcoin or don't for that matter. So my chosen approach is the approach you see here, which I try to minimize the amount of sort of harshness or mockery, although I've been known to be mean on Twitter too, you know.

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:57.000
 Well, Twitter is a specific, sorry to interrupt, is a specific medium where this takes its worst form. So I'm learning, listen, I'm actually because of this podcast, but in general, I'm part of different communities. And some are full of like unabashed love. And some are like, what I experienced on Twitter, the Bitcoin community at first, I was off put in terms of the intensity, the mockery.

2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:58.000
 I bet.

2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:19.000
 The layers of lol, like the layers of not taking anything seriously. And I think there's power to that. There's freedom to that. I appreciate it. I have respect for it. But it's not my thing on Twitter. It's just not the way I enjoy communicating on Twitter.

2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:46.000
 I retired from Twitter. I hit 100,000 followers and then I retired. So I'm free now. I don't have to tweet anymore. It's great. But I totally can see the point. I wish that Bitcoiners were gentler in their approach. Not all Bitcoiners are like that. Of course, there's, you know, 50 to 100 million of them worldwide, and a few 10s of 1000s on Twitter. So I'm not going to claim that they're necessarily representative.

2:01:46.000 --> 2:02:04.000
 The toxicity, though, is kind of a learned habit, because Bitcoin has had so many episodes where strong willed institutions, billionaires, the dice are pretty toxic, you could say, right? I'm basically mocking critics of Bitcoin.

2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:12.000
 But at the same time, you're saying that the criticism has been predictable and repeatable, and it's been the same throughout.

2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:41.000
 Yeah, and that's a pretty dismissive thing to say, right? That I can reduce you to an algorithm with 11 permutations. But the thing to remember, I guess, is that some of the best funded companies in the Bitcoin space, the most powerful miners, billionaires have tried to change and coopt and alter Bitcoin to shape it to their liking.

2:02:41.000 --> 2:03:00.000
 And without these incredibly hardcore sort of high priests of the Bitcoin protocol, it would have been hopeless, hopelessly malleated in all number of ways. And so there is a reason why someone would be incredibly protective of Bitcoin.

2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:19.000
 Does that justify immense toxicity on social media? Probably not. But it's a leaderless protocol. So the whole point is that it's money for enemies. And, you know, some of the Bitcoin maximalists came for me too, when I made suggestions that they didn't like.

2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:33.000
 But, you know, I'm happy to use it, the protocol, because I know that that transaction will be final, regardless of how odious my counterparty is, or how, you know, politically disfavored their opinions are.

2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:58.000
 See, I mean, and this is where there could be disagreements, but I think you have to think about what's effective as a defense mechanism of strong ideas. And I personally think that, like, kindness and thoughtfulness is much more effective because it lets the idea shine.

2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:07.000
 As opposed to the personality of the individual humans overriding it. But there's debates on this, you know.

2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:18.000
 I mean, I take your side on that. I think a patient and careful approach is the way to go. Now, do all critics deserve good faith engagement? No, I would say.

2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:30.000
 A lot of critics of Bitcoin operate in extreme bad faith. And the reason why is because we're not just talking about technical questions. In fact, most of this conversation has not been technical, it's been political.

2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:49.000
 Because Bitcoin is an intensely political idea. And so a lot of people are predisposed to totally hate it, and to wish, you know, death on Bitcoiners. I mean, there's a professor at GW, I saw earlier this week, that was musing about getting all the Bitcoiners on a boat and sinking it.

2:04:49.000 --> 2:05:04.000
 Like, in what other context would a, you know, upstanding professor muse about mass murder? But in the context of Bitcoin, it's sort of okay, you know, within his peers, because you're talking about something that most people don't like.

2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:21.000
 You know, it's a concept that's alien to them, that doesn't jive with the way they see the world. And so because it's so, you know, pitched from a political perspective, there's a lot of critics, as well as defenders that operate in bad faith, I would say.

2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:29.000
 But that's the nature of the beast. It's because we're proposing a very disruptive thing. And there are people that would be disrupted by it.

2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:48.000
 You wrote a blog post titled On Writing. You're, I think, an excellent writer. So let me ask, what does it take to be a good writer? What does it take to write some of the blog posts you've written?

2:05:48.000 --> 2:06:00.000
 Sort of condense set of ideas in your head, the mess that's probably in your head and putting down on paper in a way that communicates the idea clearly and powerfully.

2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:25.000
 So that was basically the point of the blog post is that being an impressive writer is different from being an effective writer. You know, so I think the answer to your question is humility, basically. So I think if you let pride and vanity seep into your writing, then you risk creating a very noisy signal.

2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:44.000
 You know, creating a very inefficient channel for communicating literal neural arrangements from your brain to someone else's brain. And that's what I think about when I write is like, wow, I have the power to, at scale, change the literal physical composition of people's brains, right, to rewire them.

2:06:44.000 --> 2:07:07.000
 If I make an idea that's so persuasive, that's so sticky, if I coin a phrase that is so pithy, then I can alter their brain. That's crazy. I mean, you're letting someone reach into your head and like, mess with it a little bit. That's unbelievable. And that's like a superpower. And if you could do that to 100,000 people at once, how powerful is that, right?

2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:14.000
 You mentioned Descartes, I think, therefore I am. That's like literally rewired millions of brains throughout history.

2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:38.000
 I mean, that's one of the most powerful, like, cogito urgo sum, one of the most powerful phrases ever written. And that sent a zillion philosophy undergraduates down a rabbit hole of skepticism that some of them didn't make it out of, you know? And they're convinced that, you know, the brain in the vat theory is true, and there's no way to know, you know, what our tangible experiences.

2:07:38.000 --> 2:08:07.000
 But yeah, so that's the beauty of writing. And the thing that interferes with that is our pride, our desire to, you know, impress people and, you know, look good to them and show off our vocab and stuff. And that was the point of that piece is that I went on this journey where I eventually realized that I don't know if I'm any better of a writer for having realized it, but I think that is a necessary condition.

2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:19.000
 So does that mean there's a value to striving for simplicity in the words, as opposed to, I mean, complexity?

2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:30.000
 I think so, for sure. And we deal with complex topics all the time in crypto. And that's always a huge red flag for me. I mean, if you can't explain something simply, do you understand it, you know?

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:31.000
 Yeah.

2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:53.000
 So if you're talking about something that complex, if you can't find simple ways to discuss it, my presumption is that you're actually obfuscating the truth. And this is what Orwell railed against with political language. You know, he really hated political language, because he felt that its authors were using deliberate obfuscation.

2:08:53.000 --> 2:09:08.000
 And, you know, he hated euphemisms. And I hate euphemisms, too. You know, I much prefer, you know, forthrightness and clarity of thought. But most people when they write, don't really endeavor to be particularly clear.

2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:29.000
 They might be writing to show off their startup, or, you know, to demonstrate to people how cool they are, or how well read they are, you know, they're displaying, it's like a peacock style display. What fraction of people write to actually communicate meaning? Small fraction.

2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:42.000
 It's especially difficult because what I've detected is something in us humans as readers assign more credibility to people that obfuscate.

2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:59.000
 So, like, simple, clear communication of an idea is not, like, the immediate reaction is not one where we assign credibility to the person. Like, that was brilliant.

2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:13.000
 There's a lot of people that I kind of listened to without really understanding what the heck they're talking about, but it sounds musical and smart. And then I see a lot of folks assigning credibility to that person.

2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:37.000
 And it's unfortunate. It's unfortunate that there's that tension as a reader, that we appreciate the beauty and power of, like, complex weaving of words without assigning as much value to, like, actual clear communication of an idea.

2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:54.000
 And I'm always skeptical in speech as well. When someone will describe someone as articulate, I'm always immediately skeptical of the value of what that person is saying. Because if you articulate, you can make bad ideas sound very acceptable and great.

2:10:54.000 --> 2:11:08.000
 And Noam Chomsky has said this before, as a way to defend the way he speaks. He said that, like, he's suspicious of charismatic people because they can basically sell any kind of idea.

2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:17.000
 He speaks in a very monotone and boring way so that whatever the value his ideas have, they'll shine through. There's something to that.

2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:28.000
 I love that. But it's a difficult journey. It's a difficult path because then, I think it's the right path because ultimately you focus on the quality of your ideas and in the long term that wins.

2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000
 I agree.

2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:47.000
 Just by way of advice, is there, if people are interested in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, in your work, what are good books or resources on Bitcoin from you and from others that you can recommend that in your own journey helped you or you've seen help others?

2:11:47.000 --> 2:12:05.000
 Well, it's very easy. It's much easier today to make the Bitcoin journey because the quality of content is so much better than it was when I started. I mean, when I learned about Bitcoin, there was the Bitcoin Wiki and the Bitcoin Stack Exchange and the subreddit and that was kind of it.

2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:13.000
 And you had to just pick up everything. The economic theory hadn't really been worked out very much. So you had to pick everything up from scratch.

2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:22.000
 The good news is that there's a huge abundance of content. And that's actually one of Bitcoin's greatest strengths is that people are totally inspired to write about it.

2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:33.000
 And it's almost a rite of passage at this point if you're like a Bitcoin thinker to have your book. I don't have a book yet. I would love to recommend my book. I haven't written one.

2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:34.000
 Do you think about writing a book?

2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:45.000
 Yeah, I think it's my duty. 100%. Everyone that has created a lot of Bitcoin content probably should condense it into a book to give it an enduring status.

2:12:45.000 --> 2:13:08.000
 It's interesting because you mentioned block size wars and you've written on a lot of different topics. So you could both write like a big like sapient style book about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, right? But you can also write a book on each like a specific thing.

2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:23.000
 And now that you put pressure on yourself and talk about simplicity, right? Where do you lean on those different book journeys that you might take on? Do you have in you eventually like a Bitcoin book?

2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:44.000
 I mean, I tallied up the words that I wrote in the last couple years on Bitcoin. It's like over 100,000 words a year. So that's two novels there. But yeah, I think I do. I think there's so much underexplored space in Bitcoin. I mean, a systematic interpretation of Satoshi's writings, for instance.

2:13:44.000 --> 2:14:00.000
 And a lot of people don't want anyone to do that because they don't want it to have these religious overtones where you're engaging in interpretation. But that's something that should be done. There's a lot of Bitcoin histories that haven't been written.

2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:20.000
 There was a great Bitcoin history recently published that's this is one of my recommendations is on the block size war by Jonathan beer, who runs probably the best research desk in the industry. So there's huge amounts of history that has transpired that hasn't been chronicled.

2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:37.000
 And some of the accounts are indifferent. You know, they're often written by outsiders, you know, journalists that maybe don't fully engage with the Bitcoin system. But if you think the humans are interesting in the story to, of course, they're the most interesting thing.

2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:52.000
 You know, I mean, Bitcoin itself doesn't really change that much. It's kind of this cold, you know, protocol that just sort of takes along with the characters are just fascinating. I mean, and there's so many unbelievable characters in the Bitcoin story. Unbelievable.

2:14:52.000 --> 2:15:09.000
 Yeah, that's the cool thing about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and just internet is like the weirdos, the brilliant weirdos, like, all the people in in the stuff that's already established are boring. Like economics professors are all boring, right?

2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:22.000
 But the interesting people, the wild ones are, are the ones that are innovating on in the crypto space, which is, you know, that's where the dangerous weirdos are, and the exciting, brilliant weirdos.

2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:42.000
 Well, you had to be kind of crazy to adopt Bitcoin in the first sort of five years of its life. So there's an adverse selection element there. I don't know if that's an uncharitable way to put it, but like, some of Bitcoin's earliest evangelists are not the evangelists I would have chosen, but they're the ones that we got.

2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:52.000
 It's the one we got. But is there is there resources? You're basically saying, just throw a dart. And most books are going to be good? Or is there something that stands out to you?

2:15:52.000 --> 2:16:17.000
 I mean, your average book is, you know, terrible, for sure. But not on Bitcoin, specifically, but just in general. It depends whether you like the computer science, the economics, or the history. But my recommendations would be, you know, obviously, the Bitcoin white paper, that's, and Satoshi's complimentary writings, that's very important is to try and understand the intentions behind the system.

2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:35.000
 And also to understand the system without having your view colored by some third party's description of it. Most descriptions of Bitcoin are really bad. So just go to the originals, go to the Hal Finney's post, Satoshi's post on Bitcoin talk, there's a huge amount of lucidity there.

2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:44.000
 And actually, most of our questions about Bitcoin today that we have a decade later were really answered in those earliest days. People just don't know it.

2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:54.000
 The canonical economic work relating to Bitcoin, a lot of people don't like it. I think it's fine, would be the Bitcoin standard.

2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:57.000
 A lot of people don't like it. I just read it. It's good. I like it.

2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:15.000
 I think it's a good description of sort of the Austrian perspective, and then how it relates to Bitcoin. There isn't that much about Bitcoin in there. But I think the point is, once you've understood, you know, Saifedean's view of monetary policy, Bitcoin makes a ton of sense, you don't actually need to argue for it that much.

2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:35.000
 So the Bitcoin standard is a good introduction to sort of the orthodox thought in Bitcoin. There's a more recent book called Layered Money, which I liked by Nick Bhatia, which goes into more depth about what I was talking about early in the conversation, the layered approach to scaling.

2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:46.000
 And that's a really critical thing to understand. Then technical books about Bitcoin. I like Grokking Bitcoin, which is a very computer science heavy one.

2:17:46.000 --> 2:18:02.000
 There's a good textbook called Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies by Arvind Narayan. I think he's a Princeton computer science professor, which is really good at building intuition.

2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:14.000
 Antonopoulos's books, Mastering Bitcoin are good. Then there's like simpler intuition building books that aren't hardcore on the economics or the protocol design.

2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:25.000
 So you have like Inventing Bitcoin by Jan Pritzker, which is good. You have Bitcoin Clarity by Kiara Bakkers. As you can tell, I have like a, my bookshelf is like mostly Bitcoin books.

2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:33.000
 Well, that's a good selection. And of course, like you said, your writing and your book that comes out this year or next year?

2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:49.000
 I think I'm going to need 18 months. But most of the good Bitcoin content is just online, on Medium, on Twitter. So it's a decentralized consensus kind of thing.

2:18:49.000 --> 2:19:05.000
 What about book recommendations that you could give people who love these outside of the world of crypto that maybe had an impact on your life? Fiction, like sci fi, maybe technical, philosophical. Is there something you would recommend that people might read?

2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:19.000
 I really liked the three body problem. But that's a really hackneyed recommendation. But it really made me think and I like the hard sci fi, you know, the commitment to science and science fiction. So I thought it was very clever.

2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:30.000
 Is there one? Is there something that really annoys you? In terms of the opposite of hard sci fi, like that doesn't get stuff right movies?

2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:48.000
 I mean, I have issues when I watch like, ostensibly sci fi or fantasy films that are not consistent about this, the rules for the universe that they've laid out, or where there's impossible to comprehend, like Christopher Nolan's latest film.

2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:58.000
 Oh, yeah. You needed like a spreadsheet to understand that. Yeah. I trust that maybe he was consistent about the rules of his universe. I just did not understand it at all.

2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:22.000
 In that sense, I really probably one of my favorites is 2001 Space Odyssey. It's so obviously it's many, many decades ago, but it's quite brilliant in both its consistency and the depth of thought put into like, what the technology would actually be.

2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:48.000
 Not in like visually, not in kind of silly graphical ways, but in terms of function and its impact on humanity. So, but that takes care. That takes a lot of work and that takes genius actually, which is why Kubrick is regarded for what he is.

2:20:48.000 --> 2:21:08.000
 What advice? You've taken an interesting journey through your life. You were at Fidelity, a philosophy major. You're now one of the seminal minds in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Who the hell knows what the next 5, 10 years looks for you.

2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:19.000
 If you were to give advice to somebody young today, making their way through life, making a career, what kind of advice would you give?

2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:41.000
 See, the problem with advice is that in a world where so much of success is defined by luck and serendipity is that the advice givers often don't know why they've been successful, right? And so they might say, you know, I was wearing a green tie on the day of my job interview and so you should go out and wear green ties.

2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:59.000
 And so they might just get the causality completely wrong, right? I mean, I'm not going to claim that I'm super successful yet, but see, that's the problem is that I don't think my journey is replicable necessarily. So, you know, who am I to give advice?

2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:22.000
 Although the one thing I will say is that the thing I did right was to become completely obsessed with a domain I found really interesting and held promise. Like if I had been really interested in like Magic the Gathering, I wouldn't have been able to like do much with that aside from build like a killer, you know, card pack or whatever.

2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:48.000
 And I wasn't afraid to, you know, really put myself out there and, you know, float my thoughts online and see how people reacted to them. Even if I said stuff that was completely erroneous or wrong all the time, the rewards to writing and just publishing content are immense, as you know, obviously, it's the most high leverage activity I think most young people have available to them.

2:22:48.000 --> 2:23:03.000
 And I was very lucky and I benefited from a lot of favorable coincidences, a lot of people that took a chance on me. And if I had more time, I would sit here and name them.

2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:23.000
 Is there something in your actions that made you more open to the benefits of luck? Sort of, you know, luck can bring you a lot of positive and negative things. So saying you're lucky means you were able to ride the wave of whatever positive stuff luck brought you.

2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:43.000
 Well, that's right, you have to put yourself in a position to be lucky. And most people don't. So you just have to get as many shots on goal as possible. And, of course, luck plays an undeniable role in any career path, for sure. But you do have to make yourself available to it.

2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:58.000
 And you have to take a ton of chances. But yeah, that's the problem with advice. It's just so hard to replicate it. So I find it illegitimate most of the time.

2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:01.000
 You heard it here, kids, don't listen to anything Nick just said.

2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:02.000
 Exactly.

2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:12.000
 Wear a green tie to your interviews, it'll work out well. Do you think there's a meaning or reason to any of this, this existence, this life?

2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:34.000
 Well, we make our own meaning, for sure. I find a huge amount of meaning in what I do. I find it beautiful, I feel very lucky and blessed to be in the line of work that I'm in, you know, to have your hobby and your passion and your job just be a completely integrated thing. So that's where I find meaning.

2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:50.000
 But you're just a bag of like cells and bacteria that eventually dissipates, dies, and it goes into the ground and disappears back into the universe. I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

2:24:50.000 --> 2:25:08.000
 Well, that may be true. But I find the sublime in things like Bitcoin. I find it incredibly inspiring to work on it. I believe it's 100 year plus project. And, you know, it stirs those aesthetic emotions in you, as I'm sure your work does.

2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:09.000
 So you find it beautiful?

2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:14.000
 Absolutely. Absolutely. And inspiring more than just beautiful.

2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.000
 So you have hope for human civilization and Bitcoin as part of that hope?

2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:42.000
 Yeah, it's a very optimistic view. And people accuse us of being pessimists and saying that we are, you know, rooting for the collapse of civilization. Completely false. Bitcoiners are wildly optimistic, because they believe that you can monetize a completely new system from scratch and compete with the strongest superpower in the military and the dollar and everything that goes with that.

2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:52.000
 That's the craziest, most ludicrously optimistic proposition imaginable. So I think Bitcoiners are the most optimistic people out there.

2:25:52.000 --> 2:26:18.000
 I don't think there's a better way to end it on that hopeful vision of human civilization. Nick, I've heard a lot of amazing things about you. I was binge watching your interviews, binge reading your blogs, fell in love with your work. You're a good dude. Inspiring, brilliant. Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time with me today.

2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000
 My absolute pleasure.

2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:32.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Carter, and thank you to The Information, Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic, and Blinkist. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:38.000
 And now, let me leave you with some words about freedom and beauty from Stephen King.

2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:52.000
 Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them, they somehow fly out past you.

2:26:52.000 --> 2:27:03.000
 And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices. But still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.

2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:14.000
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
