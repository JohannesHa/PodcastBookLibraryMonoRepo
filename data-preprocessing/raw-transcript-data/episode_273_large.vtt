00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 What are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.320
 How do you analyze it within your framework about war?

00:06.320 --> 00:08.680
 How far would they go to hang onto power

00:09.680 --> 00:12.980
 when push came to shove is I think the thing

00:12.980 --> 00:16.520
 that worries me the most and is plainly

00:16.520 --> 00:19.120
 what worries most people about the risk of nuclear war.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.720
 Like at what point does that unchecked leadership

00:22.640 --> 00:24.860
 decide that this is worth it?

00:24.860 --> 00:29.860
 Especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top.

00:31.900 --> 00:34.340
 The following is a conversation with Chris Blattman,

00:34.340 --> 00:36.340
 professor at the University of Chicago,

00:36.340 --> 00:41.040
 studying the causes and consequences of violence and war.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.180
 This he explores in his new book called

00:44.180 --> 00:48.860
 Why We Fight, The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace.

00:48.860 --> 00:51.160
 The book comes out on April 19th,

00:51.160 --> 00:54.800
 so you should preorder it to support Chris and his work.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.800
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.800
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:58.800 --> 00:59.880
 in the description.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.760
 And now, dear friends, here's Chris Blattman.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.400
 In your new book titled Why We Fight,

01:07.400 --> 01:10.240
 The Roots of War and the Paths for Peace,

01:10.240 --> 01:13.880
 you write, quote, let me be clear what I mean

01:13.880 --> 01:15.740
 when I say war.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.420
 I don't just mean countries duking it out.

01:18.420 --> 01:21.340
 I mean any kind of prolonged violence struggle

01:21.340 --> 01:22.580
 between groups.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.960
 That includes villages, clans, gangs, ethnic groups,

01:25.960 --> 01:29.600
 religious sects, political factions, and nations.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.840
 Wildly different as these may be,

01:31.840 --> 01:34.760
 their origins have much in common.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.560
 We'll see that the Northern Irish zealots,

01:37.560 --> 01:40.400
 Colombian cartels, European tyrants,

01:40.400 --> 01:44.240
 Liberian rebels, Greek oligarchs, Chicago gangs,

01:44.240 --> 01:48.080
 Indian mobs, Rwandan genociders,

01:48.080 --> 01:50.320
 a new word I learned, thank you to you.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.360
 Those are people who administer genocide.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.960
 English soccer hooligans and American invaders.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.860
 So first, let me ask, what is war?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.560
 In saying that war is a prolonged violence struggle

02:07.560 --> 02:11.080
 between groups, what do the words prolonged groups

02:11.080 --> 02:12.600
 and violent mean?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.520
 I sit at the sort of intersection of economics

02:14.520 --> 02:17.840
 and political science, and I also dwell a little bit

02:17.840 --> 02:20.720
 in psychology, but that's partly because I'm married

02:20.720 --> 02:23.680
 to psychologists, sometimes do research with her.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.720
 All these things are really different.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.680
 So if you're a political scientist,

02:25.680 --> 02:27.380
 you spend a lot of time just classifying

02:27.380 --> 02:30.580
 a really narrow kind of conflict, and studying that.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.120
 And that's an important way to make progress

02:33.120 --> 02:34.180
 as a social scientist.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.460
 But I'm not trying to make progress,

02:35.460 --> 02:38.360
 I'm trying to sort of help everybody step back and say,

02:38.360 --> 02:39.880
 you know what, there's like some common things

02:39.880 --> 02:42.680
 that we know from these disciplines

02:42.680 --> 02:46.280
 that relate to a really wide range of phenomena.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.680
 Basically, we can talk about them in a very similar way

02:48.680 --> 02:49.880
 and we can get really similar insights.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.320
 So I wanted to actually bring them together,

02:54.320 --> 02:56.840
 but I still had to like say,

02:56.840 --> 02:58.600
 let's hold out individual violence,

02:58.600 --> 03:03.180
 which has a lot in common, but individuals choose

03:03.180 --> 03:05.440
 to engage in violence for more

03:05.440 --> 03:06.720
 and sometimes different reasons.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.560
 So let's just put that aside so that we can focus a bit.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.800
 And let's really put aside short incidents of violence,

03:13.800 --> 03:16.480
 because those might have the same kind

03:16.480 --> 03:18.000
 of things explaining them.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.480
 But actually, there's a lot of other things

03:19.480 --> 03:20.720
 that can explain short violence.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.000
 Short violence can be really demonstrative.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
 Like you can just, I can use it to communicate information.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.600
 The thing that all of it has in common

03:29.600 --> 03:31.360
 is that it doesn't generally make sense.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.040
 It's not your best option most of the time.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.600
 And so I wanted to say, let's take this thing

03:36.600 --> 03:37.900
 that should be puzzling.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.540
 We kind of think it's normal,

03:39.540 --> 03:42.280
 we kind of think this is what all humans do.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.280
 But let's point out that it's not normal

03:45.680 --> 03:47.420
 and then figure out why and let's talk about why.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.400
 And so I was trying to throw out the short violence,

03:50.400 --> 03:53.160
 I was trying to throw out the individual violence.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.560
 I was also trying to throw out all the competition

03:56.560 --> 03:58.040
 that happens that's not violent.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.500
 That's the normal, normal competition.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.440
 I was trying to say, let's talk about violent competition,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.920
 because that's kind of the puzzle.

04:03.920 --> 04:04.920
 So that's really interesting,

04:04.920 --> 04:07.920
 because you said usually people try

04:07.920 --> 04:10.880
 to find a narrow definition and you said progress.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.760
 So you made progress by finding a narrow definition,

04:13.760 --> 04:18.560
 for example, of military conflict in a particular context.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.960
 And progress means, all right, well,

04:20.960 --> 04:24.420
 how do we prevent this particular kind of military conflict?

04:24.420 --> 04:26.240
 Or maybe if it's already happening,

04:26.240 --> 04:29.920
 how do we deescalate it and how do we solve it,

04:29.920 --> 04:31.720
 sort of from a geopolitics perspective,

04:31.720 --> 04:33.600
 from an economics perspective?

04:33.600 --> 04:36.300
 And you're looking for a definition of war

04:36.300 --> 04:38.760
 that is as broad as possible,

04:38.760 --> 04:41.800
 but not so broad that you cannot achieve

04:41.800 --> 04:45.200
 a deep level of understanding of why it happens

04:45.200 --> 04:46.780
 and how it can be avoided.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.480
 Right, and a common, basically like recognize

04:49.480 --> 04:52.940
 that common principles govern some kinds of behavior

04:52.940 --> 04:54.520
 that look pretty different.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.360
 Like an Indian ethnic riot is obviously pretty different

04:59.360 --> 05:01.600
 than invading a neighboring country, right?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.560
 But, and that's pretty different than two villages,

05:04.560 --> 05:06.180
 or two gangs, a lot of what I work on

05:06.180 --> 05:08.040
 is studying organized criminals and gangs.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.000
 Two gangs going to war you'd think is really different,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.400
 and of course it is, but there are some common principles.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.400
 You can just think about conflict and the use of violence

05:16.400 --> 05:19.720
 and not learn everything, but just get a lot,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.720
 just get really, really far by sort of seeing

05:21.720 --> 05:23.440
 the commonalities rather than just focusing

05:23.440 --> 05:24.380
 on the differences.

05:24.380 --> 05:28.680
 So again, those words are prolonged, groups, and violent.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.000
 Can you maybe linger on each of those words?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.080
 What does prolonged mean?

05:33.080 --> 05:36.240
 Where's the line between short and long?

05:36.240 --> 05:39.080
 What does groups mean, and what does violent mean?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.660
 So let me, you know, I have a friend who,

05:42.580 --> 05:44.320
 someone who's become a friend through the process

05:44.320 --> 05:47.220
 of my work and writing this book also,

05:47.220 --> 05:52.220
 who was 20, 30 years ago, was a gang leader in Chicago.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.560
 So this guy named Napoleon English, or NAP.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.360
 And I remember one time he was saying,

05:57.360 --> 05:59.440
 well you know, when I was young I used to,

05:59.440 --> 06:03.120
 I was 15, 16, and he'd go to the neighboring

06:03.120 --> 06:05.120
 gang's territory, he says I'd go gang banging,

06:05.120 --> 06:06.560
 and I said, well, I didn't know what that meant.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.520
 I said, what does that mean?

06:07.520 --> 06:09.800
 And he said, oh, that just meant I'd shoot him up.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.400
 Like I'd shoot at buildings, I might shoot at people.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.360
 I wasn't trying to kill, he wasn't trying to kill them.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.040
 He was just trying to sort of send a signal

06:18.040 --> 06:20.800
 that he was a tough guy, and he was fearless,

06:20.800 --> 06:24.760
 and he was someone who they should be careful with.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.320
 And so I didn't want to call that war, right?

06:27.320 --> 06:30.800
 That was, that's something different.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.220
 That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic,

06:33.220 --> 06:36.280
 and he wasn't, and he was basically trying

06:36.280 --> 06:37.560
 to send them information.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.200
 And this is what countries do all the time, right?

06:40.200 --> 06:44.800
 We have military parades, and we might

06:44.800 --> 06:49.480
 have border skirmishes, and I wanted to sort of,

06:49.480 --> 06:52.860
 so what's short is a three month border skirmish,

06:52.860 --> 06:55.840
 a war, I mean, I don't try to get into those things.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.320
 I don't want to, but I want to point out that like,

06:59.280 --> 07:02.040
 these long, grueling months and years of violence

07:02.040 --> 07:04.800
 are like the problem and the puzzle.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.320
 And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time

07:07.320 --> 07:12.280
 talking about the international version of gang banging.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.480
 It's a different phenomenon.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.560
 So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap,

07:16.560 --> 07:19.240
 let's call him, not to add confusion,

07:19.240 --> 07:21.840
 that doesn't qualify for war?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.880
 Is it the individual aspect?

07:23.880 --> 07:28.600
 Is it that violence is not the thing that is sought,

07:28.600 --> 07:33.600
 but the communication of information is what is sought?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.720
 Or is it the shortness of it?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.280
 Is it all of those combined?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.720
 It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group,

07:41.720 --> 07:44.320
 or he's becoming the head of a group at that point.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.400
 And that group eventually did go to war

07:47.400 --> 07:49.280
 with those neighboring gangs, which is to say

07:49.280 --> 07:51.960
 it was just long, drawn out conflict

07:51.960 --> 07:53.840
 over months and months and months.

07:53.840 --> 07:58.400
 But I think one of the big insights from my fields

07:58.400 --> 08:02.880
 is that you're constantly negotiating over something, right?

08:02.880 --> 08:04.360
 Whether you're officially negotiating

08:04.360 --> 08:07.760
 or you're all posturing, you're bargaining over something

08:07.760 --> 08:12.760
 and you should be able to figure out a way to split that pie.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.520
 And you could use violence.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.080
 But violence is, everybody's miserable.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.200
 Like if you're nap, like if you start a war,

08:18.200 --> 08:19.960
 one, there's lots of risks.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.560
 You could get killed, that's not good.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.040
 You could kill somebody else and go to jail,

08:24.040 --> 08:26.560
 which is what happened to him, that's not good.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.880
 Your soldiers get killed, no one's buying your drugs

08:28.880 --> 08:31.160
 in the middle of a gunfight, so it interrupts your business.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.920
 And so on and on, it's really miserable.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.880
 This is what we're seeing right now,

08:34.880 --> 08:37.840
 as we're recording the Russian invasion of Ukraine

08:37.840 --> 08:40.040
 is now at the fourth or fifth week.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.920
 Everybody's, if it didn't dawn on them before,

08:42.920 --> 08:47.200
 it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.400
 As you describe for everybody.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.720
 So everybody is losing in this war.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.200
 Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.120
 Everybody loses something from war.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.960
 And there was usually, not always,

08:58.960 --> 09:01.280
 but the point is there was usually a way

09:01.280 --> 09:04.200
 to get what you wanted or be better off

09:04.200 --> 09:05.880
 without having to fight over it.

09:05.880 --> 09:10.000
 So there's this, fighting is just politics by other means.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.520
 And it's just inefficient, costly, brutal, devastating means.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.040
 And so that's like the deep insight.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.600
 And so I kind of wanted to say,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.960
 so I guess like what's not war?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.840
 I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions

09:23.840 --> 09:28.480
 because there's reams and reams of political science papers

09:28.480 --> 09:30.840
 written on like what's a war, what's not a war.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.820
 People disagree.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.400
 I just wanted to say,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.140
 war is the thing that we shouldn't be doing.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.040
 Or war is the violence that doesn't make sense.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.500
 There's a whole bunch of other violence,

09:42.500 --> 09:44.960
 including gang banging and skirmishes

09:44.960 --> 09:47.080
 and things that might make sense,

09:47.080 --> 09:49.720
 precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating

09:49.720 --> 09:53.800
 or they're not particularly costly.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.280
 War is the thing that's just so costly

09:55.280 --> 09:56.160
 we should be trying to avoid

09:56.160 --> 09:58.400
 is maybe like the meta way I think about it.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.320
 All right.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.760
 Nevertheless, definitions are interesting.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.480
 So outside of the academic bickering,

10:06.480 --> 10:08.480
 every time you try to define something,

10:08.480 --> 10:13.480
 I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.160
 So the destination doesn't matter

10:15.160 --> 10:17.600
 because the moment you arrive at the definition,

10:18.480 --> 10:19.760
 you lose the power.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.800
 Yeah, one of the interesting thing,

10:21.800 --> 10:24.280
 I mean, so people, if you wanna do,

10:24.280 --> 10:26.920
 some of what I do is just quantitative analysis of conflict.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.120
 And if you wanna do that,

10:29.120 --> 10:31.260
 if you wanna sort of run statistics on war,

10:31.260 --> 10:32.680
 then you have to code it all up.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.360
 And then lots of people have done that.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.480
 There's four or five major data sets

10:36.480 --> 10:39.480
 where people or teams of people have over time said,

10:39.480 --> 10:42.520
 we're gonna code years of war between these groups

10:42.520 --> 10:44.000
 or within a country.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.360
 And what's interesting is how difficult,

10:46.360 --> 10:48.160
 these data sets don't often agree.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.640
 You have to make all of these,

10:49.640 --> 10:51.880
 the decision gets really complicated.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.760
 Like when does the war begin, right?

10:53.760 --> 10:56.480
 Does it begin when a certain number

10:56.480 --> 10:58.080
 of people have been killed?

10:58.080 --> 11:02.000
 Did it begin, what if there's like lots of skirmishing

11:02.000 --> 11:05.900
 and sort of little terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed

11:05.900 --> 11:08.180
 and then eventually turns into war?

11:08.180 --> 11:11.160
 Do we backdate it to like

11:11.160 --> 11:13.540
 when the first act of violence started?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.360
 And then what do we do with all the times

11:15.360 --> 11:17.400
 when there was like that low scale,

11:17.400 --> 11:19.920
 low intensity violence or bombs lobbed

11:19.920 --> 11:22.600
 and do we call those wars

11:22.600 --> 11:24.340
 or maybe only if they eventually get worse?

11:24.340 --> 11:26.920
 Like, so you get, it actually is really tricky.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.720
 And the defensive and the offensive aspect.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.840
 So everybody, Hitler in World War II,

11:32.840 --> 11:34.980
 it seems like he never attacked anybody.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.640
 He's always defending against the unjust attack

11:38.640 --> 11:41.280
 of everybody else as he's taken over the world.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.520
 So that's like information propaganda

11:44.520 --> 11:48.040
 that every side is trying to communicate to the world.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.640
 So you can't listen to necessarily information

11:50.640 --> 11:52.240
 like self report data.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.040
 You have to kind of look past that somehow.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.160
 Maybe look, especially in the modern world

11:57.160 --> 11:58.880
 as much as possible at the data.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.320
 How many bombs dropped?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.260
 How many people killed?

12:03.260 --> 12:06.620
 How the number of estimates of the number of troops moved

12:06.620 --> 12:09.040
 from one location to another and that kind of thing.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.420
 And the other interesting thing

12:10.420 --> 12:13.920
 is there's quantitative analysis of war.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.240
 So for example, I was looking at just war index

12:17.240 --> 12:21.760
 or people trying to measure, trying to put a number

12:21.760 --> 12:24.880
 on what wars are seen as just and not.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.360
 Oh really, I've never seen that.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.680
 It's, there's numbers behind it.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.520
 It's great.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.800
 So it's great because again,

12:32.800 --> 12:37.800
 as you do an extensive quantification of justice,

12:38.680 --> 12:41.880
 you start to think what actually contributes

12:41.880 --> 12:46.600
 to our thought that for example, World War II is a just war

12:46.600 --> 12:48.000
 and other wars are not.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.760
 A lot of it is about intent

12:51.760 --> 12:54.240
 and some of the other factors like that you look at

12:54.240 --> 12:56.840
 which is prolonged, the degree of violence

12:56.840 --> 13:00.200
 that is necessary versus not necessary

13:00.200 --> 13:03.720
 given the greater good, some measure of the greater good

13:03.720 --> 13:06.120
 of people, all those kinds of things.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.640
 Then there's reasons for war, you know,

13:08.640 --> 13:13.640
 looking to free people or to stop a genocide

13:13.840 --> 13:17.280
 versus conquering land, all those kinds of things.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.360
 And people try to put a number behind it.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.200
 And a lot of.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.080
 It's based on, I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is,

13:23.080 --> 13:26.200
 I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever,

13:26.200 --> 13:28.440
 suppose I think my God tells me to do something

13:29.440 --> 13:33.960
 or my God thinks that, or my moral sense thinks

13:33.960 --> 13:36.760
 that something that another group is doing is repugnant.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.760
 I'm curious, are they evaluating the validity of that claim

13:41.880 --> 13:44.320
 or just the idea that like, well, you said it was repugnant,

13:44.320 --> 13:46.720
 you deeply believe that, therefore it's just?

13:46.720 --> 13:50.040
 I think, and that could be corrected on a lot of this,

13:50.040 --> 13:52.520
 but I think this is always looking at wars

13:52.520 --> 13:56.840
 after they happened and trying to take a global perspective

13:56.840 --> 14:00.680
 from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive.

14:00.680 --> 14:04.200
 So you're not weighing disproportionately the opinions

14:04.200 --> 14:05.680
 of the people who waged the war.

14:05.680 --> 14:10.680
 Yeah, I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that because,

14:11.120 --> 14:14.800
 I mean, one is to just point out that wars,

14:14.800 --> 14:16.880
 actually most wars aren't necessary.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.560
 And so in the sense that there's another way

14:19.560 --> 14:21.400
 to get what you wanted.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.560
 And so on one level, there's no just war.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.720
 Now that's not true because take an example

14:28.720 --> 14:30.960
 like the US invasion of Afghanistan.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.800
 The United States has been attacked.

14:32.800 --> 14:37.240
 There's a culpable agent, reliable evidence

14:37.240 --> 14:39.160
 that this is Al Qaeda.

14:39.160 --> 14:43.280
 They're being sheltered in Afghanistan by the Taliban.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.560
 And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.120
 It seems that there was an attempt to say hand him over

14:50.120 --> 14:53.160
 or else and they said, no way.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.840
 Now you can make an argument that invading

14:56.840 --> 14:59.400
 and attacking is strategically the right thing to do

14:59.400 --> 15:02.680
 in terms of sending signals to your future enemies

15:02.680 --> 15:06.000
 or if you think it's important to bring someone to justice,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.240
 in this case, Al Qaeda, then maybe that's just war

15:09.240 --> 15:11.040
 or that's a just invasion.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.720
 But it hinges on the fact that the other side

15:14.720 --> 15:17.640
 just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing,

15:17.640 --> 15:20.920
 which is say, okay, we'll give them up.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.920
 And so it was completely avoidable in one sense.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.080
 But if you believe, and I think it's probably true,

15:28.080 --> 15:31.480
 if you believe that for their own ideological

15:31.480 --> 15:36.080
 and other reasons, you know, Mullah Omar in particular

15:36.080 --> 15:39.600
 and Taliban in general decided we're not going to do this,

15:40.920 --> 15:44.560
 then now you're not left with very many good choices.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.440
 And now, you know, I didn't wanna talk about

15:48.440 --> 15:51.120
 is that a just war or is that, what's justice or not?

15:51.120 --> 15:55.160
 I just wanted to point out that like one side's

15:55.160 --> 15:57.160
 intransigence, if that's indeed what happened,

15:57.160 --> 16:00.640
 one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you

16:00.640 --> 16:04.080
 to basically eliminates all of the reasonable bargains

16:04.080 --> 16:06.040
 that you could be satisfied with and now you're left

16:06.040 --> 16:08.600
 with really no other strategic option but to invade.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.300
 I think that's a slight oversimplification,

16:10.300 --> 16:14.520
 but I think that's like one way to describe what happened.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.700
 So your book is fascinating and your perspective

16:16.700 --> 16:18.360
 on this is fascinating.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.000
 I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times

16:21.000 --> 16:22.880
 to try to get a clarity.

16:22.880 --> 16:27.760
 But the thesis is that war is costly,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.280
 usually costly for everybody.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.880
 So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war

16:33.880 --> 16:35.480
 because you're going to,

16:35.480 --> 16:40.480
 from a game theoretic perspective, nobody wins.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.760
 And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason,

16:47.040 --> 16:50.760
 a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication

16:50.760 --> 16:54.600
 or healthy operation of the world, some kind of breakdown.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.680
 You list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down.

16:58.680 --> 17:03.480
 But there's also human beings in this mix.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.160
 And there is ideas of justice.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.440
 So for example, I don't want to,

17:09.440 --> 17:12.160
 my memory doesn't serve me well on which wars

17:12.160 --> 17:15.600
 were seen as justice, very, very few in the 20th century

17:15.600 --> 17:17.820
 of the many that have been there.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.960
 The wars that were seen as just, first of all,

17:19.960 --> 17:23.240
 the most just war seen is World War II by far.

17:24.180 --> 17:28.160
 It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold

17:28.160 --> 17:31.120
 that's seen as just, everything that's seen as unjust.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.500
 It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.320
 And I think the ones that are seen as more just

17:39.320 --> 17:40.720
 are the ones that are fast,

17:41.760 --> 17:44.080
 that you have a very specific purpose,

17:44.080 --> 17:46.520
 you communicate that purpose honestly

17:46.520 --> 17:50.580
 with the global community, and you strike hard, fast,

17:50.580 --> 17:55.580
 and you pull out to do sort of, it's like rescue missions.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.580
 It's almost like policing work.

17:57.580 --> 17:58.960
 If there's somebody suffering,

17:58.960 --> 18:02.760
 you go in and stop that suffering directly, and that's it.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.920
 I think World War II is seen in that way,

18:05.920 --> 18:09.620
 that there's an obvious aggressor

18:09.620 --> 18:11.680
 that is causing a lot of suffering in the world

18:11.680 --> 18:15.000
 and looking to expand the scale of that suffering.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
 And so you strike, I mean, given the scale,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.520
 you strike as hard and as fast as possible

18:22.520 --> 18:25.960
 to stop the expansion of the suffering.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.200
 So that's kind of how they see.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.480
 I don't know if you can kind of look with this framework

18:32.480 --> 18:36.240
 that you've presented and look at Hitler and think,

18:36.240 --> 18:41.240
 well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
 Poland, Britain, France, Russia, the Soviet Union,

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
 America, the United States of America, same with Japan.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.440
 Is it in their long term interest?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.420
 I don't know.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.000
 So for me, who cares about alleviating

19:08.000 --> 19:11.880
 human suffering in the world, yes, it's not.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.480
 It seems like almost no war is just.

19:15.480 --> 19:20.480
 But it also seems somehow deeply human to fight.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.280
 And I think your book makes the case, no, it's not.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.120
 Can you try to get at that?

19:28.120 --> 19:31.180
 Because it seems that war, there is some,

19:31.180 --> 19:35.840
 that drama of war seems to beat in all human hearts.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.540
 Like it's in there somewhere.

19:37.540 --> 19:41.200
 Maybe it's, maybe that's like a relic of the past

19:41.200 --> 19:42.480
 and we need to get rid of it.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.720
 It's deeply irrational.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.160
 Okay, so obviously we go to war

19:46.160 --> 19:47.520
 and obviously there's a lot of violence.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.800
 And so we have to explain something

19:49.800 --> 19:52.920
 and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.860
 So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with,

19:56.860 --> 19:59.320
 I think it was just useful to sort of start and point out,

19:59.320 --> 20:02.200
 actually, there's really, really, really, really strong

20:02.200 --> 20:03.520
 incentives not to go to war

20:03.520 --> 20:04.880
 because it's gonna be really costly.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.080
 And so all of these other human or strategic things,

20:08.080 --> 20:10.560
 all these things, the circumstantial things

20:10.560 --> 20:13.080
 that will eventually lead us to go to war

20:13.080 --> 20:16.720
 have to be pretty powerful before we go there.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.400
 And most of the time.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.520
 Sorry to interrupt.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.560
 And that's why you also describe very importantly

20:22.560 --> 20:25.640
 that war throughout human history is actually rare.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.800
 We usually avoid it.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.280
 You know, most people don't know about

20:30.280 --> 20:32.940
 the US invasion of Haiti in 1994.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.120
 I mean, a lot of people know about it,

20:34.120 --> 20:35.720
 but people just don't pay attention to it.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.640
 We don't, we're gonna, you know,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.560
 the history books and school kids are gonna learn

20:39.560 --> 20:43.640
 about the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades,

20:43.640 --> 20:47.520
 and nobody's going to put this one in the history books.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.440
 And it's because it didn't actually happen

20:50.440 --> 20:54.560
 because before the troops could land,

20:54.560 --> 20:58.960
 the person who'd taken power in a coup basically said fine.

20:58.960 --> 21:03.240
 There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti,

21:03.240 --> 21:05.600
 to this new dictator who's refused

21:05.600 --> 21:08.200
 to let a Democratic president take power.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.840
 And tries to convince him to step down or else.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.760
 And he says, no, no, no.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.780
 And then he shows him a video,

21:14.780 --> 21:16.840
 and it's basically troop planes

21:16.840 --> 21:19.000
 and all these things taking off.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.280
 And he's like, this is not live.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.600
 This is two hours ago.

21:21.600 --> 21:26.600
 So it's a, and basically he basically gives up right there.

21:26.760 --> 21:27.600
 So that was.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.080
 That's a powerful move.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.280
 Yeah.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.040
 I think Powell might've been one of his teachers

21:33.040 --> 21:34.480
 in like a US military college,

21:34.480 --> 21:36.240
 because a lot of these military dictators

21:36.240 --> 21:37.500
 trained at some point.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.440
 So they had some, there was some personal relationships

21:39.440 --> 21:40.720
 at least between people in the US government

21:40.720 --> 21:42.840
 and this guy that they were trying to use.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.920
 The point is, and that's like what should have happened.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.800
 That makes sense, right?

21:46.800 --> 21:51.020
 Like, yeah, maybe I could mount an insurgency

21:51.020 --> 21:52.680
 and yeah, I'm not gonna bear a lot of the cost of war

21:52.680 --> 21:53.520
 cause I'm the dictator.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.520
 And maybe he's human and he just wants to fight

21:55.520 --> 21:57.460
 or gets angry or it's just in his mind,

21:57.460 --> 21:58.300
 whatever he's doing.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.160
 But at the end of the day, it's like,

21:59.160 --> 22:00.460
 this does not make sense.

22:02.260 --> 22:04.620
 And that's what happens most of the time,

22:04.620 --> 22:06.720
 but we don't write so many books about it.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.680
 And now some political scientists go

22:10.680 --> 22:13.040
 and they count up all of the nations that could fight

22:13.040 --> 22:14.080
 cause they have some dispute

22:14.080 --> 22:15.920
 and they're right next to one another,

22:15.920 --> 22:17.480
 or they look at the ethnic groups

22:17.480 --> 22:18.600
 that could fight with one another

22:18.600 --> 22:19.800
 cause there's some tension

22:19.800 --> 22:22.320
 and they're right next to one another.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.800
 And then whatever, some number like 999 out of 1000

22:25.800 --> 22:29.880
 don't fight because they just find some other way.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.760
 They don't like each other, but they just loathe in peace

22:32.760 --> 22:35.000
 because that's the sensible thing to do.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.400
 And that's what we all do, we loathe in peace.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.280
 And we loathed the Soviet Union in relative peace

22:40.280 --> 22:44.320
 for decades and India loathes Pakistan in peace.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.760
 I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

22:46.760 --> 22:48.800
 again, it was in the newspapers,

22:48.800 --> 22:51.440
 but most people didn't, I think, take note.

22:51.440 --> 22:55.680
 India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan

22:55.680 --> 22:57.660
 and common suit.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.420
 So they were like, yeah, this is,

22:59.420 --> 23:00.640
 we do not want to go to war.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.600
 This will be bad.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.920
 We'll be angry, but we'll accept your explanation

23:05.920 --> 23:07.200
 that this was an accident.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.760
 And so these things find to the radar.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.440
 And so we overestimate, I think,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.660
 how likely it is the sides are gonna fight.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.000
 But then of course, things do happen.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.440
 Like Russia did invade the Ukraine

23:19.440 --> 23:22.640
 and didn't find some negotiated deal.

23:22.640 --> 23:26.560
 And so then the book is sort of about half the book

23:26.560 --> 23:28.640
 is just sort of laying out,

23:28.640 --> 23:31.120
 actually like there's just different ways this breaks down.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.640
 And some of them are human.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.160
 Some of them are this,

23:34.160 --> 23:37.240
 I actually don't think war beats in our heart.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.920
 It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.040
 As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.160
 We're really, really good.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.840
 So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence

23:47.840 --> 23:50.120
 and we're okay getting angry and vengeance

23:50.120 --> 23:53.420
 and we have principles that will sometimes lead us,

23:53.420 --> 23:55.080
 but we're actually really, really,

23:55.080 --> 23:57.040
 really good at cooperation.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.840
 And so that's, again, I'm not trying to write

23:59.840 --> 24:02.320
 some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great

24:02.320 --> 24:03.840
 and we're all happy and we don't really fight.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.400
 It's more just to say, let's start,

24:06.400 --> 24:07.520
 let's be like a doctor.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.300
 As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?

24:10.300 --> 24:12.200
 I'm gonna try, I know there's sick people,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.760
 but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health

24:14.760 --> 24:16.400
 and that most people are healthy.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.040
 And that's gonna make me a better doctor.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.380
 And that's, I'm kind of saying the same thing.

24:19.380 --> 24:22.200
 Let's be better doctors of politics in the world

24:22.200 --> 24:25.240
 by recognizing that like normal state is health.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.440
 And then we're gonna identify like what are the diseases

24:28.440 --> 24:30.440
 that are causing this warfare.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.240
 So yeah, the natural state of the human body

24:33.240 --> 24:35.640
 with the immune system and all the different parts

24:36.840 --> 24:39.400
 wants to be healthy and is really damn good

24:39.400 --> 24:41.920
 at being healthy, but sometimes it breaks down.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.440
 Let's understand how it breaks down.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.280
 Yeah, exactly.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.120
 So what are the five ways that you list

24:47.120 --> 24:48.920
 that are the roots of war?

24:48.920 --> 24:50.600
 Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.680
 They're sort of things that rhyme, right?

24:52.680 --> 24:54.320
 In the interview, because it's not all the same.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.560
 There's like lots of reasons to go to war.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.220
 There's this great line,

24:57.220 --> 24:59.640
 there's a reason for every war and a war for every reason.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.800
 And that's true.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.760
 And it's kind of overwhelming, right?

25:02.760 --> 25:04.480
 And it's overwhelming for a lot of people.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.920
 It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.200
 And I think one of the gifts of social science

25:09.200 --> 25:11.480
 is actually people have started to organize this for us.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.320
 And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.360
 Buckets that rhyme.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.400
 Buckets with some economics.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.240
 Yeah, the terrible metaphor, right?

25:18.240 --> 25:19.980
 And bad at metaphors.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.480
 So the idea was that like that basic,

25:22.480 --> 25:24.080
 like something overrides these incentives.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.960
 And I guess I was saying there's five ways

25:26.960 --> 25:28.000
 that they get overrided.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.160
 And three are, I'd call strategic.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.360
 Like they're kind of logical.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.560
 There's circumstances that,

25:34.560 --> 25:36.180
 and this is, they're sort of,

25:36.180 --> 25:40.040
 where strategic is, strategy is like game theory.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.840
 You could use those two things interchangeably.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.400
 But game theory is sort of making it sound more complicated,

25:44.400 --> 25:45.240
 I think, than it is.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.920
 It's basically saying that there's times

25:46.920 --> 25:49.760
 when this is like the optimal choice

25:49.760 --> 25:51.200
 because of circumstances.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.020
 And one of them is when the people who are deciding

25:55.020 --> 25:56.960
 don't bear those costs.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.800
 So that's, or maybe even have a private incentive

25:59.800 --> 26:02.560
 that's gonna, that's, if they don't,

26:02.560 --> 26:03.640
 if they're ignoring the cost,

26:03.640 --> 26:06.700
 then maybe the costs of war are not so material.

26:06.700 --> 26:07.960
 That's a contributing factor.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.160
 Another is just, there's uncertainty,

26:10.160 --> 26:11.080
 and we could talk about that,

26:11.080 --> 26:13.520
 but there's just the absence of information

26:13.520 --> 26:15.360
 means that it actually, there's circumstances

26:15.360 --> 26:17.760
 where it's your best choice to attack.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.480
 There's this thing that political economists

26:19.480 --> 26:20.640
 call commitment problems,

26:20.640 --> 26:23.040
 which are basically saying there's some big power shift

26:23.040 --> 26:24.480
 that you can avoid by attacking now.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.880
 So it's like a dynamic incentive.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.080
 It's sort of saying, well, in order to keep something

26:28.080 --> 26:30.720
 from happening in the future, I can attack now.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.960
 And because of the structure of incentives,

26:32.960 --> 26:34.080
 it actually makes sense for me,

26:34.080 --> 26:38.420
 even though war is, in theory, really costly,

26:38.420 --> 26:40.680
 or it is really costly nonetheless.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.840
 And then there's these sort of human things.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.160
 One's a little bit like just war.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.400
 One sort of thing, there's like ideologies or principles

26:46.400 --> 26:50.900
 or things we value that weigh against those costs,

26:50.900 --> 26:54.040
 like exterminating the heretical idea

26:54.040 --> 26:58.220
 or standing up for a principle might be so valuable to me

26:58.220 --> 27:02.720
 that I'm willing to use violence, even if it's costly.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.000
 And there's nothing irrational about that.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.920
 And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities,

27:08.920 --> 27:11.180
 all the passions and all of the most importantly,

27:11.180 --> 27:13.160
 I think, like misperceptions, the way we get,

27:13.160 --> 27:15.800
 like we basically make wrong calculations

27:15.800 --> 27:17.800
 about whether or not war is the right decision.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.760
 We misunderstand or misjudge our enemy

27:21.760 --> 27:23.080
 or misjudge ourselves.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.480
 So if you put all those things into buckets,

27:25.480 --> 27:29.840
 how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way

27:29.840 --> 27:32.020
 and how much of it is a giant human mess?

27:32.940 --> 27:36.080
 So four of those five are really, on some level,

27:36.080 --> 27:39.780
 easy to think strategically and model in a simple way

27:41.220 --> 27:43.200
 in the sense that any of us can do it.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.400
 We do this all the time.

27:45.940 --> 27:50.940
 Think of bargaining in a market for a carpet or something

27:50.940 --> 27:55.300
 or whatever you bargained for, you're thinking a few steps

27:55.300 --> 27:58.700
 ahead about what your opponent's going to do.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.460
 And you stake out a high price, like a low price,

28:01.460 --> 28:04.300
 and the seller stakes out a high price.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.540
 And you might both say, oh, I refuse to,

28:06.540 --> 28:07.660
 I could never accept that.

28:07.660 --> 28:09.660
 And there's all this sort of cheap talk,

28:10.980 --> 28:13.140
 but you kind of understand where you're going

28:13.140 --> 28:15.700
 and it's efficient to like find a deal

28:15.700 --> 28:18.440
 and buy the market, buy the carpet eventually.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.000
 So we all understand this game theory and the strategy,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.480
 I think intuitively.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.440
 Or maybe even a closer example is like, suppose,

28:26.800 --> 28:28.960
 I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict

28:28.960 --> 28:31.720
 or any normal kind of legal,

28:31.720 --> 28:33.160
 it's not yet a legal dispute, right?

28:33.160 --> 28:34.920
 Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor

28:34.920 --> 28:36.080
 or somebody else.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.440
 Most of us don't end up going to court.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.800
 Going to court is like the war option.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.400
 That's the costly thing that we just ought to be able to avoid.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.160
 We ought to be able to find something between ourselves

28:46.160 --> 28:51.080
 that doesn't require this hiring lawyers

28:51.080 --> 28:53.320
 and a long drawn out trial.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.320
 And most of the time we do, right?

28:55.320 --> 28:57.960
 And so we all understand that incentive.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.960
 And then for those five buckets,

29:00.960 --> 29:02.800
 so everything except all the irrational

29:02.800 --> 29:05.360
 and the misperceptions are really easy to model.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.640
 Then from a technical standpoint,

29:06.640 --> 29:10.000
 it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.480
 And I'm not a game theorist.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.360
 And so I'm more channeling my colleagues

29:13.360 --> 29:18.080
 to do this and what I know, but it's not rocket science.

29:18.080 --> 29:22.000
 I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book

29:22.000 --> 29:24.480
 is like there's all these ideas out there

29:24.480 --> 29:26.640
 that can actually help us just make sense

29:26.640 --> 29:30.120
 of all these wars and just bring some order

29:30.120 --> 29:33.240
 to the morass of reasons.

29:33.240 --> 29:37.120
 Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.840
 So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.480
 I'll defer to you actually.

29:43.480 --> 29:46.040
 Well, I think it's because unfortunately it's very

29:46.040 --> 29:48.960
 like engineering, it's very well defined.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.120
 The problem is well defined.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.640
 The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated.

29:53.640 --> 29:56.440
 So it is true it's not rocket science, but it is not true.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.560
 It's easy because it's not rocket science.

29:58.560 --> 30:03.560
 But the problem, the downside of game theory

30:04.800 --> 30:08.400
 is not that it helps us make sense of the world.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.200
 It projects a simple model of the world

30:11.200 --> 30:15.240
 that brings us comfort in thinking we understand.

30:15.240 --> 30:19.260
 And sometimes that simplification is actually getting

30:19.260 --> 30:23.440
 at the core first principles on understanding of something.

30:23.440 --> 30:27.000
 And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.640
 So for example, I mean, mutually shared destruction

30:30.640 --> 30:33.720
 is a very simple model and people argue all the time

30:33.720 --> 30:35.840
 whether that's actually a good model or not,

30:35.840 --> 30:38.720
 but there's empirical fact that we're still alive

30:38.720 --> 30:40.240
 as a human civilization.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.080
 And also in the game theoretic sense,

30:43.080 --> 30:47.160
 do we model individual leaders and their relationships?

30:47.160 --> 30:51.180
 Do we, the staff, the generals,

30:51.180 --> 30:56.180
 or do we also have to model the culture, the people,

30:57.200 --> 31:00.420
 the suffering of the people, the economic frustration

31:00.420 --> 31:02.560
 or the anger or the distrust?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.140
 Do you have to model all those things?

31:04.140 --> 31:06.080
 Do they come into play?

31:06.080 --> 31:09.800
 And sometimes, I mean, again, we could be romanticizing

31:09.800 --> 31:12.040
 those things from a historical perspective,

31:12.040 --> 31:13.240
 but when you look at history

31:13.240 --> 31:15.760
 and you look at the way wars start,

31:15.760 --> 31:20.200
 it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding

31:20.200 --> 31:23.960
 escalates, escalates, escalates,

31:23.960 --> 31:28.240
 and just builds on top of itself

31:28.240 --> 31:30.320
 and all of a sudden it's an all out war.

31:30.320 --> 31:35.200
 It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.960
 So, I mean, you're absolutely right in the sense

31:38.960 --> 31:42.040
 that it's totally possible to oversimplify these things

31:42.040 --> 31:44.160
 and take the game theory too seriously.

31:44.160 --> 31:49.160
 And some, and people who study those things

31:49.240 --> 31:52.320
 and write those models and people like me who use them

31:52.320 --> 31:54.200
 can sometimes make that mistake.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.440
 I think that's not the mistake

31:55.440 --> 31:58.360
 that most people make most often.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.480
 And what's actually true is I think most people,

32:00.480 --> 32:01.680
 we're actually really quick,

32:01.680 --> 32:05.040
 whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq,

32:05.040 --> 32:07.040
 we're really quick to blame that

32:07.040 --> 32:10.260
 on the humanness and the culture.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.280
 So we're really quick to say,

32:11.280 --> 32:14.840
 oh, this was George W. Bush's

32:14.840 --> 32:17.160
 either desire for revenge and vengeance

32:17.160 --> 32:20.760
 or some private agenda or blood for oil.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.560
 So we're really quick to blame it on these things.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.560
 And then we're really,

32:25.560 --> 32:30.240
 we tend to overlook the strategic incentives to attack,

32:30.240 --> 32:31.600
 which I think were probably dominant.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.840
 I think those things might've been true to a degree,

32:33.840 --> 32:36.400
 but I don't think they were enough to ever

32:36.400 --> 32:37.520
 bring those wars about.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.240
 Just like, I think people are very quick to sort of,

32:40.240 --> 32:44.240
 in this current invasion to sort of talk about

32:44.240 --> 32:49.240
 Putin's grand visions of being the next Catherine the Great

32:50.280 --> 32:55.280
 or nationalist ideals and the mistakes

32:55.280 --> 32:57.440
 and the miscalculations are really quick to sort of say,

32:57.440 --> 33:00.000
 oh, that must be, and then kind of pause or not pause,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.440
 but maybe even stop there

33:01.440 --> 33:05.080
 and not see some of the strategic incentives.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.960
 And so, I guess we have to do both,

33:08.960 --> 33:12.120
 but the strategic, I guess I would say like the war

33:12.120 --> 33:13.680
 is just such a big problem.

33:13.680 --> 33:18.600
 It's just so costly that the strategic incentives

33:18.600 --> 33:21.200
 and the things that game theory has given us

33:21.200 --> 33:23.720
 are like really important in understanding

33:23.720 --> 33:27.480
 why there was so little room for negotiation and a bargain

33:27.480 --> 33:31.280
 that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter

33:31.280 --> 33:35.360
 or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions

33:35.360 --> 33:37.120
 or vengeance actually matters.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.640
 Cause those do matter, but they only matter

33:39.640 --> 33:43.880
 when the capacity to find a deal is so narrow

33:43.880 --> 33:45.160
 because of the circumstances.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.640
 And so let's not, it's sort of like saying

33:48.640 --> 33:52.880
 like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?

33:52.880 --> 33:55.600
 Pneumonia killed them, obviously,

33:55.600 --> 33:58.760
 but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.280
 All of the fundamentals and the circumstances

34:01.280 --> 34:02.840
 were like made them very fragile.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.340
 And that's how I think all the strategic forces

34:05.340 --> 34:07.980
 make that situation fragile.

34:07.980 --> 34:09.880
 And then the miscalculations

34:09.880 --> 34:11.560
 and all of these things you just said,

34:11.560 --> 34:13.760
 which are so important are kind of like the pneumonia.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.400
 And let's sort of, let's pay attention to both.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.000
 And you're saying that people don't disproportionately

34:19.000 --> 34:20.440
 pay attention to the leaders.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.280
 It's hard.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.640
 I mean, it wasn't,

34:22.640 --> 34:26.760
 it took me a long time to learn to recognize them.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.640
 And it takes many people, you know,

34:28.640 --> 34:31.600
 it took and it took generations of social scientists

34:33.040 --> 34:35.760
 years and years to figure some of this out

34:35.760 --> 34:37.600
 and to sort of help people understand it

34:37.600 --> 34:38.960
 and clarify concepts.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.240
 So it's not, it's just not that easy.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.080
 No, it's not hard.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.320
 I think it's possible to,

34:43.320 --> 34:45.600
 just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book

34:45.600 --> 34:47.280
 in graduate school or from reading

34:47.280 --> 34:49.800
 and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff,

34:49.800 --> 34:50.960
 but it's still really hard.

34:50.960 --> 34:55.160
 And so that's kind of what I was trying to do

34:55.160 --> 34:57.480
 is like close that gap and just make it,

34:57.480 --> 35:02.040
 help people recognize these things in the wild.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.440
 Before we zoom back out,

35:03.440 --> 35:06.520
 let me at a high level first ask,

35:06.520 --> 35:09.480
 what are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?

35:09.480 --> 35:12.600
 How do you analyze it within your framework about war?

35:12.600 --> 35:14.040
 A Russian colleague of mine,

35:14.040 --> 35:15.560
 Konstantin Sonin tells this story

35:15.560 --> 35:18.240
 about a visiting Ukrainian professor

35:18.240 --> 35:19.080
 who's at the university.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.280
 And one night he's walking down the street

35:21.280 --> 35:25.040
 and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason

35:25.040 --> 35:29.280
 and a mugger stops him and demands the phones.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.200
 And it's sort of like dead pan way, Konstantin says,

35:32.200 --> 35:34.720
 and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight.

35:35.840 --> 35:39.800
 And I think that's a little bit like what happened.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.200
 Most of us in that situation would hand over cell phones.

35:43.200 --> 35:47.200
 And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger

35:47.200 --> 35:49.680
 and the Ukrainian people are being asked

35:49.680 --> 35:51.880
 to hand over this thing and they're saying,

35:51.880 --> 35:54.120
 no, we're not gonna hand this over.

35:54.120 --> 35:59.120
 And the fact is most people do.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.720
 Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant

36:02.720 --> 36:07.560
 or an autocrat or a murderous warlord who says,

36:07.560 --> 36:09.360
 hand this over, they hand it over.

36:09.360 --> 36:14.360
 And that's why there are so many unequal

36:14.360 --> 36:16.120
 imperial relationships in the world.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.040
 That's what empire is.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.840
 Empire is success of people saying,

36:19.840 --> 36:22.480
 fine, we'll give up our some degree of freedom

36:22.480 --> 36:24.360
 or sovereignty because you're too powerful.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.880
 And the Ukrainian said, no way, this is just too precious.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.480
 And so I said, one of those buckets were that

36:30.480 --> 36:32.240
 there's a set of values.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.240
 There's sometimes there's something that we value

36:35.240 --> 36:37.280
 that is so valuable to us and important.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.360
 Sometimes it's terrible, sometimes it's the extermination

36:40.360 --> 36:43.620
 of another people, but sometimes it's something noble

36:43.620 --> 36:46.840
 like liberty or refusal to part with sovereignty.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.960
 And in those circumstances, people will decide

36:49.960 --> 36:52.280
 I will endure the costs.

36:52.280 --> 36:55.400
 They probably, I mean, I think they knew

36:55.400 --> 36:57.000
 what they were probably risking.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.740
 And so to me, that's not to blame the Ukrainians

37:00.740 --> 37:03.240
 any more than I would blame Americans

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
 for the American Revolution.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.920
 It's actually a very similar story.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.320
 You had a tyrannical, militarily superior,

37:11.840 --> 37:15.560
 pretty non democratic entity come and say,

37:15.560 --> 37:17.400
 you're gonna have partial sovereignty.

37:18.400 --> 37:23.120
 And Americans for ideological reasons said, no way.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.500
 And that people like Bernard Bailyn and other historians,

37:25.500 --> 37:27.520
 that's like the dominant story of the American Revolution.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.160
 It was the ideological origins,

37:29.160 --> 37:30.600
 this attachment, this idea of liberty.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.160
 And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons

37:33.160 --> 37:36.640
 I think why this happened, but I think for me,

37:36.640 --> 37:40.960
 it starts with Ukrainians failing to make that sensible

37:40.960 --> 37:45.960
 quote unquote rational deal that says we should relinquish

37:46.080 --> 37:47.720
 some of our sovereignty because Russia

37:47.720 --> 37:49.160
 is more powerful than we are.

37:50.880 --> 37:55.700
 So there's a very clinical look at the war.

37:56.840 --> 38:01.000
 Meaning there is a man and a country,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
 Vladimir Putin, that makes a claim on a land,

38:06.000 --> 38:10.080
 builds up troops and invades.

38:10.080 --> 38:15.080
 The way to avoid suffering there and the way to avoid death

38:17.040 --> 38:22.040
 and a way to avoid war is to back down

38:23.080 --> 38:28.080
 and basically let, there's a list of interests he provides

38:28.320 --> 38:30.120
 and you go along with that.

38:30.120 --> 38:35.120
 So that's when the goal is to avoid war.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.360
 Let's do some other calculus.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.140
 Let's think about Britain.

38:43.140 --> 38:48.140
 So France fought Hitler but did not fight very hard.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.280
 Portugal, there's a lot of stories of countries like this.

38:52.280 --> 38:57.280
 And there is Winston motherfucking Churchill.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.760
 He's one of the rare humans in history

39:00.760 --> 39:03.920
 who had that we shall fight on the beaches.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.840
 It made no sense.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.560
 Hitler did not say he's going to destroy Britain.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.800
 He seemed to show respect for Britain.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.460
 He wanted to keep the British Empire.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.560
 It made total sense.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.560
 It was obvious that Britain was going to lose

39:18.560 --> 39:20.160
 if Hitler goes all in on Britain

39:20.160 --> 39:22.080
 as it seemed like he was going to.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.100
 And yet Winston Churchill said a big F you.

39:26.100 --> 39:31.100
 Yeah, similar thing, Zelensky and the Ukrainian people

39:31.140 --> 39:33.660
 said F you in that same kind of way.

39:33.660 --> 39:36.000
 So I think we're saying the same things.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.640
 I'm being more clinical about it.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.880
 Well, I'm trying to understand and we won't know this

39:43.900 --> 39:48.720
 but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?

39:49.840 --> 39:51.680
 Well, on the eve of the war,

39:51.680 --> 39:54.040
 Ukraine was poorer in the per person terms

39:54.040 --> 39:55.440
 than it was in 1990.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.320
 The economy is just completely stagnated.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.960
 And Russia, meanwhile, like many other parts of the region,

40:00.960 --> 40:03.240
 sort of has boomed to a degree.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.700
 I mean, certainly because of oil and gas

40:04.700 --> 40:07.460
 but also for a variety of other reasons

40:07.460 --> 40:10.560
 and Putin's consolidated political control.

40:10.560 --> 40:14.680
 And from a very cold blooded and calculated point of view,

40:14.680 --> 40:18.120
 I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this is says,

40:18.120 --> 40:19.480
 look, we were temporarily weak

40:19.480 --> 40:22.600
 after the fall of the Iron Curtain

40:22.600 --> 40:25.360
 and the rest in the West basically took advantage

40:25.360 --> 40:27.620
 of that like Bravo, you pulled it off,

40:27.620 --> 40:30.120
 you basically crept democracy and capitalism,

40:30.120 --> 40:32.560
 all these things right up to our border.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.480
 And now we have regained some of our strength.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.260
 We've consolidated political control,

40:37.260 --> 40:40.920
 we've count our people, we have a stronger economy

40:40.920 --> 40:44.460
 and we somehow got Germany and other European nations

40:44.460 --> 40:47.000
 to give up energy independence and actually just,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.080
 we've got an enormous amount of leverage over you.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.600
 And now we wanna roll back some of your success

40:52.600 --> 40:55.800
 because we were powerful enough to demand it.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.400
 And you've been taking advantage of the situation

40:59.400 --> 41:04.120
 which is maybe a fair impartial analysis.

41:04.120 --> 41:08.320
 And in the West, but more specifically Ukraine said,

41:08.320 --> 41:11.720
 but that's a price too high, which I totally respect.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.360
 Maybe I'd like to think I'd make that same decision

41:15.360 --> 41:17.600
 but that's the answer.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.200
 If the answer is why would they fight if it's so costly?

41:20.200 --> 41:21.400
 Why not find a deal?

41:21.400 --> 41:24.840
 It's because they weren't willing to give Russia the thing

41:24.840 --> 41:28.300
 that their power said they quote unquote deserve.

41:28.300 --> 41:30.440
 Just like Americans said to the Britain,

41:30.440 --> 41:34.080
 yeah, of course we ought to accept semi sovereignty

41:35.960 --> 41:40.960
 but we refuse and we'd rather endure a bloody fight

41:42.040 --> 41:45.080
 that we might lose than take this.

41:45.080 --> 41:49.080
 And so you need some of these other five buckets,

41:49.080 --> 41:50.840
 you need them to understand the situation,

41:50.840 --> 41:54.060
 you need to sort of, there are other things going on

41:54.060 --> 41:55.800
 but I do think it's fundamental

41:55.800 --> 42:00.800
 that this noble intransigence is a big part of it.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.320
 Well, let me just say a few things if it's okay.

42:06.320 --> 42:11.320
 So your analysis is clear and objective.

42:12.840 --> 42:16.960
 My analysis is neither clear nor objective.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.960
 First, I've been going through a lot.

42:22.620 --> 42:25.740
 I'm a different man over the past four or five weeks

42:25.740 --> 42:26.840
 than I was before.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.760
 I in general have come to, there's anger.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.180
 I've come to despise leaders in general

42:38.980 --> 42:40.580
 because leaders wage war

42:40.580 --> 42:42.640
 and the people pay the price for that war.

42:42.640 --> 42:47.640
 Let me just say on this point of standing up to an invader

42:49.560 --> 42:52.800
 that I am half Ukrainian, half Russian,

42:52.800 --> 42:55.320
 that I'm proud of the Ukrainian people.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.320
 Whatever the sacrifice is, whatever the scale of pain,

43:00.320 --> 43:03.680
 standing up, there's something in me that's proud.

43:03.680 --> 43:08.680
 Maybe that's whatever the fuck that is.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.660
 Maybe that blood runs in me.

43:10.660 --> 43:15.620
 I love the Ukrainian people, I love the Russian people.

43:15.620 --> 43:18.740
 And whatever that fight is, whatever that suffering is,

43:18.740 --> 43:22.100
 the millions of refugees, whatever this war is,

43:22.100 --> 43:26.140
 the dictators come to power and their power falls.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.700
 I just love that that spirit burns bright still.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.140
 And I do, maybe I'm wrong in this,

43:34.140 --> 43:37.820
 do see Ukrainian and Russian people as one people

43:37.820 --> 43:41.340
 in a way that's not just cultural, geopolitical,

43:41.340 --> 43:43.220
 but just given the history.

43:43.220 --> 43:48.020
 I think about the same kind of fighting when Hitler

43:48.020 --> 43:52.260
 with all of his forces chose to invade the Soviet Union,

43:52.260 --> 43:57.260
 Operation Barbarossa, when he went in that Russian winter.

43:58.500 --> 44:02.180
 And a lot of people, and that pisses me off

44:02.180 --> 44:05.060
 because if you know your history,

44:05.060 --> 44:08.060
 it's not the winter that stopped Hitler,

44:08.060 --> 44:11.700
 it's the Red Army, it's the people that refused

44:11.700 --> 44:14.800
 to back down, they fought proudly.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.060
 That pride, that's something.

44:18.060 --> 44:20.140
 That's the human spirit.

44:20.140 --> 44:23.580
 That's in war, you know, war is hell,

44:23.580 --> 44:28.380
 but it really pushes people to stand

44:28.380 --> 44:30.220
 for the things they believe in.

44:30.220 --> 44:33.240
 It's the William Wallace speech from Braveheart.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.020
 I think about this a lot.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.020
 That does not fit into your framework.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.540
 No, no, no, I'm gonna disagree.

44:38.540 --> 44:41.660
 I think it totally fits in and it's this,

44:41.660 --> 44:45.140
 there's nothing irrational about what we believe,

44:45.140 --> 44:50.140
 especially those principles which we hold the most dear.

44:50.420 --> 44:53.540
 I'm merely trying to say that there's a calculus,

44:53.540 --> 44:56.780
 there's one calculus over here that says

44:56.780 --> 45:00.060
 Russia's more powerful than it was 20 years ago

45:00.060 --> 45:02.960
 and even 10 years ago and Ukraine is not.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.240
 And it's asking for something

45:05.240 --> 45:08.060
 and there's an incentive to give that up.

45:08.060 --> 45:10.700
 That's obvious, like there's an incentive to comply.

45:10.700 --> 45:14.740
 But my understanding is many of these post Soviet republics

45:14.740 --> 45:17.700
 have appeased, right, which is what we call compromise

45:17.700 --> 45:19.140
 when we disagree with it.

45:19.140 --> 45:21.860
 They've, all of these other peoples

45:21.860 --> 45:25.740
 in the Russians here of influence have not stood up.

45:26.900 --> 45:29.800
 And Russians, many Russians have tried to stand up

45:29.800 --> 45:31.300
 and they've been beaten down.

45:31.300 --> 45:35.360
 And now people have, we'll see,

45:35.360 --> 45:38.040
 but people have not been standing up very much.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.520
 And so lots of people are cowed

45:40.520 --> 45:41.880
 and lots of people have appeased

45:41.880 --> 45:43.960
 and lots of people hear that speech

45:43.960 --> 45:47.300
 and think I would like to do that, but don't.

45:47.300 --> 45:51.780
 And so, and my point is that sadly we live in a world

45:51.780 --> 45:54.960
 where a lot of people get stepped on

45:54.960 --> 45:59.280
 by tyrants and empire and whatnot and don't rise up.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.680
 And so I think we could admire,

46:01.680 --> 46:04.800
 especially when they stand up for these reasons.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.720
 And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.760
 I think we could, that's why we admire

46:08.760 --> 46:11.040
 the leaders of the American Revolution and so on,

46:11.040 --> 46:12.160
 but it doesn't always happen.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.880
 And I don't actually know why,

46:13.880 --> 46:15.120
 but I don't think it's irrational.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.880
 I think it's just, it's something,

46:16.880 --> 46:20.120
 it's about a set of values and it's hard to predict.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.120
 And it was hard for,

46:23.080 --> 46:24.980
 Putin might not have been out of line

46:24.980 --> 46:27.360
 in thinking just like everybody else

46:27.360 --> 46:30.160
 in my sphere of influence, they're gonna roll over too.

46:31.360 --> 46:34.680
 And I should mention because we haven't,

46:34.680 --> 46:37.520
 that a lot of this calculation

46:37.520 --> 46:39.560
 from an objective point of view,

46:39.560 --> 46:42.960
 you have to include United States and NATO

46:42.960 --> 46:45.280
 into the pressure they apply into the region.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.400
 Yeah.

46:46.400 --> 46:50.500
 That said, I care little about leaders

46:50.500 --> 46:54.060
 that do cruel things onto the world.

46:54.060 --> 46:55.580
 They lead to a lot of suffering,

46:55.580 --> 46:57.800
 but I still believe that the Russian people

46:57.800 --> 47:00.720
 and the Ukrainian people are great people that stand up

47:00.720 --> 47:03.140
 and I admire people that stand up

47:03.140 --> 47:05.380
 and are willing to give their life.

47:05.380 --> 47:09.380
 And I think Russian people are very much that too,

47:11.600 --> 47:15.520
 especially when the enemy is coming

47:15.520 --> 47:17.680
 for your home over the hill.

47:17.680 --> 47:21.440
 Sometimes standing up to an authoritarian regime

47:21.440 --> 47:24.180
 is difficult because you don't know.

47:24.180 --> 47:29.180
 It's not a monster that's attacking your home directly.

47:30.740 --> 47:33.100
 It's kind of like the boiling of a lobster

47:33.100 --> 47:34.500
 or something like that.

47:34.500 --> 47:39.220
 It's a slow control of your mind and the population.

47:39.220 --> 47:42.180
 And our minds get controlled even in the West

47:42.180 --> 47:44.500
 by the media, by the narratives.

47:44.500 --> 47:47.140
 It's very difficult to wake up one day

47:47.140 --> 47:52.140
 and to realize sort of what people call red pilled,

47:52.140 --> 47:56.460
 is to see that maybe the thing I've been told

47:56.460 --> 47:58.940
 all my life is not true at every level.

47:58.940 --> 48:01.660
 That's a thing very difficult to do in North Korea.

48:01.660 --> 48:04.040
 The more authoritarian the regime,

48:04.040 --> 48:06.420
 the more difficult it is to see.

48:06.420 --> 48:09.420
 Maybe this idea that I believe

48:09.420 --> 48:11.540
 that I was willing to die for is actually evil.

48:11.540 --> 48:14.220
 It's very difficult to do for Americans,

48:14.220 --> 48:16.980
 for Russians, for Ukrainians, for Chinese,

48:16.980 --> 48:20.500
 for Indians, for Pakistanis, for everybody.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.260
 I think thinking about this Ukrainian,

48:23.260 --> 48:25.180
 whether you want to call it nobility or intransigence

48:25.180 --> 48:27.440
 or whatever is key.

48:27.440 --> 48:32.260
 I think the authoritarianness of Russia

48:32.260 --> 48:34.500
 and Putin's control or the control of his cabal

48:34.500 --> 48:37.300
 is the other thing I would really point to

48:37.300 --> 48:38.440
 is what's going on here.

48:38.440 --> 48:41.220
 And if you asked me like big picture,

48:41.220 --> 48:42.700
 what do I think is the fundamental cause

48:42.700 --> 48:43.860
 of most violence in the world?

48:43.860 --> 48:45.540
 I think it's unaccountable power.

48:45.540 --> 48:47.920
 I think, in fact, for me an unaccountable power

48:47.920 --> 48:49.300
 is the source of underdevelopment.

48:49.300 --> 48:51.860
 It's the source of pain and suffering.

48:51.860 --> 48:53.980
 It's the source of warfare.

48:53.980 --> 48:57.220
 It's basically the root source of most of our problems.

48:57.220 --> 48:59.660
 And in this particular case,

48:59.660 --> 49:03.100
 it's also one of our buckets in the sense that like why,

49:03.100 --> 49:07.200
 what is it that, why did Russia ask these things?

49:07.200 --> 49:11.820
 Like, well, was democracy in Ukraine

49:11.820 --> 49:13.700
 a threat to an average Russian?

49:13.700 --> 49:17.900
 No, was capitalism, is NATO, is whatever,

49:17.900 --> 49:19.660
 is this a threat to average Russians?

49:19.660 --> 49:24.660
 No, it's a threat to the apparatus of political control

49:25.060 --> 49:27.620
 and economic control that Putin and cronies

49:27.620 --> 49:30.300
 and this sort of group of people that rule,

49:30.300 --> 49:34.660
 this elite in Russia, it was a threat to them.

49:34.660 --> 49:38.340
 And so they had to ask the Ukraine to be neutral

49:38.340 --> 49:41.600
 or to give up NATO or to have a puppet government

49:41.600 --> 49:43.820
 or whatever they were seeking to achieve

49:43.820 --> 49:45.740
 and have been trying to achieve through other means

49:45.740 --> 49:47.300
 for decades, right?

49:47.300 --> 49:49.660
 They've been trying to undermine these things

49:49.660 --> 49:52.620
 without invasion.

49:52.620 --> 49:53.900
 And they've been doing that

49:53.900 --> 49:55.500
 because it threatens their interests.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.300
 And that's like one of these other logics of war.

49:57.300 --> 49:59.260
 It's not just that there's something that I value so much

49:59.260 --> 50:00.580
 that I'm willing to endure the cost.

50:00.580 --> 50:03.980
 It's that there are people not only do,

50:03.980 --> 50:06.060
 does this oligarchy or whatever elite group

50:06.060 --> 50:07.820
 that you wanna talk about in Russia,

50:07.820 --> 50:10.060
 not, first of all, they're not bearing,

50:10.060 --> 50:11.420
 they're bearing some costs of war, right?

50:11.420 --> 50:12.980
 They're very, and they're certainly bearing

50:12.980 --> 50:17.220
 the cost of sanctions, but they are, they don't bear

50:17.220 --> 50:18.580
 all the costs of war, obviously.

50:18.580 --> 50:20.280
 And so they're more, they're quick to use it.

50:20.280 --> 50:24.020
 But more importantly, like in some sense,

50:24.020 --> 50:25.620
 I think there's a strong argument

50:25.620 --> 50:28.380
 that they had a political incentive to invade

50:28.380 --> 50:30.420
 and, or at least to ask Ukraine,

50:30.420 --> 50:32.540
 this sort of impossible to give up thing,

50:32.540 --> 50:37.540
 and then invade despite Ukrainian nobility and transigence

50:38.260 --> 50:39.780
 because they were threatened.

50:39.780 --> 50:44.780
 And so that's extremely important, I think.

50:45.100 --> 50:48.940
 And so that's, those two things in concert

50:48.940 --> 50:50.780
 make this a very fragile situation.

50:50.780 --> 50:53.860
 That's, I think, why we ended up is,

50:53.860 --> 50:57.020
 go not all the way, but a long way to understanding.

50:57.020 --> 51:00.300
 Now you could layer onto that these intangible incentives,

51:00.300 --> 51:01.780
 these other things that are valued,

51:01.780 --> 51:03.280
 that are valued on Putin's side.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.820
 Maybe there's a nationalist ideal.

51:04.820 --> 51:08.180
 Maybe he seeks status and glory.

51:08.180 --> 51:09.300
 Like maybe those things are all true.

51:09.300 --> 51:11.900
 And I'm sure they're true to an extent.

51:11.900 --> 51:14.560
 And that'll weigh against his cost of war as well.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.660
 But fundamentally, I think he just saw

51:16.660 --> 51:18.560
 his regime as threatened.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.140
 That's what he cares about.

51:20.140 --> 51:25.140
 And so he asked, he made this cruelest of demands.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.660
 I mean, I would say I'm just one human, who the hell am I?

51:28.660 --> 51:33.660
 But I just have a lot of anger towards the elites in general,

51:34.520 --> 51:38.820
 towards leaders in general that fail the people.

51:38.820 --> 51:43.820
 I would love to hear and to celebrate

51:44.100 --> 51:47.780
 the beautiful Russian people, the Ukrainian people,

51:47.780 --> 51:52.420
 and anyone who silences that beautiful voice of the people,

51:52.420 --> 51:55.940
 anywhere in the world, is destroying the thing

51:55.940 --> 51:59.020
 that I value most about humanity.

51:59.020 --> 52:00.060
 Leaders don't matter.

52:00.060 --> 52:02.480
 They're supposed to serve the people.

52:02.480 --> 52:07.060
 This nationalist idea of a people, of a country,

52:07.060 --> 52:10.260
 is only makes any sense when you celebrate,

52:10.260 --> 52:15.260
 when you give people the freedom to show themselves,

52:16.580 --> 52:18.380
 to celebrate themselves.

52:18.380 --> 52:21.740
 The thing I care most about is science

52:21.740 --> 52:26.740
 and the silencing of voices in the scientific community,

52:26.900 --> 52:28.840
 the silencing of voices, period.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.840
 And fuck any leader that silences that human spirit.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.800
 There's something about this.

52:39.800 --> 52:42.160
 Like, whenever I look at World War II,

52:42.160 --> 52:44.280
 whenever I look at wars,

52:44.280 --> 52:46.560
 it does seem very irrational to fight.

52:47.400 --> 52:52.400
 But man, does it seem somehow deeply human

52:52.660 --> 52:54.920
 when the people stand up and fight.

52:54.920 --> 52:59.920
 There's something, you know, we talked about progress.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.880
 That feels like how progress is made,

53:03.880 --> 53:05.560
 the people that stand and fight.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.360
 But let me read the Churchill speech.

53:08.560 --> 53:12.320
 It's such, I'm so proud that we humans

53:12.320 --> 53:14.880
 can stand up to evil when the time is right.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.680
 I guess here's the thing, though.

53:16.680 --> 53:18.480
 Think of what's happening in Xinjiang in China.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.520
 We have appeased China.

53:21.520 --> 53:25.920
 We've basically said, you can just do really, really,

53:25.920 --> 53:27.880
 really horrible things in this region,

53:27.880 --> 53:30.440
 and you're too powerful for us to do anything about it,

53:30.440 --> 53:32.040
 and it's not worth it.

53:32.040 --> 53:35.760
 And there's nobody standing up and making a Churchill speech

53:35.760 --> 53:38.180
 or the Braveheart speech about standing up

53:38.180 --> 53:41.440
 for people of Xinjiang when what's happening is,

53:42.720 --> 53:47.480
 you know, in that realm of what was happening in Europe.

53:47.480 --> 53:50.640
 And that's happening in a lot of places.

53:50.640 --> 53:53.680
 And then when there is a willingness to stand up,

53:55.560 --> 53:58.960
 people, there's a lot of opposition to those, you know.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.680
 So there were a lot of reasons for the invasion of Iraq.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.360
 For some, it was a humanitarian thing,

54:04.360 --> 54:08.480
 like Saddam Hussein was one of the worst tyrants

54:08.480 --> 54:10.600
 of the 20th century.

54:10.600 --> 54:14.240
 He was just doing some really horrible things.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.880
 You know, he'd invaded Kuwait.

54:15.880 --> 54:20.260
 He'd, you know, attempted domestic genocide

54:20.260 --> 54:21.880
 and all sorts of repression,

54:21.880 --> 54:25.000
 and it was probably a mistake to invade in spite.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.360
 So it's important not just to select on the cases

54:27.360 --> 54:29.640
 where we stood up and to select on the cases

54:29.640 --> 54:34.400
 where that ended up working out in the sense of victory.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.480
 Right, it's important to sort of try to judge,

54:38.480 --> 54:40.700
 not judge, but just try to understand these things

54:40.700 --> 54:45.160
 in the context of all the times we didn't give that speech

54:45.160 --> 54:48.080
 or when we did, and then it just went sideways.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.520
 Well, that's why it's powerful

54:50.520 --> 54:52.880
 when you're willing to give your life for your principles

54:52.880 --> 54:54.600
 because most of the time,

54:54.600 --> 54:58.400
 you get neither the principles nor the life.

54:58.400 --> 54:59.720
 You get, you die.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.320
 That's what, but that's why it's powerful.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.560
 We shall go on to the end.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.360
 We shall fight in France.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.840
 We shall fight on the seas and the oceans.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.800
 We shall fight with growing confidence

55:10.800 --> 55:12.600
 and growing strength in the air.

55:12.600 --> 55:16.160
 We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.020
 We shall fight on the beaches.

55:18.020 --> 55:20.320
 We shall fight on the landing grounds.

55:20.320 --> 55:23.480
 We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.320
 We shall fight in the hills.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.200
 We shall never surrender.

55:27.200 --> 55:32.200
 This is before Hitler had any major loss to anybody.

55:33.060 --> 55:36.260
 That was a terrifying armada coming your way.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.880
 We shall never surrender.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.320
 I just wanna give props.

55:40.320 --> 55:44.680
 I wanna give my respect as a human being to Churchill,

55:44.680 --> 55:48.120
 to the British people for standing up,

55:48.120 --> 55:51.120
 to the Ukrainian people for standing up,

55:51.120 --> 55:53.920
 and to the Russian people.

55:53.920 --> 55:57.680
 These are great people that throughout history

55:57.680 --> 55:59.720
 have stood up to evil.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.640
 Let me ask you this because you quote Sun Tzu

56:03.640 --> 56:05.480
 in The Art of War.

56:05.480 --> 56:06.960
 There's no instance of a country

56:06.960 --> 56:09.500
 having benefited from prolonged warfare.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.840
 This is the main thesis.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.840
 Can we just linger on this?

56:14.840 --> 56:18.320
 Since leaders wage war and people pay the price,

56:18.320 --> 56:21.860
 when we say that there's no reason to do prolonged war,

56:22.700 --> 56:25.040
 is it possible to have a reason for the leaders

56:25.040 --> 56:26.980
 if they disregard the price?

56:26.980 --> 56:31.980
 Sort of like if they have a different objective function

56:32.040 --> 56:34.020
 or utility function that measures the price

56:34.020 --> 56:35.360
 that's paid for war.

56:35.360 --> 56:39.500
 Is that one explanation of why war happens?

56:39.500 --> 56:41.460
 Is the leaders just have a different calculus

56:41.460 --> 56:43.020
 than other humans?

56:43.020 --> 56:44.260
 I mean, I think this links us back

56:44.260 --> 56:46.260
 to what we were talking about earlier about just war.

56:46.260 --> 56:49.540
 Is in some sense, just war is saying

56:49.540 --> 56:51.540
 that in spite of the costs,

56:51.540 --> 56:54.700
 that our enemy has done something,

56:54.700 --> 56:58.020
 our opponent has refused to compromise

56:58.020 --> 57:00.540
 on something that we find essential

57:00.540 --> 57:03.300
 and is demanding that we compromise

57:03.300 --> 57:05.380
 in a way that's completely repugnant.

57:06.540 --> 57:09.220
 And therefore, we're going to go to war

57:09.220 --> 57:13.340
 despite these material costs and these human costs.

57:13.340 --> 57:16.780
 So that, and that's, and then that principle

57:16.780 --> 57:18.820
 that you go to war on is in the eye of the beholder.

57:18.820 --> 57:21.960
 And I mean, I think liberty and sovereignty,

57:21.960 --> 57:23.740
 I think we can understand and sympathize with,

57:23.740 --> 57:25.460
 and maybe that's just a universal,

57:25.460 --> 57:27.480
 maybe that's the greatest cause of just war,

57:27.480 --> 57:30.760
 but other people make that, could go to war

57:30.760 --> 57:32.100
 for something considerably less,

57:32.100 --> 57:34.580
 a principle that's considerably less noble, right?

57:34.580 --> 57:36.140
 Which is what Hitler was doing.

57:36.140 --> 57:39.380
 So that's an explanation.

57:39.380 --> 57:41.760
 So that's a whole class of explanations

57:41.760 --> 57:44.000
 that helps us understand that the compromise

57:44.000 --> 57:46.300
 that was on the table, given the relative balance of power,

57:46.300 --> 57:49.060
 was just repugnant at least to one side, if not the other.

57:49.060 --> 57:51.140
 There's something they're unwilling to part with.

57:51.140 --> 57:53.220
 And then you get to the leaders.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.260
 Well, what happens when what the leaders want,

57:57.460 --> 57:58.980
 what happens when the leaders are detached

57:58.980 --> 58:00.200
 from the interests of their groups,

58:00.200 --> 58:02.300
 which has been true for basically most of human history.

58:02.300 --> 58:04.620
 There's a narrow slice of societies

58:04.620 --> 58:06.540
 in the big scheme of things

58:06.540 --> 58:07.900
 that have been accountable to their people.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.380
 A lot of them exist today,

58:11.680 --> 58:12.620
 where to some degree,

58:12.620 --> 58:15.500
 they're channeling the interests of their group, right?

58:15.500 --> 58:18.880
 So the Ukrainian politicians didn't concede

58:18.880 --> 58:21.020
 to these cruel Russian demands,

58:21.020 --> 58:22.100
 because even if they had,

58:22.100 --> 58:23.380
 it would have been political suicide,

58:23.380 --> 58:25.260
 because it seemed, or I think,

58:25.260 --> 58:26.520
 it seems that the Ukrainians

58:26.520 --> 58:28.180
 would have just rejected this.

58:28.180 --> 58:31.180
 So they were in some sense channeling the values

58:31.180 --> 58:34.380
 of the broader population, even if they,

58:34.380 --> 58:35.460
 I don't know what was going,

58:35.460 --> 58:38.260
 and if they didn't share those principles,

58:38.260 --> 58:40.880
 they self interestedly followed them.

58:40.880 --> 58:41.860
 Probably they shared them,

58:41.860 --> 58:43.860
 but I'm just saying that even if they didn't,

58:43.860 --> 58:45.200
 they wouldn't compromise.

58:46.580 --> 58:47.740
 Occasionally you get the reverse,

58:47.740 --> 58:50.320
 which is where the leaders are not accountable.

58:51.380 --> 58:54.180
 And now they have some value, which could be glory.

58:55.220 --> 58:56.660
 I mean, this is the story of the kings,

58:56.660 --> 58:59.220
 and to some lesser extent, the queens of Europe,

58:59.220 --> 59:02.220
 for hundreds of years, was it was basically a contest,

59:02.220 --> 59:04.180
 and it was, war was the sport of kings,

59:04.180 --> 59:06.500
 and to some extent, they were just seeking status

59:06.500 --> 59:08.620
 through violent competition,

59:08.620 --> 59:11.540
 and they paid a lot, a big price out of the royal purse,

59:11.540 --> 59:15.400
 but they didn't bear most of the suffering.

59:17.180 --> 59:19.780
 And so they were too quick to go to war.

59:19.780 --> 59:24.780
 And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders,

59:26.480 --> 59:29.180
 combined with, you mingle it with this,

59:29.180 --> 59:32.220
 that one bucket, that uncheckedness,

59:32.220 --> 59:33.500
 and you mingle that with the fact

59:33.500 --> 59:36.100
 that leaders might have one of these values,

59:36.100 --> 59:39.180
 noble or otherwise, that carry them to war,

59:39.180 --> 59:43.540
 combined to explain a good number of conflicts as well.

59:43.540 --> 59:47.260
 And that's a good illustration of why I think autocracy

59:47.260 --> 59:50.400
 and unaccountable power is,

59:51.360 --> 59:53.380
 I could make that story for all of the things,

59:53.380 --> 59:54.840
 all five buckets, they're all,

59:54.840 --> 59:56.940
 we're all more susceptible to these things,

59:56.940 --> 59:58.100
 to all five of these things,

59:58.100 --> 1:00:01.620
 when leaders are not accountable to the people

1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:02.700
 and their group.

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:05.920
 And that's what makes it like the meta,

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:08.300
 for me, the meta cause of conflict

1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:11.200
 in all of human history, and sadly, today.

1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:14.700
 Does the will to power play into this,

1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:16.280
 the desire for power?

1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:20.520
 Like, that's a human thing, again, in the calculation.

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.740
 That, shall we put that in the misperceptions bucket?

1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:27.780
 Or is it, is misperceptions essentially

1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:31.060
 about interaction between humans,

1:00:31.060 --> 1:00:35.260
 and power is more about the thing you feel in your heart

1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:37.880
 when you're alone as a leader?

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.480
 You know, I said there were three strategic reasons,

1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:41.580
 like the unchecked leaders,

1:00:41.580 --> 1:00:43.180
 the commitment problems, uncertainty.

1:00:43.180 --> 1:00:45.300
 There are two sort of more psychological,

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:47.440
 and I call them intangible incentives and misperceptions.

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:48.740
 The way that like a game theorist,

1:00:48.740 --> 1:00:50.780
 or the way that a behavioral economist would think

1:00:50.780 --> 1:00:53.040
 about those two is just to say preferences,

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:57.120
 and then erroneous beliefs and mistakes.

1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:00.260
 It's like, so our preferences are our preferences, right?

1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:02.980
 And so utility functions, whatever we want to call it,

1:01:02.980 --> 1:01:05.700
 like there's not, that's why I wouldn't call them

1:01:05.700 --> 1:01:07.620
 a misperception or rationality.

1:01:07.620 --> 1:01:09.700
 We want, we like what we like.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:12.820
 If we like power, if we like relative status,

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:17.820
 if we like, if we like our racial purity,

1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:19.620
 if we like our liberty, if we like,

1:01:19.620 --> 1:01:22.980
 whatever it is that we have convinced ourselves we value.

1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:25.560
 Maybe you fell in love with a rival queen, a king.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:26.400
 Exactly.

1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:29.300
 When I said it was a big bucket full of stuff that rhymes,

1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:31.440
 like that's a pretty messy bucket.

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.140
 Like there's a lot of different stuff in there.

1:01:33.140 --> 1:01:35.540
 And I'm just trying to say, like, let's be clear

1:01:36.540 --> 1:01:40.020
 that just about the shared logic of these things

1:01:40.020 --> 1:01:41.880
 is maybe just, you know, they're really dissimilar,

1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:44.180
 but let's be clear about the shared logic.

1:01:44.180 --> 1:01:46.800
 And if it were true that deep down,

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:49.100
 we were aggressive people who just liked violence

1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:52.660
 and enjoyed the blood, or some percentage of us do,

1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:53.860
 that would be there too.

1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:58.140
 And so I just want to say that's,

1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:02.440
 but you know, we're really quick to recognize those, right?

1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:05.520
 When we diagnose a war as an armchair analyst

1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:09.600
 or as a journalist or something, we really jump to those.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:13.100
 We don't need a lot of help to like see those happening.

1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:17.040
 So we probably put a little bit too much emphasis on them

1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:19.360
 is maybe the only thing that I would caution

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:21.000
 because the others are more subtle

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.940
 and they're often there and they contribute.

1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:27.880
 So just to link on something you said before,

1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:30.440
 would it be accurate to say when the leaders

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:35.440
 become detached from the opinion of the people,

1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:38.720
 is that's more likely to lead to war?

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:40.080
 So...

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:41.720
 And mechanically, it's just,

1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:43.320
 they're gonna bear fewer costs.

1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:47.400
 So it's gonna basically narrow the set of deals

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:50.320
 that they're gonna be willing to accept instead of violence.

1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:53.880
 At the same time, most of the time it's not enough

1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:56.360
 because the leaders still bear a lot of costs of war.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:59.020
 You could be deposed, you could be killed,

1:02:59.020 --> 1:03:00.580
 you could be tried,

1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:02.800
 and the public purse is going to be empty.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.580
 That's like the one story throughout history

1:03:04.580 --> 1:03:06.000
 is at the end of the day,

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.680
 your regime is broke as a result of war.

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.320
 And so you still internalize that a little bit.

1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:14.360
 If I had to say like, you know,

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:17.560
 in my three buckets or through my buckets so far,

1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:20.920
 I sort of started with like Ukrainian intransigence,

1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:22.800
 and then I jumped, and then I said the essentially,

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:25.360
 then you really have to understand Russian autocracy

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:29.320
 just to understand why they would ask something so cruel.

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.400
 But I mean, I think the uncertainty

1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.120
 is really important here as well.

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.800
 Like if you think of it, like think of all of the things,

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.420
 the way this has played out,

1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:40.160
 and just in some ways how many,

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:41.820
 in how many ways we've been surprised.

1:03:41.820 --> 1:03:44.320
 We've been surprised by the unity

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.600
 and the coherence of the West and the sanctions.

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:48.200
 That's sort of what's happened

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:49.760
 is it was in the realm of possibility,

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:51.760
 but it was sort of like the best case scenario

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.800
 from the perspective of the West

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:56.100
 and the worst case scenario for the Russians.

1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:58.120
 The second thing is just the pluckiness

1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:01.560
 and the effectiveness and the intransigence

1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:03.920
 and the nobility of this Ukrainian resistance.

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:06.900
 That's again, was within the realm of possibility,

1:04:06.900 --> 1:04:09.000
 but wasn't necessarily the likely thing, right?

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.460
 It was again, maybe the worst realization for Russia,

1:04:11.460 --> 1:04:13.160
 the best realization in some sense

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:16.820
 for in terms of revealed strength and resolve.

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:20.240
 And then the other thing that's been revealed

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:24.160
 is just how like the corruption and ineptitude

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:26.720
 and problems on the Russian military side.

1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:28.900
 Again, within the realm of possibility,

1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:30.720
 maybe people who really knew the Russian military

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.560
 are less surprised than the rest of us,

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:36.520
 but also one of the worst possible draws for Russia.

1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:41.400
 And so Putin asking this terrible price

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:45.040
 and expecting Ukraine to roll over

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:47.240
 or the West to roll over at least to a degree

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:52.800
 was based on like a different set of,

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:54.960
 was based on just expecting something

1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:56.720
 in the middle of the probability distribution

1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:59.200
 and not one of all these different tale events.

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:00.880
 And so the fact that the world's so uncertain

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:02.080
 and the fact that Putin can come

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:04.160
 with a different set of expectations

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:05.680
 than the Ukrainians and the West

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:09.960
 and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing

1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:11.680
 on just what the facts are

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:12.940
 because we live in an uncertain world.

1:05:12.940 --> 1:05:14.720
 Everyone's quick to say, oh, he miscalculated.

1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:17.040
 Well, I'm not, I don't know if he miscalculated.

1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:19.040
 I think he just, he got a really bad draw

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:23.240
 in terms of what the realized outcomes are here.

1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:27.200
 And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense,

1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:29.580
 except the fact that it's involving a lot of violence

1:05:29.580 --> 1:05:30.420
 is the tragedy.

1:05:30.420 --> 1:05:31.240
 So.

1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:32.640
 Well, there's also economic pain,

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:35.140
 not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people,

1:05:35.140 --> 1:05:37.240
 but the whole world.

1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:42.240
 So it, you know, you could talk about things

1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:47.080
 that we are surprised from an analysis perspective

1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:49.760
 of small victories here or there,

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:51.720
 but I think it's universally true

1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:55.600
 that everybody loses once again in this war.

1:05:55.600 --> 1:05:57.740
 Right, and so the question is just like,

1:05:57.740 --> 1:06:01.120
 when does it, you know, why did Russia choose to invade

1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:02.840
 when Ukraine didn't give this up?

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:07.440
 Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize

1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:10.520
 what it wanted, the available bargain that it deserved,

1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:13.680
 quote unquote, based on its power in the world,

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:16.800
 it wasn't getting, and so it thought it could take that.

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:19.580
 And the uncertainty around that made it

1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:22.120
 potentially more likely that he would choose to do this.

1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:24.480
 But in particular, one of the other things

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:27.220
 that I think is probably less important in this context,

1:06:27.220 --> 1:06:30.740
 but still plays a role, but less important than many wars,

1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:32.760
 is the fact that it's really hard to resolve

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.480
 that uncertainty, right?

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:37.120
 In theory, Ukraine should be able to say,

1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:40.640
 look, this is exactly how resolved we are,

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:43.960
 we're super resolved, and your military

1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:45.840
 is not as strong as you think it is.

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:47.920
 You mean before the conflict even begins?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:48.760
 Everybody should be like, you know what?

1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:52.200
 You lay on the table, here's my cards, here's your cards.

1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:55.080
 Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this,

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.000
 you can use that uncertainty to your advantage.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:00.320
 I can try to convince you, I can bluff, right?

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:02.160
 And so anyone who's ever played poker

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:05.280
 and bluffed or called a bluff, that's the inefficiency,

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:06.760
 that's the analogy in some ways to war.

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:08.120
 It's not the perfect analogy,

1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:10.460
 but the uncertainty and the circumstance,

1:07:10.460 --> 1:07:11.480
 you don't have to miscalculate.

1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:14.280
 The fact that if you bluff and lose,

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:16.200
 it doesn't mean that you miscalculated.

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:18.520
 You made an optimal choice, given the uncertainty

1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.180
 of the situation, to take a gamble.

1:07:20.180 --> 1:07:23.440
 And that was a wiser thing for you to do than to not bluff

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:28.440
 and just to fold or to just not ping in that round.

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:30.640
 And so the uncertainty of the situation

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.400
 gives both sides incentives to bluff,

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:35.200
 gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth.

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:36.960
 And then at some point, the other side says,

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:39.440
 you know what, you say you're resolved.

1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:41.440
 You say you're gonna mount an insurgency.

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:42.280
 Well, guess what?

1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:47.760
 Every other, you know, people on my border has folded

1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:52.040
 and you're gonna fold too, the minute the tanks roll in

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:53.520
 and the minute the Air Force comes in,

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:55.240
 I'm gambling that you're bluffing.

1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:00.240
 And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation

1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:05.280
 just causes a lot of short wars, actually,

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:09.640
 because it's this sort of bluff and call dynamic

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:10.600
 that goes on.

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.280
 And, you know, the thing that's worth thinking

1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:16.360
 is we might end up at a place in a few months

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:20.480
 where the thing that Ukraine concedes

1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:23.520
 is not so far from what Russia demanded in the first place.

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:26.880
 Russia's on it, I want a neutral,

1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:28.120
 I mean, who knows how,

1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:30.760
 it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted.

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:34.200
 But if we end up in a place where Ukraine

1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:37.880
 is effectively neutral, never joins NATO,

1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:42.080
 is not being militarily supplied by the West,

1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:47.080
 and where Russia has de facto control over the East

1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:49.000
 and Crimea, if not fully recognized,

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.520
 probably, who knows if they'll get ever internationally

1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:54.960
 and Ukrainian will recognize, but effectively controls,

1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:00.120
 Russia will have accomplished

1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:03.120
 what it asked for in the first place,

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:07.080
 and both parties had to get there through violence

1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:09.040
 rather than through negotiation.

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:12.080
 And you wouldn't need misperceptions and mistakes,

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:17.080
 and you wouldn't need Putin's delusions of glory

1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:18.480
 or whatever to get there,

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:20.240
 you would just need the ingredients

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:23.080
 I've given so far, which is like an unwillingness

1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.280
 to do that without fighting on the part of the Ukrainians,

1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:29.640
 an autocratic leadership in Russia

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:31.320
 who would make those demands

1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:32.760
 because it's in their self interest,

1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:36.640
 and then uncertainty leading them to fight.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.000
 And that sadly is like the best case,

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.400
 that feels like the best case scenario right now,

1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:50.400
 which is the war is just five months and not five years.

1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:51.920
 Given the current situation.

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:53.920
 Given the current situation.

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.400
 Because the suffering has already happened,

1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:00.400
 and lost homes, people moving,

1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:08.400
 having to see their home in rubble,

1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:12.400
 and millions of people, refugees having to escape the country,

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:21.400
 and hate flourishes versus the common humanity

1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.400
 as it does with war.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.400
 And on top of all of that,

1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:29.400
 if we talk from a geopolitical perspective,

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:36.400
 the warmongers all over the world are sort of drooling.

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:38.400
 They've now got narratives,

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.400
 and they got that whatever narratives,

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:43.400
 you can go shopping for the narratives.

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:45.400
 The United States has its narratives

1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:47.400
 for whatever geopolitical thing it wants to do

1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:50.400
 in that part of the world.

1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:53.400
 That's another little malevolent interaction

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:54.400
 between two of these buckets,

1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:55.400
 like those unchecked leaders,

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:58.400
 and those intangible incentives, those preferences,

1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:03.400
 is that unchecked leaders spend, autocrats, whatever,

1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:07.400
 spend enormous amounts of time trying to manipulate the values

1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:12.400
 and beliefs of their population, of their group.

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.400
 Now, sometimes they do it nobly,

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:16.400
 but that's what Winston Churchill there was trying to,

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:19.400
 it's not clear that Britains were ready to stand up.

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:20.400
 There were a lot of Americans and a lot of Britains

1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:22.400
 who were like, you know what?

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:24.400
 Hitler, not such a bad guy.

1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:25.400
 His idea is not so terrible.

1:11:25.400 --> 1:11:27.400
 I never liked those Jews anyways.

1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:28.400
 Many were thinking.

1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:30.400
 We had political leaders in the US

1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:33.400
 who were basically not pro Nazi,

1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:36.400
 but were just not anti Nazi.

1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:40.400
 And Churchill was just trying to instill a different resolve.

1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:42.400
 He was trying to create that thing.

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:43.400
 He was trying to create that value.

1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:45.400
 And in the American Revolution, it was as well.

1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:48.400
 The founding fathers, the leaders of the revolution,

1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:50.400
 it's not that everybody just woke up one morning

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:51.400
 in the United States

1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:53.400
 and had this ideology of liberty and freedom.

1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:54.400
 Some of that was true.

1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:55.400
 It was out there in the ether,

1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:58.400
 but they had to manufacture and create it

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:01.400
 in a way that I think they believed and was noble,

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.400
 but there's a lot of manufacturing and creation

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.400
 of these values and principles that is not noble,

1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:09.400
 and that is exactly what Hitler did so well.

1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:10.400
 Yeah.

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:13.400
 The anti Semitism was present throughout the world,

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:17.400
 but the more subtle thing that I feel like

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:21.400
 may be more generally applicable

1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:26.400
 is this kind of pacifism

1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:29.400
 that I think people in the United States felt like.

1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:31.400
 It's not my conflict.

1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:33.400
 Why do I need to get involved with it?

1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:37.400
 And I think Churchill was fighting that,

1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:38.400
 the general...

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:40.400
 Apathy.

1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:45.400
 It's the apathy of rational calculus,

1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:50.400
 like what are we going to gain if we fight back?

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:54.400
 Hitler seems to be pretty reasonable.

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:57.400
 He's saying he's going to stop the bombing,

1:12:57.400 --> 1:13:01.400
 that you're still going to maintain your sovereignty

1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:04.400
 as the great people of Britain.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.400
 Like why are we fighting again?

1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:08.400
 And that's the thing that's hard to break

1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:11.400
 because you have to say, well,

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:13.400
 you have to speak the principle,

1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:16.400
 you have to speak at some greater sort of

1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:19.400
 long term vision of history.

1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:23.400
 So like, yes, now it may seem like

1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:25.400
 it's a way to avoid the fight,

1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:27.400
 but you're actually just sort of

1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:29.400
 putting shackles on yourself.

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:33.400
 You're destroying the very greatness of our people

1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:35.400
 if we don't fight back.

1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:37.400
 And to think about this with like the current case

1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:38.400
 with Russia, I mean,

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:41.400
 some people look at Putin's speeches

1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:45.400
 and papers he's written on Ukraine

1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:46.400
 historically being a part of Russia

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:49.400
 and trying to deny the...

1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:51.400
 basically create all these nationalist narratives

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:53.400
 and they think, well, Putin really believes,

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:55.400
 and he might, Putin really believes this

1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:56.400
 and that's why he's invading.

1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:58.400
 And that might also be true

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:01.400
 and that would contribute to...

1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:04.400
 just make a peaceful bargain even harder to find.

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:07.400
 But I suspect what's at least a minimum true

1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:10.400
 is Putin's trying to manufacture

1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:12.400
 support for an invasion in the population

1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:14.400
 through propaganda.

1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:19.400
 And so he's doing on some level

1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:21.400
 the same thing that Winston Churchill was doing

1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:23.400
 in mechanical terms,

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:27.400
 which is to try to manipulate people's references.

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:31.400
 But doing it in a sinister, malevolent, evil,

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.400
 self serving way because it's really in his interest,

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.400
 whereas this was anything but, right,

1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:38.400
 in the Churchill example.

1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:41.400
 The dark human thing is like

1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:44.400
 there's moments in World War II

1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:46.400
 where Hitler's propaganda,

1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:49.400
 he began to believe his own propaganda.

1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:50.400
 It's like...

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:51.400
 I think he probably always believed...

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.400
 I think he was a sincere believer.

1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:58.400
 Well no, no, no, but there's a lot of places

1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:01.400
 where there was uncertainty

1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:04.400
 and they decided to do propaganda

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:06.400
 and that propaganda resolved the uncertainty

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:08.400
 in his own mind.

1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:11.400
 So for example, he believed until very late

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:14.400
 that America is a weakling,

1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:17.400
 militarily and as an economic power

1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:19.400
 and just the spirit of the people.

1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:21.400
 And that was part of the propaganda they were producing

1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:23.400
 and because of that propaganda when he became

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:25.400
 the head of the army,

1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:27.400
 he was making military actions,

1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:30.400
 he like nonchalantly started war with America,

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:32.400
 with the United States of America,

1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:34.400
 where he didn't need to at all.

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:35.400
 He could have avoided that completely,

1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:37.400
 but he thought, eh, whatever.

1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:39.400
 They're easy.

1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:42.400
 So I think that propaganda first, belief second.

1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:46.400
 And I think as a human being, as a dictator,

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:48.400
 when you start to believe the lies

1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:50.400
 with which you're controlling the populace,

1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:52.400
 you're not able to,

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:54.400
 you become detached from this person

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:58.400
 that's able to resolve in a very human way

1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:00.400
 the conflict in the world.

1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:02.400
 I mean, when I said the meta,

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:04.400
 the big common factor that causes war

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:06.400
 over and over and over again is unaccountable power.

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:08.400
 It's not just because it's mechanically,

1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:10.400
 like one of my five explanations is saying,

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:11.400
 well, if you're unaccountable,

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.400
 you don't bear the costs of war,

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:13.400
 you might have private incentives.

1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:15.400
 So yes, bargains are harder to find,

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:17.400
 but it leads to all these nasty interactions.

1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:19.400
 So earlier I said there's this interaction

1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:22.400
 between the values and the unchecked leaders

1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:25.400
 because those idiosyncratic values of your leader

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:27.400
 become more important when they're unchecked.

1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:29.400
 But the uncertainty point you just made

1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:30.400
 is like a deep point.

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:34.400
 It's to say actually that like the fundamental problem

1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:37.400
 that all autocrats have is an information problem

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:39.400
 because nobody wants to give them

1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:40.400
 the right information.

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:44.400
 And they have very few ways to aggregate information

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:46.400
 if they're not popular, right?

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:49.400
 And so there's a whole cottage industry

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:51.400
 of political science sort of talking about

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:55.400
 like why autocrats love fixed elections

1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:56.400
 and why they love Twitter

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:58.400
 and why they actually like it in a controlled way.

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.400
 It solves an information problem.

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:01.400
 Like that's your crucial,

1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.400
 if you're like Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin,

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:06.400
 you need to solve an information problem

1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:08.400
 just to avoid having rebellion on your hands

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.400
 in your own country every day

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:13.400
 because uncertainty kind of gets magnified

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:15.400
 and you get all this distorted information

1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:16.400
 in this apparatus of control.

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:19.400
 And so that's like another nasty interaction

1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:22.400
 between uncertainty and unchecked leaders

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:25.400
 is you end up in this situation

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:27.400
 where you're getting bad information.

1:17:27.400 --> 1:17:30.400
 And it's not that you believe your own lies.

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:32.400
 It's just that you sort of believe,

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.400
 you're sort of averaging what you believe

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.400
 over the available information

1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:39.400
 and you don't realize that it's such a distorted

1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:42.400
 and biased information source.

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:45.400
 One of the other things about this time

1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:50.400
 that was a surprise to me in the fog of uncertainty,

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:59.400
 how sort of seemingly likely nuclear war became.

1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:02.400
 Not likely, but how it.

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:03.400
 Less unlikely than before.

1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:05.400
 Exactly, that's a better way to say it.

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:09.400
 It started to take a random stroll away

1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:12.400
 from zero percent probability into this kind of land

1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:15.400
 of maybe like, it's hard to know,

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:18.400
 but it's like, oh wow, we're actually normally

1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:21.400
 talking about this as if this is part of the calculus,

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:22.400
 part of the options.

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:24.400
 But before we talk about nuclear war,

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:26.400
 because I'm going to need a drink,

1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:28.400
 do you need to go to the bathroom?

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:30.400
 Sure, I'll take a break.

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:32.400
 So back to nuclear war.

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.400
 What do you think about this?

1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:38.400
 That people were nonchalantly speaking about nuclear wars

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:41.400
 if it doesn't lead to the potential annihilation

1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:44.400
 of the human species.

1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:46.400
 What are the chances that our world

1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:48.400
 ascends into nuclear war?

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:51.400
 Within your framework, you wear many hats.

1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:52.400
 Yeah.

1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:59.400
 One is sort of the analyst, right?

1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:00.400
 And then one is a human.

1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:02.400
 What do you think are the chances we get

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:04.400
 to see nuclear war in the century?

1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:07.400
 Well, you know, the official doomsday clock

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:10.400
 for nuclear warfare sits in the lobby of my building.

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:12.400
 The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:14.400
 sort of shares a building with us,

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:15.400
 so it's always there every day.

1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:17.400
 Can you describe what the doomsday clock is?

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.400
 The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists,

1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:21.400
 it's something that this group of physicists

1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:23.400
 sort of said to sort of mark just how close we are

1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:26.400
 to nuclear catastrophe, and they started it decades ago.

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:28.400
 And it's a clock, and it's sort of how close

1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:31.400
 are we to midnight, where midnight is nuclear Armageddon

1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:33.400
 or the destruction of humanity.

1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:35.400
 And it's been sitting, I mean, it's actually,

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.400
 it hasn't moved as close to,

1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:41.400
 it hasn't moved as close to midnight

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:43.400
 in the last few weeks as it probably should have,

1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:46.400
 only because it was already so close.

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:48.400
 There's actually limited room for it to move

1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:49.400
 for a bunch of other reasons.

1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:51.400
 I think there's a whole political thing

1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:52.400
 that once it's really hard,

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:55.400
 it's really easy to move it closer.

1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:56.400
 And it's really hard if you're the person

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:58.400
 in charge of that clock to move it away, right?

1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:00.400
 Because that's always very controversial.

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:01.400
 So it always sits there,

1:20:01.400 --> 1:20:03.400
 but it forces you to think about it

1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:04.400
 a little bit every day.

1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:13.400
 And I admit I was nonchalant about it until recently

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:16.400
 in a way that many, many other people were.

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.400
 I still think the risk is very low,

1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:24.400
 but kind of for the reasons we've talked,

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:27.400
 it's just so unimaginably costly

1:20:27.400 --> 1:20:29.400
 that nobody wants to go that route.

1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:33.400
 So it's like the extreme version of my whole argument

1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:35.400
 was why we most of the time don't fight

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:37.400
 is because it's just so damn costly.

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.400
 And so that's the incentive not to use this.

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:42.400
 And if they do use it,

1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:47.400
 that's the incentive to use it in a very restrained way.

1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:50.400
 But because we know we do go to war

1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:52.400
 and there's all these things that interfere with it,

1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:55.400
 including miscalculation and all of these human foibles,

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.400
 and several of those nuclear powers

1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:00.400
 are not accountable leaders,

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:02.400
 I think we have to be a lot more worried

1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:04.400
 than many of us were very recently.

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:06.400
 I pointed out earlier the whole reason we're in this mess

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:09.400
 is because the only people who have this private interest

1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:11.400
 in having Ukraine give up its freedom

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:17.400
 is this Russian cabal and elite that gets their power

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:22.400
 and is preserved and is threatened by Ukrainian democracy.

1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:25.400
 How far would they go to hang onto power

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:28.400
 when push came to shove

1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:31.400
 is I think the thing that worries me the most.

1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:34.400
 And is plainly what worries most people

1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:36.400
 about the risk of nuclear war.

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:39.400
 Like at what point does that unchecked leadership

1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:41.400
 decide that this is worth it?

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:46.400
 Especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top.

1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:48.400
 I don't know.

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:51.400
 And I don't know that any of us

1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:53.400
 have really fully thought through

1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:55.400
 all of that calculus and what's going on.

1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:58.400
 Very recently around the anniversary of January 6th

1:21:58.400 --> 1:21:59.400
 there were a lot of questions about

1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:02.400
 was the United States going to have another civil war?

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.400
 On the one hand I think it's almost unimaginable.

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:08.400
 Sort of like in the same way I think that a nuclear war

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:10.400
 and complete Armageddon is unimaginable.

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.400
 But I remember something that

1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:17.400
 when both of those questions get asked

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:20.400
 I remember something I was in the audience

1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:23.400
 of listening to some great economists speak about

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:26.400
 20 years ago about the risk of an Argentina style

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:27.400
 financial meltdown of the United States.

1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:30.400
 Like what's the total financial collapse?

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:35.400
 And they said you know what the risk is vanishingly small

1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:38.400
 but that's terrifying because until recently

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:40.400
 the answer was zero.

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:42.400
 And so the fact that it's not zero

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:44.400
 should deeply, deeply scare us all

1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:46.400
 and we should devote a lot of energy

1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:48.400
 to making it zero again.

1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:50.400
 And that's how I feel about the risk of a civil war

1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:52.400
 in the U.S. and that's how I feel about the risk

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:55.400
 of nuclear war is it's higher than it used to be

1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:57.400
 and that should terrify us all.

1:22:57.400 --> 1:22:59.400
 To me what terrifies me is that all this kind of stuff

1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:03.400
 seems to happen like overnight like super quick

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:06.400
 and it escalates super quick when it happens.

1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:11.400
 So it's not like I don't know what I imagine

1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:15.400
 but it just happens like if a nuclear war happened

1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:20.400
 it would be something like a plane like in this case

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:23.400
 with Ukraine a NATO plane shut down

1:23:23.400 --> 1:23:28.400
 over some piece of land by the Russian forces

1:23:29.400 --> 1:23:31.400
 or so the narrative would go

1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:33.400
 but it doesn't even matter what's true or not

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:38.400
 in order to spark the first moment of escalation

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:40.400
 and then it just goes, goes, goes.

1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:41.400
 Well I think that happens sometimes.

1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:44.400
 I mean again it's this thing that you know

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:46.400
 what social scientists call it selection

1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:47.400
 on the dependent variable.

1:23:47.400 --> 1:23:49.400
 Like there's all these times when that didn't happen

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:53.400
 when it stopped, when it escalated one step

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:55.400
 and then people paused or escalated two steps

1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:57.400
 and people said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:01.400
 And so we remember the times when it went boom, boom, boom

1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:03.400
 boom, boom, boom, boom and then the really terrible

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:05.400
 thing happened but that fortunately that's not

1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:07.400
 you know I start off the book with an example

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:10.400
 of a gang war that didn't happen in Medellin, Colombia

1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:13.400
 which is my day job is actually studying conflict

1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:17.400
 and gangs and violence of these other kinds of groups

1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:22.400
 also very sinister and most of the time they don't fight

1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:24.400
 and that escalation doesn't happen.

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:27.400
 So the escalation does happen quickly sometimes

1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:29.400
 except when it doesn't which fortunately.

1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:30.400
 So we remember the ones when it does.

1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:32.400
 It's really important to think about all that.

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:37.400
 Like I remember talking to I think Elon Musk

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:41.400
 on this podcast I was sort of like talking about

1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:45.400
 the horrors of war and so on and then he said

1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:48.400
 well you know like most of human history

1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:51.400
 because I think I said like most of human history

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:58.400
 had been defined by these horrible wars.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:01.400
 He's like no, most of human history is just peaceful

1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:03.400
 like farming life.

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.400
 We kind of remember the wars but most of human history

1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:09.400
 is just you know is life.

1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:12.400
 Yeah and most of the competition between nations

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:16.400
 was like blood, I would say bloodthirsty

1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:19.400
 without drinking that blood in the sense that

1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:23.400
 it was intense, it would loathsome and so a lot

1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:25.400
 of the rivalry and a lot of the competition

1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:29.400
 which is also can be problematic in its own ways

1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:32.400
 is not violent and most of human history is about

1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:35.400
 the oppression of the majority by a few

1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:39.400
 and there are moments when they rise up and revolt

1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:41.400
 and there's a revolution we remember those

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:44.400
 but most of the time they don't.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:48.400
 And the story of political change and transformation

1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:51.400
 and freedom is there's a few revolutions that are violent

1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:55.400
 but most of it is actually revolutions without

1:25:55.400 --> 1:25:57.400
 that kind of violent revolt.

1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:00.400
 Most of it is just the peaceful concession of power

1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:03.400
 by elites to a wider and wider group of people

1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:05.400
 in response to their increased economic

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:08.400
 bargaining power, their threat that they're going to march.

1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:11.400
 So even if we want to understand something like

1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.400
 the march of freedom over human history

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:17.400
 I think we can draw the same insight that actually

1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:20.400
 we don't, most of the time we don't fight

1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:23.400
 we actually concede power, no you don't

1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:26.400
 the elite doesn't sort of give power to the masses

1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:28.400
 right away, they just co op the few merchants

1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:31.400
 who could threaten the whole thing and bring them

1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:34.400
 into the circle and then the circle gets a little bit

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:36.400
 wider and a little bit wider until the circle

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:39.400
 is ever widened, maybe not ever but encompasses

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:42.400
 most if not all and that's like a hopeful

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:45.400
 and optimistic trend.

1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:48.400
 Yeah if you look at the plot, if you guys could pull it up

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:51.400
 of the wars throughout history, so the rate of wars

1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:54.400
 throughout history does seem to be decreasing

1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:57.400
 significantly with a few spikes and the sort of

1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:02.400
 the expansion, it's like half the world is under

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:05.400
 authoritarian regimes but that's been shrinking

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:07.400
 and shrinking and shrinking.

1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:10.400
 Steven Pinker's one person, one famous scholar

1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:12.400
 who brings up this hypothesis, I mean there's sort of

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:15.400
 two ways, there's actually two separate kinds of violence

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:17.400
 that one where I think he's completely right

1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:20.400
 and one where I think we're not sure, maybe not

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:23.400
 where he's completely right, sort of interpersonal violence

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:26.400
 homicides, everyday violence has been going down

1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:28.400
 down down down down down down, that's just unambiguously

1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:31.400
 and it's mostly because we've created cultures

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:34.400
 and states and rules and things that control

1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:35.400
 that violence.

1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:40.400
 Now the warfare between groups, is that less frequent?

1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:42.400
 Well you know, it's not clear that he's right

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:47.400
 that there's fewer wars, you might say that there's

1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:50.400
 wars are more rare because they're more costly

1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.400
 because our weapons are so brutal.

1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:55.400
 The costs of war go up, as the costs of war go up

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:57.400
 not entirely but for the most part that gives us

1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:00.400
 an incentive not to have them and but then when

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:03.400
 they do happen they're doozies.

1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:04.400
 So is Pinker right?

1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:07.400
 I hope he's right but I don't think that officially

1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:08.400
 that trend is there.

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:14.400
 I think that we might have the same kind of levels

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:19.400
 of intergroup violence because maybe those five fundamentals

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:22.400
 that lead to war have not fundamentally changed

1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:25.400
 and thus made us, given us a more peaceful world

1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:27.400
 now than a couple hundred years ago.

1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:29.400
 That's something to think about so obviously

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:31.400
 looking at his hypothesis, looking at his data

1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:34.400
 and others like him but I have noticed one thing

1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:37.400
 which is the amount of pushback he gets.

1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:40.400
 That there is this, this is speaking to the general

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.400
 point that you made which is like we overemphasize

1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:49.400
 the anecdotal like the and don't look objectively

1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:51.400
 at the aggregate data as much.

1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:53.400
 There's a general cynicism about the world

1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:56.400
 and not, I don't even mean cynicism, it's almost

1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:58.400
 like cynicism porn or something like that

1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:02.400
 where people just get, for some reason they get

1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:05.400
 a little bit excited to talk about the destruction

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:09.400
 of human civilization in a weird way.

1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:12.400
 Like they don't really mean it I think.

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:16.400
 If I were to like psychoanalyze their geopolitical

1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:20.400
 analysis is I think it's a kind of, I don't know,

1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:24.400
 maybe it relieves the mind to think about death

1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:27.400
 at a global scale somehow and then you can go have

1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:30.400
 lunch with your kids afterwards and feel a little

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:32.400
 better about the world, I don't know what it is.

1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.400
 But that, it's not very scientific, it's very

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:37.400
 kind of personal, emotional and so we shouldn't,

1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:40.400
 we should be careful to look at the world in that way

1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:44.400
 because if you look broadly there is just like

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:47.400
 how you highlight, there's a will for peace

1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:50.400
 among people, yeah.

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:53.400
 You mentioned Medellin, by the way how do you

1:29:53.400 --> 1:29:55.400
 pronounce it Medellin or Medellin?

1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:58.400
 Both are fine, I think there they say Medellin

1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:01.400
 because that's kind of the accent is the zh on the double L.

1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:05.400
 But Medellin would be totally fine as well.

1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:08.400
 What lessons do you draw from the Medellin cartel

1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:11.400
 from the different gang wars in Colombia, Medellin?

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:16.400
 What's the economics of peace and war between drug cartels?

1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:18.400
 Here's what was really insightful for me.

1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:22.400
 So I live in Chicago and people are aware that

1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:24.400
 there's a violence problem in Chicago.

1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:26.400
 It's actually not the worst American city by any stretch

1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:29.400
 of the imagination for shootings but it's pretty bad.

1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:33.400
 And Medellin has these better, much many more

1:30:33.400 --> 1:30:38.400
 and probably many better organized gangs than Chicago.

1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:42.400
 And yet the homicide rate is maybe half.

1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:48.400
 And now, I mean there have been moments when these

1:30:48.400 --> 1:30:51.400
 gangs go to war in the last 30 years when Medellin

1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:53.400
 has become the most violent place on the planet

1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:55.400
 but for the most part right now they're peaceful.

1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:58.400
 And so what's going on there?

1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:02.400
 I mean one thing is there's a hierarchy of organizations

1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:05.400
 so that above these reasonably well organized neighborhood gangs

1:31:05.400 --> 1:31:07.400
 there's a set of sort of more shadowy organizations

1:31:07.400 --> 1:31:09.400
 that have different names.

1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:11.400
 Some people call them razones, some people would call them

1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:13.400
 bandas criminales, criminal bands.

1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:16.400
 You might just call them mafias.

1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:20.400
 And there's about 17 of them depending on how you want to count.

1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:25.400
 And they themselves have a little operating board called,

1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:27.400
 sometimes they call it the office, la oficina,

1:31:27.400 --> 1:31:30.400
 sometimes they call it la mesa, the table.

1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:32.400
 Well each individual one or as a group?

1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:34.400
 As a group, as a group.

1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:37.400
 So they meet and they don't meet personally all the time,

1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:39.400
 sometimes they meet, but they consult.

1:31:39.400 --> 1:31:42.400
 A lot of the leaders of these groups are actually in prison

1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:44.400
 and they're in the same wings in prison.

1:31:44.400 --> 1:31:46.400
 They have represented, oh they meet in prison.

1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:49.400
 Well they're, whatever, if I'm on a cell block with you

1:31:49.400 --> 1:31:51.400
 I'm meeting you anyways.

1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:55.400
 So actually imprisoning leaders and putting them in the same cell block

1:31:55.400 --> 1:31:58.400
 but not putting them, if you get arrested here in the United States

1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:01.400
 and you're a criminal leader and you get put in a super max prison

1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:02.400
 you cannot run your criminal empire.

1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:04.400
 It's just too difficult, it's impossible.

1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:07.400
 There it's possible and you might think, and they do,

1:32:07.400 --> 1:32:08.400
 they still run their empire.

1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:12.400
 And you might think that's a bad idea, but actually

1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:14.400
 cutting off the head of a criminal organization,

1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:17.400
 leading it to a bunch of hot headed young guys who are disorganized

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:19.400
 is not always the path to peace.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:24.400
 So having these guys all in the same prison patios is actually,

1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:29.400
 it reduces imperfect information and uncertainty.

1:32:29.400 --> 1:32:32.400
 It provides a place for them to bargain, they can talk.

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:35.400
 And so La Oficina is like a lot of these informal meetings.

1:32:35.400 --> 1:32:41.400
 And they have these tools that they use to control the street gangs.

1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:44.400
 So instead of there being like 400 gangs all sort of

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:46.400
 in this anarchic situation of competing for territory

1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:50.400
 and constantly at war, the Rezones are keeping them in line.

1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:57.400
 And they will use sanctions, they will, where the sanction might be

1:32:57.400 --> 1:33:00.400
 I will put a bullet in your head if you don't.

1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:03.400
 It's a little more honest than the sanctions between nations.

1:33:03.400 --> 1:33:07.400
 Exactly, but they will sit them down, they'll provide,

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:09.400
 they'll help them negotiate, they will provide,

1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:11.400
 I said there are these things called commitment problems

1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:13.400
 where like there's some dynamic, I have some incentive

1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:16.400
 to like exterminate you, but that's going to be costly for everybody.

1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:18.400
 So I'm going to, what's the solution?

1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:19.400
 Well, I'm going to provide commitment.

1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:21.400
 I'm going to like enforce this deal.

1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:23.400
 And yeah, you don't like this deal now because you could

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:26.400
 take advantage of your situation and wage war,

1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:28.400
 but I'm going to give you a counter incentives.

1:33:28.400 --> 1:33:31.400
 And so they keep the peace.

1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:35.400
 And so they're a little bit like the UN Security Council

1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:37.400
 and peacekeeping forces and sanctions regimes.

1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:40.400
 It's like the same kinds of tools, the same parallels.

1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:44.400
 And they're imperfect, they don't always work that well.

1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:45.400
 And they're unequal, right?

1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:47.400
 Because it's not like they're pursuing this in the interests

1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:50.400
 of like democratic, blah, blah, blah.

1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:53.400
 But it kind of works.

1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:58.400
 Until it doesn't, and 10 years ago in the mid 1990s,

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:00.400
 there were wars and this breaks down.

1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:03.400
 And it kind of gave me this perspective on the international institutions

1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:06.400
 and all the tools we've built, that we do the same things, right?

1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:14.400
 Sanctions are designed to make unchecked leaders face the cost of war.

1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:18.400
 It's a solution to one of the five problems, right?

1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:22.400
 And mediators are a solution to uncertainty.

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:25.400
 And international institutions that can enforce a peace and agreement

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:27.400
 are a solution to commitment problems.

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.400
 And all of these things can be solutions to these intangible incentives,

1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:33.400
 like these preferences for whatever you value,

1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:37.400
 and miscalculations because they will punish you for your miscalculation,

1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:41.400
 or they will get a mediator to help you realize why you're miscalculating.

1:34:41.400 --> 1:34:42.400
 So they're doing all these things.

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:47.400
 And it made me realize that the comparison to the UN Security Council

1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:49.400
 and all our tools is actually a pretty good one

1:34:49.400 --> 1:34:51.400
 because those are pretty unequal too.

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:54.400
 And those are pretty imperfect.

1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:58.400
 We have five nations with a veto on the Security Council

1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:00.400
 and a lot of unequal power,

1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:03.400
 and they're manipulating this in their own self interest

1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:06.400
 or their group's interests.

1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:12.400
 So anyway, so it's actually some of the things that work in Medellín

1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:14.400
 and why they work help give me a lot of perspective

1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:16.400
 on what works in the international arena

1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:19.400
 and why we have some of the problems we have.

1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:22.400
 So there's not, in some deep way,

1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:26.400
 there's not a fundamental difference between those 17 mafia groups and...

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:28.400
 The UN Security Council.

1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:33.400
 We're such funny descendant of apes.

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.400
 We put on suits.

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:39.400
 I'm sure they have different cultural garbs that they wear.

1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:40.400
 What are your thoughts?

1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:43.400
 I mean, that's the sense I got from Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa,

1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:46.400
 who founded the Medellín Cartel.

1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:50.400
 Having spoken with people on this podcast,

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:53.400
 Dr. Roger Reeves, who was a drug transporter,

1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:58.400
 it seems like there, it seems like it was,

1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:00.400
 I don't know the right term,

1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:03.400
 but it was very kind of professional and calm.

1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:05.400
 It didn't have a sense of danger to it.

1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:07.400
 Like it's negotiating.

1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:09.400
 So like the danger is always on the table as a threat,

1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:10.400
 as part of the calculation,

1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:13.400
 but you're using that threat in order to deescalate,

1:36:13.400 --> 1:36:14.400
 in order to have peace.

1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:17.400
 Everybody is interested in peace.

1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:19.400
 So something that happened last year,

1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:21.400
 we were a little bit able to watch in real time

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:22.400
 because we had a few contacts.

1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:25.400
 So we've been meeting and talking to a lot of these leaders in prison

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:27.400
 and a bit outside of prison.

1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:30.400
 Many of them will talk to us.

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:34.400
 And so the homicide rate,

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:36.400
 I mentioned the homicide rate in Medellín,

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:39.400
 maybe two thirds or half of the Chicago level,

1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:41.400
 it had been climbing.

1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:46.400
 Some of these street level gangs were starting to fight.

1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.400
 Maybe at sort of the, on some level,

1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:53.400
 it seems that like maybe some of those leaders were like saying,

1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:55.400
 well, you know, we're actually not sure how strong these guys are.

1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:57.400
 Let's let them fight just to test it out.

1:36:57.400 --> 1:36:58.400
 Let's have these skirmishes, right?

1:36:58.400 --> 1:36:59.400
 It wasn't prolonged warfare.

1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:02.400
 It was like, let's just sort of feel out how strong everybody is

1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:04.400
 because then we'll be able to reapportion the drug corners

1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:06.400
 and stuff accordingly.

1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:09.400
 So they were kind of feeling each other out through fighting

1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:11.400
 and the homicide rate doubled

1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:14.400
 and then it increased by the same amount again.

1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:17.400
 And so it was approaching something that might get out of control,

1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:19.400
 which wasn't in anybody's interest.

1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:20.400
 It wasn't in the government's interest.

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:21.400
 It wasn't in their interest.

1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:27.400
 And so then magically all these leaders on these patios, right,

1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:31.400
 different prisons, they're spread out around a bunch of prisons.

1:37:31.400 --> 1:37:34.400
 Everybody gets transferred to a new prison on the same day,

1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:38.400
 which means they all get to be in the same holding area for three days

1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:40.400
 before they're all moved elsewhere.

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:42.400
 So the government had a role in this.

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:46.400
 And then somebody who's like a trusted mediator on the criminal side

1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:51.400
 gets himself arrested and happens to be put in the same spot.

1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:59.400
 And a week later, the homicide rate is 30% of what it was.

1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:03.400
 It's back to its normal moderate, unfortunately not zero, right,

1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:09.400
 but it's back to where it was because it didn't make sense to have a war.

1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:14.400
 And everybody, government, mafia leaders, everybody sort of like,

1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:18.400
 they figured out a way to sort of bargain their way to peace.

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:20.400
 Can I ask you something almost like a tangent?

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:24.400
 But you mentioned you got a chance potentially to talk to a few folks,

1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:27.400
 some were in prison, some were not.

1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:30.400
 Is it productive?

1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:32.400
 Is it interesting?

1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:36.400
 Maybe by way of advice, do you have ideas about talking to people

1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:38.400
 who are actively criminals?

1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:39.400
 Yeah.

1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:41.400
 It really depends on the situation.

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:46.400
 So like the first time I worked in a conflicted place was in Northern Uganda

1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:49.400
 in maybe the last couple of years of a long running war.

1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:51.400
 So this would have been 2004, 2005.

1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:53.400
 This is a small East African country.

1:38:53.400 --> 1:39:00.400
 And the north of the country had been engulfed in, think of it as like a 20 year

1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:08.400
 low level insurgency run by a self proclaimed messiah who wasn't that popular

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:11.400
 and no one joined his movement so he would kidnap kids.

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:18.400
 And so the, I never, I could talk to people who'd come back from being there.

1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:22.400
 I never once, if I'd wanted to, and I was writing about that armed group,

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:25.400
 I never talked to anybody who was an active member of that armed group.

1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:26.400
 It was quite rare.

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:28.400
 It wouldn't have been easy or safe.

1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:31.400
 And that's sometimes true.

1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:35.400
 I'm starting to do some work in Mexico probably and I'm not going to be talking

1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:37.400
 to any criminal, they'll kill people.

1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:44.400
 When you say you're not going to talk to them and they'll kill people, which people?

1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:49.400
 So, I mean, journalists are routinely killed for knowing too much in Mexico.

1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:54.400
 There's no, there's no compunctions about killing them and there's no consequences.

1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:56.400
 Who kills a journalist?

1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:03.400
 It's not the main people that you spoke with, it's their, is it their lackeys

1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:07.400
 or is it rival gangs?

1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:11.400
 This is true of a Chicago gang and this is true of a Medellin gang.

1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:12.400
 It's probably true of a Mexico gang.

1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:15.400
 It's like you might have your group of 30 people.

1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:17.400
 One or two of them might be shooters.

1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:18.400
 Most people don't shoot.

1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:20.400
 Most people don't like to do that.

1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:24.400
 Or you don't even have any of those people in your group because you're trying

1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:25.400
 to run a business.

1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:26.400
 You don't need any shooters.

1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:30.400
 You can just hire a killer when you need them on contract.

1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:36.400
 And so, if somebody's asking questions and you don't want them to ask questions

1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:42.400
 or you think they know too much in a way that threatens you and it's cheap for you

1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:47.400
 and you have no personal compunctions, then you can put a contract out on them

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:49.400
 and they'll be killed.

1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:53.400
 That doesn't happen in Columbia.

1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:58.400
 It doesn't happen in Chicago.

1:40:58.400 --> 1:40:59.400
 I don't know.

1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:00.400
 There's lots of reasons for that.

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:01.400
 I can't say exactly why.

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:06.400
 I think one reason is like they know what will happen is that there will be consequences,

1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:11.400
 that the government will crack down and make them pay and so they don't do it.

1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:14.400
 And that is not what happened in Mexico.

1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:16.400
 They won't kill like a DEA agent.

1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:21.400
 They know that the US has made it clear, you kill one of our agents, we will make you pay.

1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:25.400
 And so, they're very careful to minimize death of an American.

1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:29.400
 But you kill journalists and nobody comes after them or is able to come after them.

1:41:29.400 --> 1:41:33.400
 And so, they've realized they can get away with this and that seems to be the equilibrium there.

1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:36.400
 That's my initial sense.

1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:40.400
 But we spent a lot of time before we started talking to criminals.

1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:45.400
 We spent a year trying to figure out what was safe before we actually – and failing.

1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:47.400
 There are lots of safe things to do.

1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:50.400
 It was also really hard to figure out how to talk to people in these organizations.

1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:55.400
 We failed 40 times before we figured out a way to actually access people.

1:41:55.400 --> 1:42:00.400
 Is it worth it talking to them if you figure out – because it's not never going to be safe.

1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:05.400
 It's going to be when you estimate that there's some low level of risk.

1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:10.400
 Like what's the benefit as a researcher, as a scholar of humans?

1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:11.400
 Yeah.

1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:15.400
 So, I actually don't think – let's compare it to something.

1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:18.400
 Okay, I'm in Austin for the first time and I'm walking around

1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:23.400
 and there's all these people buzzing around on these scooters without helmets.

1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:26.400
 We need to definitely interview them and say, what the hell is wrong with you?

1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:32.400
 So, nothing I have ever done in my entire career is as risky as that.

1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:38.400
 That's a nice way to compare journalism in a war zone and scooters in Austin.

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:43.400
 Some war zones – I worked in northern Uganda and I worked in Liberia and I work now in Medellin

1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:45.400
 and I'm starting to work in Mexico.

1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:49.400
 And both those particular places and then the things I did in those places

1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:54.400
 where I spent a lot of time making sure that what I was doing was not unduly risky.

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.400
 Todd, could you pull up a picture of a person on a scooter in Austin

1:42:59.400 --> 1:43:04.400
 so we can just compare this absurd situation where I doubt it's the riskiest thing

1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:06.400
 because now we have to look at the data.

1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:09.400
 I understand the point you're making, but – wow.

1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:11.400
 So, I'm not trying to say there's zero risk.

1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:16.400
 I think there's like a calculated risk and I think you become good at –

1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:20.400
 you work at becoming good at being able to assess these risks

1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:22.400
 and know who can help you assess these risks.

1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:27.400
 Yeah. I think there's another aspect to it too.

1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:34.400
 When you're riding a scooter, once you're done with the scooter, the risk has disappeared.

1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:35.400
 Yeah.

1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:38.400
 There's something lingering when you have to look over your shoulder,

1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:42.400
 potential for the rest of your life as you accumulate all these conversations.

1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:45.400
 Yeah. I've chosen, but I've also advised my students

1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:52.400
 and I wouldn't go and do this with an armed group that would think I knew too much and therefore –

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:53.400
 some people do that.

1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:56.400
 Some journalists I think are very brave and take risks and do that

1:43:56.400 --> 1:43:58.400
 and good for them and I'm happy they do that.

1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:02.400
 I don't personally – I don't personally do that.

1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:06.400
 So, these guys are very – I mean, Medellín is a business.

1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:12.400
 They're just – they're selling local drugs and they are laundering money for the big cartels

1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:19.400
 and they are shaking down businesses for money or selling services in some cases

1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:25.400
 and they make a lot of money and it's a business and they're in prison.

1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:30.400
 So, they can talk about most of what they want to talk about because there's no double jeopardy.

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:33.400
 They've been incarcerated for it.

1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:36.400
 And you're just talking shop.

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:41.400
 And they're just – so, it's worth it I think because the risk is very low,

1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:45.400
 but if you actually want to weaken these organizations and they're extremely powerful,

1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:50.400
 they're extremely big facet of life in a lot of cities in the Americas in particular,

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:53.400
 including some of the United – some American cities.

1:44:53.400 --> 1:44:58.400
 If you want to understand how to weaken these groups over time,

1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:00.400
 you have to understand how their business works.

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:08.400
 And we're – like, imagine you were made like the – whatever the oilses are of the United States.

1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:11.400
 Or maybe you're in charge of the finance industry, right?

1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:18.400
 You're the regulator for oil and energy or for finance and then you get in the job and someone says –

1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:22.400
 and then you're like, well, how many firms are there and what do they sell and what are the prices?

1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:25.400
 And everyone is like, well, you know, we don't really know.

1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:27.400
 You would not be a very good regulator, right?

1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:31.400
 And if you're a policeman or you're someone who's in charge of counter organized crime,

1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:32.400
 you're just a regulator.

1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:36.400
 You're trying to regulate an illicit – you're regulating an industry that happens to be illicit

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:38.400
 and you have no information.

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:41.400
 And so, that's kind of what we do.

1:45:41.400 --> 1:45:45.400
 We figure out how the system works and like what are the economic incentives

1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:47.400
 and what are the political incentives.

1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:49.400
 Any interviews and conversations help with that?

1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:50.400
 They help a lot.

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:51.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:53.400
 We do that – so, we have – I mean, I don't do – I do some of those,

1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:57.400
 but I'm on the side – my Spanish is okay.

1:45:57.400 --> 1:45:59.400
 It's not great and –

1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:01.400
 Do you have a translator usually if you ever go directly?

1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:04.400
 Well, if only because I can't understand the street vernacular.

1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:06.400
 Like I'm just totally hopeless.

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:09.400
 Nor could many people who speak Spanish as a second language.

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:16.400
 It's totally – you go to prison, you talk to these guys and they're speaking in the local dialect and it's tough.

1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:21.400
 But more importantly, like I just don't need to be there and that's not my – I'm a quantitative scholar.

1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:23.400
 I'm the guy who collects the data.

1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:30.400
 So, we have people on our team and colleagues and employees who are doing full time interviews.

1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:32.400
 And then I just sometimes go with them.

1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:35.400
 What about if we – you mentioned Uganda.

1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:36.400
 Yeah.

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.400
 Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord.

1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:39.400
 Exactly.

1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:44.400
 I'm seeing here he kidnapped 591 children in three years between 2000 –

1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:46.400
 Oh, he probably – they must have kidnapped.

1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:53.400
 They probably kidnapped for at least a short time, like a few hours to a day, more than 50,000 kids.

1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:55.400
 As a terror tactic?

1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:56.400
 A little bit.

1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:00.400
 I mean, most of those people they just let go after they carried goods.

1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:02.400
 They held on to – they tried to hold on to thousands.

1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:12.400
 The short story – listen, if you're not popular, if you're running an armed movement and you need troops and nobody wants to fight for you,

1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:19.400
 you can either give up or you can have a small clandestine terror organization that tries a different set of tactics.

1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:24.400
 But if you want a conventional army and you don't want to give up, then you have to conscript.

1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:30.400
 And if you want to conscript and you don't – here we conscript and then we say if you run away, we'll shoot you.

1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:35.400
 And we control the whole territory, so that's a credible promise.

1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:41.400
 If you're a small insurgency organization, people can run away and then you can't promise to shoot them very easily

1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:43.400
 because you don't control all the territory.

1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:46.400
 And so what these movements do is they try to brainwash you.

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:51.400
 And I think what they figured out after years of abducting children, you know, you talk about evil.

1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:56.400
 They figured out that, you know, we have to – maybe like – I don't know.

1:47:56.400 --> 1:47:59.400
 Say like maybe one in a hundred will like buy the rhetoric.

1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:06.400
 So we just have to conscript or abduct a large number of kids and then some small number of them will not run away.

1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:08.400
 And those will be our committed cadres.

1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:10.400
 And those people can become commanders.

1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:15.400
 Because they'll buy the propaganda and they'll buy the messianic messages.

1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:23.400
 But because most people wise up, we have – especially as they get older, we just have to abduct vast numbers of kids in order to have a committed cadre.

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:30.400
 And so it has the other benefit of sort of being terrifying for the population and being a weapon in itself.

1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:46.400
 But I think for them it was just primarily a way to solve a recruitment problem when you're a totally like hopeless and ideologically empty rebel movement.

1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:49.400
 So in some sense it's – yeah.

1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:51.400
 So that's maybe the short story.

1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:52.400
 It was a real tragedy.

1:48:52.400 --> 1:49:08.400
 I heard one interview of a dictator where the journalist was basically telling them like how could you be doing this, basically calling out all the atrocities the person is committing.

1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:11.400
 And the dictator was kind of laughing it off and walked away.

1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:12.400
 Yeah.

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:13.400
 And like he cut off the interview.

1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:16.400
 That feel like a very unproductive thing to be doing.

1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:20.400
 You're basically stating the thing that everyone knows to his face.

1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:22.400
 Maybe that's pleasant to somebody.

1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:25.400
 But that feels unproductive.

1:49:25.400 --> 1:49:29.400
 It feels like the goal should be some level of understanding.

1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:30.400
 Yeah.

1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:33.400
 He's been super elusive.

1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:36.400
 I mean why he's been fighting – it's Conan, yeah.

1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:39.400
 I mean why he's fought this, I don't know.

1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:51.400
 It's not a great example of – the way I look at that situation is it's a little bit particular to the way Uganda works.

1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:59.400
 But most of the political leadership for most of its post independence history came from the north of the country.

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:02.400
 That was like the power base.

1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:04.400
 And it was dictatorial.

1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:12.400
 So you've heard of people like Idi Amin, but people have heard of like Milton Abote and all these people were all from the north.

1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:15.400
 And then you get the current president who came to power in 1986.

1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:17.400
 So he's been around a long time, this guy, Museveni.

1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:21.400
 He was from the south.

1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:27.400
 And he was fighting against these dictators and he was fighting for a freer and better Uganda.

1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:32.400
 And in many ways – I mean he's still a dictator himself, but he did create a freer and better Uganda.

1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:37.400
 So he's a thug, but he was better than thugs before him.

1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:45.400
 And he came to power and he was like – and some of the northerners were like, we want to keep up the fight.

1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:49.400
 And he was like, you know what, you guys, I'm strong enough to continue to the north.

1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.400
 You guys go, you want to have a crazy insurgency up there?

1:50:53.400 --> 1:51:05.400
 And some kook believes he's like speaking, you know, through the Holy Spirit, you know, speaking through him and he's going to totally disrupt the north?

1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:06.400
 I don't care.

1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:07.400
 That's great.

1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:15.400
 You guys just fester and fight and that's going to totally destabilize this power, this traditional power base.

1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:17.400
 And then that's just going to help me consolidate control.

1:51:17.400 --> 1:51:30.400
 So he was an autocrat, he was an unchecked leader who allowed a lunatic to run around and cause mayhem because it was in his political interest to do so.

1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.400
 And there is no puzzle.

1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:39.400
 In some ways, it's that simple and kind of tragic.

1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:41.400
 There's little to understand.

1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:44.400
 Yeah, it took me a lot – well, you know what, it's not so easy.

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:46.400
 In the middle of it, I didn't understand that.

1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:48.400
 I don't think a lot of people did.

1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:54.400
 And I think I could persuade most people who study or work there now to see it that way.

1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:58.400
 I think people that would make sense to people, but it didn't make sense in the moment.

1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:04.400
 In the moment, this is happening, it's terrible, and you don't realize how avoidable it was.

1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:12.400
 Basically, it was the absence of effective police actions that kept the lunatic from being contained.

1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:17.400
 And that lunatic would never – it's not that skillful of our movement, right?

1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:22.400
 It could have been shut down, and there was just never any political will to shut it down.

1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:23.400
 The opposite.

1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:24.400
 That's what I meant.

1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:30.400
 That unchecked leader, not only do you not bear the cost, but you might have a private incentive as an autocrat to see that violence happen.

1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:35.400
 And in this case, it was just keeping a troublesome part of the country busy.

1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:42.400
 If it's okay to look at a few other wars, so we talked about drug wars in Medellin.

1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:45.400
 Are there other wars that stand out to you as full of lessons?

1:52:45.400 --> 1:52:46.400
 We can jump around a little bit.

1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:55.400
 Maybe if we can return briefly at World War II, from your framework, could World War II have been avoided?

1:52:55.400 --> 1:53:00.400
 This is one of the most traumatic wars, global wars.

1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:21.400
 One obvious driver of that war was the things that Hitler valued and then was able to use his autocratic power to either convince other people or to suppress them.

1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:38.400
 And so some people stop there and say that, and then in the West basically, and then of course they were able, because they were such an economic and political powerhouse, they were able to sort of make demands of the rest of Europe that you can kind of see the fold.

1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:52.400
 You know, letting Nazis march into Denmark without a fight or France folding very quickly, you can kind of see as like an appeasement or an acknowledgement of their superiority and their ability to bargain without much of a fight.

1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:56.400
 And then you can see the Western response as a principled stand.

1:53:56.400 --> 1:53:58.400
 I think that's, and there's a lot of truth to that.

1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:14.400
 You know, in terms of the strategic forces, a lot of political scientists see a version of a commitment problem, basically where Germany says, you know what, we're strong now, we're temporarily strong, we're not going to be this strong forever.

1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:39.400
 If we can get this terrible bargain and get everyone to capitulate through violence, if we strike now and then solidify our power and keep these, in World War I it was prevent the rise of Russia and prevent the strengthening of Russian alliances as well.

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:48.400
 And so we have an incentive to strike now and there's a window of opportunity that's closing and that they thought was closing as soon as 1917 in World War I.

1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:51.400
 And I don't know that that story is as persuasive in World War II.

1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:53.400
 I think there was an element of a closing window.

1:54:53.400 --> 1:55:13.400
 Well, they kept talking about a closing window because they really thought there was a closing window. I think there's a nature of that window is different in that there was a kind of pacifism and it seems like if war broke out, most nations in the vicinity would not be ready.

1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:25.400
 By the people, the leaders that are in power, they weren't ready so the timing is really right now. But I wonder how often that is the case with leaders in war that feels like the timing is now.

1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:54.400
 The other commitment problem, the other shift that was happening that he wanted to avert that is kind of wrapped up with his ideology is this idea of like a cultural and a demographic window of opportunity that if he wanted, if conditional on having these views of a Germanic people and a pure race and that now is that he had to strike now before any opportunity to sort of establish that was possible.

1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:59.400
 I think that's one, it's an incentive that requires his ideology as well.

1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:28.400
 So to avoid it within this framework, would you say is there, you kind of provide an explanation, but is there a way to avoid it? Is violence the way to avoid it? Because people kind of tried rational, peaceful kind of usual negotiation and that led to this war. Is that unique to this particular war, let's say World War I or World War II?

1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:37.400
 So there's an extra pressure from Germany on both wars to act. Okay, so we've highlighted that. Is there a way to alleviate that extra pressure to act?

1:56:37.400 --> 1:57:04.400
 Let me use World War I as an example. Suppose, as many German generals said at that time, we have a window of opportunity before Russia where we might not win a war with Russia. So the probability that we can win a war is going to change a lot in the next decade or two, maybe even in the next few years. And so if we are in a much better bargaining position now, both to not use violence, but if necessarily use violence.

1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:21.400
 Because otherwise, Russia is going to be extremely powerful in the future and they'll be able to use that power to change the bargaining with us and to keep us down. And the thing is, is in principle, Russia could say, look, we don't wanna get invaded right now.

1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:38.400
 We know you could invade us. We know we're weak. We know we'll be strong in the future. We promise to not wield our and abuse our or just merely just sort of take what we can get in the future when we're strong. We're gonna restrain ourselves in future.

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:50.400
 Or we're gonna hand over something that makes us powerful because that's the bargain that would make us all better off. And the reason political economists call it a commitment problem is because that's a commitment that would solve the problem.

1:57:50.400 --> 1:58:08.400
 And they can't make that commitment because there's nobody who will hold them accountable. So anything, any international legal architecture, any set of enforceable agreements, any UN Security Council, any world government, anything that would help you make that commitment is a solution.

1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:28.400
 All right, if that's the core problem. And so that's why, you know, in Medellin, you know, the oficina can do that. They can say, listen, yes, combo that's strong today is gonna be weak tomorrow. You have an incentive to eliminate this combo over here, because they're gonna be strong.

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:36.400
 But guess what? You're not gonna do that. And we're gonna make sure, we're gonna promise that when these guys do get strong, we're gonna restrain what they can do.

1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:49.400
 Most of our constitutions in most stable countries have done precisely that, right? There's a lot of complaining right now in the United States about the way that the Constitution is apportioned power between states.

1:58:49.400 --> 1:59:02.400
 That was a deal. That was a commitment. The Constitution in the United States was a deal made to a bunch of states that knew they were going to be weak in future because of economic and demographic trends, or guess they might be.

1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:18.400
 And it said, listen, you cooperate and we'll commit not to basically ignore your interests over the long run. And now, you know, 250 years later, we're still honoring those commitments.

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:42.400
 It was part of the deal that meant that there actually would be a union. And so we do this all the time. So a constitution is a good example of how every country's constitution, especially a country who's writing a constitution after a war, that constitution and all of the other institutions they're building are an attempt to like provide commitment to groups who are worried about future shifts in power.

1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:52.400
 And does that help with avoid civil war? So could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars, perhaps the American Civil War or any others?

1:59:52.400 --> 2:00:19.400
 So Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried for a long time to preserve the interests of minority groups, powerful minority groups who were powerful at the time and knew that the demographics were working against them, was to guarantee, you know, this ethnic religious group gets the presidency and this ethno religious group gets the prime ministership and this ethno.

2:00:19.400 --> 2:00:40.400
 And a lot of countries will apportion seats in the parliament to ethno religious groups. And that's an attempt to like give a group that's temporarily powerful some assurances that when they're weak in the future that they'll still have a say, right?

2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:51.400
 Just like we apportioned seats in the Senate in a way that's not demographically representative but is like unequal, quote unquote, in a sense to help people be confident that there won't be a tyranny of the majority.

2:00:51.400 --> 2:01:09.400
 And now that just happens to have been like a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon because eventually like the de facto power on the ground just gets so out of line with this really rigid system of the presidency goes to this ethno religious group and this prime ministership goes, that it didn't last, right?

2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:34.400
 But you can think of every post conflict agreement and every constitution is like a little bit of humans best effort to find an agreement that's going to protect the interests of a group that temporarily has an interest in violence in order to not be violent.

2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:35.400
 Yeah.

2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:40.400
 And so there's a lot of ingenuity and it doesn't always work, right?

2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:48.400
 Which actually from a perspective of the group, threatening violence or actually doing violence is one way to make progress for your group.

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:57.400
 We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right? We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine or Russians versus the West or maybe it's managing games versus one another.

2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:08.400
 Like a lot of their bargaining power comes from their ability to burn the house down, right? And so if I want to have more bargaining power, I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence.

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:21.400
 And so the strategically wise thing to do, I mean, it's terrible, it's a terrible equilibrium for us to be forced into, but the strategically wise thing to do is to build up lots of arms to threaten to use them, to credibly threaten to use them.

2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:32.400
 But then trust or hope that like your enemy is going to see reason and avoid this really terrible, inefficient thing, which is fighting.

2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:40.400
 But the thing that's going on the whole time is both of you arming and spending like 20% of GDP or whatever on arms, that's pretty inefficient.

2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:41.400
 Yes.

2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:52.400
 That's the tragedy. We don't have war and that's good, but we have really limited abilities to like incentivize our enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves from arming.

2:02:52.400 --> 2:03:01.400
 We'd love to agree to just like both disarm, but we can't. And so the mess is that we have to arm and then we have to threaten all the time.

2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:15.400
 Yeah, so the threat of violence is costly nevertheless. You've actually pulled up that now disappeared a paper that said the big title called Civil War and your name is on it. What's that about?

2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:22.400
 Well, that was, I mean, when I was finishing graduate school and this was a paper with my advisor at Ted Miguel at Berkeley.

2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:32.400
 Most nations, the paper opens, have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. Yet while they were, you still got school on this or no?

2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:35.400
 Maybe last year or just graduated, I think.

2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:40.400
 I wish I was in a discipline that wrote papers like this. This is pretty badass.

2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:55.400
 How is Civil War central to many nations development? It has stood at the periphery of economic research and teaching, so on and so forth. And this is looking at Civil War broadly throughout history or is it just particular civil wars?

2:03:55.400 --> 2:04:06.400
 We were mostly looking at like the late 20th century. I mean, I was trained as a what's called development economist, which is somebody who studies why some places are poor and why some countries are rich.

2:04:06.400 --> 2:04:23.400
 And I, like a number of people around that time, stumbled into violence. I mean, people have been studying the wealth and poverty of nations basically since the invention of economics, but there was a big blind spot for violence.

2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:38.400
 Now there isn't any more. It's like a flourishing area of study in economics, but at the time it wasn't. And so there were people like me and Ted who were sort of part political scientists, because political scientists obviously had been studying this for a long time,

2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:44.400
 who started bringing economic tools and expertise and partnerships with political scientists and adding to it.

2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:55.400
 And so we wrote this. So after like people have been doing this for five or 10 years in our field, we wrote like a review article telling economists like what was going on. And so this was like a summary for economists.

2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:07.400
 So the book in some ways is a lot in the same spirit of this article. This article, I mean, it's designed to be not written as like a boring laundry list of studies, which is what, that's the purpose this article was for.

2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:24.400
 It was for graduate students and professors who wanted to think about what to work on and what we knew. This book is like now trying to like not just say what economists are doing, but sort of say what economists, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, like how do we bring some sense to this big project?

2:05:24.400 --> 2:05:37.400
 And policymakers, like what do we know? And what do we know about building peace? Because if you don't know what the reason for wars are, you're probably not going to design the right cure.

2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:57.400
 And so anyway, so that was the, but I started off studying civil wars because I stumbled into this place in Northern Uganda basically by accident. It was no intention of working in civil wars. I'd never thought about it. And then basically I followed a woman there.

2:05:57.400 --> 2:06:13.400
 Oh, we'll talk about that. And for people who are just watching, we have an amazing team of folks helping out, pulling pictures and articles and so on, mostly so that I can pull up pictures on Instagram of animals fighting, which is what I do on my own time.

2:06:13.400 --> 2:06:19.400
 And then we could discuss, analyze, maybe with George St. Pierre. That's what all he sends me for people who are curious.

2:06:19.400 --> 2:06:42.400
 But let me ask you, one of the most difficult things going on in the world today, Israel, Palestine. Will we ever see peace in this part of the world? And sort of your book title is The Roots of War and the Paths for Peace, or the subtitle, Why We Fight. What's the path for peace? Will we ever see peace?

2:06:42.400 --> 2:07:05.400
 Yeah. If we think about this conflict in the sense of like this dispute, this sort of contest, this contest that's been going on between Israelis and Palestinians, it's been going on for a century. And there are really just 10 or 15 years of pretty serious violence in that span of time.

2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:21.400
 Most of it from 2000 to 2009 and stretching up to like 2014. There are like sporadic incidents, which are really terrible. I'm not trying to diminish the human cost of these, by the way. I'm just trying to point out that whatever's happening, as unpleasant and challenging and difficult as it is, is actually not war.

2:07:21.400 --> 2:07:28.400
 And so it is at peace. There's sort of an uneasy stalemate. The Israelis and Palestinians are actually pretty good at just sort of keeping this at a relatively low scale of violence.

2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:51.400
 There's a whole bunch of like low scale sporadic violence that can be repression of civilians, it can be terror bombings and terror actions, it can be counter terror violence, it can be mass arrests, it can be repression, it can be denying people the vote, it can be rattling sabers, all these things that are happening, right?

2:07:51.400 --> 2:08:10.400
 And it can be sporadic three week wars or sporadic, you know, very brief episodes of intense violence before everybody sees sense and then settles down to this uneasy. We're right not to think of that as like a peace and there's certainly no stable agreement, right?

2:08:10.400 --> 2:08:29.400
 So a stable agreement and amity and any ability to move on from this extreme hostility, we're not there yet and that's maybe very far away. But this is a good example of two rivals who most of the time have avoided really intense violence.

2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:46.400
 So you talked about this, like most of the time, rivals just like avoiding violence and hating each other in peace. So is this what peace, to answer my question, is this what peace looks like?

2:08:46.400 --> 2:09:05.400
 Not always, but I mean, it's kind of my worry. To go back to like the Russia Ukraine example, like I kind of, it's really hard, it's gonna be really hard to find an agreement that both sides can feel they can honor, that they can be explicit about, that they'll hold to, that will enable them to move on.

2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:15.400
 Yeah, feels like a first step in a long journey towards a greatness for both nations and a peaceful time, flourishing, that kind of thing.

2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:31.400
 I mean, you can think of like what's going on in Israel, Palestine, there's a stalemate. Both of them are exhausted from the violence that has occurred. Neither one of them is quite willing to, for various reasons, to create this sort of stable agreement.

2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:50.400
 There's a lot of really difficult issues to resolve. And maybe the sad thing, maybe we'll end up in the same situation with Russia, Ukraine. This is where, you know, if they stop fighting one another, but Russia holds the east of the country and Crimea and nobody really acknowledges their right to that,

2:09:50.400 --> 2:10:03.400
 that might, within there's just gonna be a lot of tension and skirmishing and violence, but that never really progresses to war for 30 years. That would be a sad, but maybe possible outcome.

2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:15.400
 So that's kind of where Israel, Palestine looks to me. And so someone, if we're gonna talk about why we fight, then the question we have to ask is like why, you know, like the Second Intifada, like that was the most violent episode.

2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:29.400
 Like why did that happen and why did that last several years? That would be like, we could analyze that and we could say, what was it about these periods of violence that led there to be prolonged intense violence? Because that was in nobody's interest. That didn't need to happen.

2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:49.400
 And partly I don't talk about that in the book. I wanted to avoid really contemporary conflicts for two reasons. One is I, things could change really quickly. I didn't want the book to be dated. I wanted this to be a book that had like longevity and that would be relevant still in 10 years or 20 years maybe before someone writes a better one.

2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:52.400
 Or before the human civilization ends.

2:10:52.400 --> 2:11:21.400
 Exactly. And circumstances can change really quickly. So I wanted it to be enduring and meant partly just avoiding changing things and changing these and avoiding these controversial ones. But I, of course I think about them. And so like a lot of my time, I decided actually last year to teach a class where I'd take all these contemporary conflicts I wasn't working on the book and where I wasn't really an expert, whether it's India, Pakistan, China, Taiwan, Israel, Palestine, Mexican cartel state drug wars and a few others.

2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:40.400
 And then teach a class on them with students and we'd work through it. We'd read the book and then we'd say, all right, none of us are experts. How do we make sense of these places? And we focused in the Israel Palestine case of mostly trying to understand why it got so violent and spend a little bit of time on what the prospects are for something that's more enduring.

2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:47.400
 It's hard to know that stuff now. I mean, it's easier to do the full analysis when looking back when it's over.

2:11:47.400 --> 2:12:03.400
 Well, Israel is in like a tough place. They have this attachment to being part of the West. They have this attachment to liberal ideals. They have an attachment to democracy and they have an attachment to a Jewish state. And those things are not so easily compatible.

2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:21.400
 Because to recognize the rights of non Jewish citizens, right, or to have a one state solution to the current conflict undermines the long term ability to have a Jewish state.

2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:42.400
 And to do anything else and to deny that denies their liberal democratic ideals. And that's a really hard contest of priorities to sort out.

2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:51.400
 Yeah, it's complicated. Of course, everything you just said probably has multiple perspectives on it from other people that would phrase all the same things, but using different words.

2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:54.400
 Well, I try to analyze these things in like a dispassionate way.

2:12:54.400 --> 2:13:05.400
 But unfortunately, just having enough conversations, even your dispassionate description would be seen as one that's already picked aside.

2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:19.400
 And I'll say this because there's holding these ideals. I'll give you another example. The United States also has ideals of freedom and other like human rights.

2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:42.400
 So it has those ideals, and it also sees itself as a superpower and as a deployer of those, enforcer of those ideas in the world. And so the kind of actions from a perspective of a lot of people in that world, from children, they get to see drones, drop bombs on their house where their father is now, mother dead.

2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:45.400
 They have a very different view of this.

2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:54.400
 You're beginning to see why I didn't. I wanted to write about those things and think about those things, but I wanted this book to do something different.

2:13:54.400 --> 2:14:07.400
 I didn't want it to fall on one of these polarizing... On a personal level, because I think I'm kind of a liberal democratic person at heart, my sympathies in that sense lie in many ways with the Palestinians, despite the way I...

2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:22.400
 I mean, just the fact that people are... They're not representative, and they got a very raw, real politic kind of deal. Most people in history have gotten this raw, real politic kind of deal in their past, right? Where somebody took something from you.

2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:24.400
 It's a good summary of history, by the way.

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:27.400
 That's it. History is just full of raw deals.

2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:28.400
 For regular people.

2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:47.400
 Right. And both sides are, in a principled way, refusing to make the compromise. And that's not like a both sides are right kind of argument. I'm just sort of saying, it's a factual statement that neither one wants to compromise on certain principles.

2:14:47.400 --> 2:15:04.400
 And they both can construct and in some ways have very reasonable... I don't want to have self justifications for those principles, and that's why I'm not very hopeful, is I don't see a way for them to resolve those things.

2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:10.400
 Speaking of compromise and war, let me ask you about one last one, which may be in the future.

2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:12.400
 China and the United States.

2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:13.400
 Yeah.

2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:31.400
 How do we avoid an all out hot war with this other superpower in the next decade, 50 years, 100 years? Because sometimes when it's quiet at night, I can hear in the long distance the drums of war beating.

2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:32.400
 Yeah.

2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:44.400
 In the second part of the book, I talk about what I think have been these persistent paths to peace, and one of them is increasing interdependence and interrelationships, and another one is more checks and balances on power.

2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:51.400
 I think there's more, but those are two that are really fundamental here because I think those two things reduce the incentives for war in two ways.

2:15:51.400 --> 2:16:11.400
 One is, remember when we were talking about this really simple strategic game where whether I'm Russia or Ukraine or whatever, any two rivals, I want more of the pie than you get, and the costs of war are deterrents, but only the costs of war that I feel, right?

2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:12.400
 I don't care.

2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:15.400
 I do not care about the costs of war to your side, my rival side.

2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:16.400
 I'm not even thinking of that.

2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:18.400
 That's just worth zero to me.

2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:20.400
 I just don't care in that simple game.

2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:27.400
 Now, in reality, many groups do care about the well being of the other group, at least a little bit, right?

2:16:27.400 --> 2:16:44.400
 In some sense, to the degree we, first of all, if our interests are intertwined, like our economies are intertwined, that's not a surefire way for peace, and we shouldn't get complacent because we have a globally integrated world, but that's going to be a disincentive.

2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:53.400
 And if we're socially entwined because we have great social relationships and linkages and family or we're intermarriage or whatever, all these things will help.

2:16:53.400 --> 2:17:00.400
 And then if we're ideologically intertwined, maybe we share notions of liberty or maybe we just share a common notion of humanity.

2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:10.400
 So, I think the fact that we're more integrated than we've ever been on all three fronts in the world but with China is providing some insulation, which is good.

2:17:10.400 --> 2:17:17.400
 So, I would be more worried if we started to shed some of that insulation, which I think has been happening a little bit.

2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:28.400
 U.S. economic nationalism, whatever could be the fallout of these sanctions or a closer Chinese alliance with Russia, all those things could happen.

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:36.400
 Those would make me more worried because I think we've got a lot of cushion that comes from all of this economic, social, cultural interdependence.

2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:45.400
 The social one with the Internet is a big one. So, basically, make friends with the people from different nations, fall in love.

2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:51.400
 You don't have to fall in love. You can just have lots of sex with people from different nations, but also fall in love.

2:17:51.400 --> 2:18:00.400
 The thing that also should comfort me about China is that China is not as centralized or as personalized a regime as Russia, for example.

2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:08.400
 And neither one of them is as centralized or personalized as some tinpot, purely personalized dictatorship like you get in some countries.

2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:18.400
 The fact that China, the power is much more widely shared is a big insulation, I think, against this war, well, future war.

2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:35.400
 The attempts by Xi Jinping to personalize power over time and to make China a more centralized and personal ruled place, which he's successfully moved in that direction, also worries me.

2:18:35.400 --> 2:18:43.400
 So, anything that moves China in the other direction, not necessarily being democratic, but just like a wider and wider group of people holding power,

2:18:43.400 --> 2:18:49.400
 like all of the business leaders and all the things that have been happening over the last few centuries have actually widened power.

2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:55.400
 But anything that's moving in the other direction does worry me because it's going to accentuate all these five risks.

2:18:55.400 --> 2:19:08.400
 I am worried about a little bit of the demonization. So, one of the things I see with China as a problem for Americans, maybe I'm projecting, maybe it's just my own problem,

2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:19.400
 but there seems to be a bigger cultural gap than there is with other superpowers throughout history where it's almost like this own world happening in China, its own world in the United States,

2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:30.400
 and there's this gap of total cultural understanding. We're not competing superpowers. They're almost like doing their own thing.

2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:37.400
 There's that feeling, and I think that means there's a lack of understanding of culture of people, and we need to kind of bridge that understanding.

2:19:37.400 --> 2:19:48.400
 I mean, you know, the language barrier, but also cultural understanding, making movies that use both and explore both cultures and all that kind of stuff.

2:19:48.400 --> 2:20:00.400
 It's okay to compete, you know, like Rocky, where Rocky Balboa fought the Russian. In fact, historically inaccurate because obviously the Russians win.

2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:07.400
 But, you know, we have to, I'm just kidding, as a Philly person, I was of course rooting for Rocky. But the thing is, those two superpowers are in the movies.

2:20:07.400 --> 2:20:13.400
 China is like its own out there thing. We need more Rocky 7.

2:20:13.400 --> 2:20:24.400
 I do think there's a certain inscrutability to the politics there and an insularity to the politics such that it's harder for Westerners, even if they know, even just to learn about it and understand what's going on.

2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:40.400
 I think that's a problem and vice versa. So I think that's true. But at the same time, we could point to all sorts of things on the other side of the ledger, like the massive amounts of Chinese immigration into the United States and the massive number of people who are now.

2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:50.400
 Like how many, so many more Americans, business people, politicians understand so much more about China now than they did 34 years ago because we're so intertwined.

2:20:50.400 --> 2:21:01.400
 So I don't know where it balances out. I think it balances out on better understanding than ever before. But you're right, there was like a big gulf there that we haven't totally bridged.

2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:22.400
 And like I said, lots of inter Chinese in the United States, sexual intercourse, no, and love and marriage and all that kind of social cohesion. So once again, returning to love, I read in your acknowledgement, and as you mentioned earlier, the acknowledgement reads,

2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:38.400
 quote, I dedicate this book to a slow and all defunct internet cafe in Nairobi, because it set me on the path to meet, work with, and most importantly, marry Jenny Annan.

2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:56.400
 Jenny Annan. There's a lot of beautiful letters in this beautiful name. This book have been impossible without her and that chance encounter. Tell me, Chris, how you found love and how that changed the direction of your life.

2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:16.400
 I was in that internet cafe, I think it was 2004. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was a good development economist and I cared about growth, economic growth, and I thought industrialization is like the solution to poverty in Africa, which I think is still true.

2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:29.400
 And therefore I need to go study firms and industry in Africa. And so I went and one of the most dynamic place for firms and industry at the time, still to some extent now was Kenya, and all these firms are on Nairobi.

2:22:29.400 --> 2:22:37.400
 And so I went and I got a job with the World Bank, they were running a firm survey and I convinced them to let me help run the firm survey.

2:22:37.400 --> 2:22:52.400
 And so now I'm in Nairobi and I'm wearing my suit and with the World Bank for the summer and my laptop gets stolen by two enterprising con artists, very charming. And so I find myself in an internet cafe.

2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:54.400
 With no laptop.

2:22:54.400 --> 2:23:08.400
 In a suit. Exactly. Kenya didn't get connected to the big internet cables until maybe 10 years later. And so it was just glacially slow. So it would take 10 minutes for every email to load.

2:23:08.400 --> 2:23:18.400
 And so there's this whole customer norm if you just chat to the next person beside you all the time. It was true all over anywhere I'd worked on the continent.

2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:30.400
 And so I strategically sat next to the attractive looking woman when I came in and it turned out she was a psychologist and a PhD student, but she was a humanitarian worker.

2:23:30.400 --> 2:23:45.400
 And she'd been working in South Sudan and Northern Uganda and this kids affected by this war. All these kids who were being conscripted were coming back because they're all running away after a day or 10 years and needed help or to get back into school.

2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:55.400
 So she was working on things like that. And I think she talked to me in spite of the fact that I was wearing a suit, maybe because I knew a little bit about the war, which most people didn't. Most people were totally ignorant.

2:23:55.400 --> 2:24:05.400
 And then we had a fling for that week. And then we didn't really, actually then we met up a little short while later. And then it was kind of, then we kind of drifted apart.

2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:17.400
 I was living in Indiana and spending a lot of time in Uganda. And then one day I was chatting with someone I knew who worked on this, a young professor who was a friend of mine.

2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:26.400
 And I said, oh, you know, you work on similar issues, you should meet this woman. And I talked to her because you guys would have like, you know, professional research interests overlap.

2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:35.400
 There's so few sort of people looking at armed groups in African Civil Wars, at least at the time. And he said, wow, that's a fascinating research question.

2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:47.400
 And I walked into the building and I thought, that is a fascinating research question. And I phoned Jeanie and I said, remember me and, you know, tell me more. I was just talking to someone about this. Tell me more.

2:24:47.400 --> 2:25:02.400
 And like, I started asking her more questions about it. We ended up talking for two or three hours. And over the course of those three hours, we hatched a very ambitious, kind of crazy, like, plan.

2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:17.400
 We were going to like find the names and all the kids who were born like 20 or 30 years ago in the region, and we were going to track a thousand of them down. We were going to randomly sample them and then we were going to find them today and we were going to track them.

2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:25.400
 And then we were going to use like some variation and exposure to violence and where the rebel group was to actually like show what happens to people when they're exposed to violence and conscription.

2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:35.400
 We were going to like tell, you know, psychologically, economically, we're going to like answer questions and that, which would help you design better programs. Right. And so we hatched this plan, which is totally cockamamie.

2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:53.400
 It's so cockamamie that when I pulled my previous dissertation proposal from my committee, like the next week and gave them a new one, they unanimously met without me to decide that this was totally bonkers and to advise me not to go.

2:25:53.400 --> 2:26:03.400
 And they coordinated to read my old proposal so that when I showed up for my defense, they said, you're actually think you're defending, but we were actually, we want you to only talk about this other thing that you were going to do because this is like, you should not go.

2:26:03.400 --> 2:26:08.400
 Oh, wow. I mean, it is incredibly ambitious. Super interesting though.

2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:12.400
 It actually worked exactly according to plans. The first and last time in my entire career.

2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:16.400
 You actually pulled off an ambition, like a gigantically crazy ambition.

2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:26.400
 That's my work. That's my shtick. Like my day to day research job is not writing books about why we fight. My thing is like, I go, I collect data on things that nobody else thought you could collect data on.

2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:36.400
 And so I always do pull it off, but it never turns out like I thought it was going to. Like it's always, there's so many twists and turns and always goes sideways in an interesting way.

2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:49.400
 It works, but it's all, but this one actually we pulled off in spite of ourselves and as planned. And, and so Ted Miguel, who I wrote that paper with was actually the one person of my advisors who was like, well, you know what?

2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:56.400
 He's, he was sympathetic to this. He was like, eh, why don't you just go for a couple months and like check it out and then come back and work on the other thing.

2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:09.400
 And that's, and so I followed Jeannie there and went there and then, but, and, and I don't know, what's this? I always remember, you know, this movie Speed, the Keanu Reeves and, and Sandra, whatever these people are.

2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:20.400
 And they have this relationship in these intense circumstances and they like, well, and I think at the end of the movie, they are sort of like, this will never work because these relationships in intense circumstances never matter, which is what we assumed.

2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:26.400
 And that turned out not to be true. So we've been married 15 years and we have two kids and yeah.

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:30.400
 And that's when you fell in love with psychology and learn to appreciate the power of psychology.

2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:38.400
 Exactly. So that's the psychology in the book as well, because I, and so we ended up, we, for most of our work for the first five or 10 years was together actually.

2:27:38.400 --> 2:28:00.400
 What's the hardest piece of data that you've been chasing that you've chased in your life? Like, what are some interesting things? Cause you mentioned like one of the things you, you kind of want to go somewhere in the world and find evidence and data for things that people just haven't really looked to get, gain an understanding of human nature, maybe from an economics perspective.

2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:06.400
 What's what, what, what kind of stuff either in your past or in your future you've been thinking about?

2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:16.400
 Well, I mean the hardest, there's hard and two cents. The hardest emotionally was interviewing all those kids in Northern Uganda. That was just like a gut punch every day.

2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:26.400
 Um, and just hearing the stories like that was the hardest, but it wasn't hard because it was, you could, the kids were everywhere and everybody would talk to you about it and they could talk about it.

2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:37.400
 No one had gone and interviewed kids that had gone through war in the middle of an active war zone. Nobody was going to displacement. All the things we did, no one had done that before. So now lots of people do it.

2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:52.400
 Could you actually speak to their, their stories? What's like the shape of their suffering? What, what were common themes? What, how did that, those stories change you?

2:28:52.400 --> 2:29:06.400
 I remember I said you could like your dispassion itself and your passion itself. I think I had to learn to create the dispassion itself. I mean, we all have that capacity when we analyze something that's far away and happens to people different than us, but you have to.

2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:23.400
 I think I discovered and developed an ability to like put those aside in order to be able to study this. So, um, you get maybe harder in a way that you have to be guard against. So you have to try to remember to put your human head on.

2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:32.400
 It's really horrible. Like if I want to conscript you and I don't want you to run away, then I want to make you think you can never go back to your village.

2:29:32.400 --> 2:29:43.400
 And the best way for me to do that is for, to make you, force you to do something really, really, really, really horrible that you could, you almost can credibly believe you can never really go back.

2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:53.400
 And it might be like killing a loved one. And so, and just having, hearing people tell you that story in all of the different shapes and forms.

2:29:53.400 --> 2:30:05.400
 To a point, what was horrible about it is they did this so routinely that you'd be sitting there in an interview with somebody and they'd be telling you the story and it's like the most horrible thing that could happen to you or anyone else.

2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:18.400
 And, but there's some voice in the back of your mind saying, okay, we really need to get to the other thing. You know, we know that I know how this goes. Like I've heard, you know, there's this thing like, okay, okay, I'm not learning anything new here.

2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:26.400
 Like there's some part, you know, deep evil, terrible part of you that's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, but let's get onto the other thing, but I know I have to go through this.

2:30:26.400 --> 2:30:35.400
 But every day you have to go through that to get to the, cause you're trying to actually understand how to help people. You're trying to understand how that trauma has manifested, how they either, some people get stronger as a result of that.

2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:42.400
 Some people get weaker. And if you want to know how to help people, then you need to get to that. I wasn't trying to get to something for my selfish purposes.

2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:45.400
 I was trying to figure out, okay, we need to know what your symptoms are now.

2:30:45.400 --> 2:31:02.400
 That's such a dark thing about us. So if you're surrounded by trauma, God, that voice in the back of your head that you just go, yeah, I know exactly how this conversation goes. Let's skip ahead to the solutions to the next.

2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:17.400
 Yeah. So that was, that was, yeah. So that was because you then have to deal with yourself. So it's very helpful if you like come home every night to someone who's a gone through the same thing and B is a professional and very, very, very, very good counseling psychologist.

2:31:17.400 --> 2:31:38.400
 The hardest thing, I mean, the organized crime stuff has been the hardest. Just figuring out how to get that information took us years of just trial and error, mostly error of like just how to get people to talk to us or how to collect data in a way that's safe for me and safe for my team and safe for people to answer a survey.

2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:53.400
 Like how do you get, how do you get the information on what gangs are doing in the community or how it's hurting or helping people? Like you've got to run surveys and you've got to talk to gang members, all these things that nobody knows how to do that.

2:31:53.400 --> 2:32:04.400
 And so we had to sort of really slowly, not nobody, there's a few other things. There's other academics like me who are doing this, but it's a pretty small group that's trying to like collect systematic data.

2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:20.400
 And then there's a slightly bigger and much more experienced group that's been talking to different armed groups. But every time you go to a new city and there weren't that many people working on this in Medellin, there were a few, you have to like discover a new, like it's really unique to that city and place.

2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:35.400
 So there's not, there's not like a website for each of the 17 mafia groups. There's no Facebook group. We have a, we've created like our own wiki. We have a private wiki where we document everything and it's a collaborative enterprise between lots of researchers and journalists and things.

2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:38.400
 So they, they now have, they can't see, you can't go online and see this.

2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:51.400
 That's individual research. It's not, I mean, they're hiding by design. Some of them have Facebook pages and things of this nature. So they, they do have public profiles a little bit, but not, not, not so explicitly. No. So they're clandestine.

2:32:51.400 --> 2:32:59.400
 Here's an example. So one of the things that's really endemic in Medellin, it's true in a lot of cities, it's true in American prisons, is gangs govern everybody's everyday life.

2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:17.400
 So if you have a, in an American prison, particularly Illinois or California, Texas is another big one, but also in a city in Medellin, if you have a problem, a debt to collect or dispute with a neighbor or something, you could go to the government and they do, and they can help you solve it.

2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:28.400
 You go to the police or you can go to the gang. And so, and that's like a really everyday phenomenon. But then, then there's a question of like, how do you actually, how do you actually figure out how, what services they're offering?

2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:42.400
 And how much they pay for them? And do you actually like those services? And how do they, how do you comparison shop between the police and the gang? And what would get you to go from the gang to the police? And then how's the gang strategically going to respond to that?

2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:54.400
 And what was the impact of previous policies to like make state governing better? And how did the gangs react? And so that's, we had to sort of figure that out. And that, that was, so that was just hard in a different way.

2:33:54.400 --> 2:34:00.400
 But I don't do the most, the mostly punishing stuff I couldn't do any longer. So that's much easier in that sense.

2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:25.400
 By the way, on, you know, Jorge Ochoa, some of these folks are out of prison. Have you gotten a chance to talk to them?

2:34:25.400 --> 2:34:40.400
 But also they were, they were there in a different era. The system was totally different. That's super interesting. Maybe one day we'll do that. Yeah, that was 30 years ago. And the system of, I mean, La Oficina, Pablo Escobar created La Oficina.

2:34:40.400 --> 2:35:00.400
 He integrated what's, what all these 17 corazones and all these street gangs are the fragmented former remnants of his more unified empire, which he gave the name La Oficina. I mean, I think, you know, it's a little bit apocryphal, but the idea is that, you know, I think he said, every doctor has an office, so should we.

2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:12.400
 I still can. I still love that there's parallels between these mafia groups and the United Nations Security Council. This is just wonderful. So, so, so deeply human.

2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:34.400
 Let me ask you about yourself. So you've been thinking about war here in part dispassionately. Just analyze war and try to understand the path for peace. But you as a single individual that's going to die one day, maybe talking to the people that have gone through suffering.

2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:44.400
 What do you think about your own mortality? Do you, how has your view of your own finiteness changed having thought about war?

2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:48.400
 Maybe the reason I can do this work is because I don't think about it a lot.

2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:52.400
 Your own mortality or even like mortality?

2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:56.400
 Yeah, I mean, well, I have to think about death a lot, so.

2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:08.400
 But there's a way to think about death, like numbers in a calculation when you're doing geopolitical negotiations, and then there's like a dying child or a dying mother.

2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:29.400
 Yeah, I guess I know I'm in a place where there's risk. And so I think a lot about minimizing any risks such that I think about mortality enough that I just, because I'm kind of an anxious person. And so like, I'm kind of a worry ward, like in a way.

2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:36.400
 And so I'm really obsessive about making sure anything that I do is low risk.

2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:48.400
 So that gives you something to focus on. A number is the risk and you're trying to minimize it. And yet there's still the existential dread. Your risk minimization doesn't matter.

2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:54.400
 Yeah, I've never been in a life threatening situation.

2:36:54.400 --> 2:37:01.400
 That's somebody who, you know what you sound like? That's Alex Honnold that does the free climbing. He doesn't see that as like.

2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:09.400
 That sounds exactly the same. Because you just said, I've never done anything as dangerous as those people riding a scooter.

2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:20.400
 I've actually been a rock climber for like 25 years with a long break in between. But I'm the same way. You know, actually rock climbing is an extremely safe sport if you're very careful.

2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:32.400
 But free climbing is the opposite of that. But I mean like, if you've got a rope that's attached to you that goes up is like attached to 18 trees and comes back down, you're fine.

2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:36.400
 You know, and you wear a helmet. You're good. You're totally fine.

2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:38.400
 Yeah, but this is super safe too.

2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:40.400
 It's free climbing. No, no, no.

2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:42.400
 We're watching free climbing, Alex Honnold.

2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:50.400
 I mean, because you're only going to put your hands and feet on sturdy rock and then you know the path and. No, no, no.

2:37:50.400 --> 2:37:59.400
 Totally. I have some friends and colleagues, I've known people who do some of these totally wacky extreme sports and have paid the price.

2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:05.400
 So I think it's totally, totally different. I think.

2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:07.400
 So even in that, by the way.

2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:13.400
 I can't even watch those movies because those freak me out too much because it's just too risky. Like I can't. I don't even. Yeah.

2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:18.400
 So those things, I've never watched like free solo or anything. There's just too much.

2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:20.400
 Still not as dangerous as riding a scooter in Austin.

2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:21.400
 Yeah, totally.

2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:23.400
 I'm not going to let that go.

2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:37.400
 But even in that, it's just risk minimization in the work that you do versus the sort of philosophical existentialist view of your mortality. This thing just ends.

2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:39.400
 Like what the hell is that about?

2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:44.400
 Yeah. I have this amazing capacity not to think about it, which might just be a self defense mechanism.

2:38:44.400 --> 2:38:54.400
 My father in law, Jeannie's father is an evangelical pastor, actually. He's now retired. And this we would talk about when we were getting married.

2:38:54.400 --> 2:39:00.400
 They weren't terribly thrilled that she was marrying an agnostic or atheist or something.

2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:07.400
 We love each other very much. It's fine now. But I only started discussing this and some of the, because that was one of his questions for me.

2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:14.400
 Like, well, how can you possibly believe that there's nothing afterwards? Because that's just like too horrible to imagine.

2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:22.400
 And we really never saw eye to eye on this. And my view was like, listen, I can't convince myself otherwise.

2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:28.400
 Anything else seems completely implausible to me. And for some reason, I can't understand. I'm at peace with that.

2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:39.400
 Like, it's never bothered me that one day it's over. And the fact that people have angst about that and that they would seek answers makes total sense to me.

2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:46.400
 And I can't explain why that doesn't consume me or doesn't bother me.

2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:49.400
 And yet you are at peace.

2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:58.400
 Yep. Maybe if I was worried, but if I was more worried about it, maybe I wouldn't be able to do. I don't know. I don't know. But then again, I don't take the risk. I'm still like, I don't know. But I minimize all sorts of risks.

2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:07.400
 I'm like, yeah, I minimize, you know, I try to optimize like groceries in the fridge, too.

2:40:07.400 --> 2:40:12.400
 That's a very economist way to live, I would say. That's probably why you're good at it.

2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.400
 That might be true. That might be there's some selection into economics of these cold calculators.

2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:28.400
 The chicken or the egg, we'll never know. Do you have advice for young people that want to do as ambitious, as crazy, as amazing of work as you have done in life?

2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:40.400
 So somebody who's in high school, in college, either career advice on what to choose, how to execute on it, or just life advice, how to meet some random stranger.

2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:41.400
 Yeah, exactly.

2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:43.400
 Or maybe a dating advice.

2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:54.400
 That part's easy. You have to fly coach and go to the internet cafes. All the development workers that I know that fly business class, I'm like, you'll never meet somebody.

2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:59.400
 I actually spent a lot of time writing advice on my blog, and I've got like pages and pages of advice.

2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:06.400
 And one of the reasons is because I never got that. When I grew up, I went to a really good state school in Canada called Waterloo.

2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:16.400
 I loved it, but people didn't go on the trajectory that I went on from there. And I had some good advisors there, but I never got the kind of advice I needed to pursue this career.

2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:26.400
 So it's very concentrated in elite colleges, I think, sometimes, in elite high schools. So I tried to democratize that. That was one reason I started the blog.

2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:34.400
 But a lot of that's really particular because every week I have students coming in my office wanting to know how to do international development work, and I just spend a lot of time giving them advice.

2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:35.400
 And that's what a lot of the posts are about.

2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:40.400
 Do they have very specific questions? Is it like country by country kind of specific questions?

2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:46.400
 The thing that they're all trying to do that I think is the right – I don't have to give them a really basic piece of advice because they're already doing it.

2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:59.400
 They're trying to find a vocation. They're really interested – and what I mean by that is it's like a career where they find meaning, where the work is almost like superfluous because they would do it for free.

2:41:59.400 --> 2:42:02.400
 And they're passionate about it, and they really find meaning in the work.

2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:11.400
 And then it becomes a little bit all consuming. So scientists do that in their own way. I think international development, humanitarian workers, people who are doctors and nurses.

2:42:11.400 --> 2:42:17.400
 We all do our careers for other reasons, right? But they find meaning in their career.

2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:28.400
 So I don't have to tell them whatever you do find meaning and try to make it a vocation, something that you would do for free, amongst all of these many, many, many options.

2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:35.400
 That's what I would tell – but that's what I would tell high school students and young people in college.

2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:39.400
 Sometimes it's hard to find a thing and hold onto it.

2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:47.400
 Well, that's the other – it took me a long time. So I actually started off as an accountant. I was an accountant with Deloitte and Touche for a few years. So I did not –

2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:52.400
 But that – did you wake up in the morning excited to be alive?

2:42:52.400 --> 2:43:01.400
 I was miserable. I found it by accident, which is another different story, but I landed in this job and a degree where I was studying accounting, and I was miserable.

2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:10.400
 I was totally miserable, and I hated it, and I was becoming a miserable person. And so I eventually just quit, and I did something new.

2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:15.400
 But then I was working in the private sector, and I actually just needed trial and error.

2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:23.400
 I actually had to try on three or four or five careers before I found this mixture of academia and activism and research and international development.

2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:32.400
 And when did you know that this was love, when you found this kind of international development? This was the academic context, too?

2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:36.400
 The key lesson was just trial and error, which we all have to engage in until it feels right.

2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:43.400
 It's okay. All right. Step one is trial and error, but until it feels right, because it often feels right but not perfect.

2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:51.400
 Yeah, if it's true, right enough. I mean, I was really intellectually engaged. I just loved learning about it. I wanted to read more.

2:43:51.400 --> 2:44:00.400
 In some sense, I was doing – I was in account, but I was reading about world history and international development and poor countries in my spare time.

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:11.400
 And so it was like this hobby, and I was like, wait a second. I could actually do that. I could research this and even write the neck of those books, and that's kind of what I did 25 years later.

2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:15.400
 That didn't occur to me right away. I didn't even know it was possible. This is the other thing people do.

2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:19.400
 People do their nine to five job, and then they find meaning in everything else they do.

2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:26.400
 They're volunteering, and they're family, and they're hobbies and things, and that was my social milieu. And that's a great path, too.

2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:33.400
 Because not all of us can just have a vocation or we don't find it, I think. And then you just circumscribe what you do in your work, and then you go find –

2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:44.400
 and that's not entirely true because everyone in my family does like their job and get a lot of fulfillment out of it, but I think it's not – that's a different path in some ways.

2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:50.400
 So it's good to take the leap and keep trying stuff, even when you've found a little local minima.

2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:56.400
 Yeah. The hardest part was it got easy after a while. It was quitting.

2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:04.400
 But now I take this to a lot of – and one of the people – I think one of the reasons I discovered your podcast or maybe Tyler Cowen –

2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:05.400
 Yeah, he's amazing.

2:45:05.400 --> 2:45:14.400
 Tyler takes this approach to everything. He takes this approach to movie. He's like, walk into the movie theater after half an hour if you don't like the movie.

2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:21.400
 You know what kind of person he probably is? I don't know, but now that you say this, he's probably somebody that goes to a restaurant.

2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:26.400
 If the meals is not good, I could see him just walking away, like paying for it and just walking away.

2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:29.400
 Yeah, and just go eat something better. That's exactly right.

2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:38.400
 And I thought that was kind of crazy, and I'd never – I was the person – I would never just put a book down halfway, and I would never stop watching a movie.

2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:43.400
 But then I convinced my wife – we lived in New York when we were single initially – sorry, not when we were single.

2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:54.400
 When we were childless, and we lived in New York, there's all this culture and theater and stuff, and I just said, let's go to more plays, but let's just walk out after the first act if we don't like it.

2:45:54.400 --> 2:45:58.400
 And she thought that was a bit crazy, and I was like, no, no, no, here's the logic. Here's what Tyler says.

2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:07.400
 And then we started doing it, and it was so freeing and glorious. We'd just go – we'd take so many more chances on things, and we would – and if we didn't like it – and we were walking out of stuff all the time.

2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:17.400
 And so I think I did that – realizing that that's how I – I just kept quitting my jobs and trying to find something else, like some risk.

2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:26.400
 Because that's how wars start, without the commitment. You need the commitment. Otherwise, no.

2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:29.400
 That's a different kind of commitment problem. That's a different commitment problem.

2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:38.400
 Some of it – I'm sure there's a balance, because the same thing is happening with dating and marriage and all those kinds of things, and there's some value just sticking it out.

2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:45.400
 Because some of the – maybe don't leave after the first act, because the good stuff might be coming later.

2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:46.400
 Yeah, that's a good point.

2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:47.400
 The balance.

2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:59.400
 Yeah. Well, I don't know. So when I met Jeannie, she was very wary of a relationship with me, because as I explained to her, I hadn't had a relationship longer than two or three months in 11 years.

2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:04.400
 And so she thought this person thought serious. And what I said to her – and she tells the story. This is how she tells the story.

2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:12.400
 She says, I didn't believe him when he said that I just – after two or three months, you kind of have a good sense whether this is going somewhere, and I would just decide if it was over.

2:47:12.400 --> 2:47:20.400
 And I walk away. So I took this approach to dating, like as soon as I thought it wasn't going to go somewhere. And then I decided with her that this was it, this was going to work.

2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:24.400
 And then I like – and then never – and she didn't believe – now she believes me.

2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:28.400
 You finally got to be right.

2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:38.400
 Okay, so this is an incredible conversation. Your work is so fascinating, just in this big picture way, looking at human conflict and how we can achieve peace,

2:47:38.400 --> 2:47:48.400
 especially in this time of the Ukraine war. I really, really, really appreciate that you calmly speak to me about some of these difficult ideas and explain them.

2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:52.400
 And that you've sat down with me and have this amazing conversation. Thank you so much.

2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:54.400
 It was an amazing conversation. Thank you.

2:47:54.400 --> 2:48:00.400

 And now, let me leave you with some well known, simple words from Albert Einstein. I know not with what weapons World War 3 will be fought, but World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones.

2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:30.400
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
