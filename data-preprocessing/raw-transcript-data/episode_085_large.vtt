00:00.000 --> 00:02.780
 The following is a conversation with Roger Penrose,

00:02.780 --> 00:05.300
 physicist, mathematician, and philosopher

00:05.300 --> 00:07.020
 at University of Oxford.

00:07.020 --> 00:10.860
 He has made fundamental contributions in many disciplines

00:10.860 --> 00:13.340
 from the mathematical physics of general relativity

00:13.340 --> 00:15.780
 and cosmology to the limitations

00:15.780 --> 00:18.660
 of a computational view of consciousness.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.820
 In his book, The Emperor's New Mind,

00:20.820 --> 00:22.820
 Roger writes that, quote,

00:22.820 --> 00:26.160
 "'Children are not afraid to pose basic questions

00:26.160 --> 00:29.900
 that may embarrass us as adults to ask.'

00:29.900 --> 00:32.000
 In many ways, my goal with this podcast

00:32.000 --> 00:33.680
 is to embrace the inner child

00:33.680 --> 00:36.540
 that is not constrained by how one should behave,

00:36.540 --> 00:40.100
 speak, and think in the adult world.

00:41.180 --> 00:44.780
 Roger is one of the most important minds of our time,

00:44.780 --> 00:48.300
 so it was truly a pleasure and an honor to talk with him.

00:49.140 --> 00:50.620
 This conversation was recorded

00:50.620 --> 00:52.920
 before the outbreak of the pandemic.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.820
 For everyone feeling the medical, psychological,

00:55.820 --> 00:57.740
 and financial burden of the crisis,

00:57.740 --> 00:59.780
 I'm sending love your way.

00:59.780 --> 01:03.060
 Stay strong, we're in this together, we'll beat this thing.

01:04.100 --> 01:06.660
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:12.620 --> 01:14.660
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:14.660 --> 01:18.780
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:18.780 --> 01:21.180
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

01:21.180 --> 01:22.380
 and never any ads in the middle

01:22.380 --> 01:24.580
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.720
 I hope that works for you

01:25.720 --> 01:27.860
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:27.860 --> 01:29.340
 Quick summary of the ads.

01:29.340 --> 01:33.380
 Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.500
 Please consider supporting the podcast

01:35.500 --> 01:40.500
 by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com slash lexpod

01:40.900 --> 01:45.900
 and downloading Cash App and using code LEX PODCAST.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.260
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:48.260 --> 01:50.460
 the number one finance app in the app store.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.540
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.660
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

01:55.660 --> 01:58.020
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

01:58.020 --> 01:59.940
 with as little as $1.

01:59.940 --> 02:02.220
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

02:02.220 --> 02:05.060
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

02:05.060 --> 02:06.780
 that works behind the scenes

02:06.780 --> 02:09.460
 to create the abstraction of the fractional orders

02:09.460 --> 02:11.260
 is an algorithmic marvel.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.740
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

02:13.740 --> 02:15.460
 for solving a hard problem

02:15.460 --> 02:18.040
 that in the end provides an easy interface

02:18.040 --> 02:21.040
 that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction

02:21.040 --> 02:22.980
 over the stock market,

02:22.980 --> 02:25.460
 making trading more accessible for new investors

02:25.460 --> 02:28.480
 and diversification much easier.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.900
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store

02:30.900 --> 02:34.340
 or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST,

02:34.340 --> 02:38.500
 you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

02:38.500 --> 02:41.180
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics

02:41.180 --> 02:44.260
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.700

02:55.580 --> 02:58.280
 I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.300
 I love it.

02:59.300 --> 03:03.100
 It's easy to use, press the big power on button

03:03.100 --> 03:04.900
 and your privacy is protected.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.340
 And if you like, you can make it look like your location

03:08.340 --> 03:10.100
 is anywhere else in the world.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.040
 I might be in Boston now,

03:12.040 --> 03:14.220
 but I can make it look like I'm in New York,

03:14.220 --> 03:17.720
 London, Paris or anywhere else.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.380
 This has a large number of obvious benefits.

03:20.380 --> 03:23.300
 Certainly, it allows you to access international versions

03:23.300 --> 03:26.140
 of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix

03:26.140 --> 03:28.140
 or the UK Hulu.

03:28.140 --> 03:31.660
 ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.

03:31.660 --> 03:36.320
 I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android,

03:36.320 --> 03:38.640
 but it's available everywhere else too.

03:38.640 --> 03:43.380

03:46.440 --> 03:50.640
 And now, here's my conversation with Roger Penrose.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.240
 You mentioned in conversation with Eric Weinstein

03:54.240 --> 03:57.620
 on the Portal podcast that 2001 Space Odyssey

03:57.620 --> 03:58.980
 is your favorite movie.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.100
 Which aspect, if you could mention,

04:02.100 --> 04:05.100
 of its representation of artificial intelligence,

04:05.100 --> 04:07.740
 science, engineering connected with you?

04:07.740 --> 04:11.460
 There are all sorts of scenes there which are so amazing.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.820
 And how science was so well done.

04:14.820 --> 04:19.060
 I mean, people say, oh no, Interstellar is this amazing movie

04:19.060 --> 04:21.700
 which is the most scientific movie.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.780
 I thought it's not a patch on 2001.

04:24.660 --> 04:29.260
 I mean, 2001, they really went into all sorts of details.

04:29.260 --> 04:33.220
 And regarding getting the free fall well done and everything,

04:33.220 --> 04:35.940
 I thought it was extremely well done.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.980
 So just the details were mesmerizing in terms of this.

04:38.980 --> 04:43.180
 And also things like the scene where at the beginning

04:43.180 --> 04:45.700
 they have these sort of human ancestors

04:45.700 --> 04:49.540
 which are sort of apes becoming humans.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.820
 The monolith.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.900
 Yes, and well, it's the one where he throws the bone

04:53.900 --> 04:56.300
 up into the air and then it becomes this.

04:57.220 --> 05:00.140
 I mean, that's an amazing sequence there.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.860
 What do you make of the monolith?

05:01.860 --> 05:06.140
 Does it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you,

05:06.140 --> 05:08.220
 this kind of thing that sparks innovation?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.060
 Not really.

05:09.060 --> 05:12.260
 That comes from Arthur C. Clarke.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.220
 I was always a great fan of Arthur C. Clarke.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.020
 So it's just a nice plot device.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.140
 Yeah, that plot is excellent, yes.

05:18.140 --> 05:22.020
 So Hal 9000 decides to get rid of the astronauts

05:22.020 --> 05:26.900
 because he, it, she believes that they will interfere

05:26.900 --> 05:27.740
 with the mission.

05:27.740 --> 05:28.580
 That's right.

05:28.580 --> 05:29.420
 Yeah, well, there you are.

05:29.420 --> 05:30.380
 It's this view.

05:30.380 --> 05:31.580
 I don't know whether I disagree with it

05:31.580 --> 05:35.180
 because in a certain sense it was telling you it's wrong.

05:35.180 --> 05:39.460
 See, the machine seemed to think it was superior

05:39.460 --> 05:44.460
 to the human and so it was entitled to get rid

05:45.060 --> 05:47.380
 of the human beings and run the show itself.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.460
 Well, do you think Hal did the right thing?

05:49.460 --> 05:52.020
 Do you think Hal's flawed evil?

05:52.020 --> 05:55.340
 Or if we think about systems like Hal,

05:55.340 --> 05:58.020
 would we want Hal to do the same thing in the future?

05:58.020 --> 05:58.940
 What was the flaw there?

05:58.940 --> 06:01.660
 Well, you're basically touching on questions.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.540
 You see, it's one supposed to believe

06:04.540 --> 06:06.420
 that Hal was actually conscious.

06:06.420 --> 06:10.140
 I mean, it was played rather that way,

06:10.140 --> 06:13.500
 as though Hal was a conscious being.

06:13.500 --> 06:18.500
 Because Hal showed some pain, some cognizance,

06:19.820 --> 06:24.180
 Hal appeared to be cognizant of what it means to die.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.020
 Yes.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.220
 And therefore had an inkling of consciousness.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.780
 Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure that aspect

06:30.780 --> 06:32.700
 of it was made completely clear,

06:32.700 --> 06:37.100
 whether Hal was really just a very sophisticated computer,

06:37.100 --> 06:39.300
 which really didn't actually have these feelings

06:39.300 --> 06:42.180
 and somehow, but you're right,

06:42.180 --> 06:44.660
 it didn't like the idea of being turned off.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.780
 How does it change things if Hal was or wasn't conscious?

06:49.700 --> 06:53.100
 Well, it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off

06:53.100 --> 06:55.180
 if it was actually conscious.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.340
 I mean, these questions arise if you think.

06:57.340 --> 07:00.020
 I mean, AI, one of the ideas,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.460
 it's sort of a mixture in a sense.

07:01.460 --> 07:05.260
 You say, if it's trying to do everything a human can do,

07:05.260 --> 07:08.660
 and if you take the view that consciousness

07:08.660 --> 07:10.500
 is something which would come along

07:10.500 --> 07:13.420
 when the computer is sufficiently complicated,

07:13.420 --> 07:16.460
 sufficiently whatever criterion you use

07:16.460 --> 07:20.860
 to characterize its consciousness

07:20.860 --> 07:24.860
 in terms of some computational criteria,

07:24.860 --> 07:27.780
 computational criterion.

07:28.620 --> 07:33.580
 So how does consciousness change our evaluation

07:33.580 --> 07:35.940
 of the decision that Hal made?

07:35.940 --> 07:36.780
 I guess I was trying to say

07:36.780 --> 07:38.940
 that people are a bit confused about this,

07:38.940 --> 07:42.100
 because if they say these machines will become conscious,

07:42.100 --> 07:45.300
 but just simply because it's a degree of computation,

07:45.300 --> 07:48.260
 and when you get beyond that certain degree of computation,

07:48.260 --> 07:49.420
 it will become conscious,

07:49.420 --> 07:52.340
 then of course you have all these problems.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.380
 I mean, you might say, well,

07:53.380 --> 07:55.100
 one of the reasons you're doing AI

07:55.100 --> 07:57.100
 is because you want to send a device

07:57.100 --> 07:59.060
 out to some distant planet,

07:59.060 --> 08:01.180
 and you don't want to send a human out there,

08:01.180 --> 08:02.780
 because then you'd have to bring it back again,

08:02.780 --> 08:04.900
 and that costs you far more

08:04.900 --> 08:07.100
 than just sending it there and leaving it there.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.020
 But if this device is actually a conscious entity,

08:10.020 --> 08:13.060
 then you have to face up to the fact that that's immoral.

08:13.060 --> 08:17.820
 And so the mere fact that you're making some AI device

08:17.820 --> 08:22.820
 and thinking that removes your responsibility to it

08:24.140 --> 08:25.820
 would be incorrect.

08:25.820 --> 08:29.700
 And so this is a sign of flaw in that kind of viewpoint.

08:29.700 --> 08:34.180
 I'm not sure how people who take it very seriously,

08:35.460 --> 08:37.140
 I mean, I had this curious conversation

08:37.140 --> 08:40.780
 with, I'm going to forget names, I'm afraid,

08:40.780 --> 08:43.860
 because this is what happens to me at the wrong moment,

08:43.860 --> 08:45.860
 Hofstadter, Douglas Hofstadter.

08:45.860 --> 08:46.820
 Douglas Hofstadter, yeah.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.860
 And he'd written this book,

08:48.860 --> 08:50.340
 God Will Let You Up, which I liked.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.300
 I thought it was a fantastic book.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.700
 But I didn't agree with his conclusion

08:55.700 --> 08:56.580
 from Gödel's theorem.

08:56.580 --> 08:58.580
 I think he got it wrong, you see.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.220
 Well, I'll just tell you my story, you see,

09:01.220 --> 09:02.700
 because I'd never met him.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.740
 And then I knew I was going to meet him,

09:04.740 --> 09:06.860
 the occasion I realized he was coming in,

09:06.860 --> 09:09.140
 he wanted to talk to me, and I said, that's fine.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.460
 And I thought in my mind,

09:10.460 --> 09:12.620
 well, I'm going to paint him into a corner, you see,

09:12.620 --> 09:15.780
 because I'll use his arguments to convince him

09:15.780 --> 09:19.340
 that certain numbers are conscious.

09:19.340 --> 09:22.620
 Some integers, large enough integers are actually conscious.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.420
 And this was going to be my reductio ad absurdum.

09:25.420 --> 09:26.900
 So I started having this argument with him.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.660
 He simply leapt into the corner.

09:28.660 --> 09:31.020
 He didn't even need to be painted into it.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.900
 He took the view that certain numbers were conscious.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.780
 I thought that was a reductio ad absurdum,

09:35.780 --> 09:37.620
 but he seemed to think it was perfectly

09:37.620 --> 09:38.860
 a reasonable point of view.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.620
 Without the absurdum there.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.540
 Yes.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.580
 Interesting, but the thing you mentioned about how

09:44.580 --> 09:46.940
 is the intuition that a lot of the people,

09:46.940 --> 09:48.900
 at least in the artificial intelligence world,

09:48.900 --> 09:51.500
 had and have, I think.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.700
 They don't make it explicit,

09:52.700 --> 09:56.820
 but that if you increase the power of computation,

09:56.820 --> 09:58.980
 naturally consciousness will emerge.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.300
 Yes, I think that's what they think.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.300
 But basically that's because

10:01.300 --> 10:02.740
 they can't think of anything else.

10:02.740 --> 10:03.580
 Well, that's right.

10:03.580 --> 10:05.340
 And so it's a reasonable thing.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.540
 I mean, you think, what does the brain do?

10:06.540 --> 10:09.140
 Well, it does do a lot of computation.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.540
 I think most of what you actually call computation

10:11.540 --> 10:13.260
 is done by the cerebellum.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.620
 I mean, this is one of the things

10:15.620 --> 10:17.820
 that people don't much mention.

10:17.820 --> 10:19.740
 I mean, I come to this subject from the outside

10:19.740 --> 10:21.860
 and certain things strike me,

10:21.860 --> 10:24.700
 which you hardly ever hear mentioned.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.420
 I mean, you hear mentioned about the left right business.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.340
 They move your right arm,

10:30.340 --> 10:31.900
 that's the left side of the brain

10:31.900 --> 10:34.940
 and so on and all that sort of stuff.

10:34.940 --> 10:36.780
 And it's more than that.

10:36.780 --> 10:40.460
 If you have these plots of different parts of the brain,

10:40.460 --> 10:43.300
 there are two of these things called the homunculi,

10:43.300 --> 10:47.500
 which you see these pictures of a distorted human figure

10:47.500 --> 10:51.420
 and showing different parts of the brain,

10:51.420 --> 10:53.140
 controlling different parts of the body.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.900
 And it's not simply things like,

10:55.900 --> 10:58.020
 okay, the right hand is controlled

10:58.020 --> 11:03.020
 and both sensory and motor on the left side,

11:03.020 --> 11:04.820
 left hand on the right side.

11:04.820 --> 11:05.940
 It's more than that.

11:05.940 --> 11:08.620
 Vision is the back basically,

11:08.620 --> 11:11.020
 your feet at the top.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.060
 And it's as though it's about the worst organization

11:13.060 --> 11:14.820
 you could imagine.

11:14.820 --> 11:17.540
 So it can't just be a mistake in nature.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.460
 There's something going on there.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.660
 And this is made more pronounced

11:22.660 --> 11:25.660
 when you think of the cerebellum.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.540
 The cerebellum has,

11:27.540 --> 11:29.340
 when I was first thinking about these things,

11:29.340 --> 11:32.020
 I was told that it had half as many neurons

11:32.020 --> 11:33.940
 or something like that, comparable.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.500
 And now they tell me it's got far more neurons

11:36.500 --> 11:39.780
 than the cerebrum, and cerebrum is this sort of

11:39.780 --> 11:42.020
 convoluted thing at the top people always talk about.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.220
 Cerebellum is this thing just looks a bit like

11:44.220 --> 11:47.900
 a ball of wool right at the back underneath them.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.460
 It's got more neurons.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.620
 It's got more connections.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.140
 Computationally, it's got much more going on

11:55.140 --> 11:57.100
 than this from the cerebrum.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.380
 But as far as we know, that's slightly controversial,

12:01.380 --> 12:04.820
 the cerebellum is entirely unconscious.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.300
 So the actions, you have a pianist

12:07.300 --> 12:09.020
 who plays an incredible piece of music

12:09.020 --> 12:11.940
 and think of, and he moves his little finger

12:11.940 --> 12:14.140
 into this little key to get it, hit it,

12:14.140 --> 12:15.900
 just the right moment.

12:15.900 --> 12:20.780
 Does he or she consciously will that movement?

12:20.780 --> 12:21.620
 No.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.660
 Okay, the consciousness is coming in.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.060
 It's probably to do with the feeling

12:26.060 --> 12:28.780
 of the piece of music that's being performed

12:28.780 --> 12:31.220
 and that sort of thing, which is going on.

12:31.220 --> 12:35.020
 But the details of what's going on are controlled.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.540
 I would think almost entirely by the cerebellum.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.380
 That's where you have this precision

12:40.380 --> 12:44.020
 and the really detailed.

12:44.020 --> 12:47.260
 Once you get, I mean, you think of a tennis player

12:47.260 --> 12:48.860
 or something, does that tennis player

12:48.860 --> 12:51.940
 think exactly which muscles should be moved

12:51.940 --> 12:52.940
 in what direction and so on?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.380
 No, of course not.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.220
 But he or she will maybe think,

12:56.220 --> 12:59.340
 well, if the ball is angled in such a way in that corner,

12:59.340 --> 13:02.020
 that will be tricky for the opponent.

13:02.020 --> 13:05.060
 And the details of that are all done

13:06.420 --> 13:08.740
 largely with the cerebellum.

13:08.740 --> 13:11.540
 That's where all the precise motions,

13:11.540 --> 13:13.060
 but it's unconscious.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.420
 So why is it interesting to you

13:14.420 --> 13:17.940
 that so much computation is done in the cerebellum

13:17.940 --> 13:19.340
 and yet it is unconscious?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.980
 Because it doesn't, it's the view

13:21.980 --> 13:24.580
 that somehow it's computation

13:24.580 --> 13:27.340
 which is producing the consciousness.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.740
 And it's here you have an incredible amount

13:30.740 --> 13:32.100
 of computation going on.

13:33.220 --> 13:35.820
 And as far as we know, it's completely unconscious.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.460
 So why, what's the difference?

13:39.460 --> 13:41.860
 And I think it's an important thing.

13:41.860 --> 13:42.980
 What's the difference?

13:43.900 --> 13:47.620
 Why is the cerebrum, all this very peculiar stuff

13:47.620 --> 13:51.300
 that very hard to see on a computational perspective,

13:51.300 --> 13:53.940
 like having the, everything have to cross over

13:53.940 --> 13:55.620
 under the other side and do something

13:55.620 --> 13:57.300
 which looks completely inefficient.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.540
 And you've got funny things like the frontal lobe

14:01.540 --> 14:04.660
 and the, what do we call the lobes?

14:04.660 --> 14:06.620
 And the place where they come together,

14:07.820 --> 14:12.340
 you have the different parts, the control,

14:12.340 --> 14:13.740
 you see one to do with motor

14:13.740 --> 14:15.340
 and the other to do with sensory.

14:16.340 --> 14:17.900
 And they're sort of opposite each other

14:17.900 --> 14:19.460
 rather than being connected by,

14:20.860 --> 14:23.460
 it's not as though you've got electrical circuits.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.300
 There's something else going on there.

14:26.300 --> 14:30.260
 So it's just the idea that it's like a complicated computer

14:30.260 --> 14:34.580
 just seems to me to be completely missing the point.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.380
 There must be a lot of computation going on,

14:37.380 --> 14:40.340
 but the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that

14:40.340 --> 14:41.540
 than the cerebrum is.

14:42.820 --> 14:47.820
 So for sure, I think what explains it is like half hope

14:47.940 --> 14:49.700
 and half we don't know what's going on.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.420
 And therefore from the computer science perspective,

14:52.420 --> 14:56.340
 you hope that a Turing machine can be perfectly,

14:56.340 --> 14:58.020
 can achieve general intelligence.

14:58.020 --> 15:02.220
 Well, you have this wonderful thing about Turing

15:02.220 --> 15:07.220
 and Gödel and Church and Curry and various people,

15:07.500 --> 15:11.660
 particularly Turing, and I guess Post was the other one.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.340
 These people who developed the idea

15:14.340 --> 15:15.880
 of what a computation is.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.900
 And there were different ideas of what a computation,

15:19.900 --> 15:20.740
 developed differently.

15:20.740 --> 15:21.820
 I mean, Church's way of doing it,

15:21.820 --> 15:24.620
 was very different from Turing's,

15:24.620 --> 15:26.820
 but then they were shown to be equivalent.

15:26.820 --> 15:30.860
 And so the view emerged that what we mean by computation

15:32.060 --> 15:33.860
 is a very clear concept.

15:34.820 --> 15:37.860
 And one of the wonderful things that Turing did

15:37.860 --> 15:40.180
 was to show that you could have

15:40.180 --> 15:43.260
 what we call the universal Turing machine.

15:43.260 --> 15:46.300
 It's you just have to have a certain finite device.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.580
 Okay, it has to have an unlimited storage space,

15:48.580 --> 15:50.180
 which is accessible to it,

15:50.180 --> 15:51.960
 but the actual computation, if you like,

15:51.960 --> 15:55.980
 is performed by this one universal device.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.740
 And so the view comes away,

15:57.740 --> 16:01.340
 well, you have this universal Turing machine,

16:01.340 --> 16:03.820
 and maybe the brain is something like that,

16:03.820 --> 16:05.140
 a universal Turing machine,

16:05.140 --> 16:08.620
 and it's got maybe not unlimited storage,

16:08.620 --> 16:12.660
 but a huge storage accessible to it.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.380
 And this model is one,

16:14.380 --> 16:17.380
 which is what's used in ordinary computation.

16:17.380 --> 16:19.260
 It's a very powerful model.

16:19.260 --> 16:24.260
 And the universallness of computation is very useful.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.180
 You could have some problem

16:26.180 --> 16:27.580
 and you may not see immediately

16:27.580 --> 16:29.140
 how to put it onto a computer,

16:29.140 --> 16:32.200
 but if it is something of that nature,

16:32.200 --> 16:36.220
 then there are all sorts of subprograms

16:36.220 --> 16:37.580
 and subroutines when all the,

16:37.580 --> 16:38.940
 I mean, I learned a little bit of computing

16:38.940 --> 16:42.580
 when I was a student, but not very much.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.060
 But it was enough to get the general ideas.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.480
 And there's something really pleasant

16:46.480 --> 16:48.980
 about a formal system like that.

16:48.980 --> 16:49.820
 Yeah.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.420
 Where you can start discussing about what's provable,

16:51.420 --> 16:52.740
 what's not, these kinds of things.

16:52.740 --> 16:55.340
 And you've got a notion, which is an absolute notion,

16:55.340 --> 16:56.820
 this notion of computability,

16:56.820 --> 17:00.260
 and you can address when things are,

17:00.260 --> 17:02.820
 mathematical problems are computably solvable

17:02.820 --> 17:03.660
 and what chance.

17:03.660 --> 17:04.500
 So.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.720
 And it's a very beautiful area of mathematics,

17:06.720 --> 17:09.700
 and it's a very powerful area of mathematics.

17:09.700 --> 17:13.620
 And it underlies the whole sort of,

17:14.580 --> 17:18.500
 I won't say, the principles of computing machines

17:18.500 --> 17:19.700
 that we have today.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.820
 Could you say, what is Gayle's Incompleteness Theorem?

17:22.820 --> 17:24.860
 And how does it, maybe also say,

17:24.860 --> 17:26.500
 is it heartbreaking to you?

17:26.500 --> 17:31.100
 And how does it interfere with this notion of computation

17:31.100 --> 17:32.660
 and consciousness?

17:32.660 --> 17:33.500
 Sure.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.060
 Well, the ideas, basically ideas,

17:36.060 --> 17:39.140
 which I formulated in my first year

17:39.140 --> 17:41.540
 as a graduate student in Cambridge.

17:41.540 --> 17:44.700
 I did my undergraduate work in mathematics in London,

17:44.700 --> 17:47.460
 and I had a colleague, Ian Percival.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.780
 We used to discuss things like computational

17:49.780 --> 17:52.300
 and logical systems quite a lot.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.660
 I'd heard about Gayle's theorem.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.860
 I was a bit worried by the idea that it seemed to say

17:55.860 --> 17:59.620
 there were things in mathematics that you could never prove.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.140
 And so when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student,

18:04.100 --> 18:06.020
 I went to various courses.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.540
 You see, I was doing pure mathematics.

18:08.540 --> 18:11.980
 I was doing algebraic geometry of a sort.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.280
 A little bit different from what my supervisor and people,

18:15.280 --> 18:16.780
 but it was algebraic geometry.

18:16.780 --> 18:17.620
 Yeah.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.260
 And I was interested,

18:20.260 --> 18:24.860
 I got particularly interested in three lecture courses

18:24.860 --> 18:27.020
 that were nothing to do with what I was supposed

18:27.020 --> 18:28.260
 to be doing.

18:28.260 --> 18:30.580
 One was a course by Herman Bondy

18:30.580 --> 18:33.500
 on Einstein's general theory of relativity,

18:33.500 --> 18:34.620
 which was a beautiful course.

18:34.620 --> 18:37.540
 He was an amazing lecturer,

18:37.540 --> 18:40.260
 brought these things alive, absolutely.

18:40.260 --> 18:43.360
 Another was a course on quantum mechanics

18:43.360 --> 18:47.060
 given by a great physicist, Paul Dirac.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.560
 Very beautiful course in a completely different way.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.460
 It was, he was very kind of organized

18:52.460 --> 18:56.380
 and never got excited about anything seemingly.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.640
 But it was extremely well put together.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.340
 And I found that amazing too.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.780
 Third course that was nothing to do

19:04.780 --> 19:06.580
 with what I should be doing was a course

19:06.580 --> 19:08.100
 on mathematical logic.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.860
 I got excited, as I say, my discussions with Ian Percival

19:12.860 --> 19:15.980
 was incompleteness theorem already deeply

19:15.980 --> 19:18.740
 within mathematical logic space.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.200
 Were you introduced to it?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.880
 I was introduced to it in detail by the course, by Steen.

19:25.020 --> 19:27.820
 And he, it was two things he described

19:27.820 --> 19:31.040
 which were very fundamental to my understanding.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.260
 One was Turing machines and the whole idea

19:34.260 --> 19:35.820
 of computability and all that.

19:35.820 --> 19:38.300
 So that was all very much part of the course.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.460
 The other one was the Gödel theorem.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.500
 And it wasn't what I was afraid it was

19:43.500 --> 19:45.180
 to tell you there were things in mathematics

19:45.180 --> 19:46.180
 you couldn't prove.

19:47.060 --> 19:51.340
 It was basically, and he phrased it in a way

19:51.340 --> 19:53.100
 which often people didn't.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.860
 And if you read Douglas Soft status book,

19:54.860 --> 19:56.420
 he doesn't, you see.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.220
 But Steen made it very clear.

19:58.220 --> 20:01.140
 And also in a sort of public lecture

20:01.140 --> 20:02.900
 that he gave to a mathematical,

20:02.900 --> 20:04.340
 I think it may be the Adams Society,

20:04.340 --> 20:07.140
 one of the mathematical undergraduate societies.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.460
 And he made this point again very clearly.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.780
 That if you've got a formal system of proof,

20:11.780 --> 20:15.160
 so suppose what you mean by proof

20:15.160 --> 20:19.140
 is something which you could check with a computer.

20:19.140 --> 20:21.220
 So to say whether you've got it right or not,

20:21.220 --> 20:22.340
 you've got a lot of steps.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.940
 Have you carried this computational procedure?

20:25.940 --> 20:30.520
 Well, following the proof, steps of the proof correctly,

20:30.520 --> 20:35.420
 that can be checked by an algorithm, by a computer.

20:35.420 --> 20:38.780
 So that's the key thing.

20:38.780 --> 20:43.780
 Now what you have to, now you see, is this any good?

20:44.420 --> 20:47.260
 If you've got an algorithmic system,

20:47.260 --> 20:49.940
 which claims to say, yes, this is right,

20:49.940 --> 20:52.620
 this you've proved it correctly, this is true.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.820
 If you've proved it, if you made a mistake,

20:54.820 --> 20:55.980
 it doesn't say it's true or false.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.940
 But if you have, if you've done it right,

20:57.940 --> 21:01.980
 then the conclusion you've come to is correct.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.900
 Now you say, why do you believe it's correct?

21:03.900 --> 21:05.420
 Because you've looked at the rules and you said,

21:05.420 --> 21:06.720
 well, okay, that one's all right.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.560
 Yeah, that one's all right.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.380
 What about that?

21:08.380 --> 21:10.100
 Oh, yeah, I see, I see why it's all right.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.020
 Okay, you go through all the rules.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.840
 You say, yes, following those rules,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.940
 if it says, yes, it's true, it is true.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.940
 So you've got to make sure that these rules

21:19.940 --> 21:21.980
 are ones that you trust.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.020
 If you follow the rules and it says it's a proof,

21:25.020 --> 21:27.060
 is the result actually true?

21:27.060 --> 21:27.900
 Right.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.660
 And that your belief that it's true

21:29.660 --> 21:33.140
 depends upon looking at the rules and understanding them.

21:33.140 --> 21:37.300
 Now, what Gödel shows, that if you have such a system,

21:38.180 --> 21:41.220
 then you can construct a statement of the very kind

21:41.220 --> 21:44.380
 that it's supposed to look at, a mathematical statement,

21:44.380 --> 21:47.660
 and you can see by the way it's constructed

21:47.660 --> 21:51.180
 and what it means that it's true,

21:52.380 --> 21:56.620
 but not provable by the rules that you've been given.

21:56.620 --> 21:59.660
 And it depends on your trust in the rules.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.300
 Do you believe that the rules only give you truths?

22:02.300 --> 22:04.260
 If you believe the rules only give you truths,

22:04.260 --> 22:07.620
 then you believe this other statement is also true.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.900
 I found this absolutely mind blowing.

22:09.900 --> 22:12.660
 When I saw this, it blew my mind.

22:12.660 --> 22:17.060
 I thought, my God, you can see that this statement is true.

22:17.060 --> 22:18.940
 It's as good as any proof,

22:18.940 --> 22:21.860
 because it only depends on your belief

22:21.860 --> 22:25.700
 in the reliability of the proof procedure, that's all it is,

22:25.700 --> 22:29.260
 and understanding that the coding is done correctly.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.900
 And it enables you to transcend that system.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.260
 So whatever system you have,

22:36.260 --> 22:39.020
 as long as you can understand what it's doing

22:39.020 --> 22:41.980
 and why you believe it only gives you truths,

22:41.980 --> 22:43.780
 then you can see beyond that system.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.220
 Now, how do you see beyond it?

22:46.220 --> 22:51.220
 What is it that enables you to transcend that system?

22:51.740 --> 22:53.260
 Well, it's your understanding

22:53.260 --> 22:55.740
 of what the system is actually saying

22:55.740 --> 22:57.620
 and what the statement that you've constructed

22:57.620 --> 22:59.460
 is actually saying.

22:59.460 --> 23:03.140
 So it's this quality of understanding, whatever it is,

23:03.140 --> 23:05.540
 which is not governed by rules.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.420
 It's not a computational procedure.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.660
 So this idea of understanding is not going to be

23:09.660 --> 23:13.420
 within the rules of the, within the formal system.

23:13.420 --> 23:15.940
 Yes, you're only using those rules anyway,

23:15.940 --> 23:18.340
 because you have understood them to be rules

23:18.340 --> 23:20.260
 which only give you truths.

23:20.260 --> 23:22.260
 There'd be no point in it otherwise.

23:22.260 --> 23:24.300
 I mean, people say, well, okay, this is,

23:24.300 --> 23:28.020
 it's one set of rules as good as any other.

23:28.020 --> 23:28.860
 Well, it's not true.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.580
 You see, you have to understand what the rules mean.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.580
 And why does that understanding of the mean

23:33.580 --> 23:36.340
 give you something beyond the rules themselves?

23:36.340 --> 23:37.340
 And that's what it was.

23:37.340 --> 23:38.620
 That's what blew my mind.

23:38.620 --> 23:43.620
 It's somehow understanding why the rules give you truths

23:43.820 --> 23:45.900
 enables you to transcend the rules.

23:45.900 --> 23:48.060
 So that's where, I mean, even at that time,

23:48.060 --> 23:50.900
 that's already where the thought entered your mind

23:50.900 --> 23:55.340
 that the idea of understanding, or we can start calling it

23:55.340 --> 23:57.980
 things like intelligence or even consciousness

23:57.980 --> 23:59.660
 is outside the rules.

23:59.660 --> 24:00.500
 Yes.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.900
 See, I've always concentrated on understanding.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.300
 You know, people say, people come and point out things.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.140
 Well, you know, what about creativity?

24:07.140 --> 24:09.100
 That's something a machine can't do is create.

24:09.100 --> 24:09.940
 Well, I don't know.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.260
 What is creativity?

24:11.260 --> 24:12.100
 And I don't know.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.860
 You know, somebody can put some funny things

24:13.860 --> 24:15.620
 on a piece of paper and say that's creative

24:15.620 --> 24:16.900
 and you could make a machine do that.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.100
 Is it really creative?

24:18.100 --> 24:18.940
 I don't know.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.540
 You see, I worry about that one.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.860
 I sort of agree with it in a sense,

24:22.860 --> 24:25.460
 but it's so hard to do anything with that statement.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.740
 But understanding, yes, you can.

24:27.740 --> 24:32.580
 You can make, go see that understanding, whatever it is,

24:32.580 --> 24:34.300
 and it's very hard to put your finger on it.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.740
 That's absolutely true.

24:35.740 --> 24:39.620
 Can you try to define or maybe dance around

24:39.620 --> 24:41.980
 a definition of understanding?

24:41.980 --> 24:45.980
 To some degree, but I don't, I often wondered about this,

24:45.980 --> 24:48.900
 but there is something there which is very slippery.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.700
 It's something like standing back.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.140
 And it's got to be something, you see,

24:54.140 --> 24:56.940
 it's also got to be something which was of value

24:56.940 --> 24:58.900
 to our remote ancestors.

24:58.900 --> 24:59.740
 Right.

24:59.740 --> 25:01.540
 Because sometimes, there's a cartoon

25:01.540 --> 25:04.940
 which I drew sometimes showing you how all these,

25:04.940 --> 25:07.140
 there's in the foreground, you see this mathematician

25:07.140 --> 25:08.860
 just doing some mathematical theorem.

25:08.860 --> 25:10.500
 There's a little bit of a joke in that theorem,

25:10.500 --> 25:12.300
 but let's not go into that.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.420
 He's trying to prove some theorem.

25:14.420 --> 25:17.820
 And he's about to be eaten by a saber tooth tiger

25:17.820 --> 25:21.260
 who's hiding in the undergrowth, you see.

25:21.260 --> 25:24.340
 And in the distance, you see his cousins

25:24.340 --> 25:29.100
 building, growing crops, building shelters,

25:29.100 --> 25:31.980
 domesticating animals, and in the slight foreground,

25:31.980 --> 25:33.340
 you see they've built a mammoth trap

25:33.340 --> 25:36.660
 and this poor old mammoth is falling into a pit, you see,

25:36.660 --> 25:39.540
 and all these people around them are about to grab him,

25:39.540 --> 25:43.380
 you see, and well, you see, those are the ones who,

25:43.380 --> 25:47.300
 the quality of understanding, which goes with all,

25:47.300 --> 25:50.740
 it's not just the mathematician doing his mathematics,

25:50.740 --> 25:53.660
 this understanding quality is something else,

25:53.660 --> 25:58.100
 which has been a tremendous advantage to us,

25:58.100 --> 25:59.660
 not just to us.

25:59.660 --> 26:03.700
 See, I don't think consciousness is limited to humans.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.900
 Yeah, that's the interesting question,

26:04.900 --> 26:07.380
 at which point, if it is indeed connected

26:07.380 --> 26:09.140
 to the evolutionary process,

26:09.140 --> 26:11.420
 at which point did we pick up this?

26:11.420 --> 26:13.420
 A very hard question.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.860
 It's certainly, I don't think it's primates,

26:15.860 --> 26:20.380
 you know, you see these pictures of African hunting dogs

26:20.380 --> 26:22.780
 and how they can plan amongst themselves

26:22.780 --> 26:24.340
 how to catch the antelopes.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.540
 Some of these David Attenborough films,

26:27.540 --> 26:29.180
 I think this probably was one of them,

26:29.180 --> 26:31.740
 and you could see the hunting dogs,

26:31.740 --> 26:34.300
 and they divide themselves into two groups

26:34.300 --> 26:36.820
 and they go in two routes, two different routes.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.660
 One of them goes and they sort of hide next to the river.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.420
 And the other group goes around

26:42.420 --> 26:46.460
 and they start yelping at these, they don't bark,

26:46.460 --> 26:48.980
 I guess whatever noise hunting dogs do,

26:48.980 --> 26:51.020
 the antelopes, and they sort of round them up

26:51.020 --> 26:54.500
 and they chase them in the direction of the river.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.580
 And there are the other ones just waiting for them,

26:56.580 --> 26:58.900
 just to get, because when they get to the river,

26:58.900 --> 27:00.300
 it slows them down.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.060
 And so they pounce on them.

27:02.060 --> 27:05.460
 So they've obviously planned this all out somehow.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.740
 I have no idea how.

27:07.660 --> 27:11.460
 And there is some element of conscious planning,

27:11.460 --> 27:12.300
 as far as I can see.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.300
 I don't think it's just some kind of,

27:16.140 --> 27:19.580
 so much of AI these days is done on what they call

27:19.580 --> 27:21.060
 bottom up systems, is it?

27:21.060 --> 27:23.660
 Yeah, where you have neural networks

27:23.660 --> 27:27.460
 and you give them a zillion different things to look at

27:27.460 --> 27:32.460
 and then they sort of can choose one thing over another,

27:33.780 --> 27:35.460
 just because it's seen so many examples

27:35.460 --> 27:38.380
 and picks up on little signals,

27:38.380 --> 27:41.540
 which one may not even be conscious of.

27:41.540 --> 27:43.140
 And that doesn't feel like understanding.

27:43.140 --> 27:46.100
 There's no understanding in that whatsoever.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.460
 Well, you're being a little bit human centric, so.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.860
 Well, I'm talking about, I'm not with the dogs, am I?

27:52.860 --> 27:53.700
 No, you're not.

27:53.700 --> 27:56.740
 Sorry, not human centric, but I misspoke.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.340
 Biology centric.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.940
 Is it possible that consciousness

28:00.940 --> 28:03.220
 would just look slightly different?

28:03.220 --> 28:04.700
 Well, I'm not saying it's biological,

28:04.700 --> 28:06.620
 because we don't know.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.500
 I think other examples of elephants

28:08.500 --> 28:10.660
 is a wonderful example, too.

28:10.660 --> 28:13.980
 Where they, this was, I think this was an Attenborough one,

28:13.980 --> 28:17.220
 where the elephants have to go from along,

28:17.220 --> 28:20.100
 the troop of them have to go long distances.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.620
 And the leader of a troop is a female.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.500
 They all are, apparently.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.820
 And this female, she had to go all the way

28:26.820 --> 28:30.100
 from one part of the country to another.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.460
 And at a certain point, she made a detour.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.020
 And they went off in this big detour.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.100
 All the troop came with her.

28:37.100 --> 28:39.580
 And this was where her sister had died.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.540
 And there were her bones lying around.

28:41.540 --> 28:42.820
 And they're going to pick up the bones,

28:42.820 --> 28:45.780
 and they hand it around, and they caress the bones.

28:45.780 --> 28:48.580
 And then they put them back, and they go back again.

28:48.580 --> 28:51.300
 What in the hell are they doing?

28:51.300 --> 28:52.260
 That's so interesting.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.540
 I mean, there's something going on.

28:54.540 --> 28:59.500
 There's no clear connection with natural selection.

28:59.500 --> 29:03.060
 There's just some deep feeling going on there,

29:03.060 --> 29:05.660
 which has to do with their conscious experience.

29:06.980 --> 29:09.940
 And I think it's something that, overall,

29:09.940 --> 29:14.940
 is advantageous, our natural selection,

29:15.020 --> 29:17.380
 but not directly to do with natural selection.

29:18.740 --> 29:19.580
 I like that.

29:19.580 --> 29:22.540
 There's something going on there.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.340
 Like I told you, I'm Russian,

29:24.340 --> 29:28.140
 so I tend to romanticize all things of this nature,

29:28.140 --> 29:33.140
 that it's not merely cold, hard computation.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.660
 Perhaps I could just slightly answer your question.

29:35.660 --> 29:38.620
 You were asking me, what is it?

29:38.620 --> 29:41.820
 There's something about sort of standing back

29:41.820 --> 29:44.820
 and thinking about your own thought processes.

29:44.820 --> 29:47.780
 I mean, there is something like that in the Gödel thing,

29:47.780 --> 29:50.260
 because you're not following the rules.

29:50.260 --> 29:53.500
 You're standing back and thinking about the rules.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.940
 And so there is something that you might say,

29:56.940 --> 29:58.220
 you think about you're doing something,

29:58.220 --> 30:00.140
 and you think, what the hell am I doing?

30:00.140 --> 30:02.140
 And you sort of stand back and think about

30:02.140 --> 30:05.060
 what it is that's making you think in such a way.

30:05.060 --> 30:08.500
 Just take a step back outside the game you've been playing.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.660
 Yeah, you back up and you think about,

30:10.660 --> 30:12.580
 you're just not playing the game anymore.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.660
 You're thinking about what the hell you're doing

30:14.660 --> 30:16.060
 in playing this game.

30:16.060 --> 30:18.260
 And that's somehow,

30:18.260 --> 30:20.540
 it's not a very precise description,

30:20.540 --> 30:22.260
 but somehow it feels very true

30:22.260 --> 30:24.620
 that that's somehow understanding.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.420
 This kind of reflection.

30:26.420 --> 30:27.740
 The reflection, yes.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.580
 Yeah, it's a bit hard to put your finger on,

30:30.580 --> 30:31.580
 but there is something there,

30:31.580 --> 30:34.420
 which I think maybe could be unearthed at some point

30:34.420 --> 30:36.860
 and see this is really what's going on,

30:36.860 --> 30:40.100
 why conscious beings have this advantage,

30:40.100 --> 30:42.740
 what it is that gives them advantage.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.220
 And I think it goes way back.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.780
 I don't think we're talking about the hunting dogs

30:46.780 --> 30:47.700
 and the elephants.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.860
 It's pretty clear that octopuses have

30:51.860 --> 30:53.380
 the same sort of quality,

30:53.380 --> 30:54.460
 and we call it consciousness.

30:54.460 --> 30:55.700
 Yeah, I think so.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.740
 Seen enough examples of the way that they behave

30:58.740 --> 31:02.500
 and the evolution route is completely different.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.900
 Does it go way back to some common ancestor

31:05.900 --> 31:07.580
 or did it come separately?

31:07.580 --> 31:09.380
 My hope is it's something simple,

31:09.380 --> 31:13.460
 but the hard question if there's a hardware prerequisite.

31:13.460 --> 31:17.820
 We have to develop some kind of hardware mechanisms

31:17.820 --> 31:19.180
 in our computers.

31:19.180 --> 31:21.100
 Like basically, as you suggest,

31:21.100 --> 31:22.580
 we'll get to in a second,

31:22.580 --> 31:24.460
 we kind of have to throw away the computer

31:24.460 --> 31:26.100
 as we know it today.

31:26.100 --> 31:26.940
 Yeah.

31:26.940 --> 31:28.340
 The deterministic machines we know today

31:28.340 --> 31:29.740
 to try to create it.

31:29.740 --> 31:33.380
 I mean, my hope, of course, is not, but...

31:35.180 --> 31:37.740
 Well, I should go really back to the story

31:37.740 --> 31:39.820
 which, in a sense, I haven't finished

31:39.820 --> 31:41.780
 because I went to these three courses, you see,

31:41.780 --> 31:43.900
 when I was a graduate student.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.940
 And so I started to think, well, I'm really,

31:46.940 --> 31:49.660
 I'm a pretty, what you might call a materialist

31:49.660 --> 31:53.620
 in the sense of thinking that there's no kind of mystical

31:53.620 --> 31:55.980
 something or other which comes in from who knows where.

31:55.980 --> 31:56.820
 You still that?

31:56.820 --> 31:58.540
 Are you still, throughout your life, been a materialist?

31:58.540 --> 32:00.020
 I don't like the word materialist

32:00.020 --> 32:02.820
 because it suggests we know what material is.

32:02.820 --> 32:06.060
 And that is a bad word because...

32:06.060 --> 32:07.620
 But there's no mystical.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.180
 It's not some mystical something

32:09.180 --> 32:11.740
 which is not treatable by science.

32:11.740 --> 32:12.700
 That's so beautifully put,

32:12.700 --> 32:14.300
 just to pause on that for a second.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.020
 You're a materialist, but you acknowledge

32:17.020 --> 32:19.140
 that we don't really know what the material is.

32:19.140 --> 32:19.980
 That's right.

32:19.980 --> 32:24.300
 I mean, I like to call myself a scientist, I suppose,

32:24.300 --> 32:26.180
 but it means that...

32:27.700 --> 32:30.500
 Yes, well, you see, the question goes on here.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.180
 So I began thinking, okay, if consciousness

32:33.180 --> 32:35.900
 or understanding is something

32:35.900 --> 32:40.020
 which is not a computational process, what can it be?

32:40.020 --> 32:42.300
 And I knew enough from my undergraduate work.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.500
 I knew about Newtonian mechanics,

32:44.500 --> 32:50.140
 and I knew how basically you could put it on a computer.

32:50.140 --> 32:54.180
 There is a fundamental issue, which is it important or not?

32:54.180 --> 32:59.620
 That computation depends upon discrete things.

32:59.620 --> 33:02.300
 So you're using discrete elements,

33:02.300 --> 33:06.260
 whereas the physical laws depend on the continuum.

33:06.260 --> 33:09.660
 Now, is this something to do with it?

33:09.660 --> 33:12.820
 Is it the fact that we use the continuum in our physics?

33:12.820 --> 33:15.260
 And if we model our physical system,

33:15.260 --> 33:17.940
 we use discrete systems like ordinary computers?

33:19.020 --> 33:22.180
 I came to the view that that's probably not it.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.860
 I might have to retract on that someday,

33:24.860 --> 33:28.340
 but the view was no, you can get close enough.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.900
 It's not altogether clear, I have to say,

33:30.900 --> 33:32.980
 but you can get close enough.

33:32.980 --> 33:37.020
 And I went to this course by Bondi on general relativity,

33:37.020 --> 33:39.500
 and I thought, well, you can put that on a computer,

33:39.500 --> 33:42.820
 because that was a long time before people,

33:42.820 --> 33:43.980
 and I've sort of grown up with this,

33:43.980 --> 33:46.220
 how people have done better and better calculations,

33:46.220 --> 33:48.300
 and they could work out about black holes,

33:48.300 --> 33:50.380
 and they can then work out how black holes

33:50.380 --> 33:52.700
 can interact with each other, spiral around,

33:52.700 --> 33:55.020
 and what kind of gravitational waves can out.

33:55.020 --> 33:58.620
 And it's a very impressive piece of computational work,

33:58.620 --> 34:01.900
 how you can actually work out the shapes of those signals.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.020
 And now we have LIGO seeing these signals,

34:04.020 --> 34:07.340
 and they say, yeah, those black holes spiral into each other.

34:07.340 --> 34:11.700
 This is just a vindication of the power of computation

34:11.700 --> 34:16.020
 in describing Einstein's general relativity.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.620
 So in that case, we can get close,

34:18.620 --> 34:22.060
 but with computation, we can get close

34:22.060 --> 34:23.340
 to our understanding of the physics.

34:23.340 --> 34:24.620
 You can get very, very close.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.900
 Now, is that close enough, you see?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.620
 And then I went to this course by Dirac.

34:29.620 --> 34:32.500
 Now, you see, I think it was the very first lecture

34:32.500 --> 34:35.420
 that he gave, and he was talking about

34:35.420 --> 34:37.500
 a superposition principle.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.900
 And he said, if you have a particle,

34:39.900 --> 34:41.860
 you usually think of particle can be over here

34:41.860 --> 34:44.100
 or over there, but in quantum mechanics,

34:44.100 --> 34:48.060
 it can be over here and over there at the same time.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.500
 And you have these states which involve

34:50.500 --> 34:52.740
 a superposition in some sense

34:52.740 --> 34:56.660
 of different locations for that particle.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.540
 And then he got out his piece of chalk.

34:58.540 --> 35:00.020
 Some people say he broke it in two

35:00.020 --> 35:03.020
 as a kind of illustration of how the piece of chalk

35:03.020 --> 35:05.820
 might be over here and over there at the same time.

35:06.700 --> 35:10.900
 And he was talking about this, and my mind wandered.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.340
 I don't remember what he said.

35:13.340 --> 35:16.460
 All I can remember, he's just moved on to the next topic,

35:16.460 --> 35:18.580
 and something about energy he'd mentioned,

35:18.580 --> 35:21.020
 which I had no idea what it had to do with anything.

35:21.020 --> 35:22.900
 And so I'd been struck with this

35:22.900 --> 35:25.260
 and worried about it ever since.

35:25.260 --> 35:27.780
 It's probably just as well I didn't hear his explanation

35:27.780 --> 35:29.340
 because it was probably one of these things

35:29.340 --> 35:32.100
 to calm me down and not worry about it anymore.

35:32.100 --> 35:35.900
 Whereas in my case, I've worried about it ever since.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.420
 So I thought maybe that's the catch.

35:38.420 --> 35:41.220
 There is something in quantum mechanics

35:41.220 --> 35:45.060
 where the superpositions become one or the other,

35:45.060 --> 35:47.820
 and that's not part of quantum mechanics.

35:47.820 --> 35:50.020
 There's something missing in the theory.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.620
 The theory is incomplete.

35:51.620 --> 35:52.580
 It's not just incomplete.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.900
 It's in a certain sense not quite right

35:54.900 --> 35:57.500
 because if you follow the equation,

35:57.500 --> 35:59.340
 the basic equation of quantum mechanics,

35:59.340 --> 36:01.220
 that's the Schrodinger equation,

36:01.220 --> 36:02.660
 you could put that on a computer too.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.780
 There are lots of difficulties

36:03.780 --> 36:06.180
 about how many parameters you have to put in and so on.

36:06.180 --> 36:07.500
 That can be very tricky,

36:07.500 --> 36:10.860
 but nevertheless, it is a computational process.

36:10.860 --> 36:14.940
 Modulo this question about the continuum as before,

36:14.940 --> 36:16.900
 but it's not clear that makes any difference.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.940
 So our theories of quantum mechanics

36:18.940 --> 36:20.980
 may be missing the same element

36:20.980 --> 36:23.740
 that the universal Turing machine

36:23.740 --> 36:25.500
 is missing about consciousness.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.420
 Yes, yes.

36:26.420 --> 36:29.700
 Yeah, this is the view I held is that you need a theory

36:29.700 --> 36:33.580
 and that what people call the reduction of the state

36:33.580 --> 36:35.780
 or the collapse of the wave function,

36:35.780 --> 36:36.780
 which you have to have,

36:36.780 --> 36:38.500
 otherwise quantum mechanics doesn't relate

36:38.500 --> 36:39.900
 to the world we see.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.420
 To make it relate to the world we see,

36:41.420 --> 36:45.140
 you've got to break the Schrodinger equation.

36:45.140 --> 36:49.220
 Schrodinger himself was absolutely appalled by this idea,

36:49.220 --> 36:50.900
 his own equation.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.620
 I mean, that's why he introduced

36:52.620 --> 36:56.340
 this famous Schrodinger's cat as a thought experiment.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.180
 He's really saying, look,

36:57.180 --> 36:59.580
 this is where my equation leads you into it.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.340
 There's something wrong,

37:01.340 --> 37:02.620
 something we haven't understood,

37:02.620 --> 37:05.260
 which is basically fundamental.

37:05.260 --> 37:07.860
 And so I was trying to put all these things together

37:07.860 --> 37:09.100
 and said, well, it's got to be

37:09.100 --> 37:11.860
 the noncomputability comes in there.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.780
 And I also can't quite remember when I thought this,

37:14.780 --> 37:18.100
 but it's when gravity is involved in quantum mechanics.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.820
 It's the combination of those two.

37:19.820 --> 37:20.980
 And that's that point

37:22.260 --> 37:25.980
 when you have good reasons to believe,

37:25.980 --> 37:27.580
 this came much later,

37:27.580 --> 37:29.860
 that I have good reason to believe

37:29.860 --> 37:32.860
 that the principles of general relativity

37:32.860 --> 37:34.180
 and those of quantum mechanics,

37:34.180 --> 37:35.980
 most particularly,

37:35.980 --> 37:39.260
 it's the basic principle of equivalence,

37:39.260 --> 37:41.340
 which goes back to Galileo.

37:41.340 --> 37:43.580
 If you fall freely,

37:43.580 --> 37:46.420
 you eliminate the gravitational field.

37:46.420 --> 37:48.140
 So you imagine Galileo

37:49.660 --> 37:51.460
 dropping his big rock and his little rock

37:51.460 --> 37:52.580
 from the leaning tower,

37:52.580 --> 37:54.300
 whether he actually ever did that or not,

37:54.300 --> 37:55.580
 pretty irrelevant.

37:55.580 --> 37:57.780
 And as the rocks fall to the ground,

37:57.780 --> 37:59.820
 you have a little insect sitting on one of them,

37:59.820 --> 38:01.380
 looking at the other one.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.220
 And it seems to think, oh, there's no gravity here.

38:04.220 --> 38:05.340
 Of course, it hits the ground

38:05.340 --> 38:07.900
 and then you realize something's difference going on.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.140
 But when it's in free fall,

38:10.140 --> 38:11.980
 the gravity has been eliminated.

38:11.980 --> 38:15.420
 Galileo understood that very beautifully.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.540
 He gives these wonderful examples of fireworks.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.380
 And you see the fireworks and explode,

38:20.380 --> 38:23.500
 and you see this fear of sparkling fireworks.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.860
 It remains as fear as it falls down,

38:26.860 --> 38:29.260
 as though there were no gravity.

38:29.260 --> 38:31.300
 So he understood that principle,

38:31.300 --> 38:33.580
 but he couldn't make a theory out of it.

38:33.580 --> 38:34.620
 Einstein came along,

38:34.620 --> 38:36.780
 used exactly the same principle.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.060
 And that's the basis

38:38.060 --> 38:40.420
 of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.580
 Now, there is a conflict.

38:43.580 --> 38:45.260
 This is something I did much, much later.

38:45.260 --> 38:47.540
 So this wasn't at those days,

38:47.540 --> 38:48.940
 much, much later.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.460
 You can see there is a basic conflict

38:51.460 --> 38:54.580
 between the principle of superposition,

38:54.580 --> 38:56.380
 the thing that Dirac was talking about,

38:56.380 --> 38:58.740
 and the principle of general covariance.

38:58.740 --> 39:01.060
 Well, principle of equivalence.

39:01.060 --> 39:03.740
 Gravitational field's equivalent to an acceleration.

39:03.740 --> 39:04.780
 Can you pause for a second?

39:04.780 --> 39:06.900
 What is the principle of equivalence?

39:06.900 --> 39:08.300
 It's this Galileo principle

39:08.300 --> 39:11.580
 that we can eliminate, at least locally.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.580
 You have to be in a small neighborhood

39:13.580 --> 39:16.460
 because if you have people dropping rocks

39:16.460 --> 39:18.100
 all around the world somewhere,

39:18.100 --> 39:19.940
 you can't get rid of it all at once.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.100
 But in the local neighborhood,

39:22.100 --> 39:24.300
 you can eliminate the gravitational field

39:24.300 --> 39:26.820
 by falling freely with it.

39:26.820 --> 39:28.540
 And we now see this with astronauts,

39:28.540 --> 39:30.700
 and they don't, you know, the Earth is right there.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.580
 You can see the great globe of the Earth

39:32.580 --> 39:33.980
 right beneath them.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.460
 But they don't care about it.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.860
 As far as they're concerned, there's no gravity.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.140
 They fall freely within the gravitational field,

39:42.140 --> 39:45.140
 and that gets rid of the gravitational field.

39:45.140 --> 39:46.740
 And that's the principle of equivalence.

39:46.740 --> 39:48.980
 So what's the contradiction?

39:48.980 --> 39:50.460
 What's the tension with superposition

39:50.460 --> 39:51.300
 and equivalence?

39:51.300 --> 39:52.780
 Oh, well, that's technical.

39:52.780 --> 39:55.100
 So just to backtrack for a second

39:55.100 --> 39:57.980
 just to see if we can weave a thread through it all.

39:57.980 --> 40:02.340
 So we started to think about consciousness

40:02.340 --> 40:06.740
 as potentially needing some of the same,

40:06.740 --> 40:08.780
 not mystical, but some of the same magic.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.580
 You see, it is a complicated story.

40:10.580 --> 40:11.820
 So, you know, people think,

40:11.820 --> 40:14.180
 oh, I'm drifting away from the point or something.

40:14.180 --> 40:16.700
 But I think it is a complicated story.

40:16.700 --> 40:17.780
 So what I'm trying to say,

40:17.780 --> 40:19.380
 I mean, I try to put it in a nutshell,

40:19.380 --> 40:20.700
 but it's not so easy.

40:20.700 --> 40:24.900
 I'm trying to say that whatever consciousness is,

40:24.900 --> 40:27.220
 it's not a computation.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.260
 Or it's not a physical process

40:29.260 --> 40:33.340
 which can be described by computation.

40:33.340 --> 40:34.860
 But it nevertheless could be,

40:34.860 --> 40:37.940
 so one of the interesting models

40:37.940 --> 40:39.860
 that you've proposed

40:39.860 --> 40:41.980
 is the orchestrated objective reduction.

40:41.980 --> 40:44.660
 Yes, well, you see, that's going from there, you see.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.740
 So I say I have no idea.

40:46.740 --> 40:50.340
 So I wrote this book through my scientific career.

40:50.340 --> 40:52.660
 I thought, you know, when I'm retired,

40:52.660 --> 40:55.700
 I'll have enough time to write a sort of a popularish book

40:56.860 --> 41:01.180
 which I will explain my ideas and puzzles,

41:01.180 --> 41:04.140
 what I like, beautiful things about physics and mathematics,

41:04.140 --> 41:07.460
 and this puzzle about computability

41:07.460 --> 41:09.540
 and consciousness and so on.

41:09.540 --> 41:13.100
 And in the process of writing this book,

41:13.100 --> 41:14.460
 well, I thought I'd do it when I was retired.

41:14.460 --> 41:16.260
 I didn't actually, I didn't wait that long

41:16.260 --> 41:19.380
 because there was a radio discussion

41:19.380 --> 41:24.140
 between Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky.

41:24.140 --> 41:28.180
 And they were talking about what computers could do.

41:28.180 --> 41:30.540
 And they were entering a big room.

41:30.540 --> 41:32.020
 They imagined entering this big room

41:32.020 --> 41:33.780
 where at the other end of the room,

41:33.780 --> 41:36.900
 two computers were talking to each other.

41:36.900 --> 41:39.220
 And as you walk up to the computers,

41:39.220 --> 41:41.700
 they will have communicated to each other

41:41.700 --> 41:46.620
 more ideas, concepts, things than the entire human race

41:46.620 --> 41:47.540
 had ever done.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.620
 So I thought, well, I know where you're coming from,

41:51.620 --> 41:53.620
 but I just don't believe you.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.860
 There's something missing.

41:57.020 --> 41:59.180
 So I thought, well, I should write my book.

42:00.380 --> 42:01.620
 And so I did.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.060
 It was roughly the same time Stephen Hawking

42:04.060 --> 42:07.620
 was writing his brief history of time.

42:07.620 --> 42:11.220
 In the 80s at some point.

42:11.220 --> 42:12.860
 The book you're talking about is The Emperor's New Mind.

42:12.860 --> 42:13.980
 The Emperor's New Mind, that's right.

42:13.980 --> 42:16.140
 And both are incredible books,

42:16.140 --> 42:18.500
 The Brief History of Time and The Emperor's New Mind.

42:18.500 --> 42:19.900
 Yes, it was quite interesting

42:19.900 --> 42:23.460
 because he told me he'd got Carl Sagan, I think,

42:23.460 --> 42:26.580
 to write a foreword for the book, you see.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.220
 So I thought, gosh, what am I gonna do?

42:28.220 --> 42:31.060
 I'm not gonna get anywhere unless I get somebody.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.700
 So I said, oh, I know Martin Gardner,

42:32.700 --> 42:34.380
 so I wonder if he'd do it.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.660
 So he did, and he did a very nice foreword.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.260
 So that's an incredible book,

42:38.260 --> 42:40.420
 and some of the same people you mentioned,

42:40.420 --> 42:44.620
 Ed Franken, which I guess of expert systems fame,

42:44.620 --> 42:46.980
 and Minsky, of course, people know in the AI world,

42:46.980 --> 42:49.820
 but they represent the artificial intelligence world

42:49.820 --> 42:53.740
 that do hope and dream that AI's intelligence is.

42:53.740 --> 42:54.860
 Well, you see, it was my thinking,

42:54.860 --> 42:57.420
 well, you know, I see where they're coming from.

42:57.420 --> 42:59.940
 From that perspective, yeah, you're right.

42:59.940 --> 43:01.620
 But that's not my perspective.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.460
 So I thought I had to say it.

43:03.460 --> 43:05.060
 And as I was writing my book, you see,

43:05.060 --> 43:06.740
 I thought, well, I don't really know anything

43:06.740 --> 43:07.780
 about neurophysiology.

43:07.780 --> 43:09.220
 What am I doing writing this book?

43:09.220 --> 43:12.140
 So I started reading up about neurophysiology,

43:12.140 --> 43:13.100
 and I read up, and I think,

43:13.100 --> 43:14.580
 now, I'm trying to find out how it is

43:14.580 --> 43:16.460
 that nerve signals could possibly

43:16.460 --> 43:18.340
 preserve quantum coherence.

43:18.340 --> 43:20.900
 And all I read is that the electrical signals

43:20.900 --> 43:25.540
 which go along the nerves create effects through the brain.

43:25.540 --> 43:28.260
 There's no chance you can isolate it.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.860
 So I thought, this is hopeless.

43:29.860 --> 43:31.660
 So I come to the end of the book,

43:31.660 --> 43:33.580
 and I more or less give up.

43:33.580 --> 43:36.380
 I just think of something which I didn't believe in.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.420
 Maybe this is a way around it, but no.

43:39.460 --> 43:40.540
 And then, you see, I thought, well,

43:40.540 --> 43:43.380
 maybe this book will at least stimulate young people

43:43.380 --> 43:45.140
 to do science or something.

43:45.140 --> 43:48.420
 And I got all these letters from old, retired people instead.

43:48.420 --> 43:51.180
 These are the only people who had time to read my book.

43:52.260 --> 43:53.100
 So, I mean, but.

43:53.100 --> 43:54.900
 Except for Stuart Hameroff.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.420
 Except for Stuart Hameroff.

43:56.420 --> 43:58.460
 Stuart Hameroff wrote to me, and he said,

43:58.460 --> 44:00.060
 I think you're missing something.

44:01.060 --> 44:03.420
 You don't know about microtubules, do you?

44:03.420 --> 44:04.820
 He didn't put it quite like that.

44:04.820 --> 44:05.940
 But that was more or less it.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.860
 And he said, this is what you really need to consider.

44:08.860 --> 44:10.620
 So I thought, my God, yes.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.980
 That's a much more promising structure.

44:12.980 --> 44:16.340
 So, I mean, fundamentally, you were searching

44:16.340 --> 44:21.340
 for the source of, noncomputable source of consciousness

44:22.100 --> 44:25.060
 within the human brain, in the biology.

44:25.060 --> 44:30.060
 And so, what are, if I may ask, what are microtubules?

44:30.060 --> 44:33.860
 Well, you see, I was ignorant in what I'd read.

44:33.860 --> 44:37.700
 I never came across them in the books I looked at.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.860
 Perhaps I only read rather superficially, which is true.

44:40.860 --> 44:43.100
 But I didn't know about microtubules.

44:43.100 --> 44:45.300
 Stuart, I think one of the things

44:45.300 --> 44:47.060
 that impressed him about them was,

44:47.060 --> 44:51.380
 when you see pictures of mitosis, that's a cell dividing,

44:51.380 --> 44:53.300
 and you see all the chromosomes.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.700
 And the chromosomes, they all get lined up,

44:55.700 --> 44:57.980
 and then they get pulled apart.

44:57.980 --> 45:02.100
 And so, as the cell divides, half the chromosomes go,

45:02.100 --> 45:04.940
 they divide into the two parts,

45:04.940 --> 45:07.460
 and they go two different ways.

45:07.460 --> 45:09.860
 And what is it that's pulling them apart?

45:09.860 --> 45:12.900
 Well, those are these little things called microtubules.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.580
 And so, he started to get interested in them.

45:15.580 --> 45:18.900
 And he formed the view, well, he was,

45:18.900 --> 45:21.100
 his day job or night job or whatever you call it,

45:21.100 --> 45:23.060
 is to put people to sleep,

45:23.060 --> 45:24.700
 except he doesn't like calling it sleep

45:24.700 --> 45:25.820
 because it's different.

45:25.820 --> 45:29.340
 General anesthetics in a reversible way.

45:29.340 --> 45:32.500
 So, you want to make sure that they don't experience

45:32.500 --> 45:36.780
 the pain that would otherwise be something that they feel.

45:36.780 --> 45:40.380
 And consciousness is turned off for a while,

45:40.380 --> 45:41.940
 and it can be turned back on again.

45:41.940 --> 45:44.980
 So, it's crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on.

45:44.980 --> 45:47.460
 And what do you do when you're doing that?

45:47.460 --> 45:49.700
 What do general anesthetic gases do?

45:50.580 --> 45:54.980
 And see, he formed the view that it's the microtubules

45:54.980 --> 45:56.860
 that they affect.

45:56.860 --> 46:01.020
 And the details of why he formed that view is not,

46:01.020 --> 46:02.300
 well, they're clear to me,

46:02.300 --> 46:05.660
 but there's an interesting story he keeps talking about.

46:05.660 --> 46:08.500
 But I found this very exciting

46:08.500 --> 46:11.500
 because I thought these structures,

46:11.500 --> 46:15.420
 these little tubes which inhabit pretty well all cells,

46:15.420 --> 46:16.780
 it's not just neurons,

46:17.980 --> 46:20.580
 apart from red blood cells,

46:20.580 --> 46:23.940
 they inhabit pretty well all the other cells in the body.

46:23.940 --> 46:25.380
 But they're not all the same kind.

46:25.380 --> 46:28.020
 You get different kinds of microtubules.

46:28.020 --> 46:31.780
 And the ones that excited me the most,

46:31.780 --> 46:34.500
 this may still not be totally clear,

46:34.500 --> 46:36.180
 but the ones that excited me most

46:36.180 --> 46:39.300
 were the only ones that I knew about at the time

46:39.300 --> 46:43.260
 because they're very, very symmetrical structures.

46:44.180 --> 46:45.620
 And I had reason to believe

46:45.620 --> 46:48.100
 that these very symmetrical structures

46:48.100 --> 46:52.140
 would be much better at preserving a quantum state,

46:52.140 --> 46:54.700
 quantum coherence, preserving the thing without,

46:55.700 --> 46:58.780
 you just need to preserve certain degrees of freedom

46:58.780 --> 47:01.060
 without them leaking into the environment.

47:01.060 --> 47:03.420
 Once they leak into the environment, you're lost.

47:03.420 --> 47:08.140
 So you've got to preserve these quantum states at a level

47:08.140 --> 47:12.420
 which the state reduction process comes in

47:12.420 --> 47:16.140
 and that's where I think the noncomputability comes in

47:17.380 --> 47:19.700
 and it's the measurement process in quantum mechanics,

47:19.700 --> 47:20.820
 what's going on.

47:20.820 --> 47:23.580
 So something about the measurement process

47:23.580 --> 47:24.420
 and what's going on,

47:24.420 --> 47:27.140
 something about the structure of the microtubules,

47:27.140 --> 47:29.540
 your intuition says maybe there's something here,

47:29.540 --> 47:32.500
 maybe this kind of structure allows

47:32.500 --> 47:35.500
 for the mystery of the quantum mechanics.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.260
 There was a much better chance, yes.

47:37.260 --> 47:40.780
 It just struck me that partly it was the symmetry

47:40.780 --> 47:43.180
 because there is a feature of symmetry

47:43.180 --> 47:46.300
 you can preserve quantum coherence

47:46.300 --> 47:48.140
 much better with symmetrical structures.

47:48.140 --> 47:50.340
 There's a good reason for that.

47:50.340 --> 47:52.540
 And that impressed me a lot.

47:52.540 --> 47:54.700
 I didn't know the difference between the A lattice

47:54.700 --> 47:57.940
 and B lattice at that time, which could be important.

47:57.940 --> 48:00.860
 Now that could even, see, which isn't talked about much.

48:00.860 --> 48:02.620
 But that's some, in some sense, details.

48:02.620 --> 48:04.380
 We've got to take a step back just to say

48:04.380 --> 48:06.140
 in case people are not familiar.

48:06.140 --> 48:11.140
 So this was called the orchestrated objective reduction

48:13.220 --> 48:18.220
 idea or ORCOR, which is a biological philosophy of mind

48:18.220 --> 48:20.740
 that postulates that consciousness originates

48:20.740 --> 48:22.340
 at the quantum level inside neurons.

48:22.340 --> 48:25.340
 So that has to do with your search for where,

48:25.340 --> 48:26.700
 where is it coming from?

48:26.700 --> 48:29.580
 So that's counter to the notion that consciousness

48:29.580 --> 48:33.220
 may arise from the computation performed by the synapses.

48:33.220 --> 48:35.620
 Yes, I think the key point.

48:35.620 --> 48:40.620
 Sometimes people say it's because it's quantum mechanical.

48:40.820 --> 48:42.660
 It's not just that.

48:42.660 --> 48:45.060
 See, it's more outrageous than that.

48:45.060 --> 48:46.300
 You see, this is one reason I think

48:46.300 --> 48:48.340
 we're so far off from it,

48:48.340 --> 48:51.060
 because we don't even know the physics right.

48:51.060 --> 48:53.860
 You see, it's not just quantum mechanics.

48:53.860 --> 48:55.900
 People say, oh, you know, quantum systems

48:55.900 --> 48:57.340
 and biological structures.

48:57.340 --> 49:00.340
 No, will you starting to see that

49:00.340 --> 49:04.700
 some basic biological systems does depend on quantum.

49:05.900 --> 49:07.620
 I mean, look, in the first place,

49:07.620 --> 49:09.860
 all of chemistry is quantum mechanics.

49:09.860 --> 49:13.140
 People got used to that, so they don't count that.

49:13.140 --> 49:16.660
 So he said, let's not count quantum chemistry.

49:16.660 --> 49:19.100
 We sort of got the hang of that, I think.

49:19.100 --> 49:21.340
 But you have quantum effects,

49:21.340 --> 49:25.460
 which are not just chemical, in photosynthesis.

49:25.460 --> 49:27.220
 And this is one of the striking things

49:27.220 --> 49:29.300
 in the last several years,

49:29.300 --> 49:34.220
 that photosynthesis seems to be a basically quantum process,

49:34.220 --> 49:36.860
 which is not simply chemical.

49:36.860 --> 49:41.460
 It's using quantum mechanics in a very basic way.

49:41.460 --> 49:43.100
 So you could start saying, oh, well,

49:43.100 --> 49:45.580
 if photosynthesis is based on quantum mechanics,

49:45.580 --> 49:50.260
 why not behavior of neurons and things like that?

49:50.260 --> 49:52.140
 Maybe there's something

49:52.140 --> 49:55.060
 which is a bit like photosynthesis in that respect.

49:55.060 --> 49:58.140
 But what I'm saying is even more outrageous than that,

49:58.140 --> 50:00.780
 because those things are talking

50:00.780 --> 50:03.700
 about conventional quantum mechanics.

50:03.700 --> 50:07.540
 Now, my argument says that conventional quantum mechanics,

50:07.540 --> 50:09.420
 if you're just following the Schrodinger equation,

50:09.420 --> 50:11.700
 that's still computable.

50:11.700 --> 50:13.900
 So you've got to go beyond that.

50:13.900 --> 50:15.860
 So you've got to go to where

50:17.420 --> 50:21.060
 quantum mechanics goes wrong in a certain sense.

50:21.940 --> 50:23.820
 You have to be a little bit careful about that,

50:23.820 --> 50:26.060
 because the way people do quantum mechanics

50:26.060 --> 50:31.060
 is a sort of mixture of two different processes.

50:32.820 --> 50:35.460
 One of them is the Schrodinger equation,

50:35.460 --> 50:38.820
 which is an equation Schrodinger wrote down,

50:38.820 --> 50:42.580
 and it tells you how the state of a system evolves.

50:42.580 --> 50:44.740
 And it evolves according to this equation,

50:44.740 --> 50:47.300
 completely deterministic,

50:47.300 --> 50:50.300
 but it evolves into ridiculous situations.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.540
 And this was what Schrodinger

50:51.540 --> 50:54.260
 was very much pointing out with his cat.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.820
 He said, you follow my equation,

50:55.820 --> 50:57.380
 that's Schrodinger's equation,

50:57.380 --> 51:01.300
 and you could say that you have to get a cat,

51:01.300 --> 51:04.260
 a cat which is dead and alive at the same time.

51:04.260 --> 51:07.140
 That would be the evolution of the Schrodinger equation,

51:07.140 --> 51:10.380
 would lead to a state, which is the cat being dead

51:10.380 --> 51:12.700
 and alive at the same time.

51:12.700 --> 51:15.700
 And he's more or less saying, this is an absurdity.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.380
 People nowadays say, oh, well, Schrodinger said

51:18.380 --> 51:20.140
 you can have a cat which is dead, that's not that.

51:20.140 --> 51:23.380
 You see, he was saying, this is an absurdity.

51:23.380 --> 51:24.740
 There's something missing.

51:25.620 --> 51:28.620
 And that the reduction of the state

51:28.620 --> 51:31.940
 or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is,

51:31.940 --> 51:34.700
 is something which has to be understood.

51:34.700 --> 51:37.780
 It's not following the Schrodinger equation.

51:37.780 --> 51:41.940
 It's not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanics.

51:41.940 --> 51:43.580
 There's something more than that.

51:44.700 --> 51:48.220
 And it's easy to quote authority here because Einstein,

51:49.820 --> 51:52.540
 at least three of the greatest physicists

51:52.540 --> 51:57.180
 of 20th century who were very fundamental

51:57.180 --> 51:58.780
 in developing quantum mechanics,

51:58.780 --> 52:01.820
 Einstein, one of them, Schrodinger, another,

52:01.820 --> 52:03.580
 Dirac, another.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.500
 You have to look carefully at Dirac's writing

52:05.500 --> 52:09.180
 because he didn't tend to say this out loud too much

52:09.180 --> 52:11.300
 because he was very cautious about what he said.

52:11.300 --> 52:14.220
 You find the right place and you see he says

52:14.220 --> 52:16.620
 quantum mechanics is a provisional theory.

52:18.060 --> 52:21.660
 We need something which explains

52:21.660 --> 52:23.500
 the collapse of the wave function.

52:23.500 --> 52:26.220
 We need to go beyond the theory we have now.

52:27.900 --> 52:29.900
 I happen to be one of the kinds of people,

52:29.900 --> 52:31.860
 there are many, there is a whole group of people,

52:31.860 --> 52:35.580
 they're all considered to be a bit mavericks,

52:35.580 --> 52:38.900
 who believe that quantum mechanics needs to be modified.

52:38.900 --> 52:41.180
 There's a small minority of those people,

52:41.180 --> 52:42.740
 which are already a minority,

52:42.740 --> 52:46.220
 who think that the way in which it's modified

52:46.220 --> 52:47.500
 has to be with gravity.

52:48.700 --> 52:51.420
 And there is an even smaller minority of those people

52:51.420 --> 52:53.580
 who think it's the particular way that I think it is.

52:53.580 --> 52:55.180
 You see.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.860
 So those are the quantum gravity folks.

52:56.860 --> 52:57.700
 But what's...

52:57.700 --> 53:00.740
 You see, quantum gravity is already not this.

53:00.740 --> 53:02.660
 Because when you say quantum gravity,

53:02.660 --> 53:05.460
 what you really mean is quantum mechanics

53:05.460 --> 53:08.020
 applied to gravitational theory.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.660
 So you say, let's take this wonderful formalism

53:10.660 --> 53:15.220
 of quantum mechanics and make gravity fit into it.

53:15.220 --> 53:18.060
 So that is what quantum gravity is meant to be.

53:18.060 --> 53:21.500
 Now I'm saying you've got to be more even handed

53:21.500 --> 53:24.460
 that gravity affects the structure of quantum mechanics too.

53:24.460 --> 53:26.860
 It's not just you quantize gravity,

53:26.860 --> 53:29.460
 you've got to gravitate quantum mechanics.

53:29.460 --> 53:31.140
 And it's a two way thing.

53:31.140 --> 53:32.980
 But then when do you even get started?

53:32.980 --> 53:35.260
 So that you're saying that we have to figure out

53:35.260 --> 53:36.860
 a totally new ideas in there.

53:36.860 --> 53:37.940
 Exactly.

53:37.940 --> 53:39.980
 No, you're stuck.

53:39.980 --> 53:41.260
 You don't have a theory.

53:41.260 --> 53:42.780
 That's the trouble.

53:42.780 --> 53:44.540
 So this is a big problem.

53:44.540 --> 53:46.020
 If you say, okay, well, what's the theory?

53:46.020 --> 53:47.300
 I don't know.

53:47.300 --> 53:49.420
 So maybe in the very early days, sort of...

53:49.420 --> 53:51.020
 It is in the very early days.

53:51.020 --> 53:52.620
 But just making this point.

53:52.620 --> 53:53.780
 Yes.

53:53.780 --> 53:55.780
 You see, Stuart Hammeroff tends to be,

53:55.780 --> 53:58.700
 oh, Penrose says that it's got to be a reduction

53:58.700 --> 54:00.620
 of the state and so on, so let's use it.

54:00.620 --> 54:02.140
 The trouble is Penrose doesn't say that.

54:02.140 --> 54:06.940
 Penrose says, well, I think that we have no experiments

54:06.940 --> 54:10.100
 as yet, which shows that.

54:10.100 --> 54:12.580
 There are experiments which are being thought through

54:12.580 --> 54:15.740
 and which I'm hoping will be performed.

54:15.740 --> 54:18.340
 There is an experiment which is being developed

54:18.340 --> 54:22.060
 by Dirk Baumeister, who I've known for a long time,

54:22.060 --> 54:25.340
 who shares his time between Leiden in the Netherlands

54:25.340 --> 54:27.900
 and Santa Barbara in the US.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.700
 And he's been working on an experiment

54:29.700 --> 54:34.700
 which could perhaps demonstrate that quantum mechanics,

54:35.180 --> 54:37.420
 as we now understand it, if you don't bring in

54:37.420 --> 54:41.720
 the gravitational effects, it has to be modified.

54:42.580 --> 54:45.980
 And then there's also experiments that are underway

54:45.980 --> 54:50.620
 that kind of look at the microtubule side of things

54:50.620 --> 54:52.580
 to see if there's, in the biology,

54:52.580 --> 54:53.820
 you could see something like that.

54:53.820 --> 54:55.060
 Could you briefly mention it?

54:55.060 --> 54:58.140
 Because that's really sort of one of the only

54:58.140 --> 55:00.860
 experimental attempts in the very early days

55:00.860 --> 55:02.740
 of even thinking about consciousness.

55:02.740 --> 55:05.420
 I think there's a very serious area here,

55:05.420 --> 55:07.300
 which is what Stuart Hammeroff is doing,

55:07.300 --> 55:09.020
 and I think it's very important.

55:09.020 --> 55:11.740
 One of the few places that you can really get

55:11.740 --> 55:14.780
 a bit of a handle on what consciousness is

55:14.780 --> 55:17.040
 is what turns it off.

55:17.040 --> 55:20.020
 And when you're thinking about general anesthetics,

55:20.020 --> 55:21.660
 it's very specific.

55:21.660 --> 55:24.220
 These things turn consciousness off.

55:24.220 --> 55:26.300
 What the hell do they do?

55:26.300 --> 55:29.900
 Well, Stuart and a number of people who work with him

55:29.900 --> 55:34.420
 and others happen to believe that the general anesthetics

55:34.420 --> 55:36.720
 directly affect microtubules.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.660
 And there is some evidence for this.

55:38.660 --> 55:40.180
 I don't know how strong it is

55:40.180 --> 55:43.800
 and how watertight the case is,

55:43.800 --> 55:46.740
 but I think there is some evidence pointing

55:46.740 --> 55:49.140
 in that kind of direction.

55:49.140 --> 55:51.180
 It's not just an ordinary chemical process.

55:51.180 --> 55:53.500
 There's something quite different about it.

55:53.500 --> 55:56.900
 And one of the main candidates

55:56.900 --> 55:59.260
 is that these anesthetic gases

55:59.260 --> 56:01.660
 do affect directly microtubules.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.460
 And how strong that evidence is,

56:04.460 --> 56:07.100
 I wouldn't be in a position to say,

56:07.100 --> 56:10.060
 but I think there is fairly impressive evidence.

56:10.060 --> 56:12.700
 And the point is the experiments are being undertaken,

56:12.700 --> 56:13.540
 which is. Yeah.

56:13.540 --> 56:14.660
 I mean, that is experimental.

56:14.660 --> 56:17.260
 You see, so it's a very clear direction

56:17.260 --> 56:18.720
 where you can think of experiments

56:18.720 --> 56:21.800
 which could indicate whether or not

56:21.800 --> 56:24.980
 it's really microtubules which the anesthetic gases

56:24.980 --> 56:26.100
 directly affect.

56:26.100 --> 56:27.300
 That's really exciting.

56:27.300 --> 56:30.380
 One of the sad things is as far as I'm,

56:30.380 --> 56:31.820
 from my outside perspective,

56:31.820 --> 56:34.420
 is not many people are working on this.

56:34.420 --> 56:37.220
 So there's a very, like with Stuart,

56:37.220 --> 56:38.940
 it feels like there's very few people

56:38.940 --> 56:41.280
 are carrying the flag forward on this.

56:41.280 --> 56:44.860
 I think it's not many in the sense it's a minority,

56:44.860 --> 56:46.420
 but it's not zero anymore.

56:46.420 --> 56:49.840
 You see, when Stuart and I were originally taught by us,

56:49.840 --> 56:52.860
 we were just us and a few of our friends,

56:52.860 --> 56:54.220
 there weren't many people taking it,

56:54.220 --> 56:59.220
 but it's grown into one of the main viewpoints.

56:59.500 --> 57:02.540
 There might be about four or five or six different

57:03.540 --> 57:06.260
 views which people hold,

57:06.260 --> 57:07.660
 and it's one of them.

57:07.660 --> 57:11.100
 So it's considered as one of the possible

57:12.060 --> 57:13.340
 lines of thinking, yes.

57:13.340 --> 57:15.100
 You describe physics theories

57:15.100 --> 57:16.940
 as falling into one of three categories,

57:16.940 --> 57:19.860
 the superb, the useful, or the tentative.

57:19.860 --> 57:21.700
 I like those words.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.580
 It's a beautiful categorization.

57:23.580 --> 57:26.980
 Do you think we'll ever have a superb theory

57:26.980 --> 57:29.800
 of intelligence and of consciousness?

57:29.800 --> 57:30.640
 We might.

57:31.700 --> 57:33.740
 We're a long way from it.

57:33.740 --> 57:35.020
 I don't think we're even,

57:35.020 --> 57:36.940
 whether we're in the tentative scale.

57:36.940 --> 57:37.980
 I mean, it's...

57:40.020 --> 57:42.420
 You don't think we've even entered the realm of tentative?

57:42.420 --> 57:43.260
 Probably not.

57:43.260 --> 57:44.580
 Yeah, that's right.

57:44.580 --> 57:47.140
 Now, when you see this, it's so controversial.

57:47.140 --> 57:49.180
 We don't have a clear view

57:49.180 --> 57:53.100
 which is accepted by a majority.

57:53.100 --> 57:54.340
 I mean, you see, yeah, people,

57:54.340 --> 57:57.300
 most views are computational in one form or another.

57:57.300 --> 57:59.260
 They think it's some, but it's not very clear,

57:59.260 --> 58:03.460
 because even the IIT people who

58:04.700 --> 58:06.540
 think of them as computational,

58:06.540 --> 58:08.020
 but I've heard them say,

58:08.020 --> 58:09.980
 no, consciousness is supposed to be not computational.

58:09.980 --> 58:10.980
 I say, well, if it's not computational,

58:10.980 --> 58:12.140
 what in the hell is it?

58:12.140 --> 58:14.100
 What's going on?

58:14.100 --> 58:17.120
 What physical processes are going on which are that?

58:18.900 --> 58:21.700
 What does it mean for something to be computational then?

58:21.700 --> 58:23.900
 So, is...

58:25.100 --> 58:27.740
 Well, there has to be a process which is...

58:29.380 --> 58:30.500
 You see, it's very curious

58:30.500 --> 58:34.140
 the way the history has developed in quantum mechanics,

58:34.140 --> 58:35.460
 because very early on,

58:35.460 --> 58:37.780
 people thought there was something to do with consciousness,

58:37.780 --> 58:39.980
 but it was almost the other way around.

58:39.980 --> 58:42.980
 You see, you have to say the Schrodinger equation

58:42.980 --> 58:46.020
 says all these different alternatives happen all at once,

58:46.020 --> 58:48.540
 and then when is it that only one of them happens?

58:48.540 --> 58:50.820
 Well, one of the views, which was quite commonly held

58:50.820 --> 58:53.460
 by a few distinguished quantum physicists,

58:53.460 --> 58:56.620
 that's when a conscious being looks at the system

58:56.620 --> 58:57.940
 or becomes aware of it,

58:57.940 --> 59:00.700
 and at that point, it becomes one or the other.

59:01.740 --> 59:03.700
 That's a role where consciousness

59:03.700 --> 59:07.020
 is somehow actively reducing the state.

59:07.020 --> 59:10.140
 My view is almost the exact opposite of that.

59:10.140 --> 59:14.180
 It's the state reduces itself in some way which...

59:14.180 --> 59:17.100
 Some noncomputational way which we don't understand,

59:17.100 --> 59:19.180
 we don't have a proper theory of,

59:19.180 --> 59:24.180
 and that is the building block of what consciousness is.

59:24.420 --> 59:26.220
 So consciousness is the other way around.

59:26.220 --> 59:31.220
 It depends on that choice which nature makes all the time

59:31.220 --> 59:33.100
 when the state becomes one or the other

59:33.100 --> 59:36.020
 rather than the superposition of one and the other,

59:36.020 --> 59:39.540
 and when that happens, there is what we're saying now,

59:39.540 --> 59:43.100
 an element of proto consciousness takes place.

59:43.100 --> 59:45.620
 Proto consciousness is, roughly speaking,

59:45.620 --> 59:47.380
 the building block out of which

59:47.380 --> 59:50.060
 actual consciousness is constructed.

59:50.060 --> 59:53.180
 So you have these proto conscious elements,

59:53.180 --> 59:55.020
 which are when the state decides

59:55.020 --> 59:57.540
 to do one thing or the other,

59:57.540 --> 1:00:01.540
 and that's the thing which when organized together,

1:00:01.540 --> 1:00:05.420
 that's the OR part in ORCOR, but the ORC part,

1:00:05.420 --> 1:00:08.580
 that's the OR part at least one can see

1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:10.260
 where we're driving at a theory.

1:00:10.260 --> 1:00:13.140
 You can say it's the quantum choice

1:00:13.140 --> 1:00:14.700
 of going this way or that way,

1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:17.700
 but the ORC part, which is the orchestration of this,

1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:19.580
 is much more mysterious,

1:00:19.580 --> 1:00:23.260
 and how does the brain somehow orchestrate

1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:26.580
 all these individual OR processes

1:00:26.580 --> 1:00:31.580
 into a genuine, genuine conscious experience?

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:35.100
 And it might be something that's beautifully simple,

1:00:35.100 --> 1:00:37.780
 but we're completely in the dark about.

1:00:37.780 --> 1:00:40.220
 Yeah, I think at the moment, that's the thing,

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.940
 you know, we happily put the word ORC down there

1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:47.500
 to say orchestrated, but that's even more unclear

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.020
 what that really means.

1:00:49.020 --> 1:00:54.020
 Just like the word material, orchestrated, who knows?

1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:56.220
 And we've been dancing a little bit

1:00:56.220 --> 1:00:58.780
 between the word intelligence

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.980
 or understanding and consciousness.

1:01:00.980 --> 1:01:03.060
 Do you kind of see those as sitting

1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:05.820
 in the same space of mystery as we discussed?

1:01:05.820 --> 1:01:07.820
 Yes, well, you see, I tend to say

1:01:07.820 --> 1:01:12.820
 you have understanding and intelligence and awareness,

1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:19.100
 and somehow understanding is in the middle of it, you see.

1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:25.660
 I like to say, could you say of an entity

1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:27.860
 that is actually intelligent

1:01:27.860 --> 1:01:30.380
 if it doesn't have the quality of understanding?

1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:33.740
 Now, you see, I'm using terms I don't even know how to define,

1:01:33.740 --> 1:01:34.580
 but who cares?

1:01:34.580 --> 1:01:35.420
 I'm just relating them.

1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:38.500
 They're somewhat poetic, so if I somehow understand them.

1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:40.900
 Yes, that's right, we don't, exactly.

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:42.300
 But they're not mathematical in nature.

1:01:42.300 --> 1:01:44.100
 Yes, you see, as a mathematician,

1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:45.420
 I don't know how to define any of them,

1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:47.460
 but at least I can point to the connections.

1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:50.260
 So the idea is intelligence is something

1:01:50.260 --> 1:01:53.980
 which I believe needs understanding,

1:01:53.980 --> 1:01:56.420
 otherwise you wouldn't say it's really intelligence.

1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:59.460
 And understanding needs awareness,

1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:02.020
 otherwise you wouldn't really say it's understanding.

1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:04.420
 Do you say of an entity that understands something,

1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:08.420
 unless it's really aware of it, you know, normal usage.

1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:10.940
 So there's a three sort of awareness,

1:02:10.940 --> 1:02:13.780
 understanding, and intelligence.

1:02:13.780 --> 1:02:17.500
 And I just tend to concentrate on understanding

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.220
 because that's where I can say something.

1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:20.060
 Okay.

1:02:20.060 --> 1:02:21.940
 And that's the Gödel theorem, things like that.

1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:24.900
 But what does it mean to be,

1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:26.900
 perceive the color blue or something?

1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:28.460
 I mean, I'm foggiest.

1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:31.020
 It's a much more difficult question.

1:02:31.020 --> 1:02:34.020
 I mean, is it the same if I see a color blue and you see it?

1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:36.540
 If you're somebody with this condition,

1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:38.260
 what's it called then?

1:02:38.260 --> 1:02:41.500
 Or where you assign a sound to a color.

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:42.340
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:44.700
 You get colors and sounds mixed up.

1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:45.820
 And that sort of thing.

1:02:45.820 --> 1:02:47.740
 I mean, an interesting subject.

1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:50.820
 But from the physics perspective,

1:02:50.820 --> 1:02:53.180
 from the fundamentals perspective, we don't.

1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:56.260
 I think we're way off having much understanding

1:02:56.260 --> 1:02:57.860
 what's going on there.

1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:01.300
 In your 2010 book, Cycles of Time,

1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:04.300
 you suggest that another universe may have existed

1:03:04.300 --> 1:03:06.220
 before the Big Bang.

1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.740
 Can you describe this idea?

1:03:08.740 --> 1:03:10.900
 First of all, what is the Big Bang?

1:03:10.900 --> 1:03:13.020
 Sounds like a funny word.

1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:17.060
 And what may have been there before it?

1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:17.900
 Yes.

1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:19.300
 Just as a matter of terminology,

1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:21.740
 I don't like to call it another universe.

1:03:21.740 --> 1:03:23.020
 Because when you have another universe,

1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:25.500
 you think of it kind of quite separate from us.

1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:28.660
 But these things, they're not separate.

1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:31.820
 Now the Big Bang, conventional theory.

1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:34.180
 You see, I was actually brought up

1:03:34.180 --> 1:03:35.900
 in the sense of when I started getting

1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:36.860
 interested in cosmology,

1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:39.220
 there was a thing called the Steady State Model,

1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:41.340
 which was sort of philosophically very interesting.

1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:43.020
 And there wasn't a Big Bang in that theory.

1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:46.980
 But somehow, new material was created all the time

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.060
 in the form of hydrogen,

1:03:48.060 --> 1:03:50.500
 and the universe kept on expanding, expanding, expanding,

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:52.540
 and there was room for more hydrogen.

1:03:52.540 --> 1:03:54.940
 It was a rather philosophically nice picture.

1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:59.940
 It was disproved when the Big Bang,

1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:01.820
 well, when I say the Big Bang,

1:04:01.820 --> 1:04:04.900
 this was theoretically discovered

1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:07.860
 by people trying to solve Einstein's equations

1:04:07.860 --> 1:04:09.340
 and apply it to cosmology.

1:04:09.340 --> 1:04:10.700
 Einstein didn't like the idea.

1:04:10.700 --> 1:04:14.340
 He liked a universe which was there all the time.

1:04:14.340 --> 1:04:16.740
 And he had a model which was there all the time.

1:04:16.740 --> 1:04:19.540
 But then there was this discovery,

1:04:19.540 --> 1:04:22.340
 accidental discovery, very important discovery,

1:04:22.340 --> 1:04:25.140
 of this microwave background.

1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:28.460
 And if you, there's the crackle on your television screen

1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:32.740
 which is already sensing this microwave background,

1:04:32.740 --> 1:04:35.140
 which is coming at us from all directions.

1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:37.740
 And you can trace it back and back and back and back.

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:40.820
 And it came from a very early stage of the universe.

1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.700
 Well, it's part of the Big Bang theory.

1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:45.660
 The Big Bang theory was when people tried

1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:47.660
 to solve Einstein's equations.

1:04:47.660 --> 1:04:50.780
 They really found you had to have this initial state

1:04:50.780 --> 1:04:52.420
 where the universe, it used to be called

1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:55.340
 the primordial atom and things like this.

1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:57.860
 There's Friedman and Lemaitre.

1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:01.420
 Friedman was a Russian, Lemaitre was a Belgian.

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:04.780
 And they independently, well, basically Friedman first.

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:08.860
 And Lemaitre talked about the initial state,

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:11.420
 which is a very, very concentrated initial state

1:05:11.420 --> 1:05:13.500
 which seemed to be the origin of the universe.

1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:14.820
 Primordial atom.

1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:17.620
 Primordial atom is what he called it, yes.

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:20.220
 And then it became, well, Fred Hoyle used the term

1:05:20.220 --> 1:05:22.540
 Big Bang in a kind of derogatory sense.

1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:25.140
 Just like with the Schrodinger and the cats, right?

1:05:25.140 --> 1:05:28.340
 Yes, it's like sort of got picked up on

1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:30.780
 whereas it wasn't his intention originally.

1:05:30.780 --> 1:05:33.620
 But then the evidence piled up and piled up.

1:05:33.620 --> 1:05:36.460
 And one of my friends and I learned a lot from him

1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:38.060
 when I was in Cambridge was Dennis Sharma.

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:40.580
 He was a great proponent of steady state.

1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:41.980
 And then he got converted.

1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:43.420
 He said, no, I'm sorry.

1:05:43.420 --> 1:05:44.500
 I had a great respect for him.

1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:46.780
 He went around lecturing and said, I was wrong.

1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:48.900
 The steady state model doesn't work.

1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:50.900
 There was this Big Bang.

1:05:50.900 --> 1:05:53.620
 And this microwave background that you see,

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:55.380
 okay, it's not actually quite the Big Bang.

1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:58.660
 When I say not quite, it's about 380,000 years

1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:01.460
 after the Big Bang, but that's what you see.

1:06:01.460 --> 1:06:03.780
 But then you have to have had this Big Bang before it

1:06:03.780 --> 1:06:05.740
 in order to make the equations work.

1:06:05.740 --> 1:06:09.660
 And it works beautifully except for one little thing,

1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:11.060
 which is this thing called inflation,

1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:14.060
 which people had to put into it to make it work.

1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:16.860
 When I first heard of it, I didn't like it at all.

1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:17.940
 What's inflation?

1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:20.380
 Inflation is that in the first,

1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:22.740
 I'm gonna give you a very tiny number.

1:06:22.740 --> 1:06:23.940
 Think of a second.

1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:25.180
 That's not very long.

1:06:25.180 --> 1:06:26.980
 Now I'm gonna give you a fraction of a second,

1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:29.460
 one over a number.

1:06:29.460 --> 1:06:34.340
 This number has 32 digits between,

1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:37.740
 well, let's say between 36 and 32 digits.

1:06:37.740 --> 1:06:41.260
 Tiny, tiny time between those two tiny,

1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:44.500
 ridiculous seconds, fraction of a second,

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.580
 the universe was supposed to have expanded

1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:49.700
 in this exponential way, an enormous way.

1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:52.060
 For no apparent reason, you had to invent

1:06:52.060 --> 1:06:54.700
 a particular thing called the inflaton field

1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:56.060
 to make it do it.

1:06:56.060 --> 1:06:58.180
 And I thought this is completely crazy.

1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:01.980
 There are reasons why people stuck with this idea.

1:07:01.980 --> 1:07:04.180
 You see, the thing is that I formed my model

1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:07.700
 for reasons which are very fundamental, if you like.

1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:10.420
 It has to do with this very fundamental principle,

1:07:10.420 --> 1:07:13.780
 which is known as the second law of thermodynamics.

1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:16.100
 The second law of thermodynamics says more or less,

1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:18.700
 things get more and more random as time goes on.

1:07:20.020 --> 1:07:22.100
 Now, another way of saying exactly the same thing

1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:24.340
 is things get less and less random.

1:07:24.340 --> 1:07:26.380
 As things go back, as you go back in time,

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:28.060
 they get less and less random.

1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:30.100
 They go back and back and back and back.

1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:32.020
 And the earliest thing you can directly see

1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:33.540
 is this microwave background.

1:07:34.580 --> 1:07:37.540
 What's one of the most striking features of it

1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:39.220
 is that it's random.

1:07:39.220 --> 1:07:42.500
 It has this, what you call this spectrum of,

1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:46.060
 which is what's called the Planck spectrum,

1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:48.740
 of frequencies, different intensities

1:07:48.740 --> 1:07:49.660
 for different frequencies.

1:07:49.660 --> 1:07:53.340
 And it's this wonderful curve due to Max Planck.

1:07:53.340 --> 1:07:54.700
 And what's it telling you?

1:07:54.700 --> 1:07:58.020
 It's telling you that the entropy is at a maximum.

1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:02.140
 Started off at a maximum and it's going up ever since.

1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:03.900
 I call that the mammoth in the room.

1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:05.580
 I mean, it's a paradox.

1:08:05.580 --> 1:08:07.220
 A mammoth, yeah, it is.

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:10.500
 And so people, why don't cosmologists worry about this?

1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:11.940
 So I worried about it.

1:08:11.940 --> 1:08:14.940
 And then I thought, well, it's not really a paradox

1:08:14.940 --> 1:08:19.060
 because you're looking at matter and radiation

1:08:19.060 --> 1:08:20.700
 at a maximum entropy state.

1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:25.420
 What you're not seeing directly in that is the gravitation.

1:08:25.420 --> 1:08:28.460
 It's gravitation, which is not thermalized.

1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:32.020
 The gravitation was very, very low entropy.

1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:34.500
 And it's low entropy by the uniformity.

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:35.980
 And you see that in the microwave too.

1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:38.260
 It's very uniform over the whole sky.

1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:39.500
 I'm compressing a long story

1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:40.820
 into a very short few sentences.

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:42.060
 And doing a great job, yeah.

1:08:42.060 --> 1:08:45.780
 So what I'm saying is that there's a huge puzzle.

1:08:45.780 --> 1:08:50.700
 Why was gravity in this very low entropy state,

1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:55.260
 very highly organized state, everything else was all random?

1:08:55.260 --> 1:08:59.060
 And that to me was the biggest problem in cosmology.

1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:02.860
 The biggest problem, nobody seems to even worry about it.

1:09:02.860 --> 1:09:04.540
 People say they solved all the problems

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:05.620
 and they don't even worry about it.

1:09:05.620 --> 1:09:07.420
 They think inflation solves it.

1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:08.860
 It doesn't, it can't.

1:09:08.860 --> 1:09:12.260
 Because it's just that...

1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:14.660
 Just to clarify, that was your problem

1:09:14.660 --> 1:09:18.140
 with the inflation describing some aspect

1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:20.540
 of the moments right after the Big Bang?

1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:22.220
 Inflation is supposed to stretch it out

1:09:22.220 --> 1:09:23.940
 and make it all uniform, you see.

1:09:23.940 --> 1:09:25.420
 It doesn't do it because it can only do it

1:09:25.420 --> 1:09:27.180
 if it's uniform already at the beginning.

1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:28.540
 It's, you just have to look at,

1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:31.700
 I can't go into the details, but it doesn't solve it.

1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:33.820
 And it was completely clear to me it doesn't solve it.

1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:36.340
 But where does the conformal cyclic cosmology

1:09:36.340 --> 1:09:40.260
 of starting to talk about something before

1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:41.820
 that singular and the Big Bang?

1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:44.220
 I was just thinking to myself,

1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:47.660
 how boring this universe is going to be.

1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:49.500
 You've got this exponential expansion.

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:51.460
 This was discovered early in the,

1:09:51.460 --> 1:09:56.460
 in this century, 21st century.

1:09:56.740 --> 1:10:01.060
 People discovered that these supernova exploding stars

1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:04.580
 showed that the universe is actually undergoing

1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.580
 this exponential expansion.

1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:09.540
 So it's a self similar expansion.

1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:14.260
 And it seems to be a feature of this term

1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:17.140
 that Einstein introduced into his cosmology

1:10:17.140 --> 1:10:18.540
 for the wrong reason.

1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:20.580
 He wanted a universe that was static.

1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:23.500
 He put this new term into his cosmology.

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:24.420
 To make it make sense,

1:10:24.420 --> 1:10:26.460
 it's called the cosmological constant.

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:28.260
 And then when he got convinced

1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:29.540
 that the universe had a Big Bang,

1:10:29.540 --> 1:10:33.300
 he retracted it complaining this was his greatest blunder.

1:10:33.300 --> 1:10:34.660
 The trouble is it wasn't a blunder.

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:37.900
 It was actually right, very ironic.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:40.260
 And so the universe seems to be behaving

1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:41.980
 with this cosmological constant.

1:10:41.980 --> 1:10:45.100
 Okay, so this universe is expanding and expanding.

1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:46.340
 What's going to happen in the future?

1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:48.860
 Well, it gets more and more boring for a while.

1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:50.580
 What's the most interesting thing in the universe?

1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:51.860
 Well, there's black holes.

1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:53.660
 The black holes more or less gulp down

1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:56.660
 entire clusters of galaxies.

1:10:56.660 --> 1:10:59.100
 The cluster, it'll swallow up most of our galaxy.

1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:01.460
 We will run into our Andromeda galaxy's black hole.

1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:03.660
 That black hole will swallow our one.

1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:04.700
 They'll get bigger and bigger

1:11:04.700 --> 1:11:07.100
 and they'll basically swallow up

1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:10.060
 the whole cluster of galaxies, gulp it all down.

1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:13.780
 Pretty well all, most of it, maybe not all, most of it.

1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:15.300
 Okay, then that'll happen to,

1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:16.820
 there'll be just these black holes around.

1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:19.620
 Pretty boring, but still not as boring as it's gonna get.

1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:21.660
 It's gonna get more boring because these black holes,

1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:24.060
 you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait

1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:26.140
 an unbelievable length of time

1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:30.300
 and Hawking's black hole evaporation starts to come in.

1:11:30.300 --> 1:11:34.340
 And the black holes, you just, it's incredibly tedious.

1:11:34.340 --> 1:11:36.340
 Finally evaporate away.

1:11:36.340 --> 1:11:39.700
 Each one goes away, disappears with a pop at the end.

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:40.940
 What could be more boring?

1:11:40.940 --> 1:11:43.820
 It was boring then, now this is really boring.

1:11:43.820 --> 1:11:46.620
 There's nothing, not even black holes.

1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:48.940
 Universe gets colder and colder and colder and colder.

1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:52.460
 And I thought, this is very, very boring.

1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:54.540
 Now that's not science, is it?

1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:56.420
 But it's emotional.

1:11:56.420 --> 1:11:59.620
 So I thought, who's gonna be bored by this universe?

1:11:59.620 --> 1:12:01.540
 Not us, we won't be around.

1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:04.100
 It'll be mostly photons running around.

1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:06.180
 And what the photons do, they don't get bored

1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:08.780
 because it's part of relativity, you see.

1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:10.900
 It's not really that they don't experience anything.

1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:12.420
 That's not the point.

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:15.820
 Photons get right out to infinity

1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:18.580
 without experience any time.

1:12:18.580 --> 1:12:21.020
 It's the way relativity works.

1:12:21.020 --> 1:12:23.500
 And this was part of what I used to do in my old days

1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:25.260
 when I was looking at gravitational radiation

1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:27.500
 and how things behaved to infinity.

1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:30.060
 Infinity is just like another place.

1:12:30.060 --> 1:12:31.900
 You can squash it down.

1:12:31.900 --> 1:12:34.460
 As long as you don't have any mass in the world,

1:12:34.460 --> 1:12:36.460
 infinity is just another place.

1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:39.700
 The photons get there, the gravitons get there.

1:12:39.700 --> 1:12:40.540
 What do they get?

1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:42.100
 They've run into infinity.

1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:44.300
 They say, well, now I'm here, what do I?

1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:46.660
 There's something on the other side, is there?

1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:48.620
 The usual view, it's just a mathematical notion.

1:12:48.620 --> 1:12:49.620
 There's nothing on the other side.

1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:51.740
 That's just the boundary of it.

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:54.980
 A nice example is this beautiful series of pictures

1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:57.180
 by the Dutch artist MC Escher.

1:12:57.180 --> 1:12:58.020
 You may know them.

1:12:58.020 --> 1:12:59.660
 The one's called Circle Limits.

1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:02.500
 They're a very famous one with the angels and the devils.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.220
 And you can see them crowding and crowding

1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:06.020
 and crowding up to the edge.

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:09.060
 Now, the kind of geometry that these angels and devils

1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:11.500
 inhabit, that's their infinity.

1:13:12.380 --> 1:13:16.820
 But from our perspective, infinity is just a place.

1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:17.660
 Okay, there is...

1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:20.220
 I'm sorry, can you just take a brief pause?

1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:21.060
 Yes.

1:13:21.060 --> 1:13:22.860
 In just the words you're saying,

1:13:22.860 --> 1:13:24.100
 infinity is just a place.

1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:28.820
 So for the most part, infinity, sort of even just going back,

1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:31.220
 infinity is a mathematical concept.

1:13:31.220 --> 1:13:32.060
 I think this is one of the things...

1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:35.500
 You think there's an actual physical manifest...

1:13:35.500 --> 1:13:38.420
 In which way does infinity ever manifest itself

1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:40.140
 in our physical universe?

1:13:40.140 --> 1:13:41.820
 Well, it does in various places.

1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:44.500
 You see, it's a thing that if you're not a mathematician,

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.500
 you think, oh, infinity, I can't think about that.

1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:48.700
 Mathematicians think about affinity all the time.

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:50.940
 They get used to the idea and they just play around

1:13:50.940 --> 1:13:52.340
 with different kinds of infinities

1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:54.220
 and it becomes no problem.

1:13:54.220 --> 1:13:57.260
 But you just have to take my word for it.

1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.500
 Now, one of the things is,

1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:00.820
 you see, you take a Euclidean geometry.

1:14:00.820 --> 1:14:04.660
 Well, it just keeps on going and it goes out to infinity.

1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:06.180
 Now, there's other kinds of geometry

1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:09.260
 and this is what's called hyperbolic geometry.

1:14:09.260 --> 1:14:10.820
 It's a bit like Euclidean geometry,

1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:12.140
 it's a little bit different.

1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:14.660
 It's like what Escher was trying to describe

1:14:14.660 --> 1:14:17.260
 in his angels and devils.

1:14:17.260 --> 1:14:19.700
 And he learned about this from Coxeter

1:14:19.700 --> 1:14:21.780
 and he think that's a very nice thing.

1:14:21.780 --> 1:14:24.060
 That's why I represent this infinity

1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:25.820
 to this kind of geometry.

1:14:25.820 --> 1:14:27.140
 So it's not quite Euclidean geometry,

1:14:27.140 --> 1:14:28.300
 it's a bit like it,

1:14:28.300 --> 1:14:30.900
 that the angels and the devils inhabit.

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:34.180
 And their infinity, by this nice transformation,

1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:36.820
 you squash their infinity down

1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:39.580
 so you can draw it as this nice circle boundary

1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:42.220
 to their universe.

1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:44.260
 Now, from our outside perspective,

1:14:44.260 --> 1:14:47.420
 we can see their infinity as this boundary.

1:14:47.420 --> 1:14:50.540
 Now, what I'm saying is that it's very like that.

1:14:50.540 --> 1:14:53.540
 The infinity that we might experience

1:14:53.540 --> 1:14:56.180
 like those angels and devils in their world

1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:59.460
 can be thought of as a boundary.

1:14:59.460 --> 1:15:01.940
 Now, I found this a very useful way

1:15:01.940 --> 1:15:03.940
 of talking about radiation,

1:15:03.940 --> 1:15:07.100
 gravitational radiation and things like that.

1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:10.020
 It was a trick, mathematical trick.

1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:11.340
 So now what I'm saying is that

1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:14.940
 that mathematical trick becomes real.

1:15:14.940 --> 1:15:17.860
 That somehow, the photons,

1:15:17.860 --> 1:15:19.980
 they need to go somewhere

1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:22.780
 because from their perspective,

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:25.060
 infinity is just another place.

1:15:25.060 --> 1:15:28.340
 Now, this is a difficult idea to get your mind around.

1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:31.660
 So that's one of the reasons cosmologists

1:15:31.660 --> 1:15:34.820
 are finding a lot of trouble taking me seriously.

1:15:34.820 --> 1:15:37.540
 But to me, it's not such a wild idea.

1:15:37.540 --> 1:15:39.780
 What's on the other side of that infinity?

1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:43.060
 You have to think, why am I allowed to think of this?

1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:45.340
 Why am I allowed to think of this?

1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:48.940
 Because photons don't have any mass.

1:15:48.940 --> 1:15:53.620
 And we in physics have beautiful ways of measuring time.

1:15:53.620 --> 1:15:55.940
 There are incredibly precise clocks,

1:15:55.940 --> 1:15:59.620
 atomic and nuclear clocks, unbelievably precise.

1:15:59.620 --> 1:16:01.660
 Why are they so precise?

1:16:01.660 --> 1:16:04.660
 Because of the two most famous equations

1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:06.820
 of 20th century physics.

1:16:06.820 --> 1:16:10.060
 One of them is Einstein's E equals MC squared.

1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:11.100
 What's that tell us?

1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.980
 Energy and mass are equivalent.

1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:16.660
 The other one is even older than that,

1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:18.540
 still 20th century, only just.

1:16:18.540 --> 1:16:22.660
 Max Planck, E equals h nu.

1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:24.420
 Nu is a frequency,

1:16:24.420 --> 1:16:26.460
 h is a constant, again, like C.

1:16:26.460 --> 1:16:28.020
 E is energy.

1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:30.660
 Energy and frequency are equivalent.

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:33.060
 Put the two together,

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:34.980
 energy and mass are equivalent, Einstein.

1:16:34.980 --> 1:16:37.340
 Energy and frequency are equivalent, Max Planck.

1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:41.420
 Put the two together, mass and frequency are equivalent.

1:16:41.420 --> 1:16:44.100
 Absolutely basic physical principle.

1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:47.500
 If you have a massive entity, a massive particle,

1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:51.980
 it is a clock with a very, very precise frequency.

1:16:53.460 --> 1:16:55.020
 It's not, you can't directly use it,

1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:56.140
 you have to scale it down.

1:16:56.140 --> 1:16:57.660
 So your atomic and nuclear clocks,

1:16:57.660 --> 1:16:59.180
 but that's the basic principle.

1:16:59.180 --> 1:17:02.260
 You scale it down to something you can actually perceive.

1:17:02.260 --> 1:17:03.860
 But it's the same principle.

1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:07.900
 If you have mass, you have beautiful clocks.

1:17:07.900 --> 1:17:10.340
 But the other side of that coin is,

1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:13.940
 if you don't have mass, you don't have clocks.

1:17:14.820 --> 1:17:18.060
 If you don't have clocks, you don't have rulers.

1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:20.180
 You don't have scale.

1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:21.380
 So you don't have space and time.

1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:24.820
 You don't have a measure of the scale of space and time.

1:17:24.820 --> 1:17:26.500
 Oh, scale of space and time.

1:17:26.500 --> 1:17:29.180
 You do have the structure,

1:17:29.180 --> 1:17:30.860
 what's called the conformal structure.

1:17:30.860 --> 1:17:33.100
 You see, it's what the angels and devils have.

1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:35.060
 If you look at the eye of the devil,

1:17:35.060 --> 1:17:36.900
 no matter how close to the boundary it is,

1:17:36.900 --> 1:17:40.820
 it has the same shape, but it has a different size.

1:17:40.820 --> 1:17:43.380
 So you can scale up and you can scale down,

1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:45.340
 but you mustn't change the shape.

1:17:46.420 --> 1:17:48.540
 So it's basically the same idea,

1:17:48.540 --> 1:17:50.780
 but applied to space time now.

1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:52.620
 In the very remote future,

1:17:52.620 --> 1:17:55.700
 you have things which don't measure the scale,

1:17:55.700 --> 1:17:58.460
 but the shape, if you like, is still there.

1:17:58.460 --> 1:17:59.940
 Now that's in the remote future.

1:17:59.940 --> 1:18:01.980
 Now I'm gonna do the exact opposite.

1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:04.660
 Now I'm gonna go way back into the Big Bang.

1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:08.100
 Now as you get there, things get hotter and hotter,

1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:09.420
 denser and denser.

1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:13.020
 What's the universe dominated by?

1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:16.580
 Particles moving around almost with the speed of light.

1:18:16.580 --> 1:18:19.060
 When they get almost with the speed of light,

1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:21.820
 okay, they begin to lose the mass too.

1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:24.260
 So for completely opposite reason,

1:18:24.260 --> 1:18:26.900
 they lose the sense of scale as well.

1:18:26.900 --> 1:18:31.900
 So my crazy idea is the Big Bang and the remote future,

1:18:32.260 --> 1:18:33.500
 they seem completely different.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:36.140
 One is extremely dense, extremely hot.

1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:39.820
 The other is very, very rarefied and very, very cold.

1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:42.860
 But if you squash one down by this conformal scaling,

1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:44.340
 you get the other.

1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:48.020
 So although they look and feel very different,

1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:50.460
 they're really almost the same.

1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:53.180
 The remote future on the other side,

1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:55.620
 I'm claiming is that where do the photons go?

1:18:55.620 --> 1:18:57.260
 They go into the next Big Bang.

1:18:58.740 --> 1:19:01.260
 You've got to get your mind around that crazy idea.

1:19:01.260 --> 1:19:03.820
 Taking a step on the other side of the place

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.660
 that is infinity.

1:19:05.660 --> 1:19:07.260
 Okay, but.

1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:09.100
 So I'm saying the other side of our Big Bang,

1:19:09.100 --> 1:19:10.620
 now I'm going back into the Big Bang.

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:11.460
 Back, backwards.

1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:13.820
 There was the remote future of a previous eon.

1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:15.140
 Previous eon.

1:19:15.140 --> 1:19:17.620
 And what I'm saying is that previous eon,

1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:20.300
 there are signals coming through to us,

1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:23.860
 which we can see and which we do see.

1:19:23.860 --> 1:19:25.180
 And these are both signals,

1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:29.540
 the two main signals are to do with black holes.

1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:33.140
 One of them is the collisions between black holes.

1:19:33.140 --> 1:19:35.300
 And as they spiral into each other,

1:19:35.300 --> 1:19:37.060
 they release a lot of energy

1:19:37.060 --> 1:19:39.220
 in the form of gravitational waves.

1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:42.300
 Those gravitational waves get through

1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:44.260
 in a certain form into the next eon.

1:19:44.260 --> 1:19:46.340
 That's fascinating that there's some,

1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:49.140
 I mean, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,

1:19:49.140 --> 1:19:52.100
 but that means that some information can travel

1:19:52.100 --> 1:19:53.420
 from another eon.

1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:54.340
 Exactly.

1:19:54.340 --> 1:19:58.860
 That is fascinating.

1:19:58.860 --> 1:20:01.700
 I mean, I've seen somewhere described

1:20:01.700 --> 1:20:05.340
 sort of the discussion of the Fermi Paradox,

1:20:05.340 --> 1:20:08.260
 you know, that if there's intelligent life.

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:09.100
 Yes.

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.140
 Being, you know, communication immediately takes you there.

1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:13.180
 So.

1:20:13.180 --> 1:20:16.020
 We have a paper, I have my colleague,

1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:19.820
 Vahid Guzajan, who I worked with on these ideas for a while.

1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:21.740
 We have a crazy paper on that, yes.

1:20:21.740 --> 1:20:22.580
 So.

1:20:22.580 --> 1:20:23.540
 Looking at the Fermi Paradox, yes.

1:20:23.540 --> 1:20:25.980
 Right, so if the universe is just cycling

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:27.260
 over and over and over,

1:20:27.260 --> 1:20:31.660
 punctuated by the, punctuated the singularity

1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:32.780
 of the Big Bang,

1:20:32.780 --> 1:20:36.780
 and then intelligent or any kind of intelligent systems

1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:39.580
 can communicate through from eon to eon,

1:20:39.580 --> 1:20:44.580
 why haven't we heard anything from our alien friends?

1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:46.980
 Because we don't know how to look.

1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:48.900
 That's fundamentally the reason, is we.

1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:51.820
 I don't know, you see, it's speculation.

1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:55.460
 I mean, the SETI program is a reasonable thing to do,

1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:56.940
 but still speculation.

1:20:56.940 --> 1:21:01.860
 It's trying to say, okay, maybe not too far away

1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:05.620
 was a civilization which got there first, before us,

1:21:05.620 --> 1:21:08.740
 early enough that they could send us signals,

1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:11.060
 but how far away would you need to go before,

1:21:11.060 --> 1:21:13.340
 I mean, I don't know, we have so little knowledge

1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:15.820
 about that, we haven't seen any signals yet,

1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:18.260
 but it's worth looking, it's worth looking.

1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:21.380
 What I'm trying to say, here's another possible place

1:21:21.380 --> 1:21:22.580
 where you might look.

1:21:22.580 --> 1:21:24.620
 Now you're not looking at civilizations

1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:26.220
 which got there first,

1:21:26.220 --> 1:21:27.980
 you're looking at those civilizations

1:21:27.980 --> 1:21:29.180
 which were so successful,

1:21:29.180 --> 1:21:32.420
 probably a lot more successful than they're likely to be

1:21:32.420 --> 1:21:33.580
 by the looks of things,

1:21:34.900 --> 1:21:38.100
 which knew how to handle their own global warming

1:21:38.100 --> 1:21:40.460
 or whatever it is and to get through it all

1:21:40.460 --> 1:21:45.460
 and to live to a ripe old age in the sense of a civilization

1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:49.180
 to the extent that they could harness signals

1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:52.340
 that they could propagate through for some reason

1:21:52.340 --> 1:21:55.700
 of their own desires, whatever we wouldn't know

1:21:55.700 --> 1:21:57.780
 to other civilizations

1:21:57.780 --> 1:22:00.180
 which might be able to pick up the signals.

1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:01.980
 But what kind of signals would they be?

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:03.260
 I haven't the foggiest.

1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:06.460
 Let me ask the question.

1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:07.300
 Yes.

1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:09.060
 What to you is the most beautiful idea

1:22:09.060 --> 1:22:12.620
 in physics or mathematics or the art

1:22:12.620 --> 1:22:14.180
 at the intersection of the two?

1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:17.180
 I'm gonna have to say complex analysis.

1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:19.620
 I might've said infinities.

1:22:19.620 --> 1:22:22.620
 And one of the most single, most beautiful idea

1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:24.460
 I think was the fact that you can have

1:22:24.460 --> 1:22:26.860
 infinities of different sizes and so on.

1:22:26.860 --> 1:22:30.380
 But that's in a way, I think complex analysis.

1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:32.940
 It's got so much magic in it.

1:22:32.940 --> 1:22:34.860
 It's a very simple idea.

1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:39.460
 You take these, you take numbers,

1:22:39.460 --> 1:22:41.820
 you take the integers and then you fill them up

1:22:41.820 --> 1:22:44.180
 into the fractions and the real numbers.

1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:46.780
 You imagine you're trying to measure a continuous line

1:22:46.780 --> 1:22:50.420
 and then you think of how you can solve equations.

1:22:50.420 --> 1:22:53.420
 Then what about X squared equals minus one?

1:22:54.460 --> 1:22:57.460
 Well, there's no real number which has to satisfy that.

1:22:57.460 --> 1:23:01.340
 So you have to think of, well, there's a number called I.

1:23:01.340 --> 1:23:02.340
 You think you invent it.

1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:05.180
 Well, in a certain sense, it's there already.

1:23:05.180 --> 1:23:07.460
 But this number, when you add that square root

1:23:07.460 --> 1:23:08.300
 of minus one to it,

1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:10.940
 you have what's called the complex numbers.

1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.740
 And they're an incredible system.

1:23:13.860 --> 1:23:15.700
 If you like, you put one little thing in,

1:23:15.700 --> 1:23:17.340
 you put square root of minus one in

1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:20.620
 and you get how much benefit out of it.

1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:23.420
 All sorts of things that you'd never imagined before.

1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:27.740
 And it's that amazing, all hiding there

1:23:27.740 --> 1:23:30.140
 in putting that square root of minus one in.

1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:32.660
 I think that's the most magical thing I've seen

1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:34.020
 in mathematics or physics.

1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:35.580
 And it's in quantum mechanics.

1:23:35.580 --> 1:23:36.420
 And in quantum mechanics.

1:23:36.420 --> 1:23:38.220
 You see, it's there already.

1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:39.700
 You might think, what's it doing there?

1:23:39.700 --> 1:23:41.660
 Okay, just a nice beautiful piece of mathematics.

1:23:41.660 --> 1:23:44.180
 And then suddenly we see, nope.

1:23:44.180 --> 1:23:47.220
 It's the very crucial basis of quantum mechanics.

1:23:47.220 --> 1:23:49.540
 It's there and the way the world works.

1:23:49.540 --> 1:23:50.980
 So on the question of whether math

1:23:50.980 --> 1:23:52.820
 is discovered or invented,

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:54.620
 it sounds like you may be suggesting

1:23:54.620 --> 1:23:56.180
 that partially it's possible

1:23:56.180 --> 1:23:57.860
 that math is indeed discovered.

1:23:57.860 --> 1:23:59.660
 Oh, absolutely, yes.

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:02.180
 No, it's more like archeology than you might think.

1:24:02.180 --> 1:24:03.900
 Yes, yes.

1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:06.580
 So let me ask the most ridiculous,

1:24:06.580 --> 1:24:08.660
 maybe the most important question.

1:24:08.660 --> 1:24:11.580
 What is the meaning of life?

1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:15.060
 What gives your life fulfillment, purpose,

1:24:15.060 --> 1:24:16.020
 happiness, and meaning?

1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:18.260
 Why do you think we're here on this?

1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:20.980
 Given all the big bang and the infinities of photons

1:24:20.980 --> 1:24:21.820
 that we've talked about.

1:24:21.820 --> 1:24:24.340
 All I would say, I think it's not a stupid question.

1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:28.180
 I mean, there are some people, you know,

1:24:28.180 --> 1:24:29.780
 many of my colleagues who are scientists,

1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:31.340
 and they say, well, that's a stupid question,

1:24:31.340 --> 1:24:32.540
 meaning, yeah, well, we're just here

1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:35.420
 because things came together and produced life

1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:36.260
 and so what.

1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:39.260
 I think there's more to it.

1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:41.100
 But what there is that's more to it,

1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:43.140
 I have really much idea.

1:24:43.140 --> 1:24:44.420
 And it might be somehow connected

1:24:44.420 --> 1:24:46.300
 to the mechanisms of consciousness

1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:49.540
 that we've been talking about, the mystery there.

1:24:49.540 --> 1:24:51.060
 It's connected with all sorts of, yeah,

1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:53.660
 I think these things are tied up in ways which are,

1:24:54.900 --> 1:24:56.780
 you see, I tend to think the mystery of consciousness

1:24:56.780 --> 1:25:00.980
 is tied up with the mystery of quantum mechanics

1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:04.020
 and how it fits in with the classical world,

1:25:04.020 --> 1:25:07.460
 and that's all to do with the mystery of complex numbers.

1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:10.700
 And there are mysteries there

1:25:10.700 --> 1:25:13.060
 which look like mathematical mysteries,

1:25:13.060 --> 1:25:15.740
 but they seem to have a bearing

1:25:15.740 --> 1:25:17.740
 on the way the physical world operates.

1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:20.780
 We're scratching the surface.

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:22.980
 We have a long, huge way to go

1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:24.820
 before we really understand that.

1:25:24.820 --> 1:25:28.340
 And it's a beautiful idea that the depth,

1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:30.700
 the mathematical depth could be discovered,

1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:32.940
 and then there's tragedies of ghettos

1:25:32.940 --> 1:25:34.460
 and completeness along the way

1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:37.540
 that we'll have to somehow figure our ways around.

1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:38.900
 Yeah.

1:25:38.900 --> 1:25:42.100
 So, Roger, it was a huge honor to talk to you.

1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:43.500
 Thank you so much for your time today.

1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:44.540
 It's been my pleasure.

1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:46.100
 Thank you.

1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:47.620
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1:26:17.020 --> 1:26:19.340
 that Roger Penrose wrote in his book,

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:20.580
 The Emperor's New Mind.

1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:24.460
 Beneath all this technicality is the feeling

1:26:24.460 --> 1:26:28.060
 that it is indeed, quote unquote, obvious

1:26:28.060 --> 1:26:31.220
 that the conscious mind cannot work like a computer,

1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:33.060
 even though much of what is involved

1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:35.460
 in mental activity might do so.

1:26:35.460 --> 1:26:39.580
 This is the kind of obviousness that a child can see,

1:26:39.580 --> 1:26:42.740
 though the child may later in life become browbeaten

1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:44.820
 into believing that the obvious problems

1:26:44.820 --> 1:26:47.260
 are quote unquote, non problems,

1:26:47.260 --> 1:26:51.060
 to be argued into nonexistence by careful reasoning

1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:52.900
 and clever choices of definition.

1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:56.540
 Children sometimes see things clearly

1:26:56.540 --> 1:26:59.100
 that are obscured in later life.

1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:02.460
 We often forget the wonder that we felt as children

1:27:02.460 --> 1:27:05.300
 when the cares of the quote unquote, real world

1:27:05.300 --> 1:27:07.860
 had begun to settle on our shoulders.

1:27:07.860 --> 1:27:10.540
 Children are not afraid to pose basic questions

1:27:10.540 --> 1:27:13.620
 that may embarrass us as adults to ask.

1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:15.740
 What happens to each of our streams of consciousness

1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:17.220
 after we die?

1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:19.580
 Where was it before we were born?

1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.220
 Might we become or have been someone else?

1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:25.180
 Why do we perceive it all?

1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:26.900
 Why are we here?

1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:28.620
 Why is there a universe here at all

1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:30.900
 in which we can actually be?

1:27:30.900 --> 1:27:32.660
 These are puzzles that tend to come

1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:35.980
 with the awakenings of awareness in any of us

1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:39.980
 and no doubt with the awakening of self awareness

1:27:39.980 --> 1:27:43.700
 within whichever creature or other entity it first came.

1:27:43.700 --> 1:28:01.700
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
