00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
 The following is a conversation with Neal Stephenson, a legendary science fiction writer

00:04.760 --> 00:10.680
 exploring ideas in mathematics, science, cryptography, money, linguistics, philosophy, and virtual

00:10.680 --> 00:17.140
 reality, from his early book Snow Crash to his new one called Termination Shock.

00:17.140 --> 00:19.020
 He doesn't just write novels.

00:19.020 --> 00:25.100
 He worked at the space company Blue Origin for many years, including technically being

00:25.100 --> 00:27.180
 Blue Origin's first employee.

00:27.180 --> 00:33.280
 He also was the chief futurist at the virtual reality company Magic Leap.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.200
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.680
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:38.680 --> 00:43.560
 And now, here's my conversation with Neal Stephenson.

00:43.560 --> 00:50.840
 You write both historical fiction, like World War II in Cryptonomicon, and science fiction,

00:50.840 --> 00:53.240
 looking both into the past and the future.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.280
 So let me ask, does history repeat itself, in which way does it repeat itself, in which

00:58.280 --> 00:59.720
 way does it not?

00:59.720 --> 01:02.760
 I'm afraid it repeats itself a lot.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.920
 So I think human nature kind of is what it is.

01:05.920 --> 01:12.320
 And so we tend to see similar behavior patterns emerging again and again.

01:12.320 --> 01:20.120
 And so it's kind of the exception rather than the rule when something new happens.

01:20.120 --> 01:25.600
 What role does technology play in the suppression or in revealing human nature?

01:25.600 --> 01:33.720
 Well, the standards of living, life expectancy, all that have gotten incredibly better within

01:33.720 --> 01:36.800
 the last, particularly the last hundred years.

01:36.800 --> 01:44.200
 I mean, just antibiotics, modern vaccines, electrification, the internet.

01:44.200 --> 01:51.600
 These are all improvements in most people's standard of living and health and longevity

01:51.600 --> 01:57.440
 that exceed anything that was seen before in human history.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.800
 So people are living longer, they're generally healthier, and so on.

02:02.800 --> 02:09.520
 But again, we still see a lot of the same behavior patterns, some of which are not very

02:09.520 --> 02:10.520
 attractive.

02:10.520 --> 02:15.600
 So some of it has to do with the constraints on resources, presumably with technology you

02:15.600 --> 02:17.640
 have less and less constraints on resources.

02:17.640 --> 02:22.680
 So we get to maybe emphasize the better angels of our nature.

02:22.680 --> 02:30.520
 And in so doing, does that not potentially fundamentally alter the sort of the experience

02:30.520 --> 02:32.120
 that we have of life on earth?

02:32.120 --> 02:37.940
 You know, until the last 10 or so years, I would have taken that view, I think.

02:37.940 --> 02:49.000
 But you know, people will find ways to be divisive and angry if it scratches a kind

02:49.000 --> 02:51.840
 of psychological itch that they have got.

02:51.840 --> 02:57.640
 And we used to look at the Weimar Republic, what happened in the economic collapse of

02:57.640 --> 03:09.140
 Germany prior to the rise of Hitler, World War II, and kind of explain Hitler, at least

03:09.140 --> 03:17.120
 partially by just the misery that people were living in at that time.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.440
 The economic collapse.

03:18.440 --> 03:25.560
 Yeah, hyperinflation and unemployment and the decline in standard of living.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.360
 And that sounds like a plausible explanation.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.240
 But there are economic troubles now for sure.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.320
 We had the bank collapse in 2008.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.920
 And there's stagnation in some people's standards of living.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.180
 But it's hard to explain what we've seen in this country in the last few years just strictly

03:44.180 --> 03:49.440
 on the basis of people are poor and angry and sad.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.180
 I think they want to be angry.

03:52.180 --> 03:58.960
 So without being political in a divisive kind of way, can we talk about the lessons you

03:58.960 --> 04:01.400
 can draw from World War II?

04:01.400 --> 04:02.400
 Sure.

04:02.400 --> 04:09.100
 This singular event in human history, it seems like, and yet, as you say, history rhymes

04:09.100 --> 04:10.280
 at the very least.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.280
 Yeah.

04:11.280 --> 04:17.620
 Being who I am, I tend to focus on the curious technological things that happened in conjunction

04:17.620 --> 04:20.160
 with that war.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.720
 Which may not be where you want to go.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.720
 Well, there's several things.

04:23.720 --> 04:24.720
 Sorry to interrupt.

04:24.720 --> 04:30.400
 So one in Cryptonomicon is more like the Alan Turing side of things, right?

04:30.400 --> 04:35.240
 And then there's the outside of technology.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.240
 First of all, there's the tools of war, which is a kind of technology.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.840
 But then there's just like the human nature, the nature of good and evil.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.840
 Yeah.

04:42.840 --> 04:49.040
 Well, so one of the things that emerges from the war and from the extermination camps is

04:49.040 --> 04:55.200
 that we were never allowed to have illusions anymore about human nature.

04:55.200 --> 05:03.040
 So you have to learn that lesson to be an educated person, and you have to know that

05:03.040 --> 05:09.160
 even in a supposedly enlightened, civilized society, people can become monsters quite

05:09.160 --> 05:10.560
 easily.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.520
 So that is for sure the big takeaway.

05:13.520 --> 05:22.680
 Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn about the line between good and evil runs through the heart

05:22.680 --> 05:23.680
 of every man?

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
 Yeah.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.720
 That all of us are capable?

05:26.720 --> 05:27.720
 Great line.

05:27.720 --> 05:28.720
 Yeah.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.720
 Of evil?

05:29.720 --> 05:35.480
 I read a good chunk of the Gulag Archipelago when I was a teenager because my grandfather

05:35.480 --> 05:41.040
 had it in his house because he was one of these Americans who was obsessed with the

05:41.040 --> 05:49.920
 Soviet Union and the Soviet threat and wanted people to be aware of some of what had happened.

05:49.920 --> 05:55.800
 And so he had those books lying around and I would read them.

05:55.800 --> 06:03.440
 And it's a similar kind of parallel story to what happened in Germany during the war,

06:03.440 --> 06:13.520
 this creation of this system of camps and oppression and lots of troubling behavior.

06:13.520 --> 06:22.440
 To me it's a story of how fear and desperation combined with a charismatic leader can lead

06:22.440 --> 06:23.920
 to evil.

06:23.920 --> 06:31.760
 But it's also a story of bravery, of love, of brotherhood and sisterhood and basically

06:31.760 --> 06:32.760
 survival.

06:32.760 --> 06:40.520
 You have a man's search for meaning, which is the story of a man in a concentration camp

06:40.520 --> 06:45.840
 basically finding beauty in life even under most extreme conditions.

06:45.840 --> 06:53.600
 So to me World War II is not necessarily a bleak view of human nature.

06:53.600 --> 07:02.640
 It's a little moment of evil that revealed a much bigger good in humanity.

07:02.640 --> 07:08.460
 So I'm not so sure that it leads me to a pessimistic view of the world, the fact that somebody

07:08.460 --> 07:14.040
 like Hitler could happen, the fact that a lot of people could follow Hitler and get

07:14.040 --> 07:20.920
 excited and maybe even love the hate of the other for some moment of time.

07:20.920 --> 07:28.000
 I think all of us are capable of that, but I think all of us also have a capacity for

07:28.000 --> 07:29.120
 good.

07:29.120 --> 07:36.360
 And I think, I don't know what you think, but I think we have a greater desire for good

07:36.360 --> 07:38.000
 than evil.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.600
 And it seems like that's where technology is very useful as a guide, as a helping hand.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
 Okay.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.600
 Can you give me an example maybe?

07:48.600 --> 07:54.200
 So I give you examples of futuristic technologies and I can give you examples of current technologies.

07:54.200 --> 08:04.640
 Current technologies, knowledge in the form of very basic knowledge, which is like Wikipedia

08:04.640 --> 08:12.000
 and search the original dream of Google that I think is very much a success, which is making

08:12.000 --> 08:15.240
 the world's information accessible at your fingertips.

08:15.240 --> 08:24.480
 That kind of technology enables the natural, if this axiom, this assumption that people

08:24.480 --> 08:31.040
 want to do good is true, then letting them discover all of the information out there,

08:31.040 --> 08:36.360
 false information and true information, all of it, and let them explore that's going to

08:36.360 --> 08:40.780
 lead to a better world, to better people.

08:40.780 --> 08:48.360
 Fascist technologies is, I personally, I mentioned to you offline, sort of love artificial intelligence.

08:48.360 --> 08:55.440
 And so AI that's an assistant, that's a guide, like a mentor to you, that you can in the

08:55.440 --> 09:02.160
 way that Google searches, but smarter, where you can help send it out and say, this is

09:02.160 --> 09:08.760
 the direction in which I want to grow, not authoritarian lecturing down from the algorithm

09:08.760 --> 09:16.320
 of telling you this is how you should grow, but almost the opposite, where you use it

09:16.320 --> 09:23.480
 as an assistant, a servant in your journey towards knowledge.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.240
 That sounds like an easy thing, but it's actually from an AI perspective very difficult.

09:27.240 --> 09:33.080
 I mean, this is the theme of a book I wrote called The Diamond Age, which talks about

09:33.080 --> 09:35.840
 a book that essentially does that.

09:35.840 --> 09:41.920
 And I've been sort of watching people try to come at the problem of building that thing

09:41.920 --> 09:47.800
 from different directions for ever since the book came out, basically.

09:47.800 --> 09:55.520
 And so I kind of have, although I haven't worked on it myself, I do get a sense of the

09:55.520 --> 10:01.920
 level of difficulty in realizing that goal.

10:01.920 --> 10:10.380
 So that book is in the 90s, so as Google is coming to be, it's essentially not Google,

10:10.380 --> 10:14.600
 but the search engine, the initial search engines, which gave birth to Google essentially

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
 in contrast.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
 Right.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.600
 Yeah.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
 Yeah.

10:18.600 --> 10:24.880
 That was still in the era of Alta Vista and Ask Jeeves and multiple different search engines.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.160
 And yeah, I'm pretty sure I had not heard of Google at that point.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.200
 That would have been 95, 96.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.360
 I think the book came out in 94.

10:33.360 --> 10:39.520
 And then, of course, the social networks followed, which is another form of guidance through

10:39.520 --> 10:41.080
 the space of information.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
 Yeah.

10:42.080 --> 10:48.160
 Well, what happens is that these things come along and then people find ways to game them.

10:48.160 --> 10:55.620
 And so I saw an interesting thread the other day pointing out that 20 years ago, if you

10:55.620 --> 11:05.280
 had Googled Pythagorean theorem, chances are you would have been taken directly to a page

11:05.280 --> 11:07.560
 explaining the Pythagorean theorem.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.720
 If you do it now, you're probably going to...

11:10.720 --> 11:15.480
 The top hits are going to be from somebody who's got an angle, who's got a scheme, right?

11:15.480 --> 11:23.440
 They're trying to sell you math tutoring or they're working some kind of marketing plan

11:23.440 --> 11:25.020
 on you.

11:25.020 --> 11:33.000
 So the traditional engines become actually less useful over time for their original educational

11:33.000 --> 11:35.160
 purpose.

11:35.160 --> 11:41.200
 That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be replaced by newer and better ones.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.680
 First of all, to defend the people with the angle, right?

11:45.680 --> 11:50.520
 They're trying to find business models to fund, oftentimes, which is funny you went

11:50.520 --> 11:58.400
 with Pythagorean, like you went at math, those greedy bastards, but it's great.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.360
 How can we monetize the Pythagorean theorem?

12:01.360 --> 12:02.360
 Yeah.

12:02.360 --> 12:08.320
 Well, I mean, education, right, is just to figure out like people who love math education,

12:08.320 --> 12:17.280
 for example, love it purely, not purely, but very often love it for itself, for just teaching

12:17.280 --> 12:18.280
 math.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.280
 Yeah.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.520
 Because, you know, when coming face to face with, for example, like the YouTube algorithm,

12:23.520 --> 12:27.960
 they start to try to figure out, okay, how can I make money off of this?

12:27.960 --> 12:36.000
 The primary goal is still that love of education, but they also want to make that love of education

12:36.000 --> 12:38.320
 their full time job.

12:38.320 --> 12:45.160
 But I see that sort of that dance of humanity with the algorithms as it finds this kind

12:45.160 --> 12:52.200
 of local pocket of optimality, or suboptimality, whatever, it gets stuck in it.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.440
 It's a pocket of some sort.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.520
 But I see that pocket as way better than what we had before in the 80s, right, or the 90s

12:59.520 --> 13:00.520
 before the internet.

13:00.520 --> 13:06.000
 But like, and now we're now, this is also human nature, we start writing very eloquent

13:06.000 --> 13:11.640
 articles about how this pocket is clearly a pocket, it's not very good, and we can imagine

13:11.640 --> 13:17.280
 much better lands far beyond, but the reality is it's better than before, and now we're

13:17.280 --> 13:20.280
 waiting for a new book.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.280
 Yeah.

13:21.280 --> 13:25.680
 And you have to wait either for lone geniuses or for some kind of momentum of a group of

13:25.680 --> 13:31.520
 geniuses that just say, enough is enough, I have an idea, this is how we get out.

13:31.520 --> 13:37.360
 And it's too easy to be sort of, I think, partially because you can get a lot of clicks

13:37.360 --> 13:42.080
 in your articles being cynical about being in this pocket, and we are forever stuck in

13:42.080 --> 13:48.800
 this pocket, and then coming up with this grandiose theory that humanity has finally,

13:48.800 --> 13:54.960
 like it's collapsing, stuck forever like a prison in this pocket, but reality, it's just

13:54.960 --> 14:01.920
 clickbait articles and books until one curious ant comes up with the next pocket.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.700
 Yeah, tunnels through the barrier or gets enough energy to jump over the barrier.

14:06.700 --> 14:12.820
 And eventually we'll be, as you've talked about, I mean, we'll colonize the solar system,

14:12.820 --> 14:18.320
 and then we'll be stuck in the solar system, and then people will say, well, we're screwed

14:18.320 --> 14:24.600
 because when the sun energy runs out, there's no way to get to the next solar system, and

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
 so on.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.840
 It goes on until we colonize the entirety of the observable universe.

14:28.840 --> 14:29.840
 Yeah.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.480
 I think getting out of the solar system is going to be a hard one.

14:33.480 --> 14:40.700
 So can you, you mentioned this, can you elaborate why you think, back to sort of a serious question,

14:40.700 --> 14:44.020
 why do you think it's hard to get outside of our solar system?

14:44.020 --> 14:46.640
 It's just an energy calculation.

14:46.640 --> 14:56.340
 I mean, you can do it slowly whenever you want, but the idea of getting there in one

14:56.340 --> 15:05.340
 lifetime or a few lifetimes requires huge amounts of energy to accelerate.

15:05.340 --> 15:10.340
 And then as soon as you get halfway there, you need to expend an equal amount of energy

15:10.340 --> 15:15.060
 to decelerate, or you'll just go shooting by.

15:15.060 --> 15:18.360
 And so that means carrying a lot of energy.

15:18.360 --> 15:26.740
 And there's ideas like Yuri Milner, I think, is still funding the idea to use laser propulsion

15:26.740 --> 15:32.420
 to send something to another star system, a small object.

15:32.420 --> 15:35.660
 But it'll have no way to slow down, as far as I know.

15:35.660 --> 15:39.180
 They never talk about that part, like how do we slow down?

15:39.180 --> 15:40.180
 Yeah.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.980
 It's a quick flyby to take a good picture, I guess.

15:42.980 --> 15:45.780
 Yeah, you better take some good pictures on your way by.

15:45.780 --> 15:49.440
 So, and that's great if it happens, I'm not knocking it.

15:49.440 --> 15:55.260
 But the amount of energy that's needed is just staggering, and there's other issues

15:55.260 --> 16:02.740
 like just how do you maintain an ecosystem for that long in isolation?

16:02.740 --> 16:05.180
 How do you prevent people from going crazy?

16:05.180 --> 16:09.940
 What happens if you hit something while traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of

16:09.940 --> 16:10.940
 light?

16:10.940 --> 16:18.580
 So that's sort of some combination of expanding human lifespan, but also just good old fashioned,

16:18.580 --> 16:20.860
 stable society on a spaceship.

16:20.860 --> 16:23.460
 Yeah, yeah, the generation ship.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.460
 Yeah, yeah.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.700
 No, I think that's the only way.

16:26.700 --> 16:31.780
 It would have to keep going for a long time.

16:31.780 --> 16:38.240
 And they might get to where they're going and find a shitty solar system.

16:38.240 --> 16:46.620
 We can try to do some advanced survey, but if you get there and all the planets in that

16:46.620 --> 16:52.860
 solar system are just garbage planets, then it's kind of a big let down for this like

16:52.860 --> 16:57.620
 thousand year voyage that you've just been on, right?

16:57.620 --> 17:07.060
 So we have a pretty narrow range of parameters that we need to stay between in order to survive

17:07.060 --> 17:12.660
 in terms of the gravitational field that we can deal with.

17:12.660 --> 17:19.360
 So that sets a bound on the size of the planet and what we need in the way of temperature

17:19.360 --> 17:21.740
 and atmosphere and so on.

17:21.740 --> 17:31.180
 So when you look at all those complications, then basically building sort of exactly the

17:31.180 --> 17:36.220
 environment we want out of available materials in this solar system starts to look a hell

17:36.220 --> 17:39.180
 of a lot better.

17:39.180 --> 17:47.340
 It's hard to make an economic argument, let's say, for making that journey.

17:47.340 --> 17:51.420
 One of the things I like about the expanse is the fact that the people who are trying

17:51.420 --> 17:57.420
 to build the starship to go to the other solar system are doing it for religious reasons.

17:57.420 --> 18:04.220
 I think that's the only reason that you would do it because economically it just makes more

18:04.220 --> 18:10.020
 sense to build rotating cylindrical space habitats and make them perfect.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.260
 Well, isn't everything done for religious reasons?

18:13.260 --> 18:16.580
 Like why do we exploration?

18:16.580 --> 18:20.180
 Why do we go to the moon again and do the other things?

18:20.180 --> 18:23.740
 What does JFK said is not because they're easy, but because they're hard.

18:23.740 --> 18:25.980
 Isn't that kind of a religious reason?

18:25.980 --> 18:31.100
 I knew a veteran of the Apollo program who once said that the Apollo moon landings were

18:31.100 --> 18:34.380
 communism's greatest achievement.

18:34.380 --> 18:40.500
 Yeah, so the conflict between nations is a kind of...

18:40.500 --> 18:43.740
 Not exactly a religion, but it's what you're talking about.

18:43.740 --> 18:49.940
 Well, it's a struggle for meaning and that meaning isn't found in some kind of...

18:49.940 --> 18:52.220
 It's hard to find meaning in mathematics.

18:52.220 --> 18:56.540
 It's found in some kind of in music and religion, whatever, art.

18:56.540 --> 19:02.900
 Some people do, but those are probably not enough of them to...

19:02.900 --> 19:08.600
 People that find meaning in mathematics, they usually find meaning between the lines nevertheless,

19:08.600 --> 19:15.780
 not in the actual proving some kind of thing.

19:15.780 --> 19:22.420
 So from a cost perspective, do you actually see a possible future where we're building

19:22.420 --> 19:31.420
 these kind of generation ships and just why not launch them one a year out like wandering

19:31.420 --> 19:36.280
 ants out into the galaxy?

19:36.280 --> 19:38.420
 I have nothing against it.

19:38.420 --> 19:46.220
 It's just, like I said, it's got the motivation to do it has to come from some kind of spiritual

19:46.220 --> 19:50.180
 or kind of non tangible calculus.

19:50.180 --> 19:54.940
 So from a business model perspective, you don't think there's a business model there?

19:54.940 --> 19:56.500
 No, no way.

19:56.500 --> 20:01.460
 One of the many fascinating things you've done in your life, you were at the very beginning,

20:01.460 --> 20:08.540
 you were the person that convinced Jeff Bezos to start a spaceship company, a space company.

20:08.540 --> 20:16.040
 You were there at Blue Origin for a few years in the beginning working on alternate propulsion

20:16.040 --> 20:22.180
 systems and at least according to Wikipedia, alternate business models.

20:22.180 --> 20:28.700
 Yeah, I mean, to go back to the first thing you said, Jeff Bezos is not a guy who required

20:28.700 --> 20:31.140
 a lot of convincing.

20:31.140 --> 20:36.140
 He'd been thinking about it since he was five years old and it was an inevitability.

20:36.140 --> 20:50.060
 But the idea that kind of got hatched in 1999 was to just do some advanced scouting work,

20:50.060 --> 20:55.340
 explore the corners of the space of possibilities.

20:55.340 --> 21:03.460
 And so that was Blue Operations LLC, which was the precursor to Blue Origin.

21:03.460 --> 21:08.820
 And so it was a small staff of people that did that for a few years.

21:08.820 --> 21:17.100
 And I think it was about 2003, 2004 that it swung decisively towards the direction it's

21:17.100 --> 21:24.580
 been following ever since, which is using basically existing aerospace technologies

21:24.580 --> 21:31.020
 and models to make chemical fueled rockets for space tourism.

21:31.020 --> 21:36.220
 I believe and I continue to believe that the fact that we use chemical rockets is just

21:36.220 --> 21:40.860
 an accident of history that comes out of World War II.

21:40.860 --> 21:48.760
 So until World War II, rockets are being built on a small scale by people like Robert Goddard.

21:48.760 --> 21:55.620
 But then Hitler desperately wants to bomb London, but he can't quite reach it and the

21:55.620 --> 21:58.580
 Luftwaffe has been kind of neutralized.

21:58.580 --> 22:07.580
 So he decides he's going to lob warheads into it with rockets, which is a terrible misallocation

22:07.580 --> 22:08.580
 of resources.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.920
 It's a terrible idea.

22:10.920 --> 22:17.780
 So it only could have happened in a dictatorship controlled by a lunatic.

22:17.780 --> 22:20.300
 But that's the situation that existed.

22:20.300 --> 22:25.420
 So they built these rockets, that's the V2.

22:25.420 --> 22:32.320
 And then it's just a complete coincidence that that war ends with atomic bombs being

22:32.320 --> 22:37.160
 developed in a completely separate super weapon program.

22:37.160 --> 22:44.140
 And so suddenly the existence of the bombs creates a demand for rockets that didn't exist

22:44.140 --> 22:50.420
 before because if you've got atomic bombs, you need a way to deliver them.

22:50.420 --> 22:56.700
 You can do it with bombers, but it's a lot better to just hurl them to the other side

22:56.700 --> 23:00.300
 of the world on the top of a rocket.

23:00.300 --> 23:06.100
 So suddenly rockets, which had gotten a boost because of Hitler's V2 program, got a much

23:06.100 --> 23:10.740
 bigger boost during the 50s and 60s.

23:10.740 --> 23:15.500
 And it is a complete, you're right, for some reason I never thought of this, it is an accident

23:15.500 --> 23:20.580
 of history that nuclear weapons are developed at a similar time.

23:20.580 --> 23:25.100
 First of all, nuclear weapons didn't have to be developed at the same time as World

23:25.100 --> 23:26.420
 War II.

23:26.420 --> 23:27.420
 That's an accident in history.

23:27.420 --> 23:34.060
 And then the fact, okay, so then Hitler started using rockets, that's an accident of, okay,

23:34.060 --> 23:35.060
 that's fascinating.

23:35.060 --> 23:38.620
 That's a fascinating set of coincidences.

23:38.620 --> 23:42.580
 Yeah, which is true of a lot of technologies, by the way.

23:42.580 --> 23:50.160
 By the time these rockets are kind of working, we've got hydrogen bombs that are so big and

23:50.160 --> 23:54.540
 so devastating that nobody really wants to use them.

23:54.540 --> 24:00.620
 But it turns out you can fit a capsule with a couple of people in it into the socket on

24:00.620 --> 24:08.140
 the end of a missile that was made to hold a hydrogen bomb.

24:08.140 --> 24:15.500
 So we start doing that instead as a proxy for having a war.

24:15.500 --> 24:22.460
 I'd love to be in the meeting where the first guy brought that up as an idea.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.460
 It's probably a Russian.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.980
 Why don't we strap a person to the rocket?

24:25.980 --> 24:26.980
 Yeah, yeah.

24:26.980 --> 24:30.100
 Well, it probably was because they did it first, right?

24:30.100 --> 24:31.100
 The Russians did it first.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.340
 And they had perhaps less respect for sort of safety protocols.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.340
 Could be.

24:35.340 --> 24:40.180
 They were a little bit more willing to sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to risk the life

24:40.180 --> 24:41.180
 of an astronaut.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.180
 Could be.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.180
 Yeah, yeah.

24:43.180 --> 24:47.500
 This is basically the story of how through all of this competition and because of these

24:47.500 --> 24:56.260
 historical accidents, trillions of R&D dollars and rubles were put into development of chemical

24:56.260 --> 25:02.120
 rocket technology, which has now advanced to an incredibly high degree.

25:02.120 --> 25:08.220
 But there's other ways to make things go really fast, which is all that rockets do.

25:08.220 --> 25:09.340
 That's all orbit is.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.620
 It's just going really fast.

25:12.620 --> 25:19.620
 And because so many nerds are obsessed with space, people have been thinking about alternate

25:19.620 --> 25:24.440
 schemes for as long as they've been thinking about rockets.

25:24.440 --> 25:33.020
 And so one of the first things that I learned kind of trying to explore new possibilities

25:33.020 --> 25:42.020
 was that I could put all of my brainpower to work and be creative as I could and invent

25:42.020 --> 25:46.540
 some idea that I thought was new for making things go fast.

25:46.540 --> 25:51.760
 And I would always find out that some guy in Russia or somewhere had thought the same

25:51.760 --> 25:57.620
 idea up 50 years ago and figured out all the math.

25:57.620 --> 26:03.940
 And so at a certain point, you give up on trying to invent completely new ideas and

26:03.940 --> 26:10.100
 just go poking around trying to find those guys.

26:10.100 --> 26:15.420
 So there's a number of ideas that we looked at.

26:15.420 --> 26:18.540
 Some are crazier, some are less crazy.

26:18.540 --> 26:23.740
 And the direction that that company eventually took was chemical rockets.

26:23.740 --> 26:26.660
 Is there something you can comment on possible ideas?

26:26.660 --> 26:34.380
 So first of all, you could use nuclear, so nuclear propulsion.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.380
 Yeah.

26:35.380 --> 26:40.860
 So that's, I mean, you've probably heard of Project Orion, which was the...

26:40.860 --> 26:50.180
 Freeman Dyson and some of his collaborators had a scheme to power a large space vehicle

26:50.180 --> 26:53.580
 by detonating atomic bombs behind it.

26:53.580 --> 26:58.700
 And so one of the other people who was working at Blue Operations during this time was George

26:58.700 --> 27:01.280
 Dyson, the son of Freeman.

27:01.280 --> 27:08.220
 And so we knew all about Project Orion and he found an old film that they'd shot on a

27:08.220 --> 27:16.420
 beach in La Jolla of a prototype of this that was powered by like lumps of C4.

27:16.420 --> 27:21.820
 So that was an idea, but for a private company, obtaining a large number of atomic bombs was

27:21.820 --> 27:23.420
 probably out of scope.

27:23.420 --> 27:27.340
 So it was more of a theoretical thing.

27:27.340 --> 27:38.420
 There's a conceptually similar approach using lasers that Freeman worked on with Arthur

27:38.420 --> 27:44.620
 Kantrowitz and some others, where you take a pulsed laser and you fire it at a vehicle

27:44.620 --> 27:47.480
 that has a block of ice on the back.

27:47.480 --> 27:55.600
 And the pulse hits the ice and flashes off a layer of steam that becomes plasma.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.420
 And plasma is opaque because it conducts.

27:58.420 --> 28:04.380
 And so being opaque, it then absorbs all of the energy from the laser pulse and gets

28:04.380 --> 28:10.060
 really hot and just pushes on the back of the block of ice.

28:10.060 --> 28:14.140
 And then you wait a moment for that to dissipate and then you do it again.

28:14.140 --> 28:19.140
 So it would just kind of vibrate its way.

28:19.140 --> 28:23.380
 Like it sounds really violent, but Freeman said that if you were wearing like rubber

28:23.380 --> 28:31.060
 sold tennis shoes standing in this vehicle, you would just feel a mild vibration.

28:31.060 --> 28:35.420
 So there your source of energy is on the ground and you're getting higher specific impulse

28:35.420 --> 28:39.480
 than you could get by burning chemicals.

28:39.480 --> 28:47.740
 Jordan Kerr and others worked on another laser system, the late Dr. Jordan Kerr, that just

28:47.740 --> 28:55.500
 would heat up a heat exchanger by many converging solid state lasers from the ground.

28:55.500 --> 29:05.180
 And Kevin Parkin works on a similar scheme that just uses microwaves to do that.

29:05.180 --> 29:07.420
 We looked at tall towers.

29:07.420 --> 29:13.940
 I spent a while looking kind of semi seriously at giant bullwhips.

29:13.940 --> 29:15.460
 What's a bullwhip?

29:15.460 --> 29:19.580
 Just a whip, you have them here in Texas, right?

29:19.580 --> 29:21.980
 Yeah, I understand.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.940
 But how does that have to do with propulsion?

29:23.940 --> 29:29.580
 If you think about it, a whip is an incredibly simple primitive object that can break the

29:29.580 --> 29:31.880
 speed of sound.

29:31.880 --> 29:39.860
 So it's unbelievable in a way that for thousands of years, people with no technology have been

29:39.860 --> 29:49.100
 able to accelerate objects through the speed of sound just through an architectural trick.

29:49.100 --> 29:58.940
 Just the physics of a moving bend of material in a medium can do this.

29:58.940 --> 30:02.300
 So that's the thing I still think about from time to time.

30:02.300 --> 30:10.940
 You can use the same physics to make freestanding loops of chain or other flexible materials

30:10.940 --> 30:14.700
 that just kind of stand up under their own physics.

30:14.700 --> 30:19.900
 I mean, it's kind of awesome to imagine.

30:19.900 --> 30:28.220
 So imagine using the same kind of physics of a whip, but have at the end of it a spaceship.

30:28.220 --> 30:34.220
 That would detach at the moment of maximum velocity.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.900
 Why not?

30:36.900 --> 30:37.900
 Why wouldn't that?

30:37.900 --> 30:43.260
 So part of my motivation in studying that was to ask that question.

30:43.260 --> 30:52.560
 It was more almost a symbolic way of saying, look, there's all kinds of physics we haven't

30:52.560 --> 30:55.200
 explored yet.

30:55.200 --> 31:01.500
 It's no more crazy than the idea of chemical rockets.

31:01.500 --> 31:08.100
 It's just that more money's gone into chemical rockets, right?

31:08.100 --> 31:14.440
 Can I ask you a question on propulsion that's a little bit more out there?

31:14.440 --> 31:21.860
 So I don't know if you've seen quite a lot of recent articles and reports and so on about

31:21.860 --> 31:26.660
 UFOs, like the Tic Tac aircraft.

31:26.660 --> 31:32.740
 I keep seeing a lot of chatter about it, but I haven't gone deep into it.

31:32.740 --> 31:42.420
 So the DOD released footage filmed by pilots, and there's a lot of reports about objects

31:42.420 --> 31:49.620
 that moved in ways they haven't seen before that seem to defy the laws of physics if we

31:49.620 --> 31:52.640
 consider the aircraft that we have today.

31:52.640 --> 32:02.420
 So the reason I asked you that is because it kind of, to me, whatever the heck it is,

32:02.420 --> 32:08.040
 it's inspiring for the possibilities of ideas for propulsion.

32:08.040 --> 32:15.020
 If it's like secret projects from foreign nations or it's physical phenomena that we

32:15.020 --> 32:20.500
 don't yet understand, like ball lightning, all those kinds of things, or if it is aliens

32:20.500 --> 32:23.740
 or objects from an alien civilization.

32:23.740 --> 32:28.980
 I most likely believe if it's an object from an alien civilization, it's got to be like

32:28.980 --> 32:32.660
 a really dumb drone that just got lost.

32:32.660 --> 32:37.100
 It's definitely not like the pinnacle of intelligence.

32:37.100 --> 32:42.180
 It's like some teenager's science fair experiment.

32:42.180 --> 32:47.660
 Yeah, it just flew for a few centuries out and just landed, and then we humans are all

32:47.660 --> 32:51.820
 like really excited about this wild thing.

32:51.820 --> 32:54.940
 I mean, what do you think about those...

32:54.940 --> 32:57.420
 First of all, like the millions of reports of UFOs, right?

32:57.420 --> 33:03.520
 There's some psychology there that's deeply cultural, but also the possibility of aliens

33:03.520 --> 33:05.020
 having visited Earth.

33:05.020 --> 33:09.420
 Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see some better pictures.

33:09.420 --> 33:14.300
 For the reason I mentioned earlier, having to do with the difficulty of traveling between

33:14.300 --> 33:19.460
 star systems, it's really hard for me to believe it's aliens.

33:19.460 --> 33:25.600
 I just can't understand why you would go to all that trouble to transport something across

33:25.600 --> 33:32.420
 light years and then do what these UFOs are allegedly doing.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.040
 Like how is that interesting?

33:34.040 --> 33:36.420
 How does that justify the trip?

33:36.420 --> 33:45.540
 So if you travel across those kinds of distances, you would make a bigger splash.

33:45.540 --> 33:51.340
 First of all, I would expect that the arrival of these things would be something we'd notice.

33:51.340 --> 33:58.300
 It's got to decelerate into our solar system unless it got here really, really, really

33:58.300 --> 33:59.300
 slowly.

33:59.300 --> 34:04.200
 So I guess that's a possibility and just kind of snuck in.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.020
 So at the end, we would detect some kind of footprint in terms of energy.

34:08.020 --> 34:09.080
 You would think.

34:09.080 --> 34:17.280
 So I actually think your idea of a science fair project gone bad, it makes more sense

34:17.280 --> 34:23.760
 in that it would explain why if these things are alien technologies, they're just kind

34:23.760 --> 34:32.300
 of hanging around our aircraft carriers for no particular reason, like not trying to communicate.

34:32.300 --> 34:39.420
 Can you imagine a scenario where aliens have visited Earth or are visiting Earth and we

34:39.420 --> 34:41.180
 wouldn't notice it at all?

34:41.180 --> 34:42.180
 Oh, sure.

34:42.180 --> 34:48.580
 I mean, if they've got technology to get here, they've probably got technology to conceal

34:48.580 --> 34:50.940
 the fact that they're trying to conceal themselves.

34:50.940 --> 34:56.380
 I meant more like they're not trying to conceal themselves, but we're just our cognitive capabilities

34:56.380 --> 35:00.940
 are like too limited and we are not thinking big enough.

35:00.940 --> 35:05.500
 We're looking for little green men, we're looking for things that operate at a time

35:05.500 --> 35:10.940
 scale that's human like, you know.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.260
 I love thinking about ideas like that.

35:13.260 --> 35:20.080
 That's great science fiction novel fodder that the aliens are so different that we simply

35:20.080 --> 35:22.540
 don't see them.

35:22.540 --> 35:29.860
 Is there, in terms of language, do you think it would be difficult, not aliens visiting

35:29.860 --> 35:34.140
 us but traveling to other places to find a common language?

35:34.140 --> 35:41.800
 You've written about the importance of language in intelligent civilizations.

35:41.800 --> 35:47.420
 How difficult is the problem to bridge the gap between aliens and humans in terms of

35:47.420 --> 35:50.100
 language so we're not lost in translation?

35:50.100 --> 35:54.460
 Yeah, I mean, there's different takes on that depending on how biologically similar they

35:54.460 --> 35:56.540
 are to us, you know.

35:56.540 --> 36:04.380
 I mean, there's a school of thought that says, basically, advanced life has to be carbon

36:04.380 --> 36:07.560
 based for just reasons of chemistry.

36:07.560 --> 36:14.460
 So right away, if you impose that limitation, then you're kind of assuming something that's

36:14.460 --> 36:17.660
 starting to be biologically similar to us.

36:17.660 --> 36:25.660
 So if they're about as big as we are and they kind of move around in space, in a physical

36:25.660 --> 36:32.840
 body the way we do, then there's probably a way to solve that communication problem.

36:32.840 --> 36:40.300
 If they're beings of pure energy from Star Trek or something like that, then it's a different

36:40.300 --> 36:41.300
 story.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.500
 Well, I love thinking about that kind of stuff too.

36:42.500 --> 36:47.700
 I mean, consciousness itself may be alien.

36:47.700 --> 36:55.140
 I mean, it could be, like you said, beings of pure energy.

36:55.140 --> 37:01.220
 I think of life as just complex systems, and the kind of forms those complex systems can

37:01.220 --> 37:06.900
 take seems to be much larger than the particular biological systems we see here on Earth.

37:06.900 --> 37:11.420
 I have to ask a Twitter question about aliens.

37:11.420 --> 37:12.420
 You ready?

37:12.420 --> 37:13.420
 This is for Twitter.

37:13.420 --> 37:14.420
 I'm ready.

37:14.420 --> 37:15.700
 What would you expect from Twitter?

37:15.700 --> 37:19.540
 Can humans have sex with aliens?

37:19.540 --> 37:20.540
 Neil Stevenson.

37:20.540 --> 37:24.540
 You could pass.

37:24.540 --> 37:25.900
 I asked a language question.

37:25.900 --> 37:26.900
 Can they communicate?

37:26.900 --> 37:27.900
 Yeah.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.980
 Can they fall in love before sex?

37:30.980 --> 37:33.660
 That's how it works.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.420
 So which question am I answering?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.820
 The sex or the love?

37:37.820 --> 37:45.300
 I mean, it depends what is more fundamental to relations across intelligent species.

37:45.300 --> 37:46.300
 Yeah.

37:46.300 --> 37:49.980
 I mean, sex can mean a lot of things.

37:49.980 --> 37:51.980
 So I mean, if you're...

37:51.980 --> 37:53.260
 Your production, right?

37:53.260 --> 38:02.660
 You know, in Star Trek, in classic Star Trek, you had to really suspend your disbelief to

38:02.660 --> 38:07.940
 think that Spock was half Vulcan and half human, right?

38:07.940 --> 38:15.900
 Because that's just not going to work DNA wise.

38:15.900 --> 38:26.820
 So if by sex, you mean reproductive sex, then I would say no, unless you go to a panspermia

38:26.820 --> 38:34.980
 kind of theory, which is that, you know, humans were seeded onto the planet as part of a galactic,

38:34.980 --> 38:40.100
 you know, program of some sort.

38:40.100 --> 38:44.500
 And then we're just returning home, hanging out with our old relatives.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.500
 Distant cousins.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.500
 Yeah.

38:46.500 --> 38:52.260
 But that doesn't seem, you know, it doesn't seem plausible.

38:52.260 --> 39:00.620
 We know that humans had sex with Neanderthals, with Denisovans, so you could think of them

39:00.620 --> 39:06.860
 as aliens that came from our planet.

39:06.860 --> 39:11.780
 So that's a kind of data point, I guess.

39:11.780 --> 39:19.700
 But you know, if you broaden your definition of sex to mean any kind of gratifying physical

39:19.700 --> 39:21.900
 interaction then sure.

39:21.900 --> 39:22.900
 Right.

39:22.900 --> 39:23.900
 Dancing.

39:23.900 --> 39:27.100
 And that's how we get to love.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.540
 And love can take many forms.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.260
 Love can certainly take many forms.

39:30.260 --> 39:36.260
 I have to ask you, in terms of space, just looking at where Blue Origin is, looking at

39:36.260 --> 39:43.780
 where SpaceX is today, and maybe looking out 10, 20 years out from now, are you impressed

39:43.780 --> 39:44.780
 at what's happening?

39:44.780 --> 39:47.460
 We just saw William Shatner go up to space.

39:47.460 --> 39:51.820
 Yeah, I was just watching his video this morning before I came here.

39:51.820 --> 39:52.820
 Yeah.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.700
 Are you impressed at where things stand today?

39:54.700 --> 39:55.700
 Yeah.

39:55.700 --> 40:03.660
 I mean, SpaceX in particular has done things that are just unbelievable.

40:03.660 --> 40:12.100
 And I don't think anyone was anticipating 20 years ago, let's say, when this all started,

40:12.100 --> 40:19.260
 just the speed with which they'd be able to rack up these incredible achievements.

40:19.260 --> 40:26.520
 If you've kind of even seen a little bit of how the sausage is made and so the difficulty

40:26.520 --> 40:36.820
 of doing any kind of space travel, what they've achieved is just unbelievable.

40:36.820 --> 40:40.980
 What about maybe a question about Elon Musk?

40:40.980 --> 40:50.140
 Even more than Jeff Bezos, he has a very kind of ambitious vision of this project that we're

40:50.140 --> 40:58.140
 on as a species, of becoming a multi planetary species and becoming that quickly, as soon

40:58.140 --> 41:01.300
 as possible, landing on Mars, colonizing Mars.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.100
 What do you think of that project?

41:03.100 --> 41:04.100
 There's two questions to ask.

41:04.100 --> 41:09.060
 First, the question is, what do you think about the project of colonizing Mars?

41:09.060 --> 41:19.420
 And second, what do you think about a human being who is so unapologetically ambitious

41:19.420 --> 41:23.420
 at achieving the impossible, what a lot of people would say is impossible?

41:23.420 --> 41:32.580
 I think that colonizing Mars is the kind of goal that's easily stated.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.340
 It's catchy.

41:34.340 --> 41:41.020
 It's the kind of thing that can inspire people to get involved in a way that some other programs

41:41.020 --> 41:42.020
 might not.

41:42.020 --> 41:45.740
 So I think it's well chosen in that way.

41:45.740 --> 41:54.260
 I have technical questions about, there's a problem of perchlorates on the surface of

41:54.260 --> 41:58.060
 Mars that's going to be big trouble.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.540
 And there's radiation.

42:00.540 --> 42:04.060
 This is known.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.460
 What about business questions?

42:05.460 --> 42:12.140
 Do you think, because you mentioned sort of going outside of the solar system would best

42:12.140 --> 42:15.620
 be done for religious reasons.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.820
 What about colonizing Mars?

42:17.820 --> 42:20.460
 Can you spin it into a business proposition?

42:20.460 --> 42:27.660
 It's hard to think of a resource that's on Mars that could be brought back here cheaply

42:27.660 --> 42:37.020
 enough to compete with stuff we could just dig out of the ground here or grow here.

42:37.020 --> 42:42.480
 So I don't know if there is a business plan for that or if it's just strictly we're going

42:42.480 --> 42:49.140
 to go there and see what happens.

42:49.140 --> 42:55.860
 Maybe again we need communism to get us going, to give us a reason, a little bit of the competition.

42:55.860 --> 43:02.180
 Well there's plenty of people who are sufficiently excited by the colonize Mars vision that they're

43:02.180 --> 43:12.180
 willing to just go all in on it, even if there's not a business plan behind it.

43:12.180 --> 43:17.540
 But I think it's well chosen.

43:17.540 --> 43:23.620
 I think it's probably the only approach to take.

43:23.620 --> 43:32.340
 A lot of the, when white people came to this continent and started colonizing it, there

43:32.340 --> 43:35.620
 was not a lot of coherent planning.

43:35.620 --> 43:40.860
 What plans they did have turned out to be terrible plans.

43:40.860 --> 43:47.660
 Trying to come up with plans that extend decades into the future is a waste of time.

43:47.660 --> 43:58.700
 So do it for the kind of unexplainable love of the unknown, like the journey towards exploring

43:58.700 --> 44:03.100
 the unknown and just kind of keep going.

44:03.100 --> 44:10.380
 You saw it with Shatner and his reaction to the flight yesterday.

44:10.380 --> 44:20.060
 He, for him that trip was more than worth it just for these intangible reasons.

44:20.060 --> 44:21.060
 What did he say?

44:21.060 --> 44:22.180
 I haven't watched the video yet.

44:22.180 --> 44:28.700
 He was trying to express, talking a lot about the moment where suddenly you kind of rise

44:28.700 --> 44:37.340
 above the thin blue blanket of the atmosphere and you're up into the blackness.

44:37.340 --> 44:41.060
 And that had a huge impact on him.

44:41.060 --> 44:45.860
 So he was kind of, I wouldn't say groping for words because he was pretty eloquent,

44:45.860 --> 44:52.980
 but he was trying to express his feelings about that in a way that is pretty gripping

44:52.980 --> 44:55.980
 to watch.

44:55.980 --> 45:00.660
 So you worked on this kind of stuff, we can go back 10 years ago.

45:00.660 --> 45:03.980
 You wrote an essay called Innovation Starvation.

45:03.980 --> 45:13.300
 You worked on this kind of idea since then, kind of looking at maybe a little bit cynically

45:13.300 --> 45:19.980
 about our age today and our unwillingness to take on big risky projects.

45:19.980 --> 45:23.540
 So in the face of that, what do you think of people like Elon Musk?

45:23.540 --> 45:31.620
 Because to me, people like that are inspiring and gives you hope in the face of a more kind

45:31.620 --> 45:36.300
 of pessimistic perspective of our age.

45:36.300 --> 45:45.900
 Yeah, well he's clearly willing to tackle big ambitious projects without a lot of kind

45:45.900 --> 45:52.540
 of soul searching or trying to make up his mind, right?

45:52.540 --> 45:58.020
 It's just like, let's dig tunnels under cities.

45:58.020 --> 45:59.020
 Go.

45:59.020 --> 46:02.620
 Step one, make a joke about it on Twitter.

46:02.620 --> 46:04.820
 Step two, actually do it.

46:04.820 --> 46:05.820
 Yeah.

46:05.820 --> 46:06.820
 Yeah.

46:06.820 --> 46:09.740
 And I mean, things have slowed down quite a bit.

46:09.740 --> 46:19.780
 Our ability to build things at pace is a lot less than it was, and there's reasons for

46:19.780 --> 46:20.780
 that.

46:20.780 --> 46:26.700
 We're more concerned with safety and environmental impacts than people were when they were building

46:26.700 --> 46:32.540
 some of the great Publixworks projects of the mid 20th century.

46:32.540 --> 46:36.880
 But we're at the point now where even just maintaining the stuff that we've got is such

46:36.880 --> 46:45.420
 a huge project that we need to put big resources into it and good minds into it, or else we're

46:45.420 --> 46:52.300
 going to be losing things that we take for granted.

46:52.300 --> 46:57.020
 Do you think that there's a lot to be done in the digital space?

46:57.020 --> 47:02.300
 You mentioned sort of Wikipedia and knowledge, don't you think there could be a lot of flourishing

47:02.300 --> 47:06.700
 in the space of innovation, in terms of innovation in the digital space?

47:06.700 --> 47:08.860
 Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see that.

47:08.860 --> 47:16.880
 I think it's where a lot of the brainpower went during the last couple of generations,

47:16.880 --> 47:24.700
 because people who might previously have been building rockets or other kinds of hard technologies

47:24.700 --> 47:33.620
 ended up instead going into programming, computer science, which is understandable and great.

47:33.620 --> 47:38.580
 We've got structural problems right now in the way social media works that are pretty

47:38.580 --> 47:46.060
 severe, and so I certainly hope that we're not, 10 years from now, that we're not exactly

47:46.060 --> 47:49.740
 where we are today when it comes to that stuff.

47:49.740 --> 47:51.780
 We need to move on.

47:51.780 --> 47:59.180
 The beautiful thing about problems is they show you how not to do things, and they give

47:59.180 --> 48:07.660
 opportunity to new ideas to flourish and to beat out the ideas of the old, which is a

48:07.660 --> 48:15.700
 dream for me to see new social media that beats out the ways of the old.

48:15.700 --> 48:21.700
 So I tend to, you perhaps agree that it's not, that it's impossible to do social media

48:21.700 --> 48:22.700
 well.

48:22.700 --> 48:23.700
 Oh, not at all.

48:23.700 --> 48:28.300
 I mean, I listened to your interview with Jaren a couple of weeks ago, and I know Jaren,

48:28.300 --> 48:31.520
 and we've talked about this.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.800
 He went hard on me.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.220
 He basically said, like, it's impossible.

48:35.220 --> 48:36.860
 It was very nice.

48:36.860 --> 48:42.600
 Well, the last time I kind of paid attention to Jaren's thoughts on it, he was thinking

48:42.600 --> 48:50.940
 in terms of that basically there should be micro payments such that if I, by clicking

48:50.940 --> 49:01.020
 the like button on something, I'm essentially giving valuable intellectual property to Facebook

49:01.020 --> 49:03.220
 or Twitter or whatever.

49:03.220 --> 49:08.980
 It's not a very large amount of IP, but it's definitely a transfer of information that

49:08.980 --> 49:12.060
 when they aggregate it is beneficial to them.

49:12.060 --> 49:20.980
 So and now I do remember that he, on his interview with you, was talking about what, data unions

49:20.980 --> 49:21.980
 or?

49:21.980 --> 49:22.980
 Yeah.

49:22.980 --> 49:28.780
 Those are a lot of interesting ideas, but for me, the biggest disagreement was in the

49:28.780 --> 49:30.880
 level of cynicism.

49:30.880 --> 49:36.820
 He has a distrust and cynicism towards people in Silicon Valley being able to do these kinds

49:36.820 --> 49:38.140
 of things.

49:38.140 --> 49:43.940
 And I'm really, okay, when you have a large crowd of people that are doing things the

49:43.940 --> 49:50.860
 wrong way, you should nevertheless maintain optimism because what's important is to find

49:50.860 --> 49:54.100
 the one person in that room that's going to do things the right way.

49:54.100 --> 49:57.780
 Cynicism is going to completely silence out the whole room.

49:57.780 --> 50:00.740
 So he was saying, I've been here a long time.

50:00.740 --> 50:01.740
 Oh yeah.

50:01.740 --> 50:09.060
 I've known, you know, I understand like how these folks work, they think they're gods

50:09.060 --> 50:15.340
 and they know the right way to do things and they will tell you how to do those things.

50:15.340 --> 50:20.460
 And that kind of hubris is going to always lead you astray when you are the one who's

50:20.460 --> 50:22.820
 engineering the algorithms.

50:22.820 --> 50:27.620
 And there's a lot of deep truth to that because algorithms are powerful.

50:27.620 --> 50:32.820
 And many people when given power do not do the best of things.

50:32.820 --> 50:38.620
 I mean, most, what is it, the old Lincoln line, if you want to test the man's character,

50:38.620 --> 50:39.620
 give him power.

50:39.620 --> 50:40.620
 Yeah.

50:40.620 --> 50:41.620
 Yes.

50:41.620 --> 50:46.100
 But that doesn't mean that some people are not able to handle the power, that some people

50:46.100 --> 50:51.020
 are not able to come up with good ideas that create better social media.

50:51.020 --> 50:58.060
 Yeah, I didn't interpret Jaren's statements as being entirely cynical and hopeless.

50:58.060 --> 51:03.540
 He's definitely raising, you know, issues of concern.

51:03.540 --> 51:07.220
 But he wouldn't be out, you know, writing the books that he's written and talking about

51:07.220 --> 51:09.500
 this stuff if he didn't think there was a way.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.460
 If he didn't think there was hope, yeah.

51:11.460 --> 51:15.380
 And part of it, as you probably know with Jaren, he just loves a good argument.

51:15.380 --> 51:16.380
 Yeah.

51:16.380 --> 51:19.740
 He just loves to have a little bit of fun.

51:19.740 --> 51:27.780
 Well I have to ask you about, I mean, we talked about taking all big, bold, risky ideas.

51:27.780 --> 51:33.100
 So in your new book, Termination Shock, it's set here in Texas.

51:33.100 --> 51:34.100
 Part of it is, yeah.

51:34.100 --> 51:35.100
 Yeah.

51:35.100 --> 51:36.100
 Most of it.

51:36.100 --> 51:37.100
 Yeah.

51:37.100 --> 51:38.100
 It's a great place to set it.

51:38.100 --> 51:43.460
 So in it, the main character, TR McCooligan, a Texas billionaire oil man and truck stop

51:43.460 --> 51:48.460
 magnate, decides to solve climate change, to take on climate change by himself.

51:48.460 --> 51:54.580
 So this is an interesting philosophical exploration of how to solve climate change from a perspective

51:54.580 --> 51:57.740
 that's perhaps different than we've been thinking about.

51:57.740 --> 52:04.980
 I wouldn't use the word solve, but let's say ameliorate the temporary effects.

52:04.980 --> 52:05.980
 But please.

52:05.980 --> 52:06.980
 Take on.

52:06.980 --> 52:07.980
 Yeah.

52:07.980 --> 52:08.980
 Take on the challenge.

52:08.980 --> 52:15.380
 So it's very interesting, but as, so there's a gradual nature to this process.

52:15.380 --> 52:28.340
 And I mean, just like in your book, the power of innovation is something that has saved

52:28.340 --> 52:30.900
 us quite a few times in history.

52:30.900 --> 52:34.620
 So what role does that play in this gradual process?

52:34.620 --> 52:35.620
 Right.

52:35.620 --> 52:43.900
 So ultimately we don't solve the problem until we get the CO2 out of the atmosphere.

52:43.900 --> 52:46.940
 But that is going to take a while.

52:46.940 --> 52:49.080
 We're still adding more.

52:49.080 --> 52:52.500
 We haven't even started to reduce the amount.

52:52.500 --> 52:58.920
 So there's two possibilities inside to interrupt is reduce the amount that we're putting in

52:58.920 --> 53:03.700
 the atmosphere and two is removing what we got in the atmosphere.

53:03.700 --> 53:04.700
 We have to do both.

53:04.700 --> 53:05.700
 Right.

53:05.700 --> 53:11.020
 And those are two different kind of efforts in terms of like what's involved.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.600
 Because it stays up there.

53:12.600 --> 53:19.140
 So I think just last week, China announced that they're going to try to level off their

53:19.140 --> 53:23.380
 CO2 emissions in like 2030.

53:23.380 --> 53:30.500
 So 2031, they'll only put as much CO2 into the atmosphere as they did in 2030, which

53:30.500 --> 53:36.820
 is still a lot of CO2 in 2060, they're saying will be net zero.

53:36.820 --> 53:42.780
 So if everyone in the world does that and the PPM of CO2 in the atmosphere by then is

53:42.780 --> 53:51.860
 say 450 parts per million, it'll stay at 450 parts per million until we take it out.

53:51.860 --> 53:54.820
 And taking it out is hard.

53:54.820 --> 53:58.340
 It's a big, it took us a long time.

53:58.340 --> 54:04.260
 We had to empty out huge coal mines and oil reservoirs and burn all that stuff.

54:04.260 --> 54:11.380
 We had to chop down forests and dig up peat bogs in order to create all of that CO2.

54:11.380 --> 54:19.660
 And so we have to reverse all of those processes somehow in order to remove the CO2 and get

54:19.660 --> 54:26.420
 it back down, hopefully into the 200 and some parts per million range where it used to be.

54:26.420 --> 54:32.320
 So how about you get a single Texas billionaire to have a massive gun that blasts huge quantities

54:32.320 --> 54:35.660
 of sulfur into the upper atmosphere.

54:35.660 --> 54:38.320
 That's idea number one.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.700
 This is called solar geoengineering.

54:40.700 --> 54:46.540
 And it's a, we know that it's a possibility on a technical level because volcanoes have

54:46.540 --> 54:49.060
 been doing it forever.

54:49.060 --> 54:55.240
 So many times in human history, we've seen a volcanic eruption that was followed by a

54:55.240 --> 54:59.120
 global cooling trend that lasted for a couple of years.

54:59.120 --> 55:06.420
 And one of these things happened I think in the 60s or 70s in Indonesia and the Australians

55:06.420 --> 55:11.780
 sent a plane up into the stratosphere to take some samples of the plume.

55:11.780 --> 55:17.700
 And when it came back down, the windscreen of the plane had sort of a deposit on it.

55:17.700 --> 55:26.260
 So one of the Australian scientists licked it and reported that it was painfully acid.

55:26.260 --> 55:31.940
 So that was our first kind of clue that what was being injected into the stratosphere was

55:31.940 --> 55:37.260
 sulfur dioxide.

55:37.260 --> 55:43.140
 And so we know then Pinatubo came along in the 90s and did this experiment for us.

55:43.140 --> 55:50.580
 So we know that sulfur in the stratosphere, it forms little spherical droplets of sulfuric

55:50.580 --> 55:58.100
 acid after it combines with water and those bounce back some of the sun's rays and reduce

55:58.100 --> 56:05.940
 the amount of solar energy entering the troposphere, which is where we live.

56:05.940 --> 56:10.820
 So we know that it works and we also know that the stuff goes away after a couple of

56:10.820 --> 56:12.380
 years.

56:12.380 --> 56:14.300
 So it gradually washes out.

56:14.300 --> 56:16.500
 And so it's not a permanent thing.

56:16.500 --> 56:22.620
 The good news, bad news is it's not permanent.

56:22.620 --> 56:28.220
 So if you don't like what's happening, you can just stop and wait a couple of years and

56:28.220 --> 56:31.260
 you'll get back to where you started.

56:31.260 --> 56:35.180
 The bad news if you're in favor of this kind of thing is that you have to keep doing it

56:35.180 --> 56:39.960
 forever.

56:39.960 --> 56:46.460
 So this guy is one of those, he's read these papers, the TR, the character in the book.

56:46.460 --> 56:54.020
 He knows all this and all people who are familiar with climate science kind of know this.

56:54.020 --> 56:57.100
 It's a pretty well established fact.

56:57.100 --> 57:05.780
 And so he just decides he's going to take action unilaterally and do this.

57:05.780 --> 57:11.220
 And so there's different ways to get the sulfur up there, but because it's Texas, he builds

57:11.220 --> 57:13.460
 the biggest gun in the world.

57:13.460 --> 57:18.900
 It's just six barrels pointed straight up and he begins firing shells loaded with sulfur

57:18.900 --> 57:20.420
 into the stratosphere.

57:20.420 --> 57:26.780
 And so the book is about not so much that as how people react to his doing that, what

57:26.780 --> 57:34.020
 the political ramifications are around the world because this is an extremely controversial

57:34.020 --> 57:37.820
 idea and not everyone's on board with it.

57:37.820 --> 57:45.460
 And even if you are willing to consider using a technological intervention, the fact is

57:45.460 --> 57:49.420
 that it's going to have different effects on different parts of the world.

57:49.420 --> 57:59.060
 So some areas may suffer more negatives than positives and they're not going to be happy.

57:59.060 --> 58:07.820
 So what do you think, so in his case, in TR's case, he can get around getting permission

58:07.820 --> 58:10.940
 from governments.

58:10.940 --> 58:19.340
 If we were to look at us facing outside of the story, us facing climate change, where

58:19.340 --> 58:21.020
 do you think the solution will come from?

58:21.020 --> 58:28.980
 Governments working together or from bold billionaire Texans?

58:28.980 --> 58:38.420
 I'm pretty sure that this kind of intervention is never going to emerge from Western democracies.

58:38.420 --> 58:42.940
 This kind of, sorry, government coordinated, which option one?

58:42.940 --> 58:43.940
 Solar geoengineering.

58:43.940 --> 58:44.940
 Solar geoengineering.

58:44.940 --> 58:45.940
 Yeah.

58:45.940 --> 58:51.740
 From a government, from a, like those are, I want to sort of the distinction, one is

58:51.740 --> 58:57.460
 the idea, the technological idea you're talking about, but two is like who comes up with the

58:57.460 --> 59:00.740
 idea and agrees on it, governments or individuals.

59:00.740 --> 59:01.740
 Yeah.

59:01.740 --> 59:07.220
 If this were to happen, I think it would be either an individual or more likely just some

59:07.220 --> 59:15.700
 government somewhere that just decides it's in their interests to unilaterally do this.

59:15.700 --> 59:24.240
 And you know, that's not me advocating it, it's just, it would be comparatively so cheap

59:24.240 --> 59:31.660
 and easy to implement a solar geoengineering scheme that someone is probably going to do

59:31.660 --> 59:34.740
 it once things get bad enough.

59:34.740 --> 59:39.980
 But I don't think that governments will, or Western governments, just because they're

59:39.980 --> 59:45.500
 not, well, we've seen what happened with vaccines, right?

59:45.500 --> 59:54.060
 So getting people to take vaccinations or wear masks, you know, has turned out to be

59:54.060 --> 59:59.500
 incredibly hard, even though it might save those people's lives.

59:59.500 --> 1:00:07.140
 See, I blame, that's not Western, that's, I blame failure of leadership there, of leaders

1:00:07.140 --> 1:00:13.180
 being not coming off as authentic, not being inspiring, uniting, all those kinds of things.

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:14.180
 I think that's possible.

1:00:14.180 --> 1:00:20.220
 I think it's just that we've gotten, the leaders we have right now aren't the right people

1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:24.860
 because we've lived through kind of a long stretch of relatively comfortable times.

1:00:24.860 --> 1:00:31.020
 And it feels like unfortunate if you just look at history, that hard times made great

1:00:31.020 --> 1:00:40.060
 leaders and easy times make like bureaucrats that are egotistical and greedy and not very

1:00:40.060 --> 1:00:41.700
 interesting and not very bold.

1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:42.700
 Yeah.

1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:43.700
 No, I think that's fair.

1:00:43.700 --> 1:00:48.820
 So, you know, we may be entering one of those interesting times, you know, in the Chinese

1:00:48.820 --> 1:00:53.380
 curse sense, yeah.

1:00:53.380 --> 1:01:00.620
 So I could be wrong, but I mean, there've been some efforts to explore solar geoengineering.

1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:08.780
 There was a plan to send up some balloons, high altitude balloons to take some measurements

1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:17.620
 in Scandinavia that got squashed by objections from people who lived up there who were just

1:01:17.620 --> 1:01:22.500
 opposed to the whole program on principle.

1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:24.860
 So we'll see a lot more of that.

1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:31.380
 And it's going to be a hard program to advocate for just because I think people don't quite

1:01:31.380 --> 1:01:40.020
 understand how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere and how far we are from even slowing

1:01:40.020 --> 1:01:48.180
 down the rate that we're adding more to say nothing of bringing that number down.

1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:50.580
 We're a long way out from that.

1:01:50.580 --> 1:01:55.740
 Do you see in terms of portfolio of solutions, us becoming a multi planetary species as part

1:01:55.740 --> 1:01:57.340
 of that?

1:01:57.340 --> 1:02:05.820
 Is this also being a motivator for investing some percent of GDP into becoming a multi

1:02:05.820 --> 1:02:06.820
 planetary species?

1:02:06.820 --> 1:02:09.300
 And what percent should that be, you think?

1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:11.500
 You know, in an indirect way, maybe.

1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:16.940
 I mean, you know what people will say, which is the same argument that has been leveled

1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:22.620
 against space exploration since the Apollo program, which is why don't we solve our problems

1:02:22.620 --> 1:02:27.800
 here on Earth before we spend money going into space.

1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:32.220
 So I've never been a believer in that argument.

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:42.900
 I think there could be a sense in which the new perspective that could be obtained by

1:02:42.900 --> 1:02:49.100
 thinking about like if we're thinking about terraforming Mars, changing its atmosphere,

1:02:49.100 --> 1:02:55.060
 making it more amenable to life and survival.

1:02:55.060 --> 1:03:00.940
 You could see that maybe changing people's opinions about terraforming the Earth.

1:03:00.940 --> 1:03:12.540
 There are some dangerous consequences to this particular idea of blasting software of geoengineering.

1:03:12.540 --> 1:03:18.780
 What do you make of sort of big, bold ideas that are a double edged sword?

1:03:18.780 --> 1:03:29.060
 Are all ideas like this, all big ideas like this, they have the potential to have highly

1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:34.180
 beneficial consequences and a potential to have highly destructive consequences?

1:03:34.180 --> 1:03:35.340
 I wouldn't say all.

1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:41.460
 I think, you know, going back to what we were talking about earlier, how technology developed

1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:48.240
 in the 50s and 60s, there was a period of time there when people maybe had unrealistic

1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:57.420
 ideas about new technology and weren't sufficiently attentive to the possible downsides.

1:03:57.420 --> 1:04:08.540
 So we got, and there's a reason why, I mean, in the mid 20th century, we saw antibiotics,

1:04:08.540 --> 1:04:18.340
 we saw the polio vaccine, we saw just simple things like refrigerators in the home.

1:04:18.340 --> 1:04:23.780
 My grandmother to her dying day called the refrigerator the ice box because when she

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:26.940
 grew up, it was a box with ice in it.

1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:31.420
 So you see all that change and it's largely for the benefit of people.

1:04:31.420 --> 1:04:37.820
 And so if somebody comes along and says, hey, we're going to build nuclear reactors to make

1:04:37.820 --> 1:04:48.140
 energy or here's a new chemical called DDT that's going to kill mosquitoes, then it's

1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:55.580
 easy to just buy into that and not be alert to the possible downsides.

1:04:55.580 --> 1:05:02.620
 And of course, we know that the way that those early reactors were built and the way that

1:05:02.620 --> 1:05:13.180
 the supply chain was built to create the fuel and deal with the waste was poorly thought

1:05:13.180 --> 1:05:22.280
 out and we're still dealing with the resulting problems at places like Hanford in the state

1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:23.340
 of Washington.

1:05:23.340 --> 1:05:30.220
 And we know that DDT, although it did kill a lot of insects, also had terrible effects

1:05:30.220 --> 1:05:32.980
 on bird populations.

1:05:32.980 --> 1:05:40.460
 So the kind of backlash that happened in the 70s that is still kind of going on is to sort

1:05:40.460 --> 1:05:49.900
 of assume that everything is a double edged sword and always to look for, we have to absolutely

1:05:49.900 --> 1:05:57.940
 convince ourselves that the downside isn't going to come back and bite us before we can

1:05:57.940 --> 1:06:00.700
 adopt any new technology.

1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:09.380
 And I think the people are overly sensitized to that now.

1:06:09.380 --> 1:06:16.820
 Yeah, it's funny, depending on the technology, people are a little bit too terrified of certain

1:06:16.820 --> 1:06:20.380
 technologies, like artificial intelligence is one.

1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:27.580
 My sense is that the things that they're afraid of aren't the things that are likely going

1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:30.300
 to happen in terms of negative things.

1:06:30.300 --> 1:06:36.100
 It's probably impossible to predict exactly the unintended negative consequences.

1:06:36.100 --> 1:06:42.540
 But what's also interesting is for AI as an example, people don't think enough about the

1:06:42.540 --> 1:06:43.540
 positive things.

1:06:43.540 --> 1:06:45.540
 I mean, the same is true with social media.

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:50.220
 It's very popular now, for some reason, to talk about all the negative effects of social

1:06:50.220 --> 1:06:51.220
 media.

1:06:51.220 --> 1:06:59.820
 We've immediately forgotten how incredible it is to connect across the world.

1:06:59.820 --> 1:07:04.300
 There's a deep loneliness within all of us, we long to connect and social media, at least

1:07:04.300 --> 1:07:08.940
 in part, enables that even in its current state.

1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:15.240
 And all the negative things we see with social media currently are also in part just revealing

1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:16.620
 the basics of human nature.

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:20.180
 It didn't make us worse, it's just bringing it to the surface.

1:07:20.180 --> 1:07:23.220
 And step one of solving a problem is bringing it to the surface.

1:07:23.220 --> 1:07:31.300
 The fact that there's a division, the fact that we're easily angered and upset and all

1:07:31.300 --> 1:07:35.500
 of that, the witch hunts, all those kinds of things, that's human nature and it just

1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:40.880
 reveals that allowing us to now work on it, it's therapy.

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:47.940
 And so that's another example of a technology that's just, we're not considering the positive

1:07:47.940 --> 1:07:51.340
 effects now and in the future enough of.

1:07:51.340 --> 1:07:56.340
 I have to ask you about, there's a million things I can ask you about, but virtual reality,

1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:59.940
 I gotta ask you.

1:07:59.940 --> 1:08:05.900
 You've thought about virtual reality, mixed reality quite a bit.

1:08:05.900 --> 1:08:11.380
 What are the interesting trajectories you see for the proliferation of virtual reality

1:08:11.380 --> 1:08:13.380
 or mixed reality in the next few years?

1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:19.460
 Yeah, so I was at Magic Leap for, what, five years.

1:08:19.460 --> 1:08:21.540
 With the best title of all time.

1:08:21.540 --> 1:08:22.540
 Oh, thanks.

1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:23.540
 Chief Futurist?

1:08:23.540 --> 1:08:24.540
 Yeah.

1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:25.540
 Yeah.

1:08:25.540 --> 1:08:32.780
 And so I sort of had a little squad of people in Seattle doing what you might call content

1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:43.180
 R&D, so we're trying to make content for AR, but because it's such a new medium, it's more

1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:48.620
 of an engineering R&D project almost than a creative project.

1:08:48.620 --> 1:09:00.720
 So it was fascinating to see everything that goes into making an AR system that runs.

1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:09.940
 So AR, an AR device, if it's really gonna do AR, needs to be running Slam in real time.

1:09:09.940 --> 1:09:11.940
 And that alone is a big...

1:09:11.940 --> 1:09:18.360
 So for people who don't know, first of all, virtual reality is creating an almost fully

1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:21.100
 artificial world and putting you inside it.

1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:29.160
 Augmented reality, AR, is taking the real world and putting stuff on top of that real

1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:33.660
 world, and when you say Slam, that means in real time, the device needs to be able to

1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:41.640
 sense, accurately detect everything about that world sufficiently to be able to reconstruct

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:47.200
 the 3D structure of it so you can put stuff on top of it.

1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:53.100
 And doing that in real time, presumably not just real time, but in a way that creates

1:09:53.100 --> 1:10:00.900
 a pleasant experience for the human perception system is, yeah, that's an engineering project.

1:10:00.900 --> 1:10:01.900
 Right.

1:10:01.900 --> 1:10:07.640
 Yeah, well said, and it's just one of the things that the system has to do.

1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:13.460
 It's also tracking your eyes so it knows what you're looking at, how far away what you're

1:10:13.460 --> 1:10:18.760
 looking at is.

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:26.060
 It's performing all those functions, and it's got to keep doing that without burning up

1:10:26.060 --> 1:10:35.640
 the CPU or depleting the battery unreasonably fast, and that's just table stakes.

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:41.340
 It's just the basic functions of the operating system, and then any content that you want

1:10:41.340 --> 1:10:43.960
 to add has to sit on top of that.

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:51.160
 It's got to be rendered by the optics at a sufficiently low latency that it looks real

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:52.520
 and you don't get sick.

1:10:52.520 --> 1:11:02.600
 So it's an amazing thing, and a magically shipped device that can do that in 2019.

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:08.360
 And they're about to ship the ML2, but I don't know any more about that than anyone else

1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:12.600
 because I don't work there anymore.

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:19.000
 Does it still, to some degree, boil down to a killer app, a content question?

1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.560
 Like you said, it's kind of a wide open space.

1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:25.320
 Nobody knows exactly what's going to be the compelling thing.

1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:33.960
 So doesn't a super compelling experience of some sort alleviate some of the need for engineering

1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:34.960
 perfection?

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:41.760
 Well, there's a base layer of engineering that you have to have no matter what, but

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:47.400
 you're certainly right that people, like in the early days of video games, put up with

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:53.080
 kind of low frame rate and what we would now call crappy graphics because they were having

1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:56.240
 so much fun playing Doom or whatever.

1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:57.240
 Even Tetris.

1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.720
 Yeah, yeah.

1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:01.620
 So for sure that's true.

1:12:01.620 --> 1:12:13.600
 And so I was working on consumer facing content, there was a great team in Wellington, New

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:26.880
 Zealand that made a game called Dr. Groydbrod's Invaders that realized the potential of AR

1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:33.440
 gaming in a way that I don't think anything else has before or since.

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:43.640
 And so that was definitely the strategy until, what, April 2020, which is when the company

1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:53.320
 decided to pivot to commercial industrial applications instead.

1:12:53.320 --> 1:13:02.120
 And I haven't seen their financial projections, but I assume they had good reasons for making

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.920
 that strategic decision.

1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:13.040
 It just means that it's no longer necessarily targeted at just end users who want to play

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:17.080
 a game or be entertained.

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:24.080
 That to me from a dreamer, futurist perspective is heartbreaking because I don't know necessarily

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:33.960
 from in the VR space, but I see this kind of thing with robotics where to me the future

1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:42.880
 of robotics is consumer facing and a lot of great roboticists, Boston Dynamics and companies

1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:50.360
 like that are focused on sort of industrial applications for financial business reasons.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:51.360
 Yeah.

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:54.000
 Now I can see the parallels for sure.

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000
 We'll see.

1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:00.560
 It was a fun project.

1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:06.660
 We worked on an app, for example, called Baby Goats, which just populated your room with

1:14:06.660 --> 1:14:07.660
 baby goats.

1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:09.520
 That seemed like a killer app right there.

1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:14.680
 No, we thought highly of the idea for sure.

1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:22.860
 But because of the SLAM, the system knew, for example, here's a table, here's a little

1:14:22.860 --> 1:14:24.280
 end table.

1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:26.280
 We know the heights.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:33.100
 We know how high our animated baby goat can jump.

1:14:33.100 --> 1:14:40.000
 So our engineers had to build a system for converting the SLAM primitives into game engine

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:49.760
 objects that the AIs in the game could navigate around.

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:56.320
 And that ended up shipping as more of a dev kit or a sort of how to a sample app than

1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:00.320
 as a finished consumer facing.

1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:04.280
 You mean the baby goat AI?

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:10.800
 That seems to me like a world I could entertain myself for hours, just every day coming home

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:13.800
 to see baby goats.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:14.800
 Yeah.

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.680
 I mean, it was an ambient kind of...

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:21.360
 It's not a thing that you would sit there and play like a video.

1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:22.360
 Just life.

1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:23.360
 Yeah.

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:24.360
 Yeah.

1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:25.360
 But now there's baby goats.

1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:29.120
 I mean, what's the purpose of having dogs and cats in your life exactly?

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:30.840
 It's kind of ambient.

1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:34.780
 They're not really helping you do anything, but it's enriching your life.

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:42.440
 You can go and play fetch or something for a while if you want, but you don't have to.

1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:48.160
 So we worked on that in a bigger project that was more of a storytelling in a fictional

1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:50.680
 universe.

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:52.460
 The hardware is worth a look.

1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:57.680
 There's still a belief, I just saw it this morning looking at Twitter, that the Magic

1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:00.680
 League never shipped anything.

1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:07.840
 But they've been, since 2019, you can go to their website and buy one of these devices

1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:11.120
 anytime you want to spend the money.

1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:12.120
 Yeah.

1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:17.800
 And the new one is coming out, I think in 2022, so in a few months.

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:24.400
 What do you think, looking out 50 years from now, what wins?

1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:30.600
 Virtual reality, augmented reality, or physical reality?

1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:32.240
 What wins?

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:41.640
 Meaning like, what do people that have financial resources enjoy spending most of their time

1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:43.280
 in?

1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:49.840
 I've always been a fan of AR and it's kind of an easy answer because if you're wearing

1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:56.800
 an AR device and you put a bag over your head, it becomes a VR device.

1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:03.800
 If you block out what's really there, then all you're seeing is a VR.

1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:11.320
 But you are, with AR, constrained to kind of operate in something that's similar to

1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:12.320
 physical reality.

1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:13.320
 Yeah.

1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:15.760
 With VR, you can go into fantastical worlds.

1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:16.760
 True.

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:17.760
 True.

1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:29.080
 But there are still issues in those fantastical worlds with motion sickness.

1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:37.760
 If your body is experiencing acceleration, your inner ear, that differs from what your

1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:43.440
 eye thinks it's seeing, then you'll get sick, unless you're a very unusual person.

1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:51.240
 So it doesn't mean you can't do it, it's just a constraint that VR designers have to learn

1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:52.240
 to work with.

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:59.520
 So do you think it's possible that in the future, we're living mostly in a virtual reality

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:00.520
 world?

1:18:00.520 --> 1:18:04.580
 Like, we become more and more detached from physical reality?

1:18:04.580 --> 1:18:12.400
 For entertainment, maybe, for certain applications, I'm personally more, I mean, we have to make

1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:17.920
 a distinction between what I would personally find interesting and what might win in the

1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:18.920
 market.

1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:24.040
 So maybe some people, maybe lots of people, would like to spend a huge amount of time

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.680
 in VR.

1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:33.880
 I'm personally more interested in enhancing the experience that I have of the physical

1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:37.120
 world, because the physical world's pretty cool, right?

1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:42.440
 There's a lot to be said for moving around in the real world.

1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:49.400
 And I ask you for you personally, to try to play devil's advocate, or to try to construct,

1:18:49.400 --> 1:19:00.700
 to imagine a VR world where you and Neal Stephenson wouldn't want to stay.

1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:04.640
 Not because the physical world all of a sudden became really bad, for some reason, like you're

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:06.120
 trying to escape it.

1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:10.720
 Like, literally, it's just more enriching.

1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:15.600
 In the same way, like, there's a glimmer in your eye when you said you enjoy the physical

1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:16.600
 world.

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:21.360
 Like, double up on that glimmer for the virtual reality.

1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:23.240
 Can you imagine such a world?

1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:30.940
 Well, like, I'll give maybe an example that's a bridge, which is that I like making things.

1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:37.860
 So I like working in a machine shop and making objects with 3D printers or machines or whatever.

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:45.160
 And so I've had to learn how to get good at using a CAD program.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:46.880
 There's many to choose from.

1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:51.160
 I use one called Fusion 360.

1:19:51.160 --> 1:20:01.540
 And I can spend hours in that trying to create, imagine and create the things I want to create.

1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:11.160
 And it's not virtual reality exactly, but that whole time, my whole field of view is

1:20:11.160 --> 1:20:18.080
 occupied by this monitor that's showing me a window into a three dimensional space.

1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:20.400
 I'm rotating things around.

1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:22.960
 I'm imagining things.

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:23.960
 I'm making things.

1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:31.320
 And so that is pretty close to being in virtual reality.

1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:34.640
 Does that thing have to exist for you to experience true joy?

1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:38.000
 Can you stay in Fusion 360 the whole time?

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.560
 Do you have to 3D print it and touch it?

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:44.500
 Yeah, I mean, that's my game.

1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:45.920
 That's what I'm up to.

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:54.280
 But it happens that if you're building a virtual environment, if you're making a game level

1:20:54.280 --> 1:21:00.000
 or creating a virtual set for a film or TV production, the thing that you're designing

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:04.560
 in the program may never physically exist.

1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:11.840
 And in fact, it's preferable that it doesn't because the whole point of that is to make

1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:17.940
 imaginary things that you couldn't build otherwise.

1:21:17.940 --> 1:21:22.880
 So I think lots of people spend a good chunk of their working hours in something that's

1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:25.840
 pretty close to VR.

1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:30.360
 It's just that currently the output device happens to be a rectangular object in front

1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:31.860
 of them.

1:21:31.860 --> 1:21:39.040
 You could replace that with a VR headset and they'd be doing the same stuff.

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:40.040
 There's all kinds of interfaces.

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:44.080
 For example, I enjoy listening to podcasts or audiobooks, but let's say actually podcasts

1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:49.080
 because there's an intimate human connection in a podcast.

1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:50.080
 It's one way.

1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:54.320
 But you get to learn about the person you're listening to and that's a real connection

1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:55.320
 and that's just audio.

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:58.240
 For a lot of people, that's just audio.

1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:05.880
 And for me, that's just audio as a fan of people and you kind of a little bit are friends

1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:06.880
 with those people.

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:11.000
 Yeah, they're in your life, you're listening to them, yeah.

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:18.600
 And I mean, they're as far away from real as it gets.

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.040
 There's not even a visual component.

1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:22.040
 It's just audio.

1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:29.320
 But they're as real, like if I was on a desert island, like my imagination, like this thing

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:33.200
 works pretty good in terms of imagination.

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:40.600
 It creates a very beautiful world with just audio.

1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:42.440
 Or even just reading books.

1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:45.600
 Exactly, reading books.

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:51.520
 Even more so with reading books because there are certain mediums which stimulate the imagination

1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:54.560
 more.

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:59.520
 When you present less, the imagination works more and that can create really enriching

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:02.160
 experiences.

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:09.600
 To me, the question is, can you do some of the amazing things that make life amazing

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:11.280
 in virtual worlds?

1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:14.720
 It seems to me the answer there is obviously yes.

1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:20.280
 Even if I, like you, am attached to a lot of stuff in the physical world, I think I

1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:27.120
 can very readily imagine coming up with some of the same magical experiences in the virtual

1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:34.520
 world where you make friends and you can fall in love, where the source of love in your

1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:43.280
 life is to a much greater degree inside of a virtual world.

1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:47.280
 And then love means fulfillment, that means happiness, that's the thing you look forward

1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:48.280
 to.

1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:53.960
 And not some kind of dopamine rush type of love, but like long lasting like friendship.

1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:54.960
 Yeah, yeah.

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:55.960
 The real deal.

1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:56.960
 Yeah.

1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:02.280
 The question is on what is there in the way of applications, the content, and can it feed

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:04.280
 you those things?

1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:11.320
 Can it give you, like in my example of using the CAD program, it gives me the ability to

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:18.320
 do something I enjoy, which is imagining things and making things in a particular way.

1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:21.040
 Can we psychoanalyze you for a second?

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:22.040
 Sure.

1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:23.640
 What exactly do you enjoy?

1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:29.560
 Is there some component of you building the thing where you get to at least a little bit

1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:32.320
 share with others?

1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:37.520
 Like is there a human in the loop outside of you in that picture?

1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:39.480
 Will anyone ever see it?

1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:40.480
 Right.

1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:48.360
 There's a source of your enjoyment because I would argue that perhaps when like the turtles

1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:52.720
 all the way down, when you get to the bottom turtle, it has to do with other sharing with

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:53.720
 other humans.

1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:54.720
 Yeah.

1:24:54.720 --> 1:25:01.560
 And if you can then put those humans inside the VR world, then you start to...

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:02.560
 Then you can...

1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:07.800
 Okay, for example, you could do it in the physical world, the 3D printing, but you share

1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:12.240
 it in the virtual world and that's where the source of happiness is.

1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:18.040
 I think at least speaking for myself, I'm always thinking in terms of an audience and

1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:24.760
 at some level I feel like I'm doing this for someone or communicating to someone, even

1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:33.600
 if there's not a specific someone in mind, it could just be an abstract theoretical someone.

1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:36.960
 And it's like another app I spend a lot of time in is Mathematica.

1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:37.960
 Okay.

1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:38.960
 Yeah.

1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:39.960
 Incredible app.

1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:40.960
 Yeah.

1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:41.960
 Yeah.

1:25:41.960 --> 1:25:44.320
 And when I do a Mathematica notebook, if I'm trying to figure something out, I spend a

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:51.520
 lot of time typing, just my stuff is just huge blocks of text, just me thinking out

1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:57.280
 loud and then some graphs and calculations and stuff.

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:06.520
 Because to me, that act of explaining things and commenting helps me understand what I'm

1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:07.520
 doing.

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:12.080
 And there's kind of an audience, amorphous audience in mind.

1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:13.080
 Yeah.

1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:18.600
 I mean, most of this stuff nobody will ever see and yet I'm creating it as if there were

1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:27.920
 an audience that might read this stuff because that's a necessary constraint that helps me

1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.920
 do a better job.

1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:36.280
 What's the, this might be a tricky question to answer, what comes to mind as a particularly

1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:40.760
 beautiful thing that you're proud of that you created inside Mathematica visualization

1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:47.280
 wise or something that just comes to memory if it's possible to retrieve?

1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:58.080
 So the thing I've spent the most amount of time on is I got obsessed a long time ago,

1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:01.680
 was trying to tile the globe with hexagons.

1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:02.680
 Yes.

1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:03.680
 And.

1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:05.480
 An actual globe?

1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:06.680
 Well, any spherical.

1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:07.680
 Any spherical.

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:08.680
 Okay.

1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:12.520
 But with an eye towards putting it on the earth.

1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:15.440
 And so, and have it be recursive.

1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:22.100
 So you can have hexagons within hexagons, which is hard because and probably a bad idea

1:27:22.100 --> 1:27:28.360
 because you can't tile a hexagon with smaller hexagons.

1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:30.800
 They don't, they stick out.

1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:31.800
 Got it.

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:33.520
 So they're, oh, they stick out.

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:37.880
 So there's a, can you do some kind of fractal hexagon situation?

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:38.880
 Yeah.

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:39.880
 Yeah.

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:47.200
 So it's that and people who know me are always, now make fun of me for this.

1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:52.520
 So they'll send me, if they see a picture with hexagons in it, they'll like send me

1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:56.620
 a link to make fun of me.

1:27:56.620 --> 1:27:57.620
 So as some.

1:27:57.620 --> 1:28:00.280
 One of those people, Roger Penrose or.

1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:03.760
 I think Roger's a little above my level.

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:08.640
 He's into hexagons as well and tiling.

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:09.640
 Yeah.

1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:10.640
 Yeah.

1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:15.760
 So I did a lot of that and I thought, you know, it was pretty cool, but there's some

1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.960
 like surprisingly intractable problems that keep coming up.

1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:25.960
 Like you've always got to have some pentagons.

1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:31.880
 Like if you start with the icosahedron, which is equilateral triangles, which is a logical

1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:42.120
 place to start, you can cover those with hexagons, but every vertex where the triangles come

1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:44.800
 together is a pentagon.

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:45.800
 Has to be a pentagon.

1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:46.800
 Oh, interesting.

1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:49.720
 So it's all hexagons and then there's a pentagon at the intersections.

1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:50.720
 Yeah.

1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:51.720
 Yeah.

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:52.720
 Cool.

1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:53.720
 How'd you figure that out?

1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:54.720
 Is that a known fact?

1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:55.720
 Well, it's just, if you look at a.

1:28:55.720 --> 1:28:56.720
 Yeah.

1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:57.720
 Like just by inspection.

1:28:57.720 --> 1:28:58.720
 It's an obvious thing.

1:28:58.720 --> 1:28:59.720
 Got it.

1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:00.720
 Yeah.

1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:08.360
 So any system that you come up with to do this has got to have this exceptions built

1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:10.600
 into it for those 12.

1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:20.480
 You could have quintillions of hexagons, but you've still got to have 12 pentagons somewhere.

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:26.920
 So I've blown a hell of a lot of time on that over the years.

1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:33.040
 By the way, a lot of those kind of problems are very difficult to prove something about.

1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:34.040
 Yeah.

1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:35.040
 Yeah.

1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:36.040
 Yeah.

1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:44.960
 I think Uber did it because someone, one of my friends who knows of my interest in this

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:49.960
 and who likes to give me a hard time sent me a link.

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:56.840
 This is a couple of years ago to some code base that I think came out of Uber where they

1:29:56.840 --> 1:29:59.400
 had done this.

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:04.480
 You break down the whole surface of the earth into little hexagons.

1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:09.240
 So that was a real knife through the heart.

1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:14.220
 But I'll probably come back to it someday.

1:30:14.220 --> 1:30:19.280
 Is there something special about hexagons or are you interested in all kinds of tiling?

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:29.160
 Well, I'm interested in all kinds of tiling, but I know my limitations as a math guy.

1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:34.600
 So hexagons are about my speed.

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:36.760
 Just sufficient amount of complexity.

1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:37.760
 Yeah.

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:38.760
 Yeah.

1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:41.960
 But no, tiling is a really interesting problem.

1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:48.160
 Both two and three dimensional tiling problems are fascinating and they're one of those ancient

1:30:48.160 --> 1:30:59.000
 puzzles that has attracted brainiacs for centuries.

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:03.120
 Let me ask you a little bit about AI.

1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:10.640
 What are some likely interesting trajectories for the proliferation of AI in society over

1:31:10.640 --> 1:31:11.640
 the next couple of decades?

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:14.080
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:20.380
 I do not think about it a lot because it's a deep topic and I don't consider myself super

1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:22.760
 well informed about it.

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:28.880
 And AI seems to be a term that is applied to a lot of different things.

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:36.440
 So I've messed around just a tiny little bit with neural nets, with what's it called PCA,

1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:38.420
 principal component analysis.

1:31:38.420 --> 1:31:48.520
 So I guess I tend to think in terms of some granular bottom up ideas rather than big picture

1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:49.520
 top down.

1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:50.520
 Oh God.

1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:55.800
 So like very specific algorithms, like how are they going to, what problem are they going

1:31:55.800 --> 1:32:01.080
 to solve in society such that it has like a lot of big ripple effects.

1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:08.120
 I mean, we could talk a particular successful AI systems and success defined in different

1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:09.880
 ways of recent years.

1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:15.320
 So one is language models with GPT3.

1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:19.840
 Most importantly, they're self supervised, meaning they don't require much supervision

1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:25.960
 from humans, which means they can learn by just reading a huge amount of content created

1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:26.960
 by humans.

1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:30.400
 So read the internet and from that be able to generate text and do all kinds of things

1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:31.840
 like that.

1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:34.120
 It's possible they have a big enough neural network.

1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:41.760
 It's going to be able to have conversations with humans based on just reading human language.

1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:42.760
 That's an interesting idea.

1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:49.520
 To me, the very interesting idea that people don't think about it as AI because they're

1:32:49.520 --> 1:32:53.640
 kind of dumb currently is actual embodied robots.

1:32:53.640 --> 1:33:01.920
 So robotics like Boston Dynamics have downstairs and upstairs legged robots.

1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:08.700
 You know, the currently Boston Dynamics robots and most legged robots, most robots period

1:33:08.700 --> 1:33:11.800
 are pretty dumb.

1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:15.920
 Most of the challenges have to do with the actual, first of all, the engineering of making

1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:20.760
 the thing work, getting a sensor suite that allows you to do the same thing as with Magic

1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:21.760
 Leap.

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:29.360
 It's like a layer of like, where am I and what am I looking at?

1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:39.920
 I don't need to deeply understand my surroundings at a level beyond of what will hurt if I run

1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:40.920
 into it.

1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:41.920
 Yeah, yeah.

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:43.640
 But even that is hard.

1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:44.640
 That's hard.

1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:51.920
 But the thing that I think people don't in the robotics space explore enough is the human

1:33:51.920 --> 1:34:00.560
 robot interaction part of the picture, which is how it makes humans feel, how robots make

1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:01.560
 humans feel.

1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:08.720
 And I think that's going to have a very significant impact in the near future in society, which

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:17.480
 is the more you integrate AI systems of whatever form into society where humans are in contact

1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:19.640
 with them regularly.

1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:23.640
 So that could be embodied robotics or that could be social media algorithms.

1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:26.160
 I think that has a very significant impact.

1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:31.200
 And people often think like AI needs to be super smart to have an impact.

1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:37.200
 I think it needs to be super integrated with society to have an impact and more and more

1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.480
 that's happening, even if they're dumb.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:41.480
 Yeah.

1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:42.480
 Yeah.

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:52.600
 No, I mean, a lot of my exposure to robots is that I'm associated with a combat robotics

1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:53.600
 team.

1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:55.960
 And I've been to a few battle bots competitions.

1:34:55.960 --> 1:35:01.760
 And that's not like a lot of ways that's pretty far from the kind of robotics you're talking

1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:06.200
 about because these robots are remote controlled.

1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:08.500
 They're not autonomous.

1:35:08.500 --> 1:35:17.160
 And so they're pretty simple, but it's interesting to watch people's emotional reactions to different

1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:18.160
 robots.

1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:26.840
 So there was one that was in the last year's season, the 2020 season called Rusty that

1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:32.920
 was just like put together out of spare parts and it looked kind of cute and it became this

1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:39.080
 huge crowd favorite because you could see it was made of like salad bowls and random

1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:43.360
 pieces of hardware that this guy had like scavenged from his farm.

1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:49.560
 And so immediately people kind of fell in love with this one particular robot.

1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:57.520
 Whereas other robots might be like the bad guy, if you think of professional wrestling,

1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:00.960
 the heel and the baby face.

1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:06.080
 So people do, for reasons that are hard to understand, form these emotional reactions.

1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:10.860
 And we form narratives in the same way we do when we meet human beings, we tell stories

1:36:10.860 --> 1:36:16.920
 about these objects and they can be intelligent and they can be biological or they can be

1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:19.760
 almost close to inanimate objects.

1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:21.680
 That to me is kind of fascinating.

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:29.760
 And if robots choose to lean into that, it creates an interesting world.

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:34.760
 If they start using feedback loops to make themselves cuter.

1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:41.040
 Not just cuter, but everything that humans do, let's not speak harshly of robots, humans

1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:42.040
 do the same thing.

1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:48.260
 Oh no, I wasn't meaning it in a, but you're right, humans based on feedback will change

1:36:48.260 --> 1:36:49.260
 their appearance.

1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:52.360
 Yes, I do this on Instagram all the time, how do I look cuter?

1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:54.880
 That's the fundamental question I ask myself.

1:36:54.880 --> 1:37:02.100
 So why wouldn't a robot wanna, it's like oh wow, people really don't like the quad mount

1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:08.640
 machine gun on top of my turret, maybe I should get rid of that and people would feel more

1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:10.680
 at ease.

1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:13.680
 Or lean into it, be proud of it.

1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:20.440
 Like you won't take my gun, whatever the saying is, from my dead cold hands.

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:26.280
 I mean their personality, adding personality such that you can start to heal, you can start

1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:27.840
 to weave narratives.

1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:41.320
 I think that's a fascinating place where there's this feedback loop, like you said, where AI,

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.000
 especially when it's embodied, puts a mirror to ourselves.

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.840
 Just like other humans, our close friends, they kind of teach us about ourselves.

1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:57.360
 We teach each other and through that process grow close.

1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:06.200
 And to me it's so fascinating to expand the space of deep meaningful interactions beyond

1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:10.480
 just humans.

1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:18.080
 That's the opportunity I see with robots and with AI systems and that's why I don't like,

1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:22.280
 my biggest problem with social media algorithms is the lack of transparency.

1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:27.920
 It's not the existence of the algorithms, it's, well there's many things.

1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:28.920
 One is the data.

1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:33.280
 Data should be controlled by people themselves.

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:36.320
 But also the lack of transparency in how the algorithms work.

1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:41.640
 You change your perception of what's real in hidden ways.

1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:42.640
 In hidden ways.

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:43.640
 Yeah.

1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:47.680
 Like you should be aware, just like when you take, I don't know, if you take psychedelics,

1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:52.040
 you should be aware that you took the psychedelics, it shouldn't be a surprise.

1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:59.440
 And second, you should become a student and a scholar and there should be research done,

1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:05.920
 there should be open conversation about how your perception has changed and then you become

1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:13.360
 your own guide in this world of altered perception because arguably none of it is real.

1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:16.560
 You get to choose the flavor of real.

1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:22.720
 I mean, this is something you explore quite a bit.

1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:31.580
 Do you yourself think that there is a bottom to it where there is reality, there's a base

1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:39.840
 layer of reality that physics can explore and our human perception sort of layer stuff?

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:44.920
 Is there, let's go to Plato, is there such a thing as truth?

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:48.480
 I lean towards the Platonic view of things.

1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:56.640
 So I believe that mathematical objects have a reality that it's not all made up by human

1:39:56.640 --> 1:39:59.180
 minds.

1:39:59.180 --> 1:40:03.200
 And I don't know where that reality comes from.

1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:15.800
 I can't explain it, but I do think that mathematical objects are discovered and not invented.

1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:25.880
 I did a lot of, not a lot, but I did some reading of Husserl when I was writing Anathem

1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:34.120
 and he's a 20th century phenomenologist and he's writing in the, he's writing at the same

1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:43.040
 time as scientists are starting to understand atoms and becoming aware that when we look

1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:51.400
 at this table, it's really just a slab of almost entirely vacuum and there's a very

1:40:51.400 --> 1:41:00.080
 sparse arrangement of tiny, tiny little particles there occupying that space that interact with

1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:07.120
 each other in such a way that our brains perceive this object.

1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:20.400
 So that's kind of the beginnings of phenomenology and his stuff is pretty hard to read.

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:27.800
 You really have to take it in small bites and go a little bit at a time.

1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:32.800
 But he's trying to come to grips with these kinds of questions.

1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:36.160
 How did you come to grips with it?

1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:38.000
 Why does this table feel solid?

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:44.080
 Well, I mean, we're an evolved system that there's, we have biological advantages in

1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:46.820
 knowing where solid objects are.

1:41:46.820 --> 1:41:54.540
 So we've got this system in our head that integrates our perceptions into this coherent

1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:59.040
 view of things.

1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:06.600
 One of the take homes that I like from Husserl is the idea of intersubjectivity and the idea

1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:16.000
 that the fundamental requirement for us to stay sane is for us to share our perceptions

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:23.960
 and have them ratified by other, they don't even have to be people, but a prisoner in

1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:32.440
 solitary confinement might domesticate a mouse or even insects because they perceive the

1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:41.040
 same things that the prisoner perceives and so convince him that he's not just hallucinating.

1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:49.320
 Yeah, there's the establish a consensus, but see, that doesn't mean any of it is real.

1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:52.600
 You just establish a consensus.

1:42:52.600 --> 1:43:05.080
 It could be very distant from something that's real in an engineering sense of real.

1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:07.840
 Like you could build it using physics.

1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:16.160
 But I think that a valuable application for an AI robot would be just to do nothing except

1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:17.160
 that.

1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:27.000
 It just sits there and if you hear a door slam, you might turn to see what it is.

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:34.720
 If the robot at the same time turns to look at the door slam, it's ratifying your perception.

1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:42.920
 But isn't that the basis of love is when the door slams, you both look, but for deeper

1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:48.960
 things, you both hear the same music and others don't.

1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:52.160
 I mean, isn't that what that means?

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:53.160
 Yeah.

1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:55.680
 By love, I mean depth of human connection.

1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:56.680
 Yeah.

1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:05.360
 Yeah, you arrive at similar reactions without having to explicitly communicate it.

1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:06.360
 Yeah.

1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:15.360
 But we could start with a robot that listens explicitly for the slam doors or scary sounds.

1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:24.920
 I can think of an example of this is when I went to college, we'd be sitting at the

1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:34.040
 cafeteria, a bunch of people eating our dinner together that we had just met, let's say.

1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:41.780
 So a bunch of new people in your life and someone might make a funny remark or a not

1:44:41.780 --> 1:44:48.160
 so funny remark or something would happen and you might then at that moment make eye

1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:54.040
 contact with someone you didn't know at the other end of the table.

1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:59.560
 In that moment, you would realize this person is reacting.

1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:01.720
 This person heard what I heard.

1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:04.880
 They're reacting the way I reacted.

1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:10.560
 Nobody else appears to get the joke or to understand what just happened, but random

1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:15.600
 stranger down there and I, we have this connection and then you build on that.

1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:22.120
 So then the next time something happens, you automatically look at your new friend and

1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:28.520
 they look back at you and before you know it, you're hanging out together because you

1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:34.400
 know you've already established without even talking to each other that you're on the same

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:35.400
 wavelength.

1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:36.400
 Yeah.

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:41.160
 It's seemingly so simple, but so powerful that establishing that you're on the same

1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:43.880
 wavelength at some level.

1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:48.080
 There's no reason why you and a toaster can't have that.

1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:49.560
 I'm just saying.

1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:52.760
 Does this smell burned to you?

1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:53.760
 Exactly.

1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:55.720
 I think it's burnt.

1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:59.000
 If a toaster could just say that to you.

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.000
 Yeah.

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:01.000
 Yeah.

1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:07.640
 Cryptonomicon published in 1999, set in the late 90s and involves hackers who build essentially

1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:08.640
 cryptocurrency.

1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:14.720
 Bitcoin white paper came out in 2008.

1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:23.360
 So I have to kind of ask, from you looking at this layout of what's been happening in

1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:32.120
 cryptocurrency, the evolution of this technology, how has it rolled out differently than you

1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:34.280
 could have imagined in two ways?

1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:42.360
 One the technology itself and two the human side of things, the human stories of the hackers

1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:48.800
 and the financial folks and the powerful and the powerless, the human side of things.

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:49.800
 Yeah.

1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:55.720
 Well, Cryptonomicon is pre Bitcoin, it's pre Satoshi, it's pre blockchain as you point

1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:56.720
 out.

1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:05.200
 So at that point I was kind of reacting to what I was seeing among people like the Bay

1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:07.760
 Area Cypherpunks in Berkeley.

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:17.840
 There was a branch here in Austin as well and a lot of their thinking was based on the

1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:26.200
 idea that you would have to have a physical region of the earth that was free of government

1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:28.720
 interference.

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:34.580
 You couldn't achieve that freedom by purely mathematical means on the network.

1:47:34.580 --> 1:47:42.680
 You actually had to have a room somewhere with servers in it that a government couldn't

1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:44.880
 come and meddle with.

1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.560
 And so a lot of ideation happened around that view of things that there were efforts to

1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:53.280
 figure out jurisdictions where this might work.

1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:58.860
 There was a lot of interest for a while in Anguilla, which is a Caribbean island that

1:47:58.860 --> 1:48:02.360
 had some unusual jurisdictional properties.

1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:09.520
 There was SeaLand, which is a platform in the North Sea.

1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:14.200
 And so there was a lot of effort that went into finding these physical locations that

1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:17.360
 were deemed kind of safe.

1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:25.780
 And that all goes away with blockchain, it's no longer necessary.

1:48:25.780 --> 1:48:32.240
 And so that really changes the picture in a lot of ways because you no longer have...

1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:38.080
 From a novelist point of view, the old system was a lot more fun to work with because it

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:44.240
 gives you a situation where hackers are wandering around in strange parts of the world trying

1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:46.300
 to set up server rooms.

1:48:46.300 --> 1:48:48.640
 So that's a great storytelling thing.

1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:54.680
 There's still a little bit of that in the modern world, but it's just there's several

1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:57.720
 server rooms as opposed to one centralized one.

1:48:57.720 --> 1:48:58.720
 Yeah.

1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:07.640
 Whereas the new wrinkle is the need to do a lot of computation and to keep your GPUs

1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:08.800
 from melting down.

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:14.420
 So people building things in Iceland or in shipping containers on the bottom of the ocean

1:49:14.420 --> 1:49:16.920
 or whatever.

1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:17.920
 So...

1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:21.520
 But there's still governments involved and there's still from a novelist perspective

1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:28.600
 interesting dynamics with big governments like China and more sort of renegade governments

1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:34.960
 from all over the world trying to contend with this idea of what to do in terms of control

1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:41.200
 and power over these kinds of centers that do the mining of the cryptocurrency.

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:42.200
 Yeah.

1:49:42.200 --> 1:49:46.440
 So we're in a stage now that kind of goes beyond the initial...

1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:47.800
 Like there was...

1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:54.980
 The stuff I was describing in Cryptonomicon had a little bit of air about it of the underpants

1:49:54.980 --> 1:50:03.120
 gnomes in that we're gonna build this system and then we'll make money somehow.

1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:08.680
 But the intermediate step was left out.

1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:11.680
 And that is...

1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:19.980
 I think we're now sort of into that phase of the thing where Bitcoin, blockchain exists,

1:50:19.980 --> 1:50:24.960
 people know how it works, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exist.

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:28.680
 People are using them and it's sort of like, okay, what now?

1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:31.840
 Where does this all lead?

1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:32.840
 So...

1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:35.040
 Do you have a sense of where it all leads?

1:50:35.040 --> 1:50:44.200
 Like is it possible that the set of technology kind of continues to have transformational

1:50:44.200 --> 1:50:52.840
 effects on not just sort of finance but who gets to have power in this world?

1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:55.680
 So the decentralization of power.

1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:56.920
 Big questions, right?

1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:03.520
 So I guess there's a little bit of the cynic in me thinking that as soon as it becomes

1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:10.080
 important enough, the existing banks and people in power are gonna sort of control it.

1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:16.760
 I guess an easy answer is that maybe it won't be a big change in the end.

1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:23.460
 There's a utopian strain sometimes in the way people think about this that I'm not so

1:51:23.460 --> 1:51:26.360
 sure about.

1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:32.960
 There is a technological aspect to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that make it a

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:41.680
 little easier to pull along the utopian thread because it's harder for governments to control

1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:42.680
 Bitcoin.

1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:48.200
 I mean, they have much fewer options.

1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:50.920
 They can ban, they can make it illegal.

1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:52.360
 It's more difficult.

1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:57.200
 So technology here is on the side of the powerless, the voiceless, which is a very interesting

1:51:57.200 --> 1:51:58.200
 idea.

1:51:58.200 --> 1:52:04.320
 Of course, yes, it does have a utopian feel to it, but we have been making progress throughout

1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:05.920
 human history.

1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:07.400
 Maybe this is what progress looks like.

1:52:07.400 --> 1:52:12.800
 There will be the powerful and the greedy and the bureaucrats that take advantage of

1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:19.240
 it, skim off the top kind of thing, but maybe this does give more power to people that haven't

1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:29.200
 had power before in a good way, like distributing power and enabling sort of more greater resistance

1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:36.600
 to sort of dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, that kind of thing, and also enabling

1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:40.400
 all kinds of technologies built on top of it.

1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:49.520
 Ultimately, when you digitize money, money is a kind of speech, or it's a kind of mechanism

1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:56.320
 of how humans interact, and if you make that digital, more and more of the world moves

1:52:56.320 --> 1:53:04.120
 to the digital space, and then you can finally fully live in that virtual reality with the

1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:05.120
 toaster.

1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:11.840
 In a lot of ways, I think in that realm of technology that the money per se is one of

1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:16.480
 the less interesting things you can do with it, so I think cryptographically enforceable

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:24.120
 contracts and organizations built on those, that seems to me like it's got more potential

1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:33.680
 for change just because we do already have money, and although it's an old system, it's

1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:42.160
 been digitized to a large extent by the stripes and the credit card companies of the world.

1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:51.000
 I also love the idea of connecting two smart contracts, connecting data, sort of making

1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:58.120
 it more formal, it's like Mathematica, more structured, the integration of data, of weather

1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:06.960
 data, of all kinds of data about the stuff in the world, so they can make contracts between

1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:14.600
 people that's grounded in data, and that's actually getting closer to something like

1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:20.560
 truth, because then you can make agreements based on actual data versus kind of perceptions

1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:28.080
 of data, and if you can formalize, like distribute the power of who gets to tell the story, and

1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:35.000
 that's an interesting kind of resistance against the powerful in the space of narrative.

1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:42.520
 Yeah, David Brin has been saying for a while that the only way to settle arguments across

1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:52.720
 the political divide is to make bets, so people can say the election was stolen, or whatever

1:54:52.720 --> 1:55:02.760
 controversial position they're taking, and they'll keep saying it until you wager real

1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:07.240
 money on it.

1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:14.040
 So maybe there's something there, if you could kind of turn that into a, put a user interface

1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:15.040
 on that.

1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:25.040
 Yeah, have a stake in your divisiveness, in your arguments.

1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:27.160
 Will Dogecoin take over the world?

1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:28.280
 Twitter question.

1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:33.880
 You know, I don't follow the different coins that much, so I don't, I mean I hear about

1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.880
 Dogecoin and I've kind of followed the story of it.

1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:47.040
 So the interesting aspect of Dogecoin is it, so in contrast to like Bitcoin and Ethereum,

1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:52.880
 which are these serious implementations of cryptocurrency that seek to solve some of

1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:59.080
 the problems that we're talking about with smart contracts and resist the banks and all

1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:06.040
 those kinds of things, Dogecoin operates more in the space of memes and humor, while still

1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:09.000
 doing some of the similar things.

1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:20.040
 And it presents to the world sort of a question of whether memes, whether humor, whether narrative

1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:25.040
 will go a long way in the future.

1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:32.600
 Like much farther than some kind of boring old grounded technologies.

1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:35.440
 Whether we'll be playing in the space of fun.

1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:41.880
 Like once we've built a base of comfort and stability and like a robust system where everyone

1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:50.720
 has shelter, everyone has food and the basic needs covered, are we going to then operate

1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:53.880
 in the space of fun?

1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:55.280
 That's what I think about Dogecoin.

1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:02.300
 Because it seems like fun spreads faster than anything else.

1:57:02.300 --> 1:57:06.400
 Fun of different kinds, and that could be bad fun and that could be good fun.

1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:09.000
 And so it's a battle of good fun versus bad fun.

1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:14.200
 It goes viral very, very quickly when you, if you post something that people find fun

1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:15.200
 to.

1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:16.200
 Yeah.

1:57:16.200 --> 1:57:17.200
 And that's what Dogecoin represents.

1:57:17.200 --> 1:57:25.160
 So there's like, so Bitcoin represents like financial, like serious financial instruments

1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:27.240
 and then Dogecoin represents fun.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:33.900
 And it's interesting to watch the battle go on on the internet to see which wins.

1:57:33.900 --> 1:57:39.080
 This is also like open question to me of what is the internet?

1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:43.560
 Because fun seems to prevail on the internet.

1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:48.000
 And is that a fundamental property of the internet moving forward when you look a hundred

1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:53.640
 years out, or is this a temporary thing that was true at the birth of the internet and

1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:58.720
 it's just true for a couple of decades until it fades away and the adults take over and

1:57:58.720 --> 1:57:59.720
 become serious again?

1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:05.440
 Well, I think the adults took over initially and then it was later on that people started

1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:10.100
 using it for fun, frivolous things like memes.

1:58:10.100 --> 1:58:16.800
 And that's, I think that's pretty much unstoppable, you know, because even people who are very

1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:26.080
 serious, you know, enjoy sending around a funny picture or something that amuses them.

1:58:26.080 --> 1:58:27.080
 Yeah.

1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:30.480
 I personally think we spoke about World War II.

1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:35.960
 I think memes will save the world and prevent all future wars.

1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:41.060
 You've been handwriting your work for the past 20 years since writing The Baroque Cycle.

1:58:41.060 --> 1:58:44.140
 What are the pros and cons of handwriting versus typing?

1:58:44.140 --> 1:58:49.340
 For me, I started it as an experiment when I started The Baroque Cycle because I had

1:58:49.340 --> 1:58:54.640
 noticed that sometimes if I was stuck having a hard time getting started, if I just picked

1:58:54.640 --> 1:59:00.100
 up a pen and started writing, it was easy to go.

1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:04.040
 So I just decided to keep with that.

1:59:04.040 --> 1:59:08.240
 If it got in my way, I didn't like it, I could always just go back to the word processor

1:59:08.240 --> 1:59:09.240
 and be fine.

1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:11.160
 But that never happened.

1:59:11.160 --> 1:59:16.880
 So there's a certain security that comes from knowing that it's ink on paper and there's

1:59:16.880 --> 1:59:28.600
 no operating system crash or software failure that can obliterate it.

1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:31.880
 It's a slower output technique.

1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:39.520
 And so a sentence or a paragraph spends a longer time in the buffer up here before it

1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:43.800
 gets committed to paper, whereas I can type really fast.

1:59:43.800 --> 1:59:48.900
 And so I can slam things out before I've really thought them through.

1:59:48.900 --> 1:59:54.300
 So I think the first draft quality ends up being higher.

1:59:54.300 --> 2:00:00.840
 And then editing, first draft of editing is just faster because instead of like trying

2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:07.880
 to move the cursor around or whatever or hitting the backspace key, I can just draw a line

2:00:07.880 --> 2:00:14.600
 through a word or a sentence or just around a whole paragraph and exit out.

2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:18.880
 And in doing so, I very quickly created an edit, but I've also left behind a record of

2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:22.200
 what the text was prior to the edit.

2:00:22.200 --> 2:00:28.880
 Of course, all the digital versions have those quote unquote features, but their experience

2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:31.280
 is different.

2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:41.240
 Is there a romance to just the physical, the touch of the pen to the paper doing what has

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.160
 been done for centuries?

2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:44.160
 I think there is.

2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:50.940
 I think there's just the simplicity of it and not having any intermediary technology

2:00:50.940 --> 2:01:01.840
 beyond the pen and the paper is just very simple and clean and so I've got a bunch of

2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:03.960
 fountain pens.

2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:10.680
 I started buying fancy paper from Italy a few years ago because I thought I would be

2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:19.920
 more conservative with it, but it's still a trivial expenditure, so it doesn't really

2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:24.280
 alter my habits very much.

2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:30.200
 So all that said, once you do type stuff up, you use Emacs.

2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:33.480
 I use Emacs, obviously the superior editor.

2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:34.480
 Of course.

2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:41.160
 Let me just ask the ridiculous futuristic question because Emacs has been around forever.

2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:52.200
 Do you think in 100 years we will still have Emacs and Vim, or like pick a let's say 50,

2:01:52.200 --> 2:01:53.200
 100 years.

2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:54.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:01:54.200 --> 2:02:00.980
 No, I mean whenever you're doing anything in Linux, you're spending a lot of time editing

2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:06.960
 little config files and scripts and stuff and you need to be able to pop in and out

2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:12.100
 of editing those things and it needs to work.

2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:19.680
 Like even if the windowing GUI is dead and all you've got is like a command line, to

2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:26.560
 get out of that problem, you might need to enter an editor and alter a file.

2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:34.280
 So I think on that level, there will always have to be sort of very simple, well Emacs

2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:37.060
 isn't very simple, but you know what I mean.

2:02:37.060 --> 2:02:44.080
 There have to be basic editors that you can use from either the command line or a GUI

2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:47.440
 just for administering systems.

2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:58.580
 Now how widespread they'll be, there's a certain amount of, what's the story of the American

2:02:58.580 --> 2:03:06.960
 folktale of the hammer guy who drives the railroad spikes, John Henry, trying to keep

2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:12.660
 up with the steam hammer and eventually the steam hammer wins because he can't drive the

2:03:12.660 --> 2:03:14.160
 spikes fast enough.

2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:25.360
 So there's a sense in which Microsoft, who knows how much they've invested in code visual

2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:29.880
 studio or Apple with Xcode.

2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:38.200
 So they've put huge amounts of money into enhancing their IDEs and Emacs in theory can

2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:47.000
 duplicate all of those features by if you just have enough Linux hackers writing Emacs

2:03:47.000 --> 2:04:00.600
 Lisp macros, but at some point it's gonna be hard to maintain that level of, to keep

2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:03.680
 up feature for feature.

2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:09.160
 The interesting thing about Emacs just is it's lasted a long time and I think you talked

2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:21.160
 about that there's a certain fads certainly in the software engineering space and it's

2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:28.760
 interesting to think about technologies that sort of last for a very long time and just

2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:33.440
 kind of being in the, what is it, how do they get by?

2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:41.240
 It's like the cockroaches of software or the bacteria software or something like this base

2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:47.520
 thing that nobody, everybody's just became reliant on and they just outlast everything

2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:52.880
 else and slowly, slowly adjust with the times with a little bit of a delay, with a little

2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:58.560
 bit of customization by individuals kind of that, but they're always there in the shadows

2:04:58.560 --> 2:05:01.360
 and they outlast everybody else.

2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:05.880
 And I wonder if that might be the story for a lot of technologies, especially in the software

2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:06.880
 space.

2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:14.040
 Shell scripts, all that stuff, you can't run the modern world without a bunch of shell

2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:18.880
 scripts booting up machines and running things.

2:05:18.880 --> 2:05:25.680
 So that is gonna be a hard thing to replace.

2:05:25.680 --> 2:05:29.200
 And then tech for typesetting that you use, you said.

2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:35.240
 For when I want to print it out, yeah, I just have some simple macros that I use, but then

2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:42.440
 I have to, the publisher put their foot down and they want it in Word format now.

2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:52.440
 So years ago I wrote some macros to convert and this time, what did I do?

2:05:52.440 --> 2:05:53.440
 Copy paste?

2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:57.440
 No, I use sort of regular expressions.

2:05:57.440 --> 2:06:05.680
 So I was to do italics in, you put it in curly brackets and you do backslash IT and then

2:06:05.680 --> 2:06:09.900
 you type what you want to type and that's how you get italics in tech.

2:06:09.900 --> 2:06:16.520
 So you can create a regular expression that'll look for some text between curly brackets

2:06:16.520 --> 2:06:24.800
 preceded by backslash IT and then instead convert that to italics.

2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:28.240
 And Word will do that.

2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:31.520
 Word if you go deep enough into its search and replace UI.

2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:34.160
 You can do regular expressions.

2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:35.160
 Is just regfs.

2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:36.160
 Yeah.

2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:38.160
 It's funny that you did that.

2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:39.160
 Yeah.

2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:45.840
 I mean, I'm sure there's tools that help you with that kind of thing, but the task is sufficiently

2:06:45.840 --> 2:06:51.240
 simple to where you can do a much better job than anyone, anybody else's tool can.

2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:52.240
 Yeah, yeah.

2:06:52.240 --> 2:06:53.240
 So.

2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:54.240
 That's a fascinating process.

2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:55.240
 That's fine for me.

2:06:55.240 --> 2:06:56.240
 Yeah.

2:06:56.240 --> 2:06:58.600
 And it keeps you from messing around with formatting.

2:06:58.600 --> 2:06:59.600
 Yeah.

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:06.000
 Like, Oh, what if I put this chapter heading, you know, in, you know, a sans serif font?

2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:07.000
 Yeah.

2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:09.400
 It's a, it's just classic wanking.

2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:16.360
 And so those options are closed off in what I'm doing.

2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:20.960
 Is there advice you could say, what does it take to write a great story?

2:07:20.960 --> 2:07:28.080
 The power of, of good yarns, good narratives to, um, pull people in is, is, uh, incredible.

2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:36.800
 And I think my sort of amateur theory is that it's an evolutionary development that if you're,

2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:45.320
 um, you know, uh, uh, cave person sitting around a fire in the rift valley a million

2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:57.000
 years ago, um, if you can tell the story of how you escaped from the hyenas, um, or how

2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:02.480
 uncle Bob, you know, didn't escape from the hyenas, and if the people listening to you

2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:09.200
 can take that in and they can build that scenario in their heads, like a kind of virtual reality

2:08:09.200 --> 2:08:16.920
 and see what you're describing, then you've just conferred an incredibly important advantage

2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:19.040
 on the people who've heard that story.

2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:20.040
 Yeah.

2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:21.040
 Right.

2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:25.280
 And so they know a bunch of stuff now about how to stay alive that they could not have

2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:28.400
 learned in any other way.

2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:34.520
 Um, I mean, animals who don't have speech though, they might warn each other, they might

2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:42.800
 make a sound that says danger, danger, um, but, uh, but as far as we know, they can't

2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:44.560
 tell more complicated stories.

2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:47.520
 So it's a part of us.

2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:48.520
 Yeah.

2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:53.360
 I, the, the, the collective intelligence seems to be one of the key characteristics of the,

2:08:53.360 --> 2:09:00.180
 of homo sapiens, the ability to share ideas and hold ideas together in our minds and storytelling

2:09:00.180 --> 2:09:01.860
 is the fundamental aspect of that.

2:09:01.860 --> 2:09:08.440
 Maybe even language itself is more fundamental because the language is required to do the

2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:11.440
 storytelling or maybe they evolve together.

2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:12.680
 Maybe they co evolve.

2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:13.680
 Yeah.

2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:18.880
 So I think that you've got to work with that and I think, uh, sometimes it seems like in

2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:27.440
 kind of, um, literary circles that having a lot of plot is a little bit frowned upon

2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:35.040
 as it's pulpy or it's exploitative, but, um, for me, I don't have any compunctions whatsoever

2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:36.040
 about that.

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:40.720
 I like stories that, um, are grabby and fun and exciting to read.

2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:46.480
 And once you've got one of those going, once you've got a good yarn going that people will

2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:52.000
 enjoy reading, then you're free to do whatever you want, uh, in the frame of that story.

2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:56.400
 Um, but if you don't have that, um, then you got nothing.

2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:02.800
 What about having like, uh, which you do at a technological scientific rigor, like to

2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:09.400
 the, to the accuracy and as much as possible, how does that add to the, to, to Bob telling

2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:12.640
 the story or telling the story about Bob or on the campfire?

2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:19.520
 Well, the main thing that it does is, um, present, um, little details that you might

2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:23.080
 not have come up with on your own.

2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:30.880
 So if you're just sitting there freely imagining things, um, you, uh, you, your, your brain

2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:36.320
 probably isn't going to serve up the wealth of details and the resulting complications

2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:42.560
 and surprises that real, that the real world is constantly presenting us with.

2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:49.780
 And so, um, in my case, if I'm, um, trying to write a story about, you know, some that

2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:56.080
 involves some technology like a rocket or, uh, orbital maneuvers or whatever, then delving

2:10:56.080 --> 2:11:02.760
 into those details eventually is going to turn up some weird unexpected, you know, thing

2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:09.640
 that, uh, gives me material to work with, but also subliminally readers who see that

2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:17.080
 are going to be drawn in more, uh, because they're going to, uh, to, to find that, um,

2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:21.880
 oh, I didn't see that coming, you know, you know, it's got some of the complexity and

2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:23.920
 surprise value of the real world.

2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:24.920
 Yeah.

2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:33.240
 It does something, um, uh, Alex Garland, director who did, uh, who wrote, uh, directed Ex Machina.

2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:41.920
 I think about AI movies and the more care you take in making it accurate, the more compelling

2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:44.320
 the story becomes somehow.

2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:47.200
 I'm not, I'm not sure what that is.

2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:52.960
 Um, maybe because it becomes more real to the people writing the story, maybe it just

2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:54.640
 makes you a better writer.

2:11:54.640 --> 2:12:00.880
 The key to any storytelling is getting the, the readers to suspend their, their disbelief.

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:05.040
 And there's all kinds of triggers and little tells that can break that.

2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:06.040
 Right.

2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:09.240
 Um, and once it's broken, it's really hard to get it back.

2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:12.440
 Uh, you know, a lot of times that's the end.

2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:15.760
 Everybody will just close the book and not pick it up.

2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:22.480
 Um, I gotta ask you, you've answered this question, but I gotta ask you the most impossible

2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:30.240
 question for an author to answer, but which Neal Stephenson book should one read first?

2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:35.040
 So when people ask me that, I usually ask them what they like to read, right?

2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:42.360
 Because, uh, I mean, there's the best known one is probably snow crash, but that's a cyber

2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:43.360
 punk novel.

2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:46.480
 That's at the same time, making fun of cyber punk.

2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:53.800
 Um, so it's kind of got some layers to it that, uh, might not seem so funny if you don't

2:12:53.800 --> 2:12:57.000
 have that, if you don't get the joke, right?

2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:03.120
 So, um, there's, uh, I've written, as you point out, I've written historical novels.

2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:04.560
 Some people like those.

2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:06.520
 Some people prefer those.

2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:12.340
 So if that's what you like, then kryptonomicon or the baroque cycle is where you would start

2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:17.800
 if you like sort of techno thrillers that are set in a modern day setting, but aren't

2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:25.160
 science fictiony per se, then, uh, Reamdy, um, is one of those.

2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:29.440
 And termination shock, um, is, is, is definitely one of those.

2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:35.920
 Um, so it just depends on, on, uh, what people like.

2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:43.040
 What, what, uh, when people a long time ago recommend I read snow crash, they said, uh,

2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:47.920
 it's the, it's Neil Stevenson light.

2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:54.240
 It's the, uh, like if you don't want to be overwhelmed by the depth, like the rigor book,

2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:57.720
 like that's a good, that's a good introduction to the man.

2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:05.160
 So essentially you broke it down by topics, but if you wanted to read all of them, what's

2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:10.320
 a good introduction to the, to the man, because obviously these worlds are very different.

2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:12.920
 The philosophies are very different.

2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:17.640
 What's a good introduction to the human?

2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:23.240
 People ask the same thing of Dostoyevsky, people, it's a, it's a hard one to answer.

2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:26.920
 Maybe seven eves because it's got big themes.

2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:32.920
 Um, it's, you know, it's about heavy, heavy things happening to the human race.

2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:39.320
 Uh, but hopefully the story is told through a cast of characters that, uh, people can

2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:47.360
 relate to, you know, and it moves along, uh, so, uh, it, it does go kind of deep eventually

2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:54.320
 on how rockets work and orbital mechanics and all that stuff, but, um, people were able

2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:57.600
 to get through it anyway, or some people just skip over that.

2:14:57.600 --> 2:14:58.600
 It's fine.

2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:06.560
 You know, um, as an author, let me ask you what books had a big impact on your life that

2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:07.560
 you've read.

2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:14.040
 Is there any that jumped to mind that, uh, you learned from as a writer, as a philosopher,

2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:17.160
 as a mathematician, as an engineer?

2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:19.520
 This is one of these questions where I always blank out.

2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:26.000
 And then when I'm walking out the door, I'll, I'll remember 12, so this is a random selection

2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:27.680
 that doesn't represent the top.

2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:34.400
 The top ones, um, well, I mentioned, you know, gulag archipelago and it's kind of a hefty

2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:37.920
 and dark, but, and then it has a personal connection as well.

2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:38.920
 Yeah.

2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:44.040
 Just like where you found the book to the part, the time in your life, where you found

2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:45.620
 it, who recommended it.

2:15:45.620 --> 2:15:46.920
 That's also part of the story.

2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:47.920
 Yeah.

2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:54.200
 So there's definitely that there's, you know, I, I circle back to Moby Dick a lot, um, because

2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:59.620
 we read it in a, uh, a really great English class I had in high school.

2:15:59.620 --> 2:16:05.040
 And I came in with an oppositional stance because I thought that the teacher was going

2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:11.640
 to try to talk me into having all kinds of highfalutin ideas about allegory and what

2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:12.640
 does this mean?

2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:13.640
 What's the symbolism?

2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:20.960
 And it turned out that, uh, it turned out to be a lot more interesting and satisfying

2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:21.960
 than that.

2:16:21.960 --> 2:16:29.920
 Um, what was the first powerful book you remember reading that like convinced you that this

2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:32.440
 form could have depth?

2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:33.440
 Hmm.

2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:34.440
 Was it Moby Dick?

2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:35.440
 Was it like in high school?

2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:39.320
 I'm trying to remember, well, Moby Dick was definitely a big one.

2:16:39.320 --> 2:16:45.160
 Um, I mean, I used to read a lot of classics comics when I was, I don't know if you've

2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:53.080
 seen these, it's a whole series of comic books that, um, uh, it was viral.

2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:57.760
 You could, uh, in the, in the back of each comic book was an order form.

2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:03.240
 You could check some boxes and fill out your address and mail it in and more would show

2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:04.240
 up.

2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:10.040
 And, but it was like, they would do the Count of Monte Cristo, you know, Moby Dick, you

2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:17.240
 know, Robert Louis Stevenson, Robinson Crusoe, you know, all this of classic books, uh, were,

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.480
 they had put into comic book form.

2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:21.040
 That's amazing.

2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:22.040
 Yeah.

2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:26.240
 Reading Moby Dick, if you're nine years old is a tall order.

2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:32.080
 There's some very complicated sentences in there and a lot of digressions, but if you're

2:17:32.080 --> 2:17:36.960
 just looking at the comic books, like, holy shit, look at that whale, you know?

2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:43.600
 Um, and, um, and ultimately the power of the story doesn't need the complicated words.

2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:47.720
 It's, it's all about the man and the, and the whale.

2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:48.720
 Yeah.

2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:49.720
 Yeah.

2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:52.600
 So you could get kind of a grounding in a lot of classic works of literature without

2:17:52.600 --> 2:17:57.560
 actually reading them, which is, you know, it's great when you're nine years old.

2:17:57.560 --> 2:18:01.540
 So, so I read a lot of that stuff, uh, for sure.

2:18:01.540 --> 2:18:07.240
 The annotated Sherlock Holmes, um.

2:18:07.240 --> 2:18:10.360
 You mentioned David Deutsch too, as an inspiration for some of your work.

2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:14.520
 I mean, you've, you've obviously didn't like really a lot of research for the books you,

2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:15.520
 you do.

2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:16.520
 Roger Penrose.

2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:22.900
 What, uh, do you remember a book that made you want to become a writer or a moment that

2:18:22.900 --> 2:18:23.900
 made you become a writer?

2:18:23.900 --> 2:18:31.520
 I think like the, you know, the answer I usually give is that when I was in like fifth grade

2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:40.040
 and one of my friends came to school one day, he was wearing leather shoes, like dress shoes

2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:44.520
 and I hated dress shoes cause mine never fit.

2:18:44.520 --> 2:18:45.880
 And so they were uncomfortable.

2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:50.420
 I couldn't run, you know, they were cold, it was Iowa.

2:18:50.420 --> 2:18:57.000
 So I kind of said, I remember very clearly thinking, okay, I don't like where this is

2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:58.000
 going.

2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:08.720
 Like, does this mean that next year all of the kids are going to be wearing leather shoes?

2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:12.640
 So I need to find a job where I don't have to do that.

2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:17.920
 So that was like the first time I thought about trying to find such a job, you know,

2:19:17.920 --> 2:19:18.920
 being a writer.

2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:24.680
 And then, and then I just read a lot of, uh, just classic science fiction short stories

2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:28.480
 and started trying to write some of my own.

2:19:28.480 --> 2:19:36.720
 And there were just classic young adult stories like by Heinlein and the other classic names

2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:37.720
 that you think of.

2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:42.160
 But the Heinlein ones stuck, have stuck with me in a way that the others didn't.

2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:54.440
 What's the greatest science fiction book ever written, just removing your work from consideration?

2:19:54.440 --> 2:19:56.400
 I'm loving torturing you right now.

2:19:56.400 --> 2:19:58.360
 Greatest ever non Stevenson.

2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:02.360
 Do we include fantasy or does it have to be science fiction?

2:20:02.360 --> 2:20:05.560
 Oh, interesting fantasy.

2:20:05.560 --> 2:20:07.600
 Hmm.

2:20:07.600 --> 2:20:09.640
 I did not expect that twist.

2:20:09.640 --> 2:20:13.680
 Uh, well, for in a weird way, they're lumped together in people's minds, right?

2:20:13.680 --> 2:20:17.680
 So they are, but there, but there's also a boundary somehow.

2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:18.680
 Yeah.

2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:20.480
 I'm not sure what that is exactly.

2:20:20.480 --> 2:20:21.480
 Nobody is.

2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:22.480
 It's a mystery.

2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:27.640
 So, I mean, if we do include it, then it's easily the, the Lord of the rings.

2:20:27.640 --> 2:20:34.960
 But, um, I mean, greatness is a interesting quality to, uh, to try to define.

2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:43.240
 Um, and for me, a lot of the, the fun and the joy of such books is, is not in what you'd

2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:46.860
 call greatness, but just storytelling.

2:20:46.860 --> 2:20:53.040
 So I was always a big fan of has have space suit will travel, which is a Heinlein young

2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:54.040
 adult book.

2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:56.480
 It's just, uh, it's just a fun, good read.

2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:01.220
 Um, so, so fun is a big component.

2:21:01.220 --> 2:21:02.220
 Greatness is overrated.

2:21:02.220 --> 2:21:08.040
 Well, I don't know it's overrated, but it's just, you know, it's, it might be underdefined

2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:10.120
 to put it that way.

2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:13.920
 So how space it will travel now, I definitely have to read that one.

2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:14.920
 Yeah.

2:21:14.920 --> 2:21:15.920
 You mentioned Iowa.

2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:20.680
 It was, uh, there a couple of times I got to spend, uh, quite a bit of time with Dan

2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:30.200
 Gabel with Tom Brands who are wrestlers was, uh, is it now wrestling, martial arts, part

2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:35.360
 of your life, any part of your form formation of who you are as a human being?

2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:36.360
 I think so.

2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:45.040
 In a, it was a late, it was a late thing for me, but growing up in Ames, um, Dan Gabel

2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:47.760
 was, uh, a few years older than me.

2:21:47.760 --> 2:21:54.180
 And so sometimes we would go to the arena at the university and watch wrestling meets

2:21:54.180 --> 2:21:58.980
 and um, and this was before his Olympic career.

2:21:58.980 --> 2:22:04.460
 So everyone knew he was the star of that team and that he was the best, but people didn't

2:22:04.460 --> 2:22:07.600
 yet know he was the greatest of all time.

2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:08.600
 You saw Gabe.

2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:14.280
 So that was part, it's, it's funny is, uh, it feels like a small world that you would

2:22:14.280 --> 2:22:20.400
 be in the same space as Dan Gabel a hundred feet away, a little dot on the mat trouncing

2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:23.560
 his opponents, him and him and Chris Taylor.

2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:30.680
 So the other star was this 400 pound plus guy named Chris Taylor who, uh, also went

2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:32.240
 to the Olympics.

2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:38.880
 So yeah, people, you know, he was, he was a no, he was a, uh, athletic hero and wrestling

2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:47.240
 is there's certain States like Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Iowa, where wrestling is the sport because

2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:49.120
 those are States of small towns.

2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:55.640
 And so if you're a small town is if you're like Dan Gabel, uh, and you have to be on

2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:01.320
 a football team with 20 other guys who are not Dan Gabel, then no matter how good you

2:23:01.320 --> 2:23:04.600
 are, your team might, might suck.

2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:11.920
 Uh, but if in a solo thing, you can, you can go to the Olympics.

2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:16.200
 So we did a lot of wrestling in our gym classes in school and I didn't like it.

2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:22.400
 And I think partly it's just that it was so, so competitive and the people who were cared

2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:26.480
 about it really cared about it a lot, you know?

2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:31.300
 And so it was, it was pretty tough and I didn't think I had the right body type.

2:23:31.300 --> 2:23:36.600
 But then when I was, uh, after college, I was in Iowa city for a few years when he was

2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:43.720
 coaching the, that the wrestling team there and the, he won like nine championships out

2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:47.380
 of 10 years, you know, during that, during that time.

2:23:47.380 --> 2:23:53.720
 So he was both the greatest individual wrestler of all time and like the greatest team coach.

2:23:53.720 --> 2:24:02.280
 Um, so I know I've never met him, but we've, uh, he's kind of been like in my sphere of

2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:04.880
 awareness since I was, you know, kind of my whole life.

2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:10.200
 And people would always tell stories about him, like I think he got arrested once for

2:24:10.200 --> 2:24:15.720
 some kind of, I don't know, minor offense in Ames.

2:24:15.720 --> 2:24:17.600
 And so he just basically stayed up all night.

2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:23.320
 He was in this cage in the jail, just stayed up all night doing pull ups on, you know,

2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:24.320
 it sounds about right.

2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:25.320
 Yeah.

2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:30.080
 And, uh, uh, so yeah.

2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:35.980
 So has that been, I mean, I was such an interesting place in the world and wrestling is just part

2:24:35.980 --> 2:24:40.520
 of that story.

2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:41.960
 Is that somewhere in there?

2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:44.860
 Does that resonate deeply with who you are?

2:24:44.860 --> 2:24:48.960
 It was a formative thing for me growing up there for sure.

2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:57.160
 It's just a, uh, you know, uh, uh, or at least used to be a very orderly place, high social

2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:02.200
 capital, very minimal class differences.

2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:08.760
 So like you'd have some people who would drive a Cadillac instead of a Chevy, but, uh, that

2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:09.760
 was it.

2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:11.400
 That was, you know, those were the rich people, right?

2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:20.400
 So, um, and a college town is always a different environment like, uh, you know, Austin, uh,

2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:27.400
 has some of this, um, so it was a pretty kind of utopian, uh, other than the weather and

2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:33.440
 a few other things, uh, environment to, to grow up in the, the martial art I ended up

2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:39.400
 doing is sword stuff, which is interesting because it uses a different feedback loop.

2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:47.040
 So when you're, if you're grappling, everything is through sense of touch and your sense of

2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:50.840
 touch is very old and simple, right?

2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:55.840
 Like earthworms don't have, don't even have eyes, but they can tell when they're being

2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:56.840
 touched, right?

2:25:56.840 --> 2:25:59.480
 So it's very fast.

2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:10.360
 Um, and uh, with, um, with a standoff or like boxing or some kinds of sword fighting, you're,

2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:11.720
 you're not touching the other person.

2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:17.200
 Most of the time, your, your, your visual system is doing something way more, it's doing

2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:23.440
 slam and trying to figure out what the other person is up to.

2:26:23.440 --> 2:26:28.300
 And so, um, that always felt more my speed.

2:26:28.300 --> 2:26:36.040
 So in an Olympic style fencing, you're, it doesn't start really until you're crossing

2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:41.320
 blades with the other person and now you're back to wrestling, you're feeling what they're

2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:43.600
 doing and it's all about that.

2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:50.020
 But some of the older sword arts, um, don't engage the blade that way.

2:26:50.020 --> 2:26:59.440
 You stand off at range and then you make cutting attacks and, um, and, uh, and so, so those

2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:07.080
 are all processed visually and I think I'm more of a slow thinker, so it works for me

2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:08.080
 better.

2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:13.720
 I mean, the same, it has the same, the artistry and the beauty of boxing, I suppose, just

2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:18.680
 like you said, is like, there's no, there's no contact and it's all processed visually

2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:24.080
 and I'm sure there's a dance of its own that, that depends on the characteristic of a sword

2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:25.080
 involved.

2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:26.080
 Yeah.

2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:31.240
 There is a set of, of stances and, and, uh, basic reactions that you try to learn that

2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:37.400
 are thought to be defensible, um, and, and safe or safer.

2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:43.440
 And so it tends to be a series of short engagements where you'll, you'll close in, you'll try

2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:50.960
 out your, your idea and it works or it doesn't, then you, you back off again.

2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:56.360
 It's interesting to think about like human history because martial arts, okay, that's

2:27:56.360 --> 2:27:57.680
 a thing.

2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:07.040
 But in terms of sword fighting, just the full range of humans that existed who mastered

2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:11.840
 sword fighting or sought the mastery of sword fighting, just to imagine the thousands of

2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:18.480
 people who, the heights they have achieved because the stakes are so incredibly high

2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:19.760
 to be good.

2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:27.280
 And it's the richest, most powerful people in those societies spending whatever it takes

2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:33.060
 to get the best gear and the best training because you're right, everything depends on

2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:34.060
 it.

2:28:34.060 --> 2:28:35.060
 And it's still life and death.

2:28:35.060 --> 2:28:43.440
 I mean, that, that's fascinating, um, that, that's fascinating and we perhaps have lost

2:28:43.440 --> 2:28:46.280
 that forever with greater weapons.

2:28:46.280 --> 2:28:52.400
 I mean, the artistry of sword fighting when it's life and death and you go into war, you

2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:54.960
 have the Miyamoto Musashi's of the world, right?

2:28:54.960 --> 2:29:02.040
 The, I don't know, there's a, there's a poetry to that, that there's a mastery to that that

2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:05.640
 I don't know if we could achieve with any other kind of martial art.

2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:11.720
 Well the, one of the good, you were talking earlier about the, the, the good effects of

2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:15.680
 the internet, social media that we sometimes overlook.

2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:20.680
 And, and one of those is that, um, there were all these isolated people around the world

2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:26.960
 who were interested in this, who found each other and kind of created a network of, of

2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:28.960
 people who help each other learn these things.

2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:35.000
 So that doesn't mean that anyone is, is up to the level of the you're talking about yet,

2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:44.840
 but um, but it is happening and um, and so, um, there's a, a, a large number of old treatises,

2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:50.180
 old written documents, uh, that have been dug up from libraries and, and people have

2:29:50.180 --> 2:29:57.280
 been going over these and translating them from old dialects of Italian and German, um,

2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:03.600
 to make sense of them and, and learning how to do these techniques with different, uh,

2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:04.600
 different weapons.

2:30:04.600 --> 2:30:11.960
 Um, actually there's a guy here in Austin named Damond Stith who does African, historical

2:30:11.960 --> 2:30:14.120
 African martial arts.

2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:22.800
 Um, also martial arts of, uh, of enslaved Africans who would learn machete fighting

2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:26.200
 techniques in the Caribbean, South America.

2:30:26.200 --> 2:30:28.040
 He's probably within a mile of us.

2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:29.040
 He's an amazing guy.

2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:30.040
 That's awesome.

2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:31.040
 I'm going to look him up.

2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:32.040
 Yeah.

2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:34.240
 Can I ask you for advice?

2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:42.040
 Can you give advice for young people, high school, college, you know, undergrads thinking

2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:48.560
 about their career, thinking about life, how to live a life that you'd be proud of?

2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:53.480
 You think quite a bit about like what it's required to be innovative in this world.

2:30:53.480 --> 2:30:55.120
 You think quite a bit about the future.

2:30:55.120 --> 2:31:00.720
 So if somebody wanted to be a person that makes a big impact from the future, what advice

2:31:00.720 --> 2:31:02.840
 would you give them?

2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:12.280
 I think a big part of it is finding the thing that you will do happily and, um, I don't

2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:17.720
 want to say obsessively because that sounds like maybe it's pathological, but, but if

2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:22.560
 you can find a thing that you'll, you know, you'll sit down, you'll start doing it and

2:31:22.560 --> 2:31:27.080
 hours later you kind of snap out of it, where did the time go?

2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:35.720
 Um, then, um, that's a really key discovery for anyone to make about themselves when they're

2:31:35.720 --> 2:31:36.720
 young.

2:31:36.720 --> 2:31:42.800
 Uh, because if you don't have that, um, it's hard to, uh, to figure out where you should

2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:48.400
 put your energies, you know, and as you might have the best intentions, you might say, I,

2:31:48.400 --> 2:31:56.160
 you know, I want world peace or whatever, uh, but, um, uh, at, at the end of the day,

2:31:56.160 --> 2:32:01.560
 what really matters is how do you spend your time and, and are you spending it in a way

2:32:01.560 --> 2:32:09.880
 that's productive, uh, and, um, uh, because it doesn't matter how smart you are or well

2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:13.880
 intentioned you are unless you've figured that out.

2:32:13.880 --> 2:32:18.640
 And so it's finding the thing in which you can sort of, you naturally lose yourself in.

2:32:18.640 --> 2:32:25.960
 The thing is, um, at least for me, there's a lot of things like that, but I first have

2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:31.140
 to overcome the initial hump of really sucking at that thing.

2:32:31.140 --> 2:32:36.000
 Like the fun starts a little bit after the first hump of really sucking and then you

2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:37.960
 could suck just regular.

2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:38.960
 Yeah.

2:32:38.960 --> 2:32:39.960
 Okay.

2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:42.800
 So often people, oftentimes people can give up too early, I think.

2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:48.260
 I mean, that's true with mathematics for me, it's for a lot of people is if you just give

2:32:48.260 --> 2:32:54.320
 it a chance to struggle, if you give yourself time to struggle, you'll find a way, you'll

2:32:54.320 --> 2:32:58.720
 find the thing within that thing that you can lose track of time with.

2:32:58.720 --> 2:32:59.720
 Yeah.

2:32:59.720 --> 2:33:06.200
 That's a key detail that, um, that's an important thing to add to, to what I said, which is

2:33:06.200 --> 2:33:10.920
 that, uh, this might not happen the first time you do a thing.

2:33:10.920 --> 2:33:17.880
 Maybe it will, but, um, uh, you might have to climb that learning curve and, um, if there's

2:33:17.880 --> 2:33:24.080
 pressures in your life that are making you feel bad about that, then, um, it might prevent

2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:28.760
 you from, from getting where you need to be.

2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:35.800
 Um, so there's some complexity there, uh, that make, can make this kind of non obvious.

2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:42.400
 Um, but, uh, that's what, that's why we need, you know, good teachers.

2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:49.520
 Um, you know, another beneficial thing, uh, of the internet is YouTube and being able

2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:56.360
 to learn things, how to do things on YouTube, the, the, the dude who made the YouTube video

2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:03.160
 doesn't care how many times you hit pause and rewind, um, they're never going to like

2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:07.320
 roll their eyes and, and be impatient with you.

2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:15.760
 Um, and sometimes, uh, spending a huge amount of time on one video or one book, like making

2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:21.320
 that the thing you just spent a huge amount of time on rereading, rereading, or rewatching,

2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:30.160
 rewatching that, that somehow really, um, solidifies your love for that thing.

2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:34.160
 And like the depth of understanding you start to gain and it's okay to stay with that.

2:34:34.160 --> 2:34:39.120
 I used to think like, there's all these books out there, so like, I need to keep reading

2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:40.120
 or keep reading.

2:34:40.120 --> 2:34:48.480
 But then I realized, um, I think it was somewhere in college, uh, uh, where you could just spend

2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:50.960
 your whole life with a single textbook.

2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:55.080
 There's nothing in that textbook to really, really stay.

2:34:55.080 --> 2:35:00.360
 Meisner, Thorne and Wheeler, Gravitation, you know, is, is one of those, or another one is,

2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:06.160
 um, The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose, which is just incredibly deep and it starts

2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:12.040
 with like two plus two equals four and it, at the end you're at the boundaries of, of

2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:13.040
 physics.

2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:17.600
 Uh, it's an amazing, amazing book.

2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:19.720
 Let me ask you the big ridiculous question.

2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:20.720
 Okay.

2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:25.320
 You've pondered some big ridiculous questions in your work.

2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:27.480
 What's the meaning of this whole thing?

2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:28.480
 What's the meaning of life?

2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:29.480
 Wow.

2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:30.960
 Human life.

2:35:30.960 --> 2:35:37.600
 Well, as far as I know, we're unique in the, the universe.

2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:41.800
 There's no evidence that there's anything else in the universe that's as complicated

2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:44.040
 as what's between our ears.

2:35:44.040 --> 2:35:45.040
 Might be.

2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:53.920
 I can't rule it out, but, um, so we appear to be pretty special and, um, so it's got

2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:59.960
 to have something to do with that and one of the reasons I like David Deutsch, in particular

2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:06.360
 his book, The Beginning of Infinity, um, is that he talks about the power of explanations

2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:14.240
 and the fact that, um, most civilizations are static that they've got a set of dogmas

2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:21.800
 that they arrive at somehow and they just pass those on from one, uh, generation to

2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:24.520
 the next and nothing changes.

2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:32.000
 But that huge changes have happened when people sort of follow whatever you want to call it,

2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:38.280
 the scientific method or enlightenment, uh, there's different ways of thinking about it,

2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:45.160
 but basically explanatory, it's, it's about the power of, of explanations and being able

2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:52.440
 to figure out why things are the way they are and that has created changes in our, um,

2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:58.620
 thinking and our way of life over the last few centuries that are explosive compared

2:36:58.620 --> 2:37:05.740
 to anything that came before and David sort of verges on classifying this as like a force

2:37:05.740 --> 2:37:10.760
 of nature in its potential transformative power.

2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:17.720
 If we keep going, um, you know, we could, uh, you know, if we figure out how to colonize

2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:25.080
 the universe like you were talking about earlier, how to spread to other star systems, um, then

2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:29.520
 it is effectively a force of nature.

2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:34.520
 This kind of drive to understand more and more and more, deeper and deeper and deeper

2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:37.640
 and to engineer stuff so that we can understand even more.

2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:38.640
 Yeah.

2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:39.640
 Yeah.

2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:43.960
 It's the, well, it's the old, the universe created us to understand itself.

2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:46.920
 Maybe that's the, uh, the whole purpose.

2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:47.920
 Yeah.

2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:54.840
 It is an interesting peculiar side effect of the way we've been created is we seem to

2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:56.080
 be conscious beings.

2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:57.400
 We seem to have little egos.

2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:01.360
 We seem to, uh, be born and die pretty quickly.

2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:03.160
 There's a bunch of drama.

2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.360
 We're all within ourselves pretty unique and we fall in love and start wars and there's

2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:12.720
 hate and all the, the full interesting dynamic of it.

2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:19.040
 So it's not just about the individual people, somehow like the concert that we played together.

2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:20.040
 Yeah.

2:38:20.040 --> 2:38:21.040
 Yeah.

2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:22.040
 Yeah.

2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:23.040
 So.

2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:24.040
 That's kind of interesting.

2:38:24.040 --> 2:38:28.200
 And there's a lot of peculiar aspects of that, that, um, I wonder if they're fundamental

2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:33.560
 or just quirks of evolution, whether it's, whether it's death, whether it's love, whether

2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:40.280
 all those things, I wonder if they're, um, from an engineer perspective when we're trying

2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:47.560
 to create that intelligent toaster that listens for the, for the slam door and this, and the

2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:54.960
 smell of burning toast, whether, uh, that toaster should be afraid of death and should

2:38:54.960 --> 2:39:01.200
 fall in love just like we do, you know, you're a fascinating human being.

2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:03.280
