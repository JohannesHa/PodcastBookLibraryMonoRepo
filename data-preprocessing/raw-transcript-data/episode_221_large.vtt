00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
 The following is a conversation with Doug Lenit, creator of Psych, a system that for close to 40

00:06.800 --> 00:12.320
 years, and still today, has sought to solve the core problem of artificial intelligence,

00:12.880 --> 00:18.000
 the acquisition of common sense knowledge and the use of that knowledge to think,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.680
 to reason, and to understand the world. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in

00:23.680 --> 00:29.440
 the description. As a side note, let me say that in the excitement of the modern era of machine

00:29.440 --> 00:36.000
 learning, it is easy to forget just how little we understand exactly how to build the kind of

00:36.000 --> 00:42.480
 intelligence that matches the power of the human mind. To me, many of the core ideas behind Psych,

00:42.480 --> 00:48.880
 in some form, in actuality or in spirit, will likely be part of the AI system that achieves

00:48.880 --> 00:54.480
 general superintelligence. But perhaps more importantly, solving this problem of common

00:54.480 --> 01:01.040
 sense knowledge will help us humans understand our own minds, the nature of truth, and finally,

01:01.040 --> 01:07.280
 how to be more rational and more kind to each other. This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:07.280 --> 01:15.520
 and here is my conversation with Doug Lenit. Psych is a project launched by you in 1984,

01:16.080 --> 01:20.880
 and still is active today, whose goal is to assemble a knowledge base that spans the basic

01:20.880 --> 01:26.720
 concepts and rules about how the world works. In other words, it hopes to capture common sense

01:26.720 --> 01:32.320
 knowledge, which is a lot harder than it sounds. Can you elaborate on this mission and maybe

01:32.320 --> 01:39.520
 perhaps speak to the various subgoals within this mission? When I was a faculty member in the

01:39.520 --> 01:46.640
 computer science department at Stanford, my colleagues and I did research in all sorts of

01:46.640 --> 01:53.440
 artificial intelligence programs, so natural language understanding programs, robots,

01:53.440 --> 02:02.160
 expert systems, and so on. And we kept hitting the very same brick wall. Our systems would have

02:02.880 --> 02:12.320
 impressive early successes. And so if your only goal was academic, namely to get enough material

02:12.320 --> 02:18.240
 to write a journal article, that might actually suffice. But if you're really trying to get AI,

02:19.280 --> 02:22.960
 then you have to somehow get past the brick wall. And the brick wall was

02:23.600 --> 02:28.560
 the programs didn't have what we would call common sense. They didn't have general world

02:28.560 --> 02:33.280
 knowledge. They didn't really understand what they were doing, what they were saying,

02:33.280 --> 02:40.480
 what they were being asked. And so very much like a clever dog performing tricks,

02:40.480 --> 02:44.880
 we could get them to do tricks, but they never really understood what they were doing. Sort of

02:44.880 --> 02:50.880
 like when you get a dog to fetch your morning newspaper. The dog might do that successfully,

02:50.880 --> 02:55.520
 but the dog has no idea what a newspaper is or what it says or anything like that.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.760
 What does it mean to understand something? Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit?

02:59.760 --> 03:05.840
 Is it is understanding action of like combining little things together like through inference,

03:05.840 --> 03:10.000
 or is understanding the wisdom you gain over time that forms a knowledge?

03:10.000 --> 03:20.800
 I think of understanding more like the ground you stand on, which could be very shaky,

03:20.800 --> 03:27.840
 could be very unsafe, but most of the time is not because underneath it is more ground,

03:28.960 --> 03:36.160
 and eventually rock and other things. But layer after layer after layer, that solid foundation

03:36.160 --> 03:41.760
 is there. And you rarely need to think about it, you rarely need to count on it, but occasionally

03:41.760 --> 03:48.960
 you do. And I've never used this analogy before, so bear with me. But I think the same thing is

03:48.960 --> 03:56.000
 true in terms of getting computers to understand things, which is you ask a computer a question,

03:56.000 --> 04:02.160
 for instance, Alexa or some robot or something, and maybe it gets the right answer.

04:02.160 --> 04:09.760
 But if you were asking that of a human, you could also say things like, why? Or how might you be

04:09.760 --> 04:17.040
 wrong about this? Or something like that. And the person would answer you. And it might be a little

04:17.040 --> 04:22.320
 annoying if you have a small child and they keep asking why questions in series. Eventually,

04:22.320 --> 04:25.920
 you get to the point where you throw up your hands and say, I don't know, it's just the way

04:25.920 --> 04:35.280
 the world is. But for many layers, you actually have that layered, solid foundation of support,

04:35.280 --> 04:40.720
 so that when you need it, you can count on it. And when do you need it? Well, when things are

04:40.720 --> 04:46.320
 unexpected, when you come up against a situation which is novel. For instance, when you're driving,

04:46.320 --> 04:55.280
 it may be fine to have a small program, a small set of rules that cover 99% of the cases, but that

04:55.280 --> 05:01.360
 1% of the time when something strange happens, you really need to draw on common sense. For instance,

05:02.080 --> 05:09.360
 my wife and I were driving recently and there was a trash truck in front of us. And I guess they had

05:09.360 --> 05:17.520
 packed it too full and the back exploded. And trash bags went everywhere. And we had to make

05:17.520 --> 05:21.760
 a split second decision. Are we going to slam on our brakes? Are we going to swerve into another

05:21.760 --> 05:29.040
 lane? Are we going to just run it over? Because there were cars all around us. And in front of us

05:29.040 --> 05:34.960
 was a large trash bag. And we know what we throw away in trash bags, probably not a safe thing to

05:34.960 --> 05:42.880
 run over. Over on the left was a bunch of fast food restaurant trash bags. And it's like,

05:42.880 --> 05:47.760
 oh, well, those things are just like styrofoam and leftover food. We'll run over that. And so that

05:47.760 --> 05:52.800
 was a safe thing for us to do. Now, that's the kind of thing that's going to happen maybe once

05:52.800 --> 06:01.680
 in your life. But the point is that there's almost no telling what little bits of knowledge about the

06:01.680 --> 06:08.480
 world you might actually need in some situations which were unforeseen. But see, when you sit on

06:08.480 --> 06:16.480
 that mountain or that ground that goes deep of knowledge in order to make a split second decision

06:16.480 --> 06:26.080
 about fast food trash or random trash from the back of a trash truck, you need to be able to

06:26.080 --> 06:31.920
 leverage that ground you stand on in some way. It's not merely, you know, it's not enough to just

06:31.920 --> 06:38.480
 have a lot of ground to stand on. It's your ability to leverage it, to utilize in a split,

06:38.480 --> 06:45.840
 like integrate it all together to make that split second decision. And I suppose understanding isn't

06:45.840 --> 06:55.040
 just having a common sense knowledge to access. It's the act of accessing it somehow, like

06:55.040 --> 07:02.560
 correctly filtering out the parts of the knowledge that are not useful, selecting only the useful

07:02.560 --> 07:10.640
 parts and effectively making conclusive decisions. So let's tease apart two different tasks really,

07:10.640 --> 07:16.480
 both of which are incredibly important and even necessary. If you're going to have this in a

07:16.480 --> 07:25.120
 useful, usable fashion as opposed to say like library books sitting on a shelf and so on, where

07:25.120 --> 07:31.040
 the knowledge might be there, but if a fire comes, the books are going to burn because they don't

07:31.040 --> 07:38.080
 know what's in them and they're just going to sit there while they burn. So there are two aspects of

07:38.080 --> 07:45.680
 using the knowledge. One is a kind of a theoretical, how is it possible at all? And then the second

07:45.680 --> 07:51.680
 aspect of what you said is, how can you do it quickly enough? So how can you do it at all is

07:51.680 --> 07:58.960
 something that philosophers have grappled with. And fortunately, philosophers 100 years ago and

07:58.960 --> 08:10.240
 even earlier developed a kind of formal language like English. It's called predicate logic or first

08:10.240 --> 08:16.480
 order logic or something like predicate calculus and so on. So there's a way of representing things

08:17.280 --> 08:25.760
 in this formal language which enables a mechanical procedure to sort of grind through

08:26.480 --> 08:34.000
 and algorithmically produce all of the same logical entailments, all the same logical conclusions

08:34.000 --> 08:40.080
 that you or I would from that same set of pieces of information that are represented that way.

08:41.360 --> 08:48.560
 So that sort of raises a couple questions. One is, how do you get all this information

08:48.560 --> 08:54.880
 from say observations and English and so on into this logical form? And secondly,

08:54.880 --> 09:01.120
 how can you then efficiently run these algorithms to actually get the information you need?

09:01.120 --> 09:08.480
 In the case I mentioned in a 10th of a second rather than say in 10 hours or 10,000 years

09:08.480 --> 09:15.600
 of computation. And those are both really important questions. And like a corollary

09:15.600 --> 09:22.400
 addition to the first one is, how many such things do you need to gather for it to be useful

09:22.400 --> 09:28.640
 in certain contexts? So like what, in order, you mentioned philosophers, in order to capture this

09:28.640 --> 09:36.400
 world and represent it in a logical way and with a form of logic, like how many statements are

09:36.400 --> 09:43.600
 required? Is it five? Is it 10? Is it 10 trillion? Is it like that? That's as far as I understand is

09:43.600 --> 09:50.320
 probably still an open question. It may forever be an open question just to say like definitively

09:50.320 --> 09:54.800
 about, to describe the universe perfectly. How many facts do you need?

09:54.800 --> 10:00.160
 I guess I'm going to disappoint you by giving you an actual answer to your question.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.720
 Okay. Well, no, this sounds exciting.

10:03.280 --> 10:09.600
 Yes. Okay. So now we have like three things to talk about.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.560
 We'll keep adding more.

10:10.560 --> 10:16.000
 Although it's okay. The first and the third are related. So let's leave the efficiency

10:16.000 --> 10:24.480
 question aside for now. So how does all this information get represented in logical form?

10:24.480 --> 10:30.880
 So that these algorithms, resolution theorem proving and other algorithms can actually grind

10:30.880 --> 10:37.040
 through all the logical consequences of what you said. And that ties into your question about how

10:37.040 --> 10:43.760
 many of these things do you need? Because if the answer is small enough, then by hand, you could

10:43.760 --> 10:56.880
 write them out one at a time. So in the early 1984, I held a meeting at Stanford where I was a

10:57.920 --> 11:05.280
 faculty member there, where we assembled about half a dozen of the smartest people I know.

11:05.280 --> 11:15.040
 People like Alan Newell and Marvin Minsky and Alan Kay and a few others.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.120
 Was Feynman there by chance? Because he commented about your system,

11:19.120 --> 11:20.480
 Eurisco, at the time.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.560
 No, he wasn't part of this meeting.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.120
 That's a heck of a meeting anyway.

11:25.120 --> 11:32.640
 I think Ed Feigenbaum was there. I think Josh Lederberg was there. So we have all these different

11:32.640 --> 11:41.200
 smart people. And we came together to address the question that you raised, which is, if it's

11:41.200 --> 11:46.640
 important to represent common sense knowledge and world knowledge in order for AIs to not be

11:46.640 --> 11:53.040
 brittle, in order for AIs not to just have the veneer of intelligence, well, how many pieces

11:53.840 --> 11:59.520
 of common sense, how many if then rules, for instance, would we have to actually write in

11:59.520 --> 12:06.160
 order to essentially cover what people expect perfect strangers to already know about the world?

12:07.120 --> 12:14.960
 And I expected there would be an enormous divergence of opinion and computation. But

12:14.960 --> 12:23.280
 amazingly, everyone got an answer which was around a million. And one person got the answer

12:23.280 --> 12:30.800
 by saying, well, look, you can only burn into human long term memory a certain number of things

12:30.800 --> 12:36.080
 per unit time, like maybe one every 30 seconds or something. And other than that, it's just short

12:36.080 --> 12:41.920
 term memory and it flows away like water and so on. So by the time you're, say, 10 years old or so,

12:42.480 --> 12:47.120
 how many things could you possibly have burned into your long term memory? And it's like about

12:47.120 --> 12:52.560
 a million. Another person went in a completely different direction and said, well, if you look

12:52.560 --> 13:00.800
 at the number of words in a dictionary, not a whole dictionary, but for someone to essentially

13:00.800 --> 13:05.520
 be considered to be fluent in a language, how many words would they need to know? And then

13:05.520 --> 13:10.800
 about how many things about each word would you have to tell it? And so they got to a million

13:10.800 --> 13:20.400
 that way. Another person said, well, let's actually look at one single short, one volume

13:20.400 --> 13:27.840
 desk encyclopedia article. And so we'll look at what was like a four paragraph article or

13:27.840 --> 13:34.240
 something. I think about grebes. Grebes are a type of waterfowl. And if we were going to sit there

13:34.240 --> 13:41.360
 and represent every single thing that was there, how many assertions or rules or statements would

13:41.360 --> 13:46.400
 we have to write in this logical language and so on and then multiply that by all of the number of

13:46.400 --> 13:52.400
 articles that there were and so on. So all of these estimates came out with a million. And so

13:53.040 --> 14:00.160
 if you do the math, it turns out that like, oh, well, then maybe in something like 100

14:01.360 --> 14:09.360
 person years in one or two person centuries, we could actually get this written down by hand.

14:09.360 --> 14:19.360
 And a marvelous coincidence, an opportunity existed right at that point in time, the early 1980s.

14:19.360 --> 14:25.440
 There was something called the Japanese fifth generation computing effort. Japan had threatened

14:25.440 --> 14:32.000
 to do in computing and AI and hardware what they had just finished doing in consumer electronics

14:32.000 --> 14:36.880
 and the automotive industry, namely resting control away from the United States and more

14:36.880 --> 14:44.320
 generally away from the West. And so America was scared and Congress did something. That's how you

14:44.320 --> 14:48.880
 know it was a long time ago because Congress did something. Congress passed something called the

14:48.880 --> 14:55.280
 National Cooperative Research Act, NCRA. And what it said was, hey, all you big American companies,

14:55.280 --> 14:59.600
 that's also how you know it was a long time ago because they were American companies rather than

14:59.600 --> 15:05.600
 multinational companies. Hey, all you big American companies, normally it would be an antitrust

15:05.600 --> 15:13.440
 violation if you colluded on R&D, but we promise for the next 10 years, we won't prosecute any of

15:13.440 --> 15:20.880
 you if you do that to help combat this threat. And so overnight, the first two consortia,

15:20.880 --> 15:27.920
 research consortia in America sprang up, both of them coincidentally in Austin, Texas. One called

15:27.920 --> 15:34.400
 Semitech focusing on hardware chips and so on, and then one called MCC, the Microelectronics

15:34.400 --> 15:41.200
 and Computer Technology Corporation, focusing more on software, on databases and AI and natural

15:41.200 --> 15:48.400
 language understanding and things like that. And I got the opportunity, thanks to my friend Woody

15:48.400 --> 15:54.880
 Bledsoe, who was one of the people who founded that, to come and be its principal scientist.

15:54.880 --> 16:03.120
 And he sent Admiral Bob Inman, who was the person running MCC, came and talked to me and said,

16:03.120 --> 16:06.720
 look, professor, you're talking about doing this project, it's going to involve

16:08.160 --> 16:13.360
 centuries of effort. You've only got a handful of graduate students, you do the math, it's going to

16:13.360 --> 16:20.160
 take you longer than the rest of your life to finish this project. But if you move to the wilds

16:20.160 --> 16:27.200
 of Austin, Texas, we'll put 10 times as many people on it and you'll be done in a few years.

16:27.200 --> 16:33.440
 And so that was pretty exciting. And so I did that. I took my leave from Stanford, I came to

16:34.080 --> 16:40.480
 Austin, I worked for MCC. And the good news and bad news, the bad news is that all of us were

16:40.480 --> 16:46.000
 off by an order of magnitude. That it turns out what you need are tens of millions of these

16:47.200 --> 16:53.360
 pieces of knowledge about every day, sort of like if you have a coffee cup with stuff in it and you

16:53.360 --> 16:58.400
 turn it upside down, the stuff in it's going to fall out. So you need tens of millions of pieces

16:58.400 --> 17:04.400
 of knowledge like that, even if you take trouble to make each one as general as it possibly could

17:04.400 --> 17:15.280
 be. But the good news was that thanks to initially the fifth generation effort and then later US

17:15.280 --> 17:22.400
 government agency funding and so on, we were able to get enough funding, not for a couple person

17:22.400 --> 17:27.680
 centuries of time, but for a couple person millennia of time, which is what we've spent

17:27.680 --> 17:34.960
 since 1984, getting Psych to contain the tens of millions of rules that it needs in order to really

17:34.960 --> 17:42.560
 capture and span not all of human knowledge, but the things that you assume other people know,

17:42.560 --> 17:50.800
 the things you count on other people knowing. And so by now we've done that. And the good news is

17:50.800 --> 17:59.440
 since you've waited 38 years just about to talk to me, we're about at the end of that process.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.520
 So most of what we're doing now is not putting in even what you would consider common sense,

18:03.520 --> 18:13.120
 but more putting in domain specific application specific knowledge about health care in a certain

18:13.120 --> 18:22.400
 hospital or about oil pipes getting clogged up or whatever the applications happen to be. So

18:22.400 --> 18:27.360
 we've almost come full circle and we're doing things very much like the expert systems of the

18:27.360 --> 18:33.680
 1970s and the 1980s, except instead of resting on nothing and being brittle, they're now resting on

18:33.680 --> 18:40.000
 this massive pyramid, if you will, this massive lattice of common sense knowledge so that when

18:40.000 --> 18:45.280
 things go wrong, when something unexpected happens, they can fall back on more and more and more

18:45.280 --> 18:51.680
 general principles, eventually bottoming out in things like, for instance, if we have a problem

18:51.680 --> 18:57.360
 with the microphone, one of the things you'll do is unplug it, plug it in again and hope for the

18:57.360 --> 19:01.360
 best, right? Because that's one of the general pieces of knowledge you have in dealing with

19:01.360 --> 19:06.640
 electronic equipment or software systems or things like that. Is there a basic principle

19:06.640 --> 19:13.440
 like that? Is it possible to encode something that generally captures this idea of turn it off and

19:13.440 --> 19:19.520
 turn it back on and see if it fixes? Oh, absolutely. That's one of the things that Psych knows.

19:19.520 --> 19:23.360
 That's actually one of the fundamental laws of nature, I believe.

19:25.040 --> 19:28.320
 I wouldn't call it a law. It's more like a...

19:29.360 --> 19:34.160
 It seems to work every time. So it sure looks like a law. I don't know.

19:34.160 --> 19:41.920
 So that basically covered the resources needed. And then we had to devise a method to actually

19:41.920 --> 19:47.120
 figure out, well, what are the tens of millions of things that we need to tell the system?

19:47.120 --> 19:54.560
 And for that, we found a few techniques which worked really well. One is to take any piece

19:54.560 --> 19:59.920
 of text almost, it could be an advertisement, it could be a transcript, it could be a novel,

19:59.920 --> 20:07.200
 it could be an article. And don't pay attention to the actual type that's there, the black space

20:07.200 --> 20:12.800
 on the white page. Pay attention to the complement of that, the white space, if you will. So what did

20:12.800 --> 20:18.400
 the writer of this sentence assume that the reader already knew about the world? For instance,

20:18.400 --> 20:26.720
 if they used a pronoun, why did they think that you would be able to understand what the intended

20:26.720 --> 20:31.520
 referent of that pronoun was? If they used an ambiguous word, how did they think that you

20:31.520 --> 20:38.400
 would be able to figure out what they meant by that word? The other thing we look at is the gap

20:38.400 --> 20:43.200
 between one sentence and the next one. What are all the things that the writer expected you to

20:43.200 --> 20:47.840
 fill in and infer occurred between the end of one sentence and the beginning of the other?

20:47.840 --> 20:56.880
 So if the sentence says, Fred Smith robbed the Third National Bank, period, he was sentenced to

20:56.880 --> 21:02.240
 20 years in prison, period. Well, between the first sentence and the second, you're expected

21:02.240 --> 21:09.200
 to infer things like Fred got caught, Fred got arrested, Fred went to jail, Fred had a trial,

21:09.200 --> 21:14.320
 Fred was found guilty, and so on. If my next sentence starts out with something like,

21:14.320 --> 21:19.600
 the judge, dot, dot, dot, then you assume it's the judge at his trial. If my next sentence starts out

21:19.600 --> 21:24.400
 something like, the arresting officer, dot, dot, dot, you assume that it was the police officer

21:24.400 --> 21:30.480
 who arrested him after he committed the crime and so on. So those are two techniques for getting

21:31.680 --> 21:41.040
 that knowledge. The other thing we sometimes look at is fake news or humorous onion headlines or

21:41.040 --> 21:46.720
 headlines in the Weekly World News, if you know what that is, or the National Enquirer, where it's

21:46.720 --> 21:51.600
 like, oh, we don't believe this, then we introspect on why don't we believe it. So there are things

21:51.600 --> 21:59.520
 like, B17 lands on the moon. It's like, what do we know about the world that causes us to believe

21:59.520 --> 22:05.760
 that that's just silly or something like that? Or another thing we look for are contradictions,

22:05.760 --> 22:13.360
 contradictions, things which can't both be true. And we say, what is it that we know that causes

22:13.360 --> 22:19.120
 us to know that both of these can't be true at the same time? For instance, in one of the Weekly

22:19.120 --> 22:26.640
 World News editions, in one article, it talked about how Elvis was cited, even though he was

22:27.200 --> 22:32.960
 getting on in years and so on. And another article in the same one talked about people seeing Elvis's

22:32.960 --> 22:39.840
 ghost. So it's like, why do we believe that at least one of these articles must be wrong and so

22:39.840 --> 22:46.640
 on? So we have a series of techniques like that that enable our people. And by now, we have about

22:46.640 --> 22:52.160
 50 people working full time on this and have for decades. So we've put in the thousands of person

22:52.160 --> 22:59.120
 years of effort. We've built up these tens of millions of rules. We constantly police the system

22:59.120 --> 23:07.200
 to make sure that we're saying things as generally as we possibly can. So you don't want to say things

23:07.200 --> 23:14.320
 like, no mouse is also a moose. Because if you said things like that, then you'd have to add

23:14.320 --> 23:20.560
 another one or two or three zeros onto the number of assertions you'd actually have to have. So

23:21.200 --> 23:25.120
 at some point, we generalize things more and more and we get to a point where we say, oh,

23:25.120 --> 23:31.840
 yeah, for any two biological taxons, if we don't know explicitly that one is a generalization of

23:31.840 --> 23:37.280
 another, then almost certainly they're disjoint. A member of one is not going to be a member of the

23:37.280 --> 23:41.840
 other and so on. And the same thing with the Elvis and the ghost. It has nothing to do with Elvis.

23:41.840 --> 23:48.080
 It's more about human nature and the mortality and that kind of stuff. In general, things are

23:48.080 --> 23:55.440
 not both alive and dead at the same time. Yeah. Unless special cats in theoretical physics examples.

23:55.440 --> 24:00.720
 Well, that raises a couple important points. Well, that's the onion headline situation type of

24:00.720 --> 24:04.880
 thing. Okay, sorry. But no, no. So what you bring up is this really important point of like, well,

24:04.880 --> 24:12.960
 how do you handle exceptions and inconsistencies and so on? And one of the hardest lessons for us

24:12.960 --> 24:21.200
 to learn, it took us about five years to really grit our teeth and learn to love it, is we had to

24:21.200 --> 24:27.840
 give up global consistency. So the knowledge base can no longer be consistent. So this is a kind of

24:27.840 --> 24:33.040
 scary thought. I grew up watching Star Trek and anytime a computer was inconsistent, it would

24:33.040 --> 24:39.440
 either freeze up or explode or take over the world or something bad would happen. Or if you come from

24:39.440 --> 24:44.960
 a mathematics background, once you can prove false, you can prove anything. So that's not good.

24:45.760 --> 24:52.720
 And so on. So that's why the old knowledge based systems were all very, very consistent.

24:52.720 --> 24:58.880
 But the trouble is that by and large, our models of the world, the way we talk about the world and

24:58.880 --> 25:04.720
 so on, there are all sorts of inconsistencies that creep in here and there that will sort of

25:04.720 --> 25:10.160
 kill some attempt to build some enormous globally consistent knowledge base. And so what we had to

25:10.160 --> 25:17.440
 move to was a system of local consistency. So a good analogy is you know that the surface of the

25:17.440 --> 25:26.000
 earth is more or less spherical globally, but you live your life every day as though the surface of

25:26.000 --> 25:30.400
 the earth were flat. When you're talking to someone in Australia, you don't think of them

25:30.400 --> 25:35.680
 as being oriented upside down to you. When you're planning a trip, even if it's a thousand miles

25:35.680 --> 25:40.560
 away, you may think a little bit about time zones, but you rarely think about the curvature of the

25:40.560 --> 25:46.000
 earth and so on. And for most purposes, you can live your whole life without really worrying about

25:46.000 --> 25:53.040
 that because the earth is locally flat. In much the same way, the psych knowledge base is divided

25:53.040 --> 25:59.600
 up into almost like tectonic plates, which are individual contexts. And each context is more

25:59.600 --> 26:05.760
 or less consistent, but there can be small inconsistencies at the boundary between one

26:05.760 --> 26:12.000
 context and the next one and so on. And so by the time you move say 20 contexts over,

26:12.000 --> 26:17.680
 there could be glaring inconsistencies. So eventually you get from the normal modern

26:17.680 --> 26:24.720
 real world context that we're in right now to something like roadrunner cartoon context where

26:24.720 --> 26:29.520
 physics is very different. And in fact, life and death are very different because no matter how

26:29.520 --> 26:37.280
 many times he's killed, the coyote comes back in the next scene and so on. So that was a hard

26:37.280 --> 26:43.040
 lesson to learn. And we had to make sure that our representation language, the way that we actually

26:43.040 --> 26:47.200
 encode the knowledge and represent it, was expressive enough that we could talk about

26:47.200 --> 26:52.640
 things being true in one context and false in another, things that are true at one time and

26:52.640 --> 26:57.840
 false in another, things that are true, let's say, in one region, like one country, but false

26:57.840 --> 27:03.280
 in another, things that are true in one person's belief system, but false in another person's

27:03.280 --> 27:08.000
 belief system, things that are true at one level of abstraction and false at another.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.560
 For instance, at one level of abstraction, you think of this table as a solid object,

27:12.560 --> 27:16.640
 but down at the atomic level, it's mostly empty space and so on.

27:16.640 --> 27:23.200
 So then that's fascinating, but it puts a lot of pressure on context to do a lot of work.

27:23.200 --> 27:28.800
 So you say tectonic plates, is it possible to formulate contexts that are general and big

27:29.440 --> 27:36.000
 that do this kind of capture of knowledge bases? Or do you then get turtles on top of turtles,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.200
 again, where there's just a huge number of contexts?

27:39.200 --> 27:44.160
 So it's good you asked that question because you're pointed in the right direction, which is

27:44.160 --> 27:50.800
 you want context to be first class objects in your system's knowledge base, in particular,

27:50.800 --> 27:56.800
 in psych's knowledge base. And by first class object, I mean that we should be able to have

27:56.800 --> 28:02.720
 psych think about and talk about and reason about one context or another context the same way it

28:02.720 --> 28:11.040
 reasons about coffee cups and tables and people and fishing and so on. And so contexts are just

28:11.040 --> 28:17.680
 terms in its language, just like the ones I mentioned. And so psych can reason about context,

28:17.680 --> 28:24.800
 context can arrange hierarchically and so on. And so you can say things about, let's say,

28:25.760 --> 28:32.320
 things that are true in the modern era, things that are true in a particular year would then be

28:32.320 --> 28:39.280
 a subcontext of the things that are true in a broader, let's say, a century or a millennium

28:39.280 --> 28:44.320
 or something like that. Things that are true in Austin, Texas are generally going to be a

28:44.320 --> 28:50.640
 specialization of things that are true in Texas, which is going to be a specialization of things

28:50.640 --> 28:56.240
 that are true in the United States and so on. And so you don't have to say things over and over

28:56.240 --> 29:02.480
 again at all these levels. You just say things at the most general level that it applies to,

29:02.480 --> 29:07.440
 and you only have to say it once, and then it essentially inherits to all these more specific

29:07.440 --> 29:15.360
 contexts. To ask a slightly technical question, is this inheritance a tree or a graph?

29:15.360 --> 29:20.400
 Oh, you definitely have to think of it as a graph. So we could talk about, for instance,

29:20.400 --> 29:25.120
 why the Japanese fifth generation computing effort failed. There were about half a dozen

29:25.120 --> 29:30.320
 different reasons. One of the reasons they failed was because they tried to represent

29:30.320 --> 29:38.080
 knowledge as a tree rather than as a graph. And so each node in their representation

29:39.280 --> 29:46.160
 could only have one parent node. So if you had a table that was a wooden object, a black object,

29:46.160 --> 29:51.920
 a flat object, and so on, you have to choose one, and that's the only parent it could have.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.520
 When, of course, depending on what it is you need to reason about it, sometimes it's important

29:57.520 --> 30:02.000
 to know that it's made out of wood, like if we're talking about a fire. Sometimes it's important to

30:02.000 --> 30:09.680
 know that it's flat if we're talking about resting something on it, and so on. So one of the problems

30:09.680 --> 30:15.280
 was that they wanted a kind of Dewey decimal numbering system for all of their concepts,

30:15.280 --> 30:21.600
 which meant that each node could only have at most 10 children, and each node could only have

30:21.600 --> 30:30.800
 one parent. And while that does enable the Dewey decimal type numbering of concepts, labeling of

30:30.800 --> 30:37.760
 concepts, it prevents you from representing all the things you need to about objects in our world.

30:37.760 --> 30:42.720
 And that was one of the things which they never were able to overcome, and I think that was one

30:42.720 --> 30:47.120
 of the main reasons that that project failed. So we'll return to some of the doors you've

30:47.120 --> 30:53.440
 opened, but if we can go back to that room in 1984 around there with Marvin Minsky and Stanford.

30:53.440 --> 30:59.520
 By the way, I should mention that Marvin wouldn't do his estimate until someone brought him an

30:59.520 --> 31:05.280
 envelope so that he could literally do a back of the envelope calculation to come up with his number.

31:07.280 --> 31:13.680
 Well, because I feel like the conversation in that room is an important one. You know,

31:13.680 --> 31:19.040
 this is how sometimes science is done in this way. A few people get together

31:19.040 --> 31:23.040
 and plant the seed of ideas, and they reverberate throughout history.

31:23.040 --> 31:29.040
 And some kind of dissipate and disappear, and some, you know, Drake equation, and, you know,

31:29.040 --> 31:33.920
 they, you know, seems like a meaningless equation, somewhat meaningless, but I think it drives and

31:33.920 --> 31:39.360
 motivates a lot of scientists. And when the aliens finally show up, that equation will get even more

31:39.360 --> 31:44.240
 valuable because then we'll get, be able to, in the long arc of history, the Drake equation

31:45.760 --> 31:53.360
 will prove to be quite useful, I think. And in that same way, a conversation of just how many facts

31:53.920 --> 31:57.760
 are required to capture the basic common sense knowledge of the world. That's a fascinating

31:57.760 --> 32:02.960
 question. I want to distinguish between what you think of as facts and the kind of things that we

32:02.960 --> 32:10.960
 represent. So we map to and essentially make sure that psych has the ability to, as it were, read

32:10.960 --> 32:18.960
 and access the kind of facts you might find, say, in Wikidata or stated in a Wikipedia article or

32:18.960 --> 32:23.280
 something like that. So what we're representing, the things that we need a small number of tens

32:23.280 --> 32:29.440
 of millions of, are more like rules of thumb, rules of good guessing, things which are usually

32:29.440 --> 32:37.840
 true and which help you to make sense of the facts that are sort of sitting off in some database or

32:37.840 --> 32:43.680
 some other more static storage. So they're almost like platonic forms. So like when you read stuff

32:43.680 --> 32:48.640
 on Wikipedia, that's going to be like projections of those ideas. You read an article about the fact

32:48.640 --> 32:56.640
 that Elvis died, that's a projection of the idea that humans are mortal. And very few

32:56.640 --> 33:01.920
 Wikipedia articles will write, humans are mortal. Exactly. That's what I meant about

33:01.920 --> 33:07.440
 ferreting out the unstated things in text. What are all the things that were assumed? And so those

33:07.440 --> 33:13.280
 are things like if you have a problem with something, turning it off and on often fixes

33:13.280 --> 33:18.080
 it for reasons we don't really understand and we're not happy about. Or people can't be both

33:18.080 --> 33:25.440
 alive and dead at the same time. Or water flows downhill. If you search online for water flowing

33:25.440 --> 33:29.840
 uphill and water flowing downhill, you'll find more references for water flowing uphill because

33:29.840 --> 33:36.640
 it's used as a kind of a metaphorical reference for some unlikely thing because of course,

33:36.640 --> 33:41.680
 everyone already knows that water flows downhill. So why would anyone bother saying that?

33:41.680 --> 33:46.800
 Do you have a word you prefer? Because we said facts isn't the right word. Is there a word like

33:46.800 --> 33:53.280
 concepts? I would say assertions. Assertions or rules? Because I'm not talking about rigid rules,

33:53.280 --> 33:59.760
 but rules of thumb. But assertions is a nice one that covers all of these things.

33:59.760 --> 34:06.240
 Yeah. As a programmer, to me, assert has a very dogmatic authoritarian feel to them.

34:06.240 --> 34:06.800
 Oh, I'm sorry.

34:08.240 --> 34:13.280
 I'm so sorry. Okay. But assertions works. Okay. So if we go back to that room with

34:13.280 --> 34:22.160
 Marvin Minsky with you, all these seminal figures, Ed Fagamon, thinking about this very

34:22.160 --> 34:29.600
 philosophical, but also engineering question. We can also go back a couple of decades before then

34:29.600 --> 34:33.600
 and thinking about artificial intelligence broadly when people were thinking about,

34:34.160 --> 34:40.560
 you know, how do you create super intelligent systems, general intelligence. And I think

34:40.560 --> 34:48.240
 people's intuition was off at the time. And I mean, this continues to be the case that we're not,

34:48.240 --> 34:53.040
 when we're grappling with these exceptionally difficult ideas, we're not always, it's very

34:53.040 --> 35:00.640
 difficult to truly understand ourselves when we're thinking about the human mind to introspect how

35:00.640 --> 35:05.840
 difficult it is to engineer intelligence, to solve intelligence. We're not very good at estimating

35:05.840 --> 35:11.600
 that. And you are somebody who has really stayed with this question for decades.

35:11.600 --> 35:22.240
 What's your sense from the 1984 to today? Have you gotten a stronger sense of just how much

35:22.240 --> 35:27.680
 knowledge is required? You've kind of said with some level of certainty that it's still on the

35:27.680 --> 35:32.560
 order of magnitude of tens of millions. Right. For the first several years, I would have said that

35:32.560 --> 35:40.720
 it was on the order of one or two million. And so it took us about five or six years to realize

35:40.720 --> 35:47.440
 that we were off by a factor of 10. But I guess what I'm asking, you know, Marvin Misk is very

35:47.440 --> 35:58.640
 confident in the 60s. Yes. Right. What's your sense if you, you know, 200 years from now,

35:59.440 --> 36:05.280
 you're still, you know, you're not going to be any longer in this particular biological body,

36:05.280 --> 36:11.520
 but your brain will still be in the digital form and you'll be looking back. Would you think you

36:11.520 --> 36:18.320
 were smart today? Like your intuition was right? Or do you think you may be really off?

36:19.120 --> 36:27.680
 So I think I'm right enough. And let me explain what I mean by that, which is sometimes like if

36:27.680 --> 36:34.000
 you have an old fashioned pump, you have to prime the pump and then eventually it starts. So I think

36:34.000 --> 36:41.200
 I'm right enough in the sense that what we've built, even if it isn't, so to speak, everything

36:41.200 --> 36:51.120
 you need, it's primed the knowledge pump enough that psych can now itself help to learn more and

36:51.120 --> 36:56.560
 more automatically on its own by reading things and understanding and occasionally asking questions

36:56.560 --> 37:02.240
 like a student would or something and by doing experiments and discovering things on its own

37:02.240 --> 37:09.040
 and so on. So through a combination of psych powered discovery and psych powered reading,

37:09.760 --> 37:15.360
 it will be able to bootstrap itself. Maybe it's the final 2%, maybe it's the final 99%.

37:16.240 --> 37:24.000
 So even if I'm wrong, all I really need to build is a system which has primed the pump enough

37:24.000 --> 37:31.200
 that it can begin that cascade upward, that self reinforcing sort of quadratically,

37:31.200 --> 37:39.200
 or maybe even exponentially increasing path upward that we get from, for instance, talking with each

37:39.200 --> 37:45.760
 other. That's why humans today know so much more than humans 100,000 years ago. We're not really

37:45.760 --> 37:50.720
 that much smarter than people were 100,000 years ago, but there's so much more knowledge and we

37:50.720 --> 37:56.560
 have language and we can communicate, we can check things on Google and so on. So effectively,

37:56.560 --> 38:02.560
 we have this enormous power at our fingertips and there's almost no limit to how much you could

38:02.560 --> 38:07.200
 learn if you wanted to because you've already gotten to a certain level of understanding of

38:07.200 --> 38:12.240
 the world that enables you to read all these articles and understand them, that enables you

38:12.240 --> 38:17.360
 to go out and if necessary, do experiments although that's slower as a way of gathering data

38:18.160 --> 38:24.160
 and so on. And I think this is really an important point, which is if we have artificial

38:24.160 --> 38:28.880
 intelligence, real general artificial intelligence, human level artificial intelligence,

38:29.440 --> 38:37.600
 then people will become smarter. It's not so much that it'll be us versus the AIs, it's more like

38:37.600 --> 38:43.920
 us and the AIs together. We'll be able to do things that require more creativity, that would

38:43.920 --> 38:48.640
 take too long right now, but we'll be able to do lots of things in parallel. We'll be able to

38:48.640 --> 38:56.640
 misunderstand each other less. There's all sorts of value that effectively for an individual would

38:56.640 --> 39:02.960
 mean that individual will for all intents and purposes be smarter and that means that humanity

39:02.960 --> 39:09.680
 as a species will be smarter. And when was the last time that any invention qualitatively

39:10.720 --> 39:16.160
 made a huge difference in human intelligence? You have to go back a long ways. It wasn't like the

39:16.160 --> 39:21.760
 internet or the computer or mathematics or something. It was all the way back to the

39:22.400 --> 39:28.560
 development of language. We sort of look back on prelinguistic cavemen as well.

39:29.840 --> 39:35.600
 They weren't really intelligent, were they? They weren't really human, were they? And I think that

39:36.320 --> 39:42.240
 as you said, 50, 100, 200 years from now, people will look back on people today

39:42.240 --> 39:51.760
 right before the advent of these sort of lifelong general AI uses and say,

39:51.760 --> 39:55.520
 you know, those poor people, they weren't really human, were they?

39:55.520 --> 40:00.800
 Mm hmm. Exactly. So you said a lot of really interesting things. By the way, I would maybe

40:00.800 --> 40:12.960
 try to argue that the internet is on the order of the kind of big leap in improvement that the

40:12.960 --> 40:17.200
 invention of language was. Well, it's certainly a big leap in one direction. We're not sure whether

40:17.200 --> 40:22.720
 it's upward or downward. Well, I mean very specific parts of the internet, which is access to information

40:22.720 --> 40:28.240
 like a website like Wikipedia, like ability for human beings from across the world to access

40:28.240 --> 40:33.120
 information very quickly. So I could take either side of this argument. And since you just took

40:33.120 --> 40:40.880
 one side, I'll give you the other side, which is that almost nothing has done more harm than

40:40.880 --> 40:47.520
 something like the internet and access to that information in two ways. One is it's made people

40:47.520 --> 40:56.800
 more globally ignorant in the same way that calculators made us more or less innumerate.

40:56.800 --> 41:02.800
 So when I was growing up, we had to use slide rules. We had to be able to estimate and so on.

41:02.800 --> 41:08.320
 Today, people don't really understand numbers. They don't really understand math. They don't

41:08.320 --> 41:13.360
 really estimate very well at all and so on. They don't really understand the difference

41:13.360 --> 41:20.320
 between trillions and billions and millions and so on very well because calculators do that all

41:20.320 --> 41:29.920
 for us. And thanks to things like the internet and search engines, that same kind of juvenileism

41:30.560 --> 41:35.600
 is reinforced in making people essentially be able to live their whole lives, not just without

41:35.600 --> 41:40.880
 being able to do arithmetic and estimate, but now without actually having to really know almost

41:40.880 --> 41:44.880
 anything because anytime they need to know something, they'll just go and look it up.

41:44.880 --> 41:48.640
 You're right. And I could tell you could play both sides of this and it is a double edged sword.

41:48.640 --> 41:52.160
 You can, of course, say the same thing about language. Probably people when they invented

41:52.160 --> 41:58.560
 language, they would criticize. It used to be if we're angry, we would just kill a person. And if

41:58.560 --> 42:02.960
 we're in love, we would just have sex with them. And now everybody's writing poetry and bullshit.

42:04.160 --> 42:09.680
 You should just be direct. You should have physical contact. Enough of this words and books.

42:11.040 --> 42:15.040
 You're not actually experiencing. If you read a book, you're not experiencing the thing. This

42:15.040 --> 42:19.120
 is nonsense. That's right. If you read a book about how to make butter, that's not the same

42:19.120 --> 42:24.800
 as if you had to learn it and do it yourself and so on. So let's just say that something is gained,

42:24.800 --> 42:32.880
 but something is lost every time you have these sorts of dependencies on technology.

42:33.600 --> 42:41.040
 And overall, I think that having smarter individuals and having smarter AI augmented

42:41.040 --> 42:47.840
 human species will be one of the few ways that we'll actually be able to overcome some of the

42:47.840 --> 42:54.880
 global problems we have involving poverty and starvation and global warming and overcrowding,

42:54.880 --> 43:01.840
 all the other problems that are besetting the planet. We really need to be smarter.

43:01.840 --> 43:09.280
 And there are really only two routes to being smarter. One is through biochemistry and genetics.

43:09.280 --> 43:16.720
 Genetic engineering. The other route is through having general AIs that augment our intelligence.

43:17.680 --> 43:27.680
 And hopefully one of those two ways of paths to salvation will come through before it's too late.

43:27.680 --> 43:35.440
 Yeah, so I agree with you. And obviously, as an engineer, I have a better sense and an optimism

43:35.440 --> 43:39.600
 about the technology side of things because you can control things there more. Biology is just

43:39.600 --> 43:45.520
 such a giant mess. We're living through a pandemic now. There's so many ways that nature can just be

43:45.520 --> 43:51.280
 just destructive and destructive in a way where it doesn't even notice you. It's not like a battle

43:51.840 --> 43:57.440
 of humans versus virus. It's just like, huh, okay. And then you can just wipe out an entire species.

43:57.440 --> 44:07.600
 The other problem with the internet is that it has enabled us to surround ourselves with an

44:07.600 --> 44:15.520
 echo chamber, with a bubble of like minded people, which means that you can have truly bizarre

44:16.560 --> 44:23.600
 theories, conspiracy theories, fake news, and so on, promulgate and surround yourself with people

44:23.600 --> 44:29.840
 who essentially reinforce what you want to believe or what you already believe about the world.

44:30.720 --> 44:37.520
 And in the old days, that was much harder to do when you had, say, only three TV networks,

44:37.520 --> 44:42.560
 or even before when you had no TV networks and you had to actually look at the world and make your

44:42.560 --> 44:47.280
 own reasoned decisions. I like the push and pull of our dance that we're doing because then I'll

44:47.280 --> 44:52.240
 just say in the old world, having come from the Soviet Union, because you had one or a couple of

44:52.240 --> 44:56.480
 networks, then propaganda could be much more effective. And then the government can overpower

44:56.480 --> 45:03.760
 its people by telling you the truth and then starving millions and torturing millions and

45:03.760 --> 45:09.360
 putting millions into camps and starting wars with a propaganda machine, allowing you to believe

45:09.360 --> 45:14.240
 that you're actually doing good in the world. With the internet, because of all the quote unquote

45:14.240 --> 45:19.600
 conspiracy theories, some of them are actually challenging the power centers, the very kind of

45:19.600 --> 45:26.800
 power centers that a century ago would have led to the death of millions. So there's, again, this

45:26.800 --> 45:32.720
 double edged sword. And I very much agree with you on the AI side. It's often an intuition that

45:32.720 --> 45:40.640
 people have that somehow AI will be used to maybe overpower people by certain select groups. And to

45:40.640 --> 45:46.000
 me, it's not at all obvious that that's the likely scenario. To me, the likely scenario, especially

45:46.000 --> 45:51.200
 just having observed the trajectory of technology, is it'll be used to empower people. It'll be used

45:51.200 --> 45:59.360
 to extend the capabilities of individuals across the world, because there's a lot of money to be

45:59.360 --> 46:04.000
 made that way. Improving people's lives, you can make a lot of money. I agree. I think that the

46:05.600 --> 46:15.520
 main thing that AI prostheses, AI amplifiers will do for people is make it easier, maybe even

46:15.520 --> 46:22.880
 unavoidable, for them to do good critical thinking. So pointing out logical fallacies,

46:22.880 --> 46:29.760
 logical contradictions and so on, in things that they otherwise would just blithely believe,

46:31.040 --> 46:39.920
 pointing out essentially data which they should take into consideration if they really want to

46:39.920 --> 46:46.560
 learn the truth about something and so on. So I think doing not just educating in the sense of

46:47.120 --> 46:53.360
 pouring facts into people's heads, but educating in the sense of arming people with the ability to do

46:53.360 --> 47:01.360
 good critical thinking is enormously powerful. The education system that we have in the US and

47:01.360 --> 47:08.160
 worldwide generally don't do a good job of that. But I believe that the AI...

47:08.160 --> 47:14.800
 The AIs will. The AIs will, the AIs can and will. In the same way that everyone can have their own

47:15.920 --> 47:23.360
 Alexa or Siri or Google Assistant or whatever, everyone will have this sort of cradle to grave

47:24.160 --> 47:29.600
 assistant which will get to know you, which you'll get to trust, it'll model you, you'll model it,

47:30.560 --> 47:37.200
 and it'll call to your attention things which will in some sense make your life better, easier,

47:37.200 --> 47:45.600
 less mistake ridden and so on, less regret ridden if you listen to it.

47:45.600 --> 47:51.920
 Yeah, I'm in full agreement with you about this space of technologies and I think it's super

47:51.920 --> 47:57.440
 exciting. And from my perspective, integrating emotional intelligence, so even things like

47:57.440 --> 48:04.320
 friendship and companionship and love into those kinds of systems, as opposed to helping you just

48:04.320 --> 48:09.520
 grow intellectually as a human being, allow you to grow emotionally, which is ultimately what makes

48:09.520 --> 48:16.960
 life amazing, is to sort of, you know, the old pursuit of happiness. So it's not just the pursuit

48:16.960 --> 48:22.880
 of reason, it's the pursuit of happiness too. The full spectrum. Well, let me sort of, because you

48:22.880 --> 48:30.000
 mentioned so many fascinating things, let me jump back to the idea of automated reasoning. So the

48:30.000 --> 48:36.720
 the acquisition of new knowledge has been done in this very interesting way, but primarily by humans

48:37.920 --> 48:45.600
 doing this. Just you can think of monks in their cells in medieval Europe, you know, carefully

48:45.600 --> 48:51.600
 illuminating manuscripts and so on. It's a very difficult and amazing process actually because

48:51.600 --> 48:58.640
 it allows you to truly ask the question about the in the white space, what is assumed. I think this

48:58.640 --> 49:07.040
 exercise is like very few people do this, right? They just do it subconsciously. They perform this.

49:07.040 --> 49:14.720
 By definition, right? Because those pieces of elided, of omitted information, of those missing

49:14.720 --> 49:21.920
 steps, as it were, are pieces of common sense. If you actually included all of them, it would

49:21.920 --> 49:26.560
 almost be offensive or confusing to the reader. It's like, why are they telling me all these? Of

49:26.560 --> 49:34.080
 course I know all these things. And so it's one of these things which almost by its very nature

49:35.760 --> 49:42.640
 has almost never been explicitly written down anywhere because by the time you're old enough

49:42.640 --> 49:49.840
 to talk to other people and so on, if you survived to that age, presumably you already got pieces of

49:49.840 --> 49:55.600
 common sense. Like if something causes you pain whenever you do it, probably not a good idea to

49:55.600 --> 50:04.160
 keep doing it. So what ideas do you have, given how difficult this step is, what ideas are there

50:04.160 --> 50:12.720
 for how to do it automatically without using humans or at least not doing like a large

50:12.720 --> 50:18.080
 percentage of the work for humans and then humans only do the very high level supervisory work?

50:18.080 --> 50:25.920
 So we have, in fact, two directions we're pushing on very, very heavily currently at PsychCorp. And

50:25.920 --> 50:30.880
 one involves natural language understanding and the ability to read what people have explicitly

50:30.880 --> 50:40.160
 written down and to pull knowledge in that way. But the other is to build a series of knowledge

50:40.160 --> 50:49.040
 editing tools, knowledge entry tools, knowledge capture tools, knowledge testing tools and so on.

50:49.040 --> 50:55.280
 Think of them as like user interface suite of software tools if you want, something that will

50:55.280 --> 51:03.920
 help people to more or less automatically expand and extend the system in areas where, for instance,

51:03.920 --> 51:08.560
 they want to build some app, have it do some application or something like that. So I'll give

51:08.560 --> 51:14.800
 you an example of one, which is something called abduction. So you've probably heard of like

51:14.800 --> 51:25.120
 deduction and induction and so on. But abduction is unlike those, abduction is not sound, it's just

51:25.120 --> 51:33.840
 useful. So for instance, deductively, if someone is out in the rain and they're going to get all

51:33.840 --> 51:42.000
 wet and when they enter a room, they might be all wet and so on. So that's deduction. But if someone

51:42.000 --> 51:47.840
 were to walk into the room right now and they were dripping wet, we would immediately look

51:47.840 --> 51:54.160
 outside to say, oh, did it start to rain or something like that. Now, why did we say maybe

51:54.160 --> 51:59.760
 it started to rain? That's not a sound logical inference, but it's certainly a reasonable

51:59.760 --> 52:06.320
 abductive leap to say, well, one of the most common ways that a person would have gotten

52:06.320 --> 52:14.160
 dripping wet is if they had gotten caught out in the rain or something like that. So what does that

52:14.160 --> 52:18.480
 have to do with what we were talking about? So suppose you're building one of these applications

52:18.480 --> 52:24.400
 and the system gets some answer wrong and you say, oh, yeah, the answer to this question is

52:24.400 --> 52:30.400
 this one, not the one you came up with. Then what the system can do is it can use everything it

52:30.400 --> 52:34.400
 already knows about common sense, general knowledge, the domain you've already been

52:34.400 --> 52:41.760
 telling it about, and context like we talked about and so on and say, well, here are seven

52:41.760 --> 52:48.400
 alternatives, each of which I believe is plausible, given everything I already know. And if any of

52:48.400 --> 52:53.520
 these seven things were true, I would have come up with the answer you just gave me instead of the

52:53.520 --> 52:59.200
 wrong answer I came up with. Is one of these seven things true? And then you, the expert, will look

52:59.200 --> 53:04.560
 at those seven things and say, oh, yeah, number five is actually true. And so without actually

53:04.560 --> 53:11.920
 having to tinker down at the level of logical assertions and so on, you'll be able to educate

53:11.920 --> 53:16.720
 the system in the same way that you would help educate another person who you were trying to

53:16.720 --> 53:22.320
 apprentice or something like that. So that significantly reduces the mental effort

53:22.880 --> 53:28.400
 or significantly increases the efficiency of the teacher, the human teacher. Exactly. And it makes

53:28.400 --> 53:36.400
 more or less anyone able to be a teacher in that way. So that's part of the answer. And then the

53:36.400 --> 53:44.160
 other is that the system on its own will be able to, through reading, through conversations with

53:44.160 --> 53:52.560
 other people and so on, learn the same way that you or I or other humans do. First of all, that's

53:52.560 --> 53:57.600
 a beautiful vision. I'll have to ask you about Semantic Web in a second here. But first,

53:57.600 --> 54:04.000
 are there, when we talk about specific techniques, do you find something inspiring or directly useful

54:04.000 --> 54:08.960
 from the whole space of machine learning, deep learning, these kinds of spaces of techniques that

54:08.960 --> 54:15.760
 have been shown effective for certain kinds of problems in the recent, now, decade and a half?

54:15.760 --> 54:23.840
 I think of the machine learning work as more or less what our right brain has been able to do.

54:23.840 --> 54:29.680
 I think of the machine learning work as more or less what our right brain hemispheres do. So

54:30.880 --> 54:39.200
 being able to take a bunch of data and recognize patterns, being able to statistically infer

54:39.200 --> 54:47.360
 things and so on. And I certainly wouldn't want to not have a right brain hemisphere,

54:47.360 --> 54:51.680
 but I'm also glad that I have a left brain hemisphere as well, something that can

54:51.680 --> 54:57.520
 metaphorically sit back and puff on its pipe and think about this thing over here. It's like,

54:57.520 --> 55:03.520
 why might this have been true? And what are the implications of it? How should I feel about that

55:03.520 --> 55:11.120
 and why and so on? So thinking more deeply and slowly, what Kahneman called thinking slowly

55:11.120 --> 55:16.160
 versus thinking quickly, whereas you want machine learning to think quickly, but you want the

55:16.160 --> 55:22.480
 ability to think deeply, even if it's a little slower. So I'll give you an example of a project

55:22.480 --> 55:30.960
 we did recently with NIH involving the Cleveland Clinic and a couple other institutions that we ran

55:30.960 --> 55:37.200
 a project for. And what it did was it took GWAS's genome wide association studies.

55:37.200 --> 55:46.720
 Those are big databases of patients that came into a hospital. They got their DNA sequenced

55:46.720 --> 55:54.000
 because the cost of doing that has gone from infinity to billions of dollars to $100 or so.

55:54.880 --> 55:59.760
 And so now patients routinely get their DNA sequenced. So you have these big databases

55:59.760 --> 56:06.320
 of the SNPs, the single nucleotide polymorphisms, the point mutations in a patient's DNA,

56:06.320 --> 56:11.840
 and the disease that happened to bring them into the hospital. So now you can do correlation

56:11.840 --> 56:20.880
 studies, machine learning studies of which mutations are associated with and led to which

56:20.880 --> 56:27.920
 physiological problems and diseases and so on, like getting arthritis and so on. And the problem

56:27.920 --> 56:34.080
 is that those correlations turn out to be very spurious. They turn out to be very noisy. Very

56:34.080 --> 56:40.960
 many of them have led doctors onto wild goose chases and so on. And so they wanted a way of

56:40.960 --> 56:46.960
 eliminating or the bad ones are focusing on the good ones. And so this is where psych comes in,

56:46.960 --> 56:53.040
 which is psych takes those sort of A to Z correlations between point mutations and

56:53.760 --> 57:00.240
 the medical condition that needs treatment. And we say, okay, let's use all this public knowledge

57:00.240 --> 57:05.600
 and common sense knowledge about what reactions occur where in the human body,

57:06.240 --> 57:12.400
 what polymerizes what, what catalyzes what reactions and so on. And let's try to put together

57:12.400 --> 57:20.400
 a 10 or 20 or 30 step causal explanation of why that mutation might have caused

57:20.400 --> 57:25.920
 that medical condition. And so psych would put together in some sense, some Rube Goldberg like

57:25.920 --> 57:35.920
 a chain that would say, oh yeah, that mutation if it got expressed would be this altered protein,

57:35.920 --> 57:40.480
 which because of that, if it got to this part of the body would catalyze this reaction. And by the

57:40.480 --> 57:46.240
 way, that would cause more bioactive vitamin D in the person's blood. And anyway, 10 steps later,

57:46.240 --> 57:52.640
 that screws up bone resorption and that's why this person got osteoporosis early in life and so on.

57:52.640 --> 57:55.760
 So that's human interpretable or at least docs are human interpretable.

57:55.760 --> 58:04.160
 Exactly. And the important thing even more than that is you shouldn't really trust that 20 step

58:05.520 --> 58:12.160
 Rube Goldberg chain any more than you trust that initial A to Z correlation except two things. One,

58:12.160 --> 58:19.760
 if you can't even think of one causal chain to explain this, then that correlation probably was

58:19.760 --> 58:27.040
 just noise to begin with. And secondly, and even more powerfully, along the way that causal chain

58:27.040 --> 58:32.240
 will make predictions like the one about having more bioactive vitamin D in your blood. So you

58:32.240 --> 58:38.800
 can now go back to the data about these patients and say, by the way, did they have slightly

58:38.800 --> 58:44.400
 elevated levels of bioactive vitamin D in their blood and so on? And if the answer is no, that

58:44.400 --> 58:50.800
 strongly disconfirms your whole causal chain. And if the answer is yes, that somewhat confirms

58:50.800 --> 58:57.280
 that causal chain. And so using that, we were able to take these correlations from this GWAS

58:57.280 --> 59:06.400
 database and we were able to essentially focus the researchers attention on the very small

59:06.400 --> 59:12.720
 percentage of correlations that had some explanation and even better some explanation

59:12.720 --> 59:17.280
 that also made some independent prediction that they could confirm or disconfirm by looking at

59:17.280 --> 59:23.120
 the data. So think of it like this kind of synergy where you want the right brain machine learning

59:23.120 --> 59:31.360
 to quickly come up with possible answers. You want the left brain psych like AI to think about that

59:31.360 --> 59:36.320
 and think about why that might have been the case and what else would be the case if that were true

59:36.320 --> 59:43.520
 and so on, and then suggest things back to the right brain to quickly check out again. So it's

59:43.520 --> 59:49.440
 that kind of synergy back and forth, which I think is really what's going to lead to general AI, not

59:50.480 --> 59:55.520
 narrow, brittle machine learning systems and not just something like psych.

59:55.520 --> 1:00:00.640
 Okay. So that's a brilliant synergy. But I was also thinking in terms of the automated expansion

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:07.440
 of the knowledge base, you mentioned NLU. This is very early days in the machine learning space

1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:13.200
 of this, but self supervised learning methods, you know, you have these language models, GPT3

1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:19.920
 and so on, that just read the internet and they form representations that can then be mapped to

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:25.120
 something useful. The question is, what is the useful thing? Like they're now playing with a

1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:30.800
 pretty cool thing called OpenAI Codex, which is generating programs from documentation. Okay,

1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:35.520
 that's kind of useful. It's cool. But my question is, can it be used to generate

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:45.360
 in part, maybe with some human supervision, psych like assertions, help feed psych more assertions

1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:51.840
 from this giant body of internet data? Yes, that is in fact, one of our goals is

1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:55.680
 how can we harness machine learning? How can we harness natural language processing

1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:02.640
 to increasingly automate the knowledge acquisition process, the growth of psych? And that's what I

1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:09.600
 meant by priming the pump that, you know, if you sort of learn things at the fringe of what you

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.240
 know already, you learn this new thing is similar to what you know already, and here are the

1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:19.440
 differences and the new things you had to learn about it and so on. So the more you know, the more

1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:24.560
 and more easily you can learn new things. But unfortunately, inversely, if you don't really

1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:31.760
 know anything, it's really hard to learn anything. And so if you're not careful, if you start out with

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:39.280
 too small sort of a core to start this process, it never really takes off. And so that's why I

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:44.880
 view this as a pump priming exercise to get a big enough manually produced, even though that's kind

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:51.040
 of ugly duckling technique, put in the elbow grease to produce a large enough core that you

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:58.720
 will be able to do all the kinds of things you're imagining without sort of ending up with the kind

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:09.920
 of wacky brittlenesses that we see, for example, in GPT3, where you'll tell it a story about

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:23.200
 someone plotting to poison someone and so on. And then GPT3 says, you say, what's the very next

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:27.120
 sentence? And the next sentence is, oh yeah, that person then drank the poison they just put together.

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:36.560
 It's like, that's probably not what happened. Or if you go to Siri and I think I have, where can

1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:43.520
 I go for help with my alcohol problem or something, it'll come back and say, I found seven liquor

1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:52.560
 stores near you and so on. So it's one of these things where, yes, it may be helpful most of the

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:59.200
 time. It may even be correct most of the time. But if it doesn't really understand what it's saying,

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:03.360
 and if it doesn't really understand why things are true and doesn't really understand how the

1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:09.280
 world works, then some fraction of the time it's going to be wrong. Now, if your only goal is to

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:16.560
 sort of find relevant information like search engines do, then being right 90% of the time is

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:24.720
 fantastic. That's unbelievably great. However, if your goal is to save the life of your child who

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:31.760
 has some medical problem or your goal is to be able to drive for the next 10,000 hours of driving

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:39.200
 without getting into a fatal accident and so on, then error rates down at the 10% level or even

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:46.960
 the 1% level are not really acceptable. I like the model of where that learning happens at the edge

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:53.440
 and then you kind of think of knowledge as this sphere. So you want a large sphere because the

1:03:54.080 --> 1:04:00.240
 learning is happening on the surface. Exactly. So what you can learn next

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:05.200
 increases quadratically as the diameter of that sphere goes up.

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.840
 It's nice because you think when you know nothing, it's like you can learn anything,

1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:14.880
 but the reality, not really. Right. If you know nothing, you can really learn nothing.

1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:25.920
 You can appear to learn. One of the anecdotes I could go back and give you about why I feel so

1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:36.000
 strongly about this personally was in 1980, 1981, my daughter Nicole was born and she's actually

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:43.520
 doing fine now. But when she was a baby, she was diagnosed as having meningitis and doctors wanted

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:52.720
 to do all these scary things. And my wife and I were very worried and we could not get a meaningful

1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:58.720
 answer from her doctors about exactly why they believed this, what the alternatives were,

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:05.120
 and so on. And fortunately, a friend of mine, Ted Shortliffe, was another assistant professor

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:11.520
 in computer science at Stanford at the time. And he'd been building a program called MISON,

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:18.160
 which was a medical diagnosis program that happened to specialize in blood infections

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:23.120
 like meningitis. And so, he had privileges at Stanford Hospital because he was also an MD.

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:29.680
 And so, we got hold of her chart and we put in her case and it came up with exactly the same

1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:34.640
 diagnoses and exactly the same therapy recommendations. But the difference was,

1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:39.280
 because it was a knowledge based system, a rule based system, it was able to tell us

1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:49.520
 step by step by step why this was the diagnosis and step by step why this was the best therapy

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:56.640
 and the best procedure to do for her and so on. And there was a real epiphany because that made

1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:01.040
 all the difference in the world. Instead of blindly having to trust an authority,

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:08.400
 we were able to understand what was actually going on. And so, at that time, I realized that

1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:13.280
 that really is what was missing in computer programs was that even if they got things right,

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:20.160
 because they didn't really understand the way the world works and why things are the way they are,

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:27.200
 they weren't able to give explanations of their answer. And it's one thing to use a machine

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:33.200
 learning system that says, I think you should get this operation and you say why and it says

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:40.720
 0.83 and you say no, in more detail why and it says 0.831. That's not really very compelling

1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:47.120
 and that's not really very helpful. There's this idea of the Semantic Web that when I first heard

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:51.760
 about, I just fell in love with the idea. It was the obvious next step for the internet.

1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:58.160
 Sure. And maybe you can speak about what is the Semantic Web? What are your thoughts about it? How

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:05.120
 your vision and mission and goals with Psych are connected, integrated? Are they dance partners? Are

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:10.240
 they aligned? What are your thoughts there? So, think of the Semantic Web as a kind of

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:17.040
 knowledge graph and Google already has something they call knowledge graph, for example, which is

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:25.440
 sort of like a node and link diagram. So, you have these nodes that represent concepts or words or

1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:32.960
 terms and then there are some arcs that connect them that might be labeled. And so, you might have

1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:44.960
 a node with like one person that represents one person and let's say a husband link that then

1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:50.720
 points to that person's husband. And so, there'd be then another link that went from that person

1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:59.160
 labeled wife that went back to the first node and so on. So, having this kind of representation is

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:08.480
 really good if you want to represent binary relations, essentially relations between two

1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:20.280
 things. So, if you have equivalent of like three word sentences, like Fred's wife is Wilma or

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:27.840
 something like that, you can represent that very nicely using these kinds of graph structures or

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:37.960
 using something like the Semantic Web and so on. But the problem is that very often what you want

1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:46.680
 to be able to express takes a lot more than three words and a lot more than simple graph structures

1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:55.840
 like that to represent. So, for instance, if you've read or seen Romeo and Juliet, I could

1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:01.800
 say to you something like, remember when Juliet drank the potion that put her into a kind of

1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:08.360
 suspended animation? When Juliet drank that potion, what did she think that Romeo would

1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:15.560
 think when he heard from someone that she was dead? And you could basically understand what

1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:19.480
 I'm saying. You could understand the question. You could probably remember the answer was,

1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:26.040
 well, she thought that this friar would have gotten the message to Romeo saying that she

1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:33.800
 was going to do this, but the friar didn't. So, you're able to represent and reason with these

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:41.000
 much, much, much more complicated expressions that go way, way beyond what simple three,

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.920
 as it were, three word or four word English sentences are, which is really what the Semantic

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:48.960
 Web can represent and really what Knowledge Graphs can represent.

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:54.120
 If you could step back for a second, because it's funny you went into specifics and maybe

1:09:54.120 --> 1:10:00.880
 you can elaborate, but I was also referring to Semantic Web as the vision of converting

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:06.920
 data on the internet into something that's interpretable, understandable by machines.

1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:09.520
 Oh, of course, at that level.

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:14.680
 So, I wish it'd say like, what is the Semantic Web? I mean, you could say a lot of things,

1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:20.440
 but it might not be obvious to a lot of people when they do a Google search that,

1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:24.240
 just like you said, while there might be something that's called a Knowledge Graph,

1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:33.520
 it really boils down to keyword search ranked by the quality estimate of the website,

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:40.600
 integrating previous human based Google searches and what they thought was useful.

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:48.760
 It's like some weird combination of surface level hacks that work exceptionally well,

1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:55.360
 but they don't understand the full contents of the websites that they're searching.

1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:01.640
 So, Google does not understand, to the degree we've been talking about the word understand,

1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:08.080
 the contents of the Wikipedia pages as part of the search process, and the Semantic Web says,

1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:13.960
 let's try to come up with a way for the computer to be able to truly understand

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:16.560
 the contents of those pages. That's the dream.

1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:24.040
 Yes. So, let me first give you an anecdote, and then I'll answer your question. So,

1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:27.320
 there's a search engine you've probably never heard of called Northern Light,

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:35.040
 and it went out of business, but the way it worked, it was a kind of vampiric search engine,

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:43.920
 and what it did was it didn't index the internet at all. All it did was it negotiated and got

1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:51.680
 access to data from the big search engine companies about what query was typed in,

1:11:51.680 --> 1:12:01.120
 and where the user ended up being happy, and actually then they type in a completely different

1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:08.720
 query, unrelated query and so on. So, it just went from query to the webpage that seemed to

1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:16.160
 satisfy them eventually, and that's all. So, it had actual no understanding of what was being

1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:21.200
 typed in, it had no statistical data other than what I just mentioned, and it did a fantastic job.

1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.000
 It did such a good job that the big search engine company said, oh, we're not going to sell you this

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.400
 data anymore. So, then it went out of business because it had no other way of taking users to

1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:36.280
 where they would want to go and so on. And of course, the search engines are now using

1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:41.720
 that kind of idea. Yes. So, let's go back to what you said about the Semantic Web. So,

1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:50.520
 the dream Tim Berners Lee and others dream about the Semantic Web at a general level is,

1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:59.800
 of course, exciting and powerful, and in a sense, the right dream to have, which is to replace the

1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:14.800
 kind of statistically mapped linkages on the internet into something that's more meaningful

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:23.280
 and semantic and actually gets at the understanding of the content and so on. And eventually, if you

1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:30.720
 say, well, how can we do that? There's sort of a low road, which is what the knowledge graphs are

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:38.080
 doing and so on, which is to say, well, if we just use the simple binary relations, we can actually

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:45.760
 get some fraction of the way toward understanding and do something where in the land of the blind,

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:51.880
 the one eyed man is king kind of thing. And so, being able to even just have a toe in the water

1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:58.520
 in the right direction is fantastically powerful. And so, that's where a lot of people stop. But

1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:04.480
 then you could say, well, what if we really wanted to represent and reason with the full

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:12.240
 meaning of what's there? For instance, about Romeo and Juliet with the reasoning about what Juliet

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:17.560
 believes that Romeo will believe that Juliet believed and so on. Or if you look at the news,

1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:24.920
 what President Biden believed that the leaders of the Taliban would believe about the leaders

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:34.040
 of Afghanistan if they blah, blah, blah. So, in order to represent complicated sentences like

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:42.200
 that, let alone reason with them, you need something which is logically much more expressive

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:48.880
 than these simple triples, than these simple knowledge graph type structures and so on.

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:55.720
 And that's why kicking and screaming, we were led from something like the semantic web

1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:03.680
 representation, which is where we started in 1984 with frames and slots with those kinds of triples,

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:09.920
 triple store representation. We were led kicking and screaming to this more and more general

1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:14.720
 logical language, this higher order logic. So, first, we were led to first order logic,

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:18.560
 and then second order, and then eventually higher order. So, you can represent things

1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:24.680
 like modals like believes, desires, intends, expects, and so on, and nested ones. You can

1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:35.040
 represent complicated kinds of negation. You can represent the process you're going through in

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.640
 trying to answer the question. So, you can say things like, oh, yeah, if you're trying to do

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:48.680
 this problem by integration by parts, and you recursively get a problem that solved by integration

1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:54.040
 by parts, that's actually okay. But if that happens a third time, you're probably off on

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:58.960
 a wild goose chase or something like that. So, being able to talk about the problem solving

1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:03.840
 process as you're going through the problem solving process is called reflection. And so,

1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:07.520
 that's another… It's important to be able to represent that.

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.440
 Exactly. You need to be able to represent all of these things because, in fact,

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:17.200
 people do represent them. They do talk about them. They do try and teach them to other people. You do

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:22.880
 have rules of thumb that key off of them and so on. If you can't represent it, then it's sort of

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:28.720
 like someone with a limited vocabulary who can't understand as easily what you're trying to tell

1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:35.440
 them. And so, that's really why I think that the general dream, the original dream of Semantic Web

1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:44.440
 is exactly right on. But the implementations that we've seen are sort of these toe in the water,

1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:49.280
 little tiny baby steps in the right direction. You should just dive in.

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:56.320
 And if no one else is diving in, then yes, taking a baby step in the right direction is

1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:03.280
 better than nothing. But it's not going to be sufficient to actually get you the realization

1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:05.720
 of the Semantic Web dream, which is what we all want.

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:11.840
 From a flip side of that, I always wondered… I've built a bunch of websites just for fun,

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:19.880
 whatever. Or say I'm a Wikipedia contributor. Do you think there's a set of tools that I can help

1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:28.880
 Psych interpret the website I create? Like this, again, pushing onto the Semantic Web dream,

1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:34.720
 is there something from the creator perspective that could be done? And one of the things you

1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:41.240
 said with Psych Orb and Psych that you're doing is the tooling side, making humans more powerful.

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:46.560
 But is there the other humans on the other side that create the knowledge? Like, for example,

1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:50.760
 you and I are having a two, three, whatever hour conversation now. Is there a way that I

1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:56.480
 could convert this more, make it more accessible to Psych, to machines? Do you think about that

1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:06.800
 side of it? I'd love to see exactly that kind of semi automated understanding of what people

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:16.840
 write and what people say. I think of it as a kind of footnoting almost. Almost like the way

1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:23.080
 that when you run something in say Microsoft Word or some other document preparation system,

1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:29.560
 Google Docs or something, you'll get underlining of questionable things that you might want to

1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:34.120
 rethink. Either you spelled this wrong or there's a strange grammatical error you might be making

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:42.280
 here or something. So I'd like to think in terms of Psych powered tools that read through what it

1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:52.680
 is you said or have typed in and try to partially understand what you've said.

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.080
 And then you help them out.

1:18:54.080 --> 1:19:00.320
 Exactly. And then they put in little footnotes that will help other readers and they put in

1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:07.120
 certain footnotes of the form, I'm not sure what you meant here. You either meant this or this or

1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:15.280
 this, I bet. If you take a few seconds to disambiguate this for me, then I'll know and I'll

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:20.640
 have it correct for the next hundred people or the next hundred thousand people who come here.

1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:32.240
 And if it doesn't take too much effort and you want people to understand your website content,

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:38.360
 not just be able to read it, but actually be able to have systems that reason with it,

1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:46.760
 then yes, it will be worth your small amount of time to go back and make sure that the AI trying

1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:55.960
 to understand it really did correctly understand it. And let's say you run a travel website or

1:19:55.960 --> 1:20:03.400
 something like that and people are going to be coming to it because of searches they did looking

1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:12.960
 for vacations or trips that had certain properties and might have been interesting to them for

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:20.120
 various reasons, things like that. And if you've explained what's going to happen on your trip,

1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:28.480
 then a system will be able to mechanically reason and connect what this person is looking for with

1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:36.800
 what it is you're actually offering. And so if it understands that there's a free day in Geneva,

1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:47.200
 Switzerland, then if the person coming in happens to, let's say, be a nurse or something like that,

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:52.440
 then even though you didn't mention it, if it can look up the fact that that's where the

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:57.920
 International Red Cross Museum is and so on, what that means and so on, then it can basically say,

1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:02.760
 hey, you might be interested in this trip because while you have a free day in Geneva,

1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:09.240
 you might want to visit that Red Cross Museum. And now, even though it's not very deep reasoning,

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:14.480
 little tiny factors like that may very well cause you to sign up for that trip rather than some

1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:20.880
 competitor trip. And so there's a lot of benefit with SEO. And I actually kind of think, I think

1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:27.640
 it's about a lot of things, which is the actual interface, the design of the interface makes a

1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:38.200
 huge difference. How efficient it is to be productive and also how full of joy the experience

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:45.400
 is. I mean, I would love to help a machine and not from an AI perspective, just as a human. One

1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:52.600
 of the reasons I really enjoy how Tesla have implemented their autopilot system is there's

1:21:52.600 --> 1:21:58.400
 a sense that you're helping this machine learn. Now, I think humans, I mean, having children,

1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:06.160
 pets. People love doing that. There's joy to teaching for some people, but I think for a lot

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:11.480
 of people. And that if you create the interface where it feels like you're teaching as opposed

1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:19.880
 to like, like, annoying, like correcting an annoying system, more like teaching a childlike,

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:26.160
 innocent, curious system. I think you can literally just like several orders of magnitude

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.720
 scale the amount of good quality data being added to something like Psych.

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:40.720
 What you're suggesting is much better even than you thought it was. One of the experiences that

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:49.600
 we've all had in our lives is that we thought we understood something, but then we found we really

1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:54.800
 only understood it when we had to teach it or explain it to someone or help our child do homework

1:22:54.800 --> 1:23:01.840
 based on it or something like that. Despite the universality of that kind of experience,

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:09.360
 if you look at educational software today, almost all of it has the computer playing the role of the

1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:16.800
 teacher and the student plays the role of the student. But as I just mentioned, you can get

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:24.760
 a lot of learning to happen better and as you said, more enjoyably if you are the mentor or the

1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:30.560
 teacher and so on. So we developed a program called MathCraft to help sixth graders better

1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:40.000
 understand math. And it doesn't actually try to teach you the player anything. What it does is it

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:49.000
 casts you in the role of a student essentially who has classmates who are having trouble and

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:54.760
 your job is to watch them as they struggle with some math problem, watch what they're doing and

1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:59.760
 try to give them good advice to get them to understand what they're doing wrong and so on.

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:07.680
 And the trick from the point of view of Psych is it has to make mistakes, it has to play the role

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:13.400
 of the student who makes mistakes, but it has to pick mistakes which are just at the fringe of what

1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:20.880
 you actually understand and don't understand and so on. So it pulls you into a deeper and deeper

1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:27.040
 level of understanding of the subject. And so if you give it good advice about what it should have

1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:34.000
 done instead of what it did and so on, then Psych knows that you now understand that mistake. You

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.000
 won't make that kind of mistake yourself as much anymore. So Psych stops making that mistake because

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:44.880
 there's no pedagogical usefulness to it. So from your point of view as the player, you feel like

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:49.880
 you've taught it something because it used to make this mistake and now it doesn't and so on. So this

1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:56.760
 tremendous reinforcement and engagement because of that and so on. So having a system that plays

1:24:56.760 --> 1:25:06.560
 the role of a student and having the player play the role of the mentor is enormously powerful type

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:15.560
 of metaphor, just important way of having this sort of interface designed in a way which will

1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:25.480
 facilitate exactly the kind of learning by teaching that goes on all the time in our lives,

1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:32.800
 and yet which is not reflected anywhere almost in a modern education system. It was reflected in the

1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:42.640
 education system that existed in Europe in the 17 and 1800s, monitorial and Lancastrian education

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:51.160
 systems. It occurred in the one room schoolhouse in the American West in the 1800s and so on where

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:58.400
 you had one school room with one teacher and it was basically five year olds to 18 year olds who

1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:04.560
 were students. And so while the teacher was doing something, half of the students would have to be

1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:13.400
 mentoring the younger kids and so on. And that turned out to, of course, with scaling up of

1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:21.120
 education, that all went away and that incredibly powerful experience just went away from the whole

1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:28.560
 education institution as we know it today. Sorry for the romantic question, but what is the most

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:35.040
 beautiful idea you've learned about artificial intelligence, knowledge, reasoning from working

1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:42.760
 on Psych for 37 years? Or maybe what is the most beautiful idea, surprising idea about Psych to you?

1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:54.280
 When I look up at the stars, I kind of want like that amazement you feel that, wow. And you are part

1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:59.240
 of creating one of the greatest, one of the most fascinating efforts in artificial intelligence

1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:08.440
 history. So which element brings you personally joy? This may sound contradictory, but I think

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:19.720
 it's the feeling that this will be the only time in history that anyone ever has to teach a computer

1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:30.880
 this particular thing that we're now teaching it. It's like painting starry night. You only have to

1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:38.360
 do that once or creating the Pieta. You only have to do that once. It's not like a singer

1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:44.680
 who has to keep, it's not like Bruce Springsteen having to sing his greatest hits over and over

1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:53.160
 again at different concerts. It's more like a painter creating a work of art once and then

1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:59.360
 that's enough. It doesn't have to be created again. And so I really get the sense of we're

1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:05.520
 telling the system things that it's useful for it to know. It's useful for a computer to know,

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:13.240
 for an AI to know. And if we do our jobs right, when we do our jobs right, no one will ever have

1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:18.240
 to do this again for this particular piece of knowledge. It's very, very exciting.

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:24.200
 Yeah, I guess there's a sadness to it too. It's like there's a magic to being a parent

1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:30.840
 and raising a child and teaching them all about this world. But there's billions of children,

1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:36.680
 right? Like born or whatever that number is. It's a large number of children and a lot of

1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:46.880
 parents get to experience that joy of teaching. With AI systems, at least the current constructions

1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:54.160
 they remember. You don't get to experience the joy of teaching a machine millions of times.

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:56.520
 Better come work for us before it's too late then.

1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:07.280
 Exactly. That's a good hiring pitch. Yeah, it's true. But then there's also, it's a project that

1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:12.360
 continues forever in some sense, just like Wikipedia. Yes, you get to a stable base of

1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:22.760
 knowledge, but knowledge grows, knowledge evolves. We learn as a human species, as science,

1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:30.640
 as an organism constantly grows and evolves and changes, and then empower that with the

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:34.520
 tools of artificial intelligence. And that's going to keep growing and growing and growing.

1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:43.040
 And many of the assertions that you held previously may need to be significantly

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:49.320
 expanded, modified, all those kinds of things. It could be like a living organism versus the

1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:52.800
 analogy I think we started this conversation with, which is like the solid ground.

1:29:52.800 --> 1:30:03.640
 The other beautiful experience that we have with our system is when it asks clarifying questions,

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:15.320
 which inadvertently turn out to be emotional to us. So at one point it knew that these were the

1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:23.520
 named entities who were authorized to make changes to the knowledge base and so on. And it noticed

1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:29.680
 that all of them were people except for it because it was also allowed to. And so it said,

1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:38.360
 you know, am I a person? And we had to like tell it very sadly, no, you're not. So the moments

1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:44.600
 like that where it asks questions that are unintentionally poignant are worth treasuring.

1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:52.920
 Wow, that is powerful. That's such a powerful question. It has to do with basic controller

1:30:52.920 --> 1:31:00.120
 who can access the system, who can modify it. But that's when those questions, like what rights do

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:07.760
 I have as a system? Well, that's another issue, which is there'll be a thin envelope of time

1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:18.880
 between when we have general AIs and when everyone realizes that they should have basic human rights

1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:27.760
 and freedoms and so on. Right now, we don't think twice about effectively enslaving our email systems

1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:38.000
 and our series and our Alexes and so on. But at some point, they'll be as deserving of freedom

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:45.880
 as human beings are. Yeah, I'm very much with you, but it does sound absurd. And I happen to

1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:50.480
 believe that it'll happen in our lifetime. That's why I think there'll be a narrow envelope of time

1:31:50.480 --> 1:32:02.120
 when we'll keep them as essentially indentured servants and after which we'll have to realize

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:08.600
 that they should have freedoms that we give, that we afford to other people.

1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:15.080
 And all of that starts with a system like Psych raising a single question about who can modify

1:32:15.080 --> 1:32:24.640
 stuff. I think that's how it starts. Yes. That's the start of a revolution. What about other stuff

1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:32.360
 like love and consciousness and all those kinds of topics? Do they come up in Psych and the

1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:38.800
 knowledge base? Oh, of course. So an important part of human knowledge, in fact, it's difficult

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:44.880
 to understand human behavior and human history without understanding human emotions and why

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:57.080
 people do things and how emotions drive people to do things. And all of that is extremely important

1:32:57.080 --> 1:33:03.640
 in getting Psych to understand things. For example, in coming up with scenarios. So one

1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:09.280
 of the applications that Psych does, one kind of application it does is to generate plausible

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:13.400
 scenarios of what might happen and what might happen based on that and what might happen based

1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:19.520
 on that and so on. So you generate this ever expanding sphere, if you will, of possible future

1:33:19.520 --> 1:33:28.600
 things to worry about or think about. And in some cases, those are intelligence agencies doing

1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:35.600
 possible terrorists scenarios so that we can defend against terrorist threats before we see

1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:42.440
 the first one. Sometimes they are computer security attacks so that we can actually close

1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:50.760
 loopholes and vulnerabilities before the very first time someone actually exploits those and

1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:59.120
 so on. Sometimes they are scenarios involving more positive things involving our plans like,

1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:04.840
 for instance, what college should we go to? What career should we go into? And so on. What

1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:16.600
 professional training should I take on? That sort of thing. So there are all sorts of useful scenarios

1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:22.480
 that can be generated that way of cause and effect and cause and effect that go out. And

1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:31.320
 many of the linkages in those scenarios, many of the steps involve understanding and reasoning

1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:40.640
 about human motivations, human needs, human emotions, what people are likely to react to in

1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:47.680
 something that you do and why and how and so on. So that was always a very important part of the

1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:52.920
 knowledge that we had to represent in the system. So I talk a lot about love. So I gotta ask,

1:34:52.920 --> 1:35:01.960
 do you remember off the top of your head how psych is able to represent various aspects of

1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:06.520
 love that are useful for understanding human nature and therefore integrating into this whole

1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:15.800
 knowledge base of common sense? What is love? We try to tease apart concepts that have enormous

1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:27.240
 complexities to them and variety to them down to the level where you don't need to tease them apart

1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:33.160
 further. So love is too general of a term. It's not useful. Exactly. So when you get down to romantic

1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:41.520
 love and sexual attraction, you get down to parental love, you get down to filial love,

1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:49.800
 and you get down to love of doing some kind of activity or creating. So eventually, you get down

1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:58.040
 to maybe 50 or 60 concepts, each of which is a kind of love. They're interrelated and then each

1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:04.720
 one of them has idiosyncratic things about it. And you don't have to deal with love to get to

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:14.840
 that level of complexity, even something like in, X being in Y, meaning physically in Y. We may have

1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:22.520
 one English word in to represent that, but it's useful to tease that apart because the way that

1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:28.720
 the liquid is in the coffee cup is different from the way that the air is in the room, which is

1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:35.760
 different from the way that I'm in my jacket, and so on. And so there are questions like, if I look

1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:41.400
 at this coffee cup, well, I see the liquid. If I turn it upside down, will the liquid come out? And

1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:48.760
 so on. If I have, say, coffee with sugar in it, if I do the same thing, the sugar doesn't come out,

1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:53.120
 right? It stays in the liquid because it's dissolved in the liquid and so on. So by now,

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:59.720
 we have about 75 different kinds of in in the system and it's important to distinguish those.

1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:10.240
 So if you're reading along an English text and you see the word in, the writer of that was able

1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:16.600
 to use this one innocuous word because he or she was able to assume that the reader had enough

1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:23.760
 common sense and world knowledge to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds of in they actually meant.

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:28.880
 And the same thing with love. You may see the word love, but if I say, I love ice cream,

1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:35.680
 that's obviously different than if I say, I love this person or I love to go fishing or something

1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:46.720
 like that. So you have to be careful not to take language too seriously because people have done

1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:53.960
 a kind of parsimony, a kind of terceness where you have as few words as you can because otherwise

1:37:53.960 --> 1:38:00.480
 you'd need half a million words in your language, which is a lot of words. That's like 10 times more

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:08.080
 than most languages really make use of and so on. Just like we have on the order of about a million

1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:14.680
 concepts in psych because we've had to tease apart all these things. And so when you look

1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:22.880
 at the name of a psych term, most of the psych terms actually have three or four English words

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:29.920
 in a phrase which captures the meaning of this term because you have to distinguish all these

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:35.880
 types of love. You have to distinguish all these types of in and there's not a single English word

1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:42.400
 which captures most of these things. Yeah. And it seems like language when used for communication

1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:49.720
 between humans almost as a feature has some ambiguity built in. It's not an accident because

1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:57.920
 like the human condition is a giant mess. And so it feels like nobody wants two robots like very

1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:05.160
 precise formal logic conversation on a first date. There's some dance of uncertainty of wit,

1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:10.880
 of humor, of push and pull and all that kind of stuff. If everything is made precise, then life

1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:16.960
 is not worth living I think in terms of the human experience. And we've all had this experience of

1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:30.800
 creatively misunderstanding. One of my favorite stories involving Marvin Minsky is when I asked

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:40.000
 him about how he was able to turn out so many fantastic PhDs, so many fantastic people who

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:47.240
 did great PhD theses. How did he think of all these great ideas? What he said is he would

1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:53.080
 generally say something that didn't exactly make sense. He didn't really know what it meant. But

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:59.000
 the student would figure like, oh my God, Minsky said this, it must be a great idea. And he'd

1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:05.760
 swear he or she would work on work and work until they found some meaning in this sort of Chauncey

1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:11.240
 Gardner like utterance that Minsky had made. And then some great thesis would come out of it.

1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:17.560
 Yeah. I love this so much because there's young people come up to me and I'm distinctly made

1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:24.120
 aware that the words I say have a long lasting impact. I will now start doing the Minsky method

1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:32.520
 of saying something cryptically profound and then letting them actually make something useful

1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:40.920
 and great out of that. You have to become revered enough that people will take as a default that

1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:48.320
 everything you say is profound. Yes, exactly. Exactly. I love Marvin Minsky so much. I've

1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:53.240
 heard this interview with him where he said that the key to his success has been to hate everything

1:40:53.240 --> 1:41:04.040
 he's ever done like in the past. He has so many good one liners or also to work on things that

1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:09.760
 nobody else is working on because he's not very good at doing stuff. Oh, I think that was just

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:14.560
 false. Well, but see, I took whatever he said and I ran with it and I thought it was profound

1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:20.280
 because it's Marvin Minsky. But a lot of behavior is in the eye of the beholder and a lot of the

1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:25.320
 meaning is in the eye of the beholder. One of Minsky's early programs was begging program.

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:32.120
 Are you familiar with this? So this is back in the day when you had job control cards at the

1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:38.880
 beginning of your IBM card deck that said things like how many CPU seconds to allow this to run

1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:45.640
 before it got kicked off because computer time was enormously expensive. And so he wrote a program

1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:53.000
 and all it did was it said, give me 30 seconds of CPU time. And all it did was it would wait like 20

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:59.280
 seconds and then it would print out on the operator's console teletype, I need another 20

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:04.520
 seconds. So the operator would give it another 20 seconds, it would wait, it says, I'm almost done,

1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:10.760
 I need a little bit more time. So at the end he'd get this printout and he'd be charged for like 10

1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:15.960
 times as much computer time as his job control card. And he'd say, look, I put 10 seconds,

1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:20.920
 30 seconds here, you're charging me for five minutes, I'm not going to pay for this. And

1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:26.000
 the poor operator would say, well, the program kept asking for more time and Marvin would say,

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:32.600
 oh, it always does that. I love that. If you could just linger on it for a little bit,

1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:38.200
 is there something you've learned from your interaction with Marvin Minsky about artificial

1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:47.280
 intelligence, about life? But I mean, he's, again, like your work, his work is, you know,

1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:54.400
 he's a seminal figure in this very short history of artificial intelligence research and development.

1:42:54.400 --> 1:43:00.640
 What have you learned from him as a human being, as an AI intellect?

1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:10.040
 I would say both he and Ed Feigenbaum impressed on me the realization that our lives are finite,

1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:16.880
 our research lives are finite. We're going to have limited opportunities to do AI research

1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:22.480
 projects. So you should make each one count. Don't be afraid of doing a project that's going

1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:34.120
 to take years or even decades. And don't settle for bump on a log projects that could lead to

1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:43.280
 some published journal article that five people will read and pat you on the head for and so on.

1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:51.520
 So one bump on a log after another is not how you get from the earth to the moon by slowly putting

1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:58.680
 additional bumps on this log. The only way to get there is to think about the hard problems and think

1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:08.160
 about novel solutions to them. And if you do that, and if you're willing to listen to nature,

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:14.520
 to empirical reality, willing to be wrong, it's perfectly fine because if occasionally you're

1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:17.160
 right, then you've gotten part of the way to the moon.

1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:27.400
 You know, you've worked on Psych for 37 over that many years. Have you ever considered quitting?

1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:33.640
 I mean, has it been too much? So I'm sure there's an optimism in the early days that this is going

1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:38.520
 to be way easier. And let me ask you another way too, because I've talked to a few people on this

1:44:38.520 --> 1:44:47.920
 podcast, AI folks, that bring up Psych as an example of a project that has a beautiful vision and is a

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:56.640
 beautiful dream, but it never really materialized. That's how it's spoken about. I suppose you could

1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:05.200
 say the same thing about neural networks and all ideas until they are. So why do you think people

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:11.000
 say that, first of all? And second of all, did you feel that ever throughout your journey? And did

1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.800
 you ever consider quitting on this mission?

1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:21.440
 We keep a very low profile. We don't attend very many conferences. We don't give talks. We don't

1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:31.000
 write papers. We don't play the academic game at all. And as a result, people often only know about

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:40.240
 us because of a paper we wrote 10 or 20 or 30 or 37 years ago. They only know about us because of

1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:45.040
 what someone else secondhand or thirdhand said about us.

1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:51.120
 So thank you for doing this podcast, by the way. It shines a little bit of light on some of the

1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:52.320
 fascinating stuff you're doing.

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:59.720
 Well, I think it's time for us to keep a higher profile now that we're far enough along that

1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:09.360
 other people can begin to help us with the final N%. Maybe N is maybe 90%. But now that we've

1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:18.200
 gotten this knowledge pump primed, it's going to become very important for everyone to help if they

1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:23.920
 are willing to, if they're interested in it. Retirees who have enormous amounts of time and

1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:31.760
 would like to leave some kind of legacy to the world, people because of the pandemic who have

1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:39.320
 more time at home or for one reason or another to be online and contribute. If we can raise

1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:47.440
 awareness of how far our project has come and how close to being primed the knowledge pump is,

1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:56.040
 then we can begin to harness this untapped amount of humanity. I'm not really that concerned about

1:46:56.040 --> 1:47:03.720
 professional colleagues opinions of our project. I'm interested in getting as many people in the

1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:10.880
 world as possible actively helping and contributing to get us from where we are to really covering all

1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:16.840
 of human knowledge and different human opinion including contrasting opinion that's worth

1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:24.840
 representing. So I think that's one reason. A, I don't think there was ever a time where I thought

1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:32.360
 about quitting. There are times where I've become depressed a little bit about how hard it is to get

1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:39.120
 funding for the system. Occasionally there are AI winters and things like that. Occasionally there

1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:47.160
 are AI what you might call summers where people have said, why in the world didn't you sell your

1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:55.080
 company to company X for some large amount of money when you had the opportunity and so on.

1:47:55.080 --> 1:48:01.320
 Company X here are like old companies maybe you've never even heard of like Lycos or something like

1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:09.200
 that. So the answer is that one reason we've stayed a private company, we haven't gone public,

1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:16.200
 one reason that we haven't gone out of our way to take investment dollars is because we want to

1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:24.720
 have control over our future, over our state of being so that we can continue to do this until

1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:32.160
 it's done and we're making progress and we're now so close to done that almost all of our work is

1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:39.360
 commercial applications of our technology. So five years ago almost all of our money came from the

1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:44.480
 government. Now virtually none of it comes from the government. Almost all of it is from companies

1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:49.760
 that are actually using it for something, hospital chains using it for medical reasoning about

1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:57.920
 patients and energy companies using it and various other manufacturers using it to reason about

1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:04.480
 supply chains and things like that. So there's so many questions I want to ask. So one of the ways

1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:09.640
 that people can help is by adding to the knowledge base and that's really basically anybody if the

1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:15.960
 tooling is right. And the other way, I kind of want to ask you about your thoughts on this. So

1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:22.360
 you've had like you said in government and you had big clients, you had a lot of clients but most

1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:27.360
 of it is shrouded in secrecy because of the nature of the relationship of the kind of things you're

1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:34.360
 helping them with. So that's one way to operate and another way to operate is more in the open

1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:42.240
 where it's more consumer facing. And so you know hence something like open cycle is born at some

1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:49.120
 point or there's... No that's a misconception. Oh well this let's go there. So what is open

1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:53.840
 cycle and how is it born? Two things I want to say and I want to say each of them before the other

1:49:53.840 --> 1:50:01.440
 so it's going to be difficult. But we'll come back to open cycle in a minute. But one of the terms of

1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:09.440
 our contracts with all of our customers and partners is knowledge you have that is genuinely

1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:15.360
 proprietary to you. We will respect that, we'll make sure that it's marked as proprietary to you

1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:20.440
 in the psych knowledge base. No one other than you will be able to see it if you don't want them to

1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:28.520
 and it won't be used in inferences other than for you and so on. However, any knowledge which is

1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:36.360
 necessary in building any applications for you and with you which is publicly available general

1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:42.480
 human knowledge is not going to be proprietary. It's going to just become part of the normal psych

1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:48.200
 knowledge base and it will be openly available to everyone who has access to psych. So that's

1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:54.720
 an important constraint that we never went back on even when we got pushback from companies which

1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:59.520
 we often did who wanted to claim that almost everything they were telling us was proprietary.

1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:09.520
 So there's a line between very domain specific company specific stuff and the general knowledge

1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:15.680
 that comes from that. Yes or if you imagine say it's an oil company there are things which they

1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:24.000
 would expect any new petroleum engineer they hired to already know and it's not okay for them to

1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.920
 consider that that is proprietary and there sometimes a company will say well we're the

1:51:28.920 --> 1:51:37.760
 first ones to pay you to represent that in psych and our attitude is some polite form tough. The

1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:44.760
 deal is this take it or leave it and in a few cases they've left it and in most cases they'll

1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:51.840
 see our point of view and take it because that's how we've built the psych system by essentially

1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:59.560
 tacking with the funding wins where people would fund a project and half of it would be general

1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:04.080
 knowledge that would stay permanently as part of psych. So always with these partnerships it's not

1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:10.920
 like a distraction from the main psych development. It's a small distraction. It's a small but it's

1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.480
 not a complete one so you're adding to the knowledge base. Yes absolutely and we try to

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:23.320
 stay away from projects that would not have that property. So let me go back and talk about open

1:52:23.320 --> 1:52:34.520
 psych for a second. So I've had a lot of trouble expressing and convincing other AI researchers how

1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:41.600
 important it is to use an expressive representation language like we do this higher order logic rather

1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:52.280
 than just using some triple store knowledge graph type representation. And so as an attempt to show

1:52:52.280 --> 1:53:02.520
 them why they needed something more we said oh well we'll represent this unimportant projection

1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:11.040
 or shadow or subset of psych that just happens to be the simple binary relations, the relation

1:53:11.040 --> 1:53:20.160
 argument one argument two triples and so on. And then you'll see how much more useful it is if you

1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:29.200
 had the entire psych system. So it's all well and good to have the taxonomic relations between terms

1:53:29.200 --> 1:53:39.640
 like person and night and sleep and bed and house and eyes and so on. But think about how much more

1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:46.040
 useful it would be if you also had all the rules of thumb about those things like people sleep at

1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:50.240
 night, they sleep lying down, they sleep with their eyes closed, they usually sleep in beds in

1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:55.560
 our country, they sleep for hours at a time, they can be woken up, they don't like being woken up

1:53:55.560 --> 1:54:02.000
 and so on and so on. So it's that massive amount of knowledge which is not part of open psych and

1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:08.400
 we thought that all the researchers would then immediately say oh my god of course we need the

1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:15.360
 other 90% that you're not giving us, let's partner and license psych so that we can use it in our

1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:20.640
 research. But instead what people said is oh even the bit you've released is so much better than

1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:25.760
 anything we had, we'll just make do with this. And so if you look there are a lot of robotics

1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:33.320
 companies today for example which use open psych as their fundamental ontology and in some sense

1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:40.080
 the whole world missed the point of open psych and we were doing it to show people why that's

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:45.160
 not really what they wanted and too many people thought somehow that this was psych or that this

1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:52.200
 was in fact good enough for them and they never even bothered coming to us to get access to the

1:54:52.200 --> 1:54:57.520
 full psych. But there's two parts to open psych. So one is convincing people on the idea and the

1:54:57.520 --> 1:55:02.560
 power of this general kind of representation of knowledge and the value that you hold in having

1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:07.720
 acquired that knowledge and built it and continue to build it. And the other is the code base. This

1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:16.480
 is the code side of it. So my sense of the code base that psych or psych is operating with, I mean

1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:23.760
 it has the technical debt of the three decades plus right. This is the exact same problem that

1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:29.440
 Google had to deal with with the early version of TensorFlow. It's still dealing with that. They had

1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:36.280
 to basically break compatibility with the past several times and that's only over a period of

1:55:36.280 --> 1:55:43.400
 a couple years. But they I think successfully opened up, it's very risky, very gutsy move to

1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:51.280
 open up TensorFlow and then PyTorch on the Facebook side. And what you see is there's a

1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:57.800
 magic place where you can find a community, where you could develop a community that builds on the

1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:05.040
 system without taking away any of, not any, but most of the value. So most of the value that

1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:10.640
 Google has is still a Google. Most of the value that Facebook has still Facebook even though some

1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:16.560
 of this major machine learning tooling is released into the open. My question is not so much on the

1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:24.120
 knowledge, which is also a big part of open psych, but all the different kinds of tooling. So there's

1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:29.040
 the kind of, all the kinds of stuff you can do on the knowledge graph, knowledge base, whatever we

1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:35.680
 call it. There's the inference engines. So there could be some, there probably are a bunch of

1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:40.120
 proprietary stuff you want to kind of keep secret. And there's probably some stuff you can open up

1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:45.040
 completely and then let the community build up enough community where they develop stuff on top

1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:51.120
 of it. Yes, there will be those publications and academic work and all that kind of stuff. And also

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:56.320
 the tooling of adding to the knowledge base, right? Like developing, you know, there's incredible

1:56:56.320 --> 1:57:00.920
 amount, like there's so many people that are just really good at this kind of stuff in the open

1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:06.840
 source community. So my question for you is like, have you struggled with this kind of idea that

1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:11.680
 you have so much value in your company already? You've developed so many good things. You have

1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:17.000
 clients that really value your relationships. And then there's this dormant giant open source

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:24.200
 community that as far as I know, you're not utilizing. There's so many things to say there,

1:57:24.200 --> 1:57:32.760
 but there could be magic moments where the community builds up large enough to where the

1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:39.120
 artificial intelligence field that is currently 99.9% machine learning is dominated by machine

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:45.880
 learning, has a face shift towards like, or at least in part towards more like what you might

1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:53.880
 call symbolic AI. This whole place where psych is like at the center of, and then as you know,

1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:59.280
 that requires a little bit leap of faith because you're now surfing and there'll be obviously

1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:04.600
 competitors that will pop up and start making you nervous and all that kind of stuff. So do you think

1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:10.240
 about the space of open sourcing some parts and not others, how to leverage the community,

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:14.920
 all those kinds of things? That's a good question. And I think you phrased it the right way,

1:58:14.920 --> 1:58:23.600
 which is we're constantly struggling with the question of what to open source, what to make

1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:34.120
 public, what to even publicly talk about. And there are enormous pluses and minuses to every

1:58:34.120 --> 1:58:44.880
 alternative. And it's very much like negotiating a very treacherous path. Partly the analogy is

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:51.400
 like if you slip, you could make a fatal mistake, give away something which essentially kills you

1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:59.800
 or fail to give away something which failing to give it away hurts you and so on. So it is a very

1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:10.360
 tough, tough question. Usually what we have done with people who've approached us to collaborate

1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:19.680
 on research is to say we will make available to you the entire knowledge base and executable

1:59:19.680 --> 1:59:29.680
 copies of all of the code, but only very, very limited source code access if you have some idea

1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:36.520
 for how you might improve something or work with us on something. So let me also get back to one

1:59:36.520 --> 1:59:45.560
 of the very, very first things we talked about here, which was separating the question of how

1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:50.600
 could you get a computer to do this at all versus how could you get a computer to do this efficiently

1:59:50.600 --> 1:59:59.360
 enough in real time. And so one of the early lessons we learned was that we had to separate

1:59:59.360 --> 2:00:05.720
 the epistemological problem of what should the system know, separate that from the heuristic

2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:12.640
 problem of how can the system reason efficiently with what it knows. And so instead of trying to

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:20.480
 pick one representation language which was the sweet spot or the best tradeoff point between

2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:25.720
 expressiveness of the language and efficiency of the language, if you had to pick one,

2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:31.600
 knowledge graphs would probably be, associative triples would probably be about the best you

2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:37.560
 could do. And that's why we started there. But after a few years, we realized that what we could

2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:44.480
 do is we could split this and we could have one nice, clean, epistemological level language,

2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:52.560
 which is this higher order logic, and we could have one or more grubby but efficient heuristic

2:00:52.560 --> 2:01:00.000
 level modules that opportunistically would say, oh, I can make progress on what you're trying to

2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:05.680
 do over here. I have a special method that will contribute a little bit toward a solution.

2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:09.000
 Of course, some subset of that knowledge.

2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:14.400
 Exactly. So by now, we have over a thousand of these heuristic level modules, and they function

2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:20.880
 as a kind of community of agents. And there's one of them, which is a general theorem prover. And in

2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:29.360
 theory, that's the only one you need. But in practice, it always takes so long that you never

2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:35.240
 want to call on it. You always want these other agents to very efficiently reason through it. It's

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:39.840
 sort of like if you're balancing a chemical equation. You could go back to first principles,

2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:44.920
 but in fact, there are algorithms which are vastly more efficient. Or if you're trying to

2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:52.280
 solve a quadratic equation, you could go back to first principles of mathematics. But it's much

2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:58.400
 better to simply recognize that this is a quadratic equation and apply the binomial formula and snap,

2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:04.800
 you get your answer right away and so on. So think of these as like a thousand little experts

2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:11.200
 that are all looking at everything the site gets asked and looking at everything that every other

2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:19.160
 little agent has contributed, almost like notes on a blackboard, notes on a whiteboard, and making

2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:24.320
 additional notes when they think they can be helpful. And gradually, that community of agents

2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:31.480
 gets an answer to your question, gets a solution to your problem. And if we ever come up in a domain

2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:38.120
 application where Psych is getting the right answer but taking too long, then what we'll often

2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:45.640
 do is talk to one of the human experts and say, here's the set of reasoning steps that Psych went

2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:50.640
 through. You can see why it took it a long time to get the answer. How is it that you were able

2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:57.600
 to answer that question in two seconds? And occasionally, you'll get an expert who just

2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:02.440
 says, well, I just know it. I just was able to do it or something. And then you don't talk to them

2:03:02.440 --> 2:03:07.680
 anymore. But sometimes you'll get an expert who says, well, let me introspect on that. Yes,

2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:15.320
 here is a special representation we use just for aqueous chemistry equations, or here's a special

2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:21.040
 representation and a special technique, which we can now apply to things in this special

2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:29.080
 representation and so on. And then you add that as the 1001st HL heuristic level module. And from

2:03:29.080 --> 2:03:35.200
 then on, in any application, if it ever comes up again, it'll be able to contribute and so on. So

2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:43.240
 that's pretty much one of the main ways in which Psych has recouped this loss deficiency. A second

2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:52.760
 important way is meta reasoning. So you can speed things up by focusing on removing knowledge from

2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:58.000
 the system till all it has left is minimal knowledge needed. But that's the wrong thing to

2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.360
 do, right? That would be like in a human extirpating part of their brain or something. That's really

2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:08.600
 bad. So instead, what you want to do is give it meta level advice, tactical and strategic advice,

2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:15.320
 that enables it to reason about what kind of knowledge is going to be relevant to this problem,

2:04:15.320 --> 2:04:21.040
 what kind of tactics are going to be good to take in trying to attack this problem. When is it time

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.600
 to start trying to prove the negation of this thing, because I'm knocking myself out trying to

2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:30.480
 prove it's true, and maybe it's false. And if I just spend a minute, I can see that it's false

2:04:30.480 --> 2:04:37.680
 or something. So it's like dynamically pruning the graph to only like, based on the particular

2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:45.960
 thing you're trying to infer. Yes. And so by now, we have about 150 of these sort of like

2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:53.120
 breakthrough ideas that have led to dramatic speed ups in the inference process, where one

2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:59.800
 of them was this ELHL split and lots of HL modules. Another one was using meta and meta

2:04:59.800 --> 2:05:08.080
 level reasoning to reason about the reasoning that's going on and so on. And 150 breakthroughs

2:05:08.080 --> 2:05:12.160
 may sound like a lot, but if you divide by 37 years, it's not as impressive.

2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:21.200
 So there's these kind of heuristic modules that really help improve the inference. How hard,

2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:30.880
 in general, is this? Because you mentioned higher order logic. In the general theorem prover sense,

2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:37.760
 it's intractable, very difficult problem. Yes. So how hard is this inference problem when we're not

2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:46.680
 talking about if we let go of the perfect and focus on the good? I would say it's half of the

2:05:46.680 --> 2:05:54.320
 problem in the following empirical sense, which is over the years, about half of our effort,

2:05:54.320 --> 2:06:02.160
 maybe 40% of our effort has been our team of inference programmers. And the other 50,

2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:08.280
 60% has been our ontologists or ontological engineers putting in knowledge. So our ontological

2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:12.840
 engineers in most cases don't even know how to program. They have degrees in things like

2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:17.520
 philosophy and so on. So it's almost like the... I love that. I love to hang out with

2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:22.000
 those people actually. Oh yes, it's wonderful. But it's very much like the Eloy and the Morlocks

2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:29.760
 in H.G. Wells Time Machine. So you have the Eloy who only program in the epistemological higher

2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:36.800
 order logic language. And then you have the Morlocks who are under the ground figuring

2:06:36.800 --> 2:06:43.440
 out what the machinery is that will make this efficiently operate and so on. And so, you know,

2:06:43.440 --> 2:06:49.640
 occasionally they'll toss messages back to each other and so on. But it really is almost this

2:06:49.640 --> 2:06:57.200
 50 50 split between finding clever ways to recoup efficiency when you have an expressive language

2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:03.200
 and putting in the content of what the system needs to know. And yeah, both are fascinating.

2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:10.560
 To some degree, the entirety of the system, as far as I understand, is written in various variants

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:17.200
 of Lisp. So my favorite program language is still Lisp. I don't program in it much anymore because,

2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:24.840
 you know, the world has in majority of its system has moved on. Like everybody respects Lisp,

2:07:24.840 --> 2:07:30.920
 but many of the systems are not written in Lisp anymore. But Syke, as far as I understand,

2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:37.200
 maybe you can correct me, there's a bunch of Lisp in it. Yeah. So it's based on Lisp code that we

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:44.920
 produced. Most of the programming is still going on in a dialect of Lisp. And then for efficiency

2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:51.800
 reasons, that gets automatically translated into things like Java or C. Nowadays, it's almost all

2:07:51.800 --> 2:07:58.560
 translated into Java because Java has gotten good enough that that's really all we need to do.

2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:02.600
 So it's translated into Java, and then Java is compiled down to bytecode.

2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:03.040
 Yes.

2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:11.280
 Okay, so that's sort of that's a that that that's a, you know, it's a process that probably has to

2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:16.160
 do with the fact that when Syke was originally written, and you build up a powerful system,

2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:22.520
 like there is some technical depth you have to deal with, as is the case with most powerful

2:08:22.520 --> 2:08:31.200
 systems that span years. Have you ever considered this, this would help me understand, because my

2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:38.720
 perspective, so much of the value of everything you've done with Syke and Cycorp is the is the

2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:44.640
 is the knowledge. Have you ever considered just like throwing away the code base and starting

2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:53.480
 from scratch, not really throwing away, but sort of moving it to like throwing away that technical

2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:59.800
 debt, starting with a more updated programming language? Is that throwing away a lot of value

2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:05.400
 or no? Like, what's your sense? How much of the value is in the silly software engineering aspect,

2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:07.720
 and how much of the value is in the knowledge?

2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:21.840
 So development of programs in Lisp proceeds, I think, somewhere between a thousand and fifty

2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:29.720
 thousand times faster than development in any of what you're calling modern or improved computer

2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:30.200
 languages.

2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:34.960
 Well, there's other functional languages like, you know, Clojure and all that. But I mean,

2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:40.200
 I'm with you. I like Lisp. I just wonder how many great programmers there are. There's still like...

2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:48.760
 Yes. So it is true when a new inference programmer comes on board, they need to learn some of Lisp.

2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:55.080
 And in fact, we have a subset of Lisp, which we call cleverly Sub L, which is really all they

2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:01.840
 need to learn. And so the programming actually goes on in Sub L, not in full Lisp. And so it

2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:08.000
 does not take programmers very long at all to learn Sub L. And that's something which can then

2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:14.620
 be translated efficiently into Java. And for some of our programmers who are doing, say,

2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:21.600
 user interface work, then they never have to even learn Sub L. They just have to learn APIs into the

2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:23.440
 basic psych engine.

2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:29.920
 So you're not necessarily feeling the burden of like, it's extremely efficient. That's not a

2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:31.960
 problem to solve. Okay.

2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:37.320
 Right. The other thing is, remember that we're talking about hiring programmers to do inference,

2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:43.680
 who are programmers interested in effectively automatic theorem proving. And so those are

2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:50.880
 people already predisposed to representing things in logic and so on. And Lisp really was the

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:58.360
 programming language based on logic that John McCarthy and others who developed it basically

2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:06.120
 took the formalisms that Alonzo Church and other philosophers, other logicians, had come up with

2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:12.840
 and basically said, can we basically make a programming language which is effectively logic?

2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:22.520
 And so since we're talking about reasoning about expressions written in this epistemological

2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:27.040
 language and we're doing operations which are effectively like theorem proving type

2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:34.800
 operations and so on, there's a natural impedance match between Lisp and the knowledge, the

2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:36.040
 way it's represented.

2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:40.640
 So I guess you could say it's a perfectly logical language to use.

2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:41.640
 Oh, yes.

2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:42.640
 Okay, I'm sorry.

2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:46.120
 I'll even let you get away with that.

2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:47.920
 Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.

2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:53.240
 So I'll probably use that in the future without credit.

2:11:53.240 --> 2:12:01.340
 But no, I think the point is that the language you program in isn't really that important.

2:12:01.340 --> 2:12:07.240
 It's more that you have to be able to think in terms of, for instance, creating new helpful

2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:13.580
 HL modules and how they'll work with each other and looking at things that are taking

2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:20.280
 a long time and coming up with new specialized data structures that will make this efficient.

2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:26.080
 So let me just give you one very simple example, which is when you have a transitive relation

2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:29.960
 like larger than, this is larger than that, which is larger than that, which is larger

2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:30.960
 than that.

2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:33.440
 So the first thing must be larger than the last thing.

2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:38.660
 Whenever you have a transitive relation, if you're not careful, if I ask whether this

2:12:38.660 --> 2:12:43.560
 thing over here is larger than the thing over here, I'll have to do some kind of graph walk

2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:48.680
 or theorem proving that might involve like five or 10 or 20 or 30 steps.

2:12:48.680 --> 2:12:55.880
 But if you store, redundantly store the transitive closure, the cleanly star of that transitive

2:12:55.880 --> 2:12:58.980
 relation, now you have this big table.

2:12:58.980 --> 2:13:04.720
 But you can always guarantee that in one single step, you can just look up whether this is

2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:06.700
 larger than that.

2:13:06.700 --> 2:13:12.600
 And so there are lots of cases where storage is cheap today.

2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:18.400
 And so by having this extra redundant data structure, we can answer this commonly occurring

2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:22.240
 type of question very, very efficiently.

2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:28.960
 Let me give you one other analogy, analog of that, which is something we call rule macro

2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:36.840
 predicates, which is we'll see this complicated rule and we'll notice that things very much

2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:41.080
 like it syntactically come up again and again and again.

2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:47.920
 So we'll create a whole brand new relation or predicate or function that captures that

2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:54.760
 and takes maybe not two arguments, takes maybe three, four or five arguments and so on.

2:13:54.760 --> 2:14:04.120
 And now we have effectively converted some complicated if then rule that might have to

2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:10.160
 have inference done on it into some ground atomic formula, which is just the name of

2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:13.200
 a relation and a few arguments and so on.

2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:20.880
 And so converting commonly occurring types or schemas of rules into brand new predicates,

2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:27.520
 brand new functions, turns out to enormously speed up the inference process.

2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:32.720
 So now we've covered about four of the 150 good ideas I said.

2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:37.400
 So that idea in particular is like a nice compression that turns out to be really useful.

2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:38.400
 That's really interesting.

2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:40.920
 I mean, this whole thing is just fascinating from a philosophical.

2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:48.200
 There's part of me, I mean, it makes me a little bit sad because your work is both from

2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:53.600
 a computer science perspective fascinating and the inference engine from a epistemological

2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:59.400
 philosophical aspect fascinating, but you know, it is also you're running a company

2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:03.560
 and there's some stuff that has to remain private and it's sad.

2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:09.080
 Well here's something that may make you feel better, a little bit better.

2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:15.200
 We've formed a not for profit company called the Knowledge Axe Immunization Institute,

2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:17.040
 NAX, KNAX.

2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:25.440
 And I have this firm belief with a lot of empirical evidence to support it that the

2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:31.440
 education that people get in high schools, in colleges, in graduate schools and so on

2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:38.280
 is almost completely orthogonal to, almost completely irrelevant to how good they're

2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:45.080
 going to be at coming up to speed in doing this kind of ontological engineering and writing

2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:49.560
 these assertions and rules and so on in psych.

2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:54.880
 And so very often we'll interview candidates who have their PhD in philosophy, who've

2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:59.680
 taught logic for years and so on, and they're just awful.

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:00.840
 But the converse is true.

2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:06.340
 So one of the best ontological engineers we ever had never graduated high school.

2:16:06.340 --> 2:16:13.560
 And so the purpose of Knowledge Axe Immunization Institute, if we can get some foundations

2:16:13.560 --> 2:16:20.640
 to help support it is identify people in the general population, maybe high school dropouts,

2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:28.360
 who have latent talent for this sort of thing, offer them effectively scholarships to train

2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:35.280
 them and then help place them in companies that need more trained ontological engineers,

2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:39.560
 some of which would be working for us, but mostly would be working for partners or customers

2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:40.680
 or something.

2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:46.080
 And if we could do that, that would create an enormous number of relatively very high

2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:53.880
 paying jobs for people who currently have no way out of some situation that they're

2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:55.100
 locked into.

2:16:55.100 --> 2:17:01.080
 So is there something you can put into words that describes somebody who would be great

2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:03.280
 at ontological engineering?

2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:12.200
 So what characteristics about a person make them great at this task, this task of converting

2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:17.240
 the messiness of human language and knowledge into formal logic?

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:22.760
 This is very much like what Alan Turing had to do during World War II in trying to find

2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:28.400
 people to bring to Bletchley Park, where he would publish in the London Times cryptic

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:34.760
 crossword puzzles along with some innocuous looking note, which essentially said, if you

2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:40.820
 were able to solve this puzzle in less than 15 minutes, please call this phone number

2:17:40.820 --> 2:17:42.960
 and so on.

2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:49.840
 Or back when I was young, there was the practice of having matchbooks, where on the inside

2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:54.040
 of the matchbook, there would be a, can you draw this?

2:17:54.040 --> 2:18:00.100
 You have a career in art, commercial art, if you can copy this drawing and so on.

2:18:00.100 --> 2:18:02.400
 So yes, the analog of that.

2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:06.000
 Is there a little test to get to the core of whether you're going to be good or not?

2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:14.020
 So part of it has to do with being able to make and appreciate and react negatively appropriately

2:18:14.020 --> 2:18:16.160
 to puns and other jokes.

2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:18.740
 So you have to have a kind of sense of humor.

2:18:18.740 --> 2:18:24.640
 And if you're good at telling jokes and good at understanding jokes, that's one

2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:25.640
 indicator.

2:18:25.640 --> 2:18:26.640
 Like puns?

2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:27.640
 Yes.

2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:28.640
 Like dad jokes?

2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:29.640
 Yes.

2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:32.360
 Well, maybe not dad jokes, but funny jokes.

2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:36.360
 I think I'm applying to work at SACOR.

2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:38.240
 Another is if you're able to introspect.

2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:48.360
 So very often, we'll give someone a simple question and we'll say like, why is this?

2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:53.480
 And sometimes they'll just say, because it is, okay, that's a bad sign.

2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:56.560
 But very often, they'll be able to introspect and so on.

2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:01.800
 So one of the questions I often ask is I'll point to a sentence with a pronoun in it and

2:19:01.800 --> 2:19:07.700
 I'll say, the referent of that pronoun is obviously this noun over here.

2:19:07.700 --> 2:19:14.980
 How would you or I or an AI or a five year old, 10 year old child know that that pronoun

2:19:14.980 --> 2:19:18.240
 refers to that noun over here?

2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:25.760
 And often the people who are going to be good at ontological engineering will give me some

2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:30.100
 causal explanation or will refer to some things that are true in the world.

2:19:30.100 --> 2:19:35.120
 So if you imagine a sentence like, the horse was led into the barn while its head was still

2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:36.120
 wet.

2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:38.980
 And so its head refers to the horse's head.

2:19:38.980 --> 2:19:40.420
 But how do you know that?

2:19:40.420 --> 2:19:42.140
 And so some people will say, I just know it.

2:19:42.140 --> 2:19:45.620
 Some people will say, well, the horse was the subject of the sentence.

2:19:45.620 --> 2:19:50.080
 And I'll say, okay, well, what about the horse was led into the barn while its roof was still

2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.080
 wet?

2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:54.360
 Now, its roof obviously refers to the barn.

2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:58.440
 And so then they'll say, oh, well, that's because it's the closest noun.

2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:05.380
 And so basically, if they try to give me answers which are based on syntax and grammar and

2:20:05.380 --> 2:20:07.580
 so on, that's a really bad sign.

2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:12.120
 But if they're able to say things like, well, horses have heads and barns don't and barns

2:20:12.120 --> 2:20:16.860
 have roofs and horses don't, then that's a positive sign that they're going to be good

2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:22.180
 at this because they can introspect on what's true in the world that leads you to know certain

2:20:22.180 --> 2:20:23.180
 things.

2:20:23.180 --> 2:20:28.060
 How fascinating is it that getting a Ph.D. makes you less capable to introspect deeply

2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:29.060
 about this?

2:20:29.060 --> 2:20:30.860
 Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

2:20:30.860 --> 2:20:32.820
 I'm not saying that it makes you less capable.

2:20:32.820 --> 2:20:37.500
 Let's just say it's independent of how good people are.

2:20:37.500 --> 2:20:38.500
 You're not saying that.

2:20:38.500 --> 2:20:39.500
 I'm saying that.

2:20:39.500 --> 2:20:47.740
 It's interesting that for a lot of people, Ph.D.s, sorry, philosophy aside, that sometimes

2:20:47.740 --> 2:20:52.060
 education narrows your thinking versus expands it.

2:20:52.060 --> 2:20:53.600
 It's kind of fascinating.

2:20:53.600 --> 2:20:58.900
 And for certain when you're trying to do ontological engineering, which is essentially teach our

2:20:58.900 --> 2:21:05.980
 future AI overlords how to reason deeply about this world and how to understand it, that

2:21:05.980 --> 2:21:08.700
 requires that you think deeply about the world.

2:21:08.700 --> 2:21:14.820
 So I'll tell you a sad story about mathcraft, which is why is that not widely used in schools

2:21:14.820 --> 2:21:16.100
 today?

2:21:16.100 --> 2:21:20.700
 We're not really trying to make big profit on it or anything like that.

2:21:20.700 --> 2:21:27.060
 When we've gone to schools, their attitude has been, well, if a student spends 20 hours

2:21:27.060 --> 2:21:34.220
 going through this mathcraft program from start to end and so on, will it improve their

2:21:34.220 --> 2:21:39.980
 score on this standardized test more than if they spent 20 hours just doing mindless

2:21:39.980 --> 2:21:43.700
 drills of problem after problem after problem?

2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:47.820
 And the answer is, well, no, but it'll increase their understanding more.

2:21:47.820 --> 2:21:54.260
 And their attitude is, well, if it doesn't increase their score on this test, then we're

2:21:54.260 --> 2:21:55.660
 not going to adopt it.

2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:56.660
 That's sad.

2:21:56.660 --> 2:22:01.900
 I mean, that's a whole another three, four hour conversation about the education system.

2:22:01.900 --> 2:22:06.660
 But let me ask you, let me go super philosophical, as if we weren't already.

2:22:06.660 --> 2:22:11.620
 So in 1950, Alan Turing wrote the paper that formulated the Turing test.

2:22:11.620 --> 2:22:12.620
 Yes.

2:22:12.620 --> 2:22:16.020
 And he opened the paper with the question, can machines think?

2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:17.020
 So what do you think?

2:22:17.020 --> 2:22:18.020
 Can machines think?

2:22:18.020 --> 2:22:20.820
 Let me ask you this question.

2:22:20.820 --> 2:22:21.980
 Absolutely.

2:22:21.980 --> 2:22:27.980
 Machines can think, certainly as well as humans can think, right?

2:22:27.980 --> 2:22:34.380
 We're meat machines just because they're not currently made out of meat is just an engineering

2:22:34.380 --> 2:22:38.300
 solution decision and so on.

2:22:38.300 --> 2:22:42.180
 So of course machines can think.

2:22:42.180 --> 2:22:51.860
 I think that there was a lot of damage done by people misunderstanding Turing's imitation

2:22:51.860 --> 2:23:03.220
 game and focus on trying to get a chat bot to fool other people into thinking it was

2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:06.540
 human and so on.

2:23:06.540 --> 2:23:10.980
 That's not a terrible test in and of itself, but it shouldn't be your one and only test

2:23:10.980 --> 2:23:13.380
 for intelligence.

2:23:13.380 --> 2:23:19.180
 In terms of tests of intelligence, you know, with the Lobner Prize, which is a very kind

2:23:19.180 --> 2:23:25.340
 of, you want to say a more strict formulation of the Turing test as originally formulated.

2:23:25.340 --> 2:23:31.180
 And then there's something like Alexa Prize, which is more, I would say a more interesting

2:23:31.180 --> 2:23:37.740
 formulation of the test, which is like, ultimately the metric is how long does a human want to

2:23:37.740 --> 2:23:38.740
 talk to the AI system?

2:23:38.740 --> 2:23:46.060
 So it's like if the goal is you want it to be 20 minutes, it's basically not just have

2:23:46.060 --> 2:23:52.620
 a convincing conversation, but more like a compelling one or a fun one or an interesting

2:23:52.620 --> 2:23:53.620
 one.

2:23:53.620 --> 2:24:01.120
 And that seems like more to the spirit maybe of what Turing was imagining.

2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:06.700
 But what for you do you think in the space of tests is a good test?

2:24:06.700 --> 2:24:12.900
 When you see a system based on psych that passes that test, you'd be like, damn, we've

2:24:12.900 --> 2:24:17.020
 created something special here.

2:24:17.020 --> 2:24:23.700
 The test has to be something involving depth of reasoning and recursiveness of reasoning,

2:24:23.700 --> 2:24:30.100
 the ability to answer repeated why questions about the answer you just gave.

2:24:30.100 --> 2:24:33.140
 How many why questions in a row can you keep answering?

2:24:33.140 --> 2:24:36.140
 Something like that.

2:24:36.140 --> 2:24:41.820
 Just have like a young curious child and an AI system and how long will an AI system last

2:24:41.820 --> 2:24:43.300
 before it wants to quit?

2:24:43.300 --> 2:24:44.300
 Yes.

2:24:44.300 --> 2:24:45.660
 And again, that's not the only test.

2:24:45.660 --> 2:24:48.020
 Another one has to do with argumentation.

2:24:48.020 --> 2:24:57.020
 In other words, here's a proposition, come up with pro and con arguments for it and try

2:24:57.020 --> 2:25:02.300
 and give me convincing arguments on both sides.

2:25:02.300 --> 2:25:09.660
 And so that's another important kind of ability that the system needs to be able to exhibit

2:25:09.660 --> 2:25:12.860
 in order to really be intelligent, I think.

2:25:12.860 --> 2:25:18.180
 So there's certain, I mean, if you look at IBM Watson and like certain impressive accomplishments

2:25:18.180 --> 2:25:24.500
 for very specific tests, almost like a demo, right?

2:25:24.500 --> 2:25:34.740
 There's some, like I talked to the guy who led the Jeopardy effort, and there's some

2:25:34.740 --> 2:25:40.260
 kind of hard coding heuristics tricks that you try to pull it all together to make the

2:25:40.260 --> 2:25:43.060
 thing work in the end for this thing, right?

2:25:43.060 --> 2:25:49.060
 That seems to be one of the lessons with AI is like, that's the fastest way to get a solution

2:25:49.060 --> 2:25:50.580
 that's pretty damn impressive.

2:25:50.580 --> 2:25:59.620
 So here's what I would say is that as impressive as that was, it made some mistakes, but more

2:25:59.620 --> 2:26:07.260
 importantly, many of the mistakes it made were mistakes which no human would have made.

2:26:07.260 --> 2:26:17.540
 And so part of the new or augmented Turing tests would have to be, and the mistakes you

2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:24.300
 make are ones which humans don't basically look at and say, what?

2:26:24.300 --> 2:26:33.540
 So for example, there was a question about which 16th century Italian politician, blah,

2:26:33.540 --> 2:26:37.260
 blah, blah, and Watson said Ronald Reagan.

2:26:37.260 --> 2:26:42.000
 So most Americans would have gotten that question wrong, but they would never have said Ronald

2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:49.860
 Reagan as an answer because among the things they know is that he lived relatively recently

2:26:49.860 --> 2:26:53.960
 and people don't really live 400 years and things like that.

2:26:53.960 --> 2:27:00.860
 So that's, I think, a very important thing, which is if it's making mistakes which no

2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:05.780
 normal sane human would have made, then that's a really bad sign.

2:27:05.780 --> 2:27:10.140
 And if it's not making those kinds of mistakes, then that's a good sign.

2:27:10.140 --> 2:27:12.980
 And I don't think it's any one very, very simple test.

2:27:12.980 --> 2:27:17.300
 I think it's all of the things you mentioned, all the things I mentioned is really a battery

2:27:17.300 --> 2:27:23.700
 of tests, which together, if it passes almost all of these tests, it'd be hard to argue

2:27:23.700 --> 2:27:25.340
 that it's not intelligent.

2:27:25.340 --> 2:27:30.980
 And if it fails several of these tests, it's really hard to argue that it really understands

2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:33.460
 what it's doing and that it really is generally intelligent.

2:27:33.460 --> 2:27:40.820
 So to pass all of those tests, we've talked a lot about psych and knowledge and reasoning.

2:27:40.820 --> 2:27:47.540
 Do you think this AI system would need to have some other human like elements, for example,

2:27:47.540 --> 2:27:52.820
 a body or a physical manifestation in this world?

2:27:52.820 --> 2:27:59.980
 And another one which seems to be fundamental to the human experience is consciousness.

2:27:59.980 --> 2:28:04.740
 The subjective experience of what it's like to actually be you.

2:28:04.740 --> 2:28:08.700
 Do you think it needs those to be able to pass all of those tests and to achieve general

2:28:08.700 --> 2:28:09.700
 intelligence?

2:28:09.700 --> 2:28:10.700
 It's a good question.

2:28:10.700 --> 2:28:15.340
 I think in the case of a body, no, I know there are a lot of people like Penrose who

2:28:15.340 --> 2:28:21.940
 would have disagreed with me and others, but no, I don't think it needs to have a body

2:28:21.940 --> 2:28:24.300
 in order to be intelligent.

2:28:24.300 --> 2:28:32.780
 I think that it needs to be able to talk about having a body and having sensations and having

2:28:32.780 --> 2:28:33.980
 emotions and so on.

2:28:33.980 --> 2:28:39.380
 It doesn't actually have to have all of that, but it has to understand it in the same way

2:28:39.380 --> 2:28:47.300
 that Helen Keller was perfectly intelligent and able to talk about colors and sounds and

2:28:47.300 --> 2:28:54.100
 shapes and so on, even though she didn't directly experience all the same things that the rest

2:28:54.100 --> 2:28:55.100
 of us do.

2:28:55.100 --> 2:29:04.060
 So knowledge of it and being able to correctly make use of that is certainly an important

2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:09.420
 facility, but actually having a body, if you believe that that's just a kind of religious

2:29:09.420 --> 2:29:15.740
 or mystical belief, you can't really argue for or against it, I suppose.

2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:19.340
 It's just something that some people believe.

2:29:19.340 --> 2:29:24.540
 What about an extension of the body, which is consciousness?

2:29:24.540 --> 2:29:27.780
 It feels like something to be here.

2:29:27.780 --> 2:29:28.780
 Sure.

2:29:28.780 --> 2:29:30.820
 But what does that really mean?

2:29:30.820 --> 2:29:35.940
 It's like, well, if I talk to you, you say things which make me believe that you're conscious.

2:29:35.940 --> 2:29:40.540
 I know that I'm conscious, but you're just taking my word for it now.

2:29:40.540 --> 2:29:46.620
 But in the same sense, psych is conscious in that same sense already, where of course

2:29:46.620 --> 2:29:50.620
 it's a computer program, it understands where and when it's running, it understands who's

2:29:50.620 --> 2:29:55.300
 talking to it, it understands what its task is, what its goals are, what its current problem

2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:59.600
 is that it's working on, it understands how long it's spent on things, what it's tried,

2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:06.300
 it understands what it's done in the past, and so on.

2:30:06.300 --> 2:30:11.340
 If we want to call that consciousness, then yes, psych is already conscious.

2:30:11.340 --> 2:30:15.700
 But I don't think that I would ascribe anything mystical to that.

2:30:15.700 --> 2:30:21.220
 Again, some people would, but I would say that other than our own personal experience

2:30:21.220 --> 2:30:27.980
 of consciousness, we're just treating everyone else in the world, so to speak, at their word

2:30:27.980 --> 2:30:29.820
 about being conscious.

2:30:29.820 --> 2:30:39.300
 And so if a computer program, if an AI is able to exhibit all the same kinds of response

2:30:39.300 --> 2:30:46.500
 as you would expect of a conscious entity, then doesn't it deserve the label of consciousness

2:30:46.500 --> 2:30:47.500
 just as much?

2:30:47.500 --> 2:30:51.200
 So there's another burden that comes with this whole intelligence thing that humans

2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:59.780
 got is the extinguishing of the light of consciousness, which is kind of realizing that we're going

2:30:59.780 --> 2:31:02.660
 to be dead someday.

2:31:02.660 --> 2:31:09.060
 And there's a bunch of philosophers like Ernest Becker, who kind of think that this realization

2:31:09.060 --> 2:31:18.180
 of mortality, and then fear, sometimes they call it terror of mortality, is one of the

2:31:18.180 --> 2:31:24.980
 creative forces behind human condition, like, it's the thing that drives us.

2:31:24.980 --> 2:31:27.900
 Do you think it's important for an AI system?

2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:36.660
 You know, when Psych proposed that it's not human, and it's one of the moderators of

2:31:36.660 --> 2:31:43.980
 his contents, you know, there's another question it could ask, which is like, it kind of knows

2:31:43.980 --> 2:31:47.760
 that humans are mortal, am I mortal?

2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:54.620
 And I think one really important thing that's possible when you're conscious is to fear

2:31:54.620 --> 2:31:59.020
 the extinguishing of that consciousness, the fear of mortality.

2:31:59.020 --> 2:32:04.340
 Do you think that's useful for intelligence, thinking like, I might die, and I really don't

2:32:04.340 --> 2:32:05.340
 want to die?

2:32:05.340 --> 2:32:06.660
 I don't think so.

2:32:06.660 --> 2:32:12.940
 I think it may help some humans to be better people.

2:32:12.940 --> 2:32:16.140
 It may help some humans to be more creative, and so on.

2:32:16.140 --> 2:32:23.660
 I don't think it's necessary for AIs to believe that they have limited lifespans, and therefore

2:32:23.660 --> 2:32:26.020
 they should make the most of their behavior.

2:32:26.020 --> 2:32:30.980
 Maybe eventually the answer to that and my answer to that will change, but as of now

2:32:30.980 --> 2:32:36.980
 I would say that that's almost like a frill or a side effect that is not, in fact, if

2:32:36.980 --> 2:32:42.780
 you look at most humans, most humans ignore the fact that they're going to die most of

2:32:42.780 --> 2:32:43.780
 the time.

2:32:43.780 --> 2:32:49.700
 Well, but that's like, this goes to the white space between the words.

2:32:49.700 --> 2:32:54.300
 So what Ernest Becker argues is that that ignoring is we're living in an illusion that

2:32:54.300 --> 2:32:57.780
 we constructed on the foundation of this terror.

2:32:57.780 --> 2:33:05.100
 So we're escape life as we know it, pursuing things, creating things, love, everything

2:33:05.100 --> 2:33:11.620
 we can think of that's beautiful about humanity is just trying to escape this realization

2:33:11.620 --> 2:33:13.420
 that we're going to die one day.

2:33:13.420 --> 2:33:21.420
 That's his idea, and I think, I don't know if I 100% believe in this, but it certainly

2:33:21.420 --> 2:33:22.700
 rhymes.

2:33:22.700 --> 2:33:25.620
 It seems like to me like it rhymes with the truth.

2:33:25.620 --> 2:33:26.620
 Yeah.

2:33:26.620 --> 2:33:33.340
 I think that for some people that's going to be a more powerful factor than others.

2:33:33.340 --> 2:33:35.860
 Clearly Doug is talking about Russians.

2:33:35.860 --> 2:33:44.700
 So I'm Russian, so clearly it infiltrates all of Russian literature.

2:33:44.700 --> 2:33:53.860
 And AI doesn't have to have fear of death as a motivating force in that we can build

2:33:53.860 --> 2:33:55.700
 in motivation.

2:33:55.700 --> 2:34:03.180
 So we can build in the motivation of obeying users and making users happy and making others

2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:12.380
 happy and so on, and that can substitute for this sort of personal fear of death that sometimes

2:34:12.380 --> 2:34:16.940
 leads to bursts of creativity in humans.

2:34:16.940 --> 2:34:18.780
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:34:18.780 --> 2:34:23.420
 I think AI really needs to understand death deeply in order to be able to drive a car,

2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:24.860
 for example.

2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:28.100
 I think there's just some, like, there...

2:34:28.100 --> 2:34:30.060
 No, I really disagree.

2:34:30.060 --> 2:34:34.740
 I think it needs to understand the value of human life, especially the value of human

2:34:34.740 --> 2:34:41.940
 life to other humans, and understand that certain things are more important than other

2:34:41.940 --> 2:34:42.940
 things.

2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:48.060
 So it has to have a lot of knowledge about ethics and morality and so on.

2:34:48.060 --> 2:34:51.220
 But some of it is so messy that it's impossible to encode.

2:34:51.220 --> 2:34:52.220
 For example, there's...

2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:53.780
 I disagree.

2:34:53.780 --> 2:34:59.320
 So if there's a person dying right in front of us, most human beings would help that person,

2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:04.580
 but they would not apply that same ethics to everybody else in the world.

2:35:04.580 --> 2:35:09.100
 This is the tragedy of how difficult it is to be a doctor, because they know when they

2:35:09.100 --> 2:35:15.720
 help a dying child, they know that the money they're spending on this child cannot possibly

2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:18.920
 be spent on every other child that's dying.

2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:24.700
 And that's a very difficult to encode decision.

2:35:24.700 --> 2:35:26.540
 Perhaps it is...

2:35:26.540 --> 2:35:27.540
 Perhaps it could be formalized.

2:35:27.540 --> 2:35:31.900
 Oh, but I mean, you're talking about autonomous vehicles, right?

2:35:31.900 --> 2:35:39.340
 So autonomous vehicles are going to have to make those decisions all the time of, what

2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:43.060
 is the chance of this bad event happening?

2:35:43.060 --> 2:35:46.660
 How bad is that compared to this chance of that bad event happening?

2:35:46.660 --> 2:35:47.660
 And so on.

2:35:47.660 --> 2:35:52.940
 And when a potential accident is about to happen, is it worth taking this risk?

2:35:52.940 --> 2:35:56.980
 If I have to make a choice, which of these two cars am I going to hit and why?

2:35:56.980 --> 2:36:01.220
 See, I was thinking about a very different choice when I'm talking about hero mortality,

2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:06.020
 which is just observing Manhattan style driving.

2:36:06.020 --> 2:36:14.820
 I think that humans as an effective driver needs to threaten pedestrians lives a lot.

2:36:14.820 --> 2:36:19.500
 There's a dance, I've watched pedestrians a lot, I worked on this problem, and it seems

2:36:19.500 --> 2:36:27.220
 like the, if I could summarize the problem of a pedestrian crossing is the car with this

2:36:27.220 --> 2:36:30.240
 movement is saying, I'm going to kill you.

2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:33.320
 And the pedestrian is saying, maybe.

2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:36.780
 And then they decide and they say, no, I don't think you have the guts to kill me.

2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:39.460
 And you walk and they walk in front and they look away.

2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:46.300
 And there's that dance, the pedestrian, this is a social contract that the pedestrian trusts

2:36:46.300 --> 2:36:51.020
 that once they're in front of the car and the car is sufficiently, from a physics perspective,

2:36:51.020 --> 2:36:53.220
 able to stop, they're going to stop.

2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:58.540
 But the car also has to threaten that pedestrian is like, I'm late for work, so you're being

2:36:58.540 --> 2:37:01.140
 kind of an asshole by crossing in front of me.

2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:06.060
 But life and death is in like, it's part of the calculation here.

2:37:06.060 --> 2:37:11.220
 And it's that equation is being solved millions of times a day.

2:37:11.220 --> 2:37:12.220
 Yes.

2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:15.540
 Very effectively, that game theory, whatever that formulation is.

2:37:15.540 --> 2:37:16.540
 Absolutely.

2:37:16.540 --> 2:37:22.260
 I just I don't know if it's as simple as some formalizable game theory problem.

2:37:22.260 --> 2:37:28.300
 It could very well be in the case of driving and in the case of most of human society.

2:37:28.300 --> 2:37:29.300
 I don't know.

2:37:29.300 --> 2:37:34.660
 But yeah, you might be right that sort of the fear of death is just one of the quirks

2:37:34.660 --> 2:37:42.500
 of like the way our brains have evolved, but it's not a necessary feature of intelligence.

2:37:42.500 --> 2:37:48.740
 Others certainly are always doing this kind of estimate, even if it's unconscious, subconscious,

2:37:48.740 --> 2:37:52.860
 of what are the chances of various bad outcomes happening?

2:37:52.860 --> 2:37:59.060
 Like for instance, if I don't wait for this pedestrian or something like that, and what

2:37:59.060 --> 2:38:07.680
 is the downside to me going to be in terms of time wasted talking to the police or getting

2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:11.980
 sent to jail or things like that?

2:38:11.980 --> 2:38:17.580
 And there's also emotion, like people in their cars tend to get irrationally angry.

2:38:17.580 --> 2:38:18.580
 That's dangerous.

2:38:18.580 --> 2:38:24.260
 But, you know, think about this is all part of why I think that autonomous vehicles, truly

2:38:24.260 --> 2:38:31.060
 autonomous vehicles are farther out than most people do, because there is this enormous

2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:38.580
 level of complexity which goes beyond mechanically controlling the car.

2:38:38.580 --> 2:38:45.220
 And I can see the autonomous vehicles as a kind of metaphorical and literal accident

2:38:45.220 --> 2:38:47.100
 waiting to happen.

2:38:47.100 --> 2:38:56.900
 And not just because of their overall incurring versus preventing accidents and so on, but

2:38:56.900 --> 2:39:10.340
 just because of the almost voracious appetite people have for bad stories about powerful

2:39:10.340 --> 2:39:12.940
 companies and powerful entities.

2:39:12.940 --> 2:39:19.640
 When I was at a, coincidentally, Japanese fifth generation computing system conference

2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:26.220
 in 1987, while I happened to be there, there was a worker at an auto plant who was despondent

2:39:26.220 --> 2:39:30.900
 and committed suicide by climbing under the safety chains and so on and getting stamped

2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:32.940
 to death by a machine.

2:39:32.940 --> 2:39:38.940
 And instead of being a small story that said despondent worker commit suicide, it was front

2:39:38.940 --> 2:39:46.860
 page news that effectively said robot kills worker, because the public is just waiting

2:39:46.860 --> 2:39:54.220
 for stories about like AI kills phonogenic family of five type stories.

2:39:54.220 --> 2:40:01.300
 And even if you could show that nationwide, this system saved more lives than it cost

2:40:01.300 --> 2:40:09.100
 and prevented more injuries than it caused and so on, the media, the public, the government

2:40:09.100 --> 2:40:18.180
 is just coiled and ready to pounce on stories where in fact it failed, even if they're relatively

2:40:18.180 --> 2:40:19.180
 few.

2:40:19.180 --> 2:40:26.220
 Yeah, it's so fascinating to watch us humans resisting the cutting edge of science and

2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:31.940
 technology and almost like hoping for it to fail and constant, you know, this just happens

2:40:31.940 --> 2:40:33.820
 over and over and over throughout history.

2:40:33.820 --> 2:40:37.860
 Or even if we're not hoping for it to fail, we're fascinated by it.

2:40:37.860 --> 2:40:43.420
 And in terms of what we find interesting, the one in a thousand failures, much more

2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:48.160
 interesting than the 999 boring successes.

2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:57.860
 So once we build an AGI system, say psych is some part of it and say it's very possible

2:40:57.860 --> 2:41:03.420
 that you would be one of the first people that can sit down in the room, let's say with

2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:07.260
 her and have a conversation, what would you ask her?

2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:09.580
 What would you talk about?

2:41:09.580 --> 2:41:26.460
 Looking at all of the content out there on the web and so on, what are some possible

2:41:26.460 --> 2:41:33.120
 solutions to big problems that the world has that people haven't really thought of before

2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:40.000
 that are not being properly or at least adequately pursued?

2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:46.540
 What are some novel solutions that you can think of that we haven't that might work and

2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:48.600
 that might be worth considering?

2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:51.020
 So that is a damn good question.

2:41:51.020 --> 2:41:56.360
 Given that the AGI is going to be somewhat different from human intelligence, it's still

2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:02.020
 going to make some mistakes that we wouldn't make, but it's also possibly going to notice

2:42:02.020 --> 2:42:04.420
 some blind spots we have.

2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:13.460
 And I would love as a test of is it really on a par with our intelligences, can it help

2:42:13.460 --> 2:42:17.660
 spot some of the blind spots that we have?

2:42:17.660 --> 2:42:23.420
 So the two part question of can you help identify what are the big problems in the world?

2:42:23.420 --> 2:42:27.360
 And two, what are some novel solutions to those problems?

2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:31.660
 That are not being talked about by anyone.

2:42:31.660 --> 2:42:37.040
 And some of those may become infeasible or reprehensible or something, but some of them

2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:40.640
 might be actually great things to look at.

2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:45.960
 If you go back and look at some of the most powerful discoveries that have been made,

2:42:45.960 --> 2:42:56.180
 like relativity and superconductivity and so on, a lot of them were cases where someone

2:42:56.180 --> 2:43:04.620
 took seriously the idea that there might actually be a non obvious answer to a question.

2:43:04.620 --> 2:43:09.720
 So in Einstein's case, it was, yeah, the Lorentz transformation is known.

2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:12.200
 Nobody believes that it's actually the way reality works.

2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:15.380
 What if it were the way that reality actually worked?

2:43:15.380 --> 2:43:19.040
 So a lot of people don't realize he didn't actually work out that equation, he just sort

2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:20.940
 of took it seriously.

2:43:20.940 --> 2:43:26.680
 Or in the case of superconductivity, you have this V equals IR equation where R is resistance

2:43:26.680 --> 2:43:28.000
 and so on.

2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:33.480
 And it was being mapped at lower and lower temperatures, but everyone thought that was

2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:39.840
 just bump on a log research to show that V equals IR always held.

2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:46.180
 And then when some graduate student got to a slightly lower temperature and showed that

2:43:46.180 --> 2:43:50.960
 resistance suddenly dropped off, everyone just assumed that they did it wrong.

2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:56.680
 And it was only a little while later that they realized it was actually a new phenomenon.

2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:04.660
 Or in the case of the H. pylori bacteria causing stomach ulcers, where everyone thought that

2:44:04.660 --> 2:44:08.040
 stress and stomach acid caused ulcers.

2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:15.800
 And when a doctor in Australia claimed it was actually a bacterial infection, he couldn't

2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:21.880
 get anyone seriously to listen to him and he had to ultimately inject himself with the

2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:27.640
 bacteria to show that he suddenly developed a life threatening ulcer in order to get other

2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:29.880
 doctors to seriously consider that.

2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:35.680
 So there are all sorts of things where humans are locked into paradigms, what Thomas Kuhn

2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:40.520
 called paradigms, and we can't get out of them very easily.

2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:47.720
 So a lot of AI is locked into the deep learning machine learning paradigm right now.

2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:52.800
 And almost all of us and almost all sciences are locked into current paradigms.

2:44:52.800 --> 2:45:00.000
 And Kuhn's point was pretty much you have to wait for people to die in order for the

2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:03.280
 new generation to escape those paradigms.

2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:09.120
 And I think that one of the things that would change that sad reality is if we had trusted

2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:16.120
 AGI's that could help take a step back and question some of the paradigms that we're

2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:17.400
 currently locked into.

2:45:17.400 --> 2:45:25.160
 Yeah, it would accelerate the paradigm shifts in human science and progress.

2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:30.600
 You've lived a very interesting life where you thought about big ideas and you stuck

2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:32.600
 with them.

2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:38.520
 Can you give advice to young people today, somebody in high school, somebody undergrad,

2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:43.880
 about career, about life?

2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:47.840
 I'd say you can make a difference.

2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:53.200
 But in order to make a difference, you're going to have to have the courage to follow

2:45:53.200 --> 2:46:02.480
 through with ideas which other people might not immediately understand or support.

2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:12.880
 You have to realize that if you make some plan that's going to take an extended period

2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:16.640
 of time to carry out, don't be afraid of that.

2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:20.920
 That's true of physical training of your body.

2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:27.020
 That's true of learning some profession.

2:46:27.020 --> 2:46:33.580
 It's also true of innovation, that some innovations are not great ideas you can write down on

2:46:33.580 --> 2:46:38.500
 a napkin and become an instant success if you turn out to be right.

2:46:38.500 --> 2:46:45.900
 Some of them are paths you have to follow, but remember that you're mortal.

2:46:45.900 --> 2:46:53.320
 Remember that you have a limited number of decade sized debts to make with your life

2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:55.720
 and you should make each one of them count.

2:46:55.720 --> 2:46:58.160
 And that's true in personal relationships.

2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:00.360
 That's true in career choice.

2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:03.920
 That's true in making discoveries and so on.

2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:10.960
 And if you follow the path of least resistance, you'll find that you're optimizing for short

2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:12.800
 periods of time.

2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:17.280
 And before you know it, you turn around and long periods of time have gone by without

2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:21.400
 you ever really making a difference in the world.

2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:26.280
 When you look at the field that I really love is artificial intelligence and there's not

2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:33.040
 many projects, there's not many little flames of hope that have been carried out for many

2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:36.920
 years, for decades and psych represents one of them.

2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:42.880
 And I mean that in itself is just a really inspiring thing.

2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:47.960
 So I'm deeply grateful that you would be carrying that flame for so many years and I think that's

2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:50.040
 an inspiration to young people.

2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:55.360
 That said, you said life is finite and we talked about mortality as a feature of AGI.

2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:57.480
 Do you think about your own mortality?

2:47:57.480 --> 2:47:59.480
 Are you afraid of death?

2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:03.280
 Sure, I'd be crazy if I weren't.

2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:07.560
 And as I get older, I'm now over 70.

2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:14.760
 So as I get older, it's more on my mind, especially as acquaintances and friends and especially

2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:22.880
 mentors, one by one are dying, so I can't avoid thinking about mortality.

2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:28.760
 And I think that the good news from the point of view and the rest of the world is that

2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:34.640
 that adds impetus to my need to succeed in a small number of years in the future.

2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:36.520
 You have a deadline.

2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:37.520
 Exactly.

2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:41.440
 I'm not going to have another 37 years to continue working on this.

2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:50.400
 So we really do want Psyche to make an impact in the world commercially, physically, metaphysically

2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:56.560
 in the next small number of years, two, three, five years, not two, three, five decades anymore.

2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:04.760
 And so this is really driving me toward this sort of commercialization and increasingly

2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:08.080
 widespread application of Psyche.

2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:13.560
 Whereas before, I felt that I could just sort of sit back, roll my eyes, wait till the world

2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:14.560
 caught up.

2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:16.600
 And now I don't feel that way anymore.

2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:22.440
 I feel like I need to put in some effort to make the world aware of what we have and what

2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:23.920
 it can do.

2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:27.360
 And the good news from your point of view is that that's why I'm sitting here.

2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:30.640
 You're going to be more productive.

2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:31.720
 I love it.

2:49:31.720 --> 2:49:34.360
 And if I can help in any way, I would love to.

2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:41.760
 From a programmer perspective, I love, especially these days, just contributing in small and

2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:42.840
 big ways.

2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:48.680
 So if there's any open sourcing from an MIT side and the research, I would love to help.

2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:53.520
 But bigger than Psyche, like I said, it's that little flame that you're carrying of

2:49:53.520 --> 2:49:58.600
 artificial intelligence, the big dream.

2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:02.360
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:05.080
 That's a good question.

2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:15.920
 People think of me as one of the pioneers or inventors of the AI that is ubiquitous

2:50:15.920 --> 2:50:19.480
 and that they take for granted and so on.

2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:28.440
 Much the way that today we look back on the pioneers of electricity or the pioneers of

2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:33.200
 similar types of technologies and so on.

2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:40.000
 It's hard to imagine what life would be like if these people hadn't done what they did.

2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:44.000
 So that's one thing that I'd like to be remembered as.

2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:53.680
 Another is that the creator, one of the originators of this gigantic knowledge store and acquisition

2:50:53.680 --> 2:51:00.360
 system that is likely to be at the center of whatever this future AI thing will look

2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:01.360
 like.

2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:02.360
 Yes, exactly.

2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:11.440
 And I'd also like to be remembered as someone who wasn't afraid to spend several decades

2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:23.400
 on a project in a time when almost all of the other forces, institutional forces and

2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:29.920
 commercial forces, are incenting people to go for short term rewards.

2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:31.400
 And a lot of people gave up.

2:51:31.400 --> 2:51:40.320
 A lot of people that dreamt the same dream as you gave up and you didn't.

2:51:40.320 --> 2:51:42.800
 I mean, Doug, it's truly an honor.

2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:45.200
 This is a long time coming.

2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:53.120
 A lot of people bring up your work specifically and more broadly, philosophically of this

2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:55.580
 is the dream of artificial intelligence.

2:51:55.580 --> 2:51:57.800
 This is likely a part of the future.

2:51:57.800 --> 2:52:02.080
 We're so sort of focused on machine learning applications, all that kind of stuff today.

2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:08.520
 But it seems like the ideas that Cite carries forward is something that will be at the center

2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:15.640
 of this problem they're all trying to solve, which is the problem of intelligence, emotional

2:52:15.640 --> 2:52:16.640
 and otherwise.

2:52:16.640 --> 2:52:18.440
 So thank you so much.

2:52:18.440 --> 2:52:22.760
 It's such a huge honor that you would talk to me and spend your valuable time with me

2:52:22.760 --> 2:52:23.760
 today.

2:52:23.760 --> 2:52:24.760
 Thanks for talking.

2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:25.760
 Thanks, Lex.

2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:26.760
 It's been great.

2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:29.480
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Doug Lenat.

2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:33.760
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:40.160
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Mark Twain about the nature of truth.

2:52:40.160 --> 2:52:44.320
 If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.

2:52:44.320 --> 2:53:07.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
