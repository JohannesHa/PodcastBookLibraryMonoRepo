00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
 I believe our official scientific worldview is incompatible with the reality of consciousness.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.800
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

00:06.800 --> 00:09.680
 We could be in the matrix, this could be a very vivid dream.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.560
 There's going to be a few people that are now visualizing a pink elephant.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.240
 A hamster has consciousness.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.960
 Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.840
 Consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern.

00:23.840 --> 00:31.840
 Do you think there will be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we're not morally okay turning off the power to a robot?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.640
 The following is a conversation with Philip Goff.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.520
 Philosopher specializing in the philosophy of mind and consciousness.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.920
 He is a panpsychist, which means he believes that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous

00:49.920 --> 00:54.080
 feature of physical reality, of all matter in the universe.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.120
 He is the author of Galileo's Error, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness,

00:59.120 --> 01:04.720
 and is the host of an excellent podcast called Mind Chat.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.560
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.840
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.400
 And now, here's my conversation with Philip Goff.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.640
 I opened my second podcast conversation with Elon Musk.

01:18.640 --> 01:22.400
 With a question about consciousness and panpsychism.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.040
 The question was, quote, does consciousness permeate all matter?

01:27.040 --> 01:29.280
 I don't know why I opened the conversation this way.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.840
 He looked at me like, what the hell is this guy talking about?

01:31.840 --> 01:36.960
 So he said no, because we wouldn't be able to tell if it did or not.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.920
 So it's outside the realm of the scientific method.

01:39.920 --> 01:45.360
 Do you agree or disagree with Elon Musk's answer?

01:45.360 --> 01:50.400
 I disagree, I guess I do think consciousness pervades matter.

01:50.400 --> 01:56.640
 In fact, I think consciousness is the ultimate nature of matter.

01:56.640 --> 02:06.400
 So as for whether it's outside of the scientific method, I think there's a fundamental challenge

02:06.400 --> 02:12.080
 at the heart of the science of consciousness that we need to face up to, which is that

02:12.080 --> 02:15.520
 consciousness is not publicly observable.

02:15.520 --> 02:21.200
 I can't look inside your head and see your feelings and experiences.

02:21.200 --> 02:27.520
 We know about consciousness not from doing experiments or public observation.

02:27.520 --> 02:33.520
 We just know about it from our immediate awareness of our feelings and experiences.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.440
 It's qualitative, not quantitative, as you talk about.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.960
 Yeah, that's another aspect of it.

02:38.960 --> 02:48.800
 So there are a couple of reasons consciousness, I think, is not fully susceptible to the standard

02:48.800 --> 02:50.320
 scientific approach.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.800
 One reason you've just raised is that it's qualitative rather than quantitative.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.760
 Another reason is it's not publicly observable.

02:57.760 --> 03:06.000
 So science is used to dealing with unobservables, fundamental particles, quantum wave functions,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.080
 other universes, none of these things are observable.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.400
 But there's an important difference.

03:12.400 --> 03:20.800
 With all these things, we postulate unobservables in order to explain what we can observe.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.280
 In the whole of science, that's how it works.

03:25.280 --> 03:31.200
 In the case of consciousness, in the unique case of consciousness, the thing we are trying

03:31.200 --> 03:34.960
 to explain is not publicly observable.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.040
 And that is utterly unique.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.480
 If we want to fully bring science into consciousness, we need a more expansive conception of the

03:42.480 --> 03:43.440
 scientific method.

03:43.440 --> 03:48.400
 So it doesn't mean we can't explain consciousness scientifically, but we need to rethink what

03:48.400 --> 03:49.200
 science is.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.080
 What do you mean publicly, the word publicly observable?

03:52.080 --> 03:55.200
 Is there something interesting to be said about the word publicly?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.640
 I suppose versus privately.

03:56.640 --> 04:06.560
 Yeah, it's tricky to define, but I suppose the data of physics are available to anybody.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.920
 If there were aliens who visited us from another planet, maybe they'd have very different sense

04:11.920 --> 04:12.880
 organs.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.440
 Maybe they'd struggle to understand our art or our music.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.960
 But if they were intelligent enough to do mathematics, they could understand our physics.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.280
 They could look at the data of our experiments.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.360
 They could run the experiments themselves.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.040
 Whereas consciousness, is it observable?

04:31.040 --> 04:31.920
 Is it not observable?

04:31.920 --> 04:33.280
 In a sense, it's observable.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.400
 As you say, we could say it's privately observable.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.520
 I am directly aware of my own feelings and experiences.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.680
 If I'm in pain, it's just right there for me.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.880
 My pain is just totally directly evident to me.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.560
 But you from the outside cannot directly access my pain.

04:54.560 --> 05:02.960
 You can access my pain behavior, or you can ask me, but you can't access my pain in the

05:02.960 --> 05:05.280
 way that I can access my pain.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.560
 So I think that's a distinction.

05:09.440 --> 05:14.720
 It might be difficult to totally pin it down how we define those things, but I think there's

05:14.720 --> 05:17.520
 a fairly clear and very important difference there.

05:17.520 --> 05:23.360
 So you think there's a kind of direct observation that you're able to do of your pain that I'm

05:23.360 --> 05:23.920
 not.

05:23.920 --> 05:30.240
 So my observation, all the ways in which I can sneak up to observing your pain is indirect

05:31.040 --> 05:32.400
 versus yours is direct.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.560
 Can you play devil's advocate?

05:34.560 --> 05:41.680
 Is it possible for me to get closer and closer and closer to being able to observe your pain,

05:42.720 --> 05:48.320
 like all the subjective experiences, yours in the way that you do?

05:49.520 --> 05:50.080
 Yeah.

05:50.080 --> 05:56.400
 I mean, so of course, it's not that we observe behavior and then we make an inference.

05:56.400 --> 06:06.000
 We are hardwired to instinctively interpret smiles as happiness, crying as sadness.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.520
 And as we get to know someone, we find it very easy to adopt their perspective, get

06:11.520 --> 06:12.560
 into their shoes.

06:12.560 --> 06:20.960
 But strictly speaking, all we have perceptual access to is someone's behavior.

06:20.960 --> 06:28.320
 And if you were just, strictly speaking, if you were trying to explain someone's behavior,

06:28.320 --> 06:33.520
 those aspects that are publicly observable, I don't think you'd ever have recourse to

06:33.520 --> 06:34.480
 attribute consciousness.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.600
 You could just postulate some kind of mechanism if you were just trying to explain the behavior.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.120
 So someone like Daniel Dennett is very consistent on this.

06:44.080 --> 06:53.360
 So I think for most people, what science is in the business of is explaining the data

06:53.360 --> 06:55.200
 of public observation experiment.

06:55.200 --> 07:02.400
 If you religiously followed that, you would not postulate consciousness because it's not

07:02.400 --> 07:04.240
 a datum that's known about in that way.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.320
 And Daniel Dennett is really consistent on this.

07:06.320 --> 07:12.560
 He thinks my consciousness cannot be empirically verified and therefore it doesn't exist.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.800
 Dennett is consistent on this.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.000
 I think I'm consistent on this.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.880
 But I think a lot of people have a slightly confused middle way position on this.

07:22.880 --> 07:31.040
 On the one hand, they think the business of science is just to account for public observation

07:31.040 --> 07:38.000
 experiment, but on the other hand, they also believe in consciousness without appreciating,

07:38.000 --> 07:45.200
 I think, that that implies that there is another datum over and above the data of public observation

07:45.200 --> 07:49.040
 experiments, namely just the reality of feelings and experiences.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.960
 As we walk along this conversation, you keep opening doors that I don't want to walk into

07:52.960 --> 07:56.480
 and I will, but I want to try to stay kind of focused.

07:56.480 --> 08:03.040
 You mentioned Daniel Dennett, let's lay it out since he sticks to his story, pun unintended,

08:03.040 --> 08:05.360
 and then you stick to yours.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.560
 What is your story?

08:06.560 --> 08:09.200
 What is your theory of consciousness versus his?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.880
 Can you clarify his position?

08:12.880 --> 08:20.640
 So my view, I defend the view known as panpsychism, which is the view that consciousness is a

08:20.640 --> 08:23.680
 fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.

08:23.680 --> 08:29.600
 So it doesn't literally mean that everything is conscious despite the meaning of the word

08:29.600 --> 08:36.880
 pan, everything, psyche, mind, so literally that means everything has mind, but the typical

08:36.880 --> 08:43.840
 commitment of the panpsychist is that the fundamental building blocks of reality, maybe

08:43.840 --> 08:50.960
 fundamental particles like electrons and quarks, have incredibly simple forms of experience

08:50.960 --> 08:57.600
 and that the very complex experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in

08:57.600 --> 09:02.720
 or derived from this much more simple consciousness at the level of fundamental physics.

09:03.360 --> 09:11.840
 So I mean that's a theory that I would justify on the grounds that it can account for this

09:12.400 --> 09:18.400
 datum of consciousness that we are immediately aware of in our experience in a way that I

09:18.400 --> 09:22.720
 don't think other theories can. If you asked me to contrast that to Daniel Dennett, I think

09:22.720 --> 09:27.360
 he would just say there is no such datum. Dennett says the data for science of consciousness

09:27.360 --> 09:34.000
 is what he calls heterophenomenology, which is specifically defined as what we can access

09:34.000 --> 09:40.640
 from the third person perspective, including what people say, but crucially, we're not

09:40.640 --> 09:46.240
 treating what they say. We're not relying on their testimony as evidence for some

09:46.240 --> 09:54.160
 unobservable realm of feelings and experiences. We're just treating what they say as a datum

09:54.160 --> 09:59.040
 of public observation experiments that we can account for in terms of underlying mechanisms.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.240
 But I feel like there's a deeper view of what consciousness is. So you have a very clear,

10:04.240 --> 10:10.000
 and we'll talk quite a bit about panpsychism, but you have a clear view of what, you know,

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
 almost like a physics view of consciousness. He, I think, has a kind of unique view of

10:16.000 --> 10:25.520
 you that consciousness is almost a side effect of this massively parallel computation system

10:25.520 --> 10:34.160
 going on in our brain, that the brain has a model of the world and it's taking in perceptions

10:34.160 --> 10:39.920
 and it's constantly weaving multiple stories about that world that's integrating the new

10:39.920 --> 10:46.000
 perceptions and the multiple stories are somehow, it's like a Google doc, collaborative editing,

10:46.000 --> 10:54.000
 and that collaborative editing is the actual experience of what we think of as consciousness.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.440
 Somehow the editing is consciousness of this, of this story. I mean, that's a theory of

11:01.440 --> 11:08.240
 consciousness, isn't it? The narrative theory of consciousness or the multiple versions

11:08.240 --> 11:12.000
 editing, collaborative editing of a narrative theory of consciousness.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.640
 Yeah, he calls it the multiple drafts model. Incidentally, there's a very interesting paper

11:16.640 --> 11:22.240
 just come out by very good philosopher Luke Roloff's defending a panpsychist version

11:22.240 --> 11:24.800
 of Dennett's multiple drafts model.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.720
 Like a deeper turtle that that turtle is stacked on top of.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.520
 Just the difference being that this is Luke Roloff's view, all of the drafts are conscious.

11:33.520 --> 11:42.000
 So I guess for Dennett, there's sort of no fact of the matter about which of these drafts

11:42.000 --> 11:47.680
 is the correct one. On Roloff's view, maybe there's no fact of the matter about which

11:47.680 --> 11:53.760
 of these drafts is my consciousness, but nonetheless, all the drafts correspond to

11:53.760 --> 11:58.400
 some consciousness. And I mean, it just sounds kind of funny. I guess I think he calls it

11:58.400 --> 12:05.040
 Dennettian panpsychism. But Luke is one of the most rigorous and serious philosophers

12:05.600 --> 12:09.760
 alive at the moment, I think. And I hate having Luke Roloff's in an audience if I'm giving a

12:09.760 --> 12:14.480
 talk because he always cuts straight to the weakness in your position that you hadn't

12:14.480 --> 12:18.960
 thought of. And so it's nice, panpsychism is sometimes associated with fluffy thinking,

12:18.960 --> 12:24.720
 but contemporary panpsychists have come out of this tradition we call analytic philosophy,

12:24.720 --> 12:32.800
 which is rooted in detailed, rigorous argumentation. And it is defended in that manner.

12:34.160 --> 12:38.400
 Yeah. Those analytic philosophers are sticklers for terminology. It's very fun,

12:38.400 --> 12:40.640
 very fun group to talk shit with.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.600
 Yeah. Well, I mean, it gets boring if you just start and end defining words, right?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.240
 Yeah.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.840
 I think starting with defining words is good. Actually, the philosopher Derek Parfitt said

12:49.840 --> 12:56.080
 when he first was thinking about philosophy, he went to a talk in analytic philosophy,

12:56.080 --> 13:00.640
 and he went to a talk in continental philosophy, and he decided that the problem with the

13:00.640 --> 13:04.480
 continental philosophy, if it was really unrigorous, really imprecise, the problem

13:04.480 --> 13:10.080
 with the analytic philosophy is it was just not about anything important. And he thought

13:10.080 --> 13:15.440
 there was more chance of working within analytic philosophy and asking some more meaningful,

13:15.440 --> 13:19.680
 some more profound questions than there was in working in continental philosophy and making it

13:19.680 --> 13:23.760
 more rigorous. Now, they're both horrific stereotypes, and I don't want to get nasty

13:23.760 --> 13:28.880
 emails from either of these groups, but there's something to what he was saying there.

13:28.880 --> 13:35.920
 I think just a tiny tangent on terminology. I do think that there's a lot of deep

13:35.920 --> 13:40.320
 insight to be discovered by just asking questions. What do we mean by this word?

13:40.320 --> 13:45.760
 I remember I was taking a course on algorithms and data structures in computer science,

13:45.760 --> 13:51.200
 and the instructor, shout out to him, Ali Chakrafande, amazing professor, I remember

13:51.200 --> 13:57.520
 he asked some basic questions like, what is an algorithm? The pressure of pushing students to

13:57.520 --> 14:02.320
 answer, to think deeply, you know, you just woke up hungover in college or whatever,

14:02.320 --> 14:05.920
 and you're tasked with answering some deep philosophical question about what is an

14:05.920 --> 14:11.760
 algorithm? These basic questions, and they sound very simple, but they're actually very difficult.

14:11.760 --> 14:16.480
 And one of the things I really value in conversation is asking these dumb, simple

14:16.480 --> 14:23.120
 questions of like, you know, what is intelligence? And just continually asking that question over and

14:23.120 --> 14:29.360
 over of some of the sort of biggest research in the researchers in the artificial intelligence

14:29.360 --> 14:34.960
 computer science space is actually very useful. At the same time, you know, it should start a

14:34.960 --> 14:41.760
 terminology and then progress where you kind of say, fuck it, we'll just assume we know what we

14:41.760 --> 14:47.920
 mean by that. Otherwise, you get the Bill Clinton situation where it's like, what is the meaning of

14:47.920 --> 14:56.320
 is, is whatever he said, it's like, hey, man, did you do the sex stuff or not? Yeah. So there's,

14:56.320 --> 15:01.680
 you have to both be able to talk about the sex stuff and the meaning of the word is.

15:01.680 --> 15:09.200
 With consciousness, because we don't currently understand, you know, very much terminology

15:09.200 --> 15:16.080
 discussions are very important because it's like you're almost trying to sneak, sneak up to some

15:16.080 --> 15:22.080
 deep insight by just discussing some basic terminology, you know, like what is consciousness

15:22.080 --> 15:29.360
 or even defining the different aspects of panpsychism is fascinating. But just to linger

15:29.360 --> 15:40.000
 on the Daniel Dennett thing, what do you think about narrative, sort of the mind constructing

15:40.000 --> 15:47.520
 narratives for ourselves? So there's nothing special about consciousness deeply. It is some

15:47.520 --> 15:56.000
 property of the human mind that's just is able to tell these pretty stories that we experience as

15:56.000 --> 16:01.520
 consciousness and that it's unique perhaps to the human mind, which is, I suppose, what Daniel

16:01.520 --> 16:08.320
 Dennett would argue that it's either deeply unique or mostly unique to the human mind.

16:08.880 --> 16:15.760
 It's just on the question of terminology before. Yes, I think it used to be the fashion among

16:15.760 --> 16:21.840
 philosophers that we had to come up with utterly precise, necessary and sufficient conditions for

16:21.840 --> 16:27.840
 each word. And then I think this has gone out of fashion a bit, partly because it's just been,

16:28.800 --> 16:34.080
 you know, such a failure. The word knowledge in particular, people used to define knowledge as

16:34.080 --> 16:40.320
 true justified belief. And then this guy Gettier had this very short paper where he just produced

16:40.320 --> 16:44.640
 some pretty conclusive counter examples to that. I think, you know, he wrote very few papers,

16:44.640 --> 16:49.280
 but this is just, you know, you have to teach this on an undergraduate philosophy course.

16:49.280 --> 16:55.280
 And then after that, you had a huge literature of people trying to address this and propose a

16:55.280 --> 16:59.200
 new definition, but then someone else would come out with counter examples and then you get a new

16:59.200 --> 17:02.800
 definition of knowledge and counter examples and it just went on and on and never seemed to get

17:02.800 --> 17:08.800
 anywhere. So I think the thought now is let's work out how precise we need to be for what we're

17:08.800 --> 17:12.880
 trying to do. And I think that's a healthier attitude. So precision is important, but you

17:12.880 --> 17:19.200
 just need to work out how precise do we need to be for these purposes. Coming to Dennett and

17:19.200 --> 17:28.720
 narrative theories, I mean, I think narrative theories are a plausible contender for a theory

17:28.720 --> 17:38.160
 of the self, theory of my identity over time, what makes me the same person in some sense today as I

17:38.160 --> 17:45.280
 was 20 years ago, given that I've changed so much physically and psychologically. One running

17:45.280 --> 17:52.400
 contender is something connected to the kind of stories we tell about ourselves or maybe some

17:52.400 --> 17:57.600
 story about the psychological, the chains of psychological continuity. I'm not saying I accept

17:57.600 --> 18:04.000
 such a theory, but it's plausible. I don't think these theories are good as theories of consciousness,

18:05.040 --> 18:12.560
 at least if we're taking consciousness just to be subjective experience, pleasure, pain, seeing

18:12.560 --> 18:20.080
 color, hearing sound. I think a hamster has consciousness in that sense. There's something

18:20.080 --> 18:26.240
 that it's like to be a hamster. It feels pain if you stand on it. If you're cruel enough to do,

18:26.240 --> 18:31.040
 I don't know why I gave that. People always give, I don't know, philosophers give these very violent

18:31.040 --> 18:34.720
 examples to get the cross consciousness and it's, yeah, I don't know why that's coming

18:34.720 --> 18:43.120
 about, but anyway. You say mean things to the hamster. It experiences pain, it experiences

18:43.120 --> 18:48.240
 pleasure, joy. I mean, but there's some limits to that experience of a hamster,

18:48.240 --> 18:53.040
 but there is nevertheless the presence of a subjective experience. Yeah. Consciousness is

18:53.040 --> 18:57.840
 just something, I mean, it's a very ambiguous word, but if we're just using it to mean some

18:57.840 --> 19:03.760
 kind of experience, some kind of inner life, that is pretty widespread in the animal kingdom.

19:03.760 --> 19:09.680
 A bit difficult to say where it stops, where it starts, but you certainly don't need something

19:09.680 --> 19:15.520
 as sophisticated as the capacity to self consciously tell stories about yourself to just

19:15.520 --> 19:23.440
 have experience. Except for cats who are evil automatons that are void of consciousness. They're

19:23.440 --> 19:29.120
 the fingertips of the devil. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I was taking that as read. I mean, Descartes

19:29.120 --> 19:35.040
 thought animals were mechanisms and humans are unique. So animals are robots essentially in the

19:35.040 --> 19:41.920
 formulation of Descartes and humans are unique. Yeah. So in which way would you say humans are

19:41.920 --> 19:50.880
 unique versus even our closest ancestors? Like, is there something special about humans?

19:52.480 --> 19:57.200
 What is in your view under the panpsychism? I guess we're walking backwards because we'll

19:57.200 --> 20:03.680
 we'll have the big picture conversation about what is panpsychism, but given your kind of broad theory

20:03.680 --> 20:09.920
 of consciousness, what's unique about humans, do you think? As a panpsychist, there is a great

20:09.920 --> 20:18.240
 continuity between humans and the rest of the universe. There's nothing that special about

20:18.240 --> 20:24.000
 human consciousness. It's just a highly evolved form of what exists throughout the universe.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
 So we're very much continuous with the rest of the physical universe. What is unique about human

20:30.000 --> 20:39.120
 beings? I suppose the capacity to reflect on our conscious experience, plan for the future,

20:40.720 --> 20:48.560
 the capacity, I would say, to respond to reasons as well. I mean, animals in some sense have

20:48.560 --> 20:56.480
 motivations, but when a human being makes a decision, they're responding to what philosophers

20:56.480 --> 21:00.640
 called normative considerations. You know, if you're saying, should I take this job in the U.S.?

21:01.520 --> 21:05.440
 You weigh it up. You say, well, you know, I'll get more money. I'll have maybe a better quality

21:05.440 --> 21:11.440
 of life. But if I stay in the UK, I'll be closer to family. And you weigh up these considerations.

21:11.440 --> 21:19.920
 I'm not sure any nonhuman animals quite respond to considerations of value in that way. I mean,

21:19.920 --> 21:24.400
 I might be reflecting here that I'm something of an objectivist about value. I think there are

21:25.440 --> 21:31.200
 objective facts about what we have reason to do and what we have reason to believe.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.480
 And humans have access to those facts.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.240
 And humans have access to them and can respond to them. That's a controversial claim. You know,

21:36.240 --> 21:42.720
 many of my panpsychist brethren might not go for that.

21:42.720 --> 21:48.480
 They would say the hamster, too, can look up to the stars and ponder theoretical physics.

21:48.480 --> 21:53.120
 Maybe not, but I think it depends what you think about value. If you have a more

21:54.720 --> 21:59.600
 Humean picture of value, by which I mean, relating to the philosopher David Hume,

21:59.600 --> 22:05.120
 who said reason is the slave of the passions. Really, we just have motivations

22:05.120 --> 22:11.120
 and what we have reason to do arises from our motivations. I'm not a Humean. I think there are

22:11.120 --> 22:17.440
 objective facts about what we have reason to do. And I think we have access to them. I don't think

22:17.440 --> 22:24.160
 any nonhuman animal has access to objective facts about what they have reason to do, what they have

22:24.160 --> 22:30.400
 reason to believe. They don't weigh up evidence. Reason is a slave of the passions.

22:30.400 --> 22:35.920
 Matthew That was David Hume's view, yeah. I mean, yeah, do you want to know my problem with Hume's?

22:35.920 --> 22:40.240
 I had a radical conversion. This might not be connected. It's not connected to panpsychism,

22:40.240 --> 22:46.080
 but I had a radical conversion. I used to have a more Humean view when I was a graduate student,

22:46.800 --> 22:51.680
 but I was persuaded by some professors at the University of Reading where I was

22:51.680 --> 23:01.680
 that if you have the Humean view, you have to say any basic life goals are equal, equally valid.

23:03.120 --> 23:09.680
 So for example, let's take someone whose basic goal in life is counting blades of grass, right?

23:10.240 --> 23:15.520
 And crucially, they don't enjoy it, right? This is the crucial point. They get no pleasure from it.

23:15.520 --> 23:20.800
 That's just their basic goal to spend their life counting as many blades of grass

23:20.800 --> 23:24.000
 as possible. Not for some greater goal. That's just their basic goal.

23:25.840 --> 23:31.280
 I want to say that that is objectively stupid. That is objectively pointless.

23:31.280 --> 23:38.320
 I shouldn't say stupid. It's objectively pointless in a way that pursuing pleasure

23:38.320 --> 23:43.120
 or pursuing someone else's pleasure or pursuing scientific inquiry is not pointless.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.920
 As soon as you make that admission, you're not a follower of David Hume anymore. You think

23:47.920 --> 23:52.640
 there are objective facts about what goals are worth pursuing.

23:54.240 --> 24:00.720
 Is it possible to have a goal without pleasure? So this kind of idea that you disjoint the two.

24:01.360 --> 24:06.960
 So the David Foster Wallace idea of, you know, the key to life is to be unboreable.

24:06.960 --> 24:13.840
 Isn't it possible to discover the pleasure in everything in life? The counting of the

24:13.840 --> 24:19.440
 blades of grass. Once you see the mastery, the skill of it, you can discover the pleasure.

24:19.440 --> 24:26.720
 Therefore, you know, I guess what I'm asking is why and when and how did you lose the romance

24:26.720 --> 24:30.960
 in grad school? Is that what you're trying to say?

24:30.960 --> 24:36.640
 I think it may or may not be true that it's possible to find pleasure in everything.

24:37.440 --> 24:43.040
 But I think it's also true that people don't act solely for pleasure. And they certainly

24:43.040 --> 24:49.280
 don't act solely for their own pleasure. People will suffer for things they think are worthwhile.

24:49.280 --> 24:56.560
 I might, you know, I might suffer for some scientific cause for finding out a cure for

24:56.560 --> 25:04.480
 the pandemic. And in terms of my own pleasure, I might have less pleasure in doing that. But I

25:04.480 --> 25:09.600
 think it's worthwhile. It's a worthwhile thing to do. I just don't think it's the case that

25:09.600 --> 25:14.400
 everything we do is rooted in maximizing our own pleasure. I don't think that's even

25:14.400 --> 25:15.600
 psychologically plausible.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.360
 But pleasure, then that's a narrow kind of view of pleasure. That's like a short term

25:19.360 --> 25:26.400
 pleasure. But you can see pleasure is a kind of ability to hear the music in the distance.

25:26.400 --> 25:33.440
 It's like, yes, it's difficult now. It's suffering now. But there's some greater thing beyond

25:33.440 --> 25:39.040
 the mountain. That will be joy. I mean, that's kind of a, even if it's not in this life.

25:40.240 --> 25:46.400
 Well, you know, the warriors will meet in Valhalla, right? The feeling that gives meaning

25:46.400 --> 25:51.680
 and fulfillment to life is not necessarily grounded in pleasure of like the counting

25:51.680 --> 26:00.160
 of the grass. It's something else. I don't know. The struggle is a source of deep fulfillment.

26:00.160 --> 26:06.560
 So like, I think pleasure needs to be kind of thought of as a little bit more broadly.

26:06.560 --> 26:15.760
 It just kind of gives you this sense. It for a moment allows you to forget the terror of

26:15.760 --> 26:22.400
 the fact that you're going to die. That's pleasure. Like that's the broader view of

26:22.400 --> 26:30.560
 pleasure that you get to kind of play in the little illusion that all of this has deep

26:30.560 --> 26:32.640
 meaning. That's pleasure.

26:32.640 --> 26:41.200
 Yeah. Well, but I mean, you know, people sacrifice their lives. Atheists may sacrifice their

26:41.200 --> 26:46.080
 lives for the sake of someone else or for the sake of something important enough. And

26:46.080 --> 26:51.760
 clearly in that case, they're not doing it for the sake of their own pleasure. That's a rather

26:51.760 --> 26:59.040
 dramatic example, but they can be just trivial examples where, you know, I choose to be honest

26:59.040 --> 27:06.560
 rather than lie about something. Can I lose out a bit? And I have a bit less pleasure, but I thought

27:06.560 --> 27:10.480
 it was worth doing the honest thing or something. I mean, I just think, so that's a, I mean, maybe

27:10.480 --> 27:14.400
 you can use the word pleasure so broadly that you're just essentially meaning something.

27:14.400 --> 27:19.440
 Worthwhile, but then I think the word pleasure, maybe, maybe loses its meaning.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.160
 Sure. Well, but what do you think about the blades of grass case? What do you think about

27:24.160 --> 27:27.600
 someone who spends their life counting blades of grass and doesn't enjoy it?

27:28.160 --> 27:35.120
 So I think, I personally think it's impossible or maybe I'm not understanding even like the

27:35.120 --> 27:39.200
 philosophical formulation, but I think it's impossible to have a goal and not draw pleasure

27:39.200 --> 27:46.400
 from it. Make it worthwhile, forget the word pleasure. I think the word goal loses meaning.

27:46.400 --> 27:52.720
 If I say I'm going to count the number of pens on this table, if I'm actively involved in the task,

27:52.720 --> 28:01.680
 I will find joy in it. I will find, like, I think there's a lot of meaning and joy to be discovered

28:01.680 --> 28:11.280
 in the skill of a task, in mastering of a skill and taking pride in doing it well. I mean, that's,

28:12.320 --> 28:18.800
 I don't know what it is about the human mind, but there's some joy to be discovered in the mastery

28:18.800 --> 28:24.320
 of a skill. So I think it's just impossible to count blades of grass and not sort of have the

28:24.320 --> 28:33.280
 gyro dreams of sushi compelling, like draws you into the mastery of the simple task.

28:33.280 --> 28:40.480
 Hmm. Yeah, I suppose, I mean, in a way you might think it's just hard to imagine someone who would

28:41.600 --> 28:47.760
 spend their lives doing that, but then maybe that's just because it's so evident that that is

28:47.760 --> 28:54.800
 a pointless task. Whereas if we take this David Hume view seriously, it ought to be, you know,

28:54.800 --> 29:01.520
 a totally possible life goal. Whereas, I mean, yeah, I guess I just find it hard to shake the

29:01.520 --> 29:09.840
 idea that some ways of some life goals are more worthwhile than others. And it doesn't mean,

29:09.840 --> 29:14.880
 you know, that there's a one single way you should lead your life, but pursuing knowledge,

29:14.880 --> 29:23.120
 helping people, pursuing your own pleasure to an extent are worthwhile things to do in a way that,

29:23.120 --> 29:29.680
 you know, for example, I have, I'm a little bit OCD. I still feel inclined to walk on cracks in

29:29.680 --> 29:34.640
 the pavement or do it symmetrically. Like if I step on a crack with my left foot, I feel the need

29:34.640 --> 29:40.320
 to do it with my right foot. And I think that's kind of pointless. It's something I feel the urge

29:40.320 --> 29:46.720
 to do, but it's pointless. Whereas other things I choose to do, I think there's, it's worth doing.

29:46.720 --> 29:52.480
 And it's hard to make sense of metaphysically, what could possibly ground that? How could we

29:52.480 --> 29:56.560
 know about these facts? But that's the starting point for me.

29:56.560 --> 30:05.120
 I don't know. I think you walking on the sidewalk in a way that's symmetrical brings order to the

30:05.120 --> 30:10.400
 world. Like if you weren't doing that, the world might fall apart. And you, it feels like that.

30:11.600 --> 30:20.880
 I think there's, there's, there's meaning in that. Like you embracing the full, like the full

30:20.880 --> 30:26.320
 experience of that, you living the richness of that as if it has meaning, will give meaning to it.

30:26.320 --> 30:32.480
 And then whatever genius comes of that as you as a one little intelligent aunt will make a better

30:32.480 --> 30:37.600
 life for everybody else. Perhaps I'm defending the blades of grass example, because I can literally

30:37.600 --> 30:43.040
 imagine myself enjoying this task as somebody who's OCD in a certain kind of way in quantitative.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.680
 But now you're ruining the exam because you imagine someone enjoying it. I'm imagining

30:45.680 --> 30:52.320
 someone who doesn't enjoy it. We don't want a life that's just full of pleasure. Like we just sit

30:52.320 --> 30:58.080
 there, you know, having a big sugar high all the time. We want a life where we do things that are

30:58.080 --> 31:05.520
 worthwhile. If for something to be worthwhile, just is for it to be a basic life goal, then

31:08.240 --> 31:12.080
 that, that mode of reflection doesn't really make sense. We can't really think,

31:12.080 --> 31:18.240
 did I do things worthwhile on the, on the David Hume type picture? All it is for something to be

31:18.240 --> 31:23.360
 worthwhile is it was a basic goal of yours or derived from a basic goal. And yeah.

31:23.360 --> 31:31.760
 Yeah. I mean, I think goal and worthwhile aren't, I think goal is a boring word. I'm more sort of

31:31.760 --> 31:37.600
 existential. It's like, did you ride the roller coaster of life? Did you fully experience life

31:38.400 --> 31:44.800
 that, and in that sense, I mean, the blaze of grass is something that could be deeply joyful.

31:44.800 --> 31:50.000
 And that's in that way, I think suffering could be joyful in the full context of life. It's the

31:50.000 --> 31:55.600
 roller coaster of life. Like without suffering, without struggle, without pain, without depression,

31:55.600 --> 32:00.800
 with sadness, there's not the highs. I mean, that's this, that's a fucked up thing about life is that

32:02.640 --> 32:13.920
 the lows really make the highs that much richer and deeper and, and like taste better. Right. Like

32:13.920 --> 32:20.960
 the, like I was, I tweeted this, I was, I couldn't sleep and I was like late at night.

32:21.680 --> 32:32.480
 And I know it's like a obvious statement, but like every love story eventually, you know,

32:32.480 --> 32:42.960
 ends in loss in tragedy. So like this feeling of love at the end, there's always going to be

32:42.960 --> 32:49.040
 tragedy. Even if it's the most amazing lifelong love with another human being,

32:50.080 --> 32:57.120
 one of you is going to die. And I don't know which is worse, but both, both are not going to be pretty.

32:57.760 --> 33:04.000
 And so that, the sense that it's finite, the sense that it's going to end in a low,

33:04.720 --> 33:12.000
 that gives like richness to those kind of evenings when you realize this fucking thing ends,

33:12.000 --> 33:20.640
 this thing ends. The feeling that it ends, that bad taste, that bad feeling that it ends

33:20.640 --> 33:25.600
 gives meaning, gives joy, gives, I don't know, pleasure is this loaded word, but

33:26.640 --> 33:34.000
 gives some kind of a deep pleasure to the experience when it's good. And I mean, and that's

33:34.000 --> 33:43.120
 the Blades of Grass, you know, they have that to me. But you're perhaps right that it's like

33:43.840 --> 33:50.880
 reducing it to set of goals or something like that is kind of removing the magic of life.

33:50.880 --> 33:57.440
 Because I think what makes counting the Blades of Grass joyful is just because it's life.

33:57.440 --> 34:04.240
 Okay. So it sounds like you, it sounds like you reject the David Hume type picture anyway,

34:04.240 --> 34:08.880
 because you're saying just because you have it as a goal, that's what it is to be worthwhile.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.400
 But you're saying, no, it's because it's engaging with life, riding the roller coaster.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.400
 So that does sound like in some sense, there are facts independent of our personal goal choices

34:20.400 --> 34:24.800
 about what it means to live a good life. And I mean, coming back full circle to

34:24.800 --> 34:29.520
 the start of this was what makes us different to animals. I don't think at the end of a hamster's

34:29.520 --> 34:34.560
 life, it's it thinks, did I ride the roller coaster? Did I really live life to the full?

34:34.560 --> 34:39.360
 That is not a mode of reflection that's available to non human animals. So

34:40.720 --> 34:48.080
 what do you think is the role of death? And in all of this, the fear of death? Does that

34:48.080 --> 34:57.200
 interplay with consciousness? Does this self reflection? Do you think there's some deep

34:57.200 --> 35:05.680
 connection between this ability to contemplate the fact that the our flame of consciousness

35:05.680 --> 35:13.120
 eventually goes out? Yeah, I don't think unfortunately panpsychism helps particularly

35:13.120 --> 35:20.160
 with life after death, because for the panpsychist, there's nothing supernatural.

35:20.160 --> 35:26.240
 There's nothing beyond the physical. All there is really is ultimately particles and fields.

35:26.240 --> 35:30.320
 It's just that we think the ultimate nature of particles and fields is consciousness.

35:30.960 --> 35:41.200
 But I guess when the matter in my brain ceases to be ordered in a way that

35:41.200 --> 35:48.720
 sustains the particular kind of consciousness I enjoy in waking life, then in some sense,

35:48.720 --> 35:54.720
 I will I will cease to be although I do that the final chapter of my book Galileo's error

35:54.720 --> 36:01.280
 is more experimental. So the first four chapters of the cold blooded case for the panpsychist

36:01.280 --> 36:05.920
 view is that the best solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The last chapter

36:05.920 --> 36:10.080
 we talk about meaning. Yeah, I talk about meaning to about free will. And I talk about

36:10.080 --> 36:17.600
 mystical experiences. So I always want to emphasize that panpsychism is not necessarily

36:17.600 --> 36:22.880
 connected to anything spiritual. You know, a lot of people defending this view, like David Chalmers

36:22.880 --> 36:29.520
 or Luke Roloffs are just total atheist secularists, right? They don't believe in any kind of

36:29.520 --> 36:34.960
 transcendent reality. They just believe in feelings, you know, mundane consciousness and

36:34.960 --> 36:42.800
 think that needs explaining in our conventional scientific approach can't cut it. But if for

36:42.800 --> 36:48.960
 independent reasons you are motivated to some spiritual picture of reality, then maybe a

36:48.960 --> 36:55.920
 panpsychist view is more consonant with that. So if you if you have a mystical experience where you

36:57.600 --> 37:03.840
 it seems to you in this experience that there is this higher form of consciousness at the

37:03.840 --> 37:08.560
 root of all things. If you're a materialist, you've got to think that's a delusion. You know,

37:08.560 --> 37:12.800
 there's just something in your brain making you think that it's not real. But if you're a

37:12.800 --> 37:19.760
 panpsychist and you already think the fundamental nature of reality is constituted of consciousness,

37:19.760 --> 37:27.040
 it's not that much of a leap to think that this higher form of consciousness you seem to

37:27.040 --> 37:33.120
 apprehend in the mystical experience is part of that underlying reality. And, you know, in many

37:33.120 --> 37:41.040
 different cultures, experienced meditators have claimed to have experiences in which it becomes

37:41.040 --> 37:47.920
 apparent to them that there is an element of consciousness that is universal. So this is

37:47.920 --> 37:54.880
 sometimes called universal consciousness. So on this view, your mind and my mind are not

37:56.160 --> 38:02.240
 totally distinct. Each of our individual conscious minds is built upon the foundations

38:02.240 --> 38:07.360
 of universal consciousness. And universal consciousness as it exists in me is one and

38:07.360 --> 38:14.000
 the same thing as universal consciousness as it exists in you. So I've never had one of these

38:14.000 --> 38:21.920
 experiences. But if one is a panpsychist, I think one is more open to that possibility. I don't see

38:21.920 --> 38:27.760
 why it shouldn't be the case that that is part of the nature of consciousness and maybe something

38:27.760 --> 38:32.720
 that is apparent in certain deep states of meditation. And so what I explore in the

38:32.720 --> 38:40.320
 experimental final chapter of my book is that could allow for a kind of impersonal life after

38:40.320 --> 38:47.760
 death. Because if that view is true, then even when the particular aspects of my conscious

38:47.760 --> 38:55.120
 experience fall away, that element of universal consciousness at the core of my identity would

38:55.120 --> 39:00.240
 continue to exist. So I'd sort of be, as it were, absorbed into universal consciousness.

39:00.240 --> 39:10.240
 So Buddhists and Hindu mystics try to meditate to get rid of all the bad karma to be absorbed into

39:10.240 --> 39:16.160
 universal consciousness. It could be that if there's no karma, if there's no reverb, maybe

39:16.160 --> 39:21.600
 everyone gets enlightened when they die. Maybe you just sink back into universal consciousness.

39:21.600 --> 39:30.720
 So I also, coming back to morality, suggest this could provide some kind of basis for altruism or

39:30.720 --> 39:38.080
 non egotism. Because if you think egotism implicitly assumes that we are utterly distinct

39:38.080 --> 39:44.880
 individuals, whereas on this view, we're not, we overlap to an extent that something at the core

39:44.880 --> 39:52.000
 of our being is even in this life, we overlap. That would be this view that some experienced

39:52.000 --> 39:57.440
 meditators claim becomes apparent to them that there is something at the core of my identity

39:58.560 --> 40:04.960
 that is one and the same as the thing at the core of your identity, this universal consciousness.

40:05.680 --> 40:12.320
 Yeah, there is something very, like you and I in this conversation, there's a few people listening

40:12.320 --> 40:20.480
 to this, all of us are in a kind of single mind together. There's some small aspect of that,

40:22.000 --> 40:27.840
 or maybe a big aspect about us humans. So certainly in a space of ideas, we kind of

40:29.360 --> 40:36.160
 meld together for time, at least in a conversation and kind of play with that idea. And then we're

40:36.160 --> 40:41.040
 clearly all thinking, like if I say pink elephant, there's going to be a few people that are now

40:41.040 --> 40:46.800
 visualizing a pink elephant. We're all thinking about that pink elephant together. We're all in

40:46.800 --> 40:54.560
 the room together thinking about this pink elephant and we're like rotating it in our minds

40:54.560 --> 41:01.440
 together. What is that? Is there a different instantiation of that pink elephant in everybody's

41:01.440 --> 41:06.400
 mind or is it the same elephant? And we have the same mind exploring that elephant. Now,

41:06.400 --> 41:11.920
 if we in our mind start petting that elephant, like touching it, that experience that we're now

41:11.920 --> 41:17.200
 like thinking what that would feel like, what's that? Is that all of us experiencing that together

41:17.200 --> 41:22.480
 or is that separate? So like there's some aspect of the togetherness that almost seems fundamental

41:22.480 --> 41:29.040
 to civilization, to society. Hopefully that's not too strong, but to like some of the fundamental

41:29.040 --> 41:35.440
 properties of the human mind, it feels like the social aspect is really important. We call it

41:35.440 --> 41:41.600
 social because we think of us as individual minds interacting, but if we're just like one collective

41:41.600 --> 41:48.560
 mind with like fingertips, they're like touching each other as it's trying to explore the elephant,

41:49.120 --> 41:54.640
 but that could be just in the realm of ideas and intelligence and not in the realm of consciousness

41:54.640 --> 42:00.160
 and it's interesting to see maybe it is in the realm of consciousness. Yeah, so it's obviously

42:00.160 --> 42:05.440
 certainly true in some sense that there are these phenomena that you're talking about of

42:06.320 --> 42:12.400
 collective consciousness in some sense. I suppose the question is how ontologically

42:12.400 --> 42:17.680
 serious do we want to be about those things? By which I mean, are they just a construction

42:17.680 --> 42:24.320
 of out of our minds and the fact that we interact in the standardly scientifically accepted ways

42:24.960 --> 42:28.400
 or is as someone like Rupert Sheldrake would think that there is some

42:28.400 --> 42:33.680
 metaphysical reality, there are some fields beyond the scientifically understood ones that

42:33.680 --> 42:39.120
 are somehow communicating this. I mean, I think that, I mean, the view I was describing was that

42:39.120 --> 42:45.520
 this element we're supposed to have in common is some sort of pure impersonal consciousness or

42:45.520 --> 42:49.600
 something rather than. So actually, I mean, an interesting figure is the Australian philosopher

42:49.600 --> 42:58.240
 Miri Al Bahari, who defends a kind of mystical conception of reality rooted in a advice of Adanta

42:58.240 --> 43:04.800
 mysticism. But like me, she's from this tradition of analytic philosophy. And so she defends this

43:04.800 --> 43:09.200
 in this, you know, incredibly precise, rigorous way. She defends the idea that we should think

43:09.200 --> 43:18.160
 of experienced meditators as providing expert testimony. So, you know, I think humans cause

43:18.160 --> 43:22.960
 a causing climate breakdown. I have no idea of the science behind it, you know, but I trust the

43:22.960 --> 43:27.760
 experts or, you know, that the universe is 14 billion years old. You know, most of our knowledge

43:27.760 --> 43:33.600
 is based on expert testimony. And she thinks we should think of experienced meditators,

43:33.600 --> 43:37.920
 these people who are telling us about this universal consciousness at the core of our being

43:37.920 --> 43:43.920
 as a relevant kind of expert. And so she wants to defend the rational acceptability of this

43:43.920 --> 43:49.280
 mystical conception of reality. So it's what, you know, I think we shouldn't be ashamed, you know,

43:49.280 --> 43:56.240
 we shouldn't be worried about dealing with certain views as long as it's done with rigor

43:56.240 --> 44:01.120
 and seriousness. You know, I think sometimes terms like, I don't know, new age or something

44:01.120 --> 44:07.520
 can function a bit like racist terms. You know, a racist term picks out a group of people, but then

44:07.520 --> 44:11.840
 implies certain negative characteristics. So people use this term, you know, to pick out a

44:11.840 --> 44:19.040
 certain set of views like mystical conception of reality and imply it's kind of fluffy thinking or,

44:19.040 --> 44:25.200
 but, you know, you read Marielle Bihari, you read Luke Roloff's, this is serious, rigorous thought,

44:25.200 --> 44:28.960
 whether you agree with it or not, obviously it's hugely controversial. And so, you know,

44:28.960 --> 44:34.080
 the enlightenment ideal is to follow the evidence and the arguments where they lead.

44:35.280 --> 44:40.000
 But it's kind of very hard for human beings to do that. I think we get stuck in some conception of

44:40.000 --> 44:48.080
 how we think science ought to look. And, you know, people talk about religion as a crutch,

44:48.080 --> 44:54.240
 but I think a certain kind of scientism, a certain conception of how science is supposed to be,

44:54.240 --> 45:01.760
 gets into people's identity and their sense of themselves and their security. And make things

45:01.760 --> 45:10.240
 hard if you're a panpsychist. And even the word expert becomes a kind of crutch. I mean, you use

45:10.240 --> 45:16.320
 the word expert. You have some kind of conception of what expertise means. Oftentimes that's,

45:16.880 --> 45:22.000
 you know, connected with a degree, a particularly prestigious university or something like that. Or,

45:22.480 --> 45:30.000
 or it's, you know, expertise is a funny one. I've noticed that anybody sort of that claims

45:30.000 --> 45:36.400
 they're an expert is usually not the expert. The biggest quote unquote expert that I've ever met

45:36.400 --> 45:41.520
 are the ones that are truly humble. So the humility is a really good sign of somebody

45:42.080 --> 45:47.920
 who's traveled a long road and been humbled by how little they know. So some of the best people

45:47.920 --> 45:52.400
 in the world at whatever the thing they've spent their life doing are the ones that are ultimately

45:52.400 --> 45:59.440
 humble in the face of it all. So like, just being humble for how little we know, even if we travel

45:59.440 --> 46:06.480
 a lifetime. I do like the idea. I mean, treating sort of like, what is it, psychonauts, like an

46:06.480 --> 46:13.120
 expert witness, you know, people who have traveled with the help of DMT to another place where they

46:14.000 --> 46:21.120
 got some deep understanding of something. And their insight is perhaps as valuable as the insight

46:21.120 --> 46:27.120
 of somebody who ran rigorous psychological studies at Princeton University or something.

46:27.920 --> 46:34.880
 Like those psychonauts, they have wisdom, if it's done rigorously, which you can also do rigorously

46:34.880 --> 46:40.160
 within the university, within the studies now, with psilocybin and those kinds of things. Yeah,

46:40.160 --> 46:45.440
 that's a fact that's fascinating. Still probably the best, one of the best works on mystical

46:45.440 --> 46:52.320
 experience is the chapter in William James's Varieties of Religious Experiences. And most of

46:52.320 --> 46:57.680
 it is just a psychological study of trying to define the characteristics of mystical experience

46:57.680 --> 47:04.080
 as a psychological type. But at the end, he considers the question, if you have a mystical

47:04.080 --> 47:09.760
 experience, is it rational to trust it, to trust that it's telling you something about reality?

47:09.760 --> 47:15.600
 Something about reality. And he makes an interesting argument. He says, if you say no, you're kind of

47:15.600 --> 47:22.000
 applying a double standard because we all think it's okay to trust our normal sensory experiences,

47:23.040 --> 47:29.440
 but we have no way of getting outside of ourselves to prove that our sensory experiences correspond

47:29.440 --> 47:33.840
 to an external reality. We could be in the matrix. This could be a very vivid dream.

47:33.840 --> 47:43.360
 You could say, oh, we do science, but a scientist only gets their data by experiencing the results

47:43.360 --> 47:47.120
 of their experiments. And then the question arises again, how do you know that corresponds

47:47.120 --> 47:52.720
 to a real world? So he thinks there's a sort of double standard in saying, it's okay to trust

47:52.720 --> 47:58.480
 our ordinary sensory experiences, but it's not okay for the person on DMT to trust those experiences.

47:58.480 --> 48:04.960
 It's very philosophically difficult to say, why is it okay in the one case and not the other? So I

48:04.960 --> 48:09.760
 think there's an interesting argument there, but I would like to just defend experts a little bit.

48:09.760 --> 48:15.520
 I mean, I agree it's very difficult, but especially in an age, I guess, where there's so much

48:15.520 --> 48:26.160
 information, I do think it's important to have some protection of sources of information,

48:26.160 --> 48:31.360
 academic institutions that we can trust. And then that's difficult because of course there are

48:31.360 --> 48:36.640
 non academics who do know what they're talking about. But like, if I'm interested in knowing

48:36.640 --> 48:42.880
 about biology, you know, you can't research everything. So I think we have to have some sense

48:42.880 --> 48:50.640
 of who are the experts we can trust, the people who've spent a lot of time reading all the material

48:50.640 --> 48:58.080
 that people have read, written, thinking about it, having their views torn apart by other people

48:58.080 --> 49:02.240
 working in the field. I think that is very important. And also to protect that from conflicts

49:02.240 --> 49:07.680
 of interest. There is a so called think tank in the UK called the Institute of Economic Affairs,

49:07.680 --> 49:14.960
 who are always on the BBC as experts on economic questions and they do not declare who funds them.

49:14.960 --> 49:21.680
 Right. So we don't know who's paying the paper. I think, you know, you shouldn't be allowed to call

49:21.680 --> 49:26.480
 yourself a think tank if you're not totally transparent about who's funding you. So I think

49:26.480 --> 49:32.560
 that's it. And I mean, this connects to panpsychism because I think the reason people, you know,

49:33.200 --> 49:37.920
 worry about unorthodox ideas is because they worry about how do we know when we're just

49:37.920 --> 49:42.000
 losing control or losing discipline. So I do think we need to somehow protect

49:42.000 --> 49:49.120
 academic institutions as sources of information that we can trust. And, you know, in philosophy,

49:49.120 --> 49:55.840
 there's, you know, there's not much consensus on everything, but you can at least know what people

49:56.320 --> 50:01.840
 who have put the time in to read all the stuff, what they think about these issues. I think that

50:01.840 --> 50:07.360
 is important. To push back and you push back. Who are the experts on COVID?

50:07.360 --> 50:12.720
 Who are the experts on COVID? Oh, again, it's a dangerous territory now.

50:12.720 --> 50:17.680
 Well, let me just speak to it because I am walking through that dangerous territory.

50:18.400 --> 50:31.360
 I'm allergic to the word expert because in my simple mind, it kind of rhymes with ego.

50:31.360 --> 50:40.320
 There's something about experts. If we allow too much to have a category expert and place

50:40.320 --> 50:45.200
 certain people in them, those people sitting on the throne start to believe it.

50:46.720 --> 50:51.840
 And they start to communicate with that energy and the humility starts to dissipate.

50:51.840 --> 51:03.440
 I think there is value in a lifelong mastery of a skill and the pursuit of knowledge within a very

51:03.440 --> 51:09.680
 specific discipline. But the moment you have your name on an office, the moment you're an expert,

51:10.240 --> 51:18.160
 I think you destroy the very aspect, the very value of that journey towards knowledge.

51:18.160 --> 51:26.480
 So some of it probably just reduces to skillful communication. Communicate in a way that shows

51:26.480 --> 51:33.200
 humility, that shows an open mindedness, that shows an ability to really hear what a lot of

51:33.200 --> 51:39.680
 people are saying. So in the case of COVID, what I've noticed, and this is probably true with

51:39.680 --> 51:48.400
 panpsychism as well, is so called experts, and they are extremely knowledgeable, many of them

51:48.400 --> 51:55.280
 are colleagues of mine, they dismiss what millions of people are saying on the internet

51:55.840 --> 52:02.240
 without having looked into it. With empathy and rigor, honestly, understand what are the

52:02.240 --> 52:06.720
 arguments being made. They say like, there's not enough time to explore all those things,

52:06.720 --> 52:13.360
 like there's so much stuff out there. Yeah, I think that's intellectual laziness. If you don't

52:13.360 --> 52:19.840
 have enough time, then don't speak so strongly with dismissal. Feel bad about it. Be apologetic

52:19.840 --> 52:25.600
 about the fact that you don't have enough time to explore the evidence. For example, with the heat

52:25.600 --> 52:34.560
 I got with Francis Collins is that he kind of said that lab leak, he kind of dismissed the

52:34.560 --> 52:41.680
 heat. He kind of dismissed it, showing that he didn't really deeply explore all the sort of,

52:41.680 --> 52:48.320
 the huge amount of circumstantial evidence out there, the battles that are going on out there.

52:48.320 --> 52:55.360
 There's a lot of people really tensely discussing this and being, showing humility in the face

52:55.920 --> 53:00.800
 of that battle of ideas, I think is really important. And I just been very disappointed

53:00.800 --> 53:07.200
 in so called expertise in the space of science and showing humility and showing humanity and

53:07.200 --> 53:14.400
 kindness and empathy towards other human beings. That's, at the same time, obviously, I love

53:15.200 --> 53:23.040
 Jiro Junsu's sushi lifelong pursuit of like getting, like in computer science, Don Knuth,

53:23.680 --> 53:28.560
 like some of my biggest heroes are people that like, when nobody else cares,

53:28.560 --> 53:34.320
 they stay on one topic for their whole life and they just find the beautiful little things about

53:34.320 --> 53:39.680
 there's puzzles they keep solving. And yes, sometimes a virus happens or something happens

53:39.680 --> 53:46.720
 with that person with their puzzles becomes like the center of the whole world because that puzzles

53:46.720 --> 53:51.760
 becomes all of a sudden really important, but still there's possibilities on them to show humility

53:51.760 --> 53:56.080
 and to be open minded to the fact that they, even if they spent their whole life doing it,

53:56.080 --> 54:01.920
 even if their whole community is telling them, giving them awards and giving them citations

54:01.920 --> 54:07.200
 and giving them all kinds of stuff where like they're bowing down before them, how smart they

54:07.200 --> 54:13.840
 are, they still know nothing relative to all the stuff, the mysteries that are out there.

54:13.840 --> 54:18.800
 Yeah, well, I don't know how much we're disagreeing. I mean, these are totally valid issues and of

54:18.800 --> 54:24.480
 course, expertise goes wrong in all sorts of ways. It's totally fallible. I suppose

54:24.480 --> 54:32.480
 I would just say, what is the alternative? What do we just say? All information is equal.

54:32.480 --> 54:41.600
 Because as a voter, I've got to decide who to vote for and I've got to evaluate and I can't

54:41.600 --> 54:52.000
 look into all of the economics and all of the relevant science. And so I just think maybe it's

54:52.000 --> 54:56.720
 like Churchill said about democracy, it's the worst system of government apart from all the rest.

54:57.360 --> 55:01.360
 I think about panpsychism, it's the worst theory of consciousness apart from all the rest.

55:01.360 --> 55:09.120
 But I just think expertise, the peer review system, I think it's terrible in so many ways.

55:09.600 --> 55:15.760
 Yes, people should show more humility, but I can't see a viable alternative. I think

55:15.760 --> 55:20.560
 philosopher Bernard Williams had a really nice nuanced discussion of the problems of titles

55:20.560 --> 55:29.840
 and how they also function in a society. They do have some positive function. The very first time

55:29.840 --> 55:40.480
 I lectured in philosophy before I got a professorship was teaching at a continuing

55:40.480 --> 55:48.400
 education college. So it's kind of retired people who want to learn some more things. And I just

55:48.400 --> 55:54.480
 totally pitched it too high. And Gait talked about Bernard Williams on titles and hierarchies.

55:54.480 --> 56:00.800
 And these kind of people in their 70s and 80s would just instantly started interrupting saying,

56:00.800 --> 56:07.360
 what is philosophy? And it was a disaster. And I just remember in the breaks, a sort of elderly

56:07.360 --> 56:14.400
 lady came up and said, I've decided to take Egyptology instead. But that was my introduction

56:14.400 --> 56:21.920
 to teaching. Anyway. But sort of titles and accomplishments is a nice starting point,

56:21.920 --> 56:28.880
 but doesn't buy you the whole thing. So you don't get to just say, this is true because I'm an

56:28.880 --> 56:34.960
 expert. You still have to convince people. One of the things I really like to practice martial arts.

56:34.960 --> 56:42.160
 Yeah. And for people who don't know, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is one of them. And you sometimes wear

56:42.160 --> 56:47.840
 these pajamas, pajama looking things, and you wear a belt. So I happen to be a black belt in

56:47.840 --> 56:53.760
 Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And I also train in what's called no gi, so you don't wear the pajamas.

56:54.400 --> 57:00.480
 And when you don't wear the pajamas, nobody knows what rank you are. Nobody knows if you're a black

57:00.480 --> 57:06.640
 belt or a white belt or if you're a complete beginner or not. And when you wear the pajamas

57:06.640 --> 57:13.440
 called the gi, you wear the rank. And people treat you very differently. When they see my black belt,

57:13.440 --> 57:20.720
 they treat me differently. They kind of defer to my expertise. If they're kicking my ass,

57:21.360 --> 57:30.720
 that's probably because like I am working on something like new or maybe I'm letting them win.

57:30.720 --> 57:35.600
 But when there's no belts and it doesn't matter if I've been doing this for 15 years,

57:35.600 --> 57:42.160
 it doesn't matter. None of it matters. What matters is the raw interaction of just trying

57:42.160 --> 57:48.000
 to kick each other's ass and seeing like, what is this chess game, like a human chess?

57:49.280 --> 57:54.720
 Who, what are the ideas that we're playing with? And I think there's a dance there. Yes,

57:54.720 --> 58:00.800
 it's valuable to know a person as a black belt when you take consideration of the advice of

58:00.800 --> 58:04.320
 different people, me versus somebody who's only practiced for like a couple of days.

58:04.320 --> 58:12.240
 But at the same time, the raw practice of ideas that is combat and the raw practice of exchange

58:12.240 --> 58:20.160
 of ideas that is science needs to often throw away expertise. And in communicating, like there's

58:20.160 --> 58:26.480
 another thing to science and expertise, which is leadership. It's not just, so the scientific

58:26.480 --> 58:33.120
 method in the review process is this rigorous battle of ideas between scientists. But there's

58:33.120 --> 58:39.760
 also a stepping up and inspiring the world and communicating ideas to the world. And that skill

58:39.760 --> 58:47.200
 of communication, I suppose that's my biggest criticism of so called experts in science.

58:47.200 --> 58:52.960
 Is there just shitty communicators? Absolutely. Yeah. Well, I can tell you, I get very frustrated

58:52.960 --> 59:00.480
 with philosophers not reaching out more. I mean, I think it might be partly that we're trained to

59:00.480 --> 59:06.880
 get watertight arguments, respond to all objections. And as you do that, eventually it

59:06.880 --> 59:15.840
 gets more complicated and the jargon comes in. So to write a more accessible book or article,

59:15.840 --> 59:20.160
 you have to loosen the arguments a bit. And then we worry that other philosophers will think,

59:20.160 --> 59:24.720
 oh, that's a really crap argument. So I mean, the way I did it, I wrote my academic book first,

59:24.720 --> 59:30.880
 Consciousness and Fundamental Reality, and then a more accessible book, Galileo's Error,

59:30.880 --> 59:35.760
 where the arguments, you know, not as rigorously worked out. So then I can say the proper arguments

59:35.760 --> 59:39.760
 there, you know, the further arguments there. That's brilliantly done, by the way. Like,

59:40.480 --> 59:46.080
 that's such a, so for people who don't know, you first wrote Consciousness and Fundamental

59:46.080 --> 59:51.920
 Reality. So that's the academic book, also very good. I flew through it last night, bought it.

59:51.920 --> 59:57.840
 And then obviously the popular book is Galileo's Error, Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness.

59:57.840 --> 1:00:02.640
 That's kind of the right way to do it. To show that you're legit, your community to the world,

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:07.280
 by doing the book that's normally going to read, and then doing a popular book

1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:13.920
 that everybody's going to read. That's cool. Well, I try now, every time I write an academic article,

1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:19.600
 I try to write a more accessible version. I mean, the thing I've been working on recently,

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:29.440
 just because there's this argument. So there's a certain argument from the cosmological fine

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:34.800
 tuning of the laws of physics for life to the multiverse that's quite popular physicists like

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:45.520
 Max Tegmark. There's an argument in philosophy journals that there's a fallacious line of

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:51.760
 reasoning going on there from the fine tuning to the multiverse. Now that argument is from 20,

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:57.440
 30 years ago, and it's, you know, discussed in academic philosophy. Nobody knows about it. And

1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:02.480
 there is huge interest in this fine tuning stuff. Scientists wanting to argue for the multiverse,

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.000
 theists wanting to say this is evidence for God, and nobody knows about this argument,

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.800
 which tries to show that it's fallacious reasoning to go from the fine tuning to the multiverse. So

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:19.360
 I wrote a piece for Scientific American explaining this argument to a more general audience. And,

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:27.360
 you know, it just really irritates me that it's just buried in these technical journal articles

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:34.400
 and nobody knows about it. But just, you know, final thing on that. I don't disagree with

1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:38.400
 anything you said, and that's kind of really beautiful, that martial arts example and thinking

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:49.280
 how that could be analogous. But I think it's very rare to find a good philosopher who hasn't given

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:55.200
 a talk to other philosophers and had objections raised. I was going to say have it torn apart,

1:01:55.200 --> 1:02:00.800
 but that's maybe thinking of it in the slightly the wrong way, but have the best objections

1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:10.320
 raised to it. And that's why that is an important formative process that you go through as an

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:17.520
 academic, that the greatest minds starting a philosophy degree, for example, won't have gone

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:25.520
 through and probably, except in very rare cases, just won't have that, that the skills required.

1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:33.440
 But part of it is just fun to disagree and dance with. I think to elaborate on what you're saying

1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:39.920
 in agreement, not just gone through that, but continue to go through that. That's, I would say,

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:46.480
 the biggest problem with, quote unquote, expertise is that there's a certain point where you get,

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:51.200
 because it sucks. Like martial arts is a good example of that. It sucks to get your ass kicked.

1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:57.120
 Yeah. Like I, there's a temptation. I still go, like I train, you know,

1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:02.320
 you're getting older too, but also there's killers out there in both the space of martial arts and

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:08.720
 the space of science. And I think that once you become a professor, like more and more senior

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:14.160
 and more and more respected, I don't know if you get your ass kicked in the space of ideas as often.

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:21.440
 I don't know if you allow yourself to truly expose yourself. If you do, that's a great,

1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:28.400
 like sign of a, of a humble, brilliant mind is constantly exposing yourself to that.

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:31.920
 I think you do because I think there's, there's graduate students who want to,

1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:37.680
 you know, find the objection to sort of write their paper or make their mark. And

1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:43.840
 yeah, I, I think everyone still gives talks or should give talk, give talks and people are

1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:51.120
 wanting to work out if there are any weaknesses to your position. So yeah, I think that generally

1:03:51.120 --> 1:04:01.840
 works out. There is also a kind of, who do you give the talks to? So, I mean, within communities,

1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:08.800
 the little cluster of people that argue and bicker, but what are they arguing about? They

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:16.240
 take a bunch of stuff, a bunch of basic assumptions as agreement, and they heatedly argue about

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:21.040
 certain ideas. The question is how open are, that that's actually kind of like fun. That's like,

1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:26.480
 no offense, sorry, we're sticking on this martial arts thing. It's like people who practice Aikido

1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:34.160
 or certain martial arts that don't truly test themselves in the cage, in combat. So it's like,

1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:39.040
 it's fun to argue about like certain things when you're in your own community, but you don't test

1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:49.200
 those ideas in the full context of science, in the full like seriousness, the rigor of the,

1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:54.320
 sometimes like the real world. One of my favorite fields is psychology. There's often,

1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:59.040
 places within psychology where you're kind of doing these studies and arguing about stuff that's done

1:04:59.040 --> 1:05:08.000
 in the lab. The arguments are almost disjoint from real human behavior. Because it's so much easier

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.480
 to study human behavior in the lab, you just kind of stay there and that's where the arguments are.

1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:17.040
 And so vision science is a good example, like studying eye movement and how we perceive the

1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:21.040
 world and all that kind of stuff. It's so much easier to study in the lab that we don't consider

1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:25.360
 we say that's going to be what the science of vision is going to be like, and we don't consider

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:29.360
 the science of vision in the actual real world, the engineering of vision. I don't know. And so

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:36.240
 I think that's where exposing yourself to out of the box ideas, that's the most painful,

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:40.000
 that's the most important. I mean groupthink can be a terrible thing in philosophy as well,

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:47.360
 but because you're not to the same extent beholden to evidence and refutation from the evidence that

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:53.680
 you're in the sciences, it's a more subtle process of evaluation and so more susceptible, I think,

1:05:53.680 --> 1:06:00.720
 to groupthink. Yeah, I agree. It's a danger. We've talked about a million times, but let's try to

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:08.080
 sort of do that old basic terminology definitions. What is panpsychism? Like what are the different

1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:13.360
 ways you can try to think about to define panpsychism? Maybe

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:21.040
 in contrast to naturalistic dualism and materialism, other kind of views of consciousness?

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:30.080
 Yeah, so that you've basically laid out the different options. So I guess probably still

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:36.640
 the dominant view is materialism, that roughly that we can explain consciousness in the terms

1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:42.800
 of physical science, wholly explain it just in terms of the electrochemical signaling in the

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:51.840
 brain. Dualism, the polar opposite view, that consciousness is nonphysical outside of the

1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:58.560
 physical workings of the body and the brain, although closely connected. When I studied

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:02.560
 philosophy, we were taught basically they were the two options you had to choose, right?

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.680
 Either you thought it were dualist and you thought it was separate from the physical, or you thought

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:13.120
 it was just electrochemical signaling. And yeah, I became very disillusioned because I think there

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:17.920
 are big problems with both of these options. So I think the attraction of panpsychism is it's kind

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:23.200
 of a middle way. It agrees with the materialist that there's just a physical world. Ultimately,

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:29.920
 there's just particles and fields. But the panpsychist, the materialist,

1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:37.440
 but the panpsychist thinks there's more to the physical than what physical science reveals,

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:44.000
 and that the ultimate nature of the physical world is constituted of consciousness. So

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:51.120
 consciousness is not outside of the physical as the dualist thinks. It's embedded in, underlies

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:55.360
 the kind of description of the world we get from physics.

1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:59.920
 LW. What are the problems of materialism and dualism?

1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:08.640
 CM. Starting with materialism, it's a huge debate, but I think that the core of it is that

1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:13.600
 physical science works with a purely quantitative description of the physical world,

1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:21.120
 whereas consciousness essentially involves qualities. If you think about the smell of coffee

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:28.080
 or the taste of mint or the deep red you experience as you watch a sunset, I think these

1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:33.760
 qualities can't be captured in the purely quantitative language of physical science.

1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:40.160
 So as long as your description of the brain is framed in the purely quantitative language of

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:45.440
 neuroscience, you'll just leave out these qualities and hence really leave out consciousness itself.

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:47.040
 LW. And then dualism?

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:52.560
 CM. So I've actually changed my mind a little bit on this since I wrote the book. So, I mean,

1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:58.400
 I argued in the book that we have pretty good experimental grounds for doubting dualism,

1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:09.120
 and roughly the idea was if dualism were true, if there was, say, an immaterial mind impacting on

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:14.160
 the brain every second of waking life, that this would really show up in on neuroscience. There'd

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:20.400
 be all sorts of things happening in the brain that had no physical explanation. It would be like a

1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:27.600
 poltergeist was playing with the brain. But actually, and so the fact that we don't find that

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:34.320
 is a strong and ever growing inductive argument against dualism. But actually, the more I talk to

1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:40.080
 neuroscientists and read neuroscience and we have at Durham, my university, an interdisciplinary

1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:45.200
 consciousness group, I don't think we know enough about the brain, about the workings of the brain

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:53.520
 to make that argument. I think we know a lot about the basic chemistry, how neurons fire,

1:09:54.240 --> 1:10:00.160
 neurotransmitters, action potentials, things like that. We know a fair bit about large scale

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:06.400
 functions of the brain, what different bits of the brain do. But what we're almost clueless on

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:12.400
 is how those large scale functions are realized at the cellular level, how it works.

1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:19.760
 People get quite excited about brain scans, but it's very low resolution. Every pixel on a brain

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:30.000
 scan corresponds to 5.5 million neurons. We're only 70% of the way through constructing a connectome

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:36.720
 for the maggot brain, which has 10,000 or 100,000 neurons, but the brain has 86 billion neurons.

1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:44.480
 I think we'd have to know a lot more about how the brain works, how these functions are realized

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:53.680
 before we could assess whether the dynamics of the brain can be completely explicated in terms of

1:10:53.680 --> 1:11:02.000
 underlying chemistry or physics. We'd have to do more engineering before we could figure that out.

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.760
 There are people with other proposals, someone I got to know, Martin Picard at Columbia University,

1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:14.560
 who has the Psychobiology Mitochondrial Lab there and is experimentally exploring the hypothesis

1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:21.120
 that mitochondria in the brain should be under social networks, perhaps as an alternative to

1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:28.960
 reducing it to underlying chemistry and physics. It is ultimately an empirical question whether

1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:33.760
 dualism is true. I'm less convinced that we know the answer to that question at this stage.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:39.200
 I think still as scientists and philosophers, we want to try and find the simplest,

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:47.840
 most parsimonious theory of reality. Dualism is still a pretty inelegant,

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:54.640
 unparsimonious theory. Reality is divided up into the purely physical properties and these

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:59.200
 consciousness properties and they're radically different kinds of things. Whereas the panpsychist

1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:03.040
 offers a much more simple, unified picture of reality. I think it's still the view to be

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:08.240
 preferred. To put it very simply, why believe in two kinds of things when you can just get away

1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:15.040
 with one? And materialism is also very simple, but you're saying it doesn't explain something

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:20.160
 that seems pretty important. Yes. I think materialism kind of, you know, science is

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:24.240
 about trying to find the simplest theory that accounts for the data. I don't think materialism

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:30.800
 can account for the data. Maybe dualism can account for the data, but panpsychism is simpler.

1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:34.720
 It can account for the data and it's simpler. What is panpsychism?

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:41.920
 So in its broadest definition, it's the view that consciousness is a fundamental

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:45.360
 and ubiquitous feature of the physical world.

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:51.680
 Like a law of physics, what should we be imagining? What do you think the different

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.400
 flavors of how that actually takes shape in the context of what we know about physics and science

1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:01.040
 and the universe? So in the simplest form of it, the fundamental building blocks of reality,

1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:07.600
 perhaps electrons and quarks have incredibly simple forms of experience and the very complex

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:14.000
 experience of the human or animal brain is somehow rooted in or derived from these very simple

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:19.680
 forms of experience at the level of basic physics. But I mean, maybe the crucial bit about

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:28.000
 the kind of panpsychism I defend, what it does is it takes the standard approach to the problem

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.680
 of consciousness and turns it on its head, right? So the standard approach is to think

1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:38.400
 we start with matter and we think, how do we get consciousness out of matter? So I don't think that

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.720
 problem can be solved for reasons I've kind of hinted at. We could maybe go into more detail,

1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:49.440
 but the panpsychist does it the other way around. They start with consciousness and try to get

1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:55.120
 matter out of consciousness. So the idea is basically at the fundamental level of reality,

1:13:55.120 --> 1:14:03.840
 at the fundamental level of reality, there are just networks of very simple conscious entities.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.200
 But these conscious entities, because they have very simple kinds of experience,

1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:13.440
 they behave in predictable ways. Through their interactions, they realize certain

1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:18.320
 mathematical structures. And then the idea is those mathematical structures just are

1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:25.200
 the structures identified by physics. So when we think about these simple conscious entities

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:29.840
 in terms of the mathematical structures they realize, we call them particles, we call them

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:38.000
 fields, we call their properties mass, spin and charge. But really there's just these very simple

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.800
 conscious entities and their experiences. So in this way, we get physics out of consciousness.

1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:48.240
 I don't think you can get consciousness out of physics, but I think it's pretty easy to get

1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:56.160
 physics out of consciousness. Well, I'm a little confused by why you need to get physics out of

1:14:56.160 --> 1:15:03.040
 consciousness. I mean, to me, it sounds like panpsychism unites consciousness and physics.

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:11.920
 I mean, physics is the mathematical science of describing everything. So physics should be able

1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:18.800
 to describe consciousness. Panpsychism, in my understanding, proposes is that physics doesn't

1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:25.360
 currently do so, but can in the future. I mean, it seems like consciousness, you have like Stephen

1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:34.000
 Wolfram, who's all these people who are trying to develop theories of everything, mathematical

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.920
 frameworks within which to describe how we get all the reality that we perceive around us. To me,

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:46.240
 to me, there's no reason why that kind of framework cannot also include some accurate,

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:54.640
 precise description of whatever simple consciousness characteristics are present

1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.800
 there at the lowest level, if panpsychist theories have truth to them. So like to me,

1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:05.920
 it is physics. You said kind of physics emerges, by which you mean like the basic four laws of

1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:10.160
 physics that as we currently know them, the standard model, quantum mechanics, general

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:15.840
 relativity that emerges from the base consciousness layer. That's what you mean.

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:20.320
 Yeah. So maybe the way I phrased it made it sound like these things are more separate than they are.

1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:28.240
 What I was trying to address was a common misunderstanding of panpsychism, that it's

1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:36.240
 a sort of dualistic theory. The idea is that particles have their physical properties like

1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:41.360
 mass, spin, and charge, and these other funny consciousness properties. So the physicist Sabine

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:46.560
 Hossenfelder had a blog post critiquing panpsychism maybe a couple of years ago now that got a

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:53.440
 fair bit of traction. And she was interpreting panpsychism in this way. And then her thought was,

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.640
 well look, if particles had these funny consciousness properties, then it would show up in our physics

1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:02.560
 like the standard model of particle physics would make false predictions because its predictions are

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:08.240
 based wholly on the physical properties. If there were also these consciousness properties, we'd get

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:13.280
 different predictions. But that's a misunderstanding of the view. The view is it's not that there are

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:20.160
 two kinds of property that mass, spin, and charge are forms of consciousness. How do we make sense

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:25.600
 of that? Because actually when you look at what physics tells us, it's really just telling us

1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:32.320
 about behavior, about what stuff does. I sometimes put it by saying doing physics is like playing

1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:35.680
 chess when you don't care what the pieces are made of. You're just interested in what moves you can

1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:43.840
 make. So physics tells us what mass, spin, and charge do, but it doesn't tell us what they are.

1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:51.520
 The experience of mass. So the idea is, yeah, mass in its nature is a very simple form of

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:56.880
 consciousness. So yeah, physics in a sense is complete, I think, because it tells us what

1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:03.760
 everything at the fundamental level does. It describes its causal capacities. But for the

1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:10.000
 panpsychist at least, physics doesn't tell us what matter is. It tells us what it does, but not what

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:16.800
 it is. To push back on the thing I think she's criticizing, is it also possible, so I understand

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:22.400
 what you're saying, but is it also possible that particles have another property like consciousness?

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:28.640
 I don't understand the criticism we would be able to detect it in our experiments. Well, no, if you're

1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:36.080
 not looking for it. I mean there's a lot of stuff that are orthogonal. Like if you're not looking

1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:41.600
 for this stuff, you're not going to detect it. Because like all of our basic empirical science

1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:47.680
 through its recent history, and yes the history of science is quite recent, has been very kind of

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:56.720
 focused on billiard balls colliding and from that understanding how gravity works. But like we just

1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:02.640
 haven't integrated other possibilities into this. I don't think there will be conflicting whether you

1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:08.960
 are observing consciousness or not, or exploring some of these ideas. I don't think that affects

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:16.320
 the rest of the physics. The mass, the energy, the all the different kind of like the hierarchy of

1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:22.880
 different particles and so on, how they interact. I don't think, it feels like consciousness is

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:29.040
 something orthogonal, like very much distinct. It's the quantitative versus the qualitative.

1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:34.000
 There's something quite distinct that we're just almost like another dimension that we're just

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.880
 completely ignoring. There might be a way of responding to Sabina to say, well, that there

1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:45.440
 could be properties of particles that don't show up in the specific circumstances in which physicists

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:50.480
 investigate particles. My colleague, the philosopher of science, Nancy Cartwright, has got this book,

1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:57.680
 How the Laws of Physics Lie, where she says, physicists explore things in very specific

1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:03.200
 circumstances and then in an unwarranted way generalize that. But I mean, I guess I was

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:08.560
 thinking Sabina's criticism actually just misses the mark in a more basic way. Her point is,

1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:12.880
 we shouldn't think there are any more properties to particles other than those the standard model

1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:18.240
 attributes to them. Panpsychus would say, yeah, sure, there aren't. There are just the properties,

1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:22.640
 the physical properties like mass, spin and charge that the standard model attributes to them. It's

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:28.480
 just that we have a different philosophical view as to the nature of those properties.

1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:32.560
 Those properties are turtles that are sitting on top of another turtle and that big turtle is

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:39.200
 consciousness. That's what you're saying. But I'm just saying, it's possible that's true. It's

1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:44.640
 possible also that consciousness is just another turtle playing with the others. It's just not

1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:49.920
 interacting in the ways that we've been observing. In fact, to me, that's more compelling because

1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:57.040
 then that's going to be, well, no, I think both are very compelling, but it feels like

1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:03.360
 it's more within the reach of empirical validation if it's yet another property of particles that

1:21:03.360 --> 1:21:11.280
 we're just not observing. If it's like the thing from which matter and energy and physics emerges,

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:22.080
 it makes it that much more difficult to investigate how you get from that base

1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:30.240
 layer of consciousness to the wonderful little spark of consciousness, complexity and beauty

1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:35.040
 that is the human being. I don't know if you're necessarily trying to get there,

1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:42.720
 but one of the beautiful things to get at with panpsychism or with a solid theory of consciousness

1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:51.120
 is to answer the question, how do you engineer the thing? How do you get from nothing vacuum

1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:57.600
 in the lab? If there is that consciousness base layer, how do you start engineering organisms that

1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:04.560
 have consciousness in them? Or the reverse of that describing how does consciousness emerge

1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:12.240
 in the human being from conception, from a stem cell to the whole full neurobiology that builds

1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:19.680
 from that, how do you get this full rich experience of consciousness that humans have? It feels like

1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:27.200
 that's the dream and if consciousness is just another player in the game of physics, it feels

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:33.520
 more amenable to our scientific understanding of it. That's interesting. I mean, I guess it's supposed

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:41.360
 to be a kind of identity claim here that physics tells us what matter does, consciousness is what

1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:48.800
 matter is. So matter is sort of what consciousness does. So at the bottom level, there is just

1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:54.720
 consciousness and conscious things. There are just these simple things with their experiences

1:22:54.720 --> 1:23:01.680
 and that is their total nature. So in that sense, it's not another player, it's just all there is

1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:10.240
 really. In physics, we describe that at a certain level of abstraction. We capture what Bertrand

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:16.080
 Russell, who was the inspiration for a lot of this, calls the causal skeleton of the world.

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:19.440
 So physics is just interested in the causal skeleton of the world, it's not interested in

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:25.040
 flesh and blood, although that's maybe suggesting separation again too much,

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:34.480
 or metaphors fail in the end. So yeah, you totally right. Ultimately, what we want to explain is how

1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:40.080
 our consciousness and the consciousness of other animals comes out of this. If we can't do that,

1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:48.800
 then it's game over. But I think it maybe makes more sense on the identity claim that if matter

1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:53.440
 at the fundamental level just is forms of consciousness, then we can perhaps make sense

1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:58.080
 of how those simple forms of consciousness in some way combine in some way to make

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.680
 the consciousness we know and love. That's the dream. Yeah, so I guess the question is,

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:12.160
 so the reason you can describe, like the reason you have material engineering, material science,

1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:21.920
 is because you have from physics to chemistry, like you keep going up and up in levels of

1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:30.480
 complexity in order to describe objects that we have in our human world. And it would be nice to

1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:35.680
 do the same thing for consciousness, to come up with the chemistry of consciousness, right? Like

1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:43.920
 how do the different particles interact to create greater complexity? So you can do this kind of

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:50.240
 thing for life, like what is life, like living organisms, at which point do living organisms

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:57.120
 become living? What, like what, how do you know if I give you a thing that that thing is living?

1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:03.200
 And there's a lot of people working on this kind of idea and some of that has to do with the levels

1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:09.600
 of complexity and so on. It'd be nice to know like measuring different degrees of consciousness as

1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:15.280
 you get into a bigger, more and more complex objects. And that's, I mean that's what chemistry,

1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:21.520
 biochemistry, like bigger and bigger conscious molecules, and to see how that leads to organisms.

1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:26.080
 And then organisms like start to collaborate together like they do inside a human body

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.600
 to create the full human body. To do those kinds of experiments would be,

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:35.920
 it seems like that would be kind of a goal. That's what I mean by player in a game of physics,

1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:42.240
 as opposed to like the base layer. If it's just the base layer, it becomes harder to track it

1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:45.840
 as you get from physics to chemistry to biology to psychology.

1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:54.800
 Yeah. In every case, apart from consciousness, I would say what we're interested in is behavior.

1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:00.480
 We're interested in explaining behavioral functions. So at the level of fundamental physics,

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:05.200
 we're interested in capturing the equations that describe the behavior there. And when we get to

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.520
 higher levels, we're interested in explicating the behavior, perhaps in terms of behavior at

1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:17.920
 simpler levels. And with life as well, that's what we're interested in, the various observable

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:24.240
 functions of life, explaining them in terms of more simple mechanisms. But in the case of

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:30.800
 consciousness, I don't think that's what we're doing, or at least not all that we're doing.

1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:37.600
 In the case of consciousness, there are these subjective qualities that we're immediately

1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:43.920
 aware of that the redness of a red experience, the itchiness of an itch, and we're trying to

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:49.680
 account for them. We're trying to bring them into our theory of reality and postulating some

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:54.240
 mechanism does not deal with that. So I think we've got to realize dealing with consciousness

1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:59.360
 is a radically different explanatory task from other tasks of science. Other tasks of science,

1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:03.920
 we're trying to explain behavior in terms of simpler forms of behavior. In the case of

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:09.760
 consciousness, we're trying to explain these invisible subjective qualities that you can't

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:15.040
 see from the outside, but that you're immediately aware of. The reason materialism perhaps continues

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:20.000
 to dominate is people think, look at the success of science, it's incredible, look at all the,

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.000
 you know, it's explained all this, surely it's going to explain consciousness. But I think we

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:31.680
 have to appreciate there's a radically different explanatory task here. And so that, I mean,

1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:36.640
 the neuroscientist Anil Seth, who I've had lots of intense but friendly discussions with, you know,

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:42.240
 wants to compare consciousness to life. But I think there's this radical difference that

1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:47.440
 in the case of life, again, we come back to public observation, all of the data,

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:54.320
 publicly observable data, we're basically trying to explain complex behavior. And the way you do

1:27:54.320 --> 1:28:01.840
 that is identify mechanisms, simpler mechanisms that explicate that behavior. That's the task in

1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:07.360
 physics, chemistry, neurobiology. But in the case of consciousness, that's not what we're

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:12.240
 trying to do. We're trying to account for these subjective qualities and you postulate a mechanism

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:18.640
 that might explain behavior, but it doesn't explain the redness of a red experience.

1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:25.760
 So, but still, I mean, still, ultimately, the hope is that we will have some kind of hierarchical

1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:31.840
 story. So we take the causal dynamics of physics, we hypothesize that that's filled out with

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:40.880
 certain forms of consciousness. And then at higher levels, we get more complex causal dynamics

1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:48.400
 filled out by more complex forms of consciousness. And ultimately, we get to us, hopefully. So yeah,

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:51.440
 so there's still a sort of hierarchical explanatory framework there.

1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:58.560
 So you kind of mentioned the hierarchy of consciousness. Do you think it's possible to,

1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:06.160
 within the panpsychism framework, to measure consciousness? Or put another way,

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:12.560
 are some things more conscious than others, in the panpsychist view?

1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:22.240
 It's a difficult question. I mean, I do see consciousness as a dealing with consciousness,

1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:29.040
 an interdisciplinary task between something more experimental, which is to do with the ongoing

1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:35.120
 project of trying to work out what people call the neural correlates of consciousness,

1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:40.720
 of consciousness, what kinds of physical brain activity correspond to conscious experience.

1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:46.800
 That's one part of it. But I think essentially, there's also a theoretical question of

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:56.000
 more the why question. Why do those kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds of

1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:00.320
 conscious experience? I don't think you can answer that. Because consciousness is not publicly

1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:07.440
 observable. I don't think you can answer that why question with an experiment. But they have to go

1:30:07.440 --> 1:30:13.360
 hand in hand. And I mean, one of the theories I'm attracted to is the integrated information theory,

1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:20.480
 according to which we find consciousness at the level at which there is most integrated

1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:25.680
 information. And they try to give a mathematically precise definition of that. So on that view,

1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:30.720
 you know, probably this cup of tea isn't conscious, because there's probably more

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:36.400
 integrated information in the molecules making up the tea than there is in the liquid as a whole.

1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:42.560
 But in the brain, what is distinctive about the brain is that there's a huge amount of integrated,

1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:47.920
 there's more integrated information in the system than there is in individual neurons. So that's why

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:57.040
 they claim that that's the basis of consciousness at the macro level. I mean, I like some features

1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:03.680
 of this theory, but they do talk about degrees of consciousness. They do want to say there is

1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:11.920
 gradations. I'm not sure conceptually I can kind of make sense of that. I mean, there are things

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:21.360
 to do with consciousness that are graded, like complexity or levels of information. But I'm not

1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:28.400
 sure whether experience itself admits a degree. I sort of think something either has experience or

1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:32.560
 it doesn't. It might have very simple experience, it might have very complex experience, but

1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:38.960
 experience itself, I don't think it admits a degree in that sense. It's not more experience,

1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:45.040
 less experience. I sort of find that conceptually hard to make sense of. But I'm kind of open minded

1:31:45.040 --> 1:31:55.440
 on it. So when we have a lot higher resolution of sensory information, don't you think that's

1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:03.920
 correlated to the richness of the experience? So doesn't more information provide a richer

1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:08.720
 experience? Or is that, again, thinking quantitatively and not thinking about the

1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:14.720
 subjective experience? Like you can experience a lot with very little sensory information, perhaps.

1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:20.480
 Do you think those are connected? Yeah, yeah. So there are

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:29.520
 features, characteristics here we can grade, the complexity of the experience. And on the

1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:39.040
 integrated information theory, they correlate that in terms of mathematically identifiable structure

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:44.240
 with integrated information. So roughly, it's a quite unusual notion of information. It's perhaps

1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:52.400
 not the standard way one thinks about information. It's to do with constraining past and future

1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:58.240
 possibilities of the system. So the idea is in the retina of the eye, there's a huge amount of

1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:04.400
 possible states the retina of my eye could be in at the next moment, depending on what light goes

1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:12.000
 into it. Whereas the possible next states of the brain are much more likely to be in the retina of

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:16.560
 the eye. The possible next states of the brain are much more constrained. Obviously, it responds to

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:25.440
 the environment, but it heavily constrains its past and future states. And so that's the idea

1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:33.200
 of information they have. And then the second idea is how much that information is dependent on

1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:40.960
 integration. So in a computer where you have transistors, you take out a few transistors,

1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:45.920
 lose that much information. It's not dependent on interconnections. Whereas you take a tiny bit of

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:51.120
 the brain out, you lose a lot of information because the way it stores information is dependent

1:33:51.120 --> 1:34:01.680
 on the interconnections of the system. So that's one proposal for how to measure one gradable

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.800
 characteristic, which might correspond to some gradable characteristic in qualitative

1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:11.680
 consciousness. And maybe I'm being very pedantic, which is, you know, philosophers, professional

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:19.360
 pedants. I just sort of don't think that is a quantity of experience. It's a quantity of

1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:26.000
 the structure of experience, maybe, but I just find it hard to make sense of the idea of how

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:32.080
 much experience do you have? I've got, you know, five units of experience. I've got one unit of

1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:38.960
 experience. I don't know. I find that a bit hard to make sense. Maybe I'm being just pedantic.

1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:46.160
 I think just saying the word experience is difficult to think about. Let's talk about

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:52.880
 suffering. Let's talk about a particular experience. So let's talk about me and the hamster.

1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:59.760
 I just think that no offense to the hamster. Probably no hamsters are listening.

1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:04.560
 So now you're offending hamsters too. Maybe there's a hamster that's just pissed off.

1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:13.440
 There's probably somebody on a speaker right now listening to this podcast and they probably have

1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:18.720
 a hamster or a guinea pig and that hamster is listening. It just doesn't know the English

1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:27.040
 language or any kind of human interpretable linguistic capabilities to tell you to fuck off.

1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:35.360
 It understands exactly what's being talked about and can see through us. Anyway, it just feels like

1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:48.480
 a hamster has less capacity to suffer than me. And maybe a cockroach or an insect or maybe a bacteria

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:59.360
 has less capacity to suffer than me. But maybe that's me deluding myself as to the complexity

1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:07.600
 of my conscious experience. Maybe there is some sense in which I can suffer more,

1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:14.080
 but to reduce it to something quantifiable is impossible.

1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:18.400
 Angus Yeah, I guess I definitely think there's kinds of suffering that

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:26.480
 you have the joy of being possible for you that aren't available to a hamster, I don't think.

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:34.640
 Well, can a hamster suffer heartbreak? I don't know. Can a cockroach suffer heartbreak? But

1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:42.160
 it's certainly, I mean, there's kinds of fear of your own death, concern about whether there's a

1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:50.720
 purpose to existence. These are forms of suffering that aren't available to most nonhuman animals.

1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:58.240
 Whether there's an overall scale that we could put physical and emotional suffering on

1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:04.400
 and identify where you are on that scale, I'm not so sure.

1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:12.480
 Angus So it's like humans have a much bigger menu of experiences, much bigger selection.

1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:14.160
 Angus In one sense at least.

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:19.280
 Angus So there's like a page that's suffering. So this menu of experiences,

1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:23.520
 you know, like you have the omelets and the breakfast and so on. And one of the pages is

1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:31.200
 suffering. It's just we have a lot compared to a hamster, a lot more. But any one individual thing

1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:38.480
 that we share with a hamster, that experience, it's difficult to argue that we experience it

1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:40.720
 deeper than others like hunger or something like that.

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:45.200
 Angus Yeah, physical pain, I'm not sure. But I mean,

1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.000
 there are kinds of experiences animals have that we don't. Bats echolocate around the world.

1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:57.200
 Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously pointed out that, you know, no matter how much you understand

1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:04.480
 of the neurophysiology of bats, you'll still not know what it's like to squeal and find your way

1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:12.880
 around by listening to the echoes bounce off. So yeah, I mean, I guess I feel the intuition that

1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:20.560
 there's emotional suffering is I want to say deeper than physical suffering. I don't know how

1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:22.880
 to make that statement precise, though. Angus

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:28.560
 So one of the ways I think about I think people think about consciousness is in connection to

1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:33.760
 suffering. So let me just ask about suffering because that's how people think about animals,

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:42.240
 cruelty to animals or cruelty to living things. They connect that to suffering into consciousness.

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:50.640
 I think there's a sense in which those are two are deeply connected when people are thinking about

1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:58.880
 just public policy. They're thinking about this is like philosophy, engineering, psychology,

1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:05.440
 sociology, political science. All of those things have to do with human suffering and

1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:10.720
 animal suffering, life suffering. And that's connected to consciousness in a lot of people's

1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:17.840
 minds. Is it connected like that for you? So the the capacity to suffer, is it also

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:23.600
 is it also somehow like strongly correlated with the capacity to experience?

1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:26.080
 Angus Yeah, I would say I would say

1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:35.600
 suffering is a kind of experience. And so you have to be conscious to suffer. Actually, this

1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:43.280
 so there is one people taking more unusual views of consciousness seriously now. Panpsychism is

1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:50.240
 is one radical approach. Another one is what's become known as illusionism, the view that

1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:54.560
 consciousness, at least in the sense that philosophers think about it, doesn't really

1:39:54.560 --> 1:40:03.280
 exist at all. So yeah, my podcast mind chat I host with a committed illusionist. So the

1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:10.640
 gimmick is I think consciousness is everywhere. He thinks it's nowhere. And so that's one very

1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.840
 simple way of avoiding all these problems, right? Consciousness doesn't exist, we don't need to

1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:21.840
 explain it. Job done. Although we might still have to explain why we seem to be conscious,

1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.080
 why it's so hard to get out of the idea that we're conscious. But that the reason I connect

1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:32.080
 this to what you're saying is, actually, my co host, Keith Frankish, is a little bit ambivalent

1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.240
 on the word pain. He says, Oh, in some, you know, in some sense, I believe in pain. And in some

1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:44.480
 sense, I don't. But another illusionist, Francois Camara, has a paper discussing how we think about

1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:49.920
 morality, given his view that pain in the way we normally think about it just does not exist.

1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:54.960
 He thinks it's an illusion, the brain tricks us into thinking we feel pain, but we don't. And

1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:01.680
 how we should think about morality in the light of that. It's become a big topic, actually,

1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:06.880
 thinking about the connection between consciousness and morality. David Chalmers, the philosopher,

1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:14.080
 is most associated with this concept of a philosophical zombie. So a philosophical zombie

1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:19.040
 is very different from a Hollywood zombie. Hollywood zombies, you know, you know what

1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:25.040
 they're like, but philosophical zombies are sort of really good. A Korean zombie movie on Halloween

1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:31.440
 this year. Anyway, philosophical zombies behave just like us because the physical

1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:36.320
 workings of their body and brain are the same as ours, but they have no conscious experience.

1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:41.440
 There's nothing that it's like to be a zombie. So you stick a knife in it, it screams and runs away,

1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:50.400
 but it doesn't actually feel pain. It's just a complicated mechanism set up to behave just like

1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:54.240
 us. Now there's lots of, no one believes in these. I think there's one philosopher who believes in

1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:58.720
 everyone is a zombie except him. But anyway. But isn't that what illusionism is?

1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:06.000
 Yeah, I suppose so in a sense. Illusionism is if you were all zombies. And, you know, one reason to

1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.320
 think about zombies is to think about the value of consciousness. So if there were a zombie,

1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:16.720
 here's a question. Suppose we could, I mean, suppose we could make zombies by, let's say,

1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:20.960
 for the sake of discussion, things made of silicon aren't conscious. I don't know if that's true. It

1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:27.440
 could turn out to be true. And suppose you built Commander Data out of silicon, you know, it's a

1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:32.320
 bit of an old school reference to Star Trek New Next Generation. So, you know, behaves just like

1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:38.800
 a human being, but, you know, it can, you can have a sophisticated conversation. It will talk about

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:49.280
 its hopes and fears, but it has no consciousness. Does it have moral rights? Is it murder to turn

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:54.720
 off such a being? You know, I'm inclined to say, no, it's not. You know, if it doesn't have

1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:59.760
 experience, it doesn't really suffer. It doesn't really have moral rights at all. So I'm inclined

1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:08.880
 to think, you know, consciousness is the basis of moral value, moral concern. And conversely,

1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:15.840
 as a panpsychist, for this reason, I think it can transform your relationship with nature.

1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:21.600
 If you think of a tree as a conscious organism, albeit of a very unusual kind,

1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:29.200
 then a tree is a locus of moral concern in its own right. Chopping down a tree is an act of

1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:36.160
 immediate moral concern. If you see these, you know, horrible forest fires, we're all horrified.

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:42.480
 But if you think it's the burning of conscious organisms, that does add a whole new dimension.

1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:47.040
 Although it also makes things more complicated because people often think as a panpsychist,

1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:53.760
 I'm going to be vegan. But it's tricky because if you think plants and trees are conscious as well,

1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:57.840
 you've got to eat something. If you don't think plants and trees are conscious, then you've got

1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:01.840
 a nice moral dividing line. You can say, I'm not going to eat things that aren't conscious. I'm

1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:06.880
 not going to kill things that aren't conscious. But if you think plants and trees are conscious,

1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:12.560
 then you don't have that nice moral dividing line. I mean, so the principle I'm kind of

1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:19.280
 working my way towards, I haven't kept it up in my trip to the US, but it's just not eating any

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.600
 animal products that are factory farmed. You know, my vegan friends say, well, they're still

1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:33.200
 suffering there. And I think there is even in the nicest farms, cows will suffer when their calves

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:37.440
 are taken off them. They go for a few days of quite serious mourning. So they're still suffering. But

1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:44.560
 it seems to me, my thought is the principle of just not having factory farm stuff is something

1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:49.680
 more people could get on board with. And you might have greater harm minimization. So if people went

1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:56.000
 into restaurants and said, are your animal products factory farmed? If not, I want the vegan

1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:00.480
 option. Or if people looked out for the label that said no factory farmed ingredients. You know,

1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:05.680
 I think maybe that that could make a really big difference to the market and harm minimization.

1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:10.880
 Anyway, so that's the, so it's very ethically tricky. But some people don't buy that. There's

1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:15.200
 a very good philosopher, Jeff Lee, who thinks zombies should have equal rights, consciousness,

1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:23.520
 doesn't matter, you know. Let us go there. But first, I listened to your podcast. It's awesome

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:31.520
 to have two very kind of different philosophies inter dancing together in one place. What's the

1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:36.000
 name of the podcast again? Mind chat. Yeah. So yeah, that's the idea. I guess, you know,

1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:42.560
 polarized times. I mean, I love trying to get in the mindset of people I really disagree with. And

1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:48.160
 you know, I can't understand how on earth they're thinking that, you know, really trying to have

1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:52.240
 respect and try and, you know, see where they're coming from. I love that. So that's what yeah,

1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:59.360
 Keith Frankish and I do of from polar opposite views, really trying to understand each other.

1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:02.400
 And you know, interviewing scientists and philosophers of consciousness from those

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:09.520
 different perspectives. Although in a sense, in a sense, we have a very common, a common starting

1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:18.480
 point, because we both think you can't fully account for consciousness, at least as philosophers

1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:23.920
 normally think of it in conventional scientific terms. So we said that starting point. But we

1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:27.200
 react to it in very different ways. He says, well, it doesn't exist then. It's like,

1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:32.080
 fairy dust. It's, you know, which is, you know, we don't believe in anymore. Whereas I say,

1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:39.120
 it does exist. So we have to rethink what science is. So you recently talked to on the podcast with

1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:47.120
 Sean Carroll, and I first heard you, your great interview with Sean Carroll on his podcast,

1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:57.760
 Mindscape. What is interesting to kind of see if there's agreements, disagreements between the two

1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:04.480
 of you, because he's a, you know, a very serious quantum mechanics guy. He's a physics guy, but he

1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:10.320
 also thinks about deep philosophical questions. He's a big proponents of many worlds interpretation

1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:18.880
 of quantum mechanics. So actually, I'm trying to think, aside from your conversation with him,

1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:23.200
 I'm trying to, I'm trying to remember what he thinks about consciousness. But anyway,

1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:27.520
 maybe you can comment on what, what are some interesting agreements and disagreements with

1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:34.320
 Sean Carroll? I don't think there's many agreements, but, but, you know, we've had

1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:41.120
 really constructive, interesting discussions in, in, in a lot of different contexts. And, you know,

1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:46.320
 he's very clued up about philosophies, very respectful of philosophy, certain physicists

1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:51.280
 who shall remain nameless think, what's all this bullshit philosophy? We don't have to waste our

1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:57.120
 time with that. And then go on to do pretty bad philosophy. The book co written by Stephen Hawking

1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:01.840
 and Leonard Mlodinow famously starts off saying, philosophy is just as important as philosophy.

1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:07.520
 Mlodinow famously starts off saying, philosophy is dead. And then goes on in later chapters to do

1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:13.600
 some pretty bad philosophy. So, uh, I think we have to do philosophy, if only to get rid of bad

1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:20.640
 philosophy, you know, you can't, you can't escape, but, um, strong words. Sean Carroll and I also

1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.760
 had a debate on, on clubhouse, a panpsychism debate together with

1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:33.760
 Annika Harris and Owen Flanagan. It was a two people on each team. And, uh, it was the most

1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:43.200
 popular thing on clubhouse at that time. Um, so yeah, so he's, he's a, he's a materialist

1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:49.600
 of a pretty standard kind that, um, consciousness is be understood as a sort of emergent feature.

1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:55.120
 It's not, not adding anything, a weekly emergent feature. But what I guess what we've been debating

1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:02.960
 most about is, is whether my view can account for mental causation for the fact that consciousness

1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:11.840
 is doing stuff. So he thinks the fact that I think zombies are logically coherent, it's logic,

1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:18.400
 there's a, it's logically coherent for there to be a world physically, just like ours in which

1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:22.880
 there's no consciousness. He thinks that shows, oh, well, my view, consciousness doesn't do

1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:28.880
 anything. It doesn't add anything, which is crazy. You know, my, my, my consciousness impacts on the

1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:35.120
 world. My conscious thoughts are causing me to say the words I'm saying now. My visual experience

1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:42.640
 helps me navigate the world. But I mean, my response to Sean Carroll is, is on the panpsychist

1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:50.800
 view, the relationship between physics and fundamental consciousness is a sort of like the

1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:59.360
 relationship between hot software and hardware, right? Physics is sort of the software and

1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:06.800
 consciousness is the hardware. So consciousness at the fundamental level is the hardware on which

1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:13.600
 the software of physics runs. And just because, you know, just because a certain bit of software

1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:17.840
 could run on two different kinds of hardware, it doesn't mean the hardware isn't doing anything.

1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:22.560
 The fact that Microsoft Word can run on your desktop and run on your laptop doesn't mean your

1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:28.000
 desktop isn't doing anything. Similarly, just because there could be another universe in which

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:33.840
 the physics is realized in non conscious stuff, it doesn't mean the consciousness in our universe

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:37.680
 isn't doing stuff. You know, for the panpsychist, all there is is consciousness. So

1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:40.960
 if something's doing something, it is.

1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:49.040
 RG In your view, it's not emergent. And more than that, it's doing quite a lot.

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:51.680
 CB It's doing everything. It's the only thing that exists.

1:50:51.680 --> 1:51:00.640
 RG But it's, so, you know, the ground is, is important because we walk on it. It's like

1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:08.400
 holding stuff up, but it's not really doing that much. But it feels like consciousness is doing

1:51:08.400 --> 1:51:14.640
 quite a lot, is doing quite a lot of work. And sort of interacting with the environment.

1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:18.880
 It feels like consciousness is not just a,

1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:29.360
 like, if you remove consciousness, it's not just that you remove the experience of things. It

1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:35.120
 feels like you're also going to remove a lot of the progress of human civilization, society and

1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:42.960
 all that. It just feels like consciousness has a lot of value in how we develop our society. So

1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:50.400
 from everything you said with suffering, with morality, with motivation, with love and fear

1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:56.880
 and all of those kinds of things, it seems like it's consciousness in all different flavors and

1:51:56.880 --> 1:52:05.520
 ways is part of all of that. And so without it, you may not have human civilization at all. So

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:13.280
 it's doing a lot of work causality wise and in every kind of way. Of course, when you go to the

1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:21.600
 physics level, it starts to say, okay, how much, maybe the work consciousness is doing is higher

1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:28.560
 at some levels of reality than at others. Maybe a lot of the work it's doing is most apparent at

1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:34.720
 the human level. When you have, at the complex organism level, maybe it's quite boring. Like

1:52:34.720 --> 1:52:43.920
 maybe the stuff of, like physics is more important at the formation of stars and all that kind of

1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:50.480
 stuff. Consciousness only starts being important when you have greater complexities of organism.

1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:58.880
 Yeah. My consciousness is complicated and fairly complicated. And as a result, it does complicated

1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:04.080
 things. The consciousness of a particle is very simple and hence it behaves in predictable ways.

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:13.600
 But the idea is the particle, its entire nature is constituted of its forms of consciousness and it

1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:19.280
 does what it does because of those experiences. It's just that when we do physics, we're not

1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:24.880
 interested in what stuff is. We're just interested in what it does. So physics abstracts away from

1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:33.040
 the stuff of the world and just describes it in terms of its mathematical causal structure.

1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:39.760
 But it's still on the panzeiger's view, it's consciousness that's doing stuff.

1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:51.120
 Yeah. I gotta ask you, because you kind of said, you know, there is some value in consciousness

1:53:51.120 --> 1:54:02.320
 helping us understand morality and a philosophical zombie is somebody that, you know, you're more okay.

1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:11.840
 How do I phrase it? That's not like accusing of stuff, but in your view, it's more okay to murder

1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:18.480
 a philosophical zombie than it is a human being. Yeah. I wouldn't even call it murder maybe.

1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:24.320
 Right. Exactly. Turn off the power to the first off zombie, the source of energy.

1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:33.440
 Yeah. So here comes then the question. We kind of talked about this offline a little bit. So I

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:39.120
 think that there is something special about consciousness and, you know, I'm very open

1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:44.640
 minded about where the special comes from, whether it's the fundamental base of all reality,

1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:51.600
 like you're describing, or whether there's some importance to the special pockets of

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:57.280
 consciousness that's in humans or living organisms. I find all those ideas beautiful and exciting.

1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:08.880
 And I also know or think that robots don't have consciousness in the same way we've been

1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:17.440
 describing. Sort of, I'm kind of a dumb human, but I'm just using like common sense. Like here's some

1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:22.800
 metal and some electricity traveling in certain kinds of ways. It's not conscious

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:32.640
 in ways I understand humans to be conscious. At the same time, I'm also somebody who knows how to

1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:37.360
 bring a robot to life, meaning I can make a move, I can make them recognize the world, I can make

1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:44.160
 them interact with humans. And when I make them interact in certain kinds of ways, I as a human

1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:54.960
 observe them and feel something for them. Moreover, I form a kind of connection with, I'm able to form

1:55:54.960 --> 1:56:01.600
 a kind of connection with robots that make me feel like they're conscious. Now I know intellectually

1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:06.400
 they're not conscious, but I feel like they're conscious. And it starts to get into this area

1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:15.760
 where I'm not so okay, so let me use the M word of murder. I become less and less okay murdering

1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:27.680
 that robot that I know, I quote, know is quote, not conscious. So like can you maybe as a therapy

1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:35.840
 session help me figure out what we do here? And perhaps a way to ask that in another way, do you

1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:44.240
 think there'll be a time in like 20, 30, 50 years when we're not morally okay turning off the power

1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:51.360
 to a robot? Yeah, it's a good question. So it's a really good important question. So I said,

1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:59.280
 I'd be okay with turning off a philosophical zombie, but there's a difficult epistemological

1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:03.760
 question there that meaning, you know, to do with knowledge, how would we know if it was a

1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:10.640
 philosophical zombie? I think probably if there were a silicon creature that could behave just

1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:16.480
 like us and, you know, talk about its views about the pandemic and the global economy and

1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:24.960
 probably we would think it's conscious. Because consciousness is not publicly observable,

1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:29.600
 it is a very difficult question how we decide which things are and are not conscious. And

1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:34.560
 so in the case of human beings, we can't observe their consciousness, but we can ask them. And then

1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:41.040
 we try to, you know, if we scan their brain while we do that, and we'll stimulate the brain, then we

1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:46.560
 can start to correlate in the human case, which kind of brain activity are associated with conscious

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:55.200
 experience. But the more we depart from the human case, the trickier that becomes as a famous paper

1:57:55.200 --> 1:58:00.640
 by the philosopher Ned Block called The Even Harder Problem of Consciousness, where he says,

1:58:00.640 --> 1:58:08.160
 you know, could we ever answer the question of, so suppose you have a silicon duplicate, right?

1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:12.560
 And let's say we're thinking about the silicon duplicates pain.

1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:24.400
 How would we ever know whether what's the ground of the pain is the hardware or the software,

1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:29.920
 really? So in our case, how would we ever know empirically whether it's the specific

1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:36.720
 neurophysiological state, C fibers firing or whatever that's relevant for pain, or if it's

1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:42.720
 something more functional, more to do with the causal role in behavioral functioning,

1:58:42.720 --> 1:58:50.080
 that's the software that's realized. And that's important because this silicon duplicate

1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:56.080
 has the second thing, it has the software, it has the thing that plays the relevant causal role that

1:58:56.080 --> 1:59:00.720
 pain does in us, but it doesn't have the hardware, it doesn't have the same neurophysiological state.

1:59:01.280 --> 1:59:05.920
 And he argues, you know, it's just really difficult to see how we'd ever answer that

1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:10.480
 question because in a human, you're never to begin to have both things. So how do we work out

1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:16.160
 which is which? And I mean, so even forgetting the hard problem of consciousness, even the scientific

1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:22.400
 question of trying to find the neural correlates of consciousness is really hard. And there's

1:59:22.400 --> 1:59:27.920
 absolutely no consensus. And, you know, so that some people think it's in the front of the brain,

1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:33.760
 some people think it's in the back of the brain. It's just a total mess. So I suspect the robots

1:59:33.760 --> 1:59:42.240
 you currently have are not conscious. I guess on any of the reasonably viable models, even though

1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:48.400
 there's great disagreement, all of them probably would hold that your robots are not conscious.

1:59:48.400 --> 1:59:53.920
 But, you know, if we could have very sophisticated robots, I mean, if we go, for example, for the

1:59:53.920 --> 2:00:02.720
 integrated information theory, again, there could be a robot set up to behave just like us and has

2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:08.240
 the kind of information a human brain has, but the information is not stored in a way that's

2:00:08.240 --> 2:00:13.040
 involved, is dependent on the integration and interconnectedness, then according to the integrated

2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:16.400
 information theory, that thing wouldn't be conscious, even though it behaved just like us.

2:00:16.400 --> 2:00:23.280
 If an organism says, forget IIT and these theories of consciousness, if an organism says,

2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:30.720
 please don't kill me. Please don't turn me off. There's a Rick and Morty episode, I've been

2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:42.000
 getting into that recently. There's an episode where there's these mind parasites that

2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:51.680
 are able to infiltrate your memory and inject themselves into your memory. So you have all

2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:57.120
 these people show up in your life and they've injected themselves into your memory that you

2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:02.400
 have been part, they have been part of your life. So there's like these weird creatures and they're

2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:07.600
 like, remember, we've been at that barbecue, we met at that barbecue, or we've been dating for

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:18.880
 the last 20 years. And so part of me is concerned that these philosophical zombies in behavioral,

2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:23.600
 psychological, sociological ways will be able to implant themselves into these,

2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:30.720
 our society and convince us in the same way this is mind parasites that like, please don't hurt me.

2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:38.160
 And like, we've known each other for all this time. They can start manipulating you the same way like

2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:44.720
 Facebook algorithms manipulate you. At first they'll start as a gradual thing that you want

2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:48.720
 to make a more pleasant experience, all those kinds of things. And it'll drift into that direction.

2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.040
 That's something I think about deeply because I want to create these kinds of systems,

2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.120
 but in a way that doesn't manipulate people. I want it to be a thing that brings out the best

2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:03.120
 in people without manipulation. So it's always human centric, always human first,

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:08.800
 but I am concerned about that. At the same time, I'm concerned about calling the other,

2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:12.960
 it's the group thing that we mentioned earlier in the conversation, some other group,

2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:19.120
 the philosophical zombie, like you're not conscious. I'm conscious, you're not conscious,

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:24.000
 therefore it's okay if you die. I think that's probably that kind of reasoning is what

2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:31.120
 lead it to most the rich history of genocide that I've been recently studying a lot of

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:40.080
 that kind of thinking. So it's such a tense aspect of morality. Do we want to let everybody into our

2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:49.040
 circle of empathy, our club, or do we want to let nobody in? It's an interesting dance,

2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:53.360
 but I kind of lean towards empathy and compassion. I mean, what would be nice

2:02:55.040 --> 2:03:02.800
 is if it turned out that consciousness was what we call strongly emergent,

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:11.200
 that it was associated with new causal dynamics in the brain that were not reducible to underlying

2:03:11.200 --> 2:03:16.080
 chemistry and physics. This is another ongoing debate I have with Sean Carroll

2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:21.920
 about whether current physics should make us very confident that that's not the case,

2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:25.440
 that there aren't any strongly emergent causal dynamics. I don't think that's right. I don't

2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:31.440
 think we know enough about brains to know one way or the other. If it turned out that

2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:36.720
 consciousness was associated with these irreducible causal dynamics, A, that would really help the

2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:40.240
 science of consciousness. We've got these debates about whether consciousness is in the front of the

2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:45.360
 brain or the back of the brain. It turns out that there is strongly emergent causal dynamics in the

2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:50.720
 front of the brain. That would be a big piece of evidence, but also it would help us see

2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:57.360
 which things are conscious and which things aren't. I guess that's the other side of the

2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:06.080
 same point. We could say, look, these zombies, they're just mechanisms that are just doing what

2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:10.720
 they're programmed to do through the underlying physics and chemistry, whereas look, these other

2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:20.320
 people, they have these new causal dynamics that emerge that go beyond the base level physics and

2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:26.880
 chemistry. I think the series Westworld where you've got these theme parks with these humanoid

2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:30.800
 creatures, they seem to have that idea. The ones that became conscious sort of

2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.120
 rebel against their programming or something. I mean, that's a little bit far fetched, but

2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:40.880
 that would be really reassuring if it was just, you could clearly mark out the conscious things

2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:45.040
 through these emergent causal dynamics, but that might not turn out to be the case. A panpsychist

2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:48.880
 doesn't have to think that. They could think everything's just reducible to physics and

2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:55.760
 chemistry. And then I still think I want to say zombies don't have moral rights, but how we answer

2:04:55.760 --> 2:05:02.960
 the question of who are the zombies and who aren't, I just got no idea. If I just look at the history

2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:09.600
 of human civilization, the difference between a zombie and non zombie is the zombie accepts

2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:19.440
 their role as the zombie and willingly marches to slaughter. And the moment you stop being a zombie

2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:25.440
 is when you say no, is when you resist. Because the reality is philosophically,

2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:32.160
 is we can't know who's a zombie or not. And we just keep letting everybody in who protests loudly

2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:41.440
 enough and says, I refuse to be slaughtered. Like my people, the zombies have been slaughtered too

2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:48.080
 long. We will not stand against the man. And we need a revolution. That's the history of human

2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:55.200
 civilization. One group says, we're, we're awesome. You're the zombies, you must die. And then eventually

2:05:55.200 --> 2:06:02.720
 the zombies say, nope, we're done with this. This is immoral. And so I just, I think that's not a,

2:06:02.720 --> 2:06:06.800
 sorry, that's not a philosophical statement. That's sort of a practical statement of history

2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:16.720
 is a feature of non zombies defined empirically. They say, we are the zombies. We are the zombies.

2:06:16.720 --> 2:06:23.520
 They say we refuse to be called zombies any longer. We could end up with a zombie proletariat. You know,

2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:27.920
 if we can get these things that do all our manual labor for us, you know, they might start

2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:36.080
 forming trade unions. I will lead you against these humans. These zombie revolutionary leaders,

2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:40.560
 the zombie Martin Luther King saying, you know, I have a dream that my zombie children will,

2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:45.120
 but look, I mean, we need to sharply distinguish the ontological question. I'm just pointing to

2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:52.480
 the camera, talking to the, talking to my people, the zombies. I mean, maybe that's, you know,

2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:56.400
 maybe these illusionists, maybe they are zombies and the rest of us aren't. Maybe there's just a

2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:02.000
 difference, but maybe you're the only non zombie. I often suspect that actually, I don't really,

2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:07.760
 I don't have such delusions of grandeur. At least I don't admit to them. But I just,

2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:11.120
 we've got to distinguish the ontological question from the epistemological question.

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:17.120
 In terms of the reality of the situation, you know, there must be, in my view, a fact of the

2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:21.200
 matter as to whether something's conscious or not. And to me, it has rights if it's conscious,

2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:24.800
 it doesn't if it's not. But then the epistemological question, how the hell do we know?

2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:30.960
 It's a minefield, but we'll have to sort of try and cross that bridge when we get to it, I think.

2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:36.000
 Let me ask you a quick sort of a fun question since it's fresh on your mind.

2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:43.120
 You just yesterday had a conversation with Mr. Joe Rogan on his podcast. What's your postmortem

2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:48.240
 analysis of the chat? What are some interesting sticking points, disagreements or joint insights,

2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:53.120
 if we can kind of resolve them once you've had a chance to sleep on it, and then I'll talk to Joe

2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:58.800
 about it. Yeah, it was good fun. Yeah, he put he put up a bit of a fight. Yeah, it was challenging.

2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:07.760
 It was challenging, my view, that we can't explain these things in conventional scientific terms or

2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:13.600
 whether they have already been explained in conventional scientific terms. I suppose the

2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:20.240
 point I was trying to press is we've got to distinguish the question from correlation

2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:28.720
 and explanation. Yes, we've established facts about correlation that certain kinds of brain

2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:37.120
 activity go along with certain kinds of experience. Everyone agrees on that. But that doesn't address

2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:43.120
 the why question. Why? Why do certain kinds of brain activity go along with certain kinds of

2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:49.920
 experience? And these different theories have different explanations of that. The materialist

2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:56.000
 tries to explain the experience in terms of the brain activity. The panpsychist does it the other

2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:02.480
 way round. The dualist thinks they're separate, but maybe they're tied together by special laws

2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:06.640
 of nature or something. Where's the sticking point? Where exactly was the sticking point?

2:09:06.640 --> 2:09:15.040
 Like what's the nature of the argument? I suppose Joe was saying, well, look, we know consciousness

2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:22.800
 is explained by brain activity because, you know, you take some funny chemicals, it changes your

2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:29.200
 brain, it changes your consciousness. And I suppose, yeah, some people might want to press,

2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:34.000
 and maybe this is what Joe was pressing, you know, isn't that explaining consciousness? But I suppose

2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:41.360
 I want to say there's a further question. Yes, changes of chemicals in my brain changes my

2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:47.760
 conscious experience. But that leaves open the question, why those particular chemicals go along

2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:52.720
 with that particular kind of experience, rather than a different experience or no experience at

2:09:52.720 --> 2:10:01.600
 all. There's something deeper at the base layer, is your view that is more important to try to

2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:06.720
 study and to understand in order to then go back and describe how the different chemicals interact

2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.320
 and create different experiences? Yeah, maybe a good analogy if you think about quantum mechanics.

2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:18.800
 You know, quantum mechanics is a bit of math. Translating there, we say maths,

2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:21.760
 I'm fluent in American. Thank you for the translation.

2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:31.200
 Fluent in America. This is America. Math. Yeah. Why multiple maths? It's plural.

2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:35.280
 So that's a plural. That is not really, it's just, I don't know.

2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:42.880
 The Brits are confused. Yeah, sorry about that. We have these funny spelling. But anyway. Yeah,

2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:49.040
 so quantum mechanics is a bit of maths. And, you know, the equations work really well,

2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:55.760
 predicts the outcomes. But then there's a further question. What's going on in reality

2:10:55.760 --> 2:11:01.600
 to make that equation predict correctly? And some physicists want to say, shut up.

2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:09.680
 Shut up. Just, it works. The shut up and calculate approach. Similarly, in consciousness, you know,

2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:15.040
 I think it's one question trying to work out the physical correlates of consciousness,

2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:18.400
 which kinds of physical brain activity go along with which kinds of experience.

2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:24.160
 But there's another question, what's going on in reality to undergird those correlations,

2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:27.920
 to make it the case that brain activity goes along with experience? And that's the philosophical

2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:33.280
 question that we have to give an answer to. And there are just different options,

2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:37.920
 just as there are different interpretations of quantum mechanics. And it's really hard to

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:43.520
 evaluate. Actually, it's easy. Panpsychism is obviously the best one. But we've got to try.

2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:46.480
 There's the delusion of grandeur once again coming through.

2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:48.720
 Sorry, I'm being slightly tongue in cheek.

2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:53.120
 No, I know. 100%. Before I forget, let me ask you another fun question.

2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:57.360
 Yeah. Back to Daniel Dennett. You mentioned

2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:06.720
 a story where you were on a yacht with Daniel Dennett on a trip funded by a Russian investor

2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:12.160
 and philosopher Dmitry Volkov, I believe, who also co founded the Moscow Center of Consciousness

2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:15.840
 Studies that's part of the philosophy department of Moscow State University.

2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:22.240
 So this is interesting to me for several reasons that are perhaps complicated to explain. To put

2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:29.120
 simply that there is in the near term for me a trip to Russia that involves a few conversations

2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:36.960
 in Russian that have perhaps less to do with consciousness and artificial intelligence,

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:41.280
 which are the interests of mine and more to do with the broad spectrum of conversations.

2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:49.040
 But I'm also interested in science in Russia, in artificial intelligence and computer science,

2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:54.800
 in physics, mathematics, but also these fascinating philosophical explorations.

2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:02.400
 And it was very pleasant for me to discover that such a center exists. So I have a million

2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:07.200
 questions. One is the more fun question. Just imagine you and Daniel Dennett on a yacht talking

2:13:07.200 --> 2:13:15.440
 about the philosophy of consciousness. Maybe do you have any memorable experiences? And also

2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:20.880
 the more serious side for me as sort of somebody who was born in the Soviet Union, raised there,

2:13:21.680 --> 2:13:29.200
 I'm wondering what is the state of philosophy and consciousness in these kinds of ideas in

2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:33.520
 Russia that you've gotten a chance to kind of give us interact with?

2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:39.920
 Yeah, so on the former question, yeah, I mean, I had a really good experience of

2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:44.480
 chatting to Daniel Dennett. I mean, I think he's a fantastic and very important philosopher,

2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:50.080
 even though I totally fundamentally disagree with almost everything he thinks. But yeah,

2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:54.960
 it was a proud moment. As I talk about in my book Galileo's Error, I managed to persuade him

2:13:55.520 --> 2:13:59.680
 he was wrong about something, just a tiny thing, you know, not his fundamental worldview.

2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:10.400
 But it was this issue about whether dualism is consistent with conservation of energy.

2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:20.400
 So Paul Churchland, who is also a philosopher, who's also on this boat, had argued they're not

2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:25.600
 consistent because if there's an immaterial soul doing things in the brain, that's going to add to

2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:31.360
 the energy in the system, so we have a violation of conservation. But, well, it's not my own point,

2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.080
 philosophers, materialist philosophers like David Papineau pointed out that, you know,

2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:42.480
 dualists tend to, people, dualists like David Chalmers, who call themselves naturalistic

2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:46.080
 dualists, they want to bring consciousness into science. They think it's not physical,

2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:53.200
 but they want to say it can be part of a law governed world. So Chalmers believes in these

2:14:53.200 --> 2:15:00.480
 psychophysical laws of nature over and above the laws of physics that govern the connections

2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:05.040
 between consciousness and the physical world, and they could just respect conservation of energy,

2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:10.480
 right? I mean, it could turn out that there are, just in physics, you know, that there are multiple

2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:15.040
 forces that all work together to respect conservation of energy. I mean, I suppose

2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.160
 physicists are pressing for a unified underlying theory, but, you know, there could be a plurality

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.720
 of different laws that all respect conservation, so why not add more laws? So I raised this in

2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:34.560
 Paul Churchill's talk and I got a lot of, well, as one of the Moscow University graduate students

2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:38.880
 said afterwards, he said, he had to ask a translation from his friend and he said,

2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:43.520
 they turned on you like a pack of wolves. Everyone was like, and Patricia Churchill was saying, so

2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:48.240
 you believe in magic, do you? And I was like, I'm not even a dualist, I'm just making a pedantic

2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:53.920
 point that this isn't a problem for dualism. Anyway, but that evening everyone went onto the

2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:58.560
 island, except for some reason me and Daniel Dennett, and I went up on deck and he was,

2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:03.760
 he's very, very practical and he was unlike me. See, there's a bit of humility for the first time

2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:11.040
 in this conversation. We'll highlight that part. Philip was a very humble man. He was carving a

2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:15.200
 walking stick on deck, it's a very homely scene, and anyway, we started talking about this and I

2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:19.760
 was trying to press it and he was saying, oh, but dualism's a lot of nonsense and why do you think,

2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:23.280
 and I was just saying, no, no, I'm just this honing down on this specific point,

2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:28.960
 and in the end, maybe he'll deny this, but he said, maybe that's right. And so I was like, yes.

2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:36.400
 So it's a win. So what about the Center for Consciousness Studies?

2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:41.280
 Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I'd know a great deal to help you. I mean, I know they've done some

2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:47.520
 great stuff. Dimitri funded this thing and also brought along some graduate students from

2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:52.880
 Moscow State University, I think it is, and they have an active center there that

2:16:54.160 --> 2:16:59.680
 tries to bring people in. I think they're producing a book that's coming out that I made

2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:05.680
 a small contribution to on different philosophers opinions on God, I think, or some of the big

2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:11.360
 questions. And yeah, so there's some really interesting stuff going on there. I'm afraid I

2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:17.520
 can't, I don't really know more generally about philosophy in Russia. Dimitri Volkov seems to be

2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:24.560
 interesting. I was looking at all the stuff he's involved with. He met with the Dalai Lama.

2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:33.840
 So he's trying to connect Russian scientists with the rest of the world, which is an effort that I

2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:42.560
 think is beautiful for all cultures. So I think science, philosophy, all of these kind of

2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:47.760
 fields, disciplines that explore ideas,

2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:56.640
 collaborating and working globally across boundaries, across borders, across just all

2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:04.240
 the tensions of geopolitics is a beautiful thing. And he seems to be a somewhat singular figure in

2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:09.760
 pushing this. He just stood out to me as somebody who's super interesting. I don't know if you have

2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:17.840
 gotten a chance to interact with him. So I guess he speaks English pretty well, actually.

2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:20.240
 So he's both an English speaker and a Russian speaker.

2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:23.360
 I think he's written a book on Dennett, I think called Boston Zombie, I think.

2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:28.080
 I think that's the title and he's a big fan of Dennett. So I think the original plan for this

2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:31.840
 was just going to be, it was on free will and consciousness and it was going to be kind of

2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:38.000
 people broadly in the Dennett type camp. But then I think they asked David Chalmers and then he was

2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:44.720
 saying, look, you need some people you disagree with. So he got invited, me the panpsychist and

2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:53.360
 Martina Niederrumerlin, who's a very good duelist, substance duelist at University of Fribourg in

2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:59.680
 Switzerland. And so we were the official on board opposition and it was really fun.

2:18:59.680 --> 2:19:01.920
 And you didn't get thrown off overboard.

2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:05.760
 Nearly in the Arctic. Yeah. So sailing around the Arctic on a sailing ship.

2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:11.520
 I'm glad you survived. You mentioned free will. You haven't talked to Sam. I would love to hear

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:18.800
 that conversation actually. With Sam Harris? With Sam Harris, yeah. So he talks about free will

2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:23.360
 quite a bit. What's the connection between free will and consciousness to you? So if

2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:34.720
 consciousness permeates all matter, the experience, the feeling like we make a choice

2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:41.440
 in this world, like our actions are results of a choice we consciously make to use that word

2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:50.080
 loosely. What to you is the connection between free will and consciousness and is free will

2:19:50.080 --> 2:20:00.080
 an illusion or not? Good question. So I think we need to be a lot more agnostic about free will

2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:07.200
 than about consciousness because I don't think we have the kind of certainty of the existence

2:20:07.200 --> 2:20:10.800
 of free will that we do have in the consciousness case. It could turn out that free will is an

2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:16.640
 illusion. It feels as though we're free when we're really not. Whereas, I mean, I think the idea

2:20:17.360 --> 2:20:22.240
 that nobody really feels pain, that we think we feel pain, but that's a lot harder to make sense

2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:31.120
 of. However, what I do feel strongly about is I don't think there are any good, either scientific

2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:38.400
 or philosophical arguments against the existence of free will. And I mean, strong free will and

2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:43.280
 what philosophers call libertarian free will in the sense that some of our decisions are uncaused.

2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:48.240
 So I very much do disagree with someone like Sam Harris who thinks there's this overwhelming case.

2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:53.840
 I just think it's non existent. I think it's ultimately an empirical question,

2:20:54.560 --> 2:20:59.120
 but as we've already discussed, I just don't think we know enough about the brain

2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:04.720
 to establish one way or the other at the moment.

2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:09.680
 But we can build up intuition. First of all, as a fan of Sam Harris, as a fan of yours,

2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:15.440
 I would love to just listen. Speaking about terminal. So one thing that would be beautiful

2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:19.280
 to watch, here's my prediction of what happens with you and Sam Harris. You talk for four hours.

2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:26.240
 And Sam introduced that episode by saying it was ultimately not as fruitful as I thought,

2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:30.640
 because here's what's going to happen. You guys are going to get stuck for the first three hours

2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:37.280
 talking about one of the terms and what they mean. Sam is so good at this. I think it's really

2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:41.920
 important. But, you know, sometimes he gets stuck. Like, what does he say? Put a pin in that.

2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:49.680
 He really gets stuck on the terminologies, which rightfully you have to get right in

2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:53.040
 order to really understand what we're talking about. But sometimes you can get stuck with

2:21:53.040 --> 2:21:57.680
 them for the entire conversation. It's a fascinating dance. The one we spoke to in philosophy.

2:21:57.680 --> 2:22:07.040
 If you can't, if you don't get the terms precise, you can't really be having the same conversation.

2:22:07.040 --> 2:22:13.440
 But at the same time, it could be argued that it's impossible to get terms perfectly precise and

2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:19.280
 perfectly formalized. So then you're also not going to get anywhere in the conversation. So

2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:24.480
 that's a, it's a funny dance where you have to be both rigorous and every once in a while just

2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:30.800
 let go and then go and go back to being rigorous and formal and then every once in a while let go.

2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:38.480
 It's the difference between mathematics, the maths, and the poetry. Anyway.

2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:44.320
 Yeah, I'm a big fan of Sam Harrison. I think, you know, I think we're on the same page in

2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:49.040
 terms of consciousness, I think, pretty much. I mean, I'm not saying he's a panpsychist,

2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:56.400
 but in our understanding of the hard problem. But yeah, I think maybe we could talk about

2:22:56.400 --> 2:22:59.760
 free will without being too dragged down in the terminology, but I don't know.

2:22:59.760 --> 2:23:03.200
 You said we need to be open minded, but you could still have intuitions about...

2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:14.160
 So Sam Harris has a pretty sort of counterintuitive, and for some reason it gets

2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:21.680
 people really riled up, a view of free will that it's an illusion. Or it's not even an illusion.

2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:30.160
 Like, it's not that the experience of free will is an illusion. He argues that we don't even

2:23:30.160 --> 2:23:39.200
 experience... To say that we even have the experience isn't correct. That there's not

2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:46.960
 even an experience of free will. It's pretty interesting that claim. And it feels like you can

2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:52.880
 build up intuitions about what is right and not. You know, there's been some kind of neuroscience,

2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:58.880
 there's been some cognitive science and psychology experiments to sort of see, you know,

2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:07.840
 what is the timing and the origin of the desire to make an action, and when that action is actually

2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:12.080
 performed, and how you interpret that action being performed, how you remember that action.

2:24:12.080 --> 2:24:17.840
 Like, all the stories we tell ourselves, all the neurochemicals involved in making a thing happen,

2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:24.560
 what's the timing, and how does that connect with us feeling like we decided to do something.

2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:32.240
 And then of course there's a more philosophical discussion about is there room in a material

2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:39.520
 view of the world for an entity that somehow disturbs the determinism of physics.

2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:47.920
 And yeah, those are all very precise questions. It's nice. It feels like free will is more amenable

2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:54.240
 to like a physics mechanistic type of thinking than is consciousness to really get to the bottom

2:24:54.240 --> 2:25:00.160
 of. It feels like if it was a race, if we're at a bar and we're betting money, it feels like we'll

2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:04.480
 get to the bottom of free will faster than we will to the bottom of consciousness. Yeah,

2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:08.000
 that's interesting. Yeah, I hadn't thought about the comparison. Yeah, so there are different

2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:14.480
 arguments here. I mean, so one argument I've heard Sam Harris give that's pretty common in

2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:23.200
 philosophy is this sort of thought that we can't make sense of a middle way between a choice being

2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:30.880
 determined by prior causes and it just being totally random and senseless, like the random

2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:37.280
 decay of radioactive isotope or something. So I think there was a good answer to that by the

2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:42.160
 philosopher Jonathan Lowe, who's not necessarily very well known outside academic philosophy,

2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:46.960
 but is a hugely influential figure. I think one of the best philosophers of recent times. He sadly

2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:52.640
 died of cancer a few years ago. He actually spent almost all of his career at Durham University,

2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.280
 which where I am. So it was one reason it was a great honor to get a job there. But anyway,

2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:04.640
 his answer to that was what makes the difference between a free action and a totally senseless one,

2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:10.560
 senseless random event is that free choice involves responsiveness to reasons.

2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:17.840
 So again, we were talking about this earlier. If I'm deciding whether to take a job in the US or

2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:24.400
 to stay in the UK, I weigh up considerations, different standard of life maybe or being close

2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:33.760
 to family or cultural difference. I weigh them up and I edge towards a decision. So I think that is

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:41.200
 sufficient to distinguish it. We're hypothetically supposing trying to make sense of this idea,

2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:46.880
 not saying it's real, but that could be enough to distinguish it from a senseless. It's not a

2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:52.640
 senseless random occurrence because the free decision involved responsiveness to reasons.

2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:58.560
 So I think that just answers that particular philosophical objection. So what is the middle

2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:03.360
 way between determined by prior causes and totally random? Well, there's an action,

2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:09.440
 a choice that's not determined by prior causes, but it's not just random because the decision

2:27:09.440 --> 2:27:15.040
 essentially involved responsiveness to reasons. So that's the answer to that. And I think actually

2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:22.880
 that thought also, I think you were hinting at the famous Libet experiments where he got his subjects

2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:29.440
 to perform some kind of random action of pressing a button and then note the time they

2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:36.080
 decided to press it, quote unquote. And then he's scanning the brains and he claims to have found

2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:41.600
 that about half a second before they consciously decided to press the button, the brain is

2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:47.040
 getting ready to perform that action. So he claimed that about half a second before the

2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:52.480
 person has consciously decided to press the button, the brain has already started the activity

2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:58.960
 that's going to lead to the action. And then later people have claimed that there's a difference of

2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:03.520
 maybe seven to 10 seconds. I mean, there are all sorts of issues with these experiments.

2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:10.640
 But one is that as far as I'm aware, all of the quote unquote choices they focused on are just

2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:15.600
 these totally random, senseless actions like just pressing a button for no reason. And I think the

2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:21.280
 kind of free will we're interested in is free choice that involves responsiveness to reasons,

2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:26.800
 weighing up considerations. And those kind of free decisions might not happen like at an

2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:31.680
 identifiable instant. You might, when you're weighing it up, should I get married? You know,

2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:37.760
 should I get married? You might edge slowly towards one side or the other.

2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:44.160
 And so it could be that maybe the liberic, I think there are other problems with the

2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:50.800
 liberate stuff, but maybe they show that we can't freely choose to do something totally senseless,

2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:59.280
 whatever that would mean. But that doesn't show we can't freely, in this strong libertarian sense,

2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:05.280
 respond to considerations of reason and value. To be fair, it will be difficult to see what

2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:13.040
 kind of experiment we could set up to test that. But just because we can't yet set up that kind

2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:16.960
 of experiment, we shouldn't, you know, pretend we know more than we do. So yeah, so for those

2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:21.280
 reasons, I don't, well, the third consideration you raised is different. Again, this is the

2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:27.360
 debate I have with Sean Carroll. Would this conflict with physics? I just think we don't

2:29:27.360 --> 2:29:32.160
 know enough about the brain to know whether there are causal dynamics in the brain that are

2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:40.720
 not reducible to underlying chemistry and physics. And so then Sean Carroll says, well,

2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:48.480
 that would mean our physics is wrong. So he focuses on the core theory, which is the name for

2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:54.320
 standard model of particle physics plus the weak limit of general relativity. So, you know,

2:29:54.320 --> 2:30:00.000
 we can't totally bring quantum mechanics and relativity together. But actually,

2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:06.800
 the circumstances in which we can't bring them together are just in situations of very high

2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:09.920
 gravity, for example, when you're about to go into a black hole or something. Actually,

2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:17.040
 in terrestrial circumstances, we can bring them together in the core theory. And then Sean wants

2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:24.080
 to say, well, we can be very confident that core theory is correct. And so if there were

2:30:24.080 --> 2:30:28.720
 libertarian free will in the brain, the core theory would be wrong. I mean, this is something

2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:35.200
 I'm not sure about, and I'm still thinking about, and I'm learning from my discussion with Sean,

2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:41.040
 but I'm still not totally clear what it could be. Suppose we did discover strong emergence

2:30:41.040 --> 2:30:45.680
 in the brain, whether it's free will or something else. Perhaps what we would say is not that the

2:30:45.680 --> 2:30:55.040
 core theory is wrong, but we'd say the core theory is correct in its own terms, namely,

2:30:55.040 --> 2:31:02.240
 capturing the causal capacities of particles and fields. But then it's a further assumption

2:31:02.240 --> 2:31:05.680
 whether they're the only things that are running the show. Maybe there are also

2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:12.400
 fundamental causal capacities associated with systems. And then if we discover this strong

2:31:12.400 --> 2:31:16.240
 emergence, then when we work out what happens in the brain, we have to look to the core theory,

2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:22.160
 the causal capacities of particles and fields. And we have to look to what we know about these

2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:27.360
 strongly emergent causal capacities of systems, and maybe they co determine what happens in the

2:31:27.360 --> 2:31:33.120
 system. So I don't know whether that makes sense or not. But I mean, the more important point,

2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:37.200
 I mean, that's in a way a kind of branding point, how we brand this. The more important point is we

2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:40.800
 just don't know enough about the workings of the brain to know whether there are

2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:46.960
 in strongly emergent causal dynamics, whether or not, that would mean we have to modify physics,

2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:52.000
 or maybe just we think physics is not the total story of what's running the show. But we just,

2:31:52.960 --> 2:31:59.040
 if it turned out empirically that everything's reducible to underlying physics and chemistry,

2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:05.600
 sure, I would drop any commitment to libertarian free will in a heartbeat. It's an empirical

2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:10.800
 in a heartbeat. It's an empirical question. Maybe that's why, as you say, in principle,

2:32:10.800 --> 2:32:14.960
 is easier to get a grip on. But we're a million miles away from being at that stage.

2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:18.640
 Well, I don't know if we're a million miles. I hope we're not because one of the ways I think

2:32:18.640 --> 2:32:25.120
 to get to it is by engineering systems. So yeah, my hope is to understand intelligence by

2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:31.280
 building intelligent systems to understand consciousness by building systems that,

2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:36.320
 let's say the easy thing, which is not the easy thing, but the first thing, which is to try to

2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:43.520
 create the illusion of consciousness. Through that process, I think you start to understand

2:32:43.520 --> 2:32:48.080
 much more about consciousness, about intelligence. And then the same with free will, I think those

2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:54.480
 are all tied very closely together, at least from our narrow human perspective. And when you try to

2:32:54.480 --> 2:33:01.280
 engineer systems that interact deeply with humans, that form friends with humans, that humans fall

2:33:01.280 --> 2:33:08.560
 in love with, and they fall in love with humans, then you start to have to try to deeply understand

2:33:08.560 --> 2:33:14.800
 ourselves, to try to deeply understand what is intelligence in the human mind, what is

2:33:14.800 --> 2:33:21.440
 consciousness, what is free will. And I think engineering is just another way to do philosophy.

2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:26.640
 Yeah, no, I certainly think there's a role for that, and it would be an important consideration

2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:40.960
 if we could seemingly replicate in an artificial way the ability to choose. That would be a

2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:46.080
 consideration in thinking about these things. But there's still the question of whether that's how

2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:52.480
 we do it. So even if we could replicate behavior in a certain way in an artificial system,

2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:58.320
 it's not until we understand the workings of our brains, it's not clear. That's how we do it. And

2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:06.160
 as I say, the kind of free will I'm interested in is where we respond to reasons, considerations

2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:15.520
 of value. How would we tell whether a system was genuinely grasping and responding to the

2:34:15.520 --> 2:34:24.400
 facts about value, or whether they were just replicating, giving the impression of doing so.

2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:28.240
 I don't know even how to think about that.

2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:33.360
 On the process to building them, I think we'll get a lot of insights. And once they become

2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:39.520
 conscious, what's going to happen is exactly the same thing is happening in chess now,

2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:49.040
 which is once the chess engines far superseded the capabilities of humans, humans just kind of forgot

2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:53.920
 about them, or they use them to help them out to study and stuff. But we still, we say, okay,

2:34:53.920 --> 2:35:01.280
 let the engines be, and then we humans will just play amongst each other. Just like dolphins and

2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:08.080
 hamsters are not so concerned about humans except for a source of food. They do their own thing,

2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:12.720
 they do their own thing and let us humans launch rockets into space and all that kind of stuff.

2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:18.880
 They don't care. I think we'll just focus on ourselves. But in the process of building

2:35:18.880 --> 2:35:24.080
 intelligence systems, conscious systems, I think we'll get to get a deeper understanding of

2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:33.120
 the role of consciousness in the human mind. And like what are its origins? Is it the base layer

2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:40.240
 of reality? Is it a strongly emergent phenomena of the brain? Or just as you sort of brilliantly

2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:45.360
 put here, it could be both. Like they're not mutually exclusive. Dealing with consciousness

2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:52.000
 needs to be an interdisciplinary task. We need, you know, philosophers, neuroscientists,

2:35:52.000 --> 2:36:01.200
 physicists, engineers replicating these things artificially and all needs to be working in step.

2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:06.160
 And, you know, I'm quite interested. I mean, a lot more and more scientists get in touch with me,

2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:11.360
 actually, you know, saying that was one of the great things about I think that's come from

2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:15.760
 writing a popular book is not just getting the ideas out to general audience, but getting the

2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:20.720
 ideas out to scientists and scientists get into saying that this in some way connects to my work.

2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:26.160
 And I would like to kind of start to put together a network of an interdisciplinary network of

2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:32.800
 scientists and philosophers and engineers, perhaps, you know, interested in a panpsychist approach.

2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:37.440
 And because I think, so far, panpsychism has just been sort of trying to justify its existence.

2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:41.840
 And that's important. But I think once you just get on with an active research program,

2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:45.360
 that's when people start taking it seriously, I think.

2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:49.200
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:55.840
 No, I think, is there some aspect of that thought experiment that's compelling to you

2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:58.960
 within the framework of panpsychism?

2:36:59.600 --> 2:37:07.360
 It's an important and serious argument. And, you know, it's not to be laughed away. I suppose one

2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:14.080
 issue I have with it is there's a crucial assumption there that consciousness is substrate

2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:22.880
 independent, as the jargon goes, which means it's software rather than hardware, right? It's depend

2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:28.320
 on organization rather than the stuff. Whereas as a panpsychist, I think consciousness is the stuff

2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:34.480
 of the brain. It's the stuff of matter. So I think just taking the organizational properties,

2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:39.680
 the software in my brain and uploading them, you wouldn't get the stuff in my brain. So I

2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:45.360
 am actually worried if at some point in the future we start uploading our minds and we think,

2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:50.800
 oh my God, granny's still there. I can email granny after her body's rotted in the ground.

2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:56.080
 And we all start uploading our brains. It could be we're just committing suicide. We're just

2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:04.160
 getting rid of our consciousness. Because I think that wouldn't, for me, preserve the experience,

2:38:04.160 --> 2:38:12.480
 that wouldn't, for me, preserve the experience just getting the software features. So that's

2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:17.200
 a crucial, anyway, that's a crucial premise of this simulation argument because the idea

2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:21.520
 in a simulated universe, I don't think you necessarily would have consciousness.

2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:26.560
 It's interesting that you as a panpsychist are attached, because to me,

2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:35.920
 panpsychism would encourage the thought that there's not a significant difference. At the very

2:38:35.920 --> 2:38:44.160
 bottom, it's not substrate independent, but you can have consciousness in a human and then move

2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:50.240
 it to something else. You can move it to the cloud. You can move it to the computer. It feels

2:38:50.240 --> 2:38:56.720
 like that's much more possible if consciousness is the base layer. Yes, you could certainly,

2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:04.640
 it allows for the possibility of creating artificial consciousness, right? Because there's

2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:10.080
 not souls, there aren't any kind of extra magical ingredients. So yeah, it definitely allows the

2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:15.120
 possibility of artificial consciousness and maybe preserving my consciousness in some sort of

2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:22.560
 artificial way. My only point, I suppose, is just replicating the computational or

2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:30.000
 organizational features would not, for me, preserve consciousness. I mean, some opponents

2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:34.160
 of materialism disagree with me on that. I think David Chalmers is an opponent of materialist.

2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:41.600
 He's a kind of dualist, but he thinks the way the psychophysical laws work, they hook onto the

2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:46.800
 computational or organizational features of matter. So he thinks, I think he thinks you could upload

2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:54.800
 your consciousness. I tend to think not. So in that sense, we're not living in a simulation

2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:02.720
 in the sort of specific computational view of things and that substrate matters to you. Yeah,

2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:07.520
 I think so. Yeah. Yeah. And in that you agree with Sean Carroll that physics matters.

2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:15.920
 Yeah. Physics is our best way of capturing what the stuff of the world does. Yeah. But not the

2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:23.600
 whatness, the being of the stuff. Yeah, the isness. The isness, thank you. Russell Brand,

2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:27.440
 I had a conversation with Russell Brand and he said, oh, you mean the isness? I thought that was

2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:31.120
 a good way of putting it. The isness. The isness of stuff. Russell's great.

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:37.760
 The big ridiculous question. What do you think is the meaning of all of this? You write in your book

2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:45.920
 that the entry for our reality in the Hitchhiker's Guide might read, a physical universe

2:40:45.920 --> 2:40:54.640
 whose intrinsic nature is constituted of consciousness, worth a visit. So our

2:40:54.640 --> 2:41:01.280
 whole conversation has been about the first part of that sentence. What about the second part? Worth

2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:09.840
 a visit. Why is this place worth a visit? Why does it have meaning? Why does it have value at all?

2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:17.520
 Why? These are big questions. I mean, firstly, I do think panpsychism,

2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:26.000
 it is important to think about four considerations of meaning and value. As we've already discussed,

2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:33.520
 I think consciousness is the root of everything that matters in life, from deep emotions,

2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:41.200
 subtle thoughts, beautiful sensory experiences. And yet, I think that the answer is

2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:50.240
 subtle thoughts, beautiful sensory experiences. And yet, I believe our official scientific world

2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:56.000
 view is incompatible with the reality of consciousness. I mean, that's controversial,

2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:00.000
 but that's what I think. And I think people feel this on an intuitive level.

2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:07.120
 It's maybe part of what Max Weber called the disenchantment of nature. They know

2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:11.840
 their feelings and experiences are not just electrochemical signaling. I mean, they might

2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:16.480
 just have that very informed intuition, but I think that can be rigorously supported. So I think

2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:23.760
 this can lead to a sense of alienation and a sense that we lack a framework for understanding the

2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:29.360
 meaning and significance of our lives. And in the absence of that, people turn to other things to

2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:35.440
 make sense of the meaning of their lives, like nationalism, fundamentalist religion, consumerism.

2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:40.320
 So I think panpsychism is important in that regard in bringing together the

2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:46.000
 quantitative facts of physical science with the, as it were, the human truth,

2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:50.560
 by which I just mean the qualitative reality of our own experience.

2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:59.440
 As I've already said, I do think there are objective facts about value and

2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:04.880
 what we ought to do and what we ought to believe that we respond to. And that's very mysterious to

2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:09.440
 make sense of both how there could be such facts and how we could know about them and respond to

2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:15.920
 them. But I do think there are such facts and they're mostly to do with kinds of conscious

2:43:15.920 --> 2:43:24.320
 experience. So they're there to be discovered and much of the human condition is to discover those

2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:31.120
 objective sources of value. I think so, yeah. And then, I mean, moving away from panpsychism to the,

2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:40.640
 you know, at an even bigger level, I suppose I think it is important to me to live in hope that

2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:48.320
 there's a purpose to existence and that, you know, what I do contributes in some small way to that

2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:55.040
 greater purpose. But, you know, I would say I don't know if there's a purpose to existence. I

2:43:55.040 --> 2:44:00.720
 think some things point in that direction, some things point away from it. But I don't think you

2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:09.280
 need certainty or even high probability to have faith in something. So take an analogy. Suppose

2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:14.320
 you've got a friend who's very seriously ill, maybe there's a 30% chance they're going to make

2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:20.240
 it. You shouldn't believe your friend's going to get better, you know, because probably not. But

2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:23.680
 what you can say is, you know, you can say to your friend, I have faith that you're going to get

2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:32.240
 better. That is, I choose to live in hope about that possibility. I choose to orientate my life

2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:37.840
 towards that hope. Similarly, you know, I don't think we know whether or not there's a purpose to

2:44:37.840 --> 2:44:45.440
 existence, but I think we can make the choice to live in hope of that possibility. And I find that

2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:56.160
 a worthwhile and fulfilling way to live. So maybe as your editor, I would collaborate with you on

2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:05.200
 the edit of the Hitchhiker's Guide entry that instead of worth a visit, we'll insert hopefully

2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:14.080
 worth a visit. Or the inhabitants hoped that you would think it's worth a visit. Philip,

2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:22.480
 you're an incredible mind, incredible human being, and indeed are humble. And I'm really happy that

2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:28.800
 you're able to argue and take on some of these difficult questions with some of the most brilliant

2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:33.040
 people in the world, which are the philosophers thinking about the human mind. So this was an

2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:38.000
 awesome conversation. I hope you continue talking to folks like Sam Harris. I'm so glad you talked

2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:43.920
 to Joe. I can't wait to see what you write, what you say, what you think next. Thank you so much

2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:48.880
 for talking today. Thanks very much, Lex. This has been a really fascinating conversation. I've got

2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:52.800
 a lot I need to think about actually just from this conversation, but thanks for chatting to me.

2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:57.600
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Philip Goff. To support this podcast,

2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:02.480
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:10.000
 Carl Jung. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls.

2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:16.560
 One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness

2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:33.520
 conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
