00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
 turns out that if you train a planarian and then cut their heads off, the tail will regenerate a

00:04.640 --> 00:09.760
 brand new brain that still remembers the original information. I think planaria hold the answer to

00:09.760 --> 00:14.800
 pretty much every deep question of life. For one thing, they're similar to our ancestors. So they

00:14.800 --> 00:17.600
 have true symmetry, they have a true brain, they're not like earthworms, they're, you know,

00:17.600 --> 00:20.640
 they're much more advanced life form. They have lots of different internal organs, but they're

00:20.640 --> 00:24.560
 these little, they're about, you know, maybe two centimeters in the centimeter to two in size.

00:24.560 --> 00:30.640
 And they have a head and a tail. And the first thing is planaria are immortal. So they do not

00:30.640 --> 00:34.320
 age. There's no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there tells you that these theories

00:34.320 --> 00:40.080
 of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It's not that well over time of everything

00:40.080 --> 00:44.560
 degrades. No, planaria can keep it going for probably, you know, how long have they been

00:44.560 --> 00:48.640
 around 400 million years, right? So these are the actual, so the planaria in our lab

00:48.640 --> 00:54.880
 are actually in physical continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago.

00:54.880 --> 01:00.080
 The following is a conversation with Michael Levin, one of the most fascinating and brilliant

01:00.080 --> 01:07.120
 biologists I've ever talked to. He and his lab at Tufts University works on novel ways to understand

01:07.120 --> 01:12.960
 and control complex pattern formation in biological systems. Andre Karpathy, a world

01:12.960 --> 01:18.880
 class AI researcher, is the person who first introduced me to Michael Levin's work. I bring

01:18.880 --> 01:25.680
 this up because these two people make me realize that biology has a lot to teach us about AI,

01:25.680 --> 01:32.000
 and AI might have a lot to teach us about biology. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.440
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

01:37.440 --> 01:44.480
 here's Michael Levin. Embryogenesis is the process of building the human body from a single cell. I

01:44.480 --> 01:50.160
 think it's one of the most incredible things that exists on earth from a single embryo. So how does

01:50.160 --> 01:56.080
 this process work? Yeah, it is an incredible process. I think it's maybe the most magical

01:56.080 --> 02:01.520
 process there is. And I think one of the most fundamentally interesting things about it is that

02:01.520 --> 02:07.120
 it shows that each of us takes the journey from so called just physics to mind, right? Because we

02:07.120 --> 02:12.880
 all start life as a single quiescent, unfertilized oocyte, and it's basically a bag of chemicals,

02:12.880 --> 02:16.720
 and you look at that and you say, okay, this is chemistry and physics. And then nine months and

02:16.720 --> 02:22.320
 some years later, you have an organism with high level cognition and preferences and an inner life

02:22.320 --> 02:27.520
 and so on. And what embryogenesis tells us is that that transformation from physics to mind is

02:27.520 --> 02:32.560
 gradual. It's smooth. There is no special place where, you know, a lightning bolt says, boom,

02:32.560 --> 02:37.440
 now you've gone from physics to true cognition. That doesn't happen. And so we can see in this

02:37.440 --> 02:41.440
 process that the whole mystery, you know, the biggest mystery of the universe, basically,

02:41.440 --> 02:47.680
 how you get mind from matter. From just physics, in quotes. Yeah. So where's the magic into the

02:47.680 --> 02:54.480
 thing? How do we get from information encoded in DNA and make physical reality out of that

02:54.480 --> 02:59.280
 information? So one of the things that I think is really important if we're going to bring in DNA

02:59.280 --> 03:05.520
 into this picture is to think about the fact that what DNA encodes is the hardware of life. DNA

03:05.520 --> 03:09.760
 contains the instructions for the kind of micro level hardware that every cell gets to play with.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.160
 So all the proteins, all the signaling factors, the ion channels, all the cool little pieces of

03:14.160 --> 03:20.640
 hardware that cells have, that's what's in the DNA. The rest of it is in so called generic laws.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.920
 And these are laws of mathematics. These are laws of computation. These are laws of physics,

03:25.920 --> 03:32.000
 of all kinds of interesting things that are not directly in the DNA. And that process, you know,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.800
 I think the reason I always put just physics in quotes is because I don't think there is such a

03:36.800 --> 03:41.520
 thing as just physics. I think that thinking about these things in binary categories, like this is

03:41.520 --> 03:45.840
 physics, this is true cognition, this is as if it's only faking these kinds of things. I think

03:45.840 --> 03:49.760
 that's what gets us in trouble. I think that we really have to understand that it's a continuum

03:49.760 --> 03:53.600
 and we have to work up the scaling, the laws of scaling. And we can certainly talk about that.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.640
 There's a lot of really interesting thoughts to be had there.

03:56.640 --> 04:03.200
 So the physics is deeply integrated with the information. So the DNA doesn't exist on its own.

04:03.200 --> 04:10.480
 The DNA is integrated as, in some sense, in response to the laws of physics at every scale.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.080
 The laws of the environment it exists in.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.960
 Yeah, the environment and also the laws of the universe. I mean, the thing about the DNA is that

04:18.960 --> 04:25.440
 it's once evolution discovers a certain kind of machine, that if the physical implementation is

04:25.440 --> 04:29.920
 appropriate, it's sort of, and this is hard to talk about because we don't have a good vocabulary

04:29.920 --> 04:36.560
 for this yet, but it's a very kind of a platonic notion that if the machine is there, it pulls down

04:36.560 --> 04:42.960
 interesting things that you do not have to evolve from scratch because the laws of physics give it

04:42.960 --> 04:47.200
 to you for free. So just as a really stupid example, if you're trying to evolve a particular

04:47.200 --> 04:50.720
 triangle, you can evolve the first angle and you evolve the second angle, but you don't need to

04:50.720 --> 04:54.480
 evolve the third. You know what it is already. Now, why do you know? That's a gift for free

04:54.480 --> 04:58.240
 from geometry in a particular space. You know what that angle has to be. And if you evolve

04:58.240 --> 05:01.920
 an ion channel, which is, ion channels are basically transistors, right? They're voltage

05:01.920 --> 05:06.720
 gated current conductances. If you evolve that ion channel, you immediately get to use things

05:06.720 --> 05:10.160
 like truth tables. You get logic functions. You don't have to evolve the logic function.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.160
 You don't have to evolve a truth table. It doesn't have to be in the DNA. You get it for free,

05:14.160 --> 05:17.360
 right? And the fact that if you have NAND gates, you can build anything you want, you get that for

05:17.360 --> 05:22.720
 free. All you have to evolve is that first step, that first little machine that enables you to

05:22.720 --> 05:27.680
 couple to those laws. And there's laws of adhesion and many other things. And this is all that

05:27.680 --> 05:33.600
 interplay between the hardware that's set up by the genetics and the software that's made, right?

05:33.600 --> 05:38.240
 The physiological software that basically does all the computation and the cognition and everything

05:38.240 --> 05:43.920
 else is a real interplay between the information and the DNA and the laws of physics of computation

05:43.920 --> 05:49.360
 and so on. So is it fair to say, just like this idea that the laws of mathematics are discovered,

05:50.640 --> 05:55.520
 they're latent within the fabric of the universe in that same way the laws of biology are kind of

05:55.520 --> 05:59.760
 discovered? Yeah, I think that's absolutely, and it's probably not a popular view, but I think

05:59.760 --> 06:05.520
 that's right on the money. Yeah. Well, I think that's a really deep idea. Then embryogenesis

06:05.520 --> 06:16.000
 is the process of revealing, of embodying, of manifesting these laws. You're not building the

06:16.000 --> 06:23.520
 laws. You're just creating the capacity to reveal. Yes. I think, again, not the standard view of

06:23.520 --> 06:27.760
 molecular biology by any means, but I think that's right on the money. I'll give you a simple example.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.680
 Some of our latest work with these xenobots, right? So what we've done is to take some skin

06:31.680 --> 06:36.080
 cells off of an early frog embryo and basically ask about their plasticity. If we give you a

06:36.080 --> 06:40.400
 chance to sort of reboot your multicellularity in a different context, what would you do?

06:40.400 --> 06:45.120
 Because what you might assume by... The thing about embryogenesis is that it's super reliable,

06:45.120 --> 06:50.640
 right? It's very robust. And that really obscures some of its most interesting features. We get

06:50.640 --> 06:54.800
 used to it. We get used to the fact that acorns make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs. And we

06:54.800 --> 06:57.920
 say, well, what else is it going to make? That's what it makes. That's a standard story.

06:57.920 --> 07:03.600
 But the reality is... And so you look at these skin cells and you say, well, what do they know

07:03.600 --> 07:07.840
 how to do? Well, they know how to be a passive boring two dimensional outer layer, keeping the

07:07.840 --> 07:11.200
 bacteria from getting into the embryo. That's what they know how to do. Well, it turns out that if

07:11.200 --> 07:17.040
 you take these skin cells and you remove the rest of the embryo, so you remove all of the rest of

07:17.040 --> 07:20.960
 the cells and you say, well, you're by yourself now, what do you want to do? So what they do is

07:20.960 --> 07:26.480
 they form this multi little creature that runs around the dish. They have all kinds of incredible

07:26.480 --> 07:30.960
 and incredible capacities. They navigate through mazes. They have various behaviors that they do

07:30.960 --> 07:38.960
 both independently and together. Basically, they implement von Neumann's dream of self replication,

07:38.960 --> 07:42.560
 because if you sprinkle a bunch of loose cells into the dish, what they do is they run around,

07:42.560 --> 07:46.800
 they collect those cells into little piles. They sort of mush them together until those little

07:46.800 --> 07:50.960
 piles become the next generation of xenobots. So you've got this machine that builds copies of

07:50.960 --> 07:56.720
 itself from loose material in its environment. None of this are things that you would have expected

07:56.720 --> 08:01.280
 from the frog genome. In fact, the genome is wild type. There's nothing wrong with their genetics.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.320
 Nothing has been added, no nanomaterials, no genomic editing, nothing. And so what we have

08:06.320 --> 08:11.360
 done there is engineered by subtraction. What you've done is you've removed the other cells

08:11.360 --> 08:15.920
 that normally basically bully these cells into being skin cells. And you find out that what they

08:15.920 --> 08:21.680
 really want to do is to be this, their default behaviors to be a xenobot. But in vivo, in the

08:21.680 --> 08:28.640
 embryo, they get told to be skinned by these other cell types. And so now here comes this really

08:28.640 --> 08:33.760
 interesting question that you just posed. When you ask where does the form of the tadpole and

08:33.760 --> 08:39.920
 the frog come from, the standard answer is, well, it's selection. So over millions of years,

08:39.920 --> 08:44.720
 it's been shaped to produce the specific body that's fit for froggy environments.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.240
 Where does the shape of the xenobot come from? There's never been any xenobots. There's never

08:48.240 --> 08:51.920
 been selection to be a good xenobot. These cells find themselves in the new environment.

08:51.920 --> 08:57.920
 In 48 hours, they figure out how to be an entirely different protoorganism with new capacities like

08:57.920 --> 09:02.000
 kinematic self replication. That's not how frogs or tadpoles replicate. We've made it impossible

09:02.000 --> 09:05.600
 for them to replicate their normal way. Within a couple of days, these guys find a new way of

09:05.600 --> 09:09.200
 doing it that's not done anywhere else in the biosphere. Well, actually, let's step back and

09:09.200 --> 09:16.320
 define, what are xenobots? So a xenobot is a self assembling little protoorganism. It's also a

09:16.320 --> 09:22.000
 biological robot. Those things are not distinct. It's a member of both classes. How much is it

09:22.000 --> 09:28.160
 biology? How much is that robot? At this point, most of it is biology because what we're doing is

09:28.160 --> 09:35.120
 we're discovering natural behaviors of the cells and also of the cell collectives. Now, one of the

09:35.120 --> 09:39.440
 really important parts of this was that we're working together with Josh Bongaert's group at

09:39.440 --> 09:45.040
 University of Vermont. They're computer scientists, they do AI, and they've basically been able to

09:45.040 --> 09:51.440
 use a simulated evolution approach to ask, how can we manipulate these cells, give them signals,

09:51.440 --> 09:56.080
 not rewire their DNA, so not hardware, but experience signals? So can we remove some cells?

09:56.080 --> 09:59.920
 Can we add some cells? Can we poke them in different ways to get them to do other things?

09:59.920 --> 10:04.400
 So in the future, there's going to be, we're now, and this is future unpublished work, but

10:04.400 --> 10:08.720
 we're doing all sorts of interesting ways to reprogram them to new behaviors. But before you

10:08.720 --> 10:13.040
 can start to reprogram these things, you have to understand what their innate capacities are.

10:13.040 --> 10:19.520
 Okay, so that means engineering, programming, you're engineering them in the future. And in

10:19.520 --> 10:28.400
 some sense, the definition of a robot is something you in part engineer versus evolve. I mean,

10:28.400 --> 10:33.280
 it's such a fuzzy definition anyway, in some sense, many of the organisms within our body

10:33.280 --> 10:40.640
 are kinds of robots. And I think robots is a weird line because it's, we tend to see robots

10:40.640 --> 10:45.760
 as the other. I think there will be a time in the future when there's going to be something akin to

10:45.760 --> 10:52.800
 the civil rights movements for robots, but we'll talk about that later perhaps. Anyway, so how do

10:52.800 --> 11:00.000
 you, can we just linger on it? How do you build a Xenobot? What are we talking about here? From

11:00.560 --> 11:06.640
 when does it start and how does it become the glorious Xenobot?

11:06.640 --> 11:12.080
 Yeah, so just to take one step back, one of the things that a lot of people get stuck on is they

11:12.080 --> 11:19.120
 say, well, you know, engineering requires new DNA circuits or it requires new nanomaterials,

11:19.120 --> 11:24.560
 you know, what the thing is, we are now moving from old school engineering, which use passive

11:24.560 --> 11:28.480
 materials, right? That things, you know, wood, metal, things like this, that basically the only

11:28.480 --> 11:31.280
 thing you could depend on is that they were going to keep their shape. That's it. They don't do

11:31.280 --> 11:35.120
 anything else. It's on you as an engineer to make them do everything they're going to do.

11:35.120 --> 11:39.040
 And then there were active materials and now computation materials. This is a whole new era.

11:39.040 --> 11:43.600
 These are agential materials. This is you're now collaborating with your substrate because your

11:43.600 --> 11:51.280
 material has an agenda. These cells have, you know, billions of years of evolution. They have goals.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.160
 They have preferences. They're not just going to sit where you put them. That's hilarious that you

11:54.160 --> 11:58.880
 have to talk your material into keeping its shape. That's it. That is exactly right. That is exactly

11:58.880 --> 12:04.400
 right. Stay there. It's like getting a bunch of cats or something and trying to organize the shape

12:04.400 --> 12:08.000
 out of them. It's funny. We're on the same page here because in a paper, this is, this is currently

12:08.640 --> 12:12.800
 just been accepted in nature by engineering. One of the figures I have is building a tower

12:12.800 --> 12:17.360
 out of Legos versus dogs, right? So think about the difference, right? If you build out of Legos,

12:17.360 --> 12:22.800
 you have full control over where it's going to go. But if somebody knocks it over, it's game over.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.240
 With the dogs, you cannot just come and stack them. They're not going to stay that way. But

12:26.240 --> 12:29.680
 the good news is that if you train them, then somebody knocks it over, they'll get right back

12:29.680 --> 12:33.760
 up. So it's all right. So as an engineer, what you really want to know is what can they depend

12:33.760 --> 12:37.440
 on this thing to do, right? That's really, you know, a lot of people have definitions of robots

12:37.440 --> 12:41.360
 as far as what they're made of or how they got here, you know, design versus evolve, whatever.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.200
 I don't think any of that is useful. I think, I think as an engineer, what you want to know is

12:45.200 --> 12:49.920
 how much can I depend on this thing to do when I'm not around to micromanage it? What level of,

12:50.960 --> 12:54.400
 what level of dependency can I, can I give this thing? How much agency does it have?

12:54.400 --> 12:57.360
 Which then tells you what techniques do you use? So do you use micromanagement,

12:57.360 --> 13:01.200
 like you put everything where it goes? Do you train it? Do you give it signals? Do you try

13:01.200 --> 13:04.560
 to convince it to do things, right? How much, you know, how intelligent is your substrate?

13:04.560 --> 13:08.480
 And so now we're moving into this, into this area where you're, you're, you're working with

13:08.480 --> 13:12.560
 agential materials. That's a collaboration. That's not, that's not old, old style.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.320
 What's the word you're using? Agential?

13:14.320 --> 13:14.880
 Agential.

13:14.880 --> 13:15.040
 Yeah.

13:15.040 --> 13:15.680
 What's that mean?

13:15.680 --> 13:19.440
 Agency. It comes from the word agency. So, so basically the material has agency, meaning that

13:20.160 --> 13:26.000
 it has some, some level of obviously not human level, but some level of preferences, goals,

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
 memories, ability to remember things, to compute into the future, meaning anticipate,

13:30.640 --> 13:34.800
 you know, when you're working with cells, they have all of that to some, to various degrees.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.920
 Is that empowering or limiting having material as a mind of its own, literally?

13:39.920 --> 13:43.600
 I think it's both, right? So it raises difficulties because it means that

13:43.600 --> 13:48.880
 it, if you, if you're using the old mindset, which is a linear kind of extrapolation of what's going

13:48.880 --> 13:54.320
 to happen, you're going to be surprised and shocked all the time because biology does not

13:54.320 --> 13:59.200
 do what we linearly expect materials to do. On the other hand, it's massively liberating. And

13:59.200 --> 14:04.240
 so in the following way, I've argued that advances in regenerative medicine require us to take

14:04.240 --> 14:09.040
 advantage of this because what it means is that you can get the material to do things that you

14:09.040 --> 14:13.120
 don't know how to micromanage. So just as a simple example, right? If you, if you, you had a rat

14:13.840 --> 14:19.120
 and you wanted this rat to do a circus trick, put a ball in the little hoop, you can do it the

14:19.120 --> 14:22.960
 micromanagement way, which is try to control every neuron and try to play the thing like a puppet,

14:22.960 --> 14:26.960
 right? And maybe someday that'll be possible, maybe, or you can train the rat. And this is

14:26.960 --> 14:31.040
 why humanity for thousands of years before we knew any neuroscience, we had no idea what's

14:31.040 --> 14:35.040
 behind, what's between the ears of any animal. We were able to train these animals because once you

14:35.040 --> 14:40.480
 recognize the level of agency of a certain system, you can use appropriate techniques. If you know

14:40.480 --> 14:44.160
 the currency of motivation, reward and punishment, you know how smart it is, you know what kinds of

14:44.160 --> 14:50.080
 things it likes to do. You are searching a much more, much smoother, much nicer problem space than

14:50.080 --> 14:54.080
 if you try to micromanage the thing. And in regenerative medicine, when you're trying to get,

14:54.080 --> 14:57.920
 let's say an arm to grow back or an eye to repair a cell birth defect or something,

14:57.920 --> 15:02.960
 do you really want to be controlling tens of thousands of genes at each point to try to

15:02.960 --> 15:07.760
 micromanage it? Or do you want to find the high level modular controls that say,

15:07.760 --> 15:11.360
 build an arm here. You already know how to build an arm. You did it before, do it again.

15:11.360 --> 15:15.920
 So that's, I think it's both, it's both difficult and it challenges us to develop new ways of

15:15.920 --> 15:21.760
 engineering and it's hugely empowering. Okay. So how do you do, I mean, maybe sticking with

15:21.760 --> 15:31.120
 the metaphor of dogs and cats, I presume you have to figure out the, find the dogs and dispose of

15:31.120 --> 15:38.400
 the cats. Because, you know, it's like the old herding cats is an issue. So you may be able to

15:38.400 --> 15:44.800
 train dogs. I suspect you will not be able to train cats. Or if you do, you're never going to

15:44.800 --> 15:53.040
 be able to trust them. So is there a way to figure out which material is amenable to herding? Is it in

15:53.040 --> 15:59.360
 the lab work or is it in simulation? Right now it's largely in the lab because we, our simulations

15:59.360 --> 16:04.560
 do not capture yet the most interesting and powerful things about biology. So the simulation

16:04.560 --> 16:10.480
 does, what we're pretty good at simulating are feed forward emergent types of things,

16:10.480 --> 16:15.120
 right? So cellular automata, if you have simple rules and you sort of roll those forward for

16:15.120 --> 16:19.360
 every, every agent or every cell in the simulation, then complex things happen, you know, ant colony

16:19.360 --> 16:23.600
 or algorithms, things like that. We're good at that. And that's, and that's fine. The difficulty

16:23.600 --> 16:28.400
 with all of that is that it's incredibly hard to reverse. So this is a really hard inverse problem,

16:28.400 --> 16:31.520
 right? If you look at a bunch of termites and they make a, you know, a thing with a single chimney

16:31.520 --> 16:36.080
 and you say, well, I like it, but I'd like two chimneys. How do you change the rules of behavior

16:36.080 --> 16:40.320
 free termites? So they make two chimneys, right? Or, or if you say, here are a bunch of cells that are

16:40.320 --> 16:44.720
 creating this kind of organism. I don't think that's optimal. I'd like to repair that birth

16:44.720 --> 16:49.040
 defect. How do you control all the, all the individual low level rules, right? All the protein

16:49.040 --> 16:53.520
 interactions and everything else, rolling it back from the anatomy that you want to the low level

16:53.520 --> 16:57.360
 hardware rules is in general intractable. It's a, it's an inverse problem that's generally not

16:57.360 --> 17:02.960
 solvable. So right now it's mostly in the lab because what we need to do is we need to understand

17:02.960 --> 17:08.320
 how biology uses top down controls. So the idea is not, not bottom up emergence, but the idea of

17:09.520 --> 17:14.560
 things like a goal directed test operate exit kinds of loops where, where it's basically an

17:14.560 --> 17:19.120
 error minimization function over a new space and not a space of gene expression, but for example,

17:19.120 --> 17:23.760
 a space of anatomy. So just as a simple example, if you have, you have a salamander and it's got

17:23.760 --> 17:29.040
 an arm, you can, you can amputate that arm anywhere along the length. It will grow exactly

17:29.040 --> 17:32.880
 what's needed and then it stops. That's the most amazing thing about regeneration is that it stops

17:32.880 --> 17:37.280
 it knows when to stop. When does it stop? It stops when a correct salamander arm has been completed.

17:37.280 --> 17:42.880
 So that tells you that's right. That's a, that's a, a means ends kind of analysis where it has to

17:42.880 --> 17:47.280
 know what the correct limb is supposed to look like, right? So it has a way to ascertain the

17:47.280 --> 17:51.360
 current shape. It has a way to measure that Delta from, from what shape it's supposed to be. And it

17:51.360 --> 17:55.600
 will keep taking actions, meaning remodeling and growing and everything else until that's complete.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.200
 So once you know that, and we've taken advantage of this in the lab to do some, some really wild

17:59.200 --> 18:04.400
 things with, with both planaria and frog embryos and so on, once you know that, you can start

18:04.400 --> 18:08.880
 playing with that, with that homeostatic cycle. You can ask, for example, well, how does it remember

18:08.880 --> 18:12.240
 what the correct shape is? And can we mess with that memory? Can we give it a false memory of

18:12.240 --> 18:16.160
 what the shape should be and let the cells build something else? Or can we mess with the measurement

18:16.160 --> 18:20.800
 apparatus, right? So it gives you, it gives you those kinds of, so, so, so the idea is to

18:21.680 --> 18:28.240
 basically appropriate a lot of the approaches and concepts from cognitive neuroscience and

18:28.240 --> 18:33.600
 behavioral science into things that previously were taken to be dumb materials. And, you know,

18:33.600 --> 18:37.440
 you get yelled at in class if you, if you, for being anthropomorphic, if you said, well, my cells

18:37.440 --> 18:41.280
 want to do this and my cells want to do that. And I think, I think that's a, that's a major mistake

18:41.280 --> 18:45.920
 that leaves a ton of capabilities on the table. So thinking about biologic systems as things that

18:45.920 --> 18:56.560
 have memory, have almost something like cognitive ability, but I mean, how incredible is it,

18:56.560 --> 19:03.600
 you know, that the salamander arm is being rebuilt, not with a dictator. It's kind of like

19:03.600 --> 19:08.880
 the cellular automata system. All the individual workers are doing their own thing. So where's that

19:10.320 --> 19:16.080
 top down signal that does the control coming from? Like, how can you find it? Like, why does it stop

19:16.080 --> 19:21.120
 growing? How does it know the shape? How does it have memory of the shape? And how does it tell

19:21.120 --> 19:26.080
 everybody to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, we're done. So the first thing to think about,

19:26.080 --> 19:33.680
 I think, is that there are no examples anywhere of a central dictator, because in this kind of

19:33.680 --> 19:40.480
 science, because everything is made of parts. And so we, even though we feel as a unified central

19:40.480 --> 19:45.840
 sort of intelligence and kind of point of cognition, we are a bag of neurons, right?

19:45.840 --> 19:49.760
 All intelligence is collective intelligence. There's this, this is important to kind of

19:50.720 --> 19:54.560
 think about, because a lot of people think, okay, there's real intelligence, like me,

19:54.560 --> 19:59.280
 and then there's collective intelligence, which is ants and flocks of birds and termites and

19:59.280 --> 20:05.520
 things like that. And maybe it's appropriate to think of them as an individual, and maybe it's

20:05.520 --> 20:09.520
 not, and a lot of people are skeptical about that and so on. But you've got to realize that

20:09.520 --> 20:13.760
 we are not, there's no such thing as this like indivisible diamond of intelligence that's like

20:13.760 --> 20:19.600
 this one central thing that's not made of parts. We are all made of parts. And so if you believe,

20:19.600 --> 20:25.520
 which I think is hard to get around, that we in fact have a centralized set of goals and

20:25.520 --> 20:30.240
 preferences and we plan and we do things and so on, you are already committed to the fact that

20:30.240 --> 20:34.000
 a collection of cells is able to do this, because we are a collection of cells. There's no getting

20:34.000 --> 20:37.920
 around that. In our case, what we do is we navigate the three dimensional world and we

20:37.920 --> 20:41.840
 have behavior. This is blowing my mind right now, because we are just a collection of cells.

20:41.840 --> 20:50.560
 Oh yeah. So when I'm moving this arm, I feel like I'm the central dictator of that action,

20:50.560 --> 20:57.840
 but there's a lot of stuff going on. All the cells here are collaborating in some interesting way.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.880
 They're getting signal from the central nervous system.

21:00.880 --> 21:05.600
 Well, even the central nervous system is misleadingly named because it isn't really

21:05.600 --> 21:10.800
 central. Again, it's just a bunch of cells. I mean, all of them, right? There are no,

21:10.800 --> 21:16.240
 there are no singular indivisible intelligences anywhere. We are all, every example that we've

21:16.240 --> 21:21.040
 ever seen is a collective of something. It's just that we're used to it. We're used to that. We're

21:21.040 --> 21:24.080
 used to, okay, this thing is kind of a single thing, but it's really not. You zoom in, you know

21:24.080 --> 21:29.360
 what you see. You see a bunch of cells running around. Is there some unifying, I mean, we're

21:29.360 --> 21:36.000
 jumping around, but that something that you look at as the bioelectrical signal versus the

21:36.000 --> 21:46.880
 biochemical, the chemistry, the electricity, maybe the life is in that versus the cells.

21:47.680 --> 21:56.400
 It's the, there's an orchestra playing and the resulting music is the dictator.

21:57.120 --> 22:02.560
 That's not bad. That's Dennis Noble's kind of view of things. He has two really good books

22:02.560 --> 22:07.360
 where he talks about this musical analogy, right? So I think that's, I like it. I like it.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.640
 Is it wrong though?

22:08.640 --> 22:13.600
 I don't think it's, no, I don't think it's wrong. I don't think it's wrong. I think the important

22:13.600 --> 22:23.040
 thing about it is that we have to come to grips with the fact that a true proper cognitive

22:23.040 --> 22:27.920
 intelligence can still be made of parts. Those things are, and in fact it has to be, and I think

22:27.920 --> 22:32.800
 it's a real shame, but I see this all the time. When you have a collective like this, whether it

22:32.800 --> 22:40.880
 be a group of robots or a collection of cells or neurons or whatever, as soon as we gain some

22:40.880 --> 22:45.360
 insight into how it works, meaning that, oh, I see, in order to take this action, here's the

22:45.360 --> 22:50.320
 information that got processed via this chemical mechanism or whatever. Immediately people say,

22:50.320 --> 22:54.880
 oh, well then that's not real cognition. That's just physics. I think this is fundamentally

22:54.880 --> 22:58.720
 flawed because if you zoom into anything, what are you going to see? Of course you're just going to

22:58.720 --> 23:01.680
 see physics. What else could be underneath, right? It's not going to be fairy dust. It's going to be

23:01.680 --> 23:05.920
 physics and chemistry, but that doesn't take away from the magic of the fact that there are certain

23:05.920 --> 23:10.320
 ways to arrange that physics and chemistry and in particular the bioelectricity, which I like a lot,

23:11.440 --> 23:18.640
 to give you an emergent collective with goals and preferences and memories and anticipations

23:18.640 --> 23:22.160
 that do not belong to any of the subunits. So I think what we're getting into here,

23:22.160 --> 23:26.640
 and we can talk about how this happens during embryogenesis and so on, what we're getting into

23:26.640 --> 23:33.360
 is the origin of a self with a capital S. So we ourselves, there are many other kinds of

23:33.360 --> 23:37.120
 selves, and we can tell some really interesting stories about where selves come from and how they

23:37.120 --> 23:42.240
 become unified. Yeah, is this the first, or at least humans tend to think that this is the

23:42.880 --> 23:49.440
 level of which the self with a capital S is first born, and we really don't want to see

23:49.440 --> 23:54.720
 human civilization or Earth itself as one living organism. Yeah, that's very uncomfortable to us.

23:54.720 --> 24:01.200
 It is, yeah. But is, yeah, where's the self born? We have to grow up past that. So what I like to do

24:01.200 --> 24:06.560
 is, I'll tell you two quick stories about that. I like to roll backwards. So as opposed to, so if

24:06.560 --> 24:10.560
 you start and you say, okay, here's a paramecium, and you see it, you know, it's a single cell

24:10.560 --> 24:14.320
 organism, you see it doing various things, and people will say, okay, I'm sure there's some

24:14.320 --> 24:18.160
 chemical story to be told about how it's doing it, so that's not a paramecium.

24:18.160 --> 24:23.360
 So that's not true cognition, right? And people will argue about that. I like to work it backwards.

24:23.360 --> 24:28.880
 I say, let's agree that you and I, as we sit here, are examples of true cognition, if anything,

24:28.880 --> 24:32.960
 as if there's anything that's true cognition, we are examples of it. Now let's just roll back

24:32.960 --> 24:36.800
 slowly, right? So you roll back to the time when you were a small child and used to doing whatever,

24:36.800 --> 24:41.280
 and then just sort of day by day, you roll back, and eventually you become more or less that

24:41.280 --> 24:46.560
 paramecium, and then you sort of even below that, right, as an unfertilized OSI. So

24:46.560 --> 24:53.840
 it's, no one has, to my knowledge, no one has come up with any convincing discrete step at which

24:53.840 --> 24:59.040
 my cognitive powers disappear, right? It just doesn't, the biology doesn't offer any specific

24:59.040 --> 25:04.000
 step. It's incredibly smooth and slow and continuous. And so I think this idea that it just

25:04.000 --> 25:10.080
 sort of magically shows up at one point, and then, you know, humans have true selves that don't exist

25:10.080 --> 25:13.840
 elsewhere, I think it runs against everything we know about evolution, everything we know about

25:13.840 --> 25:18.400
 developmental biology, these are all slow continua. And the other really important story I

25:18.400 --> 25:23.280
 want to tell is where embryos come from. So think about this for a second. Amniote embryos, so this

25:23.280 --> 25:29.200
 is humans, birds, and so on, mammals and birds and so on. Imagine a flat disk of cells, so there's

25:29.200 --> 25:35.120
 maybe 50,000 cells. And in that, so when you get an egg from a fertilized, let's say you buy a

25:35.120 --> 25:42.560
 fertilized egg from a farm, right? That egg will have about 50,000 cells in a flat disk, it looks

25:42.560 --> 25:50.080
 like a little tiny little frisbee. And in that flat disk, what'll happen is there'll be one set

25:50.080 --> 25:56.000
 of cells will become special, and it will tell all the other cells, I'm going to be the head,

25:56.000 --> 26:00.160
 you guys don't be the head. And so it'll amplify symmetry breaking amplification, you get one

26:00.160 --> 26:06.320
 embryo, there's some neural tissue and some other stuff forms. Now, you say, okay, I had one egg

26:06.320 --> 26:10.880
 and one embryo, and there you go, what else could it be? Well, the reality is, and I used to, I did

26:10.880 --> 26:16.400
 all of this as a grad student, if you take a little needle, and you make a scratch in that

26:16.400 --> 26:20.720
 blastoderm in that disk, such that the cells can't talk to each other for a while, it heals up, but

26:20.720 --> 26:26.240
 for a while, they can't talk to each other. What will happen is that both regions will decide that

26:26.240 --> 26:29.120
 they can be the embryo, and there will be two of them. And then when they heal up, they become

26:29.120 --> 26:33.920
 conjoint twins, and you can make two, you can make three, you can make lots. So the question of how

26:33.920 --> 26:40.720
 many cells are in there cannot be answered until it's actually played all the way through. It isn't

26:40.720 --> 26:44.320
 necessarily that there's just one, there can be many. So what you have is you have this medium,

26:44.320 --> 26:49.280
 this, this undifferentiated, I'm sure there's a there's a psychological version of this somewhere

26:49.280 --> 26:53.280
 that I don't know the proper terminology. But you have this, you have this list, like the ocean of

26:53.280 --> 26:58.960
 potentiality, you have these 1000s of cells, and some number of individuals are going to be formed

26:58.960 --> 27:05.040
 out of it, usually one, sometimes zero, sometimes several. And they form out of these cells,

27:05.040 --> 27:10.880
 because a region of these cells organizes into a collective that will have goals, goals that

27:10.880 --> 27:15.680
 individual cells don't have, for example, make a limb, make an eye, how many eyes? Well, exactly

27:15.680 --> 27:19.120
 two. So individual cells don't know what an eye is, they don't know how many eyes you're supposed

27:19.120 --> 27:23.360
 to have, but the collective does. The collective has goals and memories and anticipations that the

27:23.360 --> 27:27.440
 individual cells don't. And that that the establishment of that boundary with its own

27:27.440 --> 27:32.960
 ability to maintain to to pursue certain goals. That's the origin of selfhood.

27:33.920 --> 27:42.800
 But I, is that goal in there somewhere? Were they always destined? Like, are they discovering

27:42.800 --> 27:49.360
 that goal? Like, where the hell did evolution discover this when you went from the prokaryotes

27:49.360 --> 27:55.600
 to eukaryotic cells? And then they started making groups. And when you make a certain group,

27:55.600 --> 28:03.600
 you make a, you make it sound, and it's such a tricky thing to try to understand, you make it

28:03.600 --> 28:09.680
 sound like this cells didn't get together and came up with a goal. But the very act of them

28:09.680 --> 28:16.880
 getting together revealed the goal that was always there. There was always that potential

28:16.880 --> 28:20.880
 for that goal. So the first thing to say is that there are way more questions here than

28:20.880 --> 28:25.680
 certainties. Okay, so everything I'm telling you is cutting edge developing, you know, stuff. So

28:25.680 --> 28:29.520
 it's not as if any of us know the answer to this. But, but here's, here's, here's my opinion on

28:29.520 --> 28:36.000
 this. I think what evolution, I don't think that evolution produces solutions to specific problems,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.680
 in other words, specific environments, like here's a frog that can live well in a froggy

28:39.680 --> 28:46.000
 environment. I think what evolution produces is problem solving machines that that will that will

28:46.000 --> 28:50.320
 solve problems in different spaces. So not just three dimensional spaces, but in a way,

28:50.320 --> 28:55.120
 three dimensional space. This goes back to what we were talking about before we the brain is a

28:55.120 --> 29:01.360
 evolutionarily a late development. It's a system that is able to net to pursue goals in three

29:01.360 --> 29:05.040
 dimensional space by giving commands to muscles, where did that system come from that system

29:05.040 --> 29:10.000
 evolved from a much more ancient, evolutionarily much more ancient system, where collections of

29:10.000 --> 29:18.320
 cells gave instructions to for cell behaviors, meaning cells move to divide to die to change into

29:18.320 --> 29:23.440
 cells to navigate more for space, the space of anatomies, the space of all possible anatomies.

29:23.440 --> 29:27.520
 And before that, cells were navigating transcriptional space, which is a space of all

29:27.520 --> 29:31.840
 possible gene expressions. And before that metabolic space. So what evolution has done,

29:31.840 --> 29:38.720
 I think, is is is is produced hardware that is very good at navigating different spaces using a

29:38.720 --> 29:42.560
 bag of tricks, right, which which I'm sure many of them we can steal for autonomous vehicles and

29:42.560 --> 29:47.840
 robotics and various things. And what happens is that they navigate these spaces without a whole

29:47.840 --> 29:51.520
 lot of commitment to what the space is. In fact, they don't know what the space is, right? We are

29:51.520 --> 29:57.280
 all brains in a vat, so to speak. Every cell does not know, right? Every cell is some other name,

29:57.280 --> 30:02.160
 some other cells external environment, right? So where does that with that border between you,

30:02.160 --> 30:05.680
 you and the outside world, you don't really know where that is, right? Every every collection of

30:05.680 --> 30:10.880
 cell has to figure that out from scratch. And the fact that evolution requires all of these things

30:10.880 --> 30:15.520
 to figure out what they are, what effectors they have, what sensors they have, where does it make

30:15.520 --> 30:18.960
 sense to draw a boundary between me and the outside world? The fact that you have to build all

30:18.960 --> 30:25.680
 that from scratch, this autopoiesis is what defines the border of a self. Now, biology uses like a

30:26.320 --> 30:31.760
 multi a multi scale competency architecture, meaning that every level has goals. So so

30:31.760 --> 30:38.160
 molecular networks have goals, cells have goals, tissues, organs, colonies. And and it's the

30:38.160 --> 30:43.280
 interplay of all of those that that enable biology to solve problems in new ways, for example, in

30:43.280 --> 30:50.640
 xenobots and various other things. This is, you know, it's exactly as you said, in many ways,

30:50.640 --> 30:56.080
 the cells are discovering new ways of being. But at the same time, evolution certainly shapes all

30:56.080 --> 31:01.120
 this. So so evolution is very good at this agential bioengineering, right? When evolution

31:01.680 --> 31:05.200
 is discovering a new way of being an animal, you know, an animal or a plant or something,

31:06.000 --> 31:10.160
 sometimes it's by changing the hardware, you know, protein, changing proteins, protein structure,

31:10.160 --> 31:14.160
 and so on. But much of the time, it's not by changing the hardware, it's by changing the

31:14.160 --> 31:17.840
 signals that the cells give to each other. It's doing what we as engineers do, which is try to

31:17.840 --> 31:22.640
 convince the cells to do various things by using signals, experiences, stimuli. That's what biology

31:22.640 --> 31:27.360
 does. It has to, because it's not dealing with a blank slate. Every time as you know, if you're

31:27.360 --> 31:32.960
 evolution, and you're trying to make make a make an organism, you're not dealing with a passive

31:32.960 --> 31:37.760
 material that is fresh, and you have to specify it already wants to do certain things. So the easiest

31:37.760 --> 31:42.560
 way to do that search to find whatever is going to be adaptive, is to find the signals that are

31:42.560 --> 31:48.480
 going to convince cells to do various things, right? Your sense is that evolution operates

31:48.480 --> 31:54.000
 both in the software and the hardware. And it's just easier, more efficient to operate in the

31:54.000 --> 31:58.800
 software. Yes. And I should also say, I don't think the distinction is sharp. In other words,

31:58.800 --> 32:03.120
 I think it's a continuum. But I think we can but I think it's a meaningful distinction where you can

32:03.120 --> 32:08.480
 make changes to a particular protein, and now the enzymatic function is different, and it metabolizes

32:08.480 --> 32:14.080
 differently, and whatever, and that will have implications for fitness. Or you can change the

32:14.080 --> 32:20.480
 huge amount of information in the genome that isn't structural at all. It's, it's, it's signaling,

32:20.480 --> 32:25.120
 it's when and how do cells say certain things to each other. And that can have massive changes,

32:25.120 --> 32:29.120
 as far as how it's going to solve problems. I mean, this idea of multi hierarchical

32:29.120 --> 32:35.760
 competence architecture, which is incredible to think about. So this hierarchy that evolution

32:35.760 --> 32:43.120
 builds, I don't know who's responsible for this. I also see the incompetence of bureaucracies

32:43.840 --> 32:52.320
 of humans when they get together. So how the hell does evolution build this, where at every level,

32:53.200 --> 32:57.360
 only the best get to stick around, they somehow figure out how to do their job without knowing

32:57.360 --> 33:04.160
 the bigger picture. And then there's like the bosses that do the bigger thing somehow, or that

33:04.160 --> 33:11.040
 you can now abstract away the small group of cells as a as an organ or something. And then

33:11.040 --> 33:16.640
 that organ does something bigger in the context of the full body or something like this.

33:17.920 --> 33:23.680
 How is that built? Is there some intuition you can kind of provide of how that's constructed,

33:23.680 --> 33:29.680
 that that hierarchical competence architecture? I love that competence,

33:29.680 --> 33:33.280
 just the word competence is pretty cool in this context, because everybody's good at their job.

33:34.080 --> 33:39.280
 Yeah, no, it's really key. And the other nice thing about competency is that so my central

33:39.280 --> 33:43.840
 belief in all of this is that engineering is the right perspective on all of this stuff,

33:43.840 --> 33:50.480
 because it gets you away from subjective terms. You know, people talk about sentience and this

33:50.480 --> 33:54.880
 and that those things very hard to define, or people argue about them philosophically.

33:54.880 --> 34:02.080
 I think that engineering terms like competency, like, you know, pursuit of goals, right? All of

34:02.080 --> 34:06.400
 these things are, are empirically incredibly useful, because you know, when you see it,

34:06.400 --> 34:11.920
 and if it helps you build, right, if I if I can pick the right level, I say, this thing has,

34:11.920 --> 34:17.200
 I believe this is x level of like, competency, I think it's like a thermostat, or I think it's

34:17.200 --> 34:22.800
 like a better thermostat, or I think it's a, you know, various other kinds of, you know,

34:22.800 --> 34:28.000
 many, many different kinds of complex systems. If that helps me to control and predict and build

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
 such systems, then that's all there is to say, there's no more philosophy to argue about. So I

34:32.000 --> 34:35.120
 like competency in that way, because you can quantify, you could, you have to, in fact, you

34:35.120 --> 34:38.640
 have to, you have to make a claim competent at what? And then, or if I say, if I tell you,

34:38.640 --> 34:42.400
 it has a goal, the question is, what's the goal? And how do you know? And I say, well, because

34:42.400 --> 34:46.320
 every time I deviated from this particular state, that's what it spends energy to get back to,

34:46.320 --> 34:51.920
 that's the goal. And we can quantify it, and we can be objective about it. So so so the the,

34:51.920 --> 34:56.000
 we're not used to thinking about this, I give a talk sometimes called Why don't robots get cancer,

34:56.000 --> 35:00.160
 right? And the reason robots don't get cancer is because generally speaking, with a few exceptions,

35:00.160 --> 35:05.280
 our architectures have been, you've got a bunch of dumb parts. And you hope that if you put them

35:05.280 --> 35:09.520
 together, the the the overlying machine will have some intelligence and do something rather,

35:09.520 --> 35:13.280
 right, but the individual parts don't don't care, they don't have an agenda. Biology isn't like

35:13.280 --> 35:20.560
 that every level has an agenda. And the final outcome is the result of cooperation and competition,

35:20.560 --> 35:25.360
 both within and across levels. So for example, during embryogenesis, your tissues and organs are

35:25.360 --> 35:28.800
 competing with each other. And it's actually a really important part of development, there's a

35:28.800 --> 35:33.440
 reason they compete with each other, they're not all just, you know, sort of helping each other,

35:33.440 --> 35:38.560
 they're also competing for information for metabolic for limited metabolic constraints.

35:38.560 --> 35:43.440
 But to get back to your your other point, which is, you know, which is which is the seems like

35:43.440 --> 35:48.800
 really efficient and good and so on compared to some of our human efforts. We also have to keep

35:48.800 --> 35:56.320
 in mind that what happens here is that each level bends the option space for the level beneath so

35:56.320 --> 36:03.920
 that your parts basically they don't see the the geometry. So I'm using them. And I think I take

36:03.920 --> 36:10.160
 I take this the seriously terminology from from like, from like relativity, right, where the space

36:10.160 --> 36:15.120
 is literally bent. So the option space is deformed by the higher level so that the lower levels, all

36:15.120 --> 36:18.000
 they really have to do is go down their concentration gradient, they don't have to,

36:18.000 --> 36:22.320
 in fact, they don't, they can't know what the big picture is. But if you bend the space just right,

36:22.320 --> 36:26.720
 if they do what locally seems right, they end up doing your bidding, they end up doing things that

36:26.720 --> 36:33.840
 are optimal in the in the higher space. Conversely, because the components are good at getting their

36:33.840 --> 36:38.880
 job done, you as the higher level don't need to try to compute all the low level controls,

36:38.880 --> 36:42.160
 all you're doing is bending the space, you don't know or care how they're going to do it.

36:42.160 --> 36:47.680
 Give you a super simple example in the in the tappel, we found that okay, so so tappels need

36:47.680 --> 36:51.600
 to become frogs and to become to go from a tappel head to a frog head, you have to rearrange the

36:51.600 --> 36:55.200
 face. So the eyes have to move forward, the jaws have to come out the nostrils move like everything

36:55.200 --> 36:59.840
 moves. It used to be thought that because all tappels look the same, and all frogs look the

36:59.840 --> 37:03.200
 same. If you just remember, if every piece just moves in the right direction, the right amount,

37:03.200 --> 37:08.000
 then you get your you get your fraud. Right. So we decided to test we I have this hypothesis that I

37:08.000 --> 37:11.600
 thought I thought actually, the system is probably more intelligent than that. So what did we do?

37:11.600 --> 37:15.920
 We made what we call Picasso tappels. So these are so everything is scrambled. So the eyes are on the

37:15.920 --> 37:18.960
 back of the head, the jaws are off to the side, everything is scrambled. Well, guess what they

37:18.960 --> 37:23.600
 make, they make pretty normal frogs, because all the different things move around in novel

37:23.600 --> 37:28.240
 paths configurations until they get to the correct froggy sort of frog face configuration,

37:28.240 --> 37:34.080
 then they stop. So, so the thing about that is now imagine evolution, right? So, so you make some

37:34.080 --> 37:40.560
 sort of mutation, and it does, like every mutation, it does many things. So something good comes of it,

37:40.560 --> 37:46.160
 but also it moves your mouth off to the side, right? Now, if if there wasn't this multi scale

37:46.160 --> 37:49.360
 competency, you can see where this is going, if there wasn't this multi scale competency,

37:49.360 --> 37:53.200
 the organism would be dead, your fitness is zero, because you can't eat. And you would never get to

37:53.200 --> 37:57.680
 explore the other beneficial consequences of that mutation, you'd have to wait until you find some

37:57.680 --> 38:01.840
 other way of doing it without moving the mouth, that's really hard. So, so the fitness landscape

38:01.840 --> 38:06.320
 would be incredibly rugged evolution would take forever. The reason it works, one of the reasons

38:06.320 --> 38:11.360
 it works so well, is because you do that, no worries, the mouth will find its way where where

38:11.360 --> 38:15.680
 it belongs, right? So now you get to explore. So what that means is that all of these mutations

38:15.680 --> 38:20.320
 that otherwise would be deleterious are now neutral, because the competency of the parts

38:21.280 --> 38:26.480
 make up for all kinds of things. So all the noise of development, all the variability in the

38:26.480 --> 38:32.080
 environment, all these things, the competency of the parts makes up for it. So the so so that's

38:32.080 --> 38:36.080
 all that's all fantastic, right? That's all that's all great. The only other thing to remember when

38:36.080 --> 38:41.040
 we compare this to human efforts is this. Every component has its own goals in various spaces,

38:41.040 --> 38:46.560
 usually with very little regard for the welfare of the other levels. So so as a simple example,

38:46.560 --> 38:52.000
 you know, you as a as a complex system, you will go out and you will do you know, jiu jitsu,

38:52.000 --> 38:55.520
 or whatever, you'll have some go you have to go rock climbing, scrape a bunch of cells off your

38:55.520 --> 38:59.680
 hands. And then you're happy as a system, right? You come back, and you've accomplished some goals,

38:59.680 --> 39:03.120
 and you're really happy. Those cells are dead. They're gone. Right? Did you think about those

39:03.120 --> 39:08.640
 cells? Not really, right? You had some you had some bruising out selfish SOB. That's it. And so

39:08.640 --> 39:13.760
 and so that's the thing to remember is that, you know, and we know this from from history is that

39:13.760 --> 39:19.520
 is that just being a collective isn't enough. Because what the goals of that collective will

39:19.520 --> 39:24.560
 be relative to the welfare of the individual parts is a massively open and justify the means

39:24.560 --> 39:29.600
 I'm telling you, Stalin was onto something. No, that's the danger. But we can exactly that's the

39:29.600 --> 39:39.040
 danger of for us humans, we have to construct ethical systems under which we don't take seriously

39:39.760 --> 39:43.840
 the full mechanism of biology and apply it to the way the world functions,

39:43.840 --> 39:51.680
 which is which is an interesting line we've drawn. The world that built us is the one we

39:51.680 --> 39:59.120
 reject in some sense, when we construct human societies, the idea that this country was founded

39:59.120 --> 40:05.440
 on that all men are created equal. That's such a fascinating idea. That's like, you're fighting

40:05.440 --> 40:14.640
 against nature and saying, well, there's something bigger here than a hierarchical competency

40:14.640 --> 40:21.920
 architecture. But there's so many interesting things you said. So from an algorithmic perspective,

40:21.920 --> 40:29.840
 the act of bending the option space. That's really, that's really profound. Because if you

40:29.840 --> 40:36.800
 look at the way AI systems are built today, there's a big system, like I said, with robots,

40:36.800 --> 40:42.080
 and as a goal, and he gets better and better at optimizing that goal at accomplishing that goal.

40:42.080 --> 40:48.560
 But if biology built a hierarchical system where everything is doing computation,

40:49.360 --> 40:54.640
 and everything is accomplishing the goal, not only that, it's kind of dumb,

40:56.400 --> 41:03.360
 you know, with the limited with a bent option space is just doing the thing that's the easiest

41:03.360 --> 41:10.960
 thing for in some sense. And somehow that allows you to have turtles on top of turtles,

41:10.960 --> 41:17.920
 literally dumb systems on top of dumb systems that as a whole create something incredibly smart.

41:18.480 --> 41:24.560
 Yeah, I mean, every system is has some degree of intelligence in its own problem domain. So,

41:25.200 --> 41:30.400
 so cells will have problems they're trying to solve in physiological space and transcriptional

41:30.400 --> 41:34.240
 space. And then I can give you some some cool examples of that. But the collective is trying

41:34.240 --> 41:38.800
 to solve problems in anatomical space, right and forming a, you know, a creature and growing your

41:38.800 --> 41:44.480
 blood vessels and so on. And then the collective the the the whole body is solving yet other

41:44.480 --> 41:48.080
 problems, they may be in social space and linguistic space and three dimensional space.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.080
 And who knows, you know, the group might be solving problems in, you know, I don't know,

41:52.080 --> 41:57.840
 some sort of financial space or something. So one of the major differences with with most,

41:59.280 --> 42:06.160
 with most AIs today is is a the kind of flatness of the architecture, but also of the fact that

42:06.160 --> 42:13.360
 they're constructed from outside their their borders, and they're, you know, so a few. So,

42:14.400 --> 42:18.640
 to a large extent, and of course, there are counter examples now, but but to a large extent,

42:18.640 --> 42:23.760
 our technology has been such that you create a machine or a robot, it knows what its sensors are,

42:23.760 --> 42:27.760
 it knows what its effectors are, it knows the boundary between it and the outside world,

42:27.760 --> 42:32.800
 although this is given from the outside. Biology constructs this from scratch. Now the best example

42:32.800 --> 42:38.880
 of this that that originally in robotics was actually Josh Bongard's work in 2006, where he

42:38.880 --> 42:43.120
 made these, these robots that did not know their shape to start with. So like a baby, they sort of

42:43.120 --> 42:47.040
 floundered around, they made some hypotheses, well, I did this, and I moved in this way. Well,

42:47.040 --> 42:50.800
 maybe I'm a whatever, maybe I have wheels, or maybe I have six legs or whatever, right? And

42:50.800 --> 42:54.240
 they would make a model and eventually will crawl around. So that's, I mean, that's really good.

42:54.240 --> 42:58.160
 That's part of the autopoiesis, but we can go a step further. And some people are doing this. And

42:58.160 --> 43:02.960
 then we're sort of working on some of this too, is this idea that let's even go back further,

43:02.960 --> 43:06.640
 you don't even know what sensors you have, you don't know where you end in the outside world

43:06.640 --> 43:11.200
 begins. All you have is is certain things like active inference, meaning you're trying to minimize

43:11.200 --> 43:14.880
 surprise, right? You have some metabolic constraints, you don't have all the energy you

43:14.880 --> 43:18.640
 need, you don't have all the time in the world to think about everything you want to think about. So

43:18.640 --> 43:23.280
 that means that you can't afford to be a micro reductionist, you know, all this data coming in,

43:23.280 --> 43:26.560
 you have to course grain it and say, I'm gonna take all this stuff, and I'm gonna call that a

43:26.560 --> 43:30.560
 cat. I'm gonna take all this, I'm gonna call that the edge of the table I don't want to fall off of.

43:30.560 --> 43:34.480
 And I don't want to know anything about the micro states, what I want to know is what is the optimal

43:34.480 --> 43:38.560
 way to cut up my world. And by the way, this thing over here, that's me. And the reason that's me is

43:38.560 --> 43:42.640
 because I have more control over this than I have over any of this other stuff. And so now you can

43:42.640 --> 43:46.560
 begin to write. So that's self construction at that, that figuring out making models of the

43:46.560 --> 43:51.120
 outside world, and then turning that inwards, and starting to make a model of yourself, right, which

43:51.120 --> 43:58.560
 immediately starts to get into issues of agency and control. Because in order to if you are under

43:58.560 --> 44:02.240
 metabolic constraints, meaning you don't have the energy, right, that all the energy in the world,

44:02.240 --> 44:08.000
 you have to be efficient, that immediately forces you to start telling stories about coarse grained

44:08.000 --> 44:11.840
 agents that do things, right, you don't have the energy to like Laplace's demon, you know,

44:11.840 --> 44:17.360
 calculate every, every possible state that's going to happen, you have to you have to course grain,

44:17.360 --> 44:21.920
 and you have to say, that is the kind of creature that does things, either things that I avoid,

44:21.920 --> 44:25.280
 or things that I will go towards, that's a major food or whatever, whatever it's going to be.

44:25.280 --> 44:30.560
 And so right at the base of simple, very simple organisms starting to make

44:31.920 --> 44:39.040
 models of agents doing things, that is the origin of models of free will, basically, right, because

44:39.040 --> 44:42.880
 you see the world around you as having agency. And then you turn that on yourself. And you say,

44:42.880 --> 44:47.440
 wait, I have agency too, I can I do things, right. And and then you make decisions about what you're

44:47.440 --> 44:52.640
 going to do. So all of this one one model is to view all of those kinds of things as

44:53.920 --> 44:59.600
 being driven by that early need to determine what you are and to do so and to then take

44:59.600 --> 45:04.800
 actions in the most energetically efficient space possible. Right. So free will emerges

45:04.800 --> 45:10.000
 when you try to simplify, tell a nice narrative about your environment. I think that's very

45:10.000 --> 45:18.080
 plausible. Yeah. You think free was an illusion. So you're kind of implying that it's a useful hack.

45:19.360 --> 45:23.680
 Well, I'll say two things. The first thing is, I think I think it's very plausible to say that

45:24.320 --> 45:30.560
 any organism that self or any agent that self whether it's biological or not, any agent that

45:30.560 --> 45:36.960
 self constructs under energy constraints, is going to believe in free will, we'll get to whether it

45:36.960 --> 45:41.200
 has free will momentarily. But but I think but I think what what it definitely drives is a view of

45:41.200 --> 45:45.360
 yourself and the outside world as an agential view, I think that's inescapable. So that's true

45:45.360 --> 45:50.480
 for even primitive organisms? I think so. I think that's now now they don't have now obviously,

45:50.480 --> 45:55.360
 you have to scale down, right. So so so so they don't have the kinds of complex metacognition

45:55.360 --> 45:59.520
 that we have. So they can do long term planning and thinking about free will and so on and so on.

45:59.520 --> 46:05.040
 But but the sense of agency is really useful to accomplish tasks simple or complicated. That's

46:05.040 --> 46:09.680
 right. In all kinds of spaces, not just in obvious three dimensional space. I mean, we're very good

46:09.680 --> 46:16.720
 that the thing is, humans are very good at detecting agency of like medium sized objects

46:16.720 --> 46:20.560
 moving at medium speeds in the three dimensional world, right? We see a bowling ball and we see a

46:20.560 --> 46:23.920
 mouse and we immediately know what the difference is, right? And how we're going to mostly things

46:23.920 --> 46:28.400
 you can eat or get eaten by. Yeah, yeah. That's our that's our training set, right? From the time

46:28.400 --> 46:33.120
 you're little, your training set is visual data on on this this like little chunk of your experience.

46:33.120 --> 46:39.120
 But imagine if imagine if from the time that we were born, we had innate senses of your blood

46:39.120 --> 46:42.960
 chemistry, if you could feel your blood chemistry, the way you can see, right, you had a high bandwidth

46:42.960 --> 46:46.640
 connection, and you could feel your blood chemistry, and you could see, you could sense all

46:46.640 --> 46:51.040
 the things that your organs were doing. So your pancreas, your liver, all the things. If we had

46:51.040 --> 46:55.760
 that you we would be very good at detecting intelligence and physiological space, we would

46:55.760 --> 47:00.320
 know the level of intelligence that our various organs were deploying to deal with things that

47:00.320 --> 47:04.400
 were coming to anticipate the stimuli to, you know, but but we're just terrible at that. We

47:04.400 --> 47:07.920
 don't, in fact, in fact, people don't even, you know, you talk about intelligence that these are

47:07.920 --> 47:12.160
 the paper spaces. And a lot of people think that's just crazy, because, because all we're all we know

47:12.160 --> 47:18.880
 is motion. We do have access to that information. So it's actually possible that so evolution could

47:18.880 --> 47:24.400
 if we wanted to construct an organism that's able to perceive the flow of blood through your body,

47:24.400 --> 47:32.560
 the way you see an old friend and say, yo, what's up? How's the wife and the kids? In that same way,

47:32.560 --> 47:37.920
 you would see that you would feel like a connection to the liver. Yeah, yeah, I think,

47:37.920 --> 47:41.680
 you know, maybe other people's liver and not just your own, because you don't have access to other

47:41.680 --> 47:46.160
 people's. Not yet. But you could imagine some really interesting connection, right? But like

47:46.160 --> 47:52.800
 sexual selection, like, oh, that girl's got a nice liver. Well, that's like, the way her blood flows,

47:52.800 --> 47:58.320
 the dynamics of the blood is very interesting. It's novel. I've never seen one of those.

47:58.320 --> 48:03.920
 But you know, that's exactly what we're trying to half ass when we, when we judge judgment of

48:03.920 --> 48:09.120
 beauty by facial symmetry and so on. That's a half assed assessment of exactly that. Because

48:09.120 --> 48:13.760
 if your cells could not cooperate enough to keep your organism symmetrical, you know,

48:13.760 --> 48:17.120
 you can make some inferences about what else is wrong, right? Like that's a very, you know,

48:17.120 --> 48:23.280
 that's a very basic. Interesting. Yeah. So that in some deep sense, actually, that is what we're

48:23.280 --> 48:33.120
 doing. We're trying to infer how health, we use the word healthy, but basically, how functional

48:33.120 --> 48:41.120
 is this biological system I'm looking at so I can hook up with that one and make offspring? Yeah,

48:41.120 --> 48:45.360
 yeah. Well, what kind of hardware might their genomics give me that that might be useful in

48:45.360 --> 48:50.720
 the future? I wonder why evolution didn't give us a higher resolution signal. Like why the whole

48:50.720 --> 48:58.160
 peacock thing with the feathers? It doesn't seem, it's a very low bandwidth signal for

48:58.160 --> 49:02.880
 sexual selection. I'm gonna, and I'm not an expert on this stuff, but on peacocks. Well,

49:02.880 --> 49:08.880
 you know, but I'll take a stab at the reason. I think that it's because it's an arms race. You

49:08.880 --> 49:14.160
 see, you don't want everybody to know everything about you. So I think that as much as, as much as,

49:14.160 --> 49:19.680
 and in fact, there's another interesting part of this arms race, which is, if you think about this,

49:21.120 --> 49:27.760
 the most adaptive, evolvable system is one that has the most level of top down control, right?

49:27.760 --> 49:33.920
 If it's really easy to say to a bunch of cells, make another finger versus, okay, here's 10,000

49:33.920 --> 49:38.800
 gene expression changes that you need to do to make it to change your finger, right? The system

49:38.800 --> 49:42.320
 with good top down control that has memory and when we need to get back to that, by the way,

49:42.320 --> 49:48.080
 that's a question I neglected to answer about where the memory is and so on. A system that uses

49:48.080 --> 49:53.920
 all of that is really highly evolvable and that's fantastic. But guess what? It's also highly subject

49:53.920 --> 50:00.640
 to hijacking by parasites, by cheaters of various kinds, by conspecifics. Like we found that,

50:01.440 --> 50:04.880
 and then that goes back to the story of the pattern memory in these planaria,

50:04.880 --> 50:09.840
 there's a bacterium that lives on these planaria. That bacterium has an input into how many heads

50:09.840 --> 50:14.480
 the worm is going to have because it's hijacks that control system and it's able to make a

50:14.480 --> 50:18.480
 chemical that basically interfaces with the system that calculates how many heads you're

50:18.480 --> 50:22.080
 supposed to have and they can make them have two heads. And so you can imagine that if you

50:22.080 --> 50:25.520
 are two, so you want to be understandable for your own parts to understand each other,

50:25.520 --> 50:28.880
 but you don't want to be too understandable because you'll be too easily controllable.

50:28.880 --> 50:36.640
 And so I think that my guess is that that opposing pressure keeps us from being a super high

50:36.640 --> 50:40.240
 bandwidth kind of thing where we can just look at somebody and know everything about them.

50:40.240 --> 50:45.520
 So it's a kind of biological game of Texas hold them. You're showing some cards and you're hiding

50:45.520 --> 50:50.560
 other cards and there's part of it and there's bluffing and there's all that. And then there's

50:50.560 --> 50:55.520
 probably whole species that would do way too much bluffing. That's probably where peacocks fall.

50:56.800 --> 51:04.400
 There's a book that I don't remember if I read or if I read summaries of the book,

51:04.400 --> 51:10.160
 but it's about evolution of beauty and birds. Where is that from? Is that a book or does

51:10.160 --> 51:15.600
 Richard Dawkins talk about it? But basically there's some species start to like over select

51:15.600 --> 51:21.280
 for beauty, not over select. They just some reason select for beauty. There is a case to be made.

51:21.280 --> 51:27.200
 Actually now I'm starting to remember, I think Darwin himself made a case that you can select

51:27.200 --> 51:35.680
 based on beauty alone. There's a point where beauty doesn't represent some underlying biological

51:35.680 --> 51:44.400
 truth. You start to select for beauty itself. And I think the deep question is there some evolutionary

51:44.400 --> 51:53.760
 value to beauty, but it's an interesting kind of thought that can we deviate completely from

51:53.760 --> 51:59.520
 the deep biological truth to actually appreciate some kind of the summarization in itself.

52:00.480 --> 52:06.800
 Let me get back to memory because this is a really interesting idea. How do a collection of cells

52:07.600 --> 52:13.520
 remember anything? How do biological systems remember anything? How is that akin to the kind

52:13.520 --> 52:17.920
 of memory we think of humans as having within our big cognitive engine?

52:17.920 --> 52:24.240
 Yeah. One of the ways to start thinking about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves, where did

52:25.200 --> 52:32.320
 neurons and all these cool tricks that the brain uses to run these amazing problem solving abilities

52:32.320 --> 52:36.400
 on and basically an electrical network, right? Where did that come from? They didn't just evolve,

52:36.400 --> 52:40.720
 you know, appear out of nowhere. It must have evolved from something. And what it evolved from

52:40.720 --> 52:46.320
 was a much more ancient ability of cells to form networks to solve other kinds of problems. For

52:46.320 --> 52:51.520
 example, to navigate more for space to control the body shape. And so all of the components

52:52.320 --> 52:58.320
 of neurons, so ion channels, neurotransmitter machinery, electrical synapses, all this stuff

52:58.320 --> 53:03.600
 is way older than brains, way older than neurons, in fact, older than multicellularity. And so

53:03.600 --> 53:09.120
 it was already that even bacterial biofilms, there's some beautiful work from UCSD on brain

53:09.120 --> 53:14.880
 like dynamics and bacterial biofilms. So evolution figured out very early on that electrical networks

53:14.880 --> 53:19.120
 are amazing at having memories, at integrating information across distance, at different kinds

53:19.120 --> 53:23.760
 of optimization tasks, you know, image recognition and so on, long before there were brains.

53:24.400 --> 53:30.160
 Can you actually just step back? We'll return to it. What is bioelectricity? What is biochemistry?

53:30.160 --> 53:36.160
 What is, what are electrical networks? I think a lot of the biology community focuses on

53:36.160 --> 53:45.840
 the chemicals as the signaling mechanisms that make the whole thing work. You have, I think,

53:47.200 --> 53:53.600
 to a large degree, uniquely, maybe you can correct me on that, have focused on the bioelectricity,

53:53.600 --> 54:00.080
 which is using electricity for signaling. There's also probably mechanical. Sure, sure. Like knocking

54:00.080 --> 54:07.840
 on the door. So what's the difference? And what's an electrical network? Yeah, so I want to make

54:07.840 --> 54:14.800
 sure and kind of give credit where credit is due. So as far back as 1903, and probably late 1800s

54:14.800 --> 54:20.560
 already, people were thinking about the importance of electrical phenomena in life. So I'm for sure

54:20.560 --> 54:25.920
 not the first person to stress the importance of electricity. People, there were waves of research

54:25.920 --> 54:33.600
 in the in the 30s, in the 40s, and then, again, in the kind of 70s, 80s, and 90s of sort of the

54:33.600 --> 54:37.520
 pioneers of bioelectricity, who did some amazing work on all this, I think, I think what what

54:37.520 --> 54:43.040
 we've done that's new, is to step away from this idea that, and I'll describe what what the

54:43.040 --> 54:46.800
 bioelectricity is a step away from the idea that, well, here's another piece of physics that you

54:46.800 --> 54:51.760
 need to keep track of to understand physiology and development. And to really start looking at this

54:51.760 --> 54:57.360
 as saying, no, this is a privileged computational layer that gives you access to the actual

54:57.360 --> 55:02.160
 cognition of the tissue of basal cognition. So, so merging that that developmental biophysics with

55:02.160 --> 55:05.920
 ideas and cognition of computation, and so on, I think I think that's what we've done that's new.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.840
 But people have been talking about bioelectricity for a really long time. And so I'll, so I'll

55:09.840 --> 55:16.400
 define that. So what happens is that if you have, if you have a single cell, cell has a membrane,

55:16.400 --> 55:21.600
 in that membrane are proteins called ion channels, and those proteins allow charged molecules,

55:21.600 --> 55:27.280
 potassium, sodium, chloride, to go in and out under certain circumstances. And when there's

55:27.280 --> 55:33.200
 an imbalance of of those ions, there becomes a voltage gradient across that membrane. And so

55:33.200 --> 55:38.720
 all cells, all living cells try to hold a particular kind of voltage difference across

55:38.720 --> 55:44.240
 the membrane, and they spend a lot of energy to do so. When you now now, so that's it, that's it,

55:44.240 --> 55:48.720
 that's a single cell. When you have multiple cells, the cells sitting next to each other,

55:48.720 --> 55:53.200
 they can communicate their voltage state to each other via a number of different ways. But one of

55:53.200 --> 55:56.880
 them is this thing called a gap junction, which is basically like a little submarine hatch that

55:56.880 --> 56:01.440
 just kind of docks, right? And the ions from one side can flow to the other side, and vice versa.

56:02.160 --> 56:02.720
 So...

56:02.720 --> 56:08.720
 Isn't it incredible that this evolved? Isn't that wild? Because that didn't exist.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.440
 Correct. This had to be, this had to be evolved.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.640
 It had to be invented.

56:12.640 --> 56:13.280
 That's right.

56:13.280 --> 56:17.440
 Somebody invented electricity in the ocean. When did this get invented?

56:17.440 --> 56:22.800
 Yeah. So, I mean, it is incredible. The guy who discovered gap junctions,

56:22.800 --> 56:25.360
 Werner Loewenstein, I visited him. He was really old.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.720
 A human being?

56:26.720 --> 56:27.360
 He discovered them.

56:27.360 --> 56:32.480
 Because who really discovered them lived probably four billion years ago.

56:32.480 --> 56:32.880
 Good point.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.600
 So you give credit where credit is due, I'm just saying.

56:35.600 --> 56:43.200
 He rediscovered gap junctions. But when I visited him in Woods Hole, maybe 20 years ago now,

56:43.200 --> 56:47.840
 he told me that he was writing, and unfortunately, he passed away, and I think this book never got

56:47.840 --> 56:52.800
 written. He was writing a book on gap junctions and consciousness. And I think it would have been

56:52.800 --> 56:57.040
 an incredible book, because gap junctions are magic. I'll explain why in a minute.

56:57.920 --> 57:02.720
 What happens is that, just imagine, the thing about both these ion channels and these gap

57:02.720 --> 57:08.880
 junctions is that many of them are themselves voltage sensitive. So that's a voltage sensitive

57:08.880 --> 57:13.600
 current conductance. That's a transistor. And as soon as you've invented one, immediately,

57:13.600 --> 57:20.240
 you now get access to, from this platonic space of mathematical truths, you get access to all of the

57:20.240 --> 57:26.000
 cool things that transistors do. So now, when you have a network of cells, not only do they talk to

57:26.000 --> 57:30.160
 each other, but they can send messages to each other, and the differences of voltage can propagate.

57:30.160 --> 57:34.000
 Now, to neuroscientists, this is old hat, because you see this in the brain, right? This action

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
 potentials, the electricity. They have these awesome movies where you can take a zebra,

57:40.000 --> 57:45.040
 like a transparent animal, like a zebrafish, and you can literally look down, and you can see all

57:45.040 --> 57:49.120
 the firings as the fish is making decisions about what to eat and things like this. It's amazing.

57:49.120 --> 57:54.160
 Well, your whole body is doing that all the time, just much slower. So there are very few things

57:54.160 --> 57:59.360
 that neurons do that all the cells in your body don't do. They all do very similar things, just

57:59.360 --> 58:04.320
 on a much slower timescale. And whereas your brain is thinking about how to solve problems in

58:04.320 --> 58:08.880
 three dimensional space, the cells in an embryo are thinking about how to solve problems in

58:08.880 --> 58:12.240
 anatomical space. They're trying to have memories like, hey, how many fingers are we supposed to

58:12.240 --> 58:15.840
 have? Well, how many do we have now? What do we do to get from here to there? That's the kind of

58:15.840 --> 58:20.720
 problems they're thinking about. And the reason that gap junctions are magic is, imagine, right,

58:20.720 --> 58:29.360
 from the earliest time. Here are two cells. This cell, how can they communicate? Well,

58:29.360 --> 58:34.800
 the simple version is this cell could send a chemical signal, it floats over, and it hits

58:34.800 --> 58:39.200
 a receptor on this cell, right? Because it comes from outside, this cell can very easily tell that

58:39.200 --> 58:44.240
 that came from outside. Whatever information is coming, that's not my information. That information

58:44.240 --> 58:48.640
 is coming from the outside. So I can trust it, I can ignore it, I can do various things with it,

58:48.640 --> 58:52.160
 I can do various things with it, whatever, but I know it comes from the outside. Now imagine

58:52.160 --> 58:55.360
 instead that you have two cells with a gap junction between them. Something happens,

58:55.360 --> 58:59.760
 let's say this cell gets poked, there's a calcium spike, the calcium spike or whatever small

58:59.760 --> 59:04.400
 molecule signal propagates through the gap junction to this cell. There's no ownership

59:04.400 --> 59:10.000
 metadata on that signal. This cell does not know now that it came from outside because it looks

59:10.000 --> 59:15.200
 exactly like its own memories would have looked like of whatever had happened, right? So gap

59:15.200 --> 59:21.440
 junctions to some extent wipe ownership information on data, which means that if I can't, if you and

59:21.440 --> 59:26.320
 I are sharing memories and we can't quite tell who the memories belong to, that's the beginning of a

59:26.320 --> 59:31.840
 mind melt. That's the beginning of a scale up of cognition from here's me and here's you to no,

59:31.840 --> 59:36.640
 now there's just us. So they enforce a collective intelligence gap junctions. That's right. It

59:36.640 --> 59:39.680
 helps. It's the beginning. It's not the whole story by any means, but it's the start.

59:39.680 --> 59:48.240
 Where's state stored of the system? Is it in part in the gap junctions themselves? Is it in the

59:48.240 --> 59:55.360
 cells? There are many, many layers to this as always in biology. So there are chemical networks.

59:55.360 --> 1:00:00.320
 So for example, gene regulatory networks, right? Which, or basically any kind of chemical pathway

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:04.480
 where different chemicals activate and repress each other, they can store memories. So in a

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:09.120
 dynamical system sense, they can store memories. They can get into stable states that are hard to

1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:13.200
 pull them out of. So that becomes, once they get in, that's a memory, a permanent memory or a

1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:17.760
 semi permanent memory of something that's happened. There are cytoskeletal structures that are

1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:24.640
 physically, they store memories in physical configuration. There are electrical memories

1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:30.560
 like flip flops where there is no physical. So if you look, I showed my students this example

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:37.920
 as a flip flop. And the reason that it stores a zero one is not because some piece of the hardware

1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:42.880
 moved. It's because there's a cycling of the current in one side of the thing. If I come over

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:50.080
 and I hold the other side to a high voltage for a brief period of time, it flips over and now it's

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:54.880
 here. But none of the hardware moved. The information is in a stable dynamical sense. And

1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:58.560
 if you were to x ray the thing, you couldn't tell me if it was zero or one, because all you would

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:03.120
 see is where the hardware is. You wouldn't see the energetic state of the system. So there are

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:09.680
 bioelectrical states that are held in that exact way, like volatile ram basically, like in the

1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:14.960
 electrical state. It's very akin to the different ways that memory is stored in a computer.

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.120
 So there's ram, there's hard drive. You can make that mapping, right? So I think the interesting

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:26.960
 thing is that based on the biology, we can have a more sophisticated, you know, I think we can

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:32.560
 revise some of our computer engineering methods because there are some interesting things that

1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:38.400
 biology we haven't done yet. But that mapping is not bad. I mean, I think it works in many ways.

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:43.280
 Yeah, I wonder because I mean, the way we build computers at the root of computer science is the

1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:52.240
 idea of proof of correctness. We program things to be perfect, reliable. You know, this idea of

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:58.240
 resilience and robustness to unknown conditions is not as important. So that's what biology is really

1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:04.000
 good at. So I don't know what kind of systems. I don't know how we go from a computer to a

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.480
 biological system in the future. Yeah, I think that, you know, the thing about biology is all

1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.280
 about making really important decisions really quickly on very limited information. I mean,

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.600
 that's what biology is all about. You have to act, you have to act now. The stakes are very high,

1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:24.080
 and you don't know most of what you need to know to be perfect. And so there's not even an attempt

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:29.920
 to be perfect or to get it right in any sense. There are just things like active inference,

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:37.120
 minimize surprise, optimize some efficiency and some things like this that guides the whole

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:44.640
 business. I mentioned too offline that somebody who's a fan of your work is Andre Kapathy.

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:52.720
 And he's, amongst many things, also writes occasionally a great blog. He came up with

1:02:52.720 --> 1:03:00.720
 this idea, I don't know if he coined the term, but of software 2.0, where the programming is

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:08.240
 done in the space of configuring these artificial neural networks. Is there some sense in which that

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:16.400
 would be the future of programming for us humans, where we're less doing like Python like programming

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:25.680
 and more... How would that look like? But basically doing the hyperparameters of something

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:33.360
 akin to a biological system and watching it go and adjusting it and creating some kind of feedback

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:40.800
 loop within the system so it corrects itself. And then we watch it over time accomplish the goals

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:46.880
 we want it to accomplish. Is that kind of the dream of the dogs that you described in the Nature

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:54.960
 paper? Yeah. I mean, that's what you just painted is a very good description of our efforts at

1:03:54.960 --> 1:04:01.040
 regenerative medicine as a kind of somatic psychiatry. So the idea is that you're not trying

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:07.920
 to micromanage. I mean, think about the limitations of a lot of the medicines today. We try to

1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:14.560
 interact down at the level of pathways. So we're trying to micromanage it. What's the problem? Well,

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:20.800
 one problem is that for almost every medicine other than antibiotics, once you stop it, the

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:23.680
 problem comes right back. You haven't fixed anything. You were addressing symptoms. You

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.560
 weren't actually curing anything, again, except for antibiotics. That's one problem. The other

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:33.600
 problem is you have massive amount of side effects because you were trying to interact at the lowest

1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:40.400
 level. It's like, I'm going to try to program this computer by changing the melting point of

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:46.640
 copper. Maybe you can do things that way, but my God, it's hard to program at the hardware level.

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:53.360
 So what I think we're starting to understand is that, and by the way, this goes back to what you

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:58.800
 were saying before about that we could have access to our internal state. So people who practice that

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:04.000
 kind of stuff, so yoga and biofeedback and those, those are all the people that uniformly will say

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.480
 things like, well, the body has an intelligence and this and that. Those two sets overlap perfectly

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:13.600
 because that's exactly right. Because once you start thinking about it that way, you realize that

1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:18.480
 the better locus of control is not always at the lowest level. This is why we don't all program

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:24.720
 with a soldering iron. We take advantage of the high level intelligences that are there,

1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:28.960
 intelligences that are there, which means trying to figure out, okay, which of your tissues can

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:35.200
 learn? What can they learn? Why is it that certain drugs stop working after you take them for a while

1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:40.160
 with this habituation, right? And so can we understand habituation, sensitization, associative

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:44.400
 learning, these kinds of things in chemical pathways? We're going to have a completely

1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:49.200
 different way. I think we're going to have a completely different way of using drugs and of

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:54.560
 medicine in general when we start focusing on the goal states and on the intelligence of our

1:05:54.560 --> 1:05:59.040
 subsystems as opposed to treating everything as if the only path was micromanagement from

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:05.200
 chemistry upwards. Well, can you speak to this idea of somatic psychiatry? What are somatic cells?

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:11.760
 How do they form networks that use bioelectricity to have memory and all those kinds of things?

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:16.160
 Yeah. What are somatic cells like basics here? Somatic cells just means the cells of your body.

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:20.000
 Soma just means body, right? So somatic cells are just the... I'm not even specifically making a

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:23.920
 distinction between somatic cells and stem cells or anything like that. I mean, basically all the

1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:28.400
 cells in your body, not just neurons, but all the cells in your body. They form electrical

1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:32.400
 networks during embryogenesis, during regeneration. What those networks are doing

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:39.600
 in part is processing information about what our current shape is and what the goal shape is.

1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:45.120
 Now, how do I know this? Because I can give you a couple of examples. One example is when we started

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:50.400
 studying this, we said, okay, here's a planarian. A planarian is a flatworm. It has one head and one

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:55.200
 tail normally. And the amazing... There's several amazing things about planaria, but basically they

1:06:55.200 --> 1:07:00.960
 kind of... I think planaria hold the answer to pretty much every deep question of life.

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:04.960
 For one thing, they're similar to our ancestors. So they have true symmetry. They have a true

1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:08.320
 brain. They're not like earthworms. They're a much more advanced life form. They have lots

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:12.240
 of different internal organs, but they're these little... They're about maybe two centimeters in

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.680
 the centimeter to two in size. They have a head and a tail. And the first thing is planaria are

1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:22.320
 immortal. So they do not age. There's no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:27.680
 tells you that these theories of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It's not that

1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:33.280
 well over time everything degrades. No, planaria can keep it going for probably how long have

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:38.960
 they been around 400 million years. So the planaria in our lab are actually in physical

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:43.600
 continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago. So there's planaria that

1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:49.280
 have lived that long essentially. What does it mean physical continuity? Because what they do

1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:54.560
 is they split in half. The way they reproduce is they split in half. So the planaria, the back end

1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:59.680
 grabs the petri dish, the front end takes off and they rip themselves in half. But isn't it some

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:07.600
 sense where like you are a physical continuation? Yes, except that we go through a bottleneck of one

1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:11.760
 cell, which is the egg. They do not. I mean, they can. There's certain planaria. Got it. So we go

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.200
 through a very ruthless compression process and they don't. Yes. Like an auto encoder, you know,

1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:22.160
 sort of squashed down to one cell and then back out. These guys just tear themselves in half.

1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:26.640
 And so the other amazing thing about them is they regenerate. So you can cut them into pieces.

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:32.560
 The record is, I think, 276 or something like that by Thomas Hunt Morgan. And each piece regrows a

1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:36.960
 perfect little worm. They know exactly, every piece knows exactly what's missing, what needs

1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:45.360
 to happen. In fact, if you chop it in half, as it grows the other half, the original tissue shrinks

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:50.080
 so that when the new tiny head shows up, they're proportional. So it keeps perfect proportion.

1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:54.160
 If you starve them, they shrink. If you feed them again, they expand. Their control,

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.960
 their anatomical control is just insane. Somebody cut them into over 200 pieces.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:03.520
 Yeah. Thomas Hunt Morgan did. Hashtag science. Amazing. And maybe more. I mean,

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:06.720
 they didn't have antibiotics back then. I bet he lost some due to infection. I bet it's

1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:10.000
 actually more than that. I bet you could do more than that. Humans can't do that.

1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:16.960
 Well, yes. I mean, again, true, except that... Maybe you can at the embryonic level.

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:21.120
 Well, that's the thing, right? So when I talk about this, I say, just remember that

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:24.880
 as amazing as it is to grow a whole planarian from a tiny fragment,

1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:30.640
 half of the human population can grow a full body from one cell. So development is really,

1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:34.240
 you can look at development as just an example of regeneration.

1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:39.600
 Yeah. To think, we'll talk about regenerative medicine, but there's some sense of what would

1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:45.520
 be like that warm in like 500 years where I can just go regrow a hand.

1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:49.920
 Yep. With given time, it takes time to grow large things.

1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:50.560
 For now.

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:51.840
 Yeah, I think so. I think.

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:56.240
 You can probably... Why not accelerate? Oh, biology takes its time?

1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:00.080
 I'm not going to say anything is impossible, but I don't know of a way to accelerate these

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:04.000
 processes. I think it's possible. I think we are going to be regenerative, but I don't know of a

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:04.800
 way to make it faster.

1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:10.080
 I could just think people from a few centuries from now would be like, well, they used to have

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:17.920
 to wait a week for the hand to regrow. It's like when the microwave was invented. You can toast

1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:27.360
 your... What's that called when you put a cheese on a toast? It's delicious is all I know. I'm

1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:33.280
 blanking. Anywho. All right. So planaria, why were we talking about the magical planaria that they

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:34.320
 have the mystery of life?

1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:37.120
 Yeah. So the reason we're talking about planaria is not only are they immortal,

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.880
 not only do they regenerate every part of the body, they generally don't get cancer,

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:47.360
 which we can talk about why that's important. They're smart. They can learn things. You can

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:52.320
 train them. And it turns out that if you train a planaria and then cut their heads off, the tail

1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:56.000
 will regenerate a brand new brain that still remembers the original information.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.960
 Do they have a biological network going on or no?

1:10:58.960 --> 1:10:59.280
 Yes.

1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:05.200
 So their somatic cells are forming a network. And that's what you mean by a true brain? What's the

1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:06.480
 requirement for a true brain?

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.080
 Like everything else, it's a continuum, but a true brain has certain characteristics as far as the

1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:15.680
 density, like a localized density of neurons that guides behavior.

1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:16.240
 In the head.

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:22.080
 Exactly. Exactly. If you cut their head off, the tail doesn't do anything. It just sits there

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:28.000
 until a new brain regenerates. They have all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.720
 But here's why we're talking about them in this context. So here's your planaria. You cut off the

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:35.840
 head. You cut off the tail. You have a middle fragment. That middle fragment has to make one

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:40.080
 head and one tail. How does it know how many of each to make? And where do they go? How come it

1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:46.960
 doesn't switch? How come, right? So we did a very simple thing. And we said, okay, let's make the

1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:52.400
 hypothesis that there's a somatic electrical network that remembers the correct pattern,

1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:55.760
 and that what it's doing is recalling that memory and building to that pattern.

1:11:55.760 --> 1:12:01.920
 So what we did was we used a way to visualize electrical activity in these cells, right? It's a

1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:06.960
 variant of what people used to look for electricity in the brain. And we saw that that fragment has a

1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:12.720
 very particular electrical pattern. You can literally see it once we developed the technique.

1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:17.920
 It has a very particular electrical pattern that shows you where the head and the tail goes,

1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:22.240
 right? You can just see it. And then we said, okay, well now let's test the idea that that's

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:25.920
 a memory that actually controls where the head and the tail goes. Let's change that pattern. So

1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:29.680
 basically, incept the false memory. And so what you can do is you can do that in many different

1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:34.640
 ways. One way is with drugs that target ion channels to say, and so you pick these drugs

1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:39.600
 and you say, okay, I'm going to do it so that instead of this one head, one tail electrical

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:43.440
 pattern, you have a two headed pattern, right? You're just editing the electrical information

1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:47.520
 in the network. When you do that, guess what the cells build? They build a two headed worm.

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.040
 And the coolest thing about it, no genetic changes. So we haven't touched the genome.

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:54.320
 The genome is totally wild type. But the amazing thing about it is that when you take these two

1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:59.520
 headed animals and you cut them into pieces again, some of those pieces will continue to

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:05.840
 make two headed animals. So that information, that memory, that electrical circuit, not only does it

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.920
 hold the information for how many heads, not only does it use that information to tell the cells

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:14.320
 what to do to regenerate, but it stores it. Once you've reset it, it keeps. And we can go back,

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:18.960
 we can take a two headed animal and put it back to one headed. So now imagine, so there's a couple

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.720
 of interesting things here that that have implications for understanding what genomes

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:27.200
 and things like that. Imagine I take this two headed animal. Oh, and by the way, when they

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:31.360
 reproduce, when they tear themselves in half, you still get two headed animals. So imagine I take

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:34.640
 them and I throw them in the Charles River over here. So 100 years later, some scientists come

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.640
 along and they scoop up some samples and they go, oh, there's a single headed form and a two headed

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:43.600
 form. Wow, a speciation event. Cool. Let's sequence the genome and see why, what happened. The genomes

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:47.040
 are identical. There's nothing wrong with the genome. So if you ask the question, how does,

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:51.360
 so, so this goes back to your very first question is where do body plans come from, right? How does

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:55.600
 the planarian know how many heads it's supposed to have? Now it's interesting because you could

1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:01.840
 say DNA, but what happened, what, what, as it turns out, the DNA produces a piece of hardware

1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:07.520
 that by default says one head the way that when you turn on a calculator, by default, it's a zero

1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:11.120
 every single time, right? When you turn it on, it just says zero, but it's a programmable calculator

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:16.000
 as it turns out. So once you've changed that next time, it won't say zero. It'll say something else

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.120
 and the same thing here. So you can make, you can make one headed, two headed, you can make no

1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:23.120
 headed worms. We've done some other things along these lines, some other really weird constructs.

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.640
 So, so this, this, this, this question of, right. So again, it's really important. The, the hardware

1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:33.920
 software distinction is really important because the hardware is essential because without proper

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.080
 hardware, you're never going to get to the right physiology of having that memory. But once you

1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:42.320
 have it, it doesn't fully determine what the information is going to be. You can have other

1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:46.720
 information in there and it's reprogrammable by us, by bacteria, by various parasites, probably

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:52.480
 things like that. The other amazing thing about these planarias, think about this, most animals,

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:56.480
 when we get a mutation in our bodies, our children don't inherit it, right? So you can go on, you

1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:00.720
 could run around for 50, 60 years getting mutations. Your children don't have those mutations

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:05.120
 because we go through the egg stage. Planaria tear themselves in half and that's how they reproduce.

1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:10.080
 So for 400 million years, they keep every mutation that they've had that doesn't kill the cell that

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:14.640
 it's in. So when you look at these planaria, their bodies are what's called mixoploid, meaning that

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:17.840
 every cell might have a different number of chromosomes. They look like a tumor. If you look

1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:22.720
 at the, the, the, the, the genome is an incredible mess because they accumulate all this stuff.

1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:28.240
 And yet the, their body structure is, they are the best regenerators on the planet. Their anatomy is

1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:32.720
 rock solid, even though their genome is always all kinds of crap. So this is a kind of a scandal,

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:37.520
 right? That, you know, when we learn that, well, you know, what are genomes to what genomes determine

1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:41.520
 your body? Okay. Why is the animal with the worst genome have the best anatomical control, the most

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:46.080
 cancer resistant, the most regenerative, right? Really, we're just beginning to start to understand

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.720
 this relationship between the, the genomically determined hardware and, and, and by the way,

1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:55.440
 just as of, as of a couple of months ago, I think I now somewhat understand why this is,

1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:57.840
 but it's really, it's really a major, you know, a major puzzle.

1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:05.280
 I mean, that really throws a wrench into the whole nature versus nurture because you usually

1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:12.720
 associate electricity with the, with the nurture and the hardware with the nature.

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:19.360
 And it's, there's just this weird integrated mess that propagates through generations.

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:25.040
 Yeah. It's much more fluid. It's much more complex. You can, you can imagine what's,

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.200
 what's happening here is just, just imagine the evolution of a, of a, of an animal like this,

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:33.280
 that, that multi scale, this goes back to this multi scale competency, right? Imagine that you

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:38.800
 have two, two, two, you have, you have an animal that that where its, its tissues have some degree

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:42.960
 of multi scale competency. So for example, if the like, like we saw in the tadpole, you know,

1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:46.240
 if you put an eye on its tail, they can still see out of that eye, right? That the, you know,

1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:50.400
 there's all, there's incredible plasticity. So if you have an animal and it comes up for selection

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:56.880
 and the fitness is quite good, evolution doesn't know whether the fitness is good because the

1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:01.600
 genome was awesome or because the genome was kind of junky, but, but the competency made up for it,

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:06.160
 right? And things kind of ended up good. So what that means is that the more competency you have,

1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:11.520
 the harder it is for selection to pick the best genomes, it hides information, right? And so that

1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:16.640
 means that, so, so what happens, you know, evolution basically starts all those start,

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:21.200
 all the hard work is being done to increase the competency because it's harder and harder to see

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.760
 the genomes. And so I think in planaria, what happened is that there's this runaway phenomenon

1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:31.040
 where all the effort went into the algorithm such that we know you got a crappy genome. We can't

1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:35.360
 keep, we can't clean up the genome. We can't keep track of it. So what's going to happen is what

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:40.160
 survives are the algorithms that can create a great worm no matter what the genome is. So

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:44.080
 everything went into the algorithm and which, which of course then reduces the pressure on

1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:49.040
 keeping a, you know, keeping a clean genome. So this idea of, right, and different animals have

1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:53.600
 this in different, to different levels, but this idea of putting energy into an algorithm that

1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:59.040
 does not overtrain on priors, right? It can't assume, I mean, I think biology is this way in

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:04.160
 general, evolution doesn't take the past too seriously because it makes these basically

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:08.800
 problem solving machines as opposed to like exactly what, you know, to, to, to deal with

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:14.480
 exactly what happened last time. Yeah. Problem solving versus memory recall. So a little memory,

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:18.560
 but a lot of problem solving. I think so. Yeah. In many cases, yeah. Problem solving.

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:25.600
 I mean, it's incredible that those kinds of systems are able to be constructed,

1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:31.280
 um, especially how much they contrast with the way we build problem solving systems in the AI world.

1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:39.600
 Um, back to Xenobots. I'm not sure if we ever described how Xenobots are built, but

1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:45.280
 I mean, you have a paper titled biological robots perspectives on an emerging interdisciplinary

1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:51.360
 field. And the beginning you, uh, you mentioned that the word Xenobots is like controversial.

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:57.280
 Do you guys get in trouble for using Xenobots or what? Do people not like the word Xenobots?

1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:02.400
 Are you trying to be provocative with the word Xenobots versus biological robots?

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:07.200
 I don't know. Is there some drama that we should be aware of? There's a little bit of drama. Uh,

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:15.200
 I think, I think the drama is basically related to people, um, having very fixed ideas about what

1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:22.960
 terms mean. And I think in many cases, these ideas are completely out of date with, with where science

1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:28.720
 is now. And for sure they're, they're out of date with what's going to be, I mean, these, these,

1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:33.760
 these concepts, uh, are not going to survive the next couple of decades. So if you ask a person

1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:38.080
 and including, um, you know, a lot of people in biology who kind of want to keep a sharp

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:42.160
 distinction between biologicals and robots, right? See, what's a robot? Well, a robot,

1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:46.400
 it comes out of a factory. It's made by humans. It is boring. It is a meaning that you can predict

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:50.640
 everything it's going to do. It's made of metal and certain other inorganic materials. Living

1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:54.400
 organisms are magical. They, they, they arise, right? And so on. So these, these distinctions,

1:19:54.400 --> 1:20:00.720
 I think these, these distinctions, I think were, were never good, but, uh, they're going to be

1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:05.120
 completely useless going forward. And so part of, there's a couple of papers that that's one paper

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:09.520
 and there's another one that Josh Bongar and I wrote where we really attack the terminology.

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:16.880
 And we say these binary categories are based on very, um, nonessential kind of surface, uh,

1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:22.560
 limitations of, of technology and imagination that were true before, but they've got to go. And so,

1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:27.360
 and so we call them Zenobots. So, so Xeno for Xenopus Levus, where this is, it's the frog that,

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:32.320
 that these guys are made of, but we think it's an example of, of, of, uh, of a biobot technology,

1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:39.680
 because ultimately if we, if we under, once we understand how to, uh, communicate and manipulate,

1:20:39.680 --> 1:20:45.680
 um, the inputs to these cells, we will be able to get them to build whatever we want them to build.

1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:49.360
 And that's robotics, right? It's, it's the rational construction of machines that have

1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:54.560
 useful purposes. I, I absolutely think that this is a robotics platform, whereas some biologists

1:20:54.560 --> 1:21:02.080
 don't, but it's built in a way that, uh, all the different components are doing their own computation.

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:06.000
 So in a way that we've been talking about, so you're trying to do top down control in that

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.680
 biological system. And in the future, all of this will, will, will merge together because

1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:13.840
 of course at some point we're going to throw in synthetic biology circuits, right? New, new, um,

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:17.200
 you know, new transcriptional circuits to get them to do new things. Of course we'll throw some of

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.680
 that in, but we specifically stayed away from all of that because in the first few papers,

1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:25.600
 and there's some more coming down the pike that are, I think going to be pretty, pretty dynamite,

1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:30.720
 um, that, uh, we want to show what the native cells are made of. Because what happens is,

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:33.920
 you know, if you engineer the heck out of them, right, if we were to put in new, you know,

1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:38.000
 new transcription factors and some new metabolic machinery and whatever, people will say, well,

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:44.000
 okay, you engineered this and you made it do whatever. And fine. I wanted to show, uh, and,

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:50.240
 and, and the whole team, uh, wanted to show the plasticity and the intelligence in the biology.

1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:55.280
 What does it do that's surprising before you even start manipulating the hardware in that way?

1:21:55.280 --> 1:22:02.560
 Yeah. Don't try to, uh, over control the thing. Let it flourish. The, the full beauty of the

1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:07.600
 biological system. Why Xenopus Levus? How do you pronounce it? The frog.

1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:09.360
 Xenopus Levus. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very popular.

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:10.240
 Why this frog?

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:15.360
 It's been used since, uh, I think the fifties. Uh, it's just very convenient because you can,

1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:19.280
 you know, we, we keep the adults in this, in this, uh, very fine frog habitat. They lay eggs. They

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:24.880
 lay tens of thousands of eggs at a time. Um, the eggs develop right in front of your eyes. It's the

1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:29.440
 most mad magical thing you can, you can see because normally, you know, if you were to deal

1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:32.960
 with mice or rabbits or whatever, you don't see the early stages, right? Cause everything's inside

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:36.640
 the mother. Everything's in a Petri dish at room temperature. So you just, you, you have an egg,

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:40.400
 it's fertilized and you can just watch it divide and divide and divide. And on all the organs

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:44.960
 form, you can just see it. And at that point, um, the community has, has developed lots of

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:50.000
 different tools for understanding what's going on and also for, for manipulating, right? So it's,

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.160
 it's people use it for, um, you know, for understanding birth defects and neurobiology

1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:58.640
 and cancer immunology. So you get the whole, uh, embryogenesis in the Petri dish.

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:03.520
 That's so cool to watch. Is there videos of this? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's,

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:08.160
 but yeah, there's, there's amazing videos on, on, online. I mean, mammalian embryos are super cool

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:12.560
 too. For example, monozygotic twins are what happens when you cut a mammalian embryo in half.

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:15.760
 You don't get two half bodies. You get two perfectly normal bodies because it's a

1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:19.920
 regeneration event, right? Development is just the, it's just the kind of regeneration really.

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:25.120
 And why this particular frog? It's just, uh, cause they were doing in the fifties and.

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:32.000
 It breeds well in, um, you know, in, in, it's easy to raise in, in the laboratory and, uh,

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.480
 it's very prolific and all the tools basically for decades, people have been developing tools.

1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:40.800
 There's other, some people use other frogs, but I have to say this is, this is, this is important.

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:46.080
 Xenobots are fundamentally not anything about frogs. So, um, I can't say too much about this

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:50.400
 cause it's not published and peer reviewed yet, but we've made Xenobots out of other things that

1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:54.640
 have nothing to do with frogs. It's, this is not a frog phenomenon. This is, we, we started with

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:59.040
 frog because it's so convenient, but this, this, this plasticity is not a fraud. You know, it's

1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:02.880
 not related to the fact that they're frogs. What happens when you kiss it? Does it turn

1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:07.120
 into a prince? No. Or a princess? Which way? Uh, prince. Yeah. Prince should be a prince.

1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:10.720
 Yeah. Uh, that's an experiment that I don't believe we've done. And if we have, I don't

1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:16.320
 want to collaborate, I can, I can take on the lead, uh, on that effort. Okay, cool. Uh,

1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:23.360
 how does the cells coordinate? Let's focus in on just the embryogenesis. So there's one cell,

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:32.240
 so it divides, doesn't have to be very careful about what each cell starts doing once they divide.

1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:37.840
 Yes. And like, when there's three of them, it's like the cofounders or whatever,

1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:44.320
 like, well, like slow down, you're responsible for this. When do they become specialized and

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:49.440
 how do they coordinate that specialization? So, so this is the basic science of developmental

1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:55.120
 biology. There's a lot known about all of that, but, um, but I'll tell you what I think is kind

1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:00.560
 of the most important part, which is, yes, it's very important who does what. However,

1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:07.440
 because going back to this issue of why I made this claim that, um, biology doesn't take the past

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.560
 too seriously. And what I mean by that is it doesn't assume that everything is the way it's,

1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:17.200
 it's expected to be. Right. And here's an example of that. Um, this was, this was done, this was,

1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:21.280
 this was an old experiment going back to the forties, but, um, basically imagine imagine

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:25.760
 it's a new salamander and it's got these little tube tubules that go to the kidneys, right? It's

1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:30.080
 a little tube. Take a cross section of that tube. You see eight to 10 cells that have

1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:34.880
 cooperated to make this little tube in cross section, right? So one amazing, one amazing

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:41.200
 thing you can do is, um, you can, you can mess with a very early cell division to make the cells

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:44.560
 gigantic, bigger. You can, you can make them different sizes. You can force them to be different

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:50.160
 sizes. So if you make the cells different sizes, the whole nude is still the same size.

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:53.840
 So if you take a cross section through the, through that tubule, instead of eight to 10

1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:59.200
 cells, you might have four or five or you might have, you know, three until you make the cells so

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:06.480
 enormous that one single cell wraps around itself and, and gives you that same large scale structure

1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:11.120
 with a completely different molecular mechanism. So now instead of cell to cell communication to

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.840
 make a tubule, instead of that, it's one cell using the cytoskeleton to bend itself around.

1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:20.400
 So think about what that means in the service of a large scale, talk about top down control,

1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:24.960
 right? In the service of a large scale anatomical feature, different molecular mechanisms get

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:29.760
 called up. So now think about this, you're, you're, you're a nude cell and trying to make an embryo.

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:34.480
 If you had a fixed idea of who was supposed to do what, you'd be screwed because now your cells

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:40.240
 are gigantic. Nothing would work. The, there's an incredible tolerance for changes in the size of

1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.280
 the parts and the amount of DNA in those parts. Um, all sorts of stuff you can, you can, the life

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:49.200
 is highly interoperable. You can put electrodes in there and you can put weird nanomaterials. It

1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:54.400
 still works. It's, it's, uh, this is that problem solving action, right? It's able to do what it

1:26:54.400 --> 1:27:00.160
 needs to do, even when circumstances change. That is, you know, the hallmark of intelligence,

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:04.080
 right? William James defined intelligence as the ability to get to the same goal by different

1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:08.960
 means. That's this, you get to the same goal by completely different means. And so, so,

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:12.640
 so why am I bringing this up is just to say that, yeah, it's important for the cells to do the right

1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:17.520
 stuff, but they have incredible tolerances for things not being what you expect and to still

1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:23.840
 get their job done. So if you're, you know, um, all of these things are not hardwired.

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.880
 There are organisms that might be hardwired. For example, the nematode C elegans in that organism,

1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:32.800
 every cell is numbered, meaning that every C elegans has exactly the same number of cells

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:36.000
 as every other C elegans. They're all in the same place. They all divide. There's literally a map

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.880
 of how it works that in that, in that sort of system, it's, it's, it's much more cookie cutter,

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:47.840
 but, but most, most organisms are incredibly plastic in that way. Is there something particularly

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:53.680
 magical to you about the whole developmental biology process? Um, is there something you

1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:58.080
 could say, cause you just said it, they're very good at accomplishing the goal of the job they

1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:05.120
 need to do the competency thing, but you get fricking organism from one cell. It's like, uh,

1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:14.000
 I mean, it's very hard, hard to intuit that whole process to even think about reverse engineering

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:19.760
 that process. Right. Very hard to the point where I often just imagine, I, I sometimes ask my

1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:23.680
 students to do this thought experiment. Imagine you were, you were shrunk down to the, to the scale

1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:27.120
 of a single cell and you were in the middle of an embryo and you were looking around at what's going

1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:30.400
 on and the cells running around, some cells are dying at the, you know, every time you look,

1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:35.520
 it's kind of a different number of cells for most organisms. And so I think that if you didn't know

1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:40.080
 what embryonic development was, you would have no clue that what you're seeing is always going to

1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:44.560
 make the same thing. Nevermind knowing what that, what that is. Nevermind being able to say, even

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:48.080
 with full genomic information, being able to say, what the hell are they building? We have no way

1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:54.720
 to do that. But, but just even to guess that, wow, the, the, the outcome of all this activity is it's

1:28:54.720 --> 1:29:00.080
 always going to be, it's always going to build the same thing. The imperative to create the final you

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.240
 as you are now is there already. So you can, you would, so you start from the same embryo,

1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:14.480
 you create a very similar organism. Yeah. Except for cases like the Xenobots, when you give them

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:18.240
 a different environment, they come up with a different way to be adaptive in that environment.

1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:24.080
 But overall, I mean, so, so I think, so I think to, you know, kind of summarize it,

1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:31.520
 I think what evolution is really good at is creating hardware that has a very stable baseline

1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:36.880
 mode, meaning that left to its own devices, it's very good at doing the same thing. But it has a

1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:41.360
 bunch of problem solving capacity such that if any, if any assumptions don't hold, if your cells are

1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:45.040
 a weird size, or you get the wrong number of cells, or there's a, you know, somebody stuck

1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:50.960
 in electrode halfway through the body, whatever, it will still get most of what it needs to do done.

1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:57.760
 You've talked about the magic and the power of biology here. If we look at the human brain,

1:29:57.760 --> 1:30:02.560
 how special is the brain in this context? You're kind of minimizing the importance of the brain

1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:08.640
 or lessening its, we think of all the special computation happens in the brain,

1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:14.960
 everything else is like the help. You're kind of saying that the whole thing is the whole thing

1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:22.160
 is doing computation. But nevertheless, how special is the human brain in this full context of

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:27.680
 biology? Yeah, I mean, look, there's no getting away from the fact that the human brain allows

1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:31.920
 us to do things that we could not do without it. You can say the same thing about the liver.

1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:37.680
 Yeah, no, this is this is true. And so and so, you know, I, my goal is not No, you're right. My goal

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:41.840
 is just being polite to the brain right now. Well, being a politician, like, listen,

1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:46.480
 everybody has everybody has a role. Yeah, it's very important role. That's right. We have to

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:51.920
 acknowledge the importance of the brain, you know, there are more than enough people who are

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:58.720
 cheerleading the brain, right? So so I don't feel like nothing I say is going to reduce people's

1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:04.160
 excitement about the human brain. And so so I emphasize other things credit. I don't think it

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:08.880
 gets too much credit. I think other things don't get enough credit. I think the brain is the human

1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:13.760
 brain is incredible and special and all that. I think other things need more credit. And and I

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:19.360
 also think that this and I'm sort of this way about everything. I don't like binary categories,

1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:24.880
 but almost anything I like a continuum. And the thing about the human brain is that it by by by

1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:32.080
 accepting that as some kind of an important category or essential, essential thing, we end

1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:38.320
 up with all kinds of weird pseudo problems and conundrum. So for example, when we talk about it,

1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:44.880
 you know, if you don't want to talk about ethics and other other things like that, and what you

1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:50.000
 know, this this idea that surely if we look out into the universe, surely, we don't believe that

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.320
 this human brain is the only way to be sentient, right? Surely we don't, you know, and to have high

1:31:54.320 --> 1:31:59.360
 level cognition. I just can't even wrap my mind around this, this idea that that is the only way

1:31:59.360 --> 1:32:04.160
 to do it. No doubt there are other architectures made bond made of completely different principles

1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:09.760
 that achieve the same thing. And once we believe that, then that tells us something important. It

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:15.520
 tells us that things that are not quite human brains or chimeras of human brains and other

1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:20.800
 tissue or human brains or other kinds of brains and novel configurations or things that are sort

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:26.720
 of brains, but not really, or plants or embryos or whatever, might also have important cognitive

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:32.000
 status. So that's the only thing I think we have to be really careful about treating the human

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:37.680
 brain as if it was some kind of like sharp binary category. You know, you are or you aren't. I don't

1:32:37.680 --> 1:32:44.960
 believe that exists. So when we look out at all the beautiful variety of human brains,

1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:52.880
 semi biological architectures out there in the universe, how many intelligent alien civilizations

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:59.200
 do you think are out there? Boy, I have no expertise in that whatsoever. You haven't met

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:06.800
 any? I have met the ones we've made. I think that I mean, exactly. In some sense with synthetic

1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:12.800
 biology, are you not creating aliens? I absolutely think so because look, all of life,

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:19.840
 all of all standard model systems are an end of one course of evolution on Earth, right? And trying

1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:26.880
 to make conclusions about biology from looking at life on Earth is like testing your theory on the

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:32.720
 same data that generated it. It's all it's all kind of like locked in. So we absolutely have to

1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:40.240
 create novel examples that have no history on Earth that don't, you know, xenobots have no

1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:44.560
 history of selection to be a good xenobot. The cells have selection for various things, but the

1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:48.960
 xenobot itself never existed before. And so we can make chimeras, you know, we make frog a lottles

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:53.520
 that are sort of half frog, half axolotl. You can make all sorts of high brats, right constructions

1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:58.640
 of living tissue with robots and whatever. We need to be making these things until we find actual

1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:03.920
 aliens, because otherwise, we're just looking at an end of one set of examples, all kinds of frozen

1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:08.720
 accidents of evolution and so on. We need to go beyond that to really understand biology. But

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:17.040
 we're still even when you do a synthetic biology, you're locked in to the basic components of the

1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:23.760
 way biology is done on this Earth. Yeah, right. And also, and the and also the basic constraints

1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:27.840
 of the environment, even artificial environments to construct in the lab are tied up to the

1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:34.240
 environment. I mean, what do you? Okay, let's say there is I mean, what I think is there's

1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:39.440
 a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations living or dead out there.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:50.320
 If you pick one out of the box, what do you think it would look like? So in when you think about

1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:58.880
 synthetic biology, or creating synthetic organisms, how hard is it to create something that's very

1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:06.320
 different? Yeah, I think it's very hard to create something that's very different, right? It's we

1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:12.400
 are just locked in both both both experimentally and in terms of our imagination, right? It's very

1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:18.000
 hard. And you also emphasize several times that the idea of shape. Yeah, the individual cell get

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:23.920
 together with other cells and they kind of they're gonna build a shape. So it's shape and function,

1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:29.200
 but shape is a critical thing. Yeah. So here, I'll take a stab. I mean, I agree with you. I did

1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:33.600
 to whatever extent that we can say anything, I do think that there's, you know, probably an

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:38.800
 infinite number of, of different different architectures with with that are with interesting

1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:45.840
 cognitive properties out there. What can we say about them? I think that the only things that are

1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:50.880
 going I don't I don't think we can rely on any of the typical stuff, you know, carbon based, none of

1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:56.400
 that. Like, I think all of that is just, you know, us being having having a lack of imagination. But

1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:03.760
 I think the things that are going to be universal, if anything is, are things, for example, driven by

1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:09.280
 resource limitation, the fact that you are fighting a hostile world, and you have to draw a

1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:13.040
 boundary between yourself and the world somewhere, the fact that that boundary is not given to you

1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:18.000
 by anybody, you have to you have to assume it, you know, estimated yourself. And the fact that

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.160
 you have to course grain your experience and the fact that you're going to try to minimize surprise

1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:25.920
 and the fact that like these, these are the things that I think are fundamental about biology,

1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:30.160
 none of the, you know, the facts about the genetic code, or even the fact that we have genes or the

1:36:30.160 --> 1:36:34.160
 biochemistry of it, I don't think any of those things are fundamental. But it's going to be a

1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:38.640
 lot more about the information and about the creation of the self, the fact that so in my in

1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:44.560
 my framework, selves are demarcated by the scale of the goals that they can pursue. So from little

1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:48.640
 tiny local goals to like massive, you know, planetary scale goals for certain humans,

1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:53.280
 and everything and everything in between. So you can draw this like cognitive light cone about

1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:58.960
 that determines the the scale of the goals you could possibly pursue. I think those kinds of

1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:04.080
 frameworks, like that, like active inference, and so on are going to be universally applicable,

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:08.640
 but but none of the other things that are that are typically discussed. Quick pause,

1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:16.320
 do you need a bathroom break? We were just talking about, you know, aliens and all that. That's a

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:20.720
 funny thing, which is, I don't know if you've seen them, there's a kind of debate that goes on about

1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:24.560
 cognition and plants, and what can you say about different kinds of computation and cognition and

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.800
 plants. And I always I always look at that something like if you're weirded out by cognition

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.560
 and plants, you're not ready for exobiology, right? If you know something that's that similar

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:38.960
 here on Earth is already like freaking you out, then I think there's going to be all kinds of

1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:44.080
 cognitive life out there that we're gonna have a really hard time recognizing. I think robots will

1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:54.080
 help us, yeah, like expand our mind about cognition, either that or the word like xenobots. So,

1:37:54.640 --> 1:38:01.920
 and they maybe becomes the same thing is, you know, really, when the human engineers,

1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:08.400
 the thing, at least in part, and then is able to achieve some kind of cognition that's different

1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:14.320
 than what you're used to, then you start to understand like, oh, you know, every living

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:19.680
 organism is capable of cognition. Oh, I need to kind of broaden my understanding what cognition

1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:25.520
 is. But do you think plants, like when you when you eat them, are they screaming? I don't know

1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:30.080
 about screaming. I think you have to see what I think when I eat a salad. Yeah, good. Yeah,

1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:34.560
 I think you have to scale down the expectations in terms of right, so probably they're not

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:39.760
 screaming in the way that we would be screaming. However, there's plenty of data on plants being

1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:46.720
 able to do anticipation and certain kinds of memory and so on. I think, you know, what you

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:51.440
 just said about robots, I hope you're right. And I hope that's but there's two, there's two ways

1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:54.720
 that people can take that right. So one way is exactly what you just said to try to kind of

1:38:54.720 --> 1:39:00.320
 expand their expand their their their notions for that category. The other way people often go is

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.240
 they just sort of define the term is if if if it's not a natural product, it's it's just faking,

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:11.920
 right? It's not really intelligence if it was made by somebody else, because it's that same,

1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:16.160
 it's the same thing. They can see how it's done. And once you see how it's like a magic trick,

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:21.360
 when you see how it's done, it's not as fun anymore. And and I think people have a real

1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:25.280
 tendency for that. And they sort of which which I find really strange in the sense that if somebody

1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:31.920
 said to me, we have this this this sort of blind, like, like, hill climbing search,

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:36.800
 and then and then we have a really smart team of engineers, which one do you think is going to

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:41.680
 produce a system that has good intelligence? I think it's really weird to say that it only

1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:45.600
 comes from the blind search, right? It can't be done by people who, by the way, can also use

1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:49.920
 evolutionary techniques if they want to, but also rational design. I think it's really weird to say

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:55.600
 that real intelligence only comes from natural evolution. So I hope you're right. I hope people

1:39:55.600 --> 1:40:01.360
 take it the other the other way. But there's a nice shortcut. So I work with Lego robots a lot now

1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:13.520
 from for my own personal pleasure. Not in that way internet. So four legs. And one of the things

1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:21.440
 that changes my experience with the robots a lot is when I can't understand why I did a certain

1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:27.680
 thing. And there's a lot of ways to engineer that. Me, the person that created the software that runs

1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:33.120
 it. There's a lot of ways for me to build that software in such a way that I don't exactly know

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:40.160
 why it did a certain basic decision. Of course, as an engineer, you can go in and start to look at

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:45.840
 logs. You can log all kind of data, sensory data, the decisions you made, you know, all the outputs

1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:52.320
 in your networks and so on. But I also try to really experience that surprise and that really

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:57.840
 experience as another person would that totally doesn't know how it's built. And I think the magic

1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:06.960
 is there in not knowing how it works. That I think biology does that for you through the layers of

1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:14.320
 abstraction. Yeah, it because nobody really knows what's going on inside the biological. Like each

1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:20.480
 one component is clueless about the big picture. I think there's actually really cheap systems that

1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:26.640
 can that can illustrate that kind of thing, which is even like, you know, fractals, right? Like,

1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:32.560
 you have a very small, short formula in Z, and you see it and there's no magic, you're just going to

1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:36.960
 crank through, you know, Z squared plus C, whatever, you're just going to crank through it. But the

1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:43.280
 result of it is this incredibly rich, beautiful image, right? That that just like, wow, all of

1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:49.760
 that was in this, like, 10 character long string, like amazing. So the fact that you can you can

1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:54.800
 know everything there is to know about the details and the process and all the parts and every like,

1:41:54.800 --> 1:42:01.120
 there's literally no magic of any kind there. And yet the outcome is something that you would never

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.480
 have expected. And it's just it just, you know, is incredibly rich and complex and beautiful. So

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:13.360
 there's a lot of that. You write that you work on developing conceptual frameworks for understanding

1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:17.840
 unconventional cognition. So the kind of thing we've been talking about, I just like the term

1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:23.440
 unconventional cognition. And you want to figure out how to detect, study and communicate with

1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:29.200
 the thing. You've already mentioned a few examples, but what is unconventional cognition? Is it as

1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:34.880
 simply as everything else outside of what we define usually as cognition, cognitive science,

1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:40.560
 the stuff going on between our ears? Or is there some deeper way to get at the fundamentals of

1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:47.440
 what is cognition? Yeah, I think like, and I'm certainly not the only person who works in

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:53.440
 unconventional, unconventional cognition. So it's the term used? Yeah, that's one that I so I've

1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:56.960
 coined a number of weird terms, but that's not one of mine like that. That's an existing thing. So

1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:00.880
 so for example, somebody like Andy Adam Askey, who I don't know if you've if you've had him on,

1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:05.600
 if you haven't, you should he's a he's a he's a, you know, very interesting guy. He's a computer

1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:10.640
 scientist, and he does unconventional cognition and slime molds, all kinds of weird. He's a real

1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:15.280
 weird, weird cat, really interesting. Anyway, so so that's, you know, it's a bunch of terms that

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:21.600
 I've come up with. But that's not one of mine. So I think like many terms, that one is, is really

1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:26.560
 defined by the times, meaning that unconventional cognitive things that are unconventional cognition

1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:31.920
 today are not going to be considered unconventional cognition at some point. It's one of those,

1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:37.840
 it's one of those things. And so it's, you know, it's, it's, it's this, it's this really deep

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:46.240
 question of how do you recognize, communicate with, classify cognition, when you cannot rely

1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:52.160
 on the typical milestones, right? So typical, you know, again, if you stick with the with the, the

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.640
 history of life on Earth, like these, these exact model systems, you would say, Ah, here's a particular

1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:00.160
 structure of the brain. And this one has fewer of those. And this one has a bigger frontal cortex.

1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:04.640
 And this one, right, so these are these are landmarks that that we're that we're used to,

1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:10.560
 and and allows us to make very kind of rapid judgments about things. But if you can't rely on

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:15.520
 that, either because you're looking at a synthetic thing, or an engineered thing, or an alien thing,

1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.600
 then what do you do? Right? How do you and so and so that's what I'm really interested. I'm

1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:25.040
 interested in mind in all of its possible implementations, not just the obvious ones

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:31.040
 that we know from from looking at brains here on Earth. Whenever I think about something like

1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:36.880
 unconventional cognition, I think about cellular automata, I'm just captivated by the beauty of the

1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:46.480
 thing. The fact that from simple little objects, you can create some such beautiful complexity

1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:53.120
 that very quickly, you forget about the individual objects, and you see the things that it creates

1:44:53.120 --> 1:45:00.800
 as its own organisms. That blows my mind every time. Like, honestly, I could full time just

1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:05.920
 eat mushrooms and watch cellular automata. Don't even have to do mushrooms.

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:13.280
 Just cellular automata. It feels like, I mean, from the engineering perspective, I love

1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:18.320
 when a very simple system captures something really powerful, because then you can study

1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:23.120
 that system to understand something fundamental about complexity about life on Earth.

1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:32.000
 Anyway, how do I communicate with a thing? If cellular automata can do cognition, if a plant

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:40.000
 can do cognition, if a xenobot can do cognition, how do I like whisper in its ear and get an

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:46.880
 answer back to how do I have a conversation? How do I have a xenobot on a podcast?

1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:53.840
 It's a really interesting line of investigation that opens up. I mean, we've thought about this.

1:45:53.840 --> 1:46:00.400
 So you need a few things. You need to understand the space in which they live. So not just the

1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:03.680
 physical modality, like can they see light, can they feel vibration? I mean, that's important,

1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:08.320
 of course, because that's how you deliver your message. But not just the ideas for a communication

1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:16.000
 medium, not just the physical medium, but saliency, right? So what's important to this

1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:22.080
 system? And systems have all kinds of different levels of sophistication of what you could expect

1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:28.080
 to get back. And I think what's really important, I call this the spectrum of persuadability,

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:33.200
 which is this idea that when you're looking at a system, you can't assume where on the spectrum

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:41.440
 it is. You have to do experiments. And so for example, if you look at a gene regulatory network,

1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:45.760
 which is just a bunch of nodes that turn each other on and off at various rates, you might

1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:50.320
 look at that and you say, well, there's no magic here. I mean, clearly this thing is as deterministic

1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:54.320
 as it gets. It's a piece of hardware. The only way we're going to be able to control it is by

1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:57.920
 rewiring it, which is the way molecular biology works, right? We can add nodes, remove nodes,

1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:03.440
 whatever. Well, so we've done simulations and shown that biological, and now we're doing this in the

1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:08.960
 lab, the biological networks like that have associative memory. So they can actually learn,

1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:12.000
 they can learn from experience. They have habituation, they have sensitization, they

1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:15.840
 have associative memory, which you wouldn't have known if you assume that they have to be on the

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:19.520
 left side of that spectrum. So when you're going to communicate with something, and we've even,

1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:26.080
 Charles Abramson and I have written a paper on behaviorist approaches to synthetic organisms,

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:29.600
 meaning that if you're given something, you have no idea what it is or what it can do,

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:34.480
 how do you figure out what its psychology is, what its level is, what does it, and so we literally

1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:38.480
 lay out a set of protocols, starting with the simplest things and then moving up to more complex

1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:42.640
 things where you can make no assumptions about what this thing can do, right? You have to start

1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:47.120
 and you'll find out. So when you're going to, so here's a simple, I mean, here's one way to

1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:51.600
 communicate with something. If you can train it, that's a way of communicating. So if you can

1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:56.160
 provide, if you can figure out what the currency of reward of positive and negative reinforcement is,

1:47:56.160 --> 1:48:01.520
 right, and you can get it to do something it wasn't doing before based on experiences you've

1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:06.080
 given, you have taught it one thing. You have communicated one thing, that such and such an

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:11.520
 action is good, some other action is not good. That's like a basic atom of a primitive atom

1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:19.040
 of communication. What about in some sense, if it gets you to do something you haven't done before,

1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:24.560
 is it answering back? Yeah, most certainly. And there's, I've seen cartoons, I think maybe Gary

1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:29.040
 Larson or somebody had had a cartoon of these rats in the maze and the one rat, you know,

1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:32.720
 assist to the other. You look at this every time, every time I walk over here, he starts scribbling

1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:37.200
 in that on the, you know, on the clipboard that he has, it's awesome. If we step outside ourselves

1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:46.400
 and really measure how much, like if I actually measure how much I've changed because of my

1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:52.400
 interaction with certain cellular automata. I mean, you really have to take that into

1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:58.320
 consideration about like, well, these things are changing you too. Yes. I know, you know how it

1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:04.080
 works and so on, but you're being changed by the thing. Yeah, absolutely. I think I read,

1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:08.640
 I don't know any details, but I think I read something about how wheat and other things

1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:13.520
 have domesticated humans in terms of, right, but by their properties change the way that

1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:19.280
 the human behavior and societal structures. In that sense, cats are running the world

1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:27.200
 because they've took over the, so first off, so first they, while not giving a shit about humans,

1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:35.680
 clearly with every ounce of their being, they've somehow got just millions and millions of humans

1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:43.280
 to take them home and feed them. And then not only the physical space did they take over,

1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:48.640
 they took over the digital space. They dominate the internet in terms of cuteness, in terms of

1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:55.760
 memeability. And so they're like, they got themselves literally inside the memes, they

1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:01.040
 become viral and spread on the internet. And they're the ones that are probably controlling

1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:06.000
 humans. That's my theory. Another, that's a follow up paper after the frog kissing. Okay.

1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:18.000
 I mean, you mentioned sentience and consciousness. You have a paper titled Generalizing Frameworks

1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:30.320
 for Sentience Beyond Natural Species. So beyond normal cognition, if we look at sentience and

1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:34.000
 consciousness, and I wonder if you draw an interesting distinction between those two

1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:44.560
 elsewhere, outside of humans, and maybe outside of Earth, you think aliens have sentience. And

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.880
 if they do, how do we think about it? So when you have this framework, what is this paper? What is

1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:57.040
 the way you propose to think about sentience? Yeah, that particular paper was a very short

1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:01.280
 commentary on another paper that was written about crabs. It was a really good paper on them,

1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:07.760
 crabs and various, like a rubric of different types of behaviors that could be applied to

1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:13.440
 different creatures, and they're trying to apply it to crabs and so on. Consciousness,

1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:18.400
 we can talk about if you want, but it's a whole separate kettle of fish. I almost never talk about

1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:24.240
 crabs. In this case, yes. I almost never talk about consciousness, per se. I've said very,

1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:29.120
 very little about it, but we can talk about it if you want. Mostly what I talk about is cognition,

1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:36.240
 because I think that that's much easier to deal with in a kind of rigorous experimental way.

1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:45.040
 I think that all of these terms have, you know, sentience and so on, have different definitions,

1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:52.480
 and I fundamentally, I think that people can, as long as they specify what they mean ahead of time,

1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:58.480
 I think people can define them in various ways. The only thing that I really think

1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:04.960
 that I really kind of insist on is that the right way to think about all this stuff is

1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:12.640
 from an engineering perspective. What does it help me to control, predict, and does it help

1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:20.720
 me do my next experiment? That's not a universal perspective. Some people have philosophical

1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:25.600
 kind of underpinnings, and those are primary, and if anything runs against that, then it must

1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:31.440
 automatically be wrong. Some people will say, I don't care what else. If your theory says to me

1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:38.560
 that thermostats have little tiny goals, I'm not, so that's it. That's my philosophical

1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:43.200
 preconception. Thermostats do not have goals, and that's it. That's one way of doing it,

1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:46.400
 and some people do it that way. I do not do it that way, and I think that we can't,

1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:51.440
 I don't think we can know much of anything from a philosophical armchair. I think that

1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:57.280
 all of these theories and ways of doing things stand or fall based on just basically one set

1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:01.040
 of criteria. Does it help you run a rich research program? That's it.

1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:08.240
 I agree with you totally, but forget philosophy. What about the poetry of ambiguity? What about

1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:14.800
 at the limits of the things you can engineer using terms that can be defined in multiple ways

1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:22.720
 and living within that uncertainty in order to play with words until something lands that you

1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:27.600
 can engineer? I mean, that's to me where consciousness sits currently. Nobody really

1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:33.360
 understands the heart problem of consciousness, the subject, what it feels like, because it really

1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:39.040
 feels like, it feels like something to be this biological system. This conglomerate of a bunch

1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:44.800
 of cells in this hierarchy of competencies feels like something, and yeah, I feel like one thing,

1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:58.720
 and is that just a side effect of a complex system, or is there something more that humans have,

1:53:58.720 --> 1:54:03.680
 or is there something more that any biological system has? Some kind of magic, some kind of,

1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:10.560
 not just a sense of agency, but a real sense with a capital letter S of agency.

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:11.120
 Yeah.

1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:13.760
 Ah, boy, yeah, that's a deep question.

1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:16.640
 Is there room for poetry in engineering or no?

1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:22.240
 No, there definitely is, and a lot of the poetry comes in when we realize that none of the

1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:29.680
 categories we deal with are sharp as we think they are, right? And so in the different areas of all

1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:34.160
 these spectra are where a lot of the poetry sits, I have many new theories about things,

1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:38.400
 but I, in fact, do not have a good theory about consciousness that I plan to trot out.

1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:42.800
 And you almost don't see it as useful for your current work to think about consciousness?

1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:46.160
 I think it will come. I have some thoughts about it, but I don't feel like they're going to move

1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:47.520
 the needle yet on that.

1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:50.720
 And you want to ground it in engineering always.

1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:58.240
 So, well, I mean, so if we really tackle consciousness per se, in the terms of the

1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:04.160
 hard problem, that isn't necessarily going to be groundable in engineering, right? That

1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:10.400
 aspect of cognition is, but actual consciousness per se, first person perspective, I'm not sure

1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:16.480
 that that's groundable in engineering. And I think specifically what's different about it is

1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:20.080
 there's a couple of things. So let's, you know, here we go. I'll say a couple of things about

1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:28.000
 consciousness. One thing is that what makes it different is that for every other thing,

1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:35.200
 other aspect of science, when we think about having a correct or a good theory of it,

1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:41.360
 we have some idea of what format that theory makes predictions in. So whether those be numbers

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:45.200
 or whatever, we have some idea. We may not know the answer, we may not have the theory,

1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:49.120
 but we know that when we get the theory, here's what it's going to output, and then we'll know

1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:54.320
 if it's right or wrong. For actual consciousness, not behavior, not neural correlates, but actual

1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:59.280
 first person consciousness. If we had a correct theory of consciousness, or even a good one,

1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:05.440
 what the hell would, what format would it make predictions in, right? Because all the things

1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:10.640
 that we know about basically boil down to observable behaviors. So the only thing I can

1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:19.920
 think of when I think about that is, it'll be poetry, or it'll be something to, if I ask you,

1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:23.920
 okay, you've got a great theory of consciousness, and here's this creature, maybe it's a natural one,

1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:28.720
 maybe it's an engineered one, whatever. And I want you to tell me what your theory says about this

1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:36.640
 being, what it's like to be this being. The only thing I can imagine you giving me is some piece

1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:45.600
 of art, a poem or something, that once I've taken it in, I share, I now have a similar state as

1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:51.360
 whatever. That's about as good as I can come up with. Well, it's possible that once you have a

1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:56.240
 good understanding of consciousness, it would be mapped to some things that are more measurable.

1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:07.440
 So for example, it's possible that a conscious being is one that's able to suffer. So you start

1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:16.400
 to look at pain and suffering. You can start to connect it closer to things that you can measure

1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:25.760
 that, in terms of how they reflect themselves in behavior and problem solving and creation and

1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:31.520
 attainment of goals, for example, which I think suffering is one of the, you know, life is suffering.

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:40.720
 It's one of the big aspects of the human condition. And so if consciousness is somehow a,

1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:48.080
 maybe at least a catalyst for suffering, you could start to get like echoes of it. You start to see

1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:52.880
 like the actual effects of consciousness and behavior. That it's not just about subjective

1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:59.120
 experience. It's like it's really deeply integrated in the problem solving decision making of a

1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:06.000
 system, something like this. But also it's possible that we realize, this is not a philosophical

1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:13.360
 statement. Philosophers can write their books. I welcome it. You know, I take the Turing test

1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:20.800
 really seriously. I don't know why people really don't like it. When a robot convinces you that

1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:26.080
 it's intelligent, I think that's a really incredible accomplishment. And there's some deep

1:58:26.080 --> 1:58:32.560
 sense in which that is intelligence. If it looks like it's intelligent, it is intelligent. And I

1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:43.600
 think there's some deep aspect of a system that appears to be conscious. In some deep sense,

1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:51.520
 it is conscious. At least for me, we have to consider that possibility. And a system that

1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:58.480
 appears to be conscious is an engineering challenge. Yeah, I don't disagree with any of

1:58:58.480 --> 1:59:06.080
 that. I mean, especially intelligence, I think, is a publicly observable thing. Science fiction

1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:12.400
 has dealt with this for a century or much more, maybe. This idea that when you are confronted with

1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:17.760
 something that just doesn't meet any of your typical assumptions, so you can't look in the

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:23.280
 skull and say, oh, well, there's that frontal cortex, so then I guess we're good. So this thing

1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:30.160
 lands on your front lawn, and the little door opens, and something trundles out, and it's shiny

1:59:30.160 --> 1:59:35.520
 and aluminum looking, and it hands you this poem that it wrote while it was flying over,

1:59:35.520 --> 1:59:40.960
 and how happy it is to meet you. What's going to be your criteria for whether you get to take it

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:46.000
 apart and see what makes it tick, or whether you have to be nice to it and whatever? All the

1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:51.280
 criteria that we have now and that people are using, and as you said, a lot of people are

1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:55.920
 down on the Turing test and things like this, but what else have we got? Because measuring

1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:03.280
 the cortex size isn't going to cut it in the broader scheme of things. So I think it's a

2:00:03.280 --> 2:00:11.360
 wide open problem. Our solution to the problem of other minds, it's very simplistic. We give each

2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:15.840
 other credit for having minds just because we're sort of on an anatomical level, we're pretty

2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:21.360
 similar, and so it's good enough. But how far is that going to go? So I think that's really primitive.

2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:28.960
 So yeah, I think it's a major unsolved problem. It's a really challenging direction of thought

2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:36.640
 to the human race that you talked about, like embodied minds. If you start to think that other

2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:43.360
 things other than humans have minds, that's really challenging. Because all men are created equal

2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:52.320
 starts being like, all right, well, we should probably treat not just cows with respect,

2:00:52.960 --> 2:01:02.400
 but like plants, and not just plants, but some kind of organized conglomerates of cells

2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:08.960
 in a petri dish. In fact, some of the work we're doing, like you're doing and the whole community

2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:13.760
 of science is doing with biology, people might be like, we were really mean to viruses.

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:20.320
 Yeah. I mean, yeah, the thing is, you're right. And I certainly get phone calls about people

2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:26.560
 complaining about frog skin and so on. But I think we have to separate the sort of deep

2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:30.560
 philosophical aspects versus what actually happens. So what actually happens on Earth

2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:37.280
 is that people with exactly the same anatomical structure kill each other on a daily basis.

2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:43.680
 So I think it's clear that simply knowing that something else is equally or maybe more

2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:51.120
 cognitive or conscious than you are is not a guarantee of kind behavior, that much we know of.

2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:56.880
 And so then we look at a commercial farming of mammals and various other things. And so I think

2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:03.120
 on a practical basis, long before we get to worrying about things like frog skin,

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:08.400
 we have to ask ourselves, why are we, what can we do about the way that we've been behaving

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:13.280
 towards creatures, which we know for a fact, because of our similarities are basically just

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:18.880
 like us. That's kind of a whole other social thing. But fundamentally, of course, you're

2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:24.720
 absolutely right in that we are also, think about this, we are on this planet in some way,

2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:31.360
 incredibly lucky. It's just dumb luck that we really only have one dumb animal.

2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:37.200
 We only have one dominant species. It didn't have to work out that way. So you could easily

2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:43.360
 imagine that there could be a planet somewhere with more than one equally or maybe near equally

2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:49.200
 intelligent species. But they may not look anything like each other. So there may be

2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:54.960
 multiple ecosystems where there are things of similar to human like intelligence. And then

2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:59.840
 you'd have all kinds of issues about how do you relate to them when they're physically

2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:04.960
 like you at all. But yet in terms of behavior and culture and whatever, it's pretty obvious

2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:09.600
 that they've got as much on the ball as you have. Or maybe imagine that there was another

2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:18.320
 group of beings that was on average 40 IQ points lower. We're pretty lucky in many ways. We don't

2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:24.400
 really have, even though we still act badly in many ways. But the fact is, all humans are more

2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:30.160
 or less in that same range, but didn't have to work out that way. Well, but I think that's part

2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:38.800
 of the way life works on Earth, maybe human civilization works, is it seems like we want

2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:45.280
 ourselves to be quite similar. And then within that, you know, where everybody's about the same

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:49.840
 relatively IQ, intelligence, problem solving capabilities, even physical characteristics.

2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:56.400
 But then we'll find some aspect of that that's different. And that seems to be like,

2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:06.560
 I mean, it's really dark to say, but that seems to be the, not even a bug, but like a feature

2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:14.960
 of the early development of human civilization. You pick the other, your tribe versus the other

2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:22.640
 tribe and you war, it's a kind of evolution in the space of memes, a space of ideas, I think,

2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:28.240
 and you war with each other. So we're very good at finding the other, even when the characteristics

2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:35.040
 are really the same. And that's, I don't know what that, I mean, I'm sure so many of these things

2:04:35.040 --> 2:04:41.600
 echo in the biological world in some way. Yeah. There's a fun experiment that I did. My son

2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:46.880
 actually came up with this and we did a biology unit together. He's a homeschool. And so we did

2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:50.800
 this a couple of years ago. We did this thing where, imagine you get this slime mold, right?

2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:57.600
 Fisarum polycephalum, and it grows on a Petri dish of agar and it sort of spreads out and it's a

2:04:57.600 --> 2:05:02.160
 single cell protist, but it's like this giant thing. And so you put down a piece of oat and

2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:05.760
 it wants to go get the oat and it sort of grows towards the oat. So what you do is you take a

2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:10.160
 razor blade and you just separate the piece of the whole culture that's growing towards the

2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:15.040
 oat. You just kind of separate it. And so now think about the interesting decision making

2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:20.960
 calculus for that little piece. I can go get the oat and therefore I won't have to share those

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:25.280
 nutrients with this giant mass over there. So the nutrients per unit volume is going to be amazing.

2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:30.560
 I should go eat the oat. But if I first rejoin, because Fisarum, once you cut it, has the ability

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:36.240
 to join back up. If I first rejoin, then that whole calculus becomes impossible because there

2:05:36.240 --> 2:05:40.960
 is no more me anymore. There's just we and then we will go eat this thing, right? So this

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:46.320
 interesting, you can imagine a kind of game theory where the number of agents isn't fixed

2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:50.320
 and that it's not just cooperate or defect, but it's actually merge and whatever, right?

2:05:50.320 --> 2:05:54.400
 Yeah. So that computation, how does it do that decision making?

2:05:54.400 --> 2:06:00.240
 Yeah. So it's really interesting. And so empirically, what we found is that it tends

2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:04.720
 to merge first. It tends to merge first and then the whole thing goes. But it's really interesting

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:09.600
 that that calculus, I mean, I'm not an expert in the economic game theory and all that,

2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:14.880
 but maybe there's some sort of hyperbolic discounting or something. But maybe this idea

2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:22.720
 that the actions you take not only change your payoff, but they change who or what you are,

2:06:22.720 --> 2:06:27.440
 and that you could take an action after which you don't exist anymore, or you are radically

2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:33.280
 changed, or you are merged with somebody else. As far as I know, that's a whole different

2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:38.720
 thing. As far as I know, we're still missing a formalism for even knowing how to model

2:06:38.720 --> 2:06:39.720
 any of that.

2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:45.200
 Do you see evolution, by the way, as a process that applies here on Earth? Where did evolution

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:46.200
 come from?

2:06:46.200 --> 2:06:47.200
 Yeah.

2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:54.560
 So this thing from the very origin of life that took us to today, what the heck is that?

2:06:54.560 --> 2:07:00.960
 I think evolution is inevitable in the sense that if you combine, and basically, I think

2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:05.600
 one of the most useful things that was done in early computing, I guess in the 60s, it

2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:13.320
 started with evolutionary computation and just showing how simple it is that if you have

2:07:13.320 --> 2:07:19.280
 imperfect heredity and competition together, those two things, or three things, so heredity,

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:25.000
 imperfect heredity, and competition, or selection, those three things, and that's it. Now you're

2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:29.640
 off to the races. And so that can be, it's not just on Earth because it can be done in

2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:33.480
 the computer, it can be done in chemical systems, it can be done in, you know, Lee Smolin says

2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:42.400
 it works on cosmic scales. So I think that that kind of thing is incredibly pervasive

2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:49.200
 and general. It's a general feature of life. It's interesting to think about, you know,

2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:55.280
 the standard thought about this is that it's blind, right? Meaning that the intelligence

2:07:55.280 --> 2:08:01.520
 of the process is zero, it's stumbling around. And I think that back in the day, when the

2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:07.560
 options were it's dumb like machines, or it's smart like humans, then of course, the scientists

2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:10.680
 went in this direction, because nobody wanted creationism. They said, okay, it's got to

2:08:10.680 --> 2:08:15.920
 be like completely blind. I'm not actually sure, right? Because I think that everything

2:08:15.920 --> 2:08:20.880
 is a continuum. And I think that it doesn't have to be smart with foresight like us, but

2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:25.720
 it doesn't have to be completely blind either. I think there may be aspects of it. And in

2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:30.760
 particular, this kind of multi scale competency might give it a little bit of look ahead maybe

2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:36.700
 or a little bit of problem solving sort of baked in. But that's going to be completely

2:08:36.700 --> 2:08:41.640
 different in different systems. I do think it's general. I don't think it's just on Earth.

2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:44.040
 I think it's a very fundamental thing.

2:08:44.040 --> 2:08:50.120
 And it does seem to have a kind of direction that it's taking us that's somehow perhaps

2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:57.360
 is defined by the environment itself. It feels like we're headed towards something. Like,

2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:03.060
 we're playing out a script that was just like a single cell defines the entire organism.

2:09:03.060 --> 2:09:10.480
 It feels like from the origin of Earth itself, it's playing out a kind of script. You can't

2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:12.480
 really go any other way.

2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:17.280
 I mean, so this is very controversial, and I don't know the answer. But people have argued

2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:22.720
 that this is called, you know, sort of rewinding the tape of life, right? And some people have

2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:28.440
 argued, I think, I think Conway Morris, maybe has argued that it is that there's a deep

2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:34.640
 attractor, for example, to human to the human kind of structure and that and that if you

2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:37.560
 were to rewind it again, you'd basically get more or less the same thing. And then other

2:09:37.560 --> 2:09:41.920
 people have argued that, no, it's incredibly sensitive to frozen accidents. And then once

2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:46.200
 certain stochastic decisions are made downstream, everything is going to be different. I don't

2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:52.760
 know. I don't know. You know, we're very bad at predicting attractors in the space of complex

2:09:52.760 --> 2:09:56.880
 systems, generally speaking, right? We don't know. So maybe, so maybe evolution on Earth

2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:01.360
 has these deep attractors that no matter what has happened, it pretty much would likely

2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:03.640
 to end up there or maybe not. I don't know.

2:10:03.640 --> 2:10:10.880
 What's a really difficult idea to imagine that if you ran Earth a million times, 500,000

2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:17.160
 times you would get Hitler? Like, yeah, we don't like to think like that. We think like,

2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:23.480
 because at least maybe in America, you'd like to think that individual decisions can change

2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:30.760
 the world. And if individual decisions could change the world, then surely any perturbation

2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:38.560
 could result in a totally different trajectory. But maybe there's a, in this competency hierarchy,

2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:43.320
 it's a self correcting system. There's just ultimately, there's a bunch of chaos that

2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:47.200
 ultimately is leading towards something like a super intelligent, artificial intelligence

2:10:47.200 --> 2:10:56.800
 system that answers 42. I mean, there might be a kind of imperative for life that it's

2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:04.360
 headed to. And we're too focused on our day to day life of getting coffee and snacks and

2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:12.840
 having sex and getting a promotion at work, not to see the big imperative of life on Earth

2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:14.560
 that is headed towards something.

2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:24.640
 Yeah, maybe, maybe. It's difficult. I think one of the things that's important about Chimerica

2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:29.520
 bioengineering technologies, all of those things are that we have to start developing

2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:35.240
 a better science of predicting the cognitive goals of composite systems. So we're just

2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:41.320
 not very good at it, right? We don't know if I create a composite system, and this could

2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:48.240
 be Internet of Things or swarm robotics or a cellular swarm or whatever. What is the

2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:51.640
 emergent intelligence of this thing? First of all, what level is it going to be at? And

2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:56.240
 if it has goal directed capacity, what are the goals going to be? Like, we are just not

2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:06.420
 very good at predicting that yet. And I think that it's an existential level need for us

2:12:06.420 --> 2:12:10.520
 to be able to because we're building these things all the time, right? We're building

2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:16.060
 both physical structures like swarm robotics, and we're building social financial structures

2:12:16.060 --> 2:12:21.640
 and so on, with very little ability to predict what sort of autonomous goals that system

2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:26.780
 is going to have, of which we are now cogs. And so learning to predict and control those

2:12:26.780 --> 2:12:31.400
 things is going to be critical. So in fact, if you're right and there is some kind of

2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:36.680
 attractor to evolution, it would be nice to know what that is and then to make a rational

2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:39.800
 decision of whether we're going to go along or we're going to pop out of it or try to

2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:44.120
 pop out of it because there's no guarantee. I mean, that's the other kind of important

2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:49.760
 thing. A lot of people, I get a lot of complaints from people who email me and say, you know,

2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:56.240
 what you're doing, it isn't natural. And I'll say, look, natural, that'd be nice if somebody

2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:02.520
 was making sure that natural was matched up to our values, but no one's doing that. Evolution

2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:07.160
 optimizes for biomass. That's it. Nobody's optimizing. It's not optimizing for your happiness.

2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:11.600
 I don't think necessarily it's optimizing for intelligence or fairness or any of that

2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:12.600
 stuff.

2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:18.720
 I'm going to find that person that emailed you, beat them up, take their place, steal

2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:22.040
 everything they own and say, no, this is natural.

2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:28.200
 This is natural. Yeah, exactly. Because it comes from an old worldview where you could

2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:32.040
 assume that whatever is natural, that that's probably for the best. And I think we're long

2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:37.000
 out of that garden of Eden kind of view. So I think we can do better. I think we, and

2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:42.020
 we have to, right? Natural just isn't great for a lot of life forms.

2:13:42.020 --> 2:13:46.520
 What are some cool synthetic organisms that you think about, you dream about? When you

2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:51.400
 think about embodied mind, what do you imagine? What do you hope to build?

2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:57.700
 Yeah, on a practical level, what I really hope to do is to gain enough of an understanding

2:13:57.700 --> 2:14:04.680
 of the embodied intelligence of the organs and tissues such that we can achieve a radically

2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:11.080
 different regenerative medicine so that we can say, basically, and I think about it as,

2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:18.200
 you know, in terms of like, okay, can you, what's the goal kind of end game for this

2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:22.480
 whole thing? To me, the end game is something that you would call an anatomical compiler.

2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:27.440
 So the idea is you would sit down in front of the computer and you would draw the body

2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:31.880
 or the organ that you wanted. Not molecular details, but like, yeah, this is what I want.

2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:36.200
 I want a six legged, you know, frog with a propeller on top, or I want a heart that looks

2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:39.800
 like this, or I want a leg that looks like this. And what it would do if we knew what

2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:47.000
 we were doing is put out, convert that anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would

2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:51.320
 have to be given to cells to convince them to build exactly that thing, right? I probably

2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:56.840
 won't live to see it, but I think it's achievable. And I think with that, if we can have that,

2:14:56.840 --> 2:15:03.140
 then that is basically the solution to all of medicine except for infectious disease.

2:15:03.140 --> 2:15:07.620
 So birth defects, right? Traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease. If we

2:15:07.620 --> 2:15:11.440
 knew how to tell cells what to build, all of those things go away. So those things go

2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:18.520
 away. And the positive feedback spiral of economic costs, where all of the advances

2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:22.880
 are increasingly more heroic and expensive interventions of a sinking ship when you're

2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:26.980
 like 90 and so on, right? All of that goes away because basically, instead of trying

2:15:26.980 --> 2:15:33.800
 to fix you up as you degrade, you progressively regenerate, you apply the regenerative medicine

2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:38.920
 early before things degrade. So I think that that'll have massive economic impacts over

2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:43.800
 what we're trying to do now, which is not at all sustainable. And that's what I hope.

2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:50.080
 I hope that we get it. So to me, yes, the xenobots will be doing useful things, cleaning

2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:55.480
 up the environment, cleaning out your joints and all that kind of stuff. But more important

2:15:55.480 --> 2:16:04.920
 than that, I think we can use these synthetic systems to try to develop a science of detecting

2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:10.840
 and manipulating the goals of collective intelligences of cells specifically for regenerative medicine.

2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:15.840
 And then sort of beyond that, if we think further beyond that, what I hope is that kind

2:16:15.840 --> 2:16:22.480
 of like what you said, all of this drives a reconsideration of how we formulate ethical

2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:29.080
 norms because this old school, so in the olden days, what you could do is if you were confronted

2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:33.200
 with something, you could tap on it, right? And if you heard a metallic clanging sound,

2:16:33.200 --> 2:16:37.160
 you'd say, ah, fine, right? So you could conclude it was made in a factory. I can take it apart.

2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:40.960
 I can do whatever, right? If you did that and you got sort of a squishy kind of warm

2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:46.080
 sensation, you'd say, ah, I need to be more or less nice to it and whatever. That's not

2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:49.360
 going to be feasible. It was never really feasible, but it was good enough because we

2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:55.940
 didn't have any, we didn't know any better. That needs to go. And I think that by breaking

2:16:55.940 --> 2:17:03.200
 down those artificial barriers, someday we can try to build a system of ethical norms

2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:08.740
 that does not rely on these completely contingent facts of our earthly history, but on something

2:17:08.740 --> 2:17:15.520
 much, much deeper that really takes agency and the capacity to suffer and all that takes

2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:16.520
 that seriously.

2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:21.560
 The capacity to suffer and the deep questions I would ask of a system is can I eat it and

2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:30.560
 can I have sex with it? Which is the two fundamental tests of, again, the human condition. So I

2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:39.480
 can basically do what Dali does that's in the physical space. So print out like a 3D

2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:46.320
 print Pepe the Frog with a propeller head, propeller hat is the dream.

2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:50.840
 Well yes and no. I mean, I want to get away from the 3D printing thing because that will

2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:55.560
 be available for some things much earlier. I mean, we can already do bladders and ears

2:17:55.560 --> 2:17:59.920
 and things like that because it's micro level control, right? When you 3D print, you are

2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:02.960
 in charge of where every cell goes. And for some things that, you know, for, for like

2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:06.040
 this thing, they had that I think 20 years ago or maybe earlier than that, you could

2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:07.040
 do that.

2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:11.480
 So yeah, I would like to emphasize the Dali part where you provide a few words and it

2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:19.920
 generates a painting. So here you say, I want a frog with these features and then it would

2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:25.000
 go direct a complex biological system to construct something like that.

2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:30.040
 Yeah. The main magic would be, I mean, I think from, from looking at Dali and so on, it looks

2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:34.360
 like the first part is kind of solved now where you go from, from the words to the image,

2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:39.920
 like that seems more or less solved. The next step is really hard. This is what keeps things

2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:46.880
 like CRISPR and genomic editing and so on. That's what limits all the impacts for regenerative

2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:51.320
 medicine because going back to, okay, this is the knee joint that I want, or this is

2:18:51.320 --> 2:18:56.000
 the eye that I want. Now, what genes do I edit to make that happen, right? Going back

2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:59.840
 in that direction is really hard. So instead of that, it's going to be, okay, I understand

2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:03.680
 how to motivate cells to build particular structures. Can I rewrite the memory of what

2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:07.480
 they think they're supposed to be building such that then I can, you know, take my hands

2:19:07.480 --> 2:19:09.960
 off the wheel and let them, let them do their thing.

2:19:09.960 --> 2:19:13.960
 So some of that is experiment, but some of that may be AI can help too. Just like with

2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:23.400
 protein folding, this is exactly the problem that protein folding in the most simple medium

2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:31.800
 tried and has solved with alpha fold, which is how does the sequence of letters result

2:19:31.800 --> 2:19:37.160
 in this three dimensional shape? And you have to, I guess it didn't solve it because you

2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:43.760
 have to, if you say, I want this shape, how do I then have a sequence of letters? Yeah.

2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:45.920
 The reverse engineering step is really tricky.

2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:51.680
 It is. I think, I think we're, we're, and we're doing some of this now is, is to use

2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:57.800
 AI to try and build actionable models of the intelligence of the cellular collectives.

2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:02.400
 So try to help us and help us gain models that, that, that, and, and we've had some

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:08.480
 success in this. So we, we did something like this for, for, you know, for repairing birth

2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:14.240
 defects of the brain in frog. We've done some of this for normalizing melanoma where you

2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:20.140
 can really start to use AI to make models of how would I impact this thing if I wanted

2:20:20.140 --> 2:20:25.600
 to given all the complexities, right. And, and, and given all the, the, the, the controls

2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:27.520
 that it, that it knows how to do.

2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:34.060
 So when you say regenerative medicine, so we talked about creating biological organisms,

2:20:34.060 --> 2:20:41.440
 but if you regrow a hand, that information is already there, right? The biological system

2:20:41.440 --> 2:20:48.080
 has that information. So how does regenerative medicine work today? How do you hope it works?

2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:49.080
 What's the hope there?

2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:50.080
 Yeah.

2:20:50.080 --> 2:20:52.480
 Yeah. How do you make it happen?

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:57.480
 Well today there's a set of popular approaches. So, so one is 3d printing. So the idea is

2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:00.600
 I'm going to make a scaffold of the thing that I want. I'm going to seed it with cells

2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:03.760
 and then, and then there it is, right? So kind of direct, and then that works for certain

2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:08.920
 things. You can make a bladder that way or an ear, something like that. The other, the

2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:14.300
 other ideas is some sort of stem cell transplant. These are the ideas. If we, if we put in stem

2:21:14.300 --> 2:21:17.920
 cells with appropriate factors, we can get them to generate certain kinds of neurons

2:21:17.920 --> 2:21:24.760
 for certain diseases and so on. All of those things are good for relatively simple structures,

2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:30.660
 but when you want an eye or a hand or something else, I think in this maybe an unpopular opinion,

2:21:30.660 --> 2:21:36.560
 I think the only hope we have in any reasonable kind of timeframe is to understand how the

2:21:36.560 --> 2:21:41.320
 thing was motivated to get made in the first place. So what is it that, that made those

2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:48.400
 cells in the, in the beginning, create a particular arm with a particular set of sizes and shapes

2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:51.760
 and number of fingers and all that. And why is it that a salamander can keep losing theirs

2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:57.640
 and keep regrowing theirs and a planarian can do the same even more? So to me, uh, kind

2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:02.840
 of ultimate regenerate medicine was when you can tell the cells to build whatever it is

2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:07.400
 you need them to build. Right. And so the, so that we can all be like planaria basically,

2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:13.680
 do you have to start at the very beginning or can you, um, do a shortcut? Cause we're

2:22:13.680 --> 2:22:19.560
 going to hand, you already got the whole organism. Yeah. So here's what we've done, right? So,

2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:24.160
 we've, we've more or less solved that in frogs. So frogs, unlike salamanders do not regenerate

2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:31.800
 their legs as adults. And so, so, uh, we've shown that with a very, um, uh, kind of simple

2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:36.100
 intervention. So what we do is there's two things you need to, uh, you need to have a

2:22:36.100 --> 2:22:39.520
 signal that tells the cells what to do, and then you need some way of delivering it. And

2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:44.080
 so this is work together with, um, with David Kaplan and I should do a, um, a disclosure

2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:48.200
 here. We have a company called morphosuticals and spin off where we're trying to, uh, to

2:22:48.200 --> 2:22:52.320
 address, uh, uh, regenerate, you know, limb regeneration. So we've solved it in the frog

2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:56.440
 and we're now in trials and mice. So now we're going to, we're in mammals now. It's, I can't

2:22:56.440 --> 2:22:59.720
 say anything about how it's going, but the frog thing is solved. So what you do is, um,

2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:04.480
 after you have a little frog, Lou Skywalker with every growing hand. Yeah, basically,

2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:07.840
 basically. Yeah. Yeah. So what you do is we did, we did with legs instead of forearms.

2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:11.200
 And what you do is, um, after amputation, normally they, they don't regenerate. You

2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:15.620
 put on a wearable bioreactor. So it's this thing that, um, that goes on and, uh, Dave

2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:21.300
 Kaplan does lab makes these things and inside it's a, it's a very controlled environment.

2:23:21.300 --> 2:23:26.360
 It is a silk gel that carries, uh, some drugs, for example, ion channel drugs. And what you're

2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:33.720
 doing is you're saying to the cells, you should regrow what normally goes here. So, uh, that

2:23:33.720 --> 2:23:37.760
 whole thing is on for 24 hours and you take it off and you don't touch the leg. Again,

2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:41.280
 this is really important because what we're not looking for is a set of micromanagement,

2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:45.600
 uh, you know, printing or controlling the cells we want to trigger. We want to, we want

2:23:45.600 --> 2:23:49.260
 to interact with it early on and then not touch it again because, because we don't know

2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:54.820
 how to make a frog leg, but the frog knows how to make a frog leg. So 24 hours, 18 months

2:23:54.820 --> 2:23:58.480
 of leg growth after that, without us touching it again. And after 18 months, you get a pretty

2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:02.720
 good leg that kind of shows this proof of concept that early on when the cells right

2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:05.560
 after injury, when they're first making a decision about what they're going to do, you

2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:09.440
 can, you can impact them. And once they've decided to make a leg, they don't need you

2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:14.040
 after that. They can do their own thing. So that's an approach that we're now taking.

2:24:14.040 --> 2:24:18.480
 What about cancer suppression? That's something you mentioned earlier. How can all of these

2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:20.360
 ideas help with cancer suppression?

2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:23.600
 So let's, let's go back to the beginning and ask what, what, what, what cancer is. So I

2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:28.520
 think, um, you know, asking why there's cancer is the wrong question. I think the right question

2:24:28.520 --> 2:24:33.420
 is why is there ever anything but cancer? So, so in the normal state, you have a bunch

2:24:33.420 --> 2:24:38.680
 of cells that are all cooperating towards a large scale goal. If that process of cooperation

2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:42.780
 breaks down and you've got a cell that is isolated from that electrical network that

2:24:42.780 --> 2:24:47.280
 lets you remember what the big goal is, you revert back to your unicellular lifestyle

2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:51.020
 as far as, now think about that border between self and world, right? Normally when all these

2:24:51.020 --> 2:24:56.360
 cells are connected by gap junctions into an electrical network, they are all one self,

2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:01.600
 right? That meaning that, um, their goals, they have these large tissue level goals and

2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:06.760
 so on. As soon as a cell is disconnected from that, the self is tiny, right? And so at that

2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:11.580
 point, and so, so people, a lot of people model cancer cell cells as being more selfish

2:25:11.580 --> 2:25:14.280
 and all that. They're not more selfish. They're equally selfish. It's just that their self

2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:18.040
 is smaller. Normally the self is huge. Now they got tiny little selves. Now what are

2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:22.680
 the goals of tiny little selves? Well, proliferate, right? And migrate to wherever life is good.

2:25:22.680 --> 2:25:26.640
 And that's metastasis. That's proliferation and metastasis. So, so one thing we found

2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:31.960
 and people have noticed years ago that when cells convert to cancer, the first thing they

2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:36.800
 see is they close the gap junctions. And it's a lot like, I think it's a lot like that experiment

2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:41.440
 with the slime mold where until you close that gap junction, you can't even entertain

2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:44.520
 the idea of leaving the collective because there is no you at that point, right? Your

2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:48.600
 mind melded with this, with this whole other network. But as soon as the gap junction is

2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:53.600
 closed, now the boundary between you and now, now the rest of the body is just outside environment

2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:58.520
 to you. You're just a, you're just a unicellular organism and the rest of the body's environment.

2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:04.840
 So, so we, so we studied this process and we worked out a way to artificially control

2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:10.120
 the bioelectric state of these cells to physically force them to remain in that network. And

2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:15.580
 so then, then what that, what that means is that nasty mutations like KRAS and things

2:26:15.580 --> 2:26:20.920
 like that, these really tough oncogenic mutations that cause tumors. If you, if you do them

2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:29.120
 and then, but then within artificially control of the bioelectrics, you greatly reduce tumor

2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:33.840
 genesis or, or normalize cells that had already begun to convert. You basically, they go back

2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:38.080
 to being normal cells. And so this is another, much like with the planaria, this is another

2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:43.400
 way in which the bioelectric state kind of dominates what the, what the genetic state

2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:47.200
 is. So if you sequence the, you know, if you sequence the nucleic acid, you'll see the

2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:50.800
 KRAS mutation, you'll say, ah, well that's going to be a tumor, but there isn't a tumor

2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:54.200
 because, because bioelectrically you've kept the cells connected and they're just working

2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:59.760
 on making nice skin and kidneys and whatever else. So, so we've started moving that to,

2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:04.760
 to, to human glioblastoma cells and we're hoping for, you know, a patient in the future

2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:07.560
 interaction with patients.

2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.820
 So is this one of the possible ways in which we may quote cure cancer?

2:27:12.820 --> 2:27:17.160
 I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think, I think the actual cure, I mean, there are other technology,

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:21.920
 you know, immune therapy, I think is a great technology. Chemotherapy, I don't think is

2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:25.680
 a good, is a good technology. I think we've got to get, get off of that.

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:27.720
 So chemotherapy just kills cells.

2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:32.920
 Yeah. Well, chemotherapy hopes to kill more of the tumor cells than of your cells. That's

2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:36.440
 it. It's a fine balance. The problem is the cells are very similar because they are your

2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:43.480
 cells. And so if you don't have a very tight way of distinguishing between them, then the

2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:46.240
 toll that chemo takes on the rest of the body is just unbelievable.

2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:49.760
 And immunotherapy tries to get the immune system to do some of the work.

2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:54.720
 Exactly. Yeah. I think that's potentially a very good, a very good approach. If, if

2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.520
 the immune system can be taught to recognize enough of, of the cancer cells, that that's

2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:02.720
 a pretty good approach. But I, but I think, but I think our approach is in a way more

2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:08.440
 fundamental because if you can, if you can keep the cells harnessed towards organ level

2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:13.900
 goals as opposed to individual cell goals, then nobody will be making a tumor or metastasizing

2:28:13.900 --> 2:28:15.440
 and so on.

2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:21.840
 So we've been living through a pandemic. What do you think about viruses in this full beautiful

2:28:21.840 --> 2:28:30.080
 biological context we've been talking about? Are they beautiful to you? Are they terrifying?

2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:36.800
 Also maybe let's say, are they, since we've been discriminating this whole conversation,

2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:43.840
 are they living? Are they embodied minds? Embodied minds that are assholes?

2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:47.200
 As far as I know, and I haven't been able to find this paper again, but, but somewhere

2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:51.680
 I saw in the last couple of months, there was some, there was some papers showing an

2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:55.360
 example of a virus that actually had physiology. So there was some, something was going on,

2:28:55.360 --> 2:29:01.320
 I think proton flux or something on the virus itself. But, but barring that, generally speaking,

2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:06.860
 viruses are very passive. They don't do anything by themselves. And so I don't see any particular

2:29:06.860 --> 2:29:14.100
 reason to attribute much of a mind to them. I think, you know, they represent a way to

2:29:14.100 --> 2:29:18.520
 hijack other minds for sure, like, like cells and other things.

2:29:18.520 --> 2:29:24.300
 But that's an interesting interplay though. If they're hijacking other minds, you know,

2:29:24.300 --> 2:29:28.420
 the way we're, we were talking about living organisms that they can interact with each

2:29:28.420 --> 2:29:36.400
 other and have it alter each other's trajectory by having interacted. I mean, that's, that's

2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:45.680
 a deep, meaningful connection between a virus and a cell. And I think both are transformed

2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:49.040
 by the experience. And so in that sense, both are living.

2:29:49.040 --> 2:29:56.320
 Yeah. Yeah. You know, the whole category, I, this question of what's living and what's

2:29:56.320 --> 2:30:00.000
 not living, I really, I'm not sure. And I know there's people that work on this and

2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:05.480
 I don't want to piss anybody off, but, but I have not found that particularly useful

2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:11.480
 as, as to try and make that a binary kind of a distinction. I think level of cognition

2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:17.080
 is very interesting of, but as a, as a continuum, but, but living and nonliving, I, you know,

2:30:17.080 --> 2:30:20.680
 I don't, I really know what to do with that. I don't, I don't know what you do next after,

2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:21.800
 after making that distinction.

2:30:21.800 --> 2:30:27.640
 That's why I make the very binary distinction. Can I have sex with it or not? Can I eat it

2:30:27.640 --> 2:30:30.360
 or not? Those, cause there's, those are actionable, right?

2:30:30.360 --> 2:30:34.000
 Yeah. Well, I think that's a critical point that you brought up because how you relate

2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:40.000
 to something is really what this is all about, right? As an engineer, how do I control it?

2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:44.120
 But maybe I shouldn't be controlling it. Maybe I should be, you know, can I have a relationship

2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:48.400
 with it? Should I be listening to its advice? Like, like all the way from, you know, I need

2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:52.800
 to take it apart all the way to, I better do what it says cause it seems to be pretty

2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:56.480
 smart and everything in between, right? That's really what we're asking about.

2:30:56.480 --> 2:31:01.400
 Yeah. We need to understand our relationship to it. We're searching for that relationship,

2:31:01.400 --> 2:31:08.200
 even in the most trivial senses. You came up with a lot of interesting terms. We've mentioned

2:31:08.200 --> 2:31:14.560
 some of them. Agential material. That's a really interesting one. That's a really interesting

2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:19.600
 one for the future of computation and artificial intelligence and computer science and all

2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:25.940
 of that. There's also, let me go through some of them. If they spark some interesting thought

2:31:25.940 --> 2:31:32.640
 for you, there's teleophobia, the unwarranted fear of erring on the side of too much agency

2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:35.000
 when considering a new system.

2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:36.000
 Yeah.

2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:41.080
 That's the opposite. I mean, being afraid of maybe anthropomorphizing the thing.

2:31:41.080 --> 2:31:47.120
 This'll get some people ticked off, I think. But I don't think, I think the whole notion

2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:54.440
 of anthropomorphizing is a holdover from a pre scientific age where humans were magic

2:31:54.440 --> 2:32:00.080
 and everything else wasn't magic and you were anthropomorphizing when you dared suggest

2:32:00.080 --> 2:32:05.760
 that something else has some features of humans. And I think we need to be way beyond that.

2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:12.640
 And this issue of anthropomorphizing, I think it's a cheap charge. I don't think it holds

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:18.240
 any water at all other than when somebody makes a cognitive claim. I think all cognitive

2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:22.620
 claims are engineering claims, really. So when somebody says this thing knows or this

2:32:22.620 --> 2:32:27.800
 thing hopes or this thing wants or this thing predicts, all you can say is fabulous. Give

2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:33.420
 me the engineering protocol that you've derived using that hypothesis and we will see if this

2:32:33.420 --> 2:32:36.760
 thing helps us or not. And then, and then we can, you know, then we can make a rational

2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:37.760
 decision.

2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:43.400
 I also like anatomical compiler, a future system representing the longterm end game

2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:49.280
 of the science of morphogenesis that reminds us how far away from true understanding we

2:32:49.280 --> 2:32:54.740
 are. Someday you will be able to sit in front of an anatomical computer, specify the shape

2:32:54.740 --> 2:32:59.480
 of the animal or a plant that you want, and it will convert that shape specification to

2:32:59.480 --> 2:33:05.160
 a set of stimuli that will have to be given to cells to build exactly that shape. No matter

2:33:05.160 --> 2:33:12.560
 how weird it ends up being, you have total control. Just imagine the possibility for

2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:18.780
 memes in the physical space. One of the glorious accomplishments of human civilizations is

2:33:18.780 --> 2:33:25.840
 memes in digital space. Now this could create memes in physical space. I am both excited

2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:31.800
 and terrified by that possibility. Cognitive light cone, I think we also talked about the

2:33:31.800 --> 2:33:39.220
 outer boundary in space and time of the largest goal a given system can work towards. Is this

2:33:39.220 --> 2:33:42.500
 kind of like shaping the set of options?

2:33:42.500 --> 2:33:49.680
 It's a little different than options. It's really focused on... I first came up with

2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:55.320
 this back in 2018, I want to say. There was a conference, a Templeton conference where

2:33:55.320 --> 2:34:01.160
 they challenged us to come up with frameworks. I think actually it's the diverse intelligence

2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:02.160
 community.

2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:03.160
 Summer Institute.

2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:04.160
 Yeah, they had a Summer Institute.

2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:06.640
 That's the logos, the bee with some circuits.

2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:13.360
 Yeah, it's got different life forms. The whole program is called diverse intelligence. They

2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:18.240
 challenged us to come up with a framework that was suitable for analyzing different

2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:23.000
 kinds of intelligence together. Because the kinds of things you do to a human are not

2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:29.560
 good with an octopus, not good with a plant and so on. I started thinking about this.

2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:35.560
 I asked myself what do all cognitive agents, no matter what their provenance, no matter

2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:41.560
 what their architecture is, what do cognitive agents have in common? It seems to me that

2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:46.480
 what they have in common is some degree of competency to pursue a goal. What you can

2:34:46.480 --> 2:34:51.720
 do then is you can draw. What I ended up drawing was this thing that it's kind of like a backwards

2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:58.520
 Minkowski cone diagram where all of space is collapsed into one axis and then here and

2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:04.160
 then time is this axis. Then what you can do is you can draw for any creature, you can

2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:12.360
 semi quantitatively estimate what are the spatial and temporal goals that it's capable

2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:13.360
 of pursuing.

2:35:13.360 --> 2:35:20.240
 For example, if you are a tick and all you really are able to pursue is maximum or a

2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:24.800
 bacterium and maximizing the level of some chemical in your vicinity, that's all you've

2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:29.440
 got, it's a tiny little icon, then you're a simple system like a tick or a bacterium.

2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:37.520
 If you are something like a dog, well, you've got some ability to care about some spatial

2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:41.680
 region, some temporal. You can remember a little bit backwards, you can predict a little

2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:46.280
 bit forwards, but you're never ever going to care about what happens in the next town

2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:51.680
 over four weeks from now. As far as we know, it's just impossible for that kind of architecture.

2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:56.580
 If you're a human, you might be working towards world peace long after you're dead. You might

2:35:56.580 --> 2:36:04.120
 have a planetary scale goal that's enormous. Then there may be other greater intelligences

2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:08.800
 somewhere that can care in the linear range about numbers of creatures, some sort of Buddha

2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:16.040
 like character that can care about everybody's welfare, really care the way that we can't.

2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:20.640
 It's not a mapping of what you can sense, how far you can sense. It's not a mapping

2:36:20.640 --> 2:36:25.720
 of how far you can act. It's a mapping of how big are the goals you are capable of envisioning

2:36:25.720 --> 2:36:33.880
 and working towards. I think that enables you to put synthetic kinds of constructs,

2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:40.120
 AIs, aliens, swarms, whatever on the same diagram because we're not talking about what

2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:44.720
 you're made of or how you got here. We're talking about what are the size and complexity

2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:46.760
 of the goals towards which you can work.

2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:50.760
 Is there any other terms that pop into mind that are interesting?

2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:54.200
 I'm trying to remember. I have a list of them somewhere on my website.

2:36:54.200 --> 2:37:01.840
 Human morphology, yeah, definitely check it out. Morphosutical, I like that one. Ionisutical.

2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:08.600
 Yeah. Those refer to different types of interventions in the regenerative medicine space. Amorphosutical

2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:16.200
 is something that it's a kind of intervention that really targets the cells decision making

2:37:16.200 --> 2:37:20.640
 process about what they're going to build. Ionisuticals are like that, but more focused

2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:24.200
 specifically on the bioelectrics. There's also, of course, biochemical, biomechanical,

2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:29.160
 who knows what else, maybe optical kinds of signaling systems there as well.

2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:37.920
 Target morphology is interesting. It's designed to capture this idea that it's not just feedforward

2:37:37.920 --> 2:37:41.980
 emergence and oftentimes in biology, I mean, of course that happens too, but in many cases

2:37:41.980 --> 2:37:48.440
 in biology, the system is specifically working towards a target in anatomical morphospace.

2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:57.200
 It's a navigation task really. These kinds of problem solving can be formalized as navigation

2:37:57.200 --> 2:38:00.920
 tasks and that they're really going towards a particular region. How do you know? Because

2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:03.720
 you deviate them and then they go back.

2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:12.160
 Let me ask you, because you've really challenged a lot of ideas in biology in the work you

2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:18.160
 do, probably because some of your rebelliousness comes from the fact that you came from a different

2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:23.800
 field of computer engineering, but could you give advice to young people today in high

2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:31.600
 school or college that are trying to pave their life story, whether it's in science

2:38:31.600 --> 2:38:36.440
 or elsewhere, how they can have a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud

2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:37.440
 of advice?

2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:42.320
 Boy, it's dangerous to give advice because things change so fast, but one central thing

2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:47.880
 I can say, moving up and through academia and whatnot, you will be surrounded by really

2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:56.280
 smart people. What you need to do is be very careful at distinguishing specific critique

2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:03.840
 versus kind of meta advice. What I mean by that is if somebody really smart and successful

2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:11.400
 and obviously competent is giving you specific critiques on what you've done, that's gold.

2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:15.200
 It's an opportunity to hone your craft, to get better at what you're doing, to learn,

2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:17.520
 to find your mistakes. That's great.

2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:23.080
 If they are telling you what you ought to be studying, how you ought to approach things,

2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:28.880
 what is the right way to think about things, you should probably ignore most of that. The

2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:36.200
 reason I make that distinction is that a lot of really successful people are very well

2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:43.080
 calibrated on their own ideas and their own field and their own area. They know exactly

2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:46.460
 what works and what doesn't and what's good and what's bad, but they're not calibrated

2:39:46.460 --> 2:39:53.040
 on your ideas. The things they will say, oh, this is a dumb idea, don't do this and you

2:39:53.040 --> 2:40:01.940
 shouldn't do that, that stuff is generally worse than useless. It can be very demoralizing

2:40:01.940 --> 2:40:09.080
 and really limiting. What I say to people is read very broadly, work really hard, know

2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:14.220
 what you're talking about, take all specific criticism as an opportunity to improve what

2:40:14.220 --> 2:40:21.800
 you're doing and then completely ignore everything else. I just tell you from my own experience,

2:40:21.800 --> 2:40:26.280
 most of what I consider to be interesting and useful things that we've done, very smart

2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:32.960
 people have said, this is a terrible idea, don't do that. I think we just don't know.

2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:37.720
 We have no idea beyond our own. At best, we know what we ought to be doing. We very rarely

2:40:37.720 --> 2:40:39.320
 know what anybody else should be doing.

2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:45.240
 Yeah, and their ideas, their perspective has been also calibrated, not just on their field

2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:51.520
 and specific situation, but also on a state of that field at a particular time in the

2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:57.880
 past. There's not many people in this world that are able to achieve revolutionary success

2:40:57.880 --> 2:41:02.680
 multiple times in their life. Whenever you say somebody very smart, usually what that

2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:09.120
 means is somebody who's smart, who achieved a success at a certain point in their life

2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:14.720
 and people often get stuck in that place where they found success. To be constantly challenging

2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:23.240
 your worldview is a very difficult thing. Also at the same time, probably if a lot of

2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:29.480
 people tell, that's the weird thing about life, if a lot of people tell you that something

2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:36.160
 is stupid or is not going to work, that either means it's stupid, it's not going to work,

2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:42.680
 or it's actually a great opportunity to do something new and you don't know which one

2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:49.920
 it is and it's probably equally likely to be either. Well, I don't know, the probabilities.

2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:53.400
 Depends how lucky you are, depends how brilliant you are, but you don't know and so you can't

2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:55.680
 take that advice as actual data.

2:41:55.680 --> 2:42:03.920
 Yeah, you have to and this is kind of hard to describe and fuzzy, but I'm a firm believer

2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:09.160
 that you have to build up your own intuition. So over time, you have to take your own risks

2:42:09.160 --> 2:42:13.580
 that seem like they make sense to you and then learn from that and build up so that

2:42:13.580 --> 2:42:18.120
 you can trust your own gut about what's a good idea even when, and then sometimes you'll

2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:21.560
 make mistakes and they'll turn out to be a dead end and that's fine, that's science,

2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:28.560
 but what I tell my students is life is hard and science is hard and you're going to sweat

2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:34.880
 and bleed and everything and you should be doing that for ideas that really fire you

2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:44.940
 up inside and really don't let kind of the common denominator of standardized approaches

2:42:44.940 --> 2:42:46.800
 to things slow you down.

2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:53.480
 So you mentioned planaria being in some sense immortal. What's the role of death in life?

2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:58.760
 What's the role of death in this whole process we have? Is it, when you look at biological

2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:08.000
 systems, is death an important feature, especially as you climb up the hierarchy of competency?

2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:17.320
 Boy, that's an interesting question. I think that it's certainly a factor that promotes

2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:24.520
 change and turnover and an opportunity to do something different the next time for a

2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:29.520
 larger scale system. So apoptosis, it's really interesting. I mean, death is really interesting

2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:33.040
 in a number of ways. One is like you could think about like what was the first thing

2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:37.420
 to die? That's an interesting question. What was the first creature that you could say

2:43:37.420 --> 2:43:42.880
 actually died? It's a tough thing because we don't have a great definition for it. So

2:43:42.880 --> 2:43:48.480
 if you bring a cabbage home and you put it in your fridge, at what point are you going

2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:58.880
 to say it's died, right? So it's kind of hard to know. There's one paper in which I talk

2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:04.960
 about this idea that, I mean, think about this and imagine that you have a creature

2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:11.680
 that's aquatic, let's say it's a frog or something or a tadpole, and the animal dies,

2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.600
 in the pond it dies for whatever reason. Most of the cells are still alive. So you could

2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.200
 imagine that if when it died, there was some sort of breakdown of the connectivity between

2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:28.760
 the cells, a bunch of cells crawled off, they could have a life as amoebas. Some of them

2:44:28.760 --> 2:44:33.780
 could join together and become a xenobot and twiddle around, right? So we know from planaria

2:44:33.780 --> 2:44:37.800
 that there are cells that don't obey the Hayflick limit and just sort of live forever. So you

2:44:37.800 --> 2:44:42.400
 could imagine an organism that when the organism dies, it doesn't disappear, rather the individual

2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:46.280
 cells that are still alive, crawl off and have a completely different kind of lifestyle

2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:50.080
 and maybe come back together as something else, or maybe they don't. So all of this,

2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:57.080
 I'm sure, is happening somewhere on some planet. So death in any case, I mean, we already kind

2:44:57.080 --> 2:45:00.640
 of knew this because the molecules, we know that when something dies, the molecules go

2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:05.200
 through the ecosystem, but even the cells don't necessarily die at that point, they

2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:09.720
 might have another life in a different way. You can think about something like HeLa, right?

2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:14.400
 The HeLa cell line, you know, that has this, that's had this incredible life. There are

2:45:14.400 --> 2:45:18.040
 way more HeLa cells now than there ever been, than there, than there were when, when she

2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:19.040
 was alive.

2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:22.240
 It seems like as the organisms become more and more complex, like if you look at the

2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:29.800
 mammals, their relationship with death becomes more and more complex. So the survival imperative

2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:37.400
 starts becoming interesting and humans are arguably the first species that have invented

2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:43.120
 the fear of death. The understanding that you're going to die, let's put it this way,

2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:49.560
 like long, so not like instinctual, like, I need to run away from the thing that's going

2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:53.960
 to eat me, but starting to contemplate the finiteness of life.

2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:59.400
 Yeah. I mean, one thing, so, so one thing about the human light, cognitive light cone

2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:04.200
 is that for the first, as far as we know, for the first time, you might have goals that

2:46:04.200 --> 2:46:08.160
 are longer than your lifespan, that are not achievable, right? So if you're, if you are,

2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:11.800
 let's say, and I don't know if this is true, but if you're a goldfish and you have a 10

2:46:11.800 --> 2:46:14.760
 minute attention span, I'm not sure if that's true, but let's say, let's say there's some

2:46:14.760 --> 2:46:20.260
 organism with a, with a short kind of cognitive light cone that way, all of your goals are

2:46:20.260 --> 2:46:23.560
 potentially achievable because you're probably going to live the next 10 minutes. So whatever

2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:27.440
 goals you have, they are totally achievable. If you're a human, you could have all kinds

2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:31.240
 of goals that are guaranteed not achievable because they just take too long, like guaranteed

2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:35.840
 you're not going to achieve them. So I wonder if, you know, is that, is that a, you know,

2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:39.920
 like a perennial, you know, sort of thorn in our, in our psychology that drives some,

2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:43.920
 some psychosis or whatever? I have, I have no idea. Another interesting thing about that,

2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:47.720
 actually, I've been thinking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks, this notion

2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:58.480
 of giving up. So you would think that evolutionarily, the most adaptive way of being is that you

2:46:58.480 --> 2:47:02.960
 go, you, you, you, you fight as long as you physically can. And then when you can't, you

2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:06.680
 can't, and there's in, there's this photograph, there's videos you can find of insects are

2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:10.000
 crawling around where like, you know, like, like most of it is already gone, and it's

2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:15.240
 still sort of crawling, you know, like, Terminator style, right? Like, as far as as long as you

2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:20.320
 physically can, you keep going. Mammals don't do that. So a lot of mammals, including rats,

2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:25.780
 have this thing where when, when they think it's a hopeless situation, they literally

2:47:25.780 --> 2:47:29.060
 give up and die when physically, they could have kept going. I mean, humans certainly

2:47:29.060 --> 2:47:33.320
 do this. And there's, there's some like, really unpleasant experiments that the this guy forget

2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:37.960
 his name did with drowning rats, where if he where where rats normally drown after a

2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:41.480
 couple of minutes, but if you teach them that if you just tread water for a couple of minutes,

2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:45.360
 you'll get rescued, they can tread water for like an hour. And so right, and so they literally

2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:49.920
 just give up and die. And so evolutionarily, that doesn't seem like a good strategy at

2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:53.320
 all evolutionarily, since why would you like, what's the benefit ever of giving up, you

2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:57.400
 just do what you can, and you know, one time out of 1000, you'll actually get rescued, right?

2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:03.080
 But this issue of actually giving up suggests some very interesting metacognitive controls

2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:08.080
 where you've now gotten to the point where survival actually isn't the top drive. And

2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:11.560
 that for whatever, you know, there are other considerations that have like taken over.

2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:15.560
 And I think that's uniquely a mammalian thing. But then I don't know.

2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:23.080
 Yeah, the Camus, the existentialist question of why live, just the fact that humans commit

2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:27.880
 suicide is a really fascinating question from an evolutionary perspective.

2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:33.360
 And what was the first and that's the other thing, like, what is the simplest system,

2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:38.760
 whether whether evolved or natural or whatever, that is able to do that? Right? Like, you

2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:42.440
 can think, you know, what other animals are actually able to do that? I'm not sure.

2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:49.760
 Maybe you could see animals over time, for some reason, lowering the value of survive

2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:55.560
 at all costs, gradually, until other objectives might become more important.

2:48:55.560 --> 2:48:59.320
 Maybe. I don't know how evolutionarily how that how that gets off the ground. That just

2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:06.600
 seems like that would have such a strong pressure against it, you know. Just imagine, you know,

2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:13.240
 a population with a lower, you know, if you were a mutant in a population that had less

2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:19.200
 of a less of a survival imperative, would you put your genes outperform the others?

2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:26.440
 Is there such a thing as population selection? Because maybe suicide is a way for organisms

2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:31.840
 to decide themselves that they're not fit for the environment? Somehow?

2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:36.660
 Yeah, that's a that's a really contrary, you know, population level selection is a kind

2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:42.840
 of a deep controversial area. But it's tough because on the face of it, if that was your

2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:47.040
 genome, it wouldn't get propagated because you would die and then your neighbor who didn't

2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:49.040
 have that would would have all the kids.

2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:55.140
 It feels like there could be some deep truth there that we're not understanding. What about

2:49:55.140 --> 2:49:59.300
 you yourself as one biological system? Are you afraid of death?

2:49:59.300 --> 2:50:05.820
 To be honest, I'm more concerned with especially now getting older and having helped a couple

2:50:05.820 --> 2:50:14.880
 of people pass. I think about what's a what's a good way to go? Basically, like nowadays,

2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:19.160
 I don't know what that is, I, you know, sitting in a, you know, a facility that sort of tries

2:50:19.160 --> 2:50:24.840
 to stretch you out as long as you can, that doesn't seem that doesn't seem good. And there's

2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:29.400
 not a lot of opportunities to sort of, I don't know, sacrifice yourself for something useful,

2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:33.640
 right? There's not terribly many opportunities for that in modern society. So I don't know,

2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:38.040
 that's that's that's more of I'm not I'm not particularly worried about death itself.

2:50:38.040 --> 2:50:46.380
 But I've seen it happen. And and it's not it's not pretty. And I don't know what what

2:50:46.380 --> 2:50:48.080
 a better what a better alternative is.

2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:56.360
 So the existential aspect of it does not worry you deeply? The fact that this ride ends?

2:50:56.360 --> 2:51:01.340
 No, it began. I mean, the ride began, right? So there was I don't know how many billions

2:51:01.340 --> 2:51:04.740
 of years before that I wasn't around. So that's okay.

2:51:04.740 --> 2:51:10.520
 But isn't the experience of life? It's almost like feels like you're immortal. Because the

2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:15.720
 way you make plans, the way you think about the future. I mean, if you if you look at

2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:22.360
 your own personal rich experience, yes, you can understand, okay, eventually, I died as

2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:28.960
 people I love that have died. So surely, I will die and it hurts and so on. But like,

2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:34.240
 he sure doesn't. It's so easy to get lost in feeling like this is going to go on forever.

2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:37.320
 Yeah, it's a little bit like the people who say they don't believe in free will, right?

2:51:37.320 --> 2:51:41.680
 I mean, you can say that but but when you go to a restaurant, you still have to pick

2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:46.080
 a soup and stuff. So right, so so I don't know if I know I've actually seen that that

2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:49.920
 happened at lunch with a with a well known philosopher and he didn't believe in free

2:51:49.920 --> 2:51:53.600
 will and the other waitress came around and he was like, Well, let me see. I was like,

2:51:53.600 --> 2:51:58.200
 What are you doing here? You're gonna choose a sandwich, right? So it's I think it's one

2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:02.100
 of those things. I think you can know that, you know, you're not going to live forever.

2:52:02.100 --> 2:52:07.100
 But you can't you can't. It's not practical to live that way unless you know, so you buy

2:52:07.100 --> 2:52:11.920
 insurance and then you do some stuff like that. But but but mostly, you know, I think

2:52:11.920 --> 2:52:17.440
 you just you just live as if as if as if you can make plans.

2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:22.520
 We talked about all kinds of life. We talked about all kinds of embodied minds. What do

2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:28.000
 you think is the meaning of it all? What's the meaning of all the biological lives we've

2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:33.280
 been talking about here on Earth? Why are we here?

2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:38.920
 I don't know that that's a that that's a well posed question other than the existential

2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:40.900
 question you post before.

2:52:40.900 --> 2:52:47.000
 Is that question hanging out with the question of what is consciousness and there at retreat

2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:55.280
 somewhere? Not sure because sipping pina coladas and because they're ambiguously defined.

2:52:55.280 --> 2:53:01.660
 Maybe I'm not sure that any of these things really ride on the correctness of our scientific

2:53:01.660 --> 2:53:06.740
 understanding. But I mean, just just for an example, right? I've always found I've always

2:53:06.740 --> 2:53:16.760
 found it weird that people get really worked up to find out realities about their their

2:53:16.760 --> 2:53:22.820
 bodies, for example. Right. You've seen them. Ex Machina. Right. And so there's this great

2:53:22.820 --> 2:53:26.120
 scene where he's cutting his hand to find out, you know, a piece full of cock. Now,

2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:31.880
 to me, right? If if I open up and I find out and I find a bunch of cogs, my conclusion

2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:37.360
 is not, oh, crap, I must not have true cognition. That sucks. My conclusion is, wow, cogs can

2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:42.840
 have true cognition. Great. So right. So. So it seems to me, I guess I guess I'm with

2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:48.240
 Descartes on this one, that whatever whatever the truth ends up being of of of how is what

2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:53.080
 is consciousness, how it can be conscious? None of that is going to alter my primary

2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:56.600
 experience, which is this is what it is. And if and if a bunch of molecular networks can

2:53:56.600 --> 2:54:03.300
 do it, fantastic. If it turns out that there's a there's a non corporeal, you know, so great.

2:54:03.300 --> 2:54:09.200
 We can we'll study that, whatever. But but the fundamental existential aspect of it is,

2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:13.400
 you know, if somebody if somebody told me today that, yeah, yeah, you were created yesterday

2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:18.280
 and all your memories are, you know, sort of fake, you know, kind of like like like Boltzmann

2:54:18.280 --> 2:54:23.280
 brains, right. And the human, you know, human skepticism, all that. Yeah. OK. Well, so so

2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:31.280
 but but here I am now. So so it's the experience. It's primal, so like that's the that's the

2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:36.300
 thing that matters. So the the backstory doesn't matter. I think so. I think so. From a first

2:54:36.300 --> 2:54:39.600
 person perspective, now from a third person, like scientifically, it's all very interesting.

2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:43.760
 From a third person perspective, I could say, wow, that's that's amazing that that this

2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:48.000
 happens and how does it happen and whatever. But from a first person perspective, I could

2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:52.020
 care less. Like I just it's just what I've what I learned from any of these scientific

2:54:52.020 --> 2:54:57.160
 facts is, OK, well, I guess then that's that that then I guess that's what is sufficient

2:54:57.160 --> 2:55:01.820
 to to give me my, you know, amazing first person perspective. I think if you dig deeper

2:55:01.820 --> 2:55:10.100
 and deeper and get a get surprising answers to why the hell we're here, it might give

2:55:10.100 --> 2:55:18.680
 you some guidance on how to live. Maybe, maybe. I don't know. That would be nice. On the one

2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:23.240
 hand, you might be right, because on the one hand, if I don't know what else could possibly

2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:26.240
 give you that guidance. Right. So so you would think that it would have to be that or you

2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:30.400
 would do it would have to be science because there isn't anything else. So so that's so

2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:36.680
 maybe on the other hand, I am really not sure how you go from any, you know, what they call

2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:41.120
 from an is to an odd right from any factual description of what's going on. This goes

2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:44.920
 back to the natural. Right. Just because somebody says, oh, man, that's that's completely not

2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:50.000
 natural. It's never happened on Earth before. I'm not impressed by that whatsoever. I think

2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:56.280
 I think whatever hazard hasn't happened, we are now in a position to do better if we can.

2:55:56.280 --> 2:56:03.680
 Right. Well, this also because you said there's science and there's nothing else. There it's

2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:12.000
 it's really tricky to know how to intellectually deal with a thing that science doesn't currently

2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:22.880
 understand. Right. So like, the thing is, if you believe that science solves everything,

2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:30.280
 you can too easily in your mind think our current understanding, like, we've solved

2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:36.120
 everything. Right. Right. Right. Like, it jumps really quickly to not science as a mechanism

2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:43.000
 as a as a process, but more like science of today. Like, you could just look at human

2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:48.640
 history and throughout human history, just physicists and everybody would claim we've

2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:53.240
 solved everything. Sure. Sure. Like, like, there's a few small things to figure out.

2:56:53.240 --> 2:56:58.480
 And we basically solved everything. Were in reality, I think asking, like, what is the

2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:08.120
 meaning of life is resetting the palette of like, we might be tiny and confused and don't

2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:12.800
 have anything figured out. It's almost going to be hilarious a few centuries from now when

2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:21.480
 they look back how dumb we were. Yeah, I 100% agree. So when I say science and nothing else,

2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:27.640
 I certainly don't mean the science of today because I think overall, I think we are we

2:57:27.640 --> 2:57:32.400
 know very little. I think most of the things that we're sure of now are going to be, as

2:57:32.400 --> 2:57:36.280
 you said, are going to look hilarious down the line. So I think we're just at the beginning

2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:42.320
 of a lot of really important things. When I say nothing but science, I also include

2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:48.000
 the kind of first person, what I call science that you do. So the interesting thing about

2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:52.120
 I think about consciousness and studying consciousness and things like that in the first person is

2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:57.760
 unlike doing science in the third person, where you as the scientist are minimally changed

2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:01.360
 by it, maybe not at all. So when I do an experiment, I'm still me, there's the experiment, whatever

2:58:01.360 --> 2:58:04.900
 I've done, I've learned something, so that's a small change. But but overall, that's it.

2:58:04.900 --> 2:58:10.640
 In order to really study consciousness, you will you are part of the experiment, you will

2:58:10.640 --> 2:58:13.920
 be altered by that experiment, right? Whatever, whatever it is that you're doing, whether

2:58:13.920 --> 2:58:22.120
 it's some sort of contemplative practice or, or some sort of psychoactive, you know, whatever.

2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:26.160
 You are now you are now your own experiment, and you are right. And so I consider I fold

2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:29.960
 that in, I think that's that's part of it. I think that exploring our own mind and our

2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:34.680
 own consciousness is very important. I think much of it is not captured by what currently

2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:41.520
 is third person science for sure. But ultimately, I include all of that in science, with a capital

2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:48.800
 S in terms of like a, a rational investigation of both first and third person aspects of

2:58:48.800 --> 2:58:50.300
 our world.

2:58:50.300 --> 2:58:57.960
 We are our own experiment, as beautifully put. And when when two systems get to interact

2:58:57.960 --> 2:59:03.780
 with each other, that's the kind of experiment. So I'm deeply honored that you would do this

2:59:03.780 --> 2:59:07.760
 experiment with me today. Thanks so much. I'm a huge fan of your work. Likewise, thank

2:59:07.760 --> 2:59:13.800
 you for doing everything you're doing. I can't wait to see the kind of incredible things

2:59:13.800 --> 2:59:18.200
 you build. So thank you for talking. Really appreciate being here. Thank you.

2:59:18.200 --> 2:59:22.200
 Thank you for listening to this conversation with Michael Levin. To support this podcast,

2:59:22.200 --> 2:59:26.760
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:35.760
 Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species. From the war of nature, from famine and death,

2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:41.000
 the most exalted object which we're capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the

2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:47.600
 higher animals directly follows. There's grandeur in this view of life, with its several

2:59:47.600 --> 2:59:54.880
 powers having been originally breathed into a few forms, or into one, and that whilst

2:59:54.880 --> 2:59:59.840
 this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from its most

2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:06.880
 simpler beginning, endless forms, most beautiful and most wonderful, have been and are being

3:00:06.880 --> 3:00:25.480
 evolved. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
