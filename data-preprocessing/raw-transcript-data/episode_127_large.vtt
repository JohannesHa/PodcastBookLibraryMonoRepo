00:00.000 --> 00:03.180
 The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan

00:03.180 --> 00:05.700
 that we recorded after my recent appearance

00:05.700 --> 00:08.900
 on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.460
 Joe has been a inspiration to me

00:11.460 --> 00:13.560
 and I thank to millions of people

00:13.560 --> 00:17.660
 for just being somebody who puts love out there in the world

00:17.660 --> 00:20.920
 and being genuinely curious about wild ideas

00:20.920 --> 00:24.780
 from chimps and psychedelics to quantum mechanics

00:24.780 --> 00:26.800
 and artificial intelligence.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.620
 Like many of you, I've been a fan of his podcast

00:29.620 --> 00:34.620
 for over a decade and now, somehow, miraculously,

00:34.680 --> 00:38.400
 am humbled to be able to call him a friend.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.780

01:08.400 --> 01:11.220
 I usually do full ad reads here and never ads in the middle

01:11.220 --> 01:14.100
 but this time, I'll just go straight to the conversation

01:14.100 --> 01:16.220
 with a bit of guitar first.

01:16.220 --> 01:36.220
 ["The Unlimited Breadsticks and Dollar Shave Club"]

01:54.160 --> 01:56.160
 Do you ponder your mortality?

01:56.160 --> 01:57.900
 Are you afraid of death?

01:57.900 --> 01:59.520
 I do think about it sometimes.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.820
 I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes,

02:01.820 --> 02:04.980
 just the fact that, I mean, I'm 53,

02:04.980 --> 02:09.660
 so if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.960
 If everything goes great, like no car accidents,

02:13.960 --> 02:15.620
 no injuries.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.880
 But it could happen today.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.280
 This could be your last day.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.160
 Could be.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.320
 That's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.040
 There's a bunch of philosophers,

02:24.040 --> 02:27.480
 Ernest Becker and Sheldon Solomon,

02:27.480 --> 02:31.520
 they believe that death is at the core of everything.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.340
 Wrote this book, Warm at the Core.

02:33.340 --> 02:36.300
 So does that come into play in the way you see the world?

02:37.520 --> 02:41.540
 I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial

02:41.540 --> 02:43.560
 and understanding that your time is limited

02:43.560 --> 02:44.960
 can aid you greatly.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.320
 I think knowing that this is a temporary time,

02:48.320 --> 02:51.480
 that we have finite lifespans,

02:51.480 --> 02:55.600
 I think there's great power in that

02:55.600 --> 02:58.640
 because it motivates you, it gets you going.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.200
 I think being an immortal, living forever

03:01.200 --> 03:02.780
 would be one of the most depressing things,

03:02.780 --> 03:05.160
 particularly if everybody else was dying around you.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.200
 And I think one of the things that makes life

03:08.200 --> 03:12.360
 so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.480
 You know, that you really get a brief amount of time here

03:15.480 --> 03:17.240
 and really by the time you're just starting

03:17.240 --> 03:19.960
 to kind of figure yourself out, who you are

03:19.960 --> 03:22.400
 and how not to screw things up so bad,

03:22.400 --> 03:23.520
 like, time's up.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.680
 The ride's over.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.240
 What about from your, like,

03:26.240 --> 03:27.840
 from your daughter's perspective?

03:28.960 --> 03:31.960
 Do you think about the world we're in now

03:31.960 --> 03:34.320
 and what kind of world you're gonna leave them?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.120
 I do.

03:36.120 --> 03:36.960
 And do you worry about it?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.600
 I do, yeah, I do.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.760
 I do when I see these protests and riots and chaos

03:42.760 --> 03:47.760
 and so much, so much anger in the world today.

03:48.440 --> 03:49.680
 And then particularly today,

03:49.680 --> 03:52.280
 I think because of the pandemic

03:52.280 --> 03:55.080
 and the fact that so many folks are out of work

03:55.080 --> 03:57.200
 and through no fault of their own

03:57.200 --> 03:59.320
 and can't make ends meet

03:59.320 --> 04:02.720
 and these people feel so helpless and angry,

04:02.720 --> 04:06.780
 it's a particularly divisive time.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.400
 It's a particularly turmoil filled time.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.800
 And it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago even.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.640
 It feels very chaotic and dangerous.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.200
 And it's a small thing,

04:19.200 --> 04:22.080
 like in terms of the possibilities of things

04:22.080 --> 04:23.160
 that could happen to the world,

04:23.160 --> 04:25.440
 like a pandemic like the one we've experienced,

04:25.440 --> 04:27.640
 it really just doubles the amount of deaths

04:27.640 --> 04:29.040
 on a bad flu year.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.960
 So it's relatively speaking is a small thing

04:31.960 --> 04:36.200
 in comparison to super volcano eruptions,

04:36.200 --> 04:40.520
 asteroid impact, a real horrific pandemic

04:40.520 --> 04:44.080
 or one that really wipes out millions

04:44.080 --> 04:45.980
 and millions of people.

04:45.980 --> 04:50.400
 It's stunning how fragile civility is.

04:50.400 --> 04:55.080
 It's stunning how fragile our society really is

04:55.080 --> 04:57.040
 that something like this can come along,

04:57.040 --> 04:58.560
 some unprecedented thing,

04:58.560 --> 05:00.120
 unprecedented thing can come along

05:00.120 --> 05:02.320
 and all of a sudden everybody's out of work for six months

05:02.320 --> 05:04.040
 and then everybody's at each other's throats.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.240
 And then politically everyone's at each other's throats.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.280
 And then with the advent of social media

05:09.280 --> 05:13.440
 and the images that you can see with the videos

05:13.440 --> 05:17.380
 of police abuse and just racial tensions

05:17.380 --> 05:19.720
 are at an all time high to a point where like,

05:19.720 --> 05:23.120
 if you asked me just five or six years ago,

05:23.120 --> 05:27.200
 like have racial problems in this country

05:27.200 --> 05:28.680
 largely been alleviated,

05:28.680 --> 05:29.520
 I'd probably say, yeah,

05:29.520 --> 05:31.320
 it's way better than it's ever been before.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.840
 But now you could argue that it's not.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.520
 Now you could argue it's no, it's way worse

05:34.520 --> 05:36.600
 in just a small amount of time.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.760
 It's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime

05:39.760 --> 05:41.680
 while I'm aware of it.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.500
 Obviously when I was a young boy in the 60s,

05:44.500 --> 05:46.960
 they were still going through the civil rights movement,

05:46.960 --> 05:51.640
 but now it just seems very fever pitched.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.760
 And I think a lot of that is because of the pandemic

05:53.760 --> 05:58.640
 and is because of all the heightened just tension.

05:58.640 --> 06:03.640
 What I liken it to is road rage.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.440
 Cause you know, people have road rage,

06:05.440 --> 06:06.840
 not just because they're in the car

06:06.840 --> 06:08.120
 and no one can get to them,

06:08.120 --> 06:10.540
 but also because you're at a heightened state

06:10.540 --> 06:12.000
 because you're driving fast

06:12.000 --> 06:13.120
 and you know you're driving fast.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.960
 You know, you have to make split second movements.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.600
 And so anybody doing something, you're like,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.800
 what the people go crazy

06:18.800 --> 06:21.160
 because they're already at an eight

06:21.160 --> 06:23.540
 because they're in the car and they're moving very quickly.

06:23.540 --> 06:26.120
 That's what it feels like with today with the pandemic

06:26.120 --> 06:28.720
 feels like everybody is already at an eight.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.240
 So anything that comes along,

06:30.240 --> 06:33.160
 it's like light it all on fire, you know, burn it down.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.760
 Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason

06:36.760 --> 06:39.720
 for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.160
 It's not just the people that are at work,

06:41.160 --> 06:45.840
 but it's also that everyone feels so tense already

06:45.840 --> 06:47.960
 and everyone feels so helpless.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.440
 And it's like, you know, doing something like that

06:51.440 --> 06:56.440
 makes people, it just, it gives people

06:57.600 --> 07:01.120
 a whole new motivation for chaos,

07:01.120 --> 07:05.200
 a whole new motivation for doing destructive things

07:05.200 --> 07:07.400
 that I've never experienced in my life.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.700
 And your better days when you see a positive future,

07:10.700 --> 07:15.280
 what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020?

07:15.280 --> 07:18.120
 Like if you visualize a 2025,

07:18.120 --> 07:19.720
 that's a better world than today.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.600
 What is that?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.360
 How do we get there and what does that look like?

07:22.360 --> 07:23.460
 It's a good question.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.320
 I can honestly say I don't know.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.640
 And I wouldn't have said I don't know a year ago.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.840
 A year ago, I would have said, we're gonna be okay.

07:34.840 --> 07:38.000
 As much as people hate Trump, the economy is doing great.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.360
 I think we're gonna be fine.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.220
 That's not how I feel today.

07:41.220 --> 07:45.720
 Today, I don't think there's a clear solution politically

07:45.720 --> 07:47.240
 because I think if Trump wins,

07:47.240 --> 07:48.540
 people are gonna be furious.

07:48.540 --> 07:51.400
 And I think if Biden wins, people are gonna be furious.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.800
 Particularly like if things get more woke,

07:55.800 --> 08:00.800
 if people continue to enforce this force compliance

08:01.140 --> 08:04.440
 and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way,

08:04.440 --> 08:07.820
 which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.920
 The most disturbing for me is that I see what's going on.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.900
 I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this

08:14.900 --> 08:17.040
 and they shove it in people's faces

08:17.040 --> 08:18.140
 and it doesn't have to make sense.

08:18.140 --> 08:20.320
 Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest

08:20.320 --> 08:23.360
 that stopped this woman at a restaurant.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.240
 They were surrounding her outside a restaurant.

08:25.240 --> 08:28.480
 They were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.800
 This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives multiple times,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.160
 Black Lives Matter multiple times.

08:33.160 --> 08:36.360
 And the people all around her doing this were all white.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.180
 It's all weird.

08:37.180 --> 08:39.160
 My friend, Coach T, he's a wrestling coach,

08:39.160 --> 08:42.480
 is also on a podcast, my friend, Brian Moses.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.120
 His take on it is that black, and he's a black guy.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.200
 He says, Black Lives Matter is a white cult.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.920
 And I'm like, when you see that picture,

08:49.920 --> 08:52.280
 it's hard to argue that he's got a point.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.240
 I mean, it's clearly not all about that,

08:54.240 --> 08:57.580
 but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board

08:57.580 --> 09:00.760
 that are very much like cult members.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.600
 Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement

09:04.600 --> 09:06.760
 is you can't control who joins.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.520
 There's no entrance examination.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.400
 So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this?

09:12.400 --> 09:13.680
 What's your perceptions on that?

09:13.680 --> 09:18.520
 Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland,

09:18.520 --> 09:20.240
 that guy who murdered the Trump supporter

09:20.240 --> 09:21.580
 then the cops shot him.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.760
 That guy was walking around with his hand on his gun

09:25.760 --> 09:27.520
 looking for Trump supporters.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.480
 Just want, I mean, he's a known violent guy

09:31.480 --> 09:33.480
 who was walking around looking for Trump supporters,

09:33.480 --> 09:34.780
 found one and shot one.

09:34.780 --> 09:36.880
 That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.840
 He's a white guy, he shot another white guy.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.640
 It's just madness.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.960
 And that kind of madness is,

09:43.960 --> 09:47.440
 it's disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly.

09:47.440 --> 09:51.360
 I mean, there's been riots in Portland every night.

09:51.360 --> 09:55.040
 Oh, excuse me, demonstrations for 101 days now.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.800
 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire,

09:57.800 --> 09:59.860
 breaking into federal buildings.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.500
 It's like, whoever saw that coming?

10:02.500 --> 10:03.440
 Nobody saw that coming.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.340
 So I don't know what the solution is

10:07.340 --> 10:09.400
 and I don't know what it looks like in five years.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.240
 But 2025, to answer your question,

10:11.240 --> 10:12.880
 like it could be anything.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.760
 I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.720
 We could be looking at the apocalypse.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.480
 We could also be looking at an invasion from another country.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.640
 We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.280
 To put a little bit of responsibility on you,

10:27.280 --> 10:28.840
 like for me, I've listened to you

10:28.840 --> 10:31.560
 since the Red Band, Olive Garden days,

10:31.560 --> 10:33.280
 that's the very beginning.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.080
 And there was something in the way you communicated

10:36.080 --> 10:37.600
 about the world, maybe there was others,

10:37.600 --> 10:39.560
 but you're the one I was aware of,

10:39.560 --> 10:44.160
 is you're open minded and like loving towards the world,

10:44.160 --> 10:45.760
 especially as the podcast developed.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.680
 Like you just demonstrated and lived

10:49.680 --> 10:51.680
 this kind of just kindness,

10:51.680 --> 10:53.760
 or maybe even like lack of jealousy

10:53.760 --> 10:55.880
 in your own little profession of comedy.

10:55.880 --> 11:00.080
 It was clear that you didn't succumb

11:00.080 --> 11:02.080
 to the weaker aspects of human nature

11:02.080 --> 11:04.320
 and thereby inspire like people like me,

11:04.320 --> 11:09.240
 who I was naturally, probably especially in like the 20s,

11:09.240 --> 11:12.520
 early 20s, kind of jealous on the success of others.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.800
 And you're really the primary person that taught me

11:15.800 --> 11:19.920
 to truly celebrate the success of others.

11:19.920 --> 11:24.920
 And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this

11:25.080 --> 11:26.680
 of making a better 2025.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.840
 You have such a big megaphone.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.840
 Is there something you think you can do on this podcast

11:31.840 --> 11:35.000
 with the words, the way you talk,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.560
 the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?

11:39.560 --> 11:44.480
 I think if anything, I could help in leading by example,

11:44.480 --> 11:49.200
 but that's only gonna help the people that are listening.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.360
 I don't know what else I can do

11:52.360 --> 11:54.200
 in terms of like make the world a better place,

11:54.200 --> 11:59.200
 other than express my hopes and wishes for that

11:59.200 --> 12:02.520
 and just try to be as nice as I can to people

12:02.520 --> 12:04.240
 as often as I can.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.080
 But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category,

12:07.080 --> 12:09.760
 particularly with the Spotify deal,

12:09.760 --> 12:12.960
 where I'm one of them now.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.000
 I'm not a regular person anymore.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.640
 Now I'm like some famous rich guy.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.320
 So you go from being a regular person

12:20.320 --> 12:23.040
 to a famous rich guy that's out of touch.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.920
 And that's a real issue whenever you're talking

12:26.920 --> 12:30.960
 about the economy, about just real life problems.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.040
 It's interesting.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.800
 It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say

12:33.800 --> 12:36.480
 about Elon Musk, he's just a billionaire.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.480
 It's an interesting statement.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.160
 But I think if you just continue being you

12:41.160 --> 12:42.960
 and he continue being him,

12:45.400 --> 12:48.040
 I think people are just voicing their worry

12:48.040 --> 12:49.640
 that you become some rich guy.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.680
 I don't even know if they're doing that.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.760
 I think they're just finding,

12:53.760 --> 12:55.880
 the way he describes it, an attack vector.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.280
 Yeah, and I think he's right.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.640
 I think they can dismiss you by just saying,

13:01.640 --> 13:03.920
 oh, you're just a that.

13:03.920 --> 13:08.840
 You're easily definable.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.080
 Right, but there's truth to that.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.040
 If you're not careful, you can become out of touch.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.280
 But that's an interesting thing.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.440
 Why haven't you become out of touch?

13:19.440 --> 13:24.040
 As a human off the podcast, you don't act like a,

13:24.040 --> 13:26.560
 like you talk to somebody like me.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.800
 You don't talk like a famous person

13:28.800 --> 13:33.680
 or you don't act rich, like you're better than others.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.280
 There's a certain, listen, I've talked to quite a few,

13:37.280 --> 13:40.240
 you have too, but I've talked to a special kind of group

13:40.240 --> 13:42.960
 of people that are like Nobel Prize winners, let's say.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.480
 They sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.360
 And you don't, what's that about?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.840
 Well, you gotta know what that is, right?

13:51.840 --> 13:55.320
 Like that air of arrogance comes from

13:55.320 --> 13:57.640
 drinking your own Koolaid.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.280
 You start believing that somehow or another,

14:00.280 --> 14:02.040
 just because you're getting praise from all these people,

14:02.040 --> 14:04.520
 that you really are something different.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.760
 Usually it exemplifies, there's something there

14:08.760 --> 14:10.480
 where there's a lack of struggle.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.800
 And I think a struggle is

14:14.800 --> 14:19.800
 probably one of the most important balancing tools

14:22.320 --> 14:24.000
 that a person can have.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
 And for me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.920
 I struggle mentally in that, like we were talking about

14:31.920 --> 14:34.320
 on the podcast we did previously,

14:34.320 --> 14:37.800
 you and I on my podcast said, I'm not a fan of my work.

14:37.800 --> 14:38.920
 I'm not a fan of what I do.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.000
 I'm my harshest critic.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.480
 So anytime anybody says something bad about me,

14:43.480 --> 14:46.960
 I'm like, listen, I said way worse about myself.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.040
 I don't like anything I do.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.040
 I'm ruthlessly introspective.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.880
 And I will continue to be that way.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.080
 Cause that's the only way you could be good as a comedian.

14:57.080 --> 14:57.920
 There's no other way.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.920
 You can't just think you're awesome and just go out there.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.040
 You have to be like picking apart everything you do.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.240
 But there's a balance to that too,

15:04.240 --> 15:05.440
 cause you have to have enough confidence

15:05.440 --> 15:06.800
 to go out there and perform.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.280
 You can't think, oh my God, I suck.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.320
 I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing

15:10.320 --> 15:11.600
 because I put in all that work.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.360
 And one of the reasons why I put in all that work

15:13.360 --> 15:17.520
 is I don't like the end result most of the time.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.640
 So I need to work at it all the time.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.320
 And then there's physical struggle,

15:21.320 --> 15:23.960
 which I think balances everything out.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.680
 Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy

15:27.680 --> 15:30.720
 that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery,

15:30.720 --> 15:33.240
 where if you have extra charge,

15:33.240 --> 15:35.000
 it's like it leaks out of the top

15:35.000 --> 15:37.600
 and it becomes unmanageable and messy.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.240
 And that's how my psyche is.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.560
 If I have too much energy,

15:41.560 --> 15:46.440
 if I'm not exerting myself in a violent way,

15:46.440 --> 15:49.960
 like an explosive way, like wearing myself out,

15:49.960 --> 15:52.760
 I just don't like the way the world is.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.640
 I don't like the way I interface with the world.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.000
 I'm too tense.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.440
 I'm too quick to be upset about things.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.040
 But when I work out hard

16:03.040 --> 16:07.160
 and I put in a brutal training session, everything's fine.

16:07.160 --> 16:12.160
 Well, the first time I talked to you, Jerry, you were doing

16:13.800 --> 16:15.800
 Sober October.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.680
 And there's something in your eyes,

16:18.640 --> 16:19.960
 like I think you've talked about

16:19.960 --> 16:22.920
 that you exercise the demons out essentially.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.000
 So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you

16:26.000 --> 16:27.840
 that you don't like out.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.680
 There's a darkness in you there,

16:30.680 --> 16:34.640
 like the competitiveness and the focus of that person.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.440
 That was a scary time in a lot of ways,

16:36.440 --> 16:38.040
 that Sober October thing.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.440
 Because my friends, we were all talking shit, right?

16:41.440 --> 16:43.360
 Because we're competing against each other

16:43.360 --> 16:44.600
 in these fitness challenges.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.480
 And you had one point,

16:48.480 --> 16:50.280
 like you got a certain amount of points

16:50.280 --> 16:54.520
 for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.520
 And one day I got 1100 points.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.520
 So I did seven hours on an elliptical machine

17:00.520 --> 17:03.600
 watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick

17:03.600 --> 17:05.040
 where he murders all those people in the bathhouse.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.160
 I watched it probably 50 times in a row.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.400
 I went crazy.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.280
 I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way

17:11.280 --> 17:16.080
 where it brought me back to my fighting days.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.240
 It was like the same, that person came out again.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.280
 It was like, well, I didn't even know he was in there.

17:20.280 --> 17:25.280
 It's like they're like an assassin, like a killer.

17:25.920 --> 17:30.920
 Like I felt like a different person.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.600
 Is it echoes of like what Mike Tyson talked about essentially?

17:34.600 --> 17:35.440
 Like the...

17:35.440 --> 17:37.800
 Maybe, but no orgasm in the oceans.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.040
 All the crazy shit that he was saying.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.000
 Is there a violent person in there?

17:44.000 --> 17:44.840
 Oh yeah.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.800
 Yeah, there's a lot of violence in me for sure.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.600
 I don't know if it's genetic or learned

17:49.600 --> 17:52.240
 or it's because during my formative years

17:52.240 --> 17:56.720
 from the time I was 15 till I was 22, all I did was fight.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.160
 That was all I did.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.080
 That was all I did.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.040
 All I did was train and compete.

18:01.040 --> 18:01.880
 That's all I did.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.040
 That was my whole life.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.760
 Is it connected to...

18:04.760 --> 18:07.720
 So your mom and dad broke up early on.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.360
 Is it connected to the dad at all?

18:10.360 --> 18:13.840
 I'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent

18:13.840 --> 18:16.320
 and it made me feel very scared to be around him.

18:16.320 --> 18:20.880
 But I also think it's connected in who he was as a human

18:20.880 --> 18:23.560
 is transferred into my DNA.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.880
 I think there's a certain amount of...

18:25.880 --> 18:30.400
 I mean, to be prejudiced against myself,

18:30.400 --> 18:32.720
 I look like a violent person.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.520
 If I didn't know me, even the way I'm built,

18:35.520 --> 18:36.800
 not even just the working out part,

18:36.800 --> 18:38.320
 just the size of my hands

18:38.320 --> 18:41.360
 and there's the width of my shoulders.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.920
 There's most likely a lot of violence in my history,

18:44.920 --> 18:47.240
 in my past, in my ancestry.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.240
 And I think we minimize that with people.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.880
 So much of your behavior, when I see my daughter,

18:55.880 --> 18:58.360
 I have one daughter that's obsessive

18:58.360 --> 19:01.240
 in terms of she wants to get really good at things

19:01.240 --> 19:03.280
 and she'll practice things all day long.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.960
 And it's 100% my personality.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.840
 She's me in female form.

19:09.840 --> 19:14.000
 But without the anger as much and without the fear,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.560
 she has loving household and everything like that.

19:16.560 --> 19:21.280
 But she has this intense obsession with doing things

19:21.280 --> 19:23.400
 and doing things really well and getting better.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.240
 What's the point?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.600
 We have to tell her, stop doing hand springs in the house.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.240
 Stop, stop, come on, just sit down, have dinner.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.240
 Like one more, one more.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.520
 Like she's just like, she's psycho.

19:34.120 --> 19:39.120
 And I think there's a lot of behavior and personality

19:42.480 --> 19:45.720
 and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.480
 We don't really know, right?

19:47.480 --> 19:51.800
 We don't know how much of who you are genetically

19:51.800 --> 19:54.520
 is learned behavior, nature or nurture.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.080
 We don't know if it's learned behavior

19:57.080 --> 19:58.200
 or whether or not it's something

19:58.200 --> 19:59.720
 that's intrinsically a part of you

19:59.720 --> 20:02.000
 because of who your parents were.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.640
 I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.480
 There's certainly.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.320
 And then you channeled it.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.480
 So you figured out it's basically your life

20:10.480 --> 20:13.320
 is a productive exploration of how to channel that.

20:13.320 --> 20:18.320
 Yes, how to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down

20:18.760 --> 20:19.880
 and calm down.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.200
 There's another person in there.

20:21.200 --> 20:26.200
 Like there's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person

20:26.360 --> 20:28.320
 who just wants to laugh and have fun.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.640
 And then there's that dude who comes out

20:30.640 --> 20:32.680
 when I did Sober October.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.560
 That guy's scary.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.720
 I don't like that guy.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.440
 That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.440
 It's like, I mean, when I was competing, it was necessary.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.360
 But it makes me remember.

20:44.360 --> 20:48.480
 I didn't really remember what I used to be like until that.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.840
 It's like when I'm working out seven hours a day

20:51.840 --> 20:53.680
 and just so obsessed.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.960
 And all I was thinking about was winning.

20:55.960 --> 20:56.960
 That's all I was thinking about.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.280
 Like if they were working out five hours a day,

20:59.280 --> 21:01.760
 I wanted them to know that I was gonna work out

21:01.760 --> 21:04.480
 an extra three hours and I was gonna get up early

21:04.480 --> 21:05.720
 and I was gonna text them all.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.320
 Hey, pussies, I'm up already.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.520
 Take pictures, send selfies.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.160
 I was like, you're gonna die.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.000
 I kept telling them, you're all gonna die.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.840
 You try to keep up with me, you're gonna die.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.600
 You weren't fully joking.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.040
 No, I wasn't joking at all.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.360
 That's what was fucked up about it.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.480
 This is the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins

21:21.480 --> 21:26.480
 and what I saw in you during that time is like,

21:26.760 --> 21:30.760
 this guy, like, this is why I've been avoiding

21:30.760 --> 21:32.000
 David Ganga's recently.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.040
 Is like, cause he wants to meet,

21:35.040 --> 21:36.960
 he wants to talk on this podcast,

21:36.960 --> 21:39.720
 but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.160
 And I felt like this is a person,

21:42.160 --> 21:44.440
 if I spend any time in this realm,

21:44.440 --> 21:48.280
 if I spend any time with a Joe Rogan of that sober October,

21:48.280 --> 21:50.880
 like, I might have to die to get out.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.680
 Like, there's this kind of...

21:52.680 --> 21:55.560
 Yeah, there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.640
 I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today

21:57.640 --> 21:59.400
 of Goggins draining his knee.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.640
 That would stop me from running ever again

22:01.640 --> 22:03.280
 because I would think in my head, okay,

22:03.280 --> 22:04.560
 I'm gonna ruin my cartilage.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.240
 I'm gonna need a knee replacement.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.840
 I would start thinking, I would go down that line,

22:08.840 --> 22:13.720
 but he is perpetually in this push it mindset,

22:13.720 --> 22:16.280
 what he calls the dog in him.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.080
 That dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.560
 And that's who he is.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.520
 That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational

22:24.520 --> 22:27.720
 and he's fuel for millions and millions of people.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.680
 I mean, he really is.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.600
 He motivates people in a way that is so powerful,

22:32.600 --> 22:35.160
 but it can be very destructive.

22:35.160 --> 22:39.800
 I know now, especially after the sober October thing,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.560
 that that thing's still in me.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.080
 I didn't know,

22:43.080 --> 22:45.480
 so I really haven't done anything physically competitive,

22:45.480 --> 22:48.000
 except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.320
 It came out then too.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.720
 That came out too.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.800
 That got creepy too, but luckily that never happened.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.760
 But that was many months of training,

22:56.760 --> 22:59.600
 like training twice a day, every day,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.960
 kickboxing in the morning, jiu jitsu at night.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.200
 I was just going and going and going and going.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.880
 And I was just thinking just all day long.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.720
 But it fucks with all the other aspects of your life.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.960
 It fucks with your friendships.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.600
 It fucks with my comedy.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.880
 It fucks with everything.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.480
 Because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.280
 It's a mindset of a conqueror.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.400
 The conqueror. Yeah.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.240
 Destroyer.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.200
 That's why it's so interesting to see Mike Tyson

23:24.200 --> 23:25.320
 make the switch.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.120
 It's clear that whatever that is, however that fight goes,

23:29.120 --> 23:30.920
 there's a switch.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.800
 He stepped into a different dimension.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.040
 Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.440
 And Roy's going to be on before the fight.

23:38.440 --> 23:42.640
 I'm so curious to see how it goes down,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.880
 but genuinely concerned.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.840
 Because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.880
 And Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.760
 And that's a lot.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.600
 I don't know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house,

23:54.600 --> 23:55.920
 of where Mike Tyson goes.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.040
 I don't know.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.440
 I don't know if he has that room.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.600
 Mike doesn't have a room.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.560
 He's got an empire in there.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.040
 He opens up the door.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.000
 He opens up the door.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.120
 There's a whole empire in his head.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.680
 And he's in that firmly.

24:08.680 --> 24:12.520
 When he got out of the weed and started training again,

24:12.520 --> 24:13.720
 you could see it in him.

24:13.720 --> 24:18.000
 And by the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.280
 He looks like a fucking Adonis.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.040
 I mean, he looks ready to go.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.120
 It's crazy.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.520
 Yeah, I watch his videos of him.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.800
 What about you?

24:25.800 --> 24:28.560
 Have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.160
 No, for that very reason.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.120
 I don't want to get obsessed.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.040
 That's my number one concern.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.800
 I had to quit video games when we were playing video games

24:36.800 --> 24:37.320
 in the studio.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.640
 I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day,

24:39.640 --> 24:40.480
 like out of nowhere.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.840
 All of a sudden, I was playing five hours a day.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.400
 I was coming home late for dinner.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.600
 I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games

24:46.600 --> 24:47.640
 and playing.

24:47.640 --> 24:48.960
 I get obsessed with things.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.640
 And I have to recognize what that is

24:51.640 --> 24:54.960
 and these competitive things, like competitive, especially

24:54.960 --> 24:57.520
 like really exciting competitive things like video games.

24:57.520 --> 24:58.920
 They're very dangerous for me.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.240
 The ultimate competitive video game is like jiu jitsu.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.280
 And if I was young, I most certainly would have done it.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.240
 If I didn't have a very clear career path,

25:08.240 --> 25:09.640
 it was something that I enjoyed.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.440
 My concern would be that I would become a professional jiu jitsu

25:12.440 --> 25:14.120
 fighter when I was young.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.920
 And then I would not have the energy

25:15.920 --> 25:18.280
 to do stand up and do all the other things

25:18.280 --> 25:20.640
 that I wound up doing as a career.

25:20.640 --> 25:25.240
 When I was 21, I quit my job teaching.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.280
 I was teaching at Boston University.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.000
 I was teaching Taekwondo there.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.520
 And I knew, and I also had my own school in Revere.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.400
 I knew I couldn't do it right.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.440
 And also be doing stand up comedy.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.320
 I knew I couldn't do both of those things.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.200
 There was no way.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.480
 You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force

25:44.480 --> 25:45.800
 within you to make sure.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.320
 Yes, I'd have to know how to manage my mental illness.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.560
 That's a very particular mental illness.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.000
 And I think that mental illness, again,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.640
 my formative years from 15 until I was 21ish, 22,

25:59.640 --> 26:03.560
 those years were spent constantly

26:03.560 --> 26:05.720
 obsessed with martial arts.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.040
 That was my whole day.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.240
 I mean, I trained almost every day.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.880
 The only time I would not train is if I was either injured

26:11.880 --> 26:15.640
 or if I was exhausted, if I needed a day off.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.000
 But I was obsessed.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.320
 And so that part of my personality

26:20.320 --> 26:22.000
 that I haven't nurtured is always

26:22.000 --> 26:24.080
 going to be there under the surface.

26:24.080 --> 26:28.320
 And when it gets reignited by something, it's very weird.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.600
 It's a weird feeling.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.760
 And it can get reignited with a video game.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.720
 It can get reignited with anything.

26:33.720 --> 26:38.160
 That obsessive whatever it is, that competitive demon.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.600
 Yeah, the way you talk about guitar,

26:39.600 --> 26:42.080
 I know you would fall in love with playing guitar.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.400
 But I think you're very wise to not touch that thing.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.960
 That's why I won't golf.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.280
 I have friends who want to golf.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.680
 I'm like, mm mm, I don't fucking want that thing.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.200
 So a lot of people ask me like,

26:52.200 --> 26:55.200
 what's Joe Rogan's jiu jitsu game like?

26:55.200 --> 26:59.800
 Like assuming that I somehow spend hours

26:59.800 --> 27:02.480
 rolling with you before and after a track.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.640
 I mean, what's a good, you should at some point

27:05.640 --> 27:06.880
 show a technique or something.

27:06.880 --> 27:07.720
 That'd be fun.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.440
 Sure, I mean, I've got this technique online.

27:10.440 --> 27:15.320
 Oh, I saw you doing, I think, head and arm something online.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.240
 Yeah, I did.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.160
 I fucked my neck up doing head and arm chokes.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.240
 I did them so much that I,

27:21.240 --> 27:24.680
 because you use your neck so much with head and arm chokes,

27:24.680 --> 27:27.320
 I developed like a real kink in my neck.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.000
 And it turned out I had a bulging disc.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.280
 And, you know.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.120
 So you do it on that, just one side?

27:33.120 --> 27:35.800
 Well, it was, no, I could do it on the left side,

27:35.800 --> 27:38.160
 but I definitely am better on the right side.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.400
 The right side was my best side.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.120
 So if you were to compete, let's say,

27:41.120 --> 27:42.480
 like what's your A game?

27:42.480 --> 27:45.040
 Where would you go from standing up?

27:45.040 --> 27:46.680
 How would you go to submission?

27:46.680 --> 27:49.400
 Would you pull guard, would you take down?

27:49.400 --> 27:51.680
 How would you pass guard?

27:51.680 --> 27:52.920
 I don't have good takedowns.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.240
 I was not a good wrestler.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.600
 So I would most likely either pull guard

27:57.600 --> 27:59.240
 or I would pull half guard.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.080
 Do you have a good guard?

28:00.080 --> 28:00.920
 Yes.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.880
 Are you comfortable being on your butt, on your back?

28:02.880 --> 28:04.800
 Yes, I'm very flexible.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.000
 So I have a good, my rubber guard is pretty good.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.840
 You go to rubber guard.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.600
 Yeah, I have good arm bars and good triangles off my back.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.000
 But I also have a very good half guard,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.040
 but my top game is my best.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.520
 I have a very strong top game.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
 Do you have a half guard?

28:19.520 --> 28:21.960
 Do you have a preference of like what kind of guard

28:21.960 --> 28:23.440
 and how to pass that guard?

28:23.440 --> 28:28.440
 And like, yeah, like, is there a specific game plan?

28:28.640 --> 28:29.480
 Like, do you?

28:29.480 --> 28:32.720
 Double underhooks from half guard is the game plan for me.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.680
 If I can get double underhooks from half guard,

28:34.680 --> 28:36.240
 I could sweep a lot of people.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.920
 Underhooks of what?

28:37.920 --> 28:38.760
 Sorry, the arms or the legs?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.160
 So half guard, lockdown, right?

28:41.160 --> 28:44.120
 Half guard, go into lockdown, double underhooks.

28:44.120 --> 28:44.960
 Got it.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.320
 Suck the body, suck the body.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.160
 Just pressure.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.800
 And yeah, massive pressure.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.720
 And then inch my way into a position we call the dog fight

28:52.720 --> 28:54.320
 and inch my way to a position

28:54.320 --> 28:56.680
 where I could get the person on their back.

28:56.680 --> 28:57.520
 Yeah, that's what,

28:57.520 --> 28:58.480
 cause you did show me,

28:58.480 --> 29:01.360
 I still disagree with you about the tie thing.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.200
 The tie.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.040
 That you can choke somebody with it.

29:03.040 --> 29:03.880
 Oh, tie is wrong.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.120
 So wrong, so wrong.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.440
 Well, it's not wrong with you.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.520
 With you, it's wrong.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.360
 Cause you know.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.400
 No, I think there's a system.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.880
 I have this thing, Madonna hair,

29:11.880 --> 29:12.960
 we're gonna figure it out.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.800
 Okay.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.640
 But the.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.040
 There's Velcro on the back.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.600
 No, but see, that's, you're just not the.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.440
 You're cheating.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.040
 You're not, you're the exact, that's cheating.

29:20.040 --> 29:24.200
 Yeah, you did, I did feel when you showed me,

29:24.200 --> 29:25.960
 I think you showed me the rubber guard

29:25.960 --> 29:27.040
 cause it's still a guard.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.240
 That's a little bit foreign to me.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.920
 I just felt that you can immediately feel,

29:30.920 --> 29:32.120
 not with the rubber guard,

29:32.120 --> 29:34.600
 but the way you move your body is,

29:34.600 --> 29:37.840
 you're like a Shanji type of guy

29:37.840 --> 29:40.560
 who knows how to control another human being.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.360
 So like some people are a little bit more,

29:43.360 --> 29:44.920
 I would say agile and technical,

29:44.920 --> 29:47.160
 like playful and kind of.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.000
 Loose.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.760
 Loose and they work on transition, transition, transition.

29:51.760 --> 29:52.920
 You're a control guy.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.680
 Like you know how to control position

29:54.680 --> 29:56.200
 and advanced position.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.280
 Donna hair is the same way.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.440
 He's all about control.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.280
 My game is smush.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.120
 That's my game.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.200
 Smush you, grab a hold of you.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.960
 Once I have you, why would I let you go?

30:04.960 --> 30:06.880
 That's my thought is like, why would I let you go?

30:06.880 --> 30:09.680
 I just wanna incrementally move to a better position

30:09.680 --> 30:11.240
 until I can strangle you.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.280
 But I'm much more into strangling people

30:14.280 --> 30:15.320
 than anything else.

30:15.320 --> 30:20.320
 Yeah, which is a great MMA approach for jiu jitsu.

30:20.520 --> 30:24.320
 Well, too many people don't tap when you get their arms.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.360
 And I'm not opposed to arm bars.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.360
 I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.080
 And quit from pressure too.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.480
 I mean, quit mentally.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.320
 There's nothing like that.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.520
 You can't breathe.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.080
 If you've got a guy who's like a really good top game guy

30:40.080 --> 30:42.800
 and he mounts you, and I'm a big fan of mounting

30:42.800 --> 30:47.360
 with my legs crossed, like a guard, like a top guard.

30:47.360 --> 30:52.240
 And so I can squeeze with both legs, smush.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.880
 And I'm just looking for people to make mistakes

30:54.880 --> 30:57.720
 and slowly incrementally bettering my position

30:57.720 --> 31:00.040
 until I can get something locked up.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.280
 I love jiu jitsu though, man.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.480
 I just wish it didn't injure you.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.440
 Jiu jitsu is like, if your joints were more durable,

31:06.440 --> 31:08.640
 they could figure out a way to make joints more durable.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.600
 God, I could do jiu jitsu forever.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.240
 So much fun.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.480
 I actually, I talked to this roboticist, Russ Tedrick.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.800
 He builds, he's one of the world class people

31:17.800 --> 31:19.200
 that builds humanoid robots.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.600
 You were interested in Boston Dynamics.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.360
 He's one of the key people in that kind of robotics.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.480
 So I asked him the stupidest question of like,

31:25.480 --> 31:30.040
 how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion?

31:31.400 --> 31:34.120
 And yeah, it's actually a really, really tough problem.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.040
 It's the same thing that makes somebody

31:38.040 --> 31:41.120
 like Danielle Comey on the wrestling side special,

31:41.120 --> 31:42.560
 because you have to understand the movement

31:42.560 --> 31:45.920
 of the human body in ways that's so difficult to teach.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.080
 It's so subtle.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.840
 The timing, the pressure points, the leverage,

31:49.840 --> 31:50.680
 all those kinds of things.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.880
 That's just for the clinch situation.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.680
 And then the movement for the striking is very difficult.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.840
 As long as you're not allowed as a robot

31:58.840 --> 32:03.560
 to use your natural abilities of having a lot more power.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.480
 Right, a lot more power and more durable.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.320
 Right.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.640
 The human body, like especially meniscus.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.040
 Like you see the heel hook game,

32:12.040 --> 32:14.200
 like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.160
 Like all those guys wind up with torched knees.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.520
 Everyone's got torched knees.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.400
 Everyone's knees are torn apart.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.320
 And you don't grow new meniscus.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.640
 You know, that's like one of those joints where,

32:25.640 --> 32:29.720
 man, when it goes, those guys are 28 years old,

32:29.720 --> 32:31.720
 they've blown out knees.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.000
 Let me ask the ridiculous question.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.680
 What do you think, we're talking about cops,

32:34.680 --> 32:38.280
 what do you think is the best martial arts self defense?

32:38.280 --> 32:39.480
 For sure, jiu jitsu.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.320
 Yeah, for sure.

32:40.320 --> 32:41.160
 Wrestling?

32:41.160 --> 32:43.720
 I think grappling, I should say.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.160
 Judo as well, especially in a cold climate,

32:46.160 --> 32:48.720
 if you get someone who's got like a heavy winter jacket on,

32:48.720 --> 32:50.800
 my God, like judo's an incredible martial art.

32:50.800 --> 32:51.640
 Plus concrete.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.600
 That's the worst place to be,

32:54.600 --> 32:57.480
 with a heavy winter jacket with a judo specialist

32:57.480 --> 33:00.320
 and you're standing up with them, oh my God.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.920
 But I think grappling,

33:01.920 --> 33:03.800
 because in most self defense situations,

33:03.800 --> 33:05.760
 it usually winds up with grappling.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.280
 You're definitely better off, though,

33:07.280 --> 33:08.720
 knowing some striking,

33:08.720 --> 33:10.200
 because there's nothing more terrifying

33:10.200 --> 33:11.560
 than when you go to take someone down,

33:11.560 --> 33:14.440
 they actually have takedown skills, but they can fight.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.280
 And so they have takedown defense

33:16.280 --> 33:17.360
 and they know how to fight,

33:17.360 --> 33:19.040
 and then you don't know how to stand up.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.320
 Like the worst thing in the world

33:20.320 --> 33:21.640
 is seeing someone like reaching

33:21.640 --> 33:25.280
 who doesn't know how to do striking and someone cracks you.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.200
 What about all that Krav Maga talk,

33:27.200 --> 33:30.040
 which is like, you know, the whole line of argument

33:30.040 --> 33:31.760
 that says that jiu jitsu and wrestling

33:31.760 --> 33:35.040
 and all of these sports, they fundamentally take you away

33:35.040 --> 33:36.360
 from the nature of violence.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.440
 So they're just teaching you how to play

33:39.400 --> 33:44.160
 versus the reality of violence

33:44.160 --> 33:47.800
 that is involved in like a self defense situation

33:47.800 --> 33:52.040
 that is a totally different set of skills would be needed.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.360
 In general, the people that say that jiu jitsu

33:55.360 --> 33:59.720
 or other martial arts, it's more of a sport

33:59.720 --> 34:03.880
 and they don't really understand violence.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.160
 In general, the people that say that suck.

34:08.200 --> 34:10.440
 Anybody who thinks like, someone's like,

34:10.440 --> 34:12.000
 you know, hey man, I'll just bite you.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.680
 I'm like, are you gonna bite me?

34:13.680 --> 34:14.720
 Okay.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.920
 Do you think I'm gonna bite you too?

34:15.920 --> 34:16.800
 What do you think of that?

34:16.800 --> 34:18.480
 What if I punch you in your fucking face?

34:18.480 --> 34:19.840
 You think you're still gonna bite me

34:19.840 --> 34:21.480
 when you can't even see?

34:21.480 --> 34:24.000
 When you barely even know you're alive

34:24.000 --> 34:25.560
 and I choke you unconscious?

34:25.560 --> 34:27.440
 If someone's really good at jiu jitsu,

34:27.440 --> 34:29.880
 good luck stabbing them with your keys.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.400
 You know, you don't have a chance.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.240
 You don't have a chance.

34:32.240 --> 34:33.080
 If someone's much better than you

34:33.080 --> 34:35.440
 and they trip you and get you on your back

34:35.440 --> 34:37.680
 and then they fucking elbow you in your face

34:37.680 --> 34:39.480
 and then get a head and arm choke on you,

34:39.480 --> 34:41.840
 all that crap, my gosh, it's out the window, son.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.840
 You're way better off learning what works on trained killers.

34:47.240 --> 34:48.920
 Like this whole idea that you're gonna poke someone

34:48.920 --> 34:50.760
 in the eye and then you're gonna kick them in the nuts.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.280
 Like you're going through these drills

34:53.280 --> 34:55.560
 that yeah, it's good to know what to do

34:55.560 --> 34:57.800
 if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight.

34:57.800 --> 35:00.200
 It's way better to know what to do

35:00.200 --> 35:02.240
 to someone who knows how to fight.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.800
 That's the best thing.

35:03.800 --> 35:07.320
 Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.920
 Like all that practice self defense

35:09.920 --> 35:11.680
 and they go, it's gonna come at you with a knife.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.240
 You're gonna grab the wrist and do that.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.760
 Like it's good to know self defense,

35:16.760 --> 35:18.880
 but it's much more important

35:18.880 --> 35:22.080
 to understand martial arts comprehensively.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.360
 When you understand martial arts comprehensively,

35:24.360 --> 35:27.400
 like there's no, I shouldn't say there's no Krav Maga guys,

35:27.400 --> 35:32.040
 but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy

35:32.040 --> 35:34.560
 and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight

35:34.560 --> 35:35.720
 and the mixed martial arts guy

35:35.720 --> 35:39.440
 who's a trained killer all around didn't fuck that guy up.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.000
 That's what I would expect would happen.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.680
 I would not think that some guy

35:44.680 --> 35:48.080
 who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that

35:48.080 --> 35:50.600
 and prepares for the streets is gonna be able

35:50.600 --> 35:53.320
 to handle a person who trains with killers

35:53.320 --> 35:54.520
 on a day to day basis,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.320
 who rolls with jujitsu black belts,

35:56.320 --> 35:58.120
 who trains with Muay Thai champions.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.880
 Like the best martial arts are the martial arts

36:01.880 --> 36:03.800
 that work on martial artists,

36:03.800 --> 36:06.400
 not the martial arts that work on untrained people.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.120
 What about, we're in Texas now.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.360
 What about guns?

36:09.360 --> 36:10.760
 Well, that's the best martial art.

36:10.760 --> 36:14.960
 No, but would you, like in this crazy time,

36:14.960 --> 36:17.040
 should people carry guns?

36:17.040 --> 36:19.200
 It's not a bad idea to have a gun

36:19.200 --> 36:22.240
 because if you need a gun, you have a gun.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.040
 And if you don't need a gun,

36:24.040 --> 36:25.680
 if you're a person with self control,

36:25.680 --> 36:26.800
 you're not gonna use it.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.440
 You're not gonna just randomly use it,

36:28.440 --> 36:30.480
 but you have something to protect you.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.280
 This is the whole idea of the Second Amendment.

36:32.280 --> 36:33.320
 The whole idea of the Second Amendment

36:33.320 --> 36:34.920
 gets distorted by mass shootings

36:34.920 --> 36:37.200
 or by terrible people who murder people

36:37.200 --> 36:38.080
 and do terrible things.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.920
 But all those things are real,

36:40.920 --> 36:45.920
 but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy

36:46.160 --> 36:49.200
 of having a firearm and defending your family

36:49.200 --> 36:50.760
 or defending your life.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.200
 And there are real live situations

36:53.200 --> 36:55.520
 where people have had firearms

36:55.520 --> 36:58.160
 and it's protected them or their loved ones

36:58.160 --> 36:59.880
 or they've stopped shooters.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.640
 There's many of these stories,

37:01.640 --> 37:02.840
 but people don't like those stories

37:02.840 --> 37:06.760
 because then it tends to lead to this gun culture argument,

37:06.760 --> 37:08.520
 this pro gun culture argument

37:08.520 --> 37:11.200
 that people find very uncomfortable.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.000
 Human beings are messy

37:13.000 --> 37:15.280
 and we're messy in so many different ways, right?

37:15.280 --> 37:19.040
 We're messy emotionally, we're messy physically,

37:19.040 --> 37:22.160
 but we're also messy in what's good or bad.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.800
 We want things to be binary.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.280
 We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero.

37:27.280 --> 37:31.280
 And they're not, but there is crime in the world.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.760
 There is violence in the world

37:32.760 --> 37:35.080
 and you're better off knowing how to fight

37:35.080 --> 37:37.800
 and you're better off knowing how to defend yourself

37:37.800 --> 37:39.600
 and you're better off having a gun.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.920
 And I generally think that guns,

37:41.920 --> 37:44.400
 I do like the idea that guns,

37:44.400 --> 37:46.520
 the Second Amendment helps protect the First Amendment.

37:46.520 --> 37:50.240
 There's a kind of sense that puts me at ease

37:50.240 --> 37:53.560
 knowing that so many people in this country have guns

37:53.560 --> 37:55.520
 that, I mean, Alex Jones,

37:55.520 --> 37:58.400
 I just listened to one episode of Infowars

37:58.400 --> 38:00.040
 for the first time.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.600
 Boy, he reminds me like when I drank some tequila,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.480
 I felt like I'm going to some dark places today.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.600
 That's how I feel like listening to him.

38:08.600 --> 38:13.600
 But he talks about like that he worries about martial law.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.040
 So basically government overreach by,

38:16.040 --> 38:17.840
 which happened throughout history.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.680
 Like there's something to worry about there,

38:20.680 --> 38:22.840
 but it puts me at ease knowing

38:22.840 --> 38:25.760
 that so much of the population has guns

38:25.760 --> 38:28.160
 that people, government would think twice

38:28.160 --> 38:31.280
 before instituting martial law on cities.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.720
 But I actually was asking almost like

38:33.720 --> 38:35.360
 on the individual level,

38:35.360 --> 38:39.400
 I maybe shouldn't say this, but I don't yet own a gun.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.560
 And I felt that if I carry a gun

38:42.560 --> 38:46.200
 statistically just for me as a human,

38:46.200 --> 38:47.240
 knowing my psychology,

38:47.240 --> 38:49.880
 I feel like I'm more likely to die.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.640
 Like I feel like I would put myself in situations

38:53.640 --> 38:54.480
 that I shouldn't.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.600
 Like the way I will see the world will change

38:57.600 --> 39:01.200
 because my natural feeling is like when somebody,

39:01.200 --> 39:04.240
 when I was in Philly and I knew late at night,

39:04.240 --> 39:08.400
 if West Philly, when some guy looks at you

39:08.400 --> 39:09.920
 and you can immediately calculate

39:09.920 --> 39:12.000
 that this is a dangerous human being,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.600
 it starts with a monkey look at first.

39:14.600 --> 39:17.160
 Like I'm a bigger monkey than you.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.240
 And that's where I found like, for example,

39:19.240 --> 39:21.120
 I'll do the beta thing of just looking down

39:21.120 --> 39:23.200
 and turning away and just getting out of trouble

39:23.200 --> 39:25.080
 like very politely.

39:25.080 --> 39:28.040
 And basically that kind of approach,

39:28.040 --> 39:30.000
 because if you have,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.760
 in terms of getting out of serious violent situations,

39:32.760 --> 39:35.560
 like serious something where you could die

39:35.560 --> 39:39.440
 versus if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be,

39:39.440 --> 39:43.080
 that there would be that cowboy monkey thing

39:43.080 --> 39:45.640
 where I would want to put myself in situations

39:45.640 --> 39:48.800
 where I'm a little bit of a savior, even of myself

39:48.800 --> 39:53.200
 and almost create danger, which can no longer,

39:53.200 --> 39:57.080
 like the escalation of which I can no longer control.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.160
 Well, you're talking about taking a gun somewhere

39:59.160 --> 40:00.640
 versus having a gun in your home.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.200
 Yes, yes, I mean carry on me.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.280
 That's a different situation

40:03.280 --> 40:07.840
 and much harder to get a warrant or a license for that.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.400
 Control, concealed carry licenses,

40:10.400 --> 40:12.320
 especially in Massachusetts, they don't come easy.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.080
 Well message, yeah, that's a whole nother thing.

40:14.080 --> 40:14.920
 Yeah.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.400
 You're saying gun in the home.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.560
 Yeah, gun in the home, having a gun,

40:18.560 --> 40:19.960
 knowing how to use a gun.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.080
 Like I know how to use a gun.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.960
 I've trained many hours,

40:23.960 --> 40:27.240
 learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.800
 There's a bunch of videos of me doing it on Instagram.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.560
 I practice and I think it's good to understand

40:34.560 --> 40:36.160
 how to be accurate.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.880
 So I've been a fan of your podcast for a long time.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.800
 You don't often talk about it

40:40.800 --> 40:42.280
 because you're always kind of looking forward,

40:42.280 --> 40:45.720
 but if you look at the old studio that you just left,

40:45.720 --> 40:48.960
 is there some epic memories that stand out to you

40:48.960 --> 40:52.000
 that like you almost look back,

40:52.000 --> 40:53.800
 I can't believe this happened?

40:53.800 --> 40:57.000
 Oh yeah, almost too many of them to count.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.360
 Is there something that pops into mind now?

40:58.360 --> 41:01.320
 All of them, Elon Musk blowing that flamethrower

41:01.320 --> 41:04.320
 in the middle of the hallway, I got a video of that.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.400
 Have you seen the video of it?

41:05.400 --> 41:06.960
 Yeah, I think you posted it on Instagram.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.080
 I think I did too.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.680
 Yeah, he's a mad man.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.560
 Having Bernie Sanders in there,

41:12.560 --> 41:16.160
 just all the fun fight companions we did

41:16.160 --> 41:18.760
 and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz

41:18.760 --> 41:21.240
 and Duncan Trussell and there were so many.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.680
 There were so many moments.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.720
 Podcasts, this is a weird art form

41:27.720 --> 41:30.920
 and it almost sounds silly,

41:30.920 --> 41:32.800
 but it almost seems like something that chose me

41:32.800 --> 41:34.480
 rather than I chose it.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.920
 I think of that all the time in some strange way.

41:36.920 --> 41:40.400
 It's like I'm showing up as like an antenna

41:40.400 --> 41:43.240
 and I just plug in and twist on

41:43.240 --> 41:46.800
 and then I take in the thing and I put it together

41:46.800 --> 41:49.840
 and I'm like a passenger of this weird ride.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.640
 Yeah, you've talked about this before.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.080
 I really like this idea

41:54.920 --> 41:57.840
 that human beings are just carriers of these ideas.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
 Ideas are the ones who are breeding.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.920
 So in a sense like the idea found you as a useful brain

42:02.920 --> 42:06.560
 to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.400
 Yeah.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.640
 Because when I think about your podcast,

42:12.640 --> 42:13.800
 I think about Joey Diaz.

42:13.800 --> 42:16.160
 I think about all those comedians you've had.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.560
 I mean, I think you've had Joey on,

42:18.560 --> 42:22.800
 I mean, maybe close to 50 times, some crazy number.

42:22.800 --> 42:27.800
 Is there, I mean, he is over the top offensive,

42:27.960 --> 42:30.600
 just that's who he is to the core.

42:30.600 --> 42:35.600
 Is there some sense where you wondered like

42:38.080 --> 42:42.040
 whether it's right to have the Spotify episode number one

42:42.040 --> 42:44.720
 with Duncan Dressel for five hours?

42:44.720 --> 42:47.160
 No, I wanted to do it that way.

42:47.160 --> 42:50.920
 That's why we wore NASA suits and we got high as fuck.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.160
 It's like, that's the whole idea behind it.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.800
 I mean, can you introspect that a little bit?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.120
 Like, can you think, like, what is that?

42:56.120 --> 42:57.240
 Cause that's rare.

42:57.240 --> 43:02.240
 It's such a rare thing to do because you're not supposed

43:03.000 --> 43:06.680
 to talk to Duncan Dressel with a huge platform

43:06.680 --> 43:08.280
 that you have five hours.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.400
 Why not?

43:09.400 --> 43:12.720
 Because Donald Trump apparently watches your podcast.

43:12.720 --> 43:16.560
 So just the idea that there's these,

43:16.560 --> 43:18.200
 I mean, that's what I think about,

43:18.200 --> 43:21.360
 these CEOs write to me that they listen to the podcast

43:21.360 --> 43:26.280
 that I do and I have somebody like a David Fravor

43:26.280 --> 43:27.800
 and I was nervous about it.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.360
 I was nervous to have a conversation.

43:29.360 --> 43:33.160
 For me, David Fravor is a Duncan Dressel, which is like.

43:33.160 --> 43:36.360
 Just because of his experiences with UFOs.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.040
 Yeah, even just the way he sees the world

43:39.040 --> 43:40.400
 because he is open.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.360
 I don't know if he's always like this,

43:41.360 --> 43:43.600
 but he opened himself to the possibility

43:43.600 --> 43:45.840
 of unconventional ideas.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.720
 Most people in the scientific community kind of say,

43:48.720 --> 43:50.400
 well, I don't really want to believe anything

43:50.400 --> 43:52.960
 that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.000
 And so that was to me like a step.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.360
 And as the thing somehow becomes more popular,

43:58.360 --> 44:01.000
 there becomes this fear of like,

44:01.000 --> 44:04.160
 well, should I talk to this person or not?

44:04.160 --> 44:06.920
 And I mean, you're an inspiration in saying like,

44:06.920 --> 44:08.160
 do whatever the hell you want.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.720
 You have to.

44:09.720 --> 44:14.040
 First of all, I have what you call fuck you money.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.160
 And if you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you.

44:16.160 --> 44:18.160
 What's the point of having the fuck you money?

44:18.160 --> 44:19.560
 You're wasting it.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.040
 Like you're wasting the position.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.760
 Like someone said to me like,

44:22.760 --> 44:24.560
 why do you like sports cars so much?

44:24.560 --> 44:26.480
 Like how many cars do you have, a bunch of cars?

44:26.480 --> 44:28.680
 Because if I was a kid and I said,

44:28.680 --> 44:31.320
 hey, if I was that crazy rich famous guy,

44:31.320 --> 44:33.920
 like I don't want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars.

44:33.920 --> 44:36.200
 Like, so I would do that.

44:36.200 --> 44:39.000
 Like, cause not everybody gets to do that.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.880
 Like if you're the person that gets to do that,

44:40.880 --> 44:42.600
 you're kind of supposed to do it.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.640
 Like that's if you want to,

44:44.640 --> 44:46.280
 if that really does speak to you.

44:46.280 --> 44:49.480
 And, you know, I've talked to you about this before,

44:49.480 --> 44:53.400
 muscle cars, specifically ones from the 1960s

44:53.400 --> 44:54.520
 and the early seventies.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.600
 They speak to me in some weird way, man.

44:56.600 --> 44:57.840
 I could just stare at them.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.480
 Like I have a 65 Corvette.

44:59.480 --> 45:02.400
 I walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.240
 I just stare at it.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.520
 What's your favorite muscle car?

45:05.520 --> 45:09.400
 Like what's your most bad ass late sixties,

45:09.400 --> 45:10.240
 the perfect car?

45:10.240 --> 45:11.080
 Probably that car.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.520
 Probably that 65 Corvette.

45:12.520 --> 45:15.320
 Yeah, I walk around it when no one's around.

45:15.320 --> 45:16.960
 I think I've driven the 69 Corvette.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.600
 Is there a particular year that just?

45:19.600 --> 45:22.160
 65 is a generation two.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.000
 69 is generation three.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.800
 69 is like the, it's even more curvy.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.520
 They're both awesome, just awesome in different ways.

45:29.520 --> 45:33.200
 But I just love muscle cars for whatever reason.

45:33.200 --> 45:36.120
 But the point is like, I like what I like.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.120
 And if I can do what I want to do,

45:38.120 --> 45:39.320
 I should do what I want to do.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.960
 And it's not hurting anybody.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.840
 And the thing is like, I would do the Duncan podcast

45:43.840 --> 45:45.800
 if no one was listening, right?

45:45.800 --> 45:48.240
 If we were just starting to do a podcast together

45:48.240 --> 45:50.800
 and no one cared and it got like 2000 views,

45:50.800 --> 45:53.320
 which we did for years.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.880
 I would do it with Duncan and we would get high

45:54.880 --> 45:57.600
 and we'd talk crazy shit about aliens and spaceships

45:57.600 --> 46:00.960
 and maybe dude, maybe ideas are living life forms

46:00.960 --> 46:01.960
 and they're inside your head.

46:01.960 --> 46:02.800
 And that's how things get made.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.040
 Man.

46:04.040 --> 46:05.560
 Man.

46:05.560 --> 46:08.040
 I've just kind of morphed me and him together in that

46:08.040 --> 46:11.600
 because the life form idea, life form idea is mine

46:11.600 --> 46:14.080
 that I've really, I really think about a lot.

46:14.080 --> 46:17.040
 I think about on a technical side, by the way.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.920
 When I heard you say that, cause I've been thinking,

46:18.920 --> 46:21.360
 I was like, whoa, that's interesting.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.720
 It might be, they might be alive

46:23.720 --> 46:25.720
 because they, I don't know what the fuck they are,

46:25.720 --> 46:28.640
 but when someone has an idea for, you know,

46:28.640 --> 46:30.520
 whatever an invention, a toaster,

46:30.520 --> 46:32.400
 and then they think about this,

46:32.400 --> 46:35.320
 all it need is like these heating elements and a spring

46:35.320 --> 46:37.800
 and then it pops on the stunts, have a timer.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.240
 And then they build this thing.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.720
 Now all of a sudden it's alive.

46:40.720 --> 46:43.400
 It's like you manifested it in a physical form.

46:43.400 --> 46:47.400
 Toaster is not the best example, but a car, an airplane,

46:47.400 --> 46:49.080
 you're thinking about a thing,

46:49.080 --> 46:51.920
 like an idea comes into your head and you can say,

46:51.920 --> 46:53.360
 oh, well, it's just creativity.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.400
 It's a part of being a person.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.120
 That's how we invented tools

46:56.120 --> 46:58.640
 and how, you know, we became better hunters.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.360
 All those things are true.

47:00.360 --> 47:04.400
 I'm not saying that there's some magic to what I'm saying,

47:04.400 --> 47:07.040
 but there's also a possibility

47:07.040 --> 47:09.640
 that we're simplifying something

47:09.640 --> 47:11.640
 by saying that it's just creativity,

47:11.640 --> 47:15.120
 that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.040
 But why?

47:17.040 --> 47:20.680
 Is it possible that ideas like creativity,

47:20.680 --> 47:23.160
 like we are the only animal other than,

47:23.160 --> 47:25.720
 there's a few species that create things

47:25.720 --> 47:28.400
 like bees make beehives and, but it's very,

47:28.400 --> 47:32.160
 they're very uniform, you know, some animals use tools,

47:32.160 --> 47:33.120
 you know, like, you know,

47:33.120 --> 47:35.720
 champs will use like sticks to get termites

47:35.720 --> 47:36.560
 and things like that.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.520
 But there's something about what we do

47:39.520 --> 47:41.840
 that's, it makes you wonder.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.640
 Cause we look at the, just look at this room that we're in,

47:44.640 --> 47:46.400
 look at all these electronics,

47:46.400 --> 47:50.280
 look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented

47:50.280 --> 47:52.400
 and then built upon others inventions

47:52.400 --> 47:54.080
 and proved and innovated.

47:54.960 --> 47:57.080
 These all came out of ideas.

47:57.080 --> 48:02.080
 Like the idea, it germinates in someone's head,

48:02.240 --> 48:04.160
 it bounces around, they write it down,

48:04.160 --> 48:05.520
 they share it with others,

48:05.520 --> 48:07.440
 the other people who have similar ideas

48:07.440 --> 48:10.040
 or ideas that are complimentary, they work together

48:10.040 --> 48:12.520
 and they change the world.

48:12.520 --> 48:15.120
 And the new thing in that is the idea is not the people.

48:15.120 --> 48:17.000
 It's like, we think we found the ideas,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.560
 but it's more like the ideas found us.

48:19.560 --> 48:20.480
 Find you, yeah.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.720
 They're literally in the air.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.480
 They come to you.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.040
 I always felt like that with bits.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.960
 Like when I come up with a bit,

48:27.960 --> 48:29.800
 that's why I'm always telling people

48:29.800 --> 48:32.680
 about the Steven Pressfield book, The War of Art,

48:32.680 --> 48:35.440
 because he talks about respecting the muse

48:35.440 --> 48:40.080
 and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down

48:40.080 --> 48:42.400
 and you do the work or you sit down like a professional

48:42.400 --> 48:44.080
 and you talk to the muse,

48:44.080 --> 48:45.760
 like come tell me what to do.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.760
 Like if the muse was a real thing,

48:47.760 --> 48:50.960
 as if the muse is like some mystical creature

48:50.960 --> 48:53.640
 that comes and delivers you ideas.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.760
 Even if that's not real, that's how it works.

48:56.760 --> 48:57.880
 It does work like that.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.120
 If you do treat it like it's a muse

49:00.120 --> 49:01.600
 and you treat it with the respect

49:01.600 --> 49:03.720
 and you treat it like a professional,

49:03.720 --> 49:05.080
 the ideas do come to you.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.400
 I never thought about what he's doing

49:06.400 --> 49:08.880
 is just sitting there waiting for the idea

49:08.880 --> 49:11.000
 that's trying to breed to find him.

49:11.000 --> 49:11.840
 Yeah.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.320
 That's a trippy thing.

49:13.320 --> 49:14.800
 If you show up. That's trippy.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.600
 If you show up and put in the time

49:16.600 --> 49:19.080
 and focus your energy on that,

49:19.080 --> 49:23.440
 the ideas, they will arrive, they will arrive.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.480
 And that's the same with writing comedy.

49:25.480 --> 49:26.880
 Like there's been many, many times

49:26.880 --> 49:28.600
 where I'll come home from the comedy store

49:28.600 --> 49:30.440
 and I just sit down and I start writing

49:30.440 --> 49:32.840
 and I just, I got nothing, there's nothing there.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.160
 I'm just writing, it's all bullshit.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.440
 Nothing's good, it's just like, hmm.

49:37.440 --> 49:40.600
 And then all of a sudden, bam, there's the idea.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.480
 And then all of a sudden I can't stop.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.200
 And then, you know, it was a couple hours later

49:45.200 --> 49:46.280
 and I'm like, whoa.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.680
 And then the next night I'm on stage

49:47.680 --> 49:49.720
 and I'm like, how about that?

49:49.720 --> 49:51.280
 Boom, it gets this big laugh.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.760
 I'm like, holy shit.

49:52.760 --> 49:55.440
 And I know that came out of the discipline

49:55.440 --> 49:57.640
 to sit down and call the muse.

49:57.640 --> 50:01.200
 I mean, the cool thing is the ideas have found you

50:01.200 --> 50:03.800
 to like, oh, I'm gonna use this dude.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.520
 Like he seems to have a podcast that's popular.

50:06.520 --> 50:10.200
 I'm gonna breed inside his brain and spread it to others.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.880
 It's the same as.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.960
 Or an inventor, you know, I'm gonna use this guy

50:13.960 --> 50:16.880
 who's like desperately seeking some sort of a product

50:16.880 --> 50:17.720
 to bring to market.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.120
 Some guy who wants to invent things,

50:19.120 --> 50:21.400
 is thinking about inventing things all the time.

50:21.400 --> 50:24.120
 These ideas, they weasel their way into your head.

50:24.120 --> 50:28.920
 And it seems to me also that the frequency

50:28.920 --> 50:32.880
 that your mind operates under has to be correct.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.920
 Because one of the things about creativity seems to be

50:34.920 --> 50:36.880
 if you think about yourself a lot,

50:36.880 --> 50:40.120
 if you're really into yourself or your image

50:40.120 --> 50:44.000
 or you're selfish, those ideas are not,

50:44.000 --> 50:45.520
 they don't find you.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.360
 Yeah, it's funny.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.240
 It stifles the creative.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.600
 Yeah, it stifles the opportunity

50:50.600 --> 50:52.280
 that the idea has to find you.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.960
 Yes, which is one of the reasons why joke thieves,

50:54.960 --> 50:57.520
 people that steal jokes are terrible writers.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.800
 There's never like really good writers

50:58.800 --> 51:00.360
 who are also joke thieves.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.280
 It's just joke thieves.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.960
 And then, you know, when they have to write on their own,

51:04.960 --> 51:08.040
 if they get exposed, they become terrible comedians.

51:08.040 --> 51:11.160
 They're a shadow of what they were

51:11.160 --> 51:12.960
 when they were stealing other people's ideas.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.840
 Because the thing that would make you steal

51:14.840 --> 51:17.880
 a person's idea is that ego part,

51:17.880 --> 51:20.320
 the like the wanting to claim it for yourself,

51:20.320 --> 51:23.040
 the wanting to be the man or the woman.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.760
 You know, I wanna be the person who gets out there

51:24.760 --> 51:27.400
 and says it and everybody's gonna love me for it.

51:27.400 --> 51:30.760
 Like you can't think like that and be creative.

51:30.760 --> 51:34.920
 It requires a humility and it requires a detachment

51:34.920 --> 51:36.760
 from self in order to create.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.320
 Like when I'm writing, I'm blank.

51:39.320 --> 51:40.720
 I'm like, I'm just staring.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.160
 I'm like, I'm just the part of my mind

51:43.160 --> 51:45.880
 that's active is not like me.

51:45.880 --> 51:49.160
 It's like this weird core function part

51:49.160 --> 51:53.680
 where I'm not aware of my personality.

51:53.680 --> 51:56.040
 I'm not aware of any of that.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.120
 I'm just trying to put it together

51:58.120 --> 52:00.240
 in a way that I know works.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.920
 It's just being there, being present.

52:01.920 --> 52:05.160
 Pressfield is just, I'm a big believer just sitting there

52:05.160 --> 52:08.200
 and staring at a blank page, putting in the time.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.200
 Yeah, and sometimes it's not that way.

52:10.200 --> 52:11.480
 Sometimes it's an inspiration.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.480
 Like sometimes I'll be sitting there at dinner

52:13.480 --> 52:15.320
 and I'll be like, I got an idea.

52:15.320 --> 52:16.960
 And my wife's really cool about that.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.160
 I'm like, I have an idea and I blah, blah, blah.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.680
 I have to just run out of the room real quick

52:20.680 --> 52:23.680
 and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back.

52:23.680 --> 52:25.880
 Because those are like little gifts

52:25.880 --> 52:28.440
 that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere.

52:28.440 --> 52:31.880
 And some people rely only on those gifts, you know?

52:31.880 --> 52:33.160
 And I've talked to comics about it.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.320
 They're like, oh, I can't come up with my best ideas

52:35.320 --> 52:36.160
 when I don't write.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.520
 And I'm like, no, I do too.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.200
 I come up with great ideas when I don't write,

52:39.200 --> 52:40.560
 but I also write.

52:40.560 --> 52:41.920
 Like you can do both of those things.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.520
 They're not mutually exclusive.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.920
 You mentioned fuck you money.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.360
 I feel like I have fuck you money now.

52:49.360 --> 52:52.080
 A year ago I was at zero, I have fuck you money now

52:52.080 --> 52:54.560
 because probably my standard is my,

52:54.560 --> 52:57.000
 I don't need much in this world.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.200
 But because also, probably because of you,

53:00.200 --> 53:02.840
 but it's 300 to 400,000 people.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.680
 This isn't every episode I do.

53:04.680 --> 53:07.040
 And that is weird.

53:07.040 --> 53:07.880
 It's definitely.

53:07.880 --> 53:09.320
 That's a successful television show on cable.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.360
 Yeah, it's crazy.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.200
 It's all you.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.520
 Yeah, it's hilarious.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.360
 That's amazing.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.600
 But at this point, that also resulted in

53:16.600 --> 53:19.160
 a few money in a sense that I don't,

53:20.800 --> 53:22.160
 I don't need anything else in this world.

53:22.160 --> 53:26.080
 But so by way of asking, I've looked up,

53:26.080 --> 53:28.560
 you've inspired me for a long time.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.840
 Do you have advice?

53:29.840 --> 53:33.640
 You've done this on the podcast side of life.

53:33.640 --> 53:36.000
 Do you have advice for somebody like,

53:36.000 --> 53:40.400
 for me and somebody like me going on this journey?

53:40.400 --> 53:43.280
 Eric Weinstein is going on this journey.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.440
 Is there advice, both small and big,

53:47.440 --> 53:49.240
 that you have for somebody like me?

53:50.240 --> 53:53.400
 The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you

53:53.400 --> 53:54.960
 and do what you're doing.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.920
 Obviously, it's resonating with people

53:56.920 --> 53:58.440
 if you're getting that big of an audience.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.720
 And I've listened to your podcast.

53:59.720 --> 54:00.760
 You're very good at it.

54:00.760 --> 54:04.160
 So just keep doing it the way you're doing it.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.680
 Don't let anybody else get involved.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.920
 What about, you've connected,

54:08.920 --> 54:11.080
 I think you met Jamie at the Comedy Store.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.480
 I met him at the Ice House.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.320
 At the Ice House?

54:13.320 --> 54:14.160
 Ice House.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.000
 Well, I think I met him at the Comedy Store,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
 but then we talked at the Ice House.

54:17.000 --> 54:17.840
 I mean, what?

54:17.840 --> 54:18.680
 You'd have to ask him.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.560
 Yeah, did you think deeply about,

54:20.560 --> 54:25.200
 because you basically have nobody on your team.

54:25.200 --> 54:27.800
 And so it almost feels like a marriage.

54:27.800 --> 54:32.200
 Were you selective about somebody

54:32.200 --> 54:34.240
 to bring into your little circle?

54:34.240 --> 54:35.920
 Well, Jamie's exceptional.

54:35.920 --> 54:36.760
 He is.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.160
 He's a special.

54:38.160 --> 54:39.000
 I mean, he might've grown.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.640
 I don't remember how he was in the early days.

54:40.640 --> 54:42.160
 Maybe you could say, but he's grown.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.320
 He's definitely better at it,

54:43.320 --> 54:45.400
 but right away, he's exceptional.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.920
 He's got very little ego.

54:47.920 --> 54:48.760
 Yes.

54:48.760 --> 54:50.960
 He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention.

54:50.960 --> 54:55.960
 He's not a guy who overestimates anything.

54:55.960 --> 54:59.560
 Like in terms of like a negative or positive,

54:59.560 --> 55:04.560
 like his interpretation of whether it's good things

55:05.200 --> 55:07.520
 that happen to the show or bad things that happen to the show,

55:07.520 --> 55:10.080
 he just takes it all like flat.

55:10.080 --> 55:11.440
 He's chill.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.600
 He's just cool as fuck.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.280
 And he's so smart.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.400
 And he's so good as an audio engineer

55:16.400 --> 55:19.120
 and as a podcast producer, he's the best.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.560
 But he's basically one of the only people

55:20.560 --> 55:21.400
 on this whole team.

55:21.400 --> 55:24.520
 So how do you find, I mean,

55:24.520 --> 55:26.760
 when you let people in,

55:28.280 --> 55:29.880
 I mean, I'm sure other people wanted to get involved.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.120
 Like, why don't you have a cohost that could,

55:32.120 --> 55:34.440
 you basically kind of, well.

55:34.440 --> 55:36.280
 Well, here's the problem with the cohost.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.960
 Like when you and I are talking,

55:37.960 --> 55:41.320
 when we're talking, I'm tuned in to you

55:41.320 --> 55:44.320
 and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying

55:44.320 --> 55:46.440
 and I'm listening and I'm interpreting it.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.800
 And then I'm calculating whether or not

55:48.800 --> 55:52.600
 I have anything to say, whether to let you keep talking,

55:52.600 --> 55:56.120
 whether I maybe have a question that lets you expand further

55:56.120 --> 55:58.440
 or whether I have a disagreement

55:58.440 --> 56:00.920
 or like there's a dance that's going on.

56:00.920 --> 56:04.080
 Now, when there's another person there chiming in too,

56:04.080 --> 56:05.400
 it fucks the dance up.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.360
 It's like dancing.

56:06.360 --> 56:09.560
 Like if you're doing a dance with someone,

56:09.560 --> 56:11.760
 like if you're slow dancing with someone

56:11.760 --> 56:13.240
 and then a third person's there

56:13.240 --> 56:15.040
 stepping on everybody's feet.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.440
 Sometimes it's fun.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.080
 Sometimes having a third person is fun.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.480
 Comedy podcasts, sometimes it's fun.

56:20.480 --> 56:23.080
 Fight companions, yeah, debate structures.

56:23.080 --> 56:24.440
 But even then it gets difficult

56:24.440 --> 56:25.800
 because people talk over each other.

56:25.800 --> 56:30.480
 And also I find that without headphones,

56:30.480 --> 56:32.960
 it's way easier to talk over each other.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.160
 You make mistakes.

56:34.160 --> 56:36.080
 You don't hear it the same way.

56:36.080 --> 56:38.760
 When you have headphones, I hear what you hear.

56:38.760 --> 56:43.680
 It's all one sound and the audience hears exactly,

56:43.680 --> 56:46.720
 or rather I hear exactly what the audience hears.

56:46.720 --> 56:50.240
 Whether it's over here, my voice is louder than yours

56:50.240 --> 56:51.280
 because you're over there.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.280
 And if I don't have headphones on, it doesn't,

56:53.280 --> 56:54.360
 it's not all together.

56:54.360 --> 56:57.960
 On that point, one of the interesting things about your show

56:57.960 --> 57:01.120
 is you don't almost never have done,

57:01.120 --> 57:03.600
 and you just generally don't do remote,

57:03.600 --> 57:04.880
 sorry, not remote calls,

57:04.880 --> 57:07.480
 but you don't go to another person's location.

57:08.640 --> 57:10.480
 We have only done a few, a small handful.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.880
 And just like with Sapolsky, he should do this.

57:13.880 --> 57:16.200
 But I actually, we went back and forth on email.

57:16.200 --> 57:20.320
 I told him he needs to get his ass back in this studio.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.480
 He's working on a book.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.680
 I was a fan of his a long time ago

57:23.680 --> 57:26.280
 because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis.

57:27.160 --> 57:31.440
 And I've reached out to him a long time ago

57:31.440 --> 57:33.320
 before he was willing to do it.

57:33.320 --> 57:35.720
 But then I caught him in downtown LA.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.680
 He was there for something else.

57:36.680 --> 57:40.520
 And I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time.

57:40.520 --> 57:42.720
 Well, he doesn't get, I think, some of those folks

57:42.720 --> 57:45.520
 don't get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio.

57:45.520 --> 57:48.440
 Like bigger than anything they've ever done

57:48.440 --> 57:49.920
 in terms of their work.

57:49.920 --> 57:51.080
 I'm not talking about reach,

57:51.080 --> 57:54.000
 but in terms of the discovery of new ideas,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
 there's something magical about conversation.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.040
 Like somebody as brilliant as him,

58:00.040 --> 58:03.040
 if he gives himself over to the conversation

58:03.040 --> 58:04.680
 for multiple hours at a time,

58:04.680 --> 58:06.920
 that's another place where you've been an inspiration.

58:06.920 --> 58:10.920
 Where I'm getting more and more confidence

58:10.920 --> 58:13.800
 of telling people, like in Elon Musk,

58:13.800 --> 58:16.440
 that a lot of CEOs are like,

58:16.440 --> 58:19.080
 well, he has 30 minutes on his schedule.

58:19.080 --> 58:22.200
 I'm like, no, three hours.

58:22.200 --> 58:27.200
 And then they're like, so some say no,

58:27.720 --> 58:28.560
 and then they come back.

58:28.560 --> 58:30.280
 There's people that started coming back to like,

58:30.280 --> 58:32.360
 okay, we're starting to get it.

58:32.360 --> 58:33.680
 They start to get it.

58:33.680 --> 58:36.960
 And you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense

58:36.960 --> 58:39.120
 that there's some value in long form.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.400
 They think that nobody wants to listen

58:41.400 --> 58:43.520
 for more than 30 minutes.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.720
 They think like, I have nothing to say.

58:45.720 --> 58:49.360
 But the reality is if you just give yourself over

58:49.360 --> 58:52.280
 to like the three hours, just let it go,

58:52.280 --> 58:54.560
 three hours, four hours, whatever it is,

58:54.560 --> 58:56.120
 there's so much to discover

58:56.120 --> 58:58.520
 about what you didn't even know you think.

58:58.520 --> 58:59.520
 Yeah.

58:59.520 --> 59:02.320
 Yeah, you have to be confident that you could do it.

59:02.320 --> 59:05.320
 And in the beginning, I just did it

59:05.320 --> 59:07.320
 because that's what I wanted to do.

59:07.320 --> 59:08.680
 And no one was listening.

59:08.680 --> 59:12.280
 So I've always been a curious person.

59:12.280 --> 59:16.720
 So I've always been interested in listening

59:16.720 --> 59:18.160
 to how people think about things

59:18.160 --> 59:21.720
 and talking to people about their mindset

59:21.720 --> 59:26.360
 and just expanding on my own ideas, just talking shit.

59:26.360 --> 59:28.400
 And so we would have these podcasts

59:28.400 --> 59:29.400
 and they would go on forever.

59:29.400 --> 59:34.400
 And my friend Ari, I never let this die down.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.000
 Never let him forget this.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.600
 He was always like, you have to edit your podcast.

59:38.600 --> 59:40.160
 I'm telling you right now, you're fucking up.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.440
 I go, why?

59:41.440 --> 59:43.000
 He's like, because people are not gonna listen to it.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.640
 I go, they don't have to.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.480
 Yeah.

59:45.480 --> 59:46.320
 I go, you listen to part of it.

59:46.320 --> 59:47.760
 He goes, just do it.

59:47.760 --> 59:49.400
 Just, I'm telling you, trust me,

59:49.400 --> 59:50.800
 cut it down to like 45 minutes.

59:50.800 --> 59:51.840
 That's all you need.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.280
 And I'm like, no, no, I don't think you're right.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.560
 I go, I like listening to long form things.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.920
 No one has that kind of time.

59:57.920 --> 1:00:01.440
 I go, okay, I'm just gonna keep doing it this way, so.

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:03.440
 And it sticks to your gut.

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.280
 No, he doesn't.

1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:06.520
 His are like two and a half hours long now.

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:07.680
 That's great.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:10.080
 You won, but you wouldn't like say,

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:12.800
 I mentioned to you this before, and this is gonna happen.

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:14.440
 It's actually made a lot of progress towards it.

1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:16.280
 I'm gonna talk to Putin,

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.040
 but you wouldn't travel to Putin if you wanted to talk to you.

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:21.120
 Putin is a dangerous character.

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.640
 He's not.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.480
 He's not.

1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:26.440
 Have you ever seen the thing with Jerry Kraft

1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:27.880
 where they stole his Super Bowl ring?

1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:28.880
 Yeah.

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:29.720
 Yeah.

1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:31.640
 I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:33.000
 Oh, really?

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:33.840
 I think it's a little bit.

1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:35.960
 He just decided he's gonna steal that Super Bowl ring.

1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:36.800
 Kind of.

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:37.640
 I think it was a...

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:38.480
 Kind of.

1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:39.760
 Can I see your ring?

1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:41.320
 He shows him his ring and then he puts it on

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.160
 and says, I can murder somebody with this ring.

1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:44.000
 So he...

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:44.840
 And then he walks off with it.

1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:46.920
 It's possible he did it as a,

1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:50.360
 he's a big believer in displays of power.

1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:51.200
 Yeah.

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:52.720
 So like, it's possible he did that,

1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:57.720
 but I think he sees himself as like a tool

1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:01.000
 with which to demonstrate that Russia still belongs

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.600
 on the stage of the big players.

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:07.800
 And so he, a lot of actions are selected through that lens.

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:11.200
 But in terms of a human being,

1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:16.040
 outside of any of the evils that he may or may not have done,

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:21.040
 he is a really thoughtful, intelligent, fun human being.

1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:26.480
 Like the wit and the depth from the JRE perspective

1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:27.600
 is really interesting.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:30.880
 I'm like his manager now, selling the, he's a judo guy.

1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:33.240
 Trying to get Trump, he's really good at judo.

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:34.960
 I have seen him practice judo.

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.320
 He's a legit black belt.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:40.360
 And not only that, he loves it, not just skill wise,

1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:42.160
 but to talk about it, to reason about it,

1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:44.520
 to think about it, to MMA as well.

1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.600
 So, you know, it'd be a good conversation,

1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:49.160
 but you wouldn't travel to him.

1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:53.800
 Well, that's, hold to your principle.

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:55.040
 So that's the core of the advice.

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:56.280
 Just hold to whatever.

1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:58.840
 I would rather, here's the thing.

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.360
 There's not a person that I have to have on the show.

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:04.200
 Right.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.320
 And I'm happy to talk to anybody.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.000
 I'm just as happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Trump,

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.080
 as I am to, probably more happy to talk to you,

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.480
 as I am to talk to Mike Tyson, as I am to talk to Joey Diaz.

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.120
 I like talking to people.

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:19.120
 I enjoy doing podcasts.

1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.560
 I enjoy talking to a variety of people

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:25.200
 and I schedule them based on, I want to like,

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:27.920
 I try not to get too many right wing people in a row

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:29.520
 or too many progressive people in a row.

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.040
 I don't want to get repetitive.

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:33.280
 I try not to get too many fighters in a row.

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:34.320
 I try to balance it out.

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:35.480
 Not too many comedians.

1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:39.160
 Comedians are the one group where I can have three,

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:40.440
 four in a row, five in a row.

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.160
 Cause that's my tribe.

1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:43.360
 You know, those are my people.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:44.200
 It's easy.

1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:45.800
 We can talk about anything.

1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:46.960
 It's a weird dance.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:50.040
 You know, the conversations that you're doing on a podcast

1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:52.960
 are, they're a strange dance.

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:55.160
 And you want to, you know,

1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:56.920
 you want to not step on your own feet

1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:00.720
 and you want to make sure that you do it in a way,

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.880
 do the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people.

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:07.280
 And it's conversations are learning how to talk to people.

1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:09.040
 It's a weird skill.

1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:10.720
 It's a weird skill that took a long time

1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:11.800
 for me to get good at.

1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.480
 And I didn't know it was a skill until I started doing it.

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:16.800
 And then I just thought you were just talking.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.000
 Like, I know how to talk.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.040
 We'll just talk to people.

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:20.880
 And then along the way I realized like, oh,

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:23.120
 and then when you talk to people that are bad at it,

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:24.960
 you realize that it's a skill.

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:28.840
 Like particularly one of the things about my people,

1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:32.560
 about comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk,

1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:34.000
 but don't want to listen.

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.040
 Right.

1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:39.480
 So they're waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk,

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.440
 but they're not necessarily thinking

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.520
 about what you're saying, you know?

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:45.800
 And they're just waiting for their opportunity

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:47.640
 or they talk over you or they,

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:50.160
 and I try real hard not to do that and sometimes I fail,

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:55.000
 but when I'm at my best, I'm dancing.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.760
 Yeah, ultimately the skill conversation

1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:00.440
 is just really listening, like really,

1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:01.960
 and listening and thinking.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.280
 Listening and thinking and being genuinely curious

1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:10.280
 and really having a take on what they're saying

1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:15.040
 and maybe a followup question or maybe,

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.120
 it's gotta be real, it's gotta be authentic.

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:19.160
 And when it is authentic and it's real,

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:20.640
 it resonates with people.

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:21.840
 Like they're listening and they go,

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:25.360
 oh, like I'm locked in with the way you're thinking.

1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.240
 Like you two guys are in a conversation and I'm locked in.

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:32.840
 When she talks and you listen, I'm listening too.

1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:34.400
 When he says something to her

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:36.560
 or when she says something to him,

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:39.080
 like there's a thing that happens during conversations

1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.360
 where you're there, like you're listening to,

1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:45.600
 and it's with me, when I listen to a good podcast,

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.080
 I feel like I'm in the room.

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:50.000
 I feel like I'm in the room and I'm like the friend

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.600
 that got to sit down and listen.

1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.120
 Like, oh, yeah, that's a great conversation.

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:56.320
 I love conversations.

1:04:56.320 --> 1:04:58.200
 So I love listening to them

1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.680
 and I love putting them together.

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.360
 And the fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big,

1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:07.520
 it's stunning to me, it blows me away.

1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:09.320
 I never anticipated it.

1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:11.920
 Never thought for a second that that stupid thing

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:15.080
 that I used to do in my couch, in my office

1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.520
 was the biggest thing I've ever done in my life by far.

1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:20.320
 Like people used to make fun of it.

1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:22.760
 Like there's a comedy store documentary that's coming out

1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:25.080
 and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend,

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:28.120
 Tom Segura, when he first started doing my podcast,

1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:30.520
 he would be leaving and he would talk to Redband.

1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:32.280
 He's like, what the fuck is he doing?

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:33.440
 Like, why is he doing this?

1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:34.280
 Like who's listening?

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:36.320
 He's like, oh, some people like it.

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:38.960
 And he's like, fucking nonsense, waste of time.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:43.120
 And like in the documentary, it shows like 2000 views,

1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:45.160
 like one of the early Ustream episodes.

1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:46.000
 It's hilarious.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.280
 And they don't just like it,

1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:50.400
 really they form a friendship with you.

1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:53.840
 It's like, even me when people come up to me,

1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:56.720
 like the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:57.560
 It's weird, right?

1:05:57.560 --> 1:05:58.400
 Yeah, it's like.

1:05:58.400 --> 1:05:59.320
 You're a part of their life.

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:02.560
 Yeah, and I don't know, it's also heartbreaking

1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:05.960
 because you realize you'll never really get to know them

1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:09.860
 back like, because they clearly are friends with you.

1:06:09.860 --> 1:06:11.240
 Yes, yeah.

1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:13.880
 And it's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant

1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:16.020
 and interesting and is friends with you,

1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:20.160
 but you don't get a chance to return that love.

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:21.240
 And I mean.

1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:23.680
 My kids, it took them a while to figure out

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:27.040
 what's going on, but people would come up to me

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.640
 and they would say something like,

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:31.920
 hey man, I fucking love you, thanks man.

1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:34.020
 All right, hey brother, nice to meet you.

1:06:34.020 --> 1:06:35.000
 My daughter was like six.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:36.480
 She'd be like, do you know him?

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:37.760
 I'm like, no, I don't know him.

1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:39.520
 She's like, how does he know you?

1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:44.700
 Like, it's a very weird conversation I used to have

1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:47.380
 with young kids when I'd explain,

1:06:47.380 --> 1:06:48.960
 I'd do this thing called the podcast

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.640
 and millions of people listen.

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:52.640
 So now one of my daughters is 12

1:06:53.620 --> 1:06:56.560
 and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy

1:06:56.560 --> 1:06:59.000
 and he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me.

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.520
 And so she's weirded out.

1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.320
 And she says to him, I don't even think you like me.

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:04.880
 I think you're just into my dad, you fucking weirdo.

1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:07.600
 She's going to have that conversation

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:09.440
 in a few stages in her life.

1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:12.040
 Like that hard conversation with a boyfriend.

1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:13.760
 Yeah, probably, yeah.

1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:16.080
 That was the thing about men too.

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:21.080
 This podcast is, my podcast is uniquely masculine.

1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.360
 I'm a man and I'm not, I'm also a man

1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:27.880
 that doesn't have to go through some sort

1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:29.320
 of a corporate filter.

1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:31.880
 I'm not going through executive producers

1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:34.240
 who tell me, don't have this guest on,

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.000
 don't talk about that.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.460
 We looked at focus groups and they don't seem to like

1:07:38.460 --> 1:07:40.960
 when you do this, like there's none of that.

1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:43.280
 And I just do it.

1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:46.920
 So I have a whole podcast where I just talk about cars

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:48.000
 and people are like, I don't want to hear you

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:48.840
 talk about cars.

1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:50.960
 Well, good, congratulations.

1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:51.980
 You found what you like.

1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:54.680
 Here's good news, there's 1500 other ones.

1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:55.800
 Go listen to the other episodes

1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:57.720
 where I don't talk about cars.

1:07:57.720 --> 1:07:59.880
 You don't have to listen.

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:02.960
 And it's not like your brand, you just are who you are

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.080
 and that's what you do.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:08.600
 But it's like, it's authentically what I'm interested in.

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.480
 All the podcasts, whether I'm talking to David Fravor

1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:13.400
 about his experience with UFOs,

1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:17.800
 whether I'm talking to David Sinclair about life extension,

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.320
 whether I'm talking to you about artificial intelligence

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.580
 or what, it's because I want to talk to these people.

1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:25.720
 And that resonates.

1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:28.600
 I like when people are into shit.

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:29.760
 I've talked about this before,

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:32.280
 things that I have no interest in making furniture,

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:34.100
 but I like this PBS show where this guy

1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:35.800
 makes furniture by hand.

1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:36.640
 I love watching it.

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.160
 Because he's so into it.

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:39.960
 He's sanding this and polishing that.

1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:40.920
 I'm not going to do that.

1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:42.720
 I don't give a fuck about furniture.

1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:45.360
 Furniture for me is function, like this desk.

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.920
 Function works, but I love when people are into it.

1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:51.720
 I'm happy that someone can make it and they do a great job,

1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:56.680
 but I'm not interested in the task

1:08:56.680 --> 1:08:59.040
 or even the finished product

1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:01.360
 as much as I'm interested in someone's passion

1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:02.200
 for something.

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:05.260
 The passion that they've put into this, that shines through.

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:06.180
 Last question.

1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:11.720
 I sometimes ask this just for to, what is it?

1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:15.280
 To challenge, to make people roll their eyes,

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:17.400
 to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes.

1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:22.400
 Ask, what is the meaning of life, according to Joe Rogan?

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:24.440
 I do not think there is a meaning.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.880
 I think there's many, many meanings of life.

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:30.040
 I think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable.

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:32.320
 I think it requires many things.

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.020
 It requires, first of all, it requires love.

1:09:35.020 --> 1:09:36.420
 You have to have loved ones.

1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:37.720
 You have to have family.

1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:38.960
 You have to have friends.

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:40.720
 You have to have people that care about you

1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:42.260
 and you have to care about them.

1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:44.600
 I think that is primary.

1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:47.800
 Then it also requires interests.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:50.040
 There has to be things that stimulate you.

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.720
 Now, it could be just a subsistence lifestyle.

1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:56.240
 There's many people that believe and practice

1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:59.240
 this lifestyle of just living off the land

1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:01.320
 and hunting and fishing and living in the woods

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:03.400
 and they seem incredibly happy.

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:05.680
 And there's something to be said for that.

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:07.240
 That is an interest, right?

1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:10.160
 There's something and there's a direct connection

1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:12.720
 between their actions and their sustenance.

1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.400
 They get their food that way.

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:15.600
 They're connected to nature

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:18.080
 and it's very satisfying for them.

1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:21.800
 If you don't have that, I think you need something

1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:24.040
 that is interesting to you,

1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:26.480
 something that you're passionate about.

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:28.640
 And there's far too many people that get sucked

1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:33.280
 into living a life where you're just doing a job,

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.100
 you're just showing up and putting in your time

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:37.120
 and then going home, but you don't have a passion

1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:37.960
 for what you're doing.

1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:42.100
 And I think that's the recipe for a boring

1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:43.640
 and very unfulfilling life.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.240
 You mentioned love, if we could just backtrack.

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:49.440
 What, we talked about the demons

1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:51.680
 and the violence in there somewhere.

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:55.520
 What's the role of love in this, in your own life?

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.240
 It's very important, man.

1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:00.920
 And that's one of the reasons why I'm so,

1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:04.140
 I'm so interested in helping people.

1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:07.600
 I'm very interested in people feeling good.

1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:09.360
 I like them to feel good.

1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:10.500
 I want to help them.

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.440
 I like doing things that make them feel like,

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:14.760
 oh, you care about me, like, yeah, I care about you.

1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:15.640
 I really do.

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:17.140
 Like, I want people to feel good.

1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:19.040
 I want my family to feel good.

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:20.280
 I want my friends to feel good.

1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:23.980
 I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience.

1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:28.100
 You know, I am, I'm a big believer in as much as I can

1:11:28.100 --> 1:11:32.320
 to spread positive energy and joy and happiness

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:35.700
 and relay all the good advice that I've ever gotten.

1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:37.660
 All the things that I've learned

1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:38.860
 and if they can benefit people,

1:11:38.860 --> 1:11:41.080
 then I find that those things benefit people

1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:43.080
 that actually improve the quality of their life

1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:46.880
 or improve their success or improve their relationships.

1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:48.480
 I'm very happy to do that.

1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:49.840
 That means a lot to me.

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:53.960
 The way we interact with each other is so important.

1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:55.840
 It's one of the reasons why, like,

1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:58.920
 if someone gets canceled or you get publicly shamed,

1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:01.040
 it's so devastating because there's all these people

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.520
 that are negative, all this negative energy coming your way

1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:05.340
 and you feel it.

1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:07.620
 As much as I like to pretend that you're immune

1:12:07.620 --> 1:12:08.460
 to that kind of stuff

1:12:08.460 --> 1:12:10.960
 and some people do like to pretend that, you feel it.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:14.520
 There's a tangible force when people are upset at you.

1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:17.840
 And that's the same with loved ones or family

1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.080
 or anytime someone's upset at you,

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:22.220
 whether it's a giant group of people

1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:23.920
 or there's a small amount of people.

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.000
 That has an impact on you and your psyche

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.880
 and your physical being.

1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:31.840
 So the more you can spread love

1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:34.160
 and the more love comes back to you,

1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:36.800
 you also create this butterfly effect, right?

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:39.200
 Where other people start recognizing like,

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:42.280
 oh, you know, when he is nice to me, I feel better

1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:43.960
 and then I'm gonna be nicer to people.

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:45.840
 And when I'm nicer to people, they feel better

1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:48.240
 and I feel better and it spreads outward.

1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:50.160
 And that's one thing that I've done through this podcast,

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:54.200
 I think, is I've imparted my personal philosophy

1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:57.280
 in kindness and generosity to other people.

1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:00.200
 Yeah, I mean, to correct you, you didn't do it.

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.440
 The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain

1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:03.280
 have figured out.

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:05.640
 Yes, the ideas that are alive in the air

1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:07.200
 that made their way into my head.

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:09.920
 Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas.

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:10.960
 They figured out.

1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:14.840
 Yes, probably, man.

1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.120
 Probably.

1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:21.000
 So as far as like the meaning of life,

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.800
 that's a bit, without that, you have nothing.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:26.000
 You know, one of the biggest failures in life

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.880
 is to be extremely successful financially,

1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:29.240
 but everybody hates you.

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.980
 Everybody hates you and you're just miserable

1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:33.800
 and alone and angry and depressed and sad.

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:35.840
 You know, when you hear about rich, famous people

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:39.280
 that commit suicide, like, wow, you missed the mark.

1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.560
 You got some parts right,

1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:44.080
 but you put too many eggs in one basket.

1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:46.800
 You put too many eggs in the financial basket

1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:49.800
 or the success basket or the accomplishment basket

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.000
 and not enough in the friendship and love basket.

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.660
 And there's a balance to that.

1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:56.880
 And when I talked about the violence and all that stuff,

1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.360
 like that to me is me understanding, recognizing that

1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.880
 is me trying to achieve that balance.

1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:05.380
 It's to like go kill those demons

1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:07.460
 so that this boat is level, you know,

1:14:07.460 --> 1:14:09.580
 because if it's not, then the boat is like this

1:14:09.580 --> 1:14:10.860
 and then everything's all fucked up.

1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:13.200
 And every time we hit a wave, things fall apart.

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:16.720
 Balance that boat out, figure it out, like know who you are.

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.760
 Some people don't have that problem at all.

1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:20.520
 Some people, they could just go for walks

1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:22.160
 and they're cool as a cucumber.

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:24.840
 I need more, you know, I need kettlebells.

1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:26.280
 I need a heavy bag.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.680
 I need the Echo bike, you know, the Air Assault bike.

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:31.760
 I need some hardcore shit.

1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:33.800
 And if I don't get that, I don't feel good.

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:35.600
 So I figured that out too.

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:37.800
 And that makes me a nicer person.

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:39.400
 That makes my interactions nicer.

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:44.320
 It changes the quality of my friendships

1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:46.360
 and my relationships with people.

1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:49.200
 I think we mentioned Neuralink.

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:53.080
 I can certainly guarantee that this is one of the memories

1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:55.680
 I'll be replaying 20, 30 years from now

1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:57.080
 once we get the feature ready.

1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:58.920
 Joe, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

1:14:58.920 --> 1:14:59.760
 I hope. It's an honor

1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:00.600
 to talk to you too, man.

1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:02.960
 Keep doing podcasts. I'm glad you came down here for this.

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:04.760
 The first week of me doing this here

1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:07.680
 and it's very cool to have you always.

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:10.200
 I hope you make Texas cool again

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:14.920
 and do your podcast another 10, 11, whatever,

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:17.160
 however many years you're still on this earth.
