00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
 we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there in space time by being clever about the

00:04.160 --> 00:09.040
 few things we can see, one of which is our current date. And so now that you have this living

00:09.040 --> 00:14.640
 cosmology, we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty. And then at some point, things

00:14.640 --> 00:20.880
 like us appear very primitive, and then some of those stop being quiet and expand. And then for

00:20.880 --> 00:25.120
 a few billion years, they expand, and then they meet each other. And then for the next hundred

00:25.120 --> 00:30.800
 billion years, they commune with each other. That is, the usual models of cosmology say that in

00:30.800 --> 00:37.520
 roughly 150 billion years, the expansion of the universe will happen so much that all you'll have

00:37.520 --> 00:43.200
 left is some galaxy clusters that are sort of disconnected from each other. But before then,

00:43.200 --> 00:48.160
 they will interact. There will be this community of all the grabby alien civilizations, and each

00:48.160 --> 00:54.480
 one of them will hear about and even meet thousands of others. And we might hope to join

00:54.480 --> 01:01.520
 them someday and become part of that community. The following is a conversation with Robin Hansen,

01:01.520 --> 01:06.640
 an economist at George Mason University, and one of the most fascinating, wild, fearless,

01:06.640 --> 01:11.520
 and fun minds I've ever gotten the chance to accompany for a time in exploring questions

01:11.520 --> 01:19.200
 of human nature, human civilization, and alien life out there in our impossibly big universe.

01:19.200 --> 01:25.200
 He is the coauthor of a book titled The Elephant in the Brain, Hidden Motives in Everyday Life,

01:25.200 --> 01:31.920
 The Age of M, Work, Love, and Life When Robots Rule the Earth, and a fascinating recent paper

01:31.920 --> 01:38.480
 I recommend on quote, Grabby Aliens, titled If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness,

01:39.200 --> 01:45.600
 Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check

01:45.600 --> 01:50.960
 out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Robin Hansen.

01:52.320 --> 01:58.400
 You are working on a book about quote, grabby aliens. This is a technical term, like the Big

01:58.400 --> 02:07.680
 Bang. So what are grabby aliens? Grabby aliens expand fast into the universe and they change

02:07.680 --> 02:16.400
 stuff. That's the key concept. So if they were out there, we would notice. That's the key idea. So

02:16.400 --> 02:22.240
 the question is, where are the grabby aliens? So Fermi's question is, where are the aliens? And we

02:22.240 --> 02:27.520
 could vary that in two terms, right? Where are the quiet, hard to see aliens? And where are the

02:27.520 --> 02:33.840
 big, loud, grabby aliens? So it's actually hard to say where all the quiet ones are, right?

02:33.840 --> 02:38.720
 There could be a lot of them out there because they're not doing much. They're not making a big

02:38.720 --> 02:42.960
 difference in the world. But the grabby aliens, by definition, are the ones you would see.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.720
 We don't know exactly what they do with where they went, but the idea is they're in some sort

02:48.720 --> 02:55.280
 of competitive world where each part of them is trying to grab more stuff and do something with

02:55.280 --> 03:02.240
 it. And almost surely, whatever is the most competitive thing to do with all the stuff they

03:02.240 --> 03:08.480
 grab isn't to leave it alone the way it started, right? So we humans, when we go around the Earth

03:08.480 --> 03:14.080
 and use stuff, we change it. We would turn a forest into a farmland, turn a harbor into a city.

03:14.720 --> 03:20.160
 So the idea is aliens would do something with it. And so we're not exactly sure what it would look

03:20.160 --> 03:25.280
 like, but it would look different. So somewhere in the sky, we would see big spheres of different

03:25.280 --> 03:30.720
 activity where things had been changed because they had been there. Expanding spheres. Right.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.480
 So as you expand, you aggressively interact and change the environment.

03:34.480 --> 03:40.560
 So the word grabby versus loud, you're using them sometimes synonymously, sometimes not.

03:40.560 --> 03:48.000
 Grabby to me is a little bit more aggressive. What does it mean to be loud? What does it mean

03:48.000 --> 03:53.760
 to be grabby? What's the difference? And loud in what way? Is it visual? Is it sound? Is it some

03:53.760 --> 03:59.840
 other physical phenomena like gravitational waves? Are you using this kind of in a broad

03:59.840 --> 04:07.280
 philosophical sense or there's a specific thing that it means to be loud in this universe of ours?

04:07.280 --> 04:14.160
 My coauthors and I put together a paper with a particular mathematical model. And so we use the

04:14.160 --> 04:18.800
 term grabby aliens to describe that more particular model. And the idea is it's a

04:18.800 --> 04:23.920
 more particular model of the general concept of loud. So loud would just be the general idea that

04:23.920 --> 04:27.360
 they would be really obvious. So grabby is the technical term,

04:27.360 --> 04:33.040
 is it in the title of the paper? It's in the body. The title is actually about loud and quiet.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.000
 Right. So the idea is you want to distinguish your particular model of things from the general

04:38.000 --> 04:41.280
 category of things everybody else might talk about. So that's how we distinguish.

04:41.280 --> 04:46.960
 The paper title is If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness, Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.640
 If life on earth, God, this is such a good abstract. If life on earth had to achieve

04:52.640 --> 05:00.240
 N hard steps to reach humanity's level, then the chance of this event rose as time to the nth

05:00.240 --> 05:06.800
 power. So we'll talk about power, we'll talk about linear increase. So what is the technical definition

05:06.800 --> 05:17.520
 of grabby? How do you envision grabbiness? And why are in contrast with humans, why aren't humans

05:17.520 --> 05:22.880
 grabby? So like, where's that line? Is it well definable? What is grabbing what is not grabby?

05:23.680 --> 05:29.920
 We have a mathematical model of the distribution of advanced civilizations, i.e. aliens in space

05:29.920 --> 05:36.400
 and time. That model has three parameters. And we can set each one of those parameters from data.

05:37.200 --> 05:42.080
 And therefore, we claim this is actually what we know about where they are in space time.

05:42.080 --> 05:48.880
 So the key idea is they appear at some point in space time. And then after some short delay,

05:48.880 --> 05:54.480
 they start expanding. And they expand at some speed. And the speed is one of those parameters.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.280
 That's one of the three. And the other two parameters are about how they appear in time.

05:59.280 --> 06:04.320
 That is they appear at random places. And they appear in time according to a power law.

06:04.880 --> 06:09.840
 And that power law has two parameters. And we can fit each of those parameters to data. And so then

06:09.840 --> 06:15.600
 we can say, now we know, we know the distribution of advanced civilizations in space and time. So

06:16.240 --> 06:21.840
 we are right now a new civilization, and we have not yet started to expand. But plausibly,

06:21.840 --> 06:27.200
 we would start to do that within say, 10 million years of the current moment. That's plenty of time.

06:27.200 --> 06:33.120
 And 10 million years is a really short duration in the history of the universe. So we are at the

06:33.120 --> 06:37.920
 moment, a sort of random sample of the kind of times at which an advanced civilization might

06:37.920 --> 06:42.880
 appear. Because we may or may not become grabby. But if we do, we'll do it soon. And so our current

06:42.880 --> 06:47.760
 date is a sample. And that gives us one of the other parameters. The second parameter is the

06:47.760 --> 06:51.920
 constant in front of the power law. And that's arrived from our current date.

06:51.920 --> 06:58.400
 So power law, what is the N in the power law?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.720
 That's the more complicated thing to explain.

07:00.720 --> 07:08.400
 Right. Advanced life appeared by going through a sequence of hard steps. So starting with very

07:08.400 --> 07:12.800
 simple life, and here we are at the end of this process at pretty advanced life. And so we had

07:12.800 --> 07:19.520
 to go through some intermediate steps such as sexual selection, photosynthesis, multicellular

07:19.520 --> 07:26.480
 animals. And the idea is that each of those steps was hard. Evolution just took a long time searching

07:26.480 --> 07:32.800
 in a big space of possibilities to find each of those steps. And the challenge was to achieve

07:32.800 --> 07:40.080
 all of those steps by a deadline of when the planets would no longer host simple life. And so

07:40.080 --> 07:44.800
 Earth has been really lucky compared to all the other billions of planets out there,

07:44.800 --> 07:51.200
 and that we managed to achieve all these steps in the short time of the five billion years that

07:51.200 --> 07:56.560
 Earth can support simple life. So not all steps, but a lot of them, because we don't know how many

07:56.560 --> 08:02.160
 steps there are before you start the expansion. So these are all the steps from the birth of life

08:02.160 --> 08:07.920
 to the initiation of major expansion. Right. So we're pretty sure that it would happen really

08:07.920 --> 08:12.720
 soon so that it couldn't be the same sort of a hard step as the last one. So in terms of taking

08:12.720 --> 08:18.720
 a long time. So when we look at the history of Earth, we look at the durations of the major

08:18.720 --> 08:25.280
 things that have happened. That suggests that there's roughly say six hard steps that happened,

08:25.280 --> 08:31.280
 say between three and 12, and that we have just achieved the last one that would take a long time.

08:32.240 --> 08:32.640
 Which is?

08:34.000 --> 08:38.480
 We don't know. But whatever it is, we've just achieved the last one.

08:38.480 --> 08:42.320
 We're talking about humans or aliens here. So let's talk about some of these steps. So

08:42.960 --> 08:47.920
 Earth is really special in some way. We don't exactly know the level of specialness. We don't

08:47.920 --> 08:53.600
 really know which steps were the hardest or not because we just have a sample of one. But you're

08:53.600 --> 08:58.800
 saying that there's three to 12 steps that we have to go through to get to where we are that are hard

08:58.800 --> 09:07.680
 steps, hard to find by something that took a long time and is unlikely. There's a lot of ways to fail.

09:07.680 --> 09:13.040
 There's a lot more ways to fail than to succeed. The first step would be sort of the very simplest

09:13.040 --> 09:20.400
 form of life of any sort. And then we don't know whether that first sort is the first sort that we

09:20.400 --> 09:24.560
 see in the historical record or not. But then some other steps are, say, the development of

09:24.560 --> 09:30.800
 photosynthesis, the development of sexual reproduction. There's the development of

09:30.800 --> 09:35.120
 eukaryote cells, which are certain kind of complicated cells that seems to have only

09:35.120 --> 09:40.960
 appeared once. And then there's multicellularity, that is multiple cells coming together to large

09:40.960 --> 09:48.240
 organisms like us. And in this statistical model of trying to fit all these steps into a finite

09:48.240 --> 09:53.360
 window, the model actually predicts that these steps could be of varying difficulties. That is,

09:53.360 --> 09:58.400
 they could each take different amounts of time on average. But if you're lucky enough that they all

09:58.400 --> 10:04.960
 appear in a very short time, then the durations between them will be roughly equal. And the time

10:04.960 --> 10:10.080
 remaining leftover in the rest of the window will also be the same length. So we at the moment have

10:10.080 --> 10:15.600
 roughly a billion years left on Earth until simple life like us would no longer be possible.

10:16.400 --> 10:21.120
 Life appeared roughly 400 million years after the very first time when life was possible at the very

10:21.120 --> 10:26.320
 beginning. So those two numbers right there give you the rough estimate of six hard steps.

10:26.880 --> 10:31.760
 Just to build up an intuition here. So we're trying to create a simple mathematical model

10:31.760 --> 10:39.120
 of how life emerges and expands in the universe. And there's a section in this paper, how many

10:39.120 --> 10:45.200
 hard steps? Question mark. Right. The two most plausibly diagnostic Earth durations seem to be

10:45.200 --> 10:50.960
 the one remaining after now before Earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life. So you estimate

10:50.960 --> 10:59.600
 how long Earth lasts, how many hard steps. There's windows for doing different hard steps,

10:59.600 --> 11:09.760
 and you can sort of like cueing theory, mathematically estimate of like the solution

11:09.760 --> 11:15.920
 or the passing of the hard steps or the taking of the hard steps. Sort of like coldly mathematical

11:15.920 --> 11:25.280
 look. If life, pre expansionary life, requires n number of steps, what is the probability of taking

11:25.280 --> 11:30.000
 those steps on an Earth that lasts a billion years or two billion years or five billion years

11:30.000 --> 11:38.400
 or 10 billion years? And you say solving for E using the observed durations of 1.1 and 0.4

11:38.400 --> 11:46.800
 then gives E values of 3.9 and 12.5 range 5.7 to 26 suggesting a middle estimate of at least six.

11:46.800 --> 11:54.000
 That's where you said six hard steps. Right. Just to get to where we are. Right. We started at the

11:54.000 --> 12:00.880
 bottom. Now we're here. That took six steps on average. The key point is on average, these things

12:00.880 --> 12:07.680
 on any one random planet would take trillions or trillions of years, just a really long time.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.640
 And so we're really lucky that they all happened really fast in a short time before our window

12:12.640 --> 12:19.520
 closed. And the chance of that happening in that short window goes as that time period to the power

12:19.520 --> 12:24.560
 of the number of steps. And so that was where the power we talked about before came from. And so

12:25.200 --> 12:30.080
 that means in the history of the universe, we should overall roughly expect advanced life to

12:30.080 --> 12:36.080
 appear as a power law in time. So that very early on, there was very little chance of anything

12:36.080 --> 12:40.480
 appearing. And then later on as things appear, other things are appearing somewhat closer to

12:40.480 --> 12:46.240
 them in time because they're all going as this power law. What is the power law? Can we, for

12:46.240 --> 12:52.240
 people who are not math inclined, can you describe what a power law is? So say the function X is

12:52.240 --> 12:58.800
 linear and X squared is quadratic. So it's the power of two. If we make X to the three, that's

12:59.440 --> 13:05.680
 cubic or the power of three. And so X to the sixth is the power of six. And so we'd say

13:06.800 --> 13:12.320
 life appears in the universe on a planet like Earth in that proportion to the time that it's

13:12.320 --> 13:22.720
 been ready for life to appear. And that over the universe in general, it'll appear at roughly a

13:22.720 --> 13:27.600
 power law like that. What is the X, what is N? Is it the number of hard steps?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.160
 Yes, the number of hard steps. So that's the idea.

13:30.160 --> 13:35.760
 It's like if you're gambling and you're doubling up every time, this is the probability you just

13:35.760 --> 13:45.040
 keep winning. So it gets very unlikely very quickly. And so we're the result of this unlikely

13:45.040 --> 13:50.400
 chain of successes. It's actually a lot like cancer. So the dominant model of cancer in an

13:50.400 --> 13:55.520
 organism like each of us is that we have all these cells and in order to become cancerous,

13:55.520 --> 14:00.640
 a single cell has to go through a number of mutations and these very unlikely mutations.

14:00.640 --> 14:05.280
 And so any one cell is very unlikely to have any, have all these mutations happen by the time

14:05.280 --> 14:10.720
 your lifespan's over. But we have enough cells in our body that the chance of any one cell

14:10.720 --> 14:13.840
 producing cancer by the end of your life is actually pretty high, more like 40%.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.440
 And so the chance of cancer appearing in your lifetime also goes as a power law,

14:19.440 --> 14:24.000
 this power of the number of mutations that's required for any one cell in your body to become

14:24.000 --> 14:24.480
 cancerous.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.800
 The longer you live, the likely you are to have cancer cells.

14:28.800 --> 14:34.160
 And the power is also roughly six. That is the chance of you getting cancer is

14:34.160 --> 14:37.680
 roughly the power of six of the time you've been since you were born.

14:37.680 --> 14:45.840
 It is perhaps not lost on people that you're comparing power laws of the survival or the

14:45.840 --> 14:49.520
 arrival of the human species to cancerous cells.

14:50.160 --> 14:55.040
 The same mathematical model, but of course, we might have a different value assumption

14:55.040 --> 15:00.720
 about the two outcomes. But of course, from the point of view of cancer, it's more similar.

15:00.720 --> 15:07.520
 For the point of view of cancer, it's a win win. We both get to thrive, I suppose.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.200
 It is interesting to take the point of view of all kinds of life forms on earth,

15:13.200 --> 15:16.480
 of viruses, of bacteria. They have a very different view.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.520
 It's like the Instagram channel, Nature is Metal.

15:22.480 --> 15:29.600
 The ethic under which nature operates doesn't often coincide, correlate with human

15:29.600 --> 15:37.520
 morals. It seems cold and machine like in the selection process that it performs.

15:38.560 --> 15:44.960
 I am an analyst, I'm a scholar, an intellectual, and I feel I should carefully distinguish

15:44.960 --> 15:50.800
 predicting what's likely to happen and then evaluating or judging what I think would be

15:50.800 --> 15:56.000
 better to happen. And it's a little dangerous to mix those up too closely because then we can

15:56.000 --> 16:01.920
 then we can have wishful thinking. And so I try typically to just analyze what seems likely to

16:01.920 --> 16:07.360
 happen regardless of whether I like it or that we do anything about it. And then once you see

16:07.360 --> 16:12.240
 a rough picture of what's likely to happen if we do nothing, then we can ask, well, what might we

16:12.240 --> 16:17.200
 prefer? And ask, where could the levers be to move it at least a little toward what we might prefer?

16:19.360 --> 16:24.800
 But often doing that just analysis of what's likely to happen if we do nothing offends many

16:24.800 --> 16:31.920
 people. They find that dehumanizing or cold or metal, as you say, to just say, well, this is

16:31.920 --> 16:39.280
 what's likely to happen and it's not your favorite, sorry, but maybe we can do something, but maybe

16:39.280 --> 16:48.160
 we can't do that much. This is very interesting that the cold analysis, whether it's geopolitics,

16:48.160 --> 16:57.200
 whether it's medicine, whether it's economics, sometimes misses some very specific aspect of

16:59.440 --> 17:07.680
 human condition. Like for example, when you look at a doctor and the act of a doctor helping a

17:07.680 --> 17:14.320
 single patient, if you do the analysis of that doctor's time and cost of the medicine or the

17:14.320 --> 17:20.960
 surgery or the transportation of the patient, this is the Paul Farmer question, you know, is it worth

17:20.960 --> 17:26.320
 spending ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars on this one patient? When you look at all the people

17:26.320 --> 17:31.840
 that are suffering in the world, that money could be spent so much better. And yet there's something

17:31.840 --> 17:39.120
 about human nature that wants to help the person in front of you, and that is actually the right

17:39.120 --> 17:46.800
 thing to do, despite the analysis. And sometimes when you do the analysis, there's something

17:46.800 --> 17:54.880
 about the human mind that allows you to not take that leap, that irrational leap to act in this way,

17:54.880 --> 18:02.240
 that the analysis explains it away. Well it's like, for example, the U.S. government, you know, the

18:02.240 --> 18:09.120
 DOT, Department of Transportation, puts a value of I think like nine million dollars on a human life.

18:09.120 --> 18:13.840
 And the moment you put that number on a human life, you can start thinking, well okay, I can start

18:13.840 --> 18:20.800
 making decisions about this or that, and with a sort of cold economic perspective, and then you

18:20.800 --> 18:28.720
 might lose, you might deviate from a deeper truth of what it means to be human somehow. You have to

18:28.720 --> 18:35.680
 dance, because then if you put too much weight on the anecdotal evidence on these kinds of human

18:35.680 --> 18:42.800
 emotions, then you're going to lose, you could also probably more likely deviate from truth.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.120
 But there's something about that cold analysis. Like I've been listening to a lot of people

18:47.120 --> 18:56.640
 coldly analyze wars. War in Yemen, war in Syria, Israel, Palestine, war in Ukraine, and there's

18:56.640 --> 19:01.840
 something lost when you do a cold analysis of why something happened. When you talk about energy,

19:03.920 --> 19:11.200
 talking about sort of conflict, competition over resources, when you talk about geopolitics,

19:11.200 --> 19:16.640
 sort of models of geopolitics, and why a certain war happened, you lose something about the suffering

19:16.640 --> 19:22.000
 that happens. I don't know. It's an interesting thing, because you're both, you're exceptionally good

19:22.000 --> 19:31.760
 at models in all domains, literally, but also there's a humanity to you. So it's an interesting

19:31.760 --> 19:36.800
 dance. I don't know if you can comment on that dance. Sure. It's definitely true, as you say,

19:37.360 --> 19:43.120
 that for many people, if you are accurate in your judgment of, say, for a medical patient,

19:43.920 --> 19:50.640
 what's the chance that this treatment might help? And what's the cost? And compare those

19:50.640 --> 19:57.280
 to each other, and you might say, this looks like a lot of cost for a small medical gain.

19:58.480 --> 20:06.000
 And at that point, knowing that fact, that might take the air out of your sails. You might

20:06.560 --> 20:12.000
 not be willing to do the thing that maybe you feel is right anyway, which is still to pay for it.

20:13.840 --> 20:18.640
 And then somebody knowing that might want to keep that news from you and not tell you about

20:18.640 --> 20:22.240
 the low chance of success or the high cost in order to save you this

20:22.880 --> 20:28.320
 tension, this awkward moment where you might fail to do what they and you think is right.

20:30.080 --> 20:36.000
 But I think the higher calling, the higher standard to hold you to, which many people

20:36.000 --> 20:41.280
 can be held to, is to say, I will look at things accurately, I will know the truth,

20:41.280 --> 20:47.360
 and then I will also do the right thing with it. I will be at peace with my judgment about what

20:47.360 --> 20:52.800
 the right thing is in terms of the truth. I don't need to be lied to in order to figure out what the

20:52.800 --> 20:57.520
 right thing to do is. And I think if you do think you need to be lied to in order to figure out

20:57.520 --> 21:03.120
 what the right thing to do is, you're at a great disadvantage because then people will be lying

21:03.120 --> 21:10.080
 to, you will be lying to yourself, and you won't be as effective at achieving whatever good you

21:10.080 --> 21:15.440
 were trying to achieve. But getting the data, getting the facts is step one, not the final

21:15.440 --> 21:23.440
 step. So I would say having a good model, getting the good data is step one, and it's a burden.

21:24.720 --> 21:33.520
 Because you can't just use that data to arrive at sort of the easy convenient thing. You have

21:33.520 --> 21:42.720
 to really deeply think about what is the right thing. So the dark aspect of data, of models,

21:42.720 --> 21:50.720
 is you can use it to excuse away actions that aren't ethical. You can use data to basically

21:50.720 --> 21:57.120
 excuse away anything. But not looking at data lets you excuse yourself to pretend and think

21:57.120 --> 22:03.200
 that you're doing good when you're not. Exactly. But it is a burden. It doesn't excuse you from

22:03.920 --> 22:09.360
 still being human and deeply thinking about what is right. That very kind of gray area,

22:09.360 --> 22:16.720
 that very subjective area, that's part of the human condition. But let us return for a time

22:16.720 --> 22:24.480
 to aliens. So you started to define sort of the model, the parameters of grabbiness.

22:26.640 --> 22:32.320
 As we approach grabbiness. So what happens? So again, there was three parameters. There's the

22:32.320 --> 22:38.400
 speed at which they expand, there's the rate at which they appear in time, and that rate has a

22:38.400 --> 22:42.560
 constant and a power. So we've talked about the history of life on Earth suggests that power is

22:42.560 --> 22:48.560
 around 6, but maybe 3 to 12. We can say that constant comes from our current date, sort of

22:48.560 --> 22:54.320
 sets the overall rate. And the speed, which is the last parameter, comes from the fact that when we

22:54.320 --> 22:59.280
 look in the sky, we don't see them. So the model predicts very strongly that if they were expanding

22:59.280 --> 23:05.440
 slowly, say 1% of the speed of light, our sky would be full of vast spheres that were full

23:05.440 --> 23:11.520
 of activity. That is, at a random time when a civilization is first appearing, if it looks out

23:11.520 --> 23:15.920
 into its sky, it would see many other grabby alien civilizations in the sky, and they would be much

23:15.920 --> 23:20.320
 bigger than the full moon. There'd be huge spheres in the sky, and they would be visibly different.

23:20.320 --> 23:26.800
 We don't see them. Can we pause for a second? Okay. There's a bunch of hard steps that Earth had to

23:26.800 --> 23:33.040
 pass to arrive at this place we are currently, which we're starting to launch rockets onto space.

23:33.040 --> 23:39.920
 We're kind of starting to expand a bit, very slowly. Okay. But this is like the birth. If you

23:39.920 --> 23:46.560
 look at the entirety of the history of Earth, we're now at this precipice of like expansion.

23:46.560 --> 23:50.720
 We could, we might not choose to, but if we do, we will do it in the next 10 million years.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.640
 10 million. Wow. Time flies when you're having fun.

23:55.440 --> 23:59.920
 10 million is a short time on the cosmological scale. So that is, it might be only a thousand,

23:59.920 --> 24:03.440
 but the point is if it's, even if it's up to 10 million, that hardly makes any difference to the

24:03.440 --> 24:08.720
 model. So I might as well give you 10 million. This, this makes me feel, I was, I was so stressed

24:08.720 --> 24:13.120
 about planning what I'm going to do today. And now you got plenty of time, plenty of time.

24:13.840 --> 24:21.040
 Uh, just need to be generating some offspring quickly here. Okay. Um, so, and there's this moment

24:23.040 --> 24:29.280
 this 10 million, uh, year gap, uh, or window when we start expanding and you're saying, okay,

24:29.280 --> 24:34.720
 so this is an interesting moment where there's a bunch of other alien civilizations that might at

24:34.720 --> 24:39.520
 some history of the universe arrived at this moment we're here, they passed all the hard steps.

24:39.520 --> 24:45.440
 There's a, there's a model for how likely it is that that happens. And then they start expanding

24:45.440 --> 24:50.640
 and you think of an expansion is almost like a sphere. Right. That's when you say speed,

24:50.640 --> 24:55.440
 we're talking about the speed of the radius growth. Exactly. Like the surface, how fast the

24:55.440 --> 25:01.600
 surface. Okay. And so you're saying that there is some speed for that expansion, average speed,

25:01.600 --> 25:08.000
 and then we can play with that parameter. And if that speed is super slow, then maybe that

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
 explains why we haven't seen anything. If it's super fast, the slow would create the puzzle.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.240
 It's slow predicts, we would see them, but we don't see them as a way to explain that is that

25:18.240 --> 25:23.040
 they're fast. So the idea is if they're moving really fast, then we don't see them until they're

25:23.040 --> 25:28.640
 almost here. Okay, this is counterintuitive. All right, hold on a second. So I think this

25:28.640 --> 25:37.520
 works best when I say a bunch of dumb things. Okay. And then you elucidate the full complexity

25:37.520 --> 25:44.960
 and the beauty of the dumbness. Okay. So there's these spheres out there in the universe that are

25:44.960 --> 25:49.760
 made visible because they're sort of using a lot of energy. So they're generating a lot of light

25:49.760 --> 25:55.680
 stuff. They're changing things. They're changing things. And change would be visible a long way

25:55.680 --> 26:00.640
 off. Yes. They would take apart stars, rearrange them, restructure galaxies. They would do all

26:00.640 --> 26:07.520
 kinds of big, huge stuff. Okay. If they're expanding slowly, we would see a lot of them

26:08.240 --> 26:13.200
 because the universe is old, is old enough to where we would see them. That is we're assuming

26:13.200 --> 26:17.760
 we're just typical, you know, maybe at the 50th percentile of them. So like half of them have

26:17.760 --> 26:26.240
 appeared so far. The other half will still appear later. And the math of our best estimate is that

26:26.240 --> 26:32.320
 they appear roughly once per million galaxies. And we would meet them in roughly a billion years

26:33.040 --> 26:37.840
 if we expanded out to meet them. So we're looking at a grabby aliens model

26:37.840 --> 26:48.160
 3D sim. That's the actual name of the video. By the time we get to 13.8 billion years, the fun

26:48.160 --> 26:56.880
 begins. Okay. So this is, we're watching a three dimensional sphere rotating. I presume that's the

26:56.880 --> 27:04.000
 universe. And then grabby aliens are expanding and filling that universe with all kinds of fun.

27:04.000 --> 27:11.600
 Pretty soon it's all full. It's full. So that's how the grabby aliens come in contact. First of all,

27:11.600 --> 27:18.240
 with other aliens and then with us humans. The following is a simulation of the grabby aliens

27:18.240 --> 27:24.400
 model of alien civilizations. Civilizations are born that expand outwards at constant speed.

27:24.400 --> 27:29.520
 A spherical region of space is shown. By the time we get to 13.8 billion years,

27:29.520 --> 27:36.160
 this sphere will be about 3000 times as wide as the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.320
 Okay. This is fun.

27:38.320 --> 27:38.960
 It's huge.

27:38.960 --> 27:48.800
 Okay. It's huge. All right. So why don't we see, we're one little tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny dot in

27:48.800 --> 27:53.760
 that giant, giant sphere. Why don't we see any of the grabby aliens?

27:53.760 --> 27:58.960
 It depends on how fast they expand. So you could see that if they expanded at the speed of light,

27:58.960 --> 28:03.440
 you wouldn't see them until they were here. So like out there, if somebody is destroying the

28:03.440 --> 28:09.840
 universe with a vacuum decay, there's this, there's this doomsday scenario where somebody

28:09.840 --> 28:14.160
 somewhere could change the vacuum of the universe and that would expand at the speed of light and

28:14.160 --> 28:18.000
 basically destroy everything it hit. But you'd never see that until I got here because it's

28:18.000 --> 28:21.840
 expanding at the speed of light. If you're expanding really slow, then you see it from

28:21.840 --> 28:26.960
 a long way off. So the fact we don't see anything in the sky tells us they're expanding fast,

28:26.960 --> 28:32.720
 say over a third the speed of light. And that's really, really fast. But that's what you have to

28:32.720 --> 28:37.840
 believe if we look out and you don't see anything. Now you might say, well, how, maybe I just don't

28:37.840 --> 28:42.400
 want to believe this whole model. Why should I believe this whole model at all? And our best

28:42.400 --> 28:49.360
 evidence why you should believe this model is our early date. We are right now almost 14 billion

28:49.360 --> 28:55.280
 years into the universe on a planet around a star that's roughly 5 billion years old.

28:56.720 --> 29:04.480
 But the average star out there will last roughly 5 trillion years. That is a thousand times longer.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.520
 And remember that power law, it says that the chance of advanced life appearing on a planet

29:09.520 --> 29:14.720
 goes as the power of sixth of the time. So if a planet lasts a thousand times longer,

29:14.720 --> 29:19.840
 then the chance of it appearing on that planet, if everything would stay empty at least, is a

29:19.840 --> 29:27.520
 thousand to the sixth power or 10 to the 18. So enormous, overwhelming chance that if the universe

29:27.520 --> 29:31.920
 would just stay sit and empty and waiting for advanced life to appear, when it would appear

29:31.920 --> 29:39.360
 would be way at the end of all these planet lifetimes. That is the long planets near the end

29:39.360 --> 29:44.480
 of the lifetime, trillions of years into the future. So, but we're really early compared to that. And

29:44.480 --> 29:49.120
 our explanation is at the moment, as you saw in the video, the universe is filling up in roughly a

29:49.120 --> 29:53.520
 billion years, it'll all be full. And at that point, it's too late for advanced life to show up.

29:53.520 --> 29:58.480
 So you had to show up now before that deadline. Okay. Can we break that apart a little bit? Okay.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.680
 Or linger on some of the things you said. So with the power law, the things we've done on earth,

30:03.680 --> 30:11.280
 the model you have says that it's very unlikely, like we're lucky SOBs. Is that mathematically

30:11.280 --> 30:18.240
 correct to say? We're crazy early. That is when early means like in the history of the universe.

30:18.240 --> 30:25.920
 In the history. Okay. So given this model, how do we make sense of that? If we're super,

30:25.920 --> 30:30.480
 can we just be the lucky ones? Well, 10 to the 18 lucky, you know,

30:30.480 --> 30:37.600
 how lucky do you feel? So, you know, that's a pretty lucky, right? 10 to the 18 is a billion,

30:37.600 --> 30:45.360
 billion. So then if you were just being honest and humble, that that means, what does that mean?

30:45.360 --> 30:49.600
 It means one of the assumptions that calculated this crazy early must be wrong. That's what it

30:49.600 --> 30:56.160
 means. So the key assumption we suggest is that the universe would stay empty. So most life would

30:56.160 --> 31:04.000
 stay empty. So most life would appear like a thousand times longer later than now if everything

31:04.000 --> 31:08.160
 would stay empty, waiting for it to appear. So what is not empty?

31:08.160 --> 31:11.760
 So the grabby aliens are filling the universe right now. Roughly at the moment, they filled

31:11.760 --> 31:16.480
 half of the universe and they've changed it. And when they fill everything, it's too late for stuff

31:16.480 --> 31:24.480
 like us to appear. But wait, hold on a second. Did anyone help us get lucky? If it's so difficult,

31:24.480 --> 31:30.560
 what, how do like, so it's like cancer, right? There's all these cells, each of which randomly

31:30.560 --> 31:35.840
 does or doesn't get cancer. And eventually some cell gets cancer and you know, we were one of

31:35.840 --> 31:44.000
 those, but hold on a second. Okay. But we got it early. We got early compared to the prediction

31:44.000 --> 31:48.560
 with an assumption that's wrong. That's so that's how we do a lot of, you know, theoretical

31:48.560 --> 31:52.640
 analysis. You have a model that makes a prediction that's wrong. Then that helps you reject that

31:52.640 --> 31:57.600
 model. Okay. Let's try to understand exactly where the wrong is. So the assumption is that the

31:57.600 --> 32:04.640
 universe is empty, stays empty, stays empty and waits until this advanced life appears in trillions

32:04.640 --> 32:09.760
 of years. That is if the universe would just stay empty, if there was just, you know, nobody else

32:09.760 --> 32:14.880
 out there, then when you should expect advanced life to appear, if you're the only one in the

32:14.880 --> 32:18.480
 universe, when should you expect to appear? You should expect to appear trillions of years in the

32:18.480 --> 32:25.280
 future. I see. Right, right. So this is a very sort of nuanced mathematical assumption. I don't

32:25.280 --> 32:33.680
 think we can intuit it cleanly with words. But if you assume that you're just wait, the universe

32:33.680 --> 32:41.840
 stays empty and you're waiting for one life civilization to pop up, then it's gonna, it

32:41.840 --> 32:48.640
 should happen very late, much later than now. And if you look at Earth, the way things happen on

32:48.640 --> 32:53.120
 Earth, it happened much, much, much, much, much earlier than it was supposed to according to this

32:53.120 --> 32:58.240
 model. If you take the initial assumption, therefore you can say, well, the initial assumption of the

32:58.240 --> 33:04.880
 universe staying empty is very unlikely. Right. And the other alternative theory is the universe

33:04.880 --> 33:10.560
 is filling up and will fill up soon. And so we are typical for the origin data of things that

33:10.560 --> 33:15.280
 can appear before the deadline. Before the deadline. Okay, it's filling up. So why don't we see anything

33:15.280 --> 33:20.560
 if it's filling up? Because they're expanding really fast. Close to the speed of light. Exactly.

33:20.560 --> 33:28.160
 So we will only see it when it's here. Almost here. Okay. What are the ways in which we might see

33:28.160 --> 33:34.240
 a quickly expanding? This is both exciting and terrifying. It is terrifying. It's like watching

33:34.240 --> 33:41.600
 a truck, like driving at you at 100 miles an hour. And so we would see spheres in the sky,

33:41.600 --> 33:49.440
 at least one sphere in the sky, growing very rapidly. And like very rapidly, right? Yes,

33:49.440 --> 33:54.720
 very rapidly. So we're not, so there's, there's, you know, different def because we were just

33:54.720 --> 34:00.400
 talking about 10 million years. This would be, you might see it 10 million years in advance coming.

34:00.400 --> 34:05.280
 I mean, you still might have a long warning. Again, the universe is 14 billion years old.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.560
 The typical origin times of these things are spread over several billion years. So the chance

34:10.560 --> 34:16.720
 of one originating at a, you know, very close to you in time is very low. So they still might take

34:16.720 --> 34:22.080
 millions of years from the time you see it, from the time it gets here. You'll have a million years

34:22.080 --> 34:27.280
 of your years to be terrified of this mass sphere coming at you. But coming at you very fast. So if

34:27.280 --> 34:31.760
 they're traveling close to the speed of light, but they're coming from a long way away. So remember,

34:32.320 --> 34:38.240
 the rate at which they appear is one per million galaxies, right? So they're roughly a hundred

34:38.240 --> 34:45.360
 galaxies away. I see. So the Delta between the speed of light and their actual travel speed is

34:45.360 --> 34:50.320
 very important, right? So even if they're going at say half the speed of light, we'll have a long

34:50.320 --> 34:55.600
 time then. Yeah. But what if they're traveling exactly at a speed of light? Then we see them,

34:55.600 --> 34:59.520
 like then we wouldn't have much warning, but that's less likely. Well, we can't exclude it.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.760
 And they could also be somehow traveling faster than the speed of light.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.720
 But I think we can't exclude because if they could go faster than the speed of light, then

35:08.720 --> 35:13.200
 they would just already be everywhere. So in a universe where you can travel faster than the

35:13.200 --> 35:17.520
 speed of light, you can go backwards in space time. So any time you appeared anywhere in space

35:17.520 --> 35:22.880
 time, you could just fill up everything. Yeah. And so anybody in the future, whoever appeared,

35:22.880 --> 35:27.600
 they would have been here by now. Can you exclude the possibility that those kinds of aliens aren't

35:27.600 --> 35:33.840
 already here? Well, you have, we should have a different discussion of that. Okay. So let's

35:33.840 --> 35:38.800
 actually lead that. Let's leave that discussion aside just to linger and understand the grabby

35:38.800 --> 35:45.680
 alien expansion, which is beautiful and fascinating. Okay. So there's these giant expanding

35:45.680 --> 35:56.800
 spheres of alien civilizations. Now, when those spheres collide, mathematically,

35:59.920 --> 36:07.120
 it's very likely that we're not the first collision of grabby alien civilizations,

36:07.120 --> 36:12.560
 I suppose is one way to say it. So there's like the first time the spheres touch each other,

36:12.560 --> 36:18.720
 recognize each other. They meet. They recognize each other first before they meet.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.600
 They see each other coming. They see each other coming. And then, so there's a bunch of them.

36:23.600 --> 36:27.520
 There's a combinatorial thing where they start seeing each other coming. And then there's a

36:27.520 --> 36:31.760
 third neighbor. It's like, what the hell? And then there's a fourth one. Okay. So what does that,

36:31.760 --> 36:38.640
 you think, look like? What lessons from human nature, that's the only data we have,

36:38.640 --> 36:44.800
 well, can you draw the story of the history of the universe here is what I would call a living

36:44.800 --> 36:51.120
 cosmology. So what I'm excited about in part by this model is that it lets us tell a story of

36:51.120 --> 36:57.840
 cosmology where there are actors who have agendas. So most ancient peoples, they had cosmologies,

36:57.840 --> 37:01.120
 stories they told about where the universe came from and where it's going and what's happening

37:01.120 --> 37:04.960
 out there. And their stories, they like to have agents and actors, gods or something out there

37:04.960 --> 37:12.160
 doing things. And lately our favorite cosmology is dead, kind of boring. We're the only activity

37:12.160 --> 37:17.920
 we know about or see and everything else just looks dead and empty. But this is now telling us,

37:17.920 --> 37:22.960
 no, that's not quite right. At the moment, the universe is filling up and in a few billion years,

37:22.960 --> 37:29.040
 it'll be all full. And from then on, the history of the universe will be the universe full of aliens.

37:29.040 --> 37:35.360
 LW. Yeah. So that's a really good reminder, a really good way to think about cosmology is we're

37:35.360 --> 37:42.000
 surrounded by a vast darkness and we don't know what's going on in that darkness until the light

37:42.880 --> 37:48.080
 from whatever generate lights arrives here. So we kind of, yeah, we look up at the sky,

37:48.080 --> 37:55.360
 okay, there's stars, oh, they're pretty, but you don't think about the giant expanding spheres of

37:55.360 --> 38:01.200
 aliens because you don't see them. But now our date, looking at the clock, if you're clever,

38:01.200 --> 38:06.080
 the clock tells you. So I like the analogy with the ancient Greeks. So you might think that an

38:06.080 --> 38:11.280
 ancient Greek staring at the universe couldn't possibly tell how far away the sun was or how

38:11.280 --> 38:16.240
 far away the moon is or how big the earth is. All you can see is just big things in the sky,

38:16.240 --> 38:19.600
 you can't tell. But they were clever enough actually to be able to figure out the size of

38:19.600 --> 38:24.880
 the earth and the distance to the moon and the sun and the size of the moon and sun. That is,

38:24.880 --> 38:28.560
 they could figure those things out actually by being clever enough. And so similarly,

38:28.560 --> 38:32.720
 we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there in space time by being clever about the

38:32.720 --> 38:37.600
 few things we can see, one of which is our current date. And so now that you have this living

38:37.600 --> 38:43.200
 cosmology, we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty and then at some point, things

38:43.200 --> 38:49.440
 like us appear very primitive and then some of those stop being quiet and expand. And then for

38:49.440 --> 38:53.680
 a few billion years, they expand and then they meet each other. And then for the next hundred

38:53.680 --> 38:59.360
 billion years, they commune with each other. That is, the usual models of cosmology say that in

38:59.360 --> 39:06.080
 roughly 150 billion years, the expansion of the universe will happen so much that all you'll have

39:06.080 --> 39:11.840
 left is some galaxy clusters that are sort of disconnected from each other. But before then,

39:11.840 --> 39:19.680
 for the next hundred billion years, they will interact. There will be this community of all the

39:19.680 --> 39:23.840
 grabby alien civilizations and each one of them will hear about and even meet thousands of others.

39:24.880 --> 39:30.720
 And we might hope to join them someday and become part of that community. That's an interesting

39:30.720 --> 39:38.000
 thing to aspire to. Yes, interesting is an interesting word. Is the universe of alien

39:38.000 --> 39:47.360
 civilizations defined by war as much or more than war defined human history?

39:47.360 --> 39:56.000
 I would say it's defined by competition and then the question is how much competition implies war.

39:57.120 --> 40:07.520
 So up until recently, competition defined life on Earth. Competition between species and organisms

40:07.520 --> 40:12.800
 and among humans, competitions among individuals and communities and that competition often took

40:12.800 --> 40:20.720
 the form of war in the last 10,000 years. Many people now are hoping or even expecting to sort

40:20.720 --> 40:28.320
 of suppress and end competition in human affairs. They regulate business competition, they prevent

40:28.320 --> 40:34.880
 military competition and that's a future I think a lot of people will like to continue and

40:34.880 --> 40:39.280
 strengthen. People will like to have something close to world government or world governance or

40:39.280 --> 40:44.640
 at least a world community and they will like to suppress war and many forms of business and

40:44.640 --> 40:51.760
 personal competition over the coming centuries. And they may like that so much that they prevent

40:51.760 --> 40:56.720
 interstellar colonization which would become the end of that era. That is interstellar colonization

40:56.720 --> 41:03.280
 would just return severe competition to human or our descendant affairs and many civilizations may

41:03.280 --> 41:08.960
 prefer that and ours may prefer that. But if they choose to allow interstellar colonization,

41:08.960 --> 41:13.680
 they will have chosen to allow competition to return with great force. That is, there's really

41:13.680 --> 41:20.560
 not much of a way to centrally govern a rapidly expanding sphere of civilization. And so I think

41:20.560 --> 41:25.680
 one of the most solid things we can predict about Graviolians is they have accepted competition

41:26.640 --> 41:32.080
 and they have internal competition and therefore they have the potential for competition when they

41:32.080 --> 41:37.440
 meet each other at the borders. But whether that's military competition is more of an open question.

41:37.440 --> 41:41.680
 LW. So military meaning physically destructive, right.

41:46.080 --> 41:55.200
 So there's a lot to say there. So one idea that you kind of proposed is progress might be maximized

41:55.200 --> 42:03.120
 through competition, through some kind of healthy competition, some definition of healthy. So like

42:03.120 --> 42:11.200
 constructive not destructive competition. So like we would likely grab the alien civilizations would

42:11.200 --> 42:16.800
 be likely defined by competition because they can expand faster because competition allows

42:17.520 --> 42:19.600
 innovation and sort of the battle of ideas.

42:19.600 --> 42:26.160
 LW. The way I would take the logic is to say competition just happens if you can't coordinate

42:26.160 --> 42:31.920
 to stop it and you probably can't coordinate to stop it in an expanding interstellar way.

42:31.920 --> 42:37.280
 LW. So competition is a fundamental force in the universe.

42:37.280 --> 42:44.320
 LW. It has been so far and it would be within an expanding Graviolian civilization. But we today

42:44.320 --> 42:50.000
 have the chance, many people think and hope, of greatly controlling and limiting competition

42:50.000 --> 42:57.600
 within our civilization for a while. And that's an interesting choice whether to allow competition

42:57.600 --> 43:02.960
 to sort of regain its full force or whether to suppress and manage it.

43:02.960 --> 43:12.560
 LW. Well one of the open questions that has been raised in the past less than 100 years

43:13.440 --> 43:20.720
 is whether our desire to lessen the destructive nature of competition or the destructive kind

43:20.720 --> 43:32.000
 of competition will be outpaced by the destructive power of our weapons. Sort of if nuclear weapons

43:32.000 --> 43:41.840
 and weapons of that kind become more destructive than our desire for peace then all it takes is

43:41.840 --> 43:45.040
 one asshole at the party to ruin the party.

43:45.040 --> 43:51.040
 LW. It takes one asshole to make a delay, but not that much of a delay on the cosmological

43:51.040 --> 43:58.240
 scales we're talking about. So even a vast nuclear war, if it happened here right now on Earth,

43:59.520 --> 44:04.320
 it would not kill all humans and it certainly wouldn't kill all life.

44:05.200 --> 44:09.360
 And so human civilization would return within 100,000 years.

44:09.360 --> 44:21.680
 LW. So all the history of atrocities and if you look at the Black Plague,

44:23.280 --> 44:26.320
 which is not human caused atrocities or whatever.

44:26.320 --> 44:29.440
 LW. There are a lot of military atrocities in history, absolutely.

44:29.440 --> 44:36.480
 LW. In the 20th century. Those are, those challenge us to think about human nature,

44:36.480 --> 44:44.400
 but the cosmic scale of time and space, they do not stop the human spirit, essentially.

44:44.400 --> 44:48.960
 The humanity goes on through all the atrocities, it goes on.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.240
 LW. Most likely.

44:50.240 --> 44:57.280
 LW. So even a nuclear war isn't enough to destroy us or to stop our potential from expanding,

44:57.280 --> 45:03.920
 but we could institute a regime of global governance that limited competition,

45:03.920 --> 45:08.880
 including military and business competition of sorts, and that could prevent our expansion.

45:08.880 --> 45:19.680
 LW. Of course, to play devil's advocate, global governance is centralized power,

45:20.880 --> 45:27.760
 power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. One of the aspects of competition

45:27.760 --> 45:36.800
 that's been very productive is not letting any one person, any one country, any one center of power

45:36.800 --> 45:43.200
 become absolutely powerful, because that's another lesson, is it seems to corrupt.

45:43.200 --> 45:47.440
 There's something about ego in the human mind that seems to be corrupted by power,

45:47.440 --> 45:55.440
 so when you say global governance, that terrifies me more than the possibility of war,

45:55.440 --> 45:57.920
 because it's...

45:57.920 --> 46:01.280
 LW. I think people will be less terrified than you are right now,

46:01.280 --> 46:05.440
 and let me try to paint the picture from their point of view. This isn't my point of view,

46:05.440 --> 46:07.920
 but I think it's going to be a widely shared point of view.

46:07.920 --> 46:10.160
 LW. Yes. This is two devil's advocates arguing.

46:10.160 --> 46:10.800
 LW. Two devils.

46:10.800 --> 46:18.560
 LW. Okay. So for the last half century and into the continuing future, we actually have had

46:18.560 --> 46:26.720
 a strong elite global community that shares a lot of values and beliefs and has created a lot

46:26.720 --> 46:33.680
 of convergence in global policy. So if you look at electromagnetic spectrum or medical experiments

46:33.680 --> 46:40.400
 or pandemic policy or nuclear power energy or regulating airplanes or just in a wide range

46:40.400 --> 46:46.880
 of area, in fact, the world has very similar regulations and rules everywhere, and it's not

46:46.880 --> 46:51.680
 a coincidence because they are part of a world community where people get together at places

46:51.680 --> 46:58.720
 like Davos, et cetera, where world elites want to be respected by other world elites, and they

46:59.280 --> 47:05.520
 have a convergence of opinion, and that produces something like global governance,

47:05.520 --> 47:11.120
 but without a global center. This is what human mobs or communities have done for a long time,

47:11.120 --> 47:16.080
 that is, humans can coordinate together on shared behavior without a center by having

47:16.080 --> 47:22.160
 gossip and reputation within a community of elites. And that is what we have been doing and

47:22.160 --> 47:27.680
 are likely to do a lot more of. So for example, one of the things that's happening, say, with the

47:27.680 --> 47:33.360
 war in Ukraine is that this world community of elites has decided that they disapprove of the

47:33.360 --> 47:38.480
 Russian invasion and they are coordinating to pull resources together from all around the world in

47:38.480 --> 47:45.520
 order to oppose it, and they are proud of that, sharing that opinion in there, and they feel that

47:45.520 --> 47:53.440
 they are morally justified in their stance there. And that's the kind of event that actually brings

47:53.440 --> 47:59.360
 world elite communities together, where they come together and they push a particular policy and

47:59.360 --> 48:04.160
 position that they share and that they achieve successes. And the same sort of passion animates

48:04.160 --> 48:09.600
 global elites with respect to, say, global warming or global poverty and other sorts of things. And

48:09.600 --> 48:16.320
 they are, in fact, making progress on those sorts of things through shared global community of

48:16.320 --> 48:23.120
 elites. And in some sense, they are slowly walking toward global governance, slowly strengthening

48:23.120 --> 48:28.560
 various world institutions of governance, but cautiously, carefully watching out for the

48:28.560 --> 48:34.240
 possibility of a single power that might corrupt it. I think a lot of people over the coming

48:34.240 --> 48:41.440
 centuries will look at that history and like it. It's an interesting thought. And thank you for

48:41.440 --> 48:52.080
 playing that devil's advocate there. But I think the elites too easily lose touch of the morals

48:52.640 --> 48:59.600
 that the best of human nature and power corrupts. Sure, but their view is the one that determines

48:59.600 --> 49:06.320
 what happens. Their view may still end up there, even if you or I might criticize it from that

49:06.320 --> 49:14.000
 point of view. So from a perspective of minimizing human suffering, elites can use topics of the war

49:14.000 --> 49:25.520
 in Ukraine and climate change and all of those things to sell an idea to the world. And with

49:25.520 --> 49:33.040
 disregard to the amount of suffering it causes, their actual actions. So like you can tell all

49:33.040 --> 49:39.920
 kinds of narratives. That's the way propaganda works. Hitler really sold the idea that everything

49:39.920 --> 49:45.760
 Germany is doing is either it's the victim is defending itself against the cruelty of the world,

49:45.760 --> 49:52.640
 and it's actually trying to bring out about a better world. So every power center thinks they're

49:52.640 --> 50:01.600
 doing good. And so this is the positive of competition, of having multiple power centers.

50:01.600 --> 50:11.200
 This kind of gathering of elites makes me very, very, very nervous. The dinners, the meetings

50:11.200 --> 50:19.440
 and the closed rooms. I don't know. But remember we talked about separating our cold analysis of

50:19.440 --> 50:24.480
 what's likely or possible from what we prefer. And so this isn't exactly enough time for that.

50:24.480 --> 50:32.320
 We might say, I would recommend we don't go this route of a strong world governance. And because

50:32.320 --> 50:37.600
 I would say it'll preclude this possibility of becoming rabid aliens, of filling the next

50:37.600 --> 50:43.760
 nearest million galaxies for the next billion years with vast amounts of activity and interest

50:43.760 --> 50:50.640
 and value of life out there. That's the thing we would lose by deciding that we wouldn't expand,

50:50.640 --> 50:54.720
 that we would stay here and keep our comfortable shared governance.

50:55.280 --> 51:06.560
 So you wait, you think that global governance is, makes it more likely or less likely that

51:06.560 --> 51:08.080
 we expand out into the universe?

51:08.080 --> 51:08.640
 Less.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.000
 Okay.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.840
 This is the key, this is the key point.

51:11.840 --> 51:15.120
 Right. Right. So screw the elites.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.720
 We want to, wait, do we want to expand?

51:19.360 --> 51:25.280
 So again, I want to separate my neutral analysis from my evaluation and say,

51:25.920 --> 51:30.480
 first of all, I have an analysis that tells us this is a key choice that we will face and that

51:30.480 --> 51:35.760
 it's key choice other aliens have faced out there. And it could be that only one in 10 or one in 100

51:35.760 --> 51:40.720
 civilizations chooses to expand and the rest of them stay quiet. And that's how it goes out there.

51:40.720 --> 51:46.640
 And we face that choice too. And it'll happen sometime in the next 10 million years,

51:46.640 --> 51:50.960
 maybe the next thousand. But the key thing to notice from our point of view is that

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
 even though you might like our global governance, you might like the fact that we've come together,

51:56.000 --> 52:00.080
 we no longer have massive wars and we no longer have destructive competition.

52:01.520 --> 52:06.640
 And that we could continue that, the cost of continuing that would be to prevent

52:06.640 --> 52:11.200
 interstellar colonization. That is once you allow interstellar colonization, then you've lost

52:11.200 --> 52:16.720
 control of those colonies and whatever they change into, they could come back here and compete with

52:16.720 --> 52:23.600
 you back here as a result of having lost control. And I think if people value that global governance

52:23.600 --> 52:29.200
 and global community and regulation and all the things it can do enough, they would then

52:29.200 --> 52:31.600
 want to prevent interstellar colonization.

52:31.600 --> 52:37.680
 I want to have a conversation with those people. I believe that both for humanity,

52:37.680 --> 52:43.520
 for the good of humanity, for what I believe is good in humanity and for expansion, exploration,

52:44.880 --> 52:51.280
 innovation, distributing the centers of power is very beneficial. So this whole meeting of elites

52:51.280 --> 52:59.040
 and I've been very fortunate to meet quite a large number of elites. They make me nervous

52:59.040 --> 53:10.000
 because it's easy to lose touch of reality. I'm nervous about that in myself to make sure that

53:10.000 --> 53:19.280
 you never lose touch as you get sort of older, wiser, you know, how you generally get like

53:19.280 --> 53:24.560
 disrespectful of kids, kids these days. No, the kids are okay. But I think you should hear

53:24.560 --> 53:32.720
 a stronger case for their position. So I'm going to play for the elites. Yes. Well, for the limiting

53:32.720 --> 53:39.920
 of expansion and for the regulation of behavior. Okay. Can I link on that? So you're saying those

53:39.920 --> 53:47.760
 two are connected. So the human civilization and alien civilizations come to a crossroads.

53:47.760 --> 53:54.160
 They have to decide, do we want to expand or not? And connected to that, do we want to give a lot

53:54.160 --> 54:03.200
 of power to a central elite? Or do we want to distribute the power centers, which is naturally

54:03.200 --> 54:10.640
 connected to the expansion? When you expand, you distribute the power. If say over the next thousand

54:10.640 --> 54:15.920
 years, we fill up the solar system, right? We go out from earth and we colonize Mars and we change

54:15.920 --> 54:20.960
 a lot of things. Within a solar system, still everything is within reach. That is, if there's

54:20.960 --> 54:25.200
 a rebellious colony around Neptune, you can throw rocks at it and smash it and then teach them

54:25.200 --> 54:34.400
 discipline. Okay. A central control over the solar system is feasible. But once you let it escape the

54:34.400 --> 54:38.640
 solar system, it's no longer feasible. But if you have a solar system that doesn't have a central

54:38.640 --> 54:44.640
 control, maybe broken into a thousand different political units in the solar system, then any one

54:44.640 --> 54:50.240
 part of that that allows interstellar colonization and it happens. That is interstellar colonization

54:50.240 --> 54:55.760
 happens when only one party chooses to do it and is able to do it. And that's what it is there for.

54:55.760 --> 55:00.800
 So we can just say in a world of competition, if interstellar colonization is possible, it will

55:00.800 --> 55:04.640
 happen and then competition will continue. And that will sort of ensure the continuation of

55:04.640 --> 55:10.480
 competition into the indefinite future. And competition, we don't know, but competition

55:10.480 --> 55:15.840
 can take violent forms and many forms. And the case I was going to make is that I think one of

55:15.840 --> 55:21.280
 the things that most scares people about competition is not just that it creates holocausts and death

55:21.280 --> 55:28.480
 on massive scales, is that it's likely to change who we are and what we value.

55:28.480 --> 55:37.120
 Yes. So this is the other thing with power. As we grow, as human civilization grows,

55:37.120 --> 55:43.200
 becomes multi planetary, multi solar system potentially, how does that change us, do you think?

55:43.200 --> 55:47.440
 I think the more you think about it, the more you realize it can change us a lot.

55:48.080 --> 55:52.800
 So first of all, this is pretty dark, by the way. Well, it's just honest.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.920
 Right. Well, I'm trying to get there. But I think the first thing you should say,

55:55.920 --> 55:59.040
 if you look at history, just human history over the last 10,000 years,

55:59.760 --> 56:04.160
 if you really understood what people were like a long time ago, you'd realize they were really

56:04.160 --> 56:09.520
 quite different. Ancient cultures created people who were really quite different. Most historical

56:09.520 --> 56:14.640
 fiction lies to you about that. It often offers you modern characters in an ancient world.

56:14.640 --> 56:19.040
 But if you actually study history, you will see just how different they were and how differently

56:19.040 --> 56:25.120
 they thought. And they've changed a lot many times, and they've changed a lot across time.

56:25.120 --> 56:29.920
 So I think the most obvious prediction about the future is, even if you only have the mechanisms

56:29.920 --> 56:33.840
 of change we've seen in the past, you should still expect a lot of change in the future.

56:33.840 --> 56:37.920
 But we have a lot bigger mechanisms for change in the future than we had in the past.

56:37.920 --> 56:44.880
 So I have this book called The Age of M, Work, Love, and Life, and Robots Rule the Earth. And

56:44.880 --> 56:49.760
 it's about what happens if brain emulations become possible. So a brain emulation is where you take

56:49.760 --> 56:54.320
 a actual human brain, and you scan it and find spatial and chemical detail to create

56:55.040 --> 57:00.160
 a computer simulation of that brain. And then those computer simulations of brains

57:00.160 --> 57:04.560
 are basically citizens in a new world. They work, and they vote, and they fall in love,

57:04.560 --> 57:08.800
 and they get mad, and they lie to each other. And this is a whole new world. And my book is

57:08.800 --> 57:14.640
 about analyzing how that world is different than our world, basically using competition as my key

57:14.640 --> 57:19.920
 lever of analysis. That is, if that world remains competitive, then I can figure out how they change

57:19.920 --> 57:26.640
 in that world, what they do differently than we do. And it's very different. And it's different in

57:26.640 --> 57:32.080
 ways that are shocking sometimes to many people and ways some people don't like. I think it's an

57:32.080 --> 57:37.040
 okay world, but I have to admit, it's quite different. And that's just one technology.

57:37.920 --> 57:45.200
 If we add dozens more technologies, changes into the future, we should just expect it's possible

57:45.200 --> 57:49.760
 to become very different than who we are. I mean, in the space of all possible minds,

57:49.760 --> 57:54.960
 our minds are a particular architecture, a particular structure, a particular set of habits,

57:54.960 --> 58:00.400
 and they are only one piece in a vast base of possibilities. The space of possible minds is

58:00.400 --> 58:07.840
 really huge. So yeah, let's linger on the space of possible minds for a moment, just to sort of

58:07.840 --> 58:19.040
 humble ourselves. How peculiar our peculiarities are, like the fact that we like a particular kind

58:19.040 --> 58:27.440
 of sex, and the fact that we eat food through one hole and poop through another hole. And that seems

58:27.440 --> 58:35.840
 to be a fundamental aspect of life, is very important to us. And that life is finite in a

58:35.840 --> 58:41.520
 certain kind of way, we have a meat vehicle. So death is very important to us. I wonder which

58:41.520 --> 58:47.440
 aspects are fundamental, or would be common throughout human history and also throughout,

58:47.440 --> 58:53.600
 sorry, throughout history of life on Earth, and throughout other kinds of lives. Like what is

58:53.600 --> 58:57.680
 really useful? You mentioned competition seems to be a one fundamental thing.

58:57.680 --> 59:03.600
 I've tried to do analysis of where our distant descendants might go in terms of what are robust

59:03.600 --> 59:08.240
 features we could predict about our descendants. So again, I have this analysis of sort of the

59:08.240 --> 59:13.680
 next generation, so the next era after ours. If you think of human history as having three eras

59:13.680 --> 59:18.800
 so far, right? There was the forager era, the farmer era, and the industry era. Then my attempt

59:18.800 --> 59:22.640
 in age of M is to analyze the next era after that. And it's very different, but of course,

59:22.640 --> 59:28.080
 there could be more and more errors after that. So analyzing a particular scenario and thinking

59:28.080 --> 59:32.800
 it through is one way to try to see how different the future could be, but that doesn't give you

59:32.800 --> 59:38.400
 some sort of sense of what's typical. But I have tried to analyze what's typical.

59:38.960 --> 59:45.440
 And so I have two predictions I think I can make pretty solidly. One thing is that we know at the

59:45.440 --> 59:52.240
 moment that humans discount the future rapidly. So we discount the future in terms of caring

59:52.240 --> 59:56.960
 about consequences, roughly a factor of two per generation. And there's a solid evolutionary

59:56.960 --> 1:00:01.920
 analysis why sexual creatures would do that. Because basically your descendants only share

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:06.640
 half of your genes and your descendants are a generation away. So we only care about our

1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:14.320
 grandchildren. Basically that's a factor of four later because it's later. So this actually

1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:19.360
 explains typical interest rates in the economy. That is interest rates are greatly influenced by

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:24.000
 our discount rates. And we basically discount the future by a factor of two per generation.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:32.400
 But that's a side effect of the way our preferences evolved as sexually selected

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:37.920
 creatures. We should expect that in the longer run creatures will evolve who don't discount the

1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:43.360
 future. They will care about the long run and they will therefore not neglect the long run.

1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:48.880
 So for example, for things like global warming or things like that, at the moment, many commenters

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:52.640
 are sad that basically ordinary people don't seem to care much, market prices don't seem to care

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:57.200
 much and more ordinary people, it doesn't really impact them much because humans don't care much

1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:04.240
 about the longterm future. And futurists find it hard to motivate people and to engage people about

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.640
 the longterm future because they just don't care that much. But that's a side effect of this

1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:14.640
 particular way that our preferences evolved about the future. And so in the future, they will neglect

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:19.680
 the future less. And that's an interesting thing that we can predict robustly. Eventually,

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:23.760
 you know, maybe a few centuries, maybe longer, eventually our descendants will

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:28.160
 care about the future. Can you speak to the intuition behind that? Is it

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:35.520
 useful to think more about the future? Right. If evolution rewards creatures for having many

1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:40.720
 descendants, then if you have decisions that influence how many descendants you have,

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:44.400
 then that would be good if you made those decisions. But in order to do that, you'll have to

1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:49.840
 care about them. You have to care about that future. So to push back, that's if you're trying

1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.320
 to maximize the number of descendants. But the nice thing about not caring too much about the

1:01:54.320 --> 1:02:01.200
 longterm future is you're more likely to take big risks or you're less risk averse. And it's possible

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:11.760
 that both evolution and just life in the universe rewards the risk takers. Well, we actually have

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:19.200
 analysis of the ideal risk preferences too. So there's a literature on ideal preferences that

1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:24.400
 evolution should promote. And for example, there's literature on competing investment funds and what

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:29.680
 the managers of those funds should care about in terms of risk, various kinds of risks, and in terms

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:37.840
 of discounting. And so managers of investment funds should basically have logarithmic risk, i.e. in

1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:45.680
 shared risk, in correlated risk, but be very risk neutral with respect to uncorrelated risk. So

1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:54.000
 that's a feature that's predicted to happen about individual personal choices in biology and also

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.200
 for investment funds. So that's other things. That's also something we can say about the long

1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:03.440
 run. What's correlated and uncorrelated risk? If there's something that would affect all of your

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:10.320
 descendants, then if you take that risk, you might have more descendants, but you might have zero.

1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:16.080
 And that's just really bad to have zero descendants. But an uncorrelated risk would be a

1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:20.880
 risk that some of your descendants would suffer, but others wouldn't. And then you have a portfolio

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:26.000
 of descendants. And so that portfolio ensures you against problems with any one of them.

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.680
 I like the idea of portfolio descendants. And we'll talk about portfolios with your idea of

1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:37.840
 you briefly mentioned, we'll return there with M, EM, the age of EM, work, love, and life when

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:43.120
 robots rule the earth. EM, by the way, is emulated minds. So this one of the...

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:45.520
 M is short for emulations.

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:51.600
 M is short for emulations. And it's kind of an idea of how we might create artificial minds,

1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:56.880
 artificial copies of minds, or human like intelligences.

1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:00.640
 I have another dramatic prediction I can make about long term preferences.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:01.440
 Yes.

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:07.280
 Which is, at the moment, we reproduce as the result of a hodgepodge of preferences that

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:12.240
 aren't very well integrated, but sort of in our ancestral environment induced us to reproduce.

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:17.920
 So we have preferences over being sleepy and hungry and thirsty and wanting to have sex and

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:23.600
 wanting to be excitement, et cetera, right? And so in our ancestral environment, the packages

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:30.160
 of preferences that we evolved to have did induce us to have more descendants. That's why we're here.

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:36.560
 But those packages of preferences are not a robust way to promote having more descendants.

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:40.480
 They were tied to our ancestral environment, which is no longer true. So that's one of the

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:45.360
 reasons we are now having a big fertility decline because in our current environment,

1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:48.720
 our ancestral preferences are not inducing us to have a lot of kids,

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.960
 which is, from evolution's point of view, a big mistake.

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:56.880
 We can predict that in the longer run, there will arise creatures who

1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:00.000
 just abstractly know that what they want is more descendants.

1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:05.840
 That's a very robust way to have more descendants is to have that as your direct preference.

1:05:05.840 --> 1:05:11.360
 First of all, your thinking is so clear. I love it. So mathematical. And thank you

1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:19.360
 for thinking so clear with me and bearing with my interruptions and going on the tangents when we go

1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:27.280
 there. So you're just clearly saying that successful long term civilizations will prefer to have

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:30.080
 descendants, more descendants.

1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:35.360
 Not just prefer, consciously and abstractly prefer. That is, it won't be the indirect

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:39.920
 consequence of other preference. It will just be the thing they know they want.

1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:44.000
 There'll be a president in the future that says, we must have more sex.

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:47.600
 We must have more descendants and do whatever it takes to do that.

1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:52.640
 Whatever. We must go to the moon and do the other things. Not because they're easy,

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:56.000
 but because they're hard. But instead of the moon, let's have lots of sex. Okay.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.240
 But there's a lot of ways to have descendants, right?

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:03.040
 Right. So that's the whole point. When the world gets more complicated and there are many possible

1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:07.520
 strategies, it's having that as your abstract preference that will force you to think through

1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:09.920
 those possibilities and pick the one that's most effective.

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:15.360
 So just to clarify, descendants doesn't necessarily mean the narrow definition of

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:18.480
 descendants, meaning humans having sex and then having babies.

1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:18.880
 Exactly.

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:27.120
 You can have artificial intelligence systems in whom you instill some capability of cognition

1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:32.720
 and perhaps even consciousness. You can also create through genetics and biology clones of yourself

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:41.600
 or slightly modified clones, thousands of them. So all kinds of descendants. It could be descendants

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:47.360
 in the space of ideas too, for somehow we no longer exist in this meat vehicle. It's now just

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:53.600
 like whatever the definition of a life form is, you have descendants of those life forms.

1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:58.800
 Yes. And they will be thoughtful about that. They will have thought about what counts as a

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:02.240
 descendant and that'll be important to them to have the right concept.

1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:05.920
 So the they there is very interesting, who the they are.

1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:10.160
 But the key thing is we're making predictions that I think are somewhat robust about what

1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:14.000
 our distant descendants will be like. Another thing I think you would automatically accept is

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.840
 they will almost entirely be artificial. And I think that would be the obvious prediction

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:22.800
 about any aliens we would meet. That is they would long since have given up reproducing

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:23.520
 biologically.

1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:28.400
 Well, it's like organic or something. It's all real.

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:33.040
 It might be squishy and made out of hydrocarbons, but it would be artificial in the sense of made

1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:37.840
 in factories with designs on CAD things, right? Factories with scale economy. So the factories

1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:42.000
 we have made on earth today have much larger scale economies than the factories in ourselves.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:46.320
 So the factories in ourselves are, there are marvels, but they don't achieve very many scale

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:47.920
 economies. They're tiny little factories.

1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:49.040
 But they're all factories.

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:49.440
 Yes.

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:54.800
 Factories on top of factories. So everything, the factories that are designed is different

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:56.480
 than sort of the factories that have evolved.

1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:02.480
 Yeah. I think the nature of the word design is very interesting to uncover there. But

1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:09.440
 let me, in terms of aliens, let me go, let me analyze your Twitter like it's Shakespeare.

1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:10.240
 Okay.

1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:16.880
 There's a tweet says, define hello, in quotes, alien civilizations as one that might the

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:24.000
 next million years identify humans as intelligent and civilized, travel to earth and say hello

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.360
 by making their presence and advanced abilities known to us. The next 15 polls, this is a

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:35.680
 Twitter thread, the next 15 polls ask about such hello aliens. And what these polls ask

1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:42.960
 is your Twitter followers, what they think those aliens will be like certain particular

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:49.520
 qualities. So poll number one is what percent of hello aliens evolved from biological species

1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:58.000
 with two main genders? And you know, the popular vote is above 80%. So most of them have two

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.880
 genders. What do you think about that? I'll ask you about some of these because they're

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:02.480
 so interesting. It's such an interesting question.

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:03.520
 It is a fun set of questions.

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:08.400
 Yes, it's a fun set of questions. So the genders as we look through evolutionary history, what's

1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:12.880
 the usefulness of that as opposed to having just one or like millions?

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:18.240
 So there's a question in evolution of life on earth, there are very few species that

1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:22.800
 have more than two genders. There are some, but they aren't very many. But there's an

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:27.440
 enormous number of species that do have two genders, much more than one. And so there's

1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:34.080
 a literature on why did multiple genders evolve, and that's sort of what's the point of having

1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:39.200
 males and females versus hermaphrodites. So most plants are hermaphrodites, that is they

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:47.520
 would mate male female, but each plant can be either role. And then most animals have

1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.880
 chosen to split into males and females. And then they're differentiating the two genders.

1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:56.320
 And there's an interesting set of questions about why that happens.

1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:03.760
 Because you can do selection, you basically have like one gender competes for the affection

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:08.240
 of other and there's sexual partnership that creates the offspring. So there's sexual

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:14.000
 selection. It's nice to have like to a party, it's nice to have dance partners. And then

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.880
 then each one get to choose based on certain characteristics. And that's an efficient

1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:23.280
 mechanism for adapting to the environment, being successfully adapted to the environment.

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:29.760
 It does look like there's an advantage. If you have males, then the males can take higher

1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:34.240
 variants. And so there can be stronger selection among the males in terms of weeding out genetic

1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:38.240
 mutations because the males have a higher variance in their mating success.

1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:44.720
 Yes. Sure. Okay. Question number two, what percent of hello aliens evolved from land

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:53.040
 animals as opposed to plants or ocean slash air organisms? By the way, I did recently

1:10:53.680 --> 1:11:03.600
 see that there's only 10% of species on earth are in the ocean. So there's a lot more variety

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:10.480
 on land. There is. It's interesting. So why is that? I can't even intuit exactly why that would

1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:16.160
 be. Maybe survival on land is harder and so you get a lot more. The story that I understand is

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:23.200
 it's about small niches. So speciation can be promoted by having multiple different species.

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.520
 So in the ocean, species are larger. That is there are more creatures in each species because the

1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:33.040
 ocean environments don't vary as much. So if you're good in one place, you're good in many

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:38.400
 other places. But on land, and especially in rivers, rivers contain an enormous percentage of

1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:46.800
 the kinds of species on land, you see, because they vary so much from place to place. And so

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:51.440
 a species can be good in one place and then other species can't really compete because they came

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:58.640
 from a different place where things are different. So it's a remarkable fact actually that speciation

1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:03.440
 promotes evolution in the long run. That is more evolution has happened on land because there have

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:08.800
 been more species on land because each species has been smaller. And that's actually a warning

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:13.360
 about something called rot that I've thought a lot about, which is one of the problems with

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:19.120
 even a world government, which is large systems of software today just consistently rot and decay

1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:23.440
 with time and have to be replaced. And that plausibly also is a problem for other large

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:29.760
 systems, including biological systems, legal systems, regulatory systems. And it seems like

1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:36.720
 large species actually don't evolve as effectively as small ones do. And that's an important thing

1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:44.640
 to notice about that. And that's different from ordinary sort of evolution in economies on Earth

1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:51.280
 in the last few centuries, say. On Earth, the more technical evolution and economic growth happens in

1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:56.800
 larger integrated cities and nations. But in biology, it's the other way around. More evolution

1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:02.800
 happened in the fragmented species. Yeah, it's such a nuanced discussion because you can also

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:08.640
 push back in terms of nations and at least companies. It's like large companies seems to evolve

1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:17.760
 less effectively. There is something that they have more resources, they don't even have better

1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:23.440
 resilience. And when you look at the scale of decades and centuries, it seems like a lot of

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:29.440
 large companies die. But still large economies do better, like large cities grow better than small

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:34.240
 cities. Large integrated economies like the United States or the European Union do better than small

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:41.040
 fragmented ones. So, yeah, sure. That's a very interesting, long discussion. But so most of the

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:48.240
 people, and obviously votes on Twitter represent the absolute objective truth of things.

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:52.800
 But an interesting question about oceans is that, okay, remember I told you about how most

1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:58.640
 planets would last for trillions of years and be later, right? So people have tried to explain why

1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:02.800
 life appeared on Earth by saying, oh, all those planets are going to be unqualified for life

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:06.320
 because of various problems. That is, they're around smaller stars, which last longer, and

1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:11.920
 smaller stars have some things like more solar flares, maybe more tidal locking. But almost

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:17.680
 all of these problems with longer lived planets aren't problems for ocean worlds. And a large

1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:22.800
 fraction of planets out there are ocean worlds. So if life can appear on an ocean world, then

1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:30.240
 that pretty much ensures that these planets that last a very long time could have advanced life

1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:34.480
 because there's a huge fraction of ocean worlds. So that's actually an open question.

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:41.280
 So when you say, sorry, when you say life appear, you're kind of saying life and intelligent life.

1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:49.360
 So that's an open question. Is land, and that's I suppose the question behind

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:56.240
 the Twitter poll, which is a grabby alien civilization that comes to say hello,

1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:04.000
 what's the chance that they first began their early steps, the difficult steps they took on

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:14.320
 land? What do you think? 80%, most people on Twitter think it's very likely on land.

1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:20.480
 I think people are discounting ocean worlds too much. That is, I think people tend to assume that

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:23.840
 whatever we did must be the only way it's possible. And I think people aren't giving

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:28.720
 enough credit for other possible paths. Dolphins, Waterworld, by the way,

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:32.960
 people criticize that movie. I love that movie. Kevin Costner can do me no wrong.

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:39.600
 Okay, next question. What percent of hello aliens once had a nuclear war with greater

1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:46.240
 than 10 nukes fired in anger? So not in the incompetence and as an accident,

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:54.000
 intentional firing of nukes and less than 20% was the most popular vote.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.360
 And that just seems wrong to me.

1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:02.400
 So like, I wonder what, so most people think once you get nukes, we're not going to fire them.

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:04.880
 They believe in the power.

1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:08.240
 I think they're assuming that if you had a nuclear war, then that would just end

1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:10.720
 civilization for good. I think that's the thinking.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:11.760
 That's the main thing.

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:15.120
 And I think that's just wrong. I think you could rise again after a nuclear war.

1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:18.800
 It might take 10,000 years or 100,000 years, but it could rise again.

1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:20.960
 So what do you think about mutual assured destruction

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:27.840
 as a force to prevent people from firing nuclear weapons? That's a question that I knew

1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:31.920
 to a terrifying degree has been raised now and what's going on.

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:36.800
 Well, I mean, clearly it has had an effect. The question is just how strong an effect for how

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:43.680
 long. I mean, clearly we have not gone wild with nuclear war and clearly the devastation that you

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:47.520
 would get if you initiated a nuclear war is part of the reasons people have been reluctant to start

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:52.240
 a war. The question is just how reliably will that ensure the absence of a war?

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:54.400
 Yeah. The night is still young.

1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:54.800
 Exactly.

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:57.360
 This has been 70 years or whatever it's been.

1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:06.320
 I mean, but what do you think? Do you think we'll see nuclear war in the century?

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:11.680
 I don't know if in the century, but it's the sort of thing that's likely to happen eventually.

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:17.200
 That's a very loose statement. Okay. I understand. Now this is where I pull you out of your

1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:22.480
 mathematical model and ask a human question. Do you think this particular human question...

1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:24.720
 I think we've been lucky that it hasn't happened so far.

1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:32.400
 But what is the nature of nuclear war? Let's think about this. There's dictators, there's democracies,

1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:40.480
 miscommunication. How do wars start? World War I, World War II.

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:46.000
 So the biggest datum here is that we've had an enormous decline in major war over the last

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.960
 century. So that has to be taken into account now. So the problem is war is a process that has a very

1:17:52.960 --> 1:18:00.640
 long tail. That is, there are rare, very large wars. So the average war is much worse than the

1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:08.080
 median war because of this long tail. And that makes it hard to identify trends over time. So

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:12.480
 the median war has clearly gone way down in the last century at a medium rate of war. But it could

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:17.200
 be that's because the tail has gotten thicker. And in fact, the average war is just as bad,

1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:21.440
 but most wars are gonna be big wars. So that's the thing we're not so sure about.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:30.800
 There's no strong data on wars with one, because of the destructive nature of the weapons,

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:34.800
 kill hundreds of millions of people. There's no data on this.

1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:37.360
 So, but we can start intuiting.

1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:41.520
 But we can see that the power law, we can do a power law fit to the rate of wars and it's a

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:46.560
 power law with a thick tail. So it's one of those things that you should expect most of the damage

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:51.200
 to be in the few biggest ones. So that's also true for pandemics and a few other things. For

1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:55.840
 pandemics, most of the damages in the few biggest ones. So the median pandemics of ours, less than

1:18:55.840 --> 1:19:02.880
 the average that you should expect in the future. But those, that fitting of data is very questionable

1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:09.120
 because everything you said is correct. The question is like, what can we infer about the

1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:19.520
 future of civilization, threatening pandemics or nuclear war from studying the history of the

1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:25.120
 20th century? So like, you can't just fit it to the data, the rate of wars and the destructive

1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:31.360
 nature. Like that's not, that's not how nuclear war will happen. Nuclear war happens with two

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:35.120
 assholes or idiots that have access to a button.

1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:36.880
 Small wars happen that way too.

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:41.600
 No, I understand that, but that's, it's very important. Small wars aside, it's very important

1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:46.720
 to understand the dynamics, the human dynamics and the geopolitics of the way nuclear war happens

1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:51.520
 in order to predict how we can minimize the chance of a...

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:56.800
 But it is a common and useful intellectual strategy to take something that could be really

1:19:56.800 --> 1:20:01.120
 big or, but is often very small and fit the distribution of the data, small things, which

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:05.280
 you have a lot of them and then ask, do I believe the big things are really that different? Right?

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:05.760
 I see.

1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:10.400
 So sometimes it's reasonable to say like, say with tornadoes or even pandemics or something,

1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:14.960
 the underlying process might not be that different for the big and small ones.

1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:22.880
 It might not be. The fact that mutual sure destruction seems to work to some degree

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:27.040
 shows you that to some degree it's different than the small wars.

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:40.880
 So it's a really important question to understand is, are humans capable, one human, like how many

1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:46.960
 humans on earth, if I give them a button now, say you pressing this button will kill everyone on

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:53.040
 earth, everyone, right? How many humans will press that button? I want to know those numbers,

1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:59.280
 like day to day, minute to minute, how many people have that much irresponsibility, evil,

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:06.240
 incompetence, ignorance, whatever word you want to assign, there's a lot of dynamics of the

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:12.320
 psychology that leads you to press that button, but how many? My intuition is the number, the more

1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:17.520
 destructive that press of a button, the fewer humans you find. And that number gets very close

1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:23.680
 to zero very quickly, especially people have access to such a button, but that's perhaps

1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:28.240
 a hope than a reality. And unfortunately we don't have good data on this,

1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:34.480
 which is like how destructive are humans willing to be?

1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:39.920
 So I think part of this just has to think about, ask what your time scales you're looking at,

1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:44.880
 right? So if you say, if you look at the history of war, you know, we've had a lot of wars pretty

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:50.000
 consistently over many centuries. So if I ask, if you ask, will we have a nuclear war in the

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:56.400
 next 50 years? I might say, well, probably not. If I say 500 or 5,000 years, like if the same sort

1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:00.960
 of risks are underlying and they just continue, then you have to add that up over time and think

1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:04.400
 the risk is getting a lot larger the longer a timescale we're looking at.

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:09.920
 But okay, let's generalize nuclear war because what I was more referring to is something that

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:25.680
 kills more than 20% of humans on earth and injures or makes the other 80%

1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:32.320
 suffer horribly, survive, but suffer. That's what I was referring to. So when you look at 500 years

1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:36.640
 from now, that might not be nuclear war. That might be something else. That's that kind of,

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:45.280
 has that destructive effect. And I don't know, these feel like novel questions in the history

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:52.400
 of humanity. I just don't know. I think since nuclear weapons, this has been, you know,

1:22:52.400 --> 1:23:02.560
 engineering pandemics, for example, robotics, so nanobots. It just seems like a real new

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:08.160
 possibility that we have to contend with it. We don't have good models or from my perspective.

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:13.280
 So if you look on say the last thousand years or 10,000 years, we could say we've seen a certain

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:19.680
 rate at which people are willing to make big destruction in terms of war. Okay. And if you're

1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:23.920
 willing to project that data forward, that I think like if you want to ask over periods of

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:28.000
 thousands or tens of thousands of years, you would have a reasonable data set. So the key

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.960
 question is what's changed lately? Okay. And so a big question of which I've given a lot of thought

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:39.920
 to what are the major changes that seem to have happened in culture and human attitudes over the

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:44.160
 last few centuries and what's our best explanation for those so that we can project them forward into

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:51.600
 the future. And I have a story about that, which is the story that we have been drifting back toward

1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:57.920
 forager attitudes in the last few centuries as we get rich. So the idea is we spent a million years

1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:03.680
 being a forager and that was a very sort of standard lifestyle that we know a lot about.

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:10.080
 Foragers sort of live in small bands. They make decisions cooperatively. They share food. They,

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:16.800
 you know, they don't have much property, et cetera. And humans liked that. And then 10,000 years ago,

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:21.280
 farming became possible, but it was only possible because we were plastic enough to really change

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:25.840
 our culture. Farming styles and cultures are very different. They have slavery, they have war,

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:30.880
 they have property, they have inequality, they have kings. They stay in one place instead of

1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:35.920
 wandering. They don't have as much diversity of experience or food. They have more disease.

1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:41.600
 This farming life is just very different. But humans were able to sort of introduce conformity

1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:45.280
 and religion and all sorts of things to become just a very different kind of creature as farmers.

1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:48.640
 Farmers are just really different than foragers in terms of their values and their lives.

1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:54.160
 But the pressures that made foragers into farmers were part mediated by poverty.

1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:00.080
 Farmers are poor. And if they deviated from the farming norms that people around them supported,

1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:05.440
 they were quite at risk of starving to death. And then in the last few centuries,

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:11.920
 we've gotten rich. And as we've gotten rich, the social pressures that turned foragers into farmers

1:25:11.920 --> 1:25:18.000
 have become less persuasive to us. So, for example, a farming young woman who was told,

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.640
 if you have a child out of wedlock, you and your child may starve, that was a credible threat.

1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:28.000
 She would see actual examples around her to make that a believable threat. Today,

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.760
 if you say to a young woman, you shouldn't have a child out of wedlock, she will see other young

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:36.320
 woman around her doing okay that way. We're all rich enough to be able to afford that sort of a

1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:42.400
 thing. And therefore, she's more inclined often to go with her inclinations, her sort of more

1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:47.520
 natural inclinations about such things rather than to be pressured to follow the official

1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:51.440
 farming norms of that you shouldn't do that sort of thing. And all through our lives, we have been

1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:57.920
 drifting back toward forager attitudes because we've been getting rich. And so, aside from at

1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:04.000
 work, which is an exception, but elsewhere, I think this explains trends toward less slavery,

1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:10.720
 more democracy, less religion, less fertility, more promiscuity, more travel, more art, more leisure,

1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:18.960
 fewer work hours. All of these trends are basically explained by becoming more forager like.

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:23.360
 And much science fiction celebrates this, Star Trek or the culture novels, people

1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:27.840
 like this image that we are moving toward this world. We're basically like foragers, we're peaceful,

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:33.600
 we share, we make decisions collectively, we have a lot of free time, we are into art.

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:42.240
 So forger, you know, forger is a word and it has, it's a loaded word because it's connected to

1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:49.200
 the actual, what life was actually like at that time. As you mentioned, we sometimes don't do a

1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:55.120
 good job of telling accurately what life was like back then. But you're saying if it's not exactly

1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:01.920
 like foragers, it rhymes in some fundamental way. You also said peaceful. Is it obvious that a

1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:10.080
 forager with a nuclear weapon would be peaceful? I don't know if that's 100% obvious. So we know,

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:14.960
 again, we know a fair bit about what foragers lives were like. The main sort of violence they

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:19.600
 had would be sexual jealousy. They were relatively promiscuous and so there'd be a lot of jealousy.

1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:24.480
 But they did not have organized wars with each other. That is, they were at peace with their

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.880
 neighboring forager bands. They didn't have property in land or even in people. They didn't

1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:34.160
 really have marriage. And so they were, in fact, peaceful.

1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:38.400
 When you think about large scale wars, they don't start large scale wars.

1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.560
 They didn't have coordinated large scale wars like the way chimpanzees do. Our chimpanzees do

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:47.440
 have wars between one tribe of chimpanzees and others, but human foragers do not. Farmers return

1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:52.800
 to that, of course, the more chimpanzee like styles. Well, that's a hopeful message. If we

1:27:52.800 --> 1:28:00.160
 could return real quick to the Hello Aliens Twitter thread. One of them is really interesting

1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:05.280
 about language. What percent of Hello Aliens would be able to talk to us in our language?

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:10.080
 This is the question of communication. It actually gets to the nature of language.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:15.120
 It also gets to the nature of how advanced you expect them to be.

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:22.880
 So I think some people see that we have advanced over the last thousands of years,

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:27.600
 and we aren't reaching any sort of limit. And so they tend to assume it could go on forever.

1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:34.400
 And I actually tend to think that within, say, 10 million years, we will sort of max out on

1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:40.240
 technology. We will sort of learn everything that's feasible to know for the most part. And then

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:45.680
 obstacles to understanding would more be about sort of cultural differences, like ways in which

1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:52.080
 different places had just chosen to do things differently. And so then the question is, is it

1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:59.760
 even possible to communicate across some cultural distances? And I could imagine some maybe advanced

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.680
 aliens who just become so weird and different from each other, they can't communicate with each other.

1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:10.720
 But we're probably pretty simple compared to them. So I would think, sure, if they wanted to,

1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:17.200
 they could communicate with us. So it's the simplicity of the recipient. I tend to,

1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:23.600
 just to push back, let's explore the possibility where that's not the case. Can we communicate

1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:33.280
 with ants? I find that this idea that... We're not very good at communicating in general.

1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:38.400
 Oh, you're saying... All right, I see. You're saying once you get orders of magnitude better

1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:43.440
 at communicating... Once they had maxed out on all communication technology in general,

1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:47.440
 and they just understood in general how to communicate with lots of things, and had done

1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:51.520
 that for millions of years. But you have to be able to... This is so interesting. As somebody

1:29:51.520 --> 1:30:00.240
 who cares a lot about empathy and imagining how other people feel, communication requires empathy,

1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:08.160
 meaning you have to truly understand how the other person, the other organism sees the world.

1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:15.200
 It's like a four dimensional species talking to a two dimensional species. It's not as trivial as,

1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:20.880
 to me at least, as it might at first seem. So let me reverse my position a little,

1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:28.160
 because I'll say, well, the hello aliens question really combines two different scenarios

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:34.560
 that we're slipping over. So one scenario would be that the hello aliens would be like grabby

1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:38.400
 aliens. They would be just fully advanced. They would have been expanding for millions of years.

1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:43.120
 They would have a very advanced civilization, and then they would finally be arriving here

1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:47.760
 after a billion years perhaps of expanding, in which case they're going to be crazy advanced

1:30:47.760 --> 1:30:55.040
 at some maximal level. But the hello aliens about aliens we might meet soon, which might be sort of

1:30:55.040 --> 1:31:02.480
 UFO aliens, and UFO aliens probably are not grabby aliens. How do you get here if you're

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:10.640
 not a grabby alien? Well, they would have to be able to travel. Oh. But they would not be expansive.

1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:17.200
 So the road trip doesn't count as a grabby. So we're talking about expanding the colony,

1:31:17.200 --> 1:31:24.240
 the comfortable colony. So the question is, if UFOs, some of them are aliens,

1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:28.880
 what kind of aliens would they be? This is sort of the key question you have to ask in order to

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:36.160
 try to interpret that scenario. The key fact we would know is that they are here right now,

1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:43.520
 but the universe around us is not full of an alien civilization. So that says right off the bat

1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:50.240
 that they chose not to allow massive expansion of a grabby civilization.

1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:56.400
 Is it possible that they chose it, but we just don't see them yet? These are the stragglers,

1:31:56.400 --> 1:32:02.800
 the journeymen. So the timing coincidence is, it's almost surely if they are here now,

1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:08.400
 they are much older than us. They are many millions of years older than us. And so they

1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:12.000
 could have filled the galaxy in that last millions of years if they had wanted to.

1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:18.240
 That is, they couldn't just be right at the edge. Very unlikely. Most likely they would have been

1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:22.320
 around waiting for us for a long time. They could have come here any time in the last millions of

1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:25.760
 years and they just chosen, they've been waiting around for this or they just chose to come

1:32:25.760 --> 1:32:31.520
 recently. But the timing coincidence, it would be crazy unlikely that they just happen to be able to

1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:36.800
 get here, say in the last hundred years. They would no doubt have been able to get here far

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:41.760
 earlier than that. Again, we don't know. So this is a friend like UFO sightings on earth. We don't

1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:46.480
 know if this kind of increase in sightings have anything to do with actual visitations.

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:50.720
 I'm just talking about the timing. They arose at some point in space time.

1:32:52.080 --> 1:32:56.640
 And it's very unlikely that that was just to the point that they could just barely get here

1:32:56.640 --> 1:33:03.280
 recently. Almost surely they could have gotten here much earlier. And throughout the stretch

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:06.960
 of several billion years that earth existed, they could have been here often. Exactly. So

1:33:07.520 --> 1:33:12.480
 they could have therefore filled the galaxy long time ago if they had wanted to. Let's push back

1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:20.080
 on that. The question to me is, isn't it possible that the expansion of a civilization is much

1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:30.720
 harder than the travel? The sphere of the reachable is different than the sphere of the colonized.

1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:38.560
 So isn't it possible that the sphere of places where like the stragglers go, the different

1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:44.640
 people that journey out, the explorers, is much, much larger and grows much faster than the

1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:51.040
 civilization? So in which case, like they would visit us. There's a lot of visitors, the grad

1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:55.840
 students of the civilization. They're like exploring, they're collecting the data, but

1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:01.280
 we're not yet going to see them. And by yet, I mean across millions of years.

1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:10.400
 The time delay between when the first thing might arrive and then when colonists could arrive in

1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:16.480
 mass and do a mass amount of work is cosmologically short. In human history, of course, sure, there

1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:22.240
 might be a century between that, but a century is just a tiny amount of time on the scales we're

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:28.400
 talking about. So this is, in computer science, ant colony optimization. It's true for ants.

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:32.640
 So it's like when the first ant shows up, it's likely if there's anything of value,

1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.800
 it's likely the other ants will follow quickly. Yeah.

1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:42.800
 Relatively short. It's also true that traveling over very long distances, probably one of the

1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:48.240
 main ways to make that feasible is that you land somewhere, you colonize a bit, you create new

1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:53.200
 resources that can then allow you to go farther. Many short hops as opposed to a giant long journey.

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:59.280
 Exactly. Those hops require that you are able to start a colonization of sorts along those hops.

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:04.640
 You have to be able to stop somewhere, make it into a way station such that you can then support

1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:10.880
 you moving farther. So what do you think of, there's been a lot of UFO sightings. What do

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:19.680
 you think about those UFO sightings and what do you think if any of them are of extraterrestrial

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:26.240
 origin and we don't see giant civilizations out in the sky, how do you make sense of that then?

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:33.040
 I want to do some clearing of throats, which people like to do on this topic, right? They want

1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:39.120
 to make sure you understand they're saying this and not that, right? So I would say the analysis

1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:47.360
 needs both a prior and a likelihood. So the prior is what are the scenarios that are at all plausible

1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:52.240
 in terms of what we know about the universe. And then the likelihood is the particular actual

1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:58.800
 sightings, like how hard are those to explain through various means. I will establish myself

1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:04.160
 as somewhat of an expert on the prior. I would say my studies and the things I've studied make me an

1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:09.200
 expert and I should stand up and have an opinion on that and be able to explain it. The likelihood,

1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:15.840
 however, is not my area of expertise. That is, I'm not a pilot. I don't do atmospheric studies of

1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:20.240
 studies of things I haven't studied in detail, the various kinds of atmospheric phenomena or

1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:24.000
 whatever that might be used to explain the particular sightings. I can just say from

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:30.480
 my amateur stance, the sightings look damn puzzling. They do not look easy to dismiss.

1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:35.280
 The attempts I've seen to easily dismiss them seem to me to fail. It seems like these are

1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:42.160
 pretty puzzling, weird stuff that deserve an expert's attention in terms of considering,

1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:48.400
 asking what the likelihood is. So analogy I would make as a murder trial. On average, if we say,

1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:52.960
 what's the chance any one person murdered another person as a prior probability, maybe one in a

1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:56.480
 thousand people get murdered. Maybe each person has a thousand people around them who could

1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:01.200
 plausibly have done it. So the prior probability of a murder is one in a million. But we allow

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:07.200
 murder trials because often evidence is sufficient to overcome a one in a million prior because the

1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:13.840
 evidence is often strong enough, right? My guess, rough guess for the UFOs as aliens

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:16.560
 scenario, at least some of them, is the priors roughly one in a thousand,

1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:23.920
 much higher than the usual murder trial, plenty high enough that strong physical evidence could

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:28.720
 put you over the top to think it's more likely than not. But I'm not an expert on that physical

1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:33.440
 evidence. I'm going to leave that part to someone else. I'm going to say the prior is pretty high.

1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:38.000
 This isn't a crazy scenario. So then I can elaborate on where my prior comes from.

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:45.680
 What scenario could make most sense of this data? My scenario to make sense has two main parts.

1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:55.040
 First is panspermia siblings. So panspermia is the process by which life might have arrived on

1:37:55.040 --> 1:38:00.960
 earth from elsewhere. And a plausible time for that, I mean, it would have to happen very early

1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:05.200
 in earth's history because we see life early in history. And a plausible time could have been

1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:12.400
 during the stellar nursery where the sun was born with many other stars in the same close proximity

1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:16.640
 with lots of rocks flying around, able to move things from one place to another.

1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:24.480
 If a rock with life on it from some rock with planet with life came into that stellar nursery,

1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:30.080
 it plausibly could have seeded many planets in that stellar nursery all at the same time. They're

1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:33.600
 all born at the same time in the same place, pretty close to each other, lots of rocks flying

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:41.520
 around. So a panspermia scenario would then create siblings, i.e. there would be, say, a few thousand

1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:48.240
 other planets out there. So after the nursery forms, it drifts, it separates, they drift apart.

1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:52.560
 And so out there in the galaxy, there would now be a bunch of other stars all formed at the same

1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:58.480
 time. And we can actually spot them in terms of their spectrum. And they would have then started

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:03.440
 on the same path of life as we did with that life being seeded, but they would move at different

1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:11.120
 rates. And most likely, most of them would never reach an advanced level before the deadline. But

1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:18.880
 maybe one other did, and maybe it did before us. So if they did, they could know all this,

1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:22.560
 and they could go searching for their siblings. That is, they could look in the sky for the other

1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:26.880
 stars that match the spectrum that matches the spectrum that came from this nursery.

1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:32.560
 They could identify their sibling stars in the galaxy, the thousand of them. And those would be

1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:38.000
 of special interest to them because they would think, well, life might be on those. And they

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:47.040
 could go looking for them. Can we just, such a brilliant mathematical, philosophical, physical,

1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:53.840
 biological idea of panspermia siblings, because we all kind of started at a similar time

1:39:53.840 --> 1:40:02.560
 in this local pocket of the universe. And so that changes a lot of the math.

1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:06.080
 So that would create this correlation between when advanced life might appear,

1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:10.800
 no longer just random independent spaces and space time. There'd be this cluster, perhaps.

1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:19.040
 And that allows interaction between non grabby alien civilizations, like kind of

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:25.360
 primitive alien civilizations, like us with others. And they might be a little bit ahead.

1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:26.880
 That's so fascinating.

1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:33.600
 They would probably be a lot ahead. So the puzzle is, if they happened before us,

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.400
 they probably happened hundreds of millions of years before us.

1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:38.560
 But less than a billion.

1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:43.760
 Less than a billion, but still plenty of time that they could have become grabby and filled

1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:49.280
 the galaxy and gone beyond. So the fact is, they chose not to become grabby. That would

1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:52.080
 have to be the interpretation. If we have panspermia siblings...

1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:54.480
 Plenty of time to become grabby, you said. So they should be gone.

1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:56.640
 Yes, they had plenty of time and they chose not to.

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:01.680
 Are we sure about this? A hundred million years is enough.

1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:07.600
 So I told you before that I said, within 10 million years, our descendants will become

1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:08.240
 grabby or not.

1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:10.640
 And they'll have that choice. Okay.

1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:16.240
 Right? And so they, clearly more than 10 million years earlier than us, so they chose not to.

1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:20.400
 But still go on vacation, look around, just not grabby.

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:25.040
 If they chose not to expand, that's going to have to be a rule they set to not allow

1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:31.440
 any part of themselves to do it. If they let any little ship fly away with the ability

1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:38.000
 to create a colony, the game's over. Then the universe becomes grabby from their origin

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.240
 with this one colony, right? So in order to prevent their civilization being grabby,

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:46.640
 they have to have a rule they enforce pretty strongly that no part of them can ever try

1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:46.960
 to do that.

1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:52.800
 Through a global authoritarian regime or through something that's internal to them,

1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:56.960
 meaning it's part of the nature of life that it doesn't want...

1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.920
 As like a political officer in the brain or whatever.

1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:07.920
 Yes. There's something in human nature that prevents you from what or like alien nature

1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.280
 that as you get more advanced, you become lazier and lazier in terms of exploration

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:14.480
 and expansion.

1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:20.320
 So I would say they would have to have enforced a rule against expanding and that rule would

1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:25.680
 probably make them reluctant to let people leave very far. You know, any one vacation

1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:29.760
 trip far away could risk an expansion from this vacation trip. So they would probably

1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:34.560
 have a pretty tight lid on just allowing any travel out from their origin in order to

1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:40.640
 enforce this rule. But then we also know, well, they would have chosen to come here.

1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.920
 So clearly they made an exception from their general rule to say, okay, but an expedition

1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:48.160
 to Earth, that should be allowed.

1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:52.640
 It could be intentional exception or incompetent exception.

1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:57.680
 But if incompetent, then they couldn't maintain this over 100 million years, this policy of

1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:01.520
 not allowing any expansion. So we have to see they have successfully, they not just

1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:06.880
 had a policy to try, they succeeded over 100 million years in preventing the expansion.

1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:09.600
 That's a substantial competence.

1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:14.560
 Let me think about this. So you don't think there could be a barrier in 100 million years,

1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:24.160
 you don't think there could be a barrier to like technological barrier to becoming expansionary.

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:30.240
 Imagine the Europeans have tried to prevent anybody from leaving Europe to go to the new

1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:35.280
 world. And imagine what it would have taken to make that happen over 100 million years.

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:37.280
 Yeah, it's impossible.

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:43.360
 They would have had to have very strict, you know, guards at the borders saying, no, you

1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:44.000
 can't go.

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.320
 But just to clarify, you're not suggesting that's actually possible.

1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:50.320
 I am suggesting it's possible.

1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:57.600
 I don't know how you keep, in my silly human brain, maybe it's the brain that values freedom,

1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:03.680
 but I don't know how you can keep, no matter how much force, no matter how much censorship

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:10.480
 or control or so on, I just don't know how you can keep people from exploring into the

1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:11.680
 mysterious, into the unknown.

1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:14.800
 You're thinking of people, we're talking aliens. So remember, there's a vast space

1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:18.400
 of different possible social creatures they could have evolved from, different cultures

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:22.640
 they could be in, different kinds of threats. I mean, there are many things, as you talked

1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:25.040
 about, that most of us would feel very reluctant to do.

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:26.560
 This isn't one of those.

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:33.440
 Okay, so how, if the UFO sightings represent alien visitors, how the heck are they getting

1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:36.320
 here under the panspermia siblings?

1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:40.880
 So panspermia siblings is one part of the scenario, which is that's where they came

1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:44.800
 from. And from that, we can conclude they had this rule against expansion and they've

1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:50.720
 successfully enforced that. That also creates a plausible agenda for why they would be here,

1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:56.000
 that is to enforce that rule on us. That is, if we go out and expanding, then we have defeated

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000
 the purpose of this rule they set up.

1:44:58.000 --> 1:44:58.800
 Interesting.

1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.680
 Right? So they would be here to convince us to not expand.

1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:05.200
 Convince in quotes.

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:09.280
 Right? Through various mechanisms. So obviously, one thing we conclude is they didn't just

1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:13.120
 destroy us. That would have been completely possible, right? So the fact that they're

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:18.560
 here and we are not destroyed means that they chose not to destroy us. They have some degree

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:24.160
 of empathy or whatever their morals are that would make them reluctant to just destroy

1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:25.600
 us. They would rather persuade us.

1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:31.600
 Destroy their brethren. And so they may have been, there's a difference in arrival and

1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:34.480
 observation. They may have been observing for a very long time.

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:35.120
 Exactly.

1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:45.520
 And they arrive to try to, not to try, I don't think to try to ensure that we don't become

1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:46.720
 grabby.

1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:50.640
 Which is because we can see that they did not, they must have enforced a rule against

1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:55.680
 that and they are therefore here to, that's a plausible interpretation why they would

1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:59.520
 risk this expedition when they clearly don't risk very many expeditions over this long

1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:04.720
 period to allow this one exception because otherwise, if they don't, we may become grabby.

1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:06.400
 And they could have just destroyed us, but they didn't.

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:11.360
 And they're closely monitoring the technological advancing of our civilization. Like what

1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:15.840
 nuclear weapons is one thing that, all right, cool. That might have less to do with nuclear

1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:21.760
 weapons and more with nuclear energy. Maybe they're monitoring fusion closely. Like how

1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:23.280
 clever are these apes getting?

1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:28.320
 So no doubt they have a button that if we get too uppity or risky, they can push the

1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:32.800
 button and ensure that we don't expand. But they'd rather do it some other way. So now

1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:36.720
 that's, that explains why they're here and why they aren't out there. But there's another

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:40.000
 thing that we need to explain. There's another key data we need to explain about UFOs if

1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.680
 we're going to have a hypothesis that explains them. And this is something many people have

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:50.400
 noticed, which is they had two extreme options they could have chosen and didn't chose.

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:54.720
 They could have either just remained completely invisible. Clearly an advanced civilization

1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:58.000
 could have been completely invisible. There's no reason they need to fly around and be

1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:02.240
 noticed. They could just be in orbit and in dark satellites that are completely invisible

1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:06.080
 to us watching whatever they want to watch. That would be well within their abilities.

1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:09.360
 That's one thing they could have done. The other thing they could do is just show up

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:13.280
 and land on the White House lawn, as they say, and shake hands, like make themselves

1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:17.600
 really obvious. They could have done either of those and they didn't do either of those.

1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:21.440
 That's the next thing you need to explain about UFOs as aliens. Why would they take

1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:26.640
 this intermediate approach, hanging out near the edge of visibility with somewhat impressive

1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.880
 mechanisms, but not walking up and introducing themselves nor just being completely invisible?

1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:37.360
 So, okay, a lot of questions there. So one, do you think it's obvious where the White

1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:39.760
 House is or the White House lawn?

1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:42.400
 Obvious where there are concentrations of humans that you could go up and introduce.

1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:46.000
 But is humans the most interesting thing about Earth?

1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:46.240
 Yeah.

1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:48.080
 Are you sure about this? Because...

1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:52.960
 If they're worried about an expansion, then they would be worried about a civilization

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:56.800
 that could be capable of expansion. Obviously humans are the civilization on Earth that's

1:47:57.440 --> 1:47:59.600
 by far the closest to being able to expand.

1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:10.800
 I just don't know if aliens obviously see...obviously see humans, like the individual

1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:19.520
 humans, like the meat vehicles, as the center of focus for observing a life on a planet.

1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:23.680
 They're supposed to be really smart and advanced. Like, this shouldn't be that hard for them.

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:27.840
 But I think we're actually the dumb ones, because we think humans are the important

1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:32.640
 things. But it could be our ideas. It could be something about our technologies.

1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:34.560
 But that's mediated with us. It's correlated with us.

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:43.360
 No, we make it seem like it's mediated by us humans. But the focus for alien civilizations

1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:49.200
 might be the AI systems or the technologies themselves. That might be the organism. Like,

1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:57.920
 what humans are like...human is the food, the source of the organism that's under observation,

1:48:57.920 --> 1:48:59.120
 versus like...

1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:03.440
 So what they wanted to have close contact with was something that was closely near humans,

1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.080
 then they would be contacting those. And we would just incidentally see, but we would still see.

1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:12.400
 But don't you think that...isn't it possible, taking their perspective,

1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:16.960
 isn't it possible that they would want to interact with some fundamental aspect that

1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:23.200
 they're interested in without interfering with it? And that's actually a very...no

1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:25.280
 matter how advanced you are, it's very difficult to do.

1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:32.320
 But that's puzzling. So, I mean, the prototypical UFO observation is a shiny,

1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:41.200
 big object in the sky that has very rapid acceleration and no apparent surfaces for

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:50.960
 using air to manipulate at speed. And the question is, why that? Again, if they just...

1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:55.200
 For example, if they just wanted to talk to our computer systems, they could move some sort of

1:49:55.200 --> 1:50:00.720
 like a little probe that connects to a wire and reads and sends bits there. They don't need a

1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:02.160
 shiny thing flying in the sky.

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:08.960
 But don't you think they would be looking for the right way to communicate, the right

1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:13.280
 language to communicate? Everything you just said, looking at the computer systems,

1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:20.320
 I mean, that's not a trivial thing. Coming up with a signal that us humans would not freak out

1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.240
 too much about, but also understand, might not be that trivial.

1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:28.320
 Well, so the not freak out part is another interesting constraint. So again, I said,

1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:31.920
 like the two obvious strategies are just to remain completely invisible and watch,

1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:36.800
 which would be quite feasible, or to just directly interact, come out and be really

1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:41.280
 very direct, right? I mean, there's big things that you can see around. There's big cities,

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:45.440
 there's aircraft carriers, there's lots of... If you want to just find a big thing and come

1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:49.280
 right up to it and like tap it on the shoulder or whatever, that would be quite feasible,

1:50:49.280 --> 1:50:57.280
 then they're not doing that. So my hypothesis is that one of the other questions there was,

1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:02.160
 do they have a status hierarchy? And I think most animals on earth who are social animals

1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:07.040
 who are social animals have status hierarchy, and they would reasonably presume that we have

1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:09.840
 a status hierarchy. And...

1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:11.360
 Take me to your leader.

1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:17.200
 Well, I would say their strategy is to be impressive and sort of get us to see them

1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:25.520
 at the top of our status hierarchy. That's how, for example, we domesticate dogs, right?

1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:30.720
 We convince dogs we're the leader of their pack, right? And we domesticate many animals that way,

1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:34.800
 but as we just swap into the top of their status hierarchy and we say,

1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:38.720
 we're your top status animal, so you should do what we say, you should follow our lead.

1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:47.440
 So the idea that would be, they are going to get us to do what they want by being top status.

1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:52.720
 You know, all through history, kings and emperors, et cetera, have tried to impress their citizens

1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:56.640
 and other people by having the bigger palace, the bigger parade, the bigger crown and

1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:00.880
 diamonds, right? Whatever, maybe building a bigger pyramid, et cetera. It's a very well

1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:05.680
 established trend to just be high status by being more impressive than the rest.

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:11.520
 To push back when there's an order of several orders of magnitude of power differential,

1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:16.560
 asymmetry of power, I feel like that status hierarchy no longer applies. It's like memetic

1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:18.000
 theory. It's like...

1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:22.960
 Most emperors are several orders of magnitude more powerful than any one member of their empire.

1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:27.840
 Let's increase that by even more. So like if I'm interacting with ants,

1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:38.880
 I no longer feel like I need to establish my power with ants. I actually want to lower myself

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:43.760
 to the ants. I want to become the lowest possible ant so that they would welcome me.

1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:48.800
 So I'm less concerned about them worshiping me. I'm more concerned about them welcoming me.

1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:52.880
 It is important that you be nonthreatening and that you be local. So I think

1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:56.960
 for example, if the aliens had done something really big in the sky, 100 light years away,

1:52:57.600 --> 1:53:02.800
 that would be there, not here. And that could seem threatening. So I think their strategy to

1:53:02.800 --> 1:53:06.480
 be the high status would have to be to be visible, but to be here and nonthreatening.

1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:11.680
 I just don't know if it's obvious how to do that. Take your own perspective. You see a planet

1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:20.640
 with relatively intelligent complex structures being formed, life forms. You could see this

1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:29.600
 under in Titan or something like that, Europa. You start to see not just primitive bacterial

1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:35.440
 life, but multicellular life. And it seems to form some very complicated cellular colonies,

1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:43.200
 structures that they're dynamic. There's a lot of stuff going on. Some gigantic cellular automata

1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:51.360
 type of construct. How do you make yourself known to them in an impressive fashion

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:56.880
 without destroying it? We know how to destroy potentially.

1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:02.160
 Right. So if you go touch stuff, you're likely to hurt it, right? There's a good risk of hurting

1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:04.880
 something by getting too close and touching it and interacting, right?

1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:06.880
 Yeah, like landing on a White House lawn.

1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:12.960
 Right. So the claim is that their current strategy of hanging out at the periphery of

1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:17.600
 our vision and just being very clearly physically impressive with very clear physically impressive

1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:25.360
 abilities is at least a plausible strategy they might use to impress us and convince us sort of

1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:30.960
 we're at the top of their status hierarchy. And I would say if they came closer, not only would

1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:35.600
 they risk hurting us in ways that they couldn't really understand, but more plausibly, they would

1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:40.960
 reveal things about themselves we would hate. So if you look at how we treat other civilizations

1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:46.880
 on Earth and other people, we are generally interested in foreigners and people from other

1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.120
 plant lands. And we were generally interested in their varying cult customs, et cetera,

1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:55.200
 until we find out that they do something that violates our moral norms and then we hate them.

1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:01.200
 And these are aliens for God's sakes, right? There's just going to be something about them

1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:05.760
 that we hate. They eat babies. Who knows what it is? Something they don't think is offensive,

1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:11.120
 but that they think we might find. And so they would be risking a lot by revealing a lot about

1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:16.320
 themselves. We would find something we hated. Interesting. But do you resonate at all with

1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:21.680
 memetic theory where like, we only feel this way about things that are very close to us.

1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:26.880
 So aliens are sufficiently different to where we'll be like, fascinated, terrified or fascinated,

1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:30.800
 but not like. Right, but if they want to be at the top of our status hierarchy to get us to

1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:35.520
 follow them, they can't be too distant. They have to be close enough that we would see them that

1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:41.280
 way. But pretend to be close enough. Right. And not reveal much that mystery that old Clint Eastwood

1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:47.520
 cowboy. I mean, we're clever enough that we can figure out their agenda. That is just from the

1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:51.520
 fact that we're here. If we see that they're here, we can figure out, Oh, they want us not to expand

1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:55.920
 and look, they are this huge power and they're very impressive. So, and a lot of us don't want

1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:02.000
 to expand. So that could easily tip us over the edge toward we already wanted to not expand. We

1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:07.040
 already wanted to be able to regulate and have a central community. And here are these very advanced

1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:12.400
 smart aliens who have survived for a hundred million years and they're telling us not to expand

1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:21.360
 either. This is brilliant. I love this so much. Uh, the, the, so returning to panspermia siblings,

1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:31.120
 just to clarify one thing in that framework, how would, who originated, who planted it?

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:36.960
 Would it be a grabby alien civilization that planted the siblings or no? The simple scenario

1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:44.080
 is that life started on some other planet billions of years ago and it went through part of the

1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:49.440
 stages of evolution to advance life, but not all the way to advance life. And then some rock hit

1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:54.640
 it, grabbed a piece of it on the rock and that rock drifted for maybe in a million years until

1:56:54.640 --> 1:57:00.240
 it happened to prong the stellar nursery where it then seeded many stars. And something about that

1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:05.360
 life without being super advanced, it was nevertheless resilient to the harsh conditions

1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:10.480
 of space. There's some graphs that I've been impressed by that show sort of the level of

1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:16.880
 genetic information in various kinds of life on the history of earth. And basically we are now

1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:22.000
 more complex than the earlier life, but the earlier life was still pretty complex. And so if

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:27.280
 you actually project this log graph in history, it looks like it was many billions of years ago

1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:31.520
 when you get down to zero. So like plausible, you could say there was just a lot of evolution that

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:35.520
 had to happen before you to get to the simplest life we've ever seen in history of life on earth

1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:40.800
 was still pretty damn complicated. Okay. And so that race, that's always been this puzzle. How

1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:46.560
 could life get to this enormously complicated level in the short period it seems to at the

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:52.560
 beginning of earth history. So where, you know, it's only 300 million years at most when it

1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:57.840
 appeared. And then it was really complicated at that point. So panspermia allows you to

1:57:57.840 --> 1:58:02.480
 explain that complexity by saying, well, it's been another 5 billion years on another planet

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:06.720
 going through lots of earlier stages where it was working its way up to the level of

1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:12.080
 complexity you see at the beginning of earth. We'll try to talk about other ideas of the

1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:18.480
 origin of life, but let me return to UFO sightings. Is there other explanations that are possible

1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:26.640
 outside of panspermia siblings that can explain no grabby aliens in the sky and yet alien arrival

1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:33.280
 on earth? Well, the other categories of explanations that most people will use is, well,

1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:37.440
 first of all, just mistakes, like, you know, you're, you're, you're confusing something

1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:43.840
 ordinary for something mysterious, right? Or some sort of secret organization, like our

1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:48.720
 government is secretly messing with us and trying to do a, you know, a false flag ops

1:58:48.720 --> 1:58:52.080
 or whatever, right? You know, they're trying to convince the Russians or the Chinese that

1:58:52.080 --> 1:58:56.880
 there might be aliens and scare them into not attacking or something, right? Because

1:58:56.880 --> 1:59:00.720
 if you, you know, the history of World War II, say the US government did all these big

1:59:00.720 --> 1:59:05.600
 fake operations where they were faking a lot of big things in order to mess with people.

1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:09.680
 So that's a possibility. The government has been lying and, you know, faking things and

1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:16.240
 paying people to lie about what they saw, et cetera. That's a plausible set of explanations

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:21.440
 for the range of sightings seen. And another explanation people offer is some other hidden

1:59:21.440 --> 1:59:26.080
 organization on earth or some, you know, secret organization somewhere that has much more

1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:30.400
 advanced capabilities than anybody's given a credit for, for some reason it's been keeping

1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:35.040
 secret. I mean, they all sound somewhat implausible, but again, we're looking for maybe,

1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:40.400
 you know, one in a thousand sort of priors. Question is, you know, could, could they be

1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:46.320
 in that level of plausibility? Can we just linger on this? So you, first of all, you've written,

1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:54.320
 talked about, thought about so many different topics. You're an incredible mind. And I just

1:59:54.320 --> 1:59:59.520
 thank you for sitting down today. I'm almost like at a loss of which place we explore,

1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:05.600
 but let me on this topic, ask about conspiracy theories because you've written about institutions

2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:18.320
 authorities. What, this is a bit of a therapy session, but what do we make of conspiracy

2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:25.120
 theories? The phrase itself is pushing you in a direction, right? So clearly in history,

2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:30.240
 we've had many large coordinated keepings of secrets, right? Say the Manhattan project,

2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:34.240
 right? And there was hundreds of thousands of people working on that over many years,

2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:39.600
 but they kept it a secret, right? Clearly many large military operations have kept things secrets

2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:47.040
 over, you know, even decades with many thousands of people involved. So clearly it's possible to

2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:53.840
 keep some things secret over time periods. You know, but the more people you involve and the

2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:59.040
 more time you are assuming and the more, the less centralized an organization or the less

2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:02.880
 discipline they have, the harder it gets to believe. But we're just trying to calibrate

2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:07.600
 basically in our minds, which kind of secrets can be kept by which groups over what time periods

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:14.960
 for what purposes, right? But let me, I don't have enough data. So I'm somebody, I, you know,

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:22.400
 I hang out with people and I love people. I love all things really. And I just, I think that most

2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:27.760
 people, even the assholes have the capacity to be good and they're beautiful and I enjoy them.

2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:33.200
 So the kind of data, my brain, whatever the chemistry of my brain is that sees the beautiful

2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:41.760
 in things is maybe collecting a subset of data that doesn't allow me to intuit the competence

2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:50.800
 that humans are able to achieve in constructing a conspiracy theory. So for example, one thing

2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:55.920
 that people often talk about is like intelligence agencies, this like broad thing. They say the CIA,

2:01:55.920 --> 2:02:02.720
 the FSB, the different, the British intelligence. I've fortunate or unfortunate enough, never gotten

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:11.760
 the chance that I know of to talk to any member of those intelligence agencies nor like take a

2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:16.480
 peek behind the curtain or the first curtain. I don't know how many levels of curtains there are.

2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:22.800
 And so I don't, I can't intuit my interactions with government. I was funded by DOD and DARPA

2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:31.440
 and I've interacted, been to the Pentagon, like with all due respect to my friends, lovely friends

2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:36.960
 in government. And there are a lot of incredible people, but there is a very giant bureaucracy

2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:43.440
 that sometimes suffocates the ingenuity of the human spirit is one way I can put it. Meaning

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:50.240
 they are, I just, it's difficult for me to imagine extreme competence at a scale of hundreds or

2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:56.240
 thousands human beings. Now that doesn't mean that's my very anecdotal data of the situation.

2:02:56.240 --> 2:03:05.600
 And so I try to build up my intuition about centralized system of government, how much

2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:14.000
 conspiracy is possible, how much the intelligence agencies or some other source can generate

2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:20.720
 sufficiently robust propaganda that controls the populace. If you look at World War II, as you

2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:26.960
 mentioned, there've been extremely powerful propaganda machines on the Nazi, on the side of

2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:33.120
 Nazi Germany, on the side of the Soviet Union, on the side of the United States and all these different

2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:40.560
 mechanisms. Sometimes they control the free press through social pressures. Sometimes they control

2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:47.520
 the press through the threat of violence, as you do in authoritarian regimes. Sometimes it's like

2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:53.600
 deliberately the dictator, like writing the news, the headlines and literally announcing it. And

2:03:53.600 --> 2:04:02.560
 something about human psychology forces you to embrace the narrative and believe the narrative.

2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:09.520
 And at scale that becomes reality when the initial spark was just the propaganda thought in a single

2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:19.680
 individual's mind. So I can't necessarily intuit of what's possible, but I'm skeptical of the power

2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:26.800
 of human institutions to construct conspiracy theories that cause suffering at scale, especially

2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:32.160
 in this modern age when information is becoming more and more accessible by the populace. Anyway,

2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:35.120
 that's the, I don't know if you can elucidate for us.

2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:39.520
 It's called suffering at scale, but of course, say during wartime, the people who are managing

2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:45.040
 the various conspiracies like D Day or Manhattan Project, they thought that their conspiracy was

2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:49.760
 avoiding harm rather than causing harm. So if you can get a lot of people to think that supporting

2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:57.120
 the conspiracy is helpful, then a lot more might do that. And there's just a lot of things that

2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:01.920
 people just don't want to see. So if you can make your conspiracy the sort of thing that people

2:05:01.920 --> 2:05:07.280
 wouldn't want to talk about anyway, even if they knew about it, you're most of the way there.

2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:12.640
 So I have learned many over the years, many things that most ordinary people would never want to

2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:17.200
 hear, many things that most ordinary people should be interested in, but somehow don't know,

2:05:17.200 --> 2:05:21.600
 even though the data has been very widespread. So I have this book, The Elephant and the Brain,

2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:27.440
 and one of the chapters is there on medicine. And basically, most people seem ignorant of the very

2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:31.760
 basic fact that when we do randomized trials where we give some people more medicine than others,

2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:37.360
 the people who get more medicine are not healthier. Just overall, in general, just like

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:42.160
 induce somebody to get more medicine because you just give them more budget to buy medicine, say.

2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:46.960
 And not a specific medicine, just the whole category. And you would think that would be

2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:50.800
 something most people should know about medicine. You might even think that would be a conspiracy

2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:55.760
 theory to think that would be hidden, but in fact, most people never learn that fact.

2:05:55.760 --> 2:06:02.080
 So just to clarify, just a general high level statement, the more medicine you take,

2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:03.200
 the less healthy you are.

2:06:04.480 --> 2:06:10.080
 Randomized experiments don't find that fact. Do not find that more medicine makes you more healthy.

2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:15.520
 There's just no connection. In randomized experiments, there's no relationship between

2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:16.400
 more medicine and being healthier.

2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:19.680
 So it's not a negative relationship, but it's just no relationship.

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:20.180
 Right.

2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:27.440
 And so the conspiracy theory would say that the businesses that sell you medicine don't want you

2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:32.800
 to know that fact. And then you're saying that there's also part of this is that people just

2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:33.760
 don't want to know.

2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:38.560
 They just don't want to know. And so they don't learn this. So I've lived in the Washington area

2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:42.960
 for several decades now, reading the Washington Post regularly. Every week there was a special

2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:48.400
 section on health and medicine. It never was mentioned in that section of the paper

2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:49.680
 in all the 20 years I read that.

2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:54.560
 So do you think there is some truth to this caricatured blue pill, red pill,

2:06:55.280 --> 2:06:57.920
 where most people don't want to know the truth?

2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:02.080
 There are many things about which people don't want to know certain kinds of truths.

2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:07.520
 Yeah. That is bad looking truths, truths that discouraging, truths that sort of take away the

2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:10.080
 justification for things they feel passionate about.

2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:15.120
 Do you think that's a bad aspect of human nature? That's something we should try to overcome?

2:07:16.880 --> 2:07:22.000
 Well, as we discussed, my first priority is to just tell people about it, to do the analysis

2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:26.240
 and the cold facts of what's actually happening, and then to try to be careful about how we can

2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:30.560
 improve. So our book, The Elephant in the Rain, coauthored with Kevin Simler, is about how we

2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:35.920
 hide motives in everyday life. And our first priority there is just to explain to you what are

2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:40.880
 the things that you are not looking at that you have reluctant to look at. And many people try

2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:44.560
 to take that book as a self help book where they're trying to improve themselves and make

2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:49.200
 sure they look at more things. And that often goes badly because it's harder to actually do

2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:55.680
 that than you think. But we at least want you to know that this truth is available if you want

2:07:55.680 --> 2:07:56.400
 to learn about it.

2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:01.520
 It's the Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. Let's talk about

2:08:01.520 --> 2:08:08.480
 this elephant in the brain. Amazing book. The elephant in the room is, quote, an important

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:13.360
 issue that people are reluctant to acknowledge or address a social taboo. The elephant in the brain

2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:20.000
 is an important but unacknowledged feature of how our mind works, an introspective taboo.

2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:28.720
 You describe selfishness and self deception as the core or some of the core elephants,

2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:34.240
 some of the elephants, elephant offspring in the brain. Selfishness and self deception.

2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:36.240
 All right.

2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:43.200
 Can you explain, can you explain why these are the taboos in our brain that we

2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:46.880
 don't want to acknowledge to ourselves?

2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:53.280
 Your conscious mind, the one that's listening to me that I'm talking to at the moment, you like

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:58.960
 to think of yourself as the president or king of your mind, ruling over all that you see,

2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:06.240
 issuing commands that immediately obeyed. You are instead better understood as the press secretary

2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:12.800
 of your brain. You don't make decisions. You justify them to an audience. That's what your

2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:20.640
 conscious mind is for. You watch what you're doing and you try to come up with stories that explain

2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:26.880
 what you're doing so that you can avoid accusations of violating norms. So humans compared to most

2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:32.480
 other animals have norms, and this allows us to manage larger groups with our morals and norms

2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:38.160
 about what we should or shouldn't be doing. This is so important to us that we needed to be

2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:43.440
 constantly watching what we were doing in order to make sure we had a good story to avoid norm

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:48.480
 violations. So many norms are about motives. So if I hit you on purpose, that's a big violation.

2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:52.960
 If I hit you accidentally, that's okay. I need to be able to explain why it was an accident

2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:53.760
 and not on purpose.

2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:58.880
 So where does that need come from for your own self preservation?

2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:03.040
 Right. So humans have norms and we have the norm that if we see anybody violating a norm,

2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:09.200
 we need to tell other people and then coordinate to make them stop and punish them for violating.

2:10:09.200 --> 2:10:15.360
 So such benefits are strong enough and severe enough that we each want to avoid being successfully

2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:21.760
 accused of violating norms. So for example, hitting someone on purpose is a big clear norm

2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:25.520
 violation. If we do it consistently, we may be thrown out of the group and that would mean we

2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:30.960
 would die. Okay. So we need to be able to convince people we are not going around hitting people on

2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:37.440
 purpose. If somebody happens to be at the other end of our fist and their face connects, that was

2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:43.680
 an accident and we need to be able to explain that. And similarly for many other norms humans

2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:48.560
 have, we are serious about these norms and we don't want people to violate. We find them

2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:53.360
 violating, we're going to accuse them. But many norms have a motive component. And so we are

2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:58.160
 trying to explain ourselves and make sure we have a good motive story about everything we do,

2:10:58.160 --> 2:11:02.880
 which is why we're constantly trying to explain what we're doing. And that's what your conscious

2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:07.280
 mind is doing. It is trying to make sure you've got a good motive story for everything you're

2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:12.320
 doing. And that's why you don't know why you really do things. What you know is what the good

2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:17.280
 story is about why you've been doing things. And that's the self deception. And you're saying that

2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:24.000
 there is a machine, the actual dictator is selfish. And then you're just the press secretary who's

2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.440
 desperately doesn't want to get fired and is justifying all of the decisions of the dictator.

2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:31.040
 And that's the self deception.

2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:36.400
 Right. Now, most people actually are willing to believe that this is true in the abstract. So

2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:41.120
 our book has been classified as psychology and it was reviewed by psychologists. And the basic

2:11:41.120 --> 2:11:46.800
 way that psychology referees and reviewers responded is to say, this is well known. Most

2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:49.040
 people accept that there's a fair bit of self deception.

2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:51.120
 But they don't want to accept it about themselves.

2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:55.840
 Well, they don't want to accept it about the particular topics that we talk about. So people

2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:00.240
 accept the idea in the abstract that they might be self deceived or that they might not be honest

2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:05.120
 about various things. But that hasn't penetrated into the literatures where people are explaining

2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:10.560
 particular things like why we go to school, why we go to the doctor, why we vote, et cetera. So

2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:16.000
 our book is mainly about 10 areas of life and explaining about in each area what our actual

2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:23.520
 motives there are. And people who study those things have not admitted that hidden motives are

2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:25.280
 explaining those particular areas.

2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:30.080
 So they haven't taken the leap from theoretical psychology to actual public policy.

2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:30.800
 Exactly.

2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:38.080
 And economics and all that kind of stuff. Well, let me just linger on this and bring up my old

2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:47.280
 friends Zingman Freud and Carl Jung. So how vast is this landscape of the unconscious mind,

2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:56.080
 the power and the scope of the dictator? Is it only dark there? Is it some light? Is there some

2:12:56.080 --> 2:12:56.720
 love?

2:12:56.720 --> 2:13:02.080
 The vast majority of what's happening in your head, you're unaware of. So in a literal sense,

2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:07.520
 the unconscious, the aspects of your mind that you're not conscious of is the overwhelming

2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:12.960
 majority. But that's just true in a literal engineering sense. Your mind is doing lots of

2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:17.040
 low level things, and you just can't be consciously aware of all that low level stuff. But there's

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:19.680
 plenty of room there for lots of things you're not aware of.

2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:26.480
 But can we try to shine a light at the things we're unaware of specifically? Now, again,

2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:32.080
 staying with the philosophical psychology side for a moment, can you shine a light in the Jungian

2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:40.080
 shadow? What's going on there? What is this machine like? What level of thoughts are happening

2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:46.400
 there? Is it something that we can even interpret? If we somehow could visualize it, is it something

2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:51.840
 that's human interpretable? Or is it just a kind of chaos of monitoring different systems in the

2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:58.400
 body, making sure you're happy, making sure you're fed all those kind of basic forces that form

2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:01.760
 abstractions on top of each other, and they're not introspective at all?

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:06.800
 We humans are social creatures. Plausibly being social is the main reason we have these unusually

2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:13.360
 large brains. Therefore, most of our brain is devoted to being social. And so the things we are

2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:19.520
 very obsessed with and constantly paying attention to are, how do I look to others? What would others

2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:23.040
 think of me if they knew these various things they might learn about me?

2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:28.000
 So that's close to being fundamental to what it means to be human, is caring what others think.

2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:34.160
 Right. To be trying to present a story that would be okay for what others think. But we're very

2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:36.720
 constantly thinking, what do other people think?

2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:45.360
 So let me ask you this question then about you, Robin Hansen, who in many places, sometimes for

2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:52.640
 fun, sometimes as a basic statement of principle, likes to disagree with what the majority of people

2:14:52.640 --> 2:15:02.000
 think. So how do you explain, how are you self deceiving yourself in this task? And how are you

2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:08.960
 being self, like, why is the dictator manipulating you inside your head to be so critical? Like,

2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:14.640
 there's norms. Why do you want to stand out in this way? Why do you want to challenge the

2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:15.520
 norms in this way?

2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:20.800
 Almost by definition, I can't tell you what I'm deceiving myself about. But the more practical

2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:25.840
 strategy that's quite feasible is to ask about what are typical things that most people deceive

2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:29.280
 themselves about, and then to own up to those particular things.

2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:32.000
 Sure. What's a good one?

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.360
 So for example, I can very much acknowledge that I would like to be well thought of,

2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:47.920
 that I would be seeking attention and glory and praise from my intellectual work, and that that

2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:55.600
 would be a major agenda driving my intellectual attempts. So if there were topics that other

2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:59.760
 people would find less interesting, I might be less interested in those for that reason,

2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:04.080
 for example. I might want to find topics where other people are interested, and I might want to

2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:13.680
 go for the glory of finding a big insight rather than a small one, and maybe one that was

2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:19.040
 especially surprising. That's also, of course, consistent with some more ideal concept of what

2:16:19.040 --> 2:16:27.200
 an intellectual should be. But most intellectuals are relatively risk averse. They are in some

2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:32.400
 local intellectual tradition, and they are adding to that, and they are staying conforming to the

2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:37.200
 sort of usual assumptions and usual accepted beliefs and practices of a particular area

2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:45.200
 so that they can be accepted in that area and treated as part of the community. But you might

2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:49.840
 think for the purpose of the larger intellectual project of understanding the world better,

2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:55.600
 people should be less eager to just add a little bit to some tradition, and they should be looking

2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:59.600
 for what's neglected between the major traditions and major questions. They should be looking for

2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:04.560
 assumptions maybe we're making that are wrong. They should be looking at things that are very

2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:10.960
 surprising, things that you would have thought a priori unlikely that once you are convinced of it,

2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:21.120
 you find that to be very important and a big update. So you could say that one motivation

2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:26.800
 I might have is less motivated to be sort of comfortably accepted into some particular

2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:33.440
 intellectual community and more willing to just go for these more fundamental long shots that should

2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:35.440
 be very important if you could find them.

2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:45.280
 Which would, if you can find them, would get you appreciated across a larger number of people

2:17:45.280 --> 2:17:52.640
 across the longer time span of history. So like maybe the small local community will say,

2:17:52.640 --> 2:18:00.000
 you suck, you must conform. But the larger community will see the brilliance of you

2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:06.960
 breaking out of the cage of the small conformity into a larger cage. There's always a bigger cage

2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:13.840
 and then you'll be remembered by more. Yeah. Also that explains your choice of colorful shirt that

2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:17.120
 looks great in a black background. So you definitely stand out.

2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:22.880
 Right. Now, of course, you could say, well, you could get all this attention by making false

2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:28.880
 claims of dramatic improvement. And then wouldn't that be much easier than actually working through

2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:30.720
 all the details to make true claims?

2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:37.360
 Why not? Let me ask the press secretary. Why not? So of course you spoke several times about how

2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:43.520
 much you value truth and the pursuit of truth. That's a very nice narrative. Hitler and Stalin

2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:51.040
 also talked about the value of truth. Do you worry when you introspect as broadly as all humans

2:18:51.040 --> 2:19:03.360
 might that it becomes a drug, this being a martyr, being the person who points out that the emperor

2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:11.040
 wears no clothes, even when the emperor is obviously dressed, just to be the person who points

2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:14.560
 out that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Do you think about that?

2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:22.000
 So I think the standards you hold yourself to are dependent on the audience you have in mind.

2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:29.680
 So if you think of your audience as relatively easily fooled or relatively gullible, then you

2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:36.160
 won't bother to generate more complicated, deep, you know, arguments and structures and evidence

2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:42.960
 to persuade somebody who has higher standards because why bother? You don't have to worry

2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:47.440
 about it. Why bother? You can get away with something much easier. And of course, if you are,

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:53.520
 say, a salesperson, you know, you make money on sales, then you don't need to convince the top few

2:19:53.520 --> 2:19:58.560
 percent of the most sharp customers. You can just go for the bottom 60 percent of the most gullible

2:19:58.560 --> 2:20:06.160
 customers and make plenty of sales, right? So I think intellectuals have to vary. One of the main

2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:09.840
 ways intellectuals vary is in who is their audience in their mind? Who are they trying to

2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:15.680
 impress? Is it the people down the hall? Is it the people who are reading their Twitter feed? Is it

2:20:15.680 --> 2:20:23.600
 their parents? Is it their high school teacher? Or is it Einstein and Freud and Socrates, right?

2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:31.040
 So I think those of us who are especially arrogant, especially think that we're really

2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:34.960
 big shot or have a chance at being a really big shot, we were naturally going to pick the

2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:39.360
 big shot audience that we can. We're going to be trying to impress Socrates and Einstein.

2:20:39.360 --> 2:20:44.400
 Is that why you hang out with Tyler Cohen a lot and try to convince him yourself?

2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:48.320
 And you might think, you know, from the point of view of just making money or having sex or

2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:54.000
 other sorts of things, this is misdirected energy, right? Trying to impress the very

2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:59.360
 most highest quality minds. That's such a small sample and they can't do that much for you anyway.

2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:04.640
 Yeah. So I might well have had more, you know, ordinary success in life,

2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:10.160
 be more popular, invited to more parties, make more money if I had targeted a lower tier

2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:17.040
 set of intellectuals with the standards they have. But for some reason I decided early on

2:21:17.040 --> 2:21:22.320
 that Einstein was my audience or people like him and I was going to impress them.

2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:27.600
 Yeah. I mean, you pick your set of motivations, you know, convincing,

2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:32.560
 impressing Tyler Cohen is not going to help you get laid. Trust me, I tried. All right.

2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:43.760
 What are some notable sort of effects of the elephant in the brain in everyday life? So you

2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:50.320
 mentioned when we try to apply that to economics, to public policy. So when we think about medicine,

2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:53.280
 education, all those kinds of things, what are some things that we're...

2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:59.280
 The key thing is medicine is much less useful health wise than you think. So, you know,

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:04.000
 if you were focused on your health, you would care a lot less about it. And if you were focused

2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:08.880
 on other people's health, you would also care a lot less about it. But if medicine is, as we

2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:12.320
 suggest, more about showing that you care and let other people showing that they care about you,

2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:18.400
 then a lot of priority on medicine can make sense. So that was our very earliest discussion

2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:22.640
 in the podcast. You were talking about what, you know, should you give people a lot of medicine

2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:27.360
 when it's not very effective? And then the answer then is, well, if that's the way that you show

2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:32.080
 that you care about them and you really want them to know you care, then maybe that's what

2:22:32.080 --> 2:22:37.280
 you need to do if you can't find a cheaper, more effective substitute. So if we actually just pause

2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:44.720
 on that for a little bit, how do we start to untangle the full set of self deception happening

2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:49.840
 in the space of medicine? So we have a method that we use in our book that is what I recommend

2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:54.480
 for people to use in all these sorts of topics. The straightforward method is first, don't look

2:22:54.480 --> 2:23:00.800
 at yourself. Look at other people, look at broad patterns of behavior and other people, and then

2:23:00.800 --> 2:23:05.920
 ask, what are the various theories we could have to explain these patterns of behavior? And then

2:23:05.920 --> 2:23:11.680
 just do the simple matching, which theory better matches the behavior they have. And the last step

2:23:11.680 --> 2:23:17.680
 is to assume that's true of you too. Don't assume you're an exception. If you happen to be an

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:22.160
 exception, that won't go so well, but nevertheless, on average, you aren't very well positioned to

2:23:22.160 --> 2:23:27.280
 judge if you're an exception. So look at what other people do, explain what other people do,

2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:34.320
 and assume that's you too. But also in the case of medicine, there's several parties to consider.

2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:38.400
 So there's the individual person that's receiving the medicine. There's the doctors that are

2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:45.200
 prescribing the medicine. There's drug companies that are selling drugs. There are governments that

2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:51.200
 have regulations that are lobbyists. So you can build up a network of categories of humans in this

2:23:51.760 --> 2:24:00.400
 and they each play their role. So how do you introspect the sort of analyze the system at a

2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:07.040
 system scale versus at the individual scale? So it turns out that in general, it's usually much

2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:13.200
 easier to explain producer behavior than consumer behavior. That is, the drug companies or the

2:24:13.200 --> 2:24:20.320
 doctors have relatively clear incentives to give the customers whatever they want. And so many say

2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:24.880
 governments in democratic countries have the incentive to give the voters what they want.

2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:31.760
 So that focuses your attention on the patient and the voter in this equation and saying,

2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:34.800
 what do they want? They would be driving the rest of the system.

2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:42.240
 Whatever they want, the other parties are willing to give them in order to get paid. So now we're

2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:48.720
 looking for puzzles in patient and voter behavior. What are they choosing? And why do they choose

2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:55.120
 that? And how much exactly? And then we can explain that potentially again, returning to

2:24:55.120 --> 2:25:00.640
 the producer, but the producer being incentivized to manipulate the decision making processes of

2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:06.560
 the voter and the consumer. Now, in almost every industry, producers are in general happy to lie

2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:11.760
 and exaggerate in order to get more customers. This is true of auto repair as much as human

2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:16.400
 body repair and medicine. So the differences between these industries can't be explained

2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:20.960
 by the willingness of the producers to give customers what they want or to do various things

2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:26.560
 that we have to again, go to the customers. Why are customers treating body repair different

2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:35.120
 than auto repair? Yeah, and that potentially requires a lot of thinking, a lot of data

2:25:35.120 --> 2:25:39.520
 collection and potentially looking at historical data too, because things don't just happen

2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:43.440
 overnight. Over time, there's trends. In principle it does, but actually it's a lot,

2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:47.840
 actually easier than you might think. I think the biggest limitation is just the willingness

2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:53.200
 to consider alternative hypotheses. So many of the patterns that you need to rely on are actually

2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:58.080
 pretty obvious, simple patterns. You just have to notice them and ask yourself, how can I explain

2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:04.400
 those? Often you don't need to look at the most subtle, most difficult statistical evidence that

2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:10.240
 might be out there. The simplest patterns are often enough. All right. So there's a fundamental

2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:14.640
 statement about self deception in the book. There's the application of that, like we just did

2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:22.640
 in medicine. Can you steel man the argument that many of the foundational ideas in the book are

2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:31.920
 wrong? Meaning there's two that you just made, which is it can be a lot simpler than it looks.

2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:38.080
 Can you steel man the case that it's, case by case, it's always super complicated. Like it's

2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.320
 a complex system. It's very difficult to have a simple model about. It's very difficult to

2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:50.960
 introspect. And the other one is that the human brain isn't, not just about self deception. That

2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:57.680
 there's a lot of, there's a lot of motivations at play and we are able to really introspect our own

2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:03.360
 mind. And like what, what's on the surface of the conscious is actually quite a good representation

2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:07.920
 of what's going on in the brain. And you're not deceiving yourself. You're able to actually

2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:13.040
 arrive to deeply think about where your mind stands and what you think about the world. And

2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:17.360
 it's less about impressing people and more about being a free thinking individual.

2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:26.240
 So when a child tries to explain why they don't have their homework assignment, they are sometimes

2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:31.680
 inclined to say, the dog ate my homework. They almost never say the dragon ate my homework.

2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:38.880
 The reason is the dragon is a completely implausible explanation. Almost always when we

2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:44.640
 make excuses for things, we choose things that are at least in some degree plausible. It could

2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:51.840
 perhaps have happened. That's an obstacle for any explanation of a hidden motive or a hidden

2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:57.280
 feature of human behavior. If people are pretending one thing while really doing another,

2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:02.240
 they're usually going to pick as a pretense something that's somewhat plausible. That's

2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:09.280
 going to be an obstacle to proving that hypothesis if you are focused on sort of the local data that

2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:12.960
 a person would typically have if they were challenged. So if you're just looking at one

2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:18.560
 kid and his lack of homework, maybe you can't tell whether his dog ate his homework or not.

2:28:18.560 --> 2:28:24.240
 If you happen to know he doesn't have a dog, you might have more confidence. You will need to have

2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:29.200
 a wider range of evidence than a typical person would when they're encountering that actual excuse

2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:36.560
 in order to see past the excuse. That will just be a general feature of it. So if I say,

2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:41.280
 there's this usual story about where we go to the doctor and then there's this other explanation,

2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:47.600
 it'll be true that you'll have to look at wider data in order to see that because people don't

2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:53.040
 usually offer excuses unless in the local context of their excuse, they can get away with it. That

2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:58.960
 is, it's hard to tell, right? So in the case of medicine, I have to point you to sort of larger

2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:07.040
 sets of data. But in many areas of academia, including health economics, the researchers there

2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:13.360
 also want to support the usual points of view. And so they will have selection effects in their

2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:18.320
 publications and their analysis whereby they, if they're getting a result too much contrary to the

2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:24.080
 usual point of view everybody wants to have, they will file drawer that paper or redo the analysis

2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:29.760
 until they get an answer that's more to people's liking. So that means in the health economics

2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:34.800
 literature, there are plenty of people who will claim that in fact, we have evidence that medicine

2:29:34.800 --> 2:29:41.200
 is effective. And when I respond, I will have to point you to our most reliable evidence.

2:29:41.200 --> 2:29:46.640
 And ask you to consider the possibility that the literature is biased in that when the evidence

2:29:46.640 --> 2:29:50.560
 isn't as reliable, when they have more degrees of freedom in order to get the answer they want,

2:29:50.560 --> 2:29:55.040
 they do tend to get the answer they want. But when we get to the kind of evidence that's much

2:29:55.040 --> 2:30:01.440
 harder to mess with, that's where we will see the truth be more revealed. So with respect to

2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:07.600
 medicine, we have millions of papers published in medicine over the years, most of which give the

2:30:07.600 --> 2:30:14.400
 impression that medicine is useful. There's a small literature on randomized experiments of the

2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:21.840
 aggregate effects of medicine, where there's maybe a few half dozen or so papers, where it would be

2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:28.320
 the hardest to hide it because it's such a straightforward experiment done in a straightforward

2:30:28.320 --> 2:30:34.880
 way that it's hard to manipulate. And that's where I will point you to.

2:30:34.880 --> 2:30:39.200
 Manipulate. And that's where I will point you to, to show you that there's relatively

2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:43.840
 little correlation between health and medicine. But even then, people could try to save the

2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:47.040
 phenomenon and say, well, it's not hidden motives. It's just ignorance. They could say,

2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:52.240
 for example, you know, medicine's complicated. Most people don't know the literature.

2:30:53.200 --> 2:30:59.040
 Therefore, they can be excused for ignorance. They are just ignorantly assuming that medicine

2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:02.400
 is effective. It's not that they have some other motive that they're trying to achieve.

2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:07.200
 And then I will have to do, you know, as with a conspiracy theory analysis, I'm saying, well,

2:31:07.200 --> 2:31:12.320
 like, how long has this misperception been going on? How consistently has it happened

2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:18.000
 around the world and across time? And I would have to say, look, you know, if we're talking about,

2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:24.800
 say, a recent new product, like Segway scooters or something, I could say not so many people have

2:31:24.800 --> 2:31:28.400
 seen them or used them. Maybe they could be confused about their value. If we're talking

2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:32.800
 about a product that's been around for thousands of years, used in roughly the same way all across

2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:38.560
 the world, and we see the same pattern over and over again, this sort of ignorance mistake just

2:31:38.560 --> 2:31:47.040
 doesn't work so well. It also is a question of how much of the self deception is prevalent versus

2:31:47.040 --> 2:31:52.800
 foundational. Because there's a kind of implied thing where it's foundational to human nature

2:31:52.800 --> 2:32:01.520
 versus just a common pitfall. This is a question I have. So, like, maybe human progress is made by

2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:08.960
 people who don't fall into the self deception. It's a baser aspect of human nature, but then

2:32:08.960 --> 2:32:11.680
 you escape it easily if you're motivated.

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:17.920
 The motivational hypotheses about the self deceptions are in terms of how it makes you

2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:23.520
 look to the people around you. Again, the press secretary. So, the story would be, most people

2:32:23.520 --> 2:32:28.640
 want to look good to the people around them. Therefore, most people present themselves in ways

2:32:28.640 --> 2:32:35.040
 that help them look good to the people around them. That's sufficient to say there would be a

2:32:35.040 --> 2:32:40.160
 lot of it. It doesn't need to be 100%, right? There's enough variety in people and in

2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:44.960
 circumstances that sometimes taking a contrarian strategy can be in the interest of some minority

2:32:44.960 --> 2:32:51.600
 of the people. So, I might, for example, say that that's a strategy I've taken. I've decided that

2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:58.880
 being contrarian on these things could be winning for me in that there's a room for a small number

2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:04.640
 of people like me who have these sort of messages who can then get more attention, even if there's

2:33:04.640 --> 2:33:11.200
 not room for most people to do that. And that can be explaining sort of the variety, right?

2:33:11.200 --> 2:33:15.440
 Similarly, you might say, look, just look at the most obvious things. Most people would like to

2:33:15.440 --> 2:33:18.960
 look good, right? In the sense of physically, just you look good right now. You're wearing a nice

2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:23.600
 suit, you have a haircut, you shaved, right? So, and we cut my own hair by the way. Okay.

2:33:23.600 --> 2:33:29.120
 Well, that's all the more impressive. That's a counter argument for your claim.

2:33:29.120 --> 2:33:33.520
 So, clearly, if we look at most people and their physical appearance, clearly, most people are

2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:38.000
 trying to look somewhat nice, right? They shower, they shave, they comb their hair,

2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:42.240
 but we certainly see some people around who are not trying to look so nice, right? Is that a

2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:47.280
 big challenge, the hypothesis that people want to look nice? Not that much, right? We can see

2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:53.040
 in those particular people's context, more particular reasons why they've chosen to be

2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:54.640
 an exception to the more general rule.

2:33:55.600 --> 2:33:59.200
 So, the general rule does reveal something foundational generally.

2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:01.280
 Right.

2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:05.840
 That's the way things work. Let me ask you, you wrote a blog post about the general rule,

2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:10.480
 let me ask you, you wrote a blog post about the accuracy of authorities since we're talking

2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:17.840
 about this, especially in medicine. Just looking around us, especially during this time of the

2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:24.960
 pandemic, there's been a growing distrust of authorities, of institutions, even the institution

2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:33.920
 of science itself. What are the pros and cons of authorities, would you say? So, what's nice

2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:39.120
 about authorities? What's nice about institutions? And what are their pitfalls?

2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:45.760
 One standard function of authority is as something you can defer to, respectively,

2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:54.960
 without needing to seem too submissive or ignorant or, you know, gullible. That is,

2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:02.080
 you know, when you're asking what should I act on or what beliefs should I act on,

2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:07.920
 you might be worried if I chose something too contrarian, too weird, too speculative,

2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:12.640
 that that would make me look bad. So, I would just choose something very conservative.

2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:19.200
 So, maybe an authority lets you choose something a little less conservative because the authority

2:35:19.200 --> 2:35:23.840
 is your authorization. The authority will let you do it. And you can say, and somebody says,

2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:28.160
 why did you do that thing? And they say, the authority authorized it. The authority tells me,

2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:30.800
 I should do this. Why aren't you doing it, right?

2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:34.400
 So, the authority is often pushing for the conservative?

2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:38.240
 Well, no, the authority can do more. I mean, so for example, we just think about,

2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:43.200
 I don't know, in a pandemic even, right? You could just think, I'll just stay home and close

2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:46.320
 all the doors or I'll just ignore it, right? You could just think of just some very simple

2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.920
 strategy that might be defensible if there were no authorities, right? But authorities might be

2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:57.120
 able to know more than that. They might be able to like look at some evidence, draw a more context

2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:01.600
 dependent conclusion, declare it as the authority's opinion. And then other people might follow that

2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:06.960
 and that could be better than doing nothing. So, what you mentioned, WHO, the world's most

2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:16.720
 beloved organization. So, this is me speaking in general, WHO and CDC has been kind of,

2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:29.280
 I, depending on degrees and details, just not behaving as I would have imagined in the best

2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:34.320
 possible evolution of human civilization, authorities should act. They seem to have failed

2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:42.000
 in some fundamental way in terms of leadership in a difficult time for our society. Can you say what

2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:49.040
 are the pros and cons of this particular authority? So, again, if there were no authorities whatsoever,

2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:55.760
 no accepted authorities, then people would sort of have to sort of randomly pick different local

2:36:55.760 --> 2:36:59.280
 authorities who would conflict with each other. And then they'd be fighting each other about that,

2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:03.840
 or just not believe anybody and just do some initial default action that you would always do

2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:09.680
 without responding to context. So, the potential gain of an authority is that they could know more

2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:15.760
 than just basic ignorance. And if people followed them, they could both be more informed than

2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:20.240
 ignorance and all doing the same thing. So, they're each protected from being accused or

2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:26.640
 complained about. That's the idea of an authority. That would be the good. What's the con of that?

2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:32.880
 Okay. How does that go wrong? So, the con is that if you think of yourself as the authority and

2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:40.160
 asking what's my best strategy as an authority, it's unfortunately not to be maximally informative.

2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:45.040
 So, you might think the ideal authority would not just tell you more than ignorance, it would tell

2:37:45.040 --> 2:37:51.680
 you as much as possible. Okay. It would give you as much detail as you could possibly listen to and

2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:57.120
 manage to assimilate. And it would update that as frequently as possible or as frequently as you

2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:03.440
 were able to listen and assimilate. And that would be the maximally informative authority. The problem

2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:10.160
 is there's a conflict between being an authority or being seen as an authority and being maximally

2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:16.400
 informative. That was the point of my blog post that you're pointing out to here. That is, if you

2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:23.440
 look at it from their point of view, they won't long remain the perceived authority if they are

2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:31.200
 too cautious, incautious about how they use that authority. And one of the ways to be incautious

2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:37.440
 would be to be too informative. Okay. That's still in the pro column for me because you're talking

2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:43.760
 about the tensions that are very data driven and very honest. And I would hope that authorities

2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:52.880
 struggle with that. How much information to provide to people to maximize outcomes.

2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:57.040
 Now I'm generally somebody that believes more information is better because I trust the

2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:03.760
 intelligence of people. But I'd like to mention a bigger con on authorities, which is the human

2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:10.720
 question. This comes back to a global government and so on. Is that, you know, there's humans that

2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:16.080
 sit in chairs during meetings and those authorities, they have different titles. It's

2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:20.320
 for humans form hierarchies. And sometimes those titles get to your head a little bit

2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:26.480
 and you start to want to think, how do I preserve my control over this authority? As opposed to

2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:32.160
 thinking through like, what is the mission of the authority? What is the mission of WHO and

2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:37.680
 the other such organization? And how do I maximize the implementation of that mission? You start to

2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:43.120
 think, well, I kind of like sitting in this big chair at the head of the table. I'd like to sit

2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:48.960
 there for another few years or better yet, I want to be remembered as the person who in a time of

2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:57.360
 crisis was at the head of this authority and did a lot of good things. So you stop trying to do good

2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:03.760
 under what good means given the mission of the authority. And you start to try to carve a

2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:09.520
 narrative, to manipulate the narrative. First in the meeting room, everybody around you, just a

2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:15.520
 small little story you tell yourself, the new interns, the managers throughout the whole

2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:20.720
 hierarchy of the company. Okay, once everybody in the company or in the organization believes this

2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:28.160
 narrative, now you start to control the release of information, not because you're trying to

2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:33.680
 maximize outcomes, but because you're trying to maximize the effectiveness of the narrative that

2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:40.240
 you are truly a great representative of this authority in human history. And I just feel like

2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:47.920
 those human forces whenever you have an authority, it starts getting to people's heads. One of the

2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:52.480
 most, me as a scientist, one of the most disappointing things to see during the pandemic

2:40:53.440 --> 2:41:04.240
 is the use of authority from colleagues of mine to roll their eyes, to dismiss other human beings

2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:12.960
 just because they got a PhD, just because they're an assistant, associate, full faculty, just because

2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:20.640
 they are deputy head of X organization, NIH, whatever the heck the organization is,

2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:27.120
 just because they got an award of some kind and at a conference they won a best paper award seven

2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:32.560
 years ago and then somebody shook their hand and gave them a medal, maybe it was a president

2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:37.920
 and it's been 20, 30 years that people have been patting them on the back saying how special

2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:43.920
 they are, especially when they're controlling money and getting sucked up to from other scientists

2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:47.680
 who really want the money in a self deception kind of way, they don't actually really care

2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:52.560
 about your performance and all of that gets to your head and no longer are you the authority

2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:57.760
 that's trying to do good and lessen the suffering in the world, you become an authority that just

2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:06.800
 wants to maximize, self preserve yourself in a sitting on a throne of power. So this is core to

2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:12.480
 sort of what it is to be an economist. I'm a professor of economics. There you go with the

2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:19.840
 authority again. No, it's about saying, we often have a situation where we see a world of behavior

2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:26.160
 and then we see ways in which particular behaviors are not sort of maximally socially useful.

2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:28.000
 Yes.

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:34.160
 And we have a variety of reactions to that. So one kind of reaction is to sort of morally

2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:42.000
 blame each individual for not doing the maximally socially useful thing under perhaps the idea that

2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:46.720
 people could be identified and shamed for that and maybe induced into doing the better thing if

2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:52.560
 only enough people were calling them out on it, right? But another way to think about it is to

2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:58.400
 think that people sit in institutions with certain stable institutional structures and that

2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:03.600
 institutions create particular incentives for individuals and that individuals are typically

2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:08.720
 doing whatever is in their local interest in the context of that institution.

2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:15.840
 And then perhaps to less blame individuals for winning their local institutional game

2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:20.800
 and more blaming the world for having the wrong institutions. So economists are often like

2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:24.800
 wondering what other institutions we could have instead of the ones we have and which of them

2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:29.680
 might promote better behavior. And this is a common thing we do all across human behavior is

2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:33.920
 to think of what are the institutions we're in and what are the alternative variations we could

2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:40.320
 imagine and then to say which institutions would be most productive. I would agree with you that

2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:44.880
 our information institutions, that is the institutions by which we collect information

2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:51.200
 and aggregate it and share it with people are especially broken in the sense of far from the

2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:56.960
 ideal of what would be the most cost effective way to collect and share information. But then

2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:03.120
 the challenge is to try to produce better institutions. And as an academic, I'm aware that

2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:09.760
 academia is particularly broken in the sense that we give people incentives to do research that's

2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:15.120
 not very interesting or important because basically they're being impressive. And we actually care

2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:18.960
 more about whether academics are impressive than whether they're interesting or useful.

2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:25.920
 And I can go happy to go into detail with lots of different known institutions and their known

2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:31.040
 institutional failings, ways in which those institutions produce incentives that are

2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:34.800
 mistaken. And that was the point of the post we started with talking about the authorities. If

2:44:34.800 --> 2:44:42.160
 I need to be seen as an authority, that's at odds with my being informative and I might choose to be

2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:45.600
 the authority instead of being informative because that's my institutional incentives.

2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:54.320
 And if I may, I'd like to, given that beautiful picture of incentives and individuals that you

2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:03.440
 just painted, let me just apologize for a couple of things. One, I often put too much blame on

2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:11.280
 leaders of institutions versus the incentives that govern those institutions. And as a result of that,

2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:20.080
 I've been, I believe too critical of Anthony Fauci, too emotional about my criticism of

2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:26.080
 Anthony Fauci. And I'd like to apologize for that because I think there's a deep, there's deeper

2:45:26.080 --> 2:45:32.000
 truths to think about. There's deeper incentives to think about. That said, I do sort of, I'm a

2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:42.480
 romantic creature by nature. I romanticize Winston Churchill. When I think about Nazi Germany,

2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:47.120
 I think about Hitler more than I do about the individual people of Nazi Germany. You think

2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:51.760
 about leaders, you think about individuals, not necessarily the parameters, the incentives that

2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:58.240
 govern the system that, because it's harder. It's harder to think through deeply about the models

2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:04.240
 from which those individuals arise, but that's the right thing to do. So, but also I don't apologize

2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:07.680
 for being emotional sometimes and being.

2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:12.480
 I'm happy to blame the individual leaders in the sense that, you know, I might say, well,

2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:17.360
 you should be trying to reform these institutions if you're just there to like get promoted and look

2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:22.000
 good at being at the top. But maybe I can blame you for your motives and your priorities in there,

2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:26.000
 but I can understand why the people at the top would be the people who are selected for having

2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:29.200
 the priority of primarily trying to get to the top. I get that.

2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:36.880
 Can I maybe ask you about particular universities? They've received, like science has received an

2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:43.200
 increase in distrust overall as an institution, which breaks my heart because I think science is

2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:51.360
 beautiful as a, not maybe not as an institution, but as one of the things, one of the journeys that

2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:58.800
 humans have taken on. The other one is university. I think university is actually a place for me,

2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:06.800
 at least in the way I see it, is a place of freedom of exploring ideas, scientific ideas,

2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:15.600
 engineering ideas, more than corporate, more than a company, more than a lot of domains in life.

2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:22.400
 They're, it's not just in its ideal, but it's in its implementation, a place where you can

2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:28.960
 be a kid for your whole life and play with ideas. And I think with all the criticism that universities

2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:35.360
 still not currently receive, I think they, I don't think that criticism is representative

2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:39.760
 of universities. They focus on very anecdotal evidence of particular departments, particular

2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:48.880
 people, but I still feel like there's a lot of place for freedom of thought, at least MIT,

2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:56.560
 at least in the fields I care about, in a particular kind of science, a particular kind

2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:02.560
 of technical fields, mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, so robotics,

2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:10.320
 artificial intelligence. This is a place where you get to be a kid. Yet there is bureaucracy that's

2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:17.520
 rising up. There's like more rules. There's more meetings and there's more administration

2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:28.400
 having like PowerPoint presentations, which to me, you should like be more of a renegade

2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:34.800
 explorer of ideas and meetings destroy, they suffocate that radical thought that happens

2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:38.240
 when you're an undergraduate student and you can do all kinds of wild things when you're

2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:42.400
 a graduate student. Anyway, all that to say, you've thought about this aspect too. Is there

2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:50.160
 something positive, insightful you could say about how we can make for better universities

2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:54.800
 in the decades to come? This particular institution, how can we improve them?

2:48:54.800 --> 2:49:02.560
 I hear that centuries ago, many scientists and intellectuals were aristocrats. They had time

2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:12.000
 and could, if they chose, choose to be intellectuals. That's a feature of the combination

2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:17.680
 that they had some source of resources that allowed them leisure and that the kind of

2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:24.160
 competition they were faced in among aristocrats allowed that sort of a self indulgence or

2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:31.680
 self pursuit, at least at some point in their lives. So the analogous observation is that

2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:39.120
 university professors often have sort of the freedom and space to do a wide range of things.

2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:41.600
 And I am certainly enjoying that as a tenured professor.

2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:46.960
 You're a really, sorry to interrupt, a really good representative of that.

2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:52.880
 Just the exploration you're doing, the depth of thought, like most people are afraid to do the

2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:55.920
 kind of broad thinking that you're doing, which is great.

2:49:55.920 --> 2:50:01.120
 The fact that that can happen is a combination of these two things analogously. One is that

2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:05.040
 we have fierce competition to become a tenured professor, but then once you become tenured,

2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:11.360
 we give you the freedom to do what you like. And that's a happenstance. It didn't have to

2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:16.640
 be that way. And in many other walks of life, even though people have a lot of resources,

2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:20.480
 et cetera, they don't have that kind of freedom set up. So I think we're kind of,

2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:28.000
 I'm kind of lucky that tenure exists and that I'm enjoying it. But I can't be too enthusiastic

2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:31.760
 about this unless I can approve of sort of the source of the resources that's paying for all

2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:37.440
 this. So for the aristocrat, if you thought they stole it in war or something, you wouldn't be so

2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:41.920
 pleased. Whereas if you thought they had earned it or their ancestors had earned this money that

2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:47.120
 they were spending as an aristocrat, then you could be more okay with that. So for universities,

2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:52.240
 I have to ask, where are the main sources of resources that are going to the universities and

2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:56.720
 are they getting their money's worth? Are they getting a good value for that payment?

2:50:58.160 --> 2:51:03.840
 So first of all, they're students. And the question is, are students getting good value

2:51:03.840 --> 2:51:10.240
 for their education? And each person is getting value in the sense that they are identified and

2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:15.440
 shown to be a more capable person, which is then worth more salary as an employee later.

2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:21.200
 But there is a case for saying there's a big waste to the system because we aren't actually

2:51:21.200 --> 2:51:27.280
 changing the students or educating them. We're more sorting them or labeling them. And that's

2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:33.200
 a very expensive process to produce that outcome. And part of the expense is the freedom from tenure,

2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:38.720
 I guess. So I feel like I can't be too proud of that because it's basically a tax on all these

2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:43.440
 young students to pay this enormous amount of money in order to be labeled as better. Whereas I

2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:48.480
 feel like we should be able to find cheaper ways of doing that. The other main customer is

2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:54.160
 researcher patrons like the government or other foundations. And then the question is,

2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:58.480
 are they getting their money worth out of the money they're paying for research to happen?

2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:05.280
 And my analysis is they don't actually care about the research progress. They are mainly

2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:09.520
 buying an affiliation with credentialed impressiveness on the part of the researchers.

2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:13.840
 They mainly pay money to researchers who are impressive and have high, you know,

2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:17.920
 impressive affiliations. And they don't really much care what research project happens as a result.

2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:26.000
 Is that a cynical? So there's a deep truth to that cynical perspective. Is there

2:52:26.720 --> 2:52:32.640
 a less cynical perspective that they do care about the long term investment into the progress

2:52:32.640 --> 2:52:37.040
 of science and humanity? Well, they might personally care, but they're stuck in an equilibrium.

2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:38.160
 Sure.

2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:43.600
 Wherein they, basically most foundations like governments or research or, you know,

2:52:43.600 --> 2:52:50.000
 the Ford Foundation, they are, the individuals there are rated based on the prestige they bring

2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:54.800
 to that organization. And even if they might personally want to produce more intellectual

2:52:54.800 --> 2:53:00.160
 progress, they are in a competitive game where they don't have tenure and they need to produce

2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:04.880
 this prestige. And so once they give grant money to prestigious people, that is the thing that

2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:08.800
 shows that they have achieved prestige for the organization. And that's what they need to do in

2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:14.800
 order to retain their position. And you do hope that there's a correlation between prestige and

2:53:14.800 --> 2:53:19.760
 actual competence. Of course, there is a correlation. The question is just, could we do

2:53:19.760 --> 2:53:25.280
 this better some other way? I think it's almost, I think it's pretty clear we could. What is harder

2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:31.520
 to do is move the world to a new equilibrium where we do that instead. What are the components

2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:39.440
 of the better ways to do it? Is it money? So how, the sources of money and how the money is

2:53:39.440 --> 2:53:46.640
 allocated to give the individual researchers freedom? Years ago I started studying this topic

2:53:46.640 --> 2:53:51.680
 exactly because this was my issue and this was many decades ago now. And I spent a long time

2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:58.240
 and my best guess still is prediction markets, betting markets. So if you as a research

2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:02.800
 paper patron want to know the answer to a particular question, like what's the mass of

2:54:02.800 --> 2:54:08.480
 the electron neutrino, then what you can do is just subsidize a betting market in that question.

2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:13.440
 And that will induce more research into answering that question because the people who then

2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:17.120
 answer that question can then make money in that betting market with the new information they gain.

2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:22.960
 So that's a robust way to induce more information on a topic. If you want to induce an

2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:28.160
 accomplishment, you can create prizes. And there's of course a long history of prizes to induce

2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:35.040
 accomplishments. And we moved away from prizes, even though we once used them far more often than

2:54:35.040 --> 2:54:43.040
 we did today. And there's a history to that. And for the customers who want to be affiliated with

2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:48.320
 impressive academics, which is what most of the customers want, students, journalists, and patrons,

2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:53.440
 I think there's a better way of doing that, which I just wrote about in my second most recent blog

2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:59.920
 post. Can you explain? Sure. What we do today is we take sort of acceptance by other academics

2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:06.400
 recently as our best indication of their deserved prestige. That is recent publications, recent

2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:13.840
 job affiliation, institutional affiliations, recent invitations to speak, recent grants.

2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:21.440
 We are today taking other impressive academics, recent choices to affiliate with them as our best

2:55:21.440 --> 2:55:28.000
 guesstimate of their prestige. I would say we could do better by creating betting markets in what the

2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:34.000
 distant future will judge to have been their deserved prestige looking back on them. I think

2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:39.920
 most intellectuals, for example, think that if we looked back two centuries, say to intellectuals

2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:45.680
 from two centuries ago, and tried to look in detail at their research and how it influenced

2:55:45.680 --> 2:55:52.960
 future research and which path it was on, we could much more accurately judge their actual

2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:58.080
 deserved prestige. That is who was actually on the right track, who actually helped, which will be

2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:02.640
 different than what people at the time judged using the immediate indications at the time of

2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:07.440
 which position they had or which publications they had or things like that. So in this way,

2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:15.280
 if you think from the perspective of multiple centuries, you would higher prioritize true

2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:20.240
 novelty, you would disregard the temporal proximity, like how recent the thing is,

2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:27.600
 and you would think like, what is the brave, the bold, the big, a novel idea that this sense,

2:56:27.600 --> 2:56:31.520
 and you would actually, you would be able to rate that because you could see the path

2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:36.080
 with which ideas took, which things had dead ends, which led to what other followings. You could,

2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:41.680
 looking back centuries later, have a much better estimate of who actually had what long term

2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:47.200
 effects on intellectual progress. So my proposal is we actually pay people in several centuries to

2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:52.240
 do this historical analysis. And we have prediction markets today where we buy and sell

2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:58.000
 assets, which will later off pay off in terms of those final evaluations. So now we'll be inducing

2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:03.280
 people today to make their best estimate of those things by actually looking at the details of

2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:08.320
 people and setting the prices accordingly. So my proposal would be we rate people today on those

2:57:08.320 --> 2:57:12.640
 prices today. So instead of looking at their list of publications or affiliations, you look at the

2:57:12.640 --> 2:57:18.320
 actual price of assets that represent people's best guess of what the future will say about them.

2:57:18.320 --> 2:57:25.520
 That's brilliant. So this concept of idea futures, can you elaborate what this would entail?

2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:32.080
 I've been elaborating two versions of it here. So one is if there's a particular question,

2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:37.200
 say the mass of the electron neutrino, and what you as a patron want to do is get an answer to

2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:42.800
 that question, then what you would do is subsidize the betting market in that question under the

2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:46.160
 assumption that eventually we'll just know the answer and we can pay off the bets that way.

2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:51.760
 And that is a plausible assumption for many kinds of concrete intellectual questions like what's the

2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:56.480
 mass of the electron neutrino. In this hypothetical world that you're constructing that may be a real

2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:05.600
 world, do you mean literally financial? Yes. Literal. Very literal. Very cash. Very direct

2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:12.560
 and literal. Yes. Or crypto. Well, crypto is money. Yes, sure. So the idea would be research labs

2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:17.840
 would be for profit. They would have as their expense paying researchers to study things and

2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:22.080
 then their profit would come from using the insights the researchers gains to trade in these

2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:28.880
 financial markets. Just like hedge funds today make money by paying researchers to study firms

2:58:28.880 --> 2:58:33.440
 and then making their profits by trading on those that that insight in the ordinary financial market.

2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:39.760
 And the market would, if it's efficient, would be able to become better and better at predicting

2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:44.960
 the powerful ideas that the individual is able to generate. The variance around the mass of the

2:58:44.960 --> 2:58:49.360
 electron neutrino would decrease with time as we learned that value of that parameter better and

2:58:49.360 --> 2:58:53.760
 any other parameters that we wanted to estimate. You don't think those markets would also respond

2:58:53.760 --> 2:59:00.080
 to recency of prestige and all those kinds of things? They would respond, but the question is

2:59:00.080 --> 2:59:03.920
 if they might respond incorrectly, but if you think they're doing it incorrectly, you have a

2:59:03.920 --> 2:59:10.160
 profit opportunity where you can go fix it. So we'd be inviting everybody to ask whether they can

2:59:10.160 --> 2:59:14.000
 find any biases or errors in the current ways in which people are estimating these things from

2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:18.720
 whatever clues they have. Right. There's a big incentive for the correction mechanism in academia

2:59:18.720 --> 2:59:26.720
 currently. There's not, it's the safe choice to go with the prestige. Exactly. And there's no.

2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:33.280
 Even if you privately think that the prestige is over overrated. Even if you think strongly that

2:59:33.280 --> 2:59:37.840
 it's overrated. Still you don't have an incentive to defy that publicly. You're going to lose a lot

2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:44.640
 unless you're a contrarian that writes brilliant blogs and then you could talk about it in the

2:59:44.640 --> 2:59:49.200
 pocket. Right. I mean, initially this was my initial concept of having these betting markets

2:59:49.200 --> 2:59:53.600
 on these key parameters. And what I then realized over time was that that's more what people

2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:58.400
 pretend to care about. What they really mostly care about is just who's how good. And that's

2:59:58.400 --> 3:00:03.200
 what most of the system is built on is trying to rate people and rank them. And so I designed this

3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:08.480
 other alternative based on historical evaluation centuries later, just about who's how good,

3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:10.720
 because that's what I think most of the customers really care about.

3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:16.400
 Customers. I like the word customers here. Humans. Right. Well, every major area of life,

3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:20.480
 which, you know, has specialists who get paid to do that thing must have some customers from

3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:25.280
 elsewhere who are paying for it. Well, who are the customers for the mass of the neutrino?

3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:33.440
 Yes. I, I, I understand that a sense people who are willing to pay. Right. For a thing.

3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:36.960
 That's an important thing to understand about anything. Who are the customers? So when I think

3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:42.960
 and what's the product, like medicine, education, academia, military, et cetera, that's part of the

3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:46.720
 hidden motives analysis. Often people have a thing they say about what the product is and who the

3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:50.800
 customer is. And maybe you need to dig a little deeper to find out what's really going on.

3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:59.520
 Or a lot deeper. You, uh, you've written that you seek out quote view quakes. You're able as a,

3:00:59.520 --> 3:01:03.680
 uh, as an intelligent black box word generating machine, you're able to generate a lot of sexy

3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:10.720
 words. I like it. I love it. View quakes, which are insights, which dramatically changed my

3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:17.840
 worldview, your worldview. Uh, you write, I loved science fiction as a child studied physics and

3:01:17.840 --> 3:01:23.520
 artificial intelligence for a long time each, and now study economics and political science,

3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:30.960
 all fields full of such insights. So let me ask, what are some view quakes or a beautiful,

3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:36.800
 surprising idea to you from each of those fields, physics, AI, economics, political science?

3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:40.960
 I know it's a tough question. Something that springs to mind about physics, for example,

3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:45.600
 that just as beautiful. I mean, right from the beginning, say special relativity was a big

3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:51.120
 surprise. Uh, you know, most of us have a simple concept of time and it seems perfectly adequate

3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:55.600
 for everything we've ever seen. And to have it explained to you that you need to sort of have a

3:01:55.600 --> 3:02:00.880
 mixture concept of time and space where you put it into the space time construct, how it looks

3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:06.480
 different from different perspectives. That was quite a shock. And that was, you know, such a

3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:11.920
 shock that it makes you think, what else do I know that, you know, isn't the way it seems. Certainly

3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:16.480
 quantum mechanics is certainly another enormous shock in terms of from your point, you know,

3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:21.440
 you have this idea that there's a space and then there's, you know, point particles at points and

3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:28.240
 maybe fields in between. And, um, quantum mechanics is just a whole different representation. It looks

3:02:28.240 --> 3:02:32.880
 nothing like what you would have thought as sort of the basic representation of the physical world.

3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:39.120
 And that was quite a surprise. What would you say is the catalyst for the, for the view quake in

3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:43.040
 theoretical physics in the 20th century? Where does that come from? So the interesting thing

3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:47.520
 about Einstein, it seems like a lot of that came from like almost thought experiments. It wasn't

3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:55.520
 almost experimentally driven. Um, and with, actually, I don't know the full story of quantum

3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:01.360
 mechanics, how much of it is experiment, like where, if you, if you look at the full trace of

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:07.040
 idea generation there, uh, of all the weird stuff that falls out of quantum mechanics, how much of

3:03:07.040 --> 3:03:11.520
 that was the experimentalist? How much was it the theoreticians? But usually in theoretical

3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:18.720
 physics, the theories lead the way. So maybe can you, uh, can you elucidate like what, what is the

3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:24.800
 catalyst for these? The remarkable thing about physics and about many other areas of academic

3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:31.360
 intellectual life is that it just seems way overdetermined. That is, if it hadn't been for

3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:36.640
 Einstein or if it hadn't been for Heisenberg, certainly within a half a century, somebody else

3:03:36.640 --> 3:03:41.520
 would have come up with essentially the same things. Is that something you believe or is that

3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:46.160
 something? Yes. So I think when you look at sort of just the history of physics and the history of

3:03:46.160 --> 3:03:51.040
 other areas, you know, some areas like that, there's just this enormous convergence that the,

3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:56.400
 the different kinds of evidence that was being collected was so redundant in the sense that so

3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:02.320
 many different things revealed the same things that eventually you just kind of have to accept it

3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:08.720
 because it just gets obvious. So if you look at the details, of course, you know, Einstein did it

3:04:08.720 --> 3:04:13.920
 for somebody else and it's well worth celebrating Einstein for that. And, you know, we, by

3:04:13.920 --> 3:04:17.840
 celebrating the particular people who did something first or came across something first,

3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:25.360
 we are encouraging all the rest to move a little faster, to try to, to push us all a little faster,

3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:32.080
 which is great. But I still think we would have gotten roughly to the same place within a half

3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:37.760
 century. So sometimes people are special because of how much longer it would have taken. So some

3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:42.000
 people say general relativity would have taken longer without Einstein than other things. I mean,

3:04:42.720 --> 3:04:46.080
 Heisenberg quantum mechanics, I mean, there were several different formulations of quantum mechanics

3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:51.280
 all around the same few years, means no one of them made that much of a difference. We would have

3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:56.800
 had pretty much the same thing regardless of which of them did it exactly when. Nevertheless,

3:04:56.800 --> 3:05:00.960
 I'm happy to celebrate them all. But this is a choice I make in my research. That is, when there's

3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:05.680
 an area where there's lots of people working together, you know, who are sort of scoping each

3:05:05.680 --> 3:05:10.080
 other and getting a result just before somebody else does, you ask, well, how much of a difference

3:05:10.080 --> 3:05:16.400
 would I make there? At most, I could make something happen a few months before somebody else. And so

3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:21.200
 I'm less worried about them missing things. So when I'm trying to help the world, like doing research,

3:05:21.200 --> 3:05:25.040
 I'm looking for neglected things. I'm looking for things that nobody's doing it. If I didn't do it,

3:05:25.040 --> 3:05:28.800
 nobody would do it. Nobody would do it. Or at least for a long time. In the next 10, 20 years,

3:05:28.800 --> 3:05:32.640
 kind of thing. Right, exactly. Same with general relativity, just, you know, who would do it?

3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:36.960
 It might take another 10, 20, 30, 50 years. So that's the place where you can have the

3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:40.560
 biggest impact is finding the things that nobody would do unless you did them.

3:05:40.560 --> 3:05:45.200
 And then that's when you get the big view quake, the insight. So what about artificial

3:05:45.200 --> 3:05:56.480
 intelligence? Would it be the EMs, the emulated minds? What idea, whether that struck you in the

3:05:56.480 --> 3:06:00.480
 shower one day or that you just...

3:06:00.480 --> 3:06:05.920
 Clearly, the biggest view quake in artificial intelligence is the realization of just how

3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:11.600
 complicated our human minds are. So most people who come to artificial intelligence from other

3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:17.200
 fields or from relative ignorance, a very common phenomenon, which you must be familiar with,

3:06:17.200 --> 3:06:22.560
 is that they come up with some concept and then they think that must be it. Once we implement this

3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:27.200
 new concept, we will have it. We will have full human level or higher artificial intelligence,

3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:32.080
 right? And they're just not appreciating just how big the problem is, how long the road is,

3:06:32.080 --> 3:06:36.800
 just how much is involved, because that's actually hard to appreciate. When we just think,

3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:41.760
 it seems really simple. And studying artificial intelligence, going through many particular

3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:45.200
 problems, looking at each problem, all the different things you need to be able to do

3:06:45.200 --> 3:06:50.240
 to solve a problem like that, makes you realize all the things your minds are doing that you

3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:55.120
 are not aware of. That's that vast subconscious that you're not aware of. That's the biggest

3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:59.360
 view quake from artificial intelligence by far for most people who study artificial intelligence,

3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:07.200
 is to see just how hard it is. I think that's a good point. But I think it's a very early

3:07:07.200 --> 3:07:16.880
 view quake. It's when the Dunning Kruger crashes hard. It's the first realization that humans are

3:07:16.880 --> 3:07:20.800
 actually quite incredible. The human mind, the human body is quite incredible. There's a lot

3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:27.680
 of different parts to it. But then, see, it's already been so long for me to think about

3:07:27.680 --> 3:07:32.160
 it. It's already been so long for me that I've experienced that view quake that, for me,

3:07:32.160 --> 3:07:37.280
 I now experience the view quakes of, holy shit, this little thing is actually quite powerful,

3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:45.360
 like neural networks. I'm amazed. Because you've become almost cynical after that first view quake

3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:52.080
 of, like, this is so hard. Like, evolution did some incredible work to create the human mind.

3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:57.120
 But then you realize, just like you have, you've talked about a bunch of simple models

3:07:57.120 --> 3:08:04.320
 that simple things can actually be extremely powerful, that maybe emulating the human mind

3:08:04.320 --> 3:08:09.840
 is extremely difficult. But you can go a long way with a large neural network. You can go a long way

3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:15.040
 with a dumb solution. It's that Stuart Russell thing with the reinforcement learning. Holy crap,

3:08:15.040 --> 3:08:18.960
 you can go quite a long way with a simple thing. But we still have a very long road to go,

3:08:18.960 --> 3:08:29.040
 but not unless... I can't, I refuse to sort of know. The road is full of surprises. So long is

3:08:29.040 --> 3:08:34.800
 an interesting, like you said, with the six hard steps that humans have to take to arrive at where

3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:42.000
 we are from the origin of life on Earth. So it's long, maybe, in the statistical improbability of

3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:47.200
 the steps that have to be taken. But in terms of how quickly those steps could be taken,

3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:55.520
 I don't know if my intuition says it's, if it's hundreds of years away or if it's a couple of

3:08:55.520 --> 3:09:00.560
 years away, I prefer to measure... Pretty confidence, at least a decade. And

3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:05.360
 mildly confidence, at least three decades. I can steal man either direction. I prefer to

3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:10.240
 measure that journey in Elon Musk's. That's a new... Well, we don't get Elon Musk very often,

3:09:10.240 --> 3:09:16.160
 so that's a long timescale. For now, I don't know, maybe you can clone or maybe multiply or

3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:21.120
 even know what Elon Musk, what that is. What is that? What is... That's a good question.

3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:26.160
 Exactly. Well, that's an excellent question. How does that fit into the model of the three

3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:33.920
 parameters that are required for becoming a grabby alien civilization? That's the question of how

3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:39.680
 much any individual makes in the long path of civilization over time. Yes. And it's a favorite

3:09:39.680 --> 3:09:44.320
 topic of historians and people to try to focus on individuals and how much of a difference they

3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:48.400
 make. And certainly, some individuals make a substantial difference in the modest term,

3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:55.600
 right? Like, you know, without Hitler being Hitler in the role he took, European history would

3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:00.400
 have taken a different path for a while there. But if we're looking over like many centuries

3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:04.800
 longer term things, most individuals do fade in their individual influence.

3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:13.040
 So, I mean... Even Einstein. Even Einstein, no matter how sexy your hair is, you will also be

3:10:13.040 --> 3:10:19.600
 forgotten in the long arc of history. So you said at least 10 years. So let's talk a little bit about

3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:28.800
 this AI point of where, how we achieve, how hard is the problem of solving intelligence

3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:35.280
 is the problem of solving intelligence by engineering artificial intelligence

3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:41.600
 that achieves human level, human like qualities that we associate with intelligence. How hard

3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:46.480
 is this? What are the different trajectories that take us there? One way to think about it

3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:52.560
 is in terms of the scope of the technology space you're talking about. So let's take the biggest

3:10:52.560 --> 3:11:00.080
 possible scope, all of human technology, right? The entire human economy. So the entire economy

3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:04.880
 is composed of many industries, each of which have many products with many different technologies

3:11:04.880 --> 3:11:13.440
 supporting each one. At that scale, I think we can accept that most innovations are a small

3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:20.240
 fraction of the total. That is usually have relatively gradual overall progress. And that

3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:25.920
 individual innovations that have a substantial effect that total are rare and their total effect

3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:30.880
 is still a small percentage of the total economy. There's very few individual innovations that

3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:35.920
 made a substantial difference to the whole economy. What are we talking? Steam engine,

3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:42.400
 shipping containers, a few things. Shipping containers deserves to be up there with steam

3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:48.320
 engines, honestly. Can you say exactly why shipping containers... Shipping containers

3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:54.640
 revolutionized shipping. Shipping is very important. But placing that at shipping containers.

3:11:55.280 --> 3:11:59.040
 So you're saying you wouldn't have some of the magic of the supply chain, all that,

3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:02.960
 without shipping containers. That made a big difference, absolutely. Interesting. That's

3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:08.480
 something to look into. We shouldn't take that tangent, although I'm tempted to. But anyway,

3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:13.360
 so there's a few, just a few innovations. Right. So at the scale of the whole economy, right?

3:12:13.360 --> 3:12:19.360
 Right. Now, as you move down to a much smaller scale, you will see individual innovations

3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:23.760
 having a bigger effect, right? So if you look at, I don't know, lawnmowers or something,

3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:28.320
 I don't know about the innovations lawnmower, but there were probably like steps where you

3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:34.240
 just had a new kind of lawnmower and that made a big difference to mowing lawns because you're

3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:41.840
 focusing on a smaller part of the whole technology space, right? And sometimes like military

3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:45.200
 technology, there's a lot of military technologies, a lot of small ones, but every once in a while,

3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:51.200
 a particular military weapon like makes a big difference. But still, even so, mostly overall,

3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:56.880
 they're making modest differences to something that's increasing relatively soon. Like US military

3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:02.080
 is the strongest in the world consistently for a while. No one weapon in the last 70 years has

3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:07.440
 made a big difference in terms of the overall prominence of the US military, right? Because

3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:12.160
 that's just saying, even though every once in a while, even the recent Soviet hyper missiles or

3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:16.720
 whatever they are, they aren't changing the overall balance dramatically, right?

3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:25.840
 So when we get to AI, now I can frame the question, how big is AI? Basically, so one way of

3:13:25.840 --> 3:13:30.560
 thinking about AI is it's just all mental tasks. And then you ask what fraction of tasks are mental

3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:38.960
 tasks? And then I go, a lot. And then if I think of AI as like half of everything, then I think,

3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:44.000
 well, it's got to be composed of lots of parts where any one innovation is only a small impact,

3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:52.560
 right? Now, if you think, no, no, no, AI is like AGI. And then you think AGI is a small thing,

3:13:52.560 --> 3:13:57.680
 right? There's only a small number of key innovations that will enable it. Now you're

3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:03.040
 thinking there could be a bigger chunk that you might find that would have a bigger impact. So

3:14:03.040 --> 3:14:08.320
 the way I would ask you to frame these things in terms of the chunkiness of different areas of

3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:13.920
 technology, in part, in terms of how big they are. If you take 10 chunky areas and you add them

3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:19.760
 together, the total is less chunky. Yeah. But don't you, are you able until you solve

3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.320
 the fundamental core parts of the problem to estimate the chunkiness of that problem?

3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:29.920
 Well, if you have a history of prior chunkiness, that could be your best estimate for future

3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:34.800
 chunkiness. So for example, I mean, even at the level of the world economy, right? We've had this,

3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:40.720
 what, 10,000 years of civilization. Well, that's only a short time. You might say, oh, that doesn't

3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:47.760
 predict future chunkiness. But it looks relatively steady and consistent. We can say even in computer

3:14:47.760 --> 3:14:52.480
 science, we've had 70 years of computer science. We have enough data to look at chunkiness of

3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:58.960
 computer science. Like when were there algorithms or approaches that made a big chunky difference

3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:05.680
 and how large a fraction of that was that? And I'd say mostly in computer science,

3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:09.280
 most innovation has been relatively small chunks. The bigger chunks have been rare.

3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:14.640
 Well, this is the interesting thing. This is about AI and just algorithms in general is

3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:27.360
 page rank. So Google's, right? So sometimes it's a simple algorithm that by itself is not that useful,

3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:33.840
 but the scale of context and in a context that's scalable, depending on the context,

3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:38.960
 all of a sudden the power is revealed. And there's something, I guess that's the nature of chunkiness

3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:45.840
 is that things that can reach a lot of people simply can be quite chunky.

3:15:45.840 --> 3:15:53.120
 So one standard story about algorithms is to say algorithms have a fixed cost plus a marginal cost.

3:15:53.680 --> 3:15:58.720
 And so in history, when you had computers that were very small, you tried all the algorithms

3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:04.160
 that had low fixed costs and you look for the best of those. But over time, as computers got bigger,

3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:09.360
 you could afford to do larger fixed costs and try those. And some of those had more effective

3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:15.040
 algorithms in terms of their marginal cost. And that, in fact, that roughly explains the

3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:19.040
 longterm history where in fact, the rate of algorithmic improvement is about the same as

3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:25.280
 the rate of hardware improvement, which is a remarkable coincidence. But it would be explained

3:16:25.280 --> 3:16:30.480
 by saying, well, there's all these better algorithms you can't try until you have a big enough computer

3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:35.360
 to pay the fixed cost of doing some trials to find out if that algorithm actually saves you

3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:41.600
 on the marginal cost. And so that's an explanation for this relatively continuous history. So we have

3:16:41.600 --> 3:16:45.520
 a good story about why hardware is so continuous. And you might think, why would software be so

3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:50.320
 continuous with the hardware? But if there's a distribution of algorithms in terms of their fixed

3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:55.840
 costs, and it's, say, spread out at a wide log normal distribution, then we could be sort of

3:16:55.840 --> 3:17:00.560
 marching through that log normal distribution, trying out algorithms with larger fixed costs and

3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:02.880
 finding the ones that have lower marginal costs.

3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:18.480
 So would you say AGI, human level, AI, even EM, M, emulated minds, is chunky? Like a few

3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:19.680
 breakthroughs can take us.

3:17:19.680 --> 3:17:25.280
 So an M is by its nature chunky in the sense that if you have an emulated brain and you're

3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:32.800
 25% effective at emulating it, that's crap. That's nothing. Okay. You pretty much need to

3:17:32.800 --> 3:17:34.240
 emulate a full human brain.

3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:36.320
 Is that obvious? Is that obvious?

3:17:36.320 --> 3:17:41.680
 It's pretty obvious. I'm talking about like, you know, so the key thing is you're emulating

3:17:41.680 --> 3:17:46.400
 various brain cells. And so you have to emulate the input output pattern of those cells. So if

3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:51.600
 you get that pattern somewhat close, but not close enough, then the whole system just doesn't have

3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:53.280
 the overall behavior you're looking for, right?

3:17:53.280 --> 3:17:57.200
 But it could have functionally some of the power of the overall system.

3:17:57.200 --> 3:18:00.800
 So there'll be some threshold. The point is when you get close enough, then it goes over the

3:18:00.800 --> 3:18:05.920
 threshold, right? It's like taking a computer chip and deleting every 1% of the gates, right?

3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:12.400
 No, that's very chunky. But the hope is that emulating the human brain, I mean, the human

3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:13.440
 brain itself is not...

3:18:13.440 --> 3:18:17.280
 Right. So it has a certain level of redundancy and a certain level of robustness. And so there's

3:18:17.280 --> 3:18:20.640
 some threshold when you get close to that level of redundancy or robustness, then it starts to

3:18:20.640 --> 3:18:25.520
 work. But until you get to that level, it's just going to be crap, right? It's going to be just a

3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:32.320
 big thing that isn't working for us. So we can be pretty sure that emulations is a big chunk in an

3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:37.520
 economic sense, right? At some point, you'll be able to make one that's actually effective in

3:18:37.520 --> 3:18:42.560
 enable substituting for humans. And then that will be this huge economic product that people will

3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:43.520
 try to buy like crazy.

3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:47.360
 You'll bring a lot of value to people's lives, so they'll be willing to pay for it.

3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:53.360
 Right. But it could be that the first emulation costs a billion dollars each, right? And then we

3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:56.400
 have them, but we can't really use them. They're too expensive. And then the cost slowly comes

3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:03.680
 down. And now we have less of a chunky adoption, right? That as the cost comes down, then we use

3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:10.160
 more and more of them in more and more contexts. And that's a more continuous curve. So it's only

3:19:10.160 --> 3:19:15.760
 if the first emulations are relatively cheap that you get a more sudden disruption to society.

3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:19.360
 And that could happen if sort of the algorithm is the last thing you figure out how to do or

3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:19.840
 something.

3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:28.160
 What about robots that capture some magic in terms of social connection? The robots, like we have a

3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:35.280
 robot dog on the carpet right there. Robots that are able to capture some magic of human connection

3:19:36.160 --> 3:19:42.560
 as they interact with humans, but are not emulating the brain. What about those? How far away?

3:19:42.560 --> 3:19:48.320
 So we're thinking about chunkiness or distance now. So if you ask how chunky is the task of making

3:19:48.320 --> 3:19:55.760
 a, you know, emulatable robot or something, which chunkiness and time are correlated.

3:19:55.760 --> 3:20:01.680
 Right. But it's about how far away it is or how suddenly it would happen. Chunkiness is how

3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:07.360
 suddenly and difficulty is just how far away it is. But it could be a continuous difficulty. It

3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:14.720
 would just be far away, but we'll slowly steadily get there. Or there could be these thresholds where

3:20:14.720 --> 3:20:17.040
 we reach a threshold and suddenly we can do a lot better.

3:20:17.040 --> 3:20:24.400
 Yeah. That's a good question for both. I tend to believe that all of it, not just the M, but AGI

3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:31.920
 too is chunky and human level intelligence embodied in robots is also chunky.

3:20:31.920 --> 3:20:36.720
 The history of computer science and chunkiness so far seems to be my rough best guess for the

3:20:36.720 --> 3:20:39.440
 penis of AGI. That is, it is chunky.

3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:42.560
 It's modestly chunky, not that chunky. Right.

3:20:43.920 --> 3:20:48.560
 Our ability to use computers to do many things in the economy has been moving relatively steadily.

3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:51.200
 Overall, in terms of our use of computers in society,

3:20:52.480 --> 3:20:55.680
 they have been relatively steadily improving for 70 years.

3:20:55.680 --> 3:21:00.400
 No, but I would say that's hard. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I would have to really think about that

3:21:00.400 --> 3:21:03.200
 because neural networks are quite surprising.

3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:07.120
 Sure. But every once in a while we have a new thing that's surprising. But if you stand back,

3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:12.800
 you know, we see something like that every 10 years or so, some new innovation that has a big effect.

3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:19.040
 So, moderately chunky. Yeah.

3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:22.240
 But the history of the level of disruption we've seen in the past would be a rough

3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:25.280
 estimate of the level of disruption in the future. Unless the future is,

3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:28.720
 we're going to hit a chunky territory, much chunkier than we've seen in the past.

3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:35.120
 Well, I do think there's, it's like, like Kuhnian, like revolution type.

3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:46.560
 It seems like the data, especially on AI, is difficult to reason with because it's so recent,

3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:49.760
 it's such a recent field. Wow, AI's been around for 50 years.

3:21:50.560 --> 3:21:53.920
 I mean, 50, 60, 70, 80 years being recent. Okay.

3:21:53.920 --> 3:21:57.520
 It's enough time to see a lot of trends.

3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:06.640
 A few trends, a few trends. I think the internet, computing, there's really a lot of interesting

3:22:06.640 --> 3:22:13.760
 stuff that's happened over the past 30 years that I think the possibility of revolutions

3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:17.840
 is likelier than it was in the... I think for the last 70 years,

3:22:17.840 --> 3:22:21.120
 there have always been a lot of things that look like they had a potential for revolution.

3:22:21.120 --> 3:22:25.200
 So we can't reason well about this. I mean, we can reason well by looking

3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:28.880
 at the past trends. I would say the past trend is roughly your best guess for the future.

3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:35.280
 No, but if I look back at the things that might've looked like revolutions in the 70s and 80s and 90s,

3:22:37.280 --> 3:22:43.840
 they are less like the revolutions that appear to be happening now, or the capacity of revolution

3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:49.520
 that appear to be there now. First of all, there's a lot more money to be made. So there's a lot more

3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:53.840
 incentive for markets to do a lot of kind of innovation, it seems like in the AI space.

3:22:54.640 --> 3:22:58.560
 But then again, there's a history of winters and summers and so on.

3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:00.960
 So maybe we're just like riding a nice wave right now.

3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:05.760
 One of the biggest issues is the difference between impressive demos and commercial value.

3:23:05.760 --> 3:23:06.480
 Yes.

3:23:06.480 --> 3:23:10.160
 So we often through the history of AI, we saw very impressive demos

3:23:10.160 --> 3:23:12.880
 that never really translated much into commercial value.

3:23:12.880 --> 3:23:17.120
 Somebody who works on and cares about autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles,

3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:24.000
 tell me about it. And there again, we return to the number of Elon Musk's per earth per year

3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:30.080
 generated. That's the M. Coincidentally, same initials as the M.

3:23:31.440 --> 3:23:36.880
 Very suspicious, very suspicious. We're going to have to look into that. All right. Two more fields

3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:43.040
 that I would like to force and twist your arm to look for view quakes and for beautiful ideas,

3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:53.120
 economics. What is a beautiful idea to you about economics? You mentioned a lot of them.

3:23:53.120 --> 3:23:58.640
 Sure. So as you said before, there's going to be the first view cake most people encounter that

3:23:58.640 --> 3:24:02.880
 makes the biggest difference on average in the world, because that's the only thing most people

3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:10.800
 ever see is the first one. And so with AI, the first one is just how big the problem is. But

3:24:10.800 --> 3:24:15.280
 once you get past that, you'll find others. Certainly for economics, the first one is just

3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:22.640
 the power of markets. You might have thought it was just really hard to figure out how to optimize

3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:29.040
 in a big, complicated space. And markets just do a good first pass for an awful lot of stuff.

3:24:29.040 --> 3:24:35.520
 And they are really quite robust and powerful. And that's just quite the view quake, where you just

3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:43.440
 say, if you want to get in the ballpark, just let a market handle it and step back. And that's true

3:24:43.440 --> 3:24:48.640
 for a wide range of things. It's not true for everything, but it's a very good first approximation.

3:24:48.640 --> 3:24:52.560
 Most people's intuitions for how they should limit markets are actually messing them up.

3:24:53.680 --> 3:24:57.440
 They're that good in sense. Most people, when you go, I don't know if we want to trust that.

3:24:57.440 --> 3:25:07.280
 Well, you should be trusting that. What are markets? Just a couple of words. So the idea

3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:12.480
 is if people want something, then let other companies form to try to supply that thing.

3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:16.960
 Let those people pay for their cost of whatever they're making and try to offer that product

3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:22.320
 to those people. Let many such firms enter that industry and let the customers decide

3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:26.320
 which ones they want. And if the firm goes out of business, let it go bankrupt and let other

3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:30.480
 people invest in whichever ventures they want to try to attract customers to their version

3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:34.320
 of the product. And that just works for a wide range of products and services.

3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:37.120
 And through all of this, there's a free exchange of information too.

3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:41.040
 There's a hope that there's no manipulation of information and so on.

3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:48.000
 Even when those things happen, still just the simple market solution is usually better

3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:49.680
 than the things you'll try to do to fix it.

3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:50.560
 Than the alternative.

3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:55.040
 That's a view, Craig. It's surprising. It's not what you would have initially thought.

3:25:55.040 --> 3:26:00.800
 That's one of the great, I guess, inventions of human civilization that trust the markets.

3:26:02.240 --> 3:26:05.840
 Now, another view, Craig, that I learned in my research that's not all of economics,

3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:11.040
 but something more specialized is the rationality of disagreement. That is,

3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:16.320
 basically people who are trying to believe what's true in a complicated situation would not actually

3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:22.080
 disagree. And of course, humans disagree all the time. So it was quite the striking fact for me to

3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:28.960
 learn in grad school that actually rational agents would not knowingly disagree. And so that makes

3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:32.960
 disagreement more puzzling and it makes you less willing to disagree.

3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:39.520
 Humans are, to some degree, rational and are able to...

3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:43.840
 Their priorities are different than just figuring out the truth.

3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:45.840
 Are different than just figuring out the truth.

3:26:48.720 --> 3:26:50.640
 Which might not be the same as being irrational.

3:26:52.160 --> 3:26:54.320
 That's another tangent that could take an hour.

3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:03.200
 In the space of human affairs, political science, what is a beautiful, foundational,

3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:08.160
 interesting idea to you, a view, Craig, in the space of political science?

3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:17.520
 It's the main thing that goes wrong in politics is people not agreeing on what the best thing to do is.

3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:20.560
 That's a wrong thing.

3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:24.160
 So that's what goes wrong. That is where you say, what's fundamentally behind most

3:27:24.160 --> 3:27:29.520
 political failures? It's that people are ignorant of what the consequences of policy is.

3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:34.560
 And that's surprising because it's actually feasible to solve that problem,

3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:35.680
 which we aren't solving.

3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:42.320
 So it's a bug, not a feature that there's an inability to arrive at a consensus.

3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:47.840
 So most political systems, if everybody looked to some authority, say, on a question and that

3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:51.920
 authority told them the answer, then most political systems are capable of just doing that thing.

3:27:55.200 --> 3:27:59.040
 That is. And so it's the failure to have trustworthy authorities

3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:04.400
 that is sort of the underlying failure behind most political failure.

3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:09.760
 We invade Iraq, say, when we don't have an authority to tell us that's a really stupid

3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:17.920
 thing to do. And it is possible to create more informative trustworthy authorities.

3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:23.600
 That's a remarkable fact about the world of institutions that we could do that, but we aren't.

3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:28.000
 Yeah, that's surprising. We could and we aren't.

3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:31.920
 Right. Another big view, Craig, about politics is from the elephant in the brain that most people,

3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:35.760
 when they're interacting with politics, they say they want to make the world better,

3:28:35.760 --> 3:28:38.560
 they make their city better, their country better, and that's not their priority.

3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:40.240
 What is it?

3:28:40.240 --> 3:28:44.560
 They want to show loyalty to their allies. They want to show their people they're on their side,

3:28:44.560 --> 3:28:50.800
 yes. Or their various tribes they're in, that's their primary priority and they do accomplish that.

3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:55.120
 Yeah. And the tribes are usually color coded, conveniently enough.

3:28:55.120 --> 3:29:01.280
 What would you say, you know, it's the Churchill question. Democracy is the crappiest form of

3:29:01.280 --> 3:29:08.560
 government, but it's the best one we got. What's the best form of government for this, our 7 billion

3:29:08.560 --> 3:29:14.960
 human civilization and the maybe as we get farther and further. You mentioned a lot of stuff

3:29:14.960 --> 3:29:21.200
 that's fascinating about human history as we become more forager like and looking out beyond

3:29:21.200 --> 3:29:26.080
 what's the best form of government in the next 50, 100 years as we become a multi planetary species.

3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:33.840
 So, the key failing is that we have existing political institutions and related institutions

3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:39.600
 like media institutions and other authority institutions, and these institutions sit in

3:29:39.600 --> 3:29:44.080
 a vast space of possible institutions. And the key failing, we're just not exploring that space.

3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:50.400
 And the key failing, we're just not exploring that space. So, I have made my proposals in that space,

3:29:50.400 --> 3:29:54.880
 and I think I can identify many promising solutions. And many other people have made many

3:29:54.880 --> 3:29:59.040
 other promising proposals in that space. But the key thing is we're just not pursuing those

3:29:59.040 --> 3:30:04.080
 proposals. We're not trying them out on small scales, we're not doing tests, we're not exploring

3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:10.320
 the space of these options. That is the key thing we're failing to do. And if we did that, I am

3:30:10.320 --> 3:30:14.800
 confident we would find much better institutions than one we're using now, but we would have to

3:30:14.800 --> 3:30:23.040
 actually try. So, a lot of those topics, I do hope we get a chance to talk again. You're a fascinating

3:30:23.040 --> 3:30:28.400
 human being. So, I'm skipping a lot of tangents on purpose that I would love to take. You're such a

3:30:28.400 --> 3:30:40.640
 brilliant person on so many different topics. Let me take a stroll into the deep human psyche of

3:30:40.640 --> 3:30:44.400
 Robin Hansen himself. So, first... May not be that deep.

3:30:48.320 --> 3:30:51.760
 I might just be all on the surface. What you see is what you get. There might not be much hiding

3:30:51.760 --> 3:30:58.960
 behind it. Some of the fun is on the surface. I actually think this is true of many of the most

3:30:58.960 --> 3:31:04.640
 successful, most interesting people you see in the world. That is, they have put so much effort

3:31:04.640 --> 3:31:10.160
 into the surface that they've constructed. And that's where they put all their energy. Somebody

3:31:10.160 --> 3:31:14.640
 might be a statesman or an actor or something else, and people want to interview them and they

3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:18.800
 want to say, what are you behind the scenes? What do you do in your free time? Those people don't

3:31:18.800 --> 3:31:23.200
 have free time. They don't have another life behind the scenes. They put all their energy into

3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:28.560
 that surface, the one we admire, the one we're fascinated by. And they kind of have to make up

3:31:28.560 --> 3:31:33.520
 the stuff behind the scenes to supply it for you, but it's not really there. Well, there's several

3:31:33.520 --> 3:31:41.360
 ways of phrasing that. So, one of it is authenticity, which is if you become the thing you are on the

3:31:41.360 --> 3:31:48.160
 surface, if the depths mirror the surface, then that's what authenticity is. You're not hiding

3:31:48.160 --> 3:31:52.800
 something. You're not concealing something. To push back on the idea of actors, they actually have

3:31:52.800 --> 3:32:00.000
 often a manufactured surface that they put on and they try on different masks and the depths are

3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:03.680
 very different from the surface. And that's actually what makes them very not interesting

3:32:03.680 --> 3:32:13.200
 to interview. If you are an actor who actually lives the role that you play, so like, I don't

3:32:13.200 --> 3:32:20.800
 know, Clint Eastwood type character who clearly represents the cowboy, like at least rhymes or

3:32:20.800 --> 3:32:26.080
 echoes the person you play on the surface, that's authenticity. Some people are typecasts and they

3:32:26.080 --> 3:32:30.480
 have basically one persona they play in all of their movies and TV shows. And so those people,

3:32:30.480 --> 3:32:37.120
 it probably is the actual persona that they are, or it has become that over time. Clint Eastwood

3:32:37.120 --> 3:32:40.880
 would be one. I think of Tom Hanks as an ever. I think they just always play the same person.

3:32:40.880 --> 3:32:49.200
 And you and I are just both surface players. You're the fun, brilliant thinker and I am the

3:32:49.200 --> 3:33:00.480
 suit wearing idiot full of silly questions. All right. That said, let's put on your wise

3:33:01.520 --> 3:33:07.200
 sage hat and ask you, what advice would you give to young people today in high school and college

3:33:07.200 --> 3:33:15.280
 about life, about how to live a successful life in career or just in general that they can be proud

3:33:15.280 --> 3:33:22.400
 of? Most young people, when they actually ask you that question, what they usually mean is how can

3:33:22.400 --> 3:33:28.320
 I be successful by usual standards? I'm not very good at giving advice about that because that's

3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:36.560
 not how I tried to live my life. So I would more flip it around and say, you live in a rich society

3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:44.480
 and you will have a long life. You have many resources available to you. Whatever career you

3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:50.720
 take, you'll have plenty of time to make progress on something else. Yes, it might be better if you

3:33:50.720 --> 3:33:54.800
 find a way to combine your career and your interests in a way that gives you more time

3:33:54.800 --> 3:34:00.560
 and energy, but there are often big compromises there as well. So if you have a passion about some

3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:05.760
 topic or some thing that you think just is worth pursuing, you can just do it. You don't need other

3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:12.480
 people's approval. And you can just start doing whatever it is you think it's worth doing. It

3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:17.280
 might take you decades, but decades are enough to make enormous progress on most all interesting

3:34:17.280 --> 3:34:21.840
 things. And don't worry about the commitment of it. I mean, that's a lot of what people worry

3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:27.520
 about is, well, there's so many options. And if I choose a thing and I stick with it, I sacrifice

3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:32.640
 all the other paths I could have taken. So I switched my career at the age of 34 with two

3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:38.400
 kids, age zero and two, went back to grad school in social science after being a research software

3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:43.520
 engineer. So it's quite possible to change your mind later in life.

3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:46.640
 How can you have an age of zero?

3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:49.120
 Less than one.

3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:55.120
 Okay. Oh, you index was zero. I got it. Okay.

3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:02.000
 Right. People also ask what to read and I say, textbooks. Until you've read lots of textbooks

3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:08.880
 or maybe review articles, I'm not so sure you should be reading blog posts and Twitter feeds

3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:16.080
 and even podcasts. I would say at the beginning, this is our best, humanity's best summary of how

3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:21.760
 to learn things is crammed into textbooks. Especially the ones on like introduction to

3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:26.720
 biology, introduction to everything. Just read all the algorithms, read as many textbooks as

3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:30.480
 you can stomach. And then maybe if you want to know more about a subject, find review articles.

3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:33.520
 Right. You don't need to read the latest stuff for most topics.

3:35:33.520 --> 3:35:37.120
 Yeah. And actually textbooks often have the prettiest pictures.

3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:37.680
 There you go.

3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:42.400
 And depending on the field, if it's technical, then doing the homework problems at the end,

3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:47.360
 it's actually extremely, extremely useful. Extremely powerful way to understand something

3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:54.000
 if you allow it. I actually think of like high school and college, which you kind of remind me

3:35:54.000 --> 3:36:01.120
 of, people don't often think of it that way, but you will almost not again get an opportunity

3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:08.560
 to spend the time with a fundamental subject and like, and everybody's forcing you, like

3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:14.640
 everybody wants you to do it. And like, you'll never get that chance again to sit there,

3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:19.280
 even though it's outside of your interest, biology. Like in high school, I took AP biology,

3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:27.120
 AP chemistry. I'm thinking of subjects I never again really visited seriously. And it was so

3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:35.040
 nice to be forced into anatomy and physiology, to be forced into that world, to stay with it,

3:36:35.040 --> 3:36:40.800
 to look at the pretty pictures, to certain moments to actually for a moment, enjoy the beauty of

3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:46.240
 these, of like how a cell works and all those kinds of things. And you're somehow that stays

3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:50.400
 like the ripples of that fascination that stays with you, even if you never do those,

3:36:51.040 --> 3:36:56.720
 even if you never utilize those learnings in your actual work.

3:36:56.720 --> 3:37:01.600
 A common problem, at least of many young people I meet is that they're like feeling

3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:09.200
 idealistic and altruistic, but in a rush. So, you know, the usual human tradition that goes back,

3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:13.920
 you know, hundreds of thousands of years is that people's productivity rises with time and maybe

3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:19.520
 peaks around the age of 40 or 50. The age of 40, 50 is when you will be having the highest income,

3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:23.200
 you'll have the most contacts, you will sort of be wise about how the world works.

3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:31.280
 Expect to have your biggest impact then. Before then, you can have impacts, but you're also mainly

3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:38.320
 building up your resources and abilities. That's the usual human trajectory. Expect that to be

3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:43.120
 true of you too. Don't be in such a rush to like accomplish enormous things at the age of 18 or

3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:47.680
 whatever. I mean, you might as well practice trying to do things, but that's mostly about

3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:50.720
 learning how to do things by practicing. There's a lot of things you can't do unless you just

3:37:50.720 --> 3:37:56.640
 keep trying them. And when all else fails, try to maximize the number of offspring,

3:37:56.640 --> 3:38:01.920
 however way you can. That's certainly something I've neglected. I would tell my younger version

3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:09.200
 of myself, try to have more descendants. Yes, absolutely. It matters more than I gave,

3:38:09.200 --> 3:38:17.600
 I realized at the time. Both in terms of making copies of yourself in mutated form

3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:27.200
 and just the joy of raising them. Sure. I mean, the meaning even, you know, so in the literature on

3:38:28.160 --> 3:38:32.320
 the value people get out of life, there's a key distinction between happiness and meaning.

3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:37.680
 So happiness is how do you feel right now about right now and meaning is how do you feel about

3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:44.240
 your whole life? And, you know, many things that produce happiness don't produce meaning as

3:38:44.240 --> 3:38:51.680
 reliably. And if you have to choose between them, you'd rather have meaning. And meaning is more

3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:57.120
 goes along with sacrificing happiness sometimes. And children are an example of that. You get a lot

3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:05.520
 more meaning out of children, even if they're a lot more work. What do you think kids, children

3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:15.920
 are so magical, like raising kids? I would love to have kids. And whenever I work with robots,

3:39:15.920 --> 3:39:20.720
 there's some of the same magic when there's an entity that comes to life. And in that case,

3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:27.920
 I'm not trying to draw too many parallels, but there is some echo to it, which is when you

3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:33.840
 program a robot, there's some aspect of your intellect that is now instilled in this other

3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:40.240
 moving being that's kind of magical. Well, why do you think that's magical? And you said happiness

3:39:40.240 --> 3:39:49.200
 and meaning as opposed to a short. Why is it meaningful? It's overdetermined. Like I can give

3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:53.200
 you several different reasons, all of which is sufficient. And so the question is, we don't know

3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:59.840
 which ones are the correct reasons. It's overdetermined. Look it up. So, you know, I meet a

3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:03.360
 lot of people interested in the future, interested in thinking about the future. They're thinking

3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:08.960
 about how can I influence the future? But overwhelmingly in history so far, the main way

3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:15.920
 people have influenced the future is by having children, overwhelmingly. And that's just not an

3:40:15.920 --> 3:40:22.480
 incidental fact. You are built for that. That is, you're the sequence of thousands of generations,

3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:28.880
 each of which successfully had a descendant. And that affected who you are. You just have to expect

3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:36.800
 and it's true that who you are is built to be, you know, expect to have a child, to want to have a

3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:41.920
 child, to have that be a natural and meaningful interaction for you. And it's just true. It's just

3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:48.080
 one of those things you just should have expected and it's not a surprise. Well, to push back and

3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:54.960
 sort of in terms of influencing the future, as we get more and more technology, more and more of us

3:40:54.960 --> 3:41:00.240
 are able to influence the future in all kinds of other ways, right? Being a teacher, educator. Even

3:41:00.240 --> 3:41:05.440
 so, though, still most of our influence in the future has probably happened being kids, even

3:41:05.440 --> 3:41:11.120
 though we've accumulated more ways, other ways to do it. You mean at scale. I guess the depth of

3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:15.920
 influence, like really how much of much effort, how much of yourself you really put into another human

3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:24.480
 being. Do you mean both the raising of a kid or you mean raw genetic information? Well, both, but

3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:30.720
 raw genetics is probably more than half of it. More than half. More than half. Even in this modern

3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:40.080
 world? Yeah. Genetics. Let me ask some dark, difficult questions, if I might. Let's take a

3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:48.080
 stroll into that place that may or may not exist, according to you. What's the darkest place you've

3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:54.960
 ever gone to in your mind, in your life, a dark time, a challenging time in your life that you had to overcome?

3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:06.160
 You know, probably just feeling strongly rejected. And so I've been, I'm apparently somewhat

3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:11.360
 emotionally scarred by just being very rejection averse, which must have happened because

3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:18.400
 some rejections were just very scarring. At a scale in what kinds of communities? On the

3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:24.720
 individual scale? I mean, lots of different scales, yeah. All the different, many different scales. Still

3:42:24.720 --> 3:42:33.360
 that rejection stings. Hold on a second, but you are a contrarian thinker. You challenge the

3:42:33.360 --> 3:42:43.360
 norms. Why, if you were scarred by rejection, why welcome it in so many ways at a much

3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:50.560
 larger scale, constantly with your ideas? It could be that I'm just stupid, or that I've just categorized

3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:58.160
 them differently than I should or something. You know, the most rejection that I've faced hasn't been

3:42:58.160 --> 3:43:06.000
 because of my intellectual ideas. So the intellectual ideas haven't been the thing

3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:14.960
 to risk the rejection. The one that, the things that challenge your mind taking you to a dark

3:43:14.960 --> 3:43:21.040
 place are the more psychological rejections. So. Well, you just asked me, you know, what took me to a

3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:25.600
 dark place. You didn't specify it as sort of an intellectual dark place, I guess. Yeah, I just

3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:33.760
 meant like what? So intellectual is disjoint or at least at a more surface level than something

3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:38.560
 emotional? Yeah, I would just think, you know, there are times in your life when, you know,

3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:43.520
 you're just in a dark place and that can have many different causes. And most, you know, most

3:43:43.520 --> 3:43:47.840
 intellectuals are still just people and most of the things that will affect them are the kinds of

3:43:47.840 --> 3:43:52.240
 things that affect people. They aren't that different necessarily. I mean, that's going to be true for,

3:43:52.240 --> 3:43:55.920
 like, I presume most basketball players are still just people. If you ask them what was the worst

3:43:55.920 --> 3:43:59.760
 part of their life, it's going to be this kind of thing that was the worst part of life for most

3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:06.160
 people. So rejection early in life? Yeah, I think, I mean, not in grade school probably, but, you know,

3:44:06.160 --> 3:44:13.760
 yeah, sort of, you know, being a young nerdy guy and feeling, you know, not in much demand or interest

3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:22.800
 or, you know, later on, lots of different kinds of rejection. But yeah, but I think that's, you know,

3:44:22.800 --> 3:44:26.960
 most of us like to pretend we don't that much need other people. We don't care what they think.

3:44:26.960 --> 3:44:30.720
 I know it's a common sort of stance if somebody rejects you or something, I didn't care about them

3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:35.920
 anyway. I, you know, didn't, but I think to be honest, people really do care. Yeah, we do seek

3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:40.480
 that connection, that love. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition?

3:44:40.480 --> 3:44:53.440
 Um, opacity, in part. That is, love is one of those things where we know at some level it's

3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:59.200
 important to us, but it's not very clearly shown to us exactly how or why or in what ways.

3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:03.760
 There are some kinds of things we want where we can just clearly see that we want and why that we

3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:07.280
 want it, right? We know when we're thirsty, and we know why we were thirsty, and we know what to

3:45:07.280 --> 3:45:13.520
 do about being thirsty, and we know when it's over that we're no longer thirsty. Love isn't like that.

3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:19.040
 It's like, what do we seek from this? We're drawn to it, but we do not understand why

3:45:19.920 --> 3:45:25.040
 we're drawn exactly. Because it's not just affection, because if it was just affection,

3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:32.160
 we don't seem to be drawn to pure affection. We don't seem to be drawn to somebody who's like a

3:45:32.160 --> 3:45:37.520
 servant. We don't seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody that satisfies all your needs or something

3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:43.520
 like that. So it's clearly something we want or need, but we're not exactly very clear about it,

3:45:43.520 --> 3:45:48.080
 and that is kind of important to it. So I've also noticed there are some kinds of things

3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:53.040
 you can't imagine very well. So if you imagine a situation, there's some aspects of the situation

3:45:53.040 --> 3:45:56.960
 that you can clearly, you can imagine it being bright or dim, you can imagine it being windy,

3:45:56.960 --> 3:46:02.240
 or you can imagine it being hot or cold. But there's some aspects about your emotional stance

3:46:02.240 --> 3:46:08.240
 in a situation that's actually just hard to imagine or even remember. You can often remember

3:46:08.240 --> 3:46:12.720
 an emotion only when you're in a similar sort of emotion situation, and otherwise, you just can't

3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:18.640
 bring the emotion to your mind, and you can't even imagine it, right? So there's certain kinds of

3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:22.480
 emotions you can have, and when you're in that emotion, you can know that you have it, and you

3:46:22.480 --> 3:46:28.560
 can have a name, and it's associated. But later on, I tell you, remember joy, and it doesn't come to

3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:33.760
 mind. I'm not able to replay it. Right. And it's the sort of reason why we have, one of the reasons

3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:41.200
 that pushes us to re consume it and reproduce it is that we can't reimagine it. Well, it's interesting

3:46:41.200 --> 3:46:47.840
 because there's a Daniel Kahneman type of thing of reliving memories, because I'm able to summon

3:46:47.840 --> 3:46:53.760
 some aspect of that emotion, again, by thinking of that situation from which that emotion came.

3:46:53.760 --> 3:46:59.840
 Right. So like a certain song, you can listen to it, and you can feel the same way you felt the

3:46:59.840 --> 3:47:03.760
 first time you remember that song associated with it. Right. So you need to remember that situation

3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:08.400
 in some sort of complete package. Yes. You can't just take one part off of it, and then if you get

3:47:08.400 --> 3:47:13.440
 the whole package again, if you remember the whole feeling. Yes. Or some fundamental aspect of that

3:47:13.440 --> 3:47:18.480
 whole experience that arouse from which the feeling arose. And actually, the feeling is probably

3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:23.040
 different in some way. It could be more pleasant or less pleasant than the feeling you felt

3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:28.160
 originally, and that morphs over time every time you replay that memory. It is interesting. You're

3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:33.840
 not able to replay the feeling perfectly. You don't remember the feeling. You remember the facts of the

3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:39.200
 events. So there's a sense of which over time we expand our vocabulary as a community of language,

3:47:39.200 --> 3:47:43.920
 and that allows us to sort of have more feelings and know that we are feeling them. Because you can

3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:47.840
 have a feeling but not have a word for it, and then you don't know how to categorize it or even

3:47:47.840 --> 3:47:52.720
 what it is and whether it's the same as something else. But once you have a word for it, you can

3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:58.640
 sort of pull it together more easily. And so I think over time we are having a richer palette of

3:47:58.640 --> 3:48:05.520
 feelings because we have more words for them. What has been a painful loss in your life?

3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:12.640
 Maybe somebody or something that's no longer in your life, but played an important part of your life.

3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:13.140
 Youth?

3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:16.800
 That's a concept. No, it has to be...

3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:20.720
 I mean, but I was once younger. I had health and I had vitality. I was

3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:22.960
 insomere. I mean, you know, I've lost that over time.

3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:25.760
 Do you see that as a different person? Maybe you've lost that person.

3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:32.080
 Yes, absolutely. I'm a different person than I was when I was younger, and I don't even remember

3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:36.800
 exactly what he was. So I don't remember as many things from the past as many people do. So in

3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:42.560
 some sense, I've just lost a lot of my history by not remembering it. And I'm not that person

3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:45.120
 anymore. That person is gone and I don't have any of their abilities.

3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:46.400
 Is it a painful loss, though?

3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:47.440
 Yeah.

3:48:47.440 --> 3:48:51.200
 Or is it a... Why is it painful? Because you're wiser.

3:48:54.640 --> 3:48:57.840
 There's so many things that are beneficial to getting older.

3:48:57.840 --> 3:49:06.240
 Right. But I just was this person and I felt assured that I could continue to be that person.

3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:07.680
 And you're no longer that person.

3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:13.360
 And he's gone. And I'm not him anymore. And he died without fanfare or a funeral.

3:49:14.240 --> 3:49:20.640
 And that the person you are today talking to me, that person will be changed, too.

3:49:20.640 --> 3:49:24.320
 Yes. And maybe in 20 years, he won't be there anymore.

3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:30.560
 And the future person, we'll look back. The future version of you will...

3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:34.720
 For Ems, this will be less of a problem. For Ems, they would be able to save an archived

3:49:34.720 --> 3:49:39.440
 copy of themselves at each different age. And they could turn it on periodically and go back

3:49:39.440 --> 3:49:40.000
 and talk to it.

3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:46.880
 To replay. You think some of that will be... So with emulated minds, with Ems,

3:49:46.880 --> 3:50:00.000
 there's a digital cloning that happens. And do you think that makes you less special if you're

3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:10.160
 clonable? Does that make you the experience of life, the experience of a moment, the scarcity

3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:14.640
 of that moment, the scarcity of that experience, isn't that a fundamental part of what makes

3:50:14.640 --> 3:50:18.160
 that experience so delicious, so rich of feeling?

3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:22.480
 I think if you think of a song that lots of people listen to that are copies all over the

3:50:22.480 --> 3:50:24.560
 world, we're going to call that a more special song.

3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:28.080
 Yeah. Yeah.

3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:38.400
 So there's a perspective on copying and cloning where you're just scaling happiness versus

3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:40.160
 degrading it.

3:50:40.160 --> 3:50:46.800
 I mean, each copy of a song is less special if there are many copies, but the song itself is

3:50:46.800 --> 3:50:48.480
 more special if there are many copies.

3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:55.120
 In a mass, right, you're actually spreading the happiness even if it diminishes over a

3:50:55.120 --> 3:50:58.880
 large number of people at scale and that increases the overall happiness in the world.

3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:01.520
 And then you're able to do that with multiple songs.

3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:06.800
 Is a person who has an identical twin more or less special?

3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:16.880
 Well, the problem with identical twins is, you know, it's like just two with M's.

3:51:16.880 --> 3:51:18.480
 Right, but two is different than one.

3:51:18.480 --> 3:51:24.560
 So I think an identical twin's life is richer for having this other identical twin, somebody

3:51:24.560 --> 3:51:26.560
 who understands them better than anybody else can.

3:51:27.760 --> 3:51:32.080
 From the point of view of an identical twin, I think they have a richer life for being

3:51:32.080 --> 3:51:34.560
 part of this couple, each of which is very similar.

3:51:34.560 --> 3:51:38.960
 Now, if you said, will the world, you know, if we lose one of the identical twins, will

3:51:38.960 --> 3:51:42.240
 the world miss it as much because you've got the other one and they're pretty similar?

3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:46.560
 Maybe from the rest of the world's point of view, they suffer less of a loss when they

3:51:46.560 --> 3:51:48.080
 lose one of the identical twins.

3:51:48.080 --> 3:51:52.400
 But from the point of view of the identical twin themselves, their life is enriched by

3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:53.520
 having a twin.

3:51:53.520 --> 3:51:58.240
 See, but the identical twin copying happens at the place of birth.

3:51:58.240 --> 3:52:04.960
 It's different than copying after you've done some of the environment, like the nurture

3:52:05.600 --> 3:52:08.640
 at the teenage or in the 20s after going to college.

3:52:08.640 --> 3:52:11.920
 Yes, that'll be an interesting thing for M's to find out all the different ways that

3:52:11.920 --> 3:52:16.080
 they can have different relationships to different people who have different degrees of similarity

3:52:16.080 --> 3:52:16.720
 to them in time.

3:52:17.760 --> 3:52:21.120
 Yeah, yeah, man.

3:52:23.920 --> 3:52:26.880
 But it seems like a rich space to explore and I don't feel sorry for them.

3:52:26.880 --> 3:52:29.200
 This sounds like an interesting world to live in.

3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:31.920
 And there could be some ethical conundrums there.

3:52:31.920 --> 3:52:35.200
 There will be many new choices to make that they don't make now.

3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:38.560
 So, and I discussed that in the book Age of M.

3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:43.040
 Like, say you have a lover and you make a copy of yourself, but the lover doesn't make

3:52:43.040 --> 3:52:43.440
 a copy.

3:52:43.440 --> 3:52:48.880
 Well now, which one of you or are both still related to the lover?

3:52:48.880 --> 3:52:52.560
 Socially entitled to show up.

3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:58.800
 Yes, so you'll have to make choices then when you split yourself, which of you inherit

3:52:58.800 --> 3:52:59.840
 which unique things.

3:53:01.760 --> 3:53:08.720
 Yeah, and of course there'll be an equivalent increase in lawyers.

3:53:08.720 --> 3:53:14.800
 Well, I guess you can clone the lawyers to help manage some of these negotiations of

3:53:14.800 --> 3:53:16.160
 how to split property.

3:53:16.160 --> 3:53:22.080
 The nature of owning, I mean, property is connected to individuals, right?

3:53:22.080 --> 3:53:26.320
 You only really need lawyers for this with an inefficient, awkward law that is not very

3:53:26.320 --> 3:53:28.320
 transparent and able to do things.

3:53:28.320 --> 3:53:33.520
 So, you know, for example, an operating system of a computer is a law for that computer.

3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:37.920
 When the operating system is simple and clean, you don't need to hire a lawyer to make a

3:53:37.920 --> 3:53:38.800
 key choice with the operating system.

3:53:38.800 --> 3:53:40.240
 You don't need a human in the loop.

3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:42.800
 You just make a choice, right?

3:53:42.800 --> 3:53:48.640
 So ideally we want a legal system that makes the common choices easy and not require much

3:53:48.640 --> 3:53:49.440
 overhead.

3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:54.160
 And that's the digitization of things further enables that.

3:53:56.000 --> 3:54:01.280
 So the loss of a younger self, what about the loss of your life overall?

3:54:01.280 --> 3:54:03.760
 Do you ponder your death, your mortality?

3:54:03.760 --> 3:54:05.120
 Are you afraid of it?

3:54:05.120 --> 3:54:06.960
 I am a cryonics customer.

3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:09.520
 That's what this little tag around my deck says.

3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:15.840
 It says that if you find me in a medical situation, you should call these people to enable the

3:54:15.840 --> 3:54:16.960
 cryonics transfer.

3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:21.760
 So I am taking a long shot chance at living a much longer life.

3:54:22.480 --> 3:54:25.600
 Can you explain what cryonics is?

3:54:25.600 --> 3:54:32.800
 So when medical science gives up on me in this world, instead of burning me or letting

3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:36.960
 worms eat me, they will freeze me or at least freeze my head.

3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:40.400
 And there is damage that happens in the process of freezing the head.

3:54:40.400 --> 3:54:44.240
 But once it's frozen, it won't change for a very long time.

3:54:44.240 --> 3:54:47.520
 Chemically, it'll just be completely exactly the same.

3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:50.960
 So future technology might be able to revive me.

3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:55.440
 And in fact, I would be mainly counting on the brain emulation scenario, which doesn't

3:54:55.440 --> 3:54:58.000
 require reviving my entire biological body.

3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:00.320
 It means I would be in a computer simulation.

3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:05.520
 And so I think I've got at least a 5% shot at that.

3:55:06.400 --> 3:55:07.680
 And that's immortality.

3:55:10.320 --> 3:55:12.000
 But most likely it won't happen.

3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:14.160
 And therefore, I'm sad that it won't happen.

3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:18.800
 Do you think immortality is something that you would like to have?

3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:26.160
 Well, I mean, just like infinity, I mean, you can't know until forever, which means

3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:26.800
 never, right?

3:55:26.800 --> 3:55:30.800
 So all you can really, you know, the better choice is at each moment, do you want to keep

3:55:30.800 --> 3:55:31.600
 going?

3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:34.720
 So I would like at every moment to have the option to keep going.

3:55:34.720 --> 3:55:45.440
 The interesting thing about human experience is that the way you phrase it is exactly right.

3:55:45.440 --> 3:55:48.000
 At every moment, I would like to keep going.

3:55:48.720 --> 3:55:58.640
 But the thing that happens, you know, leave them wanting more of whatever that phrase

3:55:58.640 --> 3:56:04.560
 is, the thing that happens is over time, it's possible for certain experiences to become

3:56:04.560 --> 3:56:07.840
 bland and you become tired of them.

3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:12.960
 And that actually makes life really unpleasant.

3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:15.760
 Sorry, makes that experience really unpleasant.

3:56:15.760 --> 3:56:21.280
 And perhaps you can generalize that to life itself if you have a long enough horizon.

3:56:21.280 --> 3:56:22.000
 And so...

3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:24.560
 Might happen, but might as well wait and find out.

3:56:24.560 --> 3:56:28.160
 But then you're ending on suffering, you know?

3:56:28.160 --> 3:56:31.600
 So in the world of brain emulations, I have more options.

3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:34.080
 You can return yourself.

3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:38.480
 That is, I can make copies of myself, archive copies at various ages.

3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:43.440
 And at a later age, I could decide that I'd rather replace myself with a new copy from

3:56:43.440 --> 3:56:44.000
 a younger age.

3:56:44.640 --> 3:56:48.800
 So does a brain emulation still operate in physical space?

3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:53.360
 So can we do, what do you think about like the metaverse and operating in virtual reality

3:56:53.360 --> 3:57:00.240
 so we can conjure up not just emulate, not just your own brain and body, but the entirety

3:57:00.240 --> 3:57:00.880
 of the environment?

3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:06.000
 Well, most brain emulations will, in fact, most of their time in virtual reality.

3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:08.480
 But they wouldn't think of it as virtual reality.

3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:10.560
 They would just think of it as their usual reality.

3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:15.600
 I mean, the thing to notice, I think, in our world, most of us spend most time indoors.

3:57:16.320 --> 3:57:21.760
 And indoors, we are surrounded by walls covered with paint and floors covered with

3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:23.600
 tile or rugs.

3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:25.520
 Most of our environment is artificial.

3:57:26.400 --> 3:57:28.560
 It's constructed to be convenient for us.

3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:30.640
 It's not the natural world that was there before.

3:57:31.200 --> 3:57:33.280
 A virtual reality is basically just like that.

3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:36.640
 It is the environment that's comfortable and convenient for you.

3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:41.360
 But when it's the right, that environment for you, it's real for you.

3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:45.040
 Just like the room you're in right now most likely is very real for you.

3:57:45.040 --> 3:57:49.600
 You're not focused on the fact that the paint is hiding the actual studs behind the

3:57:49.600 --> 3:57:52.160
 wall and the actual wires and pipes and everything else.

3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:55.920
 The fact that we're hiding that from you doesn't make it fake or unreal.

3:57:58.400 --> 3:58:04.400
 What are the chances that we're actually in the very kind of system that you're describing

3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:08.880
 where the environment and the brain is being emulated and you're just replaying an experience

3:58:08.880 --> 3:58:14.960
 when you first did a podcast with Lex after?

3:58:14.960 --> 3:58:19.520
 And now, the person that originally launched this already did hundreds of podcasts with

3:58:19.520 --> 3:58:19.760
 Lex.

3:58:19.760 --> 3:58:24.560
 This is just the first time and you like this time because there's so much uncertainty.

3:58:24.560 --> 3:58:25.360
 There's nerves.

3:58:25.360 --> 3:58:26.720
 It could have gone any direction.

3:58:28.320 --> 3:58:32.560
 At the moment, we don't have the technical ability to create that emulation.

3:58:32.560 --> 3:58:37.280
 So we'd have to be postulating that in the future we have that ability and then they

3:58:37.280 --> 3:58:40.400
 choose to evaluate this moment now to simulate it.

3:58:40.400 --> 3:58:45.520
 Don't you think we could be in the simulation of that exact experience right now and we

3:58:45.520 --> 3:58:46.320
 wouldn't be able to know?

3:58:46.320 --> 3:58:51.040
 So one scenario would be this never really happened.

3:58:51.040 --> 3:58:53.920
 This only happens as a reconstruction later on.

3:58:55.040 --> 3:58:58.560
 That's different than the scenario that this did happen the first time and now it's happening

3:58:58.560 --> 3:58:59.840
 again as a reconstruction.

3:59:00.640 --> 3:59:06.240
 That second scenario is harder to put together because it requires this coincidence where

3:59:06.240 --> 3:59:08.960
 between the two times we produce the ability to do it.

3:59:08.960 --> 3:59:18.320
 But don't you think replay of memories, poor replay of memories is something that might

3:59:18.320 --> 3:59:19.600
 be a possible thing in the future?

3:59:19.600 --> 3:59:22.720
 You're saying it's harder than conjure up things from scratch.

3:59:23.600 --> 3:59:25.040
 It's certainly possible.

3:59:25.040 --> 3:59:29.920
 So the main way I would think about it is in terms of the demand for simulation versus

3:59:29.920 --> 3:59:31.120
 other kinds of things.

3:59:31.120 --> 3:59:36.160
 So I've given this a lot of thought because I first wrote about this long ago when Bostrom

3:59:36.160 --> 3:59:40.400
 first wrote his papers about simulation argument and I wrote about how to live in a simulation.

3:59:42.160 --> 3:59:50.560
 And so the key issue is the fraction of creatures in the universe that are really experiencing

3:59:50.560 --> 3:59:54.480
 what you appear to be really experiencing relative to the fraction that are experiencing

3:59:54.480 --> 3:59:57.760
 it in a simulation way, i.e., simulated.

3:59:57.760 --> 4:00:06.880
 So then the key parameter is at any one moment in time, creatures at that time, many of them,

4:00:06.880 --> 4:00:10.880
 most of them are presumably really experiencing what they're experiencing, but some fraction

4:00:10.880 --> 4:00:17.760
 of them are experiencing some past time where that past time is being remembered via their

4:00:17.760 --> 4:00:18.320
 simulation.

4:00:19.680 --> 4:00:26.000
 So to figure out this ratio, what we need to think about is basically two functions.

4:00:26.000 --> 4:00:29.440
 One is how fast in time does the number of creatures grow?

4:00:30.320 --> 4:00:33.760
 And then how fast in time does the interest in the past decline?

4:00:34.800 --> 4:00:40.000
 Because at any one time, people will be simulating different periods in the past with different

4:00:40.000 --> 4:00:40.480
 emphasis.

4:00:40.480 --> 4:00:42.240
 I love the way you think so much.

4:00:42.880 --> 4:00:44.160
 That's exactly right, yeah.

4:00:44.160 --> 4:00:51.680
 So if the first function grows slower than the second one declines, then in fact, your

4:00:51.680 --> 4:00:54.160
 chances of being simulated are low.

4:00:54.160 --> 4:00:54.720
 Yes.

4:00:54.720 --> 4:00:58.960
 So the key question is how fast does interest in the past decline relative to the rate

4:00:58.960 --> 4:01:00.720
 at which the population grows with time?

4:01:00.720 --> 4:01:05.040
 Does this correlate to you earlier suggested that the interest in the future increases

4:01:05.040 --> 4:01:09.520
 over time, are those correlated interest in the future versus interest in the past?

4:01:09.520 --> 4:01:11.280
 Like, why are we interested in the past?

4:01:11.280 --> 4:01:15.840
 So, but the simple way to do it is, as you know, like Google Ngrams has a way to type

4:01:15.840 --> 4:01:20.400
 in a word and see how interest in it declines or rises over time, right?

4:01:20.400 --> 4:01:20.880
 Yeah.

4:01:20.880 --> 4:01:24.160
 You can just type in a year and get the answer for that.

4:01:24.160 --> 4:01:30.320
 If you type in a particular year, like 1900 or 1950, you can see with Google Ngram, how

4:01:30.320 --> 4:01:34.480
 interest in that year increased up until that date and decreased after it.

4:01:34.480 --> 4:01:35.040
 Yep.

4:01:35.040 --> 4:01:41.040
 And you can see that interest in a date declines faster than does the population grow with

4:01:41.040 --> 4:01:41.540
 time.

4:01:42.880 --> 4:01:43.680
 That is brilliant.

4:01:44.640 --> 4:01:45.600
 That is so interesting.

4:01:45.600 --> 4:01:46.640
 And so you have the answer.

4:01:48.000 --> 4:01:49.120
 Wow.

4:01:49.120 --> 4:01:50.560
 Wow.

4:01:50.560 --> 4:01:56.160
 And that was your argument against, not against to this particular aspect of the simulation,

4:01:56.160 --> 4:02:01.920
 how much past simulation there will be, replay of past memories.

4:02:01.920 --> 4:02:06.000
 First of all, if we assume that like simulation of the past is a small fraction of all the

4:02:06.000 --> 4:02:07.120
 creatures at that moment.

4:02:07.120 --> 4:02:07.440
 Yes.

4:02:07.440 --> 4:02:07.940
 Right.

4:02:08.880 --> 4:02:10.400
 And then it's about how fast.

4:02:10.400 --> 4:02:15.680
 Now, some people have argued plausibly that maybe most interest in the past falls with

4:02:15.680 --> 4:02:19.840
 this fast function, but some unusual category of interest in the past won't fall that fast

4:02:19.840 --> 4:02:20.160
 quickly.

4:02:20.160 --> 4:02:22.080
 And then that eventually would dominate.

4:02:22.080 --> 4:02:24.240
 So that's a other hypothesis you want.

4:02:24.240 --> 4:02:25.440
 Some category.

4:02:25.440 --> 4:02:28.720
 So that very outlier specific kind of, yeah, okay.

4:02:28.720 --> 4:02:29.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4:02:29.520 --> 4:02:35.040
 Like really popular kinds of memories, like probably sexual.

4:02:35.040 --> 4:02:40.240
 In a trillion years, there's some small research institute that tries to randomly select from

4:02:40.240 --> 4:02:42.560
 all possible people in history or something to simulate.

4:02:42.560 --> 4:02:46.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4:02:46.080 --> 4:02:50.640
 So the question is how big is this research institute and how big is the future in a trillion

4:02:50.640 --> 4:02:51.200
 years, right?

4:02:51.200 --> 4:02:52.720
 And that would be hard to say.

4:02:52.720 --> 4:02:57.680
 But if we just look at the ordinary process by which people simulate recent errors.

4:02:57.680 --> 4:03:02.000
 So if you look at, it's also true for movies and plays and video games,

4:03:02.000 --> 4:03:04.080
 overwhelmingly they're interested in the recent past.

4:03:04.800 --> 4:03:07.440
 There's very few video games where you play someone in the Roman Empire.

4:03:07.440 --> 4:03:08.160
 Right.

4:03:08.160 --> 4:03:12.320
 But even fewer where you play someone in the ancient Egyptian Empire.

4:03:14.320 --> 4:03:15.440
 Yeah, just different.

4:03:15.440 --> 4:03:16.560
 It's just declined very quickly.

4:03:16.560 --> 4:03:18.880
 But every once in a while that's brought back.

4:03:20.880 --> 4:03:21.840
 But yeah, you're right.

4:03:21.840 --> 4:03:28.160
 I mean, just if you look at the mass of entertainment, movies and games, it's focusing on the present

4:03:28.160 --> 4:03:29.200
 recent past.

4:03:29.200 --> 4:03:32.320
 And maybe some, I mean, where does science fiction fit into this?

4:03:32.320 --> 4:03:39.040
 Because it's sort of, what is science fiction?

4:03:39.040 --> 4:03:44.000
 I mean, it's a mix of the past and the present and some kind of manipulation of that to make

4:03:44.000 --> 4:03:48.800
 it more efficient for us to ask deep philosophical questions about humanity.

4:03:48.800 --> 4:03:51.520
 The closest genre to science fiction is clearly fantasy.

4:03:51.520 --> 4:03:55.280
 Fantasy and science fiction in many bookstores and even Netflix or whatever categories, they're

4:03:55.280 --> 4:03:56.080
 just lumped together.

4:03:56.640 --> 4:03:58.240
 So clearly they have a similar function.

4:03:58.240 --> 4:04:02.160
 So that the function of fantasy is more transparent than the function of science fiction.

4:04:02.160 --> 4:04:03.760
 So use that as your guide.

4:04:04.240 --> 4:04:08.800
 What's fantasy for is just to take away the constraints of the ordinary world and imagine

4:04:08.800 --> 4:04:10.560
 stories with much fewer constraints.

4:04:10.560 --> 4:04:11.840
 That's what fantasy is.

4:04:11.840 --> 4:04:13.040
 You are much less constrained.

4:04:13.040 --> 4:04:14.800
 What's the purpose to remove constraints?

4:04:14.800 --> 4:04:18.960
 Is it to escape from the harshness of the constraints of the real world?

4:04:19.600 --> 4:04:24.960
 Or is it to just remove constraints in order to explore some, get a deeper understanding

4:04:24.960 --> 4:04:26.000
 of our world?

4:04:26.000 --> 4:04:26.800
 What is it?

4:04:26.800 --> 4:04:28.800
 I mean, why do people read fantasy?

4:04:28.800 --> 4:04:33.680
 I'm not a cheap fantasy reading kind of person.

4:04:34.320 --> 4:04:34.960
 So I need to...

4:04:36.400 --> 4:04:40.720
 One story that sounds plausible to me is that there are sort of these deep story structures

4:04:40.720 --> 4:04:43.760
 that we love and we want to realize.

4:04:43.760 --> 4:04:45.760
 And then many details of the world get in their way.

4:04:46.560 --> 4:04:51.200
 Fantasy takes all those obstacles out of the way and lets you tell the essential hero story

4:04:51.200 --> 4:04:53.760
 or the essential love story, whatever essential story you want to tell.

4:04:53.760 --> 4:04:57.120
 Well, the reality and constraints are not in the way.

4:04:59.120 --> 4:05:02.640
 And so science fiction can be thought of as like fantasy, except you're not willing to

4:05:02.640 --> 4:05:04.480
 admit that it can't be true.

4:05:04.480 --> 4:05:07.280
 So the future gives the excuse of saying, well, it could happen.

4:05:09.280 --> 4:05:13.840
 And you accept some more reality constraints for the illusion, at least, that maybe it

4:05:13.840 --> 4:05:14.800
 could really happen.

4:05:16.640 --> 4:05:18.080
 Maybe it could happen.

4:05:18.080 --> 4:05:20.080
 And that, it stimulates the imagination.

4:05:20.080 --> 4:05:24.000
 Imagination is something really interesting about human beings.

4:05:24.880 --> 4:05:28.960
 And it seems also to be an important part of creating really special things is to be

4:05:28.960 --> 4:05:30.160
 able to first imagine them.

4:05:30.960 --> 4:05:37.360
 With you and Nick Bostrom, where do you land on the simulation and all the mathematical

4:05:37.360 --> 4:05:41.280
 ways of thinking it and just the thought experiment of it?

4:05:41.280 --> 4:05:42.800
 Are we living in a simulation?

4:05:44.480 --> 4:05:46.720
 That was just the discussion we just had.

4:05:46.720 --> 4:05:50.000
 That is, you should grant the possibility of being a simulation.

4:05:50.000 --> 4:05:52.080
 You shouldn't be 100% confident that you're not.

4:05:52.080 --> 4:05:54.240
 You should certainly grant a small probability.

4:05:54.240 --> 4:05:56.160
 The question is, how large is that probability?

4:05:56.160 --> 4:06:01.600
 Are you saying we would be, I misunderstood because I thought our discussion was about

4:06:01.600 --> 4:06:03.360
 replaying things that already happened.

4:06:03.360 --> 4:06:03.520
 Right.

4:06:03.520 --> 4:06:07.280
 But the whole question is, right now, is that what I am?

4:06:08.080 --> 4:06:11.840
 Am I actually a replay from some distant future?

4:06:11.840 --> 4:06:13.680
 But it doesn't necessarily need to be a replay.

4:06:13.680 --> 4:06:15.280
 It could be a totally new.

4:06:15.280 --> 4:06:17.360
 You could be, you don't have to be an NPC.

4:06:17.360 --> 4:06:20.880
 Clearly, I'm in a certain era with a certain kind of world around me.

4:06:20.880 --> 4:06:24.560
 So either this is a complete fantasy or it's a past of somebody else in the future.

4:06:26.480 --> 4:06:28.080
 No, it could be a complete fantasy though.

4:06:28.080 --> 4:06:28.640
 It could be.

4:06:28.640 --> 4:06:32.080
 But then you have to talk about what's the fraction of complete fantasies.

4:06:33.680 --> 4:06:36.880
 I would say it's easier to generate a fantasy than to replay a memory.

4:06:36.880 --> 4:06:37.120
 Right?

4:06:37.120 --> 4:06:39.840
 Oh, but the fraction is important.

4:06:39.840 --> 4:06:41.600
 We just look at the entire history of everything.

4:06:41.600 --> 4:06:43.760
 We just say, sure, but most things are real.

4:06:43.760 --> 4:06:45.200
 Most things aren't fantasies.

4:06:45.200 --> 4:06:47.040
 Therefore, the chance that my thing is real.

4:06:47.040 --> 4:06:47.440
 Right?

4:06:47.440 --> 4:06:50.560
 So the simulation argument works stronger about sort of the past.

4:06:50.560 --> 4:06:53.840
 We say, ah, but there's more future people than there are today.

4:06:53.840 --> 4:06:57.600
 So you being in the past of the future makes you special relative to them,

4:06:57.600 --> 4:06:59.840
 which makes you more likely to be in a simulation.

4:06:59.840 --> 4:07:00.160
 Right?

4:07:00.160 --> 4:07:03.680
 If we're just taking the full count and saying, in all creatures ever,

4:07:03.680 --> 4:07:05.120
 what percentage are in simulations?

4:07:05.120 --> 4:07:06.400
 Probably no more than 10%.

4:07:08.240 --> 4:07:10.000
 So what's the good argument for that?

4:07:10.000 --> 4:07:11.680
 That most things are real?

4:07:11.680 --> 4:07:12.080
 Yeah.

4:07:12.080 --> 4:07:14.240
 Because a classroom says the other way, right?

4:07:14.240 --> 4:07:20.240
 In a competitive world, in a world where people have to work and have to get things done,

4:07:20.240 --> 4:07:23.360
 then they have a limited budget for leisure.

4:07:24.080 --> 4:07:29.600
 And so, you know, leisure things are less common than work things, like real things.

4:07:29.600 --> 4:07:29.840
 Right?

4:07:29.840 --> 4:07:41.040
 But if you look at the stretch of history in the universe, doesn't the ratio of leisure increase?

4:07:41.040 --> 4:07:45.360
 Isn't that where we, isn't that the forger?

4:07:45.360 --> 4:07:47.360
 Right, but now we're looking at the fraction of leisure,

4:07:47.360 --> 4:07:51.920
 which takes the form of something where the person doing the leisure doesn't realize it.

4:07:51.920 --> 4:07:54.160
 Now there could be some fraction of that, but that's much smaller, right?

4:07:55.200 --> 4:07:55.520
 Yeah.

4:07:57.440 --> 4:07:58.880
 Clueless forgers.

4:07:58.880 --> 4:08:02.640
 Or somebody is clueless in the process of supporting this leisure, right?

4:08:02.640 --> 4:08:04.320
 It might not be the person leisureing, somebody,

4:08:04.320 --> 4:08:05.600
 they're a supporting character or something,

4:08:05.600 --> 4:08:07.760
 but still that's got to be a pretty small fraction of leisure.

4:08:07.760 --> 4:08:12.880
 What, you mentioned that children are one of the things that are a source of meaning.

4:08:13.760 --> 4:08:16.320
 Broadly speaking, then let me ask the big question.

4:08:16.320 --> 4:08:18.000
 What's the meaning of this whole thing?

4:08:19.040 --> 4:08:21.120
 Robin, meaning of life.

4:08:21.120 --> 4:08:22.560
 What is the meaning of life?

4:08:23.200 --> 4:08:27.600
 We talked about alien civilizations, but this is the one we got.

4:08:27.600 --> 4:08:28.800
 Where are the aliens?

4:08:28.800 --> 4:08:29.680
 Where are the human?

4:08:30.960 --> 4:08:34.080
 Seem to be conscious, be able to introspect.

4:08:35.040 --> 4:08:37.280
 What's, why are we here?

4:08:37.280 --> 4:08:40.720
 This is the thing I told you before about how we can predict that

4:08:40.720 --> 4:08:42.320
 future creatures will be different from us.

4:08:43.840 --> 4:08:50.320
 We, our preferences are this amalgam of various sorts of random sort of patched together

4:08:51.200 --> 4:08:56.800
 preferences about thirst and sex and sleep and attention and all these sorts of things.

4:08:57.360 --> 4:08:59.600
 So we don't understand that very well.

4:08:59.600 --> 4:09:02.480
 It's not very transparent and it's a mess, right?

4:09:03.360 --> 4:09:05.840
 That is the source of our motivation.

4:09:05.840 --> 4:09:09.520
 That is how we were made and how we are induced to do things.

4:09:09.520 --> 4:09:13.280
 But we can't summarize it very well and we don't even understand it very well.

4:09:13.760 --> 4:09:15.040
 That's who we are.

4:09:15.040 --> 4:09:18.080
 And often we find ourselves in a situation where we don't feel very motivated.

4:09:18.080 --> 4:09:18.880
 We don't know why.

4:09:18.880 --> 4:09:22.080
 In other situations, we find ourselves very motivated and we don't know why either.

4:09:24.480 --> 4:09:29.200
 And so that's the nature of being a human of the sort that we are because

4:09:29.200 --> 4:09:32.400
 even though we can think abstractly and reason abstractly, this package

4:09:32.400 --> 4:09:34.640
 of motivations is just opaque and a mess.

4:09:34.640 --> 4:09:39.360
 And that's what it means to be a human today and the motivation.

4:09:39.360 --> 4:09:42.160
 We can't very well tell the meaning of our life.

4:09:42.160 --> 4:09:44.800
 It is this mess that our descendants will be different.

4:09:44.800 --> 4:09:47.440
 They will actually know exactly what they want.

4:09:48.160 --> 4:09:49.920
 And it will be to have more descendants.

4:09:50.960 --> 4:09:52.640
 That will be the meaning for them.

4:09:52.640 --> 4:09:54.560
 Well, it's funny that you have the certainty.

4:09:54.560 --> 4:09:56.160
 You have more certainty.

4:09:56.160 --> 4:10:01.840
 You have more transparency about our descendants than you do about your own self.

4:10:01.840 --> 4:10:02.400
 Right.

4:10:02.400 --> 4:10:07.120
 So it's really interesting to think, because you mentioned this about love,

4:10:07.920 --> 4:10:13.680
 that something that's fundamental about love is this opaqueness that we're not able

4:10:13.680 --> 4:10:19.280
 to really introspect what the heck it is or all the feelings, the complex feelings.

4:10:19.280 --> 4:10:21.360
 And that's true about many of our motivations.

4:10:21.360 --> 4:10:28.480
 And that's what it means to be human of the 20th and the 21st century variety.

4:10:28.480 --> 4:10:35.840
 Why is that not a feature that we will choose to persist in civilization then?

4:10:35.840 --> 4:10:40.480
 This opaqueness, put another way, mystery, maintaining a sense of mystery

4:10:40.480 --> 4:10:42.560
 about ourselves and about those around us.

4:10:43.360 --> 4:10:45.360
 Maybe that's a really nice thing to have.

4:10:45.360 --> 4:10:46.080
 Maybe.

4:10:46.080 --> 4:10:50.880
 But, so, I mean, this is the fundamental issue in analyzing the future.

4:10:50.880 --> 4:10:52.080
 What will set the future?

4:10:52.800 --> 4:10:56.880
 One theory about what will set the future is, what do we want the future to be?

4:10:56.880 --> 4:10:57.920
 What do we want the future to be?

4:10:58.480 --> 4:11:01.440
 So under that theory, we should sit and talk about what we want the future to be,

4:11:01.440 --> 4:11:05.920
 have some conferences, have some conventions, discussion things, vote on it maybe,

4:11:05.920 --> 4:11:09.840
 and then hand out off to the implementation people to make the future the way we've

4:11:09.840 --> 4:11:10.720
 decided it should be.

4:11:12.400 --> 4:11:16.720
 That's not the actual process that's changed the world over history up to this point.

4:11:16.720 --> 4:11:20.480
 It has not been the result of us deciding what we want and making it happen.

4:11:21.360 --> 4:11:23.360
 In our individual lives, we can do that.

4:11:23.360 --> 4:11:26.800
 We might decide what career we want or where we want to live, who we want to live with.

4:11:26.800 --> 4:11:31.520
 In our individual lives, we often do slowly make our lives better according to our plan

4:11:31.520 --> 4:11:33.120
 and our things, but that's not the whole world.

4:11:34.400 --> 4:11:38.880
 The whole world so far has mostly been a competitive world where things happen if

4:11:38.880 --> 4:11:42.240
 anybody anywhere chooses to adopt them and they have an advantage.

4:11:42.240 --> 4:11:45.600
 And then it spreads and other people are forced to adopt it by competitive pressures.

4:11:46.240 --> 4:11:49.280
 So that's the kind of analysis I can use to predict the future.

4:11:49.280 --> 4:11:50.800
 And I do use that to predict the future.

4:11:50.800 --> 4:11:52.560
 It doesn't tell us it'll be a future we like.

4:11:52.560 --> 4:11:53.760
 It just tells us what it'll be.

4:11:54.640 --> 4:11:57.840
 And it'll be one where we're trying to maximize the number of our descendants.

4:11:57.840 --> 4:12:00.400
 And we know that abstractly and directly.

4:12:00.400 --> 4:12:01.600
 And it's not opaque.

4:12:01.600 --> 4:12:09.360
 With some probability that's nonzero, that will lead us to become grabby in expanding

4:12:09.920 --> 4:12:13.680
 aggressively out into the cosmos until we meet other aliens.

4:12:13.680 --> 4:12:14.720
 The timing isn't clear.

4:12:14.720 --> 4:12:17.040
 We might become grabby and then this happens.

4:12:17.040 --> 4:12:21.280
 These are, the grabbiness and this are both the result of competition, but it's less

4:12:21.280 --> 4:12:24.240
 clear which happens first.

4:12:24.240 --> 4:12:26.640
 Does this future excite you or scare you?

4:12:26.640 --> 4:12:28.080
 How do you feel about this whole thing?

4:12:28.080 --> 4:12:33.120
 Again, I told you compared to sort of a dead cosmology, at least it's energizing and having

4:12:33.120 --> 4:12:36.160
 a living story with real actors and characters and agendas, right?

4:12:36.800 --> 4:12:37.280
 Yeah.

4:12:37.280 --> 4:12:40.720
 And that's one hell of a fun universe to live in.

4:12:40.720 --> 4:12:44.480
 Robin, you're one of the most fascinating, fun people to talk to.

4:12:44.480 --> 4:12:48.800
 Brilliant, humble, systematic in your analysis.

4:12:48.800 --> 4:12:49.840
 Hold on to my wallet here.

4:12:49.840 --> 4:12:50.880
 What's he looking for?

4:12:50.880 --> 4:12:52.960
 I already stole your wallet long ago.

4:12:52.960 --> 4:12:55.440
 I really, really appreciate you spending your valuable time with me.

4:12:55.440 --> 4:12:59.600
 I hope we get a chance to talk many more times in the future.

4:12:59.600 --> 4:13:01.360
 Thank you so much for sitting down.

4:13:01.360 --> 4:13:01.860
 Thank you.

4:13:03.200 --> 4:13:05.920
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Robin Hansen.

4:13:05.920 --> 4:13:09.360

4:13:09.920 --> 4:13:13.040
 And now let me leave you with some words from Ray Bradbury.

4:13:13.840 --> 4:13:17.840
 We are an impossibility in an impossible universe.

4:13:17.840 --> 4:13:20.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
