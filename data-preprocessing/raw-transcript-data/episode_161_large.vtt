00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
 The following is a conversation with Jason Calacanis,

00:03.280 --> 00:06.920
 who's an entrepreneur, investor, author of Angel,

00:06.920 --> 00:08.920
 How to Invest in Technology Startups,

00:08.920 --> 00:13.400
 and as many people may know, he's a fun, brilliant,

00:13.400 --> 00:17.520
 long time podcast host of This Week in Startups,

00:17.520 --> 00:20.960
 and co host of the All In podcast

00:20.960 --> 00:25.640
 with Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs, and David Friedberg,

00:25.640 --> 00:28.040
 who all happen to be poker buddies

00:28.040 --> 00:30.320
 and self proclaimed besties.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.880
 The result is always a great listen

00:32.880 --> 00:37.080
 due to both the love and the heated disagreements.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.840

00:51.700 --> 00:53.960
 As a side note, let me say that I've been learning a lot

00:53.960 --> 00:56.560
 about real world finance in the past few months.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.960
 To give you a bit of context on the side,

00:58.960 --> 01:02.360
 I've studied trading from an algorithmic trading perspective

01:02.360 --> 01:04.960
 as a machine learning and a game theory problem

01:04.960 --> 01:08.320
 off and on for a few years in undergrad and grad school.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.040
 I found the distributed complex system aspect of finance

01:12.040 --> 01:14.480
 and economics in general fascinating,

01:14.480 --> 01:17.040
 but now I find even more fascinating

01:17.040 --> 01:19.040
 the human side of the whole thing,

01:19.040 --> 01:23.440
 ideas of greed, power, freedom, and truth.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.840
 Wall Street bets, Robin Hood, and the whole beautiful mess

01:26.840 --> 01:30.400
 around this topic allows us to have great conversations

01:30.400 --> 01:33.800
 about human nature and the systems that underlie

01:33.800 --> 01:36.800
 the rise and fall of civilizations.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.700
 And now, here's my conversation with Jason Kolokanis.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.540
 I have a million things to talk to you about,

01:53.540 --> 01:57.100
 but we do happen to be living through

01:57.100 --> 02:00.460
 what I would think of as a historic event

02:00.460 --> 02:04.540
 in terms of its impact, in terms of almost philosophically

02:04.540 --> 02:07.220
 thinking about the role of people

02:07.220 --> 02:09.540
 and how they can fight power

02:09.540 --> 02:13.500
 with this whole Wall Street bets and GameStop situation.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.220
 I was wondering, you've covered in your amazing

02:17.220 --> 02:19.260
 all in podcast, you guys have been having

02:19.260 --> 02:22.460
 fascinating battles over this whole situation.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.980
 I was wondering if you could tell maybe

02:23.980 --> 02:27.780
 from your perspective, as it's unrolling

02:27.780 --> 02:30.300
 the saga of Wall Street bets and GameStop,

02:30.300 --> 02:33.020
 what are some interesting insights

02:33.020 --> 02:36.780
 that you have about this whole set of events?

02:36.780 --> 02:38.860
 In full disclosure, I was an angel investor

02:38.860 --> 02:40.980
 in Robin Hood before they launched.

02:40.980 --> 02:44.760
 And when I met the founder, Vlad, and his partner,

02:44.760 --> 02:46.900
 you know, they pitched me at a bar,

02:46.900 --> 02:48.940
 not too far from where we are right now in Palo Alto,

02:48.940 --> 02:51.060
 called Antonio's Nut House.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.580
 And my friend Adeo, it's a really good story,

02:54.580 --> 02:56.100
 my friend Adeo had asked me to speak

02:56.100 --> 02:57.620
 at his founder's institute, which is kind of like

02:57.620 --> 02:59.860
 an accelerator for people who were thinking

02:59.860 --> 03:01.420
 about starting a company.

03:01.420 --> 03:02.940
 And so I gave a talk, and then he said,

03:02.940 --> 03:04.380
 hey, let's go to Antonio's Nut House

03:04.380 --> 03:07.380
 and we'll meet Elon for a drink.

03:07.380 --> 03:09.620
 And so Elon met us for a drink there.

03:09.620 --> 03:12.020
 And it's the divest of dive bars.

03:12.020 --> 03:14.540
 Like you'll take a beer and it will...

03:14.540 --> 03:15.580
 I love the image of all of this.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.700
 You hang out with Elon at a crappy bar.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.700
 Yeah, I mean, it is the worst bar in the peninsula.

03:23.900 --> 03:27.340
 Like just garbage on the floor, and like cheap beer,

03:27.340 --> 03:29.780
 and warm beer, and like you'll pick up your pint glass

03:29.780 --> 03:30.820
 and be lipstick on it.

03:30.820 --> 03:31.820
 It's brutal.

03:31.820 --> 03:32.660
 Classy.

03:32.660 --> 03:33.540
 Not your lipstick.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.740
 You understand, somebody else's lipstick.

03:35.740 --> 03:39.780
 And so we're sitting there and Vlad walks up

03:39.780 --> 03:43.380
 with his partner and he says, you're Jason Calacanis.

03:43.380 --> 03:44.820
 And I said, tell me about your startup.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.060
 He said, how do you know I have a startup?

03:46.060 --> 03:47.360
 I said, you recognize me.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.720
 And I mean, that's the only way.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.800
 And he goes, is that Elon Musk?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.240
 And I said, yes, Elon, come say hi.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.520
 And he came over and said, hi.

03:54.520 --> 03:55.360
 I said, tell me what you do.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.000
 He said, well, I'm a quant.

03:57.000 --> 03:57.920
 I said, what's that?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.960
 And he said, quantitative analysis.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.160
 And I was like, oh yeah, yeah, I know about that.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.040
 That's like you guys make algorithms

04:04.040 --> 04:05.200
 and then try to beat the market, right?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.040
 He's like, yeah.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.360
 I was like, so you're gonna pitch me on a startup

04:08.360 --> 04:10.480
 and you're gonna sell your algorithm to other people.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.080
 And if it was so good, why wouldn't you just use it yourself

04:13.080 --> 04:13.920
 and print money?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.460
 He's like, yeah, yeah, no, no, that's not our business.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.320
 Our business is we're gonna create an app

04:17.320 --> 04:19.680
 to get millennials to trade stocks.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.200
 And he said, hmm, you do realize

04:22.200 --> 04:23.880
 there's no retail investors anymore.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.480
 Like the dot com crash plus the 2008 financial crisis

04:27.480 --> 04:29.680
 eliminated any individual's belief

04:29.680 --> 04:31.720
 in participating in the stock market.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.960
 And he said, that's the opportunity.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.040
 I said, okay, I like it.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.080
 Tell me more.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.060
 He said, well, we're gonna get these millennials to trade.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.660
 I said, the same ones who live in their mom's basements

04:40.660 --> 04:43.380
 and take Uber and Lyft and are on their parents,

04:43.380 --> 04:47.400
 have no money, got screwed and went 250K into debt

04:47.400 --> 04:49.160
 for school and now can't get a job.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.600
 Those people?

04:50.600 --> 04:51.440
 And he's like, yeah.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.460
 I'm like, okay, they have no interest in their future,

04:54.460 --> 04:55.800
 but they're gonna trade stocks.

04:55.800 --> 04:56.720
 He said, yeah, that's the opportunity.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.880
 I was like, how are you gonna make money?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.120
 And he said, well, that's the best part.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.080
 It's gonna be free.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.040
 And I said, so your idea is to get a group of people

05:04.040 --> 05:06.440
 who have no interest in saving for their future

05:06.440 --> 05:08.120
 to trade and your business model is free.

05:08.120 --> 05:08.940
 And he said, yes.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.360
 I said, I'm in.

05:10.360 --> 05:14.440
 Because in almost all cases, the crazy outlandish ideas

05:14.440 --> 05:16.320
 that nobody believes in are the ones

05:16.320 --> 05:17.640
 that have the greatest returns.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.760
 I mean, Uber, I introduced to about 25 investors

05:20.760 --> 05:22.320
 and three of us said yes.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.580
 So a full 12% of the community who saw that deal

05:26.580 --> 05:27.680
 decided to do it.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.840
 So your sense about this idea being good

05:30.840 --> 05:33.920
 had to do with the fact that this guy was just crazy

05:33.920 --> 05:35.520
 and ambitious and bold thinking,

05:35.520 --> 05:37.980
 or was it that there was something here

05:37.980 --> 05:41.080
 in allowing a much larger magnitude of people

05:41.080 --> 05:42.480
 to be able to be investors?

05:42.480 --> 05:46.600
 Yeah, the way to do really well as an angel investor

05:46.600 --> 05:49.320
 or just in technology or in life

05:49.320 --> 05:51.100
 is to not say what could go wrong,

05:51.100 --> 05:52.480
 but to say what could go right.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.640
 And then to just imagine for a moment,

05:54.640 --> 05:58.140
 if it does work, what would the world look like?

05:58.140 --> 06:00.720
 And so when Elon was investing in Tesla

06:00.720 --> 06:02.760
 and some other guys were running it

06:02.760 --> 06:04.720
 and he was trying to save the company,

06:04.720 --> 06:08.160
 it wasn't, is this gonna work?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.840
 It was almost positively not gonna work.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.960
 And he knew that, but if it does work,

06:14.960 --> 06:16.320
 what does the world look like?

06:16.320 --> 06:18.240
 And so that's really what you're looking for

06:18.240 --> 06:21.860
 is not the chances of success,

06:21.860 --> 06:25.160
 but if it does succeed, what would that look like?

06:25.160 --> 06:28.840
 And that's what the world needs more people doing.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.360
 And so when you looked at Robinhood, it was like,

06:30.360 --> 06:32.680
 well, if he does succeed, what would the world look like?

06:32.680 --> 06:34.520
 And now we've seen what it looks like.

06:34.520 --> 06:39.280
 You have a generation who are so financially sophisticated

06:39.280 --> 06:41.680
 that they know how to do puts and calls

06:41.680 --> 06:44.600
 and shorts and research at a level

06:45.640 --> 06:48.560
 that dominated the hedge fund industry.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.520
 So let's pause for a second.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.980
 These traders sitting there on a subreddit

06:52.980 --> 06:56.800
 in a discord server are able to do analysis and research

06:56.800 --> 06:58.880
 and then act in unison to say,

06:58.880 --> 07:03.400
 we're going to beat in the Robinhood sense,

07:03.400 --> 07:05.240
 this group of sophisticated insiders

07:05.240 --> 07:08.040
 who have more access and more access to capital,

07:08.040 --> 07:11.120
 but we will figure out how to solve this problem.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.900
 And most things don't work.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.280
 It's like the Wikipedia.

07:16.280 --> 07:21.280
 There's no way the Wikipedia would ever work, except it did.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.480
 You're like, how is this ever gonna work?

07:23.480 --> 07:24.960
 You're not paying anybody,

07:24.960 --> 07:27.680
 but it's both the largest corpus of an encyclopedia ever.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.880
 So I think Robinhood actually succeeded.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.160
 And then what we saw was this system

07:33.160 --> 07:35.200
 and a lot of the systems in our society,

07:35.200 --> 07:37.240
 whether it's the political system,

07:37.240 --> 07:39.940
 the constitution of the United States,

07:39.940 --> 07:42.960
 education, higher education, which you're involved in,

07:42.960 --> 07:44.640
 and then even the financial system,

07:44.640 --> 07:47.500
 we have not stress tested and stress tested it,

07:47.500 --> 07:50.360
 and we don't actually know all the edge cases

07:50.360 --> 07:51.260
 and how it works.

07:51.260 --> 07:54.800
 So Trump was able to just really put this crazy stress test.

07:56.460 --> 07:59.160
 Is the democracy going to hold?

07:59.160 --> 08:01.360
 Are we gonna break this two or three,

08:01.360 --> 08:03.400
 200 someone year old experiment?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.720
 And then we looked at the financial markets

08:04.720 --> 08:07.820
 and it turns out there were more people shorting the stock

08:07.820 --> 08:10.160
 than stocks and shares were available.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.560
 I don't know how that's possible.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.200
 And then I'm trying to uncover,

08:13.200 --> 08:15.040
 where can I see a list of people who have shorted the stock?

08:15.040 --> 08:16.640
 And it's like, you can't,

08:16.640 --> 08:19.320
 but we can tell you sort of how many every two weeks

08:19.320 --> 08:21.660
 or maybe twice a week, we can create a report.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.080
 Maybe we know.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.760
 I was surprised that nobody knows

08:24.760 --> 08:26.200
 the list of people who were shorted

08:26.200 --> 08:27.760
 and you guys are trying to figure that out.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.000
 Yeah, there's no transparency on a lot of these systems.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.480
 And if you call to try to short a stock,

08:32.480 --> 08:34.040
 it's almost like they'll tell you on the phone,

08:34.040 --> 08:35.420
 let me see, I think I might know a guy

08:35.420 --> 08:37.040
 who has shares to loan out.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.840
 So it's like, am I calling to try to find

08:39.840 --> 08:43.840
 like a 73 Mustang Grande in gold?

08:43.840 --> 08:45.160
 You're gonna call around, it's like,

08:45.160 --> 08:47.680
 shouldn't this be like on a ledger somewhere

08:47.680 --> 08:49.180
 and be completely transparent?

08:49.180 --> 08:50.920
 So now we're seeing those things.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.920
 And I think the investigations will make it super clear.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.040
 But of course, in a vacuum without information,

08:57.040 --> 08:58.800
 there are so many investors in these startups

08:58.800 --> 09:00.600
 that conflicts can start to appear.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.880
 And then you know how it is with people

09:01.880 --> 09:05.880
 in conspiracy theories, the mind starts to wander, right?

09:05.880 --> 09:08.660
 And so in some cases, there is actually a conspiracy.

09:08.660 --> 09:11.840
 And then in other cases, people's mind will fill in like,

09:11.840 --> 09:13.360
 oh my God, there's some grand conspiracy here.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.080
 I can tell you Robinhood's only goal

09:15.080 --> 09:17.040
 is to get more people to trade stocks

09:17.040 --> 09:18.920
 and to democratize it even more.

09:18.920 --> 09:23.920
 And they apparently were on the brink of seizing as an entity

09:24.920 --> 09:28.080
 if they didn't get more money to cover all these trades.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.120
 I mean, they were on the brink

09:30.120 --> 09:32.200
 and they raised $3.5 billion or something like that

09:32.200 --> 09:33.040
 in a week.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.280
 Yeah, so in some sense, Robinhood enabled this very,

09:37.280 --> 09:39.340
 like the magic of this distributed system

09:39.340 --> 09:41.040
 of WallStreetBets, right?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.320
 You said Wikipedia, which is another,

09:43.320 --> 09:45.400
 which is probably one of my favorite websites

09:45.400 --> 09:48.700
 and one of my favorite examples of like a distributed system

09:48.700 --> 09:50.460
 somehow coming together in a way,

09:50.460 --> 09:53.400
 just like you said at that crappy bar,

09:53.400 --> 09:55.440
 I would have guessed it would never work.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.720
 But if it does work, it changes everything and it did.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.440
 And Robinhood in that same way probably enabled

10:02.440 --> 10:05.240
 or was one of the major enablers of WallStreetBets

10:05.240 --> 10:10.240
 of giving power, like empowering young kids to learn

10:10.720 --> 10:13.760
 about how this whole messy financial system works

10:13.760 --> 10:17.660
 and take on the big elite centralized players.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.000
 Yes, and it's very easy.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.480
 When these companies get big,

10:21.480 --> 10:26.240
 one thing that's changed is the footprint of these startups

10:26.240 --> 10:28.080
 and the velocity at which they grow.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.160
 So something like Airbnb is another perfect example

10:30.160 --> 10:33.080
 of something that should really not work in practice,

10:33.080 --> 10:33.960
 but it does.

10:33.960 --> 10:38.040
 Like I'm gonna rent my couch or my extra room to somebody

10:38.040 --> 10:39.120
 like a serial killer,

10:39.120 --> 10:41.200
 or I'm gonna stay in somebody's house,

10:41.200 --> 10:42.300
 like a serial killer's house.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.720
 And it's like, it really sounds scary,

10:44.720 --> 10:49.200
 but it actually works and it has not destroyed

10:49.200 --> 10:51.200
 the hotel business.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.680
 It has added.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.960
 So the best startups induce a market to exist.

10:55.960 --> 11:00.960
 If you look at Uber or Airbnb, people replace their cars

11:01.640 --> 11:05.400
 and Uber was not competing ultimately with taxis.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.400
 They were competing with car ownership,

11:07.400 --> 11:11.680
 public transportation, walking, or just not going out.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
 And then you look at Airbnb,

11:12.680 --> 11:14.280
 a lot of people who stay in an Airbnb

11:14.280 --> 11:17.440
 would not be taking a trip to Kyoto,

11:17.440 --> 11:20.760
 if not for the fact that they could get a $75 beautiful room

11:20.760 --> 11:24.600
 with great reviews in Kyoto for three weeks.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.960
 It inspires people and it manifests the market

11:27.960 --> 11:30.520
 because the product is so transcendent, right?

11:30.520 --> 11:33.400
 And I think that's one of the things that Robinhood did.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.040
 You can't learn how to do this options trading

11:36.040 --> 11:38.680
 and puts and calls and all this sophistication stuff,

11:38.680 --> 11:40.040
 unless you actually do it.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.400
 It's just too hard to learn except in practice,

11:42.400 --> 11:43.440
 just like poker.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.600
 If you wanna learn how to play poker or guitar

11:45.600 --> 11:47.960
 or tennis or skiing, like you can talk about it.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.320
 You can watch YouTube videos,

11:49.320 --> 11:51.160
 but at a certain point, you gotta get on the mountain.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.320
 At a certain point, you gotta put some chips in the pot

11:54.320 --> 11:55.960
 and it's gonna be painful.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.120
 Like poker is gonna be painful.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.240
 You're gonna lose a lot of money

11:58.240 --> 11:59.840
 and that's why you should play at the small tables first.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.240
 And even in trading, like you look at people

12:02.240 --> 12:04.880
 who are doing this crazy trading and GameStop,

12:04.880 --> 12:07.840
 a company that's worth maybe a couple of billion dollars,

12:07.840 --> 12:10.000
 but certainly not tens of billions of dollars.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.080
 Of course, the people who are throwing their money in last

12:12.080 --> 12:13.240
 are gonna lose it.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.480
 I think everybody knew that.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.760
 And so it was a momentum play

12:16.760 --> 12:19.520
 and they're betting against the hedge funds.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.160
 So I think it's good for people to learn

12:22.160 --> 12:23.480
 and become financially literate

12:23.480 --> 12:27.640
 and just always understand the concept of the risk of ruin.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.040
 The good news is for a young person,

12:29.040 --> 12:31.760
 the risk of ruin might be like they lose $5,000 or something

12:31.760 --> 12:33.640
 and then they have to build their stack back up.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.240
 But that's really the only thing I am concerned about

12:36.240 --> 12:40.320
 is there are people who will play poker or blackjack

12:40.320 --> 12:43.080
 or sports betting or whatever it is and lose control.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.680
 Just like there might be people who try alcohol

12:45.680 --> 12:46.640
 and lose control.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.920
 But we can't build a system based upon limiting

12:51.000 --> 12:53.200
 the average person's behavior based upon somebody

12:53.200 --> 12:56.520
 who can't control their ability to drink.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.120
 Two glasses of wine instead of 20.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.240
 How does this whole thing end?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.800
 Probably in tears.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.640
 For who?

13:02.640 --> 13:03.480
 Yeah.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.320
 Who's crying?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.160
 Is everybody crying?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.000
 Exactly.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.840
 Who's crying when?

13:06.840 --> 13:08.040
 So I think there were some of the hedge funds

13:08.040 --> 13:09.200
 that were crying initially.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.920
 That maybe some of the Wall Street Bets people

13:10.920 --> 13:13.000
 who bought last would be crying.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.840
 And then eventually there's probably another set

13:15.840 --> 13:19.080
 of hedge funds or even the Wall Street Bets mob

13:19.080 --> 13:22.240
 and that army, some of them might've broke ranks

13:22.240 --> 13:23.720
 and then shorted the stock.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.760
 So nobody knows.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.960
 So everybody has to be aware of what's happening

13:26.960 --> 13:27.920
 in the game.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.720
 So if Wall Street Bets said, hey, let's squeeze

13:29.720 --> 13:32.080
 these hedge funds because they have too much short interest.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.800
 Let's all buy the stock.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.640
 Then some of them might've said, okay,

13:35.640 --> 13:37.800
 you know, it's at two or $300.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.640
 Maybe I'll join the short movement now that they've covered.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.600
 And they could have shorted their been like double agent.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.920
 So people have to understand like this stuff is gnarly

13:46.920 --> 13:48.360
 and it's a free for all.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.800
 I mean, it is a literal free for all.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.440
 There's a kind of morality,

13:51.440 --> 13:54.320
 like a big statement that Wall Street Bets made

13:54.320 --> 13:57.680
 in terms of like the elites can't just push us around.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.520
 They can't bully around.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.440
 But at the same time, you know,

14:01.440 --> 14:03.480
 they're also interested in making money, right?

14:03.480 --> 14:05.920
 What's your sense?

14:05.920 --> 14:08.040
 You said that some of the people in the Wall Street Bets

14:08.040 --> 14:10.360
 might've broken off and shorted the stock.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.920
 Are they more interested?

14:11.920 --> 14:15.280
 There was an emergent like morality that emerged

14:15.280 --> 14:17.960
 and said like, we're not gonna put up

14:17.960 --> 14:19.440
 with the centralized elites,

14:19.440 --> 14:22.440
 but is that going to continue?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.600
 Are they going to fight the power structures

14:24.600 --> 14:26.280
 that are bad for society?

14:26.280 --> 14:28.680
 Or are they going to now like,

14:28.680 --> 14:31.040
 I mean, are they ultimately going to introduce more chaos

14:31.040 --> 14:33.440
 that's going to damage the economy and damage the world?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.520
 Or are they going to continue being the good guys

14:35.520 --> 14:40.520
 and fighting the evils that manipulate the market?

14:40.520 --> 14:41.920
 What's your sense?

14:41.920 --> 14:44.640
 You know, it really feels like the Dark Knight series

14:44.640 --> 14:46.360
 of films where like some people

14:46.360 --> 14:48.000
 just want to see the world burn.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.760
 I think there is a contingent of people

14:49.760 --> 14:52.200
 who just literally want to see chaos.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.000
 Like, you know that contingent on some of these forums

14:56.000 --> 14:58.640
 who just want to create chaos, right?

14:58.640 --> 15:00.520
 So there's certainly that chaos contingent,

15:00.520 --> 15:02.360
 but I think overall what the arc will show

15:02.360 --> 15:05.200
 is a group of people getting massively educated.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.840
 You see it in crypto as well.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.640
 There was like a three year period

15:08.640 --> 15:13.080
 where all of these failed entrepreneurs who I knew

15:13.080 --> 15:17.440
 who couldn't build companies were then coming back to me

15:17.440 --> 15:19.760
 after their companies has failed or after they gave up

15:19.760 --> 15:21.000
 or couldn't clear market raising money

15:21.000 --> 15:22.800
 with the venture capital community

15:22.800 --> 15:24.760
 and they were doing ICOs.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.560
 And I was like, I met you before, right?

15:27.560 --> 15:28.400
 And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.320
 No, I'm doing an ICO now.

15:29.320 --> 15:32.440
 I'm like, okay, where's your company at?

15:32.440 --> 15:33.680
 And they're like, here's a white paper.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.480
 And I was like, this white paper with spelling errors in it

15:36.480 --> 15:39.240
 that says you're going to destroy Airbnb

15:39.240 --> 15:40.720
 because everybody's apartment

15:40.720 --> 15:42.760
 is gonna be on an immutable ledger.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.800
 Like, wouldn't that be better in a regular database

15:44.800 --> 15:46.640
 that was private and not public?

15:46.640 --> 15:48.640
 Like, why does it need to be on an immutable ledger?

15:48.640 --> 15:49.480
 It can't change.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.960
 I'm like, not changing the database is a feature?

15:52.960 --> 15:54.760
 That does not seem like a good feature.

15:54.760 --> 15:55.600
 And they couldn't explain it.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.520
 They're like, well, just people are interested in ICOs.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.240
 And there was that ICO mania.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.840
 And what it showed was there's a global appetite for risk.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.040
 People want to try new things.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.080
 This is one of the great things about the human spirit

16:07.080 --> 16:09.200
 is one of the great things about capitalism.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.400
 And one of the things that concerns me most

16:11.400 --> 16:12.480
 about where we're at in society

16:12.480 --> 16:15.480
 is the sort of socialism, communism,

16:17.080 --> 16:19.680
 entrepreneurship is bad, technology is bad,

16:19.680 --> 16:21.480
 and polarization of wealth,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.280
 and people getting rich is a bad thing.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.880
 When I grew up, I'm 50 now,

16:24.880 --> 16:26.600
 but when I was a Gen Xer growing up,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.280
 we kind of maybe too much idolized Bill Gates

16:29.280 --> 16:31.160
 and people who were doing interesting things in the world.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.960
 And we thought capitalism was a force for good.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.720
 I still believe capitalism is a force for good

16:35.720 --> 16:39.400
 because when a group of people build a product or service

16:39.400 --> 16:42.480
 that changes the world and it gets globally distributed,

16:42.480 --> 16:46.040
 whether it's Tesla or SpaceX or Google or Airbnb

16:46.040 --> 16:47.440
 or Uber or Robinhood,

16:48.680 --> 16:51.960
 everybody gets to benefit from that product or service

16:51.960 --> 16:52.920
 having to compete.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.000
 And if you look at the places where there's no competition

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
 like public education or less established colleges

17:00.000 --> 17:00.840
 and something like that,

17:00.840 --> 17:03.360
 less competition for accreditation degrees,

17:03.360 --> 17:06.200
 like things tend to get a little weird, don't they?

17:06.200 --> 17:09.040
 And people tend to be protected and that's not good.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.440
 You need competition.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.720
 Doesn't mean that people shouldn't have global healthcare.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.000
 It doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a safety net,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.920
 but we need to keep capitalism vibrant,

17:18.920 --> 17:22.080
 especially because China has now coopted capitalism

17:22.080 --> 17:24.640
 and created their own version of capitalism,

17:24.640 --> 17:26.640
 which is communism with capitalism.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.040
 It's like this weird operating system

17:28.040 --> 17:30.160
 like we still want to keep communism

17:30.160 --> 17:33.240
 so we can take any of your gains at any time,

17:33.240 --> 17:35.120
 but we'd like you to be entrepreneurial.

17:35.120 --> 17:40.120
 And then you have somebody like the founder of Alibaba,

17:40.200 --> 17:42.880
 Jack Ma, who disappears for a couple of weeks.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.720
 Who's that?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.000
 No, I'm just kidding.

17:45.000 --> 17:45.840
 Who's Jack Ma?

17:45.840 --> 17:48.280
 I was like, he kind of disappears for a couple of weeks

17:48.280 --> 17:49.960
 and then he comes back and he's really sorry

17:49.960 --> 17:52.800
 about the things he said and then he disappears again.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.400
 And like, we have to be very careful.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.800
 You know, we have to be very careful if China wins

17:58.800 --> 18:03.280
 capitalism, this is going to be an existential threat

18:03.280 --> 18:05.440
 for humanity.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.640
 The Chinese are no joke.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.920
 I mean, they are seriously focused

18:09.920 --> 18:11.960
 and they are picking the winners.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.920
 It's a very weird system because it is in fact,

18:14.920 --> 18:15.960
 I don't know what you call it.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.360
 Like communism and capitalism is such a overloaded terms,

18:19.360 --> 18:22.320
 but they do encourage entrepreneurship,

18:22.320 --> 18:25.000
 but they, and they do a good job of it.

18:25.000 --> 18:25.840
 Oh, yes.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.960
 But then they're like, they're like the surveillance thing

18:28.960 --> 18:31.000
 and they're controlling things in a way.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.840
 It's weird because it seems to work really well for them

18:35.720 --> 18:36.640
 in the short term.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.360
 Yes, it's definitely got short term benefits.

18:38.360 --> 18:42.480
 So the question is like, how that gets distorted

18:42.480 --> 18:44.360
 and it becomes worse and worse and worse,

18:44.360 --> 18:45.800
 which it potentially might be.

18:45.800 --> 18:50.800
 And I think on, you know, the entrepreneurial spirit,

18:51.680 --> 18:53.840
 which you have a podcast all centered

18:53.840 --> 18:56.240
 around the entrepreneurial spirit,

18:56.240 --> 18:59.200
 is one of the magical things that makes this country great.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.200
 I don't know if money is deeply tied into that.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.320
 I do get bothered by people, you know,

19:05.320 --> 19:08.440
 treating the word billionaires if it's a bad word.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.120
 But in general, like all the hard things,

19:12.120 --> 19:14.200
 all the difficult things we're going through in this country,

19:14.200 --> 19:17.280
 it seems like the way out is going to be

19:19.440 --> 19:22.920
 making the entrepreneur the hero of society

19:22.920 --> 19:26.400
 of like letting that young kid with a big dream

19:26.400 --> 19:28.200
 and the guts to take the big risks

19:28.200 --> 19:29.800
 and build something totally new,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
 giving them a chance and whatever that involves.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.520
 I don't think it's about taxes.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.720
 I don't think it's about like regulation, all that stuff.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.120
 It's about us and just public discourse saying

19:42.120 --> 19:45.680
 that kid, that guy, that girl, they're bad asses.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.440
 Like encourage them to do it.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.800
 We have to have people buy in

19:49.800 --> 19:52.640
 to the fact that they have that opportunity.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.360
 And I think one of the problems in society is

19:55.360 --> 19:57.840
 there's a group of people who actually don't believe

19:57.840 --> 20:00.240
 that they can succeed or they don't believe

20:00.240 --> 20:02.960
 even more perniciously that other people can.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.440
 And that's the group of people that I think are highly vocal

20:06.440 --> 20:07.840
 but a small group of people,

20:07.840 --> 20:11.600
 which are generally people of incredible privilege,

20:11.600 --> 20:15.360
 rich parents, white city dwellers, liberals.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.520
 They kind of look and say,

20:16.520 --> 20:18.880
 poor people cannot change it a lot.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.680
 And they're battling in their minds

20:21.680 --> 20:23.320
 to protect poor people.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.480
 But they have this very weird

20:24.480 --> 20:26.160
 patriarchal kind of approach to it,

20:26.160 --> 20:28.320
 which is they think that they're not capable

20:28.320 --> 20:29.720
 of changing their lot in life.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.480
 And they're like, it's not possible.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.280
 And then once in a while, I'll tweet something where I say,

20:34.280 --> 20:36.680
 it's really incredible that every piece of knowledge

20:36.680 --> 20:39.840
 you could possibly want is now available for free on YouTube.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.880
 And every course from MIT and Harvard and Stanford

20:43.880 --> 20:46.200
 is available on edX or Coursera.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.240
 And all that information is there freely available.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.960
 And you can take the lectures.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.800
 This is amazing.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.800
 And then people will be like,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.360
 yeah, but people don't have access to it.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.840
 I'm like, they do.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.680
 It's free.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.520
 Here's the link.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.400
 And they're like, yeah, but they don't have internet.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.360
 And I'm like, here's the chart

21:01.360 --> 21:03.560
 of internet penetration in America.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.080
 And they're like, well, poor people don't have internet.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.400
 And I'm like, really?

21:07.400 --> 21:11.200
 Find me any downtrodden person without a smartphone

21:11.200 --> 21:12.400
 with a high speed connection

21:12.400 --> 21:16.400
 that capitalism provided for $12 a month or $15 a month.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.240
 It's very hard to find that.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.960
 And we have it so well in this country

21:20.960 --> 21:22.600
 and there's so much opportunity,

21:23.720 --> 21:25.720
 but people don't believe it.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.200
 And that's actually one of the problems.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.440
 See, the average American still watches

21:28.440 --> 21:30.560
 four or five hours of television a day.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.000
 And often I meet people and they're like,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.600
 I need a technical co founder.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.600
 But all I need is a million dollars.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.840
 And I'm like, okay, well, what is your skill?

21:37.840 --> 21:39.280
 And they don't have a skill.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.600
 And I'm like, well, are you a designer?

21:41.600 --> 21:42.440
 No.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.260
 Are you a product manager?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.100
 No.

21:44.100 --> 21:44.940
 Are you a developer?

21:44.940 --> 21:45.760
 No.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.600
 Are you a sales executive?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.440
 No.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.280
 Do you have an idea?

21:48.280 --> 21:50.080
 Well, as my friend, Sam Harris,

21:50.080 --> 21:53.060
 I think your friend as well says like,

21:53.060 --> 21:55.320
 everybody has like a million ideas an hour.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.160
 Like you don't really get credit for those.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.760
 Even when you're asleep, your idea is spewing ideas.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.640
 Like zero credit for your ideas.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.240
 It's all about execution.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.080
 And we're seeing.

22:04.080 --> 22:04.920
 You have to believe that you yourself

22:04.920 --> 22:06.840
 can be the core of that execution.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.960
 You yourself can build the thing in every,

22:08.960 --> 22:10.960
 no matter what your circumstances are.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.200
 I mean, we could talk about like structural racism

22:13.200 --> 22:15.320
 and all those kinds of things that push things down.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.320
 But from the individual perspective,

22:17.320 --> 22:18.680
 when you just like are coaching

22:18.680 --> 22:20.800
 or giving advice to an individual,

22:20.800 --> 22:22.080
 you can literally change the world.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.160
 I mean, Wall Street Bets is an indication of that

22:24.160 --> 22:27.000
 in the financial space that you yourself can have,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.120
 can change the world.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.240
 That's why this country is amazing.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.600
 Still the best country in the world, right?

22:31.600 --> 22:33.960
 I mean, it still is amazing the opportunity

22:33.960 --> 22:35.360
 provided to people.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.440
 All this educational experience is online.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.720
 And the ability, what I tell young people

22:39.720 --> 22:42.080
 who are looking for advice, I say,

22:42.080 --> 22:43.880
 the skill you need to refine

22:43.880 --> 22:45.960
 is the ability to learn new skills.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.160
 Like if you become good at learning a new skill,

22:49.160 --> 22:52.680
 and Tim Ferriss, a friend of mine has really pioneered this,

22:52.680 --> 22:57.680
 he can get to 60 or 70% of like the knowledge

22:57.680 --> 23:00.320
 in a skill in some incredibly short period of time.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.760
 And I'm not saying he's gonna become a virtuoso drummer

23:02.760 --> 23:03.800
 or a great basketball player,

23:03.800 --> 23:06.280
 but Tim and I were on vacation together

23:06.280 --> 23:07.760
 in like a group vacation in Italy

23:07.760 --> 23:09.520
 and there was a basketball court.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.720
 And I said, let's go shoot some hoops.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.040
 I'd never shot before.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.120
 And I was like, okay, come on, I'll teach you.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.640
 And Tim is fabulously uncoordinated.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.880
 People don't know this.

23:18.880 --> 23:23.880
 Like he tried to dribble a basketball and do a layup

23:24.160 --> 23:26.600
 and it looked like he had a blindfold on.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.800
 I mean, you've never seen something less elegant

23:29.800 --> 23:32.000
 than Tim Ferriss doing a layup in basketball.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.680
 And then he watched me do it three or four times

23:34.680 --> 23:37.160
 and I watched him study me.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.280
 And listen, I've been playing basketball in Brooklyn

23:39.280 --> 23:40.400
 since I was a kid.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.120
 I got a couple of moves and he was just taking notes

23:43.120 --> 23:44.400
 and taking notes and taking notes.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.960
 And by the end of a couple of hours of doing this,

23:46.960 --> 23:48.800
 I could just watch him checking his form

23:48.800 --> 23:50.520
 and figuring it out.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.800
 That's every skill in the world now.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.440
 And what I tell people is like, I'm like,

23:55.440 --> 23:56.520
 did you watch Game of Thrones?

23:56.520 --> 23:57.880
 And they're like, yeah.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.720
 Watch Breaking Bad?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.400
 Like, yeah, I'm like, okay, that's about 400 hours.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.160
 How about you don't watch the next two

24:05.160 --> 24:06.720
 and you put that 400 hours into learning

24:06.720 --> 24:09.640
 how to be a graphic designer, a UX person,

24:09.640 --> 24:13.800
 a developer, whatever it is and learn how to add skills.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.760
 That's what I did my whole life.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.120
 I was a kid from Brooklyn, went to school at night,

24:17.120 --> 24:20.200
 but I was very quick to get to maybe 50%

24:20.200 --> 24:22.080
 of the knowledge base of graphic design

24:22.080 --> 24:24.360
 or being a writer or being a sales executive,

24:24.360 --> 24:26.520
 whatever it was, a developer even.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.080
 And I was just good enough to not have people

24:29.080 --> 24:31.440
 be able to bullshit me like when I hired them.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.520
 And that was a big unlock.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.840
 When you know enough that people can't snow you,

24:35.840 --> 24:36.840
 that's a really good one.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.520
 And look at yourself.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.560
 You figured out how to set up an entire podcast,

24:40.560 --> 24:41.400
 people don't know this,

24:41.400 --> 24:43.240
 but you don't have a team around you.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.360
 I have a team of like five, six people working on my podcast.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.120
 With even knowing enough about to set this up,

24:48.120 --> 24:50.000
 you would then be able to hire a team.

24:50.000 --> 24:50.840
 Correct.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.040
 And you'll be able to call them on their bullshit

24:52.040 --> 24:53.720
 if they're not doing a good job.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.560
 And that's really important.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.240
 And I don't know that much about this whole thing,

24:56.240 --> 24:58.280
 but I know enough to be able to then see

24:58.280 --> 24:59.960
 who knows their stuff and not.

24:59.960 --> 25:00.800
 You're absolutely right.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.640
 And the process of learning how to learn

25:03.640 --> 25:08.640
 is essential there because I did martial arts,

25:08.720 --> 25:09.880
 jiu jitsu and so on.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.400
 And it's so funny to watch.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.240
 I did Taekwondo, yeah.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.560
 Taekwondo is awesome.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.040
 It's funny that there's some people

25:15.040 --> 25:17.520
 that do an activity for years,

25:17.520 --> 25:19.920
 because just sort of elaborate on something

25:19.920 --> 25:21.840
 you were saying about hours.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.960
 It's not always the amount of hours,

25:24.960 --> 25:26.680
 it's the quality that you put in.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.680
 Deliberate practice versus just doing some behavior.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.480
 I mean, literally I've been playing chess

25:31.480 --> 25:33.040
 and trying to get that going again

25:33.040 --> 25:35.520
 after watching Queen's Gambit and I got chess.com.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.680
 And I realized I was just playing

25:36.680 --> 25:37.520
 and I'm not getting better.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.360
 And then I was like, oh wait,

25:38.360 --> 25:40.640
 there's a little analysis feature here in chess.com

25:40.640 --> 25:43.160
 where it will show you your blunders and mistakes.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.440
 And I'm like, oh, I'm spending no time

25:45.440 --> 25:47.640
 reviewing my losses in chess

25:47.640 --> 25:49.120
 and I just wanna play the next game.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.880
 I should really review these losses

25:50.880 --> 25:52.080
 and figure out what mistakes I made.

25:52.080 --> 25:52.920
 And when I started doing that,

25:52.920 --> 25:54.920
 I was like, oh, I'm getting better.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.400
 So some deliberate practice really works.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.160
 And if you wanna take it all the way,

25:58.160 --> 26:00.440
 Magnus Carlsen, shout out to the guy,

26:00.440 --> 26:03.200
 he has an app, but there's a few other coaching apps

26:03.200 --> 26:04.880
 where you focus on the end game,

26:04.880 --> 26:07.320
 you focus drilling a particular,

26:07.320 --> 26:09.120
 you basically don't play the game at all.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.960
 You just focus on drilling the different aspects.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.000
 The openings, the end game, the end game, yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.320
 And there's different kinds of puzzles.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.080
 So you can really make it into a deliberate practice.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.720
 Not to make this episode sponsored by chess.com,

26:20.720 --> 26:22.200
 but they literally have puzzles.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.040
 So I was like, oh, and it's $100 a year for this product.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.520
 And I just thought to myself, this is capitalism.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.640
 They don't need to charge you $100 an hour for a lesson.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.120
 They can charge you $100

26:34.120 --> 26:36.280
 and they've created the ability for you to play chess

26:36.280 --> 26:38.320
 24 hours a day against opponents

26:38.320 --> 26:41.520
 who are perfectly matched against you based on your rating.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.120
 And they analyze every game and they have puzzles

26:44.120 --> 26:46.320
 and they have tutorials and they've got everything else.

26:46.320 --> 26:50.320
 It's like, just think about how much value

26:50.320 --> 26:53.440
 is being provided to society because of capitalism

26:53.440 --> 26:54.480
 and because competition.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.320
 If you want things to get better

26:56.320 --> 26:58.120
 and you wanna step up your game,

26:58.120 --> 26:59.680
 just make it slightly competitive.

26:59.680 --> 27:03.480
 It is one of these things in human existence

27:03.480 --> 27:05.040
 that is so powerful.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.120
 I don't know, did you see the Michael Jordan documentary,

27:07.120 --> 27:08.080
 The Last Dance?

27:08.080 --> 27:10.480
 Like half of it, I'm still working through it.

27:10.480 --> 27:14.320
 He's so competitive and petty.

27:14.320 --> 27:19.000
 It's so inspiring that all he cares about is just winning

27:19.000 --> 27:21.160
 to the level of which he literally,

27:21.160 --> 27:23.960
 there's like this running meme, I took that personally

27:23.960 --> 27:24.840
 and I took that person.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.480
 I don't know if you've seen the images of him

27:26.480 --> 27:27.600
 sitting smoking a cigar,

27:27.600 --> 27:29.400
 looking at like an iPad or a video clip

27:29.400 --> 27:30.960
 and it's like, I took that personally.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.040
 And you can make a super cut

27:32.040 --> 27:33.720
 of every time he took something personally,

27:33.720 --> 27:35.400
 he literally takes everything personally

27:35.400 --> 27:38.320
 to give himself that competitive motivation to win.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.920
 That's capitalism.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.080
 And when people are competing,

27:42.080 --> 27:46.600
 man, look at what Elon did to the space of cars.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.360
 Like every, they were literally laughing at him

27:49.360 --> 27:50.720
 in the first 10 years.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.360
 Electric cars, ha ha, that company will go out of business.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.600
 And now every single company is like,

27:55.600 --> 27:58.400
 we're going fully electric by 2035.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.240
 And he kicked their asses so brutally

28:02.240 --> 28:05.760
 that they had no choice but then to step up their game.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.280
 And that's what we want, right?

28:07.280 --> 28:09.320
 And this virus and this pandemic,

28:09.320 --> 28:12.880
 I think the great thing that will come out

28:12.880 --> 28:15.120
 of this horrible experience that we've all had

28:15.120 --> 28:17.640
 is psychologically death, learning,

28:17.640 --> 28:19.080
 just so many bad things occurred,

28:19.080 --> 28:21.080
 the economy, people losing their jobs.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.800
 But we also got to see the human spirit

28:22.800 --> 28:27.200
 with these mRNA vaccines and just how,

28:27.200 --> 28:29.400
 if we took out some of the regulation

28:29.400 --> 28:31.280
 and people were super motivated,

28:31.280 --> 28:33.880
 we might actually be able to eliminate

28:33.880 --> 28:38.520
 all pandemics from ever happening again.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.840
 And before that, Bill Gates was banging his fist

28:40.840 --> 28:43.720
 and Jeff Skoll was doing the movie Contagion.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.960
 I mean, for two decades, people have been banging their fist.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.640
 We have to be prepared for this.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.680
 And everybody's like, yeah, whatever, YOLO.

28:49.680 --> 28:50.800
 It's not gonna happen.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.040
 And now it's happened and people are like,

28:53.040 --> 28:57.600
 we need to be able to destroy every pandemic and virus

28:57.600 --> 28:58.440
 before it happens.

28:58.440 --> 29:01.640
 And listen, you know a lot more about science than I do,

29:01.640 --> 29:04.400
 but these mRNA has been around for a while.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.920
 We've just never gotten aggressive about doing it.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.120
 And then you think about challenge trials.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.240
 I don't know if you've been following this,

29:10.240 --> 29:13.640
 but they're doing challenge trials now in the UK this month

29:13.640 --> 29:17.480
 where they're introducing COVID into healthy young patients

29:17.480 --> 29:19.920
 and then giving them the vaccine or, you know.

29:19.920 --> 29:24.440
 And that is against all rules and regulations

29:24.440 --> 29:27.280
 about do no harm.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.040
 But then you think about it.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.480
 We kind of celebrate people jumping out of planes

29:31.480 --> 29:33.560
 and we got that one guy, Alex Honnold,

29:33.560 --> 29:35.320
 who's climbing up mountains without a rope

29:35.320 --> 29:37.200
 and they give him a North Star, you know,

29:37.200 --> 29:41.680
 back page ad and an endorsement deal.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.840
 And we celebrate that.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.040
 We celebrate people surfing with sharks.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.560
 We celebrate people doing deep welding.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.440
 We pay them extra to go 200 feet underground

29:50.440 --> 29:51.720
 and weld stuff.

29:51.720 --> 29:57.360
 And people do dangerous stuff all day long, astronauts.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.840
 But we won't, soldiers, firefighters,

30:00.840 --> 30:04.560
 but we won't let people get paid to do a challenge trial.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.800
 Yeah, we're weirdly risk averse in certain areas

30:06.800 --> 30:08.080
 that completely don't make any sense.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.120
 And this is where the world needs it.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.280
 We could have said these thousand people, young people,

30:13.280 --> 30:14.840
 who we know are in all likelihood

30:14.840 --> 30:16.600
 not going to have a bad outcome,

30:16.600 --> 30:17.520
 but there's a possibility.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.360
 There's a possibility.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.200
 But it's very low.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.040
 It's certainly lower than riding a motorcycle.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.240
 It's lower than riding a motorcycle.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.400
 People ride motorcycles everywhere.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.120
 We have ads for motorcycles.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.480
 We could have just said to those thousand people,

30:27.480 --> 30:30.800
 we'll give you a million dollars each to do this.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.480
 Okay, there's your billion dollars.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.080
 We're printing trillions of dollars of money

30:35.080 --> 30:35.920
 to deal with this.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.800
 If we had just done a thousand people

30:37.800 --> 30:40.880
 for a million dollars each to do a challenge trial

30:40.880 --> 30:45.800
 in March, April, May, when they had the mRNA vaccines ready,

30:45.800 --> 30:47.480
 we could have deployed the vaccines in the summer.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.160
 We would have been done with this.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.600
 We would have been over by now.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.720
 So we get to challenge all of that thinking.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.520
 I think that's what the great pause did.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.240
 It's letting everybody challenge that thinking is,

30:57.240 --> 30:58.640
 why do we have that rule?

30:58.640 --> 31:01.600
 Okay, yeah, we don't want to have people,

31:01.600 --> 31:03.840
 you know, like give up their organs for money.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.520
 Like we obviously understand,

31:05.520 --> 31:08.040
 but there's a reasonable discussion about,

31:08.040 --> 31:10.640
 well, maybe there's a level of risk in a global pandemic.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.640
 I mean, we fought the Nazis, right?

31:12.640 --> 31:13.880
 We defeated the Nazis.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.440
 That took a lot of deaths to do that,

31:15.440 --> 31:17.920
 but we had to kill that evil.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.760
 This is another evil, which we must fight.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.720
 And it's going to result in,

31:22.720 --> 31:24.840
 it's already resulting in thousands of people dying a day,

31:24.840 --> 31:26.920
 but we could have actually stopped it earlier

31:26.920 --> 31:28.840
 if we just had a reasonable discussion.

31:28.840 --> 31:31.400
 This is why podcasting is our respect what you do.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.200
 This is why intelligent people are so drawn to podcasts

31:34.200 --> 31:36.840
 because you and I can expand on this

31:36.840 --> 31:40.240
 and not cancel each other over this very suggestion.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.360
 When I make this suggestion,

31:41.360 --> 31:43.360
 are challenge trials reasonable or not?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.080
 If I were to do that on Twitter, they'd be like,

31:45.080 --> 31:49.600
 oh, Calacanis wants to give poor people coronavirus

31:49.600 --> 31:50.520
 in order to save rich people.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.960
 It's like, no, I didn't say that.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.600
 But you and I could have a reasonable discussion

31:55.600 --> 31:57.880
 about a challenge trial is something we should consider

31:57.880 --> 32:00.280
 in a acute situation

32:00.280 --> 32:02.440
 where millions of people are going to lose their lives.

32:02.440 --> 32:05.160
 Right, so that's an example

32:05.160 --> 32:07.920
 of capitalism competition working really well.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.120
 There's one of the, to me, sad thing to see

32:10.120 --> 32:11.880
 about coronavirus is that, for example,

32:11.880 --> 32:16.480
 testing at scale should have, it seems obvious.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.280
 I was a little clueless about it,

32:18.280 --> 32:21.240
 but because I thought there's no way you can have

32:21.240 --> 32:24.440
 like antigen tests at hundreds of millions,

32:24.440 --> 32:26.880
 like order hundreds of millions of them and make them cheap.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.720
 But actually I realized recently

32:28.720 --> 32:31.240
 that there have been available since about like May.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.560
 Yeah. You were able to.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.920
 In Korea, in Finland, all over the place.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.760
 You could have done mass manufacture.

32:36.760 --> 32:40.280
 So there, there's a little bit of a failure

32:40.280 --> 32:43.240
 of capitalism to step up.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.120
 And I don't know if you agree with this,

32:45.120 --> 32:47.480
 but it seems that the blame is to be placed

32:47.480 --> 32:52.080
 at the regulators and the various institutions.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.000
 Chrony capitalism in all likelihood

32:54.000 --> 32:55.680
 is what stopped it here in America.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.560
 I mean, I had friends who had imported them

32:58.560 --> 33:01.000
 from other countries, the testing kits.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.560
 And you've probably been to parties

33:02.560 --> 33:04.160
 where people had these kinds of testing kits

33:04.160 --> 33:06.200
 from other countries and we're sitting here

33:06.200 --> 33:07.560
 and they're just approving them now.

33:07.560 --> 33:11.440
 Really, in February, month 11 of the pandemic in America,

33:11.440 --> 33:13.600
 we're gonna have testing online, really.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.200
 I mean, even if these tests were 80% effective

33:17.200 --> 33:20.440
 and they're 95% effective, mass producing them,

33:20.440 --> 33:23.600
 we should have sent them in every postal,

33:23.600 --> 33:27.640
 anybody with a post office box with a mailing address

33:27.640 --> 33:29.320
 should have had 10 of them put in their mailing address

33:29.320 --> 33:30.800
 just for free from the government.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.360
 And then everybody would be testing

33:32.360 --> 33:33.480
 and we would have contained it.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.800
 We don't have test and trace here in the United States.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.320
 Well, all the countries that are on the other side of COVID

33:39.320 --> 33:42.320
 did it by having testing, tracing

33:42.320 --> 33:44.400
 and closing their borders and masks.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.280
 That's the combination that works.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.600
 The problem with the coronavirus

33:48.600 --> 33:51.000
 is while there's a lot of institutions

33:51.000 --> 33:52.480
 did not behave their best,

33:52.480 --> 33:54.920
 it's also the case that there's a lot of uncertainty.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.480
 So I tend to give a little bit of a pass

33:57.480 --> 34:00.520
 to everybody involved for the uncertainty.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.120
 We were all.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.760
 I give them that until June.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.360
 I wonder how history will remember this whole period.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.920
 I'd love to ask you,

34:07.920 --> 34:10.600
 because you were an early investor in Robinhoods

34:10.600 --> 34:14.600
 and you're in a very nice place

34:14.600 --> 34:19.600
 of being a huge supporter of the sort of Wall Street bets

34:19.880 --> 34:22.880
 kind of distributed power of the people.

34:22.880 --> 34:27.320
 And at the same time, because of you being an investor,

34:27.320 --> 34:31.000
 like intellectually giving a chance to Robinhood

34:31.000 --> 34:33.640
 in this kind of chaotic time of conversations

34:33.640 --> 34:36.320
 to think about like, well, what did they do right?

34:36.320 --> 34:37.840
 What did they do wrong?

34:37.840 --> 34:40.160
 So you have a kind of a balance view on the whole thing,

34:40.160 --> 34:41.880
 which is really nice.

34:41.880 --> 34:46.200
 We've talked about what Robinhood did right, I think.

34:46.200 --> 34:51.200
 Can you sort of steel man at your mouth's argument

34:51.400 --> 34:56.360
 of what Robinhood did wrong in the last few days?

34:56.360 --> 34:59.080
 Yeah, I mean, communication is always

34:59.080 --> 35:00.800
 the number one issue with these startups, right?

35:00.800 --> 35:04.160
 And if you, you have to get ahead of any problem

35:04.160 --> 35:07.000
 and you have to put all the bad news out immediately.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.240
 And in the case of Robinhood, it seems based on

35:09.240 --> 35:11.920
 what has been in the papers and what Robinhood said publicly

35:11.920 --> 35:14.320
 is that they had this kind of liquidity crisis, right?

35:14.320 --> 35:17.960
 Where they were being, because of these exchanges telling

35:17.960 --> 35:20.000
 them you have to put up this amount of money in collateral

35:20.000 --> 35:22.800
 and them being pinned at number one in the app store.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.760
 There were so many people trying to buy five shares

35:25.760 --> 35:28.480
 of this stock, five shares of this meme stock

35:28.480 --> 35:30.200
 that it kind of broke their system.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.120
 And then the people who clear the trades for them,

35:32.120 --> 35:33.920
 they said, you gotta put up a billion dollars,

35:33.920 --> 35:35.040
 two billion dollars, three billion dollars.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.720
 We can't do that overnight.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.400
 And I think that they were in an uncomfortable situation

35:40.400 --> 35:44.360
 of like going on TV and saying, we have a liquidity crisis.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.640
 Like that could be like a run on the bag.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.040
 Everybody then logs in at the same time to Robinhood

35:49.040 --> 35:50.280
 and tries to sell every share they own

35:50.280 --> 35:51.400
 because they're afraid that the whole thing's

35:51.400 --> 35:52.240
 gonna collapse, right?

35:52.240 --> 35:55.200
 So I think there was this kind of like black swan event

35:55.200 --> 35:57.960
 and they probably didn't communicate it all that well.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.280
 At the center of that, this is really interesting.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.680
 Maybe you can comment on the nature of communication.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.400
 Vlad, the CEO, the guy you met at the bar,

36:07.400 --> 36:10.680
 was I think at the center of the communication, right?

36:10.680 --> 36:13.280
 So Elon is an example of a guy who also is

36:13.280 --> 36:14.560
 at the center of the communication

36:14.560 --> 36:16.280
 for his particular set of companies.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.220
 And that on Twitter seems to be a really powerful way

36:19.220 --> 36:20.600
 to communicate.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.160
 And there was something, this is me saying it,

36:23.160 --> 36:26.800
 there was something about Vlad that sounded

36:26.800 --> 36:28.640
 like he's hiding stuff.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.720
 As opposed to Elon, it doesn't sound

36:32.720 --> 36:33.880
 like he's hiding stuff.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.480
 It could be the nature, the beat,

36:36.480 --> 36:38.480
 the timing of the conversation.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.220
 Same thing with Mark Zuckerberg.

36:40.220 --> 36:42.480
 Mark Zuckerberg for some reason often sounds

36:42.480 --> 36:43.920
 like he's hiding something.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.560
 And then there's like Jack Dorsey is much less so.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.920
 And I don't know what that is about the CEOs

36:49.920 --> 36:51.880
 that makes you trust them and not.

36:51.880 --> 36:56.880
 Might be the point in time, like in terms of escape velocity.

36:57.080 --> 37:01.240
 There might be nondisclosures in place

37:01.240 --> 37:03.360
 that we're not aware of where they're not allowed

37:03.360 --> 37:04.680
 to talk about certain relationships.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.520
 I see.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.480
 And that results like in Vlad's case,

37:08.480 --> 37:12.880
 and that results in you being like acting weird and nervous.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.720
 Or nervous.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.160
 Yeah, it could just be the person is nervous.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.380
 So it's really hard to be building one of these companies

37:18.380 --> 37:21.960
 and you're at scale and oh my Lord,

37:21.960 --> 37:23.400
 the entire thing's coming apart

37:23.400 --> 37:25.240
 and you're the most hated person for that day.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.600
 You know how the rage cycle works

37:26.600 --> 37:29.560
 and the media is just so crazy

37:29.560 --> 37:31.360
 when they get their hooks into something.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.440
 I saw it happen with Uber.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.720
 We saw it happen with Facebook and even Tesla.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.880
 There were times when people did stupid things

37:37.880 --> 37:39.740
 with autopilot and it's like, okay,

37:39.740 --> 37:42.920
 somebody is watching a movie and sleeping in their car

37:42.920 --> 37:44.280
 or leaving the driver's seat

37:44.280 --> 37:46.280
 against all the rules of autopilot

37:46.280 --> 37:47.860
 and somehow Tesla's responsible for that.

37:47.860 --> 37:49.960
 It's like we have people who stand on top

37:49.960 --> 37:51.680
 of their motorcycles and drive down the road

37:51.680 --> 37:53.280
 on a motorcycle.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.280
 And we don't blame Yamaha or Harley Davidson

37:56.280 --> 37:58.520
 for some idiot standing on the seat of their motorcycle

37:58.520 --> 37:59.840
 on a highway going 60 miles an hour.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.000
 We just say, that person's an idiot.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.140
 But when new technology comes out,

38:04.140 --> 38:07.720
 we blame the technology, not the person operating it.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.520
 And if you are going to operate,

38:11.460 --> 38:13.040
 we basically vilify it and demonize it.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.280
 I think that is part of it.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.920
 Like when the person at, I remember Airbnb,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.640
 we always thought, what if somebody trashes your apartment?

38:19.640 --> 38:21.360
 And then sure enough, a bunch of meth heads

38:21.360 --> 38:22.960
 rented this poor woman's apartment.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.280
 She left all of her stuff in it.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.080
 And then a bunch of meth heads had a drug party,

38:27.080 --> 38:29.840
 destroyed her apartment, ripped up all her photos

38:29.840 --> 38:31.320
 and went crazy.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.360
 And we knew that day would happen,

38:32.360 --> 38:33.320
 but nobody remembers it now.

38:33.320 --> 38:36.440
 But it was the number one story on every news channel

38:36.440 --> 38:38.480
 because wow, that's an exciting story.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.240
 And I just thought to myself,

38:40.240 --> 38:43.880
 I wonder if there are any parties in hotel rooms

38:43.880 --> 38:45.040
 where the hotel room is being trashed

38:45.040 --> 38:47.360
 and people are doing drugs and crazy things.

38:47.360 --> 38:49.920
 It's like, yes, that's basically every hotel

38:49.920 --> 38:52.240
 in Los Angeles right now is being destroyed

38:52.240 --> 38:55.240
 by some rock band that's throwing a TV out the window.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.160
 Like we expected in a hotel,

38:58.160 --> 39:00.000
 we just didn't expect it in somebody's house with Airbnb.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.040
 And then Airbnb created rules around,

39:02.040 --> 39:05.360
 you can't rent an Airbnb for a party and they learn.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.640
 So I think there's a learning curve with these companies

39:07.640 --> 39:09.920
 and they do get to scale at a level

39:09.920 --> 39:11.680
 that is unprecedented.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.400
 It used to take decades for a company

39:13.400 --> 39:15.200
 to become an international phenomenon.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.480
 Now it happens in two, three, four years.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.520
 I mean, look at Clubhouse.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.080
 This thing went from being a private beta six months ago

39:22.080 --> 39:24.320
 to being the number one app in Germany

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
 and in Japan and here.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.000
 Like just like that, boom.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.240
 And it's because there's an ecosystem

39:30.240 --> 39:32.440
 that has never existed, the app store.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.760
 Then there's payments online.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.960
 And then everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.200
 The thing people got wrong

39:40.200 --> 39:44.800
 about entrepreneurship technology and business

39:44.800 --> 39:45.760
 over the last couple of decades

39:45.760 --> 39:48.040
 was just how big the market was

39:48.040 --> 39:53.040
 and then how quickly you could achieve relevancy

39:53.360 --> 39:54.280
 in these markets.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.000
 We thought the market was like the 60 million homes

39:58.000 --> 39:58.920
 were broadband.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.720
 And originally it was like maybe 10 or 20.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.000
 Then it became 60 million.

40:02.000 --> 40:02.840
 Then it was like, okay,

40:02.840 --> 40:05.120
 well, how many hours are you at your desktop computer?

40:05.120 --> 40:07.240
 Well, like probably at our computers for five hours a day,

40:07.240 --> 40:10.480
 10 hours a day at work, three hours a day on our own.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.320
 And then it was like,

40:11.320 --> 40:12.480
 yeah, nobody's on their desktop computer.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.080
 Everybody's on their mobile phone.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.480
 Oh, and by the way, they have it with them.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.480
 So the people with mobile phones

40:16.480 --> 40:20.160
 are now using this high speed device with an app store

40:20.160 --> 40:21.960
 with their credit card in it.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.360
 In the early days of the internet,

40:23.360 --> 40:25.440
 people were scared to put their credit card on the internet.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.200
 That was considered a really dumb thing to do.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.360
 If you put your credit card on the internet,

40:28.360 --> 40:30.320
 you're gonna lose all your money.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.240
 They're gonna hack you or whatever.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.960
 And now it's just amazing to me

40:34.960 --> 40:37.120
 how quickly when a company hits,

40:37.120 --> 40:39.560
 how quickly it can get to a million subscribers

40:39.560 --> 40:42.160
 or 10 million or a billion users, right?

40:42.160 --> 40:44.040
 And there's all these networks, like social networks

40:44.040 --> 40:47.440
 that allow the spread of the viral spread

40:47.440 --> 40:51.920
 of like a new startup, a new company, a new app

40:51.920 --> 40:52.760
 to be announced.

40:52.760 --> 40:53.760
 Anything.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.680
 An idea, a podcast, right?

40:55.680 --> 40:58.240
 A single thing, a single meme could change the world.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.400
 Speaking of Clubhouse, I just wanna,

41:00.400 --> 41:01.800
 we're saying so many interesting things,

41:01.800 --> 41:04.960
 but there was a magical moment with Vlad and Elon

41:04.960 --> 41:05.800
 on Clubhouse.

41:05.800 --> 41:06.640
 I don't know if you got that.

41:06.640 --> 41:07.480
 That was wild.

41:07.480 --> 41:11.800
 Yes, is there, do you have thoughts about that interaction

41:13.040 --> 41:17.080
 which felt like so many aspects of this whole situation

41:17.080 --> 41:20.160
 feels like totally novel, surreal,

41:20.160 --> 41:22.040
 like it's defining a new era.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.080
 It is, yes.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.960
 Like a billionaire, the richest human on earth

41:25.960 --> 41:30.280
 is interviewing the person at the center

41:30.280 --> 41:34.320
 of one of the most interesting mass scale

41:34.320 --> 41:39.320
 like power battles in finance ever, perhaps.

41:39.480 --> 41:43.760
 And by the way, seven movies have been sold two weeks.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.160
 Just think about how fast things are moving, Lex.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.280
 This thing happens.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.400
 Like people had the idea to short the stock six months ago.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.600
 They start doing their research.

41:52.600 --> 41:53.440
 They build an army.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.360
 They execute the trade.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.080
 The system goes down.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.560
 Robinhood raises $3.5 billion in four days.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.200
 Elon is interviewing them on Clubhouse on Sunday

42:03.200 --> 42:04.480
 after the Wednesday it happened.

42:04.480 --> 42:08.040
 And now here we are, it's 10 days later.

42:08.040 --> 42:12.040
 Doesn't it feel like it's been 10 months?

42:12.040 --> 42:13.280
 It's been 10 days, Lex.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.240
 It's been 10 days.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.080
 10 days.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.320
 Plus, there's like a new president,

42:16.320 --> 42:18.040
 all these things, and everyone forgot.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.520
 Oh, and there was an insurrection.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.840
 By the way, we also almost had a revolution at the Capitol

42:21.840 --> 42:26.240
 where a bunch of crazy people who have guns

42:26.240 --> 42:28.680
 and body armor, and then a bunch of them

42:28.680 --> 42:32.840
 who are just yoloing in cosplay, took over the Capitol.

42:32.840 --> 42:35.280
 Well, so, and the other more dramatic thing to me is.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.240
 That was one month ago.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.080
 That was one month.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.920
 And the president of the United States got banned

42:39.920 --> 42:42.400
 from every major social network,

42:42.400 --> 42:47.120
 and which I think I'm still deeply troubled by

42:47.120 --> 42:49.760
 is Parler being removed from AWS.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.520
 That changed the way, that changed a lot of things.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.400
 As somebody who's an aspiring entrepreneur,

42:56.400 --> 42:58.240
 that changed the way I see the world.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.920
 That little, maybe I'm being over dramatic, but.

43:00.920 --> 43:01.760
 No, you're not.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.840
 I think you're paranoid for a reason.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.640
 You're paranoid for a very good reason,

43:05.640 --> 43:08.880
 which is as big as these companies can become,

43:08.880 --> 43:10.720
 they are beholden to the mob.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.560
 And if the mob says, hey, this person needs to be canceled,

43:14.560 --> 43:16.000
 they're going to get canceled

43:16.000 --> 43:18.400
 because you can't lose your entire audience.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.800
 You could lose your whole customer base,

43:19.800 --> 43:21.640
 and you could lose all your employees.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.160
 I think what's interesting about your fear

43:24.160 --> 43:25.920
 about Parler and AWS taking off

43:25.920 --> 43:27.960
 is we went from being like a social network,

43:27.960 --> 43:30.600
 which is the software layer.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.760
 And then we went to like the infrastructure layer,

43:33.760 --> 43:36.200
 and they'll even go after like Cloudflare,

43:36.200 --> 43:37.680
 which is a CDN provider, right?

43:37.680 --> 43:39.200
 They're just like a plumbing,

43:39.200 --> 43:41.640
 it's like sort of like the telephone.

43:41.640 --> 43:44.720
 So we're basically holding everybody responsible

43:44.720 --> 43:45.880
 on the whole chain of events here.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.440
 And what that's going to do is,

43:48.440 --> 43:50.040
 I'm not a huge believer in crypto,

43:50.040 --> 43:52.080
 but distributed computing,

43:52.080 --> 43:54.120
 where nobody in decentralized

43:54.120 --> 43:58.320
 and distributed computing platforms and open standards,

43:58.320 --> 43:59.800
 podcasting is an open standard,

43:59.800 --> 44:01.880
 the web is an open standard, FTP was an open standard,

44:01.880 --> 44:06.880
 but Twitter and Facebook are closed.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.520
 And what's going to happen is we will see

44:09.520 --> 44:12.480
 a group of individuals create peer to peer networks

44:12.480 --> 44:15.120
 for social media, where nobody can control it.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.920
 And the same for cloud computing,

44:16.920 --> 44:21.920
 where there's a crypto project where everybody will,

44:22.280 --> 44:24.080
 and I invested in a company that tried to do this

44:24.080 --> 44:26.280
 and got sold and it didn't work out,

44:26.280 --> 44:30.120
 but take your hard drive on your computer at home,

44:30.120 --> 44:33.280
 you give a terabyte of your 10 terabyte drive

44:33.280 --> 44:34.440
 over to the cloud,

44:34.440 --> 44:36.000
 and then everybody else does their terabyte.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.320
 And then all of a sudden you've got this virtual cloud

44:38.320 --> 44:40.600
 and anybody can store stuff on it and it's all encrypted,

44:40.600 --> 44:41.880
 and then nobody can stop it.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.640
 And that could be tweets, it could be videos.

44:43.640 --> 44:48.040
 And so this idea that YouTube will be able to tell people,

44:48.040 --> 44:50.920
 to kick people off because they're skeptics of,

44:50.920 --> 44:52.600
 I don't know, the pandemic or the vaccine,

44:52.600 --> 44:55.720
 or they've, they'll make things

44:55.720 --> 44:57.200
 that are more censorship resistant.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.200
 I think that'll be the reaction to all of this.

44:59.200 --> 45:00.600
 This is my question for you,

45:00.600 --> 45:03.440
 going back to that crappy bar and people pitching you,

45:03.440 --> 45:08.440
 is there, like with Clubhouse, do you see competitors,

45:08.640 --> 45:11.200
 do you think it's possible that another,

45:11.200 --> 45:13.920
 perhaps more decentralized or another kind

45:13.920 --> 45:15.200
 of social media will emerge

45:15.200 --> 45:17.800
 that will take on Twitter and Facebook

45:17.800 --> 45:19.240
 and might be able to replace them?

45:19.240 --> 45:22.840
 If you look at the whole landscape with Clubhouse

45:22.840 --> 45:23.680
 and everything else,

45:23.680 --> 45:26.440
 do you think some other company might emerge?

45:26.440 --> 45:28.160
 There'll be 10 versions of Clubhouse.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.320
 We looked at social networking.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.800
 We thought Friendster was it.

45:31.800 --> 45:33.000
 Like Friendster was so good,

45:33.000 --> 45:33.960
 nobody would be able to compete with that.

45:33.960 --> 45:35.200
 It was growing so quickly.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.840
 And then MySpace was a juggernaut

45:36.840 --> 45:38.440
 and they hit a hundred million in revenue

45:38.440 --> 45:39.560
 and a hundred million users.

45:39.560 --> 45:40.800
 And it was like, well, that's game over.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.920
 And then Facebook and LinkedIn and Snapchat

45:43.920 --> 45:46.360
 and FriendFeed and countless others.

45:46.360 --> 45:50.480
 So there's usually 20 people who will win in a category

45:50.480 --> 45:53.240
 and 80% of the category will be owned

45:53.240 --> 45:55.000
 by the top two or three players.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.320
 But will those players change, do you think?

45:57.320 --> 45:58.160
 What's your sense of that?

45:58.160 --> 45:59.000
 Oh yeah, for sure.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.320
 I mean, if Facebook hadn't bought Instagram,

46:01.320 --> 46:02.880
 it would be a company in decline right now.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.200
 People would be shorting the stock, right?

46:04.200 --> 46:07.000
 Facebook peaked and then was sort of heading down

46:07.000 --> 46:09.200
 and Instagram saved them and WhatsApp saved them.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.760
 So, you know, that's another kind of weird moment

46:11.760 --> 46:13.600
 in history that they were able to accumulate

46:13.600 --> 46:15.760
 that much power and consolidate that much power.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.200
 Instagram should have never sold to them.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.040
 That should have gone public.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.080
 They had just raised money from Sequoia

46:20.080 --> 46:23.680
 and they had raised $50 million at a $500 million valuation

46:23.680 --> 46:24.760
 and they didn't need to sell.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.040
 And that was a big mistake to sell.

46:27.040 --> 46:27.880
 They should have kept going

46:27.880 --> 46:29.520
 and they should have took on Facebook.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.480
 And if Instagram was a standalone company right now,

46:31.480 --> 46:35.040
 it'd be worth 500 million, 500 billion, yeah.

46:35.040 --> 46:38.560
 Do you think Facebook might buy Clubhouse has been?

46:38.560 --> 46:39.760
 Oh, they'll probably copy it.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.800
 I mean, Zuckerberg has no moral compass

46:42.800 --> 46:43.640
 or ethics or anything.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.640
 I mean, he's a marauder.

46:44.640 --> 46:48.400
 I mean, he basically copied Snapchat seven times.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.440
 Like he did poke and he just kept trying

46:50.440 --> 46:51.600
 and trying and trying.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.800
 Part of the reason why the WhatsApp founders

46:53.800 --> 46:54.920
 and the Instagram founders left

46:54.920 --> 46:57.200
 is they found Zuckerberg so distasteful

46:57.200 --> 46:59.640
 in terms of his ability to copy.

46:59.640 --> 47:02.520
 What do you think makes a great leader in that sense?

47:02.520 --> 47:05.520
 Because, okay, so when I look at Zuckerberg.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.920
 He's a great executor.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.760
 Is he a great executor?

47:07.760 --> 47:09.040
 I don't think he's a great leader.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.080
 I was bullish on,

47:10.080 --> 47:13.360
 I was excited by Facebook in the very early days.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.400
 I thought it was an exciting opportunity to connect people

47:15.400 --> 47:18.680
 and stuff started going wrong in certain kinds of ways.

47:18.680 --> 47:22.200
 And again, maybe it's our human nature,

47:22.200 --> 47:25.240
 but I attribute a lot of that to the leadership.

47:25.240 --> 47:26.200
 Absolutely.

47:26.200 --> 47:29.000
 I mean, the guy started it because he was unable

47:29.000 --> 47:31.280
 to ask girls if they were single and on a date.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.120
 I mean, that was his explicit.

47:32.120 --> 47:33.040
 That could be a good motivator.

47:33.040 --> 47:33.880
 That could be a good motivator.

47:33.880 --> 47:34.720
 Well, I mean, it does.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.880
 I mean, listen, the motivation of 18, 19 year old men

47:36.880 --> 47:39.600
 or his, yeah, pretty clear.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.840
 He was just trying to, he had no game.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.600
 He had no game and he needed to know who was single

47:44.600 --> 47:48.080
 so he could at least have a shot at getting a date.

47:48.080 --> 47:48.920
 It's a little creepy.

47:48.920 --> 47:49.760
 A little creepy, yeah.

47:49.760 --> 47:54.040
 He, I think, was so obsessed with engagement and winning.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.280
 And he's kind of like one of those friends you have

47:56.280 --> 47:58.160
 who's just really good at playing a video game,

47:58.160 --> 48:00.200
 but maybe doesn't see the bigger picture in life.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.720
 And I mean, there's a reason why everybody who worked

48:02.720 --> 48:04.720
 for him hates him and doesn't talk to him anymore

48:04.720 --> 48:06.040
 and then actively derides him.

48:06.040 --> 48:10.680
 Like so many, the people who sold WhatsApp to him

48:10.680 --> 48:13.320
 then backed other projects like Telegram

48:13.320 --> 48:15.000
 and said horrible things about him on the way out.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.680
 These are the people he made billionaires.

48:16.680 --> 48:19.160
 And they really don't like him.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.760
 So I think there is something that he does

48:21.760 --> 48:23.400
 that does not breed loyalty,

48:23.400 --> 48:25.560
 but he's very successful in his focus,

48:25.560 --> 48:27.280
 which is growth is all that matters.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.240
 He's a marauder and taking friction out of products

48:30.240 --> 48:32.760
 and processes is the playbook of Silicon Valley

48:32.760 --> 48:34.340
 for the last decade or two.

48:34.340 --> 48:35.180
 So whatever the friction is.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.520
 It's like poetry what you're saying right now.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.800
 It's like you're speaking so fast

48:37.800 --> 48:40.540
 that I almost forget that you're dropping bombs.

48:40.540 --> 48:43.720
 But so removing the, removing friction.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.440
 And you're saying Facebook is exceptionally good

48:45.440 --> 48:46.940
 at removing friction. He was the best at it.

48:46.940 --> 48:49.360
 I mean, at Uber, they were like,

48:49.360 --> 48:50.720
 we're gonna take out tipping.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.520
 We're gonna take out the need for you

48:52.520 --> 48:54.520
 to take out your credit card and do payment.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.260
 It's just gonna be in your wallet.

48:56.260 --> 48:59.080
 You got picked up, you leave, that's it.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.240
 And I was like, we should have tipping.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.040
 And they're like, it adds a step.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.800
 And we're trying to have no steps.

49:03.800 --> 49:06.120
 You put your address in, you click the button

49:06.120 --> 49:07.600
 and you do nothing else.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.400
 And so we've been obsessed here in Silicon Valley

49:09.400 --> 49:12.080
 is how many clicks can we take out of the process?

49:12.080 --> 49:13.960
 I guess Amazon is incredible at that as well.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.720
 Absolutely, one click was the start of it.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.960
 And then you look at Clubhouse as an example,

49:17.960 --> 49:19.800
 you open Clubhouse and you see rooms,

49:19.800 --> 49:21.100
 you click on it, you're listening.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.920
 So in one click, you're listening.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.200
 And then in one click, if you raise your hand

49:25.200 --> 49:27.920
 or you get invited and you say, yes, you're speaking.

49:27.920 --> 49:31.280
 So it's two clicks to speak, one click to listen.

49:31.280 --> 49:34.080
 I mean, the only way they could make that app work

49:34.080 --> 49:35.620
 even faster is if you opened it up

49:35.620 --> 49:37.740
 and your microphone was turned on,

49:37.740 --> 49:41.800
 which is kind of scary, but that is the next evolution.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.920
 And what happens when you go that fast

49:43.920 --> 49:46.000
 is you get unintended consequences.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.280
 And so this is why Facebook has had more fines

49:48.280 --> 49:49.880
 than any company in the history of Silicon Valley,

49:49.880 --> 49:52.160
 just giant fines for doing stuff like this.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.300
 And one of them was, I don't know if you remember

49:54.300 --> 49:55.320
 when they created groups

49:55.320 --> 49:57.360
 or if you have a group for your podcast,

49:57.360 --> 49:59.480
 but you can just add people to a group

49:59.480 --> 50:01.280
 without their permission.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.520
 And there was this famous case

50:02.520 --> 50:04.800
 when they first came out with it.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.760
 Somebody created a Nambla fake group,

50:07.760 --> 50:10.120
 National Man Love Boy Association or whatever,

50:10.120 --> 50:12.080
 like pedophilia association.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.440
 And they added Zuckerberg, Mike Arrington, myself,

50:14.440 --> 50:17.200
 and like 20 other famous people in Silicon Valley.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.200
 And I was like, and then somebody takes a screenshot of it

50:19.200 --> 50:20.240
 and they're like, you're in Nambla?

50:20.240 --> 50:21.600
 And I'm like, no.

50:22.840 --> 50:25.080
 Facebook, and then Zuckerberg's response was,

50:25.080 --> 50:26.960
 well, if your friends put you in that Nambla group,

50:26.960 --> 50:27.800
 you should get new friends.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.600
 And it was like, you got put in there too.

50:29.600 --> 50:33.480
 And then the sad part about it was

50:33.480 --> 50:35.560
 there were a group of young men who were gay

50:35.560 --> 50:36.560
 and who were in college

50:36.560 --> 50:38.520
 and there was a gay choir in their college

50:38.520 --> 50:41.640
 and the person who was coordinating their Facebook group

50:41.640 --> 50:42.760
 added them.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.760
 So Zuckerberg, it wasn't enough for Zuckerberg

50:44.760 --> 50:48.040
 to make it so anybody could add anybody to any group

50:48.040 --> 50:49.680
 because it will grow faster,

50:49.680 --> 50:50.840
 let alone you have to confirm

50:50.840 --> 50:52.560
 you wanna be added to the group.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.720
 What it also did was posted it on their walls

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
 to increase engagement.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.680
 And what they inadvertently did was

50:58.680 --> 51:01.120
 they outed a bunch of 18, 19 year olds in college

51:01.120 --> 51:02.000
 to their families

51:03.120 --> 51:06.480
 because they joined the gay men's choir at some college.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.720
 And this is the kind of way,

51:08.720 --> 51:11.080
 this is where Silicon Valley needs to check itself

51:11.080 --> 51:14.720
 and to do better is you have to really think,

51:14.720 --> 51:16.880
 well, there is my incentive to grow faster

51:16.880 --> 51:18.520
 and then there's what's right for society

51:18.520 --> 51:19.360
 and for the individual.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.960
 You gotta think it through, think it through.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.800
 It's sometimes very difficult.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.560
 This is where vision is required

51:25.560 --> 51:28.680
 to anticipate the unintended consequences.

51:28.680 --> 51:33.000
 And it seems like Mark Zuckerberg is not very good at that.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.200
 You've talked to so many great leaders in this world,

51:37.200 --> 51:39.360
 privately and publicly.

51:39.360 --> 51:42.400
 What do you think makes a great leader

51:42.400 --> 51:44.480
 of these tech companies?

51:44.480 --> 51:45.320
 Do you have an example?

51:45.320 --> 51:47.360
 Is Elon to you a great leader?

51:47.360 --> 51:49.200
 He's also a controversial one, right?

51:49.200 --> 51:52.440
 There's a love and hate, a controversial sense

51:52.440 --> 51:56.040
 that there is, and I know a lot of people work with him,

51:56.040 --> 52:00.280
 for him, that there's also a love, hate relationship.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.680
 The hate comes from the fact

52:01.680 --> 52:04.640
 that they get pushed extremely hard.

52:04.640 --> 52:07.560
 It's a very competitive environment,

52:07.560 --> 52:10.120
 but it's a positive one

52:10.120 --> 52:12.880
 because there's a vision that's underlying.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.040
 It's similar to the Steve Jobs thing.

52:15.040 --> 52:17.080
 And it has to do with the,

52:17.080 --> 52:19.880
 back to our Michael Jordan discussion as well,

52:19.880 --> 52:23.280
 that there seems to be the demons involved in tension

52:23.280 --> 52:27.840
 and just anxiety, all those kinds of things.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.080
 If you wanna do great things,

52:30.080 --> 52:31.440
 there will be some suffering

52:32.320 --> 52:34.600
 and there'll be some pain,

52:34.600 --> 52:37.000
 and it's not easy if you wanna change the world.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
 And then some people have this expectation

52:39.000 --> 52:41.200
 that it's going to be easy.

52:41.200 --> 52:44.640
 And what you'll typically find for any great leader

52:44.640 --> 52:47.160
 who's trying to do something super ambitious,

52:47.160 --> 52:48.600
 like if you wanna be like,

52:48.600 --> 52:50.760
 if you're a rich guy and you start a restaurant

52:50.760 --> 52:52.080
 and you don't care about making money

52:52.080 --> 52:54.240
 and people have made restaurants before,

52:54.240 --> 52:55.160
 you could be high fives

52:55.160 --> 52:56.880
 and everybody could love you or whatever.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.800
 But if you wanna change the world,

52:58.800 --> 52:59.880
 you wanna do something hard driving,

52:59.880 --> 53:01.440
 there's gonna be sacrifice involved.

53:01.440 --> 53:05.360
 And so the problem is people are looking at something

53:05.360 --> 53:08.080
 that is an Olympic caliber sport

53:08.080 --> 53:10.560
 or a Navy SEALs like effort.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.680
 In other words, an effort that requires massive sacrifice.

53:13.680 --> 53:16.040
 We would not look at somebody who wins a gold medal,

53:16.040 --> 53:17.360
 like Michael Phelps and say,

53:17.360 --> 53:20.040
 oh my God, he had to get up at 4 a.m. every day

53:20.040 --> 53:22.320
 and he had to swim and he had to do an ice bath.

53:22.320 --> 53:25.720
 Oh my God, that poor guy, he suffered, he was tortured.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.640
 People were super mean to him,

53:27.640 --> 53:28.480
 they put him in an ice bath.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.280
 It was like, no, he wanted to be

53:30.280 --> 53:32.080
 the greatest swimmer of all time

53:32.080 --> 53:34.080
 and he knew what the sacrifice entailed.

53:34.080 --> 53:37.120
 And that what happens in work, in business,

53:37.120 --> 53:39.280
 is that people conflate like,

53:39.280 --> 53:43.000
 oh, well, I went to work to make a living to pay my bills

53:43.000 --> 53:47.600
 versus Michael Phelps approach to getting gold medals

53:47.600 --> 53:49.600
 or Michael Jordan or pick the person,

53:49.600 --> 53:50.840
 Elon or Jeff Bezos.

53:50.840 --> 53:54.080
 And when you look at the reviews of like a place like Amazon,

53:54.080 --> 53:56.280
 there was this incredible story in the New York Times

53:56.280 --> 53:58.760
 where people were, I don't know if you remember it,

53:58.760 --> 54:01.400
 this is the worst place you could ever work, Amazon.

54:01.400 --> 54:04.560
 And we talked to 200 people and they all told us,

54:04.560 --> 54:07.080
 they all described for us in the New York Times,

54:07.080 --> 54:10.120
 a culture of cutthroatness and brutality

54:10.120 --> 54:11.840
 that has never before been seen.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.800
 And then you see all these people who work for Bezos

54:13.800 --> 54:16.360
 for 24 years from when they graduated

54:16.360 --> 54:18.280
 with their MBAs until today.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.880
 And they've never left the company

54:19.880 --> 54:23.520
 and they are ride or die forever.

54:23.520 --> 54:26.200
 And what you're seeing there is,

54:26.200 --> 54:29.200
 there's a mismatch of people going to work

54:29.200 --> 54:32.720
 in an extreme sport or an extreme endeavor

54:32.720 --> 54:34.280
 who should not do that.

54:34.280 --> 54:37.920
 There are people who should go out into the rice fields

54:37.920 --> 54:39.000
 and pick rice.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.400
 And then there's another group of people who are samurai

54:42.400 --> 54:46.360
 and who wield a sword and who take on missions

54:46.360 --> 54:48.240
 that are dangerous.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.560
 But if you're a rice picker and that's what you do

54:50.560 --> 54:53.920
 and you feel safe, just getting a couple grains of rice,

54:53.920 --> 54:56.560
 put them in a basket, cleaning it and then whatever,

54:56.560 --> 54:58.520
 that's valid work, no big deal.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.120
 I'm not deriding it, I'm sort of,

55:00.120 --> 55:02.200
 but that is one group.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.800
 And then there's people who are samurai

55:03.800 --> 55:05.880
 and you cannot conflate the two,

55:05.880 --> 55:07.960
 you cannot compare the two.

55:07.960 --> 55:10.560
 And that's what is happening right now in business.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.160
 Whenever you see these stories about,

55:12.160 --> 55:14.640
 this person at this company is like a tyrant

55:14.640 --> 55:17.080
 and they're so horrible and they yelled at somebody.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.120
 Like if you're in the field

55:19.120 --> 55:22.080
 and you're taking the beach at Normandy and it's D day

55:22.080 --> 55:23.720
 or you gotta take the hill

55:23.720 --> 55:25.640
 or you gotta whack Osama bin Laden

55:25.640 --> 55:27.800
 and you're the Navy SEALs and like a rudder,

55:27.800 --> 55:31.320
 a rotor gets knocked off the back of the Black Hawk,

55:31.320 --> 55:32.800
 like this is serious shit.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.360
 Like don't do it if you're not serious.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.520
 And if you're not serious about changing the world,

55:37.520 --> 55:39.320
 why would you go work for Bezos?

55:39.320 --> 55:40.720
 Why would you go work for Elon Musk?

55:40.720 --> 55:43.520
 Don't do it, don't go work there.

55:43.520 --> 55:46.080
 This is, let me just sit back

55:46.080 --> 55:49.800
 and enjoy the beauty of all of that.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.840
 That's music to my ears,

55:50.840 --> 55:52.480
 but I'm not sure what to do with it

55:52.480 --> 55:57.480
 because it's conflicting to a lot of the things I hear

55:57.600 --> 56:00.080
 from the way you're supposed to kind of act.

56:00.080 --> 56:03.680
 And I think in order to do great things,

56:03.680 --> 56:06.720
 you have to, I always admired people

56:06.720 --> 56:08.400
 that lose their shit a little bit

56:08.400 --> 56:10.160
 because they're so passionate.

56:10.160 --> 56:14.320
 And I apologize and all those kinds of things,

56:14.320 --> 56:15.760
 but like there's a tension,

56:15.760 --> 56:18.600
 there's a drama to the creative process

56:18.600 --> 56:20.720
 when especially in the early startup,

56:22.720 --> 56:26.320
 this is not like the work life balance idea

56:26.320 --> 56:27.160
 doesn't even apply.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.680
 Work life balance, it's ridiculous.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.640
 It's a ridiculous concept.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.200
 Like the idea that there's like work life balance

56:33.200 --> 56:34.480
 in a startup is ridiculous.

56:34.480 --> 56:36.560
 If you're looking for work life balance,

56:36.560 --> 56:39.600
 do not go to a startup or any kind of ambitious company.

56:39.600 --> 56:43.200
 There is a series of places you can work in the world

56:43.200 --> 56:46.840
 where you do not need to do anything more

56:46.840 --> 56:48.320
 than what's put in front of you.

56:48.320 --> 56:52.240
 And you just put the round peg in the round hole

56:52.240 --> 56:55.600
 and the square peg in the square hole and you go home.

56:55.600 --> 57:00.600
 And you get your little bits and grains of rice

57:00.920 --> 57:03.200
 and you go heat them up and eat them, that's it.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.280
 And then there's this other thing,

57:04.280 --> 57:07.520
 which is the extreme pursuit of changing the world

57:07.520 --> 57:09.000
 and sacrificing.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.160
 And we have a generation of people,

57:11.160 --> 57:14.200
 multi generations of people who are soft.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.040
 They're just soft.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.720
 I mean, what is the big struggle we've had to deal with

57:17.720 --> 57:19.440
 in America in our lifetimes?

57:19.440 --> 57:21.640
 Like 9 11 and we didn't have the Vietnam War

57:21.640 --> 57:23.400
 and then we had this like weird Iraq Wars

57:23.400 --> 57:26.640
 and Middle East Wars that were kind of like a small number

57:26.640 --> 57:27.920
 of people went and we sent drones.

57:27.920 --> 57:30.360
 Like we have not had to sacrifice.

57:30.360 --> 57:33.240
 Gen Xers, maybe the tail end of boomers

57:33.240 --> 57:35.640
 experienced the Vietnam War regrettably.

57:35.640 --> 57:38.840
 But we've had a couple of generations now, three I guess,

57:38.840 --> 57:40.600
 that just haven't had to suffer.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.680
 And so we're soft as Americans, we're soft.

57:42.680 --> 57:44.720
 And then you look at people in China and we're like,

57:44.720 --> 57:46.960
 oh my God, these poor Chinese people are living

57:46.960 --> 57:48.440
 in these tiny cramped apartments.

57:48.440 --> 57:52.600
 Like they were living in like essentially lean twos

57:52.600 --> 57:56.120
 in Northern China with no running water

57:56.120 --> 57:58.480
 or like one spigot of ice cold water for the entire village.

57:58.480 --> 58:01.960
 Like they're thrilled to be joining the middle class.

58:01.960 --> 58:04.480
 Even if it's the bottom of the middle class, right?

58:04.480 --> 58:06.400
 They've taken hundreds of millions of people in China

58:06.400 --> 58:08.560
 and moved them into the middle class.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.280
 And we're like, oh my God, these people are suffering.

58:10.280 --> 58:12.360
 It's like, they're up to $4 an hour,

58:12.360 --> 58:14.480
 three or $4 an hour in the factories there.

58:14.480 --> 58:17.920
 And they were just two decades ago at,

58:17.920 --> 58:20.880
 I don't know, it was probably 50 cents an hour,

58:20.880 --> 58:22.360
 something crazy like that.

58:22.360 --> 58:26.280
 And now they've improved the quality of life there so much,

58:26.280 --> 58:28.960
 just like America did 200 years ago or 100 years ago.

58:28.960 --> 58:31.200
 They've improved it so much in China

58:31.200 --> 58:33.440
 that now they're getting outpriced for factories

58:33.440 --> 58:36.960
 from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India,

58:36.960 --> 58:39.080
 and people are moving and people in China

58:39.080 --> 58:43.080
 are moving the factories out of China into other countries.

58:43.080 --> 58:46.120
 Because the Chinese are now outsourcing to Vietnam

58:46.120 --> 58:46.960
 and other countries.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.840
 So this is the way of the world.

58:48.840 --> 58:51.080
 People move up and they get a better lot in life

58:51.080 --> 58:51.920
 for their families.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.480
 And just in America, we've gotten soft.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.400
 And there's a generation.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.040
 How do people die in America now?

58:57.040 --> 59:01.400
 Suicide, obesity, heart attacks, anxiety.

59:01.400 --> 59:04.160
 I mean, we're suffering from things

59:04.160 --> 59:05.920
 that if you told people 100 years ago

59:05.920 --> 59:09.200
 that the number, the top ways Americans would die

59:09.200 --> 59:11.840
 would be overeating and suicide,

59:11.840 --> 59:13.520
 they'd be like, what?

59:13.520 --> 59:14.640
 You're literally killing yourself

59:14.640 --> 59:15.600
 or eating yourself to death?

59:15.600 --> 59:16.960
 That's what's happening in America?

59:16.960 --> 59:20.480
 And when everybody, not everybody en masse,

59:20.480 --> 59:21.640
 there's a large number of people

59:21.640 --> 59:23.920
 who have become softer and softer.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.480
 Capitalism creates an environment

59:25.480 --> 59:28.360
 where there is people that still step up amidst that

59:28.360 --> 59:31.400
 with a big dream and challenge the conventions.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.560
 And that human spirit just arise above that.

59:33.560 --> 59:36.320
 Elon's example of that, Jeff Bezos's example of that.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.640
 Countless, countless examples.

59:37.640 --> 59:42.520
 And they push the limits of those,

59:42.520 --> 59:45.240
 of human beings that are willing to step up.

59:45.240 --> 59:49.840
 And I think about sort of how to create a company

59:49.840 --> 59:54.200
 that amidst all of this softness

59:54.200 --> 59:56.080
 still creates a revolution.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.440
 It's not, it doesn't seem trivial.

59:58.440 --> 1:00:00.440
 It seems like how do you build a culture

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:05.440
 that's once healthy, but also unhealthy

1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:09.040
 in the way that an Olympic pursuit is.

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:10.480
 It's all top down.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.840
 Everybody just, you asked earlier what leadership was

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:13.800
 and I never answered the question.

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:16.400
 I think what leaders do is they set the example,

1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:17.680
 they set the bar.

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:19.920
 And if you look at someone like Elon,

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.400
 we're personal friends for 20 years

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:24.680
 and he is indefatigable.

1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:29.000
 Like, I mean, the guy has a stamina that is just phenomenal.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.400
 Like he does not get tired.

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.200
 He works relentlessly

1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:36.000
 and he sets that standard for the rest of the team.

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.800
 And I think Bezos is very sharp

1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:41.520
 and likes to debate stuff and is very,

1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:44.400
 and Jobs was just incredible at design

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:46.080
 and figuring out how to bridge that gap.

1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:48.880
 So they just, leaders set the standard.

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.200
 They set the standard.

1:00:50.200 --> 1:00:52.360
 And you know that your time is over as a leader

1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:53.800
 when you can't set the standard.

1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:55.720
 And that's when you have to pass the baton, right?

1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.160
 And Bezos did that.

1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:58.880
 And Bezos now is saying, you know what?

1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:01.600
 I'm 57, I'm the richest guy on the planet,

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:03.920
 depending on the week.

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:06.560
 And I would like to do some other challenges,

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.840
 but I don't wanna grind it out at Amazon

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.280
 for another 25 years.

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.360
 I wanna do other things.

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:13.040
 And so he passed the baton.

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:15.320
 And that's the healthy thing to do in that regard.

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.160
 I do think there is a time period

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:18.840
 in which you can run that hot.

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.600
 And then at a certain point you have to then change.

1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:24.360
 Just like an athlete might go to be a coach, right?

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.600
 Or a commentator.

1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:29.440
 And so being an entrepreneur is brutal.

1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:31.920
 It's seven days a week, 12 hours a day.

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.320
 Anybody who says anything differently

1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:34.640
 is kidding themselves.

1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:36.560
 You're gonna have to sacrifice.

1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:39.960
 And this competition, and America has to fight.

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:43.840
 If America does not win capitalism, and China does,

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:47.880
 it is literally the end of the human species.

1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:49.680
 It's over for humanity.

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:52.640
 Right now, everything has been going really well

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.680
 in terms of the number of people living in poverty

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:55.920
 is plummeting.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:59.160
 Lifespans have been rising.

1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:01.120
 Science is booming.

1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.080
 The economy is booming.

1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:02.920
 All these things are incredible.

1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:05.080
 The one thing that's kind of stagnant right now

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.080
 is the number of people living in democracy

1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:09.480
 versus under authoritarian rule.

1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:10.320
 It's flat.

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:11.920
 So when you look at all Steve Pinker's charts,

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:13.400
 and he's really excited,

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:15.040
 there's one you're gonna see that's flat.

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:18.480
 And I think we peaked with 53 or 54% of people

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.320
 on the planet Earth being in a democracy,

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:22.480
 and now it's going below 50.

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.120
 And it's because some of the democratic Western countries

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.400
 don't have the population growth

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:30.280
 of some of the communist and socialist countries

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:31.600
 and authoritarian countries.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:35.960
 And we have to make sure that we win capitalism.

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:38.160
 We must win economically.

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:39.520
 That is the battlefield.

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:41.920
 The battlefield is science, technology, and money,

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.320
 and economy, finance.

1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:44.600
 That's the battlefield.

1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:47.440
 China wins, authoritarians win.

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:51.320
 And at any time, Xi Jinping can pull Jack Ma into a room

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.280
 and say, it's time for you to be reeducated.

1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.320
 Or they can put three or four million people,

1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:59.160
 Uighurs, into prison camps and say, you know what?

1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:00.720
 This religious thing,

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:03.600
 that's counter to what is productive for us.

1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:05.480
 Therefore, we're gonna shave your heads

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:06.480
 and we're going to have you

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:08.200
 literally pick cotton in the fields.

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:12.880
 They have Uighurs with no sense of any kind of

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:15.720
 arc of history in the fields picking cottons

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:19.160
 as slaves in what can only be described

1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:22.280
 by every humanitarian organization as a concentration camp.

1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:24.680
 And every Jewish person I know takes great offense

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:27.240
 when somebody uses the Holocaust as a metaphor,

1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:29.480
 except in the case of the Uighurs right now.

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:32.320
 And every Jewish person I've talked to has said to me,

1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:33.480
 that is a Holocaust.

1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:37.080
 That is millions of people going to genocide

1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:38.640
 because of their religious beliefs.

1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:40.120
 And I'm an atheist,

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:43.120
 but if people wanna believe a certain religion, fine.

1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:47.160
 But China's approach is we need to win capitalism so bad,

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:49.520
 we need to win on the global stage so bad,

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:52.520
 we can't have any of this religious stuff going on here.

1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:55.400
 That is a distraction from winning and beating America.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:56.640
 And then in America,

1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:59.040
 the people who are gonna make us win are the entrepreneurs

1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:00.520
 and the scientists and the technology

1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.320
 and our education system and finance.

1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:04.120
 And we're vilifying those things.

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:05.440
 It's pretty dark.

1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:09.120
 It's dark, but I still believe that the vilification

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.440
 is just in the space of Twitter and the space of ideas.

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.280
 I think that's probably a good.

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:14.520
 And entrepreneurs win out in the end.

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:15.360
 They don't listen to that.

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:16.200
 I believe we'll win.

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.720
 And they'll build, we'll get the rocks up.

1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:19.640
 Some of them do actually in their darkest moments,

1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:21.600
 I can tell you that they turn off their Twitter accounts

1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:23.240
 and they, I've had to sit down

1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:26.560
 with a number of entrepreneurs and say, turn off Twitter.

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:28.360
 This is not healthy for you.

1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:30.320
 This is not a healthy pursuit because,

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:31.280
 don't read the comments.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.080
 If you do, it's like a full contact sport.

1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:35.640
 You should just take it as like professional wrestling

1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:38.840
 or something, but stay focused on building companies

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.800
 and advancing the human species

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:43.120
 through science and technology.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:43.960
 I mean.

1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:47.040
 As you're describing, you've hosted this week in startups

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.360
 for how many episodes?

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:51.160
 11 years, almost 1200 now.

1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:52.120
 1200.

1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:52.960
 Yeah.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.480
 So you've talked to some of the great leaders

1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:56.240
 in business in general.

1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:01.240
 Is there a common thing that you see or?

1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:03.920
 Really, I'm in a relationship with their parents.

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:06.440
 Like just find me a great entrepreneur.

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:08.480
 I will, show me the trauma.

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:10.760
 Their dad was like, you're not good enough.

1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:14.280
 In the teenage years, is that truly, is there something?

1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:15.640
 There is definitely something.

1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:18.080
 Hardship at some point in their life kind of thing?

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:18.920
 Yeah, I think so.

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:20.960
 I mean, and there's definitely something

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:24.440
 with immigrant parents that is a bit of a stereotype

1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:26.280
 out here, but I've heard from many investors,

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:29.520
 like that's like their, oh, were your parents immigrants?

1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:32.480
 And did they beat into you that you have to succeed

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.240
 and you feel the need to succeed

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:35.960
 because they suffered to get you to this country?

1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:38.840
 Like there is an archetype there that I hear.

1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:40.840
 When I started investing, I heard from a lot of people.

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:43.080
 It's like, yeah, you wanna find those immigrant founders

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:44.120
 who are coming out of Stanford

1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:45.840
 because they had to fight to get there

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:47.960
 and their parents had to fight, right?

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:50.520
 So it was like two huge fights and there's so much at stake

1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.400
 as opposed to somebody who's fifth generation

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:54.080
 and like had everything handed to them

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.960
 and they were legacy and got into schools for free.

1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:59.960
 But I think in general, the ability to get people

1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:03.080
 to join you on that journey is so critical.

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:05.280
 So you have to be charismatic

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:07.320
 and it doesn't mean like you're an extrovert.

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:10.640
 There are introverts who are super charismatic

1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:11.600
 and there are soft spoken people.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:14.120
 They don't have to be like super vivacious

1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:16.600
 or rambunctious people.

1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:18.080
 They could be just quiet assassins,

1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:19.880
 but you need to be able to get people

1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:21.000
 to come on the journey with you.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.720
 You have to be that storyteller

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:23.840
 and you have to have that passion

1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:26.760
 and then you have to transfer that enthusiasm to investors,

1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:29.960
 the press, to customers, to all the stakeholders.

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.240
 And if you're enthusiastic about it and you're engaged,

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:35.200
 then it's easier for people to come on that journey.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:37.680
 And that's why people really start to think about,

1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:39.840
 well, what is the purpose of what I'm doing?

1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:42.200
 And it sounds corny and when I first heard that,

1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:43.120
 I was like, it's kind of corny.

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.920
 But then I read this book by,

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:47.320
 I've got his name, Rick something.

1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:49.960
 He wrote the purpose driven church

1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:51.600
 and he had spoken at a TED or something

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.880
 and everybody went crazy about it.

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:56.600
 And he's like, a church should have one purpose,

1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:57.440
 one single thing they do.

1:06:57.440 --> 1:06:58.960
 And like his church,

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.360
 which was like one of these mega churches in San Diego,

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:05.720
 just wanted to do education for this specific country.

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:06.760
 And that's all they did.

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:08.360
 And they just, they benchmarked.

1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:10.600
 I think it's very important to have a purpose and a mission,

1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:15.600
 not everything, but a specific purpose of some kind of joy

1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:17.560
 that you wanna put into the world.

1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:20.320
 You wanna solve some kind of big, hard problem.

1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:22.000
 And then everybody knows

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.840
 why you're coming to work every day.

1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:24.880
 And then for the founder,

1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:27.560
 when you dread going to work that day

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:29.720
 and you don't feel like solving that problem anymore,

1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:31.120
 that's the tell.

1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:32.440
 And a lot of times I meet young founders,

1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:33.280
 I'm like, why are you doing this?

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:36.200
 And they're like, well, I was looking for an idea

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:37.320
 and this is the one I came up with

1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:38.520
 because I think I'll make a lot of money.

1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:41.040
 And it's like, you're gonna quit.

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:42.880
 You're gonna get to month nine or 10 of this

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:44.360
 and you're gonna run out of money

1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:46.400
 or like your CTO is gonna quit,

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:47.720
 then your CFO is gonna quit

1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:49.080
 and you're gonna lose your biggest customer

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.480
 and you're just gonna say, this is not worth it.

1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:57.560
 And if using Bezos or Elon as examples,

1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:00.560
 they just needed to see the world change

1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:02.400
 in very specific ways.

1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:04.440
 And Steve Jobs, they needed to see a change

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:06.480
 and it doesn't matter if they made money

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:07.840
 or they were losing or winning,

1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.520
 they just went to work every day and they had to change it.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.240
 It's almost like they didn't have a choice.

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:13.080
 No choice.

1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.360
 Elon makes it sound like his torture, his whole journey,

1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:16.800
 but he can't help it.

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:21.800
 Having been a witness to it, just as friends for that long,

1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:25.240
 I have never seen an entrepreneur suffer more than him.

1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:28.400
 And he's been public about that, like you do not wanna be me.

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:31.200
 He has suffered for those companies.

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:32.760
 He has suffered to get them where they are.

1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:34.080
 It has not been easy.

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:36.920
 Can you second analyze Elon in that aspect?

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.600
 Like, is it just he can't help it?

1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:44.000
 He must see the change that he hopes for in the world.

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.320
 He's just incredibly hardworking

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:49.320
 and he's very talented as well.

1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:51.360
 I don't think people understand that.

1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:53.800
 He actually is a really brilliant man.

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:56.080
 He actually is a really brilliant engineer.

1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:58.960
 At the end of the day, he actually knows what he's doing

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.360
 and he asked the right questions.

1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:02.840
 I mean, people were kind of aghast

1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:05.120
 that he was asking Vlad such good questions.

1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:06.400
 And they're like, oh my God,

1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:08.080
 Elon's the best journalist on the planet.

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:11.240
 And it was like, anybody who knows Elon knows

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:12.080
 he has great questions.

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.240
 I mean, I used to have dinner in LA

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:18.480
 and my book agent also was Sam Harris's agent.

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.080
 And Sam and I met through John Brockman

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.080
 and we became friends because we lived near each other

1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:25.640
 and I was friends with Elon.

1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:27.840
 And then I used to invite them to both dinner in Brentwood

1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:29.160
 because one lived in Bel Air,

1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:30.960
 one lived in Santa Monica and I lived in Brentwood.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:31.880
 And we would go to this place,

1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:33.640
 Popone, this Italian restaurant.

1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:36.400
 And every Tuesday for years, we would just,

1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:38.000
 the three of us, every other Tuesday or so,

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.480
 we'd have dinner and I'd sit there

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.080
 and Sam wanted to know about AI

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.960
 and Elon's talking about artificial intelligence

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:46.520
 because he's on the board of DeepMind.

1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:49.320
 Elon wanted to know about atheism and meditation

1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:52.680
 and all this other stuff that Sam was an expert on.

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:56.360
 I got to sit there and just listen to these two guys talk.

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:58.720
 And they have both piercing intelligences,

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.560
 but Elon, he goes straight to the gut,

1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:06.240
 like the questions that no engineer wants to hear

1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:08.920
 is just the basic stuff that,

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:11.680
 it's like, why the hell are you doing it this way

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.960
 when the obvious solution is much easier or this or that?

1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:17.160
 Why haven't you tried this?

1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:18.000
 He can figure things out.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.400
 I mean, he's a problem solver.

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.800
 I mean, and that's another thing,

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.200
 like I think the great entrepreneurs

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.720
 can look at a problem with very fresh eyes,

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:25.760
 like almost consistently.

1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:30.120
 And Bezos described that as day one thinking, right?

1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:32.400
 Like just pretend this is day one every day.

1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:35.680
 And then other people use the term first principles,

1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:38.400
 but it basically means like when you see a problem,

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:41.640
 pause for a second and really think through

1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:43.400
 what is the best possible solution here?

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:45.760
 What are some alternative solutions and get from everybody,

1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:47.000
 like how do we solve this problem?

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000
 What people do sometimes they get in a rut.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.920
 They just come to work and they just go through their email.

1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:53.680
 They do whatever they did the day before.

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:55.440
 They don't think, why are we doing this?

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:56.900
 And is there a better way to do it?

1:10:56.900 --> 1:10:58.880
 Now you can get so obsessive about that

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:01.060
 that you can over engineer stuff

1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:03.400
 and you can never actually ship a product.

1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:06.600
 So there have to be some pragmatism and some goals

1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:08.320
 and some dates associated with that.

1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:12.280
 But it is a very cool thing to really think like,

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:14.640
 I wonder if we actually made the batteries ourselves,

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:15.480
 what that would look like.

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:18.880
 Or I wonder if we could get to two day shipping,

1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:20.920
 or what if we do same day shipping?

1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.100
 Like you need to have somebody who's willing to say,

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:24.280
 you know what, fuck it.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.520
 Let's set a crazy audacious goal.

1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.300
 Two day shipping of any product

1:11:28.300 --> 1:11:29.680
 anywhere in the United States.

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:31.200
 And once you throw the gauntlet down like that,

1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:34.040
 now everybody knows they're rolling in the right direction.

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:36.040
 Two day shipping, Amazon Prime.

1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:37.800
 And that's what people didn't realize about Amazon.

1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.080
 The business wasn't shipping all those products.

1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:43.000
 It was getting you to sign up for Amazon Prime.

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.240
 They have hundreds of millions of people doing Amazon Prime

1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:47.400
 for 10 bucks a month.

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:48.940
 I think globally it's probably cheaper.

1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:51.840
 But that was the driver of that business

1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:53.080
 was all of those people.

1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:55.960
 Cause they would, you're an Amazon Prime subscriber?

1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:57.280
 Do you know how much you pay?

1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:58.120
 No.

1:11:58.120 --> 1:11:58.960
 Exactly.

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:00.280
 It started at $50.

1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:02.520
 And I think they even had like 40, 50, $60

1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:03.920
 was like the testing in the early days.

1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:08.480
 And now it's, I think $149, 12, $13 a month.

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:09.300
 If you pay for the year,

1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:11.840
 I think it goes down to 10 bucks a month, 120.

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:12.680
 And you're like, wow.

1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:14.960
 And it's like, yeah, you're paying $13 a month

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:17.840
 for the privilege of shopping at Amazon.

1:12:19.220 --> 1:12:21.680
 But you say it's the greatest thing in the world

1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:23.280
 because anything I need,

1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:25.080
 if you forgot a microphone or a cable goes bad

1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:28.360
 or a camera goes bad, you get it here within a day or less.

1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:29.560
 It's pretty amazing.

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.000
 You've already been dropping bombs,

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.440
 incredible advice on startups in general.

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:38.440
 But let me maybe go straight in and ask,

1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.880
 is there advice for somebody that wants to go big

1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:44.680
 to build the big startup to help them succeed?

1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:47.560
 Yeah, it's very similar to the advice I give to investors

1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:49.800
 because now I teach angel investing

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:51.640
 because there's so many people who want to invest.

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.920
 And so I wrote a book on that angel

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.880
 and then I do a course called Angel University

1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.400
 that I teach six times a year.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:59.320
 And then I have a syndicate called thesyndicate.com

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:00.240
 where I invest in companies.

1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:02.400
 There's 6,500 people who are members of that.

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:04.080
 It's the largest syndicate in the world.

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.760
 In fact, the first deal we ever did was calm.com,

1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:07.580
 the meditation app.

1:13:07.580 --> 1:13:09.360
 We put $378,000 into it

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:11.260
 when it was a $5 million product.

1:13:11.260 --> 1:13:12.100
 A $5 million company.

1:13:12.100 --> 1:13:13.840
 So we bought six or 7% of the company.

1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:15.060
 It's now worth 2 billion.

1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:15.940
 So you can do the math on that.

1:13:15.940 --> 1:13:16.780
 We still own 5%.

1:13:16.780 --> 1:13:18.040
 What year was that?

1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:18.880
 Six years ago.

1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:23.300
 So probably seven, yeah, maybe 2015, 2014.

1:13:23.300 --> 1:13:25.600
 And nobody else would invest in calm.

1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:28.400
 But Sam Harris was the reason I did because I asked Sam,

1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:30.600
 tell me about meditation.

1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:31.700
 And he's explaining it to me.

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:32.600
 And I said, what about this?

1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.760
 You have to have like a mantra.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:34.720
 How does it work exactly?

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:35.560
 I know positive.

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:37.040
 He was like, well, you know, you should just go to UCLA

1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:37.960
 and talk to Diana Winston.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.780
 And like, there's this whole project there.

1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:42.280
 And I'm like, UCLA does meditation?

1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:43.760
 He's like, yeah, there's a mindful institute.

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:46.880
 They're like teaching people to be Tahitian meditation.

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:49.360
 And they're doing PTSD and I'm doing brain scans.

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:50.920
 And I was like, oh.

1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:53.200
 And then I talked to the UCLA people and they're like,

1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:55.720
 it's real, yeah, like we taught Phil Jackson

1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:58.080
 and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O Neal did,

1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:01.100
 you know, that's how they won their championships.

1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:02.200
 They meditated.

1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:05.720
 And I was like, hmm, if UCLA is doing it,

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:06.920
 Sam says it's cool.

1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:08.960
 Well, fuck it, I'll put money into that.

1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:10.360
 And that's the second biggest investment

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:11.680
 in my career after Uber.

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:13.840
 And it will in all likelihood become the biggest.

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.620
 I mean, it's between Uber, Robinhood and Calm.

1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:19.020
 And long story short,

1:14:19.020 --> 1:14:20.480
 when I'm teaching people to angel invest,

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.920
 there's really two things that you cannot fake.

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:26.920
 One is a product that is built really well.

1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:30.140
 So if you look at Calm, Robinhood, Uber, Tesla, Amazon,

1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:33.180
 these products are transcendent.

1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:34.200
 They're well constructed.

1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:35.840
 There's craftsmanship to them.

1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:37.040
 They're great products.

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:39.440
 So you're saying not fundamentally like the idea,

1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:41.640
 but the execution of the actual craftsmanship

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:42.480
 of the construction.

1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:45.200
 The actual product is amazing.

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:48.840
 Then there's customers.

1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.800
 And that every business has ultimately a customer.

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:54.660
 And that customer, if they are in fact delighted

1:14:54.660 --> 1:14:57.760
 by that product, that's the magic.

1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:02.640
 Because you need a team to build the product.

1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:05.400
 And then you need customers to use the product.

1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:08.240
 And really those three vectors are undeniable.

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:12.340
 Now, you can have great teams that build a bad product,

1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:14.240
 doesn't happen too often.

1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:16.000
 Or you can have customers who don't like the product,

1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.160
 but generally speaking,

1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:20.920
 a great team will build a great product

1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:22.960
 or a good product that iterate,

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:25.160
 and then eventually delight customers.

1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.760
 And so most people say the team is the most important,

1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:32.040
 but there's a lot of smart people out there.

1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:36.640
 And let's assume that you can raise money for your idea,

1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:37.480
 or you have money,

1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:39.560
 or you can just convince people to do it for free.

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.500
 If you make a great product and it connects with users,

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:42.340
 that's the magic.

1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:43.160
 You look at Clubhouse,

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:45.660
 it's actually a really well designed product.

1:15:45.660 --> 1:15:47.680
 And that product is connecting with customers.

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:49.000
 And if you were to talk to the customers

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.280
 or look at the product,

1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.920
 you would see a well constructed product

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:53.520
 and a delighted customer.

1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:54.920
 And you can tell the delighted customer

1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:56.640
 by just the amount of time they use it.

1:15:56.640 --> 1:15:58.160
 That's called engagement.

1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:00.200
 It's the fancy word for how much they use it.

1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:02.880
 And Snapchat, when that was going around

1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:04.540
 and they were trying to raise money,

1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:07.240
 they had a fraction of the number of users,

1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:12.060
 but the top maybe third were opening the app every hour.

1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:14.960
 And nobody had ever seen that before.

1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:17.140
 People were using Facebook a couple of times a day,

1:16:17.140 --> 1:16:18.100
 the top users,

1:16:18.100 --> 1:16:22.480
 but nobody had ever seen people using it every day

1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:25.400
 for a hundred days in a row, every hour.

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:26.360
 And I was like, what's going on here?

1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.780
 It's like, oh, the ephemeral messaging,

1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:30.060
 and then the streaks.

1:16:30.060 --> 1:16:31.720
 They had created these streaks between people

1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:34.440
 where every day and then people would be like on vacation,

1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:35.720
 like, I just have to open my streak

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:36.800
 and keep my streak with Lex

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:38.620
 that we chatted every day going.

1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:40.320
 And so they had this like addictive nature to it.

1:16:40.320 --> 1:16:41.440
 And that's why Clubhouse was able

1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:43.240
 to garner so much investment

1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.880
 is the number of hours people were using it every month

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:49.500
 was just unbelievably off the charts.

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:50.700
 Some of that is execution,

1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:53.560
 but some of it is the weird magic of the...

1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:54.600
 Product market fit.

1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:57.160
 Yeah, so there's something, I mean, Clubhouse,

1:16:57.160 --> 1:16:59.560
 there's a, it's still a mystery to me

1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:01.680
 because I also use Discord voice.

1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:03.720
 There's an intimacy to voice.

1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:04.560
 Oh, for sure.

1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:06.560
 Well, you have people's, yeah, tent.

1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:10.240
 It's, well, but like the video gets in the way actually,

1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:11.120
 in a weird way.

1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:14.320
 There's a privacy when you just use voice.

1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:15.840
 People are not taking showers now, Lex.

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.720
 I mean, we're in a pandemic and people just roll out of bed.

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:20.560
 And the hair thing, nobody's getting haircuts.

1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:22.480
 Nobody's hair is good, nobody's getting haircuts.

1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:24.140
 People are wearing gym clothes.

1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:27.120
 I mean, Zoom is just horrific to be on Zoom

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:28.080
 for five hours a day.

1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:29.400
 It is exhausting.

1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:32.040
 Well, it does make me wonder what,

1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:33.680
 once we emerge from the pandemic,

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:36.240
 whether a product market fit,

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:38.320
 how that evolves with Clubhouse

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:39.240
 and all those kinds of things.

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.080
 Yeah, I know Clubhouse is a beneficiary

1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:42.280
 of the pandemic for sure.

1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:43.840
 When do you think the pandemic,

1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:47.440
 when do you think deaths will be under,

1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:50.320
 let's say 200 a day and we'll have 200 million people

1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:51.280
 on the other side of this?

1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:52.620
 Because that's kind of what it takes, right?

1:17:52.620 --> 1:17:54.340
 You gotta get to 150, 200 million people

1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:55.760
 on the other side in America?

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.160
 I haven't, you know,

1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:00.200
 I personally stopped deeply thinking about this

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:03.560
 because I've been frustrated for so long that.

1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:04.400
 You checked out.

1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:05.640
 I almost checked out

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:10.080
 because it psychologically allows me to carry on

1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:14.240
 because I thought for many months now

1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:16.600
 that testing needs to be done at scale.

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:17.780
 And it still hasn't gotten done.

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:18.620
 It hasn't been.

1:18:18.620 --> 1:18:19.440
 It's so ridiculous.

1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:20.440
 We gave up basically on testing.

1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:21.280
 We gave up.

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:23.160
 Because we're, and we're all sitting there

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:25.560
 waiting for vaccine to come along.

1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:29.520
 And the distribution of the vaccine is not, you know,

1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:31.200
 it's struggling from the same kind of things

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.040
 as the testing.

1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:33.680
 It's gonna take quite a bit of time.

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:36.960
 So it does, if everything goes great,

1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:39.920
 meaning there's not a second strand of the virus

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:44.000
 that's going to create a second major wave

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.600
 that I am cynical enough to think

1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:49.660
 that it won't be until mid summer

1:18:49.660 --> 1:18:51.600
 that we start opening back up.

1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:53.280
 Yeah, I think it's gonna be May, June.

1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:54.660
 I'm a little bit earlier than you.

1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:55.500
 I've been tracking it.

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.800
 There are 1.5 million shots in arms a day.

1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.040
 I think this vaccine's been undersold.

1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:00.880
 I mean, it's a miracle.

1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:04.600
 Not one person who was in the trials died, who took it,

1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:05.960
 and only one went to the hospital

1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:07.280
 and they weren't even put on a ventilator.

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:10.120
 So, and the hospitalizations are plummeting

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.400
 and we're at 10% now in the United States.

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:14.840
 At the pace, we're going at 1.5 a day.

1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:16.840
 I think when the Johnson & Johnson one comes out next month,

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.760
 it'll be 3 million a day maybe, two and a half.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:21.120
 And we already have 100 million people

1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:22.040
 who've likely had it.

1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:22.940
 So I've been doing the math.

1:19:22.940 --> 1:19:26.400
 I think we're like 60 days away, February, March.

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:28.120
 Yeah, sometime in April, I think.

1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:29.960
 Anybody's gonna be able to get a shot

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.360
 and the number of deaths is gonna go below 200 a day.

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:34.400
 And once that happens,

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:36.260
 I think people have had enough of this.

1:19:36.260 --> 1:19:37.560
 They're just gonna go YOLO.

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:41.680
 But see, the crucial piece for me

1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:44.740
 that I've been focusing on is the social media aspect

1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:49.480
 of how the, it's not just about the reality of deaths.

1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:53.780
 It's about the state of the collective intelligence

1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:54.840
 of the human species,

1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:58.280
 which is determined by our communication on social media.

1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:02.140
 So yeah, we can be collectively afraid,

1:20:02.140 --> 1:20:05.760
 the fear can spread, or it could be YOLO can spread,

1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:10.000
 or it could be like all different kinds of misinformation.

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.600
 And of course, during the election year,

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:16.680
 the politics influences our perception of what is true

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:21.640
 and not, but having real rigorous nuanced conversation

1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:25.440
 about this kind of stuff is the way out of this.

1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:27.520
 And that's where social media really comes in

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.320
 because social media drives division,

1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:32.600
 where people form tribes and so on.

1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:37.400
 And it feels like it's honestly a technology problem.

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:39.360
 People say it's a human problem,

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:42.520
 but it just feels like, I believe humans are good.

1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:44.840
 Technology can enable them to be thoughtful.

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:49.520
 We talked earlier about the magic of Silicon Valley

1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:51.160
 and then maybe going too far

1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:53.240
 with the Facebook groups example,

1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:55.640
 where you take out all that friction.

1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:59.480
 What happened was we used to have something called Rchron,

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:01.120
 reverse chronological order.

1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:03.000
 That's how you consume to feed.

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.720
 So any kind of social feed,

1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.680
 like Twitter was in reverse chronological order.

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:07.720
 The newest thing was up top

1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:09.760
 and you would just work your way backwards.

1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:12.520
 And so it gave this like really fresh feeling.

1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:13.800
 And then a guy named Dave Moran

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:16.520
 and the team over at Facebook realized,

1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:18.400
 you know, there are some things

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:21.080
 that got a lot of attention two hours ago.

1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:23.360
 And the stuff since then has not been as important.

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:25.760
 But if you miss that, there was a really good tweet

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.000
 where there was a really good update.

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.840
 Like somebody had a baby.

1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:32.920
 Can we get the baby one at the top?

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:34.320
 And it was like, well, how would we do that?

1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.680
 How would we know that that's the important one?

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:38.880
 It's like, well, let's put a like button on it

1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:40.360
 and let's see how many comments there are.

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:42.800
 So if it gets a lot of likes or comments or retweets,

1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:44.120
 let's show those first

1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:47.080
 and then we'll kind of mix in the most recent stuff.

1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:48.480
 And so when you're on Twitter,

1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:50.760
 and then when Facebook did that,

1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:52.640
 Facebook became so addicting

1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:54.000
 because Facebook was on,

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.760
 what has got the most engagement?

1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:56.840
 Put that first.

1:21:56.840 --> 1:21:58.400
 So every time you opened up Facebook,

1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:00.000
 you get the dopamine hit.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.760
 And then what happens when you see the Bar Mitzvah photo

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:06.360
 or, you know, the enraging story

1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:07.960
 about some injustice in the world?

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:09.960
 You retweet it, you write a comment,

1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:11.880
 you share it on your wall.

1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:15.840
 And thus this addiction to the outrageous,

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:18.840
 the outlandish, the inspiring occurred.

1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:20.880
 And it used to be like inspiring stuff,

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:23.040
 puppies or some heartwarming story.

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.280
 And then it got dark.

1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:27.000
 And then people started to realize,

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.160
 if I wanna show up on the top of my friend's feeds,

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:33.520
 if I say something controversial or I'm outraged,

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:34.960
 I get to the top.

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:36.720
 And then that's when outrage culture came in.

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:38.400
 And then that's when cancel culture came in.

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:39.720
 Everybody started to realize,

1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:42.800
 if I try to cancel that person for being a racist

1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:45.760
 or a sexist or a horrible human being

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:47.960
 or whatever they did that's wrong,

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:49.640
 I get to the top of the feed.

1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:51.240
 And we all collectively started playing

1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:52.800
 a very weird video game,

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:55.000
 which is how outraged can we all be?

1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.560
 And to get to the top of the list.

1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:59.080
 And then of course, with Trump, he realized it.

1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:00.120
 And he's like, okay, yeah,

1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:01.880
 I'm just gonna make fun of a celebrity

1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.480
 and I get more retweets.

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:05.040
 Okay, I'm gonna make fun of Rosie O'Donnell

1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:06.560
 for being overweight or something.

1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:08.680
 And he just starts attacking people.

1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:10.320
 And people are like, oh my God, what did he say?

1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.440
 And he copied that from Howard Stern.

1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:14.480
 Cause he was in New York and he used to be on Howard Stern.

1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:16.200
 Howard Stern took over all the dialogue

1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:18.520
 in the eighties and nineties because he was outrageous.

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:19.640
 And then Trump did that.

1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:22.520
 And then social media incorporated that

1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:23.800
 into the operating system.

1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:26.560
 It became the actual device of social media

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:28.720
 was the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:29.960
 We've got something incredible for you.

1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:32.480
 Everybody salivates like Pavlov's dog.

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:34.680
 Oh my God, I can be outraged.

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.200
 That's what's gotta be undone.

1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.440
 And the only way for that to be undone

1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:39.400
 is these things can't be billions of people

1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:42.280
 where the most outrageous thing

1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:44.400
 that happened in the world today

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:47.200
 in the last five minutes is now in front of you.

1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:48.640
 And that's why people have anxiety.

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:51.680
 They don't sleep and they doom scroll all night.

1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:54.480
 It's because the human mind was not meant to process

1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:56.840
 this much suffering, pain, anger.

1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:59.080
 And that's why we have all this mental health issues.

1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:03.720
 Also, young girls or even adults watching other people

1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:06.800
 post their private jets and their vacations

1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.280
 and YOLO adventures on their Instagram

1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:13.760
 to the point at which young people are now faking

1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:17.240
 being on private jets to put on their Instagram

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:22.240
 and creating this crazy FOMO around their Instagrams.

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:25.480
 We wonder why people are unhappy.

1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:27.040
 If you think everybody's on a private jet

1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:29.240
 going to some Michelin star restaurant

1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:32.160
 or whatever the coolest thing in the world is today,

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:34.440
 going to the Grammys, going to whatever,

1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:36.480
 Coachella, Burning Man.

1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:38.320
 You're like, ah, but I'm home.

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:43.120
 I'm in my house and I'm not at Burning Man.

1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.200
 Getting inadequate.

1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:45.040
 Exactly.

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:47.040
 So this whole system is creating

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:48.280
 the wrong set of incentives.

1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.560
 I tend to believe it's possible

1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:52.840
 to still have extremely high engagement

1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:55.640
 and create a successful profitable business

1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:58.480
 while encouraging personal growth,

1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:01.240
 like encouraging people to be the best version of themselves.

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:02.880
 I just think we haven't,

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:05.520
 we got the first generation of social networks.

1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.200
 I think a new generation needs to be built.

1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:08.040
 Absolutely.

1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:09.360
 Is that your plan for a business?

1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:13.200
 Well, I have a longer term plan in terms of ambition,

1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:18.200
 which is I believe in being able to have deep connection

1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:23.920
 between human and AI systems, like partners, friends.

1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:26.200
 There is a connection to there with social media.

1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:31.200
 I do think AI has a strong role to play in representing us,

1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:36.200
 in guiding us in how we consume social media.

1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:41.000
 So this algorithm that controls the feed for Facebook

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.960
 is a somewhat centralized algorithm,

1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:47.040
 but instead to give more power to the people,

1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:50.160
 individuals to where each one of us have our own algorithm.

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.200
 Bring your own algorithm.

1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:52.040
 Bring your own algorithm.

1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:52.880
 BYOA.

1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:54.080
 BYOA, I like it.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.800
 Instead of bringing your own alcohol,

1:25:55.800 --> 1:25:57.000
 bring your own algorithm.

1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.280
 Well, I mean, if you thought about it,

1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:02.160
 if we came and said, when I look at my Twitter feed,

1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:04.440
 I would like to see the people with,

1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:06.400
 who are the most helpful in the world,

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:09.100
 generous, kind, intelligent, considered,

1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:15.160
 commenting on things that I don't already know about

1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:17.240
 because I want to open my worldview.

1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:19.160
 That could be a beautiful thing for society.

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:22.960
 And actually Jack was talking about potentially on Twitter,

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.720
 letting people bring their own algorithms

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:26.480
 and sort their feeds themselves.

1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:27.320
 This would be a wonderful thing.

1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:30.320
 I think it's one of the reasons Clubhouse has resonated

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:32.600
 is it's such a diverse group of people

1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:35.600
 that I've been able to drop in on conversations

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.680
 with people who are nothing like me

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:40.160
 and listen in and hear conversations

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.000
 that I wouldn't normally be privy to.

1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:45.320
 And everybody's like, oh, come join as a speaker.

1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:46.160
 I want to do a room with you.

1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:47.760
 I get asked every day, can we do a room?

1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:48.600
 Can we do a room?

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.520
 Ask an angel investor, talk about startups.

1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:54.640
 And I'm like, my usage of Clubhouse

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:56.800
 is going on my Peloton treadmill,

1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:59.960
 putting Clubhouse on, picking a room and just listening.

1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:02.500
 It's so delightful for me as a podcaster

1:27:02.500 --> 1:27:05.560
 where my job is to talk, to sit back

1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:08.160
 and just put in a couple of miles and play chess

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.040
 and listen to a Clubhouse discussion

1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:15.040
 that is about relationships or some fashion or hip hop

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.600
 or whatever it is that I'm not part of.

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.100
 I just sit there and I listen and you learn.

1:27:20.100 --> 1:27:21.360
 It's like such a delightful thing.

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.560
 I always think about these kids who go to college

1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:25.420
 and I've always been so jealous of these Ivy League kids.

1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:26.960
 They go and they're like, oh, I got to go to class.

1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:29.280
 And I'm like, I would just love to sit there

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:33.120
 and listen to Professor Lex talk.

1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:34.240
 What a privilege to sit there

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:38.240
 and let somebody else drive and talk and listen and learn.

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:40.000
 Yeah, that's the beauty of podcasting.

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.400
 But of course, Clubhouse creates a whole nother experience

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:44.240
 where it's conversations, it's different.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:45.680
 I think it's going to be the in between.

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:48.640
 I like it as a, you release your podcast.

1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:51.060
 Like you and I are going to release this podcast, right?

1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:52.480
 And then at some point I'll have you on my pod

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:53.400
 when you want your startup.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:56.600
 And then at some point somebody is going to be like,

1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:58.680
 you and I will run into, and I ran into you.

1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:00.600
 I saw you were on Clubhouse the other night

1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.960
 and I was busy, but I was almost going to click on you

1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:05.240
 and say, let's start a room together.

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.480
 But you and I will start a room together

1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:07.640
 with Eric Weinstein or somebody

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:09.300
 or Sam Harris will jump in or Elon

1:28:09.300 --> 1:28:10.880
 and we'll have a different experience,

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.160
 which would just shoot the shit.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:14.400
 And it'll act as like a fabric

1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:19.860
 and a little filler between the tent pole podcasts, right?

1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:22.040
 Like you and Eric, you've done three, I think, with Eric.

1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.200
 Yeah, it was your four, I haven't released the fourth yet.

1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:26.400
 Oh, okay, so I watched all three

1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:28.440
 because I really thought your you way

1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:30.720
 and him like giving you advice

1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.160
 is very interesting dynamic.

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:34.560
 I thought it was very interesting dynamic.

1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:36.520
 And I find him like a fascinating cat.

1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:39.560
 We know everybody in common, except we've never met.

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:41.920
 It's very weird because you think about the social graph

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:42.760
 in the real world.

1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.240
 This is why I think augmented reality

1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:48.440
 is going to be such an amazing product.

1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:50.120
 I just have one killer feature I want

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.160
 for augmented reality, we wear our glasses.

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.000
 And when I look at you above your head,

1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:59.440
 I see the relationships we have

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.840
 and the things we've done together, right?

1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:04.160
 So I see, oh, you both know Sam Harris

1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:06.880
 or you had Elon on the podcast on this date

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.160
 or you and I were both at Burning Man in 2016.

1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:12.780
 So it's the most meaningful element

1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:14.540
 of our connection in the network, yeah.

1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:16.920
 And then, cause we would discover that through small talk,

1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:19.400
 but imagine you're like at a party and you look

1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:23.640
 and it just, people glow and you just see a glow

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:25.600
 around a person and like green means

1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:27.060
 you have some financial relationship.

1:29:27.060 --> 1:29:29.040
 Blue means you have some friendship one

1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:30.520
 or yellow means you have friendship one.

1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:33.160
 Blue means you know nothing about each other.

1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:34.080
 You have no connections.

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:37.000
 You're like, wow, these blue people have no connection to.

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:38.760
 These people, that one's glowing red.

1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:41.040
 We know seven or more people in common.

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:42.240
 And those are the seven people.

1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:45.200
 Oh, we should go talk about how we know each other.

1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:47.480
 That could, and that sort of happened with Facebook member

1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:49.440
 or MySpace where you were like, oh, you know that person,

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:50.720
 friend of a friend.

1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:53.600
 But that's what is going to be AR is like,

1:29:53.600 --> 1:29:57.320
 this is why I think if Apple figures out AR or Snapchat

1:29:57.320 --> 1:29:59.000
 and they just have those glasses, you know,

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.880
 forget about VR, it's just nauseating and whatever,

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:04.560
 but AR where you put the glasses on,

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:06.760
 you see the real world, but you augment it.

1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.760
 You make a, just like you were saying,

1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:12.320
 you make a frictionless, a very low friction

1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:13.880
 to make a deep human connection

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:17.080
 because you have all the basic elements there already.

1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:18.720
 Now think about the unintended consequences

1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:20.560
 of what I just described.

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:21.800
 It could get creepy and weird.

1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:23.640
 The privacy thing.

1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:25.960
 I mean, people will, here's the thing,

1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:28.560
 people, your privacy is an illusion.

1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:30.640
 Like all this information is there.

1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:35.440
 And then people are more than willing to give up privacy

1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:39.600
 in exchange for some value, you know, it's a value trade.

1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:43.560
 And giving, if my Tesla,

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:45.420
 when I'm driving in the direction of my house,

1:30:45.420 --> 1:30:47.800
 just starts the navigation and saves me three clicks

1:30:47.800 --> 1:30:49.440
 and that friction's gone,

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.760
 I'm willing to give Tesla my location

1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:53.660
 and my home address, right?

1:30:53.660 --> 1:30:55.040
 I'm not willing to give Zuckerberg anything

1:30:55.040 --> 1:30:56.960
 because I don't trust him, but you get the idea.

1:30:56.960 --> 1:30:59.240
 I mean, it will be that way with like DNA and other things

1:30:59.240 --> 1:31:01.200
 at some point we'll just be like, yeah, just take my DNA.

1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:02.320
 Like I don't, yeah, sure.

1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:05.040
 People can look and see that I'm a mental midget

1:31:05.040 --> 1:31:06.800
 and my IQ is like lower than,

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:08.560
 I don't want to bring the bell curve up or whatever,

1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:10.960
 but you could figure out,

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:13.880
 like if we all put our DNA in a sequence online

1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:17.120
 and be like, oh yeah, you know, Lex has got 10 more IQ points

1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:20.040
 than Jcal and, you know, Sam's got 10 more than Lex.

1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:22.200
 And all of a sudden people are like all bed out of shape

1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:23.880
 about it, but what if they, we did that?

1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:25.600
 And they were like, and by the way, you also,

1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:27.440
 all three of you are going to get Parkinson's

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:29.440
 unless you do X, Y, and Z,

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:31.880
 unless you eat more blueberries or whatever we figure out.

1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:33.440
 They're going to accept it pretty quickly.

1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:35.240
 Yeah, that's brave new world.

1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:36.120
 Brave new world.

1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:39.780
 I have to ask you, you're, just like you were saying,

1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:42.660
 you're one of the world experts in investing

1:31:42.660 --> 1:31:47.660
 and in startups, yeah, VC and so on.

1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:50.600
 From the perspective of the startup,

1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:54.120
 I was always kind of skeptical of raising money.

1:31:54.120 --> 1:31:57.320
 It feels like people do it too quickly, too easily,

1:31:57.320 --> 1:32:00.420
 but I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:04.520
 When is the, when should a startup raise money?

1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:07.160
 And from the perspective of the investor,

1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:10.120
 when should the investor invest in a startup?

1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:12.080
 Like, is there a timing thing here?

1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:14.520
 Is there a, what, yeah, what?

1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:16.560
 It's a very important question

1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:19.460
 because the venture capital community

1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:24.120
 is only going to fund, you know, sub 1% of enterprises

1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:26.080
 started in the United States every year,

1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:29.840
 like maybe 10 basis points of them, like one in a thousand.

1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:33.360
 And the reason is it's jet fuel.

1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:35.080
 You only want to take that money

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:36.880
 if you really want to build something big

1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:38.400
 and you want to build it fast.

1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:42.080
 And when you put jet fuel behind a startup,

1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:43.560
 as we've seen with other rockets,

1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:45.920
 things can blow up and people can die.

1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:47.280
 You know, it's not people literally dying,

1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:49.340
 but the business can go up in smoke, right?

1:32:49.340 --> 1:32:52.880
 Like rockets get blown up all the time at SpaceX

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.160
 as part of their ambitious plans.

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.240
 And startups, seven out of 10 startups we invest in,

1:32:57.240 --> 1:32:58.600
 go to zero.

1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:00.160
 Now, if you were to start the business

1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:01.900
 and only build it off customer revenue

1:33:01.900 --> 1:33:03.980
 and use your own money and go nice and slow

1:33:03.980 --> 1:33:05.620
 and grow 10% a year,

1:33:05.620 --> 1:33:09.360
 the chances of you blowing up the rocket are very low

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:11.040
 because you're riding a bicycle.

1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:13.400
 You can go a little faster,

1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:15.560
 but the bicycle can only go so fast.

1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:18.300
 And once you start taking that money,

1:33:18.300 --> 1:33:21.880
 the way venture capital is constructed

1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:26.880
 as in the mix of like MIT or Harvard's endowments is,

1:33:28.180 --> 1:33:31.240
 you know, we're going to put some money into safe things

1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:32.080
 and then we're going to have

1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:33.800
 these really binary things over here.

1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:38.400
 And they probably put 5% in venture capital traditionally.

1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:40.640
 It's grown to 20% just as a function

1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:42.720
 of how successful it's been.

1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:44.920
 So, you know, the Harvards of the world and MIT

1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:48.040
 is probably want five or 10% in venture,

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.120
 but it's grown to 25% because, you know,

1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:53.540
 companies like Airbnb and Uber have grown so big and Tesla.

1:33:53.540 --> 1:33:56.680
 But the goal is in these venture funds,

1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:58.660
 we're going to invest in 30 names

1:33:58.660 --> 1:34:01.660
 and one or two of them are going to return three times

1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:03.000
 the capital we've deployed.

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.200
 So it's a $300 million fund and there's 30 names

1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:06.440
 and they each got 10 million.

1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:08.360
 That means one of the 10 million

1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:11.120
 is going to return the fund plus.

1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.920
 So that means it has to grow 30X and then 60X

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:17.000
 to double the fund.

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.600
 And you're really supposed to be doing

1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:19.960
 three times cash on cash.

1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:21.840
 So that $300 million funds,

1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:25.040
 the expectation is in 10 years to return 900 million,

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:27.200
 triple the person's money as opposed to the stock market,

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:29.360
 which doubles your money in the same period.

1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720
 So you're supposed to do 25% annualized returns

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:35.520
 in order to triple the money.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.960
 And maybe I have an outlying chance

1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:38.060
 of four or five times the money,

1:34:38.060 --> 1:34:39.840
 which does happen sometimes when you have an outlier

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:42.660
 in your portfolio like Uber or Facebook was.

1:34:42.660 --> 1:34:46.600
 And what that means is the venture capitalist behavior

1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:47.840
 in the game they're playing is different

1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:48.920
 than you as the founder.

1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:51.560
 You as the founder, you may really care about this

1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:53.800
 and it dying really matters to you.

1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:55.160
 And then you got a venture capitalist who's like,

1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:56.080
 we're betting on 30 names,

1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:59.680
 we need two of them to hit it out of the park, maybe three,

1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:01.340
 and nothing else is meaningful.

1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:05.820
 So now you start thinking about the game theory there.

1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:09.780
 You're dealing with money that is coming in

1:35:09.780 --> 1:35:13.660
 that only cares about you going 100X.

1:35:13.660 --> 1:35:17.100
 It's a whole different ball game.

1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:19.180
 Whereas if you build off revenue, you don't have to do that.

1:35:19.180 --> 1:35:20.900
 And if you look at a company like com.com,

1:35:20.900 --> 1:35:23.300
 we invested at 5 million, the next round they did was 250.

1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:25.220
 They were so capital efficient

1:35:25.220 --> 1:35:27.900
 that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue

1:35:27.900 --> 1:35:30.180
 to millions of dollars a month in revenue

1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:32.300
 over those four years since we invested

1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:34.780
 and they didn't raise money in between.

1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:35.980
 It was unbelievable.

1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:37.780
 And I've only seen this happen three or four times.

1:35:37.780 --> 1:35:40.980
 So it doesn't happen all this capital efficient meaning

1:35:40.980 --> 1:35:43.540
 based on customer revenue alone

1:35:43.540 --> 1:35:47.100
 plus some small amount of fundraising, you're able to go.

1:35:47.100 --> 1:35:49.500
 Like how hard is it to do that?

1:35:49.500 --> 1:35:52.500
 It takes extreme product market fit.

1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:54.380
 You have to have a great price for your product

1:35:54.380 --> 1:35:55.680
 that has a great margin.

1:35:56.860 --> 1:35:59.260
 Yeah, and if you're doing something in hardware,

1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:00.380
 it's probably impossible

1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:01.660
 because it's super capital intensive.

1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:03.780
 So it's probably gotta be a software business.

1:36:03.780 --> 1:36:05.720
 Hardware businesses take a lot more.

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:08.620
 Do venture capitals get in the way at all of the business

1:36:08.620 --> 1:36:11.060
 or is it possible to get out of the way?

1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:13.500
 Yeah, if you get young venture capitalists

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:14.780
 who are starting their career,

1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:16.660
 they're very nervous and scared

1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:18.780
 because they're putting all these bets.

1:36:18.780 --> 1:36:21.820
 And then there's a very weird thing that happens.

1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:23.860
 The bad news comes first.

1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:26.860
 So companies that don't work out

1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:28.660
 go out of business immediately.

1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:31.580
 So if it's not gonna be Com or Robinhood or Uber,

1:36:32.980 --> 1:36:35.380
 you know you have one of those great successes

1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:38.560
 somewhere in your five, six, seven, eight as an investor.

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.420
 What is the first five years like?

1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:42.620
 First five years, you feel like an idiot.

1:36:42.620 --> 1:36:45.780
 Let's say you make these 10 bets.

1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:49.640
 In year two, two or three of them come back

1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:50.820
 and they don't have product market fit

1:36:50.820 --> 1:36:51.820
 and they're out of money.

1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:52.820
 And they say, can we have more money?

1:36:52.820 --> 1:36:54.620
 You say, no, we have to go get it from somebody else

1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:55.440
 because you have to prove

1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:56.740
 that there's still a market for it.

1:36:56.740 --> 1:36:58.220
 We may keep our pro rata.

1:36:58.220 --> 1:36:59.420
 We may put a little bit in

1:36:59.420 --> 1:37:00.980
 to maintain our percentage ownership,

1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:03.980
 but we're not going to give you another big chunk of money.

1:37:04.980 --> 1:37:06.240
 And that company dies.

1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:08.820
 So now you've got 10 million, poof, up in smoke.

1:37:08.820 --> 1:37:10.260
 Boom, 10 million up in smoke.

1:37:10.260 --> 1:37:11.780
 So this is called the J curve

1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:14.440
 where your performance goes down.

1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:16.460
 And then it's only in years four or five and six

1:37:16.460 --> 1:37:17.300
 it starts going up.

1:37:17.300 --> 1:37:18.820
 And what you're seeing right now is the people

1:37:18.820 --> 1:37:21.060
 who started like I did in 2000,

1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:22.620
 you know, just 11, 12 years ago.

1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:24.660
 In 2009, I started investing.

1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:26.380
 We all look like geniuses.

1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:27.460
 Why?

1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:29.020
 We're at the end of the cycle.

1:37:29.020 --> 1:37:32.460
 We invested after when the stock market was on the floor

1:37:32.460 --> 1:37:34.100
 after the financial crisis.

1:37:34.100 --> 1:37:35.780
 And it's gone straight up since.

1:37:35.780 --> 1:37:36.620
 So everybody looked,

1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:37.500
 there's a couple of little blips in there,

1:37:37.500 --> 1:37:38.580
 but generally speaking,

1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:40.460
 there hasn't been like a major crash

1:37:40.460 --> 1:37:41.600
 with the exception of the pandemic crash,

1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.860
 but that bounced right back.

1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:45.740
 And so, you know, it takes a decade to figure out

1:37:45.740 --> 1:37:47.380
 if you're good at it.

1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:48.780
 And then if the market crashes again,

1:37:48.780 --> 1:37:49.880
 everybody feels like an idiot again,

1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:50.900
 the cycle starts again.

1:37:50.900 --> 1:37:53.820
 So you are now as a founder,

1:37:53.820 --> 1:37:56.880
 you are now inserting yourself into that casino.

1:37:56.880 --> 1:37:58.540
 And now you've got all these other forces

1:37:58.540 --> 1:37:59.860
 pushing and pulling.

1:37:59.860 --> 1:38:00.900
 And you're growing,

1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:03.220
 let's say your company was growing 50%.

1:38:03.220 --> 1:38:04.460
 You feel like, wow, I'm successful.

1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:05.620
 I made a million dollars last year.

1:38:05.620 --> 1:38:07.420
 Now I'm doing a million and a half.

1:38:07.420 --> 1:38:09.460
 And the first thing a VC is gonna say to you is,

1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:10.300
 how do we triple?

1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:12.140
 We're growing too slow.

1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:13.180
 See, but that's, like you said,

1:38:13.180 --> 1:38:15.420
 that beautifully is a rocket fuel.

1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:19.020
 It's, in a sense, it's a kind of motivation.

1:38:19.020 --> 1:38:19.840
 It's a drive.

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:21.020
 I mean, it's a positive.

1:38:21.020 --> 1:38:22.060
 So if you want that.

1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:23.700
 Yes, if you want that.

1:38:23.700 --> 1:38:24.580
 If you want that,

1:38:24.580 --> 1:38:27.100
 if you want to go to Navy SEAL school,

1:38:27.100 --> 1:38:28.100
 you're gonna be in pain

1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:29.820
 and they're gonna put that hose in your face

1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:30.940
 while you're underwater

1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:32.740
 with your hands tied behind your back in the pool

1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:34.020
 and you're gonna be choking.

1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:35.580
 And they may have to do CPR on you.

1:38:35.580 --> 1:38:38.540
 And like every couple of years, tragically,

1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:40.260
 somebody dies in Navy SEAL school.

1:38:40.260 --> 1:38:41.180
 Yeah, well.

1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:42.700
 Does it mean we're getting rid of the Navy SEALs?

1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:43.940
 Brock, if he dies, he dies.

1:38:43.940 --> 1:38:45.340
 I don't know if you know David Goggins

1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:46.180
 as by any chance.

1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:47.000
 I do.

1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:47.840
 I mean, I don't know him personally,

1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:48.820
 but oh my Lord.

1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:52.260
 So I'm running 48 miles together with him in person

1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:53.100
 in a month.

1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:55.380
 What, you're doing an ultra marathon?

1:38:55.380 --> 1:38:58.520
 With him and probably other stuff

1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:01.100
 because he enjoys just breaking people,

1:39:01.100 --> 1:39:01.940
 making them cry.

1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:03.180
 Oh my God, I'm so jelly.

1:39:03.180 --> 1:39:05.140
 So no, well, I offered,

1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:08.260
 we agreed a while ago to do a podcast

1:39:08.260 --> 1:39:10.980
 and he's like, oh yeah, come, we'll do it this day.

1:39:10.980 --> 1:39:13.100
 Is he in the Bay Area?

1:39:13.100 --> 1:39:14.340
 I don't know where the hell he is,

1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:15.460
 but we're doing it.

1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:17.580
 And I don't think I'm supposed to say where it is,

1:39:17.580 --> 1:39:19.540
 but it's not anywhere close to anywhere of this.

1:39:19.540 --> 1:39:21.220
 It's in the middle of nowhere.

1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:24.220
 But he seems to be in a bunch of different locations.

1:39:24.220 --> 1:39:27.260
 Like he's in Oregon or something like that.

1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:29.260
 What does he do for outside of writing books

1:39:29.260 --> 1:39:30.100
 and being inspirational?

1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:31.900
 Does he actually train people or like?

1:39:31.900 --> 1:39:35.660
 No, he's just, he's a full time insane.

1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:40.420
 Like he fights forest fires like for a few months a year

1:39:40.420 --> 1:39:42.900
 as a farmer, like unpaid labor.

1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:45.020
 Like he, you know, there's a bunch of people

1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:47.700
 who are like him, like Navy Seals and so on

1:39:47.700 --> 1:39:49.300
 that kind of make a career,

1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:51.220
 automotivational speak and all that kind of stuff.

1:39:51.220 --> 1:39:53.100
 He's not interested in any of that.

1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:57.940
 He's literally interested in just doing hard shit

1:39:57.940 --> 1:39:59.100
 all the time.

1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:00.100
 Breaking himself.

1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:00.940
 Breaking himself personally.

1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:03.180
 He seems like he wants to break himself.

1:40:03.180 --> 1:40:04.940
 And that book is amazing.

1:40:04.940 --> 1:40:06.380
 And the audio book's amazing

1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:08.220
 when he's talking about how fat he was

1:40:08.220 --> 1:40:10.900
 and how he just had to go and keep running

1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:14.420
 and his like legs are broken and he's just super pain

1:40:14.420 --> 1:40:15.260
 and he just goes through it.

1:40:15.260 --> 1:40:16.580
 It's really inspiring.

1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:17.660
 Inspiring thing also.

1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:19.620
 You could have videotaped yourself doing this.

1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:22.300
 I can't wait to see you get destroyed.

1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:26.900
 This is gonna be so entertaining for the lax audience.

1:40:26.900 --> 1:40:28.340
 The pain.

1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:32.260
 But the other inspiring thing is he's happily married

1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:34.260
 and there's a partnership there that's, you know,

1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:38.020
 everybody finds this attention as a push and pull

1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:40.260
 that's beautiful, I think.

1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:43.140
 But in speaking of a beautiful push and pull,

1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:45.940
 how about that transition?

1:40:45.940 --> 1:40:47.420
 Yeah, here we go.

1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:50.900
 You and Chamath on, he's a friend of yours.

1:40:50.900 --> 1:40:52.700
 Besties. Besties, yeah.

1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:53.540
 Yeah, good friend.

1:40:53.540 --> 1:40:55.420
 I mean, there's very few people in my life,

1:40:55.420 --> 1:40:58.940
 him, Elon, David Sachs, John Brockmans.

1:40:58.940 --> 1:41:01.180
 Very few people have supported me as much as those folks.

1:41:01.180 --> 1:41:02.460
 I mean, I'm a huge debt.

1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:05.660
 So he's also cohost on the All In podcast.

1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:07.420
 We taped episode 21 today.

1:41:07.420 --> 1:41:08.260
 Oh, today?

1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:09.540
 Yeah, every Friday now.

1:41:09.540 --> 1:41:10.380
 They wanna do every Friday.

1:41:10.380 --> 1:41:12.060
 They're addicted like me and you are to podcasts.

1:41:12.060 --> 1:41:14.260
 So you're going to release it when?

1:41:14.260 --> 1:41:16.260
 It's probably released as we're sitting here.

1:41:16.260 --> 1:41:17.820
 Okay, beautiful.

1:41:17.820 --> 1:41:18.780
 Special guest on it.

1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:22.020
 We had Draymond Green from the Warriors phone in.

1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.180
 So we had our first guest.

1:41:23.180 --> 1:41:24.020
 Awesome.

1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:25.140
 Yeah, so it's really funny

1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:28.100
 because he plays poker with us and we're all besties, so.

1:41:28.100 --> 1:41:28.940
 Beautiful.

1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:33.100
 So you guys went pretty heated against each other

1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:35.060
 versus on Robin Hood.

1:41:35.060 --> 1:41:37.540
 There's just two things I wanna ask.

1:41:37.540 --> 1:41:41.020
 First, on the actual Robin Hood discussion

1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:42.860
 and the Wall Street Best discussion,

1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:44.340
 can you steel man his argument?

1:41:44.340 --> 1:41:45.900
 What was the nature of the disagreement?

1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:49.020
 Where, yeah, what is the little,

1:41:49.020 --> 1:41:51.700
 because I don't think it's as big as spaces

1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:53.940
 it came off as sounding.

1:41:53.940 --> 1:41:55.420
 What is the nature of the disagreement?

1:41:55.420 --> 1:42:00.420
 He felt that Robin Hood turned off trading

1:42:01.380 --> 1:42:04.260
 because the hedge funds told them to

1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:07.220
 and that they were bowing down

1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:08.420
 to the pressure of the hedge funds.

1:42:08.420 --> 1:42:12.020
 That's not true, but in a vacuum of information,

1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:13.580
 you know what happens to people's minds,

1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:15.060
 conspiracy theories abound.

1:42:15.060 --> 1:42:16.980
 And sometimes there is a conspiracy theory

1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:21.140
 and sometimes there's just the appearance of impropriety

1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:24.140
 or a bunch of related things.

1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:26.860
 Like when you look at the Trump situation with Russia,

1:42:26.860 --> 1:42:29.980
 like was Trump trying to coordinate with Russia

1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:34.460
 or the Russians just screwing with a bunch of like neophyte

1:42:34.460 --> 1:42:37.820
 idiotic dipshits like Donald Trump Jr.

1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:39.100
 who don't know any better.

1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:42.220
 And they don't know that you shouldn't meet with the Russians

1:42:42.220 --> 1:42:43.860
 and if you do meet with the Russians,

1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:45.260
 you are probably a useful idiot.

1:42:45.260 --> 1:42:46.780
 You probably should tell the FBI.

1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:48.980
 Like they're just a bunch of idiots in all likelihood,

1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:49.820
 who knows?

1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:51.340
 And there's a vacuum of information.

1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:53.020
 And there's a vacuum of information, we don't know.

1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:55.180
 And the Russians are trying to compromise everybody.

1:42:55.180 --> 1:42:57.660
 So would you call it a conspiracy

1:42:57.660 --> 1:43:02.260
 or would you call it an attempted conspiracy?

1:43:02.260 --> 1:43:03.380
 There was no conspiracy here.

1:43:03.380 --> 1:43:07.300
 What it was was Robin Hood needed to raise billions

1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:10.420
 of dollars to say solvent in all likelihood.

1:43:10.420 --> 1:43:13.340
 And they weren't allowed to talk about it.

1:43:13.340 --> 1:43:15.900
 So they were forced into not talking about it

1:43:15.900 --> 1:43:18.300
 in all likelihood and had to come up with that money

1:43:18.300 --> 1:43:19.140
 or shut down.

1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:21.620
 And then what got me upset with Chamath

1:43:21.620 --> 1:43:25.340
 and we had a talk afterwards that people don't know about,

1:43:25.340 --> 1:43:27.300
 I'll talk about it here for the first time.

1:43:27.300 --> 1:43:30.980
 On Sunday, we had to have a little, we had to air it out.

1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:33.100
 Yeah, in the episode after you guys sound like

1:43:33.100 --> 1:43:35.380
 you've had a private, you've made up.

1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:37.580
 We had a private discussion, just one on one.

1:43:37.580 --> 1:43:39.700
 And we said, listen, we love each other, we're besties.

1:43:39.700 --> 1:43:41.380
 We've always been there for each other.

1:43:41.380 --> 1:43:42.740
 What happened here?

1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:46.260
 And what happened there is I'm fiercely loyal to my folks,

1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:50.220
 whether it's Chamath or Travis from Uber or Saks or whoever.

1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:51.860
 I'm just a loyal guy.

1:43:51.860 --> 1:43:54.140
 And I'm always ride or die with my founders.

1:43:54.140 --> 1:43:56.100
 If I invest in them, even if they make a mistake

1:43:56.100 --> 1:43:57.340
 and Uber made plenty of mistakes,

1:43:57.340 --> 1:43:59.980
 I always went on CNBC, on my podcast and said,

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:01.540
 hey, we're gonna fix these things.

1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:03.340
 I'm in touch with the team.

1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:06.140
 Mistakes were made, we're gonna solve them.

1:44:06.140 --> 1:44:08.300
 This is a group of people with great intent

1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:10.420
 who want to make the world a better place.

1:44:10.420 --> 1:44:11.260
 And you know what?

1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:13.380
 I was hated for a period of time with Uber.

1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:15.540
 I was hated for it last week with Robinhood.

1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:18.460
 I got a lot of blowback.

1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:20.780
 But I think in both of those cases, eventually I was right.

1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:22.220
 Uber is doing great stuff in the world.

1:44:22.220 --> 1:44:23.980
 Robinhood is doing great stuff in the world.

1:44:23.980 --> 1:44:26.020
 And I like to be loyal to my investments

1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.700
 and my partners to just,

1:44:27.700 --> 1:44:30.140
 I feel like if you invest and you're on the team,

1:44:31.300 --> 1:44:32.580
 you have really three choices.

1:44:32.580 --> 1:44:35.540
 You either fight for your team, you can go silent,

1:44:35.540 --> 1:44:37.100
 or you can throw your team under the bus.

1:44:37.100 --> 1:44:39.160
 And I've watched investors throw the team

1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:41.060
 that they invested in that made them a bunch of money

1:44:41.060 --> 1:44:42.860
 under the bus, not acceptable to me.

1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:44.420
 And being quiet's not acceptable to me.

1:44:44.420 --> 1:44:46.220
 So I always ask the founder, do you want me to,

1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:48.560
 is it okay if I go out and defend you publicly?

1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:49.980
 If they say yes, I do it.

1:44:49.980 --> 1:44:50.820
 And then.

1:44:50.820 --> 1:44:51.660
 That's beautiful, by the way,

1:44:51.660 --> 1:44:52.620
 because what else do we have in this world

1:44:52.620 --> 1:44:53.700
 if not friendship?

1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:54.620
 Loyalty means everything to me.

1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:57.060
 I grew up in Brooklyn where if you were not loyal

1:44:57.940 --> 1:45:00.860
 and you were not loyal to your crew,

1:45:00.860 --> 1:45:03.580
 then you were a Ronin.

1:45:03.580 --> 1:45:07.700
 You were out there on your own flailing in the,

1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:09.640
 trust me, you do not want to be on your own

1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:12.260
 in 1970s, 80s, Brooklyn, Manhattan.

1:45:12.260 --> 1:45:13.360
 You need to have a crew with you.

1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.780
 I've gotten into, you don't want to get into a fight

1:45:15.780 --> 1:45:18.260
 with 10 guys and be alone or just be with,

1:45:18.260 --> 1:45:19.940
 you need a crew to survive.

1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:23.840
 So I just learned early on, my dad owned a bar,

1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:25.460
 just drilled into me being loyal.

1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:26.540
 And so for whatever reason,

1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:28.300
 I'm a bulldog when it comes to loyalty.

1:45:28.300 --> 1:45:30.280
 And Shemov came out and said,

1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:32.980
 these guys need to go to jail and they're scumbags.

1:45:32.980 --> 1:45:34.540
 And I'm trying to defend them.

1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:36.700
 And I'm in a position where I can't defend them

1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:38.220
 because I don't have complete information.

1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:39.460
 There is no complete information.

1:45:39.460 --> 1:45:40.740
 It's in the heat of the moment.

1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:43.300
 And then it becomes the number one story.

1:45:43.300 --> 1:45:45.100
 And it's my number three investment.

1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:48.180
 And Shemov has a competing company, SoFi.

1:45:49.260 --> 1:45:50.940
 And he's killing my guys.

1:45:50.940 --> 1:45:53.100
 And then I started killing his guys.

1:45:53.100 --> 1:45:54.260
 And then all of a sudden we're like,

1:45:54.260 --> 1:45:56.060
 wait a second, we're best friends.

1:45:56.980 --> 1:46:00.400
 And we're swinging our swords at each other.

1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:04.700
 And we're a group of the seven samurai who fight together.

1:46:04.700 --> 1:46:06.540
 When did we turn on each other?

1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:07.980
 And then everybody else who's on the pod,

1:46:07.980 --> 1:46:10.780
 the two Davids, you know, both on the spectrum a bit,

1:46:10.780 --> 1:46:13.020
 they got a little Asperger's or whatever.

1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:13.860
 No offense, Les.

1:46:15.260 --> 1:46:16.080
 None taken.

1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:16.920
 None taken.

1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:17.760
 I'm not saying, you know,

1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:22.500
 but there is, you're into AI and you might be somewhere.

1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:23.740
 It's not a coincidence, yeah.

1:46:23.740 --> 1:46:24.580
 Might not be a coincidence.

1:46:24.580 --> 1:46:26.200
 Anyway, we upgraded the two Davids firmware.

1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:27.620
 We're gonna upgrade your firmware after this.

1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:30.700
 I'll give you, yeah, you're on the 1.5.

1:46:30.700 --> 1:46:32.060
 You have the three emotions now.

1:46:32.060 --> 1:46:32.900
 Or should we add a fourth?

1:46:32.900 --> 1:46:34.140
 Do you wanna go with joy?

1:46:34.140 --> 1:46:35.460
 I'm on the 2.0 already.

1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:37.020
 You're on the 2.0, you got the joy.

1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:38.620
 How's it working out for you, the joy chip?

1:46:38.620 --> 1:46:39.460
 It's difficult.

1:46:39.460 --> 1:46:40.280
 It's painful. It's difficult.

1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:41.120
 You'll get there.

1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:42.180
 Just let it happen, Lex.

1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:44.940
 Just let the joy happen.

1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:47.220
 So anyway, we just talked about it offline

1:46:47.220 --> 1:46:49.200
 and we decided like, listen,

1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:52.020
 we didn't pregame that episode.

1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:53.860
 And I happened to be skiing with my family.

1:46:53.860 --> 1:46:55.500
 I had taken the first like vacation

1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:57.540
 since this goddamn pandemic started.

1:46:57.540 --> 1:46:58.820
 And I was having a wonderful time.

1:46:58.820 --> 1:46:59.900
 And then this whole thing blows up.

1:46:59.900 --> 1:47:01.820
 I'm coming off the mountain,

1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:04.020
 just having a great time with my daughter skiing.

1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:06.100
 And you know, and then I'm mixing it up with him.

1:47:06.100 --> 1:47:07.940
 And you know, he had a short fuse about it

1:47:07.940 --> 1:47:09.300
 because he was triggered, he told me,

1:47:09.300 --> 1:47:12.200
 because he really feels like he's fighting

1:47:12.200 --> 1:47:14.500
 to defend, you know, the every man.

1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:16.500
 And I was like, that's what my team's doing.

1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:19.180
 That's why they named the company Robinhood.

1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:21.340
 We're on the same side here.

1:47:21.340 --> 1:47:22.180
 And then over time,

1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:23.660
 we've started to see the explanation come out.

1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:26.780
 And you know, people who are friends

1:47:26.780 --> 1:47:28.120
 are gonna have disagreements.

1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:30.580
 In the podcast, it happened to happen very publicly.

1:47:30.580 --> 1:47:32.080
 And we didn't know it was gonna become

1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:35.220
 the number one story in the world.

1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:36.980
 If Trump still had his Twitter handle,

1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:39.220
 this would not have been a story.

1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:41.540
 Trump would have said something about GameStop

1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:44.220
 and he would have coopted the entire conversation.

1:47:44.220 --> 1:47:47.620
 So in a way, going back to our censorship discussion,

1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:50.300
 I might actually be in favor of Trump being censored

1:47:51.180 --> 1:47:56.180
 only because how delightful has it been since January 20th

1:47:57.300 --> 1:48:00.340
 that we can all focus on something other than him.

1:48:01.380 --> 1:48:03.260
 He was exhausting.

1:48:03.260 --> 1:48:06.620
 I mean, the amount of cycles he took on our processors.

1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:08.940
 He monetized the conversation.

1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:12.020
 And now this is a little bit more of a distributed,

1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:12.860
 like this bunch of.

1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:13.700
 Yeah, everybody gets a chance

1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:14.940
 to be the number one news story.

1:48:14.940 --> 1:48:17.420
 Everybody gets a chance to discuss it.

1:48:17.420 --> 1:48:20.740
 So on a scale of one to 10, how much do you love Chamath?

1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:21.740
 Oh, it's 11.

1:48:21.740 --> 1:48:23.220
 I mean, I love Chamath.

1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:24.780
 I mean, we played cards last night.

1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:25.620
 We're besties.

1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:27.900
 And you know, I would literally jump

1:48:27.900 --> 1:48:29.620
 in front of a bullet for him.

1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:31.180
 I mean, what's the lesson in that discussion?

1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:32.940
 Because it was super, I wouldn't.

1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:35.300
 I think the love was felt and the respect was felt

1:48:35.300 --> 1:48:36.300
 throughout even when you guys

1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:38.740
 are going pretty vicious on each other.

1:48:38.740 --> 1:48:40.100
 Is there a lesson to be learned?

1:48:40.100 --> 1:48:41.500
 Do you regret any of that conversation?

1:48:41.500 --> 1:48:44.420
 No, I mean, I think he told me

1:48:44.420 --> 1:48:45.740
 that he regretted some of the things he said.

1:48:45.740 --> 1:48:47.020
 He said publicly on the podcast,

1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:48.060
 like, listen, I was a little hot.

1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:50.860
 I may have said things in the heat of the moment.

1:48:50.860 --> 1:48:52.580
 But I don't live with too much regret

1:48:52.580 --> 1:48:54.220
 because I always think about intent.

1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:58.260
 As one of the nuance and intent have been totally lost.

1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:01.340
 The idea that we could have any kind of a nuanced discussion

1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:04.220
 about things seems to have been forgotten.

1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:07.460
 And the fact that people don't look at people's intent.

1:49:07.460 --> 1:49:11.180
 If you hurt somebody's feelings or you disrespect somebody

1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:14.540
 or you do something mean or whatever,

1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:16.940
 I always look at the intent, you know?

1:49:16.940 --> 1:49:20.620
 And I've had people attack me and I look at the intent

1:49:20.620 --> 1:49:23.260
 and I'm like, that person feels bad about themselves.

1:49:23.260 --> 1:49:25.780
 Or maybe I said something and I insulted them

1:49:25.780 --> 1:49:27.340
 and that's why their blowback's there.

1:49:27.340 --> 1:49:29.300
 So I always try to think what's the intent of the person.

1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:30.860
 And then almost universally,

1:49:30.860 --> 1:49:33.660
 you talk to somebody and you find out,

1:49:33.660 --> 1:49:37.220
 you ascribe some crazy intent that's not there.

1:49:37.220 --> 1:49:38.540
 And they're like, oh yeah, you know what happened?

1:49:38.540 --> 1:49:39.860
 I got in a fight with my spouse

1:49:39.860 --> 1:49:41.500
 and I didn't sleep last night

1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:44.060
 and I've had a lot of anxiety about my business.

1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:47.460
 And I just snapped and said something about you.

1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:48.540
 And it's like, oh, okay.

1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:52.500
 Like I literally had somebody on Twitter this past summer.

1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:53.700
 I had said something.

1:49:54.860 --> 1:49:57.740
 I was complaining about a New York Times journalist

1:49:57.740 --> 1:49:58.740
 and something I thought was wrong.

1:49:58.740 --> 1:50:00.820
 And this person was a fan of that journalist.

1:50:00.820 --> 1:50:04.220
 And they went, I kid you not, onto my social media account,

1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:07.780
 found a picture I'd taken about how blue the sky was one day.

1:50:08.740 --> 1:50:11.460
 They reverse image search the tree line,

1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:15.180
 found the tree line on Google image search somehow

1:50:15.180 --> 1:50:16.060
 with a reverse image search,

1:50:16.060 --> 1:50:20.460
 found an old listing that some broker had listed

1:50:20.460 --> 1:50:22.940
 on their website of my house,

1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:25.980
 and then posted my home address, the value of my home,

1:50:25.980 --> 1:50:30.980
 and doxxed me on Twitter.

1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:33.500
 And I'm like, what is going on here?

1:50:33.500 --> 1:50:36.860
 So I call the person and I look them up

1:50:36.860 --> 1:50:40.100
 and they work in private equity in Boston.

1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:42.620
 And I look and I'm like, this person works in Boston.

1:50:42.620 --> 1:50:44.340
 This is July 4th week.

1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:47.300
 So, and when I look at the person's LinkedIn,

1:50:47.300 --> 1:50:49.340
 we have seven people in common.

1:50:49.340 --> 1:50:51.380
 So going back to the AR conversation real quick,

1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:53.700
 I'm like, okay, this person literally just doxxed me.

1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:54.820
 I asked them to take it down.

1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:57.180
 They told me they won't take it down.

1:50:57.180 --> 1:50:58.220
 And then I look at it.

1:50:58.220 --> 1:51:01.340
 So then I DM him back on Instagram, on Twitter.

1:51:01.340 --> 1:51:04.380
 And I said, by the way, your boss, Susan,

1:51:04.380 --> 1:51:06.940
 and I know seven people in common.

1:51:06.940 --> 1:51:08.100
 And these are the seven people.

1:51:08.100 --> 1:51:09.700
 Here's a screenshot.

1:51:09.700 --> 1:51:12.420
 What is she going to think when I call her on Monday

1:51:12.420 --> 1:51:14.420
 and you've doxxed me?

1:51:14.420 --> 1:51:15.740
 Here's my phone number if you'd like to talk.

1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:17.220
 He calls me.

1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:18.420
 I said, what's going on?

1:51:18.420 --> 1:51:19.260
 Why would you do this?

1:51:19.260 --> 1:51:20.580
 He's like, well, I really pissed off

1:51:20.580 --> 1:51:21.700
 about what you said about this person.

1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:23.540
 I was like, you understand I've had like two

1:51:23.540 --> 1:51:25.820
 or three stalkers and anybody who's a high profile

1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:27.820
 like I am or medium profile,

1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.300
 you're going to have weird things happen.

1:51:29.300 --> 1:51:30.460
 You literally put my home address.

1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:32.220
 You put my family at risk.

1:51:32.220 --> 1:51:34.620
 What if I put your home address on my,

1:51:34.620 --> 1:51:37.100
 I have 400,000 followers or 300,000 followers.

1:51:37.100 --> 1:51:38.900
 You have like 300.

1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:40.780
 What if I post your address?

1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:42.140
 He said, well, I wish you wouldn't do that.

1:51:42.140 --> 1:51:43.060
 I was like, well, I asked you kindly

1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:44.660
 to take my address down.

1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:46.340
 And I said, are you married?

1:51:47.700 --> 1:51:48.860
 I said, how old are you?

1:51:48.860 --> 1:51:49.940
 Are you like 25 or something?

1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:51.660
 He's like, no, I'm 42.

1:51:51.660 --> 1:51:53.060
 I was like, you're 42 years old.

1:51:53.060 --> 1:51:53.900
 I was like, are you married?

1:51:53.900 --> 1:51:54.740
 Do you have kids?

1:51:54.740 --> 1:51:56.060
 He's like, yeah, I just had a baby like six months ago.

1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:57.940
 I'm like, you're home with your wife.

1:51:57.940 --> 1:51:59.420
 It's July 4th weekend.

1:51:59.420 --> 1:52:02.940
 You're doxxing Jason Calagans because you're upset at me

1:52:02.940 --> 1:52:05.620
 because I said something about a New York Times writer.

1:52:05.620 --> 1:52:07.940
 He's like, yeah, this is the biggest mistake of my life.

1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:11.100
 I said, I tell you what, let's forget it ever happened.

1:52:11.980 --> 1:52:13.700
 And he wrote me back and he said,

1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:16.620
 I just wanted to thank you for how you handled it.

1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:19.060
 My wife said I'm a complete fucking moron.

1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:22.380
 And he literally sent me an email.

1:52:22.380 --> 1:52:24.060
 My wife says I'm a complete fucking moron.

1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:26.460
 And I'm really sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:27.300
 And I wrote her back.

1:52:27.300 --> 1:52:28.620
 I said, I wrote her back and I said,

1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:30.420
 my wife says the same thing to me all the time.

1:52:30.420 --> 1:52:31.780
 I said, welcome to the club.

1:52:31.780 --> 1:52:32.740
 It's totally fine.

1:52:32.740 --> 1:52:36.380
 But intent, nuance, it matters, right?

1:52:36.380 --> 1:52:37.820
 And the person could be having a bad day

1:52:37.820 --> 1:52:39.300
 and they do something stupid they regret.

1:52:39.300 --> 1:52:41.260
 And what am I gonna do, cancel the guy?

1:52:41.260 --> 1:52:43.460
 Or if I had called his boss,

1:52:43.460 --> 1:52:45.220
 he would have been fired immediately.

1:52:45.220 --> 1:52:47.700
 And then I got to live with this guy got fired

1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:49.820
 and he's got a kid.

1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:51.420
 And what is this personal destruction?

1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:52.860
 Why are we doing this to each other?

1:52:52.860 --> 1:52:54.660
 Life's hard enough.

1:52:54.660 --> 1:52:55.900
 Life's hard, right?

1:52:55.900 --> 1:52:57.620
 Like just getting through the day is hard.

1:52:57.620 --> 1:53:00.380
 Yeah, and that little bit of empathy,

1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:02.580
 thinking about the intent of the person

1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:04.620
 allows you to then sort of deescalate

1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:05.740
 this kind of conversation

1:53:05.740 --> 1:53:08.220
 that social media wants to escalate.

1:53:08.220 --> 1:53:10.380
 Yes, back to what we were saying.

1:53:10.380 --> 1:53:13.860
 If this, in my younger years,

1:53:13.860 --> 1:53:16.060
 I would have retweeted the guy's home address

1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:17.940
 and my address and would have called his boss

1:53:17.940 --> 1:53:19.220
 and tried to get him fired or whatever.

1:53:19.220 --> 1:53:21.140
 And it's like, now I'm just like,

1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:23.540
 why are we attacking each other?

1:53:23.540 --> 1:53:24.500
 Life is so hard.

1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:25.540
 I mean, this is what the pandemic,

1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:27.580
 I think we should make everybody realize is like,

1:53:27.580 --> 1:53:29.780
 look at how hard it is.

1:53:29.780 --> 1:53:30.620
 Life is hard.

1:53:30.620 --> 1:53:32.540
 And then just think about all the people suffering right now

1:53:32.540 --> 1:53:34.820
 who are at home, the single mom or dad

1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:38.580
 with two or three kids at home in public school.

1:53:38.580 --> 1:53:40.180
 Maybe they've been laid off

1:53:40.180 --> 1:53:41.820
 and their kids aren't learning

1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:44.100
 and they're in a tiny apartment.

1:53:44.100 --> 1:53:46.700
 I mean, this has been brutal for a lot of people.

1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:48.500
 Not to mention people losing loved ones

1:53:48.500 --> 1:53:49.940
 or maybe some people got Corona

1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:52.220
 and now their lungs are still not right.

1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:53.500
 Can I ask you about love?

1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:54.340
 Oh, sure.

1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:57.100
 I'm feeling it, you know,

1:53:57.100 --> 1:53:58.900
 like we're an hour or two here, Lex.

1:53:58.900 --> 1:53:59.740
 Yeah, you're feeling it.

1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:01.540
 Feeling like we could become besties.

1:54:01.540 --> 1:54:02.380
 We're getting it.

1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:05.020
 I feel like we got a bromance going here, Lex.

1:54:05.020 --> 1:54:05.860
 I feel it too.

1:54:05.860 --> 1:54:07.260
 I don't know if it's Eric Weinstein level,

1:54:07.260 --> 1:54:09.820
 but I feel like it's close.

1:54:09.820 --> 1:54:11.380
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love.

1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:16.380
 But we talked about those music to my ears,

1:54:16.380 --> 1:54:21.380
 your whole rant on the Olympic nature of a startup.

1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:25.180
 Is there a role,

1:54:25.180 --> 1:54:29.020
 like what role does love, family, friendship

1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:34.020
 play in that brutal pursuit of excellence

1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:37.020
 that is building a startup, building a company

1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:40.500
 or creating anything new in this world?

1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:44.340
 Such a great question and totally unprepared for it.

1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:46.860
 Because nobody would ever ask me about that.

1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:49.420
 So I think it's why you've got quite a following

1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:52.900
 on your podcast is that you're able to ask these questions.

1:54:52.900 --> 1:54:56.700
 And I can tell one story because, you know,

1:54:56.700 --> 1:54:57.660
 I don't talk about,

1:54:57.660 --> 1:55:00.700
 I try not to talk about relationship with Elon that often

1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:03.620
 because, you know, he's so famous now.

1:55:03.620 --> 1:55:06.460
 I mean, when we met, I used to go out to parties with him

1:55:06.460 --> 1:55:07.820
 and people were like, oh my God, you're Jason Calacas.

1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:08.660
 I was like, yeah.

1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:09.500
 And like, who's your friend?

1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:10.340
 I'm like, that's my friend, Elon.

1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:11.900
 And they'd be like, what, he's doing rocket ships?

1:55:11.900 --> 1:55:13.580
 But he's told this story publicly.

1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:14.420
 So I can tell it,

1:55:14.420 --> 1:55:15.620
 and I would never talk about anything

1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:17.140
 that he hasn't already talked about publicly,

1:55:17.140 --> 1:55:18.500
 especially since he's so high profile,

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:19.980
 but it was pretty funny moment.

1:55:21.940 --> 1:55:23.060
 There was a moment in time

1:55:23.060 --> 1:55:24.380
 when Tesla almost went out of business

1:55:24.380 --> 1:55:26.980
 and you've probably heard the story many times,

1:55:26.980 --> 1:55:28.740
 but it was during the financial crisis

1:55:28.740 --> 1:55:32.220
 and they were running out of money.

1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:36.780
 And they said, you know, let's go get a steak.

1:55:36.780 --> 1:55:38.420
 And we're in LA and we drove to BOA

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.340
 and I had my orange Tesla Roadster

1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:43.700
 and he had his P1 or P2, like the red one

1:55:43.700 --> 1:55:45.820
 that I think is in space now.

1:55:45.820 --> 1:55:48.620
 And we drove to the valet and we had a steak together

1:55:48.620 --> 1:55:49.820
 and we're sitting there.

1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:51.420
 And I said, you know, I read the story

1:55:51.420 --> 1:55:53.300
 and Gawker or whatever, you know,

1:55:53.300 --> 1:55:54.780
 and New York Times here,

1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:58.420
 you only got like five weeks of money left in Tesla.

1:55:58.420 --> 1:55:59.260
 He goes, it's not true.

1:55:59.260 --> 1:56:01.020
 I was like, oh, thank God.

1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:02.100
 He goes, we have two weeks.

1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:04.820
 I was like, oh God.

1:56:04.820 --> 1:56:06.460
 I was like, well, what's going on

1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:07.780
 with the rocket ship company?

1:56:07.780 --> 1:56:12.100
 You know, like, you know, I know you did the one last month

1:56:12.100 --> 1:56:13.340
 and don't you have one coming up?

1:56:13.340 --> 1:56:14.820
 He's like, yeah, we've got the third one coming up.

1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:16.380
 I was like, well, how's that going?

1:56:16.380 --> 1:56:17.940
 I said, well, we blow that one up.

1:56:17.940 --> 1:56:19.620
 There's no more SpaceX.

1:56:19.620 --> 1:56:22.340
 I was like, so two weeks of money left in Tesla

1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:24.260
 and SpaceX, you blew up the first two rockets,

1:56:24.260 --> 1:56:25.700
 you blow up the third SpaceX, it's over.

1:56:25.700 --> 1:56:26.620
 He's like, yeah.

1:56:26.620 --> 1:56:29.460
 I was like, I can loan you a couple million dollars.

1:56:29.460 --> 1:56:31.580
 I don't have like a ton.

1:56:31.580 --> 1:56:32.420
 He's like, it's okay.

1:56:32.420 --> 1:56:35.740
 Our friend, beep, has loaned me some money.

1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:37.740
 And Elon's been super public about this.

1:56:37.740 --> 1:56:39.380
 I would never tell the story unless he hadn't been,

1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:42.300
 but he was talking, he never said who it was,

1:56:42.300 --> 1:56:45.100
 but somebody had loaned him money to keep him afloat.

1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:47.180
 He was functionally bankrupt.

1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:48.620
 I mean, he had the equity in the companies,

1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:50.460
 but the equity was quickly becoming worth zero

1:56:50.460 --> 1:56:51.460
 and the financial crisis.

1:56:51.460 --> 1:56:54.500
 And he's figuring out if he's going to go on vacation

1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:55.540
 for Christmas or not.

1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:58.940
 And he's on the phone trying to, you know,

1:56:58.940 --> 1:57:01.420
 save both companies.

1:57:01.420 --> 1:57:04.100
 And I said, certainly there must be some good news.

1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:07.220
 And he takes out his Blackberry to date this conversation.

1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:08.260
 I don't know iPhones.

1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:10.780
 Takes out his Blackberry and he starts swiping.

1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:12.860
 And he says, don't tell anybody.

1:57:12.860 --> 1:57:14.060
 This is what I'm building.

1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:15.900
 And he shows me the Model S.

1:57:17.580 --> 1:57:19.860
 And nobody knew that he was working on the Model S.

1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:22.100
 We knew he was doing the roadster

1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:24.220
 and he was trying to save the company.

1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:26.740
 And I looked at it and I was like, that's gorgeous.

1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:29.260
 It was the clay models.

1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:30.740
 So it was a full size clay model.

1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:33.100
 So there's human beings standing around a clay version

1:57:33.100 --> 1:57:34.380
 of this tiny little Blackberry picture.

1:57:34.380 --> 1:57:35.900
 I'm scrolling through on the,

1:57:35.900 --> 1:57:38.620
 remember that little pad or the ball on the Blackberry.

1:57:38.620 --> 1:57:39.460
 I'm scrolling through it.

1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:41.460
 I'm like, this is fucking great.

1:57:41.460 --> 1:57:42.980
 And I just said to him, it's like,

1:57:43.980 --> 1:57:44.820
 what's the range going to be?

1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:46.500
 He says, well, I think we get 250 miles.

1:57:46.500 --> 1:57:48.020
 I was like, 250 miles?

1:57:48.020 --> 1:57:49.860
 He's like, yeah, I think it'd be the safest car ever.

1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:51.220
 I said, what is it going to cost?

1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:55.820
 He says, I think this could cost eventually 50, $60,000.

1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:57.660
 I said, Elon, if you make that car,

1:57:57.660 --> 1:58:00.220
 you'll change the goddamn world.

1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:03.140
 You have to, this company must survive

1:58:03.140 --> 1:58:07.860
 because the roadsters for like 2000 people in United States,

1:58:07.860 --> 1:58:11.020
 this car is for every person in the United States.

1:58:11.020 --> 1:58:12.860
 Every single person in the United States

1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:15.100
 will want this car if it's $50,000.

1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:18.260
 And maybe some of the people who have 20 or 30,000 dollars

1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:20.660
 won't be able to afford it, but they'll all want it.

1:58:20.660 --> 1:58:21.900
 It's gorgeous.

1:58:21.900 --> 1:58:22.740
 And he said, you really think so?

1:58:22.740 --> 1:58:23.980
 I said, yeah.

1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:26.020
 So I got home and I talked to my wife, Jade,

1:58:26.020 --> 1:58:27.700
 and I said, do you have the checkbook?

1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:29.260
 She does all the finances and stuff like that,

1:58:29.260 --> 1:58:30.660
 pays the bills and whatever.

1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:33.700
 And I said, don't tell anybody,

1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:35.140
 Elon's making this great car.

1:58:35.140 --> 1:58:38.020
 And I wrote two checks for $50,000.

1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:40.020
 And I just took out this paper and I wrote,

1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:45.020
 E, comma, love the new car, I'll take two.

1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:48.260
 And I signed it.

1:58:48.260 --> 1:58:51.140
 I kissed the two $50,000 checks, put them in the envelope,

1:58:51.140 --> 1:58:53.940
 and I FedExed it to him for Monday delivery.

1:58:53.940 --> 1:58:58.780
 And I said to Jade, that $100,000 is going to be gone

1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:00.660
 in 48 hours because it will pay for one or two days

1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:02.100
 of payroll on Tesla.

1:59:02.100 --> 1:59:04.140
 So we just added like, instead of two weeks of runway,

1:59:04.140 --> 1:59:05.780
 he's got 12 days.

1:59:06.700 --> 1:59:10.660
 And the checks don't cash, but then I read a story

1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:12.620
 that he's closed the money, saved the company

1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:14.620
 in like the next week or two.

1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:19.180
 And a couple of months later, the checks get cashed.

1:59:19.180 --> 1:59:20.860
 And I'm like, okay.

1:59:20.860 --> 1:59:22.780
 Three years later, I get an email,

1:59:22.780 --> 1:59:25.060
 your reservation number, it's from Tesla,

1:59:25.060 --> 1:59:29.620
 your reservation number is 0000001.

1:59:29.620 --> 1:59:31.540
 And then five seconds later,

1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:35.060
 your reservation number is 000073.

1:59:35.060 --> 1:59:36.660
 And I forwarded the number one to Elon,

1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:40.580
 I said, you know, I can't take number one,

1:59:40.580 --> 1:59:43.780
 a signature number one, I can't take that, that's yours.

1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:45.260
 And he's like, oh, I got five of them.

1:59:45.260 --> 1:59:48.220
 And besides, you're the first person who ordered it.

1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:49.540
 And I was the first person who had seen it.

1:59:49.540 --> 1:59:51.020
 You're gonna get me to be teary eyed.

1:59:51.020 --> 1:59:51.860
 I mean, that's beautiful.

1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:52.700
 No, it was a very...

1:59:52.700 --> 1:59:53.540
 That's a beautiful moment.

1:59:53.540 --> 1:59:55.100
 It was an incredible moment for both of us.

1:59:55.100 --> 1:59:57.140
 And we talk about it sometimes, you know,

1:59:57.140 --> 1:59:58.180
 those moments in time.

1:59:58.180 --> 1:59:59.580
 And to your point about love, Elon...

1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:01.260
 That's like the darkest moment,

2:00:01.260 --> 2:00:03.660
 one of the darkest moments in his life probably.

2:00:03.660 --> 2:00:04.900
 I think it was, I can tell you,

2:00:04.900 --> 2:00:07.180
 it was the darkest period of his life for sure.

2:00:07.180 --> 2:00:09.820
 And he's been very public about how dark that was.

2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:12.540
 And I think, you know, this is why I have great sympathy

2:00:12.540 --> 2:00:13.900
 for the entrepreneurs of the world,

2:00:13.900 --> 2:00:15.500
 like the suffering and the pain.

2:00:15.500 --> 2:00:17.540
 And when he talks about the suffering and the pain

2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:18.820
 that all of these founders have felt,

2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:20.420
 and then we were throwing rocks at them

2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:22.540
 or criticizing them as they try to change the world

2:00:22.540 --> 2:00:24.580
 and save humanity, and in Tesla's case,

2:00:24.580 --> 2:00:26.580
 I mean, they weren't, you know,

2:00:26.580 --> 2:00:28.540
 they weren't like delivering pizza.

2:00:28.540 --> 2:00:31.420
 I mean, they were trying to get us off of fossil fuels.

2:00:31.420 --> 2:00:33.180
 Like this was a big, heady mission

2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:36.820
 to literally save the environment, the planet, humanity.

2:00:36.820 --> 2:00:40.220
 And the way they shorted that stock and they attacked him,

2:00:40.220 --> 2:00:44.460
 it was always perplexing to me why any human being

2:00:44.460 --> 2:00:47.380
 who is standing on God's green earth

2:00:47.380 --> 2:00:50.220
 would want to throw rocks at the guy

2:00:50.220 --> 2:00:53.940
 who is trying to stem the dam of global warming

2:00:53.940 --> 2:00:56.660
 that is about to engulf all of us.

2:00:56.660 --> 2:01:00.100
 How dare they throw rocks at that guy?

2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:02.140
 There's so many people you could throw rocks at.

2:01:02.140 --> 2:01:05.180
 There's somebody who's making the Juul vaporizer,

2:01:05.180 --> 2:01:07.900
 throw rocks at that scumbag, no offense.

2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:09.780
 But like whoever's making the Juul things

2:01:09.780 --> 2:01:12.300
 and is, you know, selling pina colada flavor

2:01:12.300 --> 2:01:15.140
 to 12 year olds, like throw rocks at them.

2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:18.100
 Somebody is doing something, you know, abhorrent,

2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:21.540
 but not E, I mean, and yeah.

2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:25.380
 Anyway, that car is, you know, up the road here,

2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:29.740
 sitting under a cover with 20,000 miles on it in my garage.

2:01:29.740 --> 2:01:32.660
 And then the Roadster number 16 is in the garage next to it.

2:01:32.660 --> 2:01:34.500
 And every day I walk by the two of them

2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:35.940
 and I get a warm feeling in my heart

2:01:35.940 --> 2:01:37.900
 because I know he did it.

2:01:37.900 --> 2:01:42.900
 Against all odds, against all odds, he pulled it off.

2:01:43.100 --> 2:01:47.620
 And it was that moment, that month in that 2000,

2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:49.540
 I think it was probably December, January,

2:01:49.540 --> 2:01:51.980
 December of 2008, I think.

2:01:51.980 --> 2:01:52.980
 You know, it's just 12 years ago

2:01:52.980 --> 2:01:55.380
 when you think about 13 years ago, it was dark.

2:01:55.380 --> 2:01:56.340
 I mean, it was dark.

2:01:56.340 --> 2:01:58.740
 And they almost had the same thing happen,

2:01:58.740 --> 2:02:00.100
 you know, in the Model 3 production

2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:02.340
 in June of two years, three years ago.

2:02:02.340 --> 2:02:05.340
 And I remember him just trying to get the Model 3

2:02:05.340 --> 2:02:07.700
 out the door and the company almost crashed then.

2:02:07.700 --> 2:02:09.020
 Most of these companies have, you know,

2:02:09.020 --> 2:02:10.580
 these kinds of moments.

2:02:10.580 --> 2:02:14.860
 And I think friendship is you get what you give,

2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:16.620
 you get what you give.

2:02:16.620 --> 2:02:18.900
 And if you are there for people,

2:02:18.900 --> 2:02:21.340
 you're gonna feel so good about having done that.

2:02:22.300 --> 2:02:27.300
 And then the reciprocation effect,

2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:29.420
 which you'd probably know very well,

2:02:29.420 --> 2:02:33.260
 is so great in the world that anytime you're kind to people,

2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:34.540
 you build this incredible bond.

2:02:34.540 --> 2:02:37.100
 And then what are we at the end of the day, Lex,

2:02:37.100 --> 2:02:41.260
 besides a series of memories with the people we love?

2:02:41.260 --> 2:02:42.300
 That's all it is.

2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:45.620
 It's just a series of memories and moments.

2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:47.460
 It's just moments.

2:02:47.460 --> 2:02:48.780
 You ever see Blade Runner?

2:02:48.780 --> 2:02:49.700
 Yes, of course.

2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:52.140
 Do you remember what Rucker Harris says at the end,

2:02:52.140 --> 2:02:55.060
 all of these memories gone, like tears in the rain?

2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:56.940
 I mean, that's our existence.

2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:59.420
 It just all goes away at some point.

2:02:59.420 --> 2:03:01.100
 It's just these drops of rain.

2:03:01.100 --> 2:03:02.420
 Each of those memories,

2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:05.300
 just like one snowflake or one drop of rain,

2:03:05.300 --> 2:03:08.340
 and they're all lost at some point, but they're here now.

2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:10.500
 And that's why we have to be there for each other.

2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:12.740
 That's why I feel like what I do

2:03:12.740 --> 2:03:14.820
 is so important in this world.

2:03:14.820 --> 2:03:16.300
 And I get such great meaning out of it.

2:03:16.300 --> 2:03:19.020
 Just being a friend, just having these conversations.

2:03:19.020 --> 2:03:21.340
 What you're doing on your podcast,

2:03:21.340 --> 2:03:23.340
 just talking to intelligent people

2:03:23.340 --> 2:03:26.380
 and spreading the word and the gospel

2:03:26.380 --> 2:03:28.620
 of what they're saying and amplifying it,

2:03:28.620 --> 2:03:29.940
 you're inspiring so many people.

2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:31.780
 Every podcast, you get 500,000 people,

2:03:31.780 --> 2:03:33.740
 a million people watch these videos.

2:03:33.740 --> 2:03:35.740
 And there's some kid in Sri Lanka

2:03:35.740 --> 2:03:37.380
 or some little girl in Afghanistan

2:03:37.380 --> 2:03:39.860
 who's gonna stumble upon this on YouTube,

2:03:39.860 --> 2:03:42.860
 and they're gonna change the world in the next century.

2:03:42.860 --> 2:03:44.860
 Because it's not just about America.

2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:48.300
 Our story's almost over, right?

2:03:48.300 --> 2:03:50.060
 We were the story of the last two or 300 years.

2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:51.140
 I hope it keeps going.

2:03:51.140 --> 2:03:52.700
 But there's all these other places in the world,

2:03:52.700 --> 2:03:54.980
 Sao Paulo and Africa,

2:03:54.980 --> 2:03:59.260
 where people now have access to these videos.

2:03:59.260 --> 2:04:00.820
 And somebody will hear this video and go,

2:04:00.820 --> 2:04:02.060
 Elon did it.

2:04:02.060 --> 2:04:03.420
 Oh, and that guy Jason was his friend.

2:04:03.420 --> 2:04:06.580
 And, oh, and Lex does those interviews with him.

2:04:06.580 --> 2:04:07.900
 Oh yeah, I could do it too.

2:04:07.900 --> 2:04:10.180
 Your little magical moment of love

2:04:10.180 --> 2:04:12.380
 amidst the suffering with Elon

2:04:12.380 --> 2:04:14.260
 because you've talked about it,

2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:15.620
 it'll have these ripple effects.

2:04:15.620 --> 2:04:18.420
 It's fascinating to think about in decades to come.

2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:20.540
 And new entrepreneurs being born,

2:04:20.540 --> 2:04:23.380
 new, more love being put out there,

2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:26.580
 and more support through these rough times

2:04:26.580 --> 2:04:29.460
 when people are trying to create new things.

2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:31.980
 I mean, that's a beautiful thing, that's a beautiful,

2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:35.420
 I'm glad you think of friendship in this way.

2:04:35.420 --> 2:04:39.420
 I'm deeply grateful that you're loyal.

2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:40.260
 Every time you invest.

2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:41.700
 In the way you are.

2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:42.900
 Here's the thing,

2:04:42.900 --> 2:04:45.700
 it costs you nothing to make this investment either.

2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:49.940
 The amount of time it takes to be bitter or angry,

2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:53.580
 sitting at home, to be disappointed,

2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:55.740
 you could just channel that same amount of energy

2:04:55.740 --> 2:04:59.660
 into being loyal, loving, kind, and there for people.

2:04:59.660 --> 2:05:02.260
 It just only takes the intention, right?

2:05:02.260 --> 2:05:05.060
 The water is gonna, those emotions are gonna flow, right?

2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:06.060
 Like Sam would always tell me

2:05:06.060 --> 2:05:09.460
 when I was struggling in my life and I talked to him,

2:05:09.460 --> 2:05:10.300
 he'd say, you know, Jason,

2:05:10.300 --> 2:05:12.660
 your brain is spewing all these ideas.

2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:15.180
 Imagine you're standing, sitting by a river,

2:05:15.180 --> 2:05:17.180
 and the river is all your ideas.

2:05:17.180 --> 2:05:18.980
 You are not a slave to any one of these ideas.

2:05:18.980 --> 2:05:20.260
 They're just whipping by

2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:22.340
 like each of those little waves in the river.

2:05:22.340 --> 2:05:23.980
 You can pick one of those ideas out

2:05:23.980 --> 2:05:25.660
 and look at it and examine it,

2:05:25.660 --> 2:05:26.740
 and either keep it,

2:05:26.740 --> 2:05:28.860
 or throw it back in the river and let it go.

2:05:28.860 --> 2:05:31.260
 And I was like, wow, Sam, that was like,

2:05:31.260 --> 2:05:32.820
 of my entire friendship with Sam Harris,

2:05:32.820 --> 2:05:34.660
 that was like the one moment where I was just like,

2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:36.940
 oh my God, all my life,

2:05:36.940 --> 2:05:39.660
 I've wondered about all these thoughts in my head,

2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:43.420
 insecurities, you know, imposter syndrome.

2:05:43.420 --> 2:05:46.100
 Like I didn't go to MIT, you know,

2:05:46.100 --> 2:05:48.700
 I'm not the smartest guy,

2:05:48.700 --> 2:05:52.660
 but somehow I made a career writing little 50K checks

2:05:52.660 --> 2:05:54.140
 and now, you know, $3 million checks,

2:05:54.140 --> 2:05:55.420
 but whatever, you know, little checks

2:05:55.420 --> 2:05:57.540
 and being a journalist and doing this little podcast,

2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:59.740
 and it's ended up to something.

2:05:59.740 --> 2:06:01.660
 And I kind of, I'm proud of it.

2:06:01.660 --> 2:06:04.260
 I'm 50 and I'm kind of proud of what I did.

2:06:04.260 --> 2:06:06.140
 And I wake up every morning after I retired,

2:06:06.140 --> 2:06:09.340
 I say, I kind of like what I do.

2:06:09.340 --> 2:06:10.860
 I kind of like having the conversation

2:06:10.860 --> 2:06:13.580
 and writing the check and then being on somebody's team.

2:06:13.580 --> 2:06:16.220
 And I got offered to be in these giant mega funds

2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:18.180
 and they said, Jason, you're in it,

2:06:18.180 --> 2:06:20.580
 you invest in 60 companies a year,

2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:22.100
 you know, 500K at a time,

2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:25.180
 you put $30 million a year to work, come work with us,

2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:26.820
 write one $50 million check

2:06:27.740 --> 2:06:32.220
 and then you can go to Aspen and Cabo and Coachella

2:06:32.220 --> 2:06:33.060
 and not work.

2:06:34.420 --> 2:06:35.900
 But why are you doing all this work?

2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:38.380
 It's like, well, the $50 million check

2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:40.300
 is like, it's like a formality.

2:06:40.300 --> 2:06:41.380
 It's just like being an ATM,

2:06:41.380 --> 2:06:43.860
 like the companies are already huge by that time.

2:06:43.860 --> 2:06:46.540
 I really want to meet the two people with the idea.

2:06:46.540 --> 2:06:48.900
 I want to meet them in year one.

2:06:48.900 --> 2:06:51.020
 I want to meet them on day zero.

2:06:51.020 --> 2:06:52.500
 I want to be the guy who wrote the first,

2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:53.780
 second or third check.

2:06:53.780 --> 2:06:57.020
 I want a guy who wrote the 3000th check, the last check.

2:06:57.020 --> 2:06:58.020
 It's fucking boring.

2:06:58.020 --> 2:07:00.020
 And make that basic human connection

2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:03.620
 and also be with them through the rough times,

2:07:03.620 --> 2:07:05.420
 be with them with that first,

2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:07.220
 I mean, the first early successes,

2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:08.580
 I mean, that's a beautiful.

2:07:08.580 --> 2:07:09.420
 So great.

2:07:09.420 --> 2:07:13.980
 When a founder and that team get product market fit

2:07:13.980 --> 2:07:16.420
 and you just know it's going to work,

2:07:16.420 --> 2:07:18.380
 oh man, Lex, it's,

2:07:18.380 --> 2:07:21.580
 when Comm would email me and they'd say,

2:07:21.580 --> 2:07:24.100
 we added, you know, the company's been growing

2:07:24.100 --> 2:07:25.740
 and we're not going to go out of business,

2:07:25.740 --> 2:07:27.260
 but we added some sleep stuff

2:07:27.260 --> 2:07:29.780
 and then we added this other function

2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:33.820
 and we have a streak now and we grew 10X

2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:36.860
 in the last, you know, three months.

2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:38.300
 And we're good.

2:07:38.300 --> 2:07:40.220
 You know, I was like, ah, that's nice.

2:07:40.220 --> 2:07:41.060
 It's real nice.

2:07:41.060 --> 2:07:42.900
 It's like, it's a nice feeling when you,

2:07:42.900 --> 2:07:44.140
 well, because so many of them die.

2:07:44.140 --> 2:07:45.940
 We talked about that J curve early.

2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:47.260
 Imagine it's like,

2:07:49.220 --> 2:07:51.700
 it's like all these baby turtles going out to the ocean

2:07:51.700 --> 2:07:53.620
 and the seagulls are ripping them to shreds

2:07:53.620 --> 2:07:56.220
 and then the sharks are eating them.

2:07:56.220 --> 2:07:58.740
 But then like a couple of the turtles make it

2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:02.460
 and they become wise old 100 year old turtles, you know?

2:08:02.460 --> 2:08:06.100
 And you're like, yep, I remember when you catched

2:08:06.100 --> 2:08:08.260
 and like all of your brothers and sisters

2:08:08.260 --> 2:08:09.740
 were ripped to shreds by the seagulls

2:08:09.740 --> 2:08:11.460
 and you made it into the water.

2:08:11.460 --> 2:08:13.780
 And then you made it out to the deep water.

2:08:13.780 --> 2:08:14.620
 Pretty great feeling.

2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:17.220
 I think there's no better way to end it.

2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:18.180
 There it is.

2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:20.260
 The talk of the cruelty of life,

2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:22.180
 that suffering that is life

2:08:22.180 --> 2:08:24.060
 and the love amidst the suffering.

2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:26.820
 Jason, I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

2:08:26.820 --> 2:08:30.620
 You're one of the most special people in Silicon Valley.

2:08:30.620 --> 2:08:31.460
 Thanks, Lex.

2:08:31.460 --> 2:08:34.740
 And maybe you'll also call me in one of the rough times.

2:08:34.740 --> 2:08:36.220
 I'm sure there'll be many.

2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:37.940
 There will be, yeah.

2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:41.180
 There's one expression, nobody gets there alone.

2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.540
 Nobody gets there alone.

2:08:42.540 --> 2:08:45.100
 And anybody who thinks that they got there alone

2:08:45.100 --> 2:08:47.060
 is delusional and kidding themselves.

2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:48.980
 And they will at some point wake up and realize,

2:08:48.980 --> 2:08:52.580
 oh shit, there were a lot of people helped me get here.

2:08:52.580 --> 2:08:54.500
 I need to write a couple of gratitude letters.

2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:55.820
 I got a gratitude letter the other day

2:08:55.820 --> 2:08:57.900
 from a friend of mine who I helped.

2:08:57.900 --> 2:08:59.460
 And I was one of the,

2:08:59.460 --> 2:09:02.100
 you know about these gratitude letters people are writing?

2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:07.100
 It turns out Martin Seligman in, was it Authentic Happiness?

2:09:07.940 --> 2:09:10.820
 Anyway, the guy who really studied happiness and joy,

2:09:10.820 --> 2:09:15.100
 turns out one of the greatest amplifiers of joy in your life

2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:17.740
 is to thank somebody for doing something for you.

2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:22.060
 And somebody who I had helped just wrote me a letter

2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:22.980
 and I got in Christmas

2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:24.460
 and I had the stack of Christmas cards

2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:25.580
 and I hadn't opened them.

2:09:25.580 --> 2:09:27.660
 And it's the second week of January

2:09:27.660 --> 2:09:29.980
 and I was just getting to like the last stack

2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:32.660
 and I open it up and I almost missed it.

2:09:32.660 --> 2:09:33.900
 It's incredibly heartwarming letter

2:09:33.900 --> 2:09:37.220
 about how meaningful like certain things I had done

2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:38.900
 to help along the way

2:09:38.900 --> 2:09:41.700
 and how he'd always appreciated my counsel.

2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:46.460
 And I was just like, well, this happened 25 years ago

2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:48.420
 and you wrote this letter now.

2:09:48.420 --> 2:09:50.300
 And it just hit me like a ton of bricks.

2:09:50.300 --> 2:09:53.460
 I was just like, wow, you know, if you're hearing this,

2:09:53.460 --> 2:09:54.660
 there's probably 10 people

2:09:54.660 --> 2:09:58.100
 who are really instrumental in your lives, in your lives.

2:09:58.100 --> 2:10:00.460
 Go ahead and call them on the phone,

2:10:00.460 --> 2:10:02.260
 write them an email or even better,

2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:05.420
 just write a letter and send it to them

2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:07.020
 and just tell them you're thankful.

2:10:07.020 --> 2:10:08.540
 And let me tell you something,

2:10:08.540 --> 2:10:12.340
 the amplification of joy in your life will go a hundred X,

2:10:12.340 --> 2:10:15.420
 a hundred X when you tell somebody you love them

2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:17.020
 and that you really appreciate them

2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:18.580
 and that what they did for you was magical.

2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:21.420
 So just, and you can look it up, gratitude.

2:10:21.420 --> 2:10:23.900
 Gratitude is like one of these incredible forces.

2:10:23.900 --> 2:10:24.740
 Amen.

2:10:24.740 --> 2:10:25.940
 I'm grateful for being on the pod.

2:10:25.940 --> 2:10:29.860
 I'm grateful you wasted all this time with me.

2:10:29.860 --> 2:10:56.860
 I love it.

2:10:59.860 --> 2:11:09.460
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
