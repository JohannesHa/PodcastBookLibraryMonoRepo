00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with Matthew Johnson,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.600
 a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science

00:05.600 --> 00:08.920
 at John Hopkins, and is one of the top scientists

00:08.920 --> 00:13.360
 in the world conducting seminal research on psychedelics.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.760
 This was one of the most eye opening

00:15.760 --> 00:19.880
 and fascinating conversations I've ever had on this podcast.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.540
 I'm sure I'll talk with Matt many more times.

00:22.540 --> 00:25.120
 Quick mention of a sponsor followed by some thoughts

00:25.120 --> 00:26.640
 related to the episode.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.040
 Thank you to a new sponsor, Brave,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.240
 a fast browser that feels like Chrome

00:32.240 --> 00:35.400
 but has more privacy preserving features.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.020
 Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum and mints

00:39.020 --> 00:42.640
 that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.760
 Four Sigmatic, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee,

00:46.760 --> 00:50.760
 I'm just now realizing how ironic the set of sponsors are.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.720
 And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.920

01:00.220 --> 01:02.620
 As a side note, let me say that psychedelics

01:02.620 --> 01:05.720
 is an area of study that is fascinating to me

01:05.720 --> 01:08.200
 in that it gives hints that much of the magic

01:08.200 --> 01:10.640
 of our experience arises from just a few

01:10.640 --> 01:12.480
 chemical interactions in the brain

01:12.480 --> 01:16.080
 and that the nature of that experience can be expanded

01:16.080 --> 01:19.640
 through the tools of biology, chemistry, physics,

01:19.640 --> 01:23.320
 neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.160
 The fact that a world class scientist and researcher

01:26.160 --> 01:28.800
 like Matt can apply rigor to our study

01:28.800 --> 01:31.720
 of this mysterious and fascinating topic

01:31.720 --> 01:34.200
 is exciting to me beyond words.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.440
 As is the case with any of my colleagues

01:36.440 --> 01:38.880
 who dare to venture out into the darkness

01:38.880 --> 01:41.680
 of all that is unknown about the human mind

01:41.680 --> 01:44.920
 with both an openness of first principle thinking

01:44.920 --> 01:47.880
 and the rigor of the scientific method.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.960

01:58.020 --> 02:01.980
 And now, here's my conversation with Matthew Johnson.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.920
 Can you give an introduction to psychedelics,

02:05.920 --> 02:08.760
 like a whirlwind overview?

02:08.760 --> 02:11.680
 Maybe what are psychedelics

02:11.680 --> 02:14.560
 and what are the kinds of psychedelics out there

02:14.560 --> 02:17.580
 and in whatever way you find meaningful to categorize?

02:17.580 --> 02:22.580
 Yeah, you can categorize them by their chemical structure.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.500
 So, phenethylamines, tryptamines, ergolines,

02:29.160 --> 02:33.880
 that is less of a meaningful way to classify them.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.700
 I think that their pharmacological activity,

02:36.700 --> 02:39.340
 their receptor activities are the best way.

02:39.340 --> 02:40.920
 Well, let me start even broader than that

02:40.920 --> 02:43.640
 because there I'm talking about the classic psychedelics.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.920
 So, broadly speaking, when we say psychedelic,

02:47.920 --> 02:50.240
 that refers to, for most people,

02:50.240 --> 02:52.260
 a broad number of compounds

02:52.260 --> 02:54.960
 that work in different pharmacological ways.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.200
 So, it includes the so called classic psychedelics.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.040
 That includes psilocybin and psilocin,

03:03.040 --> 03:08.040
 which are in mushrooms, LSD, dimethyltryptamine or DMT,

03:08.360 --> 03:10.840
 it's in ayahuasca, people can smoke it too,

03:10.840 --> 03:15.580
 mescaline, which is in peyote in San Pedro, cactus.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.880
 And those all work by hitting a certain

03:20.880 --> 03:24.500
 subtype of serotonin receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.200
 They act as agonists at that receptor.

03:28.560 --> 03:33.560
 Other compounds like PCP, ketamine, MDMA, ibogaine,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.060
 they all are more broadly speaking called psychedelics,

03:40.060 --> 03:45.060
 but they work by very different ways pharmacologically.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.200
 And they have some different effects,

03:48.200 --> 03:49.660
 including some subjective effects,

03:49.660 --> 03:53.140
 even though there's enough of an overlap

03:53.140 --> 03:56.460
 in the subjective effects that, you know,

03:56.460 --> 03:59.160
 people informally refer to them as psychedelic.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.320
 And I think what that overlap is, you know,

04:01.320 --> 04:04.320
 compared to say, you know, caffeine and cocaine

04:04.320 --> 04:08.680
 and, you know, Ambien, et cetera, other psychoactive drugs

04:08.680 --> 04:11.400
 is that they have strong effects

04:11.400 --> 04:15.960
 in altering one's sense of reality

04:15.960 --> 04:18.040
 and including the sense of self.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.660
 And I should throw in there that cannabis,

04:20.660 --> 04:22.440
 more historically, like in the 70s,

04:22.440 --> 04:24.040
 has been called a minor psychedelic.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.780
 And I think with that latter definition,

04:25.780 --> 04:28.080
 it does fit that definition,

04:28.080 --> 04:30.460
 particularly if one doesn't have a tolerance.

04:30.460 --> 04:34.040
 So you mentioned serotonin, so most of the effect

04:34.040 --> 04:36.960
 comes from something around like the chemistry

04:36.960 --> 04:39.000
 around neurotransmitters and so on.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.800
 So it's chemical interactions in the brain,

04:42.800 --> 04:44.600
 or is there other kinds of interactions

04:44.600 --> 04:47.880
 that have this kind of perception

04:47.880 --> 04:51.300
 and self awareness altering effects?

04:51.300 --> 04:54.600
 Well, as far as we know, all of the psychedelics

04:54.600 --> 04:58.800
 of all the different classes we've talked about,

05:00.500 --> 05:04.640
 their major activity is caused by receptor level events.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.640
 So either acting at the post receptor side of the synapse.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.240
 So in other words, neurotransmission operates

05:12.240 --> 05:16.640
 by, you know, one neuron releasing neurotransmitter

05:16.640 --> 05:19.240
 into a synapse, a gap between the two neurons.

05:19.240 --> 05:23.080
 And then the other neuron receives,

05:23.080 --> 05:24.680
 it has receptors that receives,

05:24.680 --> 05:28.600
 and then there can be an activation caused by that.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.240
 So it's like a pitcher and a catcher.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.920
 So all of the major psychedelics work

05:32.920 --> 05:34.640
 by either acting as a pitcher,

05:34.640 --> 05:38.760
 mimicking a pitcher or a catcher.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.400
 So for example, the classic psychedelics,

05:41.400 --> 05:44.400
 they fit into the same catcher's mitt

05:44.400 --> 05:48.440
 on the post receptor, post synaptic receptor side

05:48.440 --> 05:50.200
 as serotonin itself.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.520
 But they do a slightly different thing to the cell,

05:53.520 --> 05:56.400
 to the neuron than serotonin does.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.240
 There's a different signaling pathway

05:58.240 --> 06:00.420
 after that initial activation.

06:00.420 --> 06:04.840
 Something like MDMA works at the presynaptic side,

06:04.840 --> 06:06.560
 the pitcher side.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.240
 And basically it floods the synapse or the gap

06:09.240 --> 06:11.000
 between the cells with a bunch of serotonin,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.200
 the natural neurotransmitter.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.280
 So it's like the pitcher in a baseball game

06:16.280 --> 06:17.840
 all of a sudden just starts throwing balls

06:17.840 --> 06:20.380
 like every second.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.760
 Everything we're talking about is it often more natural,

06:24.760 --> 06:27.680
 meaning found in the natural world.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.000
 You mentioned cacti, cactus,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.200
 or is it chemically manufactured,

06:33.200 --> 06:35.540
 like artificially in the lab?

06:35.540 --> 06:38.560
 So the classic psychedelics, there's...

06:38.560 --> 06:39.760
 What are the classics?

06:39.760 --> 06:44.360
 So using terminology that's not chemical terminology,

06:44.360 --> 06:47.220
 not like the terminology you see in titles of papers,

06:47.220 --> 06:50.160
 academic papers, but more sort of common parlance.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.600
 Right, it would be good to kind of define their effects,

06:53.600 --> 06:54.880
 like how they're different.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.520
 And so it includes LSD, psilocybin,

06:57.520 --> 07:00.720
 which is in mushrooms, mescaline, DMT.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.880
 Which one is mescaline?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.160
 Mescaline is in the different cacti.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.320
 So the one most people will know is peyote,

07:07.320 --> 07:10.960
 but it also shows up in San Pedro or Peruvian torch.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.320
 And all of these classic psychedelics,

07:14.320 --> 07:17.240
 they have, at the right dose,

07:17.240 --> 07:20.640
 and typically they have very strong effects

07:20.640 --> 07:23.400
 on one sense of reality and one sense of self.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.480
 Some of the things that makes them different

07:26.480 --> 07:29.360
 than other more broadly speaking psychedelics,

07:29.360 --> 07:32.000
 like MDMA and others,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.760
 is that they're, at least the major examples,

07:35.760 --> 07:37.420
 there's some exotic ones that differ,

07:37.420 --> 07:40.100
 but the ones I've talked about are extremely safe

07:40.100 --> 07:42.120
 at the physiological level.

07:42.120 --> 07:46.040
 Like LSD and psilocybin, there's no known lethal overdose,

07:46.040 --> 07:50.400
 unless you have like really severe heart disease,

07:50.400 --> 07:52.120
 because it modestly raises your blood pressure.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.780
 So same person that might be hurt traveling snow

07:54.780 --> 07:59.780
 or going up the stairs, that could have a cardiac event

08:00.320 --> 08:03.040
 because they've taken one of these drugs.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.760
 But for most people, someone could take a thousand times

08:05.760 --> 08:06.840
 what the effective dose is,

08:06.840 --> 08:09.480
 and it's not gonna cause any organ damage,

08:09.480 --> 08:11.400
 affect the brainstem, make them stop breathing.

08:11.400 --> 08:16.040
 So in that sense, they're freakishly safe at the physiolo...

08:16.040 --> 08:18.000
 I would never call any compounds safe,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.600
 because there's always a risk.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.200
 They're freakishly safe at the physiological level.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.720
 I mean, you can hardly find anything over the counter

08:24.720 --> 08:26.240
 like that, I mean, aspirin's not like that.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.080
 Caffeine is not like that.

08:28.080 --> 08:33.080
 Most drugs, you take five, 10, 20, maybe it takes 100,

08:33.400 --> 08:36.120
 but you get to some times the effective dose,

08:36.120 --> 08:38.680
 and it's gonna kill you or cause some serious damage.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.080
 And so that's something that's remarkable

08:41.080 --> 08:43.840
 about most of these classic psychedelics.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.020
 That's incredible, by the way,

08:45.020 --> 08:48.460
 that you can go on a hell of a journey in the mind,

08:48.460 --> 08:52.580
 like probably transformative,

08:52.580 --> 08:56.740
 potentially in a deeply transformative way,

08:56.740 --> 08:59.240
 and yet there's no dose

08:59.240 --> 09:02.540
 that in most people would have a lethal effect.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.720
 That's kind of fascinating.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.820
 There's this duality between the mind and the body.

09:06.820 --> 09:08.500
 It's like, it's the...

09:09.740 --> 09:11.440
 Okay, sorry if I bring them up way too much,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.060
 but David Goggins is like,

09:14.320 --> 09:17.060
 the kind of things you go on in the long run,

09:17.060 --> 09:19.680
 like the hell you might go through in your mind.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.940
 Your mind can take a lot,

09:20.940 --> 09:22.880
 and you can go through a lot with the mind,

09:22.880 --> 09:25.060
 and the body will just be its own thing.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.340
 You can go through hell,

09:26.340 --> 09:30.100
 but after a good night's sleep, be back to normal,

09:30.100 --> 09:31.580
 and the body's always there.

09:31.580 --> 09:32.860
 So bringing it back to Goggins,

09:32.860 --> 09:33.940
 it's like you can do that

09:33.940 --> 09:36.140
 without even destroying your knee or whatever,

09:36.140 --> 09:37.980
 or coming close and riding that line.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.820
 That's true.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.340
 So the unfortunate thing about the running,

09:40.340 --> 09:42.960
 which he uses running to test the mind,

09:42.960 --> 09:47.140
 so the aspect of running that is negative,

09:47.140 --> 09:48.200
 in order to test the mind,

09:48.200 --> 09:51.380
 you really have to push the body,

09:51.380 --> 09:53.140
 take the body through a journey.

09:53.140 --> 09:55.780
 I wish there was another way of doing that

09:55.780 --> 09:57.500
 in the physical exercise space.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.820
 I think there are exercises

09:59.820 --> 10:01.340
 that are easier on the body than others,

10:01.340 --> 10:04.940
 but running sure is a hell of an effective way to do it.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.020
 And one of the ways that where it differs

10:07.020 --> 10:10.520
 is that you're unlike exercise,

10:10.520 --> 10:13.380
 you're essentially, most exercise,

10:13.380 --> 10:15.460
 to really get to those intense levels,

10:15.460 --> 10:17.980
 you really need to be persistent about it.

10:17.980 --> 10:19.700
 I mean, it'll be intense if you're really out of shape,

10:19.700 --> 10:22.640
 just jogging for five minutes,

10:22.640 --> 10:24.100
 but to really get to those intense levels,

10:24.100 --> 10:25.860
 you need to have the dedication.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.180
 And so some of the other ways

10:27.180 --> 10:32.180
 of altering subjective effects or states of consciousness,

10:33.300 --> 10:35.260
 take that type of dedication.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.040
 Psychedelics though, I mean, someone takes the right dose.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.500
 They're strapped into the rollercoaster

10:41.500 --> 10:44.420
 and something interesting is gonna happen.

10:44.420 --> 10:48.220
 And I really like what you said about that distinction

10:48.220 --> 10:51.580
 between the mind or the contrast between the mind effects

10:51.580 --> 10:55.500
 and the body effects,

10:55.500 --> 10:58.620
 because I think of this,

10:58.620 --> 11:01.460
 I do research with all the drugs,

11:01.460 --> 11:04.380
 caffeine, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine,

11:04.380 --> 11:06.740
 alcohol, legal, illegal.

11:06.740 --> 11:11.740
 Most of these drugs, thinking about say cocaine

11:11.780 --> 11:15.740
 and methamphetamine, you can't give to a regular user,

11:15.740 --> 11:20.740
 you can't safely give a dose where the regular cocaine user

11:21.060 --> 11:24.100
 is gonna say, oh man, that's like,

11:25.060 --> 11:28.340
 that's the strongest coke I've ever had, you know,

11:28.340 --> 11:30.740
 because you get it past the ethics committee

11:30.740 --> 11:32.260
 and you need approval.

11:32.260 --> 11:34.300
 And I wouldn't wanna give someone something that's dangerous.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.180
 So to go to those levels where they would say that,

11:37.180 --> 11:38.180
 you would have to give something

11:38.180 --> 11:43.180
 that's physiologically riskier, you know.

11:43.340 --> 11:46.900
 Psilocybin or LSD, you can give a dose

11:46.900 --> 11:50.660
 at the physiological level that is like very good chance

11:50.660 --> 11:53.540
 it's gonna be the most intense psychological experience

11:53.540 --> 11:56.260
 of that person's life and have zero chance

11:56.260 --> 11:58.900
 for most people if you screen them of killing them.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.320
 The big risk is behavioral toxicity,

12:01.320 --> 12:03.820
 which is a fancy way of saying doing something stupid.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.180
 I mean, you're really intoxicated,

12:05.180 --> 12:08.100
 like if you wander into traffic or you fall from a height,

12:08.100 --> 12:11.420
 just like plenty of people do on high doses of alcohol.

12:11.420 --> 12:13.020
 And the other kind of unique thing

12:13.020 --> 12:17.540
 about classic psychedelics is that they're not addictive,

12:17.540 --> 12:20.740
 which is pretty much unheard of when it comes

12:20.740 --> 12:24.740
 to so called drugs of abuse or drugs that people,

12:24.740 --> 12:29.500
 at least at some frequency choose to take, you know,

12:29.500 --> 12:32.860
 most of what we think of as drugs, you know,

12:32.860 --> 12:35.640
 even caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis,

12:36.500 --> 12:39.000
 most of these you can get into alcohol,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.960
 you can get into a daily use pattern.

12:41.960 --> 12:46.700
 And that's just extreme, so unheard of with psychedelics.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.880
 Most people have taken these things on a daily basis,

12:49.880 --> 12:53.380
 it's more of like they're building up the courage to do it

12:53.380 --> 12:55.040
 and then they build up a tolerance or yeah,

12:55.040 --> 12:56.540
 they're in college and they do it on a dare,

12:56.540 --> 12:59.100
 can you take take acid seven days in a row

12:59.100 --> 13:02.340
 and that type of thing rather than a self control issue

13:02.340 --> 13:04.460
 where you have and say, oh God, I gotta stop taking this,

13:04.460 --> 13:06.100
 I gotta stop drinking every night,

13:06.100 --> 13:08.860
 I gotta cut down on the coke, whatever.

13:08.860 --> 13:11.340
 So that's the classic psychedelics.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.340
 What are the, what's a good term, modern psychedelics

13:15.340 --> 13:18.480
 or more maybe psychedelics that are created in the lab?

13:18.480 --> 13:19.680
 What else is there?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.260
 Right, so MDMA is the big one.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.920
 And I should say that with the classic psychedelics,

13:23.920 --> 13:26.820
 that LSD is sort of, you can call it a semi synthetic

13:26.820 --> 13:30.860
 because there's natural from both ergot

13:30.860 --> 13:34.920
 and in certain seeds, morning glory seeds as one example,

13:34.920 --> 13:36.180
 there's a very close,

13:36.180 --> 13:40.780
 there are some very close chemical relatives of LSD.

13:40.780 --> 13:44.900
 So LSD is close to what occurs in nature, but not quite.

13:44.900 --> 13:49.540
 But then when we get into the other non classic psychedelics,

13:49.540 --> 13:51.660
 probably the most prominent one is MDMA,

13:51.660 --> 13:54.080
 people call it ecstasy, people call it Molly.

13:55.380 --> 13:59.580
 And it is, it differs from classic psychedelics

13:59.580 --> 14:04.580
 in a number of ways, it can be addictive, but not so.

14:04.580 --> 14:07.380
 It's like, you can have cocaine on this end

14:07.380 --> 14:10.620
 of the continuum and classic psychedelics here.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.700
 Continuum of addiction.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.140
 Continuum of addiction, you know,

14:13.140 --> 14:15.060
 so it's certainly no cocaine.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.860
 It's pretty rare for people to get into daily use patterns,

14:17.860 --> 14:20.940
 but it's possible and they can get into more like,

14:20.940 --> 14:23.140
 you know, using once a week pattern

14:23.140 --> 14:25.180
 where they can find it hard to stop,

14:25.180 --> 14:28.700
 but it's somewhere in between mostly towards the,

14:28.700 --> 14:31.820
 to the classic psychedelic side in terms of

14:33.580 --> 14:35.860
 like relatively little addiction potential.

14:36.740 --> 14:39.540
 But it's also more physiologically dangerous.

14:39.540 --> 14:43.260
 I think that the, certainly the therapeutic use,

14:44.220 --> 14:47.220
 it's showing really promising effects for treating PTSD

14:47.220 --> 14:48.220
 and the models that are used,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.860
 I think those are extremely acceptable

14:50.860 --> 14:52.660
 when it comes to the risk benefit ratio

14:52.660 --> 14:54.960
 that you see all throughout medicine.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.560
 But nonetheless, we do know that at a certain dose

14:58.560 --> 15:02.840
 and a certain frequency that MDMA can cause longterm damage

15:02.840 --> 15:05.880
 to the serotonin system in the brain.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.000
 So it doesn't have that level of kind of freakish

15:10.000 --> 15:13.160
 bodily safety that the classic psychedelics do.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.000
 And it has more of a heart load, a cardiovascular,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.560
 I don't mean kind of emotion, I mean, in this sense,

15:18.560 --> 15:19.800
 although it is very emotional

15:19.800 --> 15:23.120
 and that's something unique about its subjective effects,

15:23.120 --> 15:25.760
 subjective effects, but it's more of a oppressor.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.320
 And the terminology you use instead of

15:28.320 --> 15:30.200
 like a freakish capacities,

15:30.200 --> 15:32.280
 allowing you from a researcher perspective,

15:32.280 --> 15:33.640
 but a personal perspective too,

15:33.640 --> 15:37.360
 of taking a journey with some of these psychedelics

15:37.360 --> 15:40.880
 that is the heroic dose, as they say.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.000
 So like these are tools that allow you

15:43.000 --> 15:45.640
 to take a serious mental journey, whatever that is.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.480
 That's what you mean.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.040
 And with MDMA, there's a little bit,

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
 it starts entering this territory

15:51.040 --> 15:53.760
 where you gotta be careful about the risks

15:53.760 --> 15:55.040
 to the body potentially.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.400
 So yes, that in the sense that you can't kind of

15:58.400 --> 16:02.760
 push the dose up as high as you safely as one can,

16:02.760 --> 16:05.000
 if they're in the right setting, like in our research

16:05.000 --> 16:07.280
 as they can with the classic psychedelics.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.360
 But probably more importantly,

16:09.360 --> 16:11.200
 just the nature of the effects with MDMA

16:11.200 --> 16:14.480
 aren't the full on psychedelic.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.560
 It's not the full journey.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.280
 So it's sort of a psychedelic with rose colored glasses on.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.880
 A psychedelic that's more of,

16:22.880 --> 16:25.400
 it's been called more of a heart trip than a head trip.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.760
 The nature of reality doesn't unravel

16:28.760 --> 16:32.360
 as frequently as it does with classic psychedelics.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.280
 But you're able to more directly sense your environment.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.040
 So your perception system still works.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.320
 It's not completely detached from reality with MDMA.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.880
 That's true, relatively speaking.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.760
 That said at most doses of classic psychedelics,

16:45.760 --> 16:48.600
 you still have a tether to reality.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.920
 Changes a little bit when you're talking about smoking DMT

16:50.920 --> 16:53.080
 or smoking 5 methoxy DMT,

16:54.160 --> 16:56.240
 which are some interesting examples

16:56.240 --> 16:57.480
 we could talk more about.

16:57.480 --> 17:02.480
 But with MDMA, for example,

17:02.840 --> 17:07.840
 it's very rare to have what's called an ego loss experience

17:07.960 --> 17:10.760
 or a sense of transcendental unity,

17:10.760 --> 17:15.360
 where one really seemingly loses

17:15.360 --> 17:19.000
 the psychological construct of the self.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
 But MDMA, it's very common for people to have this,

17:24.160 --> 17:26.760
 they still are perceiving themselves as a self,

17:26.760 --> 17:30.240
 but it's common for them to have this warmth,

17:30.240 --> 17:32.280
 this empathy for humanity

17:32.280 --> 17:34.120
 and for their friends and loved ones.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.440
 So it's more, and you see those effects

17:36.440 --> 17:38.680
 under the classic psychedelics,

17:38.680 --> 17:41.480
 but that's a subset of what the classic psychedelics do.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.400
 So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects

17:44.400 --> 17:47.560
 is if you think about Venn diagrams,

17:47.560 --> 17:50.520
 it's sort of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics.

17:50.520 --> 17:54.240
 So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session,

17:54.240 --> 17:58.160
 sometimes a psilocybin session looks just like that,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.560
 but then sometimes it's completely different with psilocybin.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.760
 It's a little more narrowed

18:02.760 --> 18:05.200
 in terms of the variability with MDMA.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.680
 Is there something general to say about what the psychedelics

18:09.680 --> 18:11.560
 do to the human mind?

18:11.560 --> 18:14.520
 You mentioned kind of an ego loss experience

18:14.520 --> 18:16.600
 in the space of Venn diagrams.

18:16.600 --> 18:20.040
 If we're to like draw a big circle,

18:20.040 --> 18:22.120
 what can we say about that big circle?

18:23.640 --> 18:28.520
 In terms of people's report of subjective experience,

18:28.520 --> 18:31.720
 probably one of the most general things we can say

18:31.720 --> 18:35.160
 is that it expands that range.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.280
 So many people come out of these sessions

18:38.280 --> 18:41.800
 saying that they didn't know it was possible

18:41.800 --> 18:44.080
 to have an experience like that.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.120
 So there's an emphasis on the subjective experience

18:47.120 --> 18:52.120
 that is there words that people put to it

18:52.960 --> 18:55.080
 that capture that experience

18:55.080 --> 19:00.040
 or is it something that just has to be experienced?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.000
 Yeah, people like...

19:02.000 --> 19:03.680
 As a researcher, that's an interesting question

19:03.680 --> 19:08.680
 because you have to kind of measure the effects of this

19:10.280 --> 19:13.160
 and how do you convert that into numbers?

19:13.160 --> 19:14.000
 Right.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.560
 That's the ultimate challenge.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.760
 So is that possible to one, convert it into words

19:19.760 --> 19:22.280
 and the second, convert the words into numbers somehow?

19:22.280 --> 19:25.080
 So we do a lot of that with questionnaires,

19:25.080 --> 19:28.040
 some of which are very psychometrically validated.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.880
 So lots of numbers have been crunched on them.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.520
 And there's always a limitation with questionnaires.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.560
 I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.800
 Ultimately, it's what the person is reporting

19:38.800 --> 19:43.360
 and that doesn't necessarily point towards a ground truth.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.800
 So for example, if someone says

19:46.800 --> 19:48.880
 that they felt like they touched another dimension

19:48.880 --> 19:52.440
 or they felt like they sensed the reality of God

19:52.440 --> 19:57.200
 or if they, I mean, just you name it,

19:57.200 --> 20:01.160
 people's ontological views can sometimes shift.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.080
 I think that's more about where they're coming from

20:03.080 --> 20:05.120
 and I don't think it's the quintessential way

20:05.120 --> 20:05.960
 in which they work.

20:05.960 --> 20:06.800
 There's plenty of people that hold

20:06.800 --> 20:09.600
 onto a completely naturalistic viewpoint

20:09.600 --> 20:14.600
 and have profound and helpful experiences

20:15.080 --> 20:16.760
 with these compounds.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.680
 But the subjective effects can be so broad

20:20.680 --> 20:24.600
 that for some people, it shifts their philosophical

20:24.600 --> 20:27.280
 viewpoint more towards idealism,

20:27.280 --> 20:32.280
 more towards thinking that the nature of reality

20:32.280 --> 20:37.280
 might be more about consciousness than about material.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.280
 That's a domain I'm very interested in.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.680
 Right now, we have essentially zero to say about that

20:43.680 --> 20:46.140
 in terms of validating those types of claims,

20:46.140 --> 20:47.400
 but it's even interesting just to see

20:47.400 --> 20:49.280
 what people say along those lines.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.840
 So you're interested in saying like,

20:50.840 --> 20:54.600
 can we more rigorously study this process of expansion?

20:54.600 --> 20:57.000
 Like, what do we mean by this expansion

20:57.000 --> 21:00.760
 of your sense of what is possible

21:00.760 --> 21:02.880
 in the experiences in this world?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.400
 Right, as much as what we can say about that

21:05.400 --> 21:07.760
 through naturalistic psychology,

21:07.760 --> 21:09.520
 especially as much as we can root it

21:09.520 --> 21:13.520
 to solid psychological constructs

21:13.520 --> 21:16.200
 and solid neuroscientific constructs.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.920
 And I wonder what the impact is of the language

21:18.920 --> 21:20.520
 that you bring to the table.

21:20.520 --> 21:25.080
 So you mentioned about God or speaking of God,

21:25.080 --> 21:26.560
 a lot of people are really into sort of

21:26.560 --> 21:29.440
 theoretical physics these days at a very surface level

21:29.440 --> 21:31.920
 and you can bring the language of physics, right?

21:31.920 --> 21:33.920
 You can talk about quantum mechanics,

21:33.920 --> 21:36.560
 you can talk about general relativity

21:36.560 --> 21:40.520
 and curvature of space time and using just that language

21:40.520 --> 21:43.280
 without a deep technical understanding of it

21:43.280 --> 21:45.680
 to somehow start thinking like,

21:45.680 --> 21:48.040
 sort of visualizing atoms in your head

21:48.040 --> 21:50.560
 and somehow through that process

21:50.560 --> 21:51.860
 because you have the language,

21:51.860 --> 21:55.280
 using that language to kind of dissolve the ego,

21:55.280 --> 21:58.880
 like realize like that we're just all little bits

21:58.880 --> 22:02.800
 of physical objects that behave in mysterious ways.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.800
 And so that has to do with the language.

22:04.800 --> 22:08.000
 Like if you read a Sean Carroll book or something recently,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.820
 it seems like it has a huge influence

22:09.820 --> 22:13.720
 on the way you might experience,

22:13.720 --> 22:16.120
 might perceive the world and might experience

22:16.120 --> 22:19.520
 the alteration that psychedelics brings

22:19.520 --> 22:23.280
 to your perception system.

22:23.280 --> 22:26.000
 So I wonder like the language you bring to the table,

22:26.000 --> 22:30.480
 how that affects the journey you go on with the psychedelics.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.760
 I think very much so.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.920
 And I think there's, I'm a little concerned

22:34.920 --> 22:36.760
 some of the science is going a little too far

22:36.760 --> 22:40.520
 in the direction of around the edges,

22:40.520 --> 22:44.880
 speaking about it changing beliefs in this sense

22:44.880 --> 22:48.800
 or that sense about particular, in particular domains.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.680
 And I think what really what a lot of what's going on

22:51.680 --> 22:53.720
 is what you just discussed.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.840
 It's the priors coming into it.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.980
 So if you've been reading a lot of physics,

23:00.980 --> 23:05.880
 then you might bring up like space time

23:05.880 --> 23:08.120
 and interpret the experience in that sense.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.000
 I mean, it's not uncommon for people come out

23:10.000 --> 23:11.400
 talking about visions of the,

23:12.480 --> 23:13.520
 it's not the most typical thing,

23:13.520 --> 23:16.120
 but it's come up in sessions I've guided,

23:16.120 --> 23:21.120
 the Big Bang and this sort of nature of reality.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.880
 I think probably that the best way to think

23:23.880 --> 23:26.440
 about these experiences is that,

23:26.440 --> 23:27.480
 and the best evidence,

23:27.480 --> 23:30.460
 even though we're in our infancy and understanding it,

23:30.460 --> 23:34.720
 they really tap into more general psychological mechanisms.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.200
 I think one of the best arguments

23:36.200 --> 23:41.200
 is they reduce the influence of our priors,

23:41.360 --> 23:45.360
 of what we bring into all of the assumptions

23:45.360 --> 23:47.320
 that we all that we're essentially,

23:47.320 --> 23:49.520
 especially as adults, we're riding on top of heuristic

23:49.520 --> 23:51.880
 after heuristic to get through life.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.280
 And you need to do that.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.360
 And that's a good thing.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.800
 And that's extremely efficient

23:55.800 --> 23:57.680
 and evolution has shaped that,

23:57.680 --> 23:59.760
 but that comes at an expense.

23:59.760 --> 24:04.760
 And it seems that these experiences

24:04.860 --> 24:09.860
 will allow someone greater mental flexibility and openness.

24:12.040 --> 24:16.960
 And so one can be both less influenced

24:16.960 --> 24:18.940
 by their prior assumptions,

24:18.940 --> 24:22.160
 but still nonetheless the nature of the experience

24:22.160 --> 24:24.760
 can be influenced by what they've been exposed to

24:24.760 --> 24:25.600
 in the world.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.440
 And sometimes they can get it in a deeper way.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.280
 Like maybe they've read,

24:29.280 --> 24:31.520
 I mean, I had a philosophy professor one time

24:31.520 --> 24:34.960
 as a participant in a high dose psilocybin study.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.720
 And I remember him saying, my God,

24:37.720 --> 24:40.440
 it's like Hegel's opposites defining each other.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.580
 Like, I get it.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.600
 I've taught this thing for years and years and years.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.380
 Like, I get it now.

24:46.380 --> 24:49.120
 And so like that, you know,

24:49.120 --> 24:51.480
 and even at the psychological, emotional level,

24:51.480 --> 24:54.680
 like the cancer patients we worked with,

24:54.680 --> 24:56.280
 you know, they told themselves a million times

24:56.280 --> 24:57.680
 over this people trying to quit smoking,

24:57.680 --> 24:58.680
 I need to quit smoking.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.760
 Oh, I'm ruining my life with this cancer.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.600
 I'm still healthy.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.420
 I should be getting out.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.680
 I'm letting this thing defeat me.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.240
 It's like, yeah, you told yourself that in your head,

25:05.240 --> 25:07.800
 but sometimes they had these experiences

25:07.800 --> 25:10.160
 and they kind of feel it in their heart.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.920
 Like they really get it.

25:11.920 --> 25:16.920
 So in some sense that you bring some prize to the table,

25:17.620 --> 25:22.040
 but psychedelics allow you to acknowledge them

25:22.040 --> 25:23.320
 and then throw them away.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.680
 So like one popular terminology around this

25:26.680 --> 25:29.760
 in the engineering space is first principles thinking

25:29.760 --> 25:33.820
 that Elon Musk, for example, espouses a lot.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.060
 Let me ask a fun question

25:35.060 --> 25:38.380
 before we return to a more serious discussion.

25:38.380 --> 25:42.140
 With Elon Musk as an example,

25:42.140 --> 25:45.100
 but it could be just engineers in general,

25:45.100 --> 25:48.520
 do you think there's a use for psychedelics

25:48.520 --> 25:53.520
 to take a journey of rigorous first principles thinking?

25:54.100 --> 25:55.620
 So like throwing away,

25:55.620 --> 25:58.380
 we're not talking about throwing away assumptions

25:58.380 --> 26:02.080
 about the nature of reality in terms of like our philosophy

26:02.080 --> 26:04.020
 of the way we live day to day life,

26:04.020 --> 26:08.220
 but we're talking about like how to build a better rocket

26:08.220 --> 26:09.980
 or how to build a better car

26:09.980 --> 26:12.380
 or how to build a better social network

26:12.380 --> 26:15.060
 or all those kinds of things, engineering questions.

26:15.060 --> 26:17.740
 I absolutely think there's huge potential there.

26:17.740 --> 26:22.740
 And there was some research in the late 60s, early 70s

26:22.860 --> 26:26.060
 that were, it was very early and not very rigorous

26:26.060 --> 26:31.060
 in terms of methodology, but it was consistent with the,

26:31.380 --> 26:34.020
 I mean, there's just countless anecdotes of folks.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.380
 I mean, people have argued that just,

26:36.380 --> 26:39.460
 Silicon Valley was largely influenced

26:39.460 --> 26:41.500
 by psychedelic experience.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.780
 I remember the, I think the person that came up

26:43.780 --> 26:46.260
 with the concept of freeware or shareware,

26:46.260 --> 26:50.460
 it's like it kind of was generated out of

26:50.460 --> 26:53.720
 or influenced by psychedelic experience.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.340
 So to this, I think there's incredible potential there

26:56.340 --> 26:59.380
 and we know really next,

26:59.380 --> 27:03.180
 there's no rigorous research on that, but.

27:03.180 --> 27:05.700
 Is there anecdotal stuff like with Steve Jobs?

27:05.700 --> 27:07.500
 I think there's stories, right?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.020
 In your exploration of that,

27:09.020 --> 27:12.700
 is there something a little bit more than just stories?

27:12.700 --> 27:16.420
 Is there like a little bit more of a solid data points,

27:16.420 --> 27:20.820
 even if they're just experiential like anecdotes?

27:20.820 --> 27:22.960
 Is there something that you draw inspiration from

27:22.960 --> 27:24.340
 like in your intuition?

27:24.340 --> 27:25.580
 Because we'll talk about,

27:25.580 --> 27:27.220
 you're trying to construct studies

27:27.220 --> 27:29.420
 that are more rigorous around these questions.

27:29.420 --> 27:31.660
 But is there something you draw inspiration from,

27:31.660 --> 27:34.220
 from the past, from the 80s and the 90s

27:34.220 --> 27:37.200
 and Silicon Valley, that kind of space?

27:37.200 --> 27:40.400
 Or is it just like you have a sense

27:40.400 --> 27:42.560
 based on everything you've learned

27:42.560 --> 27:44.620
 and these kind of loose stories

27:44.620 --> 27:47.460
 that there's something worth digging at?

27:47.460 --> 27:50.140
 I am influenced by the, gosh,

27:50.140 --> 27:55.140
 the just incredible number of anecdotes surrounding these.

27:55.420 --> 27:56.260
 I mean,

27:58.820 --> 28:02.140
 Carey Mullis, he invented PCR.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.900
 I mean, absolutely revolutionized biological sciences.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.380
 He says he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize for him.

28:08.380 --> 28:09.780
 He said he wouldn't have come up with that

28:09.780 --> 28:12.040
 had he not had psychedelic experiences.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.500
 Now, he's an interesting character.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.100
 People should read his autobiography

28:17.100 --> 28:19.940
 because you could point to other things he was into.

28:19.940 --> 28:22.660
 But I think that speaks to the casting your nets wide

28:22.660 --> 28:23.740
 and this mental flex,

28:23.740 --> 28:27.320
 more of these general mechanisms

28:27.320 --> 28:29.700
 where sometimes if you cast your nets really wide

28:29.700 --> 28:31.260
 and it's gonna depend on the person

28:31.260 --> 28:32.220
 and their influences,

28:32.220 --> 28:35.220
 but sometimes you come up with false positives.

28:38.180 --> 28:39.040
 You connect the dots

28:39.040 --> 28:41.220
 where maybe you shouldn't have connected those dots,

28:41.220 --> 28:44.700
 but I think that can be constrained.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.200
 And so much of our,

28:47.200 --> 28:49.180
 not only our personal psychological suffering,

28:49.180 --> 28:53.160
 but our limitations academically

28:53.160 --> 28:55.620
 and in terms of technology

28:55.620 --> 28:59.500
 are because of the self imposed limitations

28:59.500 --> 29:03.620
 and heuristics, these entrenched ways of thinking.

29:03.620 --> 29:06.460
 Like those examples throughout the history of science

29:06.460 --> 29:09.580
 where someone has come up with the paradigm,

29:09.580 --> 29:11.600
 Kuhn's paradigm shifts.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.540
 It's like, here's something completely different.

29:14.540 --> 29:17.140
 This doesn't make sense by any of the previous models.

29:17.140 --> 29:20.500
 And like, we need more of those.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.620
 And then you need the right balance between that

29:22.620 --> 29:27.220
 because so many of the novel crazy ideas are just bunk

29:27.220 --> 29:31.040
 and that's what science is about separating them

29:31.040 --> 29:33.860
 from the valid paradigm shifting ideas.

29:33.860 --> 29:38.860
 But we need more paradigm shifting ideas like in a big way.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.260
 And I think we could,

29:40.260 --> 29:42.060
 I think you could argue that we've,

29:42.060 --> 29:45.100
 because of the structure of academia and science

29:45.100 --> 29:49.060
 in modern times, it heavily biases against those.

29:49.060 --> 29:52.620
 Right, there's all kinds of mechanisms in our human nature

29:52.620 --> 29:56.940
 that resist paradigm shift quite sort of obviously.

29:56.940 --> 30:01.040
 So, and psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools

30:01.040 --> 30:04.740
 but it seems like psychedelics could be one set of tools

30:04.740 --> 30:08.980
 that encourage paradigm shifting thinking.

30:08.980 --> 30:11.380
 So like the first principles kind of thinking.

30:11.380 --> 30:16.100
 So it's a kind of, you're at the forefront of research here.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.780
 There's just kind of anecdotal stories.

30:18.780 --> 30:21.300
 There's early studies.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.500
 There's a sense that we don't understand very much

30:24.500 --> 30:26.740
 but there's a lot of depth here.

30:26.740 --> 30:31.460
 How do we get from there to where Elon and I can regularly,

30:31.460 --> 30:35.020
 like I wake up every morning, I have deep work sessions

30:35.020 --> 30:40.020
 where it's well understood like what dose to take.

30:41.740 --> 30:45.980
 Like if I want to explore something where it's all legal,

30:45.980 --> 30:49.020
 where it's all understood and safe, all that kind of stuff.

30:49.020 --> 30:53.540
 How do we get from where we are today to there?

30:53.540 --> 30:57.260
 Not speaking in terms of legality in the sense like

30:57.260 --> 30:59.880
 policy making all that like laws and stuff,

30:59.880 --> 31:02.940
 meaning like how do we scientifically understand this stuff

31:02.940 --> 31:07.580
 well enough to get to a place where I can just take it safely

31:07.580 --> 31:10.780
 in order to expand my thinking,

31:10.780 --> 31:12.540
 like this kind of first principles thinking,

31:12.540 --> 31:14.780
 which I'm in my personal life currently doing.

31:14.780 --> 31:18.420
 Like how do I revolutionize particular several things?

31:18.420 --> 31:22.300
 Like it seems like the only tools I have right now

31:22.300 --> 31:27.300
 is just, just, but my mind going, doing the first principles

31:28.260 --> 31:30.020
 like, wait, wait, wait, okay.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.740
 Why has this been done this way?

31:31.740 --> 31:33.780
 Can we do it completely differently?

31:33.780 --> 31:37.500
 It seems like I'm still tethered to the priors

31:37.500 --> 31:39.060
 that I bring to the table

31:39.060 --> 31:40.860
 and I keep trying to untether myself.

31:40.860 --> 31:43.140
 Maybe there's tools that can systematically

31:43.140 --> 31:44.580
 help me untether.

31:44.580 --> 31:49.340
 Yeah, well, we need experiments and that's tied to

31:49.340 --> 31:51.980
 kind of the policy level stuff.

31:51.980 --> 31:52.820
 And I should be clear,

31:52.820 --> 31:57.140
 I would never encourage anyone to do anything illicitly.

31:57.140 --> 32:02.140
 But yeah, in the future, we could see these compounds

32:03.460 --> 32:08.420
 used for technical and scientific innovation.

32:08.420 --> 32:11.700
 What we need are studies that are digging into that.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.780
 Right now, most of what the funding,

32:13.780 --> 32:18.740
 which is largely from philanthropy, not from the government,

32:18.740 --> 32:23.300
 largely what it's for is treatment of mental disorders

32:23.300 --> 32:27.060
 like addiction and depression, et cetera.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.740
 But we need studies.

32:28.740 --> 32:33.740
 One of the early initial stabs on this question decades ago

32:34.740 --> 32:37.780
 was they took some architects and engineers

32:37.780 --> 32:40.860
 and said, what problems have you been working on?

32:40.860 --> 32:42.460
 Where have you been stuck for months

32:42.460 --> 32:43.740
 like working on this damn thing

32:43.740 --> 32:45.060
 and you're not getting anywhere,

32:45.060 --> 32:47.420
 like your head's butting up against the wall.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.180
 It's like, come in here, take,

32:49.180 --> 32:51.140
 and I think it was 100 micrograms of LSD.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.740
 So not a big session.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.260
 And a little bit different model

32:54.260 --> 32:55.260
 where they were actually working.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.340
 It was a moderate enough dose

32:56.340 --> 32:59.940
 where they could work on the problem during the session.

33:00.860 --> 33:04.460
 I think probably, I'm an empiricist,

33:04.460 --> 33:06.340
 so I'd like to see all the studies done.

33:06.340 --> 33:08.180
 But the first thing I would do is like

33:08.180 --> 33:10.580
 a really high dose session where you're not necessarily

33:10.580 --> 33:13.140
 in front of your computer,

33:13.140 --> 33:16.060
 which you can't really do on a really high dose.

33:16.060 --> 33:19.180
 And then the work has been talked about,

33:19.180 --> 33:21.780
 like you take a really high dose, you take a journey,

33:21.780 --> 33:23.740
 and then the breakthroughs come

33:23.740 --> 33:25.940
 from when you return from the journey

33:25.940 --> 33:29.100
 and like integrate, quote unquote, that experience.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.700
 I think that's where all the,

33:30.700 --> 33:33.700
 again, we're babies at this point,

33:33.700 --> 33:37.660
 but my gut tells me that it's the so called integration,

33:37.660 --> 33:38.500
 the aftermath.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.060
 We know that there's some different forms of neuroplasticity

33:41.060 --> 33:43.340
 that are unfolding in the days following a psychedelics,

33:43.340 --> 33:45.820
 at least in animals, probably going on humans.

33:45.820 --> 33:48.340
 We don't know if that's related to the therapeutic effects.

33:48.340 --> 33:50.660
 My gut tells me it is,

33:50.660 --> 33:52.980
 although it's only part of the story,

33:52.980 --> 33:55.700
 but we need big studies where we compare people,

33:55.700 --> 33:57.660
 like let's get a hundred people like that,

33:57.660 --> 34:00.420
 scientists that are working on a problem,

34:00.420 --> 34:02.140
 and then randomize them too.

34:02.140 --> 34:07.060
 And then I think you need even more credible,

34:07.060 --> 34:10.140
 active controls or active placebo conditions

34:10.140 --> 34:12.340
 to kind of tease this out.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.900
 And then also in conjunction with that,

34:14.900 --> 34:16.300
 and you can do this in the same study,

34:16.300 --> 34:19.180
 you wanna combine that with more rigorous

34:19.180 --> 34:22.900
 sort of experimental models

34:22.900 --> 34:25.260
 where we actually give there a problem solving tasks

34:25.260 --> 34:27.700
 that we know, for example, that you tend to do better on

34:27.700 --> 34:30.020
 after you've gotten a good night's sleep versus not.

34:30.020 --> 34:33.900
 And my sense is there's a relationship there.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.780
 People go back to first principles,

34:36.780 --> 34:39.220
 questioning those first principles they're operating under

34:39.220 --> 34:43.140
 and getting away from their priors

34:43.140 --> 34:45.380
 in terms of creative problem solving.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.460
 And so I think wrap those things

34:47.460 --> 34:50.180
 and you could speak a little more rigorously about those

34:50.180 --> 34:52.780
 because ultimately, if everyone's bringing their own problem,

34:52.780 --> 34:57.060
 that's more in the face valid side,

34:57.060 --> 34:58.780
 but you can't dig in as much

34:58.780 --> 35:01.300
 and get as much experimental power

35:01.300 --> 35:03.660
 and speak to the mechanisms as you can

35:03.660 --> 35:06.820
 with having everyone do the same sort of canned

35:06.820 --> 35:08.820
 problem solving task.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.980
 So we've been speaking about psychedelics generally.

35:10.980 --> 35:14.060
 Is there one you find from the scientific perspective

35:14.060 --> 35:16.300
 or maybe even philosophical perspective

35:16.300 --> 35:18.580
 most fascinating to study?

35:18.580 --> 35:22.340
 Therapeutically, I'm most interested in psilocybin and LSD

35:22.340 --> 35:24.380
 and I think we need to do a lot more with LSD

35:24.380 --> 35:27.060
 because it's mainly been psilocybin in the modern era.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.540
 I've recently gotten a grant

35:28.540 --> 35:32.260
 from the Heftar Research Institute to do an LSD study.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.420
 So I haven't started it yet,

35:33.420 --> 35:36.340
 but I'm going through the paperwork and everything.

35:36.340 --> 35:38.980
 Therapeutic meaning there's some issue

35:38.980 --> 35:40.380
 and you're trying to treat that issue.

35:40.380 --> 35:41.740
 Right, right.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.660
 In terms of just like, what's the most fascinating,

35:45.660 --> 35:47.660
 understanding the nature of these experiences,

35:47.660 --> 35:49.420
 if you really wanna like wrap your head around

35:49.420 --> 35:53.380
 what's going on when someone has a completely altered sense

35:53.380 --> 35:55.700
 of reality and sense of self,

35:55.700 --> 36:00.700
 there I think you're talking about the high dose,

36:00.980 --> 36:04.020
 either smoked vaporized or intravenous injection,

36:04.020 --> 36:07.900
 which all kind of, they're very similar pharmacologically,

36:07.900 --> 36:11.220
 of DMT and 5 methoxy DMT.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.260
 This is like when people, this is what,

36:13.260 --> 36:15.220
 I don't know if you're familiar with Terrence McKenna,

36:15.220 --> 36:16.780
 he would talk a lot about smoking DMT,

36:16.780 --> 36:19.780
 Joe Rogan has talked a lot about that.

36:19.780 --> 36:20.620
 People will say that,

36:20.620 --> 36:23.500
 and there's a close relative called 5 methoxy DMT.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.580
 Most people who know the terrain will say

36:25.580 --> 36:30.580
 that's an order of magnitude or orders of magnitude beyond,

36:30.820 --> 36:33.820
 I mean, anything one could get from even a high dose

36:33.820 --> 36:36.300
 of psilocybin or LSD.

36:36.300 --> 36:39.540
 I think it's a question about whether, you know,

36:39.540 --> 36:40.500
 how therapeutic,

36:40.500 --> 36:42.420
 I think there is a therapeutic potential there,

36:42.420 --> 36:45.300
 but it's probably not as sure of a bet

36:45.300 --> 36:47.780
 because one goes so far out,

36:47.780 --> 36:49.580
 it's almost like they're not contemplating

36:49.580 --> 36:51.820
 their relationship and their direction in life.

36:51.820 --> 36:55.660
 They are like reality is ripping apart at the seams

36:55.660 --> 37:00.660
 and the very nature of the self and of the sense of reality.

37:01.660 --> 37:04.940
 And the amazing thing about these compounds

37:04.940 --> 37:09.500
 and same to a less degree with oral psilocybin and LSD

37:09.500 --> 37:12.460
 is that unlike some other drugs

37:12.460 --> 37:14.820
 that really throw you far out there,

37:16.100 --> 37:18.820
 you know, anesthetics and even alcohol,

37:18.820 --> 37:21.740
 like as reality starts to become different

37:21.740 --> 37:24.820
 at higher and higher doses, there's this numbing,

37:24.820 --> 37:25.900
 there's this sort of,

37:26.980 --> 37:31.580
 there's this ability for the sense of being the center,

37:31.580 --> 37:35.180
 having a conscious experience that's memorable,

37:35.180 --> 37:37.380
 that is maintained

37:37.380 --> 37:40.140
 throughout these classic psychedelic experiences.

37:40.140 --> 37:44.700
 Like one can go as far, so far out while still

37:47.700 --> 37:50.540
 being aware of the experience

37:50.540 --> 37:52.180
 and remembering the experience.

37:52.180 --> 37:55.460
 Interesting, so being able to carry something back.

37:55.460 --> 37:56.700
 Right.

37:56.700 --> 38:01.340
 Can you dig in a little deeper, like what is DMT,

38:01.340 --> 38:03.980
 how long is the trip usually,

38:03.980 --> 38:06.340
 like how much do we understand about it?

38:06.340 --> 38:08.820
 Is there something interesting to say

38:09.820 --> 38:12.940
 about just the nature of the experience

38:12.940 --> 38:15.380
 and what we understand about it?

38:15.380 --> 38:17.660
 One of the common methods for people to use it

38:17.660 --> 38:19.820
 is to smoke it or vaporize it.

38:19.820 --> 38:21.700
 And it usually takes,

38:21.700 --> 38:23.420
 this is a pretty good kind of description

38:23.420 --> 38:25.420
 of what it might feel like on the ground.

38:26.580 --> 38:30.980
 The caveat is it's a completely insufficient description

38:30.980 --> 38:33.100
 that someone's gonna be listening to.

38:33.100 --> 38:36.100
 It's like nothing you could say is gonna come close.

38:36.100 --> 38:40.540
 But it'll take about three big hits, inhalations,

38:40.540 --> 38:43.300
 in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose.

38:45.980 --> 38:48.060
 And there's no great definition of that,

38:48.060 --> 38:52.580
 but basically meaning moving away from,

38:52.580 --> 38:56.220
 not just having the typical psilocybin or LSD experience

38:56.220 --> 38:58.300
 where like things are radically different,

38:58.300 --> 39:02.460
 but you're still basically a person in this reality

39:02.460 --> 39:03.860
 to go in somewhere else.

39:04.780 --> 39:07.660
 And so that'll typically take like three hits.

39:07.660 --> 39:10.580
 And this stuff comes on like a freight train.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.980
 So one takes a hit

39:11.980 --> 39:16.260
 and around the time of the first exhalation,

39:16.260 --> 39:18.300
 so we're talking about a few seconds in,

39:18.300 --> 39:22.380
 or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit,

39:22.380 --> 39:23.940
 like it'll start to come on.

39:23.940 --> 39:27.700
 And they're already up to, let's say,

39:27.700 --> 39:30.380
 what they might get from a 30 milligram

39:30.380 --> 39:34.500
 or 300 microgram LSD trip, a big trip.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.860
 They're already there at the second hit,

39:37.860 --> 39:39.980
 but their consciousness is geared,

39:39.980 --> 39:43.820
 this is like acceleration, not speed, to speak of physics.

39:43.820 --> 39:47.100
 It's like those receptors are getting filled like that

39:47.100 --> 39:50.820
 and they're going from zero to 60 in like Tesla time.

39:50.820 --> 39:54.180
 And at the second hit, again,

39:54.180 --> 39:57.300
 they're at maybe the strongest psychedelic experience

39:57.300 --> 39:58.620
 they've ever had.

39:58.620 --> 40:01.380
 And then if they can take that third hit,

40:01.380 --> 40:02.580
 and some people can't,

40:06.860 --> 40:10.820
 they're propelled into this other reality.

40:10.820 --> 40:14.060
 And the nature of that other reality will differ

40:14.060 --> 40:15.300
 depending on who you ask,

40:15.300 --> 40:18.180
 but folks will often talk about it.

40:18.180 --> 40:21.780
 And we've done some survey research on this.

40:21.780 --> 40:26.780
 Entities of different types, elves tend to pop up.

40:27.220 --> 40:29.780
 The caveat is that I strongly presume

40:29.780 --> 40:32.500
 all of this is culturally influenced,

40:32.500 --> 40:36.260
 but thinking more about the psychology and the neuroscience,

40:36.260 --> 40:38.620
 there is probably something fundamental,

40:38.620 --> 40:41.820
 like for someone that might be colored as elves,

40:41.820 --> 40:44.020
 others that might be colored as,

40:44.020 --> 40:46.860
 Terrence McKenna called them self dribbling basketballs.

40:46.860 --> 40:49.220
 For someone else, it might be little animals

40:49.220 --> 40:51.140
 or someone else, it might be aliens.

40:52.140 --> 40:55.020
 I think that probably is dependent on who they are

40:55.020 --> 40:56.060
 and what they've been exposed to.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.860
 But just the fact that one has this sense

40:58.860 --> 41:02.620
 that they're surrounded by autonomous entities.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.580
 Right, intelligent autonomous entities.

41:04.580 --> 41:06.500
 Right, and people come back with stories

41:06.500 --> 41:09.340
 that are just astonishing.

41:09.340 --> 41:12.580
 Like there's communication between these,

41:12.580 --> 41:15.220
 communication between these entities

41:15.220 --> 41:18.940
 and often they're telling them things

41:18.940 --> 41:23.780
 that the person says are self validating,

41:23.780 --> 41:25.900
 but it seems like it's impossible.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.180
 Like it really seems like, and again,

41:28.180 --> 41:31.060
 this is what people say oftentimes,

41:31.060 --> 41:35.740
 that it really is like downloading some intelligence

41:35.740 --> 41:39.020
 from a higher dimension or some whatever metaphor

41:39.020 --> 41:39.860
 you wanna use.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.540
 Sometimes these things come up in dreams

41:41.540 --> 41:43.660
 like someone is exposed to something that,

41:43.660 --> 41:45.740
 I've had this in a dream,

41:45.740 --> 41:48.620
 where it seems like what they are being exposed to

41:48.620 --> 41:51.700
 is physically impossible,

41:51.700 --> 41:56.020
 but yet at the same time self validating, it seems true.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.900
 Like they really are figuring something out.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.940
 Of course, the challenge is to say something

41:59.940 --> 42:03.540
 in concrete terms after the experience

42:03.540 --> 42:07.060
 where you could verify that in any way.

42:07.060 --> 42:10.980
 And I'm not familiar of any examples of that.

42:10.980 --> 42:15.220
 Well, there's a sense in which I suppose the experience

42:15.220 --> 42:20.220
 is like you're a limited cognitive creature

42:22.380 --> 42:24.300
 that knows very little about the world

42:24.300 --> 42:26.580
 and here's a chance to communicate

42:26.580 --> 42:30.700
 with much wiser entities that in a way

42:30.700 --> 42:32.260
 that you can't possibly understand

42:32.260 --> 42:37.260
 are trying to give you hints of deeper truths.

42:38.660 --> 42:40.540
 And so there's that kind of sense

42:40.540 --> 42:42.340
 that you can take something back,

42:42.340 --> 42:46.500
 but you can't where our cognition is not capable

42:46.500 --> 42:48.420
 to fully grasp the truth.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.540
 We'll just get a kind of sense of it

42:50.540 --> 42:53.920
 and somehow that process is mind expanding

42:53.920 --> 42:56.820
 that there's a greater truth out there.

42:56.820 --> 42:59.540
 That seems like what from the people

42:59.540 --> 43:04.140
 I've heard talk about that seems to be what it is.

43:04.140 --> 43:08.320
 And that's so fascinating that there's fundamentally

43:08.320 --> 43:09.980
 to this whole thing is a communication

43:09.980 --> 43:14.980
 between an entity that is other than yourself, entities.

43:15.460 --> 43:17.820
 So it's not just like a visual experience

43:17.820 --> 43:21.100
 like you're like floating through the world

43:21.100 --> 43:23.380
 is there's other beings there,

43:23.380 --> 43:26.020
 which is kind of, I don't know.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.980
 I don't know what to sort of,

43:27.980 --> 43:30.700
 from a person who likes Freud and Carl Jung,

43:30.700 --> 43:32.180
 I don't know what to think about that.

43:32.180 --> 43:34.440
 That being of course from one perspective

43:34.440 --> 43:36.680
 is just you looking in the mirror.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.100
 But it could also be from another perspective

43:39.100 --> 43:41.900
 like actually talking to other beings.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.260
 Yeah, you mentioned Jung

43:43.260 --> 43:45.660
 and I think he's particularly interesting

43:45.660 --> 43:47.260
 and it kind of points to something

43:47.260 --> 43:50.500
 I was thinking about saying is that,

43:50.500 --> 43:52.500
 I think what might be going on

43:52.500 --> 43:55.040
 from a naturalistic perspective.

43:55.040 --> 43:58.660
 So regardless, whether or not there are,

43:58.660 --> 44:01.660
 it doesn't depend on autonomous entities out there.

44:01.660 --> 44:06.660
 What might be happening is that just the associative net,

44:06.660 --> 44:08.980
 the level of learning,

44:08.980 --> 44:13.980
 the comprehension might be so beyond what someone is used to

44:17.180 --> 44:20.620
 that the only way for the nervous system,

44:20.620 --> 44:25.620
 for the aware sense of self to orient towards it

44:25.780 --> 44:27.500
 is all by metaphor.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.020
 And so I do think,

44:29.020 --> 44:33.220
 when we get into these realms as a strong empiricist,

44:33.220 --> 44:34.900
 I think we always gotta be careful

44:34.900 --> 44:36.700
 and be as grounded as possible,

44:36.700 --> 44:39.260
 but I'm also willing to speculate

44:39.260 --> 44:42.380
 and sort of cast the nets wide with caveat.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.620
 But I think of things like archetypes

44:44.620 --> 44:48.900
 and it's plausible that there are certain stories,

44:48.900 --> 44:49.740
 there are certain,

44:49.740 --> 44:52.980
 we've gone through millions of years of evolution.

44:52.980 --> 44:57.980
 It may be that we have certain characters and stories

44:58.140 --> 45:03.140
 that our central nervous system is sort of wired

45:03.140 --> 45:05.020
 to tend to.

45:05.020 --> 45:07.740
 Yeah, those stories, we carry those stories in us.

45:07.740 --> 45:08.580
 Right.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.460
 And this unlocks them in a certain kind of way.

45:10.460 --> 45:11.900
 And we think about stories.

45:11.900 --> 45:13.420
 Like our sense of self is basically,

45:13.420 --> 45:15.060
 narrative self is a story.

45:15.060 --> 45:18.700
 And we think about the world of stories.

45:18.700 --> 45:20.660
 This is why metaphors are always more powerful

45:20.660 --> 45:25.480
 than sort of laying out all the details all the time,

45:25.480 --> 45:26.700
 speaking in parables.

45:26.700 --> 45:28.460
 It's like, if you really get some,

45:28.460 --> 45:31.100
 this is why, as much as I hate it,

45:31.100 --> 45:33.340
 if you're presenting to Congress or something

45:33.340 --> 45:36.780
 and you have all the best data in the world,

45:36.780 --> 45:39.220
 it's not as powerful as that one anecdote

45:39.220 --> 45:44.220
 as the mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session

45:44.580 --> 45:46.540
 and it transformed her life.

45:46.540 --> 45:48.520
 That's a story, that's meaningful.

45:48.520 --> 45:53.260
 And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change

45:53.260 --> 45:58.260
 and experience happens with a DMT ingestion,

45:58.260 --> 46:03.260
 these stories of entities, they might be that,

46:04.740 --> 46:08.320
 stories that are constructed that is the closest,

46:08.320 --> 46:09.980
 which is not to say the stories aren't real.

46:09.980 --> 46:12.660
 I mean, I think we're getting to layers where

46:12.660 --> 46:14.660
 it doesn't really, right.

46:14.660 --> 46:17.880
 Yeah, but it's the closest we can come

46:17.880 --> 46:19.100
 to making sense out of it.

46:19.100 --> 46:22.260
 Because what we do know about these psychedelics,

46:22.260 --> 46:24.060
 one of the levels beyond the receptor

46:24.060 --> 46:26.380
 is that the brain is communicating it with itself

46:26.380 --> 46:28.420
 in a massively different way.

46:28.420 --> 46:30.460
 There's massive communication with areas

46:30.460 --> 46:32.580
 that don't normally communicate.

46:32.580 --> 46:36.900
 And so I think that comes with both,

46:36.900 --> 46:38.620
 it's casting the nets wide.

46:38.620 --> 46:41.020
 I think that comes with the insights

46:41.020 --> 46:42.760
 and helpful novel ways of thinking.

46:42.760 --> 46:45.300
 I do think it comes with false positives,

46:45.300 --> 46:47.120
 that could be some of the delusion.

46:48.680 --> 46:52.200
 And so when you're so far out there,

46:52.200 --> 46:53.740
 like with the DMT experience,

46:53.740 --> 46:58.660
 like maybe alien is the best way

46:58.660 --> 47:02.500
 that the mind can wrap some arms around that.

47:02.500 --> 47:05.660
 So I don't know how much you're familiar with Joe Rogan,

47:05.660 --> 47:08.340
 but he does bring up DMT quite a bit.

47:08.340 --> 47:11.160
 It's almost a meme, it is a meme.

47:11.160 --> 47:14.020
 Have you ever, what is it, have you ever tried DMT?

47:16.260 --> 47:18.620
 I mean, I think he talks about this experience

47:18.620 --> 47:22.340
 of having met other entities

47:22.340 --> 47:26.540
 and they were mocking him, I think,

47:26.540 --> 47:28.680
 if I remember the experience correctly,

47:28.680 --> 47:31.180
 like laughing at him and saying F you, F you,

47:31.180 --> 47:32.740
 or something like that.

47:32.740 --> 47:34.300
 I may be misremembering this,

47:34.300 --> 47:37.260
 but there's a general mockery.

47:37.260 --> 47:40.260
 And what he learned from that experience

47:40.260 --> 47:42.600
 is that he shouldn't take himself too seriously.

47:42.600 --> 47:45.440
 So it's the dissolution of the ego and so on.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.820
 Like what do you think about that experience?

47:48.820 --> 47:50.620
 And maybe if you have more general things

47:50.620 --> 47:54.620
 about Joe's infatuation with DMT

47:54.620 --> 47:58.700
 and if DMT has that important role to play

47:58.700 --> 48:01.980
 in popular culture in general.

48:01.980 --> 48:03.420
 I'm definitely familiar with it.

48:03.420 --> 48:04.980
 I remember telling you offline

48:04.980 --> 48:07.780
 that when I first, the first time I learned

48:07.780 --> 48:11.460
 who Joe Rogan was, it was probably 15 years ago.

48:11.460 --> 48:14.180
 And I came upon a clip and I realized

48:14.180 --> 48:15.780
 there's another person in the world

48:15.780 --> 48:19.020
 who's into both DMT and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

48:19.020 --> 48:22.220
 And I think both those worlds have grown dramatically since

48:22.220 --> 48:24.440
 and it's probably not such a special club these days.

48:24.440 --> 48:29.020
 So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly.

48:29.020 --> 48:31.980
 You were into both before it was cool.

48:31.980 --> 48:33.820
 Right, I mean, this is all relative

48:33.820 --> 48:36.500
 because there's people that were before the late 90s

48:36.500 --> 48:37.820
 and early 2000s who were into it

48:37.820 --> 48:39.400
 to say you're a Johnny come lately.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.460
 But yeah, compared to where we're at now.

48:42.460 --> 48:44.940
 But yet one of the things I always found fascinating

48:44.940 --> 48:49.940
 by Joe's telling of his experiences I think

48:52.020 --> 48:54.500
 is that they resemble very much

48:54.500 --> 48:57.860
 Terrence McKenna's experiences with DMT

48:57.860 --> 49:01.020
 and Joe has talked very much about Terrence McKenna

49:01.020 --> 49:03.260
 and his experiences.

49:03.260 --> 49:04.660
 If I had to guess, I would guess

49:04.660 --> 49:08.540
 that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna

49:08.540 --> 49:13.020
 talk about his experiences that that influenced

49:13.020 --> 49:15.660
 the coloring of Joe's experience.

49:15.660 --> 49:17.220
 It's funny how that works

49:17.220 --> 49:19.980
 because I mean, that's why McKenna hasn't,

49:19.980 --> 49:24.980
 I mean, poets and great orators give us the words

49:25.020 --> 49:27.540
 to then like start to describe our experiences

49:27.540 --> 49:30.620
 because our words are limited, our language is limited.

49:30.620 --> 49:33.220
 And it's always nice to get some kind of nice poetry

49:33.220 --> 49:36.360
 into the mix to allow us to put words to it.

49:36.360 --> 49:40.060
 Right, but I also see some elements

49:40.060 --> 49:43.180
 that seem to relate to Joe's psychology

49:43.180 --> 49:46.220
 just from what I've seen from hours

49:46.220 --> 49:47.880
 of watching him on his podcast

49:47.880 --> 49:52.340
 is that he's a self critical guy.

49:52.340 --> 49:54.100
 And I think with always his positive been,

49:54.100 --> 49:56.900
 I'm always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist

49:56.900 --> 49:59.180
 and no one else really says it about cannabis.

49:59.180 --> 50:00.780
 I'll get back to the DMT thing about

50:00.780 --> 50:03.300
 he likes the kind of the paranoid side of things.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.820
 He's like, that's you radically examining yourself.

50:05.820 --> 50:07.540
 It's like, that's not just a bad thing.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.940
 That's you need to like look hard at yourself

50:09.940 --> 50:11.780
 and something's making you uncomfortable,

50:11.780 --> 50:13.060
 like dig into that.

50:13.060 --> 50:14.180
 And like, that's his,

50:14.180 --> 50:16.860
 it's sort of along the lines of Goggins with exercise.

50:16.860 --> 50:19.100
 And it's like, yeah, like things,

50:19.100 --> 50:21.620
 learning experiences aren't supposed to be easy.

50:21.620 --> 50:24.780
 Like take advantage of these uncomfortable experience.

50:24.780 --> 50:26.620
 It's why we call in our research

50:26.620 --> 50:28.700
 in a safe context with psychedelics,

50:28.700 --> 50:32.220
 they're not bad trips, they're challenging experiences.

50:32.220 --> 50:33.820
 Yes, yeah, that's fascinating.

50:33.820 --> 50:35.980
 Just that's the tiny tangent.

50:35.980 --> 50:40.780
 It's always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana,

50:40.780 --> 50:44.540
 like weed as the paranoia, the anxiety or whatever

50:44.540 --> 50:49.540
 that you experience as actually the fuel for the experience.

50:50.580 --> 50:54.420
 Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he's writing.

50:54.420 --> 50:56.220
 That's inspiring to me because

50:56.220 --> 50:59.460
 then you can't possibly have a bad experience.

50:59.460 --> 51:00.500
 I'm a huge fan of that.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.420
 Like every experience is good.

51:03.380 --> 51:04.780
 Right, which is very Goggins.

51:04.780 --> 51:06.540
 Yeah, yeah, is it bad?

51:06.540 --> 51:08.300
 Okay, all right, great, you know.

51:08.300 --> 51:09.980
 Well, see Goggins is one side of that.

51:09.980 --> 51:11.740
 He wants it bad.

51:11.740 --> 51:14.860
 Like he wants the experience to be challenging always.

51:14.860 --> 51:17.500
 But I mean like both are good.

51:17.500 --> 51:21.700
 Like the few times of taking mushrooms,

51:21.700 --> 51:26.340
 the experience was like everything was beautiful.

51:26.340 --> 51:29.900
 There's zero challenging aspect to it.

51:29.900 --> 51:32.020
 It was just like the world is beautiful

51:32.020 --> 51:35.020
 and it gave me this deep appreciation of the world.

51:35.020 --> 51:37.740
 I would say, so like that's amazing,

51:37.740 --> 51:41.180
 but also ones that challenge you are also amazing.

51:41.180 --> 51:42.580
 Like all the times I drink vodka,

51:42.580 --> 51:45.900
 but that's another, let's not.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.340
 So back to DMT.

51:48.260 --> 51:52.180
 Yeah, Joe's treating cannabis as a psychedelic,

51:52.180 --> 51:54.820
 which is something that I'd say like a lot of people

51:54.820 --> 51:59.820
 treat it more like Xanax or like beer or vodka.

51:59.820 --> 52:03.940
 But he's really trying to delve into those minor,

52:03.940 --> 52:05.260
 it's been called a minor psychedelic.

52:05.260 --> 52:07.740
 So with DMT, as you brought up,

52:07.740 --> 52:10.220
 it's like the entity's mocking him.

52:10.220 --> 52:13.580
 And it's like, you're not, I mean, this reminds me of him,

52:13.580 --> 52:16.780
 him describing his, like writing his,

52:16.780 --> 52:20.940
 or just his entire method of comedy.

52:20.940 --> 52:23.540
 It's like, watch the tape of yourself.

52:23.540 --> 52:24.580
 Don't just ignore it.

52:24.580 --> 52:26.740
 Like that's where I screwed up.

52:26.740 --> 52:28.020
 That's where I need to do better.

52:28.020 --> 52:31.180
 This like sort of radical self examination,

52:31.180 --> 52:33.460
 which I think our society is kind of getting away from

52:33.460 --> 52:36.580
 because like, all the children win trophies type of thing.

52:36.580 --> 52:39.140
 And it's like, no, no, don't go overboard,

52:39.140 --> 52:41.740
 but like recognize when you've messed up.

52:41.740 --> 52:45.260
 And so that's a big part of the psychedelic experience.

52:45.260 --> 52:48.340
 Like people come out sometimes saying,

52:48.340 --> 52:50.540
 my God, I need to say sorry to my mom.

52:52.380 --> 52:57.380
 It's so obvious, or whatever interpersonal issue

52:57.380 --> 53:00.420
 or like, my God, I'm not pulling enough weight

53:00.420 --> 53:02.780
 around the house and helping my wife.

53:02.780 --> 53:07.160
 And these things that are just obvious to them,

53:07.160 --> 53:09.820
 the self criticism that can be a very positive thing

53:09.820 --> 53:10.860
 if you act on it.

53:12.020 --> 53:13.580
 You've mentioned addiction.

53:13.580 --> 53:15.380
 Maybe we could take a little bit detour

53:15.380 --> 53:18.180
 into a darker aspect of things,

53:18.180 --> 53:22.260
 or not even darker, it's just an important aspect of things.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.740
 What's the nature of addiction?

53:24.740 --> 53:28.980
 You've mentioned some things within the big umbrella

53:28.980 --> 53:32.580
 of psychedelics may be usually not addictive,

53:32.580 --> 53:35.140
 but maybe MDMA, I think you said

53:35.140 --> 53:37.180
 might have some addictive properties,

53:37.180 --> 53:41.060
 but the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella

53:41.060 --> 53:43.940
 can often be highly addictive.

53:43.940 --> 53:47.360
 So you've studied addiction from several angles,

53:47.360 --> 53:49.820
 one of which is behavioral economics.

53:49.820 --> 53:53.700
 What have you understood about addiction?

53:53.700 --> 53:57.980
 What is addiction from the biological physiological level

53:57.980 --> 54:00.860
 to the psychological to whatever is the interesting way

54:00.860 --> 54:02.560
 to talk about addiction?

54:02.560 --> 54:05.680
 Yeah, and the lenses that I view addiction through

54:05.680 --> 54:08.700
 very much are behavioral economic,

54:08.700 --> 54:11.420
 but I also think they converge on,

54:11.420 --> 54:13.500
 I think it's beautiful at the other end of the spectrum,

54:13.500 --> 54:18.500
 sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective.

54:20.420 --> 54:22.780
 It converges on what people come out of,

54:22.780 --> 54:24.740
 12 step meetings talking about.

54:24.740 --> 54:27.340
 Can you say what is behavioral economics

54:27.340 --> 54:30.020
 and what is humanistic psychology?

54:30.020 --> 54:31.060
 Like, what do you mean by that?

54:31.060 --> 54:33.820
 And more importantly, behavioral economics lens,

54:33.820 --> 54:34.660
 what is that?

54:34.660 --> 54:36.140
 Yeah, so behavioral economics,

54:36.140 --> 54:38.260
 my definition of it is the application

54:38.260 --> 54:41.600
 of economic principles, mostly microeconomic principles.

54:41.600 --> 54:46.600
 So understanding the behavior of individual agents

54:47.840 --> 54:51.520
 surrounding commodities in the marketplace,

54:51.520 --> 54:55.500
 applying microeconomic types of analyses

54:56.380 --> 54:59.900
 to non economic behavior.

54:59.900 --> 55:01.660
 So basically at one point,

55:01.660 --> 55:03.460
 like psychologists figured out

55:03.460 --> 55:05.540
 that there's this whole other discipline

55:05.540 --> 55:06.780
 that's been studying behavior,

55:06.780 --> 55:09.540
 it just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior,

55:09.540 --> 55:12.400
 spending and saving money, et cetera.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.540
 But it comes with all of these like principles

55:14.540 --> 55:17.700
 that can be wildly and fruitfully applied

55:17.700 --> 55:18.940
 to understanding behavior.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.500
 So for example, I've studied things like

55:22.660 --> 55:25.020
 demand curve analysis of drug consumption.

55:25.020 --> 55:30.020
 So I look at, for example, tobacco, cigarettes

55:30.440 --> 55:35.340
 and nicotine products through the lens of demand curves.

55:35.340 --> 55:38.340
 And in other words, at different prices,

55:38.340 --> 55:40.660
 if there's different work requirements

55:40.660 --> 55:45.660
 for being able to smoke cigarettes, sort of modeling price.

55:45.900 --> 55:47.120
 Within that price data,

55:47.120 --> 55:49.500
 there is some indication of addiction,

55:49.500 --> 55:52.100
 how much the habits that you form

55:52.100 --> 55:54.600
 around these particular drugs.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.380
 It's one important dimension.

55:56.380 --> 55:58.100
 So I think a particularly important one there

55:58.100 --> 56:02.660
 is elasticity or inelasticity, two ends of the spectrum.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.340
 So that's the price sensitivity.

56:05.340 --> 56:07.740
 So for example, you could have something

56:07.740 --> 56:12.740
 that's pretty price inelastic, like gasoline.

56:14.660 --> 56:16.940
 So the price of gas at times can keep going up

56:16.940 --> 56:20.500
 and Americans are just gonna pretty much

56:20.500 --> 56:21.540
 buy the same amount of gas.

56:21.540 --> 56:24.100
 Or maybe the price of gas doubles,

56:24.100 --> 56:26.260
 but their consumption only decreases by 10%.

56:26.260 --> 56:28.640
 So it's a sub proportional reduction.

56:28.640 --> 56:30.500
 So that's an inelastic.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.240
 And that changes, like you push the price up high enough.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.900
 I mean, if it was $100 a gallon, it would eventually turn,

56:35.900 --> 56:39.780
 the curve would turn and go downward more drastically

56:39.780 --> 56:41.420
 and it would be elastic.

56:41.420 --> 56:45.100
 But you can apply that to someone who,

56:45.100 --> 56:49.340
 a regular cigarette smoker who was working

56:49.340 --> 56:52.620
 for cigarette puffs, who's gone six hours without smoking.

56:52.620 --> 56:54.700
 And you're asking questions like,

56:54.700 --> 56:57.620
 how many times are they willing to pull this knob

56:57.620 --> 56:59.300
 in the lab during this three hour session?

56:59.300 --> 57:02.420
 I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette.

57:02.420 --> 57:05.400
 How does the content of nicotine in that affect?

57:05.400 --> 57:08.360
 It has the availability of nicotine replacement products

57:08.360 --> 57:12.460
 like nicotine gum or eCigarettes affect those decisions.

57:12.460 --> 57:15.540
 So it's a certain lens of, it's sort of a way to take

57:15.540 --> 57:19.700
 the kind of the classic behavioral psychology definition

57:19.700 --> 57:24.260
 of reinforcement, which is just basically reward.

57:24.260 --> 57:25.480
 How much is this a good thing?

57:25.480 --> 57:26.860
 And it kind of breaks that apart

57:26.860 --> 57:31.040
 into a multi dimensional space.

57:31.040 --> 57:34.560
 So it's not just the ideas reward or reinforcement

57:34.560 --> 57:36.160
 is not unit dimensional.

57:36.160 --> 57:39.540
 So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves.

57:39.540 --> 57:44.160
 At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another.

57:44.160 --> 57:47.020
 So the classic example is luxury versus necessity.

57:47.020 --> 57:49.540
 So diamonds versus toilet paper.

57:49.540 --> 57:51.420
 So at those cheap prices,

57:51.420 --> 57:54.100
 you can look at something called intensity of demand.

57:54.100 --> 57:56.220
 If it was basically as cheap as possible,

57:56.220 --> 57:59.940
 or essentially zero, how much would you buy of this good?

57:59.940 --> 58:02.800
 But then you keep jacking up the price and you'll see,

58:02.800 --> 58:06.240
 so diamonds will look like the better reward

58:06.240 --> 58:09.960
 at that low price sort of intensity of demand side of things.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.420
 But as you keep jacking up the price,

58:11.420 --> 58:13.260
 you gotta have some toilet paper.

58:13.260 --> 58:15.700
 And again, we can get into the whole bidet thing,

58:15.700 --> 58:19.500
 but forget that, I know Joe's been pushing that too.

58:21.100 --> 58:23.980
 You're gonna hang on and keep buying the toilet paper

58:23.980 --> 58:26.660
 to a greater degree than you will the diamonds.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.900
 So you'll see a crossing of demand curves.

58:28.900 --> 58:30.860
 So what's the better reinforcer?

58:30.860 --> 58:31.820
 What's the better reward?

58:31.820 --> 58:33.620
 Depends on your price.

58:33.620 --> 58:38.620
 And so that's an example of one way to look at addiction.

58:39.500 --> 58:41.880
 So specifically drug consumption,

58:41.880 --> 58:43.500
 which isn't all of addiction,

58:43.500 --> 58:46.500
 but it's like in order for something to be addictive,

58:46.500 --> 58:48.860
 it has to be a reward.

58:48.860 --> 58:53.860
 And it has to compete with other rewards in your life.

58:54.300 --> 58:59.220
 And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my view,

58:59.220 --> 59:01.700
 and this doesn't map onto how the DSM,

59:01.700 --> 59:04.540
 the psychiatry Bible defines addiction,

59:04.540 --> 59:06.460
 which I think is largely bunk,

59:06.460 --> 59:08.800
 but there's some value to have some common description,

59:08.800 --> 59:12.100
 but it's how rewarding is it

59:12.100 --> 59:15.260
 from this multi dimensional lens?

59:15.260 --> 59:19.820
 And specifically, how does that rewarding value compete

59:19.820 --> 59:24.820
 with other rewards, other consequences in your life?

59:25.140 --> 59:30.140
 So it's not a problem if the use of that substance

59:30.140 --> 59:32.340
 is rewarding.

59:32.340 --> 59:33.980
 Okay, yeah, you like to have a couple of beers

59:33.980 --> 59:36.580
 every once in a while, and it's like not a problem.

59:38.140 --> 59:42.720
 But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much

59:42.720 --> 59:47.660
 that it tanks their career, it ruins their marriage.

59:47.660 --> 59:51.520
 It's in competition with these pro social aspects

59:51.520 --> 59:52.360
 to their life.

59:52.360 --> 59:55.820
 It's all about comparing to the other choices you're making,

59:55.820 --> 59:57.820
 the other activities in your life.

59:57.820 --> 1:00:01.340
 And if you evaluate it as a much higher reward

1:00:02.860 --> 1:00:05.380
 than anything else, that becomes an addiction.

1:00:05.380 --> 1:00:06.220
 Right, right.

1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:08.260
 And so it's not just the rewarding value,

1:00:08.260 --> 1:00:10.020
 but it's the relative rewarding value.

1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:13.780
 And the other major aspect, again, from behavioral economics,

1:00:13.780 --> 1:00:16.420
 that the thing that makes addiction

1:00:16.420 --> 1:00:20.380
 is something called delayed discounting.

1:00:20.380 --> 1:00:23.460
 So in economics, sometimes it's called time preference.

1:00:23.460 --> 1:00:26.820
 It's what compound interest rates are based upon.

1:00:26.820 --> 1:00:30.500
 It's the idea that delaying a good access to a good

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:35.180
 or a reward comes with a certain decrement to its value.

1:00:35.180 --> 1:00:37.760
 So we'd all rather have things now than later.

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:42.140
 And we can study this at the individual level of,

1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:47.140
 would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow?

1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:52.780
 And when you do that, you get huge differences

1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:56.420
 between addicted populations and non addicted,

1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:59.420
 not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers,

1:00:59.420 --> 1:01:02.100
 like normal everyday cigarette smokers.

1:01:02.100 --> 1:01:06.380
 And even when you look at something like monetary rewards.

1:01:06.380 --> 1:01:08.340
 And so you can go into the rabbit hole

1:01:08.340 --> 1:01:10.640
 with this delayed discounting model.

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:12.340
 So it's not only those huge differences

1:01:12.340 --> 1:01:15.260
 that seem to have a face valid aspect to it.

1:01:15.260 --> 1:01:17.460
 Like the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing

1:01:17.460 --> 1:01:19.460
 that's rewarding today,

1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:21.360
 but I know it comes with increased risk

1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:24.020
 of having these horrible consequences down the line.

1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:26.420
 So it's this competition between what's good for me now

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:28.460
 and what's good for me later.

1:01:28.460 --> 1:01:30.500
 And the other aspect about delayed discounting

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.620
 is that if you quantitatively map out

1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:37.220
 that discounting curve over time,

1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:42.220
 so you don't just do that $10 tomorrow,

1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:45.180
 how much is it worth to you today?

1:01:45.180 --> 1:01:46.420
 So you can say, what about nine?

1:01:46.420 --> 1:01:47.260
 What about eight?

1:01:47.260 --> 1:01:48.180
 What about $7?

1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:51.020
 And you can titrate it to find that indifference point.

1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:56.020
 And so we can say, aha, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 today.

1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:00.980
 So it's by the one day it's decreased by 40%.

1:02:00.980 --> 1:02:04.140
 We can do that also at one week and one month

1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:08.400
 and one year and 10 years and map out that curve,

1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:09.620
 get a shape of that curve.

1:02:09.620 --> 1:02:11.420
 And one of the fascinating things about this

1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:13.620
 is that whether you're talking about pigeons,

1:02:13.620 --> 1:02:14.860
 making these types of choices

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:16.220
 between a little bit of food now

1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:18.660
 or a little bit of food a minute from now or rats,

1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.580
 or like dozens of species of animals tested,

1:02:21.580 --> 1:02:22.940
 including humans,

1:02:22.940 --> 1:02:24.820
 the tendency is pretty consistently

1:02:24.820 --> 1:02:29.820
 that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially.

1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:34.520
 And what exponentially means is that every unit of time

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:37.540
 is associated with the same proportional reduction.

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:40.220
 Every unit of delay is associated with the same,

1:02:40.220 --> 1:02:42.860
 causes the same proportional reduction in value.

1:02:42.860 --> 1:02:47.000
 And that's the way the compound interest rate works.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000
 Every day you get this sort of out of whatever values

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:54.780
 in there at the beginning of that day,

1:02:54.780 --> 1:02:58.560
 you get this, we'll give you this amount of extra money

1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:01.340
 to compensate you for that delay.

1:03:01.340 --> 1:03:05.520
 But then the way that all animals tend to function

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:09.480
 is of this very different way where the reductions,

1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:11.880
 the initial, that initial delay,

1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.680
 so like one day's worth of delay,

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:16.600
 you see a much stronger discounting rate

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:20.440
 or reduction in value than you do over those.

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:22.040
 So you see the super proportional,

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:26.200
 then it changes to these lesser rates.

1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:27.480
 And so the implication of that,

1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:29.760
 I know I've gone like really into the weeds quantitatively,

1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:31.160
 but what that means is that

1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:34.280
 there's these preference reversals.

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.460
 When you have curves of that nature,

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:40.600
 the decay that's hyperbolic,

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.600
 it maps onto this phenomenon we see

1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:49.720
 both in terms of how people deal with future rewards,

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:51.780
 but also how perception works.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:54.200
 When two things are far away,

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.320
 whether it's physical distance

1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:57.760
 or whether in terms of perception

1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.840
 or whether it's in terms of time,

1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:01.860
 when you're really far away,

1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:05.680
 the value, the subjective value for that further,

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:08.960
 that delayed reward is larger.

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.240
 So for example, like,

1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.880
 let's say we're talking about 360,

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:20.080
 364 days from now, you can get $9 or 365 days a year.

1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:23.600
 Now you get $10 and you're like,

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.780
 dude, it's like, it's a year, like no difference.

1:04:25.780 --> 1:04:29.040
 Like I'll take, why not get one more dollar?

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:31.500
 You bring that same exact set of choices closer.

1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:34.400
 Nothing's changed other than the time to both rewards.

1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:37.480
 And it's like, would you rather have $9 today

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:39.760
 or $10 tomorrow and plenty of people would say,

1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:43.160
 eh, just about the same, let's go ahead and take it today.

1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:45.000
 So you see this preference reversal.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000
 And so that's a model of addiction

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:55.000
 in the sense that consistently with true addiction,

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.160
 I would argue, you see this competition

1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:01.680
 between molar and molecular utility.

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:05.400
 It's like interpersonal,

1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:07.920
 like within the person competing agents.

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.340
 Someone sometimes has control of the bus

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:14.400
 that wants to do what's good for you in the short term.

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:18.200
 And someone at other times is in control of driving the bus

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:22.480
 and they want to do what's good for you in the long term.

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:25.240
 So you tell the, you're trying to quit

1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:28.360
 and you see a doctor, you see your 12 step therapist

1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:30.880
 and say, God, I know this stuff is killing me.

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:35.560
 Like, I'm really, I'm on the path, like I'm done.

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.080
 And that's when you're kind of in their office

1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:39.200
 or wherever you're not, it's not around you.

1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:41.320
 And then later on that day, your buddy says that,

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:42.640
 hey man, I just scored.

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:43.480
 I got it right here.

1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:44.320
 Do you want it?

1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:45.480
 And that reward is right in front of you.

1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:48.200
 That's like bringing those two choices right in front of you.

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:50.520
 And it's like, hell yeah, I want to use.

1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.840
 And then you can go through that cycle for like years

1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:56.400
 of the person telling themselves, I want to quit.

1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:58.800
 But then other times that same person is saying,

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:01.080
 I don't want to, you know, functionally,

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:01.920
 they're saying, I don't want to,

1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:04.200
 because they're saying, yeah, like, yeah, give me some.

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:07.160
 So in the moment, it's very difficult to quit.

1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:08.400
 And this isn't just something,

1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:11.080
 this is something that has huge clinical ramifications

1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:13.400
 with addiction, but it's like all humans do it.

1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.680
 Anyone who's hit the snooze alarm in the morning,

1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:17.720
 like the night before they realize,

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.560
 oh, I got to get up extra early tomorrow.

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:21.320
 That's what's ultimately better for me.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:24.000
 So I'm going to set the alarm for, you know, 5 a.m.

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:29.000
 And it goes off at 5 a.m., you know,

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:34.680
 and then, so now those two consequences have come sooner

1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:35.960
 and it's like, what the hell?

1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:37.360
 And they hit the snooze alarm.

1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:38.400
 And sometimes not just once,

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:41.200
 but then five minutes later and five minutes later,

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.440
 you know, and so, and it's why it's easier

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:46.880
 to exercise self control at the grocery store

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.680
 compared to in your fridge.

1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:53.680
 Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge,

1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:58.080
 you're going to more likely yield to temptation

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:01.000
 than if it is further away.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.520
 So then just take a step back to something

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:07.020
 you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing.

1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:12.120
 Is it from a perspective of the dealers,

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.480
 whether we're talking about cigarettes

1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:19.480
 or maybe venturing slightly into the illegal realm,

1:07:20.300 --> 1:07:23.120
 you know, of people who sell drugs illegally,

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:25.520
 they also have an economics to them

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.060
 that they set prices and all those kinds of things.

1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:34.080
 Does addiction allow you to mess with the nature of pricing?

1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.480
 Like, so I kind of assume that you meant

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:42.360
 that there's a correlation between things you're addicted to

1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:44.640
 and the inelasticity of the price.

1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.720
 So you can jack up the price.

1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.040
 Is there something interesting to be said

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:52.920
 both for legal drugs and illegal drugs

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:57.920
 about the kind of price games you can play

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:03.920
 because the consumers of the product are addicted?

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:06.260
 Right, I mean, I think you just described it.

1:08:06.260 --> 1:08:07.760
 Yeah, you can jack up the price

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:10.880
 and you know, some people are going to drop off,

1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.560
 but the people, you know, and it's not dichotomous

1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:15.280
 because you could just consume less,

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:16.920
 but some people are going to consume less

1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:19.920
 and the people that are most addicted are going to keep,

1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:21.840
 you know, I mean, you see this,

1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:23.440
 they're going to keep purchasing.

1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:24.620
 So you see this with cigarettes.

1:08:24.620 --> 1:08:28.080
 And so it's interesting when you interface this with policy,

1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:31.280
 like in one respect, heavily taxing cigarettes

1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:32.120
 is a good thing.

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.060
 We know it keeps adolescents particularly price sensitive.

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:38.800
 So you definitely, people smoke less

1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:41.140
 and especially kids smoke less when you keep

1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:44.240
 cigarette prices high and you tax the hell out of them.

1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:46.760
 But one of the downsides you've got to balance

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:49.980
 and keep in mind is that you disproportionately

1:08:49.980 --> 1:08:52.820
 have working class, poor people.

1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:54.960
 And then you get into a point where someone's spending,

1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.600
 you know, a quarter of their paycheck on cigarettes.

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:58.640
 So they're going to smoke no matter what.

1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:01.040
 And basically because they're addicted,

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:02.080
 they're going to smoke no matter what.

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.360
 And you're just, yeah, you're taxing their existence.

1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:08.200
 Right, so you're making it worse for them.

1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:10.540
 If they don't, if they are completely inelastic,

1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:12.800
 you're actually making that person's life worse.

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:16.180
 Because we know that by interfering with the amount

1:09:16.180 --> 1:09:19.640
 of money they have, you're interfering with the other

1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:23.920
 pro social, the potential competitors to smoking, you know.

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:26.560
 And we know that when someone's in more impoverished

1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:31.280
 environments and they have less sort of non drug alternatives,

1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:34.120
 you know, the more likely they're going to stay addicted.

1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:35.760
 So, you know.

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.900
 Is there data, this is interesting,

1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:42.760
 from a scientific perspective of those same kind of games

1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:44.520
 in illegal drugs?

1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:50.000
 Sort of, because that's where most drug,

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.180
 I was, I mean, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,

1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:56.360
 but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal.

1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:00.240
 And so, but there's still an economics to them, obviously.

1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:01.800
 That's the drug war and so on.

1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:05.200
 Is there data on the setting of prices

1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:08.520
 or like how good are the business people running

1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:11.280
 the selling of drugs that are illegal?

1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:13.440
 Are they all the same kind of rules apply

1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:15.820
 from a behavioral economics perspective?

1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:16.660
 I think so.

1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:18.900
 I mean, they're basically, whether they're crunching

1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:21.120
 the numbers or not, they're basically sensitive

1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:24.480
 to that demand curve and they're doing the same thing

1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:27.120
 that businesses do in a legal market.

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:30.640
 And, you know, you want to sell as much of a product

1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:32.420
 to get as much money.

1:10:32.420 --> 1:10:33.840
 You're looking more at the total income.

1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:36.480
 So if you jack the price a little bit,

1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:38.840
 you're going to get some reduction in consumption,

1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:40.800
 but it may be that the total amount of money

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.400
 that you rake in is going to be more than,

1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.360
 it's going to overcompensate for that.

1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:47.240
 So you're willing to take,

1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.220
 okay, I'm going to lose 10% of my customers,

1:10:49.220 --> 1:10:52.600
 but I'm getting more than enough to compensate

1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:53.920
 from that, from the extra money

1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:55.740
 from the people who still are buying.

1:10:55.740 --> 1:10:57.080
 So I think they're more, you know,

1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:58.440
 and especially when we get to the lower,

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.520
 I wouldn't be surprised if people are crunching those numbers

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:03.960
 and looking at demand curves, maybe at the, you know,

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.040
 at the really high levels of the, you know,

1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:07.920
 up the chain with the cartels and whatnot.

1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:10.300
 I don't know, that wouldn't surprise me at all,

1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:12.440
 but I think it's probably more implicit

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:16.280
 at the lower levels where something,

1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:17.240
 you brought up drug policy.

1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.760
 I will say that for years now,

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:24.760
 it's been this kind of unquestioned goal by, for example,

1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:28.760
 the drug czar's office in the US

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:32.640
 to make the price of illegal drugs as high as possible

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:35.380
 without this kind of nuanced approach that,

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.680
 yeah, if you make, you know,

1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:41.760
 for some people, if you make the price so high,

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.840
 you're actually making things worse.

1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:47.520
 I mean, I'm all about reducing the problems associated

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:48.740
 with drugs and drug addictions.

1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:50.480
 And part of that is the,

1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:53.460
 are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves,

1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:57.560
 but a whole lot is what you get from indirectly

1:11:57.560 --> 1:11:59.720
 and, you know, sort of the,

1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:02.080
 both for the individual and for society.

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:04.420
 So like making a poor person

1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:05.860
 who doesn't have enough money for their kids,

1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:06.920
 making them even poorer.

1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:10.920
 So now you've made their children's future worse

1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:12.560
 because they're growing up in deeper poverty

1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:14.960
 because you've essentially levied a tax

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:18.760
 onto this person who's heavily addicted.

1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:21.480
 But then at the societal level, you know,

1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:23.480
 so everything we know about the drug war

1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:26.200
 in terms of the heavy criminalization

1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:29.280
 and filling up prisons and reducing employment

1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:31.520
 and educational opportunities,

1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:32.720
 which in the big picture,

1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.840
 we know are the things that in a free market

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:38.920
 compete against some of the worst problems of addiction

1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:40.880
 is actually having educational

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:42.120
 and employment opportunities.

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.560
 But when you give someone a felony, for example,

1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:47.360
 you're pretty much guaranteeing

1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:50.320
 they're never gonna go very high on the economic ladder.

1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:53.800
 And so you're making drugs a better reward

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.360
 for that person's future.

1:12:56.360 --> 1:13:00.480
 So this is a quick step into the policy realm.

1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:02.800
 And I think for both you and I,

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.120
 I'm not sure you can correct me,

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.640
 but I'm more comfortable into studying the effects of drugs

1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:12.140
 on the human behavior and human psychology

1:13:12.140 --> 1:13:13.160
 versus like policy.

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:14.800
 It seems like a whole giant mess,

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:19.800
 but yeah, there's some libertarian candidates for president

1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:23.160
 and just libertarian thinkers

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.180
 that had a nice thought experiment

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.720
 of possibly legalizing,

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.920
 I've spoken about possibly legalizing basically all drugs.

1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:34.880
 In your intuition,

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:39.720
 do you think a world where all drugs are legal

1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:43.680
 is a safer world or a less safe world

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.280
 for the users of those drugs?

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:47.880
 It really depends on what we mean by legalization.

1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:50.440
 So this is one of my beefs with this,

1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:52.280
 how these things are talked about.

1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:57.280
 I mean, we have very few completely laissez faire,

1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:59.400
 you know, legal drugs.

1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:02.360
 So even caffeine is one of the few examples.

1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:05.720
 So for example, caffeine and tea and coffee is in that realm.

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:07.420
 Like there's no limits, no one's testing,

1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:09.320
 there's no laws, regulation at any level

1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.200
 of how much caffeine you're allowed to buy

1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:12.040
 or how much is in the product.

1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:14.960
 But even like with this Starbucks, like nitro,

1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:18.000
 there are rules with soda and with canned products,

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.440
 you can only put so much.

1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:20.280
 In there, yeah.

1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:22.800
 So this is FDA regulated.

1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:24.880
 And it's kind of weird because there's a limit to sodas

1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:27.400
 that's not there for energy drinks and other things.

1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:29.520
 But, you know, so even caffeine,

1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.480
 it depends on what product we're talking about.

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.000
 Like if you're like no dose

1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.840
 and other caffeine products over the counter,

1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:36.920
 like you can't just put 800 milligrams in there.

1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:39.400
 The pills are like one or 200 milligrams.

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:41.920
 And so it's FDA regulated as an over counter drug.

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:45.200
 Some of the most dangerous drugs in society,

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:47.280
 I would say arguably one of the most dangerous classes

1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:49.600
 of drugs is the volatile anesthetics, huffing.

1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:52.120
 People huffing gasoline and, you know, airplane glue,

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:57.120
 toluene, whatnot, severely damaging to the nervous system.

1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:01.480
 Pretty much legal, but there's some regulation

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:03.000
 in the sense that there's a warning label,

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.840
 like it's illegal to do it for,

1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:07.880
 not that they're busting people for this,

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.520
 but, you know, it's against federal law

1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:13.640
 to use this in a way other than intended type of,

1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:17.080
 basically saying like, yeah, don't huff this, you know,

1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.000
 your paint thinner or whatnot.

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.160
 It at least keeps people from selling it for that.

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:24.520
 Like, no, because they're gonna go after that person.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:25.480
 They're not gonna be able to find

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:27.120
 the 12 year old who's huffing.

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:30.920
 So anyway, just as some extreme examples at the end.

1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:34.960
 And then, you know, even the so called illegal,

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.440
 like schedule one drugs, psilocybin,

1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:39.440
 we do plenty in terms of schedule two,

1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:42.000
 which is ironically less restrictive than psilocybin,

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.360
 but methamphetamine and cocaine,

1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:45.240
 I've done human research with.

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.000
 My research has been legal.

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.240
 So they're scheduled compounds,

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:49.520
 but they're not completely illegal.

1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:51.520
 Like you can do research with them

1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:55.600
 with the appropriate licenses and approval.

1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:57.840
 So there really is no such thing.

1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.040
 And like alcohol, well, it's illegal

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:03.520
 if you're 12 years old or 18 years old or 20 years old.

1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:05.840
 And for anyone, it's illegal to be drinking it

1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:06.680
 while you're driving.

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:09.080
 So there's always a nuance.

1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:11.160
 It's not dichotomy.

1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:12.480
 And I actually should admit,

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:13.960
 it's been on my to do list for a while

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:17.360
 to buy in Massachusetts, some like edible,

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:18.920
 or buy weed legally.

1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:23.640
 Yeah, haven't done that in Massachusetts,

1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:24.680
 let's put it this way.

1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:28.280
 And I wonder what that experience is like,

1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:31.040
 because I think it's fully legal in Massachusetts.

1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:35.560
 And so I wonder what legal drugs look like to me.

1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:38.920
 You know, I grew up with even weed being like,

1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:41.840
 you know, it's like this forbidden thing,

1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:43.840
 you know, not forbidden, but it's illegal.

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.480
 You know, most people, of course, I never partook,

1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:50.520
 but most people I knew would attain it illegally.

1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:53.760
 And so that big switch that's been happening

1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:57.640
 across the country, there's like federal stuff going on

1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:00.280
 to make marijuana legal federally.

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:01.560
 I'm half paying attention.

1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:02.680
 There's some movement there.

1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:03.760
 I mean, the House passed a bill

1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:06.040
 that's not gonna be passed by the Senate,

1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:08.520
 but yeah, it's progress.

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:09.960
 There's clearly a change.

1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.400
 Right, it's moving in a trend.

1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:14.440
 So that's the example of a drug that used to be illegal

1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:16.800
 is now becoming more and more and more legal.

1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:22.760
 So like, I wonder what like cocaine being legal looks like,

1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:26.040
 what a society with cocaine being legal looks like,

1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:30.760
 the rules around it, you know, the processes

1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:34.440
 in which you can consume it in a safer way

1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:37.080
 and be more educated about its consequences,

1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:41.240
 be able to control dose and like purity much better,

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:44.080
 be able to get help for overdose.

1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:46.800
 I don't know, all those kinds of things.

1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:51.800
 It does in a utopian sense feel like legalizing drugs

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:56.440
 at least should be talked about and considered

1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:59.600
 versus keeping them in the dark.

1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:00.440
 I agree.

1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:04.160
 But yeah, so that in your sense,

1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:10.240
 it's possible that in 50 years we legalize all drugs

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:13.120
 and it makes for a better world.

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:15.800
 The way I like to talk about it is that I would say

1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:18.360
 that it's possible and it would probably be a good thing

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:20.960
 if we regulate all drugs.

1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:23.920
 How would you regulate like cocaine, for example?

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:25.600
 Is there ideas there?

1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:28.720
 So yeah, and you were already, you know, going, you know,

1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:31.160
 where I was going with that kind of first I described

1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:32.040
 how there's always a new ones.

1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:34.120
 And even like the cannabis in Massachusetts,

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:35.040
 federally illegal.

1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.320
 So for example, if I was like, and I, you know,

1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:39.840
 colleagues that do cannabis research

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:41.200
 where they get people high in the lab,

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.680
 like you're a federal funded researcher with NIH funds,

1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:46.080
 you can't get that stuff from the dispensary

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:48.200
 because you're breaking a federal law.

1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.880
 Even though the feds don't have the resources to go after,

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.480
 they don't want the controversy at this point

1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:53.800
 to go after the individual users

1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:56.280
 or even the sellers in those legal states.

1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:57.360
 So there's always this nuance,

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.560
 but it's about the right regulation.

1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:03.040
 So I think we already know enough that, for example,

1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:06.240
 like I think safe injection sites for hard drugs

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:07.080
 makes a lot of sense.

1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:11.560
 Like I wouldn't want heroin and cocaine

1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.080
 at the convenience stores.

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:15.280
 And I don't think, maybe there's some extreme libertarians

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:16.120
 that want that.

1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:19.360
 I think even the folks that identify as libertarians,

1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:21.680
 probably most of them don't, well, I don't know.

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:23.680
 Like not all of them want that, you know?

1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:27.600
 I think, you know, that as a form of regulation,

1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:29.560
 like, look, if you're using these hard drugs

1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:33.000
 on a regular basis, you're putting yourself at risk

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.240
 for lethal overdose.

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:37.920
 You're putting yourself at risk for catching HIV

1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:39.520
 and hepatitis.

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:43.560
 If you're gonna do it, if you're doing it anyway,

1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:46.120
 come to this place where at least you're not like,

1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:50.120
 you know, like pulling the water out of like,

1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:52.320
 you know, the puddle on the side of the street.

1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:54.120
 Yeah, so it's done by professionals

1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:57.120
 and those professionals are able to educate you also.

1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:01.680
 So like a 711 clerk may not be both capable

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:05.200
 of helping you to inject the drug properly,

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.680
 but also won't be equipped to educate you

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:10.040
 at the negative consequences, all those kinds of things.

1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:11.880
 That's a huge part of it, the education.

1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:13.720
 But then I think with the opioids,

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:18.280
 like the big part of it is just like with naloxone,

1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:21.960
 which is an antagonist, it goes into the receptor,

1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:23.960
 it's called Narcan, that's the trade name,

1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:26.960
 but it's what they revive people on an opioid overdose.

1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:29.200
 That's almost completely effective.

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:31.120
 Like if there's a medical professional there

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:33.320
 and someone's ODing on an opioid,

1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:35.360
 they're virtually guaranteed to live.

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:40.120
 Like that's remarkable that if 100% at the opioid crisis,

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:43.040
 you know, if all of those people right now that are dying

1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:45.280
 were doing that in the presence of a medical professional,

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:48.040
 like even like a nurse with Narcan,

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.000
 there'd be basically almost no deaths.

1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.400
 There's always some exceptions, but you know,

1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.400
 almost no deaths, like that's staggering to me.

1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:56.680
 So the idea that people are doing this,

1:20:56.680 --> 1:21:01.160
 that we could have that level of positive effect

1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:02.560
 without encouraging the drug.

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:05.040
 And this is where like you get into this like terrain

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:06.520
 of like sending the wrong message.

1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:09.040
 And it's like, no, you can do that.

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:12.080
 You can say like, we're not encouraging this.

1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:15.360
 In fact, probably one of the greatest advertisements

1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:16.880
 for not getting hooked on heroin

1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:18.360
 is like visiting a methadone clinic,

1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:19.880
 visiting a safe injection site.

1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:23.640
 Like this is not like an advertisement

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.040
 for getting hooked on this drug,

1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:26.640
 but knowing that we can save people.

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:27.880
 Now you have a landscape here

1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:31.080
 because a lot of times it's just like supervised injection,

1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:32.640
 but you bring your own stuff, you know,

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:34.880
 you bring your own heroin, which could still be, you know,

1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:38.760
 dirty and filled with fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives,

1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:41.480
 which because of the incredible potency

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:43.400
 and the more difficulty measuring it,

1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:46.040
 and some differences at the receptor,

1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:47.680
 like you may be more likely,

1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:51.280
 you are more likely on average to lethally overdose on it.

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.760
 You know, so you could,

1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:55.880
 the level that's been more explored in Switzerland

1:21:55.880 --> 1:22:00.880
 is in some places is you actually provide the drug itself

1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:03.160
 and you supervise the injection.

1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:04.000
 So I don't see.

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.120
 Do you like that idea?

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:08.720
 Yeah, the public health data are completely on the side of,

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.000
 there's really no credible evidence to this.

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.720
 If we allow that, we're sending the wrong message

1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:15.560
 and everyone's gonna, I mean, I'm not showing up.

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:17.320
 Like, you know, and it's different by drug.

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:19.880
 Like, yeah, you legalize, you set up cannabis shops

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:20.720
 and some people are gonna say,

1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:21.880
 so you go, I'm gonna go there.

1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:22.960
 I don't think a whole lot of people

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:24.840
 are gonna go to one of these places

1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:28.040
 and say, I'm gonna shoot up heroin for the first time.

1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:29.320
 And even if like, you know,

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:30.840
 it's a country of 300 million people,

1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:33.200
 like even if someone does that,

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:35.800
 you have to compare this to the every day

1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:39.160
 people are dying from opioid overdoses.

1:22:39.160 --> 1:22:41.240
 Like people's kids, people's uncles,

1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:42.800
 people's like, these are real lives

1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:43.640
 that are being shattered.

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.360
 So you just look at that.

1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:46.200
 And then the other thing,

1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:49.080
 and I know this from having done residential,

1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:50.480
 even like non treatment research,

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:52.880
 where we just have a cocaine user or something,

1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:54.600
 stay on our inpatient ward for a month

1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:55.600
 and you really get to know them.

1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:58.080
 And sometimes you see like, oftentimes

1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.760
 that's the first time this person has had a discussion

1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:03.000
 with a medical professional, any type of professional

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.280
 in their entire life around their drug use.

1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:07.240
 Even if they're not looking to quit.

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:09.400
 And it's like, you know, you could imagine that

1:23:09.400 --> 1:23:12.600
 in the safe injection settings where it's like,

1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:15.200
 it might be a year into treatment and they're like,

1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:17.440
 you know, doc, I know you're not the cops.

1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:18.520
 Like you really care for me.

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:21.160
 Like, I think I'm ready to try that methadone thing.

1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:23.520
 I think I'm really, I think I wanna be done.

1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:24.720
 I'm really patient about it, yeah.

1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:26.680
 Yeah, they get to trust the people

1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.000
 and realize that they're there

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.040
 cause they truly like, they have a compassion,

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:34.460
 a love for this community, like as human beings,

1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:36.480
 and they don't want people to die.

1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:39.280
 And you get real human connections and that,

1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:40.940
 and again, like those are the conditions

1:23:40.940 --> 1:23:42.960
 where people are gonna ultimately seek treatment

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:46.800
 and not everyone always will, but you're gonna get that.

1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:48.400
 And then, you know, you're gonna get people

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:50.960
 like looking into treatment options sometimes,

1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:53.720
 you know, maybe it's years into the treatment.

1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.120
 So it's like, they're just all of these indirect benefits

1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:57.680
 that I think at that level,

1:23:57.680 --> 1:23:59.440
 I don't know if you'd call that legalizing,

1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:02.720
 you know, I think again, at least well regulated.

1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:04.600
 Right, whatever that word is.

1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:08.280
 Yeah, well regulated, but out in the open.

1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:11.520
 Right, minimizing as many harms as we can

1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:13.360
 while not encouraging.

1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:15.480
 I mean, we don't encourage people to drink all the,

1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:17.880
 I mean, people die every year from caffeine overdose.

1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:20.580
 Like, you know, there's different ways to like, you know,

1:24:20.580 --> 1:24:22.320
 just by allowing something doesn't mean

1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:24.440
 we're sending the message that, you know,

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:26.960
 by saying we're not gonna give you a felony,

1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:31.960
 which is actually often the penalty for psychedelics.

1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:34.880
 I just actually testified for the Judiciary Committee

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:38.440
 of the Senate, the Assembly in New Jersey.

1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:43.440
 And just to move psilocybin from a felony to misdemeanor,

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:45.480
 they use different language in New Jersey, it's weird,

1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:47.160
 but like the equivalent of felony and misdemeanor.

1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:49.560
 And that was like, two people didn't vote for that

1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:53.220
 on this committee because it was might,

1:24:53.220 --> 1:24:55.160
 one of them said it might be sending the wrong message.

1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:59.080
 And it's like, a felony, I mean, there's real harms.

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:01.560
 Like, that's the scarlet letter the rest of your life.

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:04.200
 You're stuck at the lower ends of the employment ladder.

1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:07.000
 You're not gonna get, you know, loans for education,

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.960
 all of this, maybe because of a stupid mistake

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.400
 you made once as a 19 year old.

1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:12.800
 Doing something that like, you know,

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.260
 a presidential candidate could have done and admitted to

1:25:15.260 --> 1:25:16.840
 and had no problem, you know?

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:21.840
 Yeah, what drug is the most addictive,

1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:25.480
 the most dangerous in your view?

1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:29.040
 Not maybe, like not technically,

1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:31.320
 like specifically which drug,

1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:34.240
 but more like in our society today,

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:35.960
 what is a highly problematic drug?

1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:38.840
 We talked about psychedelics not being that addictive

1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:41.720
 on the other flip side of that.

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.360
 You mentioned cocaine, is that the top one?

1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:46.200
 Is there something else?

1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:48.000
 That's a concern to you?

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.240
 It depends, and you've already alluded to this nuance.

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:51.360
 It depends on how you define it.

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.760
 If we're talking about on the ground today,

1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:56.320
 in, you know, a modern society,

1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:59.800
 I'd say nicotine, tobacco.

1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:00.960
 Oh shit.

1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:03.480
 I mean, in terms of mortality,

1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:08.480
 it kills far more than any other drug known to humankind.

1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:10.960
 Four times more than alcohol,

1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:13.680
 like a half million deaths in the US every year

1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:18.520
 and about five to six million worldwide due to tobacco.

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.560
 That's four times more in the US than alcohol.

1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.080
 And if you graph all of the drugs, legal and illegal,

1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:28.040
 like, you know, put all of the illegal drugs

1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:30.760
 in like one category on that figure,

1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:33.480
 and you put alcohol and tobacco on that figure,

1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:35.160
 all the illegal drugs combined,

1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:39.800
 they're a barely visible blip to this incredible,

1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:43.280
 like there's no, even all of the opioid epidemic rolled up

1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:44.800
 along with cocaine and everything else,

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:47.080
 the meth barely shows up compared to tobacco.

1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:49.360
 That's one of those uncomfortable truths

1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:52.800
 that I don't know what to do with.

1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:55.240
 It's like where everybody's freaking out

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:57.120
 about coronavirus, right?

1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:00.720
 And nobody's... The relative.

1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:01.560
 It's all relative.

1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:03.760
 If you look at the relative thing,

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:06.240
 it's like, well, why aren't we freaking out

1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:10.040
 about cigarettes, which we are increasingly so

1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:12.400
 over the, historically speaking, right?

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:14.920
 Right. It's like terrorism versus swimming pools.

1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:17.440
 I remember that being back in the,

1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:18.880
 after the war on terror started.

1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:21.720
 It's like, yeah, there's not even comparison.

1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:25.320
 Okay. So, you know, that's a little sobering truth there.

1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:26.880
 Cause I was thinking like cocaine,

1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:29.800
 I was thinking about all of these hard drugs,

1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:33.320
 but the reality is relatively nicotine is the big one.

1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:35.440
 And you didn't ask about mortality or deaths.

1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:37.400
 You asked about addiction,

1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:40.480
 but that really is hard to evaluate.

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.560
 It gets into those nuances I spoke of before

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.080
 about there's not a unidimensional way

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:46.240
 to measure reinforcement.

1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:48.000
 It kind of depends on the situation

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.760
 and what measure we're looking at.

1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:55.000
 But you know, more people have access to tobacco

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.560
 and I'm not advocating that we make it an illegal drug.

1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.880
 I think that would be a horrible mistake.

1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:03.040
 Although there is a very credible push

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:07.600
 to mandate the reduction of nicotine in cigarettes,

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:10.840
 which I have most scientists that study it are for it.

1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:14.040
 I think there's some real dangers there

1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.120
 cause I see that in the broader history of drug use.

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.240
 It's like when has drug prohibition worked broadly speaking?

1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:25.240
 And it's to me that path would only make sense

1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:28.360
 in very good conjunction with eCigarettes,

1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:31.560
 which once they're fully regulated can be a safer,

1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:34.240
 not safe, but much safer alternative.

1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:37.880
 And if we tax the hell out of eCigarettes

1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:39.680
 and ban every attractive feature

1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:41.800
 like flavors and everything,

1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:45.960
 then that's gonna push people to a black market

1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:47.760
 if they can't get the real thing from real cigarette.

1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:49.840
 Like some people will just quit straight out.

1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:51.360
 But I think with the regulators

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:53.920
 and what a lot of scientists that study tobacco,

1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:56.900
 like myself, it's a big part still of what I study.

1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:01.920
 They're not used to thinking about the like tobacco really

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:04.520
 as a drug largely speaking in terms of,

1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:07.500
 for example, the history of prohibition.

1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.340
 And I think of like,

1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:09.960
 we already know there's an illicit market,

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:14.640
 a black market for tobacco to get around taxes.

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.600
 I mean, and for selling even loose cigarettes,

1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.480
 that's what initially caused in Staten Island

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.840
 the police to approach Eric Garland

1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:23.460
 who was selling loose cigarettes and he got choked out.

1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:25.160
 I mean, the thing that caused that police contact

1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:27.880
 was he was selling, well, I think reported

1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.520
 to sell individual cigarettes for like,

1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:32.240
 he gets home for court, it happens in Baltimore.

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:34.400
 And it's like, that's technically illegal.

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:39.160
 But are you not gonna have massive boats

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:42.240
 of supplies coming over from China and elsewhere

1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:47.240
 of real deal cigarettes if you ban the sale of nicotine?

1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:49.960
 Like it's obviously gonna happen.

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.520
 And you have to weigh that against,

1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:55.640
 you're gonna create a black market to one size or another.

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.560
 And your intuition that really hasn't worked

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:59.860
 throughout the history when we've tried it.

1:29:59.860 --> 1:30:01.920
 Right, but I see a potential path forward,

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.040
 but only if it's well,

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:06.080
 if it's not in conjunction with eCigarettes.

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:07.360
 If there's a clear alternative,

1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:08.600
 that's a positive alternative

1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:13.600
 that it kind of stares the population towards an alternative.

1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:16.640
 The difference here, the unique thing

1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:18.080
 that could be taken advantage of here

1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:20.800
 is nicotine is by and large, not what causes the harm.

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:23.040
 It's the aromatic hydrocarbons,

1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:26.360
 it's the carcinogens and tobacco,

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:29.500
 it's burning tobacco smoke, it's not the nicotine.

1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:34.140
 So it's not like alcohol prohibition

1:30:34.140 --> 1:30:37.680
 where like you couldn't create the O'Douls,

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:39.760
 the near beer is not gonna have the alcohol.

1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:42.600
 And so people like, here you do have the possibility

1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:47.600
 of giving another medium the ability to deliver the drug,

1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:49.880
 which still aren't to a lot of people

1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:52.320
 isn't preferred to the tobacco, but nonetheless,

1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:54.220
 again, if you overregulate those

1:30:54.220 --> 1:30:55.440
 and make them less attractive,

1:30:55.440 --> 1:30:58.800
 like if you aren't thoughtful about the nicotine limits

1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:00.880
 and thoughtful about whether you're allowing flavors

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:03.480
 and everything, and if you overtax them,

1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:06.020
 you're actually decreasing the ability to compete

1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:08.720
 with the more dangerous products.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.120
 So I feel like there is a potential path forward,

1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:12.480
 but I don't have a lot of confidence

1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:17.080
 that that's gonna be done in a thoughtful analytical way.

1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:20.760
 And I'm afraid that it could decrease the increase

1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:23.160
 of black market calls all of the harms.

1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:26.840
 Like every other drug we're moving away from the prohibition

1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:30.120
 model slowly, but the big barge ship

1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:32.400
 is like making a very slow turn.

1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:34.960
 And like, okay, we really had to step back

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:38.760
 and question if we went with nicotine, tobacco,

1:31:38.760 --> 1:31:41.560
 are we moving into that direction?

1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:43.600
 Like big picture.

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:45.200
 It doesn't quite make sense.

1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:50.200
 You've done a study on cocaine and sexual decision making.

1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:53.900
 Can you explain?

1:31:53.900 --> 1:31:56.920
 Can you explain the findings?

1:31:56.920 --> 1:32:01.920
 I mean, in a broad sense, how do you do a study

1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:08.140
 that involves cocaine and the other,

1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:13.060
 how do you do a study involving sexual decision making?

1:32:13.060 --> 1:32:16.700
 And then how do you do a study that combines both?

1:32:16.700 --> 1:32:18.020
 Yeah, sex and drugs too.

1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:19.460
 I'm just missing the rock and roll.

1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:21.380
 It's like the two controversial,

1:32:21.380 --> 1:32:23.760
 rock and roll isn't very controversial anymore.

1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:26.380
 Yeah, so the cocaine, lots of hoops to jump through.

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:28.420
 You gotta have a lot of medical support.

1:32:28.420 --> 1:32:30.620
 You gotta be at a basically an institution,

1:32:30.620 --> 1:32:34.380
 a research unit like I'm at that has a long history

1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:39.380
 and the ability to do that and get ethics approval,

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:41.620
 get FDA approval, but it's possible.

1:32:41.620 --> 1:32:43.940
 And whenever you're dealing with something like cocaine,

1:32:43.940 --> 1:32:46.820
 you would never wanna give that to someone

1:32:46.820 --> 1:32:49.300
 who hasn't already used cocaine.

1:32:49.300 --> 1:32:51.260
 And you wanna make sure you're not giving it to someone

1:32:51.260 --> 1:32:53.380
 who is an active user who wants to quit.

1:32:53.380 --> 1:32:54.780
 So the idea is like, okay,

1:32:54.780 --> 1:32:57.180
 if you're using this type of drug anyway,

1:32:57.180 --> 1:33:00.540
 and we're really sure you're not looking to quit,

1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:04.220
 hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us

1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:06.460
 so we can at least learn something.

1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:09.100
 And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use

1:33:09.100 --> 1:33:12.060
 and it'll reduce the harms of cocaine.

1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.340
 So there's hoops to jump through.

1:33:14.340 --> 1:33:16.660
 With the sexual decision making,

1:33:16.660 --> 1:33:18.980
 I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model

1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:21.620
 of I applied delayed discounting

1:33:21.620 --> 1:33:24.420
 to what we talked about earlier, the now versus later,

1:33:24.420 --> 1:33:27.340
 that kind of decision making that goes along with addiction.

1:33:27.340 --> 1:33:29.340
 I applied that to condom use decisions.

1:33:30.220 --> 1:33:33.660
 And I've done probably published about 20 or so papers

1:33:33.660 --> 1:33:35.140
 with this and different drugs.

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:39.140
 So the primary metric is whether you do

1:33:39.140 --> 1:33:40.500
 or don't use a condom?

1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:43.920
 Right, and so this is using hypothetical decision making,

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:47.700
 but I've published some studies looking at,

1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:51.060
 showing a tight correspondence to self report it

1:33:51.060 --> 1:33:54.740
 in correlational studies to self reported behavior.

1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.940
 So this is like, so like how do you,

1:33:57.940 --> 1:33:59.900
 did you do a questionnaire kind of thing?

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:02.360
 Right, so it's not quite a questionnaire,

1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:07.360
 but it's a behavioral task requiring them to respond to.

1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:11.580
 So you show pictures of a bunch of individuals

1:34:11.580 --> 1:34:13.620
 and it's kind of like one of these fun behavioral,

1:34:13.620 --> 1:34:15.820
 like a lot of them you get like numbers are boring,

1:34:15.820 --> 1:34:17.420
 but it's like, okay, hot or not,

1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:18.720
 like which of these 60 people

1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.540
 would you have a one night stand with?

1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:22.500
 Men, women, so pick whatever you like,

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:23.540
 a little bit of this, a little bit of that,

1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:26.900
 whatever you're into, it's all variety there.

1:34:26.900 --> 1:34:29.160
 Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people.

1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:31.740
 Who do you think is the one you most want to have sex

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:34.060
 with the least, he thinks most likely to have an STI

1:34:34.060 --> 1:34:37.820
 or least likely a sexually transmitted disease by STI.

1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:41.540
 And then you could do certain decision making questions.

1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:43.820
 So what I've done is asked,

1:34:43.820 --> 1:34:45.220
 say this person you read a vignette,

1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:46.860
 this person wants to have sex with you now you've met them,

1:34:46.860 --> 1:34:50.020
 you get along casual sex scenario,

1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:53.020
 like a one night stand with a condoms available,

1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:54.820
 just rate your likelihood from one to 100

1:34:54.820 --> 1:34:57.540
 on this kind of scale, would you use it?

1:34:57.540 --> 1:34:59.820
 But then you can change your scenario to say,

1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:01.700
 okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes

1:35:01.700 --> 1:35:02.940
 to use a condom.

1:35:02.940 --> 1:35:04.940
 So the choice is now instead of using condom

1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.380
 versus not in terms of your likelihood scale,

1:35:07.380 --> 1:35:11.980
 it now what ranges from have sex now without a condom

1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:13.820
 versus on the other end of the scale

1:35:13.820 --> 1:35:16.380
 is wait five minutes to have sex with a condom.

1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:18.380
 So you rate your likelihood of where your behavior

1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:20.420
 would be along that continuum.

1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:22.780
 And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?

1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:23.900
 What about three hours?

1:35:23.900 --> 1:35:25.980
 What about 24 hours?

1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:30.980
 Misunderstanding, now without a condom

1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:32.860
 or five minutes later with a condom?

1:35:32.860 --> 1:35:33.700
 Right.

1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:38.700
 So what's supposed to be the preference for the person?

1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:44.060
 There's a lot of factors coming into play, right?

1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:49.060
 There's like pleasure, a personal preference

1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:51.540
 and then there's also the safety.

1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:55.300
 Those are two like, are those competing objectives?

1:35:55.300 --> 1:35:57.100
 Right, and so we do get at that

1:35:57.100 --> 1:35:58.700
 through some individual measures

1:35:58.700 --> 1:36:01.100
 and this task is more of a face valid task

1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:02.620
 where there's a lot underneath the hood.

1:36:02.620 --> 1:36:07.540
 So for most people, sex with the condom is the better reward

1:36:07.540 --> 1:36:09.100
 but underneath the hood of that

1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:11.460
 is just at the purely physical level,

1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:13.580
 they'd rather have sex without the condom.

1:36:13.580 --> 1:36:14.500
 It's gonna feel better.

1:36:14.500 --> 1:36:15.660
 What do you mean by reward?

1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:19.700
 Like when they calculate their trajectory through life

1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:21.340
 and try to optimize it,

1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:24.460
 then sex with the condom is a good idea?

1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.820
 Well, it's really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah.

1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:30.660
 Presumably that's the case that there's,

1:36:31.580 --> 1:36:33.140
 but it's measured by like what would you,

1:36:33.140 --> 1:36:35.420
 really that first question where there is no delay.

1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:38.020
 Most people say they would be at the higher end scale

1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:39.380
 a lot of times 100% they would say

1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:41.740
 they would definitely use a condom.

1:36:41.740 --> 1:36:43.860
 Not everybody and that we know that's the case.

1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:46.180
 See, it's like that some people don't like condoms,

1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:49.100
 some people say, yeah, I wanna use a condom

1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:50.980
 but quarter of the time ended up not

1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:53.820
 because I just getting lost in the passion of the moment.

1:36:53.820 --> 1:36:56.940
 So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people,

1:36:56.940 --> 1:36:58.620
 so behaviorally speaking,

1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:00.060
 at least for a large number of people

1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:02.540
 in many circumstances condom use as a reinforcer

1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:03.940
 just because people do it.

1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:07.020
 Like, why are they doing it?

1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:10.180
 They're not because it makes the sex feel better

1:37:10.180 --> 1:37:12.660
 but because it makes that it allows

1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:15.020
 for at least the same general reward.

1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:16.940
 Even if actually, even if it feels a little bit

1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:20.300
 not as good with the condom, nonetheless,

1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:24.740
 they get most of the benefit without the concurrent,

1:37:24.740 --> 1:37:27.940
 oh my gosh, there's this risk of either unwanted pregnancy

1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:31.980
 or getting HIV or way more likely than HIV,

1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:36.420
 herpes in general awards, et cetera, all the lovely ones.

1:37:37.380 --> 1:37:38.900
 And we've actually done research saying like

1:37:38.900 --> 1:37:40.340
 where we gauge the probability

1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:42.580
 of these individual different SDIs.

1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:43.660
 And it's like, what's the heavy hitter

1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:46.580
 in terms of what people are using to judge

1:37:46.580 --> 1:37:49.220
 and to evaluate whether they're gonna use a condom.

1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:52.500
 So that's why the condom use is the delayed thing,

1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:54.220
 five minutes or more.

1:37:54.220 --> 1:37:56.340
 And then, yeah, because that's the prefer.

1:37:56.340 --> 1:37:58.300
 Which would normally be the larger later reward

1:37:58.300 --> 1:38:00.980
 like the $10 versus the nine, it's like the $10,

1:38:00.980 --> 1:38:02.260
 which is counterintuitive

1:38:02.260 --> 1:38:04.340
 if you just think about the physical pleasure.

1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:07.180
 So that's a good thing to measure.

1:38:07.180 --> 1:38:09.020
 So condom use is a really good concrete,

1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:13.660
 quantifiable thing that you can use in a study.

1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:15.980
 And then you can add a lot of different elements

1:38:15.980 --> 1:38:18.380
 like the presence of cocaine and so on.

1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:20.980
 Yeah, you can get people loaded on like any number of drugs

1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:22.860
 like cocaine, alcohol and methamphetamine

1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:24.980
 are the three that I've done and published on.

1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:26.820
 And it's interesting that.

1:38:26.820 --> 1:38:28.940
 These are fun studies, man.

1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:32.260
 Right, I love to get people loaded in a safe context

1:38:32.260 --> 1:38:34.100
 and like, but to really, it started,

1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:36.380
 like there was some early research with alcohol.

1:38:36.380 --> 1:38:38.060
 I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting,

1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:40.340
 but it's like all of these drugs are fascinating.

1:38:40.340 --> 1:38:41.620
 The fact that all of these are keys

1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:45.340
 that unlock a certain like psychological experience

1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:46.580
 in the head.

1:38:46.580 --> 1:38:48.580
 And so there was this work with alcohol

1:38:48.580 --> 1:38:51.460
 that showed that it didn't affect those monetary

1:38:51.460 --> 1:38:53.140
 delay discounting decisions,

1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:54.940
 $9 now versus $10 later.

1:38:54.940 --> 1:38:57.020
 And I'm like getting people drunk.

1:38:57.020 --> 1:38:59.780
 And I thought to myself, are you telling me

1:38:59.780 --> 1:39:02.420
 that getting someone,

1:39:02.420 --> 1:39:05.420
 that people being drunk does not cause people

1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:06.700
 at least sometimes to make,

1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:10.780
 to choose what's good for them in the short term

1:39:10.780 --> 1:39:13.740
 at the expense of what's good for them in the long term.

1:39:13.740 --> 1:39:16.660
 It's like, bullshit, like we see like,

1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.300
 but in what context does that happen?

1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:21.980
 So that's something that inspired me to go

1:39:21.980 --> 1:39:25.540
 in this direction of like, aha, risky sexual decisions

1:39:25.540 --> 1:39:27.060
 is something they do when they're drunk.

1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:28.220
 They don't necessarily go home.

1:39:28.220 --> 1:39:30.540
 And even though some people have gambling problems

1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:31.820
 and alcohol interacts with that,

1:39:31.820 --> 1:39:34.740
 the most typical thing is not for people to go home,

1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:36.940
 log on and change their allocation

1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:40.460
 in their retirement account or something like that.

1:39:40.460 --> 1:39:42.420
 But they're more likely, risky sexual decisions,

1:39:42.420 --> 1:39:44.460
 they're more likely to not wait the five minutes

1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:48.340
 for the condom and instead go no condom now.

1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:49.580
 Right, that's a big effect.

1:39:49.580 --> 1:39:50.660
 And we see that.

1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:53.300
 And interestingly, we do not see,

1:39:53.300 --> 1:39:55.180
 with those different drugs, we don't see an effect

1:39:55.180 --> 1:39:57.260
 if we just look at that zero delay condition.

1:39:57.260 --> 1:39:59.700
 In other words, the condoms right there waiting to be used,

1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:00.700
 how likely are to use it?

1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:01.700
 You don't see it.

1:40:01.700 --> 1:40:05.700
 I mean, people are by and large gonna use the condom.

1:40:05.700 --> 1:40:08.020
 So, and that's the way most of this research

1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.460
 outside of behavioral economics

1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:11.460
 that just looked at condom use decisions,

1:40:12.740 --> 1:40:15.220
 very little of which has ever actually administered

1:40:15.220 --> 1:40:17.420
 the drugs, which is another unique aspect.

1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:19.420
 But they usually just look at like assuming

1:40:19.420 --> 1:40:20.620
 the condom is there.

1:40:20.620 --> 1:40:22.980
 But this is more using behavioral economics

1:40:22.980 --> 1:40:24.620
 to delve in and model something that,

1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:26.380
 and I've done survey research on this,

1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:28.180
 modeling what actually happens.

1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:30.740
 Like you meet someone at a laundromat,

1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:32.300
 like you weren't planning on like,

1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:34.740
 and it's like one thing leads to another,

1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:37.940
 they live around the corner, these things.

1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:42.940
 And like we did one survey with men who have sex with men

1:40:43.260 --> 1:40:48.220
 and found that 25% of them, 24%, about a quarter,

1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:49.780
 reported in the last six months

1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:52.380
 that they had unprotected anal intercourse,

1:40:52.380 --> 1:40:54.220
 which is the most risky

1:40:54.220 --> 1:40:56.940
 in terms of sexually transmitted infection.

1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:00.380
 In the last six months, in a situation

1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:01.820
 where they would have used a condom,

1:41:01.820 --> 1:41:02.860
 but they simply didn't use one

1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:04.980
 just because they didn't have one on them.

1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:07.500
 So this to me, it's like,

1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:10.380
 if unless we delve into this and understand this,

1:41:10.380 --> 1:41:12.420
 these suboptimal conditions,

1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:14.140
 we're not gonna fully address the problem.

1:41:14.140 --> 1:41:15.380
 There's plenty of people that say,

1:41:15.380 --> 1:41:17.020
 yep, condom use is good.

1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:19.180
 I use it a lot of the time.

1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:21.340
 It's like, where is that failing?

1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:22.940
 And it's under these suboptimal conditions,

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:24.420
 which in Frank, if you think about it,

1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:26.460
 it's like most of the case.

1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:28.860
 Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy.

1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:31.060
 Someone's like, do you got a condom?

1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:32.020
 Eh, no.

1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:34.460
 It's like, do they break the action

1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:37.620
 and take 10 minutes to go to the convenience store

1:41:37.620 --> 1:41:38.460
 or whatever?

1:41:38.460 --> 1:41:39.580
 Maybe everything's closed.

1:41:39.580 --> 1:41:41.340
 Maybe they gotta wait till tomorrow.

1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:47.380
 And there's something to be studied there on the,

1:41:47.380 --> 1:41:49.860
 that just seems like an unfortunate set of circumstances.

1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:51.660
 Like, what's the solution to that is,

1:41:53.260 --> 1:41:56.380
 I mean, what's the psychology

1:41:56.380 --> 1:42:00.860
 that needs to be taken apart there?

1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:02.860
 Because it just seems like that's the way of life.

1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:05.020
 We don't expect the things to happen.

1:42:05.020 --> 1:42:07.260
 Are we supposed to expect them better

1:42:07.260 --> 1:42:11.580
 to be self aware enough about our calculations?

1:42:11.580 --> 1:42:15.780
 Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store

1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:20.220
 as a kind of thing that we need to understand

1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:25.220
 how we humans evaluate the cost of that.

1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:30.340
 I think in terms of like how we use this to help people,

1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:32.140
 it's mostly on the environment side,

1:42:32.140 --> 1:42:34.500
 rather than on the individual side.

1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:36.140
 Yeah, although those interact.

1:42:36.140 --> 1:42:38.220
 So it's like, in one sense, if you're,

1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:39.740
 especially if you're gonna be drinking

1:42:39.740 --> 1:42:42.300
 or using another substance that is associated

1:42:42.300 --> 1:42:45.380
 with a stimulant, alcohol and stimulants

1:42:45.380 --> 1:42:47.220
 go along with risky sex.

1:42:47.220 --> 1:42:49.260
 Good to be aware that you might make decisions

1:42:49.260 --> 1:42:50.900
 just to tell yourself you might make a decision

1:42:50.900 --> 1:42:54.060
 that you wouldn't have made in your sober state.

1:42:54.060 --> 1:42:57.100
 And so, hey, throwing a condom in the purse,

1:42:57.100 --> 1:43:00.860
 in the pocket, might be a good idea.

1:43:00.860 --> 1:43:02.340
 I think at the environmental level,

1:43:02.340 --> 1:43:04.620
 just more condom, I mean, it highlights what we know

1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:07.780
 about just making condoms widely available.

1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:09.500
 Something that I'd like to do

1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:12.420
 is like reinforcing condom use.

1:43:12.420 --> 1:43:17.420
 So just getting people used to carrying a condom

1:43:17.420 --> 1:43:18.620
 everywhere they go.

1:43:18.620 --> 1:43:20.900
 Because once it's in someone's habit,

1:43:20.900 --> 1:43:22.780
 if they are, say, like a young, single person,

1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:26.740
 and they occasionally have unprotected sex,

1:43:26.740 --> 1:43:27.900
 like training those people,

1:43:27.900 --> 1:43:30.300
 like what if you got a text message

1:43:30.300 --> 1:43:31.700
 once every few days saying,

1:43:31.700 --> 1:43:34.580
 ah, if you send back a photo of a condom,

1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:37.580
 within a minute you get a reward of $5.

1:43:37.580 --> 1:43:39.100
 You could shape that up like that.

1:43:39.100 --> 1:43:40.860
 It's a process called contingency management.

1:43:40.860 --> 1:43:43.820
 It's basically just straight up operant reinforcement.

1:43:43.820 --> 1:43:45.820
 You could shape that up with no problem.

1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:50.100
 And I mean, those procedures of contingency management,

1:43:50.100 --> 1:43:52.220
 giving people systematic rewards is like,

1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:53.420
 for example, the most powerful way

1:43:53.420 --> 1:43:57.100
 to reduce cocaine use in addicted people.

1:43:57.100 --> 1:44:02.100
 And by saying, if you show me a negative urine for cocaine,

1:44:04.380 --> 1:44:05.860
 I'm gonna give you a monetary reward.

1:44:05.860 --> 1:44:07.660
 And like that has huge effects

1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:09.660
 in terms of decreasing cocaine use.

1:44:09.660 --> 1:44:10.820
 If that can be that powerful

1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:12.900
 for something like stopping cocaine use,

1:44:12.900 --> 1:44:15.700
 how powerful could that be for shaping up

1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:16.540
 just carrying a condom?

1:44:16.540 --> 1:44:19.500
 Because the primary, unlike cocaine use,

1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:22.820
 here, we're not saying you can't have the main reward,

1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:24.780
 like you could still have sex,

1:44:24.780 --> 1:44:26.060
 and you can even have sex in the way

1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:28.580
 that you tell yourself you'd rather do it

1:44:28.580 --> 1:44:30.300
 if the condom is available.

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:36.700
 Relatively speaking, it's way easier

1:44:36.700 --> 1:44:39.580
 than like not using cocaine if you like using cocaine.

1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:41.780
 It's just basically getting in the habit

1:44:41.780 --> 1:44:43.140
 of carrying a condom.

1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:45.020
 So that's just one idea of like why.

1:44:45.020 --> 1:44:47.060
 There could be also the capitalistic solutions

1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:49.300
 of like, there could be a business opportunity

1:44:49.300 --> 1:44:51.700
 for like a door dash for condoms.

1:44:51.700 --> 1:44:52.540
 Oh yeah.

1:44:52.540 --> 1:44:53.860
 Like delivery.

1:44:53.860 --> 1:44:55.060
 I thought about this.

1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.980
 Within five minute delivery of a condom at any location,

1:44:57.980 --> 1:44:59.460
 like Uber for condoms.

1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:01.100
 I've thought about it, not with condoms,

1:45:01.100 --> 1:45:03.140
 but a very similar line of thinking,

1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:05.980
 a line that you're going into in terms of Uber

1:45:05.980 --> 1:45:09.020
 and people getting drunk when they enter the bar

1:45:09.020 --> 1:45:10.180
 playing to have one or two,

1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:11.500
 they ended up having five or six,

1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:14.740
 and it's like, okay, yeah, you can take the cab home,

1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:17.140
 the Uber home, but you've left your car there.

1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:18.460
 It might get towed.

1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:20.780
 You might like, there's also the hassle of just,

1:45:20.780 --> 1:45:22.380
 you wanna wake up tomorrow with your hangover

1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:24.540
 and forget about it and move on.

1:45:24.540 --> 1:45:26.260
 And I think a lot of people in their situation,

1:45:26.260 --> 1:45:27.900
 they're like, screw it.

1:45:27.900 --> 1:45:29.860
 I'm gonna take the risk, just get it.

1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:32.060
 What if you had an Uber service where two,

1:45:33.220 --> 1:45:38.220
 you have a car come out with two drivers

1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:43.220
 and one of them, two sober drivers, obviously,

1:45:45.100 --> 1:45:49.660
 and the person, the one driver drops off the other

1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:54.660
 that then drives you home in their car, in your car,

1:45:55.660 --> 1:45:57.140
 so that you can, I mean,

1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:59.100
 I think a lot of people would pay 50 bucks.

1:45:59.100 --> 1:46:01.180
 It's gonna be more than a regular Uber,

1:46:01.180 --> 1:46:02.820
 but it's like, it's gonna be done.

1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:03.660
 I got the money.

1:46:03.660 --> 1:46:06.420
 I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight.

1:46:06.420 --> 1:46:09.620
 Like, just get the damn thing done tomorrow.

1:46:09.620 --> 1:46:10.660
 I'm done with it.

1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:12.980
 I wake up, my car's in front of my house.

1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:14.860
 I think that would be, I think someone could,

1:46:14.860 --> 1:46:15.980
 I'm not gonna open that business,

1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:19.060
 so if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that,

1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:20.780
 I think it could help a lot of people.

1:46:20.780 --> 1:46:21.620
 Yeah, definitely.

1:46:21.620 --> 1:46:23.540
 And Uber itself, I would say,

1:46:23.540 --> 1:46:25.460
 helped a huge amount of people,

1:46:25.460 --> 1:46:28.460
 just making it easy to make the decision

1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:31.580
 of going home, not driving yourself.

1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:33.340
 I read about in Austin where they,

1:46:33.340 --> 1:46:34.220
 I don't know where it's at now,

1:46:34.220 --> 1:46:36.300
 where they outlawed Uber for a while.

1:46:36.300 --> 1:46:39.100
 You know, because of the whole taxicab union type thing

1:46:39.100 --> 1:46:42.060
 and how just, yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people

1:46:42.060 --> 1:46:44.900
 that were used to Uber

1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:47.340
 that now didn't have a cheap alternative.

1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:51.860
 So just, we didn't exactly mention,

1:46:51.860 --> 1:46:54.220
 you've done a lot of studies in sexual decision making

1:46:54.220 --> 1:46:55.180
 with different drugs.

1:46:55.180 --> 1:46:59.540
 Is there some interesting insights or findings

1:46:59.540 --> 1:47:03.100
 on the difference between the different drugs?

1:47:03.100 --> 1:47:06.580
 So I think you said meth as well.

1:47:06.580 --> 1:47:09.820
 So cocaine, is there some interesting characteristics

1:47:09.820 --> 1:47:12.020
 about decision making that these drugs alter

1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:14.620
 versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?

1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:16.740
 I think, and there's much more to study with this,

1:47:16.740 --> 1:47:20.460
 but I think the biggie there is that the stimulants,

1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:23.420
 they create risky sex by really increasing

1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:26.260
 the rewarding value of sex.

1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:27.660
 Like if you talk to people that are really,

1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:30.420
 especially that are hooked on stimulants,

1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:33.580
 one of the biggies is like sex on coke or meth

1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:35.940
 is like so much better than sex without.

1:47:35.940 --> 1:47:38.900
 And that's a big part of why they have trouble quitting

1:47:38.900 --> 1:47:41.740
 because it's so tied to their sex life.

1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:44.300
 So it's not that your decision making is broken,

1:47:44.300 --> 1:47:46.780
 it's just that you, well, you allocate.

1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:48.500
 It's a different aspect of their decision.

1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:49.820
 Yeah, on the reward side.

1:47:49.820 --> 1:47:52.380
 I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition.

1:47:52.380 --> 1:47:56.820
 It's like, alcohol is really good at reducing the ability

1:47:56.820 --> 1:48:00.260
 of a delayed punisher to have an effect on current behavior.

1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:02.020
 In other words, there's this bad thing

1:48:02.020 --> 1:48:04.220
 that's gonna happen tomorrow or a week from now

1:48:04.220 --> 1:48:06.140
 or 20 years from now.

1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:09.220
 Being drunk is a really good way,

1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.540
 and you see this in like rats making decisions.

1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.580
 A high dose of alcohol makes someone less sensitive

1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:16.700
 to those consequences.

1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:20.180
 So I think that's the lever that's being hit with alcohol

1:48:20.180 --> 1:48:23.100
 and it's the more, just the increasing the rewarding value

1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:26.980
 of sex by the psycho stimulants on that side.

1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:28.940
 We actually found that it, and it was amazing

1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:31.140
 because like hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent

1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:35.980
 by NIH to study the connection between cocaine and HIV.

1:48:35.980 --> 1:48:38.580
 Like we ran the first study on my grant

1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:41.860
 that like actually just gave people cocaine

1:48:41.860 --> 1:48:44.060
 under double blind conditions and showed that like,

1:48:44.060 --> 1:48:45.620
 yeah, when people are on coke,

1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:48.540
 like their ratings of sexual desire,

1:48:48.540 --> 1:48:50.420
 even though they're not in a sexual situation,

1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:51.500
 yeah, you've shown them some pictures,

1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.340
 but they're just saying they're horny.

1:48:53.340 --> 1:48:54.540
 Like you get subjective ratings

1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:57.700
 of like how much sexual desire are you feeling right now.

1:48:57.700 --> 1:49:00.460
 People get horny when they're on stimulants.

1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:03.340
 And a lot of people say, duh,

1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:04.780
 if they really know these drugs.

1:49:04.780 --> 1:49:06.940
 But that's a rigorous study that's in the lab

1:49:06.940 --> 1:49:09.660
 that shows like there's a plot.

1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:12.580
 Right, the dose effects of that, the time course of that.

1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:13.420
 Yeah, it's not just.

1:49:13.420 --> 1:49:16.020
 Can you please tell me there's a paper with a plot

1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:21.020
 that shows dose versus evaluation of like horniness.

1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:22.420
 Yeah, we didn't say horniness.

1:49:22.420 --> 1:49:24.860
 We said sexual arousal, yeah, basically, yeah.

1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:26.580
 There's a plot, I'm gonna find this plot.

1:49:26.580 --> 1:49:27.700
 Right, I'll send it to you.

1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:32.260
 There was one headline from some publicity on the work

1:49:32.260 --> 1:49:36.420
 that said, horny cocaine users don't use condoms

1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:38.260
 or something like that.

1:49:38.260 --> 1:49:39.380
 You gotta love journalism.

1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:41.620
 I wouldn't have put it that way, but like, yeah, that's right.

1:49:41.620 --> 1:49:43.780
 I guess that's what it finds.

1:49:43.780 --> 1:49:47.980
 So you've published a bunch of studies on psychedelics.

1:49:47.980 --> 1:49:52.980
 Is there some especially favorite insightful findings

1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:55.220
 from some of these that you could talk about?

1:49:55.220 --> 1:49:58.380
 So maybe favorite studies or just something

1:49:58.380 --> 1:50:02.020
 that pops to mind in terms of both the goals

1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:04.740
 and like the major insights gained

1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:07.620
 and maybe the side little curiosities

1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:09.500
 that you discovered along the way.

1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:12.940
 Yeah, I think of the work with like using psilocybin

1:50:12.940 --> 1:50:14.420
 to help people quit smoking.

1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:19.420
 And we've talked about smoking being such a serious addiction

1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:23.100
 and so that what inspired me to get into that

1:50:23.100 --> 1:50:26.060
 was just kind of having like behavioral psychology

1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:31.060
 as my primary lens, sort of this sort of like,

1:50:32.340 --> 1:50:36.700
 you know, kind of radical empirical basis of,

1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:40.220
 I'm really interested in the mystical experience

1:50:40.220 --> 1:50:44.180
 and all of these reports, very interested.

1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:47.500
 And, but at the same time, I'm like, okay,

1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:50.500
 let's get down to some behavior change

1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:52.140
 and something that we can record,

1:50:52.140 --> 1:50:55.580
 like quantitatively verify biologically.

1:50:55.580 --> 1:50:58.180
 So find all kinds of negative behaviors

1:50:58.180 --> 1:51:01.420
 that people practice and see if we can turn those

1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:02.900
 into positive or change their behavior.

1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:05.300
 Right, like really change it, not just people saying,

1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:07.140
 which again is interesting, I'm not dismissing it,

1:51:07.140 --> 1:51:09.180
 but folks that say my life has turned around,

1:51:09.180 --> 1:51:11.180
 I feel this has completely changed me.

1:51:11.180 --> 1:51:13.620
 It's like, yep, that's good.

1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.500
 All right, let's see if we can harness that and test that.

1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:20.740
 And just something that's real behavior change.

1:51:20.740 --> 1:51:21.580
 You know what I mean?

1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:22.420
 It's quantifiable.

1:51:22.420 --> 1:51:25.260
 It's like, okay, you've been smoking for 30 years,

1:51:25.260 --> 1:51:26.900
 you know, like that's a real thing.

1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.660
 And you've tried a dozen times, like seriously to quit

1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:32.860
 and you haven't been able to long term, like, okay.

1:51:32.860 --> 1:51:35.900
 And if you quit, like we'll ask you and I'll believe you,

1:51:35.900 --> 1:51:38.460
 but I don't trust everyone reading the paper to believe you.

1:51:38.460 --> 1:51:40.900
 So we're gonna have you pee in a cup and we'll test that.

1:51:40.900 --> 1:51:42.340
 And we'll have you blow into this little machine

1:51:42.340 --> 1:51:44.820
 that measures carbon monoxide and we'll test that.

1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:48.220
 So multiple levels of biological verification.

1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:50.340
 Like now we're getting like,

1:51:50.340 --> 1:51:51.900
 to me that's where the rubber meets the road

1:51:51.900 --> 1:51:53.460
 in terms of like therapeutics.

1:51:53.460 --> 1:51:55.580
 It's like, can we really shift behavior?

1:51:55.580 --> 1:51:58.540
 And since, and so much as we've talked about

1:51:58.540 --> 1:52:00.380
 my other scientific work outside of psychedelics

1:52:00.380 --> 1:52:02.940
 is about understanding addiction and drug use.

1:52:02.940 --> 1:52:04.580
 So it's like, you know, looking at addiction,

1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:07.260
 it's a no brainer and smoking is just a great example.

1:52:07.260 --> 1:52:08.940
 And so back to your question,

1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:11.020
 like we've had really high success rates.

1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:14.220
 I mean, it really, it rivals anything that's been published

1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:15.720
 in the scientific literature.

1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:18.340
 The caveat is that, you know,

1:52:18.340 --> 1:52:20.940
 that's based on our initial trial of only 15 people,

1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:23.460
 but extremely high longterm success rates,

1:52:24.300 --> 1:52:27.420
 80% at six months per smoke free.

1:52:27.420 --> 1:52:29.340
 So can we discuss the details of this?

1:52:29.340 --> 1:52:31.780
 So first of all, which psychedelic are we talking about?

1:52:31.780 --> 1:52:34.340
 And maybe can you talk about the 15 people

1:52:34.340 --> 1:52:37.220
 and how the study ran and what you found?

1:52:37.220 --> 1:52:38.060
 Yeah, yeah.

1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:40.780
 So the drug we're using is psilocybin

1:52:40.780 --> 1:52:45.780
 and we're using moderately high and high doses of psilocybin.

1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:47.840
 And I should say this about most of our work,

1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:50.540
 these are not kind of museum level doses.

1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:51.940
 In other words, nothing,

1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:53.740
 even big fans of psychedelics wanna take

1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:57.280
 and go to a concert or go to the museum.

1:52:57.280 --> 1:52:59.340
 If someone's at Burning Man on this type of dose,

1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:02.380
 like they're probably gonna wanna find their way back

1:53:02.380 --> 1:53:04.260
 to their tent and zip up and hunker down

1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:07.940
 for, you know, not be around strangers.

1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:10.900
 By the way, the delivery method,

1:53:10.900 --> 1:53:14.660
 so psilocybin is mushrooms, I guess.

1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:19.100
 What's the usual, is it edible?

1:53:19.100 --> 1:53:20.380
 Is there some other way?

1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:21.780
 Like, how is people supposed to think

1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:25.100
 about the correct dosing of these things?

1:53:25.100 --> 1:53:28.240
 Cause I've heard that it's hard to dose correctly.

1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:30.420
 That's right.

1:53:30.420 --> 1:53:33.620
 So in our studies, we use the pure compound psilocybin.

1:53:33.620 --> 1:53:36.700
 So it's a single molecule, you know, a bunch of molecules.

1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:40.260
 And we give them a capsule with that in it.

1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:44.840
 And so it's just, you know, a little capsule, they swallow.

1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:49.840
 What people, when psilocybin is used outside of research,

1:53:49.900 --> 1:53:51.900
 it's always in the context of mushrooms

1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:54.100
 cause they're so easy to grow.

1:53:54.100 --> 1:53:56.220
 There's no market for synthetic psilocybin.

1:53:56.220 --> 1:53:58.060
 There's no reason for that to pop up.

1:53:58.060 --> 1:54:03.060
 The high dose that we use in research is 30 milligrams,

1:54:08.860 --> 1:54:10.060
 body weight adjusted.

1:54:10.060 --> 1:54:11.180
 So if you're a heavier person,

1:54:11.180 --> 1:54:14.580
 it might be like 40 or even 50 milligrams.

1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:18.420
 We have some data that, based on that data,

1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:20.140
 we're actually moving into like getting away

1:54:20.140 --> 1:54:22.400
 from the body weight adjusting of the dose

1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:23.660
 and just giving an absolute dose.

1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:25.040
 It seems like there's no justification

1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:28.140
 for the body weight based dosing, but I digress.

1:54:29.060 --> 1:54:32.860
 Generally 30, 40 milligrams, it's a high dose.

1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:34.940
 And based on average, even though, as you alluded to,

1:54:34.940 --> 1:54:37.820
 there's variability, which gets people into some trouble

1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:40.460
 in terms of mushrooms, like psilocybe cubensis,

1:54:40.460 --> 1:54:42.500
 which is the most common species

1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:44.940
 in the illicit market in the US.

1:54:44.940 --> 1:54:47.740
 This is about equivalent to five dried grams,

1:54:47.740 --> 1:54:51.860
 which is right at about where McKenna and others,

1:54:51.860 --> 1:54:55.580
 they call it a heroic dose.

1:54:55.580 --> 1:54:57.400
 This is not hanging out with your friends,

1:54:57.400 --> 1:54:59.200
 going to the concert again.

1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:03.260
 So this is a real deal dose, even to people that really,

1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:05.060
 just even to psychonauts.

1:55:05.060 --> 1:55:06.700
 And we've even had a number of studies.

1:55:06.700 --> 1:55:07.540
 Psychonauts?

1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:11.140
 Yeah, people that, yeah, astronaut or cosmonaut,

1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:14.380
 like for psychedelics.

1:55:14.380 --> 1:55:16.060
 Yeah, going as far out as possible.

1:55:16.060 --> 1:55:19.260
 But even for them, even for those

1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:21.140
 who've flown to space before.

1:55:21.140 --> 1:55:22.620
 Right, right, they're like, holy shit,

1:55:22.620 --> 1:55:25.820
 I didn't know the orbit would be that far out.

1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:30.300
 Or I escaped the orbit, I was in interplanetary space there.

1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:34.020
 So these folks, the 15 folks in the study,

1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:38.420
 there's not a question of dose being too low

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.220
 to truly have an impact.

1:55:40.220 --> 1:55:43.140
 Right, right, out of hundreds of volunteers over the years,

1:55:43.140 --> 1:55:44.740
 we've only seen a couple of people

1:55:44.740 --> 1:55:48.660
 where there was a mild effect of the 30 milligrams.

1:55:48.660 --> 1:55:51.500
 And who knows, that person's, their serotonins,

1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:53.500
 they might have lesser density

1:55:53.500 --> 1:55:56.380
 of serotonin 2A receptors or something, we don't know.

1:55:56.380 --> 1:55:57.500
 But it's extremely rare.

1:55:57.500 --> 1:56:00.700
 For most people, this is like something interesting

1:56:00.700 --> 1:56:01.540
 is gonna happen, put it that way.

1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:04.380
 Speaking of Joe Rogan, I think that Jamie,

1:56:04.380 --> 1:56:09.380
 his producer, is immune to psychedelics.

1:56:09.580 --> 1:56:13.020
 So maybe he's a good recruit for the study to test.

1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:13.860
 So that's interesting.

1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:16.060
 Now I'm not, the caveat is I'm not encouraging

1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:19.140
 anything illicit, but just theoretically,

1:56:19.140 --> 1:56:21.780
 my first question as a behavioral pharmacologist

1:56:21.780 --> 1:56:23.540
 is like, you know, increase the dose.

1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:26.260
 You know, like really, let's see the full dose.

1:56:26.260 --> 1:56:27.740
 I'm not telling him, Jamie, to do that,

1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:30.180
 but like, okay, like, you know,

1:56:30.180 --> 1:56:31.180
 you're taking the same amount

1:56:31.180 --> 1:56:33.020
 that friends might be taking, but yeah.

1:56:33.020 --> 1:56:35.900
 But he was also referring to the psychedelic effects

1:56:35.900 --> 1:56:38.700
 of edible marijuana, which is,

1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:46.420
 is there rules on dosage for like marijuana?

1:56:46.420 --> 1:56:47.700
 Is there limits?

1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:50.500
 Like what place where it's, this is, this all goes,

1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:52.060
 it probably is state by state, right?

1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:54.460
 It is, but most, they've gone that direction

1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:56.780
 in states that didn't initially have these rules

1:56:56.780 --> 1:56:57.860
 have now have them.

1:56:57.860 --> 1:56:59.500
 So it was like, you'll get, I think, you know,

1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:04.100
 five, 10 mil, I think 10, five or 10 milligrams of THC

1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:07.980
 being a common, and like, and this is an important thing,

1:57:07.980 --> 1:57:10.300
 like where they've moved from not being allowed to say,

1:57:10.300 --> 1:57:11.580
 like have a whole candy bar

1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:13.940
 and have each of the eight or 10 squares

1:57:13.940 --> 1:57:16.260
 on the candy bar being 10 milligrams,

1:57:16.260 --> 1:57:17.580
 but it's like, no, the whole thing,

1:57:17.580 --> 1:57:19.180
 because like, you know, someone gets a candy bar,

1:57:19.180 --> 1:57:20.900
 they're eating the freaking candy bar.

1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:24.100
 And it's like, unless you're a daily cannabis user,

1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:26.220
 if you take, you know, a hundred milligrams,

1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:30.940
 it's like, that's what could lead to a bad trip for someone.

1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:32.420
 And it's like, you know, a lot of these people,

1:57:32.420 --> 1:57:35.220
 it's like, oh, you used to smoke a little weed in college,

1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:37.460
 they might say they're visiting Denver

1:57:37.460 --> 1:57:39.060
 for a business trip and they're like, why not?

1:57:39.060 --> 1:57:40.340
 Let's give it a shot, you know?

1:57:40.340 --> 1:57:41.900
 And they're like, oh, I don't want to smoke something

1:57:41.900 --> 1:57:43.620
 because it's going to, so I'm going to be safer

1:57:43.620 --> 1:57:47.020
 with this edible, they might consume this massive,

1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:48.780
 you know, but there's huge tolerance.

1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:52.260
 So a regular, like for someone who's smoking weed every day,

1:57:52.260 --> 1:57:53.660
 they might take five milligrams

1:57:53.660 --> 1:57:55.660
 and kind of hardly feel anything.

1:57:55.660 --> 1:58:00.660
 And they may really need something like 30, 40, 50 milligrams

1:58:00.940 --> 1:58:02.180
 to have a strong effect.

1:58:02.180 --> 1:58:06.180
 But yeah, so they've evolved in terms of the rules

1:58:06.180 --> 1:58:11.140
 about like, okay, what constitutes a dose, you know?

1:58:11.140 --> 1:58:13.300
 Which is why you see less big candy bars and more,

1:58:13.300 --> 1:58:15.380
 or if it is a whole candy bar,

1:58:15.380 --> 1:58:17.980
 you're only getting a smaller dose like 10 milligrams or,

1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:20.460
 yeah, because that's where people get in trouble

1:58:20.460 --> 1:58:22.380
 more often with edibles.

1:58:22.380 --> 1:58:25.860
 Yeah, except Joey Diaz, which I've heard.

1:58:25.860 --> 1:58:27.500
 That's definitely somebody I want to talk to

1:58:27.500 --> 1:58:30.100
 out of the crazy comedians I want to talk to as well.

1:58:30.100 --> 1:58:33.660
 Anyway, so yeah, the study of the 15

1:58:33.660 --> 1:58:36.100
 and the dose not being a question.

1:58:36.100 --> 1:58:39.140
 So like, what was the recruitment based on?

1:58:39.140 --> 1:58:44.140
 What was the, like, how did the study get conducted?

1:58:44.460 --> 1:58:46.980
 Yeah, so the recruitment, and I really liked this fact,

1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:49.980
 it wasn't people that, you know, largely were, you know,

1:58:49.980 --> 1:58:51.620
 we were honest about what we were studying,

1:58:51.620 --> 1:58:53.660
 but for most people, it was,

1:58:53.660 --> 1:58:56.220
 they were in the category of like, you know,

1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.380
 not particularly interested in psychedelics,

1:58:58.380 --> 1:59:00.860
 but more of like, they want to quit smoking.

1:59:00.860 --> 1:59:03.700
 They've tried everything but the kitchen sink.

1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:05.500
 And this sounds like the kitchen sink.

1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:08.340
 You know, and it's like, well, it's Hopkins.

1:59:08.340 --> 1:59:11.780
 So, you know, thinking that sounds like it's safe enough.

1:59:11.780 --> 1:59:13.620
 So like, what the hell, let's give it a shot.

1:59:13.620 --> 1:59:15.900
 Like most of them were in that category,

1:59:15.900 --> 1:59:19.820
 which I really, you know, I appreciate

1:59:19.820 --> 1:59:24.820
 because it's more of a test, you know, of, yeah,

1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:26.980
 just like a better model of what,

1:59:26.980 --> 1:59:29.020
 if these are approved as medicines,

1:59:29.020 --> 1:59:31.460
 like what you're going to have the average participant,

1:59:31.460 --> 1:59:34.180
 you know, be like.

1:59:34.180 --> 1:59:37.540
 And so the therapy involves a good amount

1:59:37.540 --> 1:59:41.300
 of non psilocybin sessions, of preparatory sessions,

1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:44.180
 like eight hours of getting to know the person,

1:59:44.180 --> 1:59:45.980
 like the two people who are going to be their guides

1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:48.780
 or the person in the room with them during the experience,

1:59:50.220 --> 1:59:52.140
 having these discussions with them

1:59:52.140 --> 1:59:53.820
 where you're both kind of rapport building,

1:59:53.820 --> 1:59:56.780
 just kind of discussing their life, getting to know them,

1:59:56.780 --> 1:59:58.980
 but then also telling them, preparing them

1:59:58.980 --> 2:00:01.460
 about the psilocybin experience.

2:00:01.460 --> 2:00:03.020
 Oh, it could be scary in this sense,

2:00:03.020 --> 2:00:05.780
 but here's how to handle it, trust, let go, be open.

2:00:05.780 --> 2:00:08.540
 And also during that preparation time,

2:00:08.540 --> 2:00:09.820
 preparing them to quit smoking,

2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:12.220
 using really standard bread and butter techniques

2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:15.180
 that can all fall under the label typically

2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:16.860
 of the cognitive behavioral therapy,

2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:19.820
 just stuff like before you quit,

2:00:19.820 --> 2:00:22.660
 we assign a target quit date ahead of time,

2:00:22.660 --> 2:00:24.460
 you're not just quitting on the fly.

2:00:24.460 --> 2:00:26.660
 And that happens to be the target quit date

2:00:26.660 --> 2:00:27.900
 in our study was the day

2:00:27.900 --> 2:00:29.780
 where they got the first psilocybin dose,

2:00:29.780 --> 2:00:31.700
 but doing things like keeping a smoking diary,

2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:34.700
 like, okay, during the three weeks until you quit,

2:00:34.700 --> 2:00:35.740
 every time you smoke a cigarette,

2:00:35.740 --> 2:00:37.380
 just like jot down what you're doing,

2:00:37.380 --> 2:00:39.860
 what you're feeling, what situation, that type of thing.

2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:41.540
 And then having some discussion around that

2:00:41.540 --> 2:00:44.420
 and then going over the pluses and minuses in their life

2:00:44.420 --> 2:00:45.780
 that smoking kind of comes with

2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:47.900
 and being honest about the, this is what it does for me,

2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:50.140
 this is why I like it, this is why I don't like it.

2:00:50.140 --> 2:00:53.780
 Preparing for like, what if you do slip, how to handle it,

2:00:53.780 --> 2:00:54.820
 like don't dwell on guilt

2:00:54.820 --> 2:00:57.860
 because that leads to more full on relapse,

2:00:57.860 --> 2:00:59.540
 just kind of treat it as a learning experience,

2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:00.380
 that type of thing.

2:01:00.380 --> 2:01:03.580
 Then you have the session day where they come in,

2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:07.540
 five minutes of questionnaires,

2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:09.180
 but pretty much they jump into the,

2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:13.900
 we touch base with them and we give them the capsule.

2:01:13.900 --> 2:01:17.460
 It's a serious setting, but a comfortable one.

2:01:17.460 --> 2:01:19.460
 They're in a room that looks more like a living room

2:01:19.460 --> 2:01:21.100
 than like a research lab.

2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:22.860
 We measure their blood pressure, their experience,

2:01:22.860 --> 2:01:25.620
 but kind of minimal kind of medical vibe to it.

2:01:25.620 --> 2:01:28.860
 And they lay down on a couch

2:01:28.860 --> 2:01:32.020
 and it's a purposefully an introspective experience.

2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:33.140
 So they're laying on a couch

2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:36.340
 during most of the five to six hour experience

2:01:36.340 --> 2:01:38.060
 and they're wearing eye shades,

2:01:38.060 --> 2:01:40.860
 which is a better connotation as a name than blindfold.

2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:42.820
 But like, yeah, so they're wearing eye shades,

2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:45.340
 but that's, and they're wearing headphones

2:01:45.340 --> 2:01:49.060
 through which music is played, mostly classical,

2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:50.540
 although we've done some variation of that.

2:01:50.540 --> 2:01:52.020
 I have a paper that was recently accepted

2:01:52.020 --> 2:01:54.500
 kind of comparing it to more like gongs

2:01:54.500 --> 2:01:57.860
 and harmonic bowls and that type of thing,

2:01:57.860 --> 2:02:00.900
 kind of like sound, you know, kind of.

2:02:00.900 --> 2:02:04.340
 You've also added this to the science

2:02:04.340 --> 2:02:07.220
 and have a paper on the musical accompaniment

2:02:07.220 --> 2:02:09.180
 to the psychedelic experience, that's fascinating.

2:02:09.180 --> 2:02:12.220
 Right, and we found basically that about the same effect,

2:02:12.220 --> 2:02:13.980
 even by a trend, not significant,

2:02:13.980 --> 2:02:15.260
 but a little bit better of an effect,

2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:19.020
 both in terms of subjective experience and longterm,

2:02:19.020 --> 2:02:20.660
 whether it helped people quit smoking,

2:02:20.660 --> 2:02:22.700
 just a little tiny non significant trend

2:02:22.700 --> 2:02:25.980
 even favoring the novel playlist

2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:28.940
 with the Tibetan singing bowls and the gongs

2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:30.620
 and didgeridoo and all of that.

2:02:30.620 --> 2:02:33.340
 And so anyway, just saying, okay,

2:02:33.340 --> 2:02:35.460
 we can deviate a little bit from this,

2:02:35.460 --> 2:02:37.980
 like what goes back to the 1950s of this method

2:02:37.980 --> 2:02:41.100
 of using classical music as part of this psychedelic therapy,

2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:42.300
 but they're listening to the music

2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:44.380
 and they're not playing DJ in real time.

2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:46.780
 You know, it's like, you know, they're just,

2:02:46.780 --> 2:02:49.580
 be the baby, you're not the decision maker for today,

2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:51.740
 go inward, trust, let go, be open.

2:02:51.740 --> 2:02:53.460
 And pretty much the only interaction,

2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:56.300
 like that we're there for is to deal

2:02:56.300 --> 2:02:57.620
 with any anxiety that comes up.

2:02:57.620 --> 2:03:00.500
 So guide is kind of a misnomer in a sense.

2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:02.700
 It's, we're more of a safety net.

2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:05.020
 And so like, tell us if you feel some butterflies

2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:06.220
 that we can provide reassurance,

2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:09.140
 a hold of their hand can be very powerful.

2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:10.980
 I've had people tell me that that was like the thing

2:03:10.980 --> 2:03:12.580
 that really just grounded them.

2:03:12.580 --> 2:03:15.620
 Can you break apart trust, let go, be open?

2:03:17.340 --> 2:03:21.420
 What, so in a sense,

2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.500
 how would you describe the experience,

2:03:25.540 --> 2:03:29.300
 the intellectual and the emotional approach

2:03:29.300 --> 2:03:30.660
 that people are supposed to take

2:03:30.660 --> 2:03:34.260
 to really let go into the experience?

2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:40.420
 Yeah, so trust is, trust the context,

2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:41.900
 you know, trust the guides,

2:03:41.900 --> 2:03:45.140
 trust the overall institutional context.

2:03:45.140 --> 2:03:47.220
 I see it as layers of like safety,

2:03:47.220 --> 2:03:48.460
 even though it's everything I told you

2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:51.100
 about the relative bodily safety of psilocybin.

2:03:51.100 --> 2:03:52.700
 Nonetheless, we're still getting blood pressure

2:03:52.700 --> 2:03:54.660
 throughout the session, just in case.

2:03:54.660 --> 2:03:57.940
 We have a physician on hand who can respond just in case.

2:03:57.940 --> 2:03:59.260
 We're literally across the street

2:03:59.260 --> 2:04:01.460
 from the emergency department, just in case.

2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:02.900
 You know, all of that, you know.

2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.940
 Privacy is another thing you've talked about

2:04:04.940 --> 2:04:07.140
 is just trusting that you're,

2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:09.300
 and whatever happens is just between you

2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:10.900
 and the people in the study.

2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:13.340
 Right, and hopefully they've really gotten that

2:04:13.340 --> 2:04:14.820
 by that point deep into the study

2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:17.140
 that like they realize where do we take that seriously

2:04:17.140 --> 2:04:18.380
 and everything else, you know.

2:04:18.380 --> 2:04:20.220
 And so it's really kind of like a very special role

2:04:20.220 --> 2:04:22.780
 that you're playing as a researcher or a guide

2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:25.900
 and hopefully they have your trust.

2:04:25.900 --> 2:04:28.180
 And so, you know, and trust that they could be as emotional,

2:04:28.180 --> 2:04:29.700
 everything from laughter to tears,

2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:30.860
 like that's gonna be welcomed.

2:04:30.860 --> 2:04:31.780
 We're not judging them.

2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:33.700
 It's like, it's a therapeutic relationship

2:04:33.700 --> 2:04:36.460
 where, you know, this is a safe container.

2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:37.540
 It's a safe space.

2:04:37.540 --> 2:04:39.140
 It's a lot of baggage to that term,

2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:42.460
 but it truly is, it's a safe space for that,

2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:45.620
 for this type of experience and to let go.

2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:48.340
 So trust, let's see, let go.

2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:50.540
 So that relates to the emotional, like,

2:04:50.540 --> 2:04:52.940
 you feel like crying, cry.

2:04:52.940 --> 2:04:55.980
 You feel like laughing your ass off, laugh your ass off.

2:04:55.980 --> 2:04:58.140
 You know, it's like all the things actually

2:04:58.140 --> 2:04:59.900
 that sometimes it's more challenging

2:04:59.900 --> 2:05:02.540
 with someone has a large recreational use,

2:05:02.540 --> 2:05:03.540
 sometimes it's harder for them

2:05:03.540 --> 2:05:07.340
 because people in that context, and understandably so,

2:05:07.340 --> 2:05:09.380
 it's more about holding your shit.

2:05:09.380 --> 2:05:12.480
 Someone's had a bunch of mushrooms at a party.

2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:15.020
 Maybe they don't wanna go into the back room

2:05:15.020 --> 2:05:17.380
 and start crying about these thoughts

2:05:17.380 --> 2:05:19.500
 about the relationship with their mother.

2:05:19.500 --> 2:05:22.620
 And they don't wanna be the drama queen or king

2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:23.860
 that bring their friends down

2:05:23.860 --> 2:05:26.340
 because their friends are having an experience too.

2:05:26.340 --> 2:05:29.060
 And so they wanna like compose, you know.

2:05:29.060 --> 2:05:31.440
 And also just the appearance in social settings

2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:34.980
 versus the, so like prioritizing how you appear to others

2:05:34.980 --> 2:05:39.420
 versus the prioritizing the depth of the experience.

2:05:39.420 --> 2:05:42.700
 And here in the study, you can prioritize the experience.

2:05:42.700 --> 2:05:44.980
 Right, and it's all about, like you're the astronaut

2:05:44.980 --> 2:05:46.820
 and there's only one astronaut.

2:05:46.820 --> 2:05:48.100
 We're ground control.

2:05:48.100 --> 2:05:49.660
 And I use this often with,

2:05:50.620 --> 2:05:53.580
 I have a photo of the space shuttle on a plaque

2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:56.720
 in my office and I kind of often use that as an example.

2:05:56.720 --> 2:05:58.340
 And it's like, we're here for you.

2:05:58.340 --> 2:06:00.300
 Like we're a team, but we have different roles.

2:06:00.300 --> 2:06:04.140
 It's just like, you don't have to like compose yourself.

2:06:04.140 --> 2:06:07.340
 Like you don't have to like be concerned about our safety.

2:06:07.340 --> 2:06:09.500
 Like we're playing these roles today.

2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:12.400
 And like, yeah, your job is to go as deep as possible

2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:16.140
 or as far out, whatever your analogy is, like as possible.

2:06:16.140 --> 2:06:18.820
 And we're keeping you safe.

2:06:18.820 --> 2:06:23.580
 And so, yeah, and the emotional side is a hard one

2:06:23.580 --> 2:06:25.340
 because you really want people to,

2:06:25.340 --> 2:06:28.180
 like if they go into realms of subjectively

2:06:28.180 --> 2:06:33.180
 of despair and sorrow, like, yeah, like cry, it's okay.

2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:37.120
 And especially if someone's more macho

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:41.420
 and you want this to be the place where they can let go.

2:06:41.420 --> 2:06:44.540
 And again, something that they wouldn't or shouldn't do

2:06:44.540 --> 2:06:46.700
 if someone were to theoretically use it

2:06:46.700 --> 2:06:49.980
 in a social setting.

2:06:49.980 --> 2:06:51.700
 And like, and also these other things,

2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:54.260
 like even that you get in those social settings of like,

2:06:54.260 --> 2:06:56.660
 yeah, you don't have to like worry about your wallet

2:06:56.660 --> 2:06:59.240
 for being taken advantage or especially for a woman

2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:02.620
 sexually assaulted by some creep at a concert or something.

2:07:02.620 --> 2:07:05.480
 Cause they're, you know, they're laying down,

2:07:05.480 --> 2:07:06.320
 being far out.

2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:08.380
 There's like a million sources of anxiety

2:07:08.380 --> 2:07:11.420
 that are external versus internal.

2:07:11.420 --> 2:07:12.920
 So you can just focus on your own,

2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:16.420
 like the beautiful thing that's going on in your mind.

2:07:16.420 --> 2:07:18.340
 And even the cops at that layer,

2:07:18.340 --> 2:07:21.820
 even though it's extremely unlikely for most people

2:07:21.820 --> 2:07:23.820
 that cops would come in and bust them right when,

2:07:23.820 --> 2:07:25.220
 like even at that theoretical,

2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:26.900
 like that one in a billion chance,

2:07:26.900 --> 2:07:29.420
 like that might be a real thing psychologically.

2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:31.380
 In this context, we even got that covered.

2:07:31.380 --> 2:07:33.460
 This is, we've got DEA approval.

2:07:33.460 --> 2:07:37.220
 Like you are, this is okay by every level of society

2:07:37.220 --> 2:07:39.980
 that counts, you know, that has the authority.

2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:43.620
 So it's, so go deep, trust the, you know, trust the setting,

2:07:43.620 --> 2:07:48.020
 trust yourself, you know, let go and be open.

2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:50.500
 So in the experience, and this is all subjective

2:07:50.500 --> 2:07:54.100
 and by analogy, but like, if there's a door, open it,

2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:54.940
 go into it.

2:07:54.940 --> 2:07:59.940
 If there's a stairwell, go down it or a stairway, go up it.

2:07:59.980 --> 2:08:03.220
 If there's a monster in the mind's eye, you know,

2:08:03.220 --> 2:08:07.380
 don't run, approach it, look in the eye and say, you know,

2:08:07.380 --> 2:08:08.220
 let's talk.

2:08:08.220 --> 2:08:10.900
 Yeah, what's up, what are you doing here?

2:08:10.900 --> 2:08:12.620
 Let's talk Turkey, you know?

2:08:12.620 --> 2:08:13.460
 And I thought.

2:08:13.460 --> 2:08:14.820
 Dave Goggins entered the chat, okay.

2:08:14.820 --> 2:08:16.380
 Right, right, it really is that,

2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:19.780
 that really is a heart of it, this radical courage.

2:08:19.780 --> 2:08:20.940
 Like it. Courage.

2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:22.660
 People are often struck by that coming out.

2:08:22.660 --> 2:08:25.480
 Like this is heavy lifting, this is a hard work.

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:30.160
 People come out of this exhausted and it can be extremely,

2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:31.960
 some people say it's the most difficult thing

2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:33.380
 they've done in their life.

2:08:33.380 --> 2:08:36.160
 Like choosing to let go on a moment,

2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:39.740
 a microsecond by microsecond basis.

2:08:39.740 --> 2:08:42.940
 Everything in their inclination is to say stop,

2:08:42.940 --> 2:08:45.020
 sometimes stop this, I don't like this,

2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:48.160
 I didn't know it was gonna be like this, this is too much.

2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:49.840
 And Terrence McKenna put it this way,

2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:52.740
 it's like comparing to meditation and other techniques,

2:08:52.740 --> 2:08:55.960
 it's like spending years trying to press the accelerator

2:08:55.960 --> 2:08:57.460
 to make something happen.

2:08:57.460 --> 2:08:59.660
 High dose psychedelics is like you're speeding down

2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:03.200
 the mountain in a fully loaded semi truck

2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:06.380
 and you're charged with not slamming the brake.

2:09:06.380 --> 2:09:09.820
 It's like, let it happen.

2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:12.300
 So it's very difficult and to engage,

2:09:12.300 --> 2:09:16.500
 always go further into it and take that radical,

2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:19.260
 radical courage throughout.

2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:22.580
 What do they say in self report?

2:09:22.580 --> 2:09:24.580
 If you can put general words to it,

2:09:24.580 --> 2:09:26.180
 what is their experience like?

2:09:26.180 --> 2:09:27.820
 What do they say it's like?

2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:29.400
 Because these are many people, like you said,

2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:32.980
 that haven't probably read much about psychedelics

2:09:32.980 --> 2:09:35.000
 or they don't have like with Joe Rogan,

2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:39.020
 like language or stories to put on it.

2:09:39.020 --> 2:09:43.700
 So this is very raw self report of experiences.

2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:45.860
 What do they say the experience is like?

2:09:45.860 --> 2:09:47.540
 Yeah, and some more so than others,

2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:50.180
 cause everyone has been exposed at some level or another,

2:09:50.180 --> 2:09:53.160
 but some it is pretty superficial as you're saying.

2:09:55.500 --> 2:09:57.020
 One of the hallmarks of psychedelics

2:09:57.020 --> 2:09:58.460
 is just their variability.

2:09:58.460 --> 2:10:00.060
 So I'm more stressed, it's like not the mean,

2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:03.420
 but the standard deviation is so wide that it's like,

2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:07.140
 it could be like hellish experiences

2:10:07.140 --> 2:10:12.140
 and just absolutely beautiful and loving experiences,

2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:17.420
 everything in between and both of those,

2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:20.340
 like those could be two minutes apart from each other.

2:10:20.340 --> 2:10:24.040
 And sometimes kind of at the same time concurrently.

2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:28.180
 So let's see, there's different ways to,

2:10:28.180 --> 2:10:31.820
 there were some Jungian psychologists back in the 60s,

2:10:31.820 --> 2:10:34.060
 masters in Houston that wrote a really good book,

2:10:34.060 --> 2:10:36.340
 The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience,

2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:39.300
 which is a play on varieties of religious experience

2:10:39.300 --> 2:10:43.460
 by William James, that they described this,

2:10:43.460 --> 2:10:44.580
 a perceptual level.

2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:47.180
 So most people have that when,

2:10:47.180 --> 2:10:49.460
 whether they're looking at the room without the eyeshades on

2:10:49.460 --> 2:10:52.640
 or inside their mind's eye with the eyeshades on,

2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:56.340
 colors, sounds like this,

2:10:56.340 --> 2:11:01.060
 it's a much richer sensorium,

2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:02.420
 which can be very interesting.

2:11:02.420 --> 2:11:04.980
 And then at another level, a master's in Houston

2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:08.020
 called it the psychodynamic level.

2:11:08.020 --> 2:11:10.660
 And I think you could think about it more broadly than,

2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:11.880
 that's kind of Jungian,

2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:14.620
 but just the personal psychological levels,

2:11:14.620 --> 2:11:17.020
 how I think of it, like this is about your life.

2:11:17.020 --> 2:11:17.980
 There's a whole life review.

2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:20.300
 Oftentimes people have thoughts about their childhood,

2:11:20.300 --> 2:11:24.340
 about their relationships, their spouse or partner,

2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:27.940
 their children, their parents, their family of origin,

2:11:27.940 --> 2:11:31.760
 their current family, that stuff comes up a lot,

2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:35.820
 including people just pouring with tears

2:11:35.820 --> 2:11:39.900
 about how much, it hits them so hard

2:11:39.900 --> 2:11:41.720
 how much they love people.

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:44.700
 Like in a way, for people that they'd love their family,

2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:49.700
 but it just hits them so hard that how important this is

2:11:50.660 --> 2:11:52.340
 and the magnitude of that love

2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:54.380
 and what that means in their life.

2:11:54.380 --> 2:11:57.140
 So those are some of the most moving experiences

2:11:57.140 --> 2:12:00.340
 to be present for is where people like it hits home,

2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.820
 like what really matters in their life.

2:12:02.820 --> 2:12:06.700
 And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston

2:12:06.700 --> 2:12:08.620
 called the archetypal realm,

2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:12.460
 which again is sort of Jungian with the focus on archetypes,

2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:13.300
 which is interesting,

2:12:13.300 --> 2:12:15.980
 but I think of that more generally as like symbolic level.

2:12:15.980 --> 2:12:19.340
 So just really deep experiences where you have,

2:12:19.340 --> 2:12:22.980
 you do have experiences that seem symbolic of,

2:12:22.980 --> 2:12:25.660
 very much in like what we know about dreaming

2:12:25.660 --> 2:12:27.420
 and what most people think about dreaming,

2:12:27.420 --> 2:12:29.560
 like there's this randomness of things,

2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.780
 but sometimes it's pretty clear in retrospect,

2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:33.460
 oh, like this came up

2:12:33.460 --> 2:12:36.960
 because this thing has been on my mind recently.

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:40.260
 So it seems to be, there seems to be this symbolic level.

2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:41.460
 And then they have this,

2:12:41.460 --> 2:12:42.980
 the last level that they describe

2:12:42.980 --> 2:12:45.460
 is the mystical integral level,

2:12:45.460 --> 2:12:48.340
 which this is where there's lots of terms for it,

2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:52.200
 but transcendental experiences, experiences of unity,

2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:56.180
 mystical type effects we often measure.

2:12:56.180 --> 2:12:57.620
 Europeans use a scale

2:12:57.620 --> 2:13:00.280
 that will refer to oceanic boundlessness.

2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:02.580
 This is all pretty much the same thing.

2:13:02.580 --> 2:13:04.860
 This is like at some sense,

2:13:04.860 --> 2:13:08.240
 the deepest level of the very sense of self

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:13.240
 seems to be dissolved, minimize, or expanded,

2:13:13.700 --> 2:13:16.140
 such that the boundaries of the self go into in here.

2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:17.580
 I think some of this is just semantics,

2:13:17.580 --> 2:13:19.820
 but whether the self is expanding

2:13:19.820 --> 2:13:21.700
 such that there's no boundary between the self

2:13:21.700 --> 2:13:24.040
 and the rest of the universe,

2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:25.900
 or whether there's no sense of self,

2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:27.200
 again, might be just semantics,

2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:30.060
 but this radical shift or sense of loss

2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:33.060
 of sense of self or self boundaries.

2:13:33.060 --> 2:13:34.900
 And that's like the most,

2:13:34.900 --> 2:13:37.060
 typically when people have that experience,

2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:40.300
 they'll often report that as being the most remarkable thing.

2:13:40.300 --> 2:13:43.420
 And this is what you don't typically get with MDMA,

2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:46.800
 these deepest levels of the nature of reality itself,

2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:48.600
 the subjectivity and objectivity,

2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:53.600
 just like the seer and the seen become one,

2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:58.460
 and it's a process, and yeah.

2:13:58.460 --> 2:14:02.660
 And they're able to bring that experience back

2:14:04.300 --> 2:14:06.620
 and be able to describe it?

2:14:06.620 --> 2:14:09.380
 Yeah, but one of the, to a degree,

2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:11.760
 but one of the hallmarks going back to William James

2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:15.560
 of describing a mystical experience is the ineffability.

2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:17.660
 And so even though it's ineffable,

2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:20.380
 people try as far as they can to describe it,

2:14:20.380 --> 2:14:22.480
 but when you get the real deal, they'll say,

2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:24.480
 and even though they say a lot of helpful things

2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:26.200
 to help you describe the landscape,

2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:28.580
 they'll say, no matter what I say,

2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:31.460
 I'm still not even coming anywhere close to what this was.

2:14:31.460 --> 2:14:34.000
 Like the language is completely failing.

2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.660
 And I like to joke that even though it's ineffable,

2:14:36.660 --> 2:14:37.620
 and we're researchers,

2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:38.940
 so we try to eff it up

2:14:38.940 --> 2:14:41.260
 by asking them to describe the experience.

2:14:41.260 --> 2:14:44.140
 I love it, it's a good one.

2:14:44.140 --> 2:14:46.320
 But to bring it back a little bit,

2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:50.340
 so for that particular study on tobacco,

2:14:50.340 --> 2:14:54.500
 what was the results, what was the conclusions

2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:59.360
 in terms of the impact of psilocybin on their addiction?

2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:01.500
 So in that pilot study, it was very small

2:15:01.500 --> 2:15:04.160
 and it wasn't a randomized study, so it was limited.

2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:06.320
 The only question we could really answer was,

2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:08.500
 is this worthy enough of followup?

2:15:08.500 --> 2:15:11.060
 And the answer to that was absolutely,

2:15:11.060 --> 2:15:12.540
 because the success rates were so high,

2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:15.980
 80% biologically confirmed successful at six months,

2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:19.580
 that held up to 60% biologically confirmed abstinent

2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:22.900
 at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall.

2:15:22.900 --> 2:15:26.340
 Yeah, and so, I mean, the best that's been reported

2:15:26.340 --> 2:15:28.340
 in the literature for smoking cessation

2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:30.580
 is in the upper 50%, and that's with not one,

2:15:30.580 --> 2:15:32.900
 but two medications for a couple of months,

2:15:32.900 --> 2:15:36.460
 followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy,

2:15:36.460 --> 2:15:38.880
 where you're coming in once a week or once every few weeks

2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:41.020
 for an entire year.

2:15:41.020 --> 2:15:44.620
 And so it was very heavy.

2:15:44.620 --> 2:15:48.020
 This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?

2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:50.020
 So this was three doses of psilocybin

2:15:50.020 --> 2:15:52.620
 over a total course, including preparation, everything,

2:15:52.620 --> 2:15:55.340
 a 15 week period, where there's mainly like,

2:15:56.380 --> 2:15:58.300
 for most part, one meeting a week,

2:15:58.300 --> 2:16:00.820
 and then the three sessions are within that.

2:16:00.820 --> 2:16:02.980
 And so it's, and we scaled that back

2:16:02.980 --> 2:16:05.540
 in the more, the study we're doing right now,

2:16:05.540 --> 2:16:06.460
 which I can tell you about,

2:16:06.460 --> 2:16:09.160
 which is a randomized controlled trial.

2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:14.160
 But it's, yeah, the original pilot study

2:16:17.740 --> 2:16:20.540
 was these 15 people.

2:16:20.540 --> 2:16:23.380
 So given the positive signal from the first study

2:16:23.380 --> 2:16:25.020
 telling us that it was a worthy pursuit,

2:16:25.020 --> 2:16:25.940
 we hustled up some money

2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:28.580
 to actually be able to afford a larger trial.

2:16:28.580 --> 2:16:30.580
 So it's randomizing 80 people

2:16:30.580 --> 2:16:33.700
 to get either one psilocybin session,

2:16:33.700 --> 2:16:36.960
 we've scaled that down from three to one,

2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:40.000
 mainly because we're doing fMRI neuroimaging

2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:40.840
 before and after,

2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:42.380
 and it made it more experimentally complex

2:16:42.380 --> 2:16:45.100
 to have multiple sessions.

2:16:45.100 --> 2:16:49.620
 But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch

2:16:49.620 --> 2:16:52.260
 using the FDA approved label,

2:16:52.260 --> 2:16:53.900
 like standard use of the nicotine patch.

2:16:53.900 --> 2:16:57.100
 So it's randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin,

2:16:57.100 --> 2:17:00.140
 one session, 40 people get nicotine patch.

2:17:00.140 --> 2:17:02.340
 And they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapy

2:17:02.340 --> 2:17:03.900
 sort of the standard talk therapy.

2:17:03.900 --> 2:17:05.400
 And we've scaled it down somewhat,

2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:07.220
 so there's less weekly meetings,

2:17:07.220 --> 2:17:09.020
 but it's within the same ballpark.

2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:10.920
 And right now we're still,

2:17:13.920 --> 2:17:16.020
 the study's still ongoing.

2:17:16.020 --> 2:17:18.460
 And in fact, we just recently started recruiting again,

2:17:18.460 --> 2:17:19.580
 we paused for COVID.

2:17:19.580 --> 2:17:21.860
 Now we're starting back up with some protections

2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:23.340
 like masks and whatnot.

2:17:23.340 --> 2:17:28.340
 But right now for the 44 people

2:17:28.620 --> 2:17:31.080
 who have gotten through the one year followup,

2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.580
 and so that includes 22 from each of the two groups,

2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:36.180
 the success rates are extremely high.

2:17:36.180 --> 2:17:37.540
 For the psilocybin group,

2:17:37.540 --> 2:17:41.300
 it's 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke free

2:17:41.300 --> 2:17:43.980
 at one year after their quit date.

2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:48.180
 And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch,

2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:51.000
 which by the way is extremely good for the nicotine patch

2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.060
 compared to previous research.

2:17:53.060 --> 2:17:56.980
 So the results could change because it's ongoing,

2:17:56.980 --> 2:17:58.260
 but we're mostly done

2:17:58.260 --> 2:18:01.380
 and it's still looking extremely positive.

2:18:01.380 --> 2:18:02.360
 So if anyone's interested,

2:18:02.360 --> 2:18:04.460
 they have to be sort of be in commuting distance

2:18:04.460 --> 2:18:06.580
 to the Baltimore area, but you know.

2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:07.420
 To participate.

2:18:07.420 --> 2:18:09.640
 Right, right, to participate.

2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.660
 This is a good moment to bring up something.

2:18:13.660 --> 2:18:17.900
 I think a lot of what you talked about is super interesting.

2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:19.940
 And I think a lot of people listening to this,

2:18:19.940 --> 2:18:24.940
 so now it's anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people

2:18:25.140 --> 2:18:27.180
 for just a regular podcast.

2:18:27.180 --> 2:18:29.420
 I know a lot of them will be very interested

2:18:29.420 --> 2:18:32.820
 in what you're saying and they're going to look you up.

2:18:32.820 --> 2:18:34.580
 They're going to find your email

2:18:34.580 --> 2:18:36.840
 and they're going to write you a long email

2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:39.700
 about some of the interesting things they've found

2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:42.320
 in any of your papers.

2:18:43.420 --> 2:18:45.900
 How should people contact you?

2:18:45.900 --> 2:18:47.940
 What is the best way for that?

2:18:47.940 --> 2:18:49.300
 Would you recommend?

2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:50.780
 You're a super busy guy.

2:18:50.780 --> 2:18:52.580
 You have a million things going on.

2:18:54.340 --> 2:18:56.540
 How should people communicate with you?

2:18:56.540 --> 2:18:57.740
 Thanks for bringing this up.

2:18:57.740 --> 2:19:01.900
 This is a, I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this.

2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:04.980
 If someone's interested in participating in a study,

2:19:04.980 --> 2:19:07.260
 the best thing to do is go to the website.

2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:13.100
 Of the study or of like, yeah, which website?

2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:15.780
 So we have all of our psilocybin studies.

2:19:15.780 --> 2:19:18.800
 So everything we have is up on one website

2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:21.120
 and then we link to the different study websites,

2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:24.500
 but hopkinspsychedelic.org.

2:19:24.500 --> 2:19:27.440
 So everything we do, or if you don't remember that,

2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:29.940
 just go to your favorite search engine

2:19:29.940 --> 2:19:32.080
 and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic

2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:33.600
 and you're going to find one of the first hits

2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:35.920
 is going to be our, is this website.

2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:38.060
 And there's going to be links to the smoking study

2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:39.120
 and all of our other studies.

2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:40.900
 If there's no link to it there,

2:19:40.900 --> 2:19:42.600
 we don't have a study on it now.

2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:46.220
 And if you're interested in psychedelic research more broadly,

2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:48.300
 you can look up, like at another university

2:19:48.300 --> 2:19:49.460
 that might be closer to you.

2:19:49.460 --> 2:19:52.240
 And there's a handful of them now across the country.

2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:55.140
 And there's some in Europe that have studies going on,

2:19:55.140 --> 2:19:56.900
 but you can, at least in the US,

2:19:56.900 --> 2:20:00.200
 you can look at clinicaltrials.gov

2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:02.180
 and look up the term psilocybin.

2:20:02.180 --> 2:20:04.420
 And in fact, optionally people even in Europe

2:20:04.420 --> 2:20:06.180
 can register their trial on there.

2:20:06.180 --> 2:20:07.620
 So that's a good way to find studies.

2:20:07.620 --> 2:20:11.340
 But for our research, rather than emailing me,

2:20:11.340 --> 2:20:13.540
 like a more efficient way is to go straight

2:20:13.540 --> 2:20:17.060
 and you can do that first, the first phase of screening.

2:20:17.060 --> 2:20:18.660
 There's some questions online

2:20:18.660 --> 2:20:21.900
 and then someone will get back in touch with you.

2:20:21.900 --> 2:20:24.860
 But I do already, you know,

2:20:24.860 --> 2:20:29.580
 and I expect it's like going to increase,

2:20:29.580 --> 2:20:32.940
 but I'm already at the level where my simple limited mind

2:20:32.940 --> 2:20:34.380
 and limited capacity is already,

2:20:34.380 --> 2:20:37.660
 I sometimes fail to get back to emails.

2:20:37.660 --> 2:20:39.780
 I mean, I'm trying to respond to my colleagues,

2:20:39.780 --> 2:20:43.540
 my mentees, all these things, my responsibilities.

2:20:43.540 --> 2:20:45.820
 And as many of the people just inquiring

2:20:45.820 --> 2:20:47.440
 about I wanna go to graduate school,

2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:49.660
 I'm interested in this, I had this,

2:20:49.660 --> 2:20:51.020
 I have a daughter that took a psychedelic

2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:51.860
 and she's having trouble.

2:20:51.860 --> 2:20:54.720
 And it's like, I try to respond to those,

2:20:54.720 --> 2:20:58.020
 but sometimes I just simply can't get to all of it already.

2:20:58.020 --> 2:21:00.660
 To be honest, like from my perspective,

2:21:00.660 --> 2:21:03.460
 it's been quite heartbreaking

2:21:03.460 --> 2:21:07.380
 because I basically don't respond to any emails anymore.

2:21:07.380 --> 2:21:11.940
 And especially as you mentioned mentees and so on,

2:21:11.940 --> 2:21:14.060
 like outside of that circle,

2:21:14.060 --> 2:21:16.500
 it's heartbreaking to me how many brilliant people

2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:19.740
 there are, thoughtful people, like loving people.

2:21:19.740 --> 2:21:22.580
 And they write long emails that are really,

2:21:22.580 --> 2:21:26.300
 by the way, I do read them very often.

2:21:26.300 --> 2:21:28.060
 It's just that I don't,

2:21:28.060 --> 2:21:31.740
 the response is then you're starting a conversation.

2:21:31.740 --> 2:21:35.500
 And the heartbreaking aspect is you only have

2:21:35.500 --> 2:21:37.980
 so many hours in the day to have deep,

2:21:37.980 --> 2:21:40.860
 meaningful conversations with human beings on this earth.

2:21:40.860 --> 2:21:42.540
 And so you have to select who they are.

2:21:42.540 --> 2:21:43.700
 And usually it's your family,

2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:46.300
 it's people like you're directly working with.

2:21:46.300 --> 2:21:48.660
 And even I guarantee you with this conversation,

2:21:48.660 --> 2:21:53.660
 people will write you long, really thoughtful emails.

2:21:54.220 --> 2:21:55.840
 Like there'll be brilliant people,

2:21:55.840 --> 2:21:59.300
 faculty from all over, PhD students from all over.

2:21:59.300 --> 2:22:00.320
 And it's heartbreaking

2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:01.660
 because you can't really get back to them.

2:22:01.660 --> 2:22:04.380
 But you're saying like many of them,

2:22:04.380 --> 2:22:06.420
 if you do respond, it's more like here,

2:22:06.420 --> 2:22:10.540
 go to this website when you're interested into the study,

2:22:10.540 --> 2:22:13.180
 just it makes sense to directly go to the site

2:22:13.180 --> 2:22:16.420
 if there's applications open, just apply for the study.

2:22:16.420 --> 2:22:19.780
 Right, right, right, as either a volunteer

2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:22.840
 or if we're looking for somebody,

2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:25.220
 we're gonna be posting,

2:22:25.220 --> 2:22:28.260
 including on the Hopkins University website,

2:22:28.260 --> 2:22:30.940
 we're gonna be posting if we're looking for a position.

2:22:30.940 --> 2:22:32.580
 I am right now actually looking through

2:22:32.580 --> 2:22:35.420
 and it's mainly been through email and contacts,

2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:37.920
 but should I say it?

2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:39.140
 I think I'd rather cast my nets wide,

2:22:39.140 --> 2:22:40.860
 but I'm looking for a postdoc right now.

2:22:40.860 --> 2:22:41.740
 Oh, great.

2:22:41.740 --> 2:22:44.740
 So I've mentored postdocs for, I don't know,

2:22:44.740 --> 2:22:46.340
 like a dozen years or so.

2:22:46.340 --> 2:22:47.860
 And more and more of their time

2:22:47.860 --> 2:22:50.060
 is being spent on psychedelics.

2:22:50.060 --> 2:22:52.220
 So someone's free to contact me.

2:22:52.220 --> 2:22:54.880
 That's more of a, that's sort of so close to home.

2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:56.740
 That's a personal, you know,

2:22:56.740 --> 2:22:58.380
 that like emailing me about that.

2:22:58.380 --> 2:23:01.920
 But I come to appreciate more the advice

2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:03.860
 that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like,

2:23:03.860 --> 2:23:06.580
 I think it's him, like five cents emails,

2:23:06.580 --> 2:23:10.980
 you know, like a subject that gets to the point

2:23:10.980 --> 2:23:11.960
 that tells you what it's about

2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:14.380
 so that like you break through the signal to the noise.

2:23:14.380 --> 2:23:15.660
 But I really appreciate what you're saying

2:23:15.660 --> 2:23:17.660
 because part of the equation for me is like,

2:23:17.660 --> 2:23:18.560
 I have a three year old,

2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:21.700
 and like my time on the ground, on the floor,

2:23:21.700 --> 2:23:25.860
 playing blocks or cars with him is part of that equation.

2:23:25.860 --> 2:23:27.500
 And even if the day is ending

2:23:27.500 --> 2:23:29.220
 and I know some of those emails are slipping by

2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:30.380
 and I'll never get back to them.

2:23:30.380 --> 2:23:32.900
 And I have, I'm struggling with it already.

2:23:32.900 --> 2:23:34.340
 And I get what you're saying is like,

2:23:34.340 --> 2:23:35.860
 I haven't seen anything yet

2:23:35.860 --> 2:23:39.020
 if with the type of exposure that like your podcast gets.

2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:40.380
 This will bring in exposure.

2:23:40.380 --> 2:23:42.380
 And then I think in terms of postdocs,

2:23:42.380 --> 2:23:43.860
 this is a really good podcast

2:23:43.860 --> 2:23:47.540
 in the sense that there's a lot of brilliant PhD students

2:23:47.540 --> 2:23:48.820
 out there that are looking for a poster

2:23:48.820 --> 2:23:52.260
 from all over, from MIT, probably from Hopkins,

2:23:52.260 --> 2:23:53.660
 it's just all over the place.

2:23:53.660 --> 2:23:57.400
 So this is, and I, we have different preferences,

2:23:57.400 --> 2:24:00.420
 but my preference would also be to have like a form

2:24:00.420 --> 2:24:01.940
 that they could fill out for posts.

2:24:01.940 --> 2:24:05.260
 Because, you know, it's very difficult through email

2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:09.020
 to tell who's really going to be a strong collaborator

2:24:09.020 --> 2:24:12.280
 for you, like a strong postdoc, strong student,

2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:15.640
 because you want a bunch of details,

2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:16.480
 but at the same time,

2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:19.520
 you don't want a million pages worth of email.

2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:21.560
 So you want a little bit of application process.

2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:24.840
 So usually you set up a form that helps me indicate

2:24:24.840 --> 2:24:27.440
 how passionate the person is,

2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.440
 how willing they are to do hard work.

2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:35.440
 Like I often ask a question,

2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:39.040
 people of what do you think is more important

2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:41.440
 to work hard or to work smart?

2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:45.360
 And I use that, those types of questions

2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:47.440
 to indicate who I would like to work with.

2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:51.520
 Because it's counterintuitive.

2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:56.200
 But anyway, I'll leave that question unanswered

2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:57.800
 for people to figure out themselves.

2:24:57.800 --> 2:25:00.000
 But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins,

2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:01.640
 you will understand.

2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:02.460
 So anyway.

2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:04.840
 Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything.

2:25:04.840 --> 2:25:05.680
 It's difficult.

2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:07.040
 And that's something that evolves.

2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:09.880
 Email is such a messy thing.

2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:14.880
 There's, speaking of Baltimore, Cal Newport,

2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:16.880
 if you know who that is,

2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:19.880
 he wrote a book called Deep Work.

2:25:19.880 --> 2:25:21.320
 He's a computer science professor

2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:23.520
 and he's currently working on a book about email,

2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:25.720
 about all the ways that email is broken.

2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:28.680
 So this is gonna be a fascinating read.

2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:30.600
 This is a little bit of a general question,

2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:35.600
 but almost a bigger picture question

2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:38.120
 that we touched on a little bit,

2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:40.600
 but let's just touch it in a full way,

2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:43.400
 which is what have all the psychedelic studies

2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:48.220
 you've conducted taught you about the human mind,

2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:52.280
 about the human brain and the human mind?

2:25:52.280 --> 2:25:53.360
 Is there something,

2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:56.300
 if you look at the human scientists you were before

2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:59.640
 this work and the scientists you are now,

2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:03.640
 how has your understanding of the human mind changed?

2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:08.360
 I'm thinking of that in two categories.

2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:13.280
 One kind of more scientific,

2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:14.540
 and they're both scientific,

2:26:14.540 --> 2:26:19.540
 but one more about the brain and behavior

2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:22.760
 and the mind, so to speak.

2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:24.080
 And as a behaviorist,

2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:28.000
 all we see sort of the mind as a metaphor for behaviors,

2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.900
 but anyway, that gets philosophical.

2:26:30.900 --> 2:26:35.200
 But it's really increasing the,

2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:39.540
 so the one category is increasing the appreciation

2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:43.120
 for the magnitude of depth.

2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:47.400
 I mean, so these are all metaphors of human experience.

2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:48.960
 That might be a good way to,

2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:51.000
 because you use certain words like consciousness

2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.640
 and it's like we're using constructs

2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:56.920
 that aren't well defined unless we kind of dig in,

2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:01.200
 but human experience like that,

2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:03.820
 the experiences on these compounds

2:27:03.820 --> 2:27:07.180
 can be so far out there or so deep.

2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:10.860
 And they're doing that by tinkering

2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:13.160
 with the same machinery that's going on up there.

2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:16.280
 I mean, my assumption,

2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:20.160
 and I think it's a good assumption is that all experiences,

2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:25.160
 there's a biological side to all phenomenal experience.

2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:27.480
 So there is not,

2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:32.480
 the divide between biology and experience or psychology

2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:38.380
 is, it's not one or the other.

2:27:38.380 --> 2:27:43.040
 These are just two sides of the same coin.

2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:45.740
 I mean, you're avoiding the use

2:27:45.740 --> 2:27:47.560
 of the word consciousness, for example,

2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:49.060
 but the experience is referring

2:27:49.060 --> 2:27:50.880
 to the subjective experience.

2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:53.200
 So it's the actual technical use

2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:57.760
 of the word consciousness of subjective experience.

2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:00.320
 And even that word, there are certain ways that like,

2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:02.460
 sort of like if we're talking about access consciousness

2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:05.800
 or narrative self awareness, which is an aspect of,

2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:08.280
 like you can wrap a definition around that

2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:09.720
 and we can talk meaningfully about it,

2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:11.160
 but so often around psychedelics,

2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:13.080
 it's used in this much more,

2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:15.400
 in terms of ultimately explaining

2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:17.160
 phenomenal consciousness itself,

2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:18.860
 the so called hard problem,

2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:22.400
 and relating to that question

2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:25.800
 and psychedelics really haven't spoken to that.

2:28:25.800 --> 2:28:27.020
 And that's why it's hard

2:28:27.020 --> 2:28:29.040
 because like it's hard to imagine anything.

2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:32.220
 But I think what I was getting is that psychedelics

2:28:32.220 --> 2:28:34.020
 have done this by,

2:28:34.020 --> 2:28:37.000
 the reason I was getting into the biology versus mind,

2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:41.780
 psychology divide is that just to kind of set up the fact

2:28:41.780 --> 2:28:45.800
 that I think all of our experience is related

2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:49.240
 to these biological events.

2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:52.860
 So whether they be naturally occurring neurotransmitters,

2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:56.420
 like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine, et cetera,

2:28:56.420 --> 2:28:59.200
 and a whole other sort of biological activity

2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:01.560
 and kind of another layer up

2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.600
 that we could talk about as network activity,

2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:05.160
 communication amongst brain areas,

2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:06.760
 like this is always going on,

2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:10.600
 even if I just prompt you to think about a loved one,

2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:13.440
 like there's something happening biologically.

2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:15.920
 Okay, so that's always another side of the coin.

2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:18.640
 So another way to put that

2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:21.760
 is all of our subjective experience outside of drugs,

2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:26.760
 it's all a controlled hallucination in a sense.

2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:28.880
 Like this is completely constructed.

2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:33.720
 Our experience of reality is completely a simulation.

2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:36.320
 So I think we're on solid ground to say

2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:37.400
 that that's our best guess

2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:41.000
 and that's a pretty reasonable thing to say scientifically.

2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.480
 Like all the rich complexity of the world emerges

2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:46.000
 from just some biology and some chemicals.

2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.680
 So in that definition implied a causation, it comes from.

2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:53.900
 And so we know at least there's a solid correlation there.

2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:57.280
 And so then we delve deep into the philosophy

2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:00.400
 of like idealism or materialism and things like this,

2:30:00.400 --> 2:30:01.520
 which I'm not an expert in,

2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:03.920
 but I know we're getting into that territory.

2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:06.920
 You don't even necessarily have to go there.

2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:09.240
 Like you at least go to the level of like,

2:30:09.240 --> 2:30:11.320
 okay, we know there seems to be this one on one

2:30:11.320 --> 2:30:14.800
 correspondence and that seems pretty solid.

2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:16.640
 Like you can't prove a negative and you can't prove,

2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:18.920
 you know, it's in that category of like,

2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:20.480
 you could come up with an experience

2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:22.560
 that maybe doesn't have a biological correlate,

2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:24.480
 but then you're talking about,

2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:25.800
 there's also the limits of the science.

2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:26.800
 Is it a false negative?

2:30:26.800 --> 2:30:29.600
 But I think our best guess and a very decent assumption

2:30:29.600 --> 2:30:33.680
 is that every psychological event has a biological correlate.

2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:37.880
 So with that said, you know, the idea that you can throw,

2:30:37.880 --> 2:30:42.160
 alter that biology in a pretty trivial manner.

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:45.320
 I mean, you could take like a relatively small number

2:30:45.320 --> 2:30:48.880
 of these molecules, throw them into the nervous system

2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:53.060
 and then have a 60 year old person who has,

2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:59.220
 you name it, I mean, that has hiked to the top of Everest

2:30:59.220 --> 2:31:02.640
 and that speaks five languages and that has been married

2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:06.080
 and has kids and grandkids and has,

2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:09.020
 you name it, you know, like been at the top and say,

2:31:09.020 --> 2:31:12.800
 this fundamentally changed who I am as a person

2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:16.020
 and what I think life is about.

2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:20.920
 Like that's the thing about psychedelics

2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:24.600
 that just floors me and it never fails.

2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:27.960
 I mean, sometimes you get bogged down by the paperwork

2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:30.120
 and running studies and all the, I don't know,

2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:33.240
 all of the BS that can come with being in academia

2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:34.640
 and everything and then you,

2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:37.280
 and sometimes you get some dud sessions

2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:39.920
 where it's not the full, all the magic isn't happening

2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:42.720
 and it's, you know, more or less it's either a dud

2:31:42.720 --> 2:31:44.880
 or somewhere and I don't mean to dismiss them,

2:31:44.880 --> 2:31:46.960
 but you know, it's not like these magnificent

2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:50.640
 sort of reports, but sometimes you get the full Monty report

2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:52.640
 from one of these people and you're like,

2:31:52.640 --> 2:31:54.420
 oh yeah, that's why we're doing this.

2:31:54.420 --> 2:31:56.480
 Whether it's like therapeutically

2:31:56.480 --> 2:32:01.480
 or just to understand the mind and you're like,

2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:05.760
 and you're still floored, like how is that possible?

2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:10.760
 How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission

2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:13.640
 and say, and this person is now saying

2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:16.600
 that they're making fundamental differences

2:32:16.600 --> 2:32:19.800
 in the priorities of their life after 60 years.

2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:24.800
 It also just fills you with awe of the possibility

2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:28.560
 of experiences we're yet to have uncovered.

2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:32.240
 If just a few chemicals can change so much,

2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:36.600
 it's like, man, what if this could be up?

2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.680
 I mean, like how, cause we're just like took a little,

2:32:40.680 --> 2:32:43.240
 it's like lighting a match or something in the darkness

2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:44.960
 and you could see there's a lot more there,

2:32:44.960 --> 2:32:47.640
 but you don't know how much more.

2:32:47.640 --> 2:32:49.120
 And that's.

2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:51.960
 And then like, where's that gonna go with like,

2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:53.640
 I mean, I'm always like aware of the fact

2:32:53.640 --> 2:32:55.800
 that like we always as humans and as scientists

2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:58.040
 think that we figured out 99%

2:32:58.040 --> 2:32:59.400
 and we're working on that first 1%.

2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:01.480
 And we gotta keep reminding ourselves, it's hard to do.

2:33:01.480 --> 2:33:05.800
 Like we figured out like not even 1%, like we know nothing.

2:33:05.800 --> 2:33:09.640
 And so like, I can speculate and I might sound like a fool,

2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:12.080
 but like what are drugs, even the concept of drugs,

2:33:12.080 --> 2:33:15.640
 like 10 years, 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years,

2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:20.640
 if we're surviving, like molecules that go

2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:23.440
 to a specific area of the brain

2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:25.160
 in combination with technology,

2:33:25.160 --> 2:33:27.760
 in combination with the magnetic stimulation,

2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:31.520
 in combination with the, like targeted pharmacology

2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:35.120
 of like, oh, like this subset of serotonin 2A receptors

2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:39.440
 in the claustrum, at this time, in this particular sequence

2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:41.320
 in combination with this other thing,

2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:44.440
 like this baseball cap you wear that like has,

2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:47.760
 has one of the, is doing some of these things

2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:49.160
 that we can only do with these like giant

2:33:49.160 --> 2:33:50.480
 like pieces of equipment now,

2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:53.280
 like where it's gonna go is gonna be endless.

2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:56.880
 And it becomes easy to combine within virtual reality

2:33:56.880 --> 2:33:58.240
 where the virtual reality is gonna move

2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:01.600
 from being something out here to being more in there.

2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:04.160
 And then we're getting, like we talked about before,

2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:06.720
 we're already in a virtual reality

2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:11.160
 in terms of human perception and cognition models

2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:14.160
 of the universe being all representations

2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:18.520
 and sort of color not existing and just our representations

2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:22.560
 of EM wavelengths, et cetera, sound,

2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:23.920
 being vibrations and all of this.

2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:28.400
 And so as the external VR and the internal VR

2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:30.320
 come closer to each other,

2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:31.400
 like this is what I think about

2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:33.080
 in terms of the future of drugs.

2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:35.720
 Like all of this stuff sort of combines

2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:40.720
 and like where that goes is just, it's unthinkable.

2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:44.520
 Like we were probably gonna, you know,

2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:46.760
 again, I might sound like a fool and this may not happen,

2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:49.280
 but I think it's possible, you know,

2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:50.880
 to go completely offline,

2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:54.120
 like where most of people's experiences maybe

2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:58.880
 going into these internal worlds.

2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:02.480
 And I mean, maybe you through some,

2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:03.880
 through a combination of these techniques,

2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:04.880
 you create experiences

2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:07.560
 where someone could live a thousand years

2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:09.720
 in terms of maybe they're living a regular lifespan,

2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:11.240
 but in over the next two seconds,

2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:13.400
 you're living a thousand years worth of experience.

2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:15.120
 Inside your mind.

2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:16.680
 Yeah, through this manipulation of them.

2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:19.480
 Like, is that possible?

2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:23.000
 Like just based on like first principles and like.

2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:24.920
 Yeah, first principles, yes.

2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:26.120
 I think so.

2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:30.320
 Like give us another 50, 100, 500, like who knows,

2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:33.240
 but like how could it not go there?

2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:37.000
 In a small tangent, what are your thoughts

2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.440
 in this broader definition of drugs,

2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:42.240
 of psychedelics, of mind altering things?

2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:44.320
 What are your thoughts about Neuralink

2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:47.160
 and brain computer interfaces,

2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:52.160
 sort of being able to electrically stimulate

2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:57.680
 and read neuronal activity in the brain

2:35:57.680 --> 2:35:59.880
 and then connect that to the computer,

2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:04.880
 which is another way from a computational perspective

2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:06.680
 for me is kind of appealing,

2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:11.680
 but it's another way of altering subtly

2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.840
 the behavior of the brain.

2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:17.320
 That's kind of, if you zoom out, reminiscent

2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:20.400
 of the way psychedelics do as well.

2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:22.480
 So what do you have?

2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:25.240
 Like what are your thoughts about Neuralink?

2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:27.400
 What are your hopes as a researcher

2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:32.400
 of mind altering devices, systems, chemicals?

2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:36.120
 I guess broadly speaking, I'm all for it.

2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:38.440
 I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics,

2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:40.480
 but it comes with all the caveats.

2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:42.760
 You know, you're going into a brave new world

2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:44.360
 where it's like all of a sudden

2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:46.120
 there's going to be a dark side.

2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:51.040
 There's going to be serious ethical considerations,

2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:54.720
 but that should not stop us from moving there.

2:36:54.720 --> 2:36:57.240
 I mean, particularly the stuff from, and I'm no expert,

2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:00.280
 but on the short list in the short term, it's like, yeah,

2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:02.520
 can we help these serious neurological disorders?

2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:03.480
 Like, hell yeah.

2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:07.160
 And I'm also sensitive to something being someone

2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:13.440
 that has lots of neuroscience colleagues with some

2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:16.080
 of this stuff, and I can't talk about particulars,

2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:20.720
 I'm not recalling, but in terms of stuff getting out there

2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.520
 and then kind of a mocking of, oh gosh,

2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:27.800
 they're saying this is unique, we know this,

2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:31.120
 or sort of like this belittling of like, oh,

2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:33.080
 this sounds like it's just a, I don't know,

2:37:33.080 --> 2:37:35.960
 a commercialization or like an oversimplification.

2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:38.680
 I forget what the example was, but something like,

2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:41.080
 something that came off to some of my neuroscientific

2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:42.840
 colleagues as an oversimplification,

2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:44.600
 or at least the way they said it.

2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:46.360
 Oh, from a Neuralink perspective.

2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:49.240
 Right, oh, we've known that for years and like,

2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:52.040
 but I'm very sympathetic to like,

2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.080
 maybe it's because of my very limited,

2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:57.920
 but relatively speaking, the amount of exposure

2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:00.480
 the psychedelic work has had to my limited experience

2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:02.840
 of being out there, and then you think about someone

2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:06.480
 like Mike Musk, who's like really, really out there,

2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:10.120
 and you just get all these arrows that like,

2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:13.080
 and it's hard to be like when you're plowing new ground,

2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:16.400
 like you're gonna get, you're gonna get criticized

2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:18.040
 like every little word that you,

2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:20.120
 this balance between speaking to like people

2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:21.520
 to make it meaningful, something scientists

2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:23.840
 aren't very good at, having people understand

2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:25.920
 what you're saying, and then being belittled

2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:30.080
 by oversimplifying something in terms of the public message.

2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:33.120
 So I'm extremely sympathetic, and I'm a big fan

2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:35.520
 of like what that, you know, what Elon Musk does,

2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:39.000
 like tunnels through the ground, and SpaceX,

2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:40.520
 and all this, just like, hell yeah,

2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:43.800
 like this guy has some, he has some great ideas.

2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:45.120
 And there's something to be said,

2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:47.360
 it's not just the communication to the public.

2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:50.200
 I think his first principles thinking,

2:38:50.200 --> 2:38:51.480
 it's like, because I get this

2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:52.960
 in the artificial intelligence world,

2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:55.240
 it's probably similar to neuroscience world,

2:38:55.240 --> 2:38:57.320
 where Elon will say something like,

2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:00.640
 or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles.

2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:05.120
 And he's sort of, I could sense how much he pisses off

2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:08.920
 like every roboticist at MIT, and everybody who works

2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:11.920
 on like the human factor side of safety

2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.720
 of autonomous vehicles, and saying like,

2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:18.040
 nah, we don't need to consider human beings in the car,

2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:21.360
 like the car will drive itself, it's obvious

2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:22.880
 that neural networks is all you need.

2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:25.480
 Like it's obvious that like we should be able

2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:30.200
 to systems that should be able to learn constantly.

2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:32.040
 And they don't really need LIDAR,

2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:36.440
 they just need cameras, because we humans just use our eyes,

2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:38.200
 and that's the same as cameras.

2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:41.000
 So like it doesn't, why would we need anything else?

2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:42.840
 You just have to make a system that learns faster,

2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:46.400
 and faster, and faster, and neural networks can do that.

2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:48.840
 And so that's pissing off every single community.

2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:50.560
 It's pissing off human factors community,

2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:53.240
 saying you don't need to consider the human driver

2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:56.040
 in the picture, you can just focus on the robotics problem.

2:39:56.040 --> 2:39:59.400
 It's pissing off every robotics person

2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:02.640
 for saying LIDAR can be just ignored, it can be camera.

2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:06.280
 Every robotics person knows that camera is really noisy,

2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:08.160
 that it's really difficult to deal with.

2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:13.160
 But he's, and then every AI person who says,

2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:16.600
 who hears neural networks, and says like,

2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:18.520
 neural networks can learn everything,

2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:20.480
 like almost presuming that it's kind of going

2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:22.160
 to achieve general intelligence.

2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:26.840
 The problem with all those haters in the three communities

2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:31.040
 is that they're looking one year ahead, five years ahead.

2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:34.400
 The hilarious thing about the, quote unquote,

2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:36.840
 ridiculous things that Elon Musk is saying,

2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:40.320
 is they have a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years.

2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:42.960
 And so like, when you just look at the, you know,

2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:45.640
 when you look at the progression

2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:47.800
 of these kinds of predictions,

2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:51.160
 and sometimes first principles thinking can allow you

2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:55.080
 to do that, is you see that it's kind of obvious

2:40:55.080 --> 2:40:58.120
 that things are going to progress this way.

2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:01.000
 And if you just remove the prejudice you hold

2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:04.560
 about the particular battles

2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:06.520
 of the current academic environment,

2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:08.920
 and just look at the big picture,

2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:10.800
 the progression of the technology,

2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:15.680
 you can usually see the world in the same kind of way.

2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:18.640
 And so in that same way, looking at psychedelics,

2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:22.440
 you can see like, there is so many exciting possibilities

2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:24.960
 here if we fully engage in the research.

2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:26.800
 Same thing with Neuralink.

2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:30.760
 If we fully engage, so we go from a thousand channels

2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:32.360
 of communication to the brain,

2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:35.680
 to billions of channels of communication to the brain,

2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:38.560
 and we figure out many of the details

2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:42.120
 of how to do that safely with neurosurgery and so on,

2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:45.200
 that the world would just change completely

2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:47.480
 in the same kind of way that Elon is.

2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:49.240
 It's so ridiculous to hear him talk

2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:52.440
 about a symbiotic relationship between AI

2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:55.440
 and the human brain.

2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:57.960
 But it's like, is it though?

2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:01.520
 Is it?

2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:03.560
 Because I can see in 50 years,

2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:05.560
 that's going to be an obvious,

2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:08.280
 like everyone will have, like obviously you have,

2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:11.080
 like why are we typing stuff in the computer?

2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:12.040
 It doesn't make any sense.

2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:13.080
 That's stupid.

2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:16.200
 People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse?

2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:17.040
 What is that?

2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:19.720
 And it seems pretty clear, like we're going to be there.

2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:21.600
 Like, and the only question is like, what's the timeframe?

2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:23.920
 Is that going to be 20 or is it 50 or a hundred?

2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:25.200
 Like, how could we not?

2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:29.160
 And the thing that I guess upsets with Elon and others

2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:31.680
 is the timeline he tends to do.

2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:33.760
 I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing.

2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:37.560
 I definitely do it, which is like, it'll be done this year

2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:39.600
 versus like, it'll be done in 10 years.

2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:41.480
 The timeline is a little bit too rushed,

2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:43.120
 but from our leadership perspective,

2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:46.760
 it inspires the engineers to do the best work

2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:49.800
 of their life to really kind of believe,

2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:52.880
 because to do the impossible, you have to first believe it,

2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:55.960
 which is a really important aspect of innovation.

2:42:55.960 --> 2:42:57.760
 And there's the delay discounting aspect

2:42:57.760 --> 2:42:58.760
 I talked about before.

2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:00.440
 It's like saying, oh, this is going to be a thing

2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:01.720
 20, 50 years from now.

2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:04.160
 It's like, what motivates anybody?

2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:05.320
 And even if you're fudging it

2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:07.000
 or like wishful thinking a little bit,

2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.680
 or let's just say airing on one side

2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:12.280
 of the probability distribution,

2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:14.320
 like there's value in saying like, yeah,

2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:17.160
 like there's a chance we could get this done in a year.

2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:18.000
 And you know what?

2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.040
 And if you set a goal for a year and you're not successful,

2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:23.120
 hey, you might get it done in three years.

2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:25.480
 Whereas if you had aimed at 20 years,

2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:27.040
 well, you either would have never done it at all,

2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:28.240
 or you would have aimed at 20 years

2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:29.960
 and then it would have taken you 10.

2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:32.760
 So the other thing I think about this,

2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:34.320
 like in terms of his work

2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:36.600
 and I guess we've seen with psychedelics,

2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:39.200
 it's like there's a lack of appreciation

2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:40.680
 for like sort of the variability

2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:42.480
 you need a natural selection,

2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:45.320
 sort of extrapolating from biological,

2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:47.360
 from evolution like,

2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:50.960
 hey, maybe he's wrong about focusing only on the cameras

2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:52.440
 and not these other things.

2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:53.720
 Be empirically driven.

2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:56.560
 It's like, yeah, you need to like when he's,

2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:57.720
 when you need to get the regulation,

2:43:57.720 --> 2:43:59.040
 is it safe enough to get this thing on the road?

2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:01.240
 Those are real questions and be empirically driven.

2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:04.720
 And if he can meet the whatever standard is relevant,

2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:06.520
 that's the standard and be driven by that.

2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:07.880
 So don't let it affect your ethics.

2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:10.800
 But if he's on the wrong path,

2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:12.680
 how wonderful someone's exploring that wrong path.

2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:13.960
 He's gonna figure out it's a wrong path.

2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:15.840
 And like other people, he's,

2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:17.760
 damn it, he's doing something.

2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.760
 Like he's, and appreciating that variability,

2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:27.280
 that like it's valuable even if he's not on,

2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:29.760
 I mean, this is all over the place in science.

2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:30.960
 It's like a good theory.

2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:32.920
 One standard definition

2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:35.400
 is that it generates testable hypotheses.

2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:37.640
 And like the ultimate model

2:44:37.640 --> 2:44:39.200
 is never gonna be the same as reality.

2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:42.240
 Some models are gonna work better than others.

2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:46.200
 Newtonian physics got us a long ways,

2:44:46.200 --> 2:44:49.600
 even if there was a better model like waiting.

2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:52.280
 And some models weren't as good as,

2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:53.480
 were never that successful,

2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:56.440
 but just even like putting them out there and test it.

2:44:56.440 --> 2:44:58.640
 We wouldn't know something is a bad model

2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:00.400
 until someone puts it out anyway, so.

2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:04.320
 Yeah, diversity of ideas is essential for progress, yeah.

2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:07.760
 So we brought up consciousness a few times.

2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:11.240
 There's several things I wanna kind of disentangle there.

2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:13.240
 So one, you've recently wrote a paper titled

2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:16.000
 Consciousness, Religion, and Gurus,

2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.120
 Pitfalls of Psychedelic Medicine.

2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:20.480
 So that's one side of it.

2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:21.680
 You've kind of already mentioned

2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:24.520
 that these terms can be a little bit misused

2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:28.920
 or used in a variety of ways

2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:32.440
 that they can be confusing.

2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:34.520
 But in a specific way,

2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:39.120
 as much as we can be specific about these things,

2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:41.600
 about the actual heart problem of consciousness

2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:44.280
 or understanding what is consciousness,

2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:46.760
 this weird thing that it feels like,

2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:49.600
 it feels like something to experience things.

2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:55.680
 Have psychedelics given you some kind of insight

2:45:55.680 --> 2:45:58.200
 on what is consciousness?

2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:01.080
 You've mentioned that it feels like psychedelics

2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:05.840
 allows you to kind of dismantle your sense of self,

2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:09.160
 like step outside of yourself.

2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:13.560
 So that feels like somehow playing

2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:15.880
 with this mechanism of consciousness.

2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:17.920
 And if it is in fact playing

2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:19.360
 with the mechanism of consciousness

2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:21.440
 using just a few chemicals,

2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:24.120
 it feels like we're very much in the neighborhood

2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:27.720
 of being able to maybe understand

2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:29.960
 the actual biological mechanisms

2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:32.680
 of how consciousness can emerge from the brain.

2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:34.840
 So yeah, there's a bunch there.

2:46:34.840 --> 2:46:39.120
 I think my preface is that I certainly have opinions

2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:42.640
 that I can say, here are my best speculations

2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:47.440
 as just a person and an armchair philosopher.

2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:50.280
 And that philosophy is certainly not my training

2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:52.240
 and my expertise.

2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:53.440
 So I have thoughts there,

2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:55.480
 but that I recognize are completely

2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:57.280
 in the realm of speculation

2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:00.000
 that are like things that I would love to wrap

2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:01.520
 empirical science around,

2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:06.320
 but that there's no data

2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:08.280
 and getting to the hard problem,

2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:09.680
 like no conceivable way,

2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:11.720
 even though I'm very open,

2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:14.560
 like I'm hoping that that problem can be cracked.

2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:16.920
 And as an armchair philosopher,

2:47:16.920 --> 2:47:18.000
 I do think that is a problem.

2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.600
 I don't think it can be dismissed as some people argue

2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:22.920
 it's not even really a problem.

2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:25.400
 It strikes me that explaining just the existence

2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:27.440
 of phenomenal consciousness is a problem.

2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:30.440
 So anyway, I very much keep that divide in mind

2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:31.760
 when I talk about these things,

2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:34.120
 what we can really say about what we've learned

2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:35.560
 through science, including by psychedelics

2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:38.480
 versus like what I can speculate on

2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:42.720
 in terms of the nature of reality and consciousness.

2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.720
 But in terms of, by and large,

2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:50.840
 skeptically, I have to say psychedelics

2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:53.640
 have not really taught us anything

2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:55.720
 about the nature of consciousness.

2:47:55.720 --> 2:47:57.000
 I'm hopeful that they will.

2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:01.080
 They have been used around certain,

2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:03.000
 I don't even know if features is the right term,

2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:04.840
 but things that are called consciousness.

2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:06.800
 So consciousness can refer to not only

2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:08.280
 just phenomenal consciousness,

2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:11.920
 which is like the source of the hard problem

2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:16.120
 and what it is to be like Nagel's description,

2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:19.240
 but the sense of self,

2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:22.280
 which can be sort of like the experiential self

2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:24.440
 moment to moment, or it can be like the narrative self,

2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:25.920
 the stringing together of stories.

2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:29.120
 So those are things that I think can be,

2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:33.880
 and a little bit's been done with psychedelics

2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:37.360
 regarding that, but I think there's far more potential.

2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:43.200
 So like one story that unfolded

2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:45.960
 is that psychedelics acutely having effects

2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:48.320
 on the default mode network,

2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:50.640
 a certain pattern of activation

2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:52.160
 amongst a subset of brain areas

2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:55.880
 that is associated with self referential processing,

2:48:55.880 --> 2:48:57.240
 seems to be more active,

2:48:57.240 --> 2:49:01.240
 more communication between these areas,

2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:04.000
 like the posterior cingulate cortex

2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.960
 and the medial prefrontal cortex, for example,

2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.920
 being parts of this and others that are tied

2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:12.280
 with sort of thinking about yourself,

2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:13.560
 remembering yourself in the past,

2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:15.640
 projecting yourself into the future.

2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:18.600
 And so an interesting story emerged

2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:23.600
 when it was found that when psilocybin is on board

2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:25.600
 in the person's system,

2:49:25.600 --> 2:49:29.320
 that there's less communication amongst these areas.

2:49:29.320 --> 2:49:32.160
 So with resting state fMRI imaging,

2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:35.200
 that there's less synchronization

2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:38.160
 or presumably communication between these areas.

2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:41.560
 And so I think it has been overstated

2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:43.120
 in terms of, ah, we see this is like,

2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:45.200
 this is the dissolving of the ego.

2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:48.160
 The story made a whole lot of sense,

2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:50.960
 but there's several,

2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:53.440
 I think that story is really being challenged.

2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:55.800
 Like one, we see increasing number of drugs

2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:59.520
 that decouple that network,

2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:02.640
 including ones like that aren't psychedelic.

2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:04.960
 So this may just be a property, frankly,

2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:07.760
 of being like, you know, screwed up, you know,

2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:09.200
 like, you know, being out of your head,

2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:10.560
 being like, like, you know.

2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:12.400
 Anytime you mess with the perception system,

2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:14.720
 maybe it screws up some,

2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:19.040
 just our ability to just function in the holistically

2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:20.920
 like we do in order,

2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:22.560
 yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff,

2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:24.080
 to be able to map it to memory,

2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:26.320
 to connect things together,

2:50:26.320 --> 2:50:28.120
 the whole recur mechanism

2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.360
 that that could just be messed with.

2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:31.200
 Right.

2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:32.160
 And it could, and I'm speculating,

2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:33.080
 it could be tied to more

2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:34.680
 if you had to download into the language,

2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:37.160
 everyday language, like not feeling like yourself.

2:50:37.160 --> 2:50:39.120
 Like, so whether that be like really drunk

2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:42.880
 or really hopped up on amphetamine or, you know,

2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:45.480
 like we found it like decoupling of the default mode network

2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:48.960
 on salvinorin A, which is a smokable psychedelic,

2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:50.960
 which is a non classic psychedelic,

2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:52.760
 but another one where like DMT,

2:50:52.760 --> 2:50:54.960
 where people are often talking to entities

2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:55.800
 and that type of thing.

2:50:55.800 --> 2:50:57.280
 That was a really fun study to run.

2:50:57.280 --> 2:50:58.640
 But nonetheless, most people say

2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:00.280
 it's not a classic psychedelic

2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:04.400
 and doesn't have some of those phenomenal features

2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:06.840
 that people report from classic psychedelics

2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:11.120
 and not sort of the clear sort of ego loss type,

2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:12.920
 at least not in the way that people report it

2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:13.960
 with classic psychedelics.

2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:15.520
 So you get it with all these different drugs.

2:51:15.520 --> 2:51:18.040
 And so, and then you also see just broad,

2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:21.440
 broad changes in network activity with other networks.

2:51:21.440 --> 2:51:25.880
 And so I think that story took off a little too soon,

2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:29.000
 although, so I think, and the story that the DMN,

2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:32.400
 the default mode network relating to the self,

2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:34.800
 and I know some neuroscientists, it drives them crazy

2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:37.920
 if you say that it's the ego and that just like,

2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:42.080
 but self referential processing, if you go that far,

2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:45.120
 like that was already known before psychedelics.

2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:48.880
 Psychedelics didn't really contribute to that.

2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:52.600
 The idea that this type of brain network activity

2:51:52.600 --> 2:51:54.520
 was related to a sense of self.

2:51:56.160 --> 2:52:00.120
 But it is absolutely striking that psychedelics

2:52:00.120 --> 2:52:02.360
 that people report with pretty high reliability,

2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:06.240
 these unity experiences that where people subjectively,

2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:10.240
 like they report losing or again, like the boundaries,

2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:14.960
 however you wanna say it, like these unity experiences,

2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:16.520
 I think we can do a lot with that

2:52:16.520 --> 2:52:19.440
 in terms of figuring out the nature of the sense of self.

2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:23.360
 Now, I don't think that's the same as the hard problem

2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:25.760
 or the existence of phenomenal consciousness,

2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:27.520
 because you can build an AI system,

2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:28.720
 and you correct me if I'm wrong,

2:52:28.720 --> 2:52:31.600
 that will pass a Turing test

2:52:31.600 --> 2:52:34.800
 in terms of demonstrating the qualities

2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:37.240
 of like a sense of self.

2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:38.800
 It will talk as if there's a self

2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:40.720
 and there's probably a certain like algorithm

2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:44.960
 or whatever, like computational,

2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:49.400
 like scaling up of computations that results in somehow,

2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:52.120
 and I think this is the argument with humans,

2:52:52.120 --> 2:52:53.920
 but some have speculated this,

2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:57.600
 why do we have this illusion of the self that's evolved?

2:52:57.600 --> 2:53:01.520
 And we might find this with AI that like it works,

2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:06.280
 having a sense of self, and that's stated incorrectly,

2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:11.280
 like acting as if there is an agent at play

2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:17.000
 and behaviorally acting like there is a self,

2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:18.400
 that might kind of work.

2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:22.400
 And so you can program a computer or a robot

2:53:24.040 --> 2:53:27.360
 to basically demonstrate, have an algorithm like that

2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:28.920
 and demonstrate that type of behavior.

2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:30.960
 And I think that's completely silent

2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:33.840
 on whether there's an actual experience inside there.

2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:36.760
 I've been struggling to find the right words

2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:38.520
 in how I feel about that whole thing,

2:53:38.520 --> 2:53:42.360
 but because I've said it poorly before,

2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:44.360
 I've before said that there's no difference

2:53:44.360 --> 2:53:48.840
 between the appearance and the actual existence

2:53:48.840 --> 2:53:51.560
 of consciousness or intelligence or any of that.

2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:56.560
 What I really mean is the more the appearance

2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:00.720
 starts to look like the thing,

2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:03.400
 the more there's this area where it's like,

2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:08.400
 I don't think, our whole idea of what is real

2:54:10.640 --> 2:54:13.160
 and what is just an illusion

2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:16.760
 is not the right way to think about it.

2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:20.680
 So the whole idea is like, if you create a system

2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:22.920
 that looks like it's having fun,

2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:27.240
 the more it's realistically able to portray itself

2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:31.160
 as having fun, like there's a certain gray area

2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:34.600
 which the system is having fun.

2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.640
 And same with intelligence, same with consciousness.

2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:40.000
 And we humans wanna simplify,

2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:42.960
 like it feels like the way we simplify the existence

2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:47.960
 and the illusion of something is missing the whole truth

2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:50.480
 of the nature of reality,

2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:52.600
 which we're not yet able to understand.

2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:55.520
 Like it's the 1%, we only understand 1% currently.

2:54:55.520 --> 2:54:59.160
 So we don't have the right physics to talk about things,

2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:00.960
 we don't have the right science to talk about things.

2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:05.960
 But to me, like the faking it and actually it being true

2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:12.800
 is the difference is much smaller

2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:14.760
 than what humans would like to imagine.

2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:18.480
 That's my intuition, but the philosophers hate that

2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:21.200
 because, and guess what?

2:55:21.200 --> 2:55:23.600
 It's philosophers, what have you actually built?

2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:27.320
 So like to me is that's the difference

2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:28.840
 in philosophy and engineering.

2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:32.920
 It feels like if we push the creation, the engineering,

2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:35.160
 like fake it until you make it all the way,

2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:37.120
 which is like fake consciousness

2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:41.280
 until you realize, holy crap, this thing is conscious.

2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:42.880
 Fake intelligence until you realize,

2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:44.600
 holy crap, this is intelligence.

2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:48.360
 And from my curiosity with psychedelics

2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:52.000
 and just neurobiology and neuroscience

2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:55.680
 is like it feels, I love the armchair.

2:55:55.680 --> 2:55:57.520
 I love sitting in that armchair

2:55:57.520 --> 2:55:59.520
 because it feels like at a certain point

2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:01.880
 you're going to think about this problem

2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:04.120
 and there's going to be an aha moment.

2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:06.760
 Like that's what the armchair does.

2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:09.960
 Sometimes science prevents you from really thinking,

2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:14.360
 wait, like it's really simple.

2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:15.840
 There's something really simple.

2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:20.840
 Like there's some, there could be some dance of chemicals

2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:22.320
 that we're totally unaware of,

2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:26.760
 not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine

2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:29.320
 with which biological architectures,

2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:32.880
 but more like we were thinking of it completely wrong

2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:38.000
 that just out of the blue,

2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:41.920
 like maybe the human mind is just like a radio

2:56:41.920 --> 2:56:44.160
 that tunes into some other medium

2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:46.080
 where consciousness actually exists.

2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:49.640
 Like those weird sort of hypothetically,

2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:52.160
 like maybe we're just thinking about the human mind

2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:53.280
 totally wrong.

2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:56.840
 Maybe there's no such thing as individual intelligence.

2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:00.240
 Maybe it is all collective intelligence between humans.

2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:02.280
 Like maybe the intelligence is possessed

2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:05.520
 in the communication of language between minds.

2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:08.120
 And then in fact, consciousness is a property

2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:13.120
 of that language versus a property of the individual minds.

2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:15.360
 And somehow the neurotransmitters

2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:16.560
 will be able to connect to that.

2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:19.680
 So then AI systems can join

2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:23.600
 that common collective intelligence, that common language,

2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:25.360
 like just thinking completely outside of the box.

2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:26.720
 I just said a bunch of crazy things.

2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:29.800
 I don't know, but thinking outside the box

2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:33.280
 and there's something about subtle manipulation

2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:35.280
 of the chemicals of the brain,

2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:40.280
 which feels like the best or one of the great chances

2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:43.800
 of the scientific process leading us

2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:46.880
 to an actual understanding of the hard problem.

2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:48.880
 So I am very hopeful that,

2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:52.240
 and so I mean, I'm a radical empiricist,

2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:54.160
 which I'm very strong with that.

2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:56.640
 Like that's what, you know,

2:57:56.640 --> 2:57:57.960
 so, you know, science isn't about

2:57:57.960 --> 2:57:59.960
 ultimately being a materialist.

2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:02.720
 It's like, it's about being an empiricist in my view.

2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:04.520
 And so, for example, I'm very fascinated

2:58:04.520 --> 2:58:06.400
 by the so called Psi phenomenon,

2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:08.320
 you know, like stuff that people just kind of reject

2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:09.160
 out of hand.

2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:12.840
 You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff

2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:16.320
 with an idea of, you know, hey, look,

2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:17.360
 you know, what we consider,

2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:19.840
 like anything exists as natural.

2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:23.480
 And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature,

2:58:23.480 --> 2:58:26.480
 like what we recognize as in nature moves,

2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:28.720
 like what we do today and what we know today

2:58:28.720 --> 2:58:31.280
 would only be described as magic 500 years ago,

2:58:31.280 --> 2:58:32.800
 or even a hundred years ago, some of it.

2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:36.080
 So there will surely be things that,

2:58:36.080 --> 2:58:37.760
 like you explained these phenomenon

2:58:37.760 --> 2:58:39.520
 that just sound like completely,

2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:41.200
 they're supernatural now,

2:58:41.200 --> 2:58:42.960
 where there may be, for some of it,

2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:44.800
 like some of it might turn out to be a complete bunk

2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:47.120
 and some of it might turn out to be,

2:58:47.120 --> 2:58:49.120
 it's just another layer of nature,

2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:50.920
 whether we're talking about multiple dimensions

2:58:50.920 --> 2:58:52.040
 that are invoked or something,

2:58:52.040 --> 2:58:53.640
 we don't even have the language towards.

2:58:53.640 --> 2:58:55.560
 And what you're saying about the moving together

2:58:55.560 --> 2:58:58.840
 of the model and the real thing of conscious,

2:58:58.840 --> 2:59:00.720
 like, I'm very sympathetic to that.

2:59:00.720 --> 2:59:03.240
 So that's that part of like, on the armchair side,

2:59:03.240 --> 2:59:06.160
 where I want to be clear, I can't say this as a scientist,

2:59:06.160 --> 2:59:07.840
 but just in terms of speculating,

2:59:07.840 --> 2:59:11.280
 I find myself attracted to these,

2:59:12.640 --> 2:59:15.760
 more of the sort of the panpsychism ideas.

2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:17.600
 And that kind of makes sense to me.

2:59:17.600 --> 2:59:19.000
 I don't know if that's what you meant there,

2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:20.160
 but it seemed like related,

2:59:20.160 --> 2:59:25.160
 the sense that ultimately if you were completely modeling,

2:59:26.880 --> 2:59:28.960
 like it's like, if you completely modeling,

2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:31.400
 unless you dismiss like the idea

2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:33.080
 that there is a phenomenal consciousness,

2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:33.920
 which I think is hard,

2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:35.760
 given that we all, I seem like I have one,

2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:37.440
 that's really all I know.

2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:41.560
 But if that's so compelling, I can't just dismiss that.

2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:44.920
 Like if you take that as a given,

2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:49.080
 then the only way for the model and the real thing to merge

2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:54.080
 is if there is something baked into the nature of reality,

2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:57.760
 sort of like in the history of like,

2:59:57.760 --> 3:00:00.040
 there are certain just like fundamental forces

3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:03.280
 or fundamental, like, and that's been useful for us.

3:00:03.280 --> 3:00:04.520
 And sometimes we find out

3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:05.680
 that that's pointing towards something else,

3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:09.320
 or sometimes it's still, seems like it's a fundamental,

3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:11.040
 and sometimes it's a placeholder for someone to figure out,

3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:13.120
 but there's something like, this is just a given.

3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:16.200
 This is just, and sometimes something like gravity

3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:17.400
 seems like a very good placeholder,

3:00:17.400 --> 3:00:20.040
 and then there's something better that comes to replace it.

3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:23.200
 So, I kind of think about like consciousness

3:00:23.200 --> 3:00:25.160
 and I didn't, I kind of had this inclination

3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:27.080
 before I knew there was a term for it,

3:00:27.080 --> 3:00:31.960
 Rosalian monism, the idea that, which is a form of,

3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:35.600
 again, I'm an armchair philosopher, not a very good one.

3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:37.120
 Broadly panpsychism, by the way,

3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:40.440
 is the idea that sort of consciousness permeates all matter

3:00:40.440 --> 3:00:44.640
 and, or it's a fundamental part of physics

3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:45.960
 of the universe kind of thing.

3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:49.120
 So, and there's a lot of different flavors of it

3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:51.240
 as you're alluding to.

3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:53.560
 And something that struck me as like consistent

3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:56.560
 with some just, you know, inclinations of mine,

3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:01.560
 just total speculation is this idea of everything we know

3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:06.400
 in science and with most of the stuff we think of physics,

3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:11.400
 you know, really describes, it's all interactions.

3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:13.800
 It's not the thing itself.

3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:18.800
 Like there is something to, and this sounds very new agey,

3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:21.960
 which is why it's very difficult

3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:24.960
 and I have a high bullshit like meter and everything,

3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:27.960
 but like an isness, I mean, think about like Huxley,

3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:30.120
 all this Huxley with his mescaline experience

3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:32.600
 and doors of procession, like there's an isness there

3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:37.600
 in Alan Watson, like there is a nature of being,

3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:39.200
 again, very new agey sounding,

3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:41.760
 but maybe there is something to,

3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:43.280
 and when we say consciousness,

3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:45.160
 we think of like this human experience,

3:01:45.160 --> 3:01:47.440
 but maybe that's just, that's so processed

3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:52.440
 and so, that's so far, so derivative of this kind

3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:54.800
 of basic thing that we wouldn't even recognize

3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:57.480
 the basic thing, but the basic thing might just be,

3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:00.480
 this is not about the interaction between particles.

3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:05.480
 This is what it is like to exist as a particle.

3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:07.600
 And maybe it's not even particles.

3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:09.600
 Maybe it's like space time itself.

3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:11.720
 I mean, again, totally in the speculation area.

3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:14.120
 And something else based on, so it's funny

3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:16.120
 because we don't have this, neither the science

3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:18.520
 nor the proper language to talk about it.

3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:21.080
 All we have is kind of a little intuitions

3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:24.880
 about there might be something in that direction

3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:26.760
 of the darkness to pursue.

3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:31.360
 And in that sense, I find panpsychism interesting

3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:35.440
 in that like, it does feel like there's something

3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:38.000
 fundamental here, that consciousness is,

3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.720
 it's not just like, okay, so the flip side,

3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:43.800
 consciousness could be just a very basic

3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:48.520
 and trivial symptom, like a little hack of nature

3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:53.320
 that's useful for like survival of an organism.

3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:55.160
 It's not something fundamental.

3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:00.160
 It's just this very basic, boring chemical thing

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.320
 that somehow has convinced us humans,

3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:06.720
 because we're very human centric, we're very self centric,

3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:08.360
 that this is somehow really important,

3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:10.520
 but it's actually pretty obvious.

3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:13.520
 But, or it could be something really fundamental

3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:15.360
 to the nature of the universe.

3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:18.640
 So both of those are to me pretty compelling.

3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:21.720
 And I think eventually scientifically testable.

3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:24.120
 It is so frustrating that it's hard to design

3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:25.920
 a scientific experiment currently,

3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:29.600
 but I think that's how Nobel Prizes are won,

3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:32.440
 is nobody did it until they do it.

3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:36.720
 The reason I lean towards, and again, armchair spec,

3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:40.760
 if I had to bet like $1,000 on which one of these

3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:44.040
 ultimately be proved, I would lean towards,

3:03:44.040 --> 3:03:47.640
 I'd put my bets on something like panpsychism

3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:51.640
 rather than the emergence of phenomenal consciousness

3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:55.240
 through complexity or computational complexity,

3:03:55.240 --> 3:03:58.760
 because, although certainly if there is

3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:01.240
 some underlying fundamental consciousness,

3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:06.240
 it's clearly being processed in this way through computation

3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.640
 in terms of resulting in our experience

3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:11.440
 and the experience presumably of other animals.

3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:14.440
 But the reason I would bet on panpsychism is to me,

3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:19.400
 Occam's razor, in terms of truly the hard problem,

3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:22.360
 at some point you have an inside looking out.

3:04:22.360 --> 3:04:24.440
 And even looking refers to vision and it doesn't,

3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:26.760
 that's just an example, but just,

3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:29.880
 there's an inside experiencing something.

3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:34.760
 At some point of complexity, all of a sudden,

3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:36.440
 you start from this objective universe

3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:38.440
 and all we know about is interactions between things

3:04:38.440 --> 3:04:39.680
 and things happen.

3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:42.200
 And at this certain level of complexity,

3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:44.200
 magically there's an inside.

3:04:45.120 --> 3:04:48.760
 That to me doesn't pass Occam's razor as easily

3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:53.760
 as maybe there is a fundamental property of the universe.

3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:56.640
 There's both subjective and objective.

3:04:56.640 --> 3:04:58.800
 There is both interactions amongst things

3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:02.600
 and there is the thing itself.

3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:03.440
 Yes.

3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:04.260
 But, yeah.

3:05:04.260 --> 3:05:05.600
 So I'm of two minds.

3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:08.000
 I agree with you totally on half my mind.

3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:09.960
 And the other half is I've seen,

3:05:09.960 --> 3:05:12.000
 looking at cellular automata a lot,

3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.680
 which is, it sure does seem that we don't understand

3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:18.200
 anything about complexity.

3:05:18.200 --> 3:05:21.480
 Like the emergence, just the property.

3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:25.920
 In fact, that could be a fundamental property of reality

3:05:25.920 --> 3:05:28.200
 is something within the emergence

3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:30.400
 from simple things interacting,

3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:33.400
 somehow miraculous things happen.

3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:36.080
 And like that, I don't understand that.

3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:38.840
 That could be fundamental.

3:05:38.840 --> 3:05:43.840
 That like something about the layers of abstraction,

3:05:45.120 --> 3:05:46.760
 like layers of reality,

3:05:46.760 --> 3:05:48.760
 like really small things interacting

3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:53.760
 and then on another layer emerges actual complicated behavior

3:05:54.720 --> 3:05:57.080
 even on the underlying thing is super simple.

3:05:57.080 --> 3:06:00.120
 Like that process, we don't really don't understand either.

3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:02.880
 And that could be bigger than any of the things

3:06:02.880 --> 3:06:04.760
 we're talking about.

3:06:04.760 --> 3:06:07.840
 That's the basic force behind everything

3:06:07.840 --> 3:06:09.600
 that's happening in the universe

3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:14.600
 is from simple things, complex phenomena can happen.

3:06:14.600 --> 3:06:16.560
 Phenomena can happen.

3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:19.320
 And the thing that gives me pause

3:06:19.320 --> 3:06:24.320
 is that I'm concerned about a threshold there.

3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:26.200
 Like how is it likely that,

3:06:26.200 --> 3:06:28.800
 now there may be, and there may be some qualitative shift

3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:30.440
 that in the realm of like,

3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:32.840
 we don't even understand complexity yet,

3:06:32.840 --> 3:06:33.680
 like you're saying.

3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:34.800
 Like, so maybe there is,

3:06:34.800 --> 3:06:38.080
 but I do think like if it is a result of the complexity,

3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:41.440
 well, just having helium versus hydrogen

3:06:41.440 --> 3:06:43.000
 is a form of complexity.

3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.840
 Having the existence of stars versus clouds of gas

3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:46.680
 is a complexity.

3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:50.600
 The entire universe has been this increasing complexity.

3:06:50.600 --> 3:06:53.280
 And so that kind of brings me back to then the other

3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:54.640
 of like, okay, if there's,

3:06:55.720 --> 3:06:57.880
 if it's about complexity, then we should,

3:06:57.880 --> 3:06:59.840
 then it exists at a certain level

3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:02.560
 in these simple systems like a star

3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:05.520
 or a more complex atom.

3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:06.880
 Hence the panpsychism, that's right.

3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:09.600
 But we humans, the qualitative shift,

3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:13.400
 we might have evolved to appreciate certain kinds

3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:14.400
 of thresholds.

3:07:14.400 --> 3:07:15.360
 Right. Yeah.

3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:18.400
 I do think it's likely that this idea that,

3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:20.120
 whether or not there's an inner experience,

3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:22.320
 which is phenomenal, it's the hard problem,

3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:26.440
 that acting like an agent, like having an algorithm

3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:29.400
 that basically like operates as if there is an agent,

3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:32.840
 that's clearly a thing that I think has worked

3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:37.160
 and that there is a whole lot to figure out there that,

3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:40.280
 and I think psychedelics will be extremely helpful

3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:44.360
 in figuring more out about that because they do seem

3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:48.000
 to a lot of times eliminate that or whatever,

3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.560
 radically shift that sense of self.

3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:53.320
 Let me ask the craziest question.

3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:54.920
 Indulge me for a second.

3:07:54.920 --> 3:07:57.480
 I'll, this is a joke.

3:07:57.480 --> 3:07:58.640
 Compared to what we've been talking about?

3:07:58.640 --> 3:07:59.480
 Like, okay.

3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:02.600
 No, all of this is assigned,

3:08:02.600 --> 3:08:05.840
 all of that, despite the caveats about armchair,

3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:08.680
 I think is within the reach of science.

3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:11.000
 Let me ask one that's kind of,

3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:12.240
 also within the reach of science,

3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:15.620
 but as Joe likes to say, it's entirely possible, right?

3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:21.480
 Is it possible that with these DMT trips,

3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:25.080
 when you meet entities, is it possible

3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:29.560
 that these entities are extraterrestrial life forms?

3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:33.200
 Like our understanding of little green men

3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.560
 with aliens that show up is totally off.

3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:37.600
 I often think about this,

3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:42.080
 like what would actual extraterrestrial intelligence

3:08:42.080 --> 3:08:43.760
 look like?

3:08:43.760 --> 3:08:47.920
 And my sense is it will look like very different

3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:51.480
 from anything we can even begin to comprehend.

3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:52.840
 And how would it communicate?

3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:53.840
 And how would it communicate?

3:08:53.840 --> 3:08:55.320
 Would it be necessarily spaceships

3:08:55.320 --> 3:08:57.040
 within your civil travel or?

3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:00.000
 Could it be communicating through chemicals,

3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:03.440
 through if there's the panpsychism situation,

3:09:03.440 --> 3:09:05.720
 if there's something, not if.

3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:09.840
 I almost for sure know we don't understand a lot

3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:12.060
 about the function of our mind in connection

3:09:12.060 --> 3:09:16.240
 to the fabric of the physics in the universe.

3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:17.360
 A lot of people seem to think

3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:20.020
 we have theoretical physics pretty figured out.

3:09:20.020 --> 3:09:22.720
 I have my doubts because I'm pretty sure

3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:24.640
 it always feels like we have everything figured out

3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:25.480
 until we don't.

3:09:25.480 --> 3:09:28.640
 Right, I mean, there's no grand unifying theory yet, right?

3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:32.300
 But even then, we could be missing out,

3:09:32.300 --> 3:09:34.160
 like the concept of the universe

3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:36.040
 just can be completely off.

3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:38.700
 Like how many other universes are there?

3:09:38.700 --> 3:09:40.480
 All those kinds of things.

3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:43.480
 I mean, just the basic nature of information,

3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:48.480
 the time, time, all of those things.

3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:51.600
 Yeah, whether that's just like a thing we assign value to

3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:53.700
 or whether it's fundamental or not,

3:09:53.700 --> 3:09:57.400
 that's whole, I could talk to Shankar forever

3:09:57.400 --> 3:09:58.800
 about whether time is emergent

3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:01.120
 or fundamental to the reality.

3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:04.240
 But is it possible that the entities we meet

3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:06.580
 are actual alien life forms?

3:10:06.580 --> 3:10:08.160
 Do you ever think about that?

3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:10.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.

3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:13.360
 And I've, to some degree, laid my cards out

3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:16.080
 by identifying as a radical empiricist, you know?

3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:18.600
 And it's like, so the answer, is it possible?

3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:20.440
 And I think, you know, ultimately,

3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:22.240
 if you're a good scientist, you gotta say,

3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:25.760
 now that's at the extremes, it's a like, yes.

3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:26.600
 Yes.

3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:30.040
 It might get more interesting when you're asked to guess

3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:31.280
 about the probability of that.

3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:34.480
 Is that a one in a million, one in a trillion,

3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:38.220
 one in more than the number of atoms

3:10:38.220 --> 3:10:41.000
 in the universe probability?

3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:44.460
 And as an empiricist, it's like, what is a good testable?

3:10:44.460 --> 3:10:47.200
 Like, how would you know the answer to that question?

3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:49.440
 Or how would you be able to validate?

3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:50.280
 I mean.

3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:52.480
 Well, can you get some information that's verifiable,

3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:57.480
 like information about some other planet or some aspect?

3:11:01.720 --> 3:11:03.440
 And gosh, it would be an interesting range,

3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:06.440
 but what range of discovery that we can anticipate

3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:10.080
 we're gonna know within, you know, whatever,

3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:13.400
 a few years, next five, 10, 20 years,

3:11:13.400 --> 3:11:17.000
 and seeing if you can get that information now,

3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:20.160
 and then over time, it might be verified.

3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:23.320
 You know, the type of thing like, you know, part of Einstein's

3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:24.880
 work was ultimately verified,

3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:26.480
 not until decades and decades later,

3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:31.300
 at least certain aspects through empirical observations.

3:11:31.300 --> 3:11:34.600
 But it's also possible that the alien beings

3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:36.520
 have a very different value system

3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:37.720
 and perception of the world,

3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:40.540
 where all of this little capitalistic improvements

3:11:40.540 --> 3:11:42.640
 that we're all after, like predicting,

3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:45.360
 the concept of predicting the future too,

3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:50.200
 is like totally useless to other life forms

3:11:51.180 --> 3:11:56.180
 that perhaps think in a much different way,

3:11:56.520 --> 3:11:58.980
 maybe a more transcendent way, I don't know, but.

3:11:58.980 --> 3:12:00.680
 So they wouldn't even sign the consent form

3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:03.200
 to be a participant in our experiment?

3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:05.880
 They would not, they would not.

3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:07.000
 And they wouldn't even understand

3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:08.280
 the nature of these experiments.

3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:12.080
 I mean, maybe it's purely in the realm

3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:16.800
 of the consciousness thing that we talked about.

3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:20.920
 So communicating in a way that is totally different

3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:23.280
 than the kinds of communication that we think of

3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:24.240
 as on Earth.

3:12:24.240 --> 3:12:27.880
 Like what's the purpose of communication for us?

3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:30.280
 For us humans, the purpose of communication

3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:32.980
 is sharing ideas, it feels like.

3:12:32.980 --> 3:12:37.880
 Like converging, like it's the Dawkins like memes.

3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:41.640
 It's like we're sharing ideas in order to figure out

3:12:41.640 --> 3:12:45.960
 how to collaborate together, to get food into our systems

3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:49.120
 and procreate and then like murder everybody

3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:52.680
 in the neighboring tribe because they'll steal our food.

3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:54.920
 Like we are all about sharing ideas.

3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:59.840
 Maybe it's possible to have another alien life form

3:12:59.840 --> 3:13:02.140
 that's more about sharing experiences.

3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:05.960
 Like it's less about ideas, I don't know.

3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.920
 And maybe that'll be us in a few years.

3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:08.760
 How could it not?

3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:11.520
 Like instead of explaining something laboriously to you,

3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:13.760
 like having people describe the ineffable

3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:17.160
 psychedelic experience, like if we could record that

3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:19.880
 and then get the neural link of 50 years from now,

3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:21.560
 like, oh, just plug this into your...

3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:22.400
 Just transferring the experiences.

3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:24.920
 Yeah, it's like, oh, now you feel what it's like.

3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:27.600
 And like, in one sense, like how could we not go there?

3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:28.640
 And then you get into the realm,

3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:30.100
 especially when you throw time into it,

3:13:30.100 --> 3:13:32.480
 are the aliens us in the future?

3:13:32.480 --> 3:13:35.380
 Or even like a transcendental, temporal,

3:13:35.380 --> 3:13:37.400
 like the us beyond time.

3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:39.240
 Like, I don't know, like you get into this realm

3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:42.720
 and there's a lot of possibilities, yeah.

3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:44.960
 But I think, you know, there's one psychedelic researcher

3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:49.240
 that's who did high dose DMT research in the 90s

3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:50.860
 who speculated that,

3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:54.120
 that there was a lot of alien encounter experiences.

3:13:54.120 --> 3:13:57.480
 Like maybe these are like entities

3:13:57.480 --> 3:13:59.520
 from some other dimension or...

3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:02.160
 He labeled it as speculation, but you know.

3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:03.760
 Do you remember the name?

3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:04.800
 Oh, Rick Strassman.

3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:05.640
 Oh, Rick Strassman.

3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:07.720
 Yeah, yeah, the DMT work.

3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:10.840
 He labeled it as speculation, but you know,

3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:15.840
 I think that, yeah, I think we'd be wise to kind of,

3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:18.180
 you know, it's always that balance

3:14:18.180 --> 3:14:22.780
 between being empirically grounded and skeptical,

3:14:22.780 --> 3:14:24.520
 but also not being, and I think in science,

3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:27.840
 well, often we are too closed,

3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:29.480
 which relates to like, you're talking about Elon,

3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:31.880
 like in academia, it's like often like,

3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:33.260
 I think you're punished for thinking

3:14:33.260 --> 3:14:35.000
 or even talking about 20 years from now

3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.480
 because it's just so far removed from your next grant

3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:41.920
 or for your next paper that it's easy pickings

3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:45.280
 and you know, that you're not allowed to speculate, so.

3:14:45.280 --> 3:14:47.200
 I think though, I'm a huge fan of,

3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:52.200
 I think the best way to me at least to practice like science

3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:57.320
 or to practice good engineering is to like do two things

3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:00.440
 and just bounce off, like spend most of the time

3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:03.520
 doing the rigor of the day to day

3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:05.740
 of what can be accomplished now in the engineering space

3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:08.040
 or in the science, like what can actually,

3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:10.600
 what can you construct an experiment around,

3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:14.080
 do like that, the usual rigor of the scientific process,

3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:17.640
 but then every once in a while on a regular basis,

3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:21.960
 to step outside and talk about aliens and consciousness

3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:25.480
 and we just walk along the line of things

3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.680
 that are outside the reach of science currently.

3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:33.680
 Free will, the illusion or the perception

3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:37.760
 or the experience of free will of anything,

3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:41.680
 just the entirety of it, being able to travel in time

3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:45.480
 through wormholes, it's like it's really useful to do that,

3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:49.320
 especially as a scientist, like if that's all you do,

3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:53.100
 you go into a land where you're not actually able

3:15:53.100 --> 3:15:56.460
 to think rigorously, there's something at least to me

3:15:56.460 --> 3:15:59.200
 that if you just hop back and forth,

3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:03.440
 you're able to, I think do exactly the kind of injection

3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:06.280
 of out of the box thinking

3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:08.840
 to your regular day to day science

3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:12.080
 that will ultimately lead to breakthroughs.

3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:15.140
 But you have to be the good scientist most of the time.

3:16:15.140 --> 3:16:17.120
 And that's consistent with what I think

3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:19.460
 the great scientists of history,

3:16:19.460 --> 3:16:24.460
 like in most of the history, the greats,

3:16:25.060 --> 3:16:29.480
 the Newtons and Einsteins, I mean, they were,

3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:31.400
 there was less of, and this change I think

3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:33.760
 is time marched on, but less of a separation

3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:34.760
 between those realms.

3:16:34.760 --> 3:16:36.880
 It's like, there's the inclination alpha,

3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:41.800
 it's like, as a scientist, and this is science,

3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:44.160
 this is my work, and then this, it's like my inclination

3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:46.320
 to say, oh, Lex, don't take me too seriously

3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:47.320
 because this is my armchair,

3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:48.480
 I'm not speaking as a scientist,

3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:52.760
 I'm bending over backwards to say, to divide that self,

3:16:52.760 --> 3:16:55.760
 and maybe there's been less of, there's been that evolution

3:16:55.760 --> 3:17:00.240
 and that's, and like the greats didn't see that.

3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:02.160
 I mean, Newton, and you go back in time,

3:17:02.160 --> 3:17:04.560
 and it's like that obviously connects to then religion,

3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:05.900
 especially if that is the predominant world,

3:17:05.900 --> 3:17:10.400
 where Newton, like how much time did he spend

3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:12.760
 trying to decode the Bible and whatnot?

3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:14.400
 Maybe that was a dead end.

3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:17.080
 But it's like, if you really believe in that,

3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:20.240
 in that particular religion, and you're this mastermind,

3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:22.400
 and you're trying to figure things out,

3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:24.640
 it's not like, oh, this is what my job description is

3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:25.700
 and this is what the grant wants.

3:17:25.700 --> 3:17:28.600
 It's like, no, I've got this limited time on the planet,

3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:30.920
 I'm gonna figure out as much stuff as possible.

3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:32.360
 Nothing is off the table

3:17:32.360 --> 3:17:34.560
 and you're just putting it all together.

3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:35.880
 So this is kind of this trajectory

3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:38.960
 is really related to this, the siloing in science.

3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:42.880
 Like, again, related to my like, oh, I'm not a philosopher,

3:17:44.640 --> 3:17:46.040
 whether you consider that a science or not,

3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:47.080
 not empirical science,

3:17:47.080 --> 3:17:49.240
 but like going to these different disciplines,

3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:53.080
 like the greats didn't observe the boundaries,

3:17:53.080 --> 3:17:56.560
 the boundaries didn't exist, they didn't observe them.

3:17:56.560 --> 3:17:59.440
 So speaking of the finiteness

3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:03.520
 of our existence in this world,

3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:09.120
 so on the front of psychedelics and teaching you lessons

3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:11.040
 as a researcher, as a human being,

3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:16.080
 what have you learned about death, about mortality,

3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:18.560
 about the finiteness of our existence?

3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:21.800
 Are you yourself afraid of death?

3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:25.840
 And how has your view, do you ponder it?

3:18:25.840 --> 3:18:28.320
 And has your view of your mortality changed

3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:30.360
 with the research you've done?

3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:34.240
 Yeah, yeah, so I do ponder it and...

3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:35.080
 Are you afraid of death?

3:18:35.080 --> 3:18:37.760
 Probably on a daily basis, I ponder it.

3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:40.120
 I'd have to pick it apart more and say,

3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:46.080
 yeah, I am afraid of dying, like the process of dying.

3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:48.840
 I'm not afraid of being dead.

3:18:48.840 --> 3:18:49.800
 I mean, I'm not afraid of,

3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:51.960
 I think it was Penn Jillette that said,

3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:53.440
 and he may have gotten it from someone else,

3:18:53.440 --> 3:18:58.400
 but I'm not afraid of the year 1862 before I existed.

3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:02.520
 I'm not afraid of the year 2262 after I'm gone.

3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:03.600
 It's gonna be fine.

3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:07.160
 But yeah, dying, I'd be lying

3:19:07.160 --> 3:19:11.000
 if I said I wasn't afraid of dying.

3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:13.840
 And so there's both the process of dying,

3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:15.200
 yeah, it's usually not good.

3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:18.720
 It'd be nice if it was after many, many years

3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:23.520
 and just sort of, I'd rather not die in my sleep.

3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:24.720
 I'd rather kind of be conscious,

3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:26.920
 but sort of just die, fade out with old age maybe.

3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:31.760
 But just being in an accident and horrible diseases,

3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:33.160
 I've seen enough loved ones.

3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:34.360
 It's like, yeah, this is not good.

3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:37.320
 This is enough to be, I'd like to say

3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:40.760
 that I'm peaceful and sort of balanced enough

3:19:40.760 --> 3:19:41.600
 that I'm not concerned at all,

3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:44.360
 but no, like, yeah, I'm afraid of dying.

3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:48.360
 But I'm also concerned about, I think about family.

3:19:48.360 --> 3:19:52.000
 I'm really, I'm afraid or at least concerned

3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:55.600
 about like not being there,

3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:57.720
 like with a three year old, not being there,

3:19:57.720 --> 3:20:01.200
 not being there for him and my wife

3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:03.840
 and my mom the rest of her life.

3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:05.360
 I'm concerned about not,

3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:07.120
 I'm concerned more about like the harm

3:20:07.120 --> 3:20:10.000
 that it would cause if I left prematurely.

3:20:10.000 --> 3:20:11.720
 And then kind of even bigger along the lines

3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:13.440
 of some of the stuff that forward thinking

3:20:13.440 --> 3:20:14.280
 we've been talking about.

3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:17.920
 I think maybe way too much about just like,

3:20:17.920 --> 3:20:19.920
 and I'll never know the answer.

3:20:19.920 --> 3:20:22.280
 So even if I lived to 120,

3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:24.440
 but like, I wanna know as much as I can,

3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:28.680
 but like, how is this gonna work out like as humans?

3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:30.680
 Are we, and a big one, I think is are we gonna,

3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:33.280
 and I don't think unfortunately I'm gonna learn it

3:20:34.280 --> 3:20:37.240
 in my lifetime, even if I live to a ripe old age,

3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:38.800
 but well, I don't know.

3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:39.840
 Is this gonna work out?

3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:41.640
 Like, are we gonna escape the planet?

3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:42.880
 I think that's one of the biggies.

3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:45.200
 Like, are we gonna, like the survival of the speed,

3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:48.560
 like I think the next, like the time we're in now,

3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:51.040
 it's like with the nuclear weapons, with pandemics

3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:54.440
 and with, I mean, we're gonna get to the point

3:20:54.440 --> 3:20:57.520
 where anyone can build a hydrogen bomb.

3:20:57.520 --> 3:21:00.160
 Like, you know, it's like, you just like the,

3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:02.000
 or engineer like the, you know,

3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:03.720
 something that's a million times worse than COVID

3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:04.560
 and then just spread it.

3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:06.960
 It's like, we're getting to this period of,

3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:09.160
 and then not to mention climate change, you know,

3:21:09.160 --> 3:21:10.920
 it's like, although I think that's not,

3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:12.680
 there's probably gonna be surviving humans

3:21:12.680 --> 3:21:15.400
 with that regard, you know, but it could be really bad.

3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:19.120
 But these existential threats, I think the only real

3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:22.080
 guarantee that we're gonna get another, you name it,

3:21:22.080 --> 3:21:26.840
 thousand million, whatever years is like diversity,

3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:31.400
 diversify our portfolio, get off the planet, you know,

3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:33.080
 don't leave this one, hopefully we keep, you know,

3:21:33.080 --> 3:21:36.640
 but like, and I, you know, it's like,

3:21:36.640 --> 3:21:40.600
 either we're gonna get snuffed out like really quickly

3:21:40.600 --> 3:21:44.000
 or we're gonna like, if we reach that point

3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.880
 and it's gonna be over the next like 100, 200 years,

3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:51.880
 like we're probably gonna survive like until like,

3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:55.240
 I mean, you know, like our sun, like, and even beyond that,

3:21:55.240 --> 3:21:57.600
 like we're probably gonna be talking about millions

3:21:57.600 --> 3:21:58.640
 and millions of years.

3:21:58.640 --> 3:22:01.840
 It's like, and we're, I don't know,

3:22:01.840 --> 3:22:04.280
 in terms of the planet, 4 billion years into this.

3:22:04.280 --> 3:22:06.160
 And depending on how you count our species, you know,

3:22:06.160 --> 3:22:08.920
 we're, you know, we're millions of years into this.

3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:11.720
 And it's like, this is like the point of the relay race

3:22:11.720 --> 3:22:13.760
 where we can really screw up.

3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:15.280
 So that would make you feel pretty good

3:22:15.280 --> 3:22:19.080
 when you're on your deathbed at 120 years old

3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:21.480
 and there's something hopeful about,

3:22:21.480 --> 3:22:24.800
 there's a colony starting up on Mars and it's like.

3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:27.320
 Yeah, Titan, like whatever, you know, like, yeah,

3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:29.340
 like that we have these colonies out there

3:22:29.340 --> 3:22:33.440
 that would tell me like, yeah, then at least we'd be good

3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:36.860
 until like the, you know, hopefully, probably

3:22:36.860 --> 3:22:40.400
 until the sun goes red giant, you know what I mean?

3:22:40.400 --> 3:22:43.120
 Rather than, oh, like 20 years from now

3:22:43.120 --> 3:22:46.280
 when there's someone with their finger on the nuclear button

3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:50.520
 that just, you know, misperceives, you know, the radar,

3:22:50.520 --> 3:22:54.360
 you know, like the signal they think Russia's attacking,

3:22:54.360 --> 3:22:56.120
 they're really not or China.

3:22:56.120 --> 3:22:58.920
 And like, that's probably how a nuclear accident,

3:22:58.920 --> 3:23:01.500
 war is gonna start rather than, you know,

3:23:01.500 --> 3:23:03.920
 or the, like I said, these other horrible things.

3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:07.760
 Does it not make you sad that you won't be there

3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:10.520
 if we are successful at proliferating

3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:13.680
 throughout the observable universe

3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:17.680
 that you won't be there to experience any of it?

3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:19.080
 Just the ego death, right?

3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:21.800
 It's the death, because you're still gonna die

3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:23.920
 and it's still gonna be over.

3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:28.480
 That's, you know, Ernest Becker and those folks

3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:33.480
 really emphasize the terror of death that if we're honest,

3:23:33.480 --> 3:23:36.040
 we'll discover if we search within ourselves,

3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:38.800
 which is like, this thing is gonna be over.

3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:43.800
 Most of our existence is based on the illusion

3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:47.000
 that it's gonna go forever.

3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:50.400
 And when you sort of realize it's actually gonna be over,

3:23:50.400 --> 3:23:53.220
 like today, like I might murder you

3:23:53.220 --> 3:23:54.820
 at the end of this conversation.

3:23:54.820 --> 3:23:59.820
 And it might be over today, or like on going home,

3:23:59.820 --> 3:24:02.000
 this might be your last day on this earth.

3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:07.000
 And it's, I mean, like pondering that,

3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:11.400
 I suppose one thing to be me,

3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:15.040
 I, if I were to push back, it's interesting,

3:24:16.360 --> 3:24:21.360
 is you actually, I think you see comfort in the sadness

3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:24.560
 of how unfortunate it will be for your family

3:24:24.560 --> 3:24:27.440
 to not have you, because the really,

3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:32.440
 even the deeper, yes, but that's the simple fear.

3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:39.080
 Even the deeper terror is like this thing

3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:41.340
 doesn't last forever.

3:24:41.340 --> 3:24:46.280
 Like I think, I don't know, like it's hard to put

3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:49.080
 the right words to it, but it feels like

3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:54.080
 that's not truly acknowledged by us, by each of us.

3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:57.080
 Yeah, I think this is the, I mean,

3:24:57.080 --> 3:24:59.080
 getting back to the psychedelics in terms of the people

3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:01.880
 and our work with cancer patients who,

3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:03.680
 we had psilocybin sessions to help them,

3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:08.680
 and it did substantially help them, the vast majority,

3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:10.880
 in terms of dealing with these existential issues.

3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:12.280
 And I think, you know, it's something we,

3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:15.080
 I could say that I really feel that I've come along

3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:18.080
 in that both like being with folks who have died

3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:20.880
 that are close to me, and then also that work,

3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:23.080
 I think are the two biggies in sort of,

3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:26.080
 you know, I think I've come along in that,

3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:31.080
 that sort of acceptance of this, like it's not gonna last.

3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:33.080
 And whether at the personal level

3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:35.080
 or even at the species level, like at some point,

3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:37.080
 all the stars are gonna fade out,

3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:38.080
 and it's gonna be the realm of,

3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:40.080
 which is gonna be the vast majority,

3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:41.080
 unless there's a big crunch,

3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:43.080
 which apparently doesn't seem likely.

3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:45.080
 Like most of the universe, there's this blink of an eye

3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:47.080
 that's happening right now that life is even possible,

3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:49.080
 like the era of stars.

3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:52.080
 So it's like, we're gonna fade out at some point.

3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:55.080
 Like, you know, and you know,

3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:58.080
 then we get at this level of consciousness and like, okay,

3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:00.080
 maybe there is life after death.

3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:02.080
 Maybe there's, maybe time's an illusion.

3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:04.080
 Like that part I'm ready for.

3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:06.080
 Like, I'm like, you know, like that,

3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:08.080
 that would be really great.

3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:10.080
 And I'm looking, I'm not afraid of that at all.

3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:12.080
 It's like, even if it's just strange,

3:26:12.080 --> 3:26:14.080
 like if I could push a button to enter that door,

3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:16.080
 I mean, I'm not gonna, you know, die,

3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:18.080
 you know, I can kill myself, but it's like,

3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:20.080
 if I could take a peek at what that reality is

3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:22.080
 or choose at the end of my life,

3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:25.080
 if I could choose of entering into a universe

3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:28.080
 where there is an afterlife of something completely unknown

3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:29.080
 versus one where there's none,

3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:32.080
 I think I'd say, well, let's see what's behind that.

3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:34.080
 That's a true scientist way of thinking.

3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:36.080
 If there's a door, you're excited about opening it

3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:38.080
 and going in.

3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:39.080
 Right.

3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:43.080
 When I am attracted to this idea, like, you know,

3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:45.080
 and I recognize it's easier said than done

3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:47.080
 to say I'm okay with not existing.

3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:50.080
 It's like the real test is like, okay, check me on my deathbed.

3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:52.080
 You know, it's like, oh, I'll be all right.

3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:55.080
 It's a beautiful thing and the humility of surrendering.

3:26:55.080 --> 3:26:58.080
 And I really hope, and I think I'd probably be more likely

3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:01.080
 to be in that realm right now than I would,

3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:05.080
 or check me when I get a terminal cancer diagnosis,

3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:07.080
 and I really hope I'm more in that realm.

3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:10.080
 But I know enough about human nature to know that, like,

3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:12.080
 I can't really speak to that

3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:14.080
 because I haven't been in that situation.

3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:17.080
 And I think there can be a beauty to that

3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:19.080
 and the transcendence of like, yeah,

3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:21.080
 and, you know, it was beautiful,

3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:24.080
 not just despite all that, but because of that,

3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:27.080
 because ultimately there's going to be nothing

3:27:27.080 --> 3:27:28.080
 and because we came from nothing

3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:30.080
 and we dealt with all this shit,

3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:32.080
 the fact that there was still beauty and truth

3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:35.080
 and connection, like, that, you know,

3:27:35.080 --> 3:27:38.080
 like it just, it's a beautiful thing.

3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:40.080
 But I hope I'm in that.

3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:42.080
 It's easy to say that now.

3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:44.080
 Like, yeah.

3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:47.080
 Do you think there's a meaning to this thing

3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:55.080
 we got going on, life, existence on earth to us individuals

3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:58.080
 from a psychedelics researcher perspective

3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:00.080
 or from just a human perspective?

3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:04.080
 Those merged together for me, like, because it's just hard.

3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:07.080
 I've been doing this research for almost 17 years

3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:09.080
 and like, not just the cancer study,

3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:12.080
 but so many times people like,

3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:15.080
 I remember a session in one of our studies,

3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:18.080
 someone who wasn't getting any treatment for anything,

3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:19.080
 but one of our healthy normal studies

3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:23.080
 where he was contemplating the suicide of his son

3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:25.080
 and just these, I mean,

3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:28.080
 just like the most intense human experiences

3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:32.080
 that you can have in the most vulnerable situations.

3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:35.080
 Sometimes like people like, you know,

3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:38.080
 and it's just like, you have to have a,

3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:40.080
 and you just feel lucky to be part of that process

3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:46.080
 that people trust you to let their guards down like that.

3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:47.080
 Like, I don't know, the meaning,

3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:52.080
 I think the meaning of life is to find meaning.

3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:55.080
 And I think, actually, I think I just described it a minute ago.

3:28:55.080 --> 3:28:57.080
 It's like that transcendence of everything.

3:28:57.080 --> 3:29:02.080
 Like, it's the beauty despite the absolute ugliness.

3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:07.080
 It's the, and as a species, and I think more about this,

3:29:07.080 --> 3:29:08.080
 like, I think about this a lot.

3:29:08.080 --> 3:29:15.080
 It's the fact that we are, I mean, we come from filth.

3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:18.080
 I mean, we're, you know, we're animals.

3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:21.080
 We come from, like, we're all descendant

3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:23.080
 from murderers and rapists.

3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:27.080
 Like, we, despite that background,

3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:33.080
 we are capable of the self sacrifice and the connection

3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:37.080
 and figuring things out, you know, science

3:29:37.080 --> 3:29:40.080
 and other forms of truth, you know, seeking,

3:29:40.080 --> 3:29:44.080
 and an artwork, just the beauty of music

3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:45.080
 and other forms of art.

3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:48.080
 It's like the fact that that's possible

3:29:48.080 --> 3:29:51.080
 is the meaning of life.

3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:52.080
 I mean...

3:29:52.080 --> 3:29:54.080
 And ultimately, that feels to be creating

3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:57.080
 more and richer experiences.

3:29:57.080 --> 3:30:03.080
 The, from a Russian perspective, both the dark,

3:30:03.080 --> 3:30:05.080
 you mentioned the cancer diagnosis

3:30:05.080 --> 3:30:11.080
 or losing a child to suicide or all those dark things

3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:14.080
 is still rich experiences.

3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:17.080
 And also the beautiful creations, the art,

3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:20.080
 the music, the science, that's also rich experience.

3:30:20.080 --> 3:30:24.080
 So somehow we're figuring out from just like psychedelics

3:30:24.080 --> 3:30:26.080
 expand our mind to the possibility of experiences.

3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:29.080
 Somehow we're able to figure out different ways

3:30:29.080 --> 3:30:33.080
 as a society to expand the realm of experiences.

3:30:33.080 --> 3:30:35.080
 And from that we gain meaning somehow.

3:30:35.080 --> 3:30:36.080
 Right. And that's part of like this,

3:30:36.080 --> 3:30:38.080
 we're going across different levels here,

3:30:38.080 --> 3:30:40.080
 but like the idea that so called bad trips

3:30:40.080 --> 3:30:42.080
 or challenging experiences are so common

3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:44.080
 in psychedelic experiences, it's like,

3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:46.080
 that's a part of that.

3:30:46.080 --> 3:30:47.080
 Like, yeah, it's tough.

3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:49.080
 And most of the important things in life

3:30:49.080 --> 3:30:51.080
 are really, really tough and scary.

3:30:51.080 --> 3:30:54.080
 And most of the things like the death of a loved one,

3:30:54.080 --> 3:30:57.080
 like the greatest learning experiences

3:30:57.080 --> 3:31:01.080
 and things that make you who you are are the horrors.

3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:03.080
 And it's like, yeah, we try to minimize them.

3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:06.080
 We try to avoid them, but I don't know.

3:31:06.080 --> 3:31:08.080
 I think we all need to get into the mode

3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:09.080
 of like giving ourselves a break,

3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:12.080
 both personally and societally.

3:31:12.080 --> 3:31:14.080
 I mean, I went through like the,

3:31:14.080 --> 3:31:16.080
 I think a lot of people do these days in my twenties,

3:31:16.080 --> 3:31:20.080
 like, oh, the humans are just kind of a disease

3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:22.080
 on the planet.

3:31:22.080 --> 3:31:23.080
 And then in terms of our country,

3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:25.080
 in terms of the United States, it's like,

3:31:25.080 --> 3:31:28.080
 oh, we have all these horrible sins in our past.

3:31:28.080 --> 3:31:30.080
 And it's like, I think about that like the,

3:31:32.080 --> 3:31:34.080
 I think about it like my three year old.

3:31:34.080 --> 3:31:36.080
 It's like, yeah, you can construct a story

3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:38.080
 where this is all just horrible.

3:31:38.080 --> 3:31:40.080
 You can look at that stuff and say,

3:31:40.080 --> 3:31:42.080
 this is all just horror.

3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:47.080
 Like there's no logical answer to our rational answer

3:31:47.080 --> 3:31:48.080
 to say we're not a disease on the planet.

3:31:48.080 --> 3:31:50.080
 From one lens we are.

3:31:50.080 --> 3:31:57.080
 And you could just look at humanity as that,

3:31:57.080 --> 3:31:58.080
 like nothing but this horrible thing.

3:31:58.080 --> 3:32:01.080
 You can look at, and you name the system,

3:32:01.080 --> 3:32:04.080
 modern medicine, Western medicine,

3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:05.080
 the university system.

3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:07.080
 And it's like, you could dismiss everything.

3:32:07.080 --> 3:32:10.080
 So, big pharma, like hopefully these vaccines work.

3:32:10.080 --> 3:32:12.080
 And then like, yeah, I'd like to,

3:32:12.080 --> 3:32:15.080
 I'm kind of glad the big pharma was a part of that.

3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:17.080
 And it's like the United States,

3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:20.080
 you can like point to the horrors,

3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:22.080
 like any other country that's been around a long time

3:32:22.080 --> 3:32:24.080
 that has these legitimate horrors

3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.080
 and kind of dismiss like these beautiful things.

3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:31.080
 Like, yeah, we have this like modifiable constitutional republic

3:32:31.080 --> 3:32:35.080
 that just like I still think is the best thing going.

3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:40.080
 That as a model system of like how humans have to figure out

3:32:40.080 --> 3:32:41.080
 how to work together.

3:32:41.080 --> 3:32:46.080
 It's like, there's no better system that I've come across.

3:32:46.080 --> 3:32:50.080
 Yeah, there's, if we're willing to look for it,

3:32:50.080 --> 3:32:53.080
 there's a beautiful core to a lot of things we've created.

3:32:53.080 --> 3:32:57.080
 Yeah, this country is a great example of that.

3:32:57.080 --> 3:33:00.080
 But most of the human experience has a beauty to it,

3:33:00.080 --> 3:33:01.080
 even the suffering.

3:33:01.080 --> 3:33:02.080
 Right.

3:33:02.080 --> 3:33:06.080
 So, the meaning is choosing to focus on that positivity

3:33:06.080 --> 3:33:07.080
 and not forget it.

3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:08.080
 Beautifully put.

3:33:08.080 --> 3:33:09.080
 Speaking of experiences,

3:33:09.080 --> 3:33:13.080
 this was one of my favorite experiences on this podcast

3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:15.080
 talking to you today, Matthew.

3:33:15.080 --> 3:33:17.080
 I hope we get a chance to talk again.

3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:19.080
 I hope to see you and Joe Rogan.

3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:21.080
 It's a huge honor to talk to you.

3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:23.080
 Can't wait to read your papers.

3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:24.080
 Thanks for talking today.

3:33:24.080 --> 3:33:26.080
 Likewise, I very much enjoyed it.

3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:27.080

3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:38.080
 but has more privacy preserving features.

3:33:38.080 --> 3:33:41.080

 And now let me leave you with some words from Terrence McKenna.

3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:12.080
 Nature loves courage.

3:34:12.080 --> 3:34:15.080
 You make the commitment and nature will respond

3:34:15.080 --> 3:34:18.080
 to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.

3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:20.080
 Dream the impossible dream

3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:23.080
 and the world will not grind you under.

3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:24.080
 It will lift you up.

3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:26.080
 This is the trick.

3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:28.080
 This is what all these teachers and philosophers

3:34:28.080 --> 3:34:32.080
 who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold.

3:34:32.080 --> 3:34:34.080
 This is what they understood.

3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:37.080
 This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.

3:34:37.080 --> 3:34:39.080
 This is how magic is done

3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:42.080
 by hurling yourself into the abyss

3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:45.080
 and discovering it's a feather bed.

3:34:45.080 --> 3:35:10.080
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
