00:00.000 --> 00:03.660
 Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.740
 What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.920
 The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,

00:14.920 --> 00:17.920
 professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,

00:17.920 --> 00:21.200
 focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,

00:21.200 --> 00:23.920
 visual perception, and consciousness.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.760
 He's the author of over 120 scientific papers

00:27.760 --> 00:30.320
 on these topics and his most recent book

00:30.320 --> 00:33.280
 titled The Case Against Reality,

00:33.280 --> 00:35.840
 Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.600
 I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,

00:39.600 --> 00:41.400
 like those of Donald Hoffman's,

00:41.400 --> 00:43.640
 attempt to shake the foundation

00:43.640 --> 00:45.920
 of our understanding of reality,

00:45.920 --> 00:50.320
 and thus they take a long time to internalize deeply.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.240
 So proceed with caution.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.440
 Questioning the fabric of reality

00:54.440 --> 00:58.520
 can lead you to either madness or to truth.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.400
 And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.260
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.420
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:06.420 --> 01:07.640
 in the description.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.100
 And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.300
 In your book, The Case Against Reality,

01:14.300 --> 01:17.200
 Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,

01:17.200 --> 01:20.000
 you make the bold claim that the world we see

01:20.000 --> 01:21.960
 with our eyes is not real.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.560
 It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.800
 It is completely detached from objective reality.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.880
 Can you explain this idea?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.400
 Right, so this is a theorem

01:32.400 --> 01:34.160
 from evolution by natural selection.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.540
 So the technical question that I and my team asked was,

01:38.540 --> 01:41.380
 what is the probability that natural selection

01:41.380 --> 01:43.000
 would shape sensory systems

01:43.000 --> 01:45.400
 to see true properties of objective reality?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.440
 And to our surprise,

01:47.440 --> 01:49.320
 we found that the answer is precisely zero,

01:49.320 --> 01:51.400
 except for one kind of structure

01:51.400 --> 01:52.480
 that we can go into if you want to.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.640
 But for any generic structure

01:54.640 --> 01:56.240
 that you might think the world might have,

01:56.240 --> 01:59.160
 a total order, a topology, metric,

02:00.280 --> 02:02.300
 the probability is precisely zero

02:02.300 --> 02:05.300
 that natural selection would shape any sensory system

02:05.300 --> 02:08.560
 of any organism to see any aspect of objective reality.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.680
 So in that sense, what we're seeing

02:11.680 --> 02:15.680
 is what we need to see

02:16.600 --> 02:18.960
 to stay alive long enough to reproduce.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.640
 So in other words, we're seeing what we need

02:20.640 --> 02:23.480
 to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.080
 So the evolutionary process,

02:26.080 --> 02:30.100
 the process that took us from the origin of life on Earth

02:30.100 --> 02:32.320
 to the humans that we are today,

02:33.260 --> 02:37.320
 that process does not maximize for truth,

02:37.320 --> 02:41.280
 it maximizes for fitness, as you say, fitness beats truth.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.000
 And fitness does not have to be connected to truth,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.680
 is the claim.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.000
 And that's where you have an approach

02:49.000 --> 02:51.320
 towards zero of probability

02:51.320 --> 02:55.940
 that we have evolved human cognition,

02:55.940 --> 02:58.340
 human consciousness, whatever it is,

02:58.340 --> 03:00.640
 the magic that makes our mind work,

03:00.640 --> 03:05.640
 evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,

03:06.240 --> 03:09.160
 but its ability to survive in the environment.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.240
 That's exactly right.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.200
 So most of us intuitively think that surely

03:14.200 --> 03:18.600
 the way that evolution will make our senses more fit

03:18.600 --> 03:21.120
 is to make them tell us more truths,

03:21.120 --> 03:22.960
 or at least the truths we need to know

03:22.960 --> 03:26.100
 about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.960
 That's the standard view, and it was the view I took.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.520
 I mean, that's sort of what we're taught

03:30.520 --> 03:31.840
 or just even assume.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.460
 It was just sort of like the intelligent assumption

03:33.460 --> 03:34.720
 that we would all make.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.860
 But we don't have to just wave our hands.

03:37.860 --> 03:38.940
 Evolution of a natural selection

03:38.940 --> 03:41.220
 is a mathematically precise theory.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.200
 John Maynard Smith in the 70s

03:44.200 --> 03:45.600
 created evolutionary game theory.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.140
 And we have evolutionary graph theory

03:48.140 --> 03:50.520
 and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.360
 And so we don't have to wave our hands.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.480
 It's a matter of theorem and proof and or simulation

03:55.480 --> 03:56.740
 before you get the theorems and proofs.

03:56.740 --> 03:59.440
 And a couple of graduate students of mine,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.180
 Chester Mark and Brian Marion,

04:01.180 --> 04:03.960
 did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off

04:03.960 --> 04:06.480
 that there was something going on here.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.960
 And then I went to a mathematician, Chetan Prakash,

04:08.960 --> 04:13.040
 and Manish Singh, and some other friends of mine,

04:13.040 --> 04:14.440
 Chris Fields.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.000
 But Chetan was the real mathematician behind all this.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.560
 And he's proved several theorems

04:18.560 --> 04:21.800
 that uniformly indicate that with one exception,

04:21.800 --> 04:23.900
 which has to do with probability measures,

04:25.160 --> 04:28.240
 there's no, the probability is zero.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.920
 The reason there's an exception for probability measures,

04:30.920 --> 04:35.920
 so called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes,

04:36.680 --> 04:38.780
 is that for any scientific theory,

04:40.680 --> 04:43.400
 there is the assumption that needs to be made

04:43.400 --> 04:48.400
 that whatever structure,

04:48.640 --> 04:51.760
 whatever probabilistic structure the world may have

04:51.760 --> 04:55.520
 is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure

04:55.520 --> 04:56.360
 of our perceptions.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.360
 If they were completely unrelated,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.560
 then no science would be possible.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.560
 So this is technically the map from reality to our senses

05:05.080 --> 05:07.000
 has to be a so called measurable map,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.640
 has to preserve sigma algebras.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.360
 But that means it could be infinite to one,

05:10.360 --> 05:14.320
 and it could collapse all sorts of event information.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.040
 But other than that, there's no requirement

05:17.040 --> 05:18.960
 in standard evolutionary theory

05:18.960 --> 05:22.460
 for fitness payoff functions, for example,

05:22.460 --> 05:25.560
 to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.120
 So you can ask the technical question.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.180
 This is one of the avenues we took.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.920
 If you look at all the fitness payoffs

05:32.920 --> 05:37.960
 from whatever world structure you might want to imagine.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.460
 So a world with say a total order on it.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.100
 So it's got end states and they're totally ordered.

05:44.100 --> 05:48.160
 And then you can have a set of maps from that world

05:48.160 --> 05:50.560
 into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand

05:50.560 --> 05:52.560
 or whatever you want your payoffs to be.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.240
 And you can just literally count all the payoff functions

05:56.240 --> 05:58.120
 and just do the combinatorics and count them.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.840
 And then you can ask the precise question,

05:59.840 --> 06:04.000
 how many of those payoff functions preserve the total order?

06:04.000 --> 06:04.840
 If that's what you're looking for,

06:04.840 --> 06:07.320
 or how many preserve the topology?

06:07.320 --> 06:08.800
 And you just count them and divide.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.880
 So the number that are homomorphisms

06:11.880 --> 06:14.160
 versus the total number, and then take the limit

06:14.160 --> 06:16.660
 as the number of states in the world

06:16.660 --> 06:19.960
 and the number of payoff values goes very large.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.600
 And when you do that, you get zero every time.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.400
 Okay, there's a million things to ask here.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.240
 But first of all, just in case people

06:28.240 --> 06:29.920
 are not familiar with your work,

06:30.880 --> 06:35.880
 let's sort of linger on the big bold statement here,

06:35.880 --> 06:39.400
 which is the thing we see with our eyes

06:41.040 --> 06:45.040
 is not some kind of limited window into reality.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.860
 It is completely detached from reality,

06:47.860 --> 06:49.600
 likely completely detached from reality.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.240
 You're saying 100% likely.

06:52.580 --> 06:57.580
 Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.

06:57.780 --> 07:00.000
 In the way we have this intuition,

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
 there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.880
 but underneath it all, there's atoms.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.880
 And there's an entire century of physics

07:09.880 --> 07:12.040
 that describes the functioning of those atoms

07:12.040 --> 07:13.720
 and the quirks that make them up.

07:13.720 --> 07:18.720
 There's many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields

07:19.840 --> 07:23.320
 and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up

07:23.320 --> 07:25.200
 to something that's perceivable to us,

07:25.200 --> 07:29.960
 both with our eyes, with our different senses as this table.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.560
 Then there's also ideas of chemistry

07:33.560 --> 07:38.560
 that over layers of abstraction, from DNA to embryos,

07:38.600 --> 07:42.960
 the cells that make the human body.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.660
 So all of that is not real.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.320
 It's a real experience,

07:48.320 --> 07:52.560
 and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.200
 So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.640
 We want to think that the perceptions are real.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.720
 So their perceptions are real as perceptions, right?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.640
 We are having our perceptions,

08:03.640 --> 08:06.920
 but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship

08:06.920 --> 08:09.000
 between our perceptions and reality.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.720
 If I look up and see the moon,

08:11.720 --> 08:15.160
 then there is something that exists in space and time

08:15.160 --> 08:18.960
 that matches what I perceive.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.960
 And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution

08:24.600 --> 08:29.600
 by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.880
 That our perceptions are there.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.160
 They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.720
 They're not there to show you the truth.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.760
 In fact, the way I think about it is

08:38.760 --> 08:40.660
 they're there to hide the truth

08:40.660 --> 08:42.520
 because the truth is too complicated.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.720
 It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop

08:45.720 --> 08:47.480
 to write an email, right?

08:47.480 --> 08:50.280
 What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,

08:50.280 --> 08:52.600
 but good luck trying to do it that way.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.280
 The reason why we have a user interface

08:54.280 --> 08:56.600
 is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
 the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.040
 If you had to know all that truth,

09:02.040 --> 09:04.000
 your friends wouldn't hear from you.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.360
 So what evolution gave us was perceptions

09:08.360 --> 09:10.200
 that guide adaptive behavior.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.000
 And part of that process, it turns out,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.680
 means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.700
 So what's the difference between hiding the truth

09:20.700 --> 09:22.840
 and forming abstractions,

09:22.840 --> 09:26.560
 layers upon layers of abstractions

09:26.560 --> 09:30.320
 over low level voltages and transistors

09:30.320 --> 09:35.320
 and chips and programming languages

09:35.480 --> 09:38.560
 from assembly to Python that then leads you

09:38.560 --> 09:41.040
 to be able to have an interface like Chrome

09:41.040 --> 09:45.780
 where you open up another set of JavaScript and HTML

09:45.780 --> 09:47.360
 programming languages that lead you

09:47.360 --> 09:49.360
 to have a graphical user interface

09:49.360 --> 09:53.040
 and which you can then send your friends an email.

09:53.040 --> 09:58.040
 Is that completely detached from the zeros and ones

09:58.480 --> 10:01.560
 that are firing away inside the computer?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.880
 It's not.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.800
 Of course, when I talk about the user interface

10:04.800 --> 10:09.800
 on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated

10:10.120 --> 10:11.540
 backstory to it, right?

10:11.540 --> 10:13.120
 That the hardware and the software

10:13.120 --> 10:15.040
 that's allowing that to happen.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.200
 Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
 So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate

10:20.400 --> 10:23.040
 to tell you what is that backstory.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.160
 It's gonna say that whatever reality is,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.000
 and that's the interesting thing,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.260
 it says whatever reality is, you don't see it.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.600
 You see a user interface,

10:32.600 --> 10:36.900
 but it doesn't tell you what that user interface is,

10:36.900 --> 10:38.840
 how it's built, right?

10:38.840 --> 10:42.600
 Now, we can try to look at certain aspects

10:42.600 --> 10:45.400
 of the interface, but already we're gonna look at that

10:45.400 --> 10:47.960
 and go, okay, before I would look at neurons

10:47.960 --> 10:49.640
 and I was assuming that I was seeing something

10:49.640 --> 10:52.840
 that was at least partially true.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.880
 And now I'm realizing that it could be like looking

10:54.880 --> 10:59.240
 at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop

10:59.240 --> 11:02.600
 and good luck going from that to the data structures

11:02.600 --> 11:04.840
 and then the voltages and I mean, good luck.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.960
 There's just no way.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.600
 So what's interesting about this is that

11:08.600 --> 11:13.000
 our scientific theories are precise enough

11:13.000 --> 11:15.640
 and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,

11:17.160 --> 11:20.040
 but, and even limits of the theories themselves,

11:20.040 --> 11:23.240
 but they're not going to tell us what the next move is

11:23.240 --> 11:25.880
 and that's where scientific creativity comes in.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.960
 So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,

11:28.960 --> 11:31.040
 is not alien to physicists.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.680
 The physicists are saying precisely the same thing

11:33.680 --> 11:35.240
 that space time is doomed.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.240
 We've assumed that space time is fundamental.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.360
 We've assumed that for several centuries

11:39.360 --> 11:40.760
 and it's been very useful.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.980
 So all the things that you were mentioning,

11:41.980 --> 11:43.920
 the particles and all the work that's been done,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.120
 that's all been done in space time,

11:45.120 --> 11:47.520
 but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.720
 There's no such thing as space time fundamentally

11:51.720 --> 11:54.080
 in the laws of physics.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.580
 And that comes actually out of gravity

11:58.580 --> 11:59.920
 together with quantum field theory,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.080
 which just comes right out of it.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.640
 It's a theorem of those two theories put together,

12:05.640 --> 12:08.000
 but it doesn't tell you what's behind it.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.880
 So the physicists know that their best theories,

12:11.880 --> 12:15.160
 Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together

12:15.160 --> 12:17.440
 entail that space time cannot be fundamental

12:17.440 --> 12:20.880
 and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.520
 They're just irreducible representations

12:22.520 --> 12:23.760
 of the symmetries of space time.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.760
 That's what they are.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.600
 So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.700
 We put together what the physicists are discovering

12:29.700 --> 12:32.200
 and we can talk about how they do that.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.780
 And then we, the new discoveries

12:33.780 --> 12:35.360
 from evolution of a natural selection.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.740
 Both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.

12:38.740 --> 12:41.520
 And what both are saying is space time

12:41.520 --> 12:42.520
 has had a good ride.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.360
 It's been very useful.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.520
 Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.400
 And it's time for us to go beyond.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.520
 When you say space time is doomed,

12:50.520 --> 12:53.200
 is it the space, is it the time,

12:53.200 --> 12:57.640
 is it the very hard coded specification of four dimensions?

12:59.800 --> 13:01.560
 Or are you specifically referring

13:01.560 --> 13:05.160
 to the kind of perceptual domain

13:05.160 --> 13:07.360
 that humans operate in, which is space time?

13:07.360 --> 13:12.080
 You think like there's a 3D, like our world

13:12.080 --> 13:15.440
 is three dimensional and time progresses forward.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.120
 Therefore, three dimensions plus one, 4D.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.560
 What exactly do you mean by space time?

13:20.560 --> 13:24.080
 And what do you mean by space time is doomed?

13:24.080 --> 13:24.920
 Great, great.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.600
 So this is, by the way, not my quote.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.880
 This is from, for example, Nima Arkanihaim Ed

13:29.880 --> 13:31.760
 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.340
 Ed Witten, also there.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.560
 David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.360
 So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,

13:39.360 --> 13:40.680
 this is what the physicists are saying.

13:40.680 --> 13:45.120
 Yeah, the physicists, they're space time skeptics.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.680
 Well, yeah, they're saying that,

13:46.680 --> 13:49.600
 and I can say exactly why they think it's doomed.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.640
 But what they're saying is that,

13:51.640 --> 13:53.880
 because your question was what aspect of space time,

13:53.880 --> 13:55.000
 what are we talking about here?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.920
 It's both space and time.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.760
 They're union into space time as an Einstein's theory.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.280
 That's doomed.

14:01.280 --> 14:06.280
 And they're basically saying that even quantum theory,

14:06.960 --> 14:09.240
 this is with Nima Arkanihaim Ed, especially.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.920
 So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.560
 So that the notion of Hilbert space,

14:15.560 --> 14:19.000
 which is really critical to quantum field theory,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
 quantum information theory,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
 that's not going to figure

14:22.000 --> 14:25.280
 in the fundamental new laws of physics.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.840
 So what they're looking for

14:26.840 --> 14:31.840
 is some new mathematical structures beyond space time,

14:31.960 --> 14:35.240
 beyond Einstein's four dimensional space time

14:35.240 --> 14:38.040
 or super symmetric version,

14:38.040 --> 14:41.160
 geometric algebra signature two comma four kind of.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.280
 There are different ways that you can represent it,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.560
 but they're finding new structures.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.320
 And then by the way, they're succeeding now.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.440
 They're finding, they found something

14:48.440 --> 14:49.680
 called the amplituhedron.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.520
 This is Nima and his colleagues,

14:51.520 --> 14:53.600
 the cosmological polytope.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.400
 So there are these like polytopes,

14:57.400 --> 15:00.320
 these polyhedra in multi dimensions,

15:00.320 --> 15:05.320
 generalizations of simplices that are coding for,

15:05.720 --> 15:08.240
 for example, the scattering amplitudes of processes

15:08.240 --> 15:10.880
 in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.040
 So they're finding that if they let go of space time,

15:14.040 --> 15:16.960
 completely, they're finding new ways

15:16.960 --> 15:18.760
 of computing these scattering amplitudes

15:18.760 --> 15:23.760
 that turn literally billions of terms into one term.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.040
 When you do it in space and time,

15:25.040 --> 15:26.800
 because it's the wrong framework,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.560
 it's just a user interface from,

15:29.560 --> 15:30.920
 that's not from the evolutionary point of view,

15:30.920 --> 15:32.160
 it's just user interface.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.600
 It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.920
 So it's missing deep symmetry

15:36.920 --> 15:39.040
 is something called a dual conformal symmetry,

15:39.040 --> 15:40.960
 which turns out to be true of the scattering data,

15:40.960 --> 15:42.720
 but you can't see it in space time.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.280
 And it's making the computations way too complicated

15:46.280 --> 15:47.920
 because you're trying to compute all the loops

15:47.920 --> 15:50.320
 in the Feynman diagrams and all the Feynman integrals.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.000
 So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes

15:53.000 --> 15:56.520
 is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,

15:56.520 --> 15:58.600
 locality and unitarity.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.440
 And so by, when you enforce those,

16:00.440 --> 16:03.400
 you get all these loops and multiple,

16:03.400 --> 16:04.600
 different levels of loops.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.440
 And for each of those,

16:05.440 --> 16:07.600
 you have to add new terms to your computation.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.080
 But when you do it outside of space time,

16:11.080 --> 16:13.800
 you don't have the notion of unitarity.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.760
 You don't have the notion of locality.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.320
 You have something deeper

16:17.320 --> 16:18.840
 and it's capturing some symmetries

16:18.840 --> 16:20.800
 that are actually true of the data.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.000
 And, but then when you look at the geometry

16:23.000 --> 16:25.360
 of the facets of these polytopes,

16:25.360 --> 16:30.360
 then certain of them will code for unitarity and locality.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.400
 So it actually comes out of the structure

16:32.400 --> 16:33.520
 of these deep polytopes.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.520
 So what we're finding is there's this whole new world.

16:36.520 --> 16:41.520
 Now beyond space time that is making explicit symmetries

16:42.080 --> 16:43.000
 that are true of the data

16:43.000 --> 16:45.040
 that cannot be seen in space time.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.720
 And that is turning the computations

16:46.720 --> 16:50.400
 from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.280
 So we're getting insights into symmetries

16:53.280 --> 16:55.400
 and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple

16:55.400 --> 16:56.880
 because we're not doing something silly.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.040
 We're not adding up all these loops in space time.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.840
 We're doing something far deeper.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.840
 But they don't know what this world is about.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.880
 Also, they're in an interesting position

17:07.080 --> 17:09.080
 where we know that space time is doomed.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.360
 And I should probably tell you why it's doomed,

17:11.360 --> 17:12.840
 what they're saying about why it's doomed.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.600
 But they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.400
 What flashlight are we gonna use

17:17.400 --> 17:19.720
 to look into the dark beyond space time?

17:19.720 --> 17:22.280
 Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory

17:22.280 --> 17:23.920
 can't tell us what's beyond them.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.240
 All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,

17:26.240 --> 17:30.080
 space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,

17:30.080 --> 17:31.600
 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.000
 Beyond that, space time doesn't even make sense.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.080
 It just has no operational definition.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
 So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.560
 And so they're just looking for deep structures

17:41.560 --> 17:43.680
 like guessing is really fun.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.160
 So these really brilliant guys, generic brilliant men

17:47.160 --> 17:49.760
 and women who are doing this work, physicists,

17:49.760 --> 17:52.280
 are making guesses about these structures,

17:52.280 --> 17:54.120
 informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.560
 well, okay, what deeper structure could give us

17:56.560 --> 17:58.360
 the stuff that we're seeing in space time,

17:58.360 --> 17:59.960
 but without certain commitments

17:59.960 --> 18:02.840
 that we have to make in space time, like locality.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.680
 So they make these brilliant guesses.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.640
 And of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong,

18:06.640 --> 18:09.560
 but once you get one or two that start to pay off

18:09.560 --> 18:11.320
 and then you get some lucky breaks.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.080
 So they got a lucky break back in 1986.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.720
 Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor

18:18.680 --> 18:22.640
 took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in

18:22.640 --> 18:25.560
 at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.200
 So that kind of scattering thing.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.280
 So it's like apparently for people who are into this,

18:30.280 --> 18:32.040
 that's sort of something that happens so often

18:32.040 --> 18:34.320
 you need to be able to find it and get rid of those

18:34.320 --> 18:36.160
 cause you already know about that and you need to.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.280
 So you needed to compute them.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.880
 It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it

18:39.880 --> 18:41.960
 even though for the supercomputers couldn't do that

18:41.960 --> 18:44.560
 for the many billions or millions of times per second

18:44.560 --> 18:45.400
 they needed to do it.

18:45.400 --> 18:49.040
 So the experimentals begged the theorists,

18:49.040 --> 18:51.280
 please, you got it.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.160
 And so Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,

18:53.160 --> 18:58.120
 hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.360
 And then a little bit later,

18:59.360 --> 19:01.240
 they guessed one term expression

19:01.240 --> 19:02.480
 that turned out to be equivalent.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.240
 So billions of terms reduced to one term,

19:07.240 --> 19:10.720
 that so called famous Park Taylor formula, 1986.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.240
 And that was like, okay, where did that come from?

19:14.240 --> 19:18.840
 This is a pointer into a deep realm, beyond space and time,

19:18.840 --> 19:21.480
 but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?

19:21.480 --> 19:23.120
 And they thought maybe it was a one off,

19:23.120 --> 19:25.840
 but then other formulas started coming up.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.440
 And then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamid and his team

19:28.440 --> 19:30.200
 found this thing called the amplituhedron,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.640
 which really sort of captures the whole,

19:32.640 --> 19:34.600
 a big part of the whole ball of wax.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.800
 I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.440
 So I won't say they did it all by any means.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.640
 They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.

19:42.640 --> 19:47.640
 So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars

19:48.040 --> 19:51.640
 of modern science, quantum field theory with gravity

19:51.640 --> 19:54.240
 on the one hand and evolution by natural selection

19:54.240 --> 19:56.840
 on the other, just in the last 20 years

19:56.840 --> 20:01.080
 have very clearly said space time has had a good run.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.800
 Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.680
 So we had a great ontology of space time,

20:05.680 --> 20:07.920
 a great methodology of reductionism.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.440
 Now it's time for a new trick.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.000
 But now you need to go deeper and show,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.920
 but by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away

20:14.920 --> 20:17.160
 everything we've done, not by a long shot.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.720
 Every new idea that we come up with beyond space time

20:20.720 --> 20:23.280
 must project precisely into space time.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.320
 And it better give us back everything that we know

20:25.320 --> 20:28.680
 and love in space time or generalizations,

20:28.680 --> 20:30.800
 or it's not gonna be taken seriously and it shouldn't be.

20:30.800 --> 20:34.640
 So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going to do

20:34.640 --> 20:37.600
 beyond space time, it needs to project into space time.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.360
 And whatever this deeper theory is,

20:39.360 --> 20:42.800
 it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.440
 This may not be part of this deeper realm.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.480
 But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space time

20:47.480 --> 20:49.160
 and project it into space time,

20:49.160 --> 20:51.720
 it has to look like evolution by natural selection

20:51.720 --> 20:52.920
 or it's wrong.

20:52.920 --> 20:57.400
 So that's a strong constraint on this work.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.880
 So even the evolution by natural selection

21:00.880 --> 21:05.880
 and quantum field theory could be interfaces

21:06.440 --> 21:11.440
 into something that doesn't look anything like,

21:11.760 --> 21:12.600
 like you mentioned.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.520
 I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution

21:14.520 --> 21:16.880
 might be a very crappy interface

21:16.880 --> 21:18.360
 into something much deeper.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.200
 That's right.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.880
 They're both telling us that the framework that you've had

21:21.880 --> 21:24.160
 can only go so far and it has to stop.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.600
 And there's something beyond.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.160
 And the very framework that is space and time itself.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.360
 Now, of course, evolution by natural selection

21:32.360 --> 21:35.960
 is not telling us about like Einstein's relativistic

21:35.960 --> 21:36.800
 space time.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.280
 So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.360
 It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,

21:42.360 --> 21:46.160
 which we have used as the basis for creating

21:46.160 --> 21:49.680
 first Newtonian space versus time

21:49.680 --> 21:53.280
 as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.680
 And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.120
 So the relationship between what evolution is telling us

21:59.120 --> 22:01.040
 and what the physicists are telling us is that

22:01.040 --> 22:05.880
 in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time

22:07.160 --> 22:11.320
 are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions

22:11.320 --> 22:12.760
 of our perceptual space,

22:14.040 --> 22:15.520
 making it mathematically rigorous

22:15.520 --> 22:19.080
 and laying out the symmetries that they find there.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.760
 So that's sort of the relationship between them.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.440
 So it's the perceptual space time

22:22.440 --> 22:24.040
 that evolution is telling us

22:24.040 --> 22:27.760
 is just a user interface effectively.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.960
 And then the physicists are finding

22:28.960 --> 22:31.440
 that even the mathematical extension of that

22:31.440 --> 22:36.160
 into the Einsteinian formulation has to be as well,

22:36.160 --> 22:38.120
 not the final story, there's something deeper.

22:38.120 --> 22:43.120
 So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces

22:43.200 --> 22:45.880
 as we march forward from Newtonian physics

22:47.960 --> 22:49.920
 to quantum mechanics.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.800
 These are all, in your view, interfaces.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.240
 Are we getting closer to objective reality?

22:59.240 --> 23:04.240
 How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science,

23:04.840 --> 23:06.880
 the reason we like those interfaces

23:06.880 --> 23:09.720
 is because they're predictive of some aspects,

23:09.720 --> 23:13.160
 strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.040
 Is that completely deviating

23:16.040 --> 23:19.560
 from our understanding of that reality

23:19.560 --> 23:22.760
 or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?

23:22.760 --> 23:24.560
 Well, of course, one critical constraint

23:24.560 --> 23:25.400
 on all of our theories

23:25.400 --> 23:27.240
 is that they are empirically tested

23:27.240 --> 23:30.800
 and pass the experiments that we have for them.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.440
 So no one's arguing against experiments being important

23:34.440 --> 23:38.440
 and wanting to test all of our current theories

23:38.440 --> 23:40.600
 and any new theories on that.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.280
 So that's all there.

23:44.280 --> 23:48.040
 But we have good reason to believe

23:48.040 --> 23:50.560
 that science will never get a theory of everything.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.760
 Everything, everything.

23:52.760 --> 23:53.720
 Everything, everything, right.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.640
 A final theory of everything, right.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.440
 I think that my own take is, for what it's worth,

23:58.440 --> 24:00.920
 is that Gödel's incompleteness theorem

24:00.920 --> 24:02.480
 sort of points us in that direction,

24:02.480 --> 24:04.080
 that even with mathematics,

24:05.240 --> 24:08.760
 any finite axiomatization that's sophisticated enough

24:08.760 --> 24:10.360
 to be able to do arithmetic,

24:10.360 --> 24:13.560
 it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true,

24:13.560 --> 24:16.280
 that can't be proven,

24:16.280 --> 24:19.480
 can't be deduced from within that framework.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.920
 And if you add the new statements to your axioms,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.280
 then there'll be always new statements that are true,

24:24.280 --> 24:26.920
 but can't be proven with a new axiom system.

24:26.920 --> 24:31.920
 And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,

24:32.640 --> 24:35.080
 and also now evolution, are mathematical.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.320
 So our theories are gonna be,

24:36.320 --> 24:38.400
 they're gonna have their own assumptions

24:38.400 --> 24:41.720
 and they'll be mathematically precise.

24:41.720 --> 24:42.800
 And there'll be theories, perhaps,

24:42.800 --> 24:44.440
 of everything except those assumptions,

24:44.440 --> 24:46.280
 because the assumptions are,

24:46.280 --> 24:48.280
 we say, please grant me these assumptions.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.440
 If you grant me these assumptions,

24:49.440 --> 24:52.000
 then I can explain this other stuff.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
 So you have the assumptions that are like miracles,

24:57.600 --> 24:58.640
 as far as the theory is concerned.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.480
 They're not explained.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.520
 They're the starting points for explanation.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.160
 And then you have the mathematical structure

25:03.160 --> 25:07.520
 of the theory itself, which will have the Gödel limits.

25:07.520 --> 25:12.520
 And so my take is that reality,

25:12.520 --> 25:16.600
 reality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend

25:18.240 --> 25:22.440
 any conceptual theory that we didn't come up with.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.800
 There's always gonna be mystery at the edges.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.640
 Right.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.400
 Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.240
 Okay.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.880
 And truths.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.840
 So there's this idea that is brought up

25:34.840 --> 25:39.440
 in the financial space of settlement of transactions.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.560
 It's often talked about in cryptocurrency, especially.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.600
 So you could do, you know, money, cash,

25:44.600 --> 25:48.640
 is not connected to anything.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.200
 It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.640
 but then you can use money to exchange,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.280
 to exchange value, to transact.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.760
 So when it was on the gold standard,

25:59.760 --> 26:04.760
 the money would represent some stable component of reality.

26:04.760 --> 26:09.760
 Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation

26:12.280 --> 26:14.160
 if we generalize that idea?

26:14.160 --> 26:19.120
 Isn't it better to connect your,

26:19.120 --> 26:20.520
 whatever we humans are doing

26:20.520 --> 26:23.040
 in the social interaction space with each other,

26:23.040 --> 26:26.000
 isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective

26:26.000 --> 26:28.040
 to connect it to some degree to reality

26:28.040 --> 26:31.620
 so that the transactions are settled

26:31.620 --> 26:33.740
 with something that's universal,

26:33.740 --> 26:35.880
 as opposed to us constantly operating

26:35.880 --> 26:38.080
 in something that's a complete illusion?

26:38.080 --> 26:40.480
 Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?

26:41.400 --> 26:45.240
 Like where you really deviate very, very far away

26:49.720 --> 26:51.000
 from the underlying reality,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.720
 or do you not never get in trouble for this?

26:53.720 --> 26:58.200
 Can you just completely drift far, far away

26:58.200 --> 27:01.560
 from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?

27:01.560 --> 27:04.440
 That's a great question, on the financial side,

27:04.440 --> 27:05.560
 there's two levels at least

27:05.560 --> 27:06.880
 that we could take your question.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.800
 One is strictly like evolutionary psychology

27:09.800 --> 27:13.480
 of financial systems, and that's pretty interesting.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.100
 And there the decentralized idea,

27:15.100 --> 27:18.520
 the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies

27:18.520 --> 27:19.920
 may make good sense

27:19.920 --> 27:22.400
 from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.720
 Having human nature being what it is,

27:25.720 --> 27:30.600
 putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers

27:30.600 --> 27:34.280
 depends a lot on the veracity of those

27:34.280 --> 27:37.080
 and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.440
 And we have ample evidence time and again

27:39.440 --> 27:41.880
 that that's often betrayed.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.920
 So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say,

27:44.920 --> 27:46.680
 to have a decentralized,

27:46.680 --> 27:49.600
 I mean, democracy is a step in that direction, right?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.240
 We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do,

27:52.240 --> 27:54.560
 we decentralize things, right?

27:54.560 --> 27:55.880
 Because if the monarch,

27:55.880 --> 27:58.600
 if you have Marcus Aurelius as your emperor, you're great.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.160
 If you have Nero, it's not so great.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.320
 And so we don't want that.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.280
 So democracy is a step in that direction,

28:04.280 --> 28:08.800
 but I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step

28:08.800 --> 28:13.120
 and is going to even make the democratization even greater.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.840
 So that's one level of it.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.480
 Also, the fact that power corrupts

28:16.480 --> 28:18.120
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely

28:18.120 --> 28:22.580
 is also a consequence of evolution.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.960
 That's also a feature, I think, right?

28:26.960 --> 28:30.880
 You can argue from the long span of living organisms,

28:30.880 --> 28:33.840
 it's nice for power to corrupt for you to,

28:33.840 --> 28:38.800
 so mad men and women throughout history

28:38.800 --> 28:43.040
 might be useful to teach us a lesson about ourselves.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.800
 We can learn from our negative example, right?

28:44.800 --> 28:45.640
 Exactly.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.040
 Right, right, right.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.120
 Power does corrupt and I think that you can think about that

28:51.120 --> 28:53.600
 again from an evolutionary point of view.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.800
 But I think that your question was a little deeper

28:55.800 --> 29:00.800
 when that was, does the evolutionary interface idea

29:01.480 --> 29:06.480
 sort of unhinge science from some kind of important test

29:07.920 --> 29:08.840
 for the theories, right?

29:08.840 --> 29:12.320
 We don't want, it doesn't mean that anything goes

29:12.320 --> 29:14.560
 in scientific theory, but there's no,

29:14.560 --> 29:15.880
 if we don't see the truth,

29:15.880 --> 29:18.640
 is there no way to tether our theories and test them?

29:18.640 --> 29:23.640
 And I think there's no problem there.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.800
 We can only test things in terms of what we can measure

29:27.800 --> 29:29.520
 with our senses in space and time.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.400
 So we're going to have to continue to do experiments

29:33.400 --> 29:35.040
 and, but we're going to re,

29:35.040 --> 29:36.840
 we're going to understand a little bit differently

29:36.840 --> 29:38.440
 what those experiments are.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.840
 We had thought that when we see a pointer

29:41.840 --> 29:45.720
 on some machine in an experiment,

29:45.720 --> 29:48.240
 that the machine exists, the pointer exists

29:48.240 --> 29:51.280
 and the values exist even when no one is looking at them

29:51.280 --> 29:52.760
 and that they're an objective truth.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.480
 And our best theories are telling us no,

29:55.480 --> 29:58.480
 the pointers are just pointers

29:58.480 --> 30:00.120
 and that's what you have to rely on

30:00.120 --> 30:02.880
 for making your judgments.

30:02.880 --> 30:07.640
 But even the pointers themselves

30:07.640 --> 30:10.480
 are not the objective reality.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.600
 So, and I think Gödel is telling us that,

30:13.600 --> 30:17.760
 not that anything goes, but as you develop

30:17.760 --> 30:19.760
 new axiom systems, you will find out what goes

30:19.760 --> 30:21.640
 within that axiom system

30:21.640 --> 30:23.720
 and what testable predictions you can make.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.800
 So I don't think we're untethered.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.000
 We continue to do experiments.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.160
 What I think we won't have that we want

30:31.160 --> 30:34.040
 is a conceptual understanding

30:34.040 --> 30:35.560
 that gives us a theory of everything

30:35.560 --> 30:37.560
 that's final and complete.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.280
 I think that this is, to put it another way,

30:40.280 --> 30:43.080
 this is job security for scientists.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.240
 Our job will never be done.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.760
 It's job security for neuroscience.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.760
 Because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,

30:50.760 --> 30:52.440
 we saw neurons and neural networks

30:52.440 --> 30:57.440
 and action potentials and synapses and so forth.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.320
 And that was it, that was the reality.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.760
 Now we have to reverse engineer that.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.760
 We have to say, what is beyond space time?

31:04.760 --> 31:05.760
 What is going on?

31:05.760 --> 31:08.400
 What is a dynamical system beyond space time?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.520
 That when we project it into Einstein's space time,

31:10.520 --> 31:12.360
 gives us things that look like neurons

31:12.360 --> 31:14.160
 and neural networks and synapses.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.520
 So we have to reverse engineer it.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.000
 So there's gonna be lots more work for neuroscience.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.840
 It's gonna be far more complicated

31:20.840 --> 31:23.840
 and difficult and challenging.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.000
 But that's wonderful, that's what we need to do.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.400
 We thought neurons exist when they are perceived

31:28.400 --> 31:29.320
 and they don't.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.040
 In the same way that if I show you,

31:31.040 --> 31:32.000
 when I say they don't exist,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.440
 I should be very, very concrete.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.240
 If I draw on a piece of paper,

31:36.240 --> 31:40.480
 a little sketch of something that is called the Necker cube,

31:40.480 --> 31:42.840
 it's just a little line drawing of a cube, right?

31:42.840 --> 31:44.000
 It's not a flat piece of paper.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.160
 If I execute it well, and I show it to you,

31:46.160 --> 31:48.360
 you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.760
 Sometimes you'll see one face in front,

31:49.760 --> 31:51.920
 sometimes you'll see the other face in front.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.360
 But if I ask you, which face is in front

31:54.360 --> 31:55.320
 when you don't look?

31:57.200 --> 31:59.600
 The answer is, well, neither face is in front

31:59.600 --> 32:01.320
 because there's no cube.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.200
 There's just a flat piece of paper.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.120
 So when you look at the piece of paper,

32:05.120 --> 32:08.440
 you perceptually create the cube.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.960
 And when you look at it,

32:09.960 --> 32:13.120
 then you fix one face to be in front and one face to be.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.000
 So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.120
 Space time itself is like the cube.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.960
 It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,

32:21.960 --> 32:23.720
 whatever your sensory systems mean now,

32:23.720 --> 32:27.320
 because we now have to not even take that for granted.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.400
 But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly

32:31.400 --> 32:34.000
 and they're data structures in a computer science sense,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.680
 and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.480
 So you create them and garbage collect them.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.880
 But is it possible that it's mapped well

32:40.880 --> 32:45.640
 in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality?

32:45.640 --> 32:48.640
 The sheet of paper, this two dimensional space,

32:48.640 --> 32:51.240
 or we can talk about space time,

32:51.240 --> 32:55.840
 maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand,

32:55.840 --> 32:59.620
 but we'll one day understand what that mapping is,

32:59.620 --> 33:00.920
 but it maps reliably.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.940
 It is tethered in that way.

33:02.940 --> 33:03.780
 Well, yes.

33:03.780 --> 33:06.240
 And so the new theories that the physicists are finding

33:06.240 --> 33:08.120
 beyond space time have that kind of tethering.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.880
 So they show precisely how you start with an epileptic hedron

33:11.880 --> 33:15.260
 and how you project this high dimensional structure

33:15.260 --> 33:18.280
 into the four dimensions of space time.

33:18.280 --> 33:22.320
 So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.820
 And they're doing the same thing

33:23.820 --> 33:25.120
 with the cosmological polytopes.

33:25.120 --> 33:29.760
 So they're the ones that are making the most concrete

33:29.760 --> 33:32.840
 and fun advances going beyond space time.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.360
 And they're tethering it, right?

33:35.360 --> 33:38.440
 They say this is precisely the mathematical projection

33:38.440 --> 33:41.600
 from this deeper structure into space time.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.640
 One thing I'll say about, as a non physicist,

33:44.640 --> 33:48.840
 what I find interesting is that they're finding just geometry,

33:48.840 --> 33:51.120
 but there's no notion of dynamics.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.960
 Right now, they're just finding

33:52.960 --> 33:57.400
 these static geometric structures, which is impressive.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.400
 So I'm not putting them down.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.160
 This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated

34:01.160 --> 34:06.160
 and brilliant and adventurous, it's all those things.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.720
 And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective

34:11.720 --> 34:12.920
 because geometry is beautiful.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.160
 It's absolutely.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.400
 And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data

34:16.400 --> 34:18.660
 that can't be seen in space time.

34:18.660 --> 34:22.940
 But I'm looking for a theory beyond space time

34:22.940 --> 34:24.440
 that's a dynamical theory.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.520
 I would love to find, and we can talk about that

34:27.520 --> 34:29.560
 at some point, a theory of consciousness

34:29.560 --> 34:33.100
 in which the dynamics of consciousness itself

34:33.100 --> 34:35.500
 will give rise to the geometry

34:35.500 --> 34:37.960
 that the physicists are finding beyond space time.

34:37.960 --> 34:38.800
 If we can do that,

34:38.800 --> 34:40.440
 then we'd have a completely different way

34:40.440 --> 34:42.620
 of looking at how consciousness is related

34:42.620 --> 34:45.280
 to what we call the brain or the physical world

34:45.280 --> 34:46.280
 more generally, right?

34:46.280 --> 34:49.280
 Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues,

34:49.280 --> 34:51.940
 well, 99% of them are trying to,

34:53.880 --> 34:56.720
 they're assuming space time is fundamental.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.160
 They're assuming that particles are fundamental,

34:59.160 --> 35:02.000
 quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.040
 Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental

35:04.040 --> 35:06.400
 and that therefore neurons and brains

35:06.400 --> 35:08.800
 are part of objective reality.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.880
 And that somehow when you get matter

35:10.880 --> 35:12.640
 that's complicated enough,

35:12.640 --> 35:16.240
 it will somehow generate conscious experiences

35:16.240 --> 35:17.840
 by its functional properties.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.520
 Or if you're panpsychist, maybe you,

35:20.520 --> 35:22.680
 in addition to the physical properties of particles,

35:22.680 --> 35:27.260
 you add your consciousness property as well.

35:27.260 --> 35:30.880
 And then you combine these physical and conscious properties

35:30.880 --> 35:32.220
 to get more complicated ones.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.740
 But they're all doing it within space time.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.960
 All of the work that's being done on consciousness

35:38.960 --> 35:41.880
 and its relationship to the brain

35:41.880 --> 35:45.000
 is all assumed something that our best theories

35:45.000 --> 35:46.800
 are telling us is doomed, space time.

35:46.800 --> 35:50.440
 Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?

35:50.440 --> 35:52.100
 So you bring up space time.

35:53.660 --> 35:56.960
 I mean, that's just one useful interface

35:56.960 --> 35:58.720
 we've used for a long time.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.720
 Surely there's other interfaces.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.700
 Is space time just one of the big ones

36:04.700 --> 36:06.800
 that you, to build up people's intuition

36:06.800 --> 36:10.360
 about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?

36:10.360 --> 36:15.040
 Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw

36:15.040 --> 36:16.560
 in the way we see the world?

36:17.480 --> 36:19.780
 Well, everything else that we think we know

36:20.640 --> 36:21.840
 are things in space time.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.220
 Sure.

36:24.220 --> 36:27.720
 And so when you say space time is doomed,

36:27.720 --> 36:32.720
 this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,

36:32.880 --> 36:35.900
 the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.720
 Not to the scientific method,

36:37.720 --> 36:40.800
 but to the fundamental ontology

36:40.800 --> 36:42.400
 and also the fundamental methodology,

36:42.400 --> 36:45.760
 the ontology of space time and its contents,

36:45.760 --> 36:47.360
 and the methodology of reductionism,

36:47.360 --> 36:51.940
 which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time,

36:51.940 --> 36:55.160
 we will find more and more fundamental laws.

36:55.160 --> 36:59.440
 And that's been very useful for space and time for centuries,

36:59.440 --> 37:01.440
 reductionism for centuries.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.680
 But now we realize that that's over.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.720
 Reductionism is in fact dead, as is space time.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.600
 What exactly is reductionism?

37:10.600 --> 37:13.120
 What is the process of reductionism

37:13.120 --> 37:17.640
 that is different than some of the physicists

37:17.640 --> 37:19.440
 that you mentioned that are trying to think,

37:19.440 --> 37:22.080
 trying to let go of the assumption of space time?

37:22.080 --> 37:24.560
 Looking beyond, isn't that still trying to come up

37:24.560 --> 37:27.360
 with a simple model that explains this whole thing?

37:27.360 --> 37:29.400
 Isn't it still reducing?

37:29.400 --> 37:30.240
 It's a wonderful question,

37:30.240 --> 37:33.120
 because it really helps to clarify two different notions,

37:33.120 --> 37:35.560
 which is scientific explanation on the one hand,

37:36.520 --> 37:39.840
 and a particular kind of scientific explanation on the other,

37:39.840 --> 37:40.860
 which is the reductionist.

37:40.860 --> 37:43.240
 So the reductionist explanation is saying,

37:43.240 --> 37:47.520
 I will start with things that are smaller in space time

37:47.520 --> 37:49.320
 and therefore more fundamental,

37:49.320 --> 37:51.080
 where the laws are more fundamental.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.880
 So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.000
 Whereas in science more generally,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.520
 we just say like when Einstein

37:59.520 --> 38:01.480
 did the special theory of relativity,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.600
 he's saying, let me have a couple of postulates.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.160
 I will assume that the speed of light is universal

38:06.160 --> 38:11.160
 for all observers in uniform motion,

38:12.000 --> 38:13.360
 and that the laws of physics,

38:13.360 --> 38:16.780
 so if you're for uniform motion are,

38:16.780 --> 38:18.080
 that's not a reductionist.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.020
 Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.

38:20.020 --> 38:23.400
 I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.560
 It's not a reductionist thing.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.780
 You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.

38:27.780 --> 38:30.600
 You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.080
 Same thing with his theory of gravity, right?

38:33.080 --> 38:35.600
 It's the falling elevator idea, right?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.760
 So this is not a reductionist kind of thing.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.800
 It's something different.

38:39.800 --> 38:44.800
 So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.720
 Reductionism has been a particularly useful

38:47.720 --> 38:49.520
 kind of scientific explanation,

38:49.520 --> 38:51.720
 for example, in thermodynamics, right?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.360
 Where the notion that we have of heat,

38:53.360 --> 38:56.640
 some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat,

38:56.640 --> 38:59.600
 it turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered,

38:59.600 --> 39:02.000
 well, hey, if we go to smaller and smaller scales,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.480
 we find these things called molecules or atoms.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.440
 And if we think of them as bouncing around

39:06.440 --> 39:08.680
 and having some kind of energy,

39:08.680 --> 39:13.680
 then what we call heat really can be reduced to that.

39:14.720 --> 39:19.100
 And so that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,

39:19.100 --> 39:21.400
 is a useful kind of scientific explanation

39:21.400 --> 39:25.480
 that works within a range of scales within space time.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.480
 But we know now precisely where that has to stop.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.240
 At 10 to the minus 33 centimeters

39:30.240 --> 39:32.720
 and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.360
 And I would be impressed

39:34.360 --> 39:37.520
 if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.440
 I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.880
 I don't even know how to comprehend

39:44.880 --> 39:47.360
 either of those numbers, frankly.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.080
 Just a small aside,

39:49.080 --> 39:51.520
 because I am a computer science person,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.120
 I also find cellular automata beautiful.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.840
 And so you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram,

39:57.840 --> 40:01.560
 who recently has been very excitedly exploring

40:02.360 --> 40:04.320
 a proposal for a data structure

40:04.320 --> 40:07.600
 that could be the numbers that would make you

40:07.600 --> 40:09.240
 a little bit happier in terms of scale,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.720
 because they're very, very, very, very tiny.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.480
 So do you like this space of exploration

40:15.480 --> 40:18.600
 of really thinking, letting go of space time,

40:18.600 --> 40:20.280
 letting go of everything and trying to think

40:20.280 --> 40:21.660
 what kind of data structures

40:21.660 --> 40:23.780
 could be underneath this whole mess?

40:23.780 --> 40:24.620
 That's right.

40:24.620 --> 40:27.800
 So if they're thinking about these as outside of space time,

40:27.800 --> 40:29.120
 then that's what we have to do.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.560
 That's what our best theories are telling us.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.600
 You now have to think outside of space time.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.520
 Now, of course, I should back up and say,

40:36.520 --> 40:40.360
 we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?

40:40.360 --> 40:41.960
 But that doesn't mean that there's not good work

40:41.960 --> 40:42.940
 to do on Newton.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.300
 There's all sorts of Newtonian physics

40:44.300 --> 40:46.220
 that takes us to the moon and so forth,

40:46.220 --> 40:47.240
 and there's lots of good problems

40:47.240 --> 40:49.960
 that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.200
 The same thing will be true of space time.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.960
 It's not like we're gonna stop using space time.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.420
 We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.

40:56.420 --> 40:59.720
 But for those scientists who are really looking

40:59.720 --> 41:04.240
 to go deeper, to actually find the next,

41:04.240 --> 41:06.160
 just like what Einstein did to Newton,

41:06.160 --> 41:07.440
 what are we gonna do to Einstein?

41:07.440 --> 41:09.800
 How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory

41:09.800 --> 41:10.900
 to something deeper?

41:10.900 --> 41:13.280
 Then we have to actually let go.

41:13.280 --> 41:17.800
 And if we're gonna do like this automata kind of approach,

41:18.800 --> 41:21.180
 it's critical that it's not automata in space time,

41:21.180 --> 41:23.580
 it's automata prior to space time,

41:23.580 --> 41:25.880
 from which we're going to show how space time emerges.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.240
 If you're doing automata within space time,

41:28.240 --> 41:29.640
 well, that might be a fun model,

41:29.640 --> 41:32.140
 but it's not the radical new step that we need.

41:33.520 --> 41:36.760
 Yeah, so the space time emerges from that whatever system.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.600
 Like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.520
 Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means

41:42.520 --> 41:43.760
 when we go beyond?

41:45.480 --> 41:48.080
 When you start to think about dynamics,

41:48.080 --> 41:50.360
 it could mean a lot of things.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.000
 Even causality could mean a lot of things

41:53.000 --> 41:56.760
 if we realize that everything's an interface.

41:58.320 --> 42:01.400
 Like how much do we really know is an interesting question.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.520
 Because you brought up neurons,

42:02.520 --> 42:05.440
 I gotta ask you yet another tangent.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.900
 There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at

42:07.900 --> 42:11.480
 called Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?

42:11.480 --> 42:14.160
 And I just enjoyed that thought experiment

42:14.160 --> 42:16.740
 that they provided, which is they basically,

42:16.740 --> 42:18.880
 it's a couple of neuroscientists,

42:18.880 --> 42:22.320
 Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,

42:22.320 --> 42:24.840
 who use the tools of neuroscience

42:24.840 --> 42:29.840
 to analyze a microprocessor, so a computer chip.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.200
 Now, if we lesion it here, what happens and so forth,

42:32.200 --> 42:34.540
 and if you go and lesion in a computer,

42:35.400 --> 42:38.280
 it's very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers

42:38.280 --> 42:40.440
 are not gonna give you a lot of insight into how it works.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.660
 And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of,

42:42.660 --> 42:44.560
 just using the basic approaches of neuroscience,

42:44.560 --> 42:47.160
 collecting the data, trying to intuit

42:47.160 --> 42:49.420
 about the underlying function of it.

42:49.420 --> 42:52.540
 And that helps you understand that

42:52.540 --> 42:55.900
 our scientific exploration of concepts,

42:57.720 --> 42:59.340
 depending on the field,

43:00.280 --> 43:05.000
 are maybe in the very, very early stages.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.480
 I wouldn't say it leaves us astray,

43:08.480 --> 43:09.560
 perhaps it does sometimes,

43:09.560 --> 43:14.560
 but it's not anywhere close to some fundamental mechanism

43:14.680 --> 43:16.440
 that actually makes a thing work.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.960
 I don't know if you can sort of comment on that

43:18.960 --> 43:20.440
 in terms of using neuroscience

43:20.440 --> 43:24.200
 to understand the human mind and neurons.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.320
 Are we really far away potentially

43:26.320 --> 43:29.560
 from understanding in the way we understand

43:30.480 --> 43:33.720
 the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?

43:33.720 --> 43:37.960
 So one thing about understanding

43:37.960 --> 43:39.580
 is you can understand for fun.

43:40.600 --> 43:45.600
 The other one is to understand so you could build things.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.120
 And that's when you really have to understand.

43:49.120 --> 43:49.960
 Exactly.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.880
 In fact, what got me into the field at MIT

43:53.880 --> 43:57.620
 was work by David Marr on this very topic.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.820
 So David Marr was a professor at MIT,

43:59.820 --> 44:02.040
 but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience,

44:02.040 --> 44:05.340
 studying just the architectures of the brain.

44:05.340 --> 44:08.660
 But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.

44:10.040 --> 44:15.040
 He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was,

44:15.040 --> 44:16.600
 left him unsatisfied

44:16.600 --> 44:19.440
 because he didn't know what the cerebellum was for

44:19.440 --> 44:21.680
 and why it had that architecture.

44:21.680 --> 44:25.480
 And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there.

44:25.480 --> 44:29.600
 And he said, he had this three level approach

44:29.600 --> 44:30.680
 that really grabbed my attention.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.640
 So when I was an undergrad at UCLA,

44:32.640 --> 44:34.760
 I read one of his papers in a class and said,

44:34.760 --> 44:35.600
 who is this guy?

44:35.600 --> 44:37.440
 Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.040
 What is being computed and why?

44:40.320 --> 44:42.360
 An algorithm, how is it being computed?

44:42.360 --> 44:44.720
 What are the precise algorithms?

44:44.720 --> 44:45.920
 And then the hardware,

44:45.920 --> 44:47.800
 how does it get instantiated in the hardware?

44:47.800 --> 44:50.400
 And so to really do neuroscience, he argued,

44:50.400 --> 44:52.760
 we needed to have understanding at all those levels.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.400
 And that really got me.

44:54.400 --> 44:57.080
 I loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was saying,

44:57.080 --> 45:00.080
 if you can't build it, you don't understand it effectively.

45:00.080 --> 45:02.000
 And so that's why I went to MIT.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.480
 And I had the pleasure of working with David

45:04.480 --> 45:07.740
 until he died just a year and a half later.

45:09.180 --> 45:12.760
 So there's been that idea that with neuroscience,

45:12.760 --> 45:15.880
 we have to have, in some sense, a top down model

45:15.880 --> 45:18.940
 of what's being computed and why

45:18.940 --> 45:20.000
 that we would then go after.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.480
 And the same thing with the, you know,

45:21.480 --> 45:24.240
 trying to reverse engineer a computing system

45:24.240 --> 45:25.520
 like your laptop.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.640
 We really need to understand

45:27.640 --> 45:29.120
 what the user interface is about

45:29.120 --> 45:34.120
 and what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.440
 You need to know why to really understand

45:37.440 --> 45:40.320
 all the circuitry and what it's for.

45:40.320 --> 45:45.320
 Now, we don't, evolution of a natural selection

45:46.560 --> 45:51.560
 does not tell us the deeper question that we're asking,

45:51.760 --> 45:53.680
 the answer to the deeper question, which is why?

45:53.680 --> 45:58.680
 What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?

45:59.600 --> 46:03.180
 All it tells us is that whatever reality is,

46:04.120 --> 46:05.500
 it's not what you see.

46:05.500 --> 46:10.500
 What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

46:12.180 --> 46:15.420
 So just to linger on this fascinating, bold question

46:15.420 --> 46:18.980
 that shakes you out of your dream state.

46:18.980 --> 46:23.420
 Does this fiction still help you in building intuitions

46:23.420 --> 46:27.780
 as literary fiction does about reality?

46:27.780 --> 46:30.260
 The reason we read literary fiction

46:30.260 --> 46:35.260
 is it helps us build intuitions and understanding

46:36.260 --> 46:39.140
 in indirect ways sneak up to the difficult questions

46:39.140 --> 46:41.900
 of human nature, great fiction.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.460
 Same with this observed reality.

46:46.100 --> 46:49.180
 Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,

46:49.180 --> 46:52.820
 help us build intuition about deeper truths

46:52.820 --> 46:55.020
 of how this whole mess works?

46:55.020 --> 46:58.900
 Well, I think that each theory that we propose

46:58.900 --> 47:01.100
 will give its own answer to that question, right?

47:01.100 --> 47:05.300
 So when the physicists are proposing these structures

47:05.300 --> 47:08.260
 like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytope,

47:08.260 --> 47:11.100
 associahedron and so forth beyond space time,

47:11.100 --> 47:14.200
 we can then ask your question for those specific structures

47:14.200 --> 47:17.620
 and say, how much information, for example,

47:17.620 --> 47:19.240
 does evolution by natural selection

47:19.240 --> 47:24.240
 and the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now

47:24.540 --> 47:26.940
 give us about this deeper reality?

47:26.940 --> 47:30.020
 And why did we evolve this way?

47:30.020 --> 47:33.020
 We can try to answer that question from within the deep.

47:33.020 --> 47:34.940
 So there's not gonna be a general answer.

47:34.940 --> 47:37.980
 I think what we'll have to do is posit

47:37.980 --> 47:39.300
 these new deeper theories

47:39.300 --> 47:41.480
 and then try to answer your question

47:41.480 --> 47:43.580
 within the framework of those deeper theories,

47:43.580 --> 47:47.140
 knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.

47:47.140 --> 47:49.860
 So is this paralyzing though?

47:49.860 --> 47:53.380
 Because how do we know we're not completely adrift

47:53.380 --> 47:57.700
 out to sea, lost forever from,

47:57.700 --> 48:00.080
 so like that our theories are completely lost.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.980
 So if it's all,

48:04.240 --> 48:07.940
 if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,

48:09.220 --> 48:12.060
 if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,

48:14.380 --> 48:18.360
 isn't that paralyzing for the scientific mind?

48:18.360 --> 48:20.780
 Well, it's interesting that you say introspect

48:20.780 --> 48:21.620
 to the bottom.

48:21.620 --> 48:26.620
 Because there is one,

48:26.940 --> 48:28.900
 again, this isn't the same spirit of what I said before,

48:28.900 --> 48:31.000
 which is it depends on what answer you give

48:31.000 --> 48:32.800
 to what's beyond space time,

48:32.800 --> 48:35.180
 what answer we would give to your question, right?

48:35.180 --> 48:39.660
 So, but one answer that is interesting to explore

48:39.660 --> 48:41.260
 is something that spiritual traditions have said

48:41.260 --> 48:43.640
 for thousands of years, but haven't said precisely.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.860
 So we can't take it seriously in science

48:45.860 --> 48:46.900
 until it's made precise,

48:46.900 --> 48:49.120
 but we might be able to make it precise.

48:49.120 --> 48:53.140
 And that is that they've also said something like

48:53.140 --> 48:54.780
 space and time aren't fundamental,

48:54.780 --> 48:56.820
 they're Maya, they're illusion.

48:56.820 --> 49:01.340
 And, but that if you look inside, if you introspect

49:03.240 --> 49:05.900
 and let go of all of your particular perceptions,

49:07.260 --> 49:10.340
 you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.

49:11.260 --> 49:15.340
 And that is, they claim,

49:15.340 --> 49:17.580
 being in contact with the deep ground of being

49:17.580 --> 49:21.220
 that transcends any particular conceptual understanding.

49:21.220 --> 49:24.340
 If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,

49:24.340 --> 49:26.020
 but, and I'm not saying it's not correct,

49:26.020 --> 49:28.340
 I'm just saying, if that's correct,

49:28.340 --> 49:30.740
 then it would be the case that as scientists,

49:30.740 --> 49:34.100
 because we also are in touch with this ground of being,

49:34.100 --> 49:36.980
 we would then not be able

49:36.980 --> 49:40.140
 to conceptually understand ourselves all the way,

49:40.140 --> 49:43.540
 but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.

49:43.540 --> 49:46.100
 And so we would, there would be a sense

49:46.100 --> 49:48.900
 in which there is a fundamental grounding

49:48.900 --> 49:50.840
 to the whole enterprise,

49:50.840 --> 49:53.320
 because we're not separate from the enterprise.

49:53.320 --> 49:57.380
 This is the opposite of the impersonal third person science.

49:57.380 --> 50:01.620
 This would make science go personal all the way down.

50:01.620 --> 50:04.020
 And, but nevertheless, scientific,

50:04.020 --> 50:07.020
 because the scientific method would still be

50:07.020 --> 50:09.320
 what we would use all the way down

50:09.320 --> 50:10.420
 for the conceptual understanding.

50:10.420 --> 50:11.460
 Unfortunately, I still don't know

50:11.460 --> 50:12.780
 if you went all the way down.

50:12.780 --> 50:15.940
 It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is

50:15.940 --> 50:17.300
 and we'll talk about it,

50:17.300 --> 50:22.300
 is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.

50:24.860 --> 50:28.520
 It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality,

50:28.520 --> 50:31.940
 but you still don't know when you get to the bottom.

50:31.940 --> 50:34.500
 A lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs

50:34.500 --> 50:37.980
 and they'll say, well, that takes my mind to certain places

50:37.980 --> 50:41.140
 where it feels like that is revealing

50:41.140 --> 50:43.120
 some deeper truth of reality,

50:43.120 --> 50:46.860
 but you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.

50:46.860 --> 50:51.860
 That's, in your view of this, you really don't know.

50:52.620 --> 50:54.100
 I mean, it's Gato's incompleteness

50:54.100 --> 50:55.620
 is that you really don't know.

50:55.620 --> 50:58.480
 My own view on it, for what it's worth,

50:59.740 --> 51:00.700
 because I don't know the right answer,

51:00.700 --> 51:05.700
 but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending.

51:05.780 --> 51:07.220
 I think that there will never,

51:07.220 --> 51:09.020
 that this is great, as I said before,

51:09.020 --> 51:12.020
 great job security for science.

51:12.020 --> 51:14.860
 And that we, if this is true,

51:14.860 --> 51:17.580
 and if consciousness is somehow important

51:17.580 --> 51:19.020
 or fundamental in the universe,

51:19.020 --> 51:20.620
 this may be an important fundamental fact

51:20.620 --> 51:21.980
 about consciousness itself,

51:21.980 --> 51:25.080
 that it's a never ending exploration

51:25.080 --> 51:27.520
 that's going on in some sense.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.100
 Well, that's interesting.

51:30.100 --> 51:31.900
 Push back on the job security.

51:31.900 --> 51:32.740
 Okay.

51:34.440 --> 51:37.500
 So maybe as we understand this kind of idea

51:37.500 --> 51:39.140
 deeper and deeper,

51:39.140 --> 51:42.940
 we understand that the pursuit is not a fruitful one.

51:42.940 --> 51:45.180
 Then maybe we need to,

51:45.180 --> 51:48.380
 maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere,

51:48.380 --> 51:51.260
 is you get smarter and smarter and smarter,

51:51.260 --> 51:55.580
 you realize that exploration is,

51:55.580 --> 51:59.260
 there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.

51:59.260 --> 52:03.960
 You could be sort of living maximally

52:03.960 --> 52:05.860
 in some way that's not exploration.

52:05.860 --> 52:10.020
 There's all kinds of video games you can construct

52:10.020 --> 52:11.820
 and put yourself inside of them

52:11.820 --> 52:15.220
 that don't involve you going outside of the game world.

52:15.220 --> 52:18.740
 It's a feeling, from my human perspective,

52:18.740 --> 52:21.020
 what seems to be fun is challenging yourself

52:21.020 --> 52:22.660
 and overcoming those challenges.

52:22.660 --> 52:25.220
 So you can constantly artificially generate challenges

52:25.220 --> 52:28.260
 for yourself, like Sisyphus and his boulder,

52:28.260 --> 52:30.660
 just, and that's it.

52:30.660 --> 52:32.300
 So the scientific method

52:32.300 --> 52:34.060
 that's always reaching out to the stars,

52:34.060 --> 52:35.200
 that's always trying to figure out

52:35.200 --> 52:37.380
 the puzzle on the bottom puzzle,

52:37.380 --> 52:40.540
 we're always trying to get to the bottom turtle.

52:40.540 --> 52:43.980
 Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition

52:43.980 --> 52:46.180
 that that's infinite pursuit,

52:48.880 --> 52:51.100
 we agree to start deviating from that pursuit

52:51.100 --> 52:53.180
 and start enjoying the here and now

52:53.180 --> 52:56.580
 versus the looking out into the unknown always.

52:56.580 --> 52:58.960
 Maybe that's looking out into the unknown

52:58.960 --> 53:03.960
 as a early activity for a species that's evolved.

53:07.580 --> 53:09.820
 I'm just sort of saying, pushing back,

53:09.820 --> 53:12.180
 as you probably got a lot of scientists excited

53:12.180 --> 53:13.620
 in terms of job security,

53:13.620 --> 53:17.780
 I could envision where it's not job security,

53:17.780 --> 53:20.780
 where scientists become more and more useless.

53:22.020 --> 53:25.500
 Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom

53:25.500 --> 53:29.660
 that allows us to study our own history,

53:29.660 --> 53:34.500
 but not much more than that, just to push back.

53:34.500 --> 53:35.540
 That's good pushback.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.340
 I'll put one in there for the scientists again,

53:39.340 --> 53:41.460
 but sure, but then I'll take the other side too.

53:41.460 --> 53:46.460
 So when Faraday did all of his experiments

53:46.700 --> 53:49.340
 with magnets and electricity and so forth,

53:49.340 --> 53:52.060
 he came up with all this wonderful empirical data

53:52.060 --> 53:54.140
 and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it

53:54.140 --> 53:56.140
 and wrote down a few equations,

53:56.140 --> 53:58.220
 which we can now write down in a single equation,

53:58.220 --> 54:00.180
 the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra,

54:00.180 --> 54:01.140
 just one equation.

54:03.900 --> 54:07.420
 That opened up unbelievable technologies.

54:07.420 --> 54:09.500
 People are zooming and talking to each other

54:09.500 --> 54:13.660
 around the world, the whole electronics industry.

54:13.660 --> 54:17.140
 There was something that transformed our lives

54:17.140 --> 54:18.460
 in a very positive way.

54:19.380 --> 54:21.800
 With the theories beyond space time,

54:21.800 --> 54:25.440
 here's one potential, right now,

54:25.440 --> 54:29.440
 most of the galaxies that we see, we can see them,

54:29.440 --> 54:31.040
 but we know that we could never get to them

54:31.040 --> 54:32.640
 no matter how fast we traveled.

54:32.640 --> 54:36.040
 They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.720
 So we can't ever get to them.

54:37.720 --> 54:39.160
 So there's all this beautiful real estate

54:39.160 --> 54:41.080
 that's just smiling and waving at us

54:41.080 --> 54:42.560
 and we can never get to it.

54:42.560 --> 54:43.400
 Yeah.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.560
 But that's if we go through space time.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.240
 But if we recognize that space time

54:47.240 --> 54:50.240
 is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.

54:50.240 --> 54:53.920
 We're not little things inside space time.

54:53.920 --> 54:58.120
 Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.960
 It's just the other way around.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.240
 Once we understand that,

55:02.200 --> 55:05.200
 and we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time,

55:07.080 --> 55:08.320
 maybe we won't have to go through space time.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.640
 Maybe we can go around it.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.080
 Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri

55:11.080 --> 55:11.920
 and not go through space.

55:11.920 --> 55:14.680
 I can just go right there directly.

55:14.680 --> 55:15.520
 It's a data structure.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.200
 We can start to play with it.

55:17.200 --> 55:21.680
 So I think that for what it's worth,

55:21.680 --> 55:26.680
 my take would be that the endless sequence of theories

55:27.760 --> 55:30.760
 that we could contemplate building

55:30.760 --> 55:35.760
 will lead to an endless sequence of new remarkable insights

55:36.600 --> 55:39.400
 into the potentialities, the possibilities

55:39.400 --> 55:41.920
 that would seem miraculous to us.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.200
 And that we will be motivated to continue the exploration

55:45.200 --> 55:49.040
 partly just for the technological innovations

55:49.040 --> 55:50.440
 that come out.

55:50.440 --> 55:53.960
 But the other thing that you mentioned though,

55:53.960 --> 55:55.560
 what about just being?

55:55.560 --> 55:58.960
 What if we decide instead of all this doing and exploring,

55:58.960 --> 56:00.120
 what about being?

56:00.120 --> 56:04.400
 My guess is that the best scientists will do both

56:04.400 --> 56:09.400
 and that the act of being will be a place

56:10.200 --> 56:12.640
 where they get many of their ideas

56:12.640 --> 56:16.560
 and that they then pull into the conceptual realm.

56:16.560 --> 56:18.480
 And I think many of the best scientists,

56:18.480 --> 56:19.880
 like Einstein comes to mind, right?

56:19.880 --> 56:21.120
 Where these guys say, look,

56:21.120 --> 56:25.400
 I didn't come up with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.

56:25.400 --> 56:28.080
 I was thinking in vague images

56:28.080 --> 56:31.760
 and it was just something nonconceptual.

56:31.760 --> 56:33.760
 And then it took me a long, long time

56:33.760 --> 56:35.880
 to pull it out into concepts

56:35.880 --> 56:38.400
 and then longer to put it into math.

56:38.400 --> 56:41.040
 But the real insights didn't come from data.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.520
 The real insights didn't come from just slavishly

56:44.520 --> 56:45.760
 playing with equations.

56:45.760 --> 56:48.360
 They came from a deeper place.

56:48.360 --> 56:51.640
 And so there may be this going back and forth

56:51.640 --> 56:54.720
 between the complete nonconceptual

56:54.720 --> 56:57.680
 where there's essentially no end to the wisdom

56:57.680 --> 56:58.840
 and then conceptual systems

56:58.840 --> 57:02.240
 where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.520
 And that may be, if consciousness is important

57:05.520 --> 57:07.640
 and fundamental, that may be what consciousness,

57:07.640 --> 57:09.400
 at least part of what consciousness is about

57:09.400 --> 57:13.440
 is this discovering itself, discovering its possibilities,

57:13.440 --> 57:16.240
 so to speak, and we can talk about what that might mean,

57:17.240 --> 57:20.920
 by going from the nonconceptual to the conceptual

57:20.920 --> 57:22.180
 and back and forth.

57:23.400 --> 57:26.440
 So you get better and better and better at being.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.480
 Right.

57:27.480 --> 57:29.920
 Let me ask you just to linger on the evolutionary,

57:31.080 --> 57:33.160
 because you mentioned evolutionary game theory

57:33.160 --> 57:35.280
 and that's really where you,

57:35.280 --> 57:37.120
 the perspective from which you come

57:37.120 --> 57:40.180
 to form the case against reality.

57:42.080 --> 57:45.360
 At which point in our evolutionary history

57:45.360 --> 57:49.520
 do we start to deviate the most from reality?

57:49.520 --> 57:54.520
 Is it way before life even originated on Earth?

57:55.800 --> 58:00.800
 Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?

58:02.280 --> 58:05.880
 Or is it when some inklings of what we think of

58:05.880 --> 58:10.880
 as intelligence or maybe even complex consciousness

58:11.680 --> 58:12.920
 started to emerge?

58:12.920 --> 58:14.880
 So where did this deviation,

58:15.980 --> 58:19.520
 just like with the interfaces in a computer,

58:19.520 --> 58:23.960
 you start with transistors and then you have assembly

58:23.960 --> 58:28.160
 and then you have C, C++, then you have Python,

58:28.160 --> 58:30.320
 then you have GUIs, all that kind,

58:30.320 --> 58:31.520
 you have layers upon layers.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.360
 When did we start to deviate?

58:33.360 --> 58:36.340
 Well, David Marr, again, my advisor at MIT,

58:37.520 --> 58:38.960
 in his book, Vision,

58:38.960 --> 58:42.380
 suggested that the more primitive sensory systems

58:42.380 --> 58:45.840
 were less realistic, less theoretical,

58:45.840 --> 58:47.040
 but that by the time you got to something

58:47.040 --> 58:48.280
 as complicated as the humans,

58:48.280 --> 58:51.640
 we were actually estimating the true shapes

58:51.640 --> 58:53.400
 and distances to objects and so forth.

58:53.400 --> 58:57.120
 So his point of view, and I think it was probably,

58:57.120 --> 59:01.680
 it's not an uncommon view among my colleagues

59:01.680 --> 59:06.200
 that, yeah, the sensory systems of lower creatures

59:06.200 --> 59:07.580
 may just not be complicated enough

59:07.580 --> 59:10.040
 to give them much, much truth.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.880
 But as you get to 86 million neurons,

59:12.880 --> 59:14.080
 you can now compute the truth,

59:14.080 --> 59:17.120
 or at least the parts of the truth that we need.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.260
 When I look at evolutionary game theory,

59:21.680 --> 59:24.120
 one of my graduate students, Justin Mark,

59:24.120 --> 59:27.700
 did some simulations using genetic algorithms.

59:27.700 --> 59:30.640
 So there he was just exploring,

59:30.640 --> 59:32.160
 we start off with random organisms,

59:32.160 --> 59:36.360
 random sensory genetics and random actions.

59:36.360 --> 59:38.560
 And the first generation was unbelievably,

59:38.560 --> 59:39.720
 it was a foraging situation.

59:39.720 --> 59:41.360
 They were foraging for resources.

59:41.360 --> 59:44.180
 Most of them stayed in one place,

59:44.180 --> 59:45.680
 didn't do anything important.

59:47.160 --> 59:51.180
 But we could then just look at how the genes evolved.

59:51.180 --> 59:53.280
 And what we found was,

59:55.080 --> 59:59.960
 what he found was that basically you never even saw

59:59.960 --> 1:00:04.960
 the truth organisms even come on the stage.

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:07.840
 If they came up, they were gone in one generation,

1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:09.440
 they just weren't.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:14.440
 So they came and went even just in one generation.

1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:16.340
 They just are not good enough.

1:00:16.340 --> 1:00:18.020
 The ones that were just tracking,

1:00:18.020 --> 1:00:20.900
 their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs

1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:25.900
 were far more fit than the truth seekers.

1:00:25.900 --> 1:00:29.260
 So an answer at one level,

1:00:29.260 --> 1:00:30.500
 I want to give an answer at a deeper level,

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:32.860
 but just with evolutionary game theory,

1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:36.140
 because my attitude as a scientist is,

1:00:36.140 --> 1:00:37.940
 I don't believe any of our theories.

1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:40.220
 I take them very, very seriously.

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.020
 I study them, I look at their implications,

1:00:42.020 --> 1:00:43.580
 but none of them are the gospel.

1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:46.020
 They're just the latest ideas that we have.

1:00:46.020 --> 1:00:49.340
 And so the reason I study evolutionary game theory

1:00:49.340 --> 1:00:52.460
 is because that's the best tool we have right now

1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:53.780
 in this area.

1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:56.300
 There is nothing else that competes.

1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:58.500
 And so as a scientist, it's my responsibility

1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:01.020
 to take the best tools and see what they mean.

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:02.620
 And the same thing the physicists are doing.

1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:03.820
 They're taking the best tools

1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:06.220
 and looking at what they entail.

1:01:06.220 --> 1:01:10.660
 But I think that science now has enough experience

1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:14.180
 to realize that we should not believe our theories

1:01:14.180 --> 1:01:17.020
 in the sense that we've now arrived.

1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:21.500
 In 1890, a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.

1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:25.780
 They were discouraging bright young students

1:01:25.780 --> 1:01:27.900
 from going into physics, because it was all done.

1:01:27.900 --> 1:01:31.540
 And that's precisely the wrong attitude forever.

1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:33.700
 It's the wrong attitude forever.

1:01:33.700 --> 1:01:37.740
 The attitude we should have is a century from now,

1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:39.700
 they'll be looking at us and laughing

1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:40.820
 at what we didn't know.

1:01:40.820 --> 1:01:43.300
 And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.

1:01:43.300 --> 1:01:45.300
 Just know that everything that we think

1:01:45.300 --> 1:01:48.460
 is so brilliant right now, our final theory.

1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:50.060
 A century from now, they'll look at us

1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:52.780
 like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,

1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.620
 how could they have been so dumb?

1:01:54.620 --> 1:01:56.900
 So I don't want to make that mistake.

1:01:56.900 --> 1:02:00.220
 So I'm not doctrinaire about any

1:02:00.220 --> 1:02:02.100
 of our current scientific theories.

1:02:02.100 --> 1:02:05.500
 I am doctrinaire about this.

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:08.260
 We should use the best tools we have right now.

1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:09.100
 That's what we've got.

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:10.340
 And with humility.

1:02:10.340 --> 1:02:13.740
 Well, so let me ask you about game theory.

1:02:13.740 --> 1:02:18.100
 I love game theory, evolutionary game theory.

1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:23.100
 But I'm always suspicious of it, like economics.

1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:25.860
 When you construct models,

1:02:25.860 --> 1:02:30.500
 it's too easy to construct things that oversimplify

1:02:31.380 --> 1:02:34.420
 just because we, our human brains,

1:02:34.420 --> 1:02:39.020
 enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables

1:02:39.020 --> 1:02:43.100
 that somehow represent organisms or represent people

1:02:43.100 --> 1:02:45.580
 and running a simulation that then allows you

1:02:45.580 --> 1:02:48.460
 to build up intuition and then it feels really good

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.420
 because you can get some really deep

1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:51.980
 and surprising intuitions.

1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:55.260
 But how do you know your models aren't,

1:02:55.260 --> 1:02:57.200
 the assumptions underlying your models

1:02:57.200 --> 1:02:58.900
 aren't some fundamentally flawed?

1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:00.700
 And because of that,

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:03.020
 your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.

1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:06.220
 So I guess my question is what are the limits

1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.860
 in your use of game theory, evolution game theory,

1:03:08.860 --> 1:03:10.220
 your experience with it?

1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:12.460
 What are the limits of game theory?

1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:15.780
 So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues

1:03:15.780 --> 1:03:19.340
 and friends who have tried to rerun simulations

1:03:19.340 --> 1:03:21.840
 and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth

1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:24.220
 is not comfortable and so many of my colleagues

1:03:24.220 --> 1:03:26.420
 are very interested in trying to show that we're wrong.

1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:28.620
 And so the idea would be to say that somehow

1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:30.580
 we did something, as you're suggesting,

1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:33.740
 maybe something special that wasn't completely general.

1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:36.980
 We got some little special part of the whole search space

1:03:36.980 --> 1:03:39.580
 in evolutionary game theory in which this happens to be true

1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:42.100
 but more generally organisms would evolve

1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:42.940
 to see the truth.

1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:48.100
 So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:52.180
 And they suggested that if you use

1:03:52.180 --> 1:03:53.980
 thousands of payoff functions,

1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:57.140
 so we in our simulations, we just use a couple,

1:03:57.140 --> 1:04:00.300
 one or two, because it was our first simulations, right?

1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:01.220
 So that would be a limit.

1:04:01.220 --> 1:04:02.380
 We had one or two payoff functions,

1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:03.900
 we showed the result of those,

1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:07.060
 at least for the genetic algorithms.

1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:10.460
 And they said, if you have 20,000 of them,

1:04:10.460 --> 1:04:12.740
 then we can find these conditions in which

1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:17.260
 truth seeing organisms would be the ones

1:04:17.260 --> 1:04:19.340
 that evolved and survived.

1:04:19.340 --> 1:04:21.140
 And so we looked at their simulations

1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:25.180
 and it certainly is the case that you can find

1:04:25.180 --> 1:04:27.580
 special cases in which truth can evolve.

1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:29.140
 So when I say it's probability zero,

1:04:29.140 --> 1:04:30.140
 it doesn't mean it can't happen.

1:04:30.140 --> 1:04:32.980
 It can happen, in fact, it could happen infinitely often.

1:04:32.980 --> 1:04:34.380
 It's just probability zero.

1:04:34.380 --> 1:04:38.260
 So probability zero things can happen infinitely often.

1:04:38.260 --> 1:04:40.380
 When you say probability is zero, you mean probability

1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:42.020
 close to zero.

1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:43.140
 To be very, very precise.

1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:46.740
 So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane

1:04:48.780 --> 1:04:53.180
 and I use a measure on a probability measure

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:56.300
 in which the area of a region is this probability.

1:04:58.340 --> 1:05:02.420
 Then if I draw a curve in that unit square,

1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:05.500
 it has measure precisely zero,

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:07.820
 precisely not approximately, precisely zero.

1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:10.100
 And yet it has infinitely many points.

1:05:10.100 --> 1:05:12.180
 So there's an object that for that probability measure

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:14.020
 has probability zero, and yet there's

1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.260
 infinitely many points in it.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:19.060
 So that's what I mean when I say that things

1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:20.300
 that are probability zero can happen

1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:21.780
 infinitely often in principle.

1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:26.500
 Yeah, but infinity, as far as, and I look outside often,

1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:29.180
 I walk around and I look at people.

1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:31.600
 I have never seen infinity in real life.

1:05:32.860 --> 1:05:35.980
 That's an interesting issue.

1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:37.540
 I've been looking, I've been looking.

1:05:37.540 --> 1:05:41.220
 I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.

1:05:41.220 --> 1:05:43.360
 And so the tools of mathematics,

1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:45.700
 you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism

1:05:45.700 --> 1:05:49.220
 that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.

1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:50.500
 That's a big debate in mathematics,

1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:52.260
 the intuitionists versus the ones who take,

1:05:52.260 --> 1:05:55.140
 for example, the real numbers as real.

1:05:55.140 --> 1:05:57.080
 And that's a fun discussion.

1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:59.060
 Nicholas Giesen, a physicist,

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:00.900
 has really interesting work recently

1:06:00.900 --> 1:06:04.160
 on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:09.160
 you could effectively quantize Newton,

1:06:10.020 --> 1:06:12.460
 and you find that the Newtonian theory

1:06:12.460 --> 1:06:14.460
 and quantum theory aren't that different

1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:16.540
 once you go with it.

1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:17.380
 It's funny.

1:06:17.380 --> 1:06:18.220
 It's really quite interesting.

1:06:18.220 --> 1:06:21.040
 So the issue he raises is a very, very deep one,

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.780
 and one that I think we should take quite seriously,

1:06:23.780 --> 1:06:27.660
 which is how should we think about the reality

1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:30.420
 of the contours hierarchy?

1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:35.420
 Aleph one, aleph two, and all these different infinities

1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:40.860
 versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?

1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:44.700
 So where everything's computable,

1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:46.420
 in some sense, everything's finite,

1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:49.780
 as big as you want, but nevertheless finite.

1:06:50.620 --> 1:06:52.560
 So yeah, that ultimately boils down to

1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:56.820
 whether the world is discrete or continuous

1:06:56.820 --> 1:06:59.320
 in some general sense.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:01.220
 And again, we can't really know,

1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:05.500
 but there's just a mind breaking thought,

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:07.340
 just common sense reasoning,

1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:09.880
 that something can happen,

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:13.820
 and as yet, probability of it happening is 0%.

1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:18.140
 That doesn't compute for common sense computer.

1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:18.980
 Right.

1:07:18.980 --> 1:07:21.780
 This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician

1:07:21.780 --> 1:07:23.460
 to really, and I'm not.

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:24.980
 Sharp is one word.

1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:27.420
 What I'm saying is common sense computer is,

1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:31.940
 I mean that in a very kind of,

1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:35.120
 in a positive sense,

1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:37.300
 because we've been talking about perception systems

1:07:37.300 --> 1:07:42.140
 and interfaces, if we are to reason about the world,

1:07:42.140 --> 1:07:45.060
 we have to use the best interfaces we got.

1:07:45.060 --> 1:07:50.060
 And I'm not exactly sure that game theory

1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:52.780
 is the best interface we got for this.

1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:53.620
 Oh, right.

1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:57.740
 In application of mathematics, tricks and tools

1:07:57.740 --> 1:08:00.620
 in mathematics, the game theory is the best we got

1:08:00.620 --> 1:08:03.980
 when we are thinking about the nature of reality

1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:07.020
 and fitness functions and evolution, period.

1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:07.860
 Right.

1:08:07.860 --> 1:08:10.080
 Well, that's a fair rejoinder,

1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:14.100
 and I think that that was the tool that we used.

1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:17.360
 And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool

1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:20.260
 and here's why, this mathematical tool

1:08:20.260 --> 1:08:23.300
 better captures the essence of Darwin's idea,

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:24.980
 John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it

1:08:24.980 --> 1:08:26.300
 with evolutionary game theory.

1:08:26.300 --> 1:08:27.540
 There's this thing.

1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:30.660
 Now there are tools like evolutionary graph theory,

1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:32.900
 which generalize evolutionary game theory,

1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:35.580
 and then there's quantum game theory.

1:08:35.580 --> 1:08:40.580
 So you can use quantum tools like entanglement,

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:44.460
 for example, as a resource in games

1:08:44.460 --> 1:08:48.660
 that change the very nature of the solutions,

1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:50.700
 the optimal solutions of the game theory.

1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:54.420
 Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.

1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:58.400
 It's a really interesting challenge of these ideas

1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:00.940
 where, okay, if you have a very large number

1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:03.220
 of fitness functions, or let's say you have

1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:07.500
 a nearly infinite number of fitness functions

1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:09.220
 or a growing number of fitness functions,

1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:13.740
 what kind of interesting things start to emerging

1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:15.540
 if you are to be an organism?

1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:18.860
 If to be an organism that adapts means

1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:22.420
 having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions.

1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:28.340
 Right, and so we've actually redone some of our own work

1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:30.300
 based on theirs, and this is the back and forth

1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:32.300
 that we expect in science, right?

1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:36.380
 And what we found was that in their simulations,

1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:39.140
 they were assuming that you couldn't carve the world

1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.040
 up into objects, and so we said,

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:43.940
 well, let's relax that assumption.

1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:45.980
 Allow organisms to create data structures

1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:47.720
 that we might call objects,

1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:49.420
 and an object would be you take,

1:09:49.420 --> 1:09:51.580
 you would do hierarchical clustering

1:09:51.580 --> 1:09:53.180
 of your fitness payoff functions,

1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:54.860
 the ones that have similar shapes.

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:58.300
 If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50

1:09:58.300 --> 1:09:59.540
 are all very, very similar,

1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:03.620
 so I can take all the perception, action, fitness stuff

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:05.700
 and make that into a data structure,

1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:08.300
 and we'll call that a unit or an object.

1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:09.640
 And as soon as we did that,

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.600
 then all of their results went away.

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:13.400
 It turned out they were the special case

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.660
 and that the organisms that were allowed

1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:21.460
 to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs

1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:22.940
 were the ones that were.

1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:25.340
 So the idea is that objects then,

1:10:25.340 --> 1:10:27.140
 what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?

1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:30.180
 This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle,

1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:31.780
 it was because I was seeing a true object

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:34.400
 that existed whether or not it was perceived.

1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.980
 Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.

1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:41.160
 I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding

1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:45.420
 a convenient way of looking at various fitness payoffs.

1:10:45.420 --> 1:10:48.300
 I can use this for drinking.

1:10:48.300 --> 1:10:50.740
 I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.

1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:52.840
 I could be somewhere with head with it.

1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:56.580
 If my goal is mating, this is pointless.

1:10:56.580 --> 1:10:59.640
 So I'm seeing for, what I'm coding here

1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:04.180
 is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.

1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:05.460
 When I pick up an apple,

1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:08.680
 now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs.

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:11.700
 When I pick up a rock, I'm getting, so for every object,

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:16.100
 what I'm getting is a different set of payoff functions

1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:18.180
 and with various actions.

1:11:18.180 --> 1:11:20.660
 And so once you allow that,

1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:25.620
 then what you find is once again that truth goes extinct

1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:28.020
 and the organisms that just get an interface

1:11:28.020 --> 1:11:29.540
 are the ones that win.

1:11:29.540 --> 1:11:33.220
 But the question, just sneaking up on, this is fascinating.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.180
 From where do fitness functions originate?

1:11:38.180 --> 1:11:40.100
 What gives birth to the fitness functions?

1:11:40.100 --> 1:11:43.340
 So if there's a giant black box

1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:45.180
 that just keeps giving you fitness functions,

1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:46.220
 what are we trying to optimize?

1:11:46.220 --> 1:11:51.220
 You said that water has different uses than an apple.

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.000
 So there's these objects.

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:58.860
 What are we trying to optimize?

1:11:58.860 --> 1:12:02.740
 And why is not reality a really good generator

1:12:02.740 --> 1:12:03.840
 of fitness functions?

1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:07.760
 So each theory makes its own assumptions and says,

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:09.660
 grant me this, then I'll explain that.

1:12:09.660 --> 1:12:11.020
 So evolutionary game theory says,

1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:13.420
 grant me fitness payoffs, right?

1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:16.340
 And grant me strategies with payoffs.

1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:18.540
 And I can write down the matrix

1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:20.340
 for this strategy interacts with that strategy.

1:12:20.340 --> 1:12:21.660
 These are the payoffs that come up.

1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:22.500
 If you grant me that,

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:24.560
 then I can start to explain a lot of things.

1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:26.460
 Now you can ask for a deeper question like,

1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:31.460
 okay, how does physics evolve biology

1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:36.100
 and where do these fitness payoffs come from, right?

1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:41.100
 Now that's a completely different enterprise.

1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:43.160
 And of course, evolutionary game theory then

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.360
 would be not the right tool for that.

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:46.500
 It would have to be a deeper tool

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.320
 that shows where evolutionary game theory comes from.

1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:55.220
 My own take is that there's gonna be a problem

1:12:55.220 --> 1:13:00.220
 in doing that because space time isn't fundamental.

1:13:01.820 --> 1:13:03.360
 It's just a user interface.

1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:06.220
 And that the distinction that we make

1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.500
 between living and nonliving

1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:10.620
 is not a fundamental distinction.

1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:15.140
 It's an artifact of the limits of our interface, right?

1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:18.040
 So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important wrinkle.

1:13:19.380 --> 1:13:22.260
 It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:24.280
 because if something looks like it's inanimate,

1:13:24.280 --> 1:13:27.180
 it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living.

1:13:27.180 --> 1:13:30.740
 Now it's much more complicated.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.200
 Certain things are obviously living.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:35.560
 I'm talking with you, I'm obviously interacting

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.660
 with something that's alive and conscious.

1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:40.700
 I think we've let go of the word obviously

1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:42.020
 in this conversation.

1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:43.500
 I think nothing is obvious.

1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:45.280
 Nothing's obvious, that's right.

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.700
 But when we get down to like an ant,

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:52.580
 it's obviously living, but I'll say it appears to be living.

1:13:52.580 --> 1:13:55.600
 But when we get down to a virus, now people wonder

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:57.260
 and when we get down to protons,

1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.840
 people say it's not living.

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:02.780
 And my attitude is look, I have a user interface.

1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:05.780
 Interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality

1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:10.780
 and others to, it's an uneven representation,

1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:11.980
 put it that way.

1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:14.920
 Certain things just get completely hidden.

1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:18.580
 Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:19.780
 and matter that's out there.

1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:22.160
 Our interface just plain flat out hides them.

1:14:23.380 --> 1:14:25.600
 The only way we get some hint is because

1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:28.740
 gravitational things are going wrong within our,

1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.980
 so most things are outside of our interface.

1:14:31.980 --> 1:14:34.180
 The distinction between living and nonliving

1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:35.980
 is not fundamental.

1:14:35.980 --> 1:14:37.200
 It's an artifact of our interface.

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:41.900
 So if we really, really want to understand

1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:43.360
 where evolution comes from,

1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:46.740
 to answer the question, the deep question you asked,

1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:48.660
 I think the right way we're gonna have to do that

1:14:48.660 --> 1:14:51.100
 is to come up with a deeper theory than space time

1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:54.300
 in which there may not be the notion of time

1:14:54.300 --> 1:14:59.300
 and show that whatever this dynamics of that deeper theory

1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:03.900
 is, by the way, I'll talk about how you could have dynamics

1:15:03.900 --> 1:15:07.140
 without time, but the dynamics of this deeper theory,

1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:11.020
 when we project it into, in certain ways,

1:15:11.020 --> 1:15:13.060
 then we do get space time and we get what appears

1:15:13.060 --> 1:15:15.060
 to be evolution by natural selection.

1:15:15.060 --> 1:15:17.760
 So I would love to see evolution by natural selection,

1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:20.220
 nature, red and tooth and claw, people fighting,

1:15:20.220 --> 1:15:22.220
 animals fighting for resources and the whole bit,

1:15:22.220 --> 1:15:24.260
 come out of a deeper theory in which perhaps

1:15:24.260 --> 1:15:27.260
 it's all cooperation, there's no limited resources

1:15:27.260 --> 1:15:30.660
 and so forth, but as a result of projection,

1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:33.580
 you get space and time, and as a result of projection,

1:15:33.580 --> 1:15:35.420
 you get nature, red and tooth and claw,

1:15:35.420 --> 1:15:38.420
 the appearance of it, but it's all an artifact

1:15:38.420 --> 1:15:39.260
 of the interface.

1:15:39.260 --> 1:15:43.220
 I like this idea that the line between living

1:15:43.220 --> 1:15:44.940
 and nonliving is very important

1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:48.660
 because that's the thing that would emerge

1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:52.420
 before you have evolution, the idea of death.

1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:58.900
 So that seems to be an important component

1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:01.060
 of natural selection, and if that emerged,

1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:05.540
 because that's also asking the question,

1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:09.100
 I guess, that I ask, where do fitness functions come from?

1:16:09.100 --> 1:16:12.980
 That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right?

1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:17.500
 It's the why, why, why?

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:20.300
 And one of the big underlying whys,

1:16:20.300 --> 1:16:22.660
 okay, you can start with evolution on Earth,

1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.100
 but without living, without life and death,

1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:28.700
 without the line between the living and the dead,

1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:30.500
 you don't have evolution.

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:32.540
 So what if underneath it, there's no such thing

1:16:32.540 --> 1:16:33.900
 as the living and the dead?

1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:39.500
 There's no, like this concept of an organism, period.

1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:42.700
 There's a living organism that's defined

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:47.700
 by a volume in space time that somehow interacts,

1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:52.820
 that over time maintains its integrity somehow.

1:16:52.820 --> 1:16:56.540
 It has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind.

1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:58.340
 The outside world, the environment,

1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:00.740
 and then inside, there's an organism.

1:17:00.740 --> 1:17:02.900
 So you're defining an organism,

1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:04.860
 and also you define that organism

1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:09.860
 by the fact that it can move, and it can become alive,

1:17:10.220 --> 1:17:12.540
 which you kind of think of as moving,

1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:14.700
 combined with the fact that it's keeping itself

1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:15.980
 separate from the environment,

1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:17.900
 so you can point out that thing is living,

1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:19.580
 and then it can also die.

1:17:21.060 --> 1:17:26.060
 That seems to be all very powerful components of space time

1:17:26.340 --> 1:17:28.380
 that enable you to have something

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:31.660
 like natural selection and evolution.

1:17:31.660 --> 1:17:33.140
 Well, and there's a lot of interesting work,

1:17:33.140 --> 1:17:36.180
 some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston and others,

1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:40.940
 where they have Bayes net kind of stuff

1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:43.780
 that they build on the notion of a Markov blanket.

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:47.180
 So you have some states within this network

1:17:47.180 --> 1:17:49.100
 that are inside the blanket, then you have the blanket,

1:17:49.100 --> 1:17:50.780
 and then the states outside the blanket.

1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:52.940
 And the states inside this Markov blanket

1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:54.260
 are conditionally independent of the states

1:17:54.260 --> 1:17:57.380
 outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.

1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:02.020
 And what they're looking at is that the dynamics inside

1:18:02.020 --> 1:18:04.460
 of the states inside the Markov blanket

1:18:04.460 --> 1:18:07.140
 seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside

1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:08.980
 and react to them in a way.

1:18:08.980 --> 1:18:11.260
 So it seems like you're doing probabilistic inferences

1:18:11.260 --> 1:18:14.220
 in ways that might be able to keep you alive.

1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:17.540
 So there's interesting work going on in that direction.

1:18:17.540 --> 1:18:21.540
 But what I'm saying is something slightly different,

1:18:21.540 --> 1:18:24.780
 and that is, like, when I look at you,

1:18:24.780 --> 1:18:26.380
 all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right?

1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:27.420
 That's all I see.

1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:31.140
 But I know that there's a deeper reality.

1:18:31.140 --> 1:18:32.580
 I believe that there's a much deeper reality.

1:18:32.580 --> 1:18:34.220
 There's the whole world of your experiences,

1:18:34.220 --> 1:18:35.780
 your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.

1:18:35.780 --> 1:18:39.820
 In some sense, the face that I see

1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:42.020
 is just a symbol that I create, right?

1:18:42.020 --> 1:18:44.740
 And as soon as I look away, I delete that symbol.

1:18:44.740 --> 1:18:46.220
 But I don't delete you.

1:18:46.220 --> 1:18:48.420
 I don't delete the conscious experience,

1:18:48.420 --> 1:18:50.180
 the whole world of your...

1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:53.420
 So I'm only deleting an interface symbol.

1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:58.420
 But that interface symbol is a portal, so to speak.

1:19:00.740 --> 1:19:04.300
 Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal

1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:07.260
 into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences.

1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:09.940
 That's why we can have a conversation.

1:19:09.940 --> 1:19:12.140
 Your consciousness is genuinely affecting mine,

1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:13.820
 and mine is genuinely affecting yours,

1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:17.580
 through these icons, which I create on the fly.

1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:18.700
 I mean, I create your face.

1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:20.060
 When I look, I delete it.

1:19:20.060 --> 1:19:22.020
 I don't create you, your consciousness.

1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:24.940
 That's there all the time, but I do...

1:19:24.940 --> 1:19:27.380
 So now, when I look at a cat,

1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:29.860
 I'm creating something that I still call living,

1:19:29.860 --> 1:19:31.860
 and I still think is conscious.

1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:34.660
 When I look at an ant, I create something

1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:38.100
 that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious.

1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:40.660
 When I look at something I call a virus,

1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:42.860
 now I'm not even sure I would call it living.

1:19:42.860 --> 1:19:45.380
 And when I look at a proton, I would say,

1:19:45.380 --> 1:19:48.860
 I don't even think it's not alive at all.

1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:53.580
 It could be that I'm nevertheless interacting

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.660
 with something that's just as conscious as you.

1:19:55.660 --> 1:19:57.420
 I'm not saying the proton is conscious.

1:19:57.420 --> 1:19:59.380
 The face that I'm creating when I look at you,

1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:00.540
 that face is not conscious.

1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:03.660
 That face is a data structure in me.

1:20:03.660 --> 1:20:06.180
 That face is an experience.

1:20:06.180 --> 1:20:07.420
 It's not an experiencer.

1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:12.660
 Similarly, a proton is something that I create

1:20:12.660 --> 1:20:15.020
 when I look or do a collision

1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:18.180
 in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that.

1:20:18.180 --> 1:20:21.380
 But what is behind the entity in space time?

1:20:21.380 --> 1:20:23.140
 So I've got this space time interface,

1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:25.540
 and I've just got this entity that I call a proton.

1:20:25.540 --> 1:20:27.460
 What is the reality behind it?

1:20:27.460 --> 1:20:30.500
 Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures.

1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:33.100
 The amplitude hadron, the sociahedron,

1:20:33.100 --> 1:20:36.020
 cause what's behind those?

1:20:36.020 --> 1:20:38.740
 Could be consciousness, what I'm playing with.

1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:41.140
 In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,

1:20:42.140 --> 1:20:43.740
 I could be interacting with consciousness.

1:20:43.740 --> 1:20:45.260
 Again, to be very, very clear,

1:20:45.260 --> 1:20:46.980
 because it's easy to misunderstand,

1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:49.300
 I'm not saying a proton is conscious.

1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.340
 Just like I'm not saying your face is conscious.

1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.060
 Your face is a symbol I create and then delete as I look.

1:20:56.060 --> 1:20:57.380
 So your face is not conscious,

1:20:57.380 --> 1:21:00.060
 but I know that that face in my interface,

1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:01.860
 the Lex Friedman face that I create,

1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:04.260
 is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal

1:21:04.260 --> 1:21:06.060
 into your consciousness.

1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.980
 The portal is less clear for a cat,

1:21:09.980 --> 1:21:11.860
 even less clear for an ant.

1:21:11.860 --> 1:21:13.380
 And by the time we get down to a proton,

1:21:13.380 --> 1:21:15.900
 the portal is not clear at all.

1:21:15.900 --> 1:21:17.140
 But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting

1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:20.140
 with consciousness, it just means my interface gave up.

1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:23.020
 And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after.

1:21:23.020 --> 1:21:26.980
 So your question really forces out a big part

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:29.100
 of this whole approach that I'm talking about.

1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:30.580
 So it's this portal and consciousness.

1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:33.300
 I wonder why you can't,

1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:35.940
 your portal is not as good to a cat,

1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:40.420
 to a cat's consciousness than it is to a human.

1:21:40.420 --> 1:21:43.700
 Does it have to do with the fact that you're human

1:21:45.100 --> 1:21:49.820
 and just similar organisms, organisms of similar complexity

1:21:49.820 --> 1:21:53.420
 are able to create portals better to each other?

1:21:53.420 --> 1:21:55.620
 Or is it just as you get more and more complex,

1:21:55.620 --> 1:21:57.860
 you get better and better portals?

1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:00.220
 Well, let me answer one aspect of it

1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.180
 that I'm more confident about,

1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:03.540
 then I'll speculate on that.

1:22:03.540 --> 1:22:07.180
 Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons?

1:22:07.180 --> 1:22:09.500
 Well, and elementary particles more generally.

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:12.260
 So quarks, leptons and gluons and so forth.

1:22:12.260 --> 1:22:16.100
 Well, the reason for that is because those are just

1:22:16.100 --> 1:22:18.260
 symmetries of space time.

1:22:19.220 --> 1:22:21.060
 More technically, they're irreducible representations

1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:22.940
 of the Poincare group of space time.

1:22:22.940 --> 1:22:26.940
 So they're just literally representations

1:22:26.940 --> 1:22:30.940
 of the data structure of space time that we're using.

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:33.260
 So that's why they're not very much insightful.

1:22:33.260 --> 1:22:35.700
 They're just almost entirely tied

1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:37.020
 to the data structure itself.

1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:38.940
 There's not much,

1:22:38.940 --> 1:22:40.980
 they're telling you only something about the data structure,

1:22:40.980 --> 1:22:42.420
 not behind the data structure.

1:22:42.420 --> 1:22:44.180
 It's only when we get to higher levels

1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:46.060
 that we're starting to, in some sense,

1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:49.820
 build portals to what's behind space time.

1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:50.660
 Sure.

1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:55.660
 Yeah, so there's more and more complexity built

1:22:55.940 --> 1:22:59.940
 on top of the interface of space time with the cat.

1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:01.340
 So you can actually build a portal, right?

1:23:01.340 --> 1:23:02.180
 Yeah.

1:23:02.180 --> 1:23:04.020
 Yeah, right.

1:23:06.700 --> 1:23:11.700
 Yeah, this interface of face and hair and so on, skin.

1:23:14.820 --> 1:23:18.100
 There's some syncing going on between humans though,

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.100
 where we synced, like you're getting

1:23:21.100 --> 1:23:24.500
 a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head

1:23:24.500 --> 1:23:29.500
 and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head.

1:23:30.700 --> 1:23:34.540
 Even though this is the first time we're talking,

1:23:34.540 --> 1:23:36.860
 you start to project your own memories.

1:23:36.860 --> 1:23:40.820
 You start to solve like a giant hierarchy of puzzles

1:23:40.820 --> 1:23:43.700
 about a human, because we're all,

1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:46.660
 there's a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes.

1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:48.340
 So you start to make a lot of inferences

1:23:48.340 --> 1:23:50.900
 and you build up this model of a person.

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:52.820
 You have a pretty sophisticated model

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:55.540
 what's going on underneath.

1:23:55.540 --> 1:23:59.060
 Again, I just, I wonder if it's possible

1:23:59.060 --> 1:24:00.980
 to construct these models about each other

1:24:00.980 --> 1:24:05.540
 and nevertheless be very distant from an underlying reality.

1:24:06.940 --> 1:24:08.260
 There's a lot of work on this.

1:24:08.260 --> 1:24:10.460
 So there's some interesting work called signaling games

1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:13.860
 where they look at how people can coordinate

1:24:13.860 --> 1:24:17.340
 and come to communicate.

1:24:17.340 --> 1:24:19.540
 There's some interesting work that was done

1:24:19.540 --> 1:24:21.420
 by some colleagues and friends of mine,

1:24:21.420 --> 1:24:26.420
 Louis Narens, Natalia Komarova, and Kimberly Jamieson,

1:24:26.740 --> 1:24:31.740
 where they were looking at evolving color words.

1:24:32.060 --> 1:24:36.020
 So you have a circle of colors, the color circle,

1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:39.900
 and they wanted to see if they could get people to cooperate

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:43.300
 and how they carved the color circle up into a circle.

1:24:43.300 --> 1:24:44.940
 Two units of words.

1:24:45.940 --> 1:24:49.660
 And so they had a game theoretic kind of thing

1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:50.700
 that they'd had people do.

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.940
 And what they found was that when they included,

1:24:52.940 --> 1:24:54.940
 so most people are trichromats,

1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:57.940
 you have three kinds of cone photoreceptors,

1:24:57.940 --> 1:24:59.500
 but there are some, a lot of men,

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:01.460
 7% of men are dichromats.

1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:04.420
 They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.

1:25:04.420 --> 1:25:09.020
 They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence

1:25:09.020 --> 1:25:12.580
 on the final ways that the whole space of colors

1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:14.900
 was carved up and labels attached.

1:25:14.900 --> 1:25:17.900
 You needed to be able to include the dichromats

1:25:17.900 --> 1:25:18.860
 in the conversation.

1:25:18.860 --> 1:25:20.140
 And so they had a bigger influence

1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:23.020
 on how you made the boundaries of the language.

1:25:23.020 --> 1:25:25.700
 And I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight

1:25:25.700 --> 1:25:27.900
 that there's going to be, again, a game,

1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:31.460
 perhaps a game where evolutionary or genetic algorithm

1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:34.420
 kind of thing that goes on in terms of learning

1:25:34.420 --> 1:25:37.900
 to communicate in ways that are useful.

1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:41.020
 And so, yeah, you can use game theory to actually explore

1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:42.580
 that are signaling games.

1:25:42.580 --> 1:25:44.740
 There's a lot of brilliant work on that.

1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:47.620
 I'm not doing it, but there's work out there.

1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:50.820
 So if it's okay, let us tackle once more

1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:52.620
 and perhaps several more times

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.580
 after the big topic of consciousness.

1:25:55.580 --> 1:25:59.540
 Okay, this very beautiful, powerful things

1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:03.100
 that perhaps is the thing that makes us human, what is it?

1:26:03.100 --> 1:26:05.300
 What's the role of consciousness in,

1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:08.140
 let's say even just the thing we've been talking about,

1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:13.140
 which is the formation of this interface, any kind of ways

1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:18.460
 you want to kind of start talking about it.

1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.420
 Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say.

1:26:22.940 --> 1:26:27.620
 99% are, again, assuming that space time is fundamental,

1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:30.020
 particles and space time, matter is fundamental,

1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:32.540
 and most are reductionist.

1:26:33.740 --> 1:26:37.100
 And so the standard approach to consciousness

1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:42.100
 is to figure out what complicated systems of matter

1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:45.940
 with the right functional properties

1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:48.540
 could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.

1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:50.540
 That's the general idea, right?

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:53.900
 So maybe you have to have neurons,

1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:58.620
 maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough.

1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:00.380
 They have to certain kinds of complexity

1:27:00.380 --> 1:27:02.780
 in their organization and their dynamics,

1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:05.140
 certain kind of network abilities, for example.

1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:10.140
 So there are those who say, for example,

1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:14.700
 that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse

1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:18.340
 of quantum states of microtubules and neurons, certainly.

1:27:18.340 --> 1:27:22.460
 So this is Hamroff and Penrose, that's kind of.

1:27:22.460 --> 1:27:25.460
 So you start with something physical,

1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:28.620
 a property of quantum states of neurons,

1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:32.180
 of microtubules and neurons,

1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:34.860
 and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse

1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:38.740
 of those is consciousness or conscious experiences.

1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:40.500
 Or integrated information theory.

1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:42.620
 Again, you start with something physical,

1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:44.940
 and if it has the right kind of functional properties,

1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:46.300
 it's something they call phi,

1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.060
 with the right kind of integrated information,

1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:50.620
 then you have consciousness.

1:27:50.620 --> 1:27:54.940
 Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,

1:27:54.940 --> 1:27:57.340
 where you might say, well,

1:27:57.340 --> 1:28:01.340
 in addition to the particles and space and time,

1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:03.420
 those particles are not just matter,

1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:06.540
 they also could have, say, a unit of consciousness.

1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:09.340
 And so, but once again, you're taking space and time

1:28:09.340 --> 1:28:11.220
 and particles as fundamental,

1:28:11.220 --> 1:28:14.100
 and you're adding a new property to them,

1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.780
 say, consciousness, and then you have to talk about how

1:28:16.780 --> 1:28:21.060
 when a proton and an electron get together

1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:24.340
 to form hydrogen, then how those consciousnesses

1:28:24.340 --> 1:28:27.340
 merge to or interact to create the consciousness

1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:29.020
 of hydrogen and so forth.

1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:31.540
 There's attention schema theory,

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:35.780
 which again, this is how neural network processes

1:28:35.780 --> 1:28:38.340
 representing to the network itself,

1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:41.820
 its attentional processes, that could be consciousness.

1:28:42.820 --> 1:28:44.340
 There's global workspace theory,

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.420
 and neuronal global workspace theory.

1:28:48.420 --> 1:28:50.420
 So there's many, many theories of this type.

1:28:50.420 --> 1:28:53.900
 What's common to all of them is they assume

1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:56.220
 that space time is fundamental.

1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:57.940
 They assume that physical processes

1:28:57.940 --> 1:28:59.620
 and space time is fundamental.

1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:02.540
 Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,

1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:04.620
 it's almost dualist in that regard.

1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:10.940
 And my attitude is our best science is telling us

1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:13.300
 that space time is not fundamental.

1:29:13.300 --> 1:29:17.100
 So why is that important here?

1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:22.100
 Well, for centuries, deep thinkers thought of earth, air,

1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:26.260
 fire, and water as the fundamental elements.

1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:28.580
 It was a reductionist kind of idea.

1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:30.100
 Nothing was more elemental than those,

1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:33.460
 and you could sort of build everything up from those.

1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:36.180
 When we got the periodic table of elements,

1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.020
 we realized that, of course,

1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:42.020
 we want to study earth, air, fire, and water.

1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:44.060
 There's combustion science for fire.

1:29:44.060 --> 1:29:49.020
 There's sciences for all these other things,

1:29:49.020 --> 1:29:50.300
 water and so forth.

1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:51.900
 So we're gonna do science with these things,

1:29:51.900 --> 1:29:54.180
 but fundamental, no, no.

1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:56.180
 If you're looking for something fundamental,

1:29:56.180 --> 1:29:58.500
 those are the wrong building blocks.

1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.180
 Earth has many, many different kinds of elements

1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:04.660
 that project into the one thing that we call earth.

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:06.820
 If you don't understand that there's silicon,

1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:07.660
 that there's iron,

1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:09.020
 that there's all these different kinds of things

1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:11.260
 that project into what we call earth,

1:30:11.260 --> 1:30:14.700
 you're hopelessly lost.

1:30:14.700 --> 1:30:17.020
 You're not fundamental, you're not gonna get there.

1:30:17.020 --> 1:30:19.820
 And then after the periodic table,

1:30:19.820 --> 1:30:22.260
 then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,

1:30:22.260 --> 1:30:26.500
 the particles of the standard model of physics.

1:30:26.500 --> 1:30:29.060
 And so we actually now know

1:30:29.060 --> 1:30:31.220
 that if you really want to get fundamental,

1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:34.660
 the periodic table isn't it.

1:30:34.660 --> 1:30:35.660
 It's good for chemistry,

1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:37.220
 and it's just wonderful for chemistry,

1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:39.860
 but if you're trying to go deep fundamental,

1:30:39.860 --> 1:30:41.500
 what is the fundamental science?

1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:42.340
 That's not it.

1:30:42.340 --> 1:30:44.580
 You're gonna have to go to quarks, leptons,

1:30:44.580 --> 1:30:46.100
 and gluons and so forth.

1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:51.100
 Well, now we've discovered space time itself is doomed.

1:30:51.660 --> 1:30:53.020
 Quarks, leptons, and gluons

1:30:53.020 --> 1:30:54.980
 are just irreducible representations

1:30:54.980 --> 1:30:56.580
 of the symmetries of space time.

1:30:57.540 --> 1:31:00.300
 So the whole framework

1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:03.860
 on which consciousness research is being based right now

1:31:03.860 --> 1:31:05.460
 is doomed.

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:09.220
 And for me, these are my friends and colleagues

1:31:09.220 --> 1:31:11.020
 that are doing this, they're brilliant.

1:31:11.020 --> 1:31:13.060
 They're absolutely, they're brilliant.

1:31:13.060 --> 1:31:17.780
 I, my feeling is I'm so sad

1:31:19.260 --> 1:31:21.780
 that they're stuck with this old framework

1:31:21.780 --> 1:31:25.100
 because if they weren't stuck with earth, air, fire,

1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:27.180
 and water, you could actually make progress.

1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:28.740
 So it doesn't matter how smart you are.

1:31:28.740 --> 1:31:30.260
 If you start with earth, air, fire, and water,

1:31:30.260 --> 1:31:32.020
 you're not gonna get anywhere, right?

1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:33.860
 Can I actually just,

1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:36.060
 because the word doomed is so interesting,

1:31:36.060 --> 1:31:39.260
 let me give you some options, multiple choice quiz.

1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:43.220
 Is space time, we could say is reality

1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:46.500
 the way we perceive it doomed,

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:51.500
 wrong or fake?

1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:59.180
 Because doomed just means it could still be right

1:31:59.300 --> 1:32:02.700
 and we're now ready to go deeper.

1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:03.860
 It would be that.

1:32:03.860 --> 1:32:08.340
 So it's not wrong, it's not a complete deviation

1:32:08.340 --> 1:32:10.620
 from a journey toward the truth.

1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:13.860
 Right, it's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong.

1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.700
 There is earth, air, fire, and water.

1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:19.060
 That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.

1:32:19.060 --> 1:32:20.820
 Right, well, there's also wrong,

1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:24.460
 which is they used to believe, as I recently learned,

1:32:24.460 --> 1:32:27.300
 that George Washington was the president,

1:32:27.300 --> 1:32:28.740
 the first president of the United States,

1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:31.460
 was bled to death for something

1:32:31.460 --> 1:32:34.020
 that could have been easily treated

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:36.380
 because it was believed that you can get,

1:32:36.380 --> 1:32:38.120
 actually, I need to look into this further,

1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:40.820
 but I guess you get toxins out or demons out.

1:32:40.820 --> 1:32:41.860
 I don't know what you're getting out

1:32:41.860 --> 1:32:43.540
 with the bleeding of a person.

1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:47.140
 So that ended up being wrong,

1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:50.740
 but widely believed as a medical tool.

1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:55.740
 So it's also possible that our assumption of space time

1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:58.940
 is not just doomed, but is wrong.

1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:02.200
 Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong.

1:33:02.200 --> 1:33:05.320
 But if we believe it's a useful tool, that's right.

1:33:05.320 --> 1:33:08.140
 But bleeding somebody to death

1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:10.100
 was believed to be a useful tool.

1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:11.140
 And that was wrong.

1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:13.820
 It wasn't just not fundamental.

1:33:13.820 --> 1:33:17.260
 It was very, I'm sure there's cases

1:33:17.260 --> 1:33:19.020
 in which bleeding somebody would work,

1:33:19.020 --> 1:33:23.540
 but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases.

1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:25.820
 So it could be that it's wrong,

1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:29.140
 like it's a side road that's ultimately leading

1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:32.600
 to a dead end as opposed to a truck stop or something

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.700
 that you can get off of.

1:33:34.700 --> 1:33:37.340
 My feeling is not the dead end kind of thing.

1:33:37.340 --> 1:33:39.460
 I think that what the physicists are finding

1:33:39.460 --> 1:33:41.700
 is that there are these structures beyond space time,

1:33:41.700 --> 1:33:44.260
 but they project back into space time.

1:33:44.260 --> 1:33:48.220
 And so space time, when they say space time is doomed,

1:33:48.220 --> 1:33:49.100
 they're explicit.

1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:50.420
 They're saying it's doomed in the sense

1:33:50.420 --> 1:33:51.780
 that we thought it was fundamental.

1:33:51.780 --> 1:33:53.220
 It's not fundamental.

1:33:53.220 --> 1:33:57.460
 It's a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure,

1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:59.500
 but there are deeper data structures

1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:03.980
 like cosmological polytope and space time is not fundamental.

1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:07.620
 What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong

1:34:07.620 --> 1:34:10.580
 is reductionism.

1:34:10.580 --> 1:34:14.020
 Which is saying space time is fundamental, essentially.

1:34:14.020 --> 1:34:14.940
 Right, right.

1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:19.940
 The idea that somehow being smaller in space and time

1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:23.900
 or space time is a fundamental nature of reality,

1:34:23.900 --> 1:34:26.160
 that's just wrong.

1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:28.220
 It turned out to be a useful heuristic

1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:29.900
 for thermodynamics and so forth.

1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:31.300
 And in several other places,

1:34:31.300 --> 1:34:33.200
 reductionism has been very useful,

1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.220
 but that's in some sense an artifact

1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.100
 of how we use our interface.

1:34:39.420 --> 1:34:41.620
 Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter.

1:34:41.620 --> 1:34:44.580
 Okay, this is very important for me to write down.

1:34:44.580 --> 1:34:46.300
 Ultimately. Ultimately, right.

1:34:46.300 --> 1:34:49.740
 It's useful for theories like thermodynamics

1:34:49.740 --> 1:34:51.460
 and also for understanding brain networks

1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:54.420
 in terms of individual neurons and neurons

1:34:54.420 --> 1:34:58.500
 in terms of chemical systems inside cells.

1:34:58.500 --> 1:35:00.340
 That's all very, very useful,

1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:02.380
 but the idea that we're getting

1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:05.900
 to the more fundamental nature of reality, no.

1:35:05.900 --> 1:35:08.260
 When you get all the way down in that direction,

1:35:08.260 --> 1:35:09.980
 you get down to the quarks and gluons,

1:35:09.980 --> 1:35:11.860
 what you realize is what you've gotten down to

1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:13.300
 is not fundamental reality,

1:35:13.300 --> 1:35:16.420
 just the irreducible representations of a data structure.

1:35:16.420 --> 1:35:17.780
 That's all you've gotten down to.

1:35:17.780 --> 1:35:21.660
 So you're always stuck inside the data structure.

1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.620
 So you seem to be getting closer and closer.

1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:25.660
 I went from neural networks to neurons,

1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:27.680
 neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles,

1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:29.980
 particles to quarks and gluons.

1:35:29.980 --> 1:35:31.500
 I'm getting closer and closer to the real.

1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:34.300
 No, I'm getting closer and closer to the actual structure

1:35:34.300 --> 1:35:36.660
 of the data structure of space and time,

1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:38.220
 the irreducible representations.

1:35:38.220 --> 1:35:39.680
 That's what you're getting closer to,

1:35:39.680 --> 1:35:43.180
 not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space time.

1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:46.300
 We'll also refer, we'll return again

1:35:46.300 --> 1:35:48.060
 to this question of dynamics

1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:51.860
 because you keep saying that space time is doomed,

1:35:51.860 --> 1:35:54.420
 but mostly focusing on the space part of that.

1:35:54.420 --> 1:35:59.020
 It's very interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too

1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.060
 because how do you have dynamics without time

1:36:01.060 --> 1:36:02.940
 is the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about.

1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:07.940
 But let us return your brilliant whirlwind overview

1:36:09.380 --> 1:36:11.440
 of the different theories of consciousness

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:12.500
 that are out there.

1:36:14.420 --> 1:36:18.760
 What is consciousness if outside of space time?

1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:20.860
 If we think that we want to have a model of consciousness,

1:36:20.860 --> 1:36:23.940
 we as scientists then have to say,

1:36:23.940 --> 1:36:25.140
 what do we want to write down?

1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:26.940
 What kind of mathematical modeling

1:36:26.940 --> 1:36:28.700
 are we gonna write down, right?

1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:30.180
 And if you think about it, there's lots of things

1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:32.580
 that you might want to write down about consciousness.

1:36:32.580 --> 1:36:34.180
 For all the complicated subject.

1:36:35.620 --> 1:36:36.880
 So most of my colleagues are saying,

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:38.380
 let's start with matter or neurons

1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:40.940
 and see what properties of matter

1:36:40.940 --> 1:36:42.500
 could create consciousness.

1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:45.200
 But I'm saying that that whole thing is out.

1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:47.740
 Space time is doomed, that whole thing is out.

1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:51.420
 We need to look at consciousness qua consciousness.

1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:53.300
 In other words, not as something that arises

1:36:53.300 --> 1:36:55.220
 in space and time, but perhaps as something

1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:58.260
 that creates space and time as a data structure.

1:36:58.260 --> 1:36:59.440
 So what do we want?

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:02.020
 And here again, there's no hard and fast rule,

1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:03.820
 but what you as a scientist have to do

1:37:03.820 --> 1:37:08.820
 is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions

1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:13.740
 that are gonna allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory.

1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:15.120
 That is the trick.

1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:17.360
 So what do I want?

1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:20.780
 So what I chose to do was to have three things.

1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:25.260
 I said that there are conscious experiences.

1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:28.960
 Feeling of headache, the smell of garlic,

1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:32.240
 experiencing the color red.

1:37:32.240 --> 1:37:33.640
 There are, those are conscious,

1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:34.880
 so that's the primitive of the theory.

1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:36.820
 And the reason I want few primitives, why?

1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.800
 Because those are the miracles of the theory, right?

1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:40.720
 The primitives, the assumptions of the theory

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.400
 are the things you're not going to explain.

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:43.980
 Those are the things you assume.

1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:46.320
 And those experiences, you particularly mean

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:49.600
 there's a subjectiveness to them.

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:51.680
 That's the thing when people refer

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:54.040
 to the hard problem of consciousness,

1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:58.160
 is it feels like something to look at the color red, okay.

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.400
 Exactly right, it feels like something to have a headache

1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:02.760
 or to feel upset to your stomach.

1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:04.520
 It feels like something.

1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:09.520
 And so I'm going to grant that in this theory,

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:12.480
 there are experiences and they're fundamental in some sense.

1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:13.840
 So conscious experience.

1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:15.720
 So they're not derived from physics.

1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:18.780
 They're not functional properties of particles.

1:38:18.780 --> 1:38:21.800
 They are sui generis, they exist.

1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.760
 Just like we assume space time exists.

1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:26.320
 I'm now saying space time is just a data structure.

1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.520
 It doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences.

1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:30.800
 Sorry to interrupt once again,

1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:34.500
 but should we be focusing in your thinking on humans alone?

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:40.640
 Or is there something about in relation

1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:42.560
 to other kinds of organisms that have

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.640
 a sufficiently high level of complexity?

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:49.640
 Or even, or is there some kind of generalization

1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:54.380
 of the panpsychist idea that all consciousness permeates,

1:38:54.380 --> 1:38:55.760
 all matter?

1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:58.720
 Outside of the usual definition

1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:01.220
 of what matter is inside space time.

1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:04.320
 So it's beyond human consciousness.

1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.380
 Human consciousness, from my point of view,

1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:10.520
 would be one of a countless variety of consciousnesses.

1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.400
 And even within human consciousness,

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:15.840
 there's countless variety of consciousnesses within us.

1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:18.460
 I mean, you have your left and right hemisphere.

1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:20.760
 And apparently if you split the corpus callosum,

1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:22.800
 the personality of the left hemisphere

1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:24.400
 and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere

1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:26.400
 can be very different from the right hemisphere.

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:30.680
 And their conscious experiences can be disjoint.

1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:32.520
 One could have one conscious experience.

1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:33.880
 They can play 20 questions.

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.880
 The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind

1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:37.400
 and the right hemisphere has to guess.

1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:38.920
 And it might not get it.

1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:40.700
 So even within you,

1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:43.080
 there is more than just one consciousness.

1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:45.240
 It's lots of consciousnesses.

1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:48.720
 So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after

1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:50.380
 is not just human consciousness.

1:39:50.380 --> 1:39:51.940
 It's going to be just consciousness.

1:39:51.940 --> 1:39:56.720
 And I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop

1:39:56.720 --> 1:39:59.320
 in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.

1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:02.680
 That said, I should clarify that the black hole

1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:07.400
 of consciousness is the home cat.

1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:11.840
 I'm pretty sure cats lack, is the embodiment of evil

1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.000
 and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.

1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.120
 So I just want to lay that on the table.

1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:17.960
 That's the theory I'm working on.

1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:20.880
 I don't have any good evidence, but it's just an intuition.

1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:22.080
 It's just a shout out.

1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:24.320
 Sorry to distract.

1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:25.720
 So that's the first assumption.

1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:27.200
 The first assumption, that's right.

1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:29.200
 The second assumption is that

1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:31.680
 these experiences have consequences.

1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:35.040
 So I'm going to say that conscious experiences

1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:37.400
 can trigger other conscious experiences somehow.

1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:43.360
 So really in some sense, there's two basic assumptions.

1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:46.200
 There's some kind of causality.

1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:47.800
 Is there a chain of causality?

1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:50.320
 Does this relate to dynamics?

1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:52.560
 I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship.

1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:58.840
 So I'm trying to be as nonspecific to begin with

1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.080
 and see where it leads me.

1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:04.000
 So what I can write down are probability spaces.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.640
 So a probability space, which contains

1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:09.560
 the conscious experiences that this consciousness can have.

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:14.560
 So I call this a conscious agent, this technical thing.

1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:19.320
 Annika Harris and I've talked about this

1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:22.880
 and she rightly cautions me that people will think

1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:25.120
 that I'm bringing in a notion of a self or agency

1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:27.440
 and so forth when I say conscious agent.

1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:30.000
 So I just want to say that I use the term conscious agent

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.280
 merely as a technical term.

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:35.640
 There is no notion of self in my fundamental definition

1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:36.640
 of a conscious agent.

1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:41.080
 There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships

1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:43.000
 of how they trigger other experiences.

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.280
 So the agent is the generator of the conscious experience?

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:49.560
 The agent is a mathematical structure

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:51.920
 that includes a probability measure,

1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:56.080
 the probability space of a possible conscious experiences

1:41:56.080 --> 1:42:00.080
 and a Markovian kernel, which describes how

1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:02.800
 if this agent has certain conscious experiences,

1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.280
 how that will affect the experiences

1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:07.520
 of other conscious agents, including itself.

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.920
 But you don't think of that as a self?

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:13.720
 No, there is no notion of a self here.

1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:16.560
 There's no notion of really of an agent.

1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:19.120
 But is there a locality?

1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:21.160
 Is there an organism?

1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:22.000
 There's no space.

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:22.880
 There's no.

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:27.880
 So this is, these are conscious units, conscious entities.

1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:30.440
 But they're distinct in some way

1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:32.280
 because they have to interact.

1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:33.640
 Well, so here's the interesting thing.

1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:36.080
 When we write down the mathematics,

1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.280
 when you have two of these conscious agents interacting,

1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:43.720
 the pair satisfy a definition of a conscious agent.

1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:46.160
 So they are a single conscious agent.

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:48.520
 So there is one conscious agent.

1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.360
 But it has a nice analytic decomposition

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:53.200
 into as many conscious agents as you wish.

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:55.520
 So that's a nice interface.

1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.720
 It's a very useful scientific interface.

1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:03.200
 It's a scale free or if you like a fractal like approach

1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:06.320
 to it in which we can use the same unit of analysis

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:09.760
 at all scales in studying consciousness.

1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:12.240
 But if I want to talk about,

1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:17.160
 so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving,

1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:20.800
 intelligence, self, agency.

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:22.320
 So none of that is fundamental.

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.360
 So, and the reason I did that was

1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:29.880
 because I want to assume as little as possible.

1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:32.160
 Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory.

1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:34.520
 It's not something you explain, it's something you assume.

1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:37.400
 So I have to build networks of conscious agents.

1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:40.000
 If I want to have a notion of a self,

1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:41.520
 I have to build a self.

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:43.920
 I have to build learning, memory, problem solving,

1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:46.720
 intelligence and planning, all these different things.

1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:49.480
 I have to build networks of conscious agents to do that.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:52.400
 It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.680
 are computationally universal, that's trivial.

1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:56.800
 So anything that we can do with neural networks

1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:00.480
 or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents.

1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:01.320
 That's trivial.

1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.320
 But you can also do more.

1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:08.200
 The events in the probability space need not be computable.

1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:11.800
 So the Markovian dynamics is not restricted

1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:14.440
 to computable functions

1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:17.280
 because the very events themselves need not be computable.

1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:20.640
 So this can capture any computable theory.

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:22.000
 Anything we can do with neural networks,

1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.640
 we can do with conscious agent networks.

1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:27.520
 But it leaves open the door for the possibility

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:31.960
 of noncomputable interactions between conscious agents.

1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:36.960
 So if we want a theory of memory, we have to build it.

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:39.080
 And there's lots of different ways you could build.

1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:40.000
 We've actually got a paper,

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:41.720
 Chris Fields took the lead on this.

1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:44.640
 And we have a paper called Conscious Agent Networks

1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:47.160
 where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use

1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:49.080
 these networks of conscious agents to build memory

1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:52.280
 and to build primitive kinds of learning.

1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:56.160
 But can you provide some intuition

1:44:56.160 --> 1:44:58.880
 of what conscious networks,

1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:03.880
 networks of conscious agents helps you?

1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:05.840
 First of all, what that looks like.

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:08.920
 And I don't just mean mathematically.

1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:11.600
 Of course, maybe that might help build up intuition.

1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:14.000
 But how that helps us potentially solve

1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:15.640
 the hard problem of consciousness.

1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:21.640
 Or is that baked in, that that exists?

1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:26.640
 Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness,

1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:30.360
 why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious ice cream

1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:33.840
 with networks of conscious agents?

1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:36.040
 Or is that taken as an assumption?

1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:40.080
 So the standard way the hard problem is thought of

1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:44.600
 is we're assuming space and time and particles

1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:46.000
 or neurons, for example.

1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:50.000
 These are just physical things that have no consciousness.

1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.760
 And we have to explain how the conscious experience

1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:54.920
 of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those.

1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:57.080
 So the typical hard problem of consciousness

1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:58.720
 is that problem, right?

1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:02.040
 How do you boot up the taste of chocolate,

1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:06.280
 the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say,

1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:10.560
 or the right kind of artificial intelligence circuitry?

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:11.640
 How do you boot that up?

1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:14.320
 That's typically what the hard problem of consciousness

1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:15.800
 means to researchers.

1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:18.360
 Notice that I'm changing the problem.

1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:21.360
 I'm not trying to boot up conscious experiences

1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:23.800
 from the dynamics of neurons or silicon

1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.000
 or something like that.

1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.840
 I'm saying that that's the wrong problem.

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.920
 My hard problem would go in the other direction.

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:33.480
 If I start with conscious experiences,

1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:35.640
 how do I build up space and time?

1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:37.560
 How do I build up what I call the physical world?

1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:39.560
 How do I build up what we call brains?

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.080
 Because I'm saying consciousness

1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:45.640
 is not something that brains do.

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.440
 Brains are something that consciousness makes up.

1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:50.840
 It's among the experience,

1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.560
 it's an ephemeral experience in consciousness.

1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:57.040
 I look inside, so to be very, very clear,

1:46:57.040 --> 1:46:58.760
 right now, I have no neurons.

1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.200
 If you looked, you would see neurons.

1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:05.320
 That's a data structure that you would create on the fly,

1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:06.440
 and it's a very useful one.

1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:08.560
 As soon as you look away,

1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:10.000
 you garbage collect that data structure,

1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.800
 just like that Necker cube that I was talking about

1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:12.960
 on the piece of paper.

1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:17.360
 When you look, you see a 3D cube you created on the fly.

1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:19.600
 As soon as you look away, that's gone.

1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:22.920
 When you say you, you mean a human being scientist.

1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:24.600
 Right now, that's right.

1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:26.960
 More generally, it'll be conscious agents,

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.400
 because as you pointed out,

1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:30.920
 am I asking for a theory of consciousness

1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:31.760
 only about humans?

1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:33.920
 No, it's consciousness,

1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:38.240
 which human consciousness is just a tiny sliver.

1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:40.160
 But you are saying that there is,

1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:41.840
 that's a useful data structure.

1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:43.760
 How many other data structures are there?

1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:45.480
 That's why I said you human.

1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:47.480
 If there's another Earth,

1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:49.640
 if there's another alien civilization

1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:51.640
 and doing these kinds of investigations,

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.280
 would they come up with similar data structures?

1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:55.120
 Probably not.

1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:56.560
 What is the space of data structures,

1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:57.960
 I guess is what I'm asking.

1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:04.000
 My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:05.560
 consciousness is all there is,

1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:10.440
 then the only thing that mathematical structure

1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:13.080
 can be about is possibilities of consciousness.

1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:17.880
 And that suggests to me

1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:21.280
 that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses,

1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:25.120
 and a vanishingly small fraction of them

1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.800
 use space time data structures

1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.520
 and the kinds of structures that we use.

1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.040
 There's an infinite variety of data structures.

1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:33.120
 Now, this is very similar

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:35.000
 to something that Max Tegmark has said,

1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.040
 but I want to distinguish it.

1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:40.440
 He has this level four multiverse idea.

1:48:40.440 --> 1:48:43.040
 He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.

1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:45.000
 And so that's the fundamental reality.

1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.360
 And since there's an infinite variety of,

1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:49.000
 endless variety of mathematical structures,

1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:52.560
 there's an infinite variety of multiverses in his view.

1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:55.280
 I'm saying something similar in spirit,

1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:56.960
 but importantly different.

1:48:56.960 --> 1:48:57.800
 There's an infinite variety

1:48:57.800 --> 1:48:59.720
 of mathematical structures, absolutely.

1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:03.160
 But mathematics isn't the fundamental reality

1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:04.960
 in this framework.

1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:06.680
 Consciousness is,

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.360
 and mathematics is to consciousness

1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:12.000
 like bones are to an organism.

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:12.880
 You need the bones.

1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:16.480
 So mathematics is not divorced from consciousness,

1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:20.280
 but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means.

1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:24.440
 And so there's an infinite variety of consciousnesses

1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.440
 and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.

1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.560
 And therefore worlds, your common worlds,

1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:37.200
 data structures that they can use to communicate.

1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:40.200
 So space and time is just one of an infinite variety.

1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:43.600
 And so I think that what we'll find is that

1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:46.280
 as we go outside of our little space time bubble,

1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:51.760
 we will encounter utterly alien forms

1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:54.920
 of conscious experience that we may not be able

1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:59.920
 to really comprehend in the following sense.

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:03.120
 If I ask you to imagine a color

1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:04.480
 that you've never seen before,

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.480
 does anything happen?

1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:09.080
 Nothing happens.

1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:11.120
 Nothing happens.

1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:12.960
 And that's just one color.

1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:14.640
 I'm asking for just a color.

1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:16.320
 We actually know, by the way,

1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:20.320
 that apparently there are women called tetraphams

1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:25.600
 who have four color receptors, not just three.

1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:28.840
 And Kimberly Jameson and others who've studied these women

1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:31.080
 have good evidence that they apparently have

1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:32.960
 a new dimension of color experience

1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:35.840
 that the rest of us don't have.

1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:40.240
 So these women are apparently living in a world of color

1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:42.280
 that you and I can't even concretely imagine.

1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:43.760
 No man can imagine them.

1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:44.600
 Yeah.

1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:46.840
 And yet they're real color experiences.

1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.840
 And so in that sense, I'm saying,

1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:50.960
 now take that little baby step,

1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:52.960
 oh, there are women who have color experiences

1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:53.800
 that I could never have.

1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:55.000
 Well, that's shocking.

1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.520
 Now take that infinite.

1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:00.600
 There are consciousnesses where every aspect

1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:03.440
 of their experiences is like that new color.

1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:05.760
 It's something utterly alien to you.

1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:07.840
 You have nothing like that.

1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:10.040
 And yet these are all possible varieties

1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:11.320
 of conscious experience.

1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:13.360
 And when you say there's a lot of consciousnesses,

1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:16.400
 as a singular consciousness,

1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:19.960
 basically the set of possible experiences you can have

1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:21.240
 in that subjective way,

1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.040
 as opposed to the underlying mechanism.

1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:28.000
 Because you say that, you know,

1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.800
 having a extra color receptor,

1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:34.080
 ability to have new experiences

1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:36.640
 that somehow a different consciousness,

1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:39.680
 is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,

1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:41.480
 the subjectivity itself?

1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:42.320
 Right.

1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:45.200
 Because when we have two of these conscious agents

1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:46.720
 interacting, the mathematics,

1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:49.560
 they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent.

1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:52.240
 So in fact, they are a single conscious agent.

1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:55.480
 So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying,

1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:57.360
 I'm postulating with my colleagues,

1:51:57.360 --> 1:51:58.800
 Chaiton and Chris and others,

1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:00.280
 Robert Pretner and so forth.

1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:05.320
 There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated.

1:52:05.320 --> 1:52:08.320
 But fortunately, we can, for analytic purposes,

1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:10.160
 break it down all the way to,

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:11.760
 in some sense, the simplest conscious agent,

1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:13.960
 which has one conscious experience, one.

1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.360
 This one agent can experience red 35, and that's it.

1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.280
 That's what it experiences.

1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:22.840
 You can get all the way down to that.

1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:26.880
 So you think it's possible that consciousness,

1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:29.200
 whatever that is,

1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:34.040
 is much more, is fundamental,

1:52:34.040 --> 1:52:37.520
 or at least much more in the direction of the fundamental

1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:40.520
 than is space time as we perceive it?

1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.520
 That's the proposal.

1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:45.040
 And therefore, what I have to do,

1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:47.560
 in terms of the hard problem of consciousness,

1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:51.680
 is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents

1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:54.000
 could lead to what we call space and time

1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.720
 and neurons and brain activity.

1:52:56.720 --> 1:53:00.400
 In other words, we have to show how you get space time

1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:05.400
 and physical objects entirely from a theory

1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:07.720
 of conscious agents outside of space time,

1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:10.560
 with the dynamics outside of space time.

1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:13.960
 So that's, and I can tell you how we plan to do that,

1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:15.800
 but that's the idea.

1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:18.920
 Okay, the magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.

1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:22.760
 So there's a mathematical kind of thing

1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:24.480
 that we could say here, how it can emerge

1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:27.800
 within this system of networks of conscious agents,

1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:32.800
 but is there going to be at the end of the proof

1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:36.760
 why chocolate is so delicious?

1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:38.280
 Or no?

1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:41.960
 I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb questions

1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:43.200
 to try to sneak up.

1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:45.760
 Oh, well, that's the right question, and when I say

1:53:45.760 --> 1:53:48.080
 that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,

1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:51.560
 what that means is, in the current version of my theory,

1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:54.120
 I'm not explaining conscious experiences

1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:55.720
 where they came from.

1:53:55.720 --> 1:53:58.160
 That's the miracle, that's one of the miracles.

1:53:58.160 --> 1:53:59.600
 So I have two miracles in my theory.

1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:02.320
 There are conscious experiences, like the taste of chocolate,

1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:06.200
 and that there's a probabilistic relationship.

1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:08.680
 When certain conscious experiences occur,

1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:10.560
 others are more likely to occur.

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.680
 Those are the two miracles that are possible.

1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:17.600
 Is it possible to get beyond that

1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:19.600
 and somehow start to chip away

1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:22.440
 at the miracleness of that miracle,

1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:24.720
 that chocolate is delicious?

1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:25.560
 I hope so.

1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:27.680
 I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right now,

1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:32.240
 but I can just say at top level how I would think about that.

1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:33.480
 That would get at this

1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.160
 consciousness without form.

1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:45.160
 This is really tough, because it's consciousness without form

1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:50.200
 versus the various forms that consciousness takes

1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:52.080
 for the experiences that it has.

1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:55.080
 Right, right.

1:54:55.080 --> 1:55:00.080
 So when I write down a probability space

1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:03.320
 for these conscious experiences, I say,

1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:04.280
 here's a probability space

1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:07.080
 for the possible conscious experiences, right?

1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:08.760
 It's just like when I write down a probability space

1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:09.640
 for an experiment.

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.520
 Like I'm gonna flip a coin twice, right?

1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:15.240
 And I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes.

1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:16.400
 So I have to write down a probability space.

1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:18.640
 There could be heads, heads, heads, tails,

1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:20.440
 tails, heads, tails, tails.

1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:24.080
 So any class of probability you're told,

1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:25.400
 write down your probability space.

1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:26.760
 If you don't write down your probability space,

1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:28.200
 you can't get started.

1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.680
 So here's my probability space for consciousness.

1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:33.280
 How do I want to interpret that structure?

1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:34.600
 The structure is just sitting there.

1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:37.560
 There's gonna be a dynamics that happens on it, right?

1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:39.640
 Experiences appear and then they disappear,

1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:42.000
 just like heads appears and disappears.

1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:46.380
 So one way to think about that fundamental

1:55:46.380 --> 1:55:49.480
 probability space is that corresponds

1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:51.280
 to consciousness without any content.

1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.120
 The infinite consciousness that transcends

1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:58.800
 any particular content.

1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:00.600
 Well, do you think of that as a mechanism,

1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:05.520
 as a thing, like the rules that govern the dynamics

1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:08.560
 of the thing outside of space time?

1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.720
 Isn't that, if you think consciousness is fundamental,

1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:12.760
 isn't that essentially getting like,

1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:14.920
 it is solving the hard problem,

1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.920
 which is like from where does this thing pop up,

1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:24.320
 which is the mechanism of the thing popping up,

1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:25.800
 whatever the consciousness is,

1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:29.680
 the different kinds and so on, that mechanism.

1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:34.200
 And also, the question I want to ask is how tricky

1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:38.280
 do you think it is to solve that problem?

1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:40.280
 You've solved a lot of difficult problems

1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:42.080
 throughout the history of humanity.

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.600
 There's probably more problems to solve left

1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:51.520
 than we've solved by like an infinity.

1:56:52.900 --> 1:56:57.140
 But along that long journey of intelligent species,

1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:01.080
 when will we solve this consciousness one?

1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:04.020
 Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.

1:57:04.020 --> 1:57:05.560
 So I'll give two answers.

1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:07.600
 There's one problem I think we can solve,

1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:09.880
 but we haven't solved yet.

1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:11.160
 And that is the reverse

1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:13.720
 of what my colleagues call the hard problem.

1:57:14.900 --> 1:57:17.180
 The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences

1:57:17.180 --> 1:57:19.680
 in the way that I've just described them and the dynamics

1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:21.840
 and build up space and time and brains,

1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:25.120
 that I think is a tough technical problem,

1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.240
 but it's in principle solvable.

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.760
 So I think we can solve that.

1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:29.400
 So we would solve the hard problem,

1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:31.280
 not by showing how brains create consciousness,

1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:33.080
 but how networks of conscious agents

1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.000
 create what we call the symbols that we call brains.

1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.040
 So that I think.

1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:42.160
 But does that allow you to, so that's interesting.

1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:43.480
 That's an interesting idea.

1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:44.720
 Consciousness creates the brain,

1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:46.420
 not the brain creates consciousness.

1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:48.560
 But does that allow you to build the thing?

1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:53.800
 My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies.

1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:55.880
 Once, and I'll tell you why.

1:57:55.880 --> 1:57:57.760
 I think it plugs into the work

1:57:57.760 --> 1:57:58.880
 that the physicists are doing.

1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:01.920
 So this theory of consciousness will be even deeper

1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:03.960
 than the structures that the physicists are finding,

1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:05.160
 like the amplituhedron.

1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:09.300
 But the other answer to your question is less positive.

1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:13.080
 As I said earlier, I think that there is no such thing

1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:14.400
 as a theory of everything.

1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:20.800
 So that I think that the theory that my team is working on,

1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:25.460
 this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory.

1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:29.920
 We're using probability spaces and Markovian curls.

1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:31.800
 I can easily see people now saying,

1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:35.040
 well, we can do better if we go to category theory.

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:38.840
 And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting.

1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:39.780
 And then someone will say,

1:58:39.780 --> 1:58:41.480
 well, now I'll go to topoi theory.

1:58:42.440 --> 1:58:45.600
 So I imagine that there'll be conscious agents,

1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:50.600
 five, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0, but I think it will never end.

1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:54.360
 I think ultimately this question

1:58:54.360 --> 1:58:56.680
 that we sort of put our fingers on of,

1:58:56.680 --> 1:59:01.680
 how does the formless give birth to form,

1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:05.800
 to the wonderful taste of chocolate?

1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:10.200
 I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:11.600
 but we will never solve that.

1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:15.120
 That in some sense, that will be a primitive.

1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.760
 I hope I'm wrong.

1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:21.220
 Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination.

1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:26.000
 So I'll just say my imagination right now

1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.840
 doesn't peer that deep.

1:59:30.280 --> 1:59:31.640
 By the way, I'm saying this,

1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:35.120
 I don't want to discourage some brilliant 20 year old

1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:37.920
 who then later on proves me dead wrong.

1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:39.360
 I hope to be proven dead wrong.

1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:41.040
 Just like you said, essentially from now,

1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:43.320
 everything we're saying now, everything you're saying,

1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:45.600
 all your theories will be laughing stock.

1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:50.600
 They will respect the puzzle solving abilities

1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:54.040
 and how much we were able to do with so little.

1:59:54.040 --> 1:59:58.240
 But outside of that, you will all be just,

1:59:58.240 --> 2:00:01.760
 the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager.

2:00:01.760 --> 2:00:03.120
 Especially the silliness when we thought

2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:06.000
 that we were so smart and we knew it all.

2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.320
 So it would be interesting to explore your ideas

2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:12.560
 by contrasting, you mentioned Annika, Annika Harris,

2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:14.560
 you mentioned Philip Goff.

2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:18.320
 So outside of, if you're not allowed to say

2:00:19.480 --> 2:00:21.640
 the fundamental disagreement is the fact

2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:24.400
 that space time is fundamental.

2:00:24.400 --> 2:00:26.600
 What are interesting distinctions

2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.440
 between ideas of consciousness

2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:30.080
 between you and Annika, for example?

2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:33.360
 You guys have, you've been on a podcast together,

2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:36.600
 I'm sure in private you guys

2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:38.080
 have some incredible conversations.

2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:41.560
 So where are some interesting sticking points,

2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:44.040
 some interesting disagreements,

2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:45.680
 let's say with Annika first.

2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:47.640
 Maybe there'll be a few other people.

2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:49.680
 Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning

2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:51.560
 where we were talking about our ideas

2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:53.800
 and what we discovered really in our conversation

2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:57.040
 was that we're pretty much on the same page.

2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:00.920
 It was really just about consciousness.

2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:02.040
 Our ideas about consciousness

2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:04.040
 are pretty much on the same page.

2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:07.840
 She rightly has cautioned me to,

2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:10.080
 when I talk about conscious agents,

2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:12.000
 to point out that the notion of agency

2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.800
 is not fundamental in my theory.

2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:17.240
 The notion of self is not fundamental

2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:18.880
 and that's absolutely true.

2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:22.520
 I can use this network of conscious agents,

2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:25.000
 I now use as a technical term,

2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:26.400
 conscious agent is a technical term

2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:29.320
 for that probability space with the Markovian dynamics.

2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:31.840
 I can use that to build models of a self

2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:33.240
 and to build models of agency,

2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:35.200
 but they're not fundamental.

2:01:35.200 --> 2:01:40.200
 So she has really been very helpful

2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:43.600
 in helping me to be a little bit clear about these ideas

2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:45.880
 and not say things that are misleading.

2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:50.000
 This is the interesting thing about language, actually,

2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.320
 is that language, quite obviously,

2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.640
 is an interface to truth.

2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:00.400
 It's so fascinating that individual words

2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:05.680
 can have so much ambiguity

2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:10.680
 and the specific choices of a word

2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:12.120
 within a particular sentence,

2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:13.600
 within the context of a sentence,

2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:17.240
 can have such a difference in meaning.

2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:18.600
 It's quite fascinating,

2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:20.360
 especially when you're talking about topics

2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:23.960
 like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term.

2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:26.160
 It means a lot of things to a lot of people

2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:29.120
 and the entire concept is shrouded in mystery.

2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:32.440
 So a combination of the fact that it's a loaded term

2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:34.320
 and that there's a lot of mystery,

2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:36.920
 people can just interpret it in all kinds of ways.

2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:39.160
 And so you have to be both precise

2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:43.640
 and help them avoid getting stuck

2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:48.120
 on some kind of side road of miscommunication,

2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:50.840
 lost in translation because you used the wrong word.

2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:51.680
 That's interesting.

2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:54.380
 I mean, because for a lot of people,

2:02:54.380 --> 2:02:59.100
 consciousness is ultimately connected to a self.

2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:04.920
 I mean, that's our experience of consciousness

2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:08.840
 is very, it's connected to this ego.

2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:12.840
 I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be?

2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:15.760
 I can't even, how do you begin to comprehend,

2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.000
 to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness

2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:22.420
 that's not connected to like this particular organism?

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:26.520
 I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now

2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:29.660
 that comes out of this framework that's different.

2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:34.260
 So we can imagine a dynamics of consciousness,

2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:37.660
 not in space and time, just abstractly.

2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:40.560
 It could be cooperative for all we know.

2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:42.580
 It could be very friendly, I don't know.

2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:46.720
 And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics

2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:48.820
 that is so called stationary.

2:03:48.820 --> 2:03:50.160
 And that's a technical term,

2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:53.400
 which means that the entropy effectively is not increasing.

2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:55.160
 There is some entropy, but it's constant.

2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.960
 So there's no increasing entropy.

2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:00.340
 And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless.

2:04:01.540 --> 2:04:05.620
 There is no entropic time, but it's a trivial theorem,

2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:10.620
 three line proof that if you have a stationary

2:04:10.620 --> 2:04:13.860
 Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make

2:04:13.860 --> 2:04:16.240
 of that dynamics by conditional probability.

2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:17.980
 And if you want, I can state a little bit more,

2:04:17.980 --> 2:04:19.340
 even more mathematically precisely

2:04:19.340 --> 2:04:21.920
 for some readers or listeners.

2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:25.120
 But if any projection you take by conditional probability,

2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:28.980
 the induced image of that Markov chain

2:04:28.980 --> 2:04:30.380
 will have increasing entropy.

2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:34.100
 You will have entropic time.

2:04:34.100 --> 2:04:36.140
 So I'll be very, very precise.

2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:40.740
 I have a Markov chain X1, X2 through Xn

2:04:40.740 --> 2:04:42.540
 where Xn, n goes to infinity, right?

2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:48.800
 The entropy H, capital H of Xn is equal to the entropy H

2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:51.600
 of Xn minus one for all n.

2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.180
 So the entropy is the same.

2:04:55.660 --> 2:05:00.660
 But it's a theorem that H of Xn,

2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:05.660
 say given X sub one is greater than or equal to

2:05:06.100 --> 2:05:09.460
 H of Xn minus one given X1.

2:05:10.900 --> 2:05:13.580
 Sure, where does the greater come from?

2:05:13.580 --> 2:05:15.980
 Because with the theorem, the three line proof,

2:05:17.220 --> 2:05:22.220
 H of Xn given X1 is greater than or equal to H of Xn

2:05:23.940 --> 2:05:27.500
 given X1 and X2 because conditioning reduces.

2:05:27.500 --> 2:05:32.500
 But then H of Xn minus one given X1, X2

2:05:35.340 --> 2:05:39.620
 is equal to H of Xn given X2,

2:05:39.620 --> 2:05:43.080
 Xn minus one given X2 by the Markov property.

2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:49.020
 And then because it's stationary, it's equal to H of X.

2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:53.180
 I have to write it down.

2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:56.820
 Anyway, there's a three line proof.

2:05:56.820 --> 2:06:00.940
 Sure, but the assumption of stationarity,

2:06:02.100 --> 2:06:04.540
 we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand,

2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:05.380
 doesn't matter.

2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:10.220
 So there's some kind of, some Markovian dynamics

2:06:10.220 --> 2:06:13.540
 is basically trying to model some kind of system

2:06:13.540 --> 2:06:15.700
 with some probabilities and there's agents

2:06:15.700 --> 2:06:17.260
 and they interact in some kind of way

2:06:17.260 --> 2:06:19.980
 and you can say something about that system

2:06:19.980 --> 2:06:22.900
 as it evolves stationarity.

2:06:22.900 --> 2:06:27.900
 So a stationary system is one that has certain properties

2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.820
 in terms of entropy, very well.

2:06:30.820 --> 2:06:33.020
 But we don't know if it's stationary or not.

2:06:33.020 --> 2:06:35.520
 We don't know what the properties.

2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:36.500
 Right.

2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:38.220
 So you have to kind of take assumptions

2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:42.040
 and see, okay, well, what does the system behave like

2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:43.580
 under these different properties?

2:06:43.580 --> 2:06:46.340
 The more constraints, the more assumptions you take,

2:06:46.340 --> 2:06:49.900
 the more interesting, powerful things you can say,

2:06:49.900 --> 2:06:52.060
 but sometimes they're limiting.

2:06:52.060 --> 2:06:54.460
 That said, we're talking about consciousness here.

2:06:54.460 --> 2:06:55.980
 Right.

2:06:55.980 --> 2:07:00.980
 How does that, you said cooperative, okay, competitive.

2:07:02.420 --> 2:07:04.140
 It just, I like chocolate.

2:07:04.140 --> 2:07:08.500
 I'm sitting here, I have a brain, I'm wearing a suit.

2:07:08.500 --> 2:07:11.220
 It sure as hell feels like I'm myself.

2:07:11.220 --> 2:07:12.060
 Right.

2:07:12.060 --> 2:07:14.660
 Now, what, am I tuning in?

2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:16.820
 Am I plugging into something?

2:07:16.820 --> 2:07:20.700
 Am I a projection, a simple, trivial projection

2:07:20.700 --> 2:07:23.980
 into space time from some much larger organism

2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:25.980
 that I can't possibly comprehend?

2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:28.020
 How the hell, you're saying some,

2:07:28.020 --> 2:07:31.500
 you're building up mathematical intuitions, fine, great.

2:07:31.500 --> 2:07:35.100
 But I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here

2:07:35.100 --> 2:07:36.700
 and I'm gonna die soon.

2:07:36.700 --> 2:07:37.940
 Well, I'll die pretty quickly.

2:07:37.940 --> 2:07:42.200
 So I wanna figure out why chocolate's so delicious.

2:07:43.300 --> 2:07:44.200
 So help me out here.

2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:47.100
 So let's just keep sneaking up to this.

2:07:47.100 --> 2:07:52.100
 Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this.

2:07:52.500 --> 2:07:56.220
 Even if the dynamics of consciousness is stationary

2:07:56.220 --> 2:07:58.720
 so that there is no entropic time,

2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:02.500
 any projection of it, any view of it

2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:07.440
 will have the artifact of entropic time.

2:08:08.620 --> 2:08:10.860
 That's a limited resource.

2:08:10.860 --> 2:08:14.220
 Limited resources, so that the fundamental dynamics

2:08:14.220 --> 2:08:17.500
 may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever.

2:08:17.500 --> 2:08:19.980
 Any projection will have certainly time

2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:21.180
 as a limited resource

2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:24.140
 and probably lots of other limited resources.

2:08:24.140 --> 2:08:28.140
 Hence, we could get competition and evolution

2:08:28.140 --> 2:08:30.400
 and nature, red and tooth and claw

2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:32.700
 as an artifact of a deeper system

2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:34.600
 in which those aren't fundamental.

2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:37.820
 And in fact, I take it as something

2:08:37.820 --> 2:08:41.020
 that this theory must do at some point

2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:42.740
 is to show how networks of conscious agents,

2:08:42.740 --> 2:08:45.660
 even if they're not resource limited,

2:08:45.660 --> 2:08:47.620
 give rise to evolution by natural selection

2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:49.340
 via a projection.

2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:51.100
 Yeah, but you're saying,

2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:53.260
 I'm trying to understand how the limited resources

2:08:53.260 --> 2:08:54.360
 that give rise to,

2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:57.940
 so first the thing gives rise to time,

2:08:57.940 --> 2:08:59.860
 that gives rise to limited resource,

2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:03.140
 that gives rise to evolution by natural selection,

2:09:03.140 --> 2:09:05.940
 how that has to do with the fact that chocolate's delicious?

2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:08.060
 Well, it's not gonna do that directly.

2:09:08.060 --> 2:09:10.700
 It's gonna get to this notion of self.

2:09:10.700 --> 2:09:12.140
 Oh, it's gonna give you?

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:12.980
 The notion of self.

2:09:12.980 --> 2:09:14.700
 Oh, the evolution gives you the notion of self.

2:09:14.700 --> 2:09:18.420
 And also of a self separate from other selves.

2:09:18.420 --> 2:09:20.140
 So the idea would be that.

2:09:20.140 --> 2:09:22.140
 It's competition, it has life and death,

2:09:22.140 --> 2:09:23.300
 all those kinds of things.

2:09:23.300 --> 2:09:24.140
 That's right.

2:09:24.140 --> 2:09:26.740
 So it won't, I don't think,

2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:28.540
 as I said, I don't think that I can tell you

2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:30.180
 how the formless gives rise

2:09:30.180 --> 2:09:32.380
 to the experience of chocolate.

2:09:32.380 --> 2:09:33.660
 Right now, my current theory says

2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:35.700
 that's one of the miracles I'm assuming.

2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:36.660
 Yeah.

2:09:36.660 --> 2:09:38.180
 So my theory can't do it.

2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:39.260
 And the reason my theory can't do it

2:09:39.260 --> 2:09:41.460
 is because Hoffman's brain can't do it right now.

2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:45.980
 But the notion of self, yes.

2:09:45.980 --> 2:09:49.060
 The notion of self can be an artifact

2:09:49.060 --> 2:09:51.700
 of the projection of it.

2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:53.780
 So there's one conscious agent.

2:09:55.340 --> 2:09:56.780
 Because anytime conscious agents interact,

2:09:56.780 --> 2:09:57.860
 they form a new conscious agent.

2:09:57.860 --> 2:09:59.380
 So there's one conscious agent.

2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:02.620
 Any projection of that one conscious agent

2:10:02.620 --> 2:10:05.060
 gives rise to time,

2:10:05.060 --> 2:10:07.660
 even if there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent.

2:10:07.660 --> 2:10:10.060
 And it gives rise, I want to,

2:10:10.060 --> 2:10:10.900
 now I haven't proven this.

2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:13.220
 So this is, so now this is me guessing

2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:14.820
 where the theory is going to go.

2:10:14.820 --> 2:10:15.660
 I haven't done this.

2:10:15.660 --> 2:10:16.860
 There's no paper on this yet.

2:10:16.860 --> 2:10:18.380
 So now I'm speculating.

2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:20.180
 My guess is I'll be able to show,

2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:22.460
 or my brighter colleagues working with me

2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:23.660
 will be able to show

2:10:23.660 --> 2:10:26.660
 that we will get evolution of a natural selection,

2:10:26.660 --> 2:10:28.260
 the notion of individual selves,

2:10:28.260 --> 2:10:29.940
 individual physical objects and so forth

2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:31.620
 coming out as a projection of this thing.

2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:35.900
 And that the self, this then will be really interesting

2:10:35.900 --> 2:10:37.420
 in terms of how it starts to interact

2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:40.980
 with certain spiritual traditions, right?

2:10:40.980 --> 2:10:44.100
 Where they will say that there is a notion of self

2:10:44.100 --> 2:10:45.540
 that needs to be let go,

2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:46.860
 which is this finite self

2:10:46.860 --> 2:10:48.300
 that's competing with other selves

2:10:48.300 --> 2:10:52.020
 to get more money and prestige and so forth.

2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:54.380
 That self in some sense has to die.

2:10:54.380 --> 2:10:56.460
 But there's a deeper self,

2:10:56.460 --> 2:11:00.580
 which is the timeless being

2:11:01.660 --> 2:11:04.340
 that precludes, not precludes,

2:11:04.340 --> 2:11:08.220
 but precedes any particular conscious experiences,

2:11:08.220 --> 2:11:10.380
 the ground of all experience.

2:11:10.380 --> 2:11:13.660
 That there's that notion of a deep capital self.

2:11:13.660 --> 2:11:17.980
 But our little capital, lowercase s selves

2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:20.820
 could be artifacts of projection.

2:11:20.820 --> 2:11:25.620
 And it may be that what consciousness is doing

2:11:25.620 --> 2:11:26.780
 in this framework is, right?

2:11:26.780 --> 2:11:30.300
 It's projected itself down into a self

2:11:30.300 --> 2:11:31.420
 that calls itself dawn

2:11:31.420 --> 2:11:33.940
 and a self that calls itself lax.

2:11:33.940 --> 2:11:36.020
 And through conversations like this,

2:11:36.020 --> 2:11:37.900
 it's trying to find out about itself

2:11:37.900 --> 2:11:41.180
 and eventually transcend the limits

2:11:41.180 --> 2:11:45.860
 of the dawn and lax little icons that it's using

2:11:45.860 --> 2:11:49.020
 and that little projection of itself.

2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:50.580
 Through this conversation,

2:11:50.580 --> 2:11:53.620
 somehow it's learning about itself.

2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:56.620
 So that thing dressed me up today

2:11:57.700 --> 2:11:59.940
 in order to understand itself.

2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:02.220
 And in some sense, you and I are not separate

2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:03.940
 from that thing and we're not separate from each other.

2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:06.980
 Yeah, well, I have to question the fashion choices

2:12:06.980 --> 2:12:08.500
 on my end then.

2:12:08.500 --> 2:12:10.900
 All right, so you mentioned you agree

2:12:10.900 --> 2:12:15.500
 in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Anika.

2:12:15.500 --> 2:12:20.260
 Is there somebody, friend or friendly foe

2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:25.260
 that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way

2:12:25.540 --> 2:12:28.580
 or some major way about consciousness,

2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:32.640
 about these topics of reality that you return to?

2:12:34.340 --> 2:12:38.660
 Often, it's like Christopher Hitchens

2:12:38.660 --> 2:12:43.460
 with Rabbi David Wolpe have had interesting conversations

2:12:43.460 --> 2:12:46.260
 through years that added to the complexity

2:12:46.260 --> 2:12:47.660
 and the beauty of their friendship.

2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:51.940
 Is there somebody like that that over the years

2:12:51.940 --> 2:12:54.540
 has been a source of disagreement with you

2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:56.180
 that's strengthened your ideas?

2:12:56.180 --> 2:13:01.180
 Hmm, my ideas have been really shaped by several things.

2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:06.600
 One is the physicalist framework

2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:10.460
 that my scientific colleagues, almost to a person,

2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:12.800
 have adopted and that I adopted too.

2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:15.120
 And the reason I walked away from it was

2:13:15.120 --> 2:13:20.120
 because it became clear that we couldn't start

2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:22.880
 with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.

2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:27.880
 Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?

2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:33.120
 So a physicalist, I would say as someone

2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:35.920
 who takes space time and the objects within space time

2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:38.880
 as ontologically fundamental.

2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:42.080
 Right, and then reductionist is saying

2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:43.760
 the smaller, the more fundamental.

2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:45.840
 That's a methodological thing.

2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:47.960
 That's saying within space time,

2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:50.520
 as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space,

2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:53.080
 you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental

2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:57.360
 laws and the reduction of temperature

2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:01.280
 to particle movement was an example of that.

2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:03.960
 But I think that the reason that worked

2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:07.960
 was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.

2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:10.320
 That was for a long time and your colleagues,

2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:12.060
 including yourself, were physicalists

2:14:12.060 --> 2:14:13.480
 and now you broke away.

2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:15.640
 Broke away because I think you can't start

2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:18.400
 with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.

2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:21.200
 And so even with Roger Penrose

2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:23.840
 where there's like a gray area.

2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:26.840
 Right, and here's the challenge I would put

2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:30.000
 to all of my friends and colleagues

2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.080
 who give one specific conscious experience

2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:37.640
 that you can boot up, right?

2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:40.680
 So if you think that it's integrated information

2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:44.120
 and I've asked this of Giulio Tononi a couple times

2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:46.600
 back in the 90s and then just a couple years ago.

2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:49.040
 I asked Giulio, okay, so great, integrated information.

2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:51.560
 So we're all interested in explaining

2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.200
 some specific conscious experiences.

2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:56.880
 So what is, you know, pick one, the taste of chocolate.

2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:00.860
 What is the integrated information precise structure

2:15:00.860 --> 2:15:03.800
 that we need for chocolate and why does that structure

2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:07.360
 have to be for chocolate and why is it

2:15:07.360 --> 2:15:09.280
 that it could not possibly be vanilla?

2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:11.600
 Is there any, I asked him, is there any one specific

2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:13.520
 conscious experience that you can account for?

2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:18.360
 Because notice, they've set themselves the task

2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:21.440
 of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems.

2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:22.880
 That's the task they've set themselves.

2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:25.440
 But that doesn't mean they're,

2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:26.840
 I understand your intuition,

2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:28.280
 but that doesn't mean they're wrong

2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:31.320
 just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet.

2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:32.160
 That's right.

2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:33.000
 No, that doesn't mean that they're wrong.

2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.360
 It just means that they haven't done it.

2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:38.920
 I think it's principled.

2:15:38.920 --> 2:15:40.000
 The reason is principled,

2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:43.060
 but I'm happy that they're exploring it.

2:15:43.060 --> 2:15:45.080
 But the fact is, the remarkable fact is

2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.280
 there's not one theory.

2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:48.400
 So integrated information theory,

2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:51.460
 orchestrated collapse of microtubules,

2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:54.800
 global workspace theory.

2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:56.280
 These are all theories of consciousness.

2:15:56.280 --> 2:15:57.720
 These are all theories of consciousness.

2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:01.040
 There's not a single theory that can give you

2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:03.200
 a specific conscious experience that they say,

2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:06.680
 here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure

2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:08.020
 that must be the taste of chocolate

2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:09.120
 or whatever one they want.

2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:11.180
 So you're saying it's impossible.

2:16:11.180 --> 2:16:13.040
 They're saying it's just hard.

2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:14.320
 Yeah.

2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:18.200
 My attitude is, okay, no one said

2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:20.560
 you had to start with neurons or physical systems

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:21.400
 and boot up consciousness.

2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:22.220
 You guys are just taking that.

2:16:22.220 --> 2:16:23.520
 You chose that problem.

2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:26.080
 So since you chose that problem,

2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:27.320
 how much progress have you made?

2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:30.040
 Well, when you've not been able to come up

2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:32.980
 with a single specific conscious experience

2:16:32.980 --> 2:16:34.520
 and you've had these brilliant people

2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:36.680
 working on it for decades now,

2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:38.360
 that's not really good progress.

2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:41.520
 Let me ask you to play devil's advocate.

2:16:41.520 --> 2:16:46.120
 Can you try to steel man, steel man meaning

2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:49.840
 argue the best possible case for reality?

2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:51.200
 The opposite of your book title.

2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:54.360
 So, or maybe just stick into consciousness.

2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:56.980
 Can you take the physicalist view?

2:16:56.980 --> 2:16:58.780
 Can you steel man the physicalist view

2:16:58.780 --> 2:17:01.760
 for a brief moment playing devil's advocate too?

2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:05.700
 Or steel man the person you used to be?

2:17:05.700 --> 2:17:07.200
 Right, right. She's a physicalist.

2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:10.560
 What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong

2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:15.560
 right now, what would be a convincing argument for that?

2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:21.440
 Well, I think the argument I would give

2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:23.880
 that I believed was, look,

2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:25.920
 when you have very simple physical systems,

2:17:25.920 --> 2:17:28.400
 like a piece of dirt,

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:30.600
 there's not much evidence of life or consciousness.

2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:32.800
 It's only when you get really complicated physical systems

2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:35.120
 like that have brains and really,

2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:36.400
 the more complicated the brains,

2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:39.240
 the more it looks like there's consciousness

2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:41.200
 and the more complicated that consciousness is.

2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:45.220
 Surely that means that simple physical systems

2:17:45.220 --> 2:17:49.000
 don't create much consciousness or if maybe not any,

2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:50.980
 or maybe panpsychists,

2:17:50.980 --> 2:17:52.320
 they create the most elementary kinds

2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:54.120
 of simple conscious experiences,

2:17:54.120 --> 2:17:59.120
 but you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,

2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:02.020
 to create more complicated consciousnesses.

2:18:02.020 --> 2:18:03.080
 I think that's the intuition

2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:04.920
 that drives most of my colleagues.

2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:09.000
 And you're saying that this concept of complexity

2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:13.760
 is ill defined when you ground it to space time.

2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:15.700
 Oh, I think it's well defined

2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:17.440
 within the framework of space time, right?

2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:21.100
 No, it's ill defined relative to what you need

2:18:21.100 --> 2:18:23.240
 to actually understand consciousness

2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:26.280
 because you're grounding complexity in just in space time.

2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:27.640
 Oh, got you, right, right.

2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:32.520
 Yeah, what I'm saying is if it were true

2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:35.560
 that space time was fundamental,

2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:38.040
 then I would have to agree

2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:40.240
 that if there is such a thing as consciousness,

2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:41.400
 given the data that we've got,

2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:45.880
 that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't,

2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:48.620
 that somehow it's the complexity of the dynamics

2:18:48.620 --> 2:18:52.120
 or organization, the function of the physical system

2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:55.080
 that somehow is creating the consciousness.

2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:58.240
 So under those assumptions, yes,

2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:00.040
 but when the physicists themselves are telling us

2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:03.680
 that space time is not fundamental, then I can understand.

2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:07.000
 See, then the whole picture starts to come into focus.

2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:10.000
 Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right?

2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:12.000
 These are really smart people.

2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.080
 I mean, Francis Crick worked on this

2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:15.780
 for the last 20 years of his life.

2:19:16.780 --> 2:19:17.800
 These are not stupid people.

2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:19.680
 These are brilliant, brilliant people.

2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:20.720
 The fact that we've come up

2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:22.980
 with not a single specific conscious experience

2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:25.920
 that we can explain and no hope.

2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:27.480
 There's no one that says, oh, I'm really close.

2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:29.200
 I'll have it for you in a year.

2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.280
 No, there's just like, there's this fundamental gap.

2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:36.360
 So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says,

2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:39.860
 look, he likes the global workspace theory,

2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:41.520
 but he says the last dollop of the theory

2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:44.000
 in which there's something it's like to,

2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:47.160
 he says, we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact.

2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:52.000
 Pinker is brilliant, right?

2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.960
 He understands the state of play

2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:57.360
 on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,

2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:00.880
 starting with physicalist assumptions

2:20:00.880 --> 2:20:02.640
 and then trying to put up consciousness.

2:20:02.640 --> 2:20:04.480
 So you've set yourself the problem.

2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:05.760
 I'm starting with physical stuff

2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:07.880
 that's not conscious.

2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:11.380
 I'm trying to get the taste of chocolate out

2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:14.880
 as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.

2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:16.060
 We've not been able to do that.

2:20:16.060 --> 2:20:18.920
 And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.

2:20:18.920 --> 2:20:21.920
 We may have to just stipulate that last bit.

2:20:21.920 --> 2:20:23.840
 He calls it the last dollop.

2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:27.120
 And just stipulate it as a bare fact of nature

2:20:27.120 --> 2:20:28.440
 that there is something it's like.

2:20:28.440 --> 2:20:30.560
 Well, from my point of view as the physical,

2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:33.040
 the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist

2:20:33.040 --> 2:20:34.520
 was we wouldn't have to stipulate.

2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:36.440
 I was gonna start with the physical stuff

2:20:36.440 --> 2:20:38.800
 and explain where the consciousness came from.

2:20:38.800 --> 2:20:40.680
 If I'm going to stipulate consciousness,

2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:42.600
 why don't I just stipulate consciousness

2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:45.040
 and not stipulate all the physical stuff too?

2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:46.840
 So I'm stipulating less.

2:20:46.840 --> 2:20:47.680
 I'm saying, okay, I agree.

2:20:47.680 --> 2:20:49.520
 Which is the panpsychist perspective.

2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:51.160
 Well, it's actually what I call

2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:52.640
 the conscious realist perspective.

2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:53.760
 Consciousness.

2:20:53.760 --> 2:20:55.880
 Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right?

2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:57.200
 They're saying there's physical stuff

2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:00.040
 that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff.

2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:01.820
 So I would go with Pinker and say, look,

2:21:01.820 --> 2:21:04.080
 let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff,

2:21:04.080 --> 2:21:05.900
 but I'm not gonna stipulate the physical stuff.

2:21:05.900 --> 2:21:08.080
 I'm gonna actually now show how to boot up

2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:11.120
 the physical stuff from just the consciousness stuff.

2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:12.360
 So I'll stipulate less.

2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:15.180
 Is it possible, so if you stipulate less,

2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:20.180
 is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality

2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:25.640
 as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?

2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:27.920
 Is it possible to visualize somehow?

2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:31.000
 With the tools of math, with the tools of computers,

2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:34.600
 with the tools of our mind, are we hopelessly lost?

2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:38.600
 You said there's ways to intuit what's true

2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:44.680
 using mathematics and probability

2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:49.680
 and sort of a Markovian dynamics, all that kind of stuff,

2:21:50.500 --> 2:21:51.920
 but that's not visualizing.

2:21:51.920 --> 2:21:55.880
 That's a kind of building intuition.

2:21:55.880 --> 2:21:57.320
 But is it possible to visualize

2:21:57.320 --> 2:22:00.900
 in the way we visualize so nicely in space time

2:22:00.900 --> 2:22:04.240
 in four dimensions, in three dimensions, sorry.

2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:07.760
 Well, we really are looking through a two dimensional screen

2:22:07.760 --> 2:22:12.720
 until it's what we intuit to be a three dimensional world

2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:17.320
 and also inferring dynamic stuff, making it 4D.

2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:20.520
 Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures

2:22:20.520 --> 2:22:25.520
 that give us a deeper sense of the truth of reality?

2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:29.640
 I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.

2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:33.680
 I think that, for example, the picture that we have

2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:38.440
 of electrons and photons interacting and scattering,

2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:43.360
 it may have not been possible

2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:45.320
 until Faraday did all of his experiments

2:22:45.320 --> 2:22:47.280
 and then Maxwell wrote down his equations.

2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:50.160
 And we were then sort of forced by his equations

2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:51.960
 to think in a new way.

2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:56.760
 And then when Planck in 1900,

2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:00.920
 desperate to try to solve the problem

2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.240
 of black body radiation,

2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:03.840
 what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe

2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:08.320
 where Newton was predicting infinite energies

2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:09.800
 where there weren't infinite energies

2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:11.480
 in black body radiation.

2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:16.480
 And he in desperation proposed packets of energy.

2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:23.080
 Then once you've done that,

2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:25.280
 and then you have an Einstein come along five years later

2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:29.360
 and show how that explains the photoelectric effect.

2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:33.560
 And then eventually in 1926, you get quantum theory.

2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:35.320
 And then you get this whole new way of thinking

2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:38.380
 that was, from the Newtonian point of view,

2:23:38.380 --> 2:23:43.380
 completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly.

2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:47.680
 And maybe if Giesen is right, not contradictory.

2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:50.600
 Maybe if you use intuitionist math, they're not contradictory,

2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:54.440
 but still, certainly you wouldn't have gone there.

2:23:54.440 --> 2:23:57.740
 And so here's a case where the experiments

2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:00.580
 and then a desperate mathematical move,

2:24:01.760 --> 2:24:05.880
 sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog.

2:24:07.160 --> 2:24:12.160
 And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.

2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:16.080
 I wonder if it's still possible to visualize

2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:20.080
 in the, like we talk about consciousness

2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:22.680
 from a self perspective experience it.

2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:25.700
 Hold that idea in our mind,

2:24:25.700 --> 2:24:27.820
 the way you can experience things directly.

2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:32.280
 We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world.

2:24:33.100 --> 2:24:35.960
 And that's a very rich experience.

2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:38.060
 When you're thinking mathematically,

2:24:41.100 --> 2:24:43.820
 you still in the end of the day have to project it down

2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:49.700
 to a low dimensional space to make conclusions.

2:24:49.700 --> 2:24:53.220
 Your conclusions will be a number or a line

2:24:53.220 --> 2:24:56.100
 or a plot or a visual.

2:24:56.100 --> 2:25:00.660
 So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth

2:25:00.660 --> 2:25:03.780
 in a subjective way, like experience it,

2:25:03.780 --> 2:25:05.940
 really feel the beauty of it, you know,

2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:08.580
 in the way that humans feel beauty.

2:25:08.580 --> 2:25:10.980
 Right, are we screwed?

2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:11.820
 I don't think we're screwed.

2:25:11.820 --> 2:25:14.460
 I think that we get little hints of it

2:25:14.460 --> 2:25:17.580
 from psychedelic drugs and so forth.

2:25:17.580 --> 2:25:19.700
 We get hints that there are certain interventions

2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:21.460
 that we can take on our interface.

2:25:21.460 --> 2:25:22.740
 I apply this chemical,

2:25:22.740 --> 2:25:25.980
 which is just some element of my interface

2:25:25.980 --> 2:25:29.780
 to this other, to a brain I ingested.

2:25:29.780 --> 2:25:33.500
 And all of a sudden I seem like I've opened new portals

2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:36.380
 into conscious experiences.

2:25:36.380 --> 2:25:38.360
 Well, that's very, very suggestive.

2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:41.540
 That's like the black body radiation doing something

2:25:41.540 --> 2:25:42.740
 that we didn't expect, right?

2:25:42.740 --> 2:25:44.100
 It doesn't go to infinity

2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:45.460
 when we thought it was gonna go to infinity

2:25:45.460 --> 2:25:49.260
 and we're forced to propose these quanta.

2:25:49.260 --> 2:25:52.180
 So once we have a theory of conscious agents

2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:55.260
 and this projection to space,

2:25:55.260 --> 2:25:57.180
 I should say, I should sketch what I think

2:25:57.180 --> 2:25:58.140
 that projection is.

2:25:59.380 --> 2:26:01.820
 But then I think we can then start

2:26:01.820 --> 2:26:03.540
 to ask specific questions.

2:26:03.540 --> 2:26:08.540
 When you're taking DMT or you're taking LSD

2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:10.780
 or something like that,

2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:12.060
 now that we have this deep model

2:26:12.060 --> 2:26:14.620
 that we've reverse engineered space and time

2:26:14.620 --> 2:26:16.200
 and physical particles,

2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:18.620
 we've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents.

2:26:18.620 --> 2:26:22.080
 Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future,

2:26:23.380 --> 2:26:25.160
 what are we doing to conscious agents

2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:28.280
 when we apply five MEO DMT?

2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:29.900
 What are we doing?

2:26:29.900 --> 2:26:32.300
 Are we opening a new portal, right?

2:26:32.300 --> 2:26:33.780
 So when I say that, I mean,

2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:35.980
 I have a portal into consciousness

2:26:35.980 --> 2:26:39.260
 that I call my body of Lex Friedman that I'm creating.

2:26:39.260 --> 2:26:41.900
 And it's a genuine portal, not perfect,

2:26:41.900 --> 2:26:43.020
 but it's a genuine portal.

2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:45.940
 I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness.

2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:49.340
 And we know that we have one technology

2:26:49.340 --> 2:26:51.440
 for building new portals.

2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:53.780
 We know one technology and that is having kids.

2:26:54.780 --> 2:26:59.220
 Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness.

2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:00.100
 It takes a long time.

2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:01.380
 Can you elaborate that?

2:27:01.380 --> 2:27:04.780
 Oh, oh, oh, you mean like?

2:27:04.780 --> 2:27:07.220
 Your son and your daughter didn't exist.

2:27:07.220 --> 2:27:08.300
 That was a portal.

2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:10.460
 You're having contact with consciousness

2:27:10.460 --> 2:27:12.380
 that you never would have had before,

2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:14.100
 but now you've got a son or a daughter.

2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:16.940
 You went through this physical process,

2:27:16.940 --> 2:27:19.980
 they were born, then there was all the training.

2:27:19.980 --> 2:27:22.780
 But is that portal yours?

2:27:22.780 --> 2:27:25.300
 So when you have kids, are you creating new portals

2:27:25.300 --> 2:27:27.300
 that are completely distinct from the portals

2:27:27.300 --> 2:27:29.300
 that you've created with other consciousness?

2:27:29.300 --> 2:27:31.300
 Like can you elaborate on that?

2:27:31.300 --> 2:27:34.500
 To which degree are the consciousness of your kids

2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:36.440
 a part of you?

2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:39.720
 Well, so every person that I see,

2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:43.080
 that symbol that I see, the body that I see,

2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:46.680
 is a portal potentially for me to interact

2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:48.040
 with a consciousness.

2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:53.600
 And each consciousness has a unique character.

2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:56.240
 We call it a personality and so forth.

2:27:56.240 --> 2:27:59.880
 So with each new kid that's born,

2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:01.960
 we come in contact with a personality

2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:03.700
 that we've never seen before.

2:28:03.700 --> 2:28:05.700
 And a version of consciousness

2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:06.960
 that we've never seen before.

2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:08.640
 At a deeper level, as I said,

2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:10.480
 the theory says there's one agent.

2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:15.240
 So this is a different projection of that one agent.

2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:17.960
 But so that's what I mean by a portal

2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:22.960
 is within my own interface, my own projection,

2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:27.960
 can I see other projections of that one consciousness?

2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:31.960
 So can I get portals in that sense?

2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:36.480
 And I think we will get a theory of that,

2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:38.240
 that we will get a theory of portals

2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:41.480
 and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting.

2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:44.140
 Are they actually creating new portals or not?

2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:47.960
 If they're not, we should nevertheless then understand

2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:50.220
 how we could create a new portal, right?

2:28:50.220 --> 2:28:51.880
 Maybe we have to just study what happens

2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:53.680
 when we have kids.

2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:57.360
 We know that that technology creates new portals.

2:28:57.360 --> 2:28:59.440
 So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,

2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:04.440
 okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo?

2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:09.440
 With something like brain computer interfaces, for example.

2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:10.700
 Yeah, well, maybe just a chemical or something.

2:29:10.700 --> 2:29:12.540
 It's probably more complicated than a chemical.

2:29:12.540 --> 2:29:15.540
 That's why I think that the psychedelics may,

2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:17.460
 because they might be affecting this portal

2:29:17.460 --> 2:29:20.660
 in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up.

2:29:20.660 --> 2:29:22.500
 In other words, maybe once we understand

2:29:22.500 --> 2:29:25.260
 what this thing is a portal, your body is a portal,

2:29:25.260 --> 2:29:26.580
 and understand all of those complexities,

2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:29.180
 maybe we'll realize that that portal can be shifted

2:29:29.180 --> 2:29:32.220
 to different parts of the deeper consciousness

2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:34.420
 and can be used to create new portals.

2:29:34.420 --> 2:29:36.420
 And give new windows on it.

2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:38.860
 And so in that way, maybe yes,

2:29:38.860 --> 2:29:41.180
 psychedelics could open up new portals

2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:42.300
 in the sense that they're taking something

2:29:42.300 --> 2:29:43.740
 that's already a complex portal

2:29:43.740 --> 2:29:45.980
 and just tweaking it a bit.

2:29:45.980 --> 2:29:48.600
 Well, but creating is a very powerful difference

2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:50.540
 between morphing.

2:29:50.540 --> 2:29:52.900
 Right, right, tweaking versus creating, I agree.

2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:55.800
 But maybe it gives you intuition

2:29:55.800 --> 2:29:58.840
 to at least the full space of the kinds of things

2:29:58.840 --> 2:30:01.060
 that this particular system is capable of.

2:30:01.060 --> 2:30:05.100
 I mean, the idea of the consciousness creates brains.

2:30:05.100 --> 2:30:08.540
 I mean, that breaks my brain because,

2:30:08.540 --> 2:30:12.820
 I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense

2:30:12.820 --> 2:30:17.820
 because it's just much easier to intuit the world.

2:30:19.100 --> 2:30:22.860
 It's practical to think there's a neural network

2:30:22.860 --> 2:30:25.660
 and what are the different ways

2:30:25.660 --> 2:30:30.660
 fascinating capabilities can emerge

2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:32.300
 from this neural network.

2:30:33.420 --> 2:30:34.420
 I agree, it's easier.

2:30:34.420 --> 2:30:36.460
 And so you start to,

2:30:36.460 --> 2:30:38.580
 and then present to yourself the problem of,

2:30:38.580 --> 2:30:40.860
 okay, well, how does consciousness arise?

2:30:40.860 --> 2:30:42.940
 How does intelligence arise?

2:30:42.940 --> 2:30:46.580
 How does emotion arise?

2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:49.820
 How does memory arise?

2:30:49.820 --> 2:30:52.580
 How do we filter within the system

2:30:52.580 --> 2:30:54.980
 all the incoming sensory information

2:30:54.980 --> 2:30:57.660
 we're able to allocate attention

2:30:57.660 --> 2:30:58.760
 in different interesting ways?

2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:00.740
 How do all those mechanisms arise?

2:31:02.060 --> 2:31:04.140
 To say that there's other fundamental things

2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:06.580
 we don't understand outside of space time

2:31:06.580 --> 2:31:10.060
 that are actually core to how this whole thing works

2:31:10.060 --> 2:31:14.140
 is a bit paralyzing because it's like,

2:31:14.140 --> 2:31:19.140
 oh, we're not 10% done, we're like 0.001% done.

2:31:20.740 --> 2:31:23.180
 It's the immediate feeling.

2:31:23.180 --> 2:31:24.420
 Certainly understand that.

2:31:24.420 --> 2:31:26.200
 My attitude about it is,

2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:29.760
 if you look at the young physicists

2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:32.600
 who are searching for these structures beyond space time,

2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:34.460
 like amplitude and so forth,

2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:37.360
 they're having a ball.

2:31:38.360 --> 2:31:41.340
 Space time, that's what the old folks did.

2:31:41.340 --> 2:31:44.280
 That's what the older generation did.

2:31:44.280 --> 2:31:48.520
 We're doing something that really is fun and new

2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:51.880
 and they're having a blast

2:31:51.880 --> 2:31:53.840
 and they're finding all these new structures.

2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:56.840
 So I think that we're going to

2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:03.520
 succeed in getting a new deeper theory.

2:32:03.520 --> 2:32:05.220
 I can just say what I'm hoping with the theory

2:32:05.220 --> 2:32:07.880
 that I'm working on, I'm hoping to show

2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:11.000
 that I could have this timeless dynamics of consciousness,

2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:12.720
 no entropic time.

2:32:12.720 --> 2:32:16.240
 I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics

2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:17.680
 looks like the Big Bang

2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:21.840
 and the entire evolution of space time.

2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:25.120
 In other words, I see how my whole space time interface.

2:32:25.120 --> 2:32:28.000
 So not just the projection

2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:29.760
 doesn't just look like space time,

2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:34.440
 you can explain the whole from the origin of the universe.

2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:35.720
 That's what we have to do

2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:37.060
 and that's what the physicists understand.

2:32:37.060 --> 2:32:39.200
 When they go beyond space time to the amplitude heat

2:32:39.200 --> 2:32:41.000
 and the cosmological polytope,

2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:43.200
 they ultimately know that they have to get back

2:32:43.200 --> 2:32:46.600
 the Big Bang story and the whole evolution,

2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:49.380
 that whole story where there were no living things.

2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:53.680
 There was just a point and then the explosion

2:32:53.680 --> 2:32:55.600
 and then just particles at high energy

2:32:55.600 --> 2:32:57.040
 and then eventually the cooling down

2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:01.800
 and the differentiation and finally matter condenses

2:33:01.800 --> 2:33:03.520
 and then life and then consciousness.

2:33:03.520 --> 2:33:05.800
 That whole story has to come out of something

2:33:05.800 --> 2:33:07.840
 that's deeper and without time.

2:33:07.840 --> 2:33:09.680
 And that's what we're up to.

2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:14.480
 So the whole story that we've been telling ourselves

2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:17.140
 about Big Bang and how brains evolved in consciousness

2:33:17.140 --> 2:33:18.720
 will come out of a much deeper theory.

2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:23.520
 And yeah, for someone like me, it's a lot.

2:33:24.680 --> 2:33:28.320
 But for the younger generation, this is like, oh wow,

2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:30.760
 all the low cherries aren't picked.

2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:31.900
 This is really good stuff.

2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:35.400
 This is really new fundamental stuff that we can do.

2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:40.120
 So I can't wait to read the papers of the younger generation

2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:41.940
 and I wanna see them.

2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:46.940
 Kids these days with their non space time assumptions.

2:33:48.980 --> 2:33:51.660
 It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition

2:33:51.660 --> 2:33:53.780
 of this difficult ideas you struggle with.

2:33:53.780 --> 2:33:57.680
 If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant,

2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:00.300
 what are some interesting agreements and disagreements

2:34:00.300 --> 2:34:04.900
 you have with a guy about the nature of reality?

2:34:04.900 --> 2:34:06.880
 So there's a lot in agreement, right?

2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:10.960
 So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist

2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:15.180
 and he basically had the idea

2:34:15.180 --> 2:34:19.340
 that we don't see nature as it is.

2:34:19.340 --> 2:34:21.160
 We impose a structure on nature.

2:34:26.020 --> 2:34:29.060
 And so in some sense, I'm saying something similar.

2:34:29.060 --> 2:34:30.540
 I'm saying that, by the way,

2:34:30.540 --> 2:34:31.660
 I don't call myself an idealist.

2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:33.500
 I call myself a conscious realist

2:34:33.500 --> 2:34:35.620
 because idealism has a long history.

2:34:35.620 --> 2:34:38.420
 A lot of different ideas come under idealism

2:34:38.420 --> 2:34:40.620
 and there's a lot of debates and so forth.

2:34:40.620 --> 2:34:44.540
 It tends to be identified with, in many cases,

2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:46.660
 anti science and anti realism.

2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:49.380
 And I don't want either connection with my ideas

2:34:49.380 --> 2:34:51.540
 and so I just called mine conscious realism

2:34:51.540 --> 2:34:55.460
 with an emphasis on realism and not anti realism.

2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:58.900
 But one place where I would, of course,

2:34:58.900 --> 2:35:00.300
 disagree with Kant was that he thought

2:35:00.300 --> 2:35:05.300
 that Euclidean space time was a priori, right?

2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:07.220
 We just know that that's false.

2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:11.780
 So he went too far on that.

2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:16.220
 But in general, the idea that we don't start with space time,

2:35:16.220 --> 2:35:17.740
 that space and time is in some sense

2:35:17.740 --> 2:35:19.240
 the forms of our perceptions.

2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:20.420
 Yes, absolutely.

2:35:21.540 --> 2:35:25.660
 And I would say that there's a lot in common

2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:27.300
 with Berkeley in that regard.

2:35:28.820 --> 2:35:31.740
 There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Berkeley.

2:35:31.740 --> 2:35:36.740
 Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly

2:35:36.740 --> 2:35:38.860
 that the hard problem was not solvable.

2:35:38.860 --> 2:35:41.900
 He posed the hard problem and basically dismissed it.

2:35:41.900 --> 2:35:43.740
 He just said, you can't do this.

2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:47.100
 And so if he came here and saw where we are,

2:35:47.100 --> 2:35:50.100
 he said, look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago.

2:35:50.100 --> 2:35:51.300
 And he had his monodology.

2:35:51.300 --> 2:35:53.900
 He was trying to do something like,

2:35:53.900 --> 2:35:56.980
 it's different from what I'm doing,

2:35:56.980 --> 2:35:59.100
 but he had these things that were not in space and time,

2:35:59.100 --> 2:36:00.420
 these monads.

2:36:00.420 --> 2:36:02.220
 He was trying to build something.

2:36:03.300 --> 2:36:05.300
 I'm trying to build a theory of conscious agents.

2:36:05.300 --> 2:36:08.460
 My guess is that if he came here,

2:36:08.460 --> 2:36:10.500
 I could just, if he saw what I was doing,

2:36:10.500 --> 2:36:13.100
 he would say, he would understand it

2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:15.300
 and immediately take off with it

2:36:15.300 --> 2:36:17.500
 and go places that I couldn't.

2:36:17.500 --> 2:36:19.780
 He would have no problem with this.

2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:22.860
 Right, there would be overlap of the spirit

2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:25.460
 of the ideas would be totally overlapping.

2:36:25.460 --> 2:36:26.860
 But his genius would then just run with it

2:36:26.860 --> 2:36:28.060
 far faster than I could.

2:36:28.060 --> 2:36:29.820
 I love the humility here.

2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:32.620
 So let me ask you about sort of practical implications

2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:36.460
 of your ideas to our world, our complicated world.

2:36:36.460 --> 2:36:38.780
 When you look at the big questions of humanity,

2:36:38.780 --> 2:36:43.780
 of hate, war, what else is there?

2:36:46.820 --> 2:36:51.500
 Evil, maybe there's the positive aspects of that,

2:36:51.500 --> 2:36:53.380
 of meaning, of love.

2:36:54.700 --> 2:36:59.700
 What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived?

2:36:59.700 --> 2:37:04.700
 What is the conscious realism when applied to daily life?

2:37:07.500 --> 2:37:09.300
 What kind of impact does it have?

2:37:09.300 --> 2:37:12.320
 A lot, and it's sort of scary.

2:37:15.460 --> 2:37:17.260
 We all know that life is ephemeral

2:37:18.300 --> 2:37:21.060
 and spiritual traditions have said wake up to the fact

2:37:21.060 --> 2:37:24.500
 that anything that you do here is going to disappear.

2:37:24.500 --> 2:37:27.960
 But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought.

2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:30.900
 I see this bottle because I create it right now.

2:37:30.900 --> 2:37:33.660
 As soon as I look away,

2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:36.060
 that data structure has been garbage collected.

2:37:36.060 --> 2:37:38.860
 That bottle, I have to recreate it every time I look.

2:37:38.860 --> 2:37:41.260
 So I spend all my money and I buy this fancy car.

2:37:42.220 --> 2:37:44.380
 That car, I have to keep recreating it

2:37:44.380 --> 2:37:45.200
 every time I look at it.

2:37:45.200 --> 2:37:46.540
 It's that ephemeral.

2:37:46.540 --> 2:37:50.200
 So all the things that we invest ourselves in,

2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:52.300
 we fight over, we kill each other over,

2:37:52.300 --> 2:37:55.820
 we have wars over, these are all,

2:37:55.820 --> 2:37:59.420
 it's like people in a virtual reality simulation, right?

2:37:59.420 --> 2:38:03.800
 And there's this Porsche and we all see the Porsche.

2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:07.100
 Well, that Porsche exists when I look at it.

2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:09.080
 I turn my headset and I look at it.

2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:12.220
 And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,

2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:13.260
 he'll see his Porsche.

2:38:13.260 --> 2:38:15.260
 It's not even the same Porsche that I see.

2:38:15.260 --> 2:38:16.760
 He's creating his own Porsche.

2:38:17.780 --> 2:38:20.460
 So these things are exceedingly ephemeral.

2:38:20.460 --> 2:38:25.460
 And now just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.

2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:29.380
 Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche,

2:38:29.380 --> 2:38:32.900
 but really the Porsche only exists as long as you look.

2:38:32.900 --> 2:38:34.640
 So this all of a sudden,

2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:36.600
 what the spiritual traditions have been saying

2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:38.220
 for a long, long time,

2:38:38.220 --> 2:38:41.380
 this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science.

2:38:41.380 --> 2:38:43.380
 It's saying ephemeral, yes.

2:38:43.380 --> 2:38:45.900
 In fact, it lasts for a few milliseconds,

2:38:45.900 --> 2:38:47.460
 a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it.

2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:48.740
 And then it's gone.

2:38:48.740 --> 2:38:53.740
 So the whole idea, why are we fighting?

2:38:53.740 --> 2:38:55.100
 Why do we hate?

2:38:57.740 --> 2:38:59.820
 We fight over possessions

2:39:01.660 --> 2:39:05.200
 because we think that we're small little objects

2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:07.820
 inside this preexisting space time.

2:39:07.820 --> 2:39:11.220
 We assume that that mansion and that car

2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:12.980
 exists independent of us.

2:39:12.980 --> 2:39:16.060
 And that somehow we, these little things

2:39:16.060 --> 2:39:19.540
 can have our sense of self and importance

2:39:19.540 --> 2:39:21.060
 enhanced by having that special car

2:39:21.060 --> 2:39:23.720
 or that special house or that special person.

2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:26.980
 When in fact, it's just the opposite.

2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:29.540
 You create that mansion every time you look.

2:39:29.540 --> 2:39:32.980
 That's, you're something far deeper than that mansion.

2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:37.140
 You're the entity which can create that mansion on the fly.

2:39:37.140 --> 2:39:39.860
 And there's nothing to the mansion

2:39:39.860 --> 2:39:41.660
 except what you create in this moment.

2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:45.600
 So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view,

2:39:46.780 --> 2:39:49.540
 it has all sorts of implications

2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:51.620
 for how we interact with each other,

2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:53.880
 how we treat each other.

2:39:57.260 --> 2:39:58.740
 And again, a lot of things

2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:02.500
 that spiritual traditions have said, it's a mixed bag.

2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:03.740
 Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag.

2:40:03.740 --> 2:40:05.100
 So let me just be right up front about that.

2:40:05.100 --> 2:40:06.780
 I'm not promoting any particular,

2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:08.380
 but they do have some insights.

2:40:08.380 --> 2:40:09.540
 Yeah, they have wisdom.

2:40:09.540 --> 2:40:10.460
 They have certain wisdom.

2:40:10.460 --> 2:40:12.220
 They have, I can point to nonsense.

2:40:12.220 --> 2:40:13.060
 I won't go into it,

2:40:13.060 --> 2:40:14.500
 but I can also point to lots of nonsense.

2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:19.340
 So the issue is to then to look for the key insights.

2:40:19.340 --> 2:40:21.620
 And I think they have a lot of insights

2:40:21.620 --> 2:40:25.580
 about the ephemeral nature of objects in space and time

2:40:25.580 --> 2:40:28.820
 and not being attached to them, including our own bodies.

2:40:28.820 --> 2:40:31.680
 And reversing that I'm not this little thing,

2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:33.700
 a little consciousness trapped in the body.

2:40:33.700 --> 2:40:36.080
 And the consciousness itself is only a product of the body.

2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:38.900
 So when the body dies, the consciousness disappears.

2:40:38.900 --> 2:40:40.700
 It turns completely around.

2:40:40.700 --> 2:40:42.360
 The consciousness is fundamental.

2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:46.420
 The body, my hand exists right now

2:40:46.420 --> 2:40:47.940
 because I'm looking at it.

2:40:47.940 --> 2:40:49.780
 My hand is gone.

2:40:49.780 --> 2:40:50.660
 I have no hand.

2:40:50.660 --> 2:40:52.140
 I have no brain.

2:40:52.140 --> 2:40:53.220
 I have no heart.

2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:55.400
 If you looked, you'll see a heart.

2:40:55.400 --> 2:41:00.100
 Whatever I am is this really complicated thing

2:41:00.100 --> 2:41:01.240
 in consciousness.

2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:02.420
 That's what I am.

2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:05.660
 All the stuff that I thought I was

2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:07.580
 is something that I create on the fly and delete.

2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:11.940
 So this is completely radical restructuring

2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:16.940
 of how we think about possessions, about identity,

2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:20.420
 about survival of death and so forth.

2:41:20.420 --> 2:41:22.740
 This is completely transformative.

2:41:22.740 --> 2:41:24.860
 But the nice thing is that this whole approach

2:41:24.860 --> 2:41:27.660
 of conscious agents, unlike the spiritual traditions,

2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:30.660
 which have said in some cases similar things,

2:41:30.660 --> 2:41:32.020
 they've said it imprecisely.

2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:34.900
 This is mathematics.

2:41:34.900 --> 2:41:38.260
 We can actually now begin to state precisely,

2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:40.140
 here's the mathematical model of consciousness,

2:41:40.140 --> 2:41:42.400
 conscious agents, here's how it maps onto space time,

2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:44.620
 which I should sketch really briefly.

2:41:44.620 --> 2:41:49.620
 And here's why things are ephemeral

2:41:50.380 --> 2:41:52.700
 and here's why you shouldn't be worried

2:41:52.700 --> 2:41:54.060
 about the ephemeral nature of things

2:41:54.060 --> 2:41:57.340
 because you're not a little tiny entity

2:41:57.340 --> 2:41:59.940
 inside space and time, quite the opposite.

2:41:59.940 --> 2:42:02.280
 You're the author of space and time.

2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:04.700
 The I and the am and the I am

2:42:04.700 --> 2:42:07.300
 is all kind of emerging through this whole process

2:42:07.300 --> 2:42:12.300
 of evolution and so on that's just surface waves

2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:13.740
 and there's a much deeper ocean

2:42:13.740 --> 2:42:15.300
 that we're trying to figure out here.

2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:18.220
 So how does, you said some of the stuff

2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:19.860
 you're thinking about maps to space time,

2:42:19.860 --> 2:42:21.500
 how does it map to space time?

2:42:21.500 --> 2:42:25.240
 So just a very, very high level and I'll keep it brief.

2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:28.180
 The structures that the physicists are finding,

2:42:28.180 --> 2:42:31.100
 like the amplituhedron, it turns out

2:42:31.100 --> 2:42:34.340
 they're just static structure, they're polytopes.

2:42:34.340 --> 2:42:37.940
 But they, remarkably, most of the information in them

2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:40.480
 is contained in permutation matrices.

2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.480
 So it's a matrix, like an end by end matrix

2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:47.160
 that just has zeros and ones.

2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:51.920
 That contains almost all of the information

2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:54.160
 and you can, they have these plebic graphs

2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:56.800
 and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering.

2:42:56.800 --> 2:42:59.000
 You can compute those scattering amplitudes

2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:02.120
 almost entirely from these permutation matrices.

2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:07.200
 So that's just, now from my point of view,

2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:09.360
 I have this conscious agent dynamics.

2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:12.020
 It turns out that the stationary dynamics

2:43:12.020 --> 2:43:13.720
 that I was talking about,

2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:15.880
 where the entropy isn't increasing,

2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:19.720
 all the stationary dynamics are sketched out

2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:22.420
 by permutation matrices.

2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:27.680
 So there's so called Burkhoff polytope.

2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:29.800
 All the vertices of this polytope,

2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:33.280
 all the points are permutation matrices.

2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:37.440
 All the internal points are Markovian kernels

2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:42.440
 that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.

2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:44.320
 Now I need to intuit a little better

2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:46.000
 what the heck you're talking about.

2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.680
 So basically, there's some complicated thing

2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:54.560
 going on with the network of conscious agents

2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:56.560
 and that's mappable to this,

2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:58.560
 you're saying a two dimensional matrix

2:43:58.560 --> 2:44:02.040
 that scattering has to do with what?

2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:05.320
 With our perception, like that's like photon stuff?

2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:06.520
 I mean, I don't know if it's useful

2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:09.640
 to sort of dig into detail.

2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:11.000
 I'll do just the high level thing.

2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:11.880
 Yes.

2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:15.520
 So the high level is the long term behavior

2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:17.000
 of the conscious agent dynamics.

2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:18.380
 So that's the projection of just looking

2:44:18.380 --> 2:44:19.800
 at the long term behavior.

2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:23.820
 I'm hoping we'll give rise to the amplituhedron.

2:44:23.820 --> 2:44:27.720
 The amplituhedron then gives rise to space time.

2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:29.860
 So then I can just use their link

2:44:29.860 --> 2:44:31.140
 to go all the way from consciousness

2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:33.440
 through its asymptotics to,

2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:35.280
 through the amplituhedron into space time

2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.880
 and get the map all the way into our interface.

2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:39.640
 And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix

2:44:39.640 --> 2:44:42.440
 because it gives you a nice thing to try to generate.

2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:44.480
 That's right, it's the connection with the amplituhedron.

2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:47.440
 The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron

2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:49.120
 and it turns out they're the core

2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:52.280
 of the asymptotic description of the conscious agents.

2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:54.820
 So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,

2:44:54.820 --> 2:44:57.840
 but I like, first of all, I like video games

2:44:57.840 --> 2:45:01.140
 and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.

2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:03.120
 First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea,

2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:06.440
 this thought experiment that will live in a simulation?

2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:09.520
 And in general, do you think we'll live in a simulation?

2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:14.320
 So the Nick Bostrom's idea about the simulation

2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:17.920
 is typically couched in a physicalist framework.

2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:18.840
 Yes.

2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:21.000
 So there is the bottom level,

2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.280
 there's some programmer in a physical space time

2:45:24.280 --> 2:45:25.760
 and they have a computer that they've programmed

2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:29.740
 really cleverly where they've created conscious entities.

2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:32.720
 So you have the hard problem of consciousness, right?

2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:33.560
 The standard hard problem.

2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:36.680
 How could a computer simulation create a conscious,

2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:39.120
 which isn't explained by that simulation theory.

2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:41.120
 But then the idea is that the next level,

2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:46.120
 the entities that are created in the first level simulation

2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:48.120
 then can write their own simulations

2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:49.440
 and you get this nesting.

2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:55.440
 So the idea that this is a simulation is fine,

2:45:55.780 --> 2:45:58.600
 but the idea that it starts with a physicalist base,

2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:00.120
 I think, isn't fine.

2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:01.880
 Well, there's different properties here.

2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:06.880
 The partial rendering, and to me that's the interesting idea

2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.360
 is not whether the entirety of the universe is simulated,

2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:15.360
 but how efficiently can you create interfaces

2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:21.840
 that are convincing to all other entities

2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:24.080
 that can appreciate such interfaces?

2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:25.920
 How little does it take?

2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:27.920
 Because you said like partial rendering

2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:31.800
 or like temporal, ephemeral rendering of stuff.

2:46:31.800 --> 2:46:33.920
 Only render the tree falling in the forest

2:46:33.920 --> 2:46:36.340
 when there's somebody there to see it.

2:46:36.340 --> 2:46:38.240
 It's interesting to think,

2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:39.760
 how can you do that super efficiently

2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:41.360
 without having to render everything?

2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:44.440
 And that to me is one perspective on the simulation,

2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:46.720
 just like it is with video games,

2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:48.240
 where a video game doesn't have to render

2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:49.480
 every single thing.

2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:52.300
 It's just the thing that the observer is looking at.

2:46:52.300 --> 2:46:55.600
 Right, there is actually, that's a very nice question.

2:46:55.600 --> 2:46:58.080
 And there's whole groups of researchers

2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:00.660
 that are actually studying in virtual reality,

2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:05.660
 what is the sort of minimal requirements on the system?

2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:07.760
 How does it have to operate

2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:09.840
 to give you an immersion experience,

2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:12.600
 to give you the feeling that you have a body,

2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:14.240
 to get you to take it real?

2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:15.960
 And there's actually a lot of really good work

2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:16.800
 on that right now.

2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:18.160
 And it turns out it doesn't take that much.

2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:21.600
 You do need to get the perception action loop tight

2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:25.080
 and you have to give them the perceptions

2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:26.960
 that they're expecting if you want them to.

2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:30.080
 But if you can lead them along,

2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:31.160
 if you give them perceptions

2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:32.320
 that are close to what they're expecting,

2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:35.480
 you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.

2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:36.960
 Yeah, it's a tricky engineering problem,

2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:39.340
 especially when you're trying to create a product

2:47:39.340 --> 2:47:41.240
 that costs little, but that's,

2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:43.000
 it feels like an engineering problem,

2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:44.600
 not a deeply scientific problem.

2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:47.660
 Or meaning, obviously it's a scientific problem,

2:47:47.660 --> 2:47:49.040
 but as a scientific problem,

2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:53.320
 it's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes.

2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:56.440
 But here's a case for just us, you know, our own,

2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.520
 if this is a virtual reality

2:47:57.520 --> 2:47:58.520
 that we're experiencing right now.

2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:01.680
 So here's something you can try for yourself.

2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:03.040
 If you just close your eyes

2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:08.720
 and look at your experience in front of you,

2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:09.880
 be aware of your experience in front of you,

2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:14.000
 what you experience is just like a modeled dark gray,

2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:15.920
 where there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it,

2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:17.620
 but it's just dark gray.

2:48:17.620 --> 2:48:21.740
 But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward,

2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:24.320
 put your attention backward.

2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:29.320
 What is it like behind you with your eyes closed?

2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:32.600
 And there, it's like nothing.

2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:35.420
 It's real.

2:48:35.420 --> 2:48:37.920
 So what is going on here?

2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:41.640
 What am I experiencing back there?

2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:44.960
 Right?

2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:47.160
 Well, it's, I don't know if it's nothing.

2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:49.800
 It's like, I guess it's the absence of,

2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:51.800
 it's not even like darkness or something.

2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:53.560
 It's not even darkness.

2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:58.560
 There's no qualia to it.

2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:01.160
 And yet there is a sense of being.

2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:02.080
 And that's the interesting thing.

2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:03.580
 There's a sense of being back.

2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:06.760
 So I close my, when I put my attention forward,

2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:08.900
 I have the qualia of a gray model thing.

2:49:08.900 --> 2:49:10.380
 But when I put my attention backward,

2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:13.440
 there's no qualia at all, but there is a sense of being.

2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:14.400
 Yeah.

2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:18.560
 I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room.

2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:20.040
 I have been to that side of the room.

2:49:20.040 --> 2:49:25.040
 So for me, memories, I start playing the engine

2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:29.680
 of memory replay, which is like,

2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:32.880
 I take myself back in time and think about that place

2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:34.560
 where I was hanging out in that part.

2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:35.800
 That's where I see what I'm behind.

2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:38.720
 So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,

2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:41.200
 we're able to, we're collecting these experiences

2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:43.080
 and we can replay them in interesting ways

2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:44.320
 whenever we feel like it.

2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:46.640
 And it's almost like being there,

2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:49.160
 but not really, but almost.

2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:50.480
 That's right.

2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:53.160
 And yet we can go our entire lives in this.

2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:54.720
 You're talking about the minimal thing for VR.

2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:56.720
 We can go our entire lives and not realize

2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:01.720
 that all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me.

2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:03.600
 Yeah, right.

2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:06.280
 We're not even aware that all of our lives,

2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:10.640
 if you just pay attention to us behind me,

2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:13.280
 we're like, oh, holy smoke, it's totally scary.

2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:14.720
 I mean, it's like nothing.

2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.120
 There's no qualia there at all.

2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:18.360
 How did I not notice that my entire life?

2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:21.280
 We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.

2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:24.840
 Yeah, I mean, you could see this with children, right?

2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:28.400
 Though with persistence, you could do the peekaboo game.

2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:32.040
 You can hide from them and appear and they're fully tricked.

2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:34.760
 And in the same way, we're fully tricked.

2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:37.800
 There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.

2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:39.320
 And that's really interesting.

2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:41.240
 These theories are pretty heavy.

2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:46.640
 You as a human being, as a mortal human being,

2:50:46.640 --> 2:50:49.920
 how has these theories been to you personally?

2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:51.720
 Like, are there good days and bad days

2:50:51.720 --> 2:50:54.120
 when you wake up and look in the mirror

2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:57.760
 and the fact that you can't see anything behind you?

2:50:57.760 --> 2:50:58.800
 The fact that it's rendered,

2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:00.700
 like, is there interesting quirks?

2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:05.240
 Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss,

2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:06.880
 the abyss gazes into you.

2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:10.240
 How has these theories, these ideas,

2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:12.040
 changed you as a person?

2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:15.440
 It's been very, very difficult.

2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:19.760
 And this stuff is not just abstract theory building

2:51:19.760 --> 2:51:21.760
 because it's about us.

2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:24.200
 Sometimes I realize that there's this big division in me.

2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:26.600
 My mind is doing all this science

2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:28.520
 and coming up with these conclusions

2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.000
 and the rest of me is not integrating.

2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:31.600
 I'm just like, I don't believe it.

2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:32.440
 I just don't believe this.

2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:35.920
 I mean, it seems, so as I start to take it seriously,

2:51:35.920 --> 2:51:37.000
 I get scared myself.

2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:41.040
 It's like, but it's very much,

2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:43.000
 then I read these spiritual traditions

2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.100
 and realize they're saying very, very similar things.

2:51:45.100 --> 2:51:48.120
 Like, there's a lot of convergence.

2:51:48.120 --> 2:51:51.240
 So for me, I have,

2:51:52.800 --> 2:51:55.680
 the first time I thought it might be possible

2:51:55.680 --> 2:51:59.840
 that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986.

2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:02.580
 It was from some mathematics we were doing.

2:52:02.580 --> 2:52:05.920
 And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks.

2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:06.760
 I had to sit down.

2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:11.200
 It was, it really, it was scary.

2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:14.000
 It was really a shock to the system.

2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.560
 And then to realize that everything

2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:18.080
 that has been important to me,

2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:21.360
 like, you know, getting a house,

2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:25.200
 getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.

2:52:26.500 --> 2:52:28.760
 Well, that car is just like the car I see

2:52:28.760 --> 2:52:29.640
 in the virtual reality.

2:52:29.640 --> 2:52:32.600
 It's just there when you perceive it and it's not there.

2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:35.260
 So the whole question of, you know,

2:52:35.260 --> 2:52:36.560
 what am I doing and why?

2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:39.440
 What's worthwhile doing in life?

2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:44.440
 Clearly, getting a big house and getting a big car.

2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:48.160
 I mean, we all knew that we were gonna die.

2:52:48.160 --> 2:52:50.500
 So we tend not to know that.

2:52:50.500 --> 2:52:52.720
 We tend to hide it, especially when we're young.

2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:54.680
 Before age 30, we don't believe we're gonna die.

2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:58.080
 But we factually maybe know that you kind of

2:52:58.080 --> 2:52:59.440
 are supposed to, yeah.

2:52:59.440 --> 2:53:02.180
 But they'll figure something out and we'll be the generation

2:53:02.180 --> 2:53:04.240
 that is the first one that doesn't have to die.

2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:05.180
 That's the kind of thing.

2:53:05.180 --> 2:53:09.420
 But when you really face the fact that you're going to die,

2:53:11.440 --> 2:53:13.360
 and then when I start to look at it from this point of view

2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:16.460
 that, well, this thing was an interface to begin with.

2:53:16.460 --> 2:53:20.180
 So what I'm really, is what I'm really gonna be doing,

2:53:20.180 --> 2:53:21.600
 just taking off a headset.

2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:24.160
 So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day

2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:27.700
 and I got lost in the game and I was fighting over a Porsche.

2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:31.440
 And I shot some guys up and I punctured their tires

2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:33.000
 and I got the Porsche.

2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.120
 Now I take the headset off and what was that for?

2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:37.680
 Nothing, it was just, it was a data structure

2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:39.080
 and the data structure is gone.

2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:42.960
 So all of the wars, the fighting and the reputations

2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:46.960
 and all this stuff, it's just a headset.

2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:52.520
 So my theory says that intellectually,

2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:57.520
 my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.

2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:02.200
 It's like I, you know, and so I have to meditate.

2:54:02.200 --> 2:54:03.480
 I meditate a lot.

2:54:03.480 --> 2:54:06.320
 What percent of the day would you say you spend

2:54:06.320 --> 2:54:11.040
 as a physicalist sort of living life,

2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:16.040
 pretending your car matters, your reputation matters?

2:54:16.840 --> 2:54:19.580
 Like how much, what's that Tom Waits song,

2:54:19.580 --> 2:54:22.480
 I like my town with a little drop of poison.

2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:25.780
 How much poison do you allow yourself to have?

2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:27.840
 I think my default mode is physicalist.

2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:29.640
 I think that that's just the default.

2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:35.800
 When I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive.

2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:39.000
 Then intellectually consciously attentive,

2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:40.820
 because if you're just, you're still,

2:54:40.820 --> 2:54:43.160
 if you're tasting coffee and not thinking

2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:45.560
 or drinking or just taking in the sunset,

2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:47.440
 you're not being intellectual,

2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:49.480
 but you're still experiencing it.

2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:53.660
 So it's when you turn on the introspective machine,

2:54:53.660 --> 2:54:54.960
 that's when you can start.

2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:56.840
 And turn off the thinker,

2:54:56.840 --> 2:54:59.860
 when I actually just start looking without thinking.

2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:03.800
 So that's when I feel like I,

2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:06.840
 all of a sudden I'm starting to see through.

2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:11.840
 Sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface

2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:14.800
 is all the stories I'm telling about it.

2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:15.960
 It's really important for me to get that,

2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:18.040
 really important to do that.

2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:20.880
 So I'm telling all these stories and so I'm all wrapped up.

2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:24.400
 Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head

2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:28.720
 is about attachment to the interface.

2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.720
 And so what I found is that the,

2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:37.400
 essentially the only way to really detach

2:55:37.400 --> 2:55:42.320
 from the interface is to literally let go

2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:44.360
 of thoughts altogether.

2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:49.200
 And then all of a sudden, even my identity,

2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:52.040
 my whole history, my name, my education,

2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:54.760
 all this stuff is almost irrelevant

2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:59.480
 because it's just now here is the present moment.

2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:03.840
 And this is the reality right now.

2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:07.160
 And all of that other stuff is an interface story.

2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.520
 But this conscious experience right now,

2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:14.260
 this is the only reality as far as I can tell.

2:56:14.260 --> 2:56:15.560
 The rest of it's a story.

2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:20.620
 But that is, again, not my default.

2:56:20.620 --> 2:56:25.320
 That is, I have to make a really conscious choice

2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:28.400
 to say, okay, I know intellectually

2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:30.440
 this is all an interface.

2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:33.560
 I'm gonna take the headset off and so forth.

2:56:33.560 --> 2:56:36.540
 And then immediately sink back into the game

2:56:36.540 --> 2:56:39.760
 and just be out there playing the game and get lost in it.

2:56:39.760 --> 2:56:41.520
 So I'm always lost in the game

2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:46.520
 unless I literally consciously choose to stop thinking.

2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:50.840
 Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge

2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:55.200
 that, to look beyond the game?

2:56:56.240 --> 2:56:57.680
 Isn't it?

2:56:57.680 --> 2:56:59.800
 It scares the hell out of me.

2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:03.400
 It really is scary because I'm so attached.

2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:04.480
 I'm attached to this body.

2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:05.560
 I'm attached to the interface.

2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:09.840
 Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit?

2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:14.840
 Meaning like, it's, I mean, some of these ideas,

2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:17.360
 some of these ideas, when you think about reality,

2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:21.280
 even with like Einstein, just realizing,

2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:25.100
 you said interface, just realizing that light,

2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:28.160
 that there's a speed of light

2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:29.880
 and you can't go faster than the speed of light

2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:34.680
 and what kind of things black holes can do with light,

2:57:34.680 --> 2:57:37.080
 even that can mess with your head.

2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.160
 Yes.

2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:41.040
 But that's still space time.

2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:42.760
 That's a big mess, but it's still just space time.

2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:44.760
 It's still a property of our interface.

2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:45.600
 That's right.

2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:49.880
 But it's still like, even Einstein realized

2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:51.480
 that this particular thing,

2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:53.000
 some of the stories we tell ourselves

2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:56.040
 is constructing interfaces

2:57:56.040 --> 2:57:59.440
 that are oversimplifying the way things work

2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:01.640
 because it's nice.

2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:03.640
 The stories are nice.

2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:04.920
 Stories are nice.

2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:07.880
 I mean, just like video games, they're nice.

2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:10.200
 Right, but Einstein was a realist, right?

2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:12.160
 He was a famous realist in the sense

2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:15.160
 that he was very explicit in a 1935 paper

2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:18.280
 with Podolsky and Rosen, the EPR paper, right?

2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:24.680
 They said, if without in any way disturbing a system,

2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:28.640
 I can predict with probability one,

2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:30.040
 the outcome of a measurement,

2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:35.960
 then there exists in reality that element, right?

2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:39.360
 That value that, and we now know from quantum theory

2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:41.000
 that that's false.

2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:46.000
 Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.

2:58:46.600 --> 2:58:47.440
 Yeah.

2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:50.400
 And so we can predict, we can set up,

2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:52.320
 in quantum theory, you can set up,

2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:55.960
 and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism,

2:58:55.960 --> 2:58:58.040
 where he scouts this out.

2:58:58.040 --> 2:58:58.880
 It was done by other people,

2:58:58.880 --> 2:59:00.840
 but he gives a good presentation of this,

2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:02.360
 where they have a sequence of something

2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:05.640
 like nine different quantum measurements that you can make.

2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:08.160
 And you can predict with probability one

2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:10.000
 what a particular outcome will be,

2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:14.880
 but you can actually prove that it's impossible

2:59:14.880 --> 2:59:18.200
 that the value existed before you made the measurement.

2:59:18.200 --> 2:59:20.240
 So you know with probability one what you're gonna get,

2:59:20.240 --> 2:59:22.480
 but you also know with certainty

2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:23.560
 that that value was not there

2:59:23.560 --> 2:59:25.320
 until you made the measurement.

2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:27.480
 So we know from quantum theory

2:59:27.480 --> 2:59:31.120
 that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:35.160
 And that is built into what I'm saying

2:59:35.160 --> 2:59:36.720
 with this theory of consciousness.

2:59:36.720 --> 2:59:38.960
 If consciousness is fundamental,

2:59:38.960 --> 2:59:42.240
 space time itself is an act of fact creation.

2:59:42.240 --> 2:59:44.840
 It's an interface that we create, consciousness creates,

2:59:44.840 --> 2:59:46.040
 plus all the objects in it.

2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:48.920
 So local realism is not true.

2:59:50.280 --> 2:59:51.840
 Quantum theory has established that.

2:59:51.840 --> 2:59:54.600
 Also noncontextual realism is not true.

2:59:54.600 --> 2:59:57.200
 And that fits in perfectly with this idea

2:59:57.200 --> 2:59:59.600
 that consciousness is fundamental.

2:59:59.600 --> 3:00:01.840
 These things are, these exist as data structures

3:00:01.840 --> 3:00:02.840
 when we create them.

3:00:03.760 --> 3:00:06.720
 As Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation

3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:08.760
 is an act of fact creation.

3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:10.960
 But I must say on a personal level,

3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:15.020
 I'm having to spend,

3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.760
 I spend a couple hours a day

3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:22.480
 just sitting in meditation on this

3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:27.480
 and facing the rebellion in me

3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:28.720
 that goes to the core,

3:00:28.720 --> 3:00:30.360
 it feels like it goes to the core of my being,

3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:31.960
 rebellion against these ideas.

3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:33.560
 So here it's very, very interesting

3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:34.880
 for me to look at this because,

3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:37.320
 so here I'm a scientist and I'm a person.

3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:39.160
 The science is really clear.

3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:40.280
 Local realism is false.

3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:42.220
 Noncontextual realism is false.

3:00:42.220 --> 3:00:43.280
 Space time is doomed.

3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:44.560
 It's very, very clear.

3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:46.000
 It couldn't be clearer.

3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:50.240
 And my emotions rebel left and right.

3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:52.040
 When I sit there and say, okay,

3:00:52.040 --> 3:00:53.840
 I am not something in space and time.

3:00:55.080 --> 3:00:57.720
 Something inside of me says, you're crazy.

3:00:57.720 --> 3:00:58.560
 Of course you are.

3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:00.160
 And I'm completely attached to it.

3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:02.000
 I'm completely attached to all this stuff.

3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:02.960
 I'm attached to my body.

3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:04.640
 I'm attached to the headset.

3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:06.920
 I'm attached to my car.

3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:07.760
 I'm attached to people.

3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:08.920
 I'm attached to all of it.

3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:12.800
 And yet I know as an absolute fact,

3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:14.680
 I'm gonna walk away from all of it.

3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:15.520
 I'm gonna die.

3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:21.560
 In fact, I almost died last year.

3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:22.880
 COVID almost killed me.

3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:26.560
 I sent a goodbye text to my wife.

3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.320
 So I thought I was done.

3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:29.240
 You really did.

3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:30.480
 I sent her a goodbye.

3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:35.480
 I was in the emergency room and it had attacked my heart

3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:39.000
 and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours.

3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:41.360
 I couldn't last much longer.

3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:43.720
 I knew I couldn't, they couldn't stop it.

3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:46.440
 So that was it.

3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:47.280
 So that was it.

3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:50.440
 So I texted her goodbye from the emergency room.

3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:52.240
 I love you, goodbye kind of thing.

3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:53.560
 Yeah, right.

3:01:53.560 --> 3:01:54.800
 Yeah, that was it.

3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:55.640
 So, so.

3:01:55.640 --> 3:01:56.480
 Were you afraid?

3:01:57.360 --> 3:01:59.120
 God, it scares the hell out of you, right?

3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:02.600
 But there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway

3:02:02.600 --> 3:02:06.800
 that sort of you're scared, but you're just feeling so bad

3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:09.200
 that in some sense you just want it to stop anyway.

3:02:10.840 --> 3:02:15.840
 So I've been there and faced it just a year ago.

3:02:16.840 --> 3:02:18.840
 How did that change you, by the way?

3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:22.600
 Having this intellectual reality that's so challenging

3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:25.480
 that you meditate on, it's just an interface.

3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:28.840
 And one of the hardest things to come to terms with

3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:32.960
 is that that means that it's gonna end.

3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:37.480
 How did that change you having come so close

3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:38.320
 to the reality of it?

3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:39.920
 It's not just an intellectual reality,

3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:43.760
 it's a reality of death.

3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:46.800
 It's forced, I've meditated for 20 years now.

3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:50.360
 And I would say averaging three or four hours a day.

3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:57.440
 But it's put a new urgency,

3:02:57.440 --> 3:02:59.280
 but urgency is not the right word

3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:04.280
 because it's riveted my attention, I'll put it that way.

3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:09.640
 It's really riveted my attention and I've really paid,

3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:12.040
 I spent a lot more time looking up

3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:13.880
 what spiritual traditions say.

3:03:15.280 --> 3:03:18.760
 I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with the,

3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:21.440
 take it all with a grain of salt.

3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:23.400
 But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me

3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:24.320
 to ignore it.

3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:28.880
 So I try to listen to the best ideas

3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:32.240
 and to sort out nonsense from,

3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:34.480
 and we all have to do it for ourselves, right?

3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:35.520
 It's not easy.

3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:37.360
 So what makes sense?

3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:39.280
 And I have the advantage of some science

3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:40.800
 so I can look at what science says

3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:43.080
 and try to compare with spiritual tradition.

3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:44.880
 I try to sort it out for myself.

3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:48.360
 But then I also look and realize

3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:49.600
 that there's another aspect to me,

3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:51.440
 which is this whole emotional aspect.

3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:54.200
 The, I seem to be wired up

3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:00.680
 as evolutionary psychology says I'm wired up, right?

3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:03.400
 All these defensive mechanisms, you know,

3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:06.040
 I'm inclined to lie if I need to.

3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:10.080
 I'm inclined to be angry, to protect myself,

3:04:10.080 --> 3:04:12.280
 to have an in group and an out group,

3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:16.800
 to try to make my reputation as big as possible,

3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:18.640
 to try to demean the out group.

3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:19.480
 There's all these things

3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:22.320
 that evolutionary psychology is spot on.

3:04:22.320 --> 3:04:25.400
 It's really bright about the human condition.

3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:29.640
 And yet I think evolution, as I said, evolutionary theory

3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:31.160
 is a projection of a deeper theory

3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:32.960
 where there may be no competition.

3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:37.800
 So how, so I'm in this very interesting position

3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:40.320
 where I feel like, okay,

3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:42.200
 according to my own theory, I'm consciousness.

3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:43.720
 And maybe this is what it means

3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:46.480
 for consciousness to wake up.

3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:48.400
 It's not easy.

3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:52.240
 It's almost like I have,

3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:54.680
 I feel like I have real skin in the game.

3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:55.760
 It really is scary.

3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:58.720
 I really was scared when I was about to die.

3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:02.360
 It really was hard to say goodbye to my wife.

3:05:02.360 --> 3:05:04.640
 It really, it really pained.

3:05:04.640 --> 3:05:09.360
 And to then look at that and then look at the fact

3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:11.560
 that I'm gonna walk away from this anyway

3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:12.800
 and it's just an interface.

3:05:12.800 --> 3:05:16.240
 How do I, so it's trying to put all this stuff together

3:05:16.240 --> 3:05:19.320
 and really grok it, so to speak,

3:05:19.320 --> 3:05:22.680
 not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.

3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:23.920
 Yeah, what are you afraid of,

3:05:23.920 --> 3:05:26.680
 you silly evolved organism

3:05:26.680 --> 3:05:30.000
 that's gotten way too attached to the interface?

3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:32.000
 What are you really afraid of?

3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:32.840
 That's right.

3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:34.880
 Is there a...

3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:36.640
 Very personal, you know, it's very, very personal.

3:05:36.640 --> 3:05:37.480
 Yeah.

3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:38.920
 Yeah.

3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.960
 I mean, speaking of the text,

3:05:40.960 --> 3:05:43.920
 what do you think is this whole love thing?

3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:48.920
 What's the role of love in our human condition?

3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:51.040
 This interface thing we have,

3:05:51.040 --> 3:05:53.040
 is this somehow interweaved,

3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:54.640
 interconnected with consciousness?

3:05:54.640 --> 3:05:56.600
 This attachment we have to other humans

3:05:56.600 --> 3:05:59.600
 and this deep, like some quality to it

3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:07.440
 that seems very interesting, peculiar.

3:06:07.440 --> 3:06:11.200
 Well, there are two levels I would think about that.

3:06:11.200 --> 3:06:12.880
 There's love in the sexual sense

3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:15.400
 and there's love in a deeper sense.

3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:16.960
 And in the sexual sense,

3:06:16.960 --> 3:06:20.040
 we can give an evolutionary account of that and so forth.

3:06:20.040 --> 3:06:22.200
 And I think that's pretty clear to people.

3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:27.640
 In this deeper sense, right?

3:06:27.640 --> 3:06:32.320
 So of course, I love my wife in a sexual sense,

3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:34.040
 but there is a deeper sense as well.

3:06:34.040 --> 3:06:35.080
 When I was saying goodbye to her,

3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:38.440
 there was a much deeper love that was really at play there.

3:06:38.440 --> 3:06:40.560
 That's one place where I think

3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.200
 that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions

3:06:43.200 --> 3:06:44.080
 has something right.

3:06:44.080 --> 3:06:46.240
 When they say, love your neighbor as yourself,

3:06:46.240 --> 3:06:49.440
 that in some sense, love is fundamental.

3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:51.880
 I think that they're onto something,

3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:53.840
 something very, very deep and profound.

3:06:54.800 --> 3:06:57.480
 And every once in a while,

3:06:57.480 --> 3:06:58.960
 I can get a personal glimpse of that,

3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:03.800
 especially when I'm in the space with no thought.

3:07:03.800 --> 3:07:06.000
 When I can really let go of thoughts,

3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:10.200
 I get little glimpses of a love

3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:11.960
 in the sense that I'm not separate.

3:07:11.960 --> 3:07:16.600
 It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that.

3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:21.240
 If you and I are separate, then I can fight you.

3:07:21.240 --> 3:07:25.120
 But if you and I are the same, if there's a union there.

3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:26.720
 The togetherness of it, yeah.

3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:28.600
 What, who's God?

3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:32.840
 All those gods, the stories that have been told

3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:36.680
 throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions.

3:07:36.680 --> 3:07:37.840
 What do you think that is?

3:07:37.840 --> 3:07:42.840
 Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?

3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:48.800
 Well, in many traditions, not all.

3:07:50.760 --> 3:07:53.760
 The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister.

3:07:54.760 --> 3:07:57.880
 We tend to think of God as a being.

3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:02.760
 But I think that that's not right.

3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:06.840
 I think the closest way to think about God is being, period.

3:08:06.840 --> 3:08:11.840
 Not a being, but being, the very ground of being itself is God.

3:08:12.280 --> 3:08:16.280
 I think that's the deep, and from my point of view,

3:08:16.280 --> 3:08:17.560
 that's the ground of consciousness.

3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:22.400
 So the ground of conscious being is what we might call God.

3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:25.160
 But the word God has always been,

3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:27.560
 for example, you don't believe the same God as my God,

3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:30.400
 so I'm gonna fight you, or we'll have wars over,

3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:34.400
 because the being, the specific being that you call God

3:08:34.400 --> 3:08:35.880
 is different from the being that I call God,

3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:36.840
 and so we fight.

3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:40.920
 Whereas if it's not a being, but just being,

3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:42.880
 and you and I share a being,

3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:45.000
 then you and I are not separate,

3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:46.840
 and there's no reason to fight.

3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:48.720
 We're both part of that one being,

3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:51.960
 and loving you is loving myself,

3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:54.000
 because we're all part of that one being.

3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:57.240
 The spiritual traditions that point to that,

3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:01.280
 I think are pointing in a very interesting direction,

3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:04.720
 and that does seem to match with the mathematics

3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:05.760
 of the conscious agent stuff

3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:07.360
 that I've been working on as well,

3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:11.520
 that it really fits with that, although that wasn't my goal.

3:09:11.520 --> 3:09:13.560
 Is there, you mentioned,

3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:19.480
 you mentioned that the young physicists that you talk to,

3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:23.720
 or whose work you follow, have quite a lot of fun

3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:26.160
 breaking with the traditions of the past,

3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:27.800
 the assumptions of the past.

3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:31.160
 What advice would you give to young people today,

3:09:31.160 --> 3:09:34.080
 in high school, in college, not just physicists,

3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:38.760
 but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of,

3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:41.440
 how they can have a life they can be proud of,

3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:43.000
 how to make their way in the world,

3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.960
 from the lessons, from the wins and the losses

3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:49.360
 in your own life, what little insights could you pull out?

3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:53.920
 I would say the universe is a lot more interesting

3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:58.520
 than you might expect, and you are a lot more special

3:09:58.520 --> 3:09:59.960
 and interesting than you might expect.

3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:03.720
 You might think that you're just a little, tiny,

3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:08.720
 irrelevant, 100 pound, 200 pound person

3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:12.720
 in a vast billions of light years across space,

3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:15.920
 and that's not the case.

3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:18.920
 You are, in some sense, the being that's creating

3:10:18.920 --> 3:10:21.520
 that space all the time, every time you look.

3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:25.280
 So, waking up to who you really are,

3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:26.640
 outside of space and time,

3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:29.360
 as the author of space and time,

3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:32.040
 as the author of everything that you see.

3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:36.320
 The author of space and time, sorry.

3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:38.240
 You're the author of space and time,

3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:40.000
 and I'm the author of space and time,

3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.640
 and space and time is just one little data structure.

3:10:42.640 --> 3:10:44.120
 Many other consciousnesses are creating

3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:46.000
 other data structures, they're authors

3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:48.240
 of various other things.

3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:52.040
 So, realizing, and then realizing that,

3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:54.920
 I had this feeling growing up, going to college,

3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:57.520
 reading all these textbooks, oh man, it's all been done.

3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:00.560
 If I'd just been there 50 years ago,

3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:01.520
 I could have discovered this stuff,

3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:03.800
 but it's all in the textbooks now.

3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:07.240
 Well, believe me, the textbooks are gonna look silly

3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:10.160
 in 50 years, and it's your chance

3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:11.160
 to write the new textbook.

3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:14.600
 So, of course, study the current textbooks.

3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:15.920
 You have to understand them.

3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:19.200
 There's no way to progress until you understand

3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:22.040
 what's been done, but then,

3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:26.000
 the only limit is your imagination, frankly.

3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:26.840
 That's the only limit.

3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:29.160
 The greatest books, the greatest textbooks

3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:31.880
 ever written on Earth are yet to be written.

3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:32.720
 Exactly.

3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:36.880
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:40.160
 What's the meaning of life from your limited interface?

3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:43.400
 Can you figure it all out, like why?

3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:46.040
 So, you said the universe is kind of trying to figure

3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:47.840
 itself out through us.

3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:50.320
 Why?

3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:51.160
 Why?

3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:55.400
 Yeah, that's the closest I've come.

3:11:55.400 --> 3:12:00.400
 So, I'll give you, so I will say that I don't know,

3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:02.680
 but here's my guess, right?

3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:03.920
 That's a good first sentence.

3:12:03.920 --> 3:12:05.200
 That's a good starting point.

3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:08.600
 And maybe that's gonna be a profound part

3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:10.800
 of the final answer is to start with the I don't know.

3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:13.760
 It's quite possible that that's really important

3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:15.240
 to start with the I don't know.

3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:18.600
 My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental

3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:22.960
 and if Gödel's incompleteness theorem holds here,

3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:26.360
 and there's infinite variety of structures

3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:29.960
 for consciousness to some sense explore,

3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:37.080
 that maybe that's what it's about.

3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:39.400
 This is something that Annika and I talked about a little bit

3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:40.840
 and she doesn't like this way of talking about it.

3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:42.680
 And so I'm gonna have to talk with her some more

3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:43.920
 about this way of talking.

3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:45.440
 But right now I'll just put it this way

3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:46.440
 and I'll have to talk with her more

3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:48.920
 and see if I can say it more clearly.

3:12:48.920 --> 3:12:51.920
 But the way I'm talking about it now is that

3:12:55.680 --> 3:12:59.200
 there's a sense in which there's being

3:13:01.640 --> 3:13:03.840
 and then there's the experiences or forms

3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:05.680
 that come out of being.

3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:09.800
 That's one deep, deep mystery.

3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:13.680
 And the question that you asked, what is it all about?

3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:15.240
 Somehow it's related to that.

3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:19.600
 Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms?

3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:22.560
 Why do we have experiences?

3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:26.680
 Why not just have, when you close your eyes

3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:30.040
 and pay attention to what's behind you, there's nothing.

3:13:30.040 --> 3:13:30.960
 But there's being.

3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:35.960
 So why don't we just stop there?

3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:37.000
 Why didn't we just stop there?

3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:39.400
 Why did we create all tables and chairs

3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:41.720
 and the sun and moon and people?

3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:43.840
 All this really complicated stuff, why?

3:13:44.720 --> 3:13:49.440
 And all I can guess right now,

3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:51.840
 and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years

3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:53.960
 and say that was dumb, but all I can guess right now

3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:57.880
 is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself

3:13:57.880 --> 3:13:59.080
 by knowing what it's not.

3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:02.280
 So here I am, I'm not this body.

3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:05.640
 And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face

3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:08.320
 when I sent a text goodbye.

3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:10.520
 But then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like,

3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:13.320
 okay, I sort of don't wanna go there, right?

3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:17.560
 I, okay, so I just, so I am my body.

3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:19.640
 I go back to the standard thing, I am my body

3:14:19.640 --> 3:14:21.560
 and then I want to get that car.

3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:24.080
 And even though I was just about to die a year ago,

3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:26.000
 so that comes rushing back.

3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:31.000
 So consciousness immerses itself fully

3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:35.040
 into a particular headset.

3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:39.760
 Gets lost in it and then slowly wakes up.

3:14:39.760 --> 3:14:41.920
 Just so it can escape and that is the waking up,

3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:43.240
 but it needs to have a negative.

3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:44.960
 It needs to know what it's not.

3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:47.720
 It needs to know what you are.

3:14:47.720 --> 3:14:49.600
 You have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not that.

3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:52.600
 That wasn't important, that wasn't important.

3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:53.720
 That's really powerful.

3:14:53.720 --> 3:14:57.760
 Don, let me just say that because I've been

3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:01.120
 a long term fan of yours and we're supposed

3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:03.840
 to have a conversation during this very difficult moment

3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:06.840
 in your life, let me just say you're a truly special person

3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:10.800
 and I for one, I know there's a lot of others that agree.

3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:13.720
 I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth

3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:15.240
 if for a short time.

3:15:17.360 --> 3:15:21.760
 So whatever, whatever the universe,

3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:25.480
 whatever plan it has for you that brought you close

3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.560
 to death to maybe enlighten you some kind of way,

3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.040
 I think it has an interesting plan for you.

3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:35.960
 You're one of the truly special humans

3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:37.480
 and it's a huge honor that you would sit

3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:38.800
 and talk with me today.

3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:39.640
 Thank you so much.

3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:40.520
 Thank you very much, Lex.

3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:42.760
 I really appreciate that, thank you.

3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:44.200
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:45.480
 with Donald Hoffman.

 in the description and now, let me leave you

3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:53.120
 with some words from Albert Einstein,

3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:56.040
 relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation.

3:15:56.960 --> 3:16:01.240
 Time and space are modes by which we think

3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:03.680
 and not conditions in which we live.

3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:23.680
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
