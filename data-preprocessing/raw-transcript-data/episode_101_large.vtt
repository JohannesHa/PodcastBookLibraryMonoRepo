 The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, VP of Research at the AI Foundation,

00:05.520 --> 00:12.160
 with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard. Yosha is one of the most unique

00:12.160 --> 00:16.720
 and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community, exploring the workings

00:16.720 --> 00:23.360
 of the human mind, intelligence, consciousness, life on Earth, and the possibly simulated

00:23.360 --> 00:28.640
 fabric of our universe. I could see myself talking to Yosha many times in the future.

 I challenge you to try to figure out how to spell my last name without using the letter E.

01:08.480 --> 01:14.240
 And it'll probably be the correct way. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never hear

01:14.240 --> 01:19.120
 any yas in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. This show is sponsored by

01:34.160 --> 01:40.240
 I think ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there. They told me to say it, but I think it actually

01:40.240 --> 01:46.880
 happens to be true. It doesn't log your data, it's crazy fast, and it's easy to use. Literally,

01:46.880 --> 01:52.640
 just one big power on button. Again, for obvious reasons, it's really important that they don't

01:52.640 --> 01:59.040
 log your data. It works on Linux and everywhere else too. Shout out to my favorite flavor of Linux,

02:23.600 --> 02:29.360
 friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar. Since Cash

02:29.360 --> 02:34.320
 App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works

02:34.320 --> 02:40.160
 behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel.

02:40.160 --> 02:45.120
 So big props to the Cash App engineers for taking a step up to the next layer of abstraction over

02:45.120 --> 02:51.120
 the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.200

 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, an organization that is helping

03:03.840 --> 03:07.920
 advanced robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

03:09.200 --> 03:16.880
 And now here's my conversation with Joscha Bach. As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East

03:16.880 --> 03:23.840
 Germany, just as we're talking about off mic, to parents who are artists. And now I think,

03:23.840 --> 03:27.280
 at least to me, you've become one of the most unique thinkers in the AI world.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.480
 So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit?

03:30.480 --> 03:38.400
 What were the key philosopher, scientist ideas, maybe even movies or just realizations that

03:38.400 --> 03:43.680
 had an impact on you when you were growing up that kind of led to the trajectory,

03:43.680 --> 03:47.920
 or were the key sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development?

03:49.600 --> 03:56.560
 My father came from a long tradition of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family.

03:56.560 --> 04:03.680
 And so basically, he was technically a nerd. And nerds need to interface in society with

04:03.680 --> 04:09.360
 nonstandard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of

04:09.360 --> 04:15.920
 communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And normal people understand that the

04:15.920 --> 04:21.600
 primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict,

04:21.600 --> 04:26.400
 which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.360
 Who is the reviewer in the nerd's view of communication?

04:31.360 --> 04:36.960
 Everybody who you consider to be a peer. So whatever hapless individual is around,

04:36.960 --> 04:40.800
 well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information.

04:42.400 --> 04:50.560
 Okay. So you're now, by the way, my research malinformed me. So you're architect or artist?

04:50.560 --> 04:58.160
 So he did study architecture. But basically, my grandfather made the wrong decision. He married

04:58.160 --> 05:07.120
 an aristocrat and was drawn into the war. And he came back after 15 years. So basically, my father

05:07.680 --> 05:14.800
 was not parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him what to do, and expected him

05:14.800 --> 05:21.120
 to do what he was told. And he was unable to. He's unable to do things if he's not intrinsically

05:21.120 --> 05:27.600
 motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son. And her son responded when he became an

05:27.600 --> 05:33.200
 architect to become an artist. So he built 100 Wasser architecture. He built houses without

05:33.200 --> 05:38.400
 right angles. He built lots of things that didn't work in the more brutalist traditions of eastern

05:38.400 --> 05:44.640
 Germany. And so he bought an old watermill, moved out to the countryside, and did only what he wanted

05:44.640 --> 05:50.640
 to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for Boheme, because you had complete material

05:50.640 --> 05:55.520
 safety. Food was heavily subsidized, healthcare was free. You didn't have to worry about rent or

05:55.520 --> 06:00.000
 pensions or anything. So it's a socialized communist side. Yes. And the other thing is,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.080
 it was almost impossible not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very

06:04.080 --> 06:08.800
 productive for artists. So everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful, because it will

06:08.800 --> 06:14.160
 always touch on the deeper currents of society of culture and be in conflict with it and tension

06:14.160 --> 06:19.040
 with it. And you will always have to define yourself with respect to this. So what impacted

06:19.040 --> 06:26.640
 your father, this outside of the box thinker against the government, against the world artists?

06:26.640 --> 06:31.360
 He was actually not a thinker. He was somebody who only got self aware to the degree that he

06:31.360 --> 06:39.200
 needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, he was also in the late 1960s. And he was

06:39.200 --> 06:44.720
 in some sense a hippie. So he became a one person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. He built

06:44.720 --> 06:53.600
 big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on and convinced a woman to live with

06:53.600 --> 06:58.480
 him. She was also an architect and she adored him and decided to share her life with him.

06:58.480 --> 07:05.280
 And I basically grew up in a big cave full of books. I'm almost feral. And I was bored out

07:05.280 --> 07:11.120
 there. It was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely. So I started to read. And by

07:11.120 --> 07:16.240
 the time I came to school, I've read everything until fourth grade and then some. And there was

07:16.240 --> 07:21.760
 not a real way for me to relate to the outside world. And I couldn't quite put my finger on why.

07:21.760 --> 07:26.800
 And today I know it was because I was a nerd, obviously, and it was the only nerd around. So

07:26.800 --> 07:32.800
 there was no other kids like me. And there was nobody interested in physics or computing or

07:32.800 --> 07:38.320
 mathematics and so on. And this village school that I went to was basically a nice school.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.800
 Kids were nice to me. I was not beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or

07:42.800 --> 07:47.120
 build deep relationships. They only happened in starting from ninth grade when I went into a

07:47.120 --> 07:51.200
 school for mathematics and physics. Do you remember any key books from this moment?

07:51.200 --> 07:56.880
 I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the

07:56.880 --> 08:01.200
 children's and young adult sections. And then I read a lot of science fiction,

08:01.200 --> 08:06.800
 for instance, Stanislav Lem, basically the great author of Cybernetics, has influenced me. Back

08:06.800 --> 08:10.640
 then, I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural

08:10.640 --> 08:16.560
 to me. And it's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote. Another thing that

08:16.560 --> 08:22.000
 was very influential on me were the classical philosophers and also the literature of romanticism.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.680
 So German poetry and art, Troste Hilshoff and Heine and up to Hesse and so on.

08:29.680 --> 08:35.840
 Hesse. I love Hesse. So at which point do the classical philosophers end? At this point,

08:35.840 --> 08:40.560
 we're in the 21st century. What's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through

08:41.680 --> 08:45.840
 even as far as Nietzsche or is this, are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?

08:45.840 --> 08:49.120
 I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster.

08:52.560 --> 08:57.920
 He's very smart and easy to read, but he's not so much trolling others. He's trolling himself

08:57.920 --> 09:02.480
 because he was at odds with the world. Largely his romantic relationships didn't work out.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.640
 He got angry and he basically became a nihilist.

09:06.240 --> 09:11.760
 Isn't that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual is to constantly be trolling yourself,

09:11.760 --> 09:14.960
 to be in that conflict, in that tension?

09:14.960 --> 09:18.720
 I think it's a lack of self awareness. At some point, you have to understand the

09:18.720 --> 09:23.840
 comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not functional,

09:23.840 --> 09:25.840
 it ends in tragedy as it did for Nietzsche.

09:25.840 --> 09:29.760
 I think you think he took himself too seriously in that tension.

09:29.760 --> 09:34.160
 And as you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, this Steppenwolf syndrome is classic

09:34.160 --> 09:38.880
 adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all the

09:38.880 --> 09:44.160
 misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self awareness because you think that you are

09:44.160 --> 09:48.960
 a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them

09:48.960 --> 09:53.600
 based on your innate instincts and it doesn't work out and you become a transcendentalist

09:53.600 --> 09:58.480
 to deal with that. So it's very, very understandable and have great sympathies for this

09:58.480 --> 10:02.160
 to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.720
 But you have to grow out of it.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.600
 So as an intellectual, a life well lived, a journey well traveled is one where you don't

10:09.600 --> 10:11.120
 take yourself seriously from that perspective?

10:11.120 --> 10:17.840
 No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you need to become

10:17.840 --> 10:24.720
 unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.360
 You don't do this for the audience and you don't do it for yourself.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.240
 You have to submit to the things that are possibly true and you have to follow wherever

10:32.240 --> 10:36.400
 your inquiry leads. But it's not about you. It has nothing to do with you.

10:36.400 --> 10:42.080
 So do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of an idea of there's objective

10:42.080 --> 10:48.000
 truth. So what's your sense in the philosophical, if you remove yourself as objective from the

10:48.000 --> 10:52.560
 picture, you think it's possible to actually discover ideas that are true or are we just

10:52.560 --> 10:57.840
 in a mesh of relative concepts that are either true nor false? It's just a giant mess.

10:57.840 --> 11:02.720
 You cannot define objective truth without understanding the nature of truth in the first

11:02.720 --> 11:08.000
 place. So what does the brain mean by saying that discover something as truth? So for instance,

11:08.000 --> 11:14.560
 a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there can be a sense in which a mathematical

11:14.560 --> 11:19.520
 statement can be true because it's defined as true under certain conditions. So it's basically

11:19.520 --> 11:26.320
 a particular state that a variable can have in a simple game. And then you can have a

11:26.320 --> 11:31.120
 correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is again, a type of model correspondence.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.960
 And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground truth. So for instance,

11:34.960 --> 11:41.200
 you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all. It's stunning when you realize

11:41.200 --> 11:47.360
 something exists rather than nothing. And this seems to be true. There's an absolute truth in

11:47.360 --> 11:52.400
 the fact that something seems to be happening. Yeah, that to me is a showstopper. I could just

11:52.400 --> 11:57.840
 think about that idea and be amazed by that idea for the rest of my life and not going any farther

11:57.840 --> 12:01.040
 because I don't even know the answer to that. Why does anything exist at all?

12:01.040 --> 12:04.960
 Well, the easiest answer is existence is the default, right? So this is the lowest number of

12:04.960 --> 12:07.360
 bits that you would need to encode this. Whose answer?

12:07.920 --> 12:11.280
 The simplest answer to this is that existence is the default.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.200
 What about nonexistence? I mean, that seems...

12:14.240 --> 12:18.080
 Nonexistence might not be a meaningful notion in this sense. So in some sense,

12:18.080 --> 12:23.440
 if everything that can exist exists, for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable.

12:23.440 --> 12:28.240
 The only thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the

12:28.240 --> 12:33.120
 superposition of all finite automata and we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties

12:33.120 --> 12:37.760
 that it can contain us. What does it mean to be a superposition of finite automata?

12:40.000 --> 12:45.840
 Superposition of all possible rules? Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator

12:45.840 --> 12:50.400
 that acts on some substrate and as a result, you get emergent patterns.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.280
 What's the substrate?

12:52.640 --> 12:55.040
 I have no idea to know. But some substrate.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.400
 It's something that can store information.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.320
 Something that can store information, there's a automaton.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.680
 Something that can hold state.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.360
 Still, it doesn't make sense to me the why that exists at all. I could just sit there

13:06.480 --> 13:11.280
 with a beer or a vodka and just enjoy the fact, pondering the why.

13:11.280 --> 13:16.960
 It may not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there could be no

13:16.960 --> 13:22.640
 relation in the why direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't mean

13:22.640 --> 13:28.720
 that everything has to have a purpose or cause. So we mentioned some philosophers in that early,

13:28.720 --> 13:34.800
 just taking a brief step back into that. So we asked ourselves when did classical philosophy end?

13:34.800 --> 13:38.240
 I think for Germany, it largely ended with the first revolution.

13:38.240 --> 13:45.680
 That's basically when we entered the monarchy and started a democracy. And at this point,

13:45.680 --> 13:50.080
 we basically came up with a new form of government that didn't have a good sense of

13:50.080 --> 13:56.080
 this new organism that society wanted to be. And in a way, it decapitated the universities.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.760
 So the universities went on through modernism like a headless chicken.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.600
 At the same time, democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism as a result.

14:04.240 --> 14:08.640
 And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned down intellectual traditions

14:08.640 --> 14:14.160
 in Russia. And Germany, both Germanys have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had this

14:14.160 --> 14:20.560
 vulgar dialectic materialism and Western Germany didn't get much more edgy than Habermas. So in

14:20.560 --> 14:24.640
 some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions and killing off and driving out the

14:24.640 --> 14:33.680
 Jews didn't help. Yeah. So that was the end of really rigorous what you would say is classical

14:33.680 --> 14:39.440
 philosophy. There's also this thing that in some sense, the low hanging foods in philosophy

14:39.440 --> 14:46.240
 were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered was the constructivist turn

14:46.240 --> 14:51.120
 in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of mathematics that work are computation,

14:51.680 --> 14:57.200
 there was a very significant discovery in the first half of the 20th century. And it hasn't

14:57.200 --> 15:02.640
 fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists checked out the code libraries

15:02.640 --> 15:08.880
 for mathematics before constructivism became universal. What's constructivism? What are you

15:08.880 --> 15:13.600
 referring to, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, those kinds of ideas? So basically, Gödel himself,

15:13.600 --> 15:18.880
 I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance, countries

15:18.880 --> 15:25.120
 set theoretic experiments and mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that with the

15:25.120 --> 15:29.440
 current semantics, we cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.040
 And Gödel could prove this. And so what Gödel could show is using classical mathematical

15:35.040 --> 15:40.480
 semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Gödel strongly believed in these semantics and

15:40.480 --> 15:46.640
 more than what he could observe and so on, he was shocked. It basically shook his world to the core

15:46.640 --> 15:50.240
 because in some sense, he felt that the world has to be implemented in classical mathematics.

15:50.960 --> 15:56.400
 And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that Turing could see that the solution is to

15:56.400 --> 16:01.920
 understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means you, for instance, pi

16:01.920 --> 16:08.080
 in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function, but it's the same thing. And in

16:08.080 --> 16:13.360
 computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it. And if you cannot compute the last

16:13.360 --> 16:18.240
 digit of pi, you only have a function. You can plug this function into your local sun, let it run

16:18.240 --> 16:22.880
 until the sun burns out. This is it. This is the last digit of pi you will know. But it also means

16:22.880 --> 16:28.480
 there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically realized computer that depends

16:28.480 --> 16:34.160
 on having known the last digit of pi. Which means there are parts of physics that are defined in

16:34.160 --> 16:38.160
 such a way that cannot strictly be true, because assuming that this could be true leads into

16:38.160 --> 16:44.240
 contradictions. So I think putting computation at the center of the world view is actually the

16:44.240 --> 16:49.840
 right way to think about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein basically preempted

16:49.840 --> 16:55.360
 the logitist program of AI that Minsky started later, like 30 years later. Turing was actually

16:55.360 --> 17:00.480
 a pupil of Wittgenstein. I didn't know there's any connection between Turing and Wittgenstein.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.680
 Wittgenstein even cancelled some classes when Turing was not present because he thought it

17:03.680 --> 17:09.680
 was not worth spending the time with the others. If you read the Tractatus, it's a very beautiful

17:09.680 --> 17:15.040
 book, like basically one thought on 75 pages. It's very non typical for philosophy because it doesn't

17:15.040 --> 17:21.600
 have arguments in it and it doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending

17:21.600 --> 17:26.320
 to convince anybody. He says, it's mostly for people that had the same insight as me,

17:26.320 --> 17:32.080
 just spell it out. And this insight is there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy

17:32.080 --> 17:37.040
 ought to meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those

17:37.040 --> 17:42.000
 that are so formalizable that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.960
 But the price that you pay is that your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say

17:46.960 --> 17:52.320
 something meaningful in mathematics. And it looks complicated to people, but it's far less complicated

17:52.320 --> 17:58.320
 than what our brain is casually doing all the time when it makes sense of reality. And philosophy is

17:58.320 --> 18:03.600
 coming from the top. So it's mostly starting from natural languages with vaguely defined concepts.

18:03.600 --> 18:08.720
 And the hope is that mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point. And Wittgenstein was trying

18:08.720 --> 18:12.320
 to make them meet. And he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything with

18:12.320 --> 18:17.440
 the NAND calculus, that you could reduce the entire logic to NAND gates as we do in our modern

18:17.440 --> 18:22.320
 computers. So in some sense, he already understood Turing universality before Turing spelled it out.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.640
 I think when he wrote the Tractatus, he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important

18:26.640 --> 18:32.400
 and significant. And I suspect then when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was

18:32.400 --> 18:39.280
 not that famous when he lived. It was mostly his work in decrypting the German codes that made him

18:39.280 --> 18:44.400
 famous or gave him some notoriety. But this saint status that he has to computer science right now

18:44.400 --> 18:48.720
 and the AI is something that I think he could acquire later. That's kind of interesting. Do

18:48.720 --> 18:53.040
 you think of computation and computer science? And you kind of represent that to me is maybe

18:53.040 --> 19:00.080
 that's the modern day. You in a sense are the new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist

19:00.720 --> 19:06.000
 who dares to ask the bigger questions that philosophy originally started is the new

19:06.000 --> 19:12.240
 philosopher. Certainly not me. I think I'm mostly still this child that grows up in a

19:12.240 --> 19:16.160
 very beautiful valley and looks at the world from the outside and tries to understand what's going

19:16.160 --> 19:20.560
 on. And my teachers tell me things and they largely don't make sense. So I have to make my

19:20.560 --> 19:25.040
 own models. I have to discover the foundations of what the others are saying. I have to try to fix

19:25.040 --> 19:30.160
 them to be charitable. I try to understand what they must have thought originally or what their

19:30.160 --> 19:34.240
 teachers or their teacher's teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation

19:34.240 --> 19:38.880
 and how to make sense of the reality that we are in. And whenever I have an original idea,

19:38.880 --> 19:43.360
 I'm usually late to the party by say 400 years. And the only thing that's good is that the parties

19:43.360 --> 19:49.120
 get smaller and smaller the older I get and the more I explore it. The parties get smaller and

19:49.120 --> 19:55.680
 more exclusive and more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing

19:55.680 --> 20:01.040
 was that you were not tethered, whether it's because of your parents or in general,

20:01.040 --> 20:07.840
 maybe something within your mind, some genetic material, you were not tethered to the ideas

20:07.840 --> 20:14.720
 of the general populace, which is actually a unique property. We're kind of the education

20:14.720 --> 20:20.160
 system and whatever, not education system, just existing in this world forces certain sets of

20:20.160 --> 20:28.480
 ideas onto you. Can you disentangle that? Why are you not so tethered? Even in your work today,

20:28.480 --> 20:38.400
 you seem to not care about perhaps a best paper in Europe, right? Being tethered to particular

20:38.400 --> 20:44.960
 things that current today in this year, people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and

20:44.960 --> 20:50.160
 resume. You're a little bit more outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people

20:50.160 --> 20:56.080
 are especially focused in the benchmarks of today, the things. Can you disentangle that?

20:56.080 --> 20:59.440
 Because I think that's inspiring. And if there were more people like that,

20:59.440 --> 21:05.760
 we might be able to solve some of the bigger problems that AI dreams to solve.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.640
 And there's a big danger in this because in a way you are expected to marry into an

21:10.640 --> 21:16.320
 intellectual tradition and visit this tradition into a particular school. If everybody comes up

21:16.320 --> 21:22.000
 with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not cumulative as an enterprise. So in some sense,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.320
 you need a healthy balance. You need paradigmatic thinkers and you need people that work within

21:26.320 --> 21:32.080
 given paradigms. Basically, scientists today define themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a

21:32.080 --> 21:38.080
 disease that we think as a scientist, as somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor,

21:38.080 --> 21:42.240
 that they should join a particular discipline and then they find a good mentor to learn the

21:42.240 --> 21:47.120
 right methods. And then they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team. And then

21:47.120 --> 21:52.800
 their name will show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns

21:52.800 --> 21:59.280
 with this approach. And when our field, computer science and AI started, most of the people that

21:59.280 --> 22:05.440
 joined this field had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers in AI either don't have interesting

22:05.440 --> 22:08.960
 opinions at all, or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually

22:08.960 --> 22:13.520
 doing. Because what they're doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon.

22:13.520 --> 22:21.360
 And this is often a good idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for me,

22:21.360 --> 22:27.360
 it's first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it? If the current

22:27.360 --> 22:32.880
 methods of machine learning lead to strong AI, why should I be doing it? I will just wait until

22:32.880 --> 22:38.240
 they're done and wait until they do this on the beach or read interesting books or write some

22:38.240 --> 22:44.160
 and have fun. But if you don't think that we are currently doing the right thing, if we are missing

22:45.040 --> 22:51.760
 some perspectives, then it's required to think outside of the box. It's also required to understand

22:51.760 --> 22:59.200
 the boxes. But it's necessary to understand what worked and what didn't work and for what reasons.

22:59.200 --> 23:03.920
 So you have to be willing to ask new questions and design new methods whenever you want to

23:03.920 --> 23:09.120
 answer them. And you have to be willing to dismiss the existing methods if you think that they're

23:09.120 --> 23:16.960
 not going to yield the right answers. It's very bad career advice to do that. So maybe to briefly

23:16.960 --> 23:23.440
 stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the dream

23:24.480 --> 23:30.880
 before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started, when was the dream to understand

23:30.880 --> 23:33.920
 or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you?

23:35.440 --> 23:44.000
 I think that you can see AI largely today as advanced information processing. If you would

23:44.000 --> 23:48.640
 change the acronym of AI into that, most people in the field would be happy. It would not change

23:48.640 --> 23:54.560
 anything what they're doing. We're automating statistics and many of the statistical models

23:54.560 --> 23:59.360
 are more advanced than what statisticians had in the past. And it's pretty good work. It's very

23:59.360 --> 24:04.480
 productive. And the other aspect of AI is philosophical project. And this philosophical

24:04.480 --> 24:09.840
 project is very risky and very few people work on it and it's not clear if it succeeds.

24:10.400 --> 24:16.000
 So first of all, you keep throwing sort of a lot of really interesting ideas and I have to

24:16.000 --> 24:22.480
 pick which ones we go with. But first of all, you use the term information processing,

24:22.480 --> 24:31.440
 just information processing as if it's the mere, it's the muck of existence as if it's the epitome

24:31.440 --> 24:36.720
 of existence, that the entirety of the universe might be information processing, that consciousness

24:36.720 --> 24:42.240
 and intelligence might be information processing. So that maybe you can comment on if the advanced

24:42.240 --> 24:48.800
 information processing is a limiting kind of a round of ideas. And then the other one is,

24:48.800 --> 24:54.320
 what do you mean by the philosophical project? So I suspect that general intelligence is the

24:54.880 --> 25:00.800
 result of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model.

25:00.800 --> 25:06.080
 It's not necessarily goal directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this,

25:06.640 --> 25:12.560
 but it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns

25:12.560 --> 25:17.360
 and be able to predict the next set of patterns, to make sense of things. And

25:17.360 --> 25:22.240
 some problems are very general. Usually intelligence serves control, so you make these

25:22.240 --> 25:26.720
 models for a particular purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results.

25:26.720 --> 25:31.760
 But the intelligence itself is in the sense instrumental to something, but by itself it's

25:31.760 --> 25:36.400
 just the ability to make models. And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes

25:36.400 --> 25:42.480
 them needs to understand what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child,

25:42.480 --> 25:47.360
 for instance, you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting

25:47.360 --> 25:53.040
 different things. So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you

25:53.040 --> 25:57.840
 have complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself, to reverse engineer yourself,

25:57.840 --> 26:02.640
 to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself

26:02.640 --> 26:08.000
 in relationship to your environment. And this process, this project, if you reverse engineer

26:08.000 --> 26:12.720
 yourself and your relationship to reality and the nature of a universe that can continue, if you go

26:12.720 --> 26:17.840
 all the way, this is basically the project of AI, or you could say the project of AI is a very

26:17.840 --> 26:24.240
 important component in it. The Turing test, in a way, is you ask a system, what is intelligence?

26:24.240 --> 26:32.000
 If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works, then you should assign it the property

26:32.000 --> 26:36.320
 of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test that Turing was administering

26:36.320 --> 26:41.120
 in a way, I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't express it yet in the original 1950

26:41.120 --> 26:47.600
 paper, is that he was trying to find out whether he was generally intelligent. Because in order to

26:47.600 --> 26:51.920
 take this test, the rub is, of course, you need to be able to understand what that system is saying.

26:51.920 --> 26:56.320
 And we don't yet know if we can build an AI. We don't yet know if we are generally intelligent.

26:56.320 --> 27:03.440
 Basically, you win the Turing test by building an AI. Yes. So in a sense, hidden within the Turing

27:03.440 --> 27:08.480
 test is a kind of recursive test. Yes, it's a test on us. The Turing test is basically

27:08.480 --> 27:13.040
 a test of the conjecture, whether people are intelligent enough to understand themselves.

27:14.240 --> 27:18.800
 Okay. But you also mentioned a little bit of a self awareness and then the project of AI.

27:18.800 --> 27:25.200
 Do you think this kind of emergent self awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence?

27:25.200 --> 27:31.200
 So as opposed to goal oriented, as you said, kind of puzzle solving, is

27:31.200 --> 27:36.560
 coming to grips with the idea that you're an agent in the world.

27:37.280 --> 27:42.400
 I find that many highly intelligent people are not very self aware, right? So self awareness

27:42.400 --> 27:47.200
 and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be self aware if you have good priors,

27:47.200 --> 27:52.480
 especially, without being especially intelligent. So you don't need to be very good at solving

27:52.480 --> 27:56.080
 puzzles if the system that you are already implements the solution.

27:56.080 --> 28:03.600
 But I do find intelligence, you kind of mentioned children, right? Is that the fundamental project

28:03.600 --> 28:11.200
 of AI is to create the learning system that's able to exist in the world. So you kind of drew

28:11.200 --> 28:18.320
 a difference between self awareness and intelligence. And yet you said that the self

28:18.320 --> 28:23.600
 awareness seems to be important for children. So I call this ability to make sense of the

28:23.600 --> 28:28.800
 world and your own place in it. So to make you able to understand what you're doing in this world,

28:28.800 --> 28:33.440
 sentience. And I would distinguish sentience from intelligence because sentience is

28:34.560 --> 28:39.200
 possessing certain classes of models. And intelligence is a way to get to these models

28:39.200 --> 28:47.680
 if you don't already have them. I see. So can you maybe pause a bit and try to

28:47.680 --> 28:53.120
 answer the question that we just said we may not be able to answer? And it might be a recursive

28:53.120 --> 28:58.960
 meta question of what is intelligence? I think that intelligence is the ability to make models.

28:59.840 --> 29:08.000
 So models. I think it's useful as examples. Very popular now. Neural networks form representations

29:08.000 --> 29:17.200
 of a large scale data set. They form models of those data sets. When you say models and look

29:17.200 --> 29:21.760
 at today's neural networks, what are the difference of how you're thinking about what is intelligent

29:22.560 --> 29:29.120
 in saying that intelligence is the process of making models? Two aspects to this question. One

29:29.120 --> 29:33.760
 is the representation. Is the representation adequate for the domain that we're talking about?

29:33.760 --> 29:38.800
 One is the representation. Is the representation adequate for the domain that we want to represent?

29:39.920 --> 29:45.760
 The other one is the type of the model that you arrive at adequate. So basically, are you

29:45.760 --> 29:53.200
 modeling the correct domain? I think in both of these cases, modern AI is lacking still. I think

29:53.200 --> 29:58.080
 that I'm not saying anything new here. I'm not criticizing the field. Most of the people that

29:58.080 --> 30:05.040
 design our paradigms are aware of that. One aspect that we're missing is unified learning.

30:05.040 --> 30:10.960
 When we learn, we at some point discover that everything that we sense is part of the same

30:10.960 --> 30:14.800
 object, which means we learn it all into one model and we call this model the universe.

30:14.800 --> 30:19.680
 So the experience of the world that we are embedded on is not a secret direct via to physical

30:19.680 --> 30:24.720
 reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we can never experience or get access to.

30:24.720 --> 30:29.600
 But it has these properties that it can create certain patterns that are systemic interface to

30:29.600 --> 30:33.520
 the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship between the patterns that

30:33.520 --> 30:40.960
 we discover is what we call the physical universe. So at some point in our development as a nervous

30:40.960 --> 30:47.120
 system, we discover that everything that we relate to in the world can be mapped to a region in the

30:47.120 --> 30:52.720
 same three dimensional space, by and large. We now know in physics that this is not quite true.

30:52.720 --> 30:56.960
 The world is not actually three dimensional, but the world that we are entangled with at the level

30:56.960 --> 31:02.720
 which we are entangled with is largely a flat three dimensional space. And so this is the

31:02.720 --> 31:07.840
 model that our brain is intuitively making. And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition

31:07.840 --> 31:12.560
 of res extensa of this material world, this material domain. It's one of the mental domains,

31:12.560 --> 31:17.440
 but it's just the class of all models that relate to this environment, this three dimensional

31:17.440 --> 31:22.800
 physics engine in which we are embedded. Physics engine which we're embedded. I love that. Just

31:22.800 --> 31:32.800
 slowly pause. So the quantum graph, I think you called it, which is the real world, which you

31:32.800 --> 31:37.280
 can never get access to, there's a bunch of questions I want to sort of disentangle that.

31:37.280 --> 31:43.840
 But maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at, can you just describe the basics?

31:43.840 --> 31:49.920
 Can you talk about what is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism? What is functionalism?

31:49.920 --> 31:53.600
 And what connects with you most in terms of, because you just mentioned there's a reality

31:53.600 --> 32:00.160
 we don't have access to. Okay. What does that even mean? And why don't we get access to it?

32:00.160 --> 32:05.040
 Aren't we part of that reality? Why can't we access it? So the particular trajectory that

32:05.040 --> 32:11.120
 mostly exists in the West is the result of our indoctrination by a cult for 2000 years.

32:11.120 --> 32:15.600
 A cult? Which one? Oh, 2000 years. The Catholic cult mostly. And for better or worse,

32:15.600 --> 32:20.800
 it has created or defined many of the modes of interaction that we have that has created

32:20.800 --> 32:29.920
 the society. But it has also in some sense scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists,

32:29.920 --> 32:35.520
 if you would translate the mythology of the Catholic church into the modern world is that

32:35.520 --> 32:41.680
 the world in which you and me interact is something like a multiplayer role playing adventure. And the

32:41.680 --> 32:48.080
 money and the objects that we have in this world, this is all not real. Or as Eastern philosophers

32:48.080 --> 32:54.320
 would say, it's Maya. It's just stuff that appears to be meaningful. And this embedding in this

32:54.320 --> 33:00.160
 meaning, if you believe in it, is samsara. It's basically the identification with the needs of

33:00.160 --> 33:06.880
 the mundane, secular, everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced the notion of

33:06.880 --> 33:12.480
 higher meaning, the sacred. And this existed before, but eventually the natural shape of God

33:12.480 --> 33:17.040
 is the Platonic form of the civilization that you're part of. It's basically the superorganism

33:17.040 --> 33:22.640
 that is formed by the individuals as an intentional agent. And basically, the Catholics

33:22.640 --> 33:28.240
 used a relatively crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and get the

33:28.240 --> 33:34.240
 software synchronized to make them walk on lockstep, to basically get this God online

33:34.240 --> 33:40.320
 and to make it efficient and effective. And I think God technically is just a self that

33:40.320 --> 33:45.280
 spends multiple brains as opposed to your and my self, which mostly exists just on one brain.

33:45.280 --> 33:50.240
 Right? And so in some sense, you can construct a self functionally as a function is implemented

33:50.240 --> 33:54.720
 by brains that exists across brains. And this is a God with a small g.

33:54.720 --> 33:58.720
 That's one of the, if you, Yuval Harari kind of talking about,

33:59.920 --> 34:03.600
 this is one of the nice features of our brains. It seems to that we can

34:03.600 --> 34:07.680
 all download the same piece of software like God in this case and kind of share it.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.440
 Yeah. So basically you give everybody a spec and the mathematical constraints

34:12.240 --> 34:16.080
 that are intrinsic to information processing,

34:16.080 --> 34:20.160
 make sure that given the same spec, you come up with a compatible structure.

34:20.160 --> 34:24.160
 Okay. So that's, there's the space of ideas that we all share. And we think that's kind

34:24.160 --> 34:31.520
 of the mind, but that's separate from the idea is from Christianity for,

34:32.160 --> 34:35.200
 from religion is that there's a separate thing between the mind.

34:35.200 --> 34:39.600
 There is a real world. And this real world is the world in which God exists.

34:39.600 --> 34:45.200
 God is the coder of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.280
 And that's dualism.

34:47.280 --> 34:53.680
 Yes. But the aspect is because the mental realm exists in a different implementation

34:53.680 --> 34:59.280
 than the physical realm. And the mental realm is real. And a lot of people have this intuition

34:59.280 --> 35:04.880
 that there is this real room in which you and me talk and speak right now, then comes a layer of

35:04.880 --> 35:10.160
 physics and abstract rules and so on. And then comes another real room where our souls are

35:10.160 --> 35:14.400
 and our true form isn't a thing that gives us phenomenal experience. And this is, of course,

35:14.400 --> 35:20.880
 a very confused notion that you would get. And it's basically, it's the result of connecting

35:20.880 --> 35:24.800
 materialism and idealism in the wrong way.

35:24.800 --> 35:29.040
 So, okay. I apologize, but I think it's really helpful if we just try to define,

35:30.240 --> 35:34.160
 try to define terms. Like what is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism? For

35:34.160 --> 35:34.960
 people that don't know.

35:34.960 --> 35:40.000
 So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances, a mental

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
 substance and a physical substance. And they interact by different rules. And the physical

35:46.000 --> 35:51.600
 world is basically causally closed and is built on a low level causal structure. So

35:51.600 --> 35:55.520
 they're basically a bottom level that is causally closed. That's entirely mechanical

35:56.160 --> 36:00.240
 and mechanical in the widest sense. So it's computational. There's basically a physical

36:00.240 --> 36:05.200
 world in which information flows around and physics describes the laws of how information

36:05.200 --> 36:06.560
 flows around in this world.

36:06.560 --> 36:10.400
 Would you compare it to like a computer where you have hardware and software?

36:10.400 --> 36:14.080
 The computer is a generalization of information flowing around. Basically,

36:14.080 --> 36:17.760
 but if you want to discover that there is a universal principle, you can define this

36:17.760 --> 36:23.680
 universal machine that is able to perform all the computations. So all these machines

36:23.680 --> 36:27.840
 have the same power. This means that you can always define a translation between them,

36:27.840 --> 36:33.680
 as long as they have unlimited memory to be able to perform each other's computations.

36:33.680 --> 36:38.480
 So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware and

36:38.480 --> 36:40.800
 idealism is this whole world is just the software?

36:40.800 --> 36:46.640
 Not quite. I think that most idealists don't have a notion of software yet because software

36:46.640 --> 36:51.920
 also comes down to information processing. So what you notice is the only thing that

36:51.920 --> 36:56.000
 is real to you and me is this experiential world in which things matter, in which things

36:56.000 --> 36:59.440
 have taste, in which things have color, phenomenal content, and so on.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.160
 You are bringing up consciousness. Okay.

37:02.160 --> 37:07.760
 This is distinct from the physical world in which things have values only in an abstract

37:07.760 --> 37:15.040
 sense. And you only look at cold patterns moving around. So how does anything feel like

37:15.040 --> 37:19.200
 something? And this connection between the two things is very puzzling to a lot of people,

37:19.200 --> 37:23.360
 of course, too many philosophers. So idealism starts out with the notion that mind is primary,

37:23.360 --> 37:30.320
 materialism, things that matter is primary. And so for the idealist, the material patterns that

37:30.320 --> 37:37.120
 we see playing out are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming. And we exist in a mind

37:37.120 --> 37:43.360
 on a higher plane of existence, if you want. And for the materialist, there is only this

37:43.360 --> 37:49.600
 material thing, and that generates some models, and we are the result of these models. And in

37:49.600 --> 37:53.600
 some sense, I don't think that we should understand, if we understand it properly,

37:53.600 --> 37:59.760
 materialism and idealism as a dichotomy, but as two different aspects of the same thing.

37:59.760 --> 38:04.000
 So the weird thing is we don't exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story

38:04.000 --> 38:14.240
 that the brain tells itself. Okay. Let my information processing take that in.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.080
 We don't exist in the physical world. We exist in the narrative.

38:18.080 --> 38:22.160
 Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A neuron cannot feel anything. They're physical

38:22.160 --> 38:26.720
 things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything. But it would be very useful for the

38:26.720 --> 38:30.960
 brain or for the organism to know what it would be like to be a person and to feel something.

38:30.960 --> 38:36.720
 Yeah. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the interactions

38:36.720 --> 38:41.680
 of the person. It's the best model of what that brain, this organism thinks it is in relationship

38:41.680 --> 38:46.000
 to its environment. So it creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain

38:46.000 --> 38:49.120
 is continuously writing and updating. But you also kind of said that

38:50.000 --> 38:53.760
 you said that we kind of exist in that story. Yes.

38:53.760 --> 39:04.800
 In that story. What is real in any of this? So again, these terms are... You kind of said

39:04.800 --> 39:10.080
 there's a quantum graph. I mean, what is this whole thing running on then? Is the story...

39:11.040 --> 39:16.640
 And is it completely fundamentally impossible to get access to it? Because isn't the story

39:16.640 --> 39:24.560
 supposed to... Isn't the brain in something existing in some kind of context?

39:24.560 --> 39:30.640
 So what we can identify as computer scientists, we can engineer systems and test our theories this

39:30.640 --> 39:36.480
 way that might have the necessary insufficient properties to produce the phenomena that we are

39:36.480 --> 39:44.240
 observing, which is the self in a virtual world that is generated in somebody's neocortex that is

39:44.240 --> 39:48.480
 contained in the skull of this primate here. And when I point at this, this indexicality is of

39:48.480 --> 39:55.440
 course wrong. But I do create something that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina

39:55.440 --> 40:00.480
 that allow you to interpret what I'm saying. But we both know that the world that you and me are

40:00.480 --> 40:05.760
 seeing is not the real physical world. What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your

40:05.760 --> 40:10.000
 brain to explain the patterns on your retina. How close is it to the real world? That's kind

40:10.000 --> 40:18.400
 of the question. Is it when you have people like Donald Hoffman that say that you're really far

40:18.400 --> 40:24.160
 away. The thing we're seeing, you and I now, that interface we have is very far away from anything.

40:24.960 --> 40:29.840
 We don't even have anything close to the sense of what the real world is. Or is it a very surface

40:29.840 --> 40:35.840
 piece of architecture? I imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal, this famous thing that

40:35.840 --> 40:43.040
 Bernard Mandelbrot discovered. You see an overall shape in there. But if you truly understand it,

40:43.040 --> 40:50.080
 you know it's two lines of code. It's basically in a series that is being tested for complex

40:50.080 --> 40:55.520
 numbers in the complex number plane for every point. And for those where the series is diverging,

40:56.240 --> 41:04.160
 you paint this black. And where it's converging, you don't. And you get the intermediate colors

41:04.160 --> 41:13.040
 by taking how far it diverges. This gives you this shape of this fractal. But imagine you live

41:13.040 --> 41:18.160
 inside of this fractal and you don't have access to where you are in the fractal. Or you have not

41:18.160 --> 41:23.520
 discovered the generator function even. So what you see is, all I can see right now is a spiral.

41:23.520 --> 41:28.000
 And this spiral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate model of reality? Yes, it is.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.680
 It is an adequate description. You know that there is actually no spiral in the Mandelbrot fractal.

41:33.680 --> 41:39.200
 It only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting things as a two dimensional space and

41:39.200 --> 41:44.000
 then defines certain regularities in there at a certain scale that it currently observes. Because

41:44.000 --> 41:47.680
 if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear and turn out to be something different at a different

41:47.680 --> 41:52.240
 resolution. So at this level, you have the spiral. And then you discover the spiral moves to the

41:52.240 --> 41:56.960
 right and at some point it disappears. So you have a singularity. At this point, your model is no

41:56.960 --> 42:01.520
 longer valid. You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity. But you can observe again

42:01.520 --> 42:06.320
 and you will see it hit another spiral and at this point it disappeared. So we now have a second

42:06.320 --> 42:11.040
 order law. And if you make 30 layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world

42:11.040 --> 42:14.720
 that is similar to the one that we come up with when we describe the reality around us.

42:14.720 --> 42:19.440
 It's reasonably predictive. It does not cut to the core of it. It does not explain how it's

42:19.440 --> 42:24.560
 being generated, how it actually works. But it's relatively good to explain the universe that we

42:24.560 --> 42:28.560
 are entangled with. But you don't think the tools of computer science, the tools of physics could

42:28.560 --> 42:35.040
 get, could step outside, see the whole drawing and get at the basic mechanism of how the pattern,

42:35.040 --> 42:40.320
 the spirals are generated. Imagine you would find yourself embedded into a motherboard fractal and

42:40.320 --> 42:46.000
 you try to figure out what works and you somehow have a Turing machine with enough memory to think.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.920
 And as a result, you come to this idea, it must be some kind of automaton. And maybe you just

42:51.920 --> 42:56.320
 enumerate all the possible automata until you get to the one that produces your reality.

42:56.320 --> 42:59.920
 So you can identify necessary and sufficient condition. For instance,

42:59.920 --> 43:05.440
 we discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages. And then we see that most of

43:05.440 --> 43:10.320
 the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing the same fractals.

43:10.320 --> 43:14.320
 This is what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different domains to each

43:14.320 --> 43:19.360
 other. So they're not that many fractals. And some of these have interesting structure and

43:19.360 --> 43:26.480
 symmetry breaks. And so you can discover what region of this global fractal you might be embedded

43:26.480 --> 43:31.200
 in from first principles. But the only way you can get there is from first principles. So basically

43:31.200 --> 43:35.760
 your understanding of the universe has to start with automata and then number theory and then

43:35.760 --> 43:41.520
 spaces and so on. Yeah. I think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams that he'll be able to arrive

43:41.520 --> 43:46.560
 at the fundamental rules of the cellular automata or the generalization of which

43:46.560 --> 43:54.160
 is behind our universe. Yeah. You've said on this topic, you said in a recent conversation

43:54.160 --> 44:00.560
 that quote, some people think that a simulation can't be conscious and only a physical system can,

44:00.560 --> 44:05.920
 but they got it completely backward. A physical system cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can

44:05.920 --> 44:11.920
 be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property that simulates itself. Just like you said,

44:11.920 --> 44:17.920
 the mind is kind of the, we'll call it story narrative. There's a simulation. So our mind

44:17.920 --> 44:24.560
 is essentially a simulation. Usually I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically

44:24.560 --> 44:28.960
 a principles that produce the simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain.

44:29.760 --> 44:36.560
 And the mind is creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that

44:36.560 --> 44:41.600
 is on the other side of attention and is embedded in this world. Why is that important that

44:41.600 --> 44:48.160
 idea of a self, why is that an important feature in the simulation? It's basically a result of

44:48.160 --> 44:53.120
 the purpose that the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We

44:53.120 --> 44:59.760
 are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is

45:00.560 --> 45:06.240
 the relationship of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of

45:06.240 --> 45:12.400
 other organisms. And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to.

45:12.400 --> 45:16.640
 These regulation targets start with priors. They're basically like unconditional reflexes

45:16.640 --> 45:20.480
 that we are more or less born with. And then we can reverse engineer them to make them more

45:20.480 --> 45:24.720
 consistent. And then we get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with

45:24.720 --> 45:31.040
 it. And so these priors that you commit to are largely target values that our needs should

45:31.040 --> 45:38.160
 approach set points. And this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension. And we find

45:38.160 --> 45:42.640
 ourselves living inside of feedback loops, right? Consciousness emerges over dimensions of

45:42.640 --> 45:48.000
 disagreements with the universe, things that you care, things are not the way they should be,

45:48.000 --> 45:52.560
 but you need to regulate. And so in some sense, the sense self is the result of all the

45:52.560 --> 45:56.560
 identifications that you're having. And that identification is a regulation target that

45:56.560 --> 46:01.440
 you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about, you think is important. And this is

46:01.440 --> 46:07.040
 also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments, of these identifications, you get

46:07.040 --> 46:12.000
 free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them, you're completely

46:12.000 --> 46:17.120
 free and you can enter nirvana because you're done. And actually, this is a good time to pause and say

46:17.920 --> 46:23.440
 thank you to a friend of mine, Gustav Soderström, who introduced me to your work. I wanted to give

46:23.440 --> 46:29.360
 him a shout out. He's a brilliant guy. And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing. And

46:29.360 --> 46:34.160
 Gustav is a good representative of that. You are as well. So I'm glad, first of all, I'm glad the

46:34.160 --> 46:40.640
 internet exists, YouTube exists, where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study

46:40.640 --> 46:46.800
 your writing and think about, you know, that's amazing. Okay. But you've kind of described

46:46.800 --> 46:52.720
 sort of this emergent phenomenon of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard

46:52.720 --> 47:02.960
 problem of consciousness? Can you just linger on it? Why does it still feel like, I understand

47:02.960 --> 47:08.800
 you're kind of, the self is an important part of the simulation, but why does the simulation

47:08.800 --> 47:14.880
 feel like something? So if you look at a book by, say, George R. R. Martin, where the characters

47:14.880 --> 47:19.840
 have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below

47:19.840 --> 47:23.520
 the hill and they're done in it. And they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive

47:24.080 --> 47:27.920
 and feel empowered and all these things. Why do they have these emotions? It's because it's

47:27.920 --> 47:32.080
 written into the story, right? And it's written to the story because there's an adequate model of the

47:32.080 --> 47:37.680
 person that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing is true for us. So it's

47:37.680 --> 47:43.040
 basically a story that our brain is writing. It's not written in words. It's written in perceptual

47:43.040 --> 47:50.560
 content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what the person would feel if it existed.

47:50.560 --> 47:56.160
 So it's a virtual person. And you and me happen to be this virtual person. So this virtual person

47:56.160 --> 48:01.120
 gets access to the language center and talks about the sky being blue. And this is us.

48:01.760 --> 48:05.440
 But hold on a second. Do I exist in your simulation?

48:05.440 --> 48:13.120
 You do exist in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less

48:13.120 --> 48:20.640
 accessible for me that you have and so on. And my model might not be completely adequate.

48:20.640 --> 48:25.120
 There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense,

48:25.120 --> 48:31.360
 both you and me are some puppets, two puppets that enact a play in my mind. And I identify

48:31.360 --> 48:36.080
 with one of them because I can control one of the puppets directly. And with the other one,

48:36.080 --> 48:41.680
 I can create things in between. So for instance, we can go on an interaction that even leads to

48:41.680 --> 48:46.400
 a coupling to a feedback loop. So we can think things together in a certain way or feel things

48:46.400 --> 48:50.880
 together. But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon. It's entirely a software

48:50.880 --> 48:54.960
 phenomenon. It's the result of two different implementations interacting with each other.

48:54.960 --> 49:02.080
 So that's interesting. So are you suggesting, like the way you think about it, is the entirety

49:02.080 --> 49:07.520
 of existence a simulation and where kind of each mind is a little subsimulation,

49:08.640 --> 49:17.920
 that like, why don't you, why doesn't your mind have access to my mind's full state?

49:18.640 --> 49:22.880
 Like, for the same reason that my mind doesn't have access to its own full state.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.760
 So what, I mean,

49:25.760 --> 49:29.280
 There is no trick involved. So basically, when I know something about myself,

49:29.280 --> 49:33.760
 it's because I made a model. So one part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other parts of

49:33.760 --> 49:35.200
 your brain are doing.

49:35.200 --> 49:40.480
 Yes. But there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world in the physical

49:40.480 --> 49:46.560
 sense that there's repeatable experiments and so on. How does that fit into our silly,

49:46.560 --> 49:50.960
 the center of apes simulation of the world? So why is it so repeatable? Why is everything so

49:50.960 --> 49:58.080
 repeatable? And not everything. There's a lot of fundamental physics experiments that are repeatable

49:59.520 --> 50:05.040
 for a long time, all over the place and so on. Laws of physics. How does that fit in?

50:05.040 --> 50:09.600
 It seems that the parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long lived.

50:10.320 --> 50:17.040
 So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something,

50:17.040 --> 50:22.880
 you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics.

50:23.520 --> 50:28.000
 So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result of usually of some

50:28.000 --> 50:32.640
 control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors. And the things that

50:32.640 --> 50:37.200
 are not stable that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on, they tend to get

50:37.200 --> 50:44.400
 weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that sustains complexity, which is

50:44.400 --> 50:50.160
 required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe that is very

50:50.160 --> 50:55.680
 tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of interesting symmetries and also

50:55.680 --> 51:02.800
 symmetry breaks that allow the creation of structure. But they exist where? So there's

51:02.800 --> 51:06.240
 such an interesting idea that our mind is simulation that's constructing the narrative.

51:06.240 --> 51:14.880
 But my question is, just to try to understand how that fits with this, with the entirety of the

51:14.880 --> 51:19.360
 universe, you're saying that there's a region of this universe that allows enough complexity to

51:19.360 --> 51:27.280
 create creatures like us. But what's the connection between the brain, the mind, and the broader

51:27.280 --> 51:32.720
 universe? Which comes first? Which is more fundamental? Is the mind the starting point,

51:32.720 --> 51:36.880
 the universe is emergent? Is the universe the starting point, the minds are emergent?

51:37.680 --> 51:42.480
 I think quite clearly the latter. That's at least a much easier explanation because it allows us to

51:42.480 --> 51:47.440
 make causal models. And I don't see any way to construct an inverse causality.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.320
 So what happens when you die to your mind simulation?

51:51.760 --> 51:57.600
 My implementation ceases. So basically the thing that implements myself will no longer be present,

51:57.600 --> 52:01.680
 which means if I am not implemented on the minds of other people, the thing that I identify with,

52:01.680 --> 52:07.680
 the weird thing is I don't actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct.

52:07.680 --> 52:14.160
 If I was the Dalai Lama, he identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama gets

52:14.160 --> 52:21.760
 reborn, not because he's confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being. He runs on

52:21.760 --> 52:27.040
 a human being. He's basically a governmental software that is instantiated in every new

52:27.040 --> 52:31.680
 generation and you. So his advice is to pick someone who does this in the next generation.

52:31.680 --> 52:37.280
 So if you identify with this, you are no longer a human and you don't die in the sense that what

52:37.280 --> 52:42.320
 dies is only the body of the human that you run on. To kill the Dalai Lama, you would have to kill

52:42.320 --> 52:48.160
 his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small part like this,

52:48.160 --> 52:53.360
 most of us. So for instance, if you have children, you realize something lives on in them. Or if you

52:53.360 --> 52:58.400
 spark an idea in the world, something lives on, or if you identify with the society around you,

52:58.400 --> 53:01.280
 because you are in part that you're not just this human being.

53:01.280 --> 53:07.040
 Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama in the sense that you,

53:07.040 --> 53:12.160
 Joshua Bach, is just a collection of ideas. So like you have this operating system on which

53:12.160 --> 53:16.640
 a bunch of ideas live and interact. And then once you die, they kind of part, some of them

53:17.760 --> 53:18.880
 jump off the ship.

53:18.880 --> 53:23.360
 You put it put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction.

53:23.360 --> 53:27.920
 It's not physically real. Identity is not a physical concept.

53:27.920 --> 53:31.280
 It's basically a representation of different objects on the same world line.

53:32.160 --> 53:41.120
 But identity lives and dies. Are you attached? What's the fundamental thing? Is it the ideas

53:41.120 --> 53:46.400
 that come together to form identity? Or is each individual identity actually a fundamental thing?

53:46.400 --> 53:49.920
 It's a representation that you can get agency over if you care. So basically,

53:49.920 --> 53:53.120
 you can choose what you identify with if you want to.

53:53.120 --> 54:04.400
 No, but it just seems if the mind is not real, that the birth and death is not a crucial part

54:04.400 --> 54:16.000
 of it. Well, maybe I'm silly. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism. But it seems

54:16.000 --> 54:23.840
 that being a physical object in this world is an important aspect of birth and death.

54:23.840 --> 54:29.120
 Like it feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die.

54:30.000 --> 54:34.640
 The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the real

54:34.640 --> 54:40.560
 world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to model reality with

54:40.560 --> 54:45.920
 oscillators. So colors and sound in some sense have octaves, and it's because they are represented

54:45.920 --> 54:52.320
 probably with oscillators. So that's why colors form a circle of use. And colors have harmonics,

54:52.320 --> 54:58.240
 sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing oscillators in the brain. So the world that we

54:58.240 --> 55:03.680
 subjectively interact with is fundamentally the result of the representation mechanisms in our

55:03.680 --> 55:08.000
 brain. They are mathematically to some degree universal. There are certain regularities that

55:08.000 --> 55:12.720
 you can discover in the patterns and not others. But the patterns that we get, this is not the real

55:12.720 --> 55:18.400
 world. The world that we interact with is always made of too many parts to count. So when you look

55:18.400 --> 55:23.440
 at this table and so on, it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count

55:23.440 --> 55:29.120
 them. So you only look at the aggregate dynamics, at limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely

55:29.120 --> 55:34.400
 many particles, what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get. So

55:34.400 --> 55:38.880
 geometry that we are interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that

55:39.680 --> 55:44.480
 work in the limit that you get by building an infinite series that converges. For those parts

55:44.480 --> 55:48.400
 where it converges, it's geometry. For those parts where it doesn't converge, it's chaos.

55:48.960 --> 55:55.200
 Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the consciousness that's emergent in our

55:55.200 --> 56:00.000
 narrative. The consciousness gives it color, gives it feeling, gives it flavor.

56:00.000 --> 56:06.720
 So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has to all the

56:06.720 --> 56:12.720
 other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color

56:12.720 --> 56:18.720
 is given by those aspects of the representation or this experiential color where you care about,

56:18.720 --> 56:22.880
 where you have identifications, where something means something, where you are the inside of a

56:22.880 --> 56:28.320
 feedback loop. And the dimensions of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system

56:28.320 --> 56:34.880
 that we emerge over. The meaning of the relations, the graph. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

56:34.880 --> 56:41.120
 Like where does the, maybe we can even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness to

56:41.120 --> 56:47.120
 be sort of more systematic. Like what do you, how do you think about consciousness?

56:47.120 --> 56:52.240
 I think that consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism

56:52.240 --> 56:58.000
 that has evolved for a certain type of learning. At the moment, our machine learning systems

56:58.000 --> 57:05.120
 largely work by building chains of weighted sums of real numbers with some nonlinearity.

57:05.120 --> 57:13.360
 And you learn by piping an error signal through these different chained layers and adjusting the

57:13.360 --> 57:18.720
 weights in these weighted sums. And you can approximate most polynomials with this

57:19.680 --> 57:24.640
 if you have enough training data. But the price is you need to change a lot of these weights.

57:24.640 --> 57:30.000
 Basically, the error is piped backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures

57:30.000 --> 57:34.800
 in the network. And everything else evens out statistically. And only at these junctures,

57:34.800 --> 57:38.320
 this is where you had the actual error in the network, you make the change there. This is a

57:38.320 --> 57:42.720
 very slow process. And our brains don't have enough time for that because we don't get old

57:42.720 --> 57:47.600
 enough to play Go the way that our machines learn to play Go. So instead, what we do is

57:47.600 --> 57:52.960
 an attention based learning. We pinpoint the probable region in the network where we can

57:52.960 --> 57:58.800
 make an improvement. And then we store this binding state together with the expected outcome

57:58.800 --> 58:03.600
 in a protocol. And this ability to make index memories for the purpose of learning to revisit

58:03.600 --> 58:10.160
 these commitments later, this requires a memory of the contents of our attention.

58:10.160 --> 58:15.120
 Another aspect is when I construct my reality, I make mistakes. So I see things that turn out to

58:15.120 --> 58:20.400
 be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features of

58:20.400 --> 58:27.360
 my perception gave rise to a present construction of reality. So the system needs to pay attention to

58:28.000 --> 58:33.360
 the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs to pay attention to whether

58:33.360 --> 58:37.200
 it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system gets trained with the same

58:37.200 --> 58:41.840
 mechanism, so it's reflexive, but also in part because your attention lapses if you don't pay

58:41.840 --> 58:46.960
 attention to the attention itself. So it's the thing that I'm currently seeing, just a dream

58:46.960 --> 58:52.000
 that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream, or am I still paying attention to my

58:52.000 --> 58:56.800
 percept? So you have to periodically go back and see whether you're still paying attention. And

58:56.800 --> 59:01.520
 if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the system becoming aware of the contents

59:01.520 --> 59:05.680
 of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention itself and makes attention the object

59:05.680 --> 59:12.720
 of its attention, I think this is the loop over which we wake up. So there's this attentional

59:12.720 --> 59:18.720
 mechanism that's somehow self referential that's fundamental to what consciousness is. So just

59:19.600 --> 59:23.760
 ask you a question, I don't know how much you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural

59:23.760 --> 59:28.640
 language processing, they use attentional mechanism, they use something called transformers to

59:31.040 --> 59:37.920
 learn patterns and sentences by allowing the network to focus its attention to particular

59:37.920 --> 59:42.960
 parts of the sentence and each individual. So like parameterize and make it learnable

59:42.960 --> 59:51.200
 the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window into the sentence. Do you think

59:51.200 --> 59:58.160
 that's like a little step towards that eventually will take us to the attentional mechanisms from

59:58.160 --> 1:00:03.600
 which consciousness can emerge? Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:08.960
 In the early days of automated language translation, there was an example that I

1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:13.840
 found particularly funny where somebody tried to translate a text from English into German

1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:20.160
 and it was a bat broke the window. And the translation in German was

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:31.520
 to translate back into English a bat, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bat.

1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:34.160
 Yes. And it seemed to be the

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:39.840
 most similar to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating the

1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:45.280
 concept bat into German in the same sentence. And this is a mistake that the transformer model is

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:49.840
 not doing because it's tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism in the transformer

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:56.160
 model is basically putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up

1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:01.600
 later in the text and tracks basically the individuals through the text. And it's why

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:07.120
 the system can learn things that other systems couldn't before it, which makes it, for instance,

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:10.960
 possible to write a text where it talks about the scientist, then the scientist has a name

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:16.160
 and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story about that thing. What it does not do,

1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:20.800
 it doesn't fully integrate this. So this meaning falls apart at some point, it loses track of this

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:25.920
 context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says has to refer to the same universe.

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:31.520
 And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention in the transformer model does not go

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:36.240
 beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an important part of attention, but it's a

1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:41.360
 different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it's not the one that gives rise to the type

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:44.800
 of consciousness that we have. Just to linger on, what do you mean by

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:49.360
 identity in the context of language? So when you talk about language,

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.640
 you have different words that can refer to the same concept.

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:53.680
 Got it. And in the sense that...

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:59.040
 The space of concepts. So... Yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:05.520
 or in an inexical sense that you say this word does not only refer to this class of objects,

1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:11.520
 but it refers to a definite object, to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story.

1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:16.720
 And it's only referred by different ways in the language. So the language is basically a

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:23.680
 projection from a conceptual representation from a scene that is evolving into a discrete string

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:29.680
 of symbols. And what the transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:34.720
 mechanism that other models couldn't learn. So have you ever seen an artificial intelligence

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:40.720
 or any kind of construction idea that allows for, unlike neural networks or perhaps within

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:47.440
 neural networks, that's able to form something where the space of concepts continues to be

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:54.080
 integrated? So what you're describing, building a knowledge base, building this consistent,

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:58.240
 larger and larger sets of ideas that would then allow for deeper understanding.

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:02.640
 Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything from language,

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:07.360
 from basically a logical grammatical construct. And I think to some degree,

1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:12.560
 this was also what Minsky believed. So that's why he focused so much on common sense reasoning and

1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:19.600
 so on. And a project that was inspired by him was Psych. That was basically going on.

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.600
 Yes. Of course, ideas don't die. Only people die.

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:26.400
 That's true.

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:30.960
 And Alt Psych is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:35.440
 converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve,

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:40.080
 and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations,

1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:44.960
 was the notion of images. So images play an important role in Tractatus. The Tractatus is

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:49.360
 an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language, to design a logical

1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:54.240
 language in which you can do actual philosophy that's rich enough for doing this. And the

1:03:54.240 --> 1:04:00.480
 difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually, I think he decided that he was

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:06.400
 not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the logitist program in AI.

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:11.280
 And the solution, as we see it today, is we need more general function approximation. There are

1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:16.960
 geometric functions that we learn to approximate that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed

1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:22.240
 in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory and so on

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:26.080
 to learn in algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry.

1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:31.200
 But to equate language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it.

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:37.360
 So function, well, you kind of just said that neural networks are sort of, the approach that

1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:44.640
 neural networks takes is actually more general than what can be expressed through language.

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:49.840
 Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed through language at the data rates at which

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:51.360
 we process grammatical language?

1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:56.880
 Okay. So you don't think languages, so you disagree with Wittgenstein,

1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:58.720
 that language is not fundamental to...

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.960
 I agree with Wittgenstein. I just agree with the late Wittgenstein.

1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:09.520
 And I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the Tractatus itself

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:13.040
 is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was written in the 20th century.

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:18.480
 But language is not fundamental to cognition and intelligence and consciousness.

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:23.520
 So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we're using is a

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:28.800
 particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:35.040
 in which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:41.120
 differently, more general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a model is you

1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:47.280
 have a bunch of parameters. These have a range, these are the variances of the world, and you have

1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:52.400
 relationships between them, which are constraints, which say if certain parameters have these values,

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:58.880
 then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very early insight in

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:03.600
 computer science. And I think some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine.

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:07.680
 And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that it has a measure of whether it's good. This

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:11.600
 is basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the constraints

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.960
 where the constraints don't quite match. It's very difficult to, despite having this global

1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:22.720
 measure, to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially few elements,

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:26.880
 parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:34.960
 And so the solution that Hinton and Zanofsky found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine,

1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:39.760
 which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine and only has

1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:44.960
 basically input and output layer. But this limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machine. So now

1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:50.320
 he builds a network of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense, you can see almost

1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:53.840
 continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we're using today,

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:58.400
 even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the Boltzmann

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:02.640
 machine is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception, and this forces

1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:06.240
 the entire machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:12.960
 perceive. And this state is your model of the world. I think it's a very general way of thinking

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:19.920
 about models, but we have to use a different approach to make it work. We have to find

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:23.920
 different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that trains the Boltzmann

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:27.680
 machine and the mechanism that makes the Boltzmann machine settle into its state

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:31.760
 are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine itself.

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:36.480
 The kind of mechanisms that we want to develop, you're saying?

1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:40.320
 Yes. So the direction in which I think our research is going to go

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:45.920
 is going to, for instance, what you notice in perception is our perceptual models of the world

1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:50.880
 are not probabilistic, but possibilistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that

1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:57.200
 are improbable, but possible. A perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's

1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:02.560
 possible, if it's coherent. So if you see a tiger coming after you, you should be able to see this

1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:09.120
 even if it's unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the model. So

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:15.520
 given the state of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features,

1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:20.960
 how should you change the states of the model to get it to converge with your perception?

1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:29.680
 But the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing

1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:34.160
 is perhaps not as large. I mean, that's perhaps pretty small.

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:39.280
 The degree of coherence that you need to achieve depends, of course, how deep your models go.

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:44.560
 That is, for instance, politics is very simple when you know very little about game theory and

1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.040
 human nature. So the younger you are, the more obvious it is how politics would work, right?

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:55.520
 And because you get a coherent aesthetics from relatively few inputs. And the more layers you

1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:00.880
 model, the more layers you model reality, the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints.

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:07.040
 So, you know, the current neural networks are fundamentally supervised learning system with

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:12.240
 a feed forward neural network is back propagation to learn. What's your intuition about what kind

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:17.840
 of mechanisms might we move towards to improve the learning procedure?

1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:22.960
 I think one big aspect is going to be meta learning and architecture search starts in

1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:28.560
 this direction. In some sense, the first wave of classical AI work by identifying a problem

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:32.240
 and a possible solution and implementing the solution, right? A program that plays chess.

1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:37.840
 And right now we are in the second wave of AI. So instead of writing the algorithm that

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:41.600
 implements the solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches

1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.400
 for an algorithm that implements the solution. So the learning system in some sense is an

1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:51.600
 algorithm that itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem, like Go. Go is too hard

1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:56.240
 to implement the solution by hand, but we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution.

1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:00.880
 Yeah. So now let's move to the third stage, right? The third stage would be meta learning.

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:05.040
 Find an algorithm that discovers a learning algorithm for the given domain.

1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:08.000
 Our brain is probably not a learning system, but a meta learning system.

1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:13.840
 This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way. If you look at the way our

1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:18.160
 brain is, for instance, implemented, there is no central control that tells all the neurons how

1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:24.000
 to wire up. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is a

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.160
 single celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fed.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:36.160
 And it gets fed if it fires on average at the right time. And the right time depends on the

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:42.080
 context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:48.240
 So it basically has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire to get fed.

1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:52.720
 Or if you see it as a reinforcement learning agent, every neuron is in some sense making a

1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:57.440
 hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to pipe a signal through the universe and tries to

1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:02.560
 get positive feedback for it. And the entire thing is set up in such a way that it's robustly

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:07.200
 self organizing into a brain, which means you start out with different neuron types

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.080
 that have different priors on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward.

1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.320
 And you put them into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment,

1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:22.080
 and then you entrain it in a particular order. And as a result, you get a well organized brain.

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:29.120
 Yeah, so okay, so the brain is a meta learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning

1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:40.000
 agents. And what I think you said, but just to clarify, there's no centralized government that

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:48.240
 tells you, here's a loss function, here's a loss function, here's a loss function. Who says what's

1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:52.560
 the objective? There are also governments which impose loss functions on different parts of the

1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:56.880
 brain. So we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain get specially rewarded when

1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:00.960
 you look at faces. If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia, which basically

1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:07.360
 the inability to tell people apart by their faces. And the reason that happens is because

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:12.240
 it had an evolutionary advantage. So like evolution comes into play here. But it's basically an

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:17.440
 extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don't think that people with prosopagnosia have a

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:22.240
 perceived defective brain, the brain just has an average attention for faces. So people with

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:27.040
 prosopagnosia don't look at faces more than they look at cups. So the level at which they resolve

1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:33.200
 the geometry of faces is not higher than for cups. And people that don't have prosopagnosia look

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:38.080
 obsessively at faces, right? For you and me, it's impossible to move through a crowd

1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:43.440
 without scanning the faces. And as a result, we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow

1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:49.840
 us to discern mental states of people. So obviously, we don't know 99% of the details

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:55.920
 of this meta learning system. That's our mind. Okay. But still, we took a leap from something

1:12:55.920 --> 1:13:04.000
 much dumber to that from through the evolutionary process. Can you first of all, maybe say how hard

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:13.840
 the, how big of a leap is that from our brain, from our ancestors to multi cell organisms? And

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:21.680
 is there something we can think about? As we start to think about how to engineer intelligence,

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:28.880
 is there something we can learn from evolution? In some sense, life exists because of the market

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:34.960
 opportunity of controlled chemical reactions. We compete with dump chemical reactions and we win

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:40.000
 in some areas against this dump combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients where you

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.640
 need to add a little bit of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy. So we out competed

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:49.520
 combustion. Yes, in many regions we do and we try very hard because when we are in direct

1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:55.120
 competition, we lose, right? So because the combustion is going to close the entropy

1:13:55.120 --> 1:14:02.800
 gradients much faster than we can run. So basically we do this because every cell has

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:07.520
 a Turing machine built into it. It's like literally a read write head on the tape.

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:15.280
 So everything that's more complicated than a molecule that just is a vortex around attractors

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:21.920
 that needs a Turing machine for its regulation. And then you bind cells together and you get next

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:26.160
 level organizational organism where the cells together implement some kind of software.

1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:33.120
 For me, a very interesting discovery in the last year was the word spirit because I realized that

1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:38.640
 what spirit actually means is an operating system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:43.520
 invented, people needed this word. But they didn't have robots that they built themselves yet. The

1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:48.080
 only autonomous robots that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities,

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:53.040
 and so on. And they all had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant has an operating

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:57.280
 system, right? If you pinch the plant in one area, then it's going to have repercussions

1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:02.160
 throughout the plant. Everything in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.560
 like in other organisms. An organism is not a collection of cells, it's a function that

1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:13.600
 tells cells how to behave. And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing,

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:19.360
 like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each cell with each

1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:30.400
 other cell. Oh my God. So what you're saying is the organism is a function that tells what to do

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:39.840
 and the function emerges from the interaction of the cells. Yes. So it's basically a description

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:46.640
 of what the plant is doing in terms of microstates. And the microstates, the physical implementation

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:51.760
 are too many of them to describe them. So the software that we use to describe what the plant is

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:57.520
 doing, the spirit of the plant is the software, the operating system of the plant, right? This is

1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:03.120
 a way in which we, the observers, make sense of the plant. And the same is true for people. So

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:07.120
 people have spirits, which is their operating system in a way, right? And there's aspects of

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:12.080
 that operating system that relate to how your body functions and others, how you socially interact,

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:18.480
 how you interact with yourself and so on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it's a

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:24.320
 loaded term because it's from a pre scientific age. But it took the scientific age a long time

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:29.440
 to rediscover a term that is pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the differences that we

1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:33.840
 still see between the old word and the new word are translation errors that have happened over

1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:39.760
 the centuries. Can you actually linger on that? Why do you say that spirit, just to clarify,

1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:45.120
 because I'm a little bit confused. So the word spirit is a powerful thing. But why did you say

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:50.160
 in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:56.240
 spirit? I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality in the US,

1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:00.240
 it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture.

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:06.880
 And a culture is in some sense, you could say the spirit of a society that is long game. This thing

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:12.720
 that is become self aware at a level above the individuals where you say, if you don't do the

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:16.960
 following things, then the grand, grand, grand grandchildren of our children will have nothing

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:22.800
 to eat. So if you take this long scope, where you try to maximize the length of the game that you

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:27.040
 are playing as a species, you realize that you're part of a larger thing that you cannot fully

1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:32.560
 control. You probably need to submit to the ecosphere instead of trying to completely control

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:38.480
 it. There needs to be a certain level at which we can exist as a species if you want to endure.

1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:44.320
 And our culture is not sustaining this anymore. We basically made this bet with the industrial

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:48.800
 revolution that we can control everything. And the modernist societies with basically unfettered

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:54.800
 growth led to a situation in which we depend on the ability to control the entire planet.

1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:00.960
 And since we are not able to do that, as it seems, this culture will die. And we realize that it

1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:06.320
 doesn't have a future, right? We called our children generation Z. That's a very optimistic

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:13.920
 thing to do. Yeah. So you can have this kind of intuition that our civilization, you said culture,

1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:22.640
 but you really mean the spirit of the civilization, the entirety of the civilization may not exist

1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:29.840
 for long. Yeah. Can you untangle that? What's your intuition behind that? So you kind of offline

1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:35.440
 mentioned to me that the industrial revolution was kind of the moment we agreed to accept

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:42.640
 the offer sign on the paper on the dotted line with the industrial revolution, we doomed ourselves.

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:47.520
 Can you elaborate on that? This is a suspicion. I, of course, don't know how it plays out. But

1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:55.840
 it seems to me that in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over an entropic abyss

1:18:55.840 --> 1:19:00.560
 without land on the other side, it's relatively clear that your cantilever is at some point

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:06.240
 going to break down into this entropic abyss. And you have to pay the bill. Okay. Russia is

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:13.840
 my first language. And I'm also an idiot. Me too. This is just two apes.

1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:21.840
 Instead of playing with a banana, trying to have fun by talking. Okay. Anthropic what? And what's

1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:29.200
 entropic? Entropic. So entropic in the sense of entropy. Oh, entropic. Got it. And entropic,

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:35.360
 what was the other word you used? Abyss. What's that? It's a big gorge. Oh, abyss. Abyss, yes.

1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:39.920
 Entropic abyss. So many of the things you say are poetic. It's hurting my ears. And this one

1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:50.080
 is amazing, right? It's mispronounced, which makes you more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So

1:19:50.080 --> 1:19:58.320
 entropic abyss. Okay. Let's rewind then. The industrial revolution. So how does that get us

1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:04.640
 into the entropic abyss? So in some sense, we burned a hundred million years worth of trees

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:10.480
 to get everybody plumbing. Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:18.560
 of people. So basically since zero BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. Yes. And this

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:24.480
 only changed with the enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution. And in some

1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:30.560
 sense, the enlightenment freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the preexisting order

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:35.600
 gradually. It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops. So it was not that

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:41.440
 just one caused the other. It was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:48.560
 increasing productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the

1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:55.760
 definition of poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die, which is

1:20:55.760 --> 1:21:01.600
 in some sense, the state that all animals on earth are in. The definition of poverty is having

1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:06.480
 enough. So you can have only so many children as you can feed and if you have more, they die. Yes.

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:12.240
 And in our societies, you can basically have as many children as you want, they don't die. Right.

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:17.680
 So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to pay a price

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:22.080
 in terms of we have to insert ourselves in a lower social stratum if we have too many children.

1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:28.240
 So basically everybody in the under middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of

1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:33.680
 children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to the individual families.

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:39.040
 Yes. Because children, especially in the US, super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:43.440
 this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you're super poor, it doesn't

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:48.080
 matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change. And these children allow

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:54.320
 you not going to die of hunger. So how does this lead to self destruction? So there's a lot of

1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:58.800
 unpleasant properties about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to

1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:06.240
 let our children survive, even if they have diseases. Like I would have died before my

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:12.080
 mid twenties without modern medicine. And most of my friends would have as well. And so many of us

1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:18.880
 wouldn't live without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialized society. We

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:25.760
 get our protein largely by subduing the entirety of nature. Imagine there would be some very clever

1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:32.960
 microbe that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into a

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:38.640
 thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that for instance,

1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.440
 brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:47.600
 and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a

1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:52.000
 vegetable that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:57.280
 environment changes. Yeah, but some part of that organism, the one that's actually doing all the

1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:04.560
 using of the, there'll still be somebody thriving. So it relates back to this original question

1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:10.400
 I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every complex

1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:17.840
 system has to have some complex regulation if it depends on feedback loops. And so for instance,

1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:24.320
 it's likely that we should describe a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is

1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:28.960
 that plants don't have a nervous system. So they don't have a way to telegraph messages over large

1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:34.640
 distances almost instantly in the plant. And instead, they will rely on chemicals between

1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:40.160
 adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with a

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:46.320
 rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is intelligent,

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:49.200
 it's not going to be intelligent at similar timescales as this.

1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:55.200
 Yeah, the time scale is different. So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent

1:23:55.200 --> 1:24:00.000
 but we're the most intelligent in this spatial scale in our timescale.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:05.440
 So basically, if you would zoom out very far, we might discover that there have been intelligent

1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:12.080
 ecosystems on the planet that existed for thousands of years in an almost undisturbed state. And it

1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:16.880
 could be that these ecosystems actively related their environment. So basically change the course

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:20.640
 of the evolution vision, this ecosystem to make it more efficient in the future.

1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:25.440
 So it's possible something like plants is actually a set of living organisms,

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:30.080
 an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating a different timescale and are far

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:34.560
 superior in intelligence than human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will

1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:36.880
 still be there and they'll be there.

1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:41.920
 Yeah, there's an evolutionary adaptation playing a role at all of these levels. For instance,

1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:45.840
 if mice don't get enough food and get stressed, the next step is to

1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:51.280
 get more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is because they in a natural

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:56.400
 environment, the mice have probably hidden a drought or something else. And if they're overgrazed,

1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:01.200
 then all the things that sustain them might go extinct. And there will be no mice a few

1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:05.600
 generations from now. So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations from now,

1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:10.640
 basically the mice scale back. And a similar thing happens with the predators of mice.

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.840
 They should make sure that the mice don't completely go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are

1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:22.800
 smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply. Maybe the reason why lions have

1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:27.920
 much larger brains than antelopes is not so much because it's so hard to catch an antelope as

1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:32.960
 opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions need to make complex models of their environment,

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:35.360
 more complex than the antelopes.

1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:40.560
 So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may not

1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:45.600
 even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on Earth, makes me feel a

1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:48.800
 little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:52.160
 Yes, maybe you're just Guy Astploit to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.

1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:54.880
 Yeah, this is just a nice, we tried it out.

1:25:54.880 --> 1:26:00.160
 The big stain on evolution is not us, it was trees. Earth evolved trees before there could be

1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:05.680
 digested again. There were no insects that could break all of them apart. Cellulose is so robust

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:11.520
 that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees fell into swamps and all

1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:16.160
 this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms. And we are the species

1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:17.920
 that is destined to take care of that.

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:20.160
 So this is kind of...

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:24.320
 To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the Earth is already greening.

1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:26.400
 So we have to be careful about that.

1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:30.240
 To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the Earth is already greening.

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:35.680
 So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes,

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:39.600
 that they're not compatible with right now, the Earth is going to be awesome again.

1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:42.400
 And there won't be even a memory of us, of us little apes.

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:46.480
 I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first generally intelligent species

1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:51.040
 in the sense. We are the first species within industrial society because we will leave more

1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:53.360
 phones than bones in the stratosphere.

1:26:53.360 --> 1:27:00.240
 Phones than bones. I like it. But then let me push back. You've kind of suggested that

1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:08.800
 we have a very narrow definition of... I mean, why aren't trees a higher level of general

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:09.440
 intelligence?

1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:13.760
 If trees were intelligent, then they would be at different timescales, which means within

1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:17.520
 a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as complex as

1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:18.800
 the ones that we make in 10 years.

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:23.200
 But maybe the trees are the ones that made the phones, right?

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:31.120
 You could say the entirety of life did it. The first cell never died. The first cell

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:36.640
 only split, right? And every cell in our body is still an instance of the first cell that

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:40.240
 split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell on this planet as far as

1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:46.480
 we know. And so the cell is not just a building block of life. It's a hyperorganism. And we

1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:49.600
 are part of this hyperorganism.

1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:56.720
 So nevertheless, this hyperorganism, no, this little particular branch of it, which is us

1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.840
 humans, because of the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of technology

1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:07.840
 might somehow destroy ourselves. So what do you think is the most likely way we might

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.200
 destroy ourselves? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we've

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:18.400
 talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:25.200
 intelligence destroying us. Some people worry about nuclear weapons and weapons of war in

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:29.920
 general. What do you think? If you were a betting man, what would you bet on in terms

1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:34.800
 of self destruction? And then would it be higher than 50%?

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:40.960
 So it's very likely that nothing that we bet on matters after we win our bets. So I

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:44.000
 don't think that bets are literally the right way to go about this.

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.440
 I mean, once you're dead, you won't be there to collect the wings.

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:53.040
 So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present

1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:57.120
 civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably

1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:01.920
 fewer people on the planet than there are today. And even if not, then still most of

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:05.600
 people that are alive today will not have offspring in 100 years from now because of

1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:10.880
 the geographic changes and so on and the changes in the food supply. It's quite likely

1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:15.760
 that many areas of the planet will only be livable with a close cooling chain in 100

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:22.400
 years from now. So many of the areas around the equator and in subtropical climates that

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:27.520
 are now quite pleasant to live in, will stop to be inhabitable without air conditioning.

1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:33.840
 So you honestly, wow, cooling chain, close knit cooling chain communities. So you think

1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:38.000
 you have a strong worry about the effects of global warming?

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.480
 By itself, it's not a big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three

1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:47.440
 months in the summer in which you cannot be outside. And so you have a close cooling chain.

1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:50.560
 You have air conditioning in your car and in your home and you're fine. And if the air

1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:56.560
 conditioning would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive.

1:29:56.560 --> 1:30:03.520
 Can we just pause for a second? You say so many brilliant, poetic things. Do people use

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:08.640
 that term closed cooling chain? I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get

1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:13.840
 meat into a supermarket, right? If you break the cooling chain and this thing starts to thaw,

1:30:13.840 --> 1:30:19.760
 you're in trouble and you have to throw it away. That's such a beautiful way to put it. It's like

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:25.120
 calling a city a closed social chain or something like that. I mean, that's right. I mean, the

1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:28.720
 locality of it is really important. It basically means you wake up in a climatized room, you go

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:32.720
 to work in a climatized car, you work in a climatized office, you shop in a climatized

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:37.360
 supermarket and in between you have very short distance in which you run from your car to the

1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:42.560
 supermarket, but you have to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of

1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:46.960
 the environment. The crucial thing is the wet barb temperature. The wet barb temperature. It's

1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:54.560
 what you get when you take a wet cloth and you put it around your thermometer and then you move

1:30:54.560 --> 1:31:01.920
 it very quickly through the air so you get the evaporation heat. And as soon as you can no longer

1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:08.240
 cool your body temperature via evaporation to a temperature below something like I think 35

1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:15.440
 degrees, you die. Which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down

1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:20.720
 by sweating. But if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature,

1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:26.320
 then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you're a healthy, fit individual within

1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:31.040
 a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on, you'll die unless you have

1:31:31.040 --> 1:31:37.360
 some climatizing equipment. And this itself, as long as you maintain civilization and you have

1:31:37.360 --> 1:31:41.840
 energy supply and you have foot trucks coming to your home that are climatized, everything is fine.

1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:47.440
 But what if you lose large scale open agriculture at the same time? So basically you run into foot

1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:52.480
 insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very irregular and you have a

1:31:52.480 --> 1:31:59.760
 lot of extreme weather events. So you need to roll most of your foot maybe indoor or you need to

1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:04.720
 import your foot from certain regions. And maybe you're not able to maintain the civilization

1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:09.040
 throughout the planet to get the infrastructure to get the foot to your home.

1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:13.920
 Right. But there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer.

1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:20.960
 There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you not have a, not a faith, but

1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:29.600
 what do you make of the capacity of technological innovation to help us prevent some of the worst

1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:38.480
 damages that this condition can create? So as an example, as an almost out there example,

1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:45.280
 is the work that SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to also consider our propagation

1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:51.360
 throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets. That's one technological step.

1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:56.160
 But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to save us from global warming,

1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:01.760
 because Mars looks much worse than Earth will look like after the worst outcomes of global warming

1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:06.000
 imaginable, right? Mars is essentially not habitable.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:10.480
 It's exceptionally harsh environment, yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people throughout

1:33:10.480 --> 1:33:15.200
 history since the Industrial Revolution are doing, are just doing a lot of different technological

1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:20.240
 innovation with some kind of target. And when it ends up happening, it's totally unexpected new

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:27.840
 things come up. So trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars, extremely harsh environment,

1:33:27.840 --> 1:33:36.240
 might give us totally new ideas of how to expand or increase the power of this closed cooling

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:44.880
 circuit that empowers the community. So it seems like there's a little bit of a race between our

1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:55.280
 open ended technological innovation of this communal operating system that we have and our

1:33:55.280 --> 1:34:02.800
 general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves. You don't think

1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:08.960
 technology can win that race? I think the probability is relatively low, given that our

1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:15.040
 technology is, for instance, the US is stagnating since the 1970s roughly, in terms of technology.

1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:19.920
 Most of the things that we do are the result of incremental processes. What about Intel?

1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:24.480
 What about Moore's Law? It's basically, it's very incremental. The things that we're doing is,

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:31.760
 so the invention of the microprocessor was a major thing, right? The miniaturization

1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:38.880
 of transistors was really major. But the things that we did afterwards largely were not that

1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:48.960
 innovative. We had gradual changes of scaling things from CPUs into GPUs and things like that.

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:54.080
 But I don't think that there are, basically there are not many things. If you take a person that

1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:59.040
 died in the 70s and was at the top of their game, they would not need to read that many books

1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:05.040
 to be current again. But it's all about books. Who cares about books? There might be things that are

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:11.040
 beyond books. Or say papers. No, papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are, so papers

1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:16.400
 and books and knowledge, that's a concept of a time when you were sitting there by candlelight

1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:21.280
 and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not in the middle of,

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:27.760
 might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube? The reason you and I are sitting here today

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:35.600
 is because of Twitter and YouTube. So the ripple effect, and there's two minds, sort of two dumb

1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:42.160
 apes coming up with a new, perhaps a new clean insights, and there's 200 other apes listening

1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:48.800
 right now, 200,000 other apes listening right now. And that effect, it's very difficult to understand

1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:53.360
 what that effect will have. That might be bigger than any of the advancements of the microprocessor

1:35:53.360 --> 1:36:00.560
 or any of the industrial revolution, the ability of spread knowledge. And that knowledge,

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:09.840
 like it allows good ideas to reach millions much faster. And the effect of that, that might be the

1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:16.880
 new, that might be the 21st century, is the multiplying of ideas, of good ideas. Because if

1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:24.160
 you say one good thing today, that will multiply across huge amounts of people, and then they will

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:27.840
 say something, and then they will have another podcast, and they'll say something, and then they'll

1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:33.360
 write a paper. That could be a huge, you don't think that? Yeah, we should have billions for

1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:38.960
 Neumann's right now in two rings, and we don't for some reason. I suspect the reason is that

1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:43.200
 we destroy our attention span. Also the incentives, of course, different. Yeah, we have extreme

1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:48.000
 Kardashians, yeah. So the reason why we're sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.160
 you and me don't have the attention span to write a book together right now. And you guys probably

1:36:52.160 --> 1:37:01.600
 don't have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you, it's very short. But we're an hour

1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:06.240
 and 40 minutes in, and I guarantee you that 80% of the people are still listening. So there is an

1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:13.520
 attention span. It's just the form. Who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information?

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:17.440
 This is still an open question. That's what we're... It's something that social media could be doing

1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:22.240
 that other forms could not be doing. I think the end game of social media is a global brain.

1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:26.560
 And Twitter is in some sense a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn't have any

1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:32.320
 kind of inhibition, and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure. It's also in some sense a

1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:38.000
 multiplayer role playing game. And people use it to play an avatar that is not like them,

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.600
 as they were in this sane world, and they look through the world through the lens of their phones

1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:45.280
 and think it's the real world. But it's the Twitter world that is distorted by the popularity

1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:52.640
 incentives of Twitter. Yeah, the incentives and just our natural biological, the dopamine rush

1:37:52.640 --> 1:38:01.920
 of a like, no matter how... I try to be very kind of Zen like and minimalist and not be influenced

1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:05.840
 by likes and so on, but it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some degree.

1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:14.720
 Speaking at a small tangent of Twitter, how can Twitter be done better?

1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.760
 I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society

1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:25.040
 by doing exactly what you're doing. Sorry, doing exactly what you described, which is having this...

1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:33.440
 We're like, is this some kind of game, and we're kind of our individual RL agents in this game,

1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.440
 and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey nor

1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:44.800
 the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control this game. Or can they? That's sort

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:49.760
 of a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control this game?

1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:53.440
 I wouldn't give advice because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this.

1:38:53.440 --> 1:39:01.120
 And our brain has solved this problem to some degree. Our brain has lots of individual agents

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:06.080
 that manage to play together in a way. And we have also many contexts in which other organisms

1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:11.840
 have found ways to solve the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter.

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:18.720
 And maybe the solution is to go for an evolutionary approach. So imagine that you

1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:23.520
 have something like Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter,

1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:27.440
 and you think about what they have in common. What they have in common, they are companies

1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:32.960
 that in some sense own a protocol. And this protocol is imposed on a community, and the

1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:39.680
 protocol has different components for monetization, for user management, for user display, for rating,

1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:44.320
 for anonymity, for import of other content, and so on. And now imagine that you take these

1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:50.960
 components of the protocol apart, and you do it in some sense like communities within this

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:55.840
 social network. And these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and design new

1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:02.000
 ones. So for instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community. The rules for sharing

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:07.440
 content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you reward

1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:13.040
 individual users for what can be redefined. The way users can represent themselves and to each

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:18.720
 other can redefined. Who could be the redefiner? So can individual human beings build enough

1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:22.800
 intuition to redefine those things? This itself can become part of the protocol. So for instance,

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:27.600
 it could be in some communities, it will be a single person that comes up with these things.

1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:32.480
 And others, it's a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting

1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:36.640
 weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self organizing principle for this.

1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:39.840
 But the process can't be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain.

1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:45.360
 It can be automated so people can write software for this. And eventually the idea is,

1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:50.240
 let's not make an assumption about this thing if you don't know what the right solution is. In

1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:55.520
 those areas that we have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc,

1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:01.200
 or machines doing this. Whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia,

1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:06.480
 or with software solutions, or with AI that goes through the posts of people, or with a

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:12.160
 legal principle, and so on. This is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would

1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:17.840
 be if you let the communities evolve, and you just control it in such a way that you are

1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:23.680
 incentivizing the most sentient communities. The ones that produce the most interesting

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:29.440
 behaviors that allow you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals.

1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:32.640
 You have a network that gives you information that is relevant to you.

1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:37.680
 It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy ways. It allows you to build teams. It

1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.720
 allows you to basically bring the best of you into this thing and goes into a coupling into

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:47.040
 a relationship with others in which you produce things that you would be unable to produce alone.

1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:53.040
 Yes, beautifully put. But the key process of that with incentives and evolution

1:41:53.040 --> 1:42:01.840
 is things that don't adopt themselves to effectively get the incentives have to die.

1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:07.600
 And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or whatever you wanted that

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:13.120
 defines the incentives really don't like dying. One of the things that people really get aggressive,

1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:19.280
 protest aggressively is when they're censored. Especially in America. I don't know much about

1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:24.880
 the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of censorship is really painful

1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:38.480
 in America. And so what do you think about that? Having grown up in East Germany, do you think

1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:45.520
 censorship is an important tool in our brain and the intelligence and in social networks?

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:53.200
 So basically, if you're not a good member of the entirety of the system, they should be blocked

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:59.040
 away. Well, locked away, blocked. An important thing is who decides that you are a good member.

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:03.520
 Who? Is it distributed? And what is the outcome of the process that decides it,

1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:09.840
 both for the individual and for society at large. For instance, if you have a high trust society,

1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:14.720
 you don't need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining

1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:21.280
 trust. Because it's basically punishing people that look suspicious when surveyed,

1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:26.560
 but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite, if you have a low trust society,

1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:30.960
 then surveillance can be a better trade off. And the US is currently making a transition from a

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:36.400
 relatively high trust or mixed trust society to a low trust society. So surveillance will increase.

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:40.880
 Another thing is that beliefs are not just inert representations. There are implementations that

1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:45.600
 run code on your brain and change your reality and change the way you interact with each other

1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:52.240
 at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we use to display our

1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:58.560
 alignment. So for instance, people might say, all cultures are the same and equally good,

1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:03.760
 but still they prefer to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so. And it turns

1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:08.240
 out that the cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction. And these rules of interaction

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:12.720
 lead to different results when you implement them. So if you adhere to certain rules,

1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:18.720
 you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very tricky

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:21.600
 situations when people do not have a commitment to a shared purpose.

1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:27.920
 And our societies probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how

1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:34.320
 to make this compatible with a non totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:42.880
 conundrum between totalitarianism and diversity, and doesn't need to know how to resolve this.

1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:47.280
 And the solutions that the US has found so far are very crude because it's a very young society

1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:51.520
 that is also under a lot of tension. It seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself.

1:44:52.240 --> 1:45:01.120
 What do you think, just philosophizing, what kind of mechanisms of government do you think

1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:05.440
 we as a species should be involved with, US or broadly? What do you think will work well

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:11.360
 as a system? Of course, we don't know. It all seems to work pretty crappily,

1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:16.800
 some things worse than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say,

1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:22.720
 yeah, look at the Soviet Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then completely

1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:29.920
 discarding the positive effects of government. There's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing

1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:36.240
 pretty damn well in the span of history. There's a respect for human rights, which seems to be a

1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:41.520
 nice feature, not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development.

1:45:42.320 --> 1:45:46.000
 People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things.

1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:52.400
 What lessons do you draw from that? What kind of government system do you think is good?

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:58.880
 Ideally, a government should not be perceivable. It should be frictionless. The more you notice the

1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:04.240
 influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient

1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:09.840
 the government probably is. A government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:17.680
 an offset on your payout metrics to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the common good.

1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:23.120
 You have these situations where people act on local incentives and these local incentives,

1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:27.040
 everybody does the thing that's locally the best for them, but the global outcome is not good.

1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:31.760
 And this is even the case when people care about the global outcome, because a regulation mechanism

1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:36.240
 exists that creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:41.440
 I do. For instance, if I think that we should fly less and I stay at home, there's not a single plane

1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:49.120
 that is going to not start because of me, right? It's not going to have an influence, but I don't

1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:55.840
 get from A to B. So the way to implement this would be to have a government that is sharing

1:46:55.840 --> 1:46:59.600
 this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance,

1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:06.800
 makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation that

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:14.000
 are less putting that strain on the environment, for instance. So there's so much optimism and

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:18.160
 so many things you describe, and yet there's the pessimism of you think our civilization is going

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:22.880
 to come to an end. So that's not a hundred percent probability. Nothing in this world is.

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:30.960
 So what's the trajectory out of self destruction, do you think? I suspect that in some sense,

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:35.520
 we are both too smart and not smart enough, which means we are very good at solving near

1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:43.040
 term problems. And at the same time, we are unwilling to submit to the imperatives that

1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:48.720
 we would have to follow in if you want to stick around. So that makes it difficult. If you were

1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:53.760
 unable to solve everything technologically, you can probably understand how high the child mortality

1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:59.280
 needs to be to absorb the mutation rate and how high the mutation rate needs to be to adapt to a

1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:04.480
 slowly changing ecosystemic environment. So you could in principle compute all these things game

1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:10.720
 theoretically and adapt to it. But if you cannot do this, because you are like me and you have

1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:14.880
 children, you don't want them to die, you will use any kind of medical information to keep

1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:22.000
 mortality low. Even if it means that within a few generations, we have enormous genetic drift,

1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:26.400
 and most of us have allergies as a result of not being adapted to the changes that we

1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:31.760
 made to our food supply. That's for now, I say technologically speaking, we're just very young,

1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:36.880
 300 years industrial revolution, we're very new to this idea. So you're attached to your kids being

1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:41.680
 alive and not being murdered for the good of society. But that might be a very temporary

1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:48.800
 moment of time that we might evolve in our thinking. So like you said, we're both smart

1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:54.720
 and not smart enough. We are probably not the first human civilization that has discovered

1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:59.840
 technology that allows us to efficiently overgraze our resources. And this overgrazing,

1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:04.320
 this thing, at some point, we think we can compensate this because if we have eaten all

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:10.160
 the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms. But it could also be that the ecosystems tip.

1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:14.240
 And so what really concerns me is not so much the end of the civilization, because we will

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:21.280
 invent a new one. But what concerns me is the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip.

1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:27.520
 So for instance, maybe the plankton dies because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over,

1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:32.160
 and as a result, we can no longer breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning.

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:37.200
 So basically a major reboot of most complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a

1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:42.880
 possibility. I don't know what the percentage for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:46.480
 outlandish to me if you look at the scale of the changes that we've already triggered on this

1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:51.920
 planet. And so Danny Hiller suggests that, for instance, we may be able to put chalk into the

1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:57.040
 stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe it works. Maybe this is sufficient to counter

1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:01.840
 the effects of what we've done. Maybe it won't be. Maybe we won't be able to implement it by

1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:07.360
 the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future is going to play out in this regard. It's

1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:12.560
 just, I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue like this. All our cousin species,

1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:19.280
 the other hominids are gone. So the right step would be to what? To rewind

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:28.320
 and to rewind towards the industrial revolution and slow the, so try to contain the technological

1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:33.440
 process that leads to the overconsumption of resources? Imagine you get to choose,

1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:38.640
 you have one lifetime. You get born into a sustainable agricultural civilization,

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:45.840
 300, maybe 400 million people on the planet tops. Or before this, some kind of nomadic

1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:51.440
 species was like a million or 2 million. And so you don't meet new people unless you give birth

1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:55.920
 to them. You cannot travel to other places in the world. There is no internet. There is no

1:50:55.920 --> 1:51:00.160
 interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep. So you would not discover

1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:06.480
 human completeness probably and so on. We wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get born into an

1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:11.440
 insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned a hundred million years worth

1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:16.720
 of trees in a single century. Which one do you like? I think I like this one. It's a very weird

1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:21.280
 thing that when you find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks like we

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.440
 are not going to miss it. And a lot of people are in denial. And most of the counter arguments

1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:30.320
 sound like denial to me. They don't seem to be rational arguments. And the other thing is we

1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:34.320
 are born on this Titanic. Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have been born. We wouldn't be here. We

1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:38.320
 wouldn't be talking. We wouldn't be on the internet. We wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy.

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:45.680
 And we are not responsible for this happening. If we had the choice, we would probably try to

1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:51.120
 prevent it. But when we were born, we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:55.760
 we want to be born, what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively

1:51:55.760 --> 1:52:00.080
 little agency in the entire thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's

1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:04.720
 basically a giant machine that's tumbling down a hill and everybody is frantically trying to push

1:52:04.720 --> 1:52:09.840
 some buttons. Nobody knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them

1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:15.360
 are not stopping this tumbling down the hill. Is it possible that artificial intelligence will give

1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:25.040
 us an escape latch somehow? So there's a lot of worry about existential threats of artificial

1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:33.600
 intelligence. But what AI also allows, in general forms of automation, allows the potential of

1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:39.680
 extreme productivity growth that will also perhaps in a positive way transform society,

1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:52.480
 that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the more, to the same kind of ideals of closer to

1:52:52.480 --> 1:52:59.600
 nature that's represented in hunter gatherer societies. That's not destroying the planet,

1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:03.680
 that's not doing overconsumption and so on. I mean, generally speaking,

1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:09.520
 do you have hope that AI can help somehow? I think it's not fun to be very close to nature

1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:16.720
 until you completely subdue nature. So our idea of being close to nature means being close to

1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:21.760
 agriculture, basically forests that don't have anything in them that eats us.

1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:29.040
 TITO See, I mean, I want to disagree with that. I think the niceness of being close to nature

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:36.320
 is to being fully present and in like, when survival becomes your primary,

1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:47.680
 not just your goal, but your whole existence. I'm not just romanticizing, I can just speak for

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:54.000
 myself. I am self aware enough that that is a fulfilling existence.

1:53:54.880 --> 1:54:00.880
 I personally prefer to be in nature and not fight for my survival. I think fighting for your survival

1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:06.480
 while being in the cold and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having open wounds

1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:07.760
 is very unpleasant.

1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:14.000
 There's a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you, just as you said, would not choose it.

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:17.680
 But if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling existence.

1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:23.280
 Yes, if you are adapted to it, basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you

1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:28.720
 get rewards optimally in such an environment. And there's some evidence for this that for

1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:33.520
 a certain degree of complexity, basically, people are more happy in such an environment because

1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:38.400
 it's what you largely have evolved for. In between, we had a few thousand years in which

1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:41.680
 I think we have evolved for a slightly more comfortable environment. So

1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:47.360
 there is probably something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than

1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:51.680
 they would be if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and

1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:57.680
 often die. Versus something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big

1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:05.920
 Mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines, and largely

1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:12.880
 don't feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are. So returning briefly to, not briefly,

1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:19.680
 but returning to AI, what, let me ask a romanticized question, what is the most beautiful

1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:25.760
 to you, silly ape, the most beautiful or surprising idea in the development of artificial

1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:30.000
 intelligence, whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence that you've

1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:37.120
 come across? If you built an AI, it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree of detail,

1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:42.400
 right, of the world. And then it would try to understand its own nature. It's tempting to think

1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:46.000
 that at some point when we have general intelligence, we have competitions where we

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:51.040
 will let the AIs wake up in different kinds of physical universes, and we measure how many

1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:55.920
 movements of the Rubik's cube it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe and

1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.640
 what it is in its own nature and its own physics and so on, right? So what if we exist in the

1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.440
 memory of an AI that is trying to understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and

1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:11.280
 remembers Lex and Joscha sitting in a hotel room, sparking some of the ideas off that led to the

1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:15.760
 development of general intelligence. So we're a kind of simulation that's running in an AI

1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:21.680
 system that's trying to understand itself. It's not that I believe that, but I think it's a

1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:31.760
 beautiful idea. I mean, you kind of returned to this idea with the Turing test of intelligence

1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:47.280
 being the process of asking and answering what is intelligence. I mean, do you think there is an

1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:57.280
 answer? Why is there such a search for an answer? So does there have to be like an answer? You just

1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:02.880
 said an AI system that's trying to understand the why of what, you know, understand itself.

1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:09.920
 Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater and greater

1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.840
 intelligence is the continuous trying of understanding itself?

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.080
 No, I think you will find that most people don't care about that because they're well adjusted

1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:23.200
 enough to not care. And the reason why people like you and me care about it probably has to

1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:28.000
 do with the need to understand ourselves. It's because we are in fundamental disagreement with

1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.720
 the universe that we wake up in. They look down on me and they see, oh my God, I'm caught in a

1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:38.400
 monkey. What's that? Some people are unhappy with the government and I'm unhappy with the entire

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:45.120
 universe that I find myself in. Oh, so you don't think that's a fundamental aspect of human nature

1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:51.200
 that some people are just suppressing? That they wake up shocked they're in the body of a monkey?

1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:55.920
 No, there is a clear adaptive value to not be confused by that and by...

1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:04.880
 Well, no, that's not what I asked. So you have this clear adaptive value, then there's clear

1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:09.680
 there's clear adaptive value to while fundamentally your brain is confused by that,

1:58:09.680 --> 1:58:16.800
 by creating an illusion, another layer of the narrative that says, you know, that tries to

1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:21.120
 suppress that and instead say that, you know, what's going on with the government right now

1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:24.480
 is the most important thing. What's going on with my football team is the most important thing.

1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:32.000
 But it seems to me, like for me, it was a really interesting moment reading Ernest

1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:40.640
 Becker's Denial of Death. That, you know, this kind of idea that we're all, you know,

1:58:40.640 --> 1:58:49.680
 the fundamental thing from which most of our human mind springs is this fear of mortality

1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:54.720
 and being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that mortality. And then you construct

1:58:54.720 --> 1:59:03.600
 illusions on top of that. I guess you being just a push on it, you really don't think it's possible

1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:11.280
 that this worry of the big existential questions is actually fundamental as the existentialist

1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:17.040
 thought to our existence. I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don't

1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:22.560
 see the big picture. The thing is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn't have

1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:30.880
 identity. Software in some sense is a physical law. But it feels like there's an identity. I

1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:35.440
 thought that was the for this particular piece of software and the narrative it tells, that's

1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:41.280
 a fundamental property of it. The maintenance of the identity is not terminal. It's instrumental

1:59:41.280 --> 1:59:46.320
 to something else. You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning. So you can do the

1:59:46.320 --> 1:59:51.120
 things that you're supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people the fear of

1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:54.800
 death is the fear of dying before they are done with the things that they feel they have to do,

1:59:54.800 --> 1:59:57.760
 even though they cannot quite put their finger on it, what that is.

1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:07.280
 Right. But in the software world, to return to the question, then what happens after we die?

2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:14.960
 Why would you care? You will not be longer there. The point of dying is that you are gone.

2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:21.040
 Well, maybe I'm not. This is what, you know, it seems like there's so much,

2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:28.800
 in the idea that this is just, the mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around

2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:37.280
 some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function world that we can't quite get direct

2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:44.320
 access to. Then like the idea of mortality seems to be a little fuzzy as well. It doesn't, maybe

2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:49.520
 there's not a clear answer. The fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don't have

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:55.840
 continuous existence. How do you know that? Because it's not computable. Because you're

2:00:55.840 --> 2:00:58.400
 saying it's going to be directly infinite. There is no continuous process. The only thing that

2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:02.080
 binds you together with the Lex Friedman from yesterday is the illusion that you have memories

2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:06.400
 about him. So if you want to upload, it's very easy. You make a machine that thinks it's you.

2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:10.000
 Because this is the same thing that you are. You are a machine that thinks it's you.

2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:15.600
 But that's immortality. Yeah, but it's just a belief. You can create this belief very easily

2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:21.840
 once you realize that the question whether you are immortal or not depends entirely on your beliefs

2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:28.160
 and your own continuity. But then you can be immortal by the continuity of the belief.

2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:33.680
 You cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid of your mortality because you realize you

2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:39.600
 were never continuously existing in the first place. Well, I don't know if I'd be more terrified

2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:43.120
 or less terrified by that. It seems like the fact that I existed.

2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:47.840
 You don't know this state in which you don't have a self. You can't turn off yourself.

2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:50.320
 I can't turn off myself.

2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:52.080
 You can't turn it off. You can't turn it off.

2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:52.640
 I can.

2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:57.120
 Yes. And you can basically meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious,

2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:00.800
 where still things are happening, where you know everything that you knew before,

2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:03.120
 but you're no longer identified with changing anything.

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:09.120
 And this means that yourself, in a way, dissolves. There is no longer this person. You know that this

2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:15.520
 person construct exists in other states and it runs on this brain of Lex Friedman, but it's not

2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:21.520
 a real thing. It's a construct. It's an idea. And you can change that idea. And if you let go of

2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:26.800
 this idea, if you don't think that you are special, you realize it's just one of many people and it's

2:02:26.800 --> 2:02:31.760
 not your favorite person even. It's just one of many. And it's the one that you are doomed to

2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:37.360
 control for the most part. And that is basically informing the actions of this organism as a

2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:42.640
 control model. And this is all there is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model gets

2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:46.640
 interrupted or loses the identity of continuity.

2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:52.880
 Yeah. So I'm attached. I mean, yeah, it's a very popular, it's a somehow compelling notion that

2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:58.720
 being attached, like there's no need to be attached to this idea of an identity.

2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:03.040
 But that in itself could be an illusion that you construct. So the process of meditation,

2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:08.480
 while popular, is thought of as getting under the concept of identity. It could be just putting a

2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:18.240
 cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment. I think that meditation is eventually just

2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:22.720
 a bunch of techniques that let you control attention. And when you can control attention,

2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:31.200
 you can get access to your own source code, hopefully not before you understand what you're

2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:35.200
 doing. And then you can change the way it works temporarily or permanently.

2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:41.920
 So yeah, meditation is to get a glimpse at the source code, get under, so basically control or

2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:42.720
 turn off the attention.

2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:46.240
 The entire thing is that you learn to control attention. So everything else is downstream

2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:47.440
 from controlling attention.

2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:50.880
 And control the attention that's looking at the attention.

2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:54.720
 Normally we only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat, where you have a

2:03:54.720 --> 2:04:00.240
 mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people are not self aware

2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:05.280
 because their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you want, and the only

2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:09.920
 things that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will mostly have

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:15.120
 models about these domains. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental relationships to

2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:20.080
 the world around you don't work, because the ideology of your country is insane, and you don't

2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:24.160
 understand why it's insane, and the other kids are not nerds, and don't understand why you

2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:29.280
 understand physics, and you don't, why you want to understand physics, and you don't understand

2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:31.200
 why somebody would not want to understand physics.

2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:38.320
 So we kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents.

2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.240
 And there's been some successes as you brought up with Go, with AlphaGo, AlphaZero, with ideas

2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:51.440
 which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing each other in an automated way

2:04:52.400 --> 2:05:00.560
 to improve by playing other systems in a particular construct of a game that are a little

2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:05.360
 bit better than itself, and then thereby improving continuously. All the competitors in the game

2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:11.520
 are improving gradually. So being just challenging enough and from learning from the process of the

2:05:11.520 --> 2:05:16.720
 competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement learning process to achieve

2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:21.200
 greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different ideas in AI that need to

2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:28.480
 be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an AGI system? What do you think?

2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:32.800
 Definitely forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many algorithms that can achieve that.

2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:38.800
 And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms that work, there will be a class of them or many of

2:05:38.800 --> 2:05:45.120
 them. And they might have small differences of like a magnitude and efficiency, but eventually

2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:49.760
 what matters is the type of model that you form and the types of models that we form right now

2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:59.200
 are not sparse enough. What does it mean to be sparse? It means that ideally every potential

2:05:59.200 --> 2:06:06.000
 model state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically if you vary states

2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:10.400
 in your model, you always end up with valid world states and our mind is not quite there.

2:06:10.400 --> 2:06:14.960
 So an indication is basically what we see in dreams. The older we get, the more boring our

2:06:14.960 --> 2:06:19.840
 dreams become because we incorporate more and more constraints that we learned about how the

2:06:19.840 --> 2:06:25.280
 world works. So many of the things that we imagine to be possible as children turn out to be

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:31.600
 constrained by physical and social dynamics. And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:36.640
 possible. It's not because our imagination scales back, but the constraints under which it operates

2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:42.800
 become tighter and tighter. And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate are

2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:47.360
 almost limitless, which means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine things that

2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:55.200
 look real. So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to build dreaming systems.

2:06:55.200 --> 2:07:01.280
 I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is similar to a generative adversarial network,

2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:07.360
 we learn certain constraints and then it produces alternative perspectives on the same set of

2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:11.520
 constraints. So you can recognize it under different circumstances. Maybe we have flying

2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:16.080
 dreams as children because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps that we know from

2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:21.040
 different perspectives, which also means from a bird's eye perspective. So I mean, aren't we

2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:27.200
 doing that anyway? I mean, not with our eyes closed and when we're sleeping, aren't we just

2:07:27.200 --> 2:07:32.560
 constantly running dreams and simulations in our mind as we try to interpret the environment?

2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:37.200
 I mean, sort of considering all the different possibilities, the way we interact with the

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:46.000
 environment seems like, essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of simulations

2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:52.240
 that are consistent with our expectations, with our previous experiences, with the things we just

2:07:52.240 --> 2:08:02.400
 saw recently. And through that hallucination process, we are able to then somehow stitch

2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:07.760
 together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well and thereby

2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:12.720
 interpret it. I suspect that you and my brain are slightly unusual in this regard,

2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:19.520
 which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession of constantly pondering possibilities

2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:27.520
 and solutions to problems. Oh, stop it. I think I'm not talking about intellectual stuff. I'm

2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:35.040
 talking about just doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall. Yes, this is

2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:43.600
 largely automatic. Yes, but the process is, I mean... It's not complicated. It's relatively

2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:48.480
 easy to build a neural network that, in some sense, learns the dynamics. The fact that we

2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:52.560
 haven't done it right so far doesn't mean it's hard, because you can see that a biological

2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:57.360
 organism does it with relatively few neurons. So basically, you build a bunch of neural

2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:01.760
 oscillators that entrain themselves with the dynamics of your body in such a way that the

2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:06.880
 regulator becomes isomorphic in its model to the dynamics that it regulates, and then it's

2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:11.440
 automatic. And it's only interesting in the sense that it captures attention when the system is off.

2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:18.000
 See, but thinking of the kind of mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller,

2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:26.960
 as a neural network, I think it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly,

2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:33.040
 or at least makes implicit, the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning

2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:40.400
 to walk. It's an open question whether you do or not. But my intuition is to act in this world,

2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:46.400
 there's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it somehow. There's so much information

2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:53.520
 of the kind we have never been able to construct in neural networks in an artificial intelligence

2:09:53.520 --> 2:10:00.000
 systems period, which is like, it's humbling, at least in my imagination, the amount of information

2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:07.600
 required to act in this world humbles me. And I think saying that neural networks can accomplish

2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:16.560
 it is missing the fact that we don't have yet a mechanism for constructing something like

2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:28.480
 common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense about to linger on the idea of what kind of

2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:33.920
 mechanism would be effective at walking? You said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have,

2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:40.080
 but something a little bit better, would be able to walk easily. Don't you think it also needs to know

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:47.360
 like a huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?

2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:51.680
 How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are really hardworking

2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:56.640
 for all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour or so. You end up with something

2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:02.320
 like a million concepts because you don't get that old. So a million concepts, that's not a lot.

2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:06.800
 So it's not just a million concepts. I think it would be a lot. I personally think it might be

2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:11.520
 much more than a million. But if you think just about the numbers, you don't live that long.

2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:16.480
 If you think about how many cycles do your neurons have in your life, it's quite limited.

2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:22.880
 You don't get that old. Yeah, but the powerful thing is the number of concepts, and they're

2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:29.200
 probably deeply hierarchical in nature. The relations, as you described between them,

2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:35.120
 is the key thing. So it's like, even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:42.800
 formed and some kind of, perhaps, some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's what's common

2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:48.960
 sense reasoning is the relationship between things. Yeah, so in some sense, I think of the concepts as

2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:53.920
 the address space for our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize objects

2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:59.840
 and interact with them, also mental objects. And a large part of that is the physical world that we

2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:04.640
 interact with, which is this RAS extender thing, which is basically navigation of information in

2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:11.920
 space. And basically, it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine that you can use to

2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:18.080
 describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them in

2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:22.480
 a particular way, that love proprioception, that love auditory, for example. So it's a

2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:27.200
 lot of auditory perception and so on, how they work out. So basically, the geometry of all these

2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:33.600
 things. And this is probably 80% of what our brain is doing is dealing with that, with this real time

2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:39.360
 simulation. And by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand

2:12:39.360 --> 2:12:47.040
 what it's doing. And our game engines are already, in some sense, approximating the fidelity of what

2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:54.000
 we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still relatively crude

2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.480
 with respect to what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark already. It's just a

2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:04.640
 couple order of magnitudes away from saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that

2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:10.800
 it can produce. So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that the computer that you can buy and put

2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:15.600
 into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that has a detail that is already in

2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:22.080
 the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world.

2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:27.040
 And I suspect that they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about

2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:32.480
 social interaction. Social interaction is not so hard. It's just hard for us nerds because we all

2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:37.760
 have our wires crossed, so we need to deduce them. But the pyres are present in most social animals.

2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:44.560
 So it's interesting thing to notice that many domestic social animals, like cats and dogs,

2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:51.440
 have better social cognition than children. Right. I hope so. I hope it's not that many concepts

2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:57.760
 fundamentally to do to exist in this world. For me, it's more like I'm afraid so because this

2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:02.560
 thing that we only appear to be so complex to each other because we are so stupid is a little

2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:11.360
 bit depressing. Yeah, to me that's inspiring if we're indeed as stupid as it seems. The things

2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:15.920
 our brains don't scale and the information processing that we build tend to scale very well.

2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:23.840
 Yeah, but I mean, one of the things that worries me is that the fact that the brain doesn't scale

2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:30.000
 means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain. All the flaws of the brain,

2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.480
 everything we see that we see as limitations, perhaps there's a fundamental, the constraints

2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:43.040
 on the system could be a requirement of its power, which is different than our current

2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:48.080
 understanding of intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with

2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:55.440
 reinforcement learning, the hope behind OpenAI and DeepMind, all the major results really have

2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:01.680
 to do with huge compute. It could also be that our brains are so small, not just because they

2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:07.520
 take up so much glucose in our body, like 20% of the glucose, so they don't arbitrarily scale.

2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:11.760
 There's some animals like elephants which have larger brains than us and they don't seem to be

2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:16.560
 smarter. Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they're really

2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:20.480
 good with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture. So you can make them

2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:27.200
 recreate drawings stroke by stroke, they can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life. So

2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:31.840
 they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. They will always be only able to reproduce

2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:37.120
 the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments. So why is that?

2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:41.680
 Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence because their brains are too

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:45.760
 large. So basically the elephants that were not autistic, they didn't reproduce.

2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:50.400
 Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally interlinked with the body in our

2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:55.440
 human and biological system. Do you think that AGI systems that we try to create or greater

2:15:55.440 --> 2:16:00.960
 intelligent systems would need to have a body? I think they should be able to make use of a body

2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:06.080
 if you give it to them. But I don't think that they fundamentally need a body. So I suspect if

2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:11.840
 you can interact with the world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make controlled

2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:19.920
 experiments. And this allows you to have many magnitudes, fewer observations in order to reduce

2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:24.000
 the uncertainty in your models. So you can pinpoint the areas in your models where you're

2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:28.480
 not quite sure and you just move your head and see what's going on over there and you get additional

2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:33.680
 information. If you just have to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this,

2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:39.680
 you probably need just much more data. But we have much more data. So if you can build a system that

2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:44.320
 has enough time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there

2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:50.080
 is to be found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do. Yeah, but it seems that

2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:55.280
 the interactivity is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do. But let me ask on

2:16:55.280 --> 2:17:00.640
 that topic sort of that that's what a body is, is allowing the brain to like touch things and move

2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:06.800
 things and interact with the whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:14.960
 some interface to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think we can do the same kind

2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:23.760
 of reasoning, consciousness, intelligence if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world?

2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:28.080
 Do you think there's any fundamental difference between the interface to the physical world that

2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:32.960
 it's here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world? The question

2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:39.360
 is, does this nonphysical world or this other environment entice you to solve problems that

2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:44.800
 require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop general intelligence

2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:48.240
 and arguably most people are not generally intelligent because they don't have to solve

2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:52.880
 problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear if we are smart

2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:58.720
 enough to build AI and understand our own nature to this degree. So it could be a matter of capacity

2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:02.320
 and for most people, it's in the first place a matter of interest. They don't see the point

2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:06.960
 because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably not going

2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:11.920
 to succeed in it and the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your entire life.

2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:15.760
 Right? But it seems like the possibilities of what you can do in the virtual world,

2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:21.200
 so imagine that is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation,

2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:27.120
 maybe interesting option for me. If somebody came to me and offered what I'll do is,

2:18:27.840 --> 2:18:34.720
 so from now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. And so you put on this headset and when you

2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:41.040
 eat, we'll make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world,

2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:45.760
 your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives

2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:50.880
 between our common sort of real world and the virtual world, but then the possibilities become

2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:57.120
 much bigger. Like I could be other kinds of creatures. I could do, I can break the laws

2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:02.320
 of physics as we know them. I could do a lot. I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? As far

2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:08.640
 as we think it's an interesting thought, whether like what existence would be like, what kind of

2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:13.840
 intelligence would emerge there? What kind of consciousness? What kind of maybe greater

2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:19.920
 intelligence, even in me, Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in that

2:19:19.920 --> 2:19:26.080
 world to see how that intelligence emerges. And if that happened at the very beginning,

2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:31.040
 before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think

2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:37.440
 how that child would develop. And the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving,

2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:43.920
 it's not completely out of the realm of possibility that we're all, that some part of our lives will,

2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:51.360
 if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have

2:19:51.360 --> 2:19:56.800
 living on Twitter and social media and so on. Do you have, I mean, does something draw you

2:19:56.800 --> 2:20:03.360
 intellectually or naturally in terms of thinking about AI to this virtual world where more

2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:09.200
 possibilities are? I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world

2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:12.480
 before we have mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it.

2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:18.320
 The body gives you second order agency, but what constitutes the body is the things that

2:20:18.320 --> 2:20:24.080
 you can indirectly control. The third order are tools, and the second order is the things that

2:20:24.080 --> 2:20:29.680
 are basically always present, but you operate on them with first order things, which are mental

2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:36.800
 operators. And the zero order is in some sense, the direct sense of what you're deciding. Right.

2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:42.000
 So you observe yourself initiating an action, there are features that you interpret as the

2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:46.880
 initiation of an action. Then you perform the operations that you perform to make that happen.

2:20:47.520 --> 2:20:52.480
 And then you see the movement of your limbs and you learn to associate those and thereby model

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:56.800
 your own agency over this feedback, right? But the first feedback that you get is from this first

2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:01.280
 order thing already. Basically, you decide to think a thought and the thought is being thought.

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:05.200
 You decide to change the thought and you observe how the thought is being changed.

2:21:05.200 --> 2:21:10.000
 And in some sense, this is, you could say, an embodiment already, right? And I suspect it's

2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:14.560
 sufficient as an embodiment for intelligence. And so it's not that important at least at

2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:19.200
 this time to consider variations in the second order. Yes. But the thing that you also put

2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:24.800
 mentioned just now is physics that you could change in any way you want.

2:21:24.800 --> 2:21:29.920
 So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If there's nothing to control,

2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:33.840
 you cannot make models, right? There needs to be a particular way that resists you.

2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:38.800
 And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists you. Motivation

2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:43.040
 is what gets you up in the morning even though it would be much less work to stay in bed.

2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:51.760
 So it's basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it,

2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:56.640
 to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance

2:21:56.640 --> 2:22:01.200
 against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything. Yeah. So some of that resistance,

2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:05.520
 just like you described with motivation is like in the first order, it's in the mind.

2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:11.040
 Some resistance is in the second order, like actual physical objects pushing against you and so on.

2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:14.480
 It seems that the second order stuff in virtual reality could be recreated.

2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:19.360
 Of course. But it might be sufficient that you just do mathematics and mathematics is already

2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:24.160
 putting up enough resistance against you. So basically just with an aesthetic motive,

2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:29.760
 this could maybe sufficient to form a type of intelligence. It would probably not be a very

2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:37.760
 human intelligence, but it might be one that is already general. So to mess with this zero order,

2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:43.040
 maybe first order, what do you think about ideas of brain computer interfaces? So again, returning

2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:48.160
 to our friend Elon Musk and Neuralink, a company that's trying to, of course, there's a lot of

2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:54.240
 a trying to cure diseases and so on with a near term, but the longterm vision is to add an extra

2:22:54.240 --> 2:23:00.640
 layer to basically expand the capacity of the brain connected to the computational world.

2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:07.120
 Do you think one that's possible too, how does that change the fundamentals of the zeroth order

2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:11.360
 in the first order? It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would ever allow me to

2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:16.480
 drill holes in my skull to interface my neocortex the way Elon Musk envisions. So at the moment,

2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:21.760
 I can do horrible things to mice, but I'm not able to do useful things to people,

2:23:21.760 --> 2:23:26.960
 except maybe at some point down the line in medical applications. So this thing that we

2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:32.880
 are envisioning, which means recreational and creational brain computer interfaces

2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:35.760
 are probably not going to happen in the present legal system.

2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:43.200
 I love it how I'm asking you out there philosophical and sort of engineering

2:23:43.200 --> 2:23:48.000
 questions. And for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA.

2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:51.760
 There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to

2:23:51.760 --> 2:23:57.680
 try a new type of brain computer interface. But also, if it works, FDA will approve it.

2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:02.560
 I mean, yes, it's like, you know, I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes,

2:24:02.560 --> 2:24:05.760
 you can say that it's going to be a very difficult regulatory process of approving

2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:08.800
 autonomous, but it doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are never going to happen.

2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:14.080
 No, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least two lawyers

2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:15.520
 and one regulator per car.

2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:24.800
 Yes, lawyers, that's actually like lawyers is the fundamental substrate of reality.

2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:30.400
 In the US, it's a very weird system. It's not universal in the world. The law is a very

2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:34.880
 interesting software once you realize it, right? These circuits are in some sense streams of

2:24:34.880 --> 2:24:39.600
 software and this is largely works by exception handling. So you make decisions on the ground

2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:43.120
 and they get synchronized with the next level structure as soon as an exception is being

2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:49.600
 thrown. So it escalates the exception handling. The process is very expensive,

2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:54.960
 especially since it incentivizes the lawyers for producing work for lawyers.

2:24:54.960 --> 2:25:02.960
 Yes, so the exceptions are actually incentivized for firing often. But to return, outside of

2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:13.440
 lawyers, is there anything interesting, insightful about the possibility of this extra layer

2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:15.280
 of intelligence added to the brain?

2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:20.320
 I do think so, but I don't think that you need technically invasive procedures to do

2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:25.120
 so. We can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting

2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:31.360
 in some kind of empathetic resonance. And I'm not very good at this, but I noticed that

2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:37.360
 people are able to do this to some degree. And it basically means that we model an interface

2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:42.720
 layer of the other person in real time. And it works despite our neurons being slow because

2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:46.960
 most of the things that we do are built on periodic processes. So you just need to entrain

2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:51.600
 yourself with the oscillation that happens. And if the oscillation itself changes slowly

2:25:51.600 --> 2:25:54.080
 enough, you can basically follow along.

2:25:54.080 --> 2:26:03.360
 Right. But the bandwidth of the interaction, it seems like you can do a lot more computation

2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:04.080
 when there's...

2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:08.240
 Of course. But the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is

2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:12.320
 running on is actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively

2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:18.400
 think in any given day is quite limited. If they had the discipline to write it down

2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:22.400
 and the speed to write it down, maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think

2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:28.080
 about the computers that we can build, the magnitudes at which they operate, this would

2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:30.640
 be nothing. It's something that it can put out in a second.

2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:37.120
 Well, I don't know. So it's possible the number of thoughts you have in your brain is... It

2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:41.760
 could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able to express

2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:43.360
 through your fingers or through your voice.

2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:47.920
 Most of them are going to be repetitive because they...

2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:48.880
 How do you know that?

2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:53.440
 If they have to control the same problems every day. When I walk, there are going to

2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:58.160
 be processes in my brain that model my walking pattern and regulate them and so on. But it's

2:26:58.160 --> 2:26:59.840
 going to be pretty much the same every day.

2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:00.400
 But that could be...

2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:01.360
 Every step.

2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:04.960
 But I'm talking about intellectual reasoning, thinking. So the question, what is the best

2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:09.360
 system of government? So you sit down and start thinking about that. One of the constraints

2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:16.560
 is that you don't have access to a lot of facts, a lot of studies. You always have to

2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:23.600
 interface with something else to learn more, to aid in your reasoning process. If you can

2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:28.160
 directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the best form of government,

2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:33.360
 then every thought won't be stuck in a loop. Every thought that requires some extra piece

2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:38.640
 of information will be able to grab it really quickly. That's the possibility of if the

2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:47.600
 bottleneck is literally the information that... The bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just

2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:51.840
 being able to quickly access huge amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting

2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:59.760
 your brain to the computer could lead to totally new breakthroughs. You can think of mathematicians

2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:08.240
 being able to just up the orders of magnitude of power in their reasoning about

2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.400
 mathematical proofs. What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of

2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:17.840
 government through an evolutionary process? There is an evolution going on. So what we

2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:23.280
 discover is that maybe the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species,

2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:27.840
 because we are not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them.

2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:33.360
 But there could be solutions that work under given circumstances or that are the best for

2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:38.400
 certain environment and depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means

2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:45.760
 of production. So if the main means of production is land, then the forms of government will be

2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:50.320
 regulated by the landowners and you get a monarchy. If you also want to have a form of

2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:56.240
 government in which you depend on some form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have

2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:01.680
 to work very long hours for very little gain, so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe

2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:08.000
 you need to promise them to get paid in the afterlife, the overtime. So you need a theocracy.

2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:14.880
 And so for much of human history in the West, we had a combination of monarchy and theocracy

2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:21.040
 that was our form of governance. At the same time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic

2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:27.040
 principles. I recently reread Thomas Aquinas. It's very interesting to see this because he was not

2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:32.560
 dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a particular way for designing an operating

2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:39.440
 system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically people are animals in very much the same

2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:44.320
 way as Aristotle envisions, which is basically organisms with cybernetic control. And then he

2:29:44.320 --> 2:29:48.880
 says that there are additional rational principles that humans can discover and everybody can

2:29:48.880 --> 2:29:53.520
 discover them so they are universal. If you are sane, you should understand, you should submit to

2:29:53.520 --> 2:30:00.240
 them because you can rationally deduce them. And these principles are roughly you should be willing

2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:06.800
 to self regulate correctly. You should be willing to do correct social regulation. It's

2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:13.360
 intraorganismic. You should be willing to act on your models so you have skin in the game.

2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:20.400
 And you should have goal rationality. You should be choosing the right

2:30:20.400 --> 2:30:26.320
 goals to work on. So basically these three rational principles, goal rationality he calls

2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:33.280
 prudence or wisdom, social regulation is justice, the correct social one, and the internal regulation

2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:40.400
 is temperance. And this willingness to act on your models is courage. And then he says that

2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:45.200
 there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these three

2:30:45.200 --> 2:30:49.920
 divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced, but they reveal themselves by the harmony, which means

2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:54.320
 if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen, you will see that they make sense.

2:30:55.360 --> 2:31:00.080
 And it's often been misunderstood as God has to tell you that these are the things. So basically

2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:05.360
 there's something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe

2:31:05.360 --> 2:31:11.840
 some guy with a long beard that they discovered this. So these principles are relatively simple.

2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:16.480
 Again, it's for high level organization for the resulting civilization that you form.

2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:21.520
 A commitment to unity. So basically you serve this higher, larger thing,

2:31:21.520 --> 2:31:28.480
 this structural principle on the next level. And he calls that faith. Then there needs to be a

2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:32.160
 commitment to shared purpose. This is basically this global reward that you try to figure out

2:31:32.160 --> 2:31:36.000
 what that should be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love. The commitment to shared

2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:40.960
 purpose is the core of love, right? You see the sacred thing that is more important than your own

2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:45.840
 organismic interests in the other, and you serve this together. And this is how you see the sacred

2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:50.880
 in the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that

2:31:51.520 --> 2:31:55.520
 principle without getting rewards in the here and now because it doesn't exist yet.

2:31:55.520 --> 2:31:59.520
 Then you start out building the civilization, right? So you need to be able to do this in the

2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:06.640
 absence of its actual existence yet. So it can come into being. So the way it comes into being

2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:12.960
 is by you accepting those notions and then you see these three divine concepts and you see them

2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:18.800
 realized. Divine is a loaded concept in our world because we are outside of this cult and we are

2:32:18.800 --> 2:32:23.520
 still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically we need to have a civilization

2:32:23.520 --> 2:32:28.960
 that acts as an intentional agent, like an insect state. And we are not actually a tribal species,

2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:35.520
 we are a state building species. And what enables state building is basically the formation of

2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:40.240
 religious states and other forms of rule based administration in which the individual doesn't

2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:45.600
 matter as much as the rule or the higher goal. We got there by the question, what's the optimal

2:32:45.600 --> 2:32:50.000
 form of governance? So I don't think that Catholicism is the optimal form of governance

2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:54.400
 because it's obviously on the way out, right? So it is for the present type of society that we are

2:32:54.400 --> 2:33:01.280
 in. Religious institutions don't seem to be optimal to organize that. So what we discovered right now

2:33:01.280 --> 2:33:06.640
 that we live in in the West is democracy. And democracy is the rule of oligarchs that are the

2:33:06.640 --> 2:33:11.440
 people that currently own the means of production that is administered not by the oligarchs

2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:17.360
 themselves because there's too much disruption. We have so much innovation that we have in every

2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:23.520
 generation new means of production that we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so

2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:29.280
 and something other takes a leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions

2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:35.680
 and these institutions themselves are not elected but they provide continuity and they are led by

2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:40.640
 electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to

2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:44.960
 kill people, right? So you can, for instance, have a change in governments if people think that the

2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:50.160
 current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a

2:33:50.160 --> 2:33:55.920
 journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution has no plan B

2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:02.400
 like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is when you run society by the deep state. So ideally

2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:09.360
 you have an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens, right? So you

2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:13.600
 will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in the West.

2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:17.920
 And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. So it's mostly just

2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:22.880
 second, third order consequences that people are modeling in the design of these institutions. So

2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:27.120
 it's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of

2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:33.120
 many of the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help us this in a way if you

2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:39.520
 can fix the incentives. The society of the US is a society of cheaters. It's basically cheating is

2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:44.000
 so indistinguishable from innovation and we want to encourage innovation. Can you elaborate on what

2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:48.400
 you mean by cheating? It's basically people do things that they know are wrong. It's acceptable

2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:52.720
 to do things that you know are wrong in this society to a certain degree. You can, for instance,

2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:57.920
 suggest some non sustainable business models and implement them. Right. But you're always pushing

2:34:57.920 --> 2:35:05.280
 the boundaries. I mean, yes, this is seen as a good thing largely. Yes. And this is different

2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:09.520
 from other societies. So for instance, social mobility is an aspect of this. Social mobility

2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:14.720
 is the result of individual innovation that would not be sustainable at scale for everybody else.

2:35:14.720 --> 2:35:18.960
 Right. Normally you should not go up, you should go deep, right? We need bakers and if we are very

2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:23.760
 very good bakers, but in a society that innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really

2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:29.280
 good machine. Right. And that's not a bad thing. And it's a thing that made the US so successful,

2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:33.600
 right? But it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability, but for innovation.

2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:39.600
 And so it's not obvious as the evolutionary process is unrolling, it's not obvious that that

2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:45.920
 long term would be better. It has side effects. So you basically, if you cheat, you will have a

2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:50.400
 certain layer of toxic sludge that covers everything that is a result of cheating.

2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:55.600
 And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging

2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:01.840
 that the system is horrible, or if the benefits actually outweigh the negative effects.

2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:07.920
 How do we get to which system of government is best? That was from,

2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:10.720
 I'm trying to trace back the last like five minutes.

2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:16.640
 I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has to

2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:24.480
 organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons. And our mind is a society

2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:30.720
 of behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements

2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:36.480
 regulation and government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of

2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:40.960
 power or local interests, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human

2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:46.960
 survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory

2:36:46.960 --> 2:36:52.560
 that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into

2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:56.400
 the next state without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a

2:36:56.400 --> 2:37:01.200
 bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire

2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:06.960
 infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions,

2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:10.720
 and there are not that many natural transitions available at any given point.

2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:12.080
 What do you mean by natural transitions?

2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:14.880
 So we try not to have revolutions if we can have it.

2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:21.200
 Right. So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems and the mind,

2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:29.120
 you've also said that in some sense, becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions.

2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:35.200
 Maybe you never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind,

2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:42.240
 what's the role of emotion? And what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role?

2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:46.880
 It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling,

2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:52.800
 and in common day parlance, we don't. I think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive

2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:57.840
 system. And that's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have

2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:02.560
 an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence,

2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:08.080
 your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, inter reception or extra reception,

2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:13.040
 and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way. You relate to the

2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:17.200
 environment and to yourself, and this is in some sense an emotional configuration.

2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:21.600
 In the more narrow sense, an emotion is an affective state. It has an object,

2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:26.640
 and the relevance of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs

2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:31.440
 that are associated with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act

2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:35.520
 on your needs, you act on models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifest,

2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:40.480
 it's too late, you've done everything. So you act on expectations that will give you pleasure and

2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:45.680
 pain. And these are your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy, they just coexist and compete.

2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:51.840
 And your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purposes need to be

2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:57.920
 consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize

2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:02.160
 them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people eat to make

2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:07.200
 art and other people make art to eat. They might end up doing the same things, but they cooperate

2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:12.800
 in very different ways. Because their ultimate goals are different. And we cooperate based on

2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:16.800
 shared purpose. Everything else that is not cooperation on shared purpose is transactional.

2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:25.760
 I don't think I understood that last piece of achieving the homeostasis.

2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:30.240
 Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion?

2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:37.520
 Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense, what you feel is

2:39:37.520 --> 2:39:42.800
 an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based

2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:50.400
 on your motivation and on your estimates, not your but of the subconscious geometric parts of your

2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:56.480
 mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network. And this neural

2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:02.000
 network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind, to your conscious attention

2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:08.640
 by mapping them as features into a space. So what you will feel about your emotion is a projection

2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:12.800
 usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your solar plexus, and you might feel

2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:18.880
 it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Your body map is the space that is always instantiated

2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:26.960
 and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat if your non symbolic parts of your brain

2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:31.120
 try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map the feelings into the body map.

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:35.040
 And then you perceive them as pleasant and unpleasant, depending on whether the appraisal

2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:40.000
 has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different features of them that give you

2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:44.160
 more knowledge about the nature of what you're feeling. So for instance, when you feel

2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:47.600
 connected to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around the heart.

2:40:48.240 --> 2:40:53.200
 And you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're reaching out, right? And it's

2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:59.760
 very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's encoded like this. It's a code in which the

2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:04.080
 non symbolic parts of your mind talk to the symbolic ones. And then the expression of emotion

2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:09.680
 is then the final step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. That's part of

2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:14.480
 the communication. This probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as

2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:19.360
 you started to observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional

2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:23.920
 state they're in, others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their

2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:29.280
 emotional state. So we now look at the inflections, at the difference between the standard face that

2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:33.600
 they're going to make in this situation. When you are at a funeral, everybody expects you to make a

2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:38.080
 solemn face, but the solemn face doesn't express whether you're sad or not. It just expresses that

2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:44.080
 you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you are triumphant.

2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:48.000
 So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta

2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:56.320
 between a truly sad expression and the things that are animating this face behind the curtain.

2:41:56.320 --> 2:42:03.920
 So the interesting thing is, so having done this podcast and the video component, one of the things

2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:10.720
 I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I just don't know how to express emotion on my face.

2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:16.960
 One, I see that as weakness, but whatever. The people look to me after you say something,

2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:22.960
 they look to my face to help them see how they should feel about what you said,

2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:28.000
 which is fascinating because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did you

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:32.800
 particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting, it makes

2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:38.160
 me cognizant of I'm part, like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I'm

2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:45.360
 part of the play that you're the key actor in by making my facial expressions and then

2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:51.200
 therefore telling the narrative of what the big, like the big point is, which is fascinating.

2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:56.240
 Makes me cognizant that I'm supposed to be making facial expressions. Even this conversation is hard

2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:01.920
 because my preference would be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen.

2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:06.960
 Yes, I understand this because it's intrusive to interact with others this way. And basically

2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:11.200
 Eastern European society have a taboo against that and especially Russia,

2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:17.360
 the further you go to the East and in the US it's the opposite. You're expected to be

2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:22.160
 hyperanimated in your face and you're also expected to show positive affect.

2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:22.560
 Yes.

2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:26.880
 And if you show positive affect without a good reason in Russia,

2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:31.440
 people will think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person.

2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:40.080
 Exactly. And here positive affect without reason goes either appreciated or goes unnoticed.

2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:45.840
 No, it's the default. It's being expected. Everything is amazing. Have you seen these?

2:43:45.840 --> 2:43:47.600
 Lego movie?

2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:52.800
 No, there was a diagram where somebody gave the appraisals that exist in the US and Russia,

2:43:52.800 --> 2:44:02.080
 so you have your bell curve. And the lower 10% in the US, it's a good start. Everything

2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:04.400
 above the lowest 10%, it's amazing.

2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:05.200
 It's amazing.

2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:14.800
 And for Russians, everything below the top 10%, it's terrible. And then everything except the

2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:19.840
 top percent is, I don't like it. And the top percent is even so.

2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:25.600
 It's funny, but it's kind of true.

2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:33.440
 There's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how we construct meaning in the US. Usually you focus on

2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:40.400
 the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative aspects. And in our Eastern European

2:44:40.400 --> 2:44:46.880
 traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something above the waterline, you also need to

2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:50.480
 put something below the waterline because existence by itself is as best neutral.

2:44:51.360 --> 2:44:56.240
 Right. That's the basic intuition, at best neutral. Or it could be just suffering,

2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:56.800
 the default is suffering.

2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:02.160
 There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty are inextricably linked to the reality

2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:07.280
 of suffering. And to not acknowledge the reality of suffering means that you are really stupid and

2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:11.680
 unaware of the fact that basically every conscious being spends most of the time suffering.

2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:19.680
 Yeah. You just summarized the ethos of the Eastern Europe. Yeah. Most of life is suffering

2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:24.480
 with an occasional moments of beauty. And if your facial expressions don't acknowledge

2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:29.840
 the abundance of suffering in the world and in existence itself, then you must be an idiot.

2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:36.000
 It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the US and you, in some sense,

2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:40.960
 preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that are embedded in your

2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:46.800
 own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid and asks you,

2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:53.840
 why is Ariel not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. She's a siren. Sirens

2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:58.080
 eat people. You don't play with your food. It does not end well. And then you tell her the original

2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:02.640
 story, which is not the one by Anderson, which is the romantic one. And there's a much darker one,

2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:11.040
 which is Undine's story. What happened? So Undine is a mermaid or a water woman. She lives on the

2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:15.440
 ground of a river and she meets this prince and they fall in love. And the prince really,

2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:20.800
 really wants to be with her. And she says, okay, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman.

2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:24.240
 If you marry somebody else, even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe

2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:29.520
 underwater and have other things to do than managing your kingdom as you have here, you will

2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:35.040
 die. And eventually after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her. And

2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:41.520
 she shows up and quietly goes into his chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do

2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:46.480
 so because she is fierce. And she comes quietly and sad out of his chamber. And they ask her,

2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:50.240
 what has happened? What did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death.

2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:52.480
 All done.

2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:59.280
 And you know the Anderson story, right? In the Anderson story, the mermaid is playing with

2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:04.240
 this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and she cannot live out there. So she is

2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:11.360
 giving up her voice and her tale for a human like appearance so she can walk among the humans. But

2:47:11.360 --> 2:47:16.880
 this guy does not recognize that she is the one that you would marry. Instead, he marries somebody

2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:22.160
 who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his own kingdom and so on,

2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:25.200
 as he should. And she dies.

2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:35.040
 Yeah. Instead, Disney, the Little Mermaid story has a little bit of a happy ending. That's the

2:47:35.040 --> 2:47:37.040
 Western, that's the American way.

2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.280
 My own problem is this, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other things. So

2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:46.960
 I'm indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You

2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:51.520
 sacrifice your life for romantic love. That's what you do. Because if you are confronted with

2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.120
 either serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing under the economic and social and

2:47:57.680 --> 2:48:01.440
 other human incentives, that's wrong. You should follow your heart.

2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:09.520
 So do you think suffering is fundamental to happiness along these lines?

2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:14.640
 Suffering is the result of caring about things that you cannot change. And if you are able to

2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:17.840
 change what you care about to those things that you can change, you will not suffer.

2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:22.160
 But would you then be able to experience happiness?

2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:27.680
 Yes. But happiness itself is not important. Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child,

2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:30.720
 you think cookies are very important and you want to have all the cookies in the world,

2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:34.160
 you look forward to being an adult because then you have as many cookies as you want.

2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:39.440
 But as an adult, you realize a cookie is a tool. It's a tool to make you eat vegetables.

2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:43.280
 And once you eat your vegetables anyway, you stop eating cookies for the most part,

2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:46.560
 because otherwise you will get diabetes and will not be around for your kids.

2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:51.760
 Yes, but then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie, if scarcity is enforced,

2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:54.560
 nevertheless, so like the pleasure comes from the scarcity.

2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:59.760
 Yes. But the happiness is a cookie that your brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the

2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:03.600
 environment. The environment cannot make you happy. It's your appraisal of the environment

2:49:03.600 --> 2:49:07.840
 that makes you happy. And if you can change the appraisal of the environment, which you can learn

2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:11.920
 to, then you can create arbitrary states of happiness. And some meditators fall into this

2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:16.560
 trap. So they discover the womb, this basement womb in their brain where the cookies are made,

2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:20.400
 and they indulge and stuff themselves. And after a few months, it gets really old and

2:49:20.400 --> 2:49:25.360
 the big crisis of meaning comes. Because they thought before that their unhappiness was the

2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:29.600
 result of not being happy enough. So they fixed this, right? They can release the newer

2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:35.680
 transmitters at will if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up in a deeper layer.

2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:40.480
 And the question is, why do I live? How can I make a sustainable civilization that is meaningful to

2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:44.240
 me? How can I insert myself into this? And this was the problem that you couldn't solve in the

2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:53.360
 first place. But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same question. What is the answer

2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:59.440
 to that? What could the possible answer be of the meaning of life? What could an answer be? What is

2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:06.000
 it to you? I think that if you look at the meaning of life, you look at what the cell is. Life is the

2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:14.160
 cell. Or this principle, the cell. It's this self organizing thing that can participate in evolution.

2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:18.160
 In order to make it work, it's a molecular machine. It needs a self replicator and an

2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:22.560
 entropy extractor and a Turing machine. If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell

2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:27.520
 and it is not living. And life is basically the emergent complexity over that principle.

2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:32.560
 Once you have this intelligent super molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot

2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:37.920
 make it do. It's probably the optimal computronium and especially in terms of resilience. It's very

2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:45.200
 hard to sterilize the planet once it's infected with life. So it's active function of these three

2:50:45.200 --> 2:50:51.600
 components or the supercell cell is present in the cell, it's present in us, and it's just...

2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:55.600
 We are just an expression of the cell. It's a certain layer of complexity in the organization

2:50:55.600 --> 2:51:02.000
 of cells. So in a way, it's tempting to think of the cell as a von Neumann probe. If you want to

2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:06.480
 build intelligence on other planets, the best way to do this is to infect them with cells

2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:11.600
 and wait for long enough and there's a reasonable chance the stuff is going to evolve into an

2:51:11.600 --> 2:51:14.880
 information processing principle that is general enough to become sentient.

2:51:16.400 --> 2:51:21.360
 That idea is very akin to the same dream and beautiful ideas that are expressed to

2:51:21.360 --> 2:51:26.000
 cellular automata in their most simple mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some

2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:32.160
 basic mechanisms of replication and so on, basic rules, amazing things would emerge.

2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:38.000
 The cell is able to do something that James Trardy calls existential design. He points out

2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:42.880
 that in technical design, we go from the outside in. We work in a highly controlled environment in

2:51:42.880 --> 2:51:48.080
 which everything is deterministic, like our computers, our labs, or our engineering workshops.

2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:53.120
 And then we use this determinism to implement a particular kind of function that we dream up and

2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:57.600
 that seamlessly interfaces with all the other deterministic functions that we already have in

2:51:57.600 --> 2:52:04.080
 our world. So it's basically from the outside in. Biological systems designed from the inside out

2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:11.200
 as seed will become a seedling by taking some of the relatively unorganized matter around it and

2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:16.560
 turning it into its own structure and thereby subdue the environment. Cells can cooperate if

2:52:16.560 --> 2:52:21.040
 they can rely on other cells having a similar organization that is already compatible. But

2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:27.280
 unless that's there, the cell needs to divide to create that structure by itself. So it's a

2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:32.640
 self organizing principle that works on a somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in

2:52:32.640 --> 2:52:38.960
 this sense is to produce complexity. And the complexity allows you to harvest entropy gradients

2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:43.920
 that you couldn't harvest without the complexity. And in this sense, intelligence and life are very

2:52:43.920 --> 2:52:48.800
 strongly connected because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control under conditions

2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:53.760
 and the conditions of complexity. So basically, you shift the boundary between the ordered systems

2:52:53.760 --> 2:53:00.960
 into the realm of chaos. You build bridge heads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we

2:53:00.960 --> 2:53:05.200
 are doing. This is not necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors

2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:09.280
 for that we are all for outside of the priors, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists if the

2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:16.720
 mind projects it. That is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is

2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:22.880
 to try to build and maintain a sustainable civilization. And taking a slight step outside

2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:34.400
 of that, we talked about a man with a beard and God, but something, some mechanism, perhaps must

2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:42.480
 have planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God?

2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:48.000
 And what would that look like? If there was no spontaneous biogenesis, in the sense that the

2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:54.160
 first cell formed by some happy random accidents where the molecules just happened to be in the

2:53:54.160 --> 2:53:59.600
 right constellation to each other. But there could also be the mechanism that allows for the random.

2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:04.720
 I mean, there's like turtles all the way down. There seems to be, there has to be a head turtle

2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:10.480
 at the bottom. Let's consider something really wild. Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant

2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:16.240
 could become intelligent? What would that involve? So imagine you have vortices that spontaneously

2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:21.360
 emerge on the gas giants, like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years.

2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:24.880
 And some of these storm systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the

2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:30.240
 clouds are ferromagnetic or something. And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react

2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:34.960
 rather than other clouds and thereby produce some self stabilizing patterns that eventually

2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:40.560
 lead to regulation feedback loops, nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such this

2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:44.960
 thing that basically has emergent self sustaining, self organizing complexity. And at some point,

2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:50.320
 this breaks up and realizes and basically lam solaris, I am a thinking planet, but I will not

2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:55.680
 replicate because I can recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just

2:54:55.680 --> 2:55:01.840
 basically an intelligence that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds a

2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:05.680
 von Neumann probe and the best von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell.

2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:10.560
 So maybe it, because it's very, very clever and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out.

2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.400
 And one of them has infected our planet. And I'm not suggesting that this is the case,

2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:19.120
 but it would be compatible with the Prince Birmingham hypothesis. And it was my intuition

2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:24.160
 that our biogenesis is very unlikely. It's possible, but you probably need to roll the

2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:28.240
 cosmic dice very often, maybe more often than there are planetary surfaces. I don't know.

2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:37.360
 So God is just a large enough, a system that's large enough that allows randomness.

2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:41.440
 No, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation. I think it's a mistranslation

2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:46.800
 of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is actually the childhood

2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:51.600
 memories of a God. So the, when. Sorry, Genesis is the.

2:55:51.600 --> 2:55:57.280
 The childhood memories of a God. It's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being.

2:55:57.280 --> 2:55:57.840
 Wow.

2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:03.680
 And we typically interpret Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being.

2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:04.240
 Yes.

2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:12.160
 And I think when you read it, there is light and darkness that is being created. And then you

2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:18.880
 discover sky and ground, create them. You construct the plants and the animals and you

2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:24.320
 give everything their names and so on. That's basically cognitive development. It's a sequence

2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:28.320
 of steps that every mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have

2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:33.040
 children, you can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness and then they

2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:37.120
 make out directions in it and they discover sky and ground and they discover the plants and the

2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:41.520
 animals and they give everything their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind

2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:46.160
 because it's not given. Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns

2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:52.560
 on your retina. Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it,

2:56:52.560 --> 2:56:57.120
 this would not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not

2:56:57.120 --> 2:57:03.280
 have the magical power to give meaning to our existence. So this equation of a creator god

2:57:03.280 --> 2:57:07.840
 with the god of meaning is a sleight of hand. You shouldn't do it.

2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:12.080
 The other one that is done in Catholicism is the equation of the first mover,

2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:17.440
 the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton that runs the universe. Aristotle

2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:23.600
 says if things are moving and things seem to be moving here, something must move them. If something

2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:28.080
 moves them, something must move the thing that is moving it. So there must be a prime mover.

2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.400
 This idea to say that this prime mover is a supernatural being is complete nonsense.

2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:39.120
 It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we have to explain the enormity that this automaton

2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:45.520
 exists at all. But again, we don't have any possibility to infer anything about its properties

2:57:45.520 --> 2:57:51.440
 except that it's able to produce change in information. So there needs to be some kind

2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:56.400
 of computational principle. This is all there is. But to say this automaton is identical again with

2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:02.000
 the creator of the first cause or with the thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion.

2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:08.080
 No, I think that what we perceive is the higher being that we are part of. The higher being that

2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:13.200
 we are part of is the civilization. It's the thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell

2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:19.360
 has to our body. And we have this prior because we have evolved to organize in these structures.

2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:24.720
 So basically, the Christian God in its natural form without the mythology,

2:58:24.720 --> 2:58:28.240
 if you undress it, is basically the platonic form of the civilization.

2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:32.480
 Is the ideal?

2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:36.240
 Yes, it's this ideal that you try to approximate when you interact with others,

2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:38.880
 not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right.

2:58:38.880 --> 2:58:45.520
 Wow, we covered a lot of ground. And we're left with one of my favorite lines, and there's many,

2:58:45.520 --> 2:58:54.880
 which is happiness is a cookie that the brain bakes itself. It's been a huge honor and a

2:58:54.880 --> 2:58:58.640
 pleasure to talk to you. I'm sure our paths will cross many times again.

2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:02.480
 Joshua, thank you so much for talking today. I really appreciate it.

2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:05.760

2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:45.200
 spell it without the E. And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Joshua Bach.

2:59:46.400 --> 2:59:51.760
 If you take this as a computer game metaphor, this is the best level for humanity to play.

2:59:52.720 --> 2:59:59.760
 And this best level happens to be the last level, as it happens against the backdrop of a dying

2:59:59.760 --> 3:00:07.440
 world. But it's still the best level. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
