00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
 How are these interacting with our fighters if they are?

00:02.420 --> 00:03.780
 How are they interacting with the weather

00:03.780 --> 00:04.980
 and their environment?

00:04.980 --> 00:06.540
 How are they interacting with each other?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.620
 So can we look at these and how they're interacting

00:08.620 --> 00:10.540
 perhaps as a swarm?

00:10.540 --> 00:12.100
 Especially off the East Coast where this is happening

00:12.100 --> 00:14.500
 all the time with multiple objects.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.180
 The following is a conversation

00:18.180 --> 00:19.980
 with Lieutenant Ryan Graves,

00:19.980 --> 00:22.020
 former Navy fighter pilot,

00:22.020 --> 00:24.100
 including roles as a combat lead,

00:24.100 --> 00:28.460
 landing signals officer and rescue mission commander.

00:28.460 --> 00:31.780
 He and people in his squadron detected UFOs

00:31.780 --> 00:33.340
 on multiple occasions.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.940
 And he has been one of the few people

00:35.940 --> 00:38.660
 willing to speak publicly about these experiences

00:38.660 --> 00:42.260
 and about the importance of investigating these sightings,

00:42.260 --> 00:45.500
 especially for national security reasons.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.860
 Ryan has a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering

00:48.860 --> 00:52.540
 from WPI and an interest in career roles

00:52.540 --> 00:54.420
 in advanced technology development,

00:54.420 --> 00:57.540
 including multiagent collaborative autonomy,

00:57.540 --> 01:00.180
 machine learning assisted air to air combat,

01:00.180 --> 01:03.220
 manned and unmanned teaming technologies,

01:03.220 --> 01:05.820
 and most recently, development of materials

01:05.820 --> 01:08.220
 through quantum simulation.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.260
 This is a Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:12.460 --> 01:13.820
 in the description.

01:13.820 --> 01:17.180
 And now, dear friends, here's Ryan Graves.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.460
 What did you think of the new Top Gun movie?

01:20.460 --> 01:21.740
 How accurate was it?

01:21.740 --> 01:22.940
 Let's start there.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.660
 I thought the flying was really accurate.

01:25.660 --> 01:28.260
 I thought the type of flying they did

01:28.260 --> 01:30.320
 and how they approached the actual mission,

01:31.340 --> 01:33.380
 of course, had a lot of liberties.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.500
 But one thing that seems to be hard to capture

01:35.500 --> 01:38.340
 on these types of things are the chess game that's going on

01:38.340 --> 01:40.380
 while that type of flying is happening.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.900
 The chess game between, like in a dog fight,

01:42.900 --> 01:45.540
 between the pilots and the enemy,

01:45.540 --> 01:47.460
 or between the different pilots?

01:47.460 --> 01:49.500
 I'll even speak to just that particular mission.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.340
 They flew there.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.220
 And for that particular mission,

01:52.220 --> 01:54.980
 it's kind of a chess game with yourself

01:54.980 --> 01:56.460
 to get everything in place.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.060
 So what kind of flight they flew

01:59.060 --> 02:00.820
 is called a high threat scenario,

02:00.820 --> 02:02.900
 which means they have to ingress low

02:02.900 --> 02:05.100
 due to the surface to air threats,

02:05.100 --> 02:08.020
 the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.700
 And they have to ingress low and pop up

02:09.700 --> 02:11.300
 like we see in the movie.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.460
 And in that particular movie,

02:12.460 --> 02:13.900
 that was a preplanned strike.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.620
 They knew exactly where they were going.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.660
 But there's a scenario where we have to operate

02:17.660 --> 02:18.640
 in that type of environment,

02:18.640 --> 02:20.720
 and we don't know exactly where we're going to strike

02:20.720 --> 02:23.400
 or we're going to be adapting to real time targets.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.100
 And so in that scenario, you would have

02:25.100 --> 02:26.900
 one of those fighters down low like that

02:26.900 --> 02:28.780
 operating as a mission commander,

02:28.780 --> 02:30.340
 as a forward air controller.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.160
 And he's out there calling shots,

02:32.160 --> 02:33.540
 joining on those other players

02:33.540 --> 02:35.660
 in order to ensure they're pointed at the right target.

02:35.660 --> 02:38.780
 So that's a bit of the chess game that he'll be playing.

02:38.780 --> 02:40.180
 Can you actually describe for people

02:40.180 --> 02:43.460
 who haven't seen the movie what the mission actually is?

02:43.460 --> 02:44.280
 Yeah.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.140
 What's involved in the mission?

02:45.140 --> 02:47.260
 So in this particular mission,

02:47.260 --> 02:49.520
 it's kind of what we would call a preplanned strike.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.000
 So there's a known location

02:51.000 --> 02:53.380
 that's in a heavily defended area.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.540
 And the air crew, in this case,

02:55.540 --> 02:59.540
 I believe it was four F18s on the initial package,

02:59.540 --> 03:02.580
 their job was to ingress very low down a canyon

03:02.580 --> 03:05.020
 to stay out of the radar window of the surface

03:05.020 --> 03:06.220
 to air threats.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.740
 What does ingress mean?

03:07.740 --> 03:09.740
 Ingress means that they're going to be pushing

03:09.740 --> 03:13.040
 from a start location towards the target or the objective.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.060
 So there's an ingress portion of the mission

03:15.060 --> 03:16.500
 and an egress portion of the mission.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.860
 Oh, okay.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.180
 Like the entrance and the exit type of thing.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.020
 Got it.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.540
 But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?

03:24.540 --> 03:26.020
 Cause when we're entering someplace,

03:26.020 --> 03:27.900
 we have the option to enter.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.340
 But when we go drop a bomb on location, we're exiting.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.820
 We don't have that luxury.

03:32.820 --> 03:33.780
 We don't have that option.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.420
 So it actually changes our tactics and our aggression level.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.260
 Got it.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.340
 And so they were flying low to the ground

03:40.340 --> 03:43.840
 and then there's a surface to air missiles

03:43.840 --> 03:47.140
 that forced them to have to fly low.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.580
 Is that a realistic thing?

03:48.580 --> 03:49.740
 It is realistic.

03:49.740 --> 03:52.220
 So driving those aircraft in the clutter,

03:52.220 --> 03:54.900
 you know, all radar systems or most I should say

03:54.900 --> 03:57.260
 are essentially line of sight.

03:57.260 --> 03:59.140
 And so they're going to be limited by the horizon

03:59.140 --> 04:00.660
 or any clutter out there.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.840
 And even a number of radars, if they are located up high

04:03.840 --> 04:06.660
 and looking down towards that aircraft,

04:06.660 --> 04:11.460
 the clutter or all the objects such as trees and canyons

04:11.460 --> 04:13.500
 can have effect on radar systems.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.260
 And so it can be a type of camouflage.

04:16.260 --> 04:17.860
 So that's a camouflage for the radar,

04:17.860 --> 04:21.220
 but what about the surface to air missile?

04:21.220 --> 04:25.780
 Is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles flies so low,

04:25.780 --> 04:30.180
 like fly I guess below their level?

04:31.060 --> 04:32.340
 As far as I know, you know,

04:32.340 --> 04:34.500
 you can fly under any radar right now.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.200
 We don't have necessarily radars

04:36.200 --> 04:37.940
 that can look through anything.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.660
 So there is always going to be the ability to mask yourself,

04:41.660 --> 04:43.460
 but with a larger number of assets

04:43.460 --> 04:45.740
 and distributed communication networks,

04:45.740 --> 04:47.540
 where those radars are looking,

04:47.540 --> 04:48.500
 it makes all the difference.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.020
 And I said, they're ingressing past an IAS

04:51.020 --> 04:52.980
 and that's an integrated air defense system.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.600
 And that linking of air defense systems

04:55.600 --> 04:58.980
 is what makes it so hard, so complicated

04:58.980 --> 05:00.600
 is that the sensors and the weapons

05:00.600 --> 05:02.420
 are disassociated from each other.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.100
 So that if you took out the target that was shooting at you,

05:06.100 --> 05:09.160
 it still has ability to intercept you

05:09.160 --> 05:11.500
 from another radar location.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.960
 So it's distributed and it's stronger that way.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.540
 You mean the surface to air missiles,

05:18.420 --> 05:20.820
 like it's a distributed system

05:20.820 --> 05:22.660
 in that if you take out one,

05:22.660 --> 05:26.060
 they're still able to sort of integrate information

05:26.060 --> 05:28.260
 about your location and strike at you.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.100
 Correct.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.840
 And there's a lot of complication that can go,

05:30.840 --> 05:32.100
 you know, once we start thinking about

05:32.100 --> 05:33.460
 distributed systems like that

05:33.460 --> 05:35.500
 and the ability to self heal and repair

05:35.500 --> 05:39.900
 and adapt to losses, it's an interesting area.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.860
 Are you responsible for thinking about that

05:41.860 --> 05:43.460
 when you're flying an airplane?

05:43.460 --> 05:47.060
 To some degree, when we ingress to an area like that,

05:47.060 --> 05:50.060
 we're presented with information about targets,

05:50.060 --> 05:52.080
 air to air or air to surface,

05:52.080 --> 05:54.060
 or surface to air, I should say.

05:54.060 --> 05:57.700
 And we can essentially see where essentially

05:57.700 --> 06:00.420
 the danger zone, if you will, is located.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.340
 And so essentially we would stay out of that.

06:02.340 --> 06:05.860
 And so having a full picture of the environment

06:05.860 --> 06:07.940
 is extremely important because, you know,

06:07.940 --> 06:09.300
 at the end of the day, if we go in that circle,

06:09.300 --> 06:10.480
 we can die pretty quickly.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.740
 So it's absolutely crucial.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.300
 So there's regions that have higher and lower danger

06:16.300 --> 06:17.940
 based on your understanding of the actual,

06:17.940 --> 06:22.060
 whatever the surface to air missiles systems are.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.220
 So you can kind of know.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.100
 That's interesting.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.940
 I wonder how automated that could be too,

06:26.940 --> 06:29.380
 especially when you don't know.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.820
 It seems like in the movie they knew

06:30.820 --> 06:32.180
 the location of everything.

06:33.060 --> 06:37.460
 I imagine that's less known in most cases.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.760
 And also, a lot of those systems

06:39.760 --> 06:41.820
 might be a little bit more ghetto

06:41.820 --> 06:43.580
 if I can use that technical term.

06:43.580 --> 06:47.180
 Like I've gotten, ad hoc maybe is the,

06:47.180 --> 06:49.340
 I don't know.

06:49.340 --> 06:52.340
 But having just recently visited Ukraine

06:52.340 --> 06:55.340
 and seen a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,

06:55.340 --> 06:58.100
 there's a lot of improvised type of systems.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.900
 So you take high tech, like advanced technology,

07:01.900 --> 07:04.260
 but the way you deploy it and the way you organize it

07:04.260 --> 07:08.620
 is very improvised and ad hoc and is responding

07:08.620 --> 07:11.260
 to the uncertainty and the dynamic environment.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.860
 And so from an enemy perspective

07:13.860 --> 07:16.740
 or whoever's trying to deal with that kind of system,

07:16.740 --> 07:17.840
 it's hard to figure it out.

07:17.840 --> 07:22.060
 Because it's like me, I played tennis for a long time

07:22.060 --> 07:24.060
 and it's always easier to play,

07:24.060 --> 07:25.820
 this is true for all sports,

07:25.820 --> 07:27.380
 play tennis against a good tennis player

07:27.380 --> 07:29.220
 versus a crappy tennis player.

07:29.220 --> 07:32.500
 Because the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.340
 And that's really difficult to deal with.

07:34.340 --> 07:36.060
 It seemed like in the movie the systems

07:36.060 --> 07:38.980
 were really well organized.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.900
 And so you could plan.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.940
 And there's a very nice ravine

07:41.940 --> 07:43.380
 that went right down the middle of them.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.820
 That's how movies work, isn't it?

07:44.820 --> 07:45.660
 Yeah.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.320
 But no, I absolutely agree.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.580
 So what you say is a very good point.

07:50.580 --> 07:54.540
 And if we were to take a chunk of airspace

07:54.540 --> 07:56.360
 and break it up into little bits,

07:56.360 --> 07:58.060
 there'd be places that are better to fly

07:58.060 --> 08:00.260
 or less good to fly.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.620
 And we are seeing that now

08:02.620 --> 08:05.300
 with what they call manned unmanned teaming.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.520
 We see tactical aircraft or some type of aircraft

08:08.520 --> 08:11.140
 or platform that's being automated.

08:11.140 --> 08:13.580
 And it's not being automated in traditional sense

08:13.580 --> 08:15.540
 where people think aircrew are flying them around

08:15.540 --> 08:16.360
 to conduct missions.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.220
 But it's very high level objective orientated

08:20.220 --> 08:22.620
 mission planning that allows the aircrew

08:22.620 --> 08:25.660
 to act more as a mission planner,

08:25.660 --> 08:27.820
 mission commander versus having to just pick

08:27.820 --> 08:29.700
 the right assets or fly them around

08:29.700 --> 08:34.020
 or manipulate them somewhat physically.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.020
 So actually going back to the chess thing,

08:36.020 --> 08:37.500
 can you elaborate on what you mean

08:37.500 --> 08:40.260
 by playing a game of chess with yourself?

08:40.260 --> 08:42.380
 What's, when you're flying that mission,

08:42.380 --> 08:43.780
 what exactly do you mean by that?

08:43.780 --> 08:46.100
 Well, there's a few people you're usually fighting against

08:46.100 --> 08:48.180
 in the air, you know, there's the bad guys

08:48.180 --> 08:52.340
 and then there's physics and mother nature, right?

08:52.340 --> 08:56.500
 So when we're down at about 100 feet,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.660
 it's a chess game to stay alive for the pilot

08:58.660 --> 09:00.220
 and it's a chess game for the whizzo

09:00.220 --> 09:02.660
 to process the information he needs

09:02.660 --> 09:04.880
 and then communicate it to all those other aircraft

09:04.880 --> 09:06.460
 that were flying around to ensure

09:06.460 --> 09:08.420
 that they're putting their weapons on the right target.

09:08.420 --> 09:09.580
 What's the whizzo?

09:09.580 --> 09:11.380
 Wizzo is a weapons systems officer.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.600
 He's a backseater who is not a pilot,

09:13.600 --> 09:16.020
 but they're responsible for radar manipulation

09:16.020 --> 09:19.100
 and communications and weapons appointments

09:19.100 --> 09:19.940
 of certain natures.

09:19.940 --> 09:22.140
 So the chess game is against physics,

09:22.140 --> 09:23.220
 against the enemy.

09:24.520 --> 09:25.760
 Time.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.760
 Time, what about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?

09:31.180 --> 09:32.020
 No.

09:32.020 --> 09:35.340
 No, there's no time for that type of self reflection

09:35.340 --> 09:36.740
 while we're flying.

09:36.740 --> 09:41.100
 I want to get to that, but I don't want to forget

09:41.100 --> 09:43.180
 the point that you made about increased randomness

09:43.180 --> 09:45.500
 being a tactical advantage.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.920
 You know, as we, as you mentioned, you know,

09:47.920 --> 09:49.780
 you can introduce autonomy into there

09:49.780 --> 09:51.940
 and when you bring autonomy in there

09:51.940 --> 09:55.180
 and my expectation would be as we bring different abilities

09:55.180 --> 09:57.540
 and machine learning, as we gather more data,

09:57.540 --> 10:00.700
 we're going to be able to bring the tactical environment

10:00.700 --> 10:03.100
 around that jet, the war space that it goes into

10:03.100 --> 10:05.540
 will almost be at a stochastic level from the enemy's

10:05.540 --> 10:08.100
 perspective, where it'll almost seem like

10:08.100 --> 10:10.720
 every tactical environment they go in will be random

10:10.720 --> 10:13.980
 and yet very deadly because the system is providing

10:13.980 --> 10:17.620
 a new tactical solution essentially

10:17.620 --> 10:18.980
 for that particular scenario.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.900
 Instead of just training to particular tactics

10:21.900 --> 10:24.900
 that have to be repeatable and trainable and lethal, right?

10:24.900 --> 10:26.300
 But not necessarily the most lethal

10:26.300 --> 10:28.260
 because they have to be trainable.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.900
 But if we can introduce AI into that

10:29.900 --> 10:32.800
 and to have a level of randomness

10:32.800 --> 10:35.980
 or at least appearance of randomness due to complexity,

10:35.980 --> 10:38.260
 you know, I would consider it like a stochastic

10:38.260 --> 10:40.580
 tactical advantage because even our own blue fighters

10:40.580 --> 10:41.960
 won't be able to engage in that fight

10:41.960 --> 10:45.660
 because it would be unsafe essentially for anything else.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.560
 And I think that's where we have to drive to

10:47.560 --> 10:49.380
 because otherwise it's always this chicken and mouse

10:49.380 --> 10:51.940
 cat game about who's tactics and who knows what.

10:51.940 --> 10:54.700
 But if knowledge is no longer a factor,

10:54.700 --> 10:56.480
 it's going to make things a lot different.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.320
 That's really interesting.

10:57.320 --> 11:02.320
 So out of the many things that are part of your expertise,

11:03.140 --> 11:06.780
 your journey, you're also working on autonomous

11:06.780 --> 11:08.980
 and semi autonomous systems, the use of AI

11:08.980 --> 11:11.460
 and machine learning and manned on man team

11:11.460 --> 11:12.300
 and all that kind of stuff.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.020
 We'll talk about it.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.120
 But you're saying sort of when people think about

11:17.120 --> 11:20.580
 the use of AI in war, in military systems,

11:20.580 --> 11:23.980
 they think about like computer vision for perception

11:23.980 --> 11:26.740
 or processing of sensor information

11:26.740 --> 11:29.700
 in order to extract from it actionable knowledge

11:29.700 --> 11:30.540
 kind of thing.

11:30.540 --> 11:33.860
 But you're saying you could also use it to generate

11:33.860 --> 11:37.740
 randomness that's difficult to work with

11:37.740 --> 11:39.880
 in like a game theoretic way.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.540
 Like it's difficult for human operators to respond to.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.460
 Exactly.

11:44.460 --> 11:45.460
 That's really interesting.

11:45.460 --> 11:48.780
 Okay, so back to Tom Cruise and Tom Gunn.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.420
 What about the dog fighting?

11:51.420 --> 11:53.660
 What aspects of that were accurate?

11:53.660 --> 11:58.140
 So dog fighting is kind of an interesting conversation

11:58.140 --> 12:00.980
 because it's not the most tactically relevant skill set

12:00.980 --> 12:03.660
 nowadays by traditional standards

12:03.660 --> 12:06.060
 because the ranges with which we engage

12:06.060 --> 12:09.460
 and play weapons are very significant.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.940
 And so if we're in a scenario where we're in a dog fight

12:11.940 --> 12:15.580
 like that, a lot of things have probably gone wrong, right?

12:15.580 --> 12:17.860
 And that's kind of how this mission was set up, right?

12:17.860 --> 12:21.660
 It was a no win type scenario, most likely.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.020
 And so for a dog fight, the aircraft size

12:24.020 --> 12:25.620
 and the ranges and the turn radiuses

12:25.620 --> 12:27.980
 make it so it's not very theatrical, right?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.300
 The aircraft looks small.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.580
 And while it's intense with the systems I have

12:31.580 --> 12:34.480
 and the sensors and what I'm feeling and all that,

12:34.480 --> 12:36.440
 if I, you know, we've done it and we've done it, right?

12:36.440 --> 12:38.700
 We take video of that and it's just like a blue sky

12:38.700 --> 12:39.760
 and you see a little dot out there.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.740
 So not very interesting.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.920
 And so anytime it really looks interesting

12:42.920 --> 12:46.540
 in dog fight arena, that's most likely a fiction

12:46.540 --> 12:49.100
 because we really only get close for a millisecond

12:49.100 --> 12:50.900
 as we're dipping past each other at the merge.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.100
 You're breaking my heart, right?

12:52.100 --> 12:52.940
 I know, I'm sorry.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.260
 You're breaking my heart.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.100
 No, I understand.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.440
 In a dog fight, you can go and have fun,

12:56.440 --> 12:58.340
 but you know, in a dog fight specifically.

12:58.340 --> 13:00.660
 Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars,

13:00.660 --> 13:02.720
 the World War II and before that,

13:02.720 --> 13:06.660
 where the, is it due to the sort of the range

13:06.660 --> 13:09.220
 and the effectiveness of the weapon systems involved?

13:09.220 --> 13:10.060
 Correct.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.700
 And the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.280
 But there's also a train of thought

13:15.280 --> 13:16.960
 that hasn't actually been tested out yet,

13:16.960 --> 13:21.580
 which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare,

13:21.580 --> 13:25.060
 EW and or unmanned assets,

13:25.060 --> 13:27.300
 the battle space may get so complex

13:27.300 --> 13:31.380
 and missiles may essentially just get dropped out of the sky

13:31.380 --> 13:34.340
 or wasted such that you're gonna be in close

13:34.340 --> 13:36.460
 with either IR missiles or guns,

13:36.460 --> 13:40.860
 if it's a no kidding, you know, must defend type scenario.

13:40.860 --> 13:42.840
 First of all, what's electronic warfare?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.460
 You know, it's basically trying to get control

13:44.460 --> 13:47.540
 of electromagnetic spectrum for the interest

13:47.540 --> 13:49.940
 of whatever operation is going on.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.460
 So in the tactical environment,

13:51.460 --> 13:53.580
 a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar

13:53.580 --> 13:55.860
 or can we deceive the missiles or just, you know,

13:55.860 --> 13:58.820
 stop their guide and things of that nature.

13:58.820 --> 14:01.780
 Man, it's a battle in the space of information,

14:01.780 --> 14:03.900
 of digital information.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.860
 Yeah, well F22 and F35, right?

14:05.860 --> 14:07.660
 F22 is a big expensive aircraft

14:07.660 --> 14:10.060
 and it was made to be a great fighter.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.300
 But the F35 is not as great of a fighter,

14:12.300 --> 14:14.840
 but it's an electronic warfare

14:14.840 --> 14:18.560
 and mission commander platform of the future

14:18.560 --> 14:20.780
 where information is what's gonna win the war

14:20.780 --> 14:22.140
 instead of the best dog fighter.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.020
 And so it's interesting dichotomy there.

14:24.020 --> 14:27.400
 What's the best airplane ever made, fighter jet ever made?

14:27.400 --> 14:31.100
 I know the aviators in the audience are gonna hate my answer

14:31.100 --> 14:33.180
 because they're gonna want that sexy, you know,

14:33.180 --> 14:36.260
 muscly F14 Tomcat type fighter

14:36.260 --> 14:39.060
 or maybe P51 type aircraft.

14:39.060 --> 14:43.580
 But the F35 is maybe not the best dog fighter,

14:43.580 --> 14:45.940
 but it doesn't have to get in a dog fight, right?

14:45.940 --> 14:47.540
 It's like how you'd be the best knife fighters,

14:47.540 --> 14:49.340
 not getting a knife fight sometimes.

14:49.340 --> 14:53.860
 Lockheed Martin F35 Lightning II, it looks pretty sexy.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.700
 There's two real strengths you can have as a fighter.

14:55.700 --> 14:59.260
 You can have the ability to kind of out muscle your fighter,

14:59.260 --> 15:02.500
 your opponent and beat them on Gs and power

15:02.500 --> 15:03.860
 and raid around on them.

15:03.860 --> 15:05.660
 And then there's the other side of that,

15:05.660 --> 15:09.020
 which is you can be overly maneuverable.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.860
 You can bleed energy quickly.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.900
 And that's what the F18 was good at

15:12.900 --> 15:15.580
 because it had to be heavier to land on aircraft carrier.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.500
 We had to give it extra bulk,

15:17.500 --> 15:19.300
 but it also needs a special mechanism

15:19.300 --> 15:21.220
 to slow down enough to land on aircraft carrier.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.820
 And so it made it very maneuverable.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.420
 And what that leads to a lot of times

15:24.420 --> 15:28.260
 is the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.380
 which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn,

15:30.380 --> 15:31.980
 you're gonna bleed a lot of your energy away

15:31.980 --> 15:33.940
 and be more susceptible for follow on shots

15:33.940 --> 15:35.420
 if that one's less susceptible.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.060
 And so there's just kind of aggression,

15:37.060 --> 15:39.340
 nonaggression game you can play depending on

15:39.340 --> 15:40.940
 the type of aircraft you're fighting.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.580
 Where does the F35 land on that spectrum?

15:43.580 --> 15:46.660
 The F35 lands somewhere behind the F22s.

15:46.660 --> 15:49.580
 So there'll probably be a row of F22s or F18s

15:49.580 --> 15:50.980
 and F35 will be out back,

15:50.980 --> 15:52.620
 but it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare

15:52.620 --> 15:53.460
 that's happening in front of you.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.740
 Is it one of the more expensive planes

15:55.740 --> 15:57.340
 because of all the stuff on it?

15:57.340 --> 15:58.540
 It certainly is, yeah.

16:00.140 --> 16:03.820
 In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly it over Mach 10.

16:03.820 --> 16:08.100
 So maybe can you say what are the different speeds,

16:08.100 --> 16:12.380
 accelerations feel like, Mach 1, 2, 3, or hypersonic?

16:12.380 --> 16:14.420
 Have you ever flown hypersonic?

16:14.420 --> 16:15.260
 No.

16:16.580 --> 16:18.180
 How tough does it get?

16:18.180 --> 16:21.100
 I'm just gonna call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10

16:21.100 --> 16:23.460
 just for the record, because in the movie,

16:23.460 --> 16:25.780
 there's been I think at least one ejection

16:25.780 --> 16:29.040
 that was supersonic, and I'll just say it was not pretty,

16:29.040 --> 16:30.380
 but he survived.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.580
 So there would have to be some interesting mechanisms

16:32.580 --> 16:34.300
 to eject successfully at Mach 10,

16:34.300 --> 16:36.100
 but I'll digress on that for the moment.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.460
 Yeah, that seemed very strange.

16:37.460 --> 16:40.220
 And he just walked away from it, but anyway, so.

16:40.220 --> 16:41.340
 He seemed disheveled.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.180
 Okay, it's Tom Cruise.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.820
 It's like Chuck Norris or something.

16:47.820 --> 16:48.660
 Indestructible, yeah.

16:48.660 --> 16:49.480
 Indestructible.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.900
 He also doesn't age.

16:50.900 --> 16:54.880
 But anyway, so what's interesting to say

16:54.880 --> 16:58.380
 about the experience as you go up?

16:58.380 --> 17:00.520
 Does it get more and more difficult?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.220
 In the end of the day, crossing the sound barrier

17:02.220 --> 17:04.460
 is much like crossing the speed limit on the highway.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.160
 You don't really notice anything.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.940
 To cross that, at least in F18,

17:08.940 --> 17:11.060
 because we have a lot more weight than most fighters,

17:11.060 --> 17:13.380
 typically we'll do that in a descent.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.380
 We'll do that full afterburner,

17:15.380 --> 17:17.020
 just dumping gas into the engine.

17:18.060 --> 17:19.820
 And so that'll get us over the fastest

17:19.820 --> 17:22.220
 I think I've gone with about 1.28.

17:22.220 --> 17:23.580
 But what's interesting, people realize,

17:23.580 --> 17:26.540
 is that if I take that throttle in an afterburner

17:26.540 --> 17:29.100
 and I just bring it back, just bring it back to mil,

17:29.100 --> 17:31.660
 which is full power, just not afterburner,

17:31.660 --> 17:34.700
 the deacceleration is so strong due to the air friction

17:34.700 --> 17:36.660
 that it'll throw you forward in your straps.

17:36.660 --> 17:40.580
 Almost, I would say, maybe like 70% as strong almost

17:40.580 --> 17:43.620
 as trapping on the boat, it's pretty strong.

17:43.620 --> 17:44.940
 So it's almost like a reverse car crash

17:44.940 --> 17:45.980
 just for the deacceleration.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.420
 So the acceleration is usually kind of slow

17:48.420 --> 17:49.580
 and you don't feel anything, of course,

17:49.580 --> 17:50.820
 when you're crossing through it,

17:50.820 --> 17:53.000
 but the deacceleration's pretty violent.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.900
 The deacceleration's violent, huh, okay.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.500
 But is there a fundamental difference

17:59.500 --> 18:03.420
 between mach one and hypersonic, mach five and so on?

18:03.420 --> 18:06.020
 Does it require super special training?

18:06.020 --> 18:09.740
 And is that something that's used often in warfare

18:09.740 --> 18:10.740
 or is it not really that necessary?

18:10.740 --> 18:13.980
 No, so hypersonic human flight, if it exists,

18:13.980 --> 18:16.280
 is not something that's employed tactically

18:16.280 --> 18:19.040
 in any sense right now that I'm aware of.

18:19.040 --> 18:23.300
 So I think of hypersonic technology,

18:23.300 --> 18:26.020
 I think of missiles and weapons systems

18:26.020 --> 18:28.900
 and delivery platform, I don't think of fighter aircraft

18:28.900 --> 18:31.180
 necessarily, I can think of bomber

18:31.180 --> 18:33.660
 or reconnaissance aircraft perhaps,

18:33.660 --> 18:37.020
 but those would be more efficient, very long range.

18:37.020 --> 18:40.340
 So I imagine acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.380
 The thing you experience is the acceleration,

18:42.380 --> 18:43.660
 not the actual speed.

18:44.780 --> 18:46.540
 There's been just a small tangent,

18:46.540 --> 18:49.480
 a lot of discussion about hypersonic nuclear weapons,

18:49.480 --> 18:54.300
 like missiles from Russia bragging about that.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.740
 Is this something that's a significant concern

18:56.740 --> 18:57.900
 or is it just a way to flex

18:57.900 --> 19:00.740
 about different kinds of weapons systems?

19:00.740 --> 19:03.540
 Hypersonics, I do think pose a challenge

19:03.540 --> 19:06.880
 for our detection systems because there are,

19:08.260 --> 19:10.180
 you know, there are design considerations

19:10.180 --> 19:12.100
 in these sensor systems as always, right?

19:12.100 --> 19:14.520
 And when you build them and the technology progresses

19:14.520 --> 19:16.080
 to a point where maybe it's not feasible

19:16.080 --> 19:18.020
 to use that technology, you know, there's a problem.

19:18.020 --> 19:22.300
 But with the all domain and kind of cross domain

19:22.300 --> 19:24.220
 data linking capabilities we have,

19:24.220 --> 19:29.220
 it's less of, you know, it's more of an integrated picture,

19:29.340 --> 19:30.260
 I'll say.

19:30.260 --> 19:34.340
 And so the hypersonics are really,

19:34.340 --> 19:36.980
 what it is is how fast can we detect and destroy a problem?

19:36.980 --> 19:39.080
 You're just shortening the time available to do that.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.920
 We call something like that the kill chain, right?

19:40.920 --> 19:45.000
 It's from locating a target and identifying it

19:45.000 --> 19:48.260
 and, you know, essentially authorizing its destruction

19:48.260 --> 19:50.500
 by whatever means, employing,

19:50.500 --> 19:52.340
 and then actually following up to ensure

19:52.340 --> 19:54.300
 that you did what you said you were going to do

19:54.300 --> 19:55.140
 in some sense, right?

19:55.140 --> 19:57.340
 Does it need another reattacks, something of that nature.

19:57.340 --> 20:00.380
 And so there's an old dog fighting framework

20:00.380 --> 20:02.020
 you could call it, it's called the OODA loop

20:02.020 --> 20:04.460
 that kind of made its way in the engineering of business now

20:04.460 --> 20:06.760
 but the old observe, orientate, decide act

20:06.760 --> 20:10.520
 was initially a fighter mechanism in order to get inside

20:10.520 --> 20:12.800
 that kill chain of your opponent and break it up

20:12.800 --> 20:17.180
 so that he can't process his kill chain on you.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.780
 And so hypersonics are a way of shortening those windows

20:19.780 --> 20:23.260
 of opportunity to react to them.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.900
 I wanted to, like, how much do you have to shorten it

20:25.900 --> 20:29.260
 in order for the defense systems not to work anymore?

20:29.260 --> 20:34.260
 It seems like it's very, you know, I'm both often horrified

20:34.960 --> 20:38.740
 by the thought of nuclear war, but at the same time,

20:38.740 --> 20:41.860
 wonder what that looks like.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.080
 When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,

20:46.080 --> 20:49.060
 I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon

20:49.060 --> 20:51.540
 can reach the United States by missile

20:51.540 --> 20:55.300
 with the defense systems, but then again,

20:55.300 --> 20:57.940
 I also understand that these are extremely

20:57.940 --> 21:00.760
 complicated systems, the amount of integration required,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.720
 and because you're not using them,

21:03.720 --> 21:07.020
 I mean, there could be, you know,

21:07.020 --> 21:10.580
 there's like an intern somewhere that like forgot

21:10.580 --> 21:12.900
 to update the code, the Fortran code

21:12.900 --> 21:15.180
 that like is going to make the different,

21:15.180 --> 21:16.580
 because you don't have the opportunity

21:16.580 --> 21:21.580
 to really thoroughly test, which is really scary.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.140
 Of course, the systems are probably incredible

21:24.140 --> 21:26.260
 if they could be tested, but because they can't be

21:26.260 --> 21:31.260
 really thoroughly tested in an actual attack, I wonder.

21:32.820 --> 21:35.820
 I guess one assumption there would be that

21:35.820 --> 21:37.780
 these hypersonic missiles would only be launched

21:37.780 --> 21:38.980
 in the case of an attack.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.940
 It'd be interesting if there were other hypersonic objects

21:41.940 --> 21:44.780
 that we could use to flex those systems.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.260
 Another thing that actually happened,

21:46.260 --> 21:48.220
 and I just have a million questions I want to ask you,

21:48.220 --> 21:51.620
 it's fascinating to me, is there's a bird strike

21:51.620 --> 21:53.700
 on the plane, does that happen often?

21:53.700 --> 21:54.540
 Yeah, it's a serious issue.

21:54.540 --> 21:56.820
 And it damaged the engine, and they made it seem

21:56.820 --> 21:59.240
 like it's a serious, exactly a serious issue.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.200
 I've hit birds, I know someone that took a turkey vulture

22:03.200 --> 22:05.880
 to the face, through the cockpit, right,

22:05.880 --> 22:08.580
 shattered the cockpit, knocked him out.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.700
 I think that, actually, I don't know him personally,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.980
 but it was a story I know from the command I was at,

22:12.980 --> 22:15.560
 and I believe the backseater had to punch out

22:15.560 --> 22:17.700
 and punch them both out because he was unconscious

22:17.700 --> 22:20.060
 in the front seat from the bird.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.300
 It can kill you from hitting you,

22:21.300 --> 22:24.300
 it's like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.

22:25.780 --> 22:30.420
 It can take out an engine very easily.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.840
 Every airport I've flown at in the Navy,

22:32.840 --> 22:36.060
 I've had to check the bird condition, if you will,

22:36.060 --> 22:38.480
 to see how many birds, and we've had to cancel flights

22:38.480 --> 22:40.780
 because there's too many of them around the airport.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.180
 Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.

22:43.180 --> 22:45.900
 Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?

22:45.900 --> 22:48.140
 There is, yeah, there's actual radar systems,

22:48.140 --> 22:51.620
 and you can go in the, certain bases you have to call up,

22:51.620 --> 22:52.940
 and they'll tell you what it is for the day

22:52.940 --> 22:54.580
 or for that hour, and other ones have it

22:54.580 --> 22:58.820
 in their weather report that goes out over the radio.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.940
 What are some technological solutions to this,

23:00.940 --> 23:05.940
 or is this just, because it's a low probability event,

23:06.060 --> 23:07.940
 there's no real solution for it?

23:07.940 --> 23:10.340
 I would say it's not a low probability event.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.900
 This is happening a lot.

23:11.900 --> 23:15.020
 Although the hits themselves aren't necessarily that common,

23:15.020 --> 23:18.780
 or I'll say a catastrophic hit, either a near miss or a hit

23:18.780 --> 23:21.900
 or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it

23:21.900 --> 23:24.500
 is pretty common, and in fact, it seems stressful.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
 It is, it's so common in fact that we know

23:26.500 --> 23:28.260
 that you never want to try to go over,

23:28.260 --> 23:29.740
 or you never want to go under a bird

23:29.740 --> 23:31.180
 if you see it in front of you.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.300
 You always want to try to go over it

23:32.300 --> 23:34.180
 because what they'll do immediately if they see you

23:34.180 --> 23:36.740
 is, and you startle them, is they'll bring their wings in

23:36.740 --> 23:39.080
 and just drop straight down to try to get out of the path.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.620
 It's interesting, I didn't know they did that,

23:40.620 --> 23:43.300
 but so if you immediately, if you try to go under them,

23:43.300 --> 23:44.260
 they're gonna be dropping into you,

23:44.260 --> 23:45.860
 so you typically want to try to go above them.

23:45.860 --> 23:48.060
 Is this something you can train for, or no?

23:49.100 --> 23:50.980
 Is this one of those things you have to really experience?

23:50.980 --> 23:55.140
 It's a skill set that you somewhat train for

23:55.140 --> 23:57.500
 in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense, right?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.500
 Being able to react to your environment very quickly

23:59.500 --> 24:01.620
 and make decisions quickly, so.

24:01.620 --> 24:04.380
 Is that one of the more absurd things,

24:04.380 --> 24:06.660
 challenges you have to deal with in flying?

24:06.660 --> 24:10.660
 Is there other things, sort of maybe weather conditions,

24:10.660 --> 24:11.820
 like harsh weather conditions?

24:11.820 --> 24:14.620
 Is there something that we maybe don't often think about

24:14.620 --> 24:17.140
 in terms of the challenges of flying?

24:17.140 --> 24:20.420
 Birds, in a way, aren't a ridiculous threat for us.

24:20.420 --> 24:25.420
 It's a safety threat that anything physical in the air

24:25.540 --> 24:27.460
 is something that we really have to be careful about,

24:27.460 --> 24:29.540
 whether we're flying formation off of the aircraft

24:29.540 --> 24:32.300
 right next to us or whether it's a turkey vulture

24:32.300 --> 24:35.380
 at 2,000 feet or a flock of 5,000 birds,

24:35.380 --> 24:37.660
 like at the runway, we have to wave off, you know?

24:37.660 --> 24:39.780
 And although they're low probability,

24:39.780 --> 24:41.540
 a lot of bases will have actual

24:41.540 --> 24:44.220
 Environmental Protection Agency employees

24:44.220 --> 24:47.780
 that are responsible for safely removing migratory birds

24:47.780 --> 24:51.580
 or different animals that may be in the runways

24:51.580 --> 24:53.340
 or flying about.

24:53.340 --> 24:55.340
 Wow, I didn't know what a turkey vulture is,

24:55.340 --> 24:57.100
 and it really does look like a mix

24:57.100 --> 24:58.780
 between a vulture and a turkey.

24:58.780 --> 25:00.220
 Turkey.

25:00.220 --> 25:05.220
 And look kind of dumb, no offense to turkey vultures.

25:06.260 --> 25:08.820
 In that movie, who was the enemy nation?

25:08.820 --> 25:13.820
 Was it, I mean, I guess they were implying it's Iran.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.060
 Or was it Russia?

25:17.060 --> 25:18.140
 I didn't think they were implying

25:18.140 --> 25:19.980
 any particular nation state, frankly.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.020
 I think they did a somewhat decent job

25:22.020 --> 25:26.220
 of having some ambiguous fifth generation fighters.

25:26.220 --> 25:30.380
 The location and the stockpile,

25:30.380 --> 25:33.260
 I get how the story kind of insinuates certain things,

25:33.260 --> 25:34.300
 but they seem to do a good job

25:34.300 --> 25:36.820
 of not having anything directly pointing to another nation,

25:36.820 --> 25:38.940
 which I thought was the good move.

25:38.940 --> 25:42.140
 I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator

25:42.140 --> 25:44.340
 and as an American, right?

25:44.340 --> 25:45.500
 Because it's a feel good movie,

25:45.500 --> 25:48.980
 but we shouldn't be celebrating going to war

25:48.980 --> 25:51.420
 with any particular country, China, Russia,

25:51.420 --> 25:52.820
 whoever may have these weapons.

25:52.820 --> 25:53.980
 It's fun to watch,

25:53.980 --> 25:55.620
 but it would be an incredibly serious event

25:55.620 --> 25:57.860
 to be implying these weapons.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.060
 Yeah, and we'll talk about war in general,

26:01.060 --> 26:04.740
 because yeah, the movie's kind of celebrating

26:04.740 --> 26:07.060
 the human side of things

26:07.060 --> 26:08.940
 and also the incredible technology involved,

26:08.940 --> 26:12.460
 but there's also the cost of war

26:12.460 --> 26:13.900
 and the seriousness of war

26:13.900 --> 26:16.100
 and the suffering involved with war,

26:16.100 --> 26:17.140
 not just in the fighting,

26:17.140 --> 26:18.660
 but in the death of civilians

26:18.660 --> 26:20.140
 and all those kinds of things.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.180
 Well, you were a Navy pilot.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.820
 Let's talk a little bit more seriously about this,

26:26.820 --> 26:28.820
 and you were twice deployed in the Middle East

26:28.820 --> 26:32.020
 flying the FAA 18F Super Hornet.

26:32.020 --> 26:34.260
 Can you briefly tell the story of your career

26:34.260 --> 26:35.420
 as a Navy pilot?

26:35.420 --> 26:36.260
 Sure.

26:36.260 --> 26:39.980
 So I joined the Navy in 2009, right after college.

26:39.980 --> 26:42.940
 I went to, essentially, officer boot camp,

26:42.940 --> 26:44.260
 officer of Canada school.

26:44.260 --> 26:47.260
 I applied as a pilot, and I got in as a pilot.

26:47.260 --> 26:48.900
 That was the advantage of going that way

26:48.900 --> 26:50.660
 is that I could essentially choose what I wanted,

26:50.660 --> 26:51.780
 and if I got in, great.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.500
 If not, I didn't get stuck doing something else.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.980
 So you knew you wanted to be a pilot.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.340
 I did.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.180
 I joined.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.300
 I went through my initial training.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.140
 I went through primary flight training

27:01.140 --> 27:02.900
 that all aviators go through,

27:02.900 --> 27:04.460
 and I did well enough that,

27:06.020 --> 27:07.380
 one of the first lessons they teach you in the Navy

27:07.380 --> 27:10.260
 is that you can have a great career in the Navy

27:10.260 --> 27:13.020
 and you can see the world and do what you want,

27:13.020 --> 27:13.860
 but at the end of the day,

27:13.860 --> 27:15.580
 it's all about the needs of the Navy and what they need,

27:15.580 --> 27:18.100
 so they may not have the platform you like

27:18.100 --> 27:19.780
 or you may not necessarily get to choose

27:19.780 --> 27:21.620
 your own adventure here,

27:21.620 --> 27:24.860
 but I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot

27:24.860 --> 27:26.860
 in my class, and I was lucky enough,

27:26.860 --> 27:28.420
 fortunate enough to get it, so.

27:28.420 --> 27:29.580
 It was a jet slot.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.140
 So yeah, what that means is that I was assigned

27:32.140 --> 27:33.700
 actually a tail hook at that point,

27:33.700 --> 27:36.380
 which meant I would go train to fly aircraft

27:36.380 --> 27:38.460
 that land on aircraft carriers,

27:38.460 --> 27:40.780
 and there's essentially three aircraft

27:40.780 --> 27:42.420
 that do that at the time.

27:42.420 --> 27:47.420
 There's the F18 and the E2 and the C2.

27:48.660 --> 27:50.940
 C2 is kind of like the mail truck for the boat.

27:50.940 --> 27:54.060
 E2 is one of the big radar dish on top,

27:54.060 --> 27:55.580
 and then there's all the F18s.

27:55.580 --> 27:59.380
 So E2 is comms, is C2 mail truck?

27:59.380 --> 28:00.620
 Yeah.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.420
 C2 basically brings all the mail.

28:02.420 --> 28:04.380
 They pack on the shore,

28:04.380 --> 28:05.620
 and they're the ones that bring supplies

28:05.620 --> 28:07.340
 to the ship via air and people.

28:07.340 --> 28:08.260
 Sorry if I missed it.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.900
 Is it a plane or is it a helicopter?

28:09.900 --> 28:10.740
 It's a plane.

28:10.740 --> 28:11.820
 Okay.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.780
 All right, and the F18 is a fighter jet.

28:13.780 --> 28:14.620
 Correct.

28:14.620 --> 28:15.440
 Okay.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.280
 So I selected tail hook,

28:16.280 --> 28:18.380
 which meant I could get one of those other ones,

28:18.380 --> 28:20.060
 but 80% of them or so are jets,

28:20.060 --> 28:21.820
 so I was in a good spot at that point,

28:21.820 --> 28:23.460
 and that's when I went to Merde, Mississippi

28:23.460 --> 28:28.100
 to fly my first jet, which was the T45 Gauss Hawk.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.180
 Cool, so what kind of plane is that?

28:30.180 --> 28:33.160
 Is that what you were doing your training on?

28:33.160 --> 28:34.800
 That's the jet aircraft you get in

28:34.800 --> 28:37.520
 before you actually go to the F18.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.540
 It is a carrier capable,

28:39.540 --> 28:42.560
 so go to the boat for the first time in it during the day,

28:42.560 --> 28:45.640
 drop fake bombs, do dog fighting,

28:45.640 --> 28:49.720
 low levels, formation flying, day and night.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.560
 Oh, it's a pretty plane.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.520
 Yeah, and it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.

28:54.520 --> 28:58.400
 Okay, so it's usually not used for fighting,

28:58.400 --> 28:59.440
 it's used for training?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.000
 It's used for training how to fight.

29:01.000 --> 29:01.900
 Got it.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.120
 So what was that like?

29:03.120 --> 29:04.880
 Was that the first time you were sort of

29:04.880 --> 29:06.240
 really getting into it?

29:06.240 --> 29:07.320
 Yeah, that was really interesting,

29:07.320 --> 29:10.360
 because before that it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.600
 Going from that to the T45 is one of the biggest jumps

29:13.600 --> 29:17.560
 in power and like Navy machine operation.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.120
 How much horsepower does the T45 have approximately?

29:21.120 --> 29:23.040
 Maybe like 15,000 or so.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.320
 So it's a huge jump from 600 you said horsepower about?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.520
 Cool, so it's a big, big leap.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.360
 But it's a jet, so it performs differently, it's faster.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.280
 What that means, not just because it's faster,

29:34.280 --> 29:35.420
 your whole mind needs to be faster.

29:35.420 --> 29:37.320
 Everything happens faster in the air now, right?

29:37.320 --> 29:40.040
 Those comms happen faster,

29:40.040 --> 29:41.360
 your landing gear has to come up faster,

29:41.360 --> 29:42.920
 everything just happens faster in a jet.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.240
 So it's a big jump.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.460
 And I'll never forget going on my first flight

29:47.460 --> 29:52.360
 in that aircraft, it was a formation flight for someone else.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.040
 And I was just in the back watching

29:54.040 --> 29:55.700
 and there was an instructor in the flight.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.840
 And so what that means is the instructor

29:57.840 --> 29:59.640
 is in a single aircraft and then there's three

29:59.640 --> 30:01.200
 or four other aircraft and they're learning

30:01.200 --> 30:04.520
 how to do joins and they're learning how to fly in formation.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.640
 And as a new student in the back, it's amazing, right?

30:06.640 --> 30:08.720
 Cause you know, photo op time and all this,

30:08.720 --> 30:10.680
 like I'm seeing aircraft up close for the first time,

30:10.680 --> 30:14.660
 it's awesome, and on the way back,

30:15.720 --> 30:19.240
 we couldn't get our landing gear down, ironically.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.160
 So to make a long story short,

30:22.160 --> 30:24.000
 cause it's overall not that exciting,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
 we couldn't get the gear down,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.960
 we actually went to go do a control ejection

30:27.960 --> 30:29.920
 to the target area where that is,

30:29.920 --> 30:32.840
 about 15, 20 miles to the north of the base.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.540
 Wait, did you just say that's not that exciting?

30:35.540 --> 30:36.460
 Well.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.720
 Cause that to me is pretty exciting.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.040
 That, I mean, how, first of all,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.440
 I mean, that must be terrifying,

30:43.440 --> 30:45.440
 like early on in your careers,

30:45.440 --> 30:49.520
 I haven't seen those things that,

30:49.520 --> 30:52.120
 yeah, like how often does that kind of thing happen?

30:53.040 --> 30:54.520
 Decent, more than you would think.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.600
 More than you would think.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.120
 There was no significant panic?

30:57.120 --> 30:58.680
 This is like, this understood?

30:58.680 --> 31:00.600
 This is what has to be done in this case?

31:00.600 --> 31:02.440
 I think I was probably just too dumb

31:02.440 --> 31:03.920
 to realize the significance of it,

31:03.920 --> 31:05.440
 cause as a new student, you know,

31:05.440 --> 31:07.080
 not really appreciating, you know,

31:07.080 --> 31:09.200
 just what is ahead of me if we are ejecting.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.100
 But at the time it was more, it was just like rote, right?

31:12.100 --> 31:12.940
 Cause I was back there,

31:12.940 --> 31:15.560
 and then I went from a observer mode to a,

31:15.560 --> 31:17.520
 I'm gonna provide you the help that I can provide you

31:17.520 --> 31:19.640
 as a member of this crew, you know, mode.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.800
 And so it was less about, you know,

31:21.800 --> 31:25.500
 on this 20 mile trip and thinking about my,

31:25.500 --> 31:26.860
 how vulnerable I am, you know,

31:26.860 --> 31:27.840
 we're going through checklists,

31:27.840 --> 31:29.480
 we're talking to people, we're getting ready.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.160
 So no, it wasn't fearful.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.740
 And the whole time we were doing one of these

31:33.740 --> 31:36.100
 to try to get the gear down.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.320
 So we're unloading the jet and then loading it back

31:38.320 --> 31:41.060
 to try to get the gear out with the stick.

31:41.060 --> 31:46.000
 And it came down, it came down halfway there,

31:46.000 --> 31:47.360
 just on its own.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.320
 So it came back around and we did like a safety trap

31:50.320 --> 31:52.240
 in case there was a problem with the gear.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.000
 And that was my first flight, you know,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.040
 a little bit of serendipity,

31:56.040 --> 31:57.800
 but I'm gonna fast forward a bit.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.340
 And I went back to that squad as an instructor

32:00.340 --> 32:02.320
 about five or six years later,

32:02.320 --> 32:04.760
 and I was an aviation safety officer at this point,

32:04.760 --> 32:08.360
 which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps.

32:08.360 --> 32:13.200
 And a student went in and he went in the back seat

32:13.200 --> 32:17.000
 of a form flight, just like the one I went on.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.200
 And he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.920
 Exact same type of flight.

32:21.920 --> 32:25.040
 They went out and they had a runaway trim scenario.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.320
 And it caused the aircraft essentially

32:26.320 --> 32:28.640
 just inverted itself almost 180 degrees

32:29.520 --> 32:31.520
 at about 600 feet over the ground.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.700
 And they punched out just slightly outside

32:33.700 --> 32:36.320
 the ejection window at about 300, 400 feet or so,

32:36.320 --> 32:38.140
 but they were completely fine.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.280
 So, you know, and then about two months later,

32:42.280 --> 32:43.320
 we had another ejection.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.260
 About three months after that, we had another ejection.

32:45.260 --> 32:49.440
 So unfortunately, you know, it can be more common

32:49.440 --> 32:50.280
 than people think.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.440
 What does it feel like to get ejected?

32:52.440 --> 32:53.720
 Thankfully, I don't know.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.200
 I can describe it to you.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.000
 I can tell you what it's like from what I've heard,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.560
 but I truly think it's one of those things

32:59.560 --> 33:02.480
 that you just don't understand until it happens.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.280
 It's like instantaneous about 250 Gs,

33:05.280 --> 33:07.800
 which is only possible because of inertia in our blood.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.160
 All right, so you can actually get like 250, 300 Gs

33:10.160 --> 33:11.520
 for like a few milliseconds,

33:11.520 --> 33:14.200
 and then it backs off to like 40 or 50 Gs

33:14.200 --> 33:16.480
 to get you away from the vehicle itself.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.320
 And so, you know, you may lose consciousness.

33:20.320 --> 33:24.180
 If you do, you know, who knows where you wake up.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.040
 You know, you could be in a tree,

33:25.040 --> 33:28.160
 you could still be falling, you could be in the water, so.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.880
 The physics of that is fascinating, how to eject safely.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.920
 Do you know the story about how that was tested at all?

33:34.920 --> 33:35.960
 I don't know the full story,

33:35.960 --> 33:36.800
 but there was an airport.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.040
 I'm guessing nobody knows the full story.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.480
 It's probably a lot of shady stuff going on.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.400
 But anyway, you mean like in the early, early days, or?

33:44.400 --> 33:46.800
 They took a flight dock up to a rocket sled

33:46.800 --> 33:49.160
 and just see how much their body could take it.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.520
 And he turned a lot of his body in the mush

33:51.520 --> 33:53.560
 in the process of getting that science done,

33:53.560 --> 33:55.740
 but he saved a lot of lives.

33:55.740 --> 33:58.940
 People used to be tougher back in the day.

33:58.940 --> 34:02.640
 Yeah, that's how science used to be done.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.840
 So how did your training continue?

34:05.840 --> 34:08.720
 So how, take me farther through your career

34:10.240 --> 34:13.340
 as you worked towards graduating towards the F18s.

34:13.340 --> 34:16.840
 So in VT9, where I was a student, there's two phases.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.560
 There's an intermediate and an advanced.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.180
 Intermediate is getting very comfortable with the aircraft.

34:22.180 --> 34:23.880
 And at that point, you truly hear,

34:23.880 --> 34:25.400
 all right, you're going jets now,

34:25.400 --> 34:28.000
 or you're gonna go one of the other aircraft

34:28.000 --> 34:30.200
 that land on the aircraft carrier.

34:30.200 --> 34:33.000
 I was told I was going jets at that point.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.480
 And then we go into same squadron,

34:35.480 --> 34:36.880
 same aircraft, same instructors,

34:36.880 --> 34:37.940
 but it's called advanced now.

34:37.940 --> 34:41.280
 And now we're learning how to dog fight for the first time.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.320
 We're doing what we call tactical formation,

34:44.320 --> 34:46.900
 which is just like aggressive position keeping.

34:48.160 --> 34:52.260
 We are doing dog fighting in low levels

34:52.260 --> 34:53.320
 and all sorts of great stuff.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.040
 So it's really that first introduction

34:55.040 --> 34:56.280
 to that tactical environment

34:56.280 --> 34:58.400
 and really putting Gs on the jet

34:58.400 --> 35:00.240
 and on your body and maneuvering.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.100
 Is there like tactical formation,

35:02.100 --> 35:05.040
 is collaborating with other fighter jets a part of that?

35:05.040 --> 35:05.880
 It is.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.380
 So flying in a, that's what you mean by formation.

35:08.380 --> 35:11.040
 So literally having an awareness.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.560
 Is this done for you or are you as a human

35:13.560 --> 35:18.220
 supposed to understand like where you are in the formation,

35:18.220 --> 35:20.520
 how to maintain formation, all that kind of stuff?

35:20.520 --> 35:21.360
 Yeah, there's a.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.060
 Is it done autonomously or manually?

35:23.060 --> 35:24.500
 There's a great autonomy point

35:24.500 --> 35:25.560
 on the end of this I've thought about.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.320
 So, but what we do, it's all manual.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.220
 And so I'm looking at his wing

35:29.220 --> 35:33.100
 and I'm looking at different visual checkpoints

35:33.100 --> 35:34.640
 that form like a triangle, right?

35:34.640 --> 35:36.320
 Like an equal out triangle essentially.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.680
 And then as that triangle is no longer equal,

35:39.680 --> 35:42.400
 I can tell my relative position against that aircraft.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.400
 That's really cool.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.000
 And so that's what I'm staring at first,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.840
 sometimes hours on end, several feet away,

35:47.840 --> 35:50.600
 doing one of these if I'm in the weather, that's all it is.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.920
 So you get, it's almost like, is it peripheral vision

35:52.920 --> 35:53.740
 or is it your?

35:53.740 --> 35:54.840
 No, we're staring directly at it.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.880
 The peripheral is going on my, on my.

35:57.880 --> 35:58.720
 That's interesting.

35:58.720 --> 35:59.560
 Stuff, right?

35:59.560 --> 36:01.160
 My sensors and all my instruments.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.240
 And so he is my gyroscope at that point, right?

36:04.240 --> 36:06.640
 While you're flying, not looking straight.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.600
 Correct, I'm flying like this for hours.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.680
 It can hurt your neck.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.280
 We don't like doing this as much.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.000
 And I don't think it's just me, right?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.800
 It's a weird thing where when you're like this,

36:14.800 --> 36:18.460
 it's actually harder to fly formation slightly than here

36:18.460 --> 36:21.680
 because being in line of your hand movements

36:21.680 --> 36:24.640
 and of the aircraft somehow has an effect

36:24.640 --> 36:27.000
 on our ability to be more precise and comfortable.

36:27.000 --> 36:27.840
 It's strange.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.400
 But so there's a symmetry to the formation usually.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.440
 So one of the people on the other side

36:34.440 --> 36:37.000
 really don't like being on that side.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.440
 Is it, does it, who gets like the short straw?

36:40.440 --> 36:43.160
 How do you decide which side of the formation you are?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.000
 It's a good question too

36:44.000 --> 36:46.240
 because there's kind of rank in some sense.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.400
 So if it's a four person formation, right?

36:49.400 --> 36:51.160
 You have the vision lead who's qualified

36:51.160 --> 36:53.160
 to lead a whole division, but maybe the other ones aren't.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.560
 And he has a dash two and that's his wingman essentially.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.600
 And then in a division, there's two other aircraft.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
 And then you have another senior flight leader.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.320
 That's the dash three position.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.080
 And then you have dash four, the last one.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.860
 And if you were all lined up on one side,

37:06.860 --> 37:08.860
 like fingertip, one, two, three, four,

37:08.860 --> 37:10.840
 that dash four guy is gonna be at the end of that whip.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.480
 So if you're flying formation,

37:12.480 --> 37:15.400
 each one's making movements relative to the lead.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.200
 Dash four is kind of at the end of that error.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.120
 And so his movements are kind of like a whip.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.320
 It's very difficult to fly in that position in close.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.160
 Can you elaborate?

37:24.160 --> 37:25.880
 Is it because of the error, the aerodynamics?

37:25.880 --> 37:26.840
 So what's a whip?

37:26.840 --> 37:28.960
 If this is a flight lead and this is dash two,

37:28.960 --> 37:30.840
 flight lead is rock steady and just doing his thing.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.800
 And flight two is gonna be working that triangle

37:32.800 --> 37:33.640
 moving a little bit, right?

37:33.640 --> 37:35.840
 And he has this small error bubble

37:35.840 --> 37:37.400
 that he's doing his best to stay.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.240
 And then, but dash three is flying off dash two.

37:39.240 --> 37:42.880
 And so his error bubble is dash twos plus his own.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.720
 And dash four.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.760
 So it gets more and more stressful

37:44.760 --> 37:46.840
 as you get farther out.

37:46.840 --> 37:50.060
 Okay, what's the experience of that staring

37:50.060 --> 37:54.840
 for long periods of time and trying to maintain formation?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.320
 How stressful is that?

37:56.320 --> 38:01.320
 Because we're doing that when we drive, staying in lane.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.080
 And that becomes, after you get pretty good at it,

38:05.080 --> 38:07.780
 it becomes somewhat, it's still stressful.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.760
 Which actually is surprisingly stressful.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.160
 When you look at lane keeping systems,

38:13.160 --> 38:15.280
 they actually relieve that stress somehow.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.520
 And it actually creates a much more pleasant experience

38:18.520 --> 38:20.880
 while you're still able to maintain situational awareness

38:20.880 --> 38:24.240
 and stay awake, which is really interesting.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.320
 I don't think people realize how stressful it is

38:26.320 --> 38:29.040
 to lane keep when they drive.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.080
 So this is even more stressful.

38:31.080 --> 38:34.880
 So are you, do you think about that?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.380
 Or is this, yeah, I guess how stressful is it

38:37.380 --> 38:39.260
 from a psychology perspective?

38:39.260 --> 38:40.360
 It's very stressful.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.640
 So I taught students how to do this as well.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.120
 And so at our feet, we have two rudders.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.920
 And if I'm flying off a flight lead over here,

38:48.920 --> 38:51.120
 what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying,

38:51.120 --> 38:53.480
 or like if I'm the instructor and the student's flying,

38:53.480 --> 38:55.160
 I'll start to notice that he's having a harder

38:55.160 --> 38:57.000
 and harder time keeping position.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.880
 What I'll notice typically is he's locked out his leg.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.800
 They'll lock out the leg that's closest

39:01.800 --> 39:03.800
 to the aircraft they're flying against

39:03.800 --> 39:06.080
 and push on the rudder subconsciously,

39:06.080 --> 39:07.240
 because their whole body's trying to get away

39:07.240 --> 39:08.760
 from the aircraft because they're so uncomfortable

39:08.760 --> 39:09.960
 being close to it.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.280
 And so I'll tell them, I can fix their form

39:12.280 --> 39:13.180
 with just a couple of words.

39:13.180 --> 39:14.920
 I'll say, wiggle your toes.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.520
 And they'll wiggle their toes and they'll realize,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.120
 and they'll loosen all the muscles in their legs

39:18.120 --> 39:19.800
 because they realize they've been locked up

39:19.800 --> 39:22.400
 and their formation flying will get a lot better.

39:22.400 --> 39:25.920
 And so, there's a lot of stress associated with that.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.920
 There's some interesting psychological or visual issues

39:32.220 --> 39:35.280
 such as vertigo as you're flying.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.820
 So if you're flying with him

39:36.820 --> 39:38.740
 and then you fly right into a cloud, right?

39:38.740 --> 39:39.740
 That's when it's very stressful

39:39.740 --> 39:41.040
 because you have to be very close

39:41.040 --> 39:42.080
 in order to maintain visual

39:42.080 --> 39:44.420
 and you might be on a thunderstorm, right?

39:44.420 --> 39:45.640
 And so you have to be very tight.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.480
 You might start raining and then he's turning,

39:48.480 --> 39:50.480
 but you might not even know that.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.400
 You might not even be able to see that turn.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.160
 And so all of a sudden you might look

39:54.160 --> 39:56.120
 while you're in a turn thinking you were straight and level

39:56.120 --> 39:58.800
 and you look just maybe back at your instruments very quick

39:58.800 --> 40:01.040
 and you realize you're like in a 30 degree turn

40:01.040 --> 40:03.940
 and your whole concept of where you are in the world

40:03.940 --> 40:05.320
 starts getting very confused.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.780
 And you immediately get this sense of, it's weird.

40:09.780 --> 40:12.000
 Like I look at the HUD and it feels,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.880
 all my senses are telling me it's spinning, but it's not.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.800
 And so I have to trust my instruments

40:15.800 --> 40:17.040
 even though it feels like it's spinning.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.720
 And the same thing can happen

40:18.720 --> 40:20.400
 when you're flying formation off of someone

40:20.400 --> 40:25.000
 and it can be very dangerous and disorientating.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.960
 But the point is to try to regain awareness

40:28.960 --> 40:30.200
 by trusting the instruments,

40:30.200 --> 40:33.800
 like distrust all your human senses

40:33.800 --> 40:35.000
 and just use the instruments

40:35.000 --> 40:37.520
 to rebuild situational awareness.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.000
 Not in this particular case

40:39.000 --> 40:41.600
 because our situational awareness is based,

40:41.600 --> 40:43.280
 it's predicated off of our flight lead.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.480
 So in a sense, I'm just trusting his movements.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.480
 And so he's my gyroscope, but you're absolutely right.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.720
 And if I was by myself, I would trust my instruments,

40:49.720 --> 40:52.120
 but I can't just stop flying form and trust my instruments

40:52.120 --> 40:52.960
 because now I'm gonna hit him.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.400
 Oh yeah, you have to pay attention to him.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.040
 So he's my reference.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.620
 So the instruments are not helping you significantly

40:58.620 --> 41:00.080
 with his positioning.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.520
 Not, it's all completely manual.

41:02.520 --> 41:06.120
 So is there a future where some of that is autonomous?

41:06.120 --> 41:10.200
 Yeah, and I've thought about automating that flight regime.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.960
 But when I started thinking about it,

41:11.960 --> 41:16.400
 I realized that all the formation keeping that we do

41:16.400 --> 41:20.560
 is designed to enhance the aviators

41:22.120 --> 41:23.760
 ability to maintain sight, right?

41:23.760 --> 41:26.320
 So we fly very tight formation so that we can go in weather

41:26.320 --> 41:30.440
 and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.120
 We fly in one particular position

41:33.120 --> 41:36.920
 so that all of the flight crew can look down the line

41:36.920 --> 41:38.120
 and see the flight lead.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.680
 So everything has based,

41:39.680 --> 41:43.000
 everything has to do with the two air crew

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
 visually maintaining sight of each other

41:45.000 --> 41:47.020
 and defending each other, right?

41:47.020 --> 41:49.640
 In a combat spread, I might be looking,

41:49.640 --> 41:52.060
 I may be three miles away from him flying formation

41:52.060 --> 41:53.760
 directly beam and looking around

41:53.760 --> 41:55.180
 to make sure nothing's there.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.360
 So as I'm looking into automating this process,

41:57.360 --> 42:01.840
 I thought, well, sure it's easy to get a bunch of aircraft

42:01.840 --> 42:03.560
 to fly in formation off each other, right?

42:03.560 --> 42:05.480
 It's trivial, but why?

42:05.480 --> 42:06.720
 What is the best formation?

42:06.720 --> 42:07.640
 Why are they doing that?

42:07.640 --> 42:10.160
 And that opened up a much more interesting regime

42:10.160 --> 42:12.520
 of operations and flight mechanics.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.520
 And that's when we get back to that kind of stochastic

42:14.520 --> 42:16.880
 mindset where we can bring in aircraft close

42:16.880 --> 42:18.400
 to do some type of normal flying

42:18.400 --> 42:21.140
 or reduce congestion around airports.

42:21.140 --> 42:23.280
 But when we consider flying or formation

42:23.280 --> 42:24.560
 in a tactical environment,

42:24.560 --> 42:25.840
 we can be much more effective

42:25.840 --> 42:27.860
 with nontraditional formation keeping

42:27.860 --> 42:30.280
 or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.700
 So autonomy used for formation keeping,

42:32.700 --> 42:36.520
 not for convenience, but for the introduction of randomness.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.000
 Like to a real time mission planner, yeah.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.480
 And then that's where you also have some human modification.

42:42.480 --> 42:47.240
 So it's like unmanned teaming enters that picture.

42:47.240 --> 42:51.400
 So you use some of the human intuition

42:51.400 --> 42:53.840
 and adjustment of this formation.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.080
 The formation itself has some uncertainty.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.880
 I mean, it's such an interesting dance.

42:57.880 --> 43:02.880
 I think that is the most fascinating application

43:02.960 --> 43:04.080
 of artificial intelligence

43:04.080 --> 43:06.960
 is when it's human AI collaboration,

43:06.960 --> 43:09.280
 that semi autonomous dance

43:09.280 --> 43:12.360
 that you see in these semi autonomous vehicle systems

43:12.360 --> 43:14.400
 in terms of cars being driving,

43:14.400 --> 43:18.040
 but also in the safety critical situation

43:18.040 --> 43:20.640
 of a airplane, of a fighter jet,

43:20.640 --> 43:22.960
 especially when you're flying fast.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.040
 I mean, in a split second,

43:25.040 --> 43:26.600
 you have to make all these kinds of decisions

43:26.600 --> 43:29.760
 and it feels like an AI system can do

43:29.760 --> 43:31.200
 as much harm as it can help.

43:31.200 --> 43:35.600
 And so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.520
 One of the challenges too,

43:36.520 --> 43:39.040
 isn't just the algorithms of the autonomy itself,

43:39.040 --> 43:41.680
 but how it senses the environment.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.300
 That of course is gonna be what all these decisions

43:44.300 --> 43:45.140
 are based off of.

43:45.140 --> 43:48.040
 And that's a challenge in this type of environment.

43:48.040 --> 43:48.960
 Well, I gotta ask.

43:48.960 --> 43:53.960
 So F18, what's it like to fly a fighter jet as best?

43:53.960 --> 43:58.660
 I mean, what to you is beautiful, powerful?

43:58.660 --> 44:02.080
 What do you love about the experience of flying?

44:02.080 --> 44:04.720
 For me, and I think I'm an outlier a bit.

44:04.720 --> 44:08.520
 It wasn't necessarily the flying itself, right?

44:08.520 --> 44:12.160
 It wasn't necessarily the soaring over the clouds

44:12.160 --> 44:16.200
 and looking down at the earth from upside down.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.960
 I came to love that,

44:17.960 --> 44:19.920
 but it wasn't necessarily the passion that drove me there.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.920
 I just had no exposure to that.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.820
 The only exposure I had was reading

44:24.820 --> 44:28.640
 and going in the woods and science fiction and all that.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.960
 And so, what seemed to kind of drive me towards that

44:31.960 --> 44:35.160
 was just a desire to really be operating as close

44:35.160 --> 44:38.760
 to what I thought was the edge of technology or science.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.320
 And that's the path that I chose

44:40.320 --> 44:41.900
 to try to get close to that.

44:41.900 --> 44:44.040
 I thought that being in a fighter jet

44:44.880 --> 44:49.880
 and all the tools and the technology and the knowledge

44:50.160 --> 44:53.540
 and the challenges and the failures and victories

44:53.540 --> 44:56.000
 that would come with that just seemed like something

44:56.000 --> 44:59.120
 that I wanted to be a part of.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.720
 And it wasn't necessarily about the flying,

45:00.720 --> 45:01.960
 but it was about the challenge.

45:01.960 --> 45:06.320
 And like I said, as a person from a small town,

45:06.320 --> 45:09.200
 small high school, being able to get my hands

45:09.200 --> 45:12.160
 or even just near something of such technological

45:12.160 --> 45:15.520
 significance was kind of empowering for me.

45:15.520 --> 45:18.360
 And that's kind of what bore the love of flight from there.

45:18.360 --> 45:21.860
 Becoming, having some level of mastery in the aircraft,

45:21.860 --> 45:24.040
 it really feels like an extension of your body.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.480
 And once I got there, then kind of the love of flying

45:27.480 --> 45:28.880
 kind of followed.

45:28.880 --> 45:33.160
 So you sort of, one, is the man mastery over the machine.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.520
 And second is the machine is like the greatest thing

45:35.520 --> 45:38.180
 that humans have ever created arguably.

45:38.180 --> 45:41.940
 The things that Lockheed Martin and others have built.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.720
 I mean, the engineering in that.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.040
 However you feel about war, which is one of the sad things

45:50.040 --> 45:54.960
 about human civilization is war inspires

45:54.960 --> 45:59.440
 the engineering of tools that are incredible.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.440
 And it's like, maybe without war,

46:02.440 --> 46:04.640
 if we look at human history, we would not build

46:04.640 --> 46:06.660
 some of the incredible things we built.

46:06.660 --> 46:09.640
 So in order to win wars, to stop wars,

46:09.640 --> 46:12.320
 we build these incredible systems

46:12.320 --> 46:15.000
 that perhaps propagate war.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.400
 And that's another discussion I'll ask you about.

46:17.400 --> 46:21.880
 But this, to you, this is like, this is a chance

46:21.880 --> 46:24.960
 to experience the greatest engineering humans

46:24.960 --> 46:26.600
 have ever been able to do.

46:28.120 --> 46:31.120
 Like similar, I suppose, that astronauts feel like

46:31.120 --> 46:31.960
 when they're flying.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
 And I wanted to be an astronaut.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.840
 I wanted to take that route.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.080
 I was gonna apply to test pilot school.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.800
 It just didn't work out for me.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.360
 I ended up having a broken foot during my window.

46:42.360 --> 46:45.720
 But long story short, I ended up after my time

46:45.720 --> 46:47.640
 in my fleet squadron, and we can get back to the rest

46:47.640 --> 46:48.480
 of the timeline if you want,

46:48.480 --> 46:53.480
 but I went to be an instructor pilot instead, right?

46:54.120 --> 46:56.720
 And then, I was talking about this

46:56.720 --> 46:59.840
 with a squadron mate earlier today about how,

46:59.840 --> 47:01.900
 I certainly wouldn't be talking with Lex today

47:01.900 --> 47:04.000
 if I ended up going to test pilot school.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.620
 I never would have, I never would have had the,

47:09.900 --> 47:12.160
 I wouldn't, maybe recklessness, I don't know,

47:12.160 --> 47:14.280
 but the willingness to have a conversation

47:14.280 --> 47:19.080
 about UAP while I was, that led me to the decision

47:19.080 --> 47:20.680
 to get out once I went there.

47:20.680 --> 47:25.680
 And it kind of enabled me to talk about UAP more publicly.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.800
 And if I stayed in the Navy, then I don't think

47:28.800 --> 47:29.640
 that would have happened.

47:29.640 --> 47:33.240
 I wouldn't have been able to if I went that route.

47:33.240 --> 47:36.300
 Well, as a small tangent, do you hope to travel

47:36.300 --> 47:37.200
 to Mars one day?

47:37.200 --> 47:39.560
 Do you think you'll step foot on Mars one day?

47:40.520 --> 47:42.040
 If you asked me that five years ago,

47:42.040 --> 47:44.640
 I would have said, yes, I want to.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.440
 In fact, I would like to die on Mars.

47:48.400 --> 47:51.000
 Now, today, now I have some hesitations

47:51.000 --> 47:52.160
 and I have some hesitations

47:52.160 --> 47:54.880
 because I'm hopeful and optimistic.

47:54.880 --> 47:57.940
 And I think that, you know, I think that we are truly

47:57.940 --> 48:02.000
 like on the brink of a very wide technological revolution

48:02.000 --> 48:04.720
 that's going to kind of move us how we used to move

48:04.720 --> 48:09.260
 information and data in this last century.

48:09.260 --> 48:11.320
 We're going to be manipulating and managing matter

48:11.320 --> 48:12.160
 in that next century.

48:12.160 --> 48:15.700
 And so I think that, I think our reach as humans

48:15.700 --> 48:17.520
 are going to get a lot wider, a lot faster

48:17.520 --> 48:19.880
 than people may realize, or at least.

48:19.880 --> 48:22.680
 Wait, are you getting like super ambitious beyond Mars?

48:22.680 --> 48:23.620
 Is that what you're saying?

48:23.620 --> 48:24.840
 Well, I mean.

48:24.840 --> 48:27.480
 Like Mars seems kind of boring, I want to go beyond that.

48:27.480 --> 48:31.480
 Is that what, do you mean the reach of humanity

48:31.480 --> 48:32.860
 across all kinds of technologies?

48:32.860 --> 48:34.480
 Or do you mean literally across space?

48:34.480 --> 48:35.760
 Across space, you know?

48:35.760 --> 48:37.960
 So, you know, we're going to be, I think that

48:37.960 --> 48:40.240
 as artificial intelligence and machine learning

48:40.240 --> 48:42.840
 start broaching further into the topic of science,

48:42.840 --> 48:44.760
 the area of science, and we start working through

48:44.760 --> 48:47.240
 new physics, we start working through,

48:47.240 --> 48:50.320
 or I should say pass the Einsteinian frameworks

48:50.320 --> 48:53.100
 as we kind of get a better idea of what space time is

48:53.100 --> 48:56.940
 or isn't, we may have, we may find, you know,

48:56.940 --> 48:58.880
 answers that we didn't know that we were looking for.

48:58.880 --> 49:00.600
 And we may have more opportunity.

49:00.600 --> 49:03.020
 And I'm not saying this is something I'm, you know,

49:03.020 --> 49:06.680
 betting the farm on, of course, but maybe that's a road

49:06.680 --> 49:09.640
 I want to explore on Earth instead of on Mars.

49:09.640 --> 49:12.440
 Maybe there's technology that can be brought to bear

49:12.440 --> 49:15.400
 with new science and harder engineering that is a road

49:15.400 --> 49:18.300
 that doesn't go past Mars to get outside the solar system.

49:19.360 --> 49:22.360
 So there are different ways to explore the universe

49:22.360 --> 49:24.700
 than the traditional rocket systems.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.720
 If we can continue sort of your journey,

49:31.140 --> 49:35.440
 you said that you were attracted to the incredibly

49:35.440 --> 49:39.520
 advanced technologies of the F18s and just the

49:39.520 --> 49:40.720
 fighter jets in general.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.880
 Let me ask another question, which seems incredibly

49:45.880 --> 49:50.080
 difficult to do, which is landing on a carrier

49:50.080 --> 49:52.240
 or taking off from a carrier and landing on a carrier.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.520
 So what's that like?

49:54.520 --> 49:56.360
 What are the challenges of that?

49:56.360 --> 49:57.920
 Taking off's pretty easy.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.040
 It's procedurally somewhat complex where there's a lot

50:01.040 --> 50:03.240
 of moving parts, almost like a clock, you know.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.620
 You're almost in a pocket watch.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.920
 So then you're a part of the machinery.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.640
 And so long as you press the right buttons

50:08.640 --> 50:10.160
 and do the right things, you're gonna go shooting

50:10.160 --> 50:11.040
 off the front.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.600
 So there's like a checklist to follow and there's

50:12.600 --> 50:14.400
 several people involved in that checklist

50:14.400 --> 50:16.480
 and you just gotta follow the checklist correctly.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.640
 Essentially, yep.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.460
 Lots of ways to screw it up, but you'll know

50:19.460 --> 50:20.880
 how to screw it up.

50:20.880 --> 50:23.320
 But landing on the back of the boat is a whole

50:23.320 --> 50:24.920
 different animal.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.800
 There's a lot more variables.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.320
 There's essentially one or two people responsible

50:29.320 --> 50:31.640
 for the success of that.

50:31.640 --> 50:34.880
 The landing signal officer who actually represents

50:34.880 --> 50:38.420
 a team of specially trained aviators who are responsible

50:38.420 --> 50:40.680
 for helping that aviator land on the boat.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.240
 And the pilot himself.

50:44.240 --> 50:49.240
 And it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough

50:49.400 --> 50:50.320
 to be good at it.

50:50.320 --> 50:53.640
 So to fly quote unquote the perfect pass,

50:53.640 --> 50:55.520
 you essentially have to fly your head through a one foot

50:55.520 --> 50:57.040
 by one foot box.

50:57.040 --> 51:00.040
 That's essentially the target you're shooting for.

51:00.040 --> 51:02.640
 Plus or minus probably about five knots on airspeed,

51:02.640 --> 51:04.600
 although we don't really judge it by airspeed.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.480
 It's something called angle of attack.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.480
 But generally pretty tight parameters there.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.920
 And you can do everything perfect and still fail.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.800
 So when we go to touchdown, we immediately bring

51:13.800 --> 51:17.920
 the power up and we rotate as if we were doing,

51:17.920 --> 51:19.840
 as if we were bouncing off the deck.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.240
 And if we catch it, then we slow down.

51:23.240 --> 51:25.120
 And then someone tells us to bring the power back,

51:25.120 --> 51:27.420
 which we do, we don't do it on our own.

51:27.420 --> 51:29.320
 Cause it's such a violent experience.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.640
 Think you're trapped or not, or something breaks

51:32.640 --> 51:34.240
 and you bring your throttle back.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.680
 And that's a very serious thing.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.360
 It happened to best of us, I'll admit I've done it once.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.760
 When I first got to the squadron,

51:40.760 --> 51:42.680
 it's called ease guns land.

51:42.680 --> 51:45.640
 And so I came in the boat and I brought the power.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.040
 I cracked the power back a little bit

51:47.040 --> 51:49.820
 before I've been told to her that my aircraft

51:49.820 --> 51:51.480
 had finished settling in.

51:51.480 --> 51:52.840
 And that was a big faux pas, right?

51:52.840 --> 51:53.920
 So, especially as a new guy.

51:53.920 --> 51:57.480
 So it's a very serious business.

51:57.480 --> 51:58.440
 There's a lot of eyes on you

51:58.440 --> 52:00.100
 and there's a lot of ways to screw it up.

52:00.100 --> 52:03.380
 But the physical rush of like having a great pass

52:03.380 --> 52:07.320
 and then like the crash of into the boat and all that,

52:07.320 --> 52:09.120
 the physical sensation from it,

52:09.120 --> 52:10.680
 when everything's going great,

52:10.680 --> 52:12.620
 it's top of the world, it's a great feeling.

52:12.620 --> 52:13.560
 How much of it is feel?

52:13.560 --> 52:16.640
 How much of it is instruments?

52:16.640 --> 52:18.640
 How much is other people just doing the work for you,

52:18.640 --> 52:20.720
 catching you, as long as you do everything right?

52:20.720 --> 52:21.860
 There's a few systems we use.

52:21.860 --> 52:23.200
 One is called the BAL.

52:23.200 --> 52:26.060
 And the BAL is external to our aircraft.

52:26.060 --> 52:29.120
 And it's B A L L, BAL, like BAL, okay.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.480
 It's a iFloss landing system,

52:31.480 --> 52:33.440
 which stands for something very long convoluted.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.560
 But essentially it's a mirror with lights on it.

52:35.560 --> 52:40.560
 And you see the light at a different cell

52:40.560 --> 52:44.580
 based on your position relative to an ideal glide slope.

52:44.580 --> 52:46.240
 So if you're right on it, you're right in the middle.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.080
 And if you're below, you're low.

52:48.080 --> 52:51.240
 And as I add power and maneuver the aircraft,

52:51.240 --> 52:55.160
 that BAL, I see that BAL rise, I see that BAL low.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.100
 It's a lagging indicator though, right?

52:57.100 --> 53:00.200
 And your jet is a lagging engine too, right?

53:00.200 --> 53:01.400
 It takes time to spool up the engine.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.120
 So that adds to the complexity.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.620
 You have to think ahead a bit.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.040
 So you don't want to,

53:07.920 --> 53:10.480
 you can't just bring the power up and leave it there.

53:10.480 --> 53:13.040
 You have to bring the power up, touch it, bring it back.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.360
 And oh, by the way, your landing area is moving,

53:15.360 --> 53:17.920
 not just away from you, but also on an angle, right?

53:17.920 --> 53:19.000
 Cause we have an angled deck.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.500
 And so you're constantly doing one of these

53:21.500 --> 53:23.440
 to correct yourself as you go.

53:23.440 --> 53:24.400
 That seems so stressful.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.320
 And every time you do one of those,

53:26.320 --> 53:28.480
 maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank, right?

53:28.480 --> 53:30.240
 I'm losing lift, right?

53:30.240 --> 53:33.020
 And so I have to compensate with power each time I do that.

53:33.020 --> 53:33.860
 So I'm doing another one.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.960
 Cause you have to maintain the same level

53:36.960 --> 53:38.360
 you're always lowering.

53:38.360 --> 53:39.520
 It's a constant rate of descent

53:39.520 --> 53:41.920
 that's increasing from about 200 feet per minute

53:41.920 --> 53:43.120
 to about 650.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.760
 And every time you do this, that's messing with that.

53:45.760 --> 53:46.600
 Okay.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.440
 So you have to compensate.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.600
 And you're doing that manually.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.440
 Do that manually.

53:49.440 --> 53:50.260
 All right.

53:50.260 --> 53:52.960
 And then of course, as you come down that glide slope,

53:52.960 --> 53:54.320
 it becomes more and more narrow.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.840
 And you have to, of course,

53:55.840 --> 53:58.840
 modulate your inputs such that they're smaller and smaller

53:58.840 --> 54:00.000
 cause they have a bigger and bigger effect

54:00.000 --> 54:01.040
 as you get closer in.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.920
 And what happens too, when you get in close is that

54:04.920 --> 54:06.200
 right before you cross over,

54:06.200 --> 54:08.240
 if this is the boat right here, your table,

54:08.240 --> 54:10.040
 right before you kind of get your wings

54:10.040 --> 54:11.760
 over the boat itself,

54:11.760 --> 54:15.520
 this big wind from the main tower of the boat

54:15.520 --> 54:16.400
 is where it dips down.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.560
 So the wind actually goes down and it's called the burble.

54:18.560 --> 54:19.800
 And it'll actually pull the aircraft down,

54:19.800 --> 54:21.360
 increase your rate of descent.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.360
 So at that particular point,

54:22.360 --> 54:24.600
 you need to increase your speed.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.360
 You know, increase your power

54:26.360 --> 54:27.640
 and try to compensate against that.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.960
 And so that's kind of a third variable

54:28.960 --> 54:31.920
 that's trying to screw you up on your way down.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.080
 What's the most difficult conditions

54:34.080 --> 54:34.920
 in which you had to land

54:34.920 --> 54:36.720
 or you've seen somebody had to land?

54:36.720 --> 54:40.720
 Because I think you were also a signal officer as well.

54:40.720 --> 54:41.540
 I was, yeah.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.120
 I was the head landing signal officer for my squadron.

54:44.120 --> 54:46.960
 So you've probably seen some tough landings.

54:46.960 --> 54:47.800
 I have.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.720
 I've seen a ramp strike,

54:49.720 --> 54:52.480
 which is when a part of the aircraft hits

54:52.480 --> 54:54.880
 before the landing area,

54:54.880 --> 54:57.440
 which is basically the round out of the boat.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.560
 That is before the landing area.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.400
 So they basically struck the back of the boat coming in.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
 It was just their hook.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.700
 So it wasn't their craft.

55:04.800 --> 55:05.640
 And they were fine.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.200
 That one was kind of ugly.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.520
 But it like rips that part of the aircraft.

55:09.520 --> 55:10.360
 Absolutely.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.440
 And then you land on your bellies, that kind of thing.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.680
 In this particular case,

55:13.680 --> 55:15.600
 it hit and then it gave

55:15.600 --> 55:18.760
 and essentially dragged the hook on the surface after that.

55:18.760 --> 55:21.040
 And so he was able to grab a wire at that point.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.200
 When does that kind of thing happen?

55:22.200 --> 55:24.000
 Is it just a miscalculation by the pilot

55:24.000 --> 55:27.040
 or is it weather conditions?

55:27.040 --> 55:28.780
 I wouldn't even call it a miscalculation.

55:28.780 --> 55:30.400
 I mean, I'm going to put the blame on the pilot

55:30.400 --> 55:31.640
 because he's the only one in the cockpit.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.240
 But then the day he's reacting to the situations

55:34.240 --> 55:35.080
 he's dealing with.

55:35.080 --> 55:37.720
 And so it may be errors or he may be doing the best

55:37.720 --> 55:40.480
 with the conditions that he's been given.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.100
 On that particular one,

55:42.100 --> 55:43.480
 you just got too high rate of send.

55:43.480 --> 55:44.320
 It's very common.

55:44.320 --> 55:45.560
 And that's what you see it with new pilots.

55:45.560 --> 55:47.280
 You see it with older pilots, right?

55:47.280 --> 55:49.320
 New ones and complacent ones.

55:49.320 --> 55:52.480
 What you see is they'll try to make the ball go

55:52.480 --> 55:54.000
 right where they want it in close.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.120
 They think they can beat the game a little bit.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.360
 And they try to, and so we have sayings,

55:58.360 --> 56:01.480
 we teach pilots as a landing signal officer,

56:01.480 --> 56:04.040
 we tell them like, don't recenter the high ball in close.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.800
 It's one of the rules to live by.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.440
 And so when the ball's up high,

56:07.440 --> 56:09.260
 don't try to bring it back in close

56:09.260 --> 56:11.820
 to like the center point when you're in close.

56:11.820 --> 56:12.920
 Cause what you're doing is you bring the power off

56:12.920 --> 56:14.440
 and you're going to crash right down.

56:14.440 --> 56:15.680
 And that's what happens, right?

56:15.680 --> 56:18.000
 Cause you got the burble pulling you down.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.160
 You might be correcting, which is decreasing your lift.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.520
 And then you have that type of maneuvers.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.000
 How are you supposed to do all of this

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
 in harsh weather conditions?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.480
 And so that's the one I wanted to tell you about.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.440
 That's the hardest one.

56:29.440 --> 56:33.380
 And what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi lights on,

56:33.380 --> 56:34.880
 that's a really shitty day.

56:34.880 --> 56:37.920
 99 taxi lights on, what's that mean?

56:37.920 --> 56:39.880
 Everyone put your taxi lights on

56:39.880 --> 56:43.160
 because you're about to land on the boat.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.040
 And you don't see the boat?

56:44.040 --> 56:46.640
 Weather is so bad that the landing signal officer

56:46.640 --> 56:48.680
 on the boat can't see you either.

56:48.680 --> 56:49.640
 And you can't see the boat.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.520
 And you won't be able to see it when you touch down.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.080
 So we call that a zero, zero landing.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.920
 And you turn on the taxi lights so that the LSO

56:57.920 --> 57:00.240
 who has a radio in his hand that looks like a phone

57:00.240 --> 57:04.720
 from 1980 is talking directly to the pilot.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.960
 And he's looking at that little light in the rain

57:06.960 --> 57:09.240
 and he's telling them you're high, you're low,

57:09.240 --> 57:11.360
 power, things like that.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.240
 Come right, back to left.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.160
 And literally talking him down to land

57:15.160 --> 57:16.000
 on the boat right there.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.020
 And the pilot, usually it comes as a surprise

57:18.020 --> 57:18.860
 to the pilot, the landing,

57:18.860 --> 57:20.080
 because he's just listening to the voice,

57:20.080 --> 57:21.800
 can't see the ball, can't see the boat.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.400
 And all of a sudden you just hit the boat.

57:23.400 --> 57:24.840
 You crash, I mean you crash.

57:24.840 --> 57:27.920
 We're going about 1,600 feet per minute descent

57:27.920 --> 57:28.760
 at that point.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.960
 So you're going super fast.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.560
 So all of this is happening fast.

57:32.560 --> 57:37.560
 You don't know the moment it's gonna hit.

57:37.640 --> 57:40.040
 So you're just going into the darkness

57:40.040 --> 57:41.880
 and just waiting for it to hit.

57:41.880 --> 57:43.860
 Maybe not dark though, a lot of times it's white.

57:43.860 --> 57:44.700
 Into the light.

57:44.700 --> 57:46.680
 You're just going into the light.

57:46.680 --> 57:50.100
 And then there's a voice from an 80s phone.

57:50.100 --> 57:50.940
 I got it.

57:50.940 --> 57:52.080
 This is terrible.

57:53.920 --> 57:57.600
 But so you still have to,

57:57.600 --> 57:59.040
 so this kind of thing happens.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.320
 You still have to land.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.560
 Sometimes you just don't have a place to divert.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.220
 But in a sense we're trained for that

58:04.220 --> 58:06.240
 because we do the night landings as well.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.880
 And I think you'll find this interesting,

58:07.880 --> 58:10.260
 but I always found that the night landings

58:10.260 --> 58:12.640
 where in these particular cases,

58:12.640 --> 58:14.800
 you're usually lined up behind the boat,

58:14.800 --> 58:17.040
 maybe 10, 15 miles, whereas the other ones,

58:17.040 --> 58:18.960
 it's like a tight circle, the landing pattern.

58:18.960 --> 58:21.600
 And so we can potentially see the boat way out there

58:23.460 --> 58:25.160
 if the lights were on, which they're not.

58:25.160 --> 58:26.960
 But we can maybe see like the string of aircraft

58:26.960 --> 58:28.100
 in front of us.

58:28.100 --> 58:31.160
 But what's interesting is that it can take a while.

58:31.160 --> 58:32.360
 You might be 15 miles out

58:32.360 --> 58:36.040
 and your lights are turned down as dim as possible.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.800
 You have a cloud deck maybe at six or 7,000 feet

58:38.800 --> 58:40.960
 so that the starlight, there's no moon,

58:40.960 --> 58:42.600
 but let's say the starlight's blocked out

58:42.600 --> 58:45.240
 because just the starlight alone, no moon,

58:45.240 --> 58:47.120
 you can see the boat, you can see the water.

58:47.120 --> 58:50.520
 But when that goes away, it's like closing your eyes.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.040
 You can't tell anything.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.720
 It could be upside down.

58:53.720 --> 58:55.600
 It could be in any position.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.480
 And for me, it was almost a meditative process

58:58.480 --> 59:00.560
 that I had to snap myself back out of

59:00.560 --> 59:02.880
 when I was on like a long straightaway.

59:02.880 --> 59:05.080
 And then I would see the light pop up

59:05.080 --> 59:06.620
 in the sea of darkness.

59:06.620 --> 59:07.600
 No lights anywhere.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.120
 Can't even see the horizon.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.760
 And I just see a light out there.

59:10.760 --> 59:12.920
 My instruments were telling me, and they're turned down

59:12.920 --> 59:13.760
 as far as they can go, right?

59:13.760 --> 59:14.580
 So I can barely see them.

59:14.580 --> 59:16.120
 So my eyes can adjust.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.560
 And I'm just staring at this light in the distance.

59:18.560 --> 59:21.620
 And it's just very meditative and it's the hum behind you.

59:21.620 --> 59:25.180
 And then at like four miles, you know,

59:25.180 --> 59:26.780
 almost like, oh, the light is a little bit bigger.

59:26.780 --> 59:28.280
 And you almost kind of have to snap back to it

59:28.280 --> 59:30.160
 and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like

59:30.160 --> 59:32.240
 look around a little bit and engage my brain,

59:32.240 --> 59:35.120
 link it back to my body and like do this thing.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.760
 Because you're going to have to actually land.

59:36.760 --> 59:40.520
 Well, is there just, you said you don't necessarily feel

59:40.520 --> 59:42.120
 the romantic notion of the whole thing,

59:42.120 --> 59:45.800
 but is there some aspects of flying where you look up

59:45.800 --> 59:50.800
 and maybe you see the stars or yeah, that kind of thing

59:51.280 --> 59:53.080
 that you just like, holy crap,

59:53.080 --> 59:55.400
 how did humans accomplish all of this?

59:55.400 --> 59:58.320
 Like, am I actually flying right now?

59:58.320 --> 1:00:00.480
 I used to have those moments on the boat

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:01.920
 when I was catching planes land.

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:05.100
 I would, they would trap and it'd be nighttime.

1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:07.160
 And it's just all this chaos in the middle of the ocean

1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:07.980
 and nothing.

1:00:07.980 --> 1:00:09.320
 And I would have these moments where I'd be like,

1:00:09.320 --> 1:00:11.200
 how the hell did I end up here?

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:13.760
 You know, there's one moment in time next to an aircraft

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:16.400
 landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you know,

1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:17.880
 where did my life, you know,

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.120
 how did my life go to end up here?

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:20.520
 How interesting.

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.240
 But what I did start to enjoy was the night vision goggles

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.800
 and putting those on and looking up at the stars

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:29.800
 flying around, especially over the ocean.

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:30.640
 What do they look like?

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:33.320
 And there's just so many, there's just so many stars

1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:34.920
 that, you know, you normally can't see.

1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:36.600
 They're shooting stars all the time.

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:39.360
 Almost every flight you'd see them with the goggles on.

1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:42.120
 And so it was a great pleasure to take advantage

1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:44.520
 of the lack of light pollution in some cases,

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.440
 especially on deployment to go grab some goggles at night,

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:51.000
 go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.900
 and just kind of look around, you know.

1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:53.940
 Yeah, it's humbling.

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.200
 Quick break, bathroom break?

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:59.840
 Yeah, wouldn't mind a quick stretch of legs.

1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:00.960
 You got a few cool patches.

1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.880
 I do, so this is a VFA 11 Red Rippers patch.

1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:08.240
 Typically going actually on our arm.

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:12.760
 So this is actually what we call the Boar's Head or Arnold.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.640
 So this is actually the Boar's Head

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.080
 from the Gordon's Gin bottle.

1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:22.120
 In 1918, we were in London or the UK somewhere

1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:25.700
 and we apparently partied with the owner and founder

1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:27.920
 of Gordon's Gin and we had a great time

1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:29.840
 and there's a signed letter in our ready room

1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:32.160
 that says we can use the logo in perpetuity.

1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:33.000
 Oh, nice.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.400
 And yeah, so I'd like to give you that patch.

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.540
 I drank quite a bit of gourd, so this is good.

1:01:39.540 --> 1:01:43.760
 And I'd like to give you that coin from our squadron.

1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:46.880
 The Red Rippers, that's a badass name.

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:49.560
 Thank you, brother.

1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:50.380
 You're welcome.

1:01:50.380 --> 1:01:51.640
 So let's jump around a little bit,

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:56.600
 but let me ask you about this one set of experiences

1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:59.040
 that you had and people in your squadron had.

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:00.720
 So you and a few people in the squadron

1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:03.360
 either detected UFOs on your instruments

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:05.120
 or saw them directly.

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:07.960
 Tell me the full story of these UFO sightings

1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.720
 and to the smallest technical details,

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:12.460
 because I love those.

1:02:12.460 --> 1:02:13.800
 I'll do my best.

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:17.120
 So we returned from, and when I say we,

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:21.240
 I mean, not my squadron, but VFA 11, the Red Rippers.

1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:24.460
 I was a somewhat junior pilot at the time.

1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:27.540
 I joined them on deployment in 2012,

1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:29.400
 where they had been already out there

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:30.880
 for about six months or so,

1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:35.200
 operating in the vicinity of Afghanistan.

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.360
 I joined them and then we flew back

1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:39.080
 and still as a relatively new guy,

1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:40.640
 we came back and we entered

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.000
 what's considered a maintenance phase

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.440
 where we slow down the tactical flying a bit,

1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:48.340
 kind of recuperate, do some maintenance on the aircraft.

1:02:48.340 --> 1:02:53.340
 And our particular model of the F18, the lot number,

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:57.640
 was plumbed for the particular things

1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:59.480
 that were needed to upgrade the radar

1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:04.320
 from what's known as the ABG 73 to the ABG 79.

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.000
 And the ABG 73 is a mechanically scanned array radar.

1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:12.760
 It's a perfectly fine radar,

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:16.280
 but the AESA radar is kind of a magnitude jump

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:20.200
 in capability, kind of an analog digital kind of mindset.

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:23.120
 So it's a leap to digital.

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:26.760
 ABG 73, so I mean, are these things on a carrier?

1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:28.000
 Like what are we talking about here?

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.920
 How big is the radar?

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:32.760
 So this is actually the radars in the F18 itself.

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.000
 Okay, so when you say they were chosen,

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:40.000
 this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79, ABG 79.

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:42.040
 Less of a test and more of just,

1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:43.420
 hey, it's your turn to get the upgrade.

1:03:43.420 --> 1:03:46.080
 Like we're all going to these better radars.

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:49.480
 They were building ones off the line with the new radar,

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.560
 but we were this weird transitionary squadron

1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:52.720
 in the middle that transitioned

1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:55.080
 from the older ones to the new ones.

1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:57.280
 But it's not particularly rare to fly with different types

1:03:57.280 --> 1:03:59.280
 of radar because in the,

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:01.240
 and we call the fleet replacement squadron,

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.700
 essentially the training ground for the F18,

1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:06.120
 you have all sorts of F18s with different radar.

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:09.440
 So you are used to having multiple ones,

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:14.440
 but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded.

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.680
 And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.760
 on the radar that we were seeing the next day

1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.760
 with this new radar that weren't there with the old radar.

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.440
 And these were sometimes the same day.

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.000
 You might go on two flights.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.040
 The one in the morning might be with the older radar,

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:31.560
 the one in the evening with the new radar.

1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:34.560
 And you'd see the objects with the new radar.

1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:37.360
 And that's not overly surprising in some sense.

1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.120
 They are more sensitive.

1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.240
 Perhaps they're not filtering out everything

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:42.080
 they should be yet,

1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:45.520
 or perhaps there's some other type of error.

1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:47.880
 Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever.

1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:50.400
 It was relatively new and we were somewhat used

1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:52.320
 to there being software problems

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:53.760
 with these types of things occasionally,

1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:55.280
 just like anything else.

1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:58.960
 And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction.

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.400
 We're getting some false tracks, as we call them.

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:04.320
 What were you seeing?

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:08.520
 And so what we would see are representations of the objects.

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:09.680
 So this is off of our radar.

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:11.080
 We're not seeing a visual image here.

1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:13.440
 This is kind of like what's being displayed to us

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:15.120
 almost like in a gaming fashion, right?

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:16.440
 Like the icon, right?

1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:19.500
 So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there.

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:21.600
 And here's the parameters I can understand about it.

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:22.560
 So this is in the cockpit.

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:26.680
 There's a display that's showing some visualization

1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:27.920
 with the radars detecting.

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:29.240
 Correct.

1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:30.720
 And there's two different ways to do that.

1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:32.640
 The first one is like the actual data,

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:37.240
 like the radar where I am,

1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:39.820
 it's showing me the data kind of as if it's in front of me

1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:41.720
 and I'm selecting those contacts.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:42.560
 And there's another screen

1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:43.960
 called the situational awareness page.

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:45.940
 And that's kind of a God's eye view

1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:48.560
 that brings all that data into one spot.

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:51.840
 And so I'm gonna talk about this from the SA page,

1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:53.040
 from the situational awareness page

1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:54.320
 versus the individual radar ones,

1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:55.880
 because it's easier, but.

1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:57.400
 Can you, sorry to linger on that.

1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:01.040
 So the individual displays are like first person

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:04.280
 and then SA is,

1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:06.920
 when you say God's eye view, it's like from the top,

1:06:06.920 --> 1:06:09.020
 the integration of all that information

1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:11.720
 as if it's looking down onto the earth.

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:12.560
 Yes.

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:13.400
 Is that a good way to summarize it?

1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.200
 It is, but for the aviator, it's slightly different

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:17.520
 because those two radar displays I talked about

1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.200
 are at the bottom of that display

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:22.420
 is kind of representative of where I am.

1:06:22.420 --> 1:06:24.440
 And so I see what's in front of me.

1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:26.860
 Whereas the situational awareness page,

1:06:26.860 --> 1:06:29.300
 the aircraft is located in the center of that.

1:06:29.300 --> 1:06:33.200
 And then all around me, based off of the data link

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:35.560
 and wherever I'm getting information from,

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:37.760
 I can see that whole awareness page.

1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:38.840
 I can see all the situation.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:41.460
 So I'm gonna kind of talk about this

1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:43.520
 from the situational awareness page,

1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:46.360
 which is a top down view, just to kind of frame our minds

1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:47.960
 instead of jumping around.

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:49.200
 And so what we would see out there

1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:50.840
 is we'd see these indications

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:51.680
 that something would be there

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:53.560
 and they would have a track file.

1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:56.080
 That track file, that thing that represents the object

1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:57.280
 has a line coming out of it.

1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:58.420
 And that represents,

1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:00.420
 it's called the target aspect indicator.

1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:03.480
 So there's some tracking from the radar.

1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:05.360
 Correct, so it's showing you where the object's going.

1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:07.320
 This is all pretty cool that the radar can do all this.

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.480
 So radar locks in on different objects

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:11.800
 and it tracks them over time.

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:12.640
 Correct.

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:13.480
 That's coming from the radar.

1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:15.400
 That's like a built in feature.

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:16.240
 Okay, cool.

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:17.400
 So out there we're seeing it.

1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:18.920
 We don't have to necessarily pull things

1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:22.120
 into our tracker in some sense, right?

1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:22.960
 It's all out there

1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:24.840
 and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff

1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:27.520
 or to kind of focus in on it more so.

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:30.000
 But the information should all be out there.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.080
 And so we'd see that that target aspect indicator,

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:34.760
 that line on a typical aircraft,

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:35.720
 it would kind of look like this.

1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:37.000
 It would be coming out and it would go steady

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.800
 and if they turned, it would be like boop, boop, boop,

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:41.080
 and you see them turn, right?

1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:42.160
 It's not magic.

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:44.280
 But this object, the target aspect

1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:46.600
 would kind of be like all over the place,

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.480
 like kind of randomly in the 360 degrees

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:52.760
 from that top down view, that line would be in any place.

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:56.600
 So kind of, is it unable to determine the target aspect?

1:07:56.600 --> 1:07:58.160
 Is it stationary?

1:07:58.160 --> 1:07:59.240
 And that's just how it puts it out

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:00.280
 and it's not used to seeing it.

1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:02.480
 So I'm not saying that's necessarily super weird,

1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:04.520
 but it was different than what we were used to seeing

1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:06.440
 because we weren't used to seeing stationary objects

1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:07.440
 out there very much.

1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:09.720
 And what was also interesting is that

1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:13.400
 these weren't just stationary on a zero wind day, right?

1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:17.080
 These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet,

1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:21.160
 500 feet with the wind blowing, you know?

1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:23.760
 And so much like the sea, when we're up there fighting,

1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:24.600
 it affects everything.

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:27.720
 We consider the wind when we're shooting missiles,

1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:29.600
 when we're flying or fuel considerations,

1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:31.600
 it's like operating in that volume of air,

1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.040
 like the ocean, everything's going with the current.

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:36.400
 And so anything that doesn't go with the current

1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:38.920
 is immediately kind of identifiable and strange

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.480
 and that's why these were initially strangers

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.480
 because they would be stationary against the wind.

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:45.360
 So if you had something like a good drone

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:47.800
 in a windy conditions, what would that look like?

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:50.380
 Would it not come off as stationary?

1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:53.280
 Would it sort of float about kind of thing?

1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:55.160
 No, I think with the drone technology we have today,

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:57.520
 they could stay within a pretty tight location.

1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:00.480
 Well, I meant like DJI drone,

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:03.040
 I'm saying like generically speaking,

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:03.880
 not a military drone.

1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.840
 No, I have a DJI drone myself even,

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:07.960
 and you know, maybe not a hundred knots,

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:11.120
 but if that thing's in 30 or 40 and not winds,

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:15.360
 the amount of distance it's going to be kind of

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.960
 doing one of these, like that change

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:19.680
 is not something I'm gonna detect from maybe many miles away.

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:20.520
 Interesting.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.560
 So it could look very stationary,

1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:24.160
 but that wasn't necessarily,

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.080
 and what's interesting about this story

1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:28.200
 is that there's not like the one smoking gun, right?

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:29.920
 You have to kind of look at everything.

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:34.260
 And that's what I don't like about the Department of Defense

1:09:34.260 --> 1:09:36.840
 and just generally people's take on this

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:39.680
 is that everything is kind of based around a single image,

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:41.540
 you know, or that one case,

1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:44.600
 but a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration

1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:45.600
 or the time it's been out there,

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.080
 how they're interacting relative to other objects out there.

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:49.520
 And you don't get that information

1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:52.360
 when you just look at a frame for a second, you know?

1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:54.800
 Everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object, but.

1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:57.360
 So you yourself, from your particular slice

1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.600
 of things you've experienced and seen directly

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:02.360
 or indirectly, you've kind of built up an intuition

1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:04.960
 about what are the things that were being seen.

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:05.880
 I wouldn't go that far.

1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:10.440
 I've just been able to eliminate some variables

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:12.500
 because of how long I've observed it.

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:14.720
 So like you said, yes, can a drone stay

1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.320
 in a particular position against the wind like that?

1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:18.640
 Certainly, but I don't think it can do that

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:21.520
 and then go 0.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know?

1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:24.700
 And so when you look at outside of that one,

1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:27.800
 that moment in time, then it eliminates

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:29.440
 a lot of the potential things it could be,

1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:30.720
 at least from my perspective.

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:33.560
 So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:36.560
 We'd see them flying in patterns,

1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:38.560
 kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns

1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:40.460
 or just going kind of straight east.

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:46.120
 Occasionally see them supersonic, 1.1, 1.2 Mach,

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:48.060
 but typically 0.6 to 0.8 Mach,

1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:51.040
 just for extremely extended periods of time,

1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.460
 essentially all the time.

1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:55.160
 And this is airspace where there's not supposed

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.480
 to be anything else at all.

1:10:57.480 --> 1:10:58.760
 And it's pretty far out there.

1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.460
 It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles.

1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:03.860
 Can you say the location that we're talking about?

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:05.680
 Off the coast of Virginia Beach.

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:09.320
 Got it, and so nobody's supposed to be out there?

1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:10.520
 It's possible for people to be there.

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.160
 It's not necessarily restricted,

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:14.520
 but it's well monitored and we're out there

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:15.480
 every day, all day.

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:17.280
 And so people know to stay clear.

1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:18.640
 If a Cessna goes bumbling in there,

1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:19.840
 everyone's gonna know about it.

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:23.180
 FAA is gonna call them out, gonna tell us about it.

1:11:23.180 --> 1:11:27.040
 So incursions happen, not a big deal,

1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:29.060
 but they're pretty rare, honestly,

1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:30.000
 because everyone knows the area

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.120
 and we've been operating there for decades.

1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:35.960
 And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach

1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.720
 that these objects were taking?

1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:42.160
 Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:44.760
 or kind of racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds,

1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:46.440
 or I just see them kind of,

1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.160
 and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description.

1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:52.240
 And when I say that, I mean like an autopilot

1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:54.560
 is gonna be just very precise, right?

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:56.520
 It's gonna be locked on straight.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:57.760
 Whereas I could see an airplane,

1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:59.280
 I could tell if the pilot's flying it, right?

1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:01.000
 Because it's not gonna be perfect.

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.320
 The computer's not controlling it.

1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:03.760
 And these seemed more like that.

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:05.340
 Not that they were imprecise,

1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:07.840
 but that they were even much more erratic than that.

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:10.080
 So like, it wasn't like a straight line in a turn.

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:13.200
 It was just kind of like a weird drift like that

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:14.520
 in that direction.

1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:17.360
 So it wasn't controlled by a dumb computer,

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:20.120
 or not disrespect to computers.

1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:23.000
 So it wasn't controlled by autopilot kind of technology.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.600
 That's not the sense that I got.

1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:28.880
 So how many people have seen them in the squadron?

1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:31.800
 Sort of how many times were they seen?

1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:36.400
 How many were there times when there's multiple objects?

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.320
 Once we started seeing them on the radar enough,

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:39.200
 and we would get close enough,

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:40.860
 we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well.

1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:45.080
 So our advanced targeting pod.

1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:47.320
 It's essentially a infrared camera

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.500
 that we use for targeting,

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:51.040
 mostly in the air to surface environment.

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:52.880
 We don't use it in the air to air arena.

1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:56.120
 It's just not that good of a tool, frankly.

1:12:56.120 --> 1:13:00.480
 But we would see IR energy emitting from that location

1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:01.780
 where the radar was dropping us off.

1:13:01.780 --> 1:13:03.960
 So the radar, we'd lock onto the object

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:05.520
 and our sensors would all look there.

1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:06.960
 And so then we could see that it's looking

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.040
 at that right piece of sky,

1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:11.080
 but there's energy actually coming from there.

1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:12.460
 So now we started thinking that, okay,

1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:14.680
 maybe not radar malfunctions, maybe more,

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:16.680
 maybe something is physically here, of course.

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:19.080
 And then people started to try to fly by it and see it.

1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:22.400
 And at this point, I would say maybe 80 to 90%

1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:23.760
 of our squadron had probably seen one of these

1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:24.720
 on the radar at this point.

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.320
 Everyone was aware of it.

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.200
 There was small communication, I think,

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:31.600
 between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar.

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.120
 So I knew it wasn't just our squadron

1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:35.120
 for whatever strange reason,

1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:36.720
 because other squadrons would be out there

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:37.560
 and we would talk to them,

1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:39.560
 like, hey, careful, there's an object.

1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:40.480
 Are you aware of that?

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:42.760
 So they would be aware of it.

1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:44.440
 And then, of course, people would want to go see

1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:45.320
 what they look like, right?

1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:46.840
 So people would try to fly by it.

1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:48.240
 I try to fly by it.

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:50.280
 I like how that's an of course.

1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:51.200
 Of course.

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:53.000
 Of course you don't want to fly by it.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:57.880
 There's an argument against that kind of perspective

1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:00.600
 that maybe the thing is dangerous, so maybe we don't.

1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:02.400
 But perhaps that's part of the reason

1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:03.240
 you want to fly by it,

1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.760
 is to understand better what it is if it's a threat.

1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:08.120
 We have a lot of context now that we didn't back then.

1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:10.320
 So it was still, hey, is this a balloon?

1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:12.360
 Is this a drone at a certain point?

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:14.800
 And we're also aware of potential intelligence gathering

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:17.000
 operations that could be going on.

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.560
 We're up there flying our tactics.

1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:20.080
 We're emitting.

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.960
 We're practicing our EW.

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.560
 We're turning at particular times.

1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:25.640
 There's stuff that can be learned.

1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:26.480
 It's not a secret.

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:29.800
 And countries keep different fishing vessels and whatnot

1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:31.200
 in international waters off there.

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:32.720
 So it's not exactly a secret

1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:35.360
 that we're being observed out there.

1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:38.920
 So to think that a foreign nation would want to

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:42.120
 somehow intercept information,

1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:46.720
 whether that's our radar signals or jamming capabilities

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:49.920
 to try to break that down or understand it better,

1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:53.240
 be ready for that next fight, I mean,

1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.720
 that's what scares me about this scenario

1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.000
 because we didn't jump right to aliens or UFOs.

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.480
 We thought, this is a radar malfunction

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:02.320
 we need to be aware of.

1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:03.160
 It's a safety issue.

1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:06.320
 And then this could be a tactical problem right here

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.920
 because everything we do is based off a crypto

1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:13.600
 and locations, everything's classified we do out there.

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:15.560
 And so over time, if you gather enough data

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.840
 about those fights and just monitor them forever,

1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:21.480
 just like some nations do with other

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:23.080
 piece of technology or software,

1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:25.520
 they could probably learn a lot.

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.080
 So we have to be cognizant of the fact

1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:28.200
 and defend against it.

1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:32.600
 So what can you say about the other characteristics

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:36.400
 of these objects like shape, size,

1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:43.320
 texture, luminosity, how else do you describe object?

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:45.160
 Is there something that could be said?

1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:47.920
 So you said like this is a tech town radar step one.

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:50.960
 Now you have FLIR images that can give you a sense

1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:52.920
 that that's actually a physical object.

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:55.680
 What else can be said about those physical objects?

1:15:55.680 --> 1:15:59.400
 So eventually someone did see one with their own eyeballs,

1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:02.200
 multiple people and they saw it

1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.720
 in a somewhat interesting way.

1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.720
 The object presented itself at the exact altitude

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:11.360
 and geographic location of the entry points

1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:13.200
 into our working areas.

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:16.200
 So we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:18.080
 and people leave the areas at the same point

1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:19.640
 at a lower altitude.

1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:21.520
 Probably one of the busiest pieces of sky

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.000
 on the eastern seaboard.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.720
 So two jets from my squadron went out

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:26.520
 and they went flying and they entered the area

1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:28.520
 and one of these objects went right between the aircraft.

1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.240
 So they're flying in formation

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:32.320
 and the object went between the aircraft.

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:33.680
 They went between the object I think.

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.720
 I don't think that the object was moving.

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.320
 I don't think it aggressively went at them.

1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:39.440
 I think it was located still there

1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:41.000
 and then they flew through it.

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.600
 But they didn't have it on their radar.

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:48.040
 And I think the radar might have been malfunctioning.

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:48.960
 I don't know that for sure.

1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:50.280
 I would like to look into it

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:53.520
 but my supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning

1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:55.600
 it would make sense that they wouldn't avoid the object

1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:56.440
 that was there

1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:59.120
 because they knew these were physical at that point.

1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.040
 And we would go up to these objects all the time

1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:03.760
 and try to see them and couldn't see them.

1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.320
 And we didn't know what it was.

1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:07.640
 Was it, were they just not there or being fooled?

1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:08.600
 Was something happening?

1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:11.880
 Were they moving, dropping altitude at the last minute?

1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:14.520
 We're going by pretty quick so it's difficult to tell.

1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:16.960
 But perhaps if his radar wasn't working

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:19.440
 it wasn't receiving energy from the jet.

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.640
 And the jet of course didn't know that it was there.

1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:24.120
 And so whatever the case was, they flew right by

1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:28.280
 and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube

1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:31.760
 inside a clear translucent sphere.

1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:33.400
 And the kind of the apex of the cube

1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:35.240
 or touching the inside of that sphere.

1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:39.520
 That's an image that's haunting.

1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:41.040
 So what do they think it is?

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:43.680
 What did they think at that moment?

1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:47.080
 That they, is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty

1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:50.200
 that they're just describing a geometric object?

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:54.080
 It's not on radar so it's unclear what it is.

1:17:55.280 --> 1:18:00.000
 Yeah, what was the, any kind of other description

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.600
 they've had of it in terms of the intuition

1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:03.880
 from a pilot's perspective?

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:06.240
 You have to kind of identify what a thing is.

1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:08.400
 To answer the first part,

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:10.360
 they actually canceled the flight and came back

1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:12.800
 because they were, it's like if there's one of these

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:14.000
 out here and we're almost hitting them

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.680
 and it's right there, then perhaps we need

1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:18.920
 to get a different jet with better radar.

1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:20.400
 So they came back and they're in their gear

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:22.520
 and they're talking to the front desk

1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:23.600
 and talking to Skipper and like,

1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:25.720
 hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there.

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.080
 And this kind of was one of those kind of

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.040
 slight watershed moments where we all were kind of like,

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:32.480
 all right, like this is a serious deal now.

1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:35.640
 Maybe it was a, maybe we thought they were balloons

1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:37.920
 or drones or malfunctions, or maybe we thought it was fine.

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:38.800
 But at the end of the day,

1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:39.920
 if we're gonna hit one of these things,

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:43.400
 then we need to take care of the situation.

1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:46.080
 And that's actually when we started submitting

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:50.720
 hazard reports or hazard reps to the Naval Aviation Safety

1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:53.600
 kind of communication network.

1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:56.520
 And it's not like a big proactive thing

1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:57.640
 where people are gonna go investigate.

1:18:57.640 --> 1:18:59.240
 It's more of a data collection mechanism

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.440
 so that you can kind of share that aggregate data

1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:03.840
 and make sure that things are progressing.

1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.960
 So it wasn't a mechanism that would result

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:09.240
 in action being taken, but we were hoping

1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:11.080
 to at least get the message out to whomever

1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:12.800
 was maybe running a classified program

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:14.520
 that we were not aware of or something like that,

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.320
 that hey, like you could kill somebody here.

1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.120
 Like you've grown too big for your bridges here.

1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:20.680
 Take a step back.

1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:22.720
 So that was our concern at that point.

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.040
 That's kind of where we were thinking this was going.

1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:27.280
 What's the protocol for shooting at a thing?

1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:31.360
 Was there a concern that it's a direct threat,

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:36.320
 not just surveillance, but a thing that could be a threat?

1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:37.360
 At least from my perspective,

1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:39.480
 like that never really crossed into my mind.

1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:44.000
 I thought it was potentially an intelligence failure

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.800
 that could be being watched and information gathered.

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:48.400
 But I didn't think that it was something

1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.040
 that would proactively engage me in a hostile manner.

1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:55.320
 It wouldn't really make sense either too.

1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.240
 It would be shocking to like have one of these objects

1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.400
 take out an F18, but there's no real tactical advantage

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:01.640
 other than fear perhaps.

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.000
 Psychological, yeah.

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.080
 I've learned a lot about the psychological warfare

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:11.600
 in Ukraine as a big part of the war

1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:14.000
 in terms of when you talk about siege warfare,

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:17.960
 about wars that last for many years, for many months,

1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:20.560
 and then perhaps could extend to years.

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:24.760
 But yes, it didn't seem,

1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:29.760
 it didn't fit your conception of a threatening entity.

1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:30.720
 Correct.

1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:35.840
 So looking back now from all the pieces of data

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:39.160
 you've integrated, you've personally added,

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:40.900
 what do you think it could be?

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:42.920
 I don't know.

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:44.120
 I don't know what it could be.

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:47.080
 I think we've been able to categorize it successfully

1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:48.600
 into a few buckets.

1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:51.880
 We've been able to say that this could be US technology

1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:55.920
 that someone put in the wrong piece of sky

1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:00.040
 or perhaps was developed and tested in an inappropriate spot

1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:02.880
 by someone that wasn't being best practices.

1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:04.520
 Is there, sorry to interrupt,

1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:08.380
 is there a sort of modularity to the way

1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:10.900
 the military operates, the way it's possible

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:13.920
 for one branch not to know about the tests of another?

1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:15.680
 Yeah, I think it's perfectly reasonable

1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:17.680
 to think that that could occur, right?

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:19.820
 And so if we just make that assumption,

1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:21.920
 we can integrate that into our analysis here

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.640
 and just say, okay, but at the point we're at now,

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:26.440
 we have to assume that that's not the case, right?

1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:27.820
 With everything that's been going on

1:21:27.820 --> 1:21:30.280
 and the statements have been made and the hearings,

1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:35.280
 I think that if it was a noncommunication issue,

1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:37.280
 we're in big trouble at this point.

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.480
 What about it being an object from another nation,

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.680
 from China, from Russia?

1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:44.300
 Or even one of our allies, perhaps, right?

1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:49.040
 Maybe that's, you know, I don't think it's controversial

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:51.360
 to say that our allies could be gathering information

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:52.520
 about us or anything of that nature,

1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:54.000
 but that would be an extreme case,

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.760
 but I think it's just important to say, right?

1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:57.440
 To not just say Russia or China

1:21:57.440 --> 1:21:58.680
 and just call them the bad guys

1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:01.580
 and assume that if they don't have it, no one can do it.

1:22:01.580 --> 1:22:03.720
 And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else,

1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:05.000
 anyone else, and it doesn't necessarily need

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000
 to be a foreign power.

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.380
 It could be a non government entity, perhaps,

1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:10.880
 although I think that's very unlikely.

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.360
 But again, these are things you must consider

1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:15.720
 if you kind of throw everything,

1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:18.600
 everything other than the US under scrutiny.

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.400
 But you know, from what has been reported

1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:23.920
 and the behaviors that have been seen,

1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:26.720
 it would be, I would expect to see remnants

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:29.920
 of that technology elsewhere in the economy.

1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:32.280
 There seems to be too many things

1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:35.660
 that require advanced technology

1:22:35.660 --> 1:22:37.880
 that would be beneficial commercially,

1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:40.120
 as well as in other military applications

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:42.200
 for it to be completely locked away

1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:44.160
 by one of our competitors.

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.320
 Now I could see us perhaps locking something away

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:47.520
 if we're already in the lead

1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:50.600
 and having it to pull out as needed.

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:53.520
 But for someone that's perhaps in a power struggle

1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:55.080
 and they're in second place,

1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:57.360
 they might be more aggressive with the development

1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.760
 of different types of technology

1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:00.640
 willing to accept bigger risks.

1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.400
 Do you think it could be natural phenomena

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:06.160
 that we don't yet understand?

1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:08.420
 I think that there are a number of things

1:23:08.420 --> 1:23:09.720
 that this is going to be, right?

1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:11.360
 I don't think there's one thing at the end of the day,

1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:13.340
 but I certainly think that that is part

1:23:13.340 --> 1:23:14.580
 of what some of this could be.

1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:17.640
 I don't think it's what we were seeing on the East Coast,

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:20.360
 and I don't think it is related to the Roosevelt incident,

1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:22.940
 or I'll even go out and say the Nimitz incident, but.

1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:24.480
 What's the Roosevelt incident?

1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:28.000
 The Roosevelt incident, typically referred to as the gimbal

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.460
 and or the go fast video.

1:23:29.460 --> 1:23:33.240
 And then the Nimitz is from what the David Fravor

1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:36.000
 has witnessed directly and spoken about.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.140
 We'll talk about that as well.

1:23:37.140 --> 1:23:42.000
 I'd just love to get your sort of interpretation

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:42.840
 of those incidents.

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:45.560
 But yeah, so in this particular case,

1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:48.720
 natural phenomena could be a part of the picture,

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:50.920
 but you're saying not the whole picture.

1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:53.340
 Yes, yes, and we can't discount it.

1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:57.440
 Oh, the other thing is what about the failure

1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:00.480
 of pilot eyesight?

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:05.480
 Like sort of some deep mixture of actual direct vision,

1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:10.960
 human vision system failure, and like psychology.

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:15.960
 Like seeing something weird and then filling in the gaps.

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:20.820
 Because in order to make sense of the weird.

1:24:20.820 --> 1:24:25.820
 I've tried to expose myself to scenarios like that

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:28.060
 that I don't necessarily think are right,

1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:31.360
 but I've explored them to see if they could have some truth.

1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:34.080
 And one example is let's imagine a scenario

1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:35.520
 where if we're seeing these objects every day

1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:38.760
 off the East Coast, I can imagine a technology

1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:41.440
 or an operation where you had some type

1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.560
 of traditional propulsion system operating drones

1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:47.680
 in order to gather data like we had discussed.

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:51.640
 And I could envision a clever enough adversary

1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:54.640
 that could perhaps destroy or somehow remove these objects

1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:56.880
 and replace them with new objects essentially

1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:58.080
 when we're not looking, right?

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:02.480
 And that accounts for the large airborne time.

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.920
 And so I explore options like that

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:08.280
 and I try to see what evidence and assumptions

1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:11.440
 need to be made in order to prove or disprove that.

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.640
 And you would need so much infrastructure.

1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:16.360
 You'd need so many assets.

1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:18.720
 And so I try to explore some of those fallacies

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.040
 and some of those concerns.

1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:23.200
 And as aviators, we're trained into many

1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:24.920
 like actual physical, like eyesight

1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:26.800
 and kind of illusion training.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:28.520
 So like at nighttime flying,

1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:29.680
 there's so many things that can happen

1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:30.920
 flying with false horizons.

1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:34.880
 And so we receive hours of training on that type of stuff,

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:37.320
 but this just falls outside the category

1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:38.360
 from my perspective.

1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:40.600
 What was the visibility conditions

1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:42.960
 in the times when people were able to see it?

1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:47.960
 And we just earlier discussed complete nighttime, darkness.

1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:53.040
 In this case, was it during the day?

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.000
 It was a perfectly clear day that particular incident, yep.

1:25:57.440 --> 1:25:59.040
 In a world that's full of mystery,

1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:02.720
 I have to ask what do you think is the possibility

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:07.720
 that it's not of this earth origin?

1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:11.280
 I like the term nonhuman intelligence in a sense,

1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:16.040
 because again, there's a lot of assumptions in there

1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:18.920
 that may cause us to go down the wrong roads.

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:21.960
 It could, you know, these could be something

1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.200
 that are weather phenomena of earth, right?

1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:26.920
 Or something else that is just something we don't understand

1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:30.280
 and can't imagine right now that's still of this earth.

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:33.160
 If we consider extraterrestrials or something

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:37.480
 that came from a physical place far away in space time,

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:39.840
 you know, that leads us to some detection assumptions

1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:40.960
 that we would need to make.

1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:43.760
 And so I just try to not categorize it under anything

1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:47.040
 and just say, hey, is this demonstrating intelligence?

1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:49.160
 And start from there as a single object.

1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:50.760
 What can we learn about it kinematically?

1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:51.600
 How it's performing?

1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:53.520
 What does that mean for its energy source?

1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:56.000
 What does that mean for the G forces inside?

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.320
 And then step it out a level and say, okay,

1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:00.120
 how are these interacting with our fighters?

1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:02.080
 If they are, how are they interacting with the weather

1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:03.280
 and their environment?

1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:04.840
 How are they interacting with each other?

1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.920
 So can we look at these and how they're interacting

1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:09.840
 perhaps as a swarm, especially off the East coast

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:12.680
 where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.

1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:13.520
 Right?

1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:15.040
 And so we might be able to determine some things

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:17.480
 about their maybe, you know, sensor capabilities

1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:20.320
 or the areas of focus, you know, if we can determine

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:22.720
 how they're working in conjunction with each other.

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:25.120
 But, you know, seeing one little flash of an object

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.960
 doesn't provide that type of insight.

1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:30.720
 But we have the systems for it, and it's kind of,

1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:33.440
 you know, an irony, but it's a fact of life,

1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.320
 the reality that many of these well deployed,

1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:40.140
 highly capable systems are held under the military umbrella,

1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:42.440
 which makes it difficult to provide that data

1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:44.480
 for scientific analysis.

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:48.120
 So there's probably a lot more data on these objects

1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:51.600
 that's not being, that's not made available,

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:54.920
 probably even within the military for analysis.

1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:55.760
 I think so.

1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.160
 Yeah, I think there's a lot of data

1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:58.760
 that could be made available.

1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:01.840
 And, you know, that's one of the reasons why, you know,

1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:04.480
 I've been engaged with the American Institute of Aeronautics

1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:07.160
 and Astronautics to build, you know,

1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:10.520
 a large resources of cross domain expertise

1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:13.120
 so that if or when that data is available

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:15.760
 or that there's additional analysis needed, you know,

1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.600
 we can spin up those teams and make that analysis.

1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:22.120
 So there was a recently a house intelligence subcommittee

1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.080
 hearing on UFOs that you were a part of.

1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:26.560
 What was the goal of that hearing?

1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:30.800
 And can you maybe summarize what you heard?

1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:33.360
 The hearings, from my perspective,

1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:36.540
 seemed a bit disingenuous, kind of top level.

1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:37.680
 I think...

1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:39.420
 Who was it run by, sorry to interrupt,

1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:41.400
 like who were the people involved

1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:43.160
 and what was the goal, the stated goal?

1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:46.080
 Congressman Andre Carson did chair the committee

1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:48.160
 and he was, I think, ultimately responsible

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:49.760
 for bringing it all together.

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:51.440
 You know, I think the intent from Congress

1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:54.500
 was to try to bring light to what has been happening

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:58.000
 with the Navy and to help show the American people

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.800
 that Congress is taking this serious

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.760
 because something serious is happening.

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.640
 But, you know, the sense I got seemed a bit disingenuous.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:06.880
 They talked around it a lot.

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.880
 They, you know, advertised their love of science fiction,

1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:14.640
 but they, you know, they didn't treat this,

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.320
 I would say, in the manner it deserved

1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:17.600
 as a potential tactical threat

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:20.240
 if it's coming from a foreign power.

1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:21.560
 And I get it though, at the same day,

1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:24.440
 they have very specific objectives

1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:25.840
 within the DOD, right?

1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:27.320
 They have a very important job.

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:29.840
 Their job isn't necessarily to do exploratory science

1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:30.680
 for no reason.

1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:35.380
 So I applaud and I encourage their efforts

1:29:35.380 --> 1:29:38.280
 on the intelligence side to help understand this,

1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:41.380
 but my concern is that they play a role

1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:44.400
 they're not well suited for, which is doing science.

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:46.160
 And the Pentagon has opened a new office

1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:47.600
 to investigate UFOs called

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:50.720
 All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:52.380
 What do you think about this office?

1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:55.760
 Do you think it can help alleviate in a way

1:29:55.760 --> 1:29:58.840
 which this hearing perhaps has failed

1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:01.920
 to improve more the scientific rigor

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:05.180
 and the seriousness of investigating UFOs?

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:07.680
 I think that remains to be seen.

1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:09.400
 I think it's a step in the right direction,

1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:10.880
 but it's a step that was taken

1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:14.060
 because the previous step didn't happen, right?

1:30:14.060 --> 1:30:18.720
 So the AOI MSG was the progeny, essentially,

1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:21.480
 of the AARO or AERO.

1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:25.880
 And the name was changed because nothing was happening

1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:29.080
 and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words

1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:31.480
 that were created to make this topic unpalatable.

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.520
 The Airborne Objects Identification

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.720
 Synchronization Management Group.

1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:38.280
 Quite the mouthful.

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:39.960
 I practice that.

1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:43.080
 But the new All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office,

1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:44.320
 from my perspective at least,

1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:46.240
 at least the perspective that they're putting out,

1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:48.240
 they seem to want to be open.

1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:50.440
 They put out a Twitter handle,

1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:52.360
 they're going out on Twitter and communicating,

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:54.600
 saying they want to keep this open.

1:30:54.600 --> 1:30:57.600
 But that's gonna run into a classification wall.

1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:02.600
 Well, so Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick seems like an interesting guy.

1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:04.760
 He does, yes.

1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:08.960
 So he's got a, Evan looked in too deeply,

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:11.320
 but he seems to have sort of,

1:31:11.320 --> 1:31:13.560
 he's coming from like a science research perspective,

1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:15.780
 like a background.

1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:20.780
 So he might be, at least in the right mindset,

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:25.820
 the right background to kind of lead a serious investigation.

1:31:25.820 --> 1:31:26.660
 I think so.

1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:28.360
 I'll just say generally,

1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:31.120
 the office has been receptive to AIAA reaching out

1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:35.040
 in order to collaborate, which has been a positive sign.

1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:38.560
 Also pass the same kudos to Dr. Spergel

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.060
 and NASA's effort as well.

1:31:42.060 --> 1:31:44.760
 I see these organizations that are standing up,

1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:47.800
 I do see them as good faith efforts

1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:51.920
 that are coming about through a lot of difficulty

1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:53.960
 and negotiation most likely, right?

1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:57.360
 And I see these as a small door opening

1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:58.640
 that if we can take advantage of,

1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:01.760
 can lead to a much more productive relationship

1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:03.480
 between these organizations.

1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:05.960
 How do you put pressure on this kind of thing?

1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:08.280
 Does it come from the civilian leadership?

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:10.760
 Does it come from sort of Congress and presidents?

1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:12.480
 Does it come from the public?

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:15.320
 Does the public have any power to put pressure on this?

1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:19.000
 Or is the giant wall of bureaucracy

1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.920
 going to protect it against any public pressure?

1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:22.840
 What do you think?

1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:25.840
 I think we've been in that latter state for a while,

1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:29.880
 but society seems to be a bit different nowadays.

1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:32.360
 We have the ability to communicate and to group

1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:34.560
 and to form relationships in a way

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:37.480
 that hasn't been able to be present in the past.

1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:40.160
 We've been able to do research for better or worse

1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:43.880
 on our own in a way that hasn't been able to happen before.

1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.160
 And so I sense that people are a bit less willing

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.240
 to kind of buy the bottom line statement

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.240
 from those in power as they used to be

1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:54.800
 back when they didn't have access to those tools.

1:32:54.800 --> 1:32:56.640
 And so I do think there is a massive role

1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:59.560
 for the general society, general populace to play

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:02.040
 to show that they are interested in this.

1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:05.200
 Because it's not that I don't think the politicians

1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:07.920
 or the leaders in the Pentagon,

1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:10.480
 it's not that they don't like this topic necessarily

1:33:10.480 --> 1:33:12.160
 or think it's toxic per se,

1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:15.000
 but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:16.800
 and they don't feel comfortable talking about it.

1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:19.360
 And these are people that have spent their entire careers

1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:21.560
 working towards a goal and getting to very high positions

1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:22.640
 within government.

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.480
 And so this is very against their nature

1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:26.760
 to take a stance on a topic like this.

1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:30.640
 And so the fact that these are standing up,

1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:32.520
 even if they do have a small budget

1:33:32.520 --> 1:33:34.360
 or if they struggled a bit at first,

1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:36.640
 I still think it's a massive change

1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:38.760
 and it's a big step away from that stigma

1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:41.640
 that has been pervading this topic for so long.

1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:45.720
 And you're actually part of alleviating the stigma

1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:49.680
 for somebody that's as credible, as intelligent,

1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:53.120
 as varied in background, able to speak about these things.

1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:55.200
 That's a big risk that you took,

1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:56.960
 but it's extremely valuable

1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.800
 because it's alleviating the stigma.

1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:00.720
 I thank you for saying that,

1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:03.480
 but it didn't feel like much of a risk for me.

1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:06.480
 I didn't come out about aliens or whatever.

1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:10.080
 I had a safety problem that I started asking questions about.

1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:12.200
 And I went down a road

1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:15.640
 as a Navy trained aviation safety officer, right?

1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:16.960
 That sent me to school for six weeks

1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:18.960
 and Pensacola would be a safety officer.

1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:21.760
 We're almost hitting these objects

1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:23.920
 and it's not something that happened in the past

1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:25.840
 and we want to understand it, it's happening right now.

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:28.280
 Like these occurrences are still happening.

1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:29.920
 Aviators are flying right now,

1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:31.200
 are still flying by these things.

1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:34.720
 And in fact, I mentioned I was an instructor pilot.

1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:39.720
 And I had a student call me about eight months ago or so.

1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:43.720
 And he's like, hey, sir, I made it to the fleet finally.

1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:44.960
 I had trained him how to fly.

1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:47.880
 And then he goes to F18, he goes another year of training.

1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:50.120
 And then he gets out to his squadron on the East Coast

1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:53.680
 and he's flying with a senior member of the base,

1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.440
 NAS Oceana, where the fighters fly out of Senior 0506.

1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:00.280
 And it was kind of a bad weather day.

1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:02.360
 And so they said, hey, if the weather's not good enough

1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:04.240
 for us to do this dog fighting set,

1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.720
 we'll go out and do a UAP hunt,

1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:07.800
 and see if we can't find any things

1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.040
 or take a look at them.

1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:10.440
 I don't know if it was ingest or not,

1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:14.280
 but I actually would say it's not ingest

1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:16.800
 because there were notices that were being briefed

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:18.880
 about this being a safety hazard at this point.

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.080
 And so now that I think about it, it likely wasn't ingest.

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:24.560
 Long story short, they went flying.

1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:25.880
 The weather was too bad.

1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:28.880
 They did go on a UFO hunt and they physically saw one.

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.160
 And he called me up and said,

1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.520
 hey, sir, I saw a Cuban sphere.

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:33.400
 They're still out here years later.

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.720
 And so it's almost like a generational issue

1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:37.960
 for these fighter pilots, at least on East Coast.

1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:39.840
 But that's great that they can talk about it, right?

1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:41.040
 Exactly, exactly.

1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:42.160
 They feel at least comfortable.

1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:43.840
 They have a reporting mechanism.

1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.040
 And so that was one of the problems that I noticed

1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:48.640
 that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms

1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:52.880
 to take care of safety issues and even tactical issues

1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.680
 when the time's right in order to keep track

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:55.800
 of what's going on,

1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:58.360
 but there's no way to communicate about this.

1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:00.840
 Sure, we could submit a hazard report,

1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:03.280
 but nothing's actually being investigated

1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:07.200
 and if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more,

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:09.040
 it deserves attention.

1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.720
 If I could ask your sort of take your opinion

1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.280
 of the different UFO sightings

1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:19.640
 that the DOD has released videos on.

1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:22.620
 So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO

1:36:22.620 --> 1:36:26.000
 that David Fravor and others have sighted?

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.800
 That's a truly anomalous experience.

1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:33.800
 I can't do like mental models in my head

1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:39.620
 to find potential solutions to discredit that, right?

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:40.820
 Like as much as I try, right?

1:36:40.820 --> 1:36:42.640
 Just as a logical process, as a practice,

1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:45.220
 I can't pick it apart in the way

1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:46.500
 that we were just talking about a moment ago

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:49.300
 about thousands of drones being like sent up

1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:50.380
 in very tricky manners, right?

1:36:50.380 --> 1:36:53.580
 I can't really bring myself to a clever solution

1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:56.340
 that other than just saying the pilots are lying

1:36:56.340 --> 1:36:57.980
 or it was error, you know?

1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:00.740
 And I believe, you know, I know Dave Fravor,

1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:02.900
 you know, I consider him a friend, we talk a lot.

1:37:02.900 --> 1:37:07.000
 I have zero, zero reason to disbelieve anything he says.

1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:13.220
 Yeah, I agree with you, but in terms of the actual UFO,

1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:18.460
 is there something anomalous and interesting to you

1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:19.960
 about that particular case?

1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:24.740
 Maybe one interesting aspect there is how much

1:37:24.740 --> 1:37:28.340
 do I understand about the water surface

1:37:28.340 --> 1:37:30.540
 and underwater aspects of these UFOs?

1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:32.380
 It seems like a lot of the discussions

1:37:32.380 --> 1:37:36.200
 is about the movement of this particular thing

1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:40.380
 that seems to be weird, anomalous, seems to defy physics,

1:37:40.380 --> 1:37:42.140
 but what about stuff that's happening underwater?

1:37:42.140 --> 1:37:43.800
 That's interesting to me.

1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:47.380
 If I had advanced technology, I would certainly

1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:49.460
 like to operate in part underwater

1:37:49.460 --> 1:37:51.660
 because you can hide a lot of stuff there.

1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:53.620
 You think it would be somewhat as easy

1:37:53.620 --> 1:37:56.100
 as traveling through interstellar space, at least, right?

1:37:56.100 --> 1:37:56.940
 Yeah.

1:37:56.940 --> 1:38:00.100
 You know, I wish I had a great answer for that,

1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:04.900
 but as an aviator, that's kind of a black box for us.

1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:06.820
 We don't have great, what I would call

1:38:06.820 --> 1:38:08.220
 cross domain tracking, right?

1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:09.860
 I can't see something go underwater

1:38:09.860 --> 1:38:11.420
 and then follow it underwater.

1:38:11.420 --> 1:38:12.900
 So it's literally not your domain,

1:38:12.900 --> 1:38:15.500
 like underwater, like leave that for somebody else.

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:17.540
 Yeah, and you know, I use that terminology

1:38:17.540 --> 1:38:20.020
 because it's kind of important, right?

1:38:20.020 --> 1:38:22.720
 Cross domain tracking is something that we haven't had

1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:23.740
 to necessarily worry about, right?

1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:25.840
 Because airplanes operated in the air

1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:28.380
 and submarines operated underwater

1:38:28.380 --> 1:38:30.340
 and space planes operate in space, right?

1:38:30.340 --> 1:38:33.180
 But you know, there's going to be, you know,

1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:35.820
 that's going to blur, I think, as we move along here,

1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:38.300
 especially in the air and space regime

1:38:38.300 --> 1:38:41.820
 and being able to perhaps transition my radar contact

1:38:41.820 --> 1:38:44.740
 at 40,000 feet to another radar system

1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:47.680
 that can track it up to 200,000 feet,

1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:48.820
 you know, that might be a value.

1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:51.320
 And so we seem to be missing that right now.

1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:53.740
 So what about the go fast and the gimbal videos

1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:54.700
 that you mentioned earlier?

1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:57.900
 There was a, like, what's interesting there to you?

1:38:58.740 --> 1:39:01.120
 So the gimbal, I'll talk about that one first.

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:02.820
 I was airborne for that one.

1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:05.980
 The person that recorded it was a good friend of mine,

1:39:05.980 --> 1:39:07.540
 but I mean, both air crew, I knew both of them,

1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:10.140
 but the wizard himself, very close friends,

1:39:10.140 --> 1:39:12.060
 went through a lot of her training together.

1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:14.580
 We went to the same fleet squadron.

1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:16.780
 He ended up transitioning to be a pilot

1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:19.460
 and then came to where I was instructing.

1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:21.980
 So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition.

1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:25.740
 And, you know, the way that was,

1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:28.900
 was we went out on a air to air training mission.

1:39:28.900 --> 1:39:33.080
 So simulating a air fight against our own guys,

1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:34.260
 they're acting like the bad guys

1:39:34.260 --> 1:39:36.660
 and kind of go head to head against each other.

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:37.960
 And when we fly on those missions,

1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:40.500
 we all fly out together, more or less,

1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:43.300
 we set up and then we kind of attrite from the fight

1:39:43.300 --> 1:39:46.060
 as we either, you know, run out of gas or something happens.

1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:49.060
 And so people usually go back onesies or twosies.

1:39:49.060 --> 1:39:51.700
 And so the air crew that recorded the gimbal,

1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:52.980
 they were going back to the boat

1:39:52.980 --> 1:39:55.380
 and we were on what's called a workup training event.

1:39:55.380 --> 1:39:57.700
 And so this is like a month on the boat

1:39:57.700 --> 1:40:00.640
 where we're essentially conducting war time operations,

1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:03.420
 more or less, to stress ourselves out

1:40:03.420 --> 1:40:06.260
 and to kind of do the last training block

1:40:06.260 --> 1:40:07.540
 before we go on deployment, essentially.

1:40:07.540 --> 1:40:09.340
 So it's pretty high stress.

1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:12.780
 They actually do send aircraft from like land bases

1:40:12.780 --> 1:40:14.400
 to kind of try to penetrate

1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:15.980
 and we're expected to go intercept them.

1:40:15.980 --> 1:40:18.580
 And so we're kind of practicing like we play.

1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:21.680
 And so he saw these objects on the radar,

1:40:23.020 --> 1:40:27.240
 the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles.

1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:29.540
 And they initially thought it was part

1:40:29.540 --> 1:40:31.860
 of the training exercise that they were sending something

1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:35.140
 in to try to penetrate the airspace.

1:40:35.140 --> 1:40:37.220
 And so they, you know, they flew over to it

1:40:37.220 --> 1:40:40.260
 and as they got close enough to get on the FLIR,

1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:43.140
 you know, I think everyone has heard their reaction

1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:44.540
 and they realized that it wasn't something

1:40:44.540 --> 1:40:46.140
 they were expecting to see.

1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:47.540
 Can you actually describe what's in the video

1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:49.940
 and what's the reaction in case they haven't seen it?

1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:51.540
 Yeah, a lot of swearing.

1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:53.500
 But so what you see on the FLIR footage

1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:57.180
 is a black or white, depending on when you look at it,

1:40:57.180 --> 1:40:59.420
 object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal.

1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:02.660
 It appears almost as if someone put two plates together

1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:05.820
 and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel

1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:08.260
 of IR energy that's at the top of the bottom

1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:09.620
 of those plates in a sense.

1:41:09.620 --> 1:41:12.420
 So almost as if, you know, there's a stick going in

1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:14.580
 between two plates, but not that pronounced, right?

1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:16.860
 So there's an energy field that kind of went to a funnel

1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:17.700
 on the top and the bottom,

1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:20.300
 at least that's how it's being portrayed on the FLIR.

1:41:21.260 --> 1:41:23.260
 There's a lot of conversation about that being glare,

1:41:23.260 --> 1:41:24.100
 things of that nature,

1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:26.500
 but it was actually a very tight IR image.

1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:30.420
 It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting.

1:41:30.420 --> 1:41:32.820
 Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft,

1:41:32.820 --> 1:41:35.020
 we can see the flames coming out of the exhaust,

1:41:35.020 --> 1:41:36.420
 especially at those ranges.

1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:38.180
 But...

1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:39.980
 And there was no flames or there's no exhaust here.

1:41:39.980 --> 1:41:42.540
 There was no exhaust, there was no, you know,

1:41:42.540 --> 1:41:45.580
 there was no outgassing of repellent in any manner, right?

1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:48.420
 It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it

1:41:48.420 --> 1:41:49.900
 that was stationary in the sky.

1:41:49.900 --> 1:41:53.780
 Well, not stationary, but it was moving along a path, right?

1:41:53.780 --> 1:41:55.980
 It wasn't falling out of the sky.

1:41:55.980 --> 1:41:58.020
 And it continued along, if we were to consider it

1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:01.020
 from a God's eye view, again, on the SA page,

1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:02.860
 it continued along in a path.

1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:05.820
 And from the perspective, that top down view,

1:42:05.820 --> 1:42:07.180
 it just went in another direction.

1:42:07.180 --> 1:42:10.820
 So no, just an instantaneous direction change

1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:12.020
 from that perspective.

1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:15.300
 You also hear them, you know, very excitedly talking

1:42:15.300 --> 1:42:18.980
 on the tapes about, you know, whatever the heck this thing is

1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:21.980
 and look at the SA, there's a whole formation of them.

1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:25.860
 And so the SA is a situational awareness page.

1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:27.460
 And again, it's a large display that gives

1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:29.900
 that God's eye view of all the radar contacts.

1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:32.460
 So the video is actually showing just one

1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:35.980
 and then they're speaking about many of them

1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:38.020
 on the SA display.

1:42:38.020 --> 1:42:38.860
 Correct.

1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:40.580
 And what they essentially saw was,

1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:42.900
 if we were to consider above the object north,

1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:46.380
 so kind of offset to the north of the object,

1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:47.900
 there was a formation of about somewhere

1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:49.940
 between four and six of these objects

1:42:49.940 --> 1:42:51.660
 in a rough wedge formation, you know,

1:42:51.660 --> 1:42:54.500
 so kind of side by side like this.

1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:57.420
 And again, not in a like autopilot type manner

1:42:57.420 --> 1:42:58.300
 where it was very stiff.

1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:00.660
 It was very kind of non mechanical,

1:43:00.660 --> 1:43:02.660
 the flight mechanics again.

1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:04.460
 And these objects were in that formation

1:43:04.460 --> 1:43:06.940
 and they were going along and then they turned

1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:09.660
 pretty sharply, but they still had a radius of turn

1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:11.540
 and then went back in the opposite direction.

1:43:11.540 --> 1:43:13.780
 And during that turn, they were kind of like

1:43:13.780 --> 1:43:14.620
 all over the place.

1:43:14.620 --> 1:43:15.620
 Like it wasn't tight.

1:43:15.620 --> 1:43:17.300
 They weren't even like super,

1:43:17.300 --> 1:43:18.940
 they weren't flying in a way I would expect them

1:43:18.940 --> 1:43:20.860
 to be flying in relation to a flight lead.

1:43:20.860 --> 1:43:23.020
 They were flying as if they were flying close

1:43:23.020 --> 1:43:24.420
 to each other, but not in formation,

1:43:24.420 --> 1:43:26.060
 which was kind of strange, right?

1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:28.140
 And then when they rolled out,

1:43:28.140 --> 1:43:29.300
 they kind of tightened back up.

1:43:29.300 --> 1:43:30.740
 Like, so when they basically,

1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:32.900
 they started that turn and then 180 degrees out,

1:43:32.900 --> 1:43:35.540
 essentially they start flowing in the opposite direction

1:43:35.540 --> 1:43:37.460
 and kind of got back in that formation.

1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:38.820
 And while that was happening,

1:43:38.820 --> 1:43:41.780
 the gimbal object was proceeding, let's say left to right.

1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:45.860
 And as those, the formation kind of turned up to the north

1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:47.340
 and was just passing back it,

1:43:47.340 --> 1:43:49.820
 the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction.

1:43:49.820 --> 1:43:52.060
 So to follow it back in that direction.

1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:57.220
 And in the FLIR itself, you see the object

1:43:57.220 --> 1:43:58.940
 changes orientation quite a bit.

1:43:58.940 --> 1:44:01.380
 So you see it more or less level,

1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:03.500
 maybe candid about 45 degrees.

1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:06.300
 And then you see it kind of moving around like this,

1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.860
 almost as if it was a gimbal.

1:44:08.860 --> 1:44:11.980
 I've come to learn after some,

1:44:11.980 --> 1:44:13.620
 having seen some research online

1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:15.860
 and people really looking into this,

1:44:15.860 --> 1:44:19.020
 that it seemed that the object actually climbed

1:44:19.020 --> 1:44:19.980
 during that maneuver.

1:44:19.980 --> 1:44:23.180
 And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately

1:44:23.180 --> 1:44:24.500
 is because it turned like this.

1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:26.700
 It turned in a vertical fashion like that,

1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:28.340
 which is pretty interesting.

1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:31.740
 That's kind of like another example of a flight mechanics

1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:33.300
 that we don't normally operate

1:44:33.300 --> 1:44:36.020
 because we don't change our directions

1:44:36.020 --> 1:44:37.860
 by maneuvering in the vertical.

1:44:37.860 --> 1:44:41.580
 If we can help it, you're just killing the fuel.

1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:44.780
 And so if you're like a surveillance platform

1:44:44.780 --> 1:44:46.620
 looking to spend as much time around something,

1:44:46.620 --> 1:44:51.260
 you're not gonna climb 500 feet every time you make a turn.

1:44:51.260 --> 1:44:53.460
 Unless you're Tom Cruise.

1:44:53.460 --> 1:44:54.980
 Unless you're Tom Cruise, naturally.

1:44:54.980 --> 1:44:57.060
 Okay, so is that one of the more impressive

1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:00.380
 flight mechanics you've seen in video forms

1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:03.020
 or not the direct eyesight reports,

1:45:03.020 --> 1:45:05.620
 but like in terms of video evidence that we have?

1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:06.820
 I think so.

1:45:06.820 --> 1:45:08.580
 We were seeing a lot of these,

1:45:08.580 --> 1:45:10.820
 but we weren't just going on recording them all day.

1:45:10.820 --> 1:45:13.020
 We just kind of put them in that safety bucket,

1:45:13.020 --> 1:45:14.300
 be like, all right, there's objects over there.

1:45:14.300 --> 1:45:16.220
 We're just not gonna go near it.

1:45:16.220 --> 1:45:19.020
 And so we weren't putting our sensors on them that much.

1:45:19.020 --> 1:45:21.380
 We were gathering the data kind of secondarily,

1:45:21.380 --> 1:45:23.300
 but we weren't primarily focusing on it

1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:24.780
 to see all the details.

1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:27.420
 That's so fascinating because you have a busy day.

1:45:27.420 --> 1:45:28.940
 You have a lot to do.

1:45:28.940 --> 1:45:31.340
 All right, well, there's some weird stuff going on there.

1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:32.700
 We're just not gonna go there.

1:45:32.700 --> 1:45:37.540
 And that says something about human nature,

1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:40.380
 about the way that bureaucracies function,

1:45:40.380 --> 1:45:41.940
 the way the military functions.

1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:44.820
 It fills up your day with busy, important things,

1:45:44.820 --> 1:45:48.020
 and you don't get to, I mean, that is something

1:45:48.020 --> 1:45:52.180
 that I'm in a sort of absurd way worry about,

1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:56.820
 which is like we fill our days with so much busyness

1:45:56.820 --> 1:45:59.580
 than when truly beautiful things happen,

1:45:59.580 --> 1:46:01.820
 whatever they are, truly anomalous things.

1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:04.100
 We just won't pay attention

1:46:04.100 --> 1:46:07.740
 because they don't fit our busy schedule.

1:46:07.740 --> 1:46:10.300
 Beautiful, I think that's right on the nose.

1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:13.700
 And it's on my nose because I didn't give this topic

1:46:13.700 --> 1:46:16.300
 the attention it deserved until I left, right?

1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:19.460
 Until I left and I went to be an instructor pilot

1:46:19.460 --> 1:46:21.780
 where I had more time.

1:46:21.780 --> 1:46:24.820
 I had more downtime to kind of process and think

1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:27.460
 and get out of exactly what you just described.

1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:29.340
 And that's kind of what broke me out of it

1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:31.340
 and got me thinking more about it.

1:46:31.340 --> 1:46:33.740
 Why do you think the DOD released these videos?

1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.060
 It's a great question.

1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:38.300
 Did the DOD release it or did they kind of get out

1:46:38.300 --> 1:46:39.540
 on their own in some sense?

1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:41.180
 So I don't know the answer to that question,

1:46:41.180 --> 1:46:42.900
 but my understanding of the situation

1:46:42.900 --> 1:46:45.820
 is that the DOD talked about them so much

1:46:45.820 --> 1:46:47.740
 because they were already out there in a sense.

1:46:47.740 --> 1:46:50.540
 And so they had a choice where they could have

1:46:50.540 --> 1:46:52.940
 just straight up lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was fake.

1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:56.260
 But again, I think our culture now is too open

1:46:56.260 --> 1:46:59.580
 and the information moves too freely to do things like that.

1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:00.740
 And it kind of left them in a pickle

1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:02.700
 that they had to respond to.

1:47:02.700 --> 1:47:05.460
 So what was the role of Pentagon's

1:47:05.460 --> 1:47:09.180
 Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence Program, AATIP?

1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:11.220
 From your perspective, from what you know,

1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:14.940
 maybe your intuition, is AATIP a real thing that existed?

1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:16.780
 I was in a position as an aviator

1:47:16.780 --> 1:47:20.120
 that never would have exposed me to anything like that.

1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:22.460
 But I was curious about what people knew.

1:47:22.460 --> 1:47:26.100
 And I think in my mind, maybe you hoped or,

1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:27.840
 hope someone was looking into this in some sense.

1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:30.980
 But on the day that Gimbal was recorded,

1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:34.100
 I heard that they caught something extra interesting

1:47:34.100 --> 1:47:38.220
 on the FLIR, and I went to the Intel debrief space

1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:41.700
 to go see the film.

1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:43.540
 And everyone's gathered around watching it,

1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:45.980
 very interesting, and I heard the admiral was coming down.

1:47:45.980 --> 1:47:48.260
 And so I was like, I'm gonna hang out back quietly,

1:47:48.260 --> 1:47:50.500
 mind my own business, and just wanna see his reaction,

1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:52.660
 try to read it to see if this is brand new

1:47:52.660 --> 1:47:55.660
 or if it is something that they've been dealing with.

1:47:55.660 --> 1:47:57.780
 And you know, he came in and he watched a video

1:47:57.780 --> 1:47:58.980
 for like five or six seconds,

1:47:58.980 --> 1:48:01.220
 and he went, mm, and then like turned around and walked out.

1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:02.340
 And you know, I was like,

1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:04.360
 he's definitely seen these before.

1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:06.340
 There's no way that you only watch that for a few seconds

1:48:06.340 --> 1:48:08.220
 and don't have more interest.

1:48:08.220 --> 1:48:09.920
 It was, you know, too bizarre.

1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:12.960
 So kind of going back, does the office exist?

1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.260
 Well, you know, I've heard that the admiral essentially

1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:22.700
 reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time,

1:48:22.700 --> 1:48:23.960
 essentially, after he left, right?

1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:26.500
 So he basically went back and I was told he reported that

1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:29.420
 to either ATEP directly or to other, you know,

1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:30.680
 somehow the information got there.

1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:33.920
 So from my perspective and from what I've experienced,

1:48:34.780 --> 1:48:36.780
 it seems like, yes, it was a thing.

1:48:36.780 --> 1:48:38.900
 But you know, as an aviator,

1:48:38.900 --> 1:48:40.420
 I wouldn't know either way, right?

1:48:40.420 --> 1:48:41.900
 That's just my experience from what happened.

1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:45.540
 But it seems like there's somewhere to report to.

1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:48.520
 At the time, it seemed like there was at least someplace

1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:50.540
 to complain to, if not report to.

1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:54.900
 Let me ask you about sort of people that are taking

1:48:54.900 --> 1:48:56.620
 a serious look at the videos

1:48:56.620 --> 1:48:59.900
 and just the different UFO sighting reports.

1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:03.840
 So there's a person named Meg West who is a skeptic

1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:05.500
 and tries to take a skeptical view

1:49:05.500 --> 1:49:08.980
 on every single piece of evidence on these UFO sightings.

1:49:08.980 --> 1:49:11.060
 What do you think about his analysis?

1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:14.660
 He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these

1:49:14.660 --> 1:49:18.580
 videos and assign probabilities to their explanations,

1:49:18.580 --> 1:49:23.580
 sort of leaning towards things that give a very low

1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:29.180
 probability to alien extraterrestrial type of explanations

1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:31.300
 for these UFOs.

1:49:31.300 --> 1:49:35.580
 What do you think about his approach to these analysis?

1:49:35.580 --> 1:49:37.300
 Well, two parts to his approach.

1:49:37.300 --> 1:49:39.420
 One, I commend him for all the good work

1:49:39.420 --> 1:49:41.220
 and effort he put into it.

1:49:41.220 --> 1:49:44.060
 I've seen him build some models and things of that nature.

1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:46.940
 And so I think that's something that's absolutely needed

1:49:46.940 --> 1:49:47.780
 in this environment.

1:49:47.780 --> 1:49:50.600
 No one's asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?

1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:55.140
 Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra.

1:49:55.140 --> 1:49:58.260
 But where I have a disagreement with his approach

1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:02.780
 is that he's approaching from a debunker standpoint.

1:50:02.780 --> 1:50:06.180
 And from my perspective, not speaking for everyone,

1:50:06.180 --> 1:50:09.980
 but when I hear that, that tells me that you're driving

1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:12.340
 towards a particular conclusion,

1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:16.980
 which has been a very safe process for the past X years.

1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:19.420
 It's been like a very safe business to be in

1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:21.420
 to tell people that they haven't seen aliens,

1:50:21.420 --> 1:50:23.940
 but times have changed a little bit.

1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:28.940
 And the tactics I've seen to try to retain that

1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:34.580
 view on reality has included things such as

1:50:34.580 --> 1:50:36.780
 completely dismissing what the aircrew are saying.

1:50:36.780 --> 1:50:39.980
 And I think that is a fallacy to think that

1:50:39.980 --> 1:50:42.820
 we have to take the human outside of that analysis.

1:50:42.820 --> 1:50:45.460
 So those are the two things I disagree with.

1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:48.700
 When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars

1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:51.500
 and you look out there in the vast cosmos,

1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:53.660
 only a small fraction of which we can see,

1:50:55.540 --> 1:50:57.540
 how many intelligent alien civilizations

1:50:57.540 --> 1:50:58.860
 do you think are out there?

1:50:58.860 --> 1:51:00.220
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:51:00.220 --> 1:51:01.620
 I do.

1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:03.280
 You know, I'm of the theory that we are not

1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:04.120
 the only people out there.

1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.920
 I think it would be a statistically silly comment

1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:09.260
 to assume we are, although I get that we are

1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:11.140
 the only data point that we currently have.

1:51:11.140 --> 1:51:13.840
 Although I'm willing to jump over that fence

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:15.980
 and say that yes, there most likely is

1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:18.140
 intelligent life elsewhere.

1:51:18.140 --> 1:51:19.940
 Although I'll concede that it is a possibility

1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:21.960
 we are early or it could be limited

1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:25.480
 or it could be in a manner that we don't recognize

1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:27.100
 or can really understand.

1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:30.140
 I spend so much time thinking about

1:51:30.140 --> 1:51:34.060
 how we anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic.

1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:36.300
 And we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense.

1:51:36.300 --> 1:51:38.660
 We've trained ourselves what to think about,

1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:41.860
 what we think is true or what this would be like.

1:51:41.860 --> 1:51:44.780
 And by doing so, I think we're closing ourselves off

1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:47.660
 to a lot of what the possibilities could be

1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:49.360
 and the things that we could miss.

1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:54.540
 You beautifully put that the thing that drew you

1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:57.140
 to fighter jets is the technology.

1:51:57.140 --> 1:52:00.380
 So if you were to think, to imagine

1:52:00.380 --> 1:52:04.820
 from an alien perspective, what kind of technologies

1:52:04.820 --> 1:52:07.580
 would we first encounter as human beings

1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:11.200
 if we were to meet another alien civilization

1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:13.180
 in the next few centuries?

1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:15.840
 What kind of thing would we see?

1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:17.540
 So you're now at the cutting edge

1:52:17.540 --> 1:52:20.100
 and you see the quick progress that's happening.

1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:21.900
 That was happening throughout the 20th century,

1:52:21.900 --> 1:52:24.740
 that's happening now with greater degrees of autonomy

1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:26.540
 with robots and that kind of stuff.

1:52:26.540 --> 1:52:28.940
 What do you think we will encounter?

1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:32.620
 I think we're gonna see the ability to manipulate matter

1:52:32.620 --> 1:52:34.620
 like we used to manipulate information.

1:52:34.620 --> 1:52:38.080
 Like I think that's what, whether that means

1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:40.380
 being able to pop something on the table

1:52:40.380 --> 1:52:44.940
 that didn't exist or to influence a chemical reaction

1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:47.200
 somewhere, but being able to manipulate

1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:51.060
 and treat matter as if it was information.

1:52:51.060 --> 1:52:53.740
 And so being able to design specific materials,

1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:57.580
 being able to move past a lot of the barriers

1:52:57.580 --> 1:52:59.660
 that seem to limit our progress with things

1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:03.080
 such as miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general

1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:07.060
 is a lot of it is matter based, is material based

1:53:07.060 --> 1:53:11.020
 and our ability to not manipulate,

1:53:11.020 --> 1:53:13.460
 we can only discover materials in a sense.

1:53:13.460 --> 1:53:15.540
 And so I think that a complete mastery

1:53:15.540 --> 1:53:18.540
 of physical reality would be one of the key traits

1:53:18.540 --> 1:53:21.140
 of a very intelligent species.

1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:22.960
 Well, you're actually working on some,

1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:23.940
 maybe you can correct me,

1:53:23.940 --> 1:53:26.020
 but sort of quantum mechanical simulation

1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:28.000
 to understand materials.

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:31.260
 So is that, do you see sort of the early steps

1:53:31.260 --> 1:53:33.780
 that we're doing at quantum computing side

1:53:33.780 --> 1:53:37.180
 to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials,

1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:39.820
 but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials

1:53:39.820 --> 1:53:43.460
 at the very low level that aliens will be able to do

1:53:43.460 --> 1:53:46.500
 and hopefully humans will be able to do soon?

1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:48.300
 Yeah, I think that's, you know,

1:53:48.300 --> 1:53:52.260
 so if we think about how, what materials are made of,

1:53:52.260 --> 1:53:53.860
 it's just a collection of atoms,

1:53:53.860 --> 1:53:55.580
 but each one of those atoms has a lot of data

1:53:55.580 --> 1:53:56.420
 associated with it.

1:53:56.420 --> 1:53:57.840
 So if we wanna kind of calculate

1:53:57.840 --> 1:53:59.900
 how they interact with each other,

1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:02.460
 it requires a massive amount of computational resources,

1:54:02.460 --> 1:54:04.620
 so much so that it can't be done in a lot of cases

1:54:04.620 --> 1:54:06.140
 with classical computers.

1:54:06.140 --> 1:54:09.100
 And that's where quantum computers come in.

1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:10.860
 Although we don't have a perfectly functioning

1:54:10.860 --> 1:54:13.100
 quantum computer at this point,

1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:14.620
 one of the things that we're working at

1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:16.740
 at quantum general materials is to essentially

1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:19.620
 bridge that gap between what a classical computer can do

1:54:19.620 --> 1:54:21.460
 as far as simulating materials.

1:54:21.460 --> 1:54:23.720
 And of course, what a fully functioning quantum computer

1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:26.380
 would mean for being able to design materials.

1:54:26.380 --> 1:54:29.860
 And so, you know, having the ability to study matter

1:54:29.860 --> 1:54:31.140
 at a very fundamental level

1:54:31.140 --> 1:54:32.940
 and unleashing artificial intelligence

1:54:32.940 --> 1:54:35.500
 to machine learning on that problem,

1:54:35.500 --> 1:54:37.820
 I think is, you know, in a sense, you know,

1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:40.800
 alien in a way that we're able to advance our science

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.740
 using, you know, a process that we may not fully understand

1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:47.220
 with perhaps a non human based intelligence in some sense.

1:54:47.220 --> 1:54:50.260
 And so we may find patterns in the processes, right?

1:54:50.260 --> 1:54:52.380
 How does our machine learning output, you know,

1:54:52.380 --> 1:54:56.020
 can we match behaviors with what we're observing

1:54:56.020 --> 1:54:58.040
 with what may be a machine learning algorithm with output,

1:54:58.040 --> 1:54:58.880
 right?

1:54:58.880 --> 1:54:59.820
 Can we try to classify the intelligence

1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:01.140
 in that manner, perhaps?

1:55:02.140 --> 1:55:03.380
 And so, you know, at GenMatt,

1:55:03.380 --> 1:55:05.280
 as we're looking at these materials,

1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:06.820
 we're considering what these algorithms

1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:09.120
 could have used for later on.

1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.720
 Could we perhaps reverse the process

1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:14.040
 and determine what a unique or anomalous material,

1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:16.760
 what type of properties it potentially could have?

1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:19.440
 And you said GenMatt, right?

1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:20.340
 Mm hmm.

1:55:20.340 --> 1:55:22.580
 What's, what is GenMatt?

1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:24.500
 GenMatt is a quantum general material.

1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:27.080
 So it's the company I work for.

1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:31.680
 We essentially are working on a couple of verticals.

1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:33.940
 One of them is our quantum chemistry work.

1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:35.800
 We're essentially, we're bridging the gap

1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:38.200
 between essentially physics and chemistry.

1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:41.360
 We're working on those problems and again,

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.280
 implementing artificial intelligence machine learning

1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:45.620
 into that process so that we can design those materials

1:55:45.620 --> 1:55:47.040
 from the ground up.

1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:50.520
 Additionally, we are what we consider

1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:52.560
 a vertically integrated material science company,

1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:55.320
 which means we can generate our own data.

1:55:55.320 --> 1:55:59.520
 And so within the next quarter coming up,

1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:02.520
 we are launching a satellite in the space.

1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:05.160
 They'll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor

1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:08.220
 in there, which is intended to be the first launch

1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:11.940
 that will help us detect different types of materials

1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:16.020
 using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry, right?

1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:17.440
 We're gonna be leveraging that experience

1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:19.600
 in order to better analyze that data.

1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:20.440
 Oh, interesting.

1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:25.440
 So materials that are strange or novel out there in space.

1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:28.520
 Not necessarily, but we'll be looking back at Earth

1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:30.880
 to be able to detect mineral deposits on Earth.

1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:31.840
 Got it, got it.

1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.360
 Getting the greater perspective from out in space

1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.400
 to do analysis of different materials.

1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:37.400
 Interesting.

1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:40.200
 Yeah, I was really impressed by the DeepMind.

1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:41.760
 I got to hang out with DeepMind recently

1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:43.400
 and they really impressed me

1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:45.640
 with the possibility of the application,

1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:47.440
 as you were saying, of machine learning

1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:50.440
 in the context of quantum mechanical simulation

1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:53.500
 for materials, so to understand materials.

1:56:53.500 --> 1:56:56.340
 It's really, really, really interesting.

1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:59.840
 So manipulate matter, huh?

1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:02.240
 I would say the next thing is horses, right?

1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:03.080
 Or maybe fields.

1:57:03.080 --> 1:57:07.560
 So manipulating or managing gravity.

1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:12.280
 Can we maneuver within fields in some manner

1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:16.040
 that allows us to perhaps move propellant less

1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:17.000
 or in other manners, right?

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:21.200
 And so I think essentially having a deeper understanding

1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:25.160
 of different fields and being able to interact with them,

1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:29.680
 I think would be a potential avenue for travel

1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:31.200
 or advanced travel, right?

1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:32.540
 Propellant less travel.

1:57:33.420 --> 1:57:36.280
 Can we quantum entangle gravity fields together

1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:39.120
 and propel a ship by the gravity field of a planet,

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:41.400
 the mass of a planet, and a drive on a ship?

1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:44.600
 You know, there's all sorts of interesting things, but.

1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:46.840
 Yeah, people will look back at people like you

1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:49.360
 and say, well, they used to fly,

1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:51.320
 like with this kind of propellant,

1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:54.160
 it seems like to be a very antiquated way of flying,

1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:55.760
 and they were very impressed with themselves,

1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:58.620
 these humans, that they could fly like birds.

1:57:58.620 --> 1:58:02.880
 It's like so much energy is used to fly

1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:05.200
 such short distances from that perspective.

1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:07.280
 We can only throw so many rocks out the back.

1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:08.360
 There needs to be a better way.

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:09.200
 Exactly.

1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:10.960
 It just seems dumb, like these.

1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:14.640
 It's like Flintstones or something like that.

1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:16.440
 We're good at it, but there's a limit, right?

1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:18.160
 Like we need to be good.

1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.840
 I mean, that's an interesting sort of trade off.

1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:24.780
 How much do you invest in getting really good at it?

1:58:24.780 --> 1:58:29.780
 I tend to believe the reason why it would be very important

1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:32.120
 and very powerful to put a human on Mars

1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:35.540
 is not necessarily for the exploration facet,

1:58:35.540 --> 1:58:39.380
 but in all the different technologies that come from that.

1:58:39.380 --> 1:58:42.480
 So there's something about putting humans

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.240
 in extreme conditions where we figure out

1:58:45.240 --> 1:58:48.280
 how to make it less extreme, more comfortable.

1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:51.560
 And for that, we invent things,

1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:55.360
 like the DOD sort of helping invent the internet

1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:58.040
 and all the different technologies we've invented.

1:58:58.040 --> 1:59:00.040
 It's almost like an indirect consequence

1:59:00.040 --> 1:59:01.840
 of solving difficult problems,

1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:05.160
 whether that problem means winning wars

1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:07.320
 or colonizing other planets.

1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:10.460
 And so I don't think Mars will help us figure out

1:59:10.460 --> 1:59:13.520
 propulsion systems or to crack open physics

1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:16.200
 to where you can travel close to the speed of light

1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:17.800
 or faster than the speed of light,

1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:19.800
 but it will help us figure out

1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:23.240
 how to build some cool technology here on Earth, I think.

1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:27.020
 So I'm a big proponent of doing really difficult things,

1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:28.600
 really difficult engineering things

1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:32.680
 to see what kind of technologies emerge from that.

1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:34.800
 But let me ask you this.

1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:39.600
 Do you think US government is hiding some technology

1:59:39.600 --> 1:59:44.340
 like alien spacecraft technology?

1:59:44.340 --> 1:59:47.200
 I have no information either way.

1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:49.080
 And if you did, you probably wouldn't tell me.

1:59:49.080 --> 1:59:52.640
 But my assumptions, like what did my heart tell me?

1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:54.760
 My heart tells me something's going on,

1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:56.700
 but I have no evidence for that.

1:59:56.700 --> 1:59:58.600
 Maybe that's me wanting something to go on.

1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:01.640
 Maybe that's a human feeling to want to know

2:00:01.640 --> 2:00:03.000
 that my government's in control

2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.340
 of what some strange unknown thing is.

2:00:05.340 --> 2:00:09.700
 What's your sense if such a thing happened?

2:00:09.700 --> 2:00:12.780
 Would this kind of information leak?

2:00:12.780 --> 2:00:15.660
 Would this kind of information be released by the government?

2:00:15.660 --> 2:00:16.940
 I mean, that's the worry that you have

2:00:16.940 --> 2:00:18.820
 is because when you don't understand a thing

2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:20.700
 and it's novel, you want to hide it

2:00:20.700 --> 2:00:25.080
 so that some kind of enemy doesn't get access to it

2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.280
 and use it against you.

2:00:27.220 --> 2:00:29.820
 I wonder if that is the underlying assumption.

2:00:29.820 --> 2:00:31.580
 It's the one people always jump to,

2:00:31.580 --> 2:00:35.220
 that it's for to maintain secrecy of technology.

2:00:35.220 --> 2:00:36.660
 And I assume that's part of it.

2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:38.020
 I wonder if there's any other reasons

2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:40.420
 that we would want to not talk about it.

2:00:40.420 --> 2:00:43.380
 I imagine that such information would have a shock

2:00:43.380 --> 2:00:46.700
 to the social economic system of any country,

2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:48.100
 if not the world.

2:00:48.100 --> 2:00:50.220
 And so I wonder if perhaps that was part

2:00:50.220 --> 2:00:53.760
 of the concern as well, how society can react to it.

2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:56.000
 Maybe we're anti fragile enough now

2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:57.780
 with everything that's going on

2:00:57.780 --> 2:00:59.820
 and with our communication networks that,

2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:02.740
 why not now?

2:01:02.740 --> 2:01:03.560
 I don't know.

2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:06.140
 That's something I think about as well.

2:01:07.140 --> 2:01:12.140
 Yeah, the effect on the mass psyche of something like this,

2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:16.720
 that there's another intelligence out there.

2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:22.100
 We had trouble enough to deal with a pandemic,

2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:25.180
 to have something of this scale,

2:01:27.300 --> 2:01:30.860
 basically having just an inkling of a phenomena

2:01:30.860 --> 2:01:32.500
 that we have no understanding of

2:01:32.500 --> 2:01:34.300
 and could lead to complete destruction

2:01:34.300 --> 2:01:38.000
 of human civilization or a flourishing of it.

2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:39.860
 And what do you do?

2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:42.980
 What does a bureaucracy of government do with that?

2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:45.660
 Especially when they're the ones holding the range of power

2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:48.460
 and such a communication would relinquish that power

2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:50.220
 essentially, to some degree.

2:01:52.300 --> 2:01:55.140
 Since you think there's aliens out there

2:01:55.140 --> 2:02:02.140
 and you're somebody that's thought about war quite a bit,

2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:05.320
 do you think alien civilizations,

2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:07.240
 when we meet them, would want war?

2:02:08.340 --> 2:02:10.560
 Would they be a danger to us?

2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:12.160
 Would they be a friend to us?

2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:16.960
 What's your intuition about intelligences out there?

2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:21.040
 My intuition tells me that when two people like yourself

2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:23.480
 or myself or anyone get together,

2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:26.880
 often the output is greater than the individuals.

2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:28.400
 And when we work together,

2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:31.320
 we can typically do things that are more impressive

2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:33.760
 and better than if a single person works alone.

2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:40.680
 And now I know that war has driven technological progress,

2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:46.320
 but perhaps there's other mechanisms that can do so.

2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:50.360
 But regardless, I wonder if we truly think

2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:53.680
 about an advanced society that has been perhaps thousands

2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:55.920
 or millions of years ahead of us,

2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:59.560
 I would imagine that same truth to be there,

2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:02.720
 that people working together or creatures working together

2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:07.720
 is a good thing for society or its society as a whole.

2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:09.760
 And if we consider that,

2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:14.360
 as we imagine a society growing and expanding,

2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:16.960
 in a sense, the ultimate output of a planet

2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:18.600
 could only be achieved in some senses

2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:21.040
 if everyone was working towards the same goal.

2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:24.720
 And there might be wonders and secrets and things

2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:27.280
 that we can't imagine just simply because of the timeframes

2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:30.280
 that we live under and we think in.

2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:33.520
 But if a planet has a single unit

2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:36.400
 and it almost is as an entity itself at a certain level,

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:38.720
 if everything's working towards the same output,

2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:40.920
 I could almost imagine an intelligent species

2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:43.320
 that approached us planet to planet

2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:44.720
 instead of person to person,

2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:46.000
 because that's how they've evolved

2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:47.760
 and they've assumed any intelligent species

2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:51.080
 would understand that working together is better than not.

2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:55.480
 And so my heart tells me that at a certain point,

2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:00.280
 love and caring and the desire to work together

2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:03.880
 is much more powerful than the technological progress

2:04:03.880 --> 2:04:04.880
 that war would bring.

2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:08.000
 I hope so as well.

2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.120
 Well, let me jump to the AI topic that you've done.

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.080
 So you've done research and development efforts

2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:14.900
 focused on multiagent intelligence

2:04:14.900 --> 2:04:16.880
 for collaborative autonomy,

2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:18.440
 machine learning AI stuff

2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:21.400
 that we've been talking about for combat,

2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:23.080
 for air to air combat,

2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:24.880
 manned, unmanned teaming technologies,

2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:26.440
 all that kind of stuff.

2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:28.480
 What's some interesting ideas in this space

2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:30.240
 that fascinate you?

2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:34.560
 Randomness, being able to not predict

2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:36.840
 what the enemy is doing almost no matter what,

2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.120
 because there's a level of randomness

2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:40.720
 that's within the tactical envelope.

2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:42.360
 Even if utility of randomness.

2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.880
 The utility of randomness in an increasing.

2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:46.240
 Sounds like a book you should write.

2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:49.240
 That would be a good title.

2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:50.440
 Name my band.

2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:51.520
 Name your band?

2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:52.360
 Yeah.

2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:55.320
 So yeah, can you elaborate that?

2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:57.560
 So like trying to deeper understand

2:04:57.560 --> 2:05:02.280
 how you can integrate randomness through AI

2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:03.920
 in the context of combat.

2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:06.160
 In order to make yourself,

2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:07.920
 in order to take away the enemy's ability

2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:09.800
 to try to predict what you're gonna do

2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:12.640
 to disrupt their technological progress cycles

2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:16.120
 so that they don't have a clear target to aim at.

2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:17.720
 And if you don't have a clear target to aim at,

2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:18.880
 it's hard to hit it.

2:05:18.880 --> 2:05:23.280
 Additionally, more distribution of assets and capability.

2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:26.120
 So imagine being able to digitally model

2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:28.120
 your weapon or your system

2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:31.080
 or your entire tactical engagement or scenario,

2:05:31.080 --> 2:05:32.400
 or allow a machine learning

2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:35.280
 to help you better understand the technology

2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:36.120
 that you need to build

2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:38.760
 in order to defeat a particular scenario.

2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:41.720
 And I'm talking hardware now, not just the tactic itself.

2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:46.520
 And being able to use large amounts of simulation

2:05:46.520 --> 2:05:49.200
 and machine learning to build individual assets

2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:52.960
 that are small boutique using advanced manufacturing

2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:56.080
 techniques for a mission or for a particular battle.

2:05:56.080 --> 2:05:58.240
 Instead of just having these large things against an enemy,

2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:02.080
 you're building systems and technology for individual cases.

2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:05.960
 What about manned and unmanned teaming?

2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:08.960
 So man and machine working together.

2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:10.680
 Is there interesting ideas there?

2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:13.440
 I approach it from the position

2:06:13.440 --> 2:06:17.960
 that the human should be commanding

2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:19.480
 from the highest level possible, right?

2:06:19.480 --> 2:06:23.160
 So mission, objective, base, targeting.

2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:25.440
 And so if, just for an example,

2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:27.640
 if there's a building here and I want that building

2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:29.720
 to go away, that's the message I wanna communicate.

2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:31.400
 I don't wanna tell certain vehicles

2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:32.360
 to be in a certain spot.

2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:33.920
 I don't wanna know how much fuel they have.

2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:34.760
 I don't even wanna know

2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:36.520
 what capabilities they have necessarily.

2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:39.400
 I just wanna know that I have the ability

2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:41.720
 to select from a cloud of capabilities

2:06:41.720 --> 2:06:43.560
 and the right assets are gonna arrive

2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:46.240
 such that they deal with the contingencies

2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:49.320
 around the target such as protection systems or EW

2:06:49.320 --> 2:06:50.880
 and then can prosecute the target

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:53.440
 to the high enough probability of satisfaction

2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:54.640
 that's needed by the mission commander.

2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:57.160
 And that's the power of the human mind

2:06:57.160 --> 2:07:00.560
 is it's able to do some of these strategic calculations

2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:03.600
 but also ethical calculations, all that kind of stuff.

2:07:03.600 --> 2:07:05.280
 That's what humans are good at.

2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:10.280
 Does it worry you a future where we have increasingly

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:14.400
 higher autonomy in our weapons systems, in our war?

2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:15.600
 So you said building.

2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:21.560
 What about telling a set of fully autonomous drones

2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:26.560
 to get rid of all the terrorists in the city?

2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:29.800
 So you said multiple buildings, region,

2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:34.080
 that kind of, so greater and greater autonomy.

2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:35.160
 Mm hmm.

2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:36.920
 So that's a fear, right?

2:07:38.720 --> 2:07:41.440
 You're viewing it from a we can cover more perspective

2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:46.440
 which is fair and a lot of,

2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:48.480
 I don't approach it from that topic.

2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:51.200
 At least I don't think of it that way, at least morally.

2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:54.200
 I think that with the advancement of warfare,

2:07:54.200 --> 2:07:57.960
 assuming we have a just and moral leadership,

2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:02.240
 if that's the case, then I am an advocate

2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:04.600
 for increased autonomy and technology

2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:09.040
 because I see it as an ability to be more precise.

2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:14.040
 And if we trust the moral leadership of our government,

2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:17.480
 then we would want to be as precise as possible

2:08:17.480 --> 2:08:21.160
 in order to mitigate effects that we don't want.

2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:24.520
 So I know that's not a satisfying answer

2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:27.160
 and it leaves us maybe with bad feelings but.

2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:32.160
 No, because having experienced sort of directly seen

2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:39.920
 what it looks like when deliberately or carelessly

2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:44.480
 war leads to the death of a large number of civilians

2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:46.680
 as it does currently in Ukraine,

2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:52.560
 the value of precision given ethical leadership

2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:54.200
 becomes apparent.

2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:57.320
 So there's something distinctly unethical

2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:00.920
 about the murder of civilians in a time of war.

2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:05.960
 And I think technology helps lessen that.

2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:08.440
 Of course, all death is terrible

2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:13.440
 but there's something about schools, hospitals

2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:17.480
 being destroyed with everybody inside being killed.

2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:21.240
 It's particularly terrible.

2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:24.680
 It is and you approached it from the angle of

2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:29.680
 more autonomy enables a wider swath of destruction.

2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.440
 And that's where we get back into

2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:34.920
 who's making the decisions based off of this.

2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:38.520
 And my hope again would be that we would have the leadership

2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:40.280
 that would use these things when needed

2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:42.920
 in the precise way as possible to minimize that.

2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:45.760
 And I've seen that firsthand, I've seen that in country,

2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:50.760
 I've seen not blue forces but I've seen truck bombs go off

2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:54.560
 on school buses, driving around Afghanistan

2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:59.720
 while escorting convoys and it wasn't easy then

2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:01.800
 and I'm sure it's not any easier now

2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:03.880
 especially after what you've just seen.

2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:07.200
 Do you have thoughts about the current war in Ukraine

2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:09.600
 maybe from a military perspective,

2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:11.360
 maybe from the Air Force perspective?

2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:13.800
 So I can just mention a few things.

2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:17.880
 There's the Barakhtar drones that are being used.

2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:19.000
 They're unmanned.

2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.560
 I think they have capability to be autonomous

2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:23.880
 but they're usually remotely controlled.

2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:26.640
 They're used for reconnaissance but they're also used

2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:28.560
 by the Ukraine side for reconnaissance

2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:33.440
 and I think also to destroy different technologies,

2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:36.200
 tanks and so on, different targets like this.

2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:40.040
 So there's also on the Russian side the Orlan 10.

2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:44.440
 There's the fighter jets, MiG 29 on the Ukraine side

2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:46.440
 and the Su 25 on the Russian side.

2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.120
 Is there anything kind of stands out to you

2:10:48.120 --> 2:10:51.640
 about this particular aspects of what this war looks like

2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:53.680
 that's unique to what you've experienced?

2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.800
 Maybe not unique but it's just been absolutely incredible

2:10:56.800 --> 2:10:59.440
 to see the footage.

2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:02.760
 We're watching war on Twitter essentially

2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:06.200
 and to see these aircraft flying down low,

2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:08.960
 spitting flares out, getting shot down,

2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:12.360
 it's incredible to see this happening live

2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:13.480
 for everyone to see.

2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:16.200
 So that's just kind of a quick meta comment

2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:18.560
 but as far as the actual,

2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.720
 I think these small form factor UAVs

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.880
 where they're just like strapping weapon to it

2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:25.320
 and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time

2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:29.040
 or any of these type of commercial applications

2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:31.920
 of technology into this ad hoc warfare area

2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.160
 is incredibly interesting

2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:36.480
 because it shows how useful that technology can be

2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:38.800
 outside of the military.

2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:40.000
 Especially like DJI, right?

2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:41.720
 Like there's obviously a lot of technology in there

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:43.680
 is being leveraged for other capabilities

2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:47.800
 within PLC military or at least we would assume.

2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:52.160
 What happens if that is more widespread, right?

2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:54.560
 Like what if we were creating our own drones

2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:56.080
 and they were being used against us?

2:11:56.080 --> 2:11:57.720
 Would we want to have some type of kill switch

2:11:57.720 --> 2:11:58.800
 or something like that, right?

2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:01.520
 So what I think governments are gonna have to consider

2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:04.480
 like all these tools that are gonna be easily available

2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:08.000
 to just any person could be turned into a tool of war

2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.520
 or how do we stop that from being turned against us?

2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:12.960
 Especially as we look at 10 years from now

2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:15.520
 when we have a large number of autonomous UAVs

2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:17.640
 delivering packages and doing everything else

2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:19.560
 over our country and any one of those

2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:20.800
 could be potentially a weapon

2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:22.520
 if we don't have the proper security.

2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:27.080
 Well, we're now in Texas and Texas values its guns

2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:30.200
 and it sees guns as among other things

2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:33.520
 a protector of individual freedom.

2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:35.520
 You could see a future perhaps where,

2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:38.560
 and I've certainly have experienced this in

2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:41.480
 the empowering nature of this in Ukraine

2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:45.960
 where you can put the fight for independence

2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:50.160
 into your own hands by literally strapping explosives

2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:54.280
 to GGI drones that you purchase on your own salary.

2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:55.600
 I mean that one of the interesting things

2:12:55.600 --> 2:12:58.280
 about the voluntary army in Ukraine

2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:01.120
 is that they're basically using their own salary

2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:04.200
 to buy the ammunition to fight for their independence.

2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:07.920
 It's the very kind of ideal that sort of people speak about

2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:11.920
 when they speak about the Second Amendment in this country

2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:15.960
 that it's interesting to see

2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:18.920
 the advanced technology version of that,

2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:19.960
 especially in Ukraine.

2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:22.760
 Sort of using computer vision technology

2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:25.800
 for surveillance and reconnaissance

2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:29.440
 to try to integrate that information

2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:32.800
 to discover the targets and all that kind of stuff.

2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:35.400
 To put that in the hands of civilians

2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:36.480
 is fascinating to see.

2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:38.600
 So to sort of fight for their independence,

2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:43.600
 you could say that to fight against authoritarian regime

2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:45.360
 of your own government, all that kind of stuff.

2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:47.840
 It shows you how complicated the war space in the future

2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:50.440
 is gonna be invading a land like that

2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:53.440
 where people have that many different types of resources.

2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:55.760
 It could absolutely change warfare.

2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.760
 I mean hopefully that creates a disincentive to start war.

2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:04.440
 To go to war with a, yeah,

2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:07.080
 sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare.

2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:08.360
 It does, yeah.

2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:11.520
 I don't think Putin was expecting to be in that engagement

2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:14.080
 quite as long as he has, of course,

2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:16.520
 but it can show you how you can get caught up.

2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:21.520
 If land wars turn into an inescapable quagmire each time

2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:26.560
 due to the complications around the society's ability

2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:28.760
 to access interesting tools,

2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:33.760
 it could be a huge demotivator for aggression.

2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.600
 Well, let me ask you about this.

2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.160
 Do you think there will always be war in the world?

2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:45.480
 Is this just a part of human nature?

2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:51.520
 I think so.

2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:53.600
 I think it is.

2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.080
 Until we move past resource limitation,

2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:00.920
 there's always gonna be at least

2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.960
 that one particular cause of conflict.

2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:09.240
 And then we can also consider all our psychological

2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:14.920
 lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out,

2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:18.800
 although hopefully we have enough things in place

2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:22.160
 to stop that from rising to the level of war.

2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:24.080
 But we have our own biology, our own psychology

2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:25.480
 and evolution to combat.

2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:28.280
 But there are pragmatic reasons

2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:30.360
 to exert violence sometimes, unfortunately,

2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:33.480
 and one of those cases could be resource limitations.

2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:34.720
 And so your question was,

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:37.080
 do I think there will always be war in this world?

2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:39.480
 My unfortunate answer is perhaps yes,

2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:41.600
 but once there's more than one world

2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:43.040
 and we're less resource constrained,

2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:45.720
 then perhaps there'll be a valve of sorts for that.

2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:51.680
 I talked to Jacco on this podcast.

2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:55.520
 I told him about a song called Brothers in Arms

2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.680
 by Dire Straits, and the question I asked him,

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.440
 I'd like to ask you the same question,

2:16:01.440 --> 2:16:06.280
 is like the song goes, do you think we're fools

2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:09.200
 to wage war on our brothers in arms?

2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:14.160
 And Jacco said, our enemy is not our brothers in arms,

2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:15.200
 they're the enemy.

2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:21.200
 And so this kind of notion that we're all human,

2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.120
 that's a notion, that's a luxury you can have,

2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:29.600
 but there is good and bad in this world, according to Jacco.

2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:34.600
 I hear that anger and hate when I was in Ukraine

2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:39.880
 amongst some people, where there was a sense

2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:42.400
 where you could be brothers and sisters,

2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:44.280
 you can have family, you can have love

2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:50.160
 from Ukraine to Russia, but now that everything's changed

2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.880
 and generational hate for some people have taken over.

2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:59.200
 So I guess the question is, when you think about the enemy,

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:02.280
 is there hate there?

2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:04.400
 Do you acknowledge that they're human?

2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:06.560
 I had never had any hate or discontent

2:17:07.560 --> 2:17:10.280
 when I was doing my job, I'll say,

2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:14.640
 but I was also never in a true life or death situation

2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:17.280
 where they were gonna kill me if I didn't kill them.

2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:21.280
 But I think that environment isn't one born out of hate,

2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:24.040
 being in that type of scenario,

2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:26.200
 in a sense it's how to be alive, right?

2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:28.720
 I mean, our natural state is to be fighting

2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:30.680
 for our survival in a sense.

2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:33.920
 And so I think there's great power and strength

2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:36.920
 and clarity perhaps in that, and it's not always born out

2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:38.960
 of hate, but out of necessity,

2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:41.120
 and we can't always control that.

2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:45.400
 And I think as we focus on ourselves so much,

2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:48.720
 we only dance on that pinhead when we find ourselves

2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:50.880
 fighting for things that we need,

2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:53.720
 and we're always taking from someone else at this point.

2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:56.480
 And so as someone that's been in combat

2:17:56.480 --> 2:17:58.560
 and very high above it, I'll say, right,

2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:01.120
 where I didn't feel like I was in particular danger,

2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:06.720
 I rationalized it and I made my way through it,

2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:08.520
 knowing that there were people on the other side

2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:12.320
 that were going to die that were on our side than not.

2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:15.680
 So it was always a very human thing.

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:20.680
 It was never a reaction, emotional reaction of any sense.

2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:26.400
 So you were able to see the basic, it's human versus human.

2:18:27.840 --> 2:18:31.080
 There's some aspect of war that is basically

2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:34.560
 one people fighting each other.

2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:40.960
 Yes, at the end of the day, especially I would say

2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:44.320
 in aviation, tactical aviation, there's almost a kinship

2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:48.240
 with your enemies in a sense, because you know them

2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:51.440
 in a sense, right, you know what they've been through,

2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:52.680
 you know what training they've been through,

2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:55.480
 you know where they failed, and you know what type

2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:57.360
 of person they are, because it's a very unique person

2:18:57.360 --> 2:18:59.720
 that does that job and usually can spot them.

2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:02.320
 I guess it's the kind of respect you have

2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:06.720
 for the craftsmanship of the job that's taken on.

2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:08.520
 Certainly, and that person didn't come out

2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:12.000
 in his $100 million jet because I pissed him off.

2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:13.760
 It's not an emotional response.

2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:17.760
 We're both there, maybe because we chose to be in some sense,

2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:20.600
 but at the behest of someone else

2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:22.800
 and outside of our control and power.

2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:25.760
 And so in a sense for me, it's almost a challenge

2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:27.920
 that we've engaged upon agreeably,

2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:30.680
 but that's such a romantic version that I have the luxury

2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:34.040
 to have being high in my castle in the jet up there,

2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:35.360
 not on the ground.

2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:37.440
 So I understand that it's a bit more romantic

2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:40.920
 than perhaps, you know, someone on the ground

2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:42.840
 experiencing all the horrors down there,

2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:45.200
 because everything looks very small from above.

2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:50.160
 And that's another aspect of war with greater autonomy

2:19:50.160 --> 2:19:52.440
 when you're controlling the mission versus,

2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:58.520
 you know, have a Genghis Khan type of intimacy

2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:01.680
 in terms of the actual experience of war

2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:05.260
 where you directly have, you murder with a sword

2:20:05.260 --> 2:20:09.480
 versus a gun versus a remotely controlled drone

2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:12.080
 versus a strategic mission assignment

2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:14.920
 to an autonomous drone that executes.

2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:17.580
 Abstracted away until it's just a small decision.

2:20:18.480 --> 2:20:23.240
 And my worry is the people without a voice

2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:29.160
 are completely forgotten and silenced

2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:31.040
 in all of these calculations.

2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:36.040
 I spoke to a lot of people, poor people that feel like

2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:37.760
 they've never really had a voice

2:20:37.760 --> 2:20:40.280
 and they're too easily forgotten,

2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:42.520
 even within the country of Ukraine.

2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:47.520
 It's the big city versus the rural divide, you know.

2:20:48.440 --> 2:20:49.840
 It's easy to forget the people

2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:52.360
 that don't have a Twitter account

2:20:52.360 --> 2:20:57.120
 and that their basic existence is just trying to survive,

2:20:57.120 --> 2:20:58.520
 trying to put food on the table

2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:02.660
 and they don't have anything else, anything else.

2:21:02.660 --> 2:21:06.160
 And they are the ones that truly feel the pain of war,

2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:08.320
 of the supply chain going down,

2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:10.120
 of the food supplies going down,

2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:12.940
 of a cold winter without power.

2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.080
 You're still young, but you've seen some things.

2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:22.640
 So let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat

2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:25.860
 and give advice to young people,

2:21:25.860 --> 2:21:29.220
 whether they're fascinated by technology

2:21:29.220 --> 2:21:31.860
 or fascinated by fighter jets,

2:21:31.860 --> 2:21:35.260
 whether they're fascinated by sort of engineering

2:21:35.260 --> 2:21:38.100
 or the way the stars look at night.

2:21:38.100 --> 2:21:40.140
 What advice would you give them?

2:21:40.140 --> 2:21:42.120
 How to have a career they can be proud of

2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.220
 or how to have a life they can be proud of?

2:21:45.460 --> 2:21:49.820
 I'd suggest that they don't fear looking foolish.

2:21:49.820 --> 2:21:52.260
 I spent a large portion of my life

2:21:52.260 --> 2:21:56.880
 considering the laughter or the comments

2:21:56.880 --> 2:21:59.760
 at my statements as indication

2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:02.000
 that I shouldn't pursue that.

2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:05.880
 And so I kind of woke up to that fact a bit later,

2:22:05.880 --> 2:22:10.880
 but I would advise that people trust in themselves

2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:12.920
 and trust in the things that they care about.

2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:15.560
 It doesn't matter if they're good at it.

2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:17.440
 All that matters is that they find something

2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:20.400
 that they can apply love and care to

2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.240
 and they will grow better at it

2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:25.080
 and then most likely make the world better because of it.

2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:27.400
 And don't be afraid to look stupid.

2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:30.000
 Don't be afraid to look stupid.

2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:31.480
 Yeah, that's one of the things that I think

2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:34.880
 as you get older, you're expected to be,

2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:36.000
 to have it all figured out

2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:39.160
 and so you are afraid to take on new things.

2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:40.800
 But I think as long as you're always,

2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:43.400
 okay, looking stupid and having a beginner's mind,

2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:47.000
 you can get really, really far even later on in life.

2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:48.760
 So this isn't just advice for young people.

2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:52.520
 This is really advice for everybody.

2:22:55.200 --> 2:22:56.640
 Maybe a dark question,

2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:01.520
 but has there been a difficult time in your life,

2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:03.760
 a really dark place you've gone in your mind

2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:07.280
 that stands out that you had to really overcome?

2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:13.020
 I would suggest that I've been pretty firm ground

2:23:13.020 --> 2:23:14.120
 for most of my life.

2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:18.400
 I haven't had too many personal tragedies.

2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:21.640
 I'll say that have really defined me.

2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:25.800
 Certainly none that I would think are outside the norm.

2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:29.040
 So there was no truly low point.

2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:30.680
 Actually, I have one and it's tough for me

2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:33.920
 because I've spent most of my life beating motions

2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:38.680
 and high emotional responses out of my system

2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:40.060
 because that's what flying is, right?

2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:43.420
 It's keeping a steady line and doing what you need to do.

2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:45.200
 In fact, there's been studies

2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:49.480
 that show reduced adrenaline production in fighter pilots

2:23:49.480 --> 2:23:50.760
 for a number of years after they get out.

2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:54.400
 But getting out of the Navy was difficult for me.

2:23:54.400 --> 2:23:56.120
 And I wasn't expecting it to be.

2:23:56.120 --> 2:23:59.520
 A lot of bravado and machoism, of course, in the military,

2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:01.360
 especially in fighter community.

2:24:01.360 --> 2:24:03.640
 And we all have our plans made up to get out

2:24:03.640 --> 2:24:06.280
 and none of it really accounts

2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:08.960
 for any type of mental health or anything like that.

2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:11.600
 It's all very much, where am I gonna get my paycheck from?

2:24:11.600 --> 2:24:12.680
 Where am I gonna move to?

2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:16.400
 And whether it's the Navy or just individuals,

2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:18.320
 truly understanding the difference that makes.

2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:21.060
 And when I got out, it was difficult for me.

2:24:21.060 --> 2:24:23.160
 I think a lot of guys in that job, when they get out,

2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:26.280
 they almost, at least I had anxiety when I got out

2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:29.920
 because I was so used to being highly involved

2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:34.920
 in something that just was I was always involved with

2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:36.240
 that when I got out,

2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:38.640
 I didn't know how to fill that space essentially.

2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:41.840
 And while I wouldn't say it was an overly

2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:43.320
 traumatic experience, I think it's one

2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:45.160
 that's not accounted for enough

2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:46.880
 that people that are getting out,

2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:49.140
 so I would encourage them to take it serious

2:24:49.140 --> 2:24:51.680
 and actually think about it and respect the change

2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:53.480
 because it is a big one.

2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:58.480
 Well, if I may say, you found a place in nature currently,

2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:01.920
 a home, is there, can you speak to that

2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:04.040
 being a source of happiness for you?

2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:04.880
 Absolutely.

2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:06.220
 An escape from the world?

2:25:06.220 --> 2:25:08.040
 Certainly, it very much is.

2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:10.240
 Was it deliberate that you found it there?

2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:12.120
 That's home for me.

2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:14.920
 So, I moved back up to the Boston area

2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:18.440
 and my wife and I had an idea after moving

2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:20.280
 about eight or nine times in the Navy

2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:23.560
 of kind of what we wanted just generally.

2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:25.760
 And it was all really about the land

2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:26.920
 and not about the house,

2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:29.480
 we just wanted privacy and to be nearby.

2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:31.920
 And so we ended up finding a lot of land,

2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:34.160
 a parcel of land, we put a house on it

2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:36.520
 and it provides me with a sense of peace

2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:40.200
 that I think I can only get when I'm in nature.

2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.040
 And a sense of clarity that helps me think,

2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:45.500
 helps me relax, maybe it's so relaxing

2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:46.640
 that helps me think, I don't know.

2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:50.600
 But being surrounded by nature and birds and animals

2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:54.600
 for me has always allowed me to,

2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:55.840
 I don't know, feel most in touch

2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:59.320
 with my own thoughts in a sense.

2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:01.240
 It just provides clarity.

2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.600
 And so this little sanctuary you could say I've built

2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:08.920
 allows me to interface via a fiber line at my house

2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:12.400
 but also feel like I'm a million miles away sometimes,

2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:13.840
 which is the best of both worlds.

2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:16.240
 A, you can just walk outside to escape at all.

2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:17.080
 Yes.

2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:21.440
 To experience life as hundreds of generations

2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:23.480
 of human species have experienced it.

2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:26.560
 Maybe it's the dichotomy, my desire for the fastness

2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:28.940
 of technology and experience compared

2:26:28.940 --> 2:26:31.340
 with the most basic baseline that we have.

2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:33.120
 Isn't that strange?

2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:34.920
 How do you square that?

2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:36.120
 I don't know.

2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:38.120
 How drawn you are to the cutting edge

2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.400
 and still the calm you find in nature.

2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.520
 I think it makes sense.

2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:45.680
 Nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology.

2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:46.520
 From a technology perspective?

2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:48.120
 Yeah, it is.

2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:49.640
 And so in a way, it's being surrounded

2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:51.280
 by perfection in a lot of senses.

2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.160
 In the military and in general,

2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:57.240
 have you contemplated your mortality?

2:26:57.240 --> 2:26:59.320
 Have you been afraid of death?

2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:01.320
 What's your relationship like with death?

2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:06.160
 Well, I was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk,

2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:08.600
 I'll say, when I was younger as an aviator.

2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:10.840
 Not in the jet, but just that was my life.

2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:13.600
 I felt like I was gonna live forever.

2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:15.760
 And going out in the war, strangely,

2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:19.280
 didn't really change that because as an aviator,

2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:21.160
 again, we're riding up high on our horse up there.

2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:25.720
 So there were times when I was in situations

2:27:25.720 --> 2:27:28.280
 that could have resulted in death from flying

2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:31.440
 or from emergency in the aircraft.

2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:35.960
 But I'll be honest, I never really kind of sat down

2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:39.360
 to think about the mortality of it afterwards.

2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:41.960
 I feel like I kind of signed a check at the beginning

2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:44.280
 and it was my job to perform as well as I could.

2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:46.040
 And if something happened in that,

2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:47.680
 then I better damn well be sure

2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:49.440
 I would do my best at the time then.

2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:53.720
 So I maybe didn't personally reflect on it

2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:57.280
 as much as I one would think,

2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:58.840
 because once you get in that machine,

2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:00.760
 it doesn't give you a lot of time

2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:05.000
 to sit back and philosophize on your current situation.

2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:06.840
 And the same, just like we weren't seeing these,

2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:08.560
 or when we seen these objects off the coast,

2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:10.840
 we weren't necessarily examining them every day, right?

2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:11.920
 We'd put them into that bucket

2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:12.800
 because it wasn't something

2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:14.840
 that was gonna kill us right away.

2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:17.800
 And thinking about death when you're so close to it

2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:19.600
 all the time would be debilitating.

2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:22.520
 It would probably make you worse at your job.

2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:23.360
 It would.

2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:26.760
 Well, maybe you can think about death

2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:28.360
 when you look out, when you go out into nature

2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:32.880
 and think like the fact that this whole ride ends,

2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.640
 it's such a weird thing.

2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:37.840
 And the old makes way to new.

2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:39.280
 And that's all throughout nature.

2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:42.120
 And if you just look at the cruelty of nature

2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:44.120
 or the beauty of nature, however you think about it,

2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:47.720
 the fact that the big thing eats the little thing

2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:53.480
 over and over, and that's just how it progresses.

2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:55.720
 And that's how adaptation happens.

2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:59.520
 Death is a requirement for evolution.

2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:02.600
 And whether evolution allows us

2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.640
 to see objective reality or not,

2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:06.620
 it still gives you some interesting thoughts

2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:08.400
 about perspectives of death,

2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:11.760
 and especially considering it's a biological necessity

2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:13.800
 as far as evolution is concerned.

2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:14.640
 Yeah, it's weird.

2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:18.560
 It's weird that there's been like 100 billion people

2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:20.520
 that lived before us,

2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:22.160
 and that you and I will be forgotten.

2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:24.720
 This whole thing we're doing now is meaningless

2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:26.880
 in that sense, but at the same time,

2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:28.720
 it feels deeply meaningful somehow.

2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:32.920
 I guess that's the question I wanna ask.

2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:36.040
 When you go out to nature with family,

2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:38.760
 what do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:40.100
 What's the meaning of life?

2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:44.400
 Or maybe when you put on the night goggles,

2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:47.180
 the night vision goggles and look up at the stars,

2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:49.360
 why are we here?

2:29:50.560 --> 2:29:51.920
 I can't speak for everyone,

2:29:51.920 --> 2:29:55.640
 but at least the way I interpret it,

2:29:55.640 --> 2:29:58.600
 or at least I feel like I interpret my way here,

2:29:58.600 --> 2:30:02.320
 my job is, I feel like my role is just to be curious

2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:04.680
 about the environment in a manner that allows us

2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:07.080
 to understand as much as possible.

2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:09.680
 I think that the human mind,

2:30:09.680 --> 2:30:12.440
 whether it's just the mass inside our skull,

2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:15.760
 or whether there's some type of quantum interactions

2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:18.960
 going on, our mind has incredible ability

2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:23.160
 to output new information in a universe

2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:27.080
 that is somewhat stale of information, right?

2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:30.960
 Our minds are somewhat unique in that we can imagine

2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:33.280
 and perceive things that could never ever

2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:35.240
 have possibly naturally occurred,

2:30:35.240 --> 2:30:36.340
 and yet we can make it happen.

2:30:36.340 --> 2:30:38.960
 We can instantiate that with enough belief

2:30:38.960 --> 2:30:40.920
 that it's true and it can happen.

2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:44.480
 And so for me, I feel like I just need to encourage that,

2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:47.480
 to encourage interaction with reality

2:30:47.480 --> 2:30:50.800
 such that it leaves us a newer and grander interactions

2:30:50.800 --> 2:30:52.600
 with this universe.

2:30:52.600 --> 2:30:55.440
 And all that starts with a little bit of curiosity.

2:30:55.440 --> 2:30:57.080
 Exactly.

2:30:57.080 --> 2:30:59.020
 Ryan, you're an incredible person.

2:30:59.020 --> 2:31:00.280
 You've done so many things,

2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:03.480
 and there's so much still ahead of you.

2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:07.120
 Thank you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs

2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:09.160
 and doing it so seriously,

2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:10.640
 and thank you for pushing forward

2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:12.820
 on all these fronts in terms of technology.

2:31:12.820 --> 2:31:17.680
 So from just the fighter jets, the engineering of that,

2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:21.040
 to the AIML applications in the combat setting,

2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:24.400
 that's super interesting, and then now quantum.

2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:26.560
 I can't wait to see what you do next.

2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:28.320
 Thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.

2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:29.140
 It was an honor.

2:31:29.140 --> 2:31:29.980
 It was my pleasure.

2:31:29.980 --> 2:31:31.320
 Thank you, Lex.

2:31:31.320 --> 2:31:33.040
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:34.880
 with Lieutenant Ryan Graves.

2:31:34.880 --> 2:31:36.280

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Buzz Aldrin.

2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:47.200
 Bravery comes along as a gradual accumulation of discipline.

2:31:47.200 --> 2:32:08.200
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
