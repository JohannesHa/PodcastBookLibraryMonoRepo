00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
 The following is a conversation with Commander David Fravor, who was a Navy pilot for 18 years

00:05.700 --> 00:12.060
 and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41, also known as the Black Aces, a squadron

00:12.060 --> 00:15.420
 of 12 airplanes consisting of several hundred people.

00:15.420 --> 00:23.660
 He's also famously one of the people who with his own eyes saw and chased a UFO, an

00:23.660 --> 00:30.840
 identified flying object in 2004 that is referred to as the Tic Tac and the incident more formally

00:30.840 --> 00:35.200
 referred to as the USS Nimitz UFO incident.

00:35.200 --> 00:40.800
 His story, corroborated by several other pilots from my perspective as a curious scientist

00:40.800 --> 00:47.280
 and an open minded human being, is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history, at

00:47.280 --> 00:49.440
 least that I'm aware of.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.520
 He's a humble, fascinating, and fun human being to talk to.

00:53.520 --> 00:58.320
 I put out a call for questions on Reddit and many other places and tried to ask as many

00:58.320 --> 01:01.160
 of the questions that people posted as I could.

01:01.160 --> 01:06.440
 And overall, I really enjoyed this conversation and I'm sure if the world wants us to, and

01:06.440 --> 01:10.880
 if there's more questions to be had, we'll talk on this podcast again.

01:10.880 --> 01:16.160

01:21.720 --> 01:27.840
 As a side note, let me say that the world of UFOs and UAPs, unidentified aerial phenomena,

01:27.840 --> 01:33.280
 and aliens in general is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy

01:33.280 --> 01:36.760
 theorists to actual hard evidence.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.640
 I'm a scientist first and foremost, but an open minded one, often looking and thinking

01:41.640 --> 01:43.000
 outside the box.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.680
 I'm often disheartened by the closed mindedness of the scientific community.

01:47.680 --> 01:52.920
 And in equal part, I'm disheartened by the lack of rigor and basic scientific inquiry

01:52.920 --> 01:56.760
 and study on the part of the conspiracy theorists.

01:56.760 --> 02:02.040
 I believe there's a line somewhere between the two extremes that more inquisitive minds

02:02.040 --> 02:03.800
 should walk.

02:03.800 --> 02:09.080
 I think we humans know very little about our world, what's up there among the stars and

02:09.080 --> 02:14.240
 the nature of reality and the nature of our very own minds.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.640
 The path to understanding can only be walked humbly.

02:17.640 --> 02:22.880
 The very idea that there is a possibility that David witnessed a piece of technology,

02:22.880 --> 02:28.140
 whether human made or alien made, that moved in the way it did, should be inspiring to

02:28.140 --> 02:31.220
 every scientist and engineer on this earth.

02:31.220 --> 02:35.880
 There may be propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered that, once understood

02:35.880 --> 02:41.280
 and mastered, will put distant galaxies within reach of us human beings.

02:41.280 --> 02:47.400
 Paradigm shifts in science and leaps in understanding can only happen, I think, if we open our eyes

02:47.400 --> 02:52.920
 and allow ourselves to dream, to think from first principles, and remove the constraints

02:52.920 --> 02:59.480
 and innovation placed on us by the scientific conventions and assumptions of prior generations.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
 and performance.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.800
 I drink it every day to make sure I'm not missing any of the nutrition I need.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.640
 Now let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting.

03:45.640 --> 03:51.720
 I fast often, sometimes intermittent fasting of 16 hours and then an 8 hour eating period

03:51.720 --> 03:57.080
 of 2 meals, sometimes 24 hours, that's one dinner to the next.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.640
 I've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people I look up to

04:01.640 --> 04:03.040
 have done.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.080
 People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and the different health benefits,

04:07.080 --> 04:11.460
 it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of life.

04:11.460 --> 04:16.800
 Not eating somehow is a reminder that we're immortal, that every day is precious.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.840
 I certainly experienced this with the 24 hour fast and I think it goes even deeper for the

04:21.840 --> 04:25.760
 48, 72, and even week long fasts.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.920
 Anyway, I always break my fast with Athletic Greens, it's delicious, refreshing, just makes

04:30.920 --> 04:31.920
 me feel good.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.880
 You probably know there's a show called The Office that I fell in love with, first with

04:56.880 --> 05:02.400
 the British version with Ricky Gervais and then the American version with Steve Carell.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.360
 ExpressVPN lets you pretend your location is somewhere else, choosing from nearly 100

05:07.360 --> 05:11.320
 different countries and then watch one of the nine totally different other versions

05:11.320 --> 05:14.360
 of The Office in other countries.

05:14.360 --> 05:19.560
 Also it protects you when you do shady things on the internet that you shouldn't be doing.

05:19.560 --> 05:24.280
 Like checking the website of this very podcast that for some reason was not available in

05:24.280 --> 05:29.860
 Russia for a long time, not sure if it still is, but if it isn't you can use ExpressVPN

05:29.860 --> 05:31.000
 to access it.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.280
 I think of ExpressVPN like a pirate ship, and regular VPN free life as a boring cruise

05:37.280 --> 05:41.120
 from one place to another with no excitement in between.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.320

05:56.360 --> 06:00.800
 Like you would try to spell if you were on a deserted island and trying to get an airplane

06:00.800 --> 06:02.120
 to notice you.

 under 48 hours you can communicate by text anytime and schedule weekly audio and video

06:13.840 --> 06:14.840
 sessions.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.840
 Now, hard left turn, let me talk about desert islands.

06:18.840 --> 06:23.040
 Whatever you think of it, I love the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks and the idea of spending

06:23.040 --> 06:27.120
 time on an island, alone, with potentially no hope.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.640
 The natural question is, if I could, what would I bring to this island?

06:31.640 --> 06:36.080
 The answer is complicated, but let me pick one thing, the first thing that popped into

06:36.080 --> 06:41.920
 my crazy mind which is the Introduction to Algorithms book, also called CLRS for the

06:41.920 --> 06:44.840
 first letters of the last name of its four authors.

06:44.840 --> 06:50.480
 I find algorithms beautiful, like a little toolbox for a simple world inside computers

06:50.480 --> 06:55.080
 when the real world outside is an impossible chaotic mess.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.720
 I would love pondering the puzzles in that book for months, far away from human civilization.

06:59.720 --> 07:06.240

07:06.240 --> 07:07.920
 this podcast.

07:07.920 --> 07:13.840
 And now, finally, here's my conversation with David Fravor.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.480
 You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.880
 Yeah, I am.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.400
 Better known as Top Gun.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
 Yeah.

07:21.400 --> 07:26.280
 Let me ask the most ridiculous question, how realistic is the movie Top Gun?

07:26.280 --> 07:31.400
 So it's funny, we used to joke, and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun instructor said

07:31.400 --> 07:36.400
 this, there's two things in the original Top Gun that are true, that are very realistic.

07:36.400 --> 07:43.240
 One, there is a place called Top Gun, and number two is they do fly airplanes there.

07:43.240 --> 07:50.720
 Other than that, I went through in 97, class 497, and there's actually a log of every single

07:50.720 --> 07:53.960
 person that's went through, kind of like a SEAL training.

07:53.960 --> 07:54.960
 There's a list.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.600
 Because there's a lot of posers out there, oh, I was a Navy SEAL.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
 No, you weren't.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
 Well, I went to Top Gun.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.240
 You can actually go to Top Gun, and matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch, the

08:03.240 --> 08:07.080
 real patch, you have to have gone there.

08:07.080 --> 08:11.560
 So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.200
 The real ones are controlled.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.200
 The people that make them honor that.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.920
 And when you go in, they look up your name.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.360
 If you want to get one, they look up your name.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.200
 You just tell them, they go, okay, here, and they'll sell them to you.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.720
 If you are not on the list, you ain't get no patch.

08:24.720 --> 08:31.380
 Because it is, it's a pretty big deal to go through, but for me, probably one of the best

08:31.380 --> 08:36.240
 experiences of flying, because everyone there is extremely competent.

08:36.240 --> 08:41.600
 It's very, very challenging, but it's what we all signed up to do.

08:41.600 --> 08:49.520
 So it's, it's just the entire group that is, when you want to be that, you know, that level,

08:49.520 --> 08:53.280
 you know, where you go, everyone really cares, and everyone really wants to be good.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.280
 Is it competitive?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.000
 Like, what was it, in the movie?

08:56.000 --> 09:00.640
 No, it's, when you go through, it's, you know, it's, if anything, it's more of the

09:00.640 --> 09:04.520
 students, you know, and then there's the instructor side, then the instructor sides are really,

09:04.520 --> 09:09.120
 you know, they're guys that, you know, they just chose to stay up in Fallon.

09:09.120 --> 09:15.480
 And it's extremely difficult job, because they have, they have a very small tolerance

09:15.480 --> 09:20.420
 for not being good.

09:20.420 --> 09:24.360
 So they're briefs, the guys when they give a lecture, so let's just say there's a fighter

09:24.360 --> 09:26.200
 employment lecture, which is one of the hardest ones.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.040
 It takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.560
 The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple, what they call them murder boards,

09:33.560 --> 09:37.420
 where he's scrutinized by his peers, and he practices, by the time they actually stand

09:37.420 --> 09:43.600
 in front of a class, they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized, and

09:43.600 --> 09:46.760
 they don't even turn around, they just click and they know them in order.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.760
 And they repeat the same thing over, it's, and it's standardized.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.760
 So they are extremely, extremely standardized when you go through the school, and there's

09:53.760 --> 09:58.000
 a reason for that, because what they're doing is they're training, so when you come out

09:58.000 --> 10:01.560
 of Top Gun, you're called a Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics Instructor, okay?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.940
 So you're SFTI.

10:03.940 --> 10:07.480
 When you come out of that, your job is to go usually to one of the weapons schools on

10:07.480 --> 10:11.560
 the East or West Coast and train the fleet squadrons, and then you visit the squadrons

10:11.560 --> 10:13.480
 and train and do upgrade rides and all that.

10:13.480 --> 10:19.440
 So there's a, there's a reason that they are extremely particular when you go through the

10:19.440 --> 10:20.440
 course.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.800
 It's, it is literally one of the best things, and it's not, it's not a rank based thing,

10:23.800 --> 10:30.480
 just think, oh, Navy, you can come in as a, you know, like an 04 Lieutenant Commander.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.440
 The lieutenants, the hierarchy, or at least to be, I don't know how it is exactly today,

10:34.440 --> 10:36.280
 but I imagine it's the same.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.460
 The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school, not necessarily rank.

10:40.460 --> 10:45.920
 So when the tactical decisions are made, which are based on fact and trying things out in

10:45.920 --> 10:52.520
 the Fallon Ranges, they set the top X number of folks that have been there seniority wise,

10:52.520 --> 10:56.440
 and I mean time wise, are the ones that actually make the decision.

10:56.440 --> 11:01.240
 And when the door, you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out

11:01.240 --> 11:05.000
 from the staff, they all speak the same language.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.680
 It's and it has to be that way, which is why the school has been so effective since it

11:09.680 --> 11:11.120
 was founded.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.120
 So it's just a, it's an incredible group of individuals.

11:14.120 --> 11:19.720
 So there's a bar of excellence that, that the instructors demand.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.760
 Oh, very much so, and they're held to it.

11:22.760 --> 11:26.440
 So it's not a, hey, I'm now an instructor, so I can do what I want.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.960
 There is a standard and they have to live up to that standard.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.720
 They have to, and I mean every moment of every day.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.260
 So if they go someplace, if they go from Fallon and they come down and do, they're called

11:37.260 --> 11:40.200
 site visits where they come down and they'll come to Lemoore, California, which is where

11:40.200 --> 11:42.780
 the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy.

11:42.780 --> 11:47.880
 And they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on

11:47.880 --> 11:51.000
 some of that knowledge, that's that same high level of standard.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.200
 It's they can't just drop your guard because you wear the Top Gun patch.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
 And people know that.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
 And they wear light blue shirts.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.240
 So it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.800
 And you know, and then everyone else who's been through the school, including them, have

12:02.800 --> 12:04.060
 the patch on their sleeve.

12:04.060 --> 12:07.060
 So there's a standard that's expected when you come out of there.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.160
 So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.160
 Yes.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.720
 Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?

12:15.720 --> 12:16.720
 Yeah.

12:16.720 --> 12:21.200
 So, you know, first I was in, I was enlisted, I was a Marine.

12:21.200 --> 12:27.580
 And then the Marines actually sent me, recommended me to go to the Naval Academy.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.220
 So it's always better to be lucky than good.

12:29.220 --> 12:33.280
 But I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished and I've had that dream to fly.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
 So when I got selected,

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
 You've always dreamed of flying.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
 Yeah.

12:37.280 --> 12:41.200
 Since 1969, when I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.

12:41.200 --> 12:46.680
 I was at that point, I asked my mom, I remember watching it, I was just prior to being five.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.960
 And I said, wow, yeah, it's so cool, mom.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.400
 And she said, well, you know, they were all pilots.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.480
 And then at that point it was like, I'm going to be a pilot.

12:56.480 --> 13:01.200
 And if you knew me growing up, cause I was a little bit of a delinquent, people are just

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
 like, yeah, right.

13:02.200 --> 13:07.120
 I used to joke, I'm going to fly, I'm going to fly jets, I'm going to drop bombs.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.080
 And if people that knew me as a kid, they'd be like, yeah, and they'd be like, ah, not

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
 a chance.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.800
 And then when I did, I actually had a, it's a funny story and I'll get to it, I'll finish

13:15.800 --> 13:16.800
 my career.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.280
 But I was at my cousin's wedding and we all grew up in the same neighborhood.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.680
 We kind of, they had Italian side of the family.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.680
 That's how we grew up.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.680
 So it was my house right down the street.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.680
 It was my cousin, Chad.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.320
 And then right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts and uncles and stuff.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.280
 The guy two doors down from my house, the paper boy in the neighborhood, so they all

13:34.280 --> 13:35.280
 knew me.

13:35.280 --> 13:40.600
 And I went to my cousin's wedding and Mr. Race looks at me and he says, David Fravor.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.480
 I go, Mr. Race, how you doing?

13:42.480 --> 13:44.800
 He goes, you fly jets, Top Gun and all that.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.800
 I go, yes, sir.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.600
 He goes, man, I figured you'd be in jail by now.

13:48.600 --> 13:54.040
 And it was kind of a, to me, it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on and I kind

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
 of overcame that.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
 But...

13:56.040 --> 13:57.200
 What do you attribute that to?

13:57.200 --> 14:02.760
 So you, I've heard you before and just now say that it's better to be lucky than good

14:02.760 --> 14:13.040
 and you talk modestly about just being lucky, but if you were to describe your trajectory

14:13.040 --> 14:21.160
 maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively, how'd you pull it off to be like, to be truly

14:21.160 --> 14:23.120
 a special person?

14:23.120 --> 14:26.680
 The easiest way is one, never, never take no.

14:26.680 --> 14:30.160
 Don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it or those.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.780
 I mean, I knew, I knew what I was capable of inside, you know, and if I really believe

14:34.780 --> 14:39.500
 if you want something and you want to do something, then you can achieve it.

14:39.500 --> 14:45.080
 Not in all cases, like if I loved basketball and I really wanted to be in the NBA, there's

14:45.080 --> 14:49.200
 a realism that says I'm five foot eight and I got like a really short vertical leap and

14:49.200 --> 14:51.680
 I'm really not that good at basketball, it's probably not ever going to happen no matter

14:51.680 --> 14:53.440
 how hard I try and practice.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.440
 It's just the way it is.

14:54.440 --> 15:02.000
 Or for me to be in the NFL, I'm not fast, you know, I'm not that big, it's just physically

15:02.000 --> 15:04.640
 I'm incapable of doing that.

15:04.640 --> 15:09.160
 But there's things that don't really tie to a true physical ability as far as size and

15:09.160 --> 15:15.040
 strength, but it's, it's mental and I'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
 to be a fighter pilot.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.420
 Matter of fact, you don't.

15:17.420 --> 15:23.480
 It really comes down to the ability to think very quickly, 80% solution is typically good

15:23.480 --> 15:28.240
 enough because if you overthink it, you're, you're behind and then in an air to air fight,

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
 that's what happens.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.840
 People try and overthink it and before you know it, because it's happening so fast, you

15:32.840 --> 15:37.560
 don't have, you can't get to the nth degree, you know, six decimal places, 80% solution

15:37.560 --> 15:38.560
 is good enough.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.680
 You have a really strong gut for the 80% solution, just yeah, I'm a big believer in the 80% solution.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.680
 I love that.

15:43.680 --> 15:48.280
 If you get 80% you can go and then you can always adjust, which is exactly what, like

15:48.280 --> 15:52.600
 if you're fighting in BFM, the 80% solution is it's like a chess game, but it's a really,

15:52.600 --> 15:58.040
 really fast chess game where you go, I'm doing this and then I know that if I do a maneuver,

15:58.040 --> 16:03.120
 if he's going to counter it correctly, he should do a, if he doesn't do a, he does some

16:03.120 --> 16:09.860
 degree less like BCD and then I know how bad his, his error is and then I capitalize.

16:09.860 --> 16:12.800
 So my mind, I don't have to be perfect, you know, I don't have to go, I need to go to

16:12.800 --> 16:14.560
 47 degrees, nose high.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.120
 If I just kind of get above 40, then I'm good and I can watch how it reacts and then I can

16:18.120 --> 16:19.120
 adjust for that.

16:19.120 --> 16:24.420
 And you, and you continually work that problem and you chip away because if you start neutral,

16:24.420 --> 16:29.280
 you're just basically chipping away and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage till eventually,

16:29.280 --> 16:33.040
 you know, and if you're really, you know, fighting, you know, just guns only rear quarter

16:33.040 --> 16:38.120
 where you got to get behind the guy, kind of world war II dog fight and type stuff.

16:38.120 --> 16:43.880
 Then it's, it's literally, it's a, it's a very, very fast chess game that happens at,

16:43.880 --> 16:46.320
 you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends.

16:46.320 --> 16:53.160
 So to get to be one of the rare individuals that are able to do that, he just had the

16:53.160 --> 16:56.040
 dream and didn't take no for an answer.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
 Yeah.

16:57.040 --> 17:02.840
 Well, you know, you know, part of it is family, you know, my dad was, I used to call him a

17:02.840 --> 17:07.680
 fire ready aim guy, you know, he'd smack me and then asked me what I did wrong.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.680
 Yeah.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.680
 Good parenting.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.440
 Um, back then, you know, I, I joke and people look, cause you know, at times it was kind

17:13.440 --> 17:17.440
 of tough, you know, cause he can be pretty demanding, but on the other side, you know,

17:17.440 --> 17:20.320
 I probably needed to be reined in a little bit at times.

17:20.320 --> 17:24.240
 Uh, but then everyone else in my family, you know, my mom was really awesome when I was

17:24.240 --> 17:25.240
 a kid.

17:25.240 --> 17:29.700
 Uh, my, uh, my grandfather who is a big, big part of it.

17:29.700 --> 17:35.560
 My mom's dad, uh, who he taught me a lot and you have a question there that we'll talk

17:35.560 --> 17:39.480
 about, uh, about him, but, uh, huge, huge influence.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.480
 Very, very positive.

17:40.480 --> 17:45.720
 And a lot of the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught

17:45.720 --> 17:46.720
 me.

17:46.720 --> 17:51.320
 Um, and, uh, you know, and I figured, you know, it was the first funeral I ever went

17:51.320 --> 17:57.160
 to and it was, uh, it was about three miles long and church was overfilling and people

17:57.160 --> 17:58.160
 were out.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.240
 It was a big guy, dead serious.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.520
 And you go, there's someone asked who died the Pope.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.440
 Um, uh, so, so a lot of people love them.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.600
 So back to, back to my career question, cause I'm getting down at rabbit hole.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.080
 Uh, no, I, when I was at the, I was going to, I was going to stay in the Marines.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.600
 I really wanted to go, man.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
 I love the core.

18:15.600 --> 18:20.440
 I think it's, uh, of all services, it's that one, everything is in a ball and they're very,

18:20.440 --> 18:24.400
 very professional and it was a great, great organization to join.

18:24.400 --> 18:30.120
 Uh, but I went out to the Nimitz on my, uh, freshman cruise after your freshman year at

18:30.120 --> 18:33.080
 the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you, you're an enlisted person.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.640
 You get to experience that half when I already was enlisted.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.640
 So it was fine with me.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
 Because it comes up a lot.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.320
 You mind saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is, what like, yeah.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.640
 So Nimitz is, uh, an aircraft carrier.

18:43.640 --> 18:48.200
 So it's, uh, four and a half acres of sovereign us territory that floats around the us oceans

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
 giant thing.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.840
 Does it have weapons on it?

18:50.840 --> 18:52.780
 Uh, the air wing is really the weapons.

18:52.780 --> 18:58.040
 It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part it's a giant moving airport is what

18:58.040 --> 18:59.040
 it is.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.760
 So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off.

19:01.760 --> 19:06.040
 Um, and I'm like, Oh, and the squadrons that were out there, one of the squadrons was a

19:06.040 --> 19:12.480
 VF 41 and a 14 squadron, VF 84, uh, an F 14 squadron and then a couple of a six squadrons.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.800
 And we actually ended up part pairing up and hanging out with some of the a six pilots

19:15.800 --> 19:16.800
 and BNs.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
 So it was really a neat experience.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.800
 And I said, I want to do that.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.160
 And the way to do it was to not, to, to go in the Navy because there are Marine squadrons

19:25.160 --> 19:28.680
 that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to

19:28.680 --> 19:29.680
 support the Marines.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.580
 Cause there are that, that unit, that whole unit, you know, the Marine Corps is that one

19:33.580 --> 19:35.480
 surface has it all.

19:35.480 --> 19:41.480
 And, um, so when I graduated and I got to, uh, you know, I, I worked hard through primary

19:41.480 --> 19:45.720
 and that's where, you know, I knew Missy, uh, we were in, actually went through together,

19:45.720 --> 19:50.120
 Missy Cummings, uh, we went through primary together and then, uh, I went to Kingsville.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.200
 We all selected the same time.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.200
 I went to Kingsville.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.600
 There was another guy, Scott Weidemeyer, uh, the three of us.

19:55.600 --> 20:00.160
 So I went to Kingsville, Scott went to Beeville and Missy went to Meridian.

20:00.160 --> 20:04.120
 So the three of us that we had all went through, we got, we selected out of primary together.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.160
 We all ended up going jets and that's, that's how, besides from school, I knew her at school

20:08.160 --> 20:09.160
 too.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
 The long story.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.160
 I got done, uh, got winged.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.600
 It took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got

20:14.600 --> 20:21.440
 my wings and, uh, through some luck, uh, I ended up getting A6s, uh, on the West coast,

20:21.440 --> 20:23.360
 which is a side by side, uh, bomber.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.320
 So it's a pilot on the left seat and the Bombardier navigators on the right seat.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.320
 It was built in the sixties.

20:28.320 --> 20:33.200
 It is all weather, uh, and it flies low at night and it's got a terrain mapping radar.

20:33.200 --> 20:38.900
 How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jets as a broad category for,

20:38.900 --> 20:39.900
 for the public?

20:39.900 --> 20:40.900
 Yeah, that's fine.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.360
 How many fighter jets are side by side like that?

20:43.360 --> 20:47.960
 That was, uh, in the Navy, that was the only one, uh, the Air Force, the F111 was a side

20:47.960 --> 20:52.560
 by side, but the Navy, it was the A6 and then there's the EA6B, which is a derivative of

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
 that.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.560
 And now that those are all gone, the EA6B is just went away a few years ago.

20:56.560 --> 21:01.880
 And now the, uh, E18G Growler, um, is the replacement for the A6B.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.960
 There was never a replacement for the A6, uh, that I flew.

21:04.960 --> 21:10.400
 It really became the F18, which, uh, the A6 could go quite a bit further distance wise

21:10.400 --> 21:16.040
 by fuel, uh, then the Hornet and, uh, the Hornet is the F18.

21:16.040 --> 21:21.120
 Is there usually two people in the plane, but they're usually like in front and behind?

21:21.120 --> 21:22.840
 In a, the modern two seaters, yes.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.320
 Uh, but most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.980
 Single seat, just one person?

21:27.980 --> 21:32.400
 One person, with the exception of, I'll probably, someone will yell at me, but really with the

21:32.400 --> 21:37.880
 exception of the F15E Strike Eagle and the F18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two

21:37.880 --> 21:42.440
 seater and the G is also a two seater, but it's more of an electronic attack by say full

21:42.440 --> 21:44.400
 up fighter bomber.

21:44.400 --> 21:51.560
 So most of the time that you've flown in your, like I said, 18 year career is, was it two

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
 seater?

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
 That was about half and half.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.940
 So I started off in A6 was a two seater.

21:55.940 --> 22:03.400
 Then I went to single seat F18s and I flew those, uh, all the way up until 2000 and let

22:03.400 --> 22:07.800
 me think 2001 to the end of 2001.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.120
 And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets and I've flown both of those,

22:11.120 --> 22:16.720
 the E's and the S, but I deployed when I had command of VFA 41, I had the two seat, they

22:16.720 --> 22:18.040
 were F squadron.

22:18.040 --> 22:25.920
 So you eventually ended up commanding the, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.920
 I love the, the name, the Black Aces.

22:28.920 --> 22:35.560
 What, uh, is there some parts of that journey that are amazing, parts of it that are tough

22:35.560 --> 22:37.000
 that kind of stand out?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.640
 To me, it was one, it was a huge honor.

22:39.640 --> 22:44.880
 Uh, and I got to serve with, uh, you know, I got pulled up because the, the guy, the,

22:44.880 --> 22:47.840
 the people that are exos, cause we fleet up, you go from the number two guy to the number

22:47.840 --> 22:49.000
 one guy.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.400
 So the XO becomes the CEO.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.200
 So the executive officer becomes the commanding officer.

22:53.200 --> 23:00.400
 So I had worked with, uh, now soon to be vice Admiral Weitzel, uh, was the, he was commander

23:00.400 --> 23:04.840
 Weitzel at the time was the XO and he really wanted, because he knew there was a little

23:04.840 --> 23:10.400
 bit of a problem when the Super Hornets came into L'more, L'more had been a single seat,

23:10.400 --> 23:16.100
 a fighter community, uh, since the forever.

23:16.100 --> 23:19.860
 And now all of a sudden you've got the F18F coming in, which has the weapon systems operators

23:19.860 --> 23:23.480
 in the back that are not pilots, they're weapon systems operators.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.760
 And there's a difference.

23:24.760 --> 23:31.360
 Um, and Kenny is a weapon systems operator and, uh, Kenny knew because of my A6 background

23:31.360 --> 23:34.880
 that I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat, one seat, two seat.

23:34.880 --> 23:40.080
 Because when you fly two seat, there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take

23:40.080 --> 23:42.680
 the advantage of the weapon systems operator.

23:42.680 --> 23:47.120
 And it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really, there's

23:47.120 --> 23:51.840
 a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and the autonomy that comes for the

23:51.840 --> 23:56.040
 ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.560
 But it does, it does equal more than one.

23:58.560 --> 24:04.680
 I would say that one plus one with two people as well as a minimum of 1.5 because you've

24:04.680 --> 24:09.440
 got an extra head, you've got extra eyes, you've got someone that can monitor systems.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.000
 The airplanes can do two things at once.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.320
 I mean, there's an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that.

24:14.320 --> 24:18.960
 Can we just pause on that just for me, from like a human factors perspective and also

24:18.960 --> 24:26.480
 an AI perspective, what's, how difficult, uh, so there's like when there's two people,

24:26.480 --> 24:33.000
 there's also a third person that's the AI part, the some level of automation like autopilot

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
 maybe.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
 That's correct.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.960
 Maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like, you said making decisions really

24:39.960 --> 24:46.360
 quick, 80%, how do you deal with another brain working with you?

24:46.360 --> 24:52.260
 And then also the automation, is there an interesting interplay that you get to learn?

24:52.260 --> 24:57.240
 And also as that changed throughout your career, I imagine it got, it gotten better in terms

24:57.240 --> 24:59.040
 of the automation or perhaps not?

24:59.040 --> 25:03.320
 Well, I can tell you, so let's, let's start just, no, this is, this is good.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.320
 This is good.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.280
 And this is, I'm enjoying this because now we actually get to talk about something other

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
 than a Tic Tac.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.760
 So, um, so let's start with the A6.

25:10.760 --> 25:15.840
 The A6 was really an analog airplane, uh, that was built in the sixties.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.840
 All right.

25:16.840 --> 25:21.320
 And there's been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction between

25:21.320 --> 25:23.720
 the pilot and the bombardier navigator.

25:23.720 --> 25:26.680
 So we would fly low at night in the mountains.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.960
 So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.160
 So you've got the Cascades and incredible amount of time.

25:33.160 --> 25:37.400
 And we would get in the simulators because unlike normally people think terrain following

25:37.400 --> 25:41.640
 and there's the radars, the 111, the B1 has a system like this, but it'll, the radar can

25:41.640 --> 25:42.640
 see and it'll fly.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.680
 It basically flies a straight line.

25:43.680 --> 25:47.480
 So it goes up and over mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6

25:47.480 --> 25:49.700
 was really manual.

25:49.700 --> 25:52.360
 So you do this low level routes where you're going to, you're going to fly in the mountains

25:52.360 --> 25:53.360
 at night.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.920
 You're going to be at, you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground, ripping through

25:56.920 --> 26:00.600
 like fog layers, cause you don't need to see outside.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.080
 You're literally flying a little TV screen and radar.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.320
 What are you looking at most of the time?

26:04.320 --> 26:05.640
 So you're just at a screen.

26:05.640 --> 26:08.160
 It's this really primitive.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.360
 If you look at it now, what we did, you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really

26:11.360 --> 26:12.360
 fun.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.120
 So is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?

26:14.120 --> 26:17.760
 Is that, is, no, this thing is totally radar based.

26:17.760 --> 26:22.360
 Now the airplane had a FLIR ball as a target recognition and multi sensor was called a

26:22.360 --> 26:23.360
 tram.

26:23.360 --> 26:27.320
 You're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects.

26:27.320 --> 26:31.440
 No, actually what it is is the, the bomb of your navigator had a radar and he was getting

26:31.440 --> 26:33.680
 raw feed off of a pulse radar in front.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.680
 Okay.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.920
 So it's just basically mapping the mountain.

26:35.920 --> 26:39.840
 So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is

26:39.840 --> 26:41.900
 going to be, it's going to give you a really bright return.

26:41.900 --> 26:45.680
 And then the backside, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on

26:45.680 --> 26:47.740
 the other side.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.800
 So the Bombardier navigators would do that and we, they would have charts and they could

26:50.800 --> 26:53.880
 shade their charts knowing that, Hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in

26:53.880 --> 26:54.880
 this valley.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.880
 We can sneak up this valley and then go around the backside of the mountain, which is what

26:57.880 --> 26:59.200
 the airplane would do.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.600
 And so, and sorry to interrupt, I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize.

27:03.600 --> 27:09.160
 But the pilot, can you, can you at a high level say what the pilot does versus the Bombardier?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.780
 Yes.

27:10.780 --> 27:13.240
 So you're, you're actually just control.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.240
 I'm flying the jet.

27:14.240 --> 27:20.480
 The throttle's the stick and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch or six inch

27:20.480 --> 27:24.560
 wide by maybe four inches, five inches high.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.880
 It looks like it's literally a CRT.

27:26.880 --> 27:27.880
 That's how old it is.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.880
 A CRT screen.

27:28.880 --> 27:33.160
 And what it would do, what the radar would do is the, the, the Bombardier navigator is

27:33.160 --> 27:36.520
 looking at his radar and he's looking out about 12 and a half miles in front of the

27:36.520 --> 27:37.520
 airplane.

27:37.520 --> 27:40.440
 So he has the range really scoped down cause the radar can see a lot further.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.360
 He's looking at about 12 and a half miles when we're in the terrain mode where we're

27:43.360 --> 27:45.280
 dodging mountains and stuff.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.360
 And what the pilot has is there's, they're called range bins and there's eight of them.

27:49.360 --> 27:55.320
 So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile, you know, and the closest range

27:55.320 --> 28:00.600
 bin, it's a thing and it'll be like between like a half a mile and or a quarter mile to

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
 three quarters of a mile.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.680
 And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.300
 And then it just keeps going out like that.

28:06.300 --> 28:10.900
 So if there's a mountain in front, let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain

28:10.900 --> 28:12.720
 out in the distance at 15 miles.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.940
 And we were just driving right at it.

28:14.940 --> 28:18.360
 So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles where the radar is going

28:18.360 --> 28:23.400
 to see it on his scope, my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up and it would show

28:23.400 --> 28:25.640
 like a big bump, like a mountain.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.440
 And then as I got closer to it, the next range bin would pop up and show it.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.320
 And I could see that that bump was moving towards me.

28:32.320 --> 28:36.240
 And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over

28:36.240 --> 28:41.460
 to the right hand side and I could do that, but it wasn't like a video game.

28:41.460 --> 28:44.440
 It's literally like, if you think of the original Atari's.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.440
 Yeah.

28:45.440 --> 28:51.960
 But you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual

28:51.960 --> 28:56.600
 3D environment based on that little Atari's solid display.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
 You're exactly right.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.100
 And you have to, you have to train.

28:59.100 --> 29:03.160
 So there's been studies, as a matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people probably argue

29:03.160 --> 29:04.280
 with me, but it's true.

29:04.280 --> 29:09.160
 There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators, we call it the WIST, the

29:09.160 --> 29:13.680
 systems trainer, and it was not even a motion, it just kind of sat there and you just, you

29:13.680 --> 29:17.680
 could fly these things and they had terrain that they would inject into the system.

29:17.680 --> 29:24.720
 But the crew coordination, so you get, so my first fleet bombardier navigator, who I'll

29:24.720 --> 29:32.760
 name him, his name's Chris Sato, he works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad, I think

29:32.760 --> 29:36.720
 computer engineering, he's scary smart.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.760
 So Chris could really work, as a matter of fact, all the guys I flew with, so there's

29:40.760 --> 29:44.320
 another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP, we did our first night traps

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
 together.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.440
 The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things that you just, you're never going to

29:48.440 --> 29:51.680
 forget, but Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior

29:51.680 --> 29:55.480
 crew in the squadron.

29:55.480 --> 30:01.560
 We'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing at how he could work the system,

30:01.560 --> 30:05.720
 one because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of, oh, we can

30:05.720 --> 30:10.080
 do all these different things and there's all these degradation modes.

30:10.080 --> 30:15.280
 But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get, because, and it's,

30:15.280 --> 30:16.800
 you almost talk in partials.

30:16.800 --> 30:22.800
 So as the BN is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I've got rising terrain,

30:22.800 --> 30:25.640
 that's just what they say, showing rising terrain at 12 miles.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.680
 And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, got it.

30:28.680 --> 30:32.280
 This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads.

30:32.280 --> 30:38.400
 So when you first get together, the interaction, it's almost like you have to rehearse it,

30:38.400 --> 30:42.240
 you have to know, and you talk in full sentences.

30:42.240 --> 30:50.880
 The more and more we fly together, Chris could go, I'm showing and he'd get like rising out

30:50.880 --> 30:53.320
 and before he finished, I'd say, I've got it.

30:53.320 --> 31:00.800
 So you end up starting to talk in partials because I have to trust him like, I mean,

31:00.800 --> 31:05.200
 there can be no, I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally

31:05.200 --> 31:09.240
 looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain

31:09.240 --> 31:10.240
 moving.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.560
 Remember the mountain's here and then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to

31:12.560 --> 31:16.400
 pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up.

31:16.400 --> 31:20.680
 Remember it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all the way

31:20.680 --> 31:25.640
 to the left and he's got a wider scope on the radar, but my screen doesn't show that.

31:25.640 --> 31:30.740
 So he's telling me, start a left turn, start a hard turn, you know, and we would do that.

31:30.740 --> 31:31.740
 So my truck.

31:31.740 --> 31:32.960
 And this is all happening quick?

31:32.960 --> 31:33.960
 Very quick.

31:33.960 --> 31:38.960
 Well, you're doing, we would typically fly between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed.

31:38.960 --> 31:39.960
 How many miles an hour?

31:39.960 --> 31:43.040
 Well, 420 is seven miles a minute.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.040
 Okay.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.560
 Or eight, between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.560
 That's fast.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.560
 At night.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.560
 I mean, I broke out of clouds.

31:49.560 --> 31:54.400
 I mean, I remember him and I flying, we were on, it's the IR, it's called an IR route, an

31:54.400 --> 31:57.320
 instrument route that's low, they're all around the country.

31:57.320 --> 32:01.160
 There's the IR 344 that we used to fly, which would coast in off of Oregon, you'd fly from

32:01.160 --> 32:03.820
 the land, you go out over the ocean, turn around and then you could practice actually

32:03.820 --> 32:10.320
 coming in on a coastline and we were flying and we ended up in the clouds.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.760
 Keep in mind, we're between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.760
 You can't see anything.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.960
 And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called the anti collision

32:17.960 --> 32:23.880
 lights because it was reflecting off the clouds and it starts to bother you, just gets annoying.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.680
 So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying.

32:26.680 --> 32:32.200
 We break out of that coastal marine layer and poof, we break out and it's a decent night.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.640
 And this is right by Mount St. Helens.

32:33.640 --> 32:34.640
 This is kind of where we're coming in.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.240
 So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens is where the

32:37.240 --> 32:38.440
 route goes.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.180
 And you look up, you know, cause you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's

32:41.180 --> 32:42.920
 right next to you, but you're flying along.

32:42.920 --> 32:46.680
 You're just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights,

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
 they're above you.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.080
 We're literally below people's houses flying down these valleys and stuff.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.780
 So just incredible experience.

32:51.780 --> 32:55.500
 So when you take that and then you move into an F18F.

32:55.500 --> 33:01.680
 So now we're into modern technology that was actually built in this century and you're

33:01.680 --> 33:02.680
 flying.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.520
 So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels, but

33:05.520 --> 33:11.720
 that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're

33:11.720 --> 33:13.080
 sharing the load.

33:13.080 --> 33:16.420
 So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the WIZO does all the talk

33:16.420 --> 33:18.600
 and he's got actually, he uses his feet.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.920
 That's the weapon systems operator in the back of an F18F.

33:21.920 --> 33:26.840
 So he's going to run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational

33:26.840 --> 33:29.640
 awareness display and it's linked to all the other airplanes.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.880
 Just out of curiosity, what's the situational awareness display?

33:31.880 --> 33:34.400
 Because that term comes up a lot.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.920
 Think of it as a God's eye view.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.800
 So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has, well, the Block IIs has about an eight

33:39.800 --> 33:43.320
 by 10 display for the WIZOs that they can look at.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.320
 The pilot's is smaller.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.520
 It's down between his, it's a six by six between his legs and they're getting ready to redesign

33:48.520 --> 33:49.560
 that Boeing is.

33:49.560 --> 33:53.640
 But when you looked, it'd be like if you put your airplane and you're looking down.

33:53.640 --> 33:57.000
 So all the stuff, like if your radar seeing bad guys out in front of you, it'd be like

33:57.000 --> 33:58.640
 looking down and going, oh, I'm right here.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.600
 And now there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
 And it shows everything.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.760
 It's just like, it gives you, you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
 everything's at.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.760
 I can see if one guy's trying to target another guy, it shows you all this.

34:10.760 --> 34:18.660
 It's an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain the overall

34:18.660 --> 34:24.880
 picture of what's going on because it's happening so fast and this is where that autonomy piece,

34:24.880 --> 34:26.460
 this is the third brain.

34:26.460 --> 34:29.500
 So we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.600
 It's pulling stuff together going, oh, this is all this guy.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.600
 This is this guy.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
 This is this guy.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
 It's sending it out through the link.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.920
 So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network that we don't

34:37.920 --> 34:38.920
 even see.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.080
 It just says, that airplane says, hey, I'm over here.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.500
 And it tells us and we go, oh, he's right there.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.960
 And then we can go, his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.440
 And it shows us, oh, he's over there and he's looking at this guy.

34:50.440 --> 34:57.160
 I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot,

34:57.160 --> 35:00.440
 but when you look down at stuff, it's, you know, you can sell the picture really quick.

35:00.440 --> 35:07.160
 The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and

35:07.160 --> 35:08.680
 gives you a big picture view.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.680
 What about the control?

35:09.680 --> 35:15.240
 Like, is there, and I apologize as if this is a dumb question, but you know, people use

35:15.240 --> 35:17.560
 the high level term of autopilot.

35:17.560 --> 35:22.720
 How much is there, let's use a loose term of AI.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.160
 How much automation is there?

35:24.160 --> 35:27.560
 How much AI is there in helping you control there?

35:27.560 --> 35:31.600
 The AI piece would be more of a control loop because of the digital flight controls.

35:31.600 --> 35:36.120
 So the airplane actually, they had to make the airplane easier to fly.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.800
 And when I say easy, it's relative because people go, I could do it because I did it

35:38.800 --> 35:40.600
 on flight sim.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.400
 Real life is a lot different.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.240
 In flight sim, you have no apparent fear of death.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.840
 You'll do things on a simulator that you would never do in real life.

35:46.840 --> 35:52.680
 But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage, I mean, because you think about

35:52.680 --> 35:55.760
 it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.120
 You've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.640
 All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got a joint helmet mounted cueing system

36:01.640 --> 36:05.640
 on that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your head's

36:05.640 --> 36:07.000
 at looking.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.800
 So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will actually look to the right.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.320
 The targeting flare will look to the right.

36:11.320 --> 36:15.960
 And oh, by the way, the backseater has a helmet on too, so he can look to the left and he

36:15.960 --> 36:16.960
 can do things.

36:16.960 --> 36:21.600
 So depending on what sensor he's controlling, so if he's got control of the targeting pod

36:21.600 --> 36:25.000
 and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.160
 But if I have something where I want to lock a guy up that I don't see, that maybe the

36:28.160 --> 36:31.600
 radar didn't see, but I can get over and now point the radar, you know, get the, because

36:31.600 --> 36:35.160
 it's a phased array radar now, it doesn't really scan.

36:35.160 --> 36:40.520
 There's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings.

36:40.520 --> 36:44.400
 Because if you just, if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey,

36:44.400 --> 36:47.560
 we're gonna have this helmet and you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head.

36:47.560 --> 36:51.200
 And I don't mean a mechanical setup, but I mean literally you're just gonna map magnetic

36:51.200 --> 36:57.520
 resonance and go, oh, look, and I can literally slew my sensors this fast and then mash a

36:57.520 --> 37:03.240
 button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint, you

37:03.240 --> 37:07.520
 know, a JDAM, which is a joint direct attack munition that is the GPS bombs that you see

37:07.520 --> 37:10.040
 all the time, and then let that thing fly.

37:10.040 --> 37:15.480
 And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes, or, hey, I got it, we're gonna have

37:15.480 --> 37:18.940
 to menstruate coordinates and, you know, you bring back the data and then they do all the

37:18.940 --> 37:22.720
 targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.320
 Now it's that fast.

37:24.320 --> 37:28.580
 So there's a, okay, I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful

37:28.580 --> 37:33.400
 fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane.

37:33.400 --> 37:38.960
 But at a high level, this is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're

37:38.960 --> 37:46.000
 talking about, like me, which is, what is the difference between a human being and an

37:46.000 --> 37:47.320
 AI system?

37:47.320 --> 37:54.000
 Like what can, what is the ceiling of a current AI technology for controlling the plane?

37:54.000 --> 37:57.360
 Like how much does the human contribute?

37:57.360 --> 38:04.240
 Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about

38:04.240 --> 38:12.280
 flying that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot in warfare situations in

38:12.280 --> 38:15.360
 flying a fighter jet plane?

38:15.360 --> 38:20.640
 So I would say AI systems are usually black and white.

38:20.640 --> 38:26.680
 When you write the algorithm for an AI system, it's really, it's basically you're taking

38:26.680 --> 38:30.400
 thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you're doing, right?

38:30.400 --> 38:32.840
 So you've got this logical math problem.

38:32.840 --> 38:36.760
 Math problems are, there's a line that says I can or I can't.

38:36.760 --> 38:42.860
 And it's a very finite line, but you can go up to the line where a human, we all have

38:42.860 --> 38:48.360
 gray areas where we go, eh, maybe, eh, I'll try it.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.120
 So humans can operate within that gray.

38:50.120 --> 38:53.680
 So if you took, if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a while,

38:53.680 --> 38:57.840
 a Super Hornet, it doesn't matter, any airplane, and you go, here is the flight performance

38:57.840 --> 38:58.920
 model of the airplane.

38:58.920 --> 39:04.360
 So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy, so it basically says the airplane

39:04.360 --> 39:08.680
 can fly as slow as this, it can go as fast as this, it can pull this many Gs, force of

39:08.680 --> 39:13.400
 gravity, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then based on the airfoil design

39:13.400 --> 39:18.040
 and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, because it's really

39:18.040 --> 39:19.160
 physics based.

39:19.160 --> 39:23.960
 Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI, but typically AI, you don't want the airplane

39:23.960 --> 39:25.920
 to leave controlled flight, right?

39:25.920 --> 39:29.720
 You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope.

39:29.720 --> 39:34.840
 Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I, where people intentionally

39:34.840 --> 39:39.880
 departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is,

39:39.880 --> 39:42.600
 that's where the human goes, can I do this?

39:42.600 --> 39:46.400
 I know it's outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that.

39:46.400 --> 39:51.800
 So you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes

39:51.800 --> 39:56.320
 with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving.

39:56.320 --> 40:02.320
 So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot

40:02.320 --> 40:05.760
 inside the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that.

40:05.760 --> 40:11.880
 Like it'll flop ends, which defies most logic, and I guess in a way you could probably program

40:11.880 --> 40:18.320
 it, but I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage,

40:18.320 --> 40:23.200
 there are things that a human will do that AI won't.

40:23.200 --> 40:29.400
 And I don't think we've got to the point, because how do you map illogical solutions?

40:29.400 --> 40:30.600
 Most AI is logical.

40:30.600 --> 40:36.120
 It's based on some type of premise when you write the algorithm to control it.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
 There's bounds.

40:37.120 --> 40:41.960
 Yeah, there's this giant mess, like you said, the difference between the simulator and real

40:41.960 --> 40:44.080
 life also gets at that somehow.

40:44.080 --> 40:51.720
 That there is somehow the fear of death, all of that beautiful mess comes into play.

40:51.720 --> 40:59.120
 Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing that plane

40:59.120 --> 41:04.800
 famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions, is there some?

41:04.800 --> 41:08.040
 Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier with the A6.

41:08.040 --> 41:13.240
 So one is when you're flying with a crew, there's standardization.

41:13.240 --> 41:17.120
 So you got to remember when Sully flew, when his first officer, that's the co pilot, showed

41:17.120 --> 41:21.560
 up the first time they'd met, and this happens all the time in the commercial world.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.960
 There's six, 7,000 pilots at United Airlines, your chance of flying with the same guy all

41:25.960 --> 41:26.960
 the time is slim and none.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.280
 Where in the Navy, we were crewed.

41:29.280 --> 41:33.960
 So I had a primary and a secondary whizzo that flew with me.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
 For months?

41:34.960 --> 41:37.880
 Oh yeah, for like all of the deployment.

41:37.880 --> 41:42.000
 Because you want to get to know, trust and all of those things.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.880
 It increases the capability of the airplane.

41:43.880 --> 41:48.360
 It's not to say we can't swap out, but for true effectiveness, especially in very complex

41:48.360 --> 41:53.480
 missions like a forward air controller, we're in the air actually controlling ground assets

41:53.480 --> 41:57.040
 and supporting ground troops.

41:57.040 --> 42:02.480
 If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy, you have to be melded when you

42:02.480 --> 42:03.480
 do that.

42:03.480 --> 42:07.000
 You have to have trained to do that job, otherwise you're going to be ineffective.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.360
 So when you get to the commercial world, and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial,

42:13.360 --> 42:15.120
 there is a standardization.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.440
 Like we know that at this point, I'm going to put this switch, you're going to do that.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.520
 And everyone, they know their roles.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.060
 Captain's going to do this, first officer's going to do this.

42:23.060 --> 42:26.720
 And they know that when the emergency breaks out, so in Sully's case, when they take the

42:26.720 --> 42:30.600
 birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings

42:30.600 --> 42:35.640
 of the two of them talking, you got to remember, they're talking to each other when you hear

42:35.640 --> 42:39.120
 the full tapes, but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York

42:39.120 --> 42:40.560
 area.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.280
 And it's like, we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silence

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
 the alarm.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.280
 They silence the alarm.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.240
 The first officer is pulling out the book, he's going through the procedures while Sully's

42:49.240 --> 42:52.000
 actually flying the airplane, knowing that they've lost their motors.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.920
 And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go into

42:54.920 --> 42:59.120
 an airport in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening, we're going to put this thing.

42:59.120 --> 43:03.120
 And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane

43:03.120 --> 43:05.560
 that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.560
 And he did it flawlessly.

43:06.560 --> 43:10.280
 I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck.

43:10.280 --> 43:14.960
 The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane, and it got fished out of the Hudson.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.400
 What is it about those human decisions you had to make?

43:17.400 --> 43:22.560
 Is that something you put into words or is that just deep down some instinct that you

43:22.560 --> 43:25.000
 develop as a pilot over time?

43:25.000 --> 43:28.660
 When you train, and aviation is a self cleaning oven.

43:28.660 --> 43:33.720
 So if you make bad decisions, and the list is long and distinguished of those who have

43:33.720 --> 43:36.720
 died by making bad decisions.

43:36.720 --> 43:41.480
 So when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry

43:41.480 --> 43:47.740
 and the Navy and the Air Force, for all that, we have what's called, we have emergency procedures

43:47.740 --> 43:48.740
 that we have to know.

43:48.740 --> 43:52.660
 Like engines on fire, the first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right?

43:52.660 --> 43:53.660
 So they know.

43:53.660 --> 43:57.840
 The airline, same type, they go, hey, I know this is, they pull the book out because the

43:57.840 --> 44:00.880
 airplanes are designed, they're built to have some time.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.760
 But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't second guess it.

44:03.760 --> 44:07.440
 So when he decided I'm putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn't all of a sudden

44:07.440 --> 44:10.920
 halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.840
 He looked, he made a quick assessment.

44:12.840 --> 44:18.280
 This is that 80% solution where you go, these are not, it's like a multiple choice test

44:18.280 --> 44:22.320
 when you go, oh my God, I don't really know the answer, but I know A and D are wrong,

44:22.320 --> 44:23.320
 gone.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.720
 So the Jersey airport and going back to LaGuardia, gone.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.160
 So what's my next option?

44:28.160 --> 44:31.520
 Well, the Hudson River's there and that's probably looking pretty good.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.060
 Or what is my other one?

44:33.060 --> 44:34.800
 Can I get a restart on the motors?

44:34.800 --> 44:38.300
 And then if I can get a restart, now can I take it someplace else?

44:38.300 --> 44:40.960
 He had to make really, really fast decisions.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.880
 And then once they, as they go, that 80% solution, you realize, all right, I'm going into the

44:44.880 --> 44:47.080
 Hudson, there's the 80%, get the book out.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.080
 Let's see if we can get an air start.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.340
 Because if you listen to the tapes, they're trying to get it air started.

44:50.340 --> 44:55.180
 The closer he gets to the water, the more he's going, I'm ditching the airplane.

44:55.180 --> 44:59.600
 So the original decision to, this is my best option right now.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.240
 This is where I'm going.

45:01.240 --> 45:05.700
 And you start eliminating anything that could possibly change the events, which they tried

45:05.700 --> 45:06.920
 to do.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.560
 And then he gets to that last minute, he says, we're going in the water.

45:09.560 --> 45:10.600
 They changed the plan.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.600
 They secure the airplane.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
 They do exactly what they're doing.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.280
 And he does that basically flawless landing on the Hudson.

45:15.280 --> 45:22.160
 But you got to remember, it's every six months for commercial, they go back and they do research

45:22.160 --> 45:23.960
 in the airplane in the simulator.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.180
 Where they train to the airplane being broken.

45:27.180 --> 45:28.440
 You just lost a motor.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.120
 You just lost another motor.

45:30.120 --> 45:36.000
 So they go through this extensive training and all these, we used to refer to it in the

45:36.000 --> 45:37.640
 Navy as the pain cave where you're going to get in.

45:37.640 --> 45:41.680
 Because you know that when you get in for your check ride in a simulator, that the airplane

45:41.680 --> 45:42.680
 is going to break.

45:42.680 --> 45:46.300
 You're going to lose hydro, and it's sometimes they're a problem like, oh, I just lost this

45:46.300 --> 45:48.840
 hydraulic system, but I'm having an issue on the other motor.

45:48.840 --> 45:52.640
 Well, if I shut down this motor and I've got a hydraulics, because there's two hydraulic

45:52.640 --> 45:54.040
 systems, one on each motor.

45:54.040 --> 45:58.160
 Well, if I've got an issue with the left motor hydraulic system and my right motor is starting

45:58.160 --> 46:01.920
 to give me indications, do I want to shut the right motor down because that's going

46:01.920 --> 46:04.300
 to kill my hydraulic system that's good.

46:04.300 --> 46:07.560
 And now I'm flying on a good motor with a bad hydraulic system and without hydraulics,

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
 the airplane won't fly.

46:08.560 --> 46:12.640
 So it's a really, they're challenging problems that you have to think through in real time.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.560
 And of course, the weather's never good.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.840
 It's always dark.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.840
 It's always crappy.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.840
 You're going to break out.

46:17.840 --> 46:23.120
 It's just all this stuff gets compiled on top of you and it's intended to increase the

46:23.120 --> 46:28.800
 level of stress because when things happen, like in Sully's case, we like to joke it's

46:28.800 --> 46:33.000
 going to STEM power, you know, where the functional part of your brain shuts down and you are

46:33.000 --> 46:35.320
 literally on instinct like an animal.

46:35.320 --> 46:39.120
 Well, if you've trained so much that that is the instinctive reaction that you're going

46:39.120 --> 46:45.480
 to have when the main part of your cognitive abilities start to shut down, you're running

46:45.480 --> 46:50.560
 that instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know exactly what to do.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.120
 And that's literally how it happens.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.920
 So there's no, how do I put it?

46:54.920 --> 46:56.160
 Fear of death.

46:56.160 --> 47:02.000
 Like in Sully's case, do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact if his

47:02.000 --> 47:05.520
 decision is wrong, a lot of people are going to die?

47:05.520 --> 47:09.340
 You know, I can't speak for him, but I would say there was so much going on at the cockpit

47:09.340 --> 47:11.000
 in that time.

47:11.000 --> 47:17.440
 His, his mindset was probably, I can do this, I'm trained, I'm going to do the procedures,

47:17.440 --> 47:19.880
 I've practiced this before, I've done these things.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.400
 And I, you know, I'm assuming that in his mindset, cause I never thought about when

47:23.400 --> 47:24.680
 things were really bad.

47:24.680 --> 47:27.160
 You know, if you're having problems with the airplane that, you know, that I was going

47:27.160 --> 47:31.000
 to mort, you know, and, and plant it into the ground, it was always, you know, maybe

47:31.000 --> 47:32.920
 it's an ego thing where you think I can do this.

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
 I mean,

47:33.920 --> 47:43.960
 So you never, have you experienced fear during flight, like, I mean, one, one way we just

47:43.960 --> 47:52.080
 offline mentioned Mike Tyson, I mean, he talked about like, as he's walking up to the ring,

47:52.080 --> 47:59.800
 he's like, he starts out basically in fear and, yeah, worried about how things are going

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
 to go.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.440
 And it's purely to put in towards his fear, but as he gets closer and closer to the ring

48:04.440 --> 48:11.400
 is the confidence grows and grows until the ego basically takes over to where you think

48:11.400 --> 48:15.800
 there's no way anybody could defeat me.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.720
 So like, that's, that's his experience of overcoming fear.

48:18.720 --> 48:23.000
 But do you, did you experience any kind of thing like that?

48:23.000 --> 48:27.400
 Or is that, or do you just go to the part of the brain that goes to the training and

48:27.400 --> 48:30.880
 then you just go to the instinctual 80% solution?

48:30.880 --> 48:32.840
 I wouldn't say I was never afraid.

48:32.840 --> 48:36.880
 I think that would be, I can't, I couldn't tell you that anyone I know that wasn't afraid

48:36.880 --> 48:37.880
 at one time.

48:37.880 --> 48:43.400
 And for most of us, especially Navy carrier pilots, it's just, it's, it's usually, especially

48:43.400 --> 48:47.120
 when you're new and you got to go out and it's nighttime and there's no moon and the

48:47.120 --> 48:51.560
 weather sucks and the deck's moving, you know, the, the ship's going up and down because

48:51.560 --> 48:53.840
 it will scare the hell out of you.

48:53.840 --> 48:54.840
 Can I say that?

48:54.840 --> 48:58.480
 You can definitely say that, so it's about landing and take off that.

48:58.480 --> 49:02.800
 That is, if you, even they used to wire people up, they did it during Vietnam, you know,

49:02.800 --> 49:06.000
 guys would go fly missions, you know, when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going

49:06.000 --> 49:09.440
 on and people were getting shot down a lot.

49:09.440 --> 49:12.960
 The highest, the highest anxiety and heart rates were coming back to land on board an

49:12.960 --> 49:13.960
 aircraft carrier.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.360
 How hard is it to land on that?

49:15.360 --> 49:16.360
 It seems impossible.

49:16.360 --> 49:23.200
 Like for, for a civilian, I guess, like me, it just seems crazy that a human can do that.

49:23.200 --> 49:28.520
 The problem with night is, and there's different degrees of night, just like day.

49:28.520 --> 49:32.800
 I mean, there's the clear full moon night, you know, where it's like, woo, you know,

49:32.800 --> 49:37.880
 this is not that bad, but you got to remember at night, I think everyone can associate with

49:37.880 --> 49:43.000
 you're driving in your car and it's just a, it's, it's an overcast dark night and you're

49:43.000 --> 49:46.040
 on a country road with no side lights.

49:46.040 --> 49:50.200
 Most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of, Oh my God.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.820
 Because you, what you'll do is you'll out drive your headlights because it is so dark,

49:53.820 --> 49:56.120
 you know, and you can get outside of, you get outside of the city and get up into New

49:56.120 --> 50:01.080
 Hampshire, especially when the roads are curving, you know, and the lines probably aren't that

50:01.080 --> 50:02.080
 good.

50:02.080 --> 50:07.520
 It's, you know, now take that and multiply it by like a million because you have no depth

50:07.520 --> 50:09.960
 perception.

50:09.960 --> 50:16.080
 What you think is fixed, the runway is actually moving up and down and left to right.

50:16.080 --> 50:22.040
 Yeah, oh, and when it's really bad, you can actually see it move and we have two systems,

50:22.040 --> 50:27.560
 you know, there was a, there's an automatic system that's actually, it stabilizes with

50:27.560 --> 50:30.880
 the inertials on the ship and then there's the ILS.

50:30.880 --> 50:35.340
 Now civilian pilots will tell you that ILS is a precision approach, which gives you azimuth

50:35.340 --> 50:36.340
 and glide slope.

50:36.340 --> 50:39.080
 You know, you come down, it's like a plus.

50:39.080 --> 50:42.000
 On the carrier, it's not, it's really just a beam that goes out and it's considered a

50:42.000 --> 50:43.640
 non precision approach.

50:43.640 --> 50:47.800
 It's not stabilized at all that, and I've been where you can actually watch the needle

50:47.800 --> 50:49.720
 and the, and the tack and needle will move.

50:49.720 --> 50:53.920
 There's all kinds of stuff moving cause the base that it's all sitting on is doing this

50:53.920 --> 50:55.680
 and ships don't just go up and down.

50:55.680 --> 50:56.760
 They, they, they do this.

50:56.760 --> 51:00.480
 So the bow goes up and down in the tail, like you normally see a ship and then there's,

51:00.480 --> 51:03.120
 so that's pitch and then it has roll.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.680
 So it's doing this and then it has heave.

51:04.680 --> 51:08.640
 So the whole boat is going up and down while it's pitching and rolling and you're gonna

51:08.640 --> 51:09.640
 land on that.

51:09.640 --> 51:17.000
 Um, so, and it's, I mean, I remember landing as I was with Chris, uh, Sato and, uh, Chris

51:17.000 --> 51:19.680
 and I, we were off the USS ranger, which is now decommissioned.

51:19.680 --> 51:24.400
 It's sitting, getting turned into razorblades, um, we're flying the old a six and we come

51:24.400 --> 51:27.920
 in and it was off of San Diego and it was just ugly night cause San Diego always has

51:27.920 --> 51:31.980
 a Marine layer that is about 1200 feet was lower than that, that night and it was pouring

51:31.980 --> 51:32.980
 down rain.

51:32.980 --> 51:34.720
 It was an El Nino year and there's thunderstorms all around.

51:34.720 --> 51:37.840
 It was just craziest night I've ever seen out of San Diego.

51:37.840 --> 51:42.120
 And I remember landing and your adrenaline is so high that you're shaking.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.400
 I mean, you literally can't stop.

51:44.400 --> 51:48.000
 And we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked, we call it the six pack.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
 So it's right in front of the Island.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.560
 So if you see an aircraft carrier with the Island and the number of the ship on it, we're

51:52.560 --> 51:54.940
 sitting right in front of that and we're looking at the landing area.

51:54.940 --> 52:00.600
 So it's like you get front row seats to the concert and, and this, this, this EA six B

52:00.600 --> 52:03.580
 comes in, you know, ugly pass.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.760
 He ends up catching a one wire, which is the first one.

52:05.760 --> 52:09.000
 You never want to catch the first one, which means you were not really high above the back

52:09.000 --> 52:14.800
 of the ship when you landed and it comes in and the exhaust on an EA six or an a six actually

52:14.800 --> 52:19.280
 points kind of down and it blows and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.280
 That's how hard it's raining.

52:20.280 --> 52:21.640
 And you literally could not see across.

52:21.640 --> 52:25.400
 I mean, I could see the front of my airplane, his airplane, and then it was just white because

52:25.400 --> 52:27.600
 of the water being blown off the deck.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.920
 And I'm shaking and I, I, I'll never forget.

52:29.920 --> 52:33.800
 I looked over at Chris and I said, Oh my God, I go, Hey dude, man, 10,000 foot runway looks

52:33.800 --> 52:35.400
 really good right now.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.240
 And I go, and I'm, I'm shaking my hands like this.

52:37.240 --> 52:40.040
 And I said, I'm not even, this is, I'm not faking this too.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.520
 I know that's literally, I cannot stop shaking.

52:42.520 --> 52:49.480
 I said, that scared the Evelyn out of me, but you, but it scares you afterwards.

52:49.480 --> 52:52.280
 You don't, during it, you're not, I'm not, you don't have time to think about that.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.280
 You're doing it.

52:53.280 --> 52:58.080
 You got to do is we, you know, kind of the quote from Tom Hanks and what's that?

52:58.080 --> 53:01.720
 The girls baseball movie where he goes, there's no crying in baseball.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.160
 Well, that's our joke.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.520
 There's no crying in Naval aviation.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.240
 I said, you can fly around and cry all you want at night, but you know, there's only

53:08.240 --> 53:10.320
 one pilot in those airplanes and you got to land it.

53:10.320 --> 53:14.800
 So you cry all you want, wipe the tears away, you know, put on your big kid pants and it's,

53:14.800 --> 53:18.680
 it's time to, it's time to, you know, man up and, and land that, land the jet.

53:18.680 --> 53:25.200
 Sorry for the romantic question, but going back to the kid that dreamed to fly, what's

53:25.200 --> 53:28.600
 it like to fly an airplane?

53:28.600 --> 53:34.360
 What it looks incredible to me as a human, like a descendant of ape.

53:34.360 --> 53:38.080
 I sit here on land and look up at you guys.

53:38.080 --> 53:41.200
 It seems incredible that human being can do that.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.520
 You know what people ask, you know, I'll be sitting around with my friends and they're

53:43.520 --> 53:44.520
 like, how was it?

53:44.520 --> 53:47.920
 I said, it's the greatest job on the planet.

53:47.920 --> 53:54.640
 I said, you know, it's, it's an office with a view cause you're sitting in a glass.

53:54.640 --> 53:58.160
 You can do you know, it's like roller coasters.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.340
 You go, Oh, it does all these cool stuff.

53:59.340 --> 54:03.120
 So we take people flying every once in a while and it's like, Oh yeah, I like rollercoaster.

54:03.120 --> 54:07.320
 So I go, no, take any rollercoaster coolest rollercoaster you've ever been on and multiply

54:07.320 --> 54:08.320
 it by a thousand.

54:08.320 --> 54:14.560
 And I said, it's an experience you know, to put your body under, you know, you know, the

54:14.560 --> 54:18.480
 jets rated at seven and a half, but it'll pull up to 8.1 before it overstresses depends

54:18.480 --> 54:19.480
 on fuel weight.

54:19.480 --> 54:25.960
 So, I mean, you routinely get up there towards eight G's to be able to do that to your body.

54:25.960 --> 54:26.960
 I mean, it takes a toll.

54:26.960 --> 54:31.960
 Like I can't really turn my head real good anymore and stuff like that, but would I trade

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
 it?

54:32.960 --> 54:35.080
 It's a dream and how many people get to do that?

54:35.080 --> 54:39.080
 You know, professional, I want to be an NFL, you know, and you end up to the NFL, which

54:39.080 --> 54:45.360
 is a very small percentage with, well, I want to fly jets and to fly, you know, at the time

54:45.360 --> 54:48.520
 when I was flying the Super Hornets that we had in our squad and we're brand new at like

54:48.520 --> 54:52.320
 literally right out of the factory, I'd come off our first Super Hornet cruise.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.720
 We had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis where they were building my new jets that

54:55.720 --> 54:56.720
 I was going to get.

54:56.720 --> 55:00.080
 And I actually signed the inside of one of the wings while they were putting it together.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.980
 So I'm meeting the people that are putting the jet together that's going to get delivered

55:02.980 --> 55:05.600
 to me in a couple of months that I'm going to fly.

55:05.600 --> 55:17.700
 So just, I mean, I'll tell you what, when I left, when I decided to walk away, I told

55:17.700 --> 55:23.480
 myself I wouldn't, I promised myself that, you know, once you get through your O5 command,

55:23.480 --> 55:26.840
 your flying really starts to tag to come down.

55:26.840 --> 55:30.560
 You know, even if you, when you're an air wing commander, which is, we call them CAG,

55:30.560 --> 55:35.600
 carrier group commander, you're not flying as much as like the normal pilots, nor should

55:35.600 --> 55:36.600
 you be.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.380
 I mean, there's young people that are coming up and it's training your relief because that's

55:39.380 --> 55:40.380
 the next generation.

55:40.380 --> 55:45.340
 So like currently I have friends of mine that we serve together.

55:45.340 --> 55:48.240
 Their kids are flying Super Hornets, right?

55:48.240 --> 55:53.460
 So to me, that's really neat because I watched them when they were little and now, you know,

55:53.460 --> 55:58.780
 one of them who was good friends, I won't get his last name, but Joey, who lived down

55:58.780 --> 56:04.480
 the street from us, was a Top Gun instructor and I'm like, hey, Joey's a Top Gun.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.480
 You know?

56:05.480 --> 56:08.220
 And I'm like, that's cool because, you know, I went there and I knew him, he would come

56:08.220 --> 56:09.220
 down to my house.

56:09.220 --> 56:13.340
 And now to see these kids that are, because typically military breeds military, you know,

56:13.340 --> 56:14.340
 because the kids grow up in it.

56:14.340 --> 56:19.000
 I mean, and I, the only reason that my son is not doing it is he's colorblind.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.660
 So it disqualifies you for being a pilot, being a SEAL because he had talked about doing

56:23.660 --> 56:29.320
 that because he's an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water polo player.

56:29.320 --> 56:34.580
 But he's, you know, both of my kids are, well, my daughter is a doctor and my son's in his

56:34.580 --> 56:35.580
 third year.

56:35.580 --> 56:36.580
 So.

56:36.580 --> 56:42.420
 But there's a, I suppose, I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover of this

56:42.420 --> 56:46.180
 incredible experience of flying to the younger generation.

56:46.180 --> 56:49.860
 So you don't, you told yourself you're not going to miss it.

56:49.860 --> 56:50.860
 You miss it?

56:50.860 --> 56:52.020
 There are days I do.

56:52.020 --> 56:57.580
 When I hear jets, like if I'm around a base or a jet flies over, but I have all the memory

56:57.580 --> 57:01.660
 so I can look at it and go, it can't go on forever.

57:01.660 --> 57:05.560
 You know, Tom Brady can't play football, but there's going to come a time where he has

57:05.560 --> 57:06.560
 to stop.

57:06.560 --> 57:08.500
 He seems to have done it for a long time.

57:08.500 --> 57:12.720
 But you know, typically when you look at it, you go, I had the opportunity.

57:12.720 --> 57:18.460
 And I think as automation moves on, especially with AI that, you know, when will, when will

57:18.460 --> 57:20.860
 the last man fighter be built?

57:20.860 --> 57:23.620
 You know, and that's that big question, you know, we just did F 35.

57:23.620 --> 57:25.020
 It's over budget.

57:25.020 --> 57:26.820
 It's seven years late.

57:26.820 --> 57:29.180
 There's all kinds of issues when we try and do it.

57:29.180 --> 57:32.540
 And then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the air force is working

57:32.540 --> 57:39.740
 on with smaller, cheaper, uh, a trittable platforms that you can go, Oh, we can, because

57:39.740 --> 57:44.820
 if you don't put a man in the box or a person, because there's a lot of incredibly talented

57:44.820 --> 57:47.220
 women that do this too.

57:47.220 --> 57:48.460
 So I'll just say that as person.

57:48.460 --> 57:49.460
 Yeah.

57:49.460 --> 57:54.040
 So we say man and he, we mean both men and women because offline you've told me about

57:54.040 --> 57:55.620
 a lot of incredible women that flown.

57:55.620 --> 58:01.660
 So I had, I had three, three female, actually four, one of them didn't fly anymore.

58:01.660 --> 58:03.540
 She actually lives right around here.

58:03.540 --> 58:09.060
 She, she's a, she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn't fly anymore.

58:09.060 --> 58:15.020
 One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly, she's one of the most gifted people I've ever

58:15.020 --> 58:16.020
 met in my life.

58:16.020 --> 58:17.540
 She is the vice president of Amazon air.

58:17.540 --> 58:21.140
 You can see her on TV, her name's Sarah, uh, incredible.

58:21.140 --> 58:24.860
 And then I had a page who ended up taking command.

58:24.860 --> 58:27.380
 She got out of fighters and went into other platforms.

58:27.380 --> 58:29.380
 Um, and she was a commanding officer.

58:29.380 --> 58:36.100
 And then the other one is a, um, teaches leadership and she is all three of them, actually all

58:36.100 --> 58:38.100
 four of the women that were direct.

58:38.100 --> 58:42.820
 Uh, I'm hoping not forgetting, I don't think I'm forgetting someone, uh, incredibly, incredibly

58:42.820 --> 58:45.780
 talented, uh, and a great addition to the ready room.

58:45.780 --> 58:48.280
 So anyone that gets into the, Oh, you know, women can't do it.

58:48.280 --> 58:49.420
 That's all total horse crap.

58:49.420 --> 58:53.380
 Hey, you know, we can talk about the original integration and stuff, which was not done

58:53.380 --> 58:56.020
 well by the military nor the Navy.

58:56.020 --> 58:58.540
 So women can fly as good as the guys.

58:58.540 --> 58:59.540
 Yeah.

58:59.540 --> 59:02.500
 You can't tell if you pass another airplane, you can't tell if there's a man or woman in

59:02.500 --> 59:03.500
 it.

59:03.500 --> 59:10.820
 It comes down to, uh, stick and throttle the ability to, uh, uh, extrapolate where the

59:10.820 --> 59:12.860
 vehicle is going to be, where the airplane would be.

59:12.860 --> 59:15.460
 If you're fighting another one, you have to be able to think fast.

59:15.460 --> 59:17.880
 Anyone has those characteristics, uh, can do it.

59:17.880 --> 59:22.140
 And then I think most important besides that there has to be a desire.

59:22.140 --> 59:24.780
 And I'm not saying that everyone, if you took, cause we used to track.

59:24.780 --> 59:27.980
 So when I ran, we call it the rag, it's the replacement air group.

59:27.980 --> 59:31.580
 It's where, so the, the super Hornet training squadron, there's two of them.

59:31.580 --> 59:33.500
 There's one on the East coast at one Oh six.

59:33.500 --> 59:37.740
 And there's one on the West coast, which is VFA one 22, one 22 is the first one.

59:37.740 --> 59:41.500
 So I ended up going there and I ended up being the operations officer and training officer.

59:41.500 --> 59:42.500
 Okay.

59:42.500 --> 59:45.060
 So we tracked the last hundred students.

59:45.060 --> 59:46.060
 Right.

59:46.060 --> 59:51.000
 So everyone goes, ah, it's funny to hear students talk cause Oh, he's awesome.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.880
 If you took the hundred, there's three at the top of the list that are just naturally

59:54.880 --> 59:56.220
 gifted aviators.

59:56.220 --> 59:58.040
 They're well, well, well above average.

59:58.040 --> 1:00:01.500
 It's like the person in a math class that sits down in complex math and they just get

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:02.500
 it.

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:06.660
 You know, at the bottom, there's the three at the bottom that are going to struggle and

1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:08.540
 there's a good chance they won't get out.

1:00:08.540 --> 1:00:12.740
 And if they do get out, they're going to have to work really hard to just maintain kind

1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:14.120
 of average.

1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:15.340
 Sometimes it's just the way your mind works.

1:00:15.340 --> 1:00:17.180
 Not everyone is good at everything.

1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:22.820
 If you took the 94 of them in the middle, they're within one mean deviation of, you

1:00:22.820 --> 1:00:23.820
 know, it's there.

1:00:23.820 --> 1:00:27.060
 They're all, you know, it's a, the bell curve doesn't look real good.

1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:30.620
 It's just a big hump and it comes back down and everyone's right there within one mean

1:00:30.620 --> 1:00:32.300
 deviation.

1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:35.260
 And then you have the outliers, usually not on the high side because they're going to

1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:39.140
 get through, but the outliers on the low side that don't make it through.

1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:43.060
 So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job, as does the Air Force, of screening.

1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:46.520
 So now what they do, when I went, you just showed up and you started.

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:51.860
 Now what you do is you actually go fly Piper Warriors low wing to see, are you adaptable

1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:52.860
 to this?

1:00:52.860 --> 1:00:57.160
 And there's an evaluation that goes through and then if you hit a certain mark, then you're

1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:59.220
 good to go and then they put you into primary.

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:03.500
 It's kind of like a, it's like a precheck, you know, like the preset, the pre SAT to

1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:05.140
 go, Hey, how am I going to do on the SAT?

1:01:05.140 --> 1:01:09.100
 It's, it's, it's very similar to that, but it's more of a hand skill.

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:10.100
 Can you adapt?

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:13.860
 Because although we live in three dimensions, like this table is not, you know, we, this

1:01:13.860 --> 1:01:19.040
 is, you know, this is all has depth with all that, uh, where it's really relative to aviation.

1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:20.860
 We are two dimensional.

1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:21.860
 Very two dimensional.

1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:23.380
 Can you, can you explain that?

1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:29.020
 So our perception is actually more limited than the, than that of an aviator.

1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:30.020
 Very much.

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.020
 And here's why.

1:01:31.020 --> 1:01:32.020
 Yeah.

1:01:32.020 --> 1:01:33.380
 So we look at, uh, let's look at a tall building.

1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:36.500
 Let's look at one world trade center in New York cause that's the, everyone knows what

1:01:36.500 --> 1:01:37.500
 it looks like.

1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:38.500
 Big tall building.

1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:42.540
 Um, it's what, maybe 1800 feet tall.

1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:45.380
 Even the Burj Al Dubai, which is like what 20 some hundred feet tall.

1:01:45.380 --> 1:01:46.620
 It's not that big.

1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:51.380
 So a Super Hornet to do a, what a split S is, which is I'm flying, I'm just going to

1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:56.060
 roll the airplane upside down and then I'm going to do basically a C the letter C I'm

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:58.180
 going to go in the top and out the bottom.

1:01:58.180 --> 1:02:01.240
 So and I'm just against basically a vertical displacement of the airplane.

1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:03.780
 So I'm going from high to low.

1:02:03.780 --> 1:02:08.780
 It's very, very tight and it doesn't in about roughly about 2,500 feet, give or take a little.

1:02:08.780 --> 1:02:12.540
 So you go, that is, that is a really tight vertical turn.

1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:13.540
 Yeah.

1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:17.180
 For example, the a six in order to do that was about 9,000 feet.

1:02:17.180 --> 1:02:20.500
 And we look at a building that's 2000 feet high and think that is tall.

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:21.500
 Right.

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:22.500
 All right.

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:25.920
 So in, in aviation sense, when you're starting to do vertical displacement numbers going

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:30.780
 from 35,000 feet down to 20,000 feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane,

1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:33.700
 because the human brain thinks we really are.

1:02:33.700 --> 1:02:34.700
 We like to be flat.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:35.700
 I see what you mean.

1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:36.700
 We think 2d.

1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:40.780
 So if I'm fighting, how you really get an advantage when you're fighting another airplane

1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:45.380
 is to work in the vertical, because most people will do like one move in the vertical and

1:02:45.380 --> 1:02:47.940
 then they want to start to flatten out because that's where we're comfortable.

1:02:47.940 --> 1:02:48.940
 Yeah.

1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:49.940
 So they're profound.

1:02:49.940 --> 1:02:55.460
 Do you still think in like stacks of 2d layers or no, or do you, do you truly start to think

1:02:55.460 --> 1:03:03.860
 in that third dimension, like the rich 3d world of, uh, like of, of fighting that can,

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:09.220
 do you start to actually be able to really experience the 3d nature?

1:03:09.220 --> 1:03:11.200
 You do because you have to project where you're going to be.

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:14.780
 So you have to know the performance of the airplane knowing that, Hey, if I do this maneuver

1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:18.660
 that I am going to go, it's, it's kind of like when I, when I talk about when we were

1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:20.100
 chasing the Tic Tac.

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:23.700
 So the Tic Tacs coming up and I'm at about, you know, and I've been doing this for at

1:03:23.700 --> 1:03:25.660
 the time, 16 years.

1:03:25.660 --> 1:03:27.880
 So I'm looking and I'm going, Hey, I'm here.

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:29.380
 He's there on the other side of the circle.

1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:30.820
 I'm going to do a vertical displacement.

1:03:30.820 --> 1:03:31.820
 I'm going to go like this.

1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:33.780
 I'm going to cut across the circle and I'm not going to him.

1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:34.780
 I'm going out in front of him.

1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:37.900
 I'm going over here because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver, that's

1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:38.900
 where he's going to be.

1:03:38.900 --> 1:03:40.980
 And I'm trying to, you know, basically join up on him.

1:03:40.980 --> 1:03:44.820
 But I also had to look at it to go, do I have enough altitude to do this?

1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:47.540
 Because what I did before here and I do this, I'm going to end up over here and he's going

1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:48.540
 to be above me.

1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:51.620
 And then, you know, I have to get that energy back to get up to him.

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:54.540
 And when you're doing a max performance, it's a trade.

1:03:54.540 --> 1:03:59.120
 So you have, this is, this is really important when you're, when you're fighting airplanes

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:01.240
 and you're really max performing.

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:05.180
 So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo, he's literally playing with

1:04:05.180 --> 1:04:06.180
 it.

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:07.380
 He's got a finite amount of energy, right?

1:04:07.380 --> 1:04:10.220
 He can add some with the motors and stuff, but you're, what you're really doing is it's

1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:15.160
 a trade off and you can trade off kinetic energy, speed for altitude, which gives you

1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:16.640
 potential energy.

1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:21.020
 The other piece is, is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance.

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:24.320
 Because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it at what doesn't

1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:25.620
 bleed energy.

1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:30.080
 But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S, that it's going to cost me energy.

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:34.040
 So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right, I'm going to come out at the

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.540
 bottom at probably 200 knots.

1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:41.340
 Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to that, to kinetic and that

1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:45.900
 kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings in order for me to get that high performance

1:04:45.900 --> 1:04:46.900
 turn.

1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:51.500
 So you've got to constantly evaluate where you're at and it's your overall energy package.

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:55.360
 So you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill you.

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:59.780
 But if this jet is at 400 knots and this jet is at 110 knots, this jet's just going to

1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:03.820
 pull away, drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds.

1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:08.340
 It's overall energy package and that's that you've got to be constantly evaluating where

1:05:08.340 --> 1:05:09.340
 you're at.

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.340
 And this is that 80% solution.

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:11.340
 Can I afford to do this or not?

1:05:11.340 --> 1:05:12.340
 Yes, no.

1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:13.340
 And you have literally a split second to make the decision.

1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:18.060
 That's the most incredible dance of human decision making.

1:05:18.060 --> 1:05:19.060
 It's just incredible.

1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:23.260
 I know a million people want me to talk about Tic Tac and I definitely will, but let me

1:05:23.260 --> 1:05:29.820
 ask the one last ridiculous, subjective question.

1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:35.740
 What's the greatest plane ever made in history?

1:05:35.740 --> 1:05:36.740
 You don't get to like...

1:05:36.740 --> 1:05:40.540
 From Pure Speed, I would say SR71, I think it's an engineering marvel that was actually

1:05:40.540 --> 1:05:44.220
 developed in the fifties by Kelly Johnson, Skunk Works.

1:05:44.220 --> 1:05:46.980
 For what that was able to do, and then when you get into history of it, you know how they

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:49.240
 actually built...

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:54.480
 The CIA actually made like six companies in order to buy the titanium from Russia to bring

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:58.740
 it back and build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly over Russia.

1:05:58.740 --> 1:06:00.700
 To me, that's an incredible...

1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:01.700
 Engineering marvel.

1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:03.700
 I think that like the X15, you know...

1:06:03.700 --> 1:06:13.260
 By the way, the SR71 still holds the speed record of any plane as far as I can understand.

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:14.260
 Yeah.

1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:15.660
 What's funny when you get into it is it's...

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:18.260
 Remember, fast is relative.

1:06:18.260 --> 1:06:24.260
 When I say that, I mean, so if you're going 3000 miles an hour, a hundred feet above the

1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:30.220
 ground, you're going 3000 miles an hour through, you know, that's how fast you're going.

1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:34.860
 When you get up to altitude, there's an indicated airspeed and there's, you know, your ground

1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:35.860
 speed.

1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:38.900
 So your indicated airspeed is really how fast the air is going past your airplane.

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:44.820
 Well, the air is so thin up there, you may only be showing like 300 knots.

1:06:44.820 --> 1:06:48.820
 But at 300 knots, you're really doing 2,500 miles an hour over the ground.

1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:53.780
 So you know, like we would take the airplanes up to 50,000 feet when we had to do full the

1:06:53.780 --> 1:06:55.500
 maintenance check flights on them.

1:06:55.500 --> 1:07:00.500
 So when you're doing 200, you know, in some odd knots, it's actually slow for the airplane.

1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:04.060
 It's, you know, you're getting, you know, it's kind of like, it's not, you know, there's

1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:05.100
 maneuvering speeds.

1:07:05.100 --> 1:07:08.980
 You know that if I hit a certain speed in a Super Hornet, that I have the full capability

1:07:08.980 --> 1:07:09.980
 of the airfoil.

1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:13.540
 If I'm below that speed, I'm going to stall the airfoil before I get to the maximum G.

1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:15.620
 Okay?

1:07:15.620 --> 1:07:19.940
 So when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it really going fast?

1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:24.500
 When you look at an SR71 that's flying upwards of, you know, 70 plus thousand feet, the air's

1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:29.500
 so thin, you know, just like the X15, you can get to a much higher speed, but the relative

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:32.700
 speed of the air going over you is actually relatively low.

1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:36.260
 So the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down low.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:40.140
 But because you're going fast to get enough air over your pedostatic system to show that

1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:43.380
 you're going 300 knots, you're screaming.

1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:49.000
 I mean, the fastest I ever got was, I was with the, well, soon to be Vice Admiral White.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.940
 So we had taken a check flight and I got it up to 1.78.

1:07:53.940 --> 1:07:57.740
 I got a Super Hornet up to Mach 1.78 and it was, and we were just right by Pebble Beach

1:07:57.740 --> 1:07:58.740
 too.

1:07:58.740 --> 1:07:59.740
 And then...

1:07:59.740 --> 1:08:00.740
 What's that feel like?

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:01.740
 Or is it just like...

1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:04.740
 When you get that fast, it started, to me, it got a little bit weird because you realize

1:08:04.740 --> 1:08:08.220
 in your brain, and I did, that there's no out.

1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:10.500
 If something happens, I can't eject.

1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:11.700
 The ejection would kill me.

1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:13.740
 Isn't that kind of liberating in a way?

1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:14.740
 Or no?

1:08:14.740 --> 1:08:15.740
 Okay, maybe not.

1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:17.660
 You always want to push the limit.

1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:20.180
 You know, it's like how fast, I could have got it going faster.

1:08:20.180 --> 1:08:24.260
 It was literally still accelerating when I stopped, but I had, it was fuel limited and

1:08:24.260 --> 1:08:29.740
 space limited because I'm off the coast of California, Big Sur, and I'm going and I can

1:08:29.740 --> 1:08:32.820
 see Pebble Beach out in the distance, the whole Monterey Peninsula.

1:08:32.820 --> 1:08:34.220
 You're just going fast.

1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:36.780
 And you're doing almost 18 miles a minute.

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:38.340
 I mean, you're screaming.

1:08:38.340 --> 1:08:39.340
 Yeah.

1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:40.340
 I mean, that's...

1:08:40.340 --> 1:08:41.340
 And then you have to turn...

1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:42.460
 Well, the airplane didn't have anything on it.

1:08:42.460 --> 1:08:45.060
 It was a slicked off Super Hornet, so it was basically just the airplane.

1:08:45.060 --> 1:08:47.500
 No pylons, no pods, no nothing.

1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:50.460
 And then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit point for the area.

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:53.620
 And I'm trying to get it down below to subsonic.

1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:56.980
 And there's a bunch of things that are disabled, like the speed brakes that normally we pop

1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:59.860
 out when you're going that fast, they don't, because the Super Hornet really doesn't have

1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:03.700
 speed brakes, it deforms the flight controls.

1:09:03.700 --> 1:09:04.700
 They don't function.

1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:08.540
 So you really, you're trying to maneuver and when you're going that fast, you can't turn

1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:14.420
 because a 7G turn at 1.5 Mach is a pretty big turn.

1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:16.300
 So it's just, it's crazy.

1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:21.980
 It's incredible that a human can do this and a human can engineer the system which allows

1:09:21.980 --> 1:09:24.940
 another human to control that system.

1:09:24.940 --> 1:09:29.460
 To me, I think it's a great experience.

1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:31.660
 Was it sad to see the SR71 go?

1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:33.260
 I think it was during your career.

1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:37.660
 I mean, do you guys romanticize the different planes?

1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:38.660
 We would see it flying.

1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:44.060
 When I was flying Hornets, because West Coast flies and it's called R2508, which covers

1:09:44.060 --> 1:09:47.240
 the Navy China Lake area and Edwards.

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.240
 It's a huge area.

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:51.680
 It's actually, I think, we had a guy from Switzerland come out because they had Hornets

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:55.020
 and he's like, this is bigger than our whole country, because it's a pretty big area in

1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:59.580
 California that you fly, but you would see the SR71s, they had a loop because NASA was

1:09:59.580 --> 1:10:03.380
 flying them out of Palmdale and they would take off and they'd go up towards Washington

1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:05.540
 State and Montana and they'd do a loop.

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:10.420
 So you'd see them coming back down, they'd descend above 60,000, they'd get contrails,

1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:13.580
 the white lines behind airplanes, they'd come down and hit the tanker and then they'd go

1:10:13.580 --> 1:10:14.580
 back up.

1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:18.380
 So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying.

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:27.980
 But I think with money, age, the advent of satellites, because they're everywhere now,

1:10:27.980 --> 1:10:32.780
 I mean, you've got commercial companies putting satellites up, how much of that need was really

1:10:32.780 --> 1:10:33.780
 there?

1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:35.460
 Because you've got to remember when those things started in the 50s, Sputnik wasn't

1:10:35.460 --> 1:10:37.380
 flying around.

1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:41.380
 It was the U2 and the SR71 that were out there doing that work.

1:10:41.380 --> 1:10:45.740
 So at the time it was needed, if you think about it really, it was an incredible feat

1:10:45.740 --> 1:10:47.220
 of aviation for that time.

1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:51.340
 I mean, literally we have yet to pass that and then you also ask, well, is there a need

1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:52.340
 to pass that?

1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:55.940
 I go, I don't know, we got stuff in space, so do we need to make an airplane that goes

1:10:55.940 --> 1:10:56.940
 that fast?

1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:00.620
 I think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don't have to put a person in,

1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:01.780
 it does all kinds of crazy stuff.

1:11:01.780 --> 1:11:05.380
 And all the work with automation, all that kind of stuff.

1:11:05.380 --> 1:11:11.260
 So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of, at least in

1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:19.460
 my view, one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who's witnessed a UFO

1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:23.540
 literally an identified flying object.

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:27.900
 And not only witnessed, but got to, how do you put it?

1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:28.900
 Like chase it, essentially?

1:11:28.900 --> 1:11:29.900
 Chase it.

1:11:29.900 --> 1:11:31.420
 Chase it.

1:11:31.420 --> 1:11:36.060
 So let me just lay out, I think it's easier than you telling the story.

1:11:36.060 --> 1:11:41.260
 Maybe me and my dumb simpleton ways trying to explain the stories, I understand it.

1:11:41.260 --> 1:11:43.540
 And then maybe you can correct me.

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:53.000
 So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton, which is one of the carriers.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000
 That's a cruiser.

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000
 It's a cruiser.

1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000
 It's a cruiser.

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.000
 So you can't land on a.

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.500
 No, helicopter, it has a helicopter pad on the back.

1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:00.500
 Gotcha.

1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:01.500
 And it has weapons on it.

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:02.500
 Okay, gotcha.

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:03.500
 It shoots the missiles up.

1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.500
 But it has a nice radar.

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:08.460
 It has an incredible spy one system phased array, four panels.

1:12:08.460 --> 1:12:09.940
 So it looks in quadrants.

1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:10.940
 Perfect.

1:12:10.940 --> 1:12:16.460
 So they started noticing on November 10th that there is a few objects flying around

1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:22.780
 at 28,000 feet with speed of what I guess is considered a low speed of 120 miles an

1:12:22.780 --> 1:12:23.780
 hour.

1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:28.180
 Don't know what that's in knots, but on the coast of California.

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:32.140
 And they kept detecting these objects for just about a week.

1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:42.300
 Then comes in like your part of the story, which is on November 14th from the, I guess

1:12:42.300 --> 1:12:45.300
 it's from the USS Nimitz.

1:12:45.300 --> 1:12:54.020
 You flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white Tic Tac shaped object with no wings flying

1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:56.820
 in ways you've never thought possible.

1:12:56.820 --> 1:13:01.940
 And in some interview somewhere, you said, I think it was not from this world.

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:07.660
 So there's a mysterious aspect to this object, to this entire situation.

1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:09.460
 There's videos involved.

1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:20.060
 The video of a flare forward looking infrared receiver has also the visible lights.

1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:23.060
 You can switch as a TV mode.

1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:27.100
 So that gives you visible light and then as an IR mode.

1:13:27.100 --> 1:13:30.300
 And Chad Underwood recorded that video.

1:13:30.300 --> 1:13:33.300
 And those are the videos that were released by the Pentagon later.

1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:42.460
 One of the three videos, the two other videos, go fast and gimbal were recorded in 2000 something

1:13:42.460 --> 1:13:50.840
 14 and 15 on the East coast of the United States that had different kinds of objects,

1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:57.840
 but they're weird in the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos and the experiences

1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:03.980
 that people have described were similar in the degree of weirdness.

1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:12.180
 But the differences is actually on the East coast of 2014 case, very few people have spoken

1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:13.300
 about it.

1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:16.760
 And even in your situation, very few people have spoken about it.

1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:24.500
 So there's a mystery to it, but it's in some sense, it's a quite simple story without much

1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:26.780
 resolution to the mystery.

1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:29.060
 And it's fascinating.

1:14:29.060 --> 1:14:31.580
 And there's a lot of opinions.

1:14:31.580 --> 1:14:37.300
 There's division of opinions because it's a mysterious, I mean, it's truly is a UFO

1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:45.420
 in the sense that UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena.

1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:51.080
 So can you maybe correct me on any of the things I've gotten wrong, elaborate on some

1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:54.140
 key things and describe that experience in general.

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.220
 So here's what I know.

1:14:55.220 --> 1:15:03.540
 So yeah, we went out on our mission to go train and they canceled the mission and they

1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:04.540
 sent us down.

1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:05.540
 There's all kinds of rumors out here.

1:15:05.540 --> 1:15:09.740
 There's all kinds of, after this has come out, so originally it was the four of us.

1:15:09.740 --> 1:15:15.320
 There's two jets, two people in each jet, they're F18Fs, okay?

1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.380
 There is no video from our event.

1:15:17.380 --> 1:15:19.740
 It was all four sets of eyeballs staring at this thing.

1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:24.160
 And then when we came back and told it when Chad and his pilot took off, that's when Chad

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.300
 got the video of it.

1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:26.580
 And we're like, that's it.

1:15:26.580 --> 1:15:27.580
 That's exactly it.

1:15:27.580 --> 1:15:28.580
 That's it.

1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:32.980
 So when you say eyeballs, you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing?

1:15:32.980 --> 1:15:33.980
 Yeah.

1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:35.780
 So as we're flying out, we get vectored.

1:15:35.780 --> 1:15:37.380
 They come up and tell us, hey, we're going to cancel training.

1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:38.580
 This is a USS Princeton.

1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:40.360
 So this is a Aegis Cruiser.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:47.580
 So we're talking to one controller who is like, hey, sir, first you ask what ordinance

1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:48.580
 we have on board.

1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:52.300
 And I laugh because we don't carry live ordinance in training typically because bad stuff happens.

1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:55.300
 Usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missile comes off and hits a

1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:58.100
 good airplane and it's not good.

1:15:58.100 --> 1:16:02.060
 So we had what's called a Catam 9, which is really just a blue two with the AIM 9 seeker

1:16:02.060 --> 1:16:05.460
 on the front of it, which is an IR missile.

1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:06.660
 So there's only two ways to get it off.

1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:07.900
 You can beat it off with a sledgehammer.

1:16:07.900 --> 1:16:11.380
 You can take this thing and you put a wrench in it and it unlocks the lugs and pulls the

1:16:11.380 --> 1:16:13.180
 lugs back in that hold it on.

1:16:13.180 --> 1:16:16.860
 When it really fires the impulse from the engine, actually throws the lugs forward and

1:16:16.860 --> 1:16:19.340
 breaks that release and it comes off down the rail.

1:16:19.340 --> 1:16:21.300
 That's how it works.

1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:24.020
 So they said, hey, well, we have real world tasking.

1:16:24.020 --> 1:16:30.380
 So as we're going out, my wingman, the other pilot, she maneuvers the airplane to the left

1:16:30.380 --> 1:16:31.700
 hand side of me.

1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:36.580
 So she's kind of stepped up like this and I'll use your mic box to start.

1:16:36.580 --> 1:16:40.220
 So as we're going out, they're calling ranges are called bra calls, bearing range and altitude.

1:16:40.220 --> 1:16:44.980
 And they're telling us, hey, it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles.

1:16:44.980 --> 1:16:49.880
 So they're saying, hey, two, seven, zero, 30, 20,000, that's all they say.

1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:55.320
 So we got our radars and we had to mechanically scan radars at the time, APG 73.

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:58.340
 Good piece of gear, APG 79, new one's way better.

1:16:58.340 --> 1:16:59.340
 But anyway.

1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:04.060
 And I apologize if I interrupt the story, hopefully it's useful, but they're telling

1:17:04.060 --> 1:17:06.780
 you a location of a thing that you should look at.

1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:08.580
 They're telling us they have a contact on their radar.

1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:09.580
 They don't know what it is.

1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:10.580
 They just have a blip.

1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:11.580
 They have a little blip.

1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:14.540
 Well, they've been watching these things and what he told me is they had been looking at

1:17:14.540 --> 1:17:15.540
 these things as we're driving.

1:17:15.540 --> 1:17:17.300
 He says, sir, we've been tracking these things for about two weeks.

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:18.900
 That's we had been at sea for two weeks.

1:17:18.900 --> 1:17:21.380
 This is the first time we've had planes airborne.

1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:22.700
 We want you to go see what these are.

1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:23.700
 Gotcha.

1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:26.980
 So they kind of interrupt the mission to say, check it out.

1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:27.980
 That's exactly it.

1:17:27.980 --> 1:17:34.020
 So we start driving out there and as we get down to, he's going, you know, 20 miles, 15

1:17:34.020 --> 1:17:35.020
 miles, 10 miles.

1:17:35.020 --> 1:17:38.620
 And then you get to a point where they call merge plot, which means we are inside of the

1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:42.920
 resolution cell of the radar because radars don't see everything there.

1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:46.260
 So they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution, right?

1:17:46.260 --> 1:17:50.140
 So and it's basically think of a little cube so they can, and the whole sky is made of

1:17:50.140 --> 1:17:52.440
 all these little cubes and they're looking.

1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:56.320
 So if you're inside a cube with something and you're both inside the same little cube,

1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:57.780
 then the radar can only see one thing.

1:17:57.780 --> 1:17:58.780
 Does that make sense?

1:17:58.780 --> 1:17:59.780
 Yep.

1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:00.780
 Yep.

1:18:00.780 --> 1:18:01.780
 So they call merge plot.

1:18:01.780 --> 1:18:05.340
 Well, when we say merge plot to us, it means he's right around, something's around you,

1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:06.340
 get your head out.

1:18:06.340 --> 1:18:09.700
 So we're not looking at radar scopes anymore and the wizos, the wizos can look, but everyone

1:18:09.700 --> 1:18:10.700
 it's heads out.

1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:13.740
 When they say merge plot, you're done looking at your displays inside.

1:18:13.740 --> 1:18:15.940
 You're doing this and you're trying to find it.

1:18:15.940 --> 1:18:20.380
 So as we look out to the right and you look high and low, because he could be anywhere

1:18:20.380 --> 1:18:21.820
 from the surface all the way up.

1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:26.180
 Now keep in mind the ship is like probably 60 miles away, so it can't see the surface

1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:31.220
 and you can do your standard radar horizon calculation and go, hey, it's the thing is

1:18:31.220 --> 1:18:35.780
 40 feet off the water, the panel, can he really see, you know, there are radars that can see

1:18:35.780 --> 1:18:40.340
 around the curve, but let's just say that it can't at this time.

1:18:40.340 --> 1:18:42.820
 So you go, is it, you know, where is it at?

1:18:42.820 --> 1:18:47.660
 So as we're looking around, we see, now this is a, it's a clear day.

1:18:47.660 --> 1:18:51.420
 There's no clouds and there's no whitecaps.

1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:54.460
 It's just a calm, it's actually a perfect day.

1:18:54.460 --> 1:18:57.940
 If you own a sailboat, it was that five to 10 knots of wind and you just want to kind

1:18:57.940 --> 1:19:01.180
 of go out there and you're not going to get beat up and have whitewater coming out.

1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:03.020
 It was the perfect day to own a sailboat.

1:19:03.020 --> 1:19:04.460
 How many miles out do you see?

1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:07.380
 Like seven, like you see just, it's a clear day.

1:19:07.380 --> 1:19:08.900
 It's 50, it's unrestricted visibility.

1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:10.540
 You can see literally all the way to the horizon.

1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:11.720
 It's just clear.

1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:12.720
 It's nothing.

1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:13.820
 And we're basically off the coast.

1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:17.940
 If you look at a map and you go San Diego and then inside of Mexico, we're kind of in

1:19:17.940 --> 1:19:18.940
 between that.

1:19:18.940 --> 1:19:25.900
 And we're probably about, by the time this all hits, we're price, I don't know, 80, 100,

1:19:25.900 --> 1:19:30.500
 I don't know, but somewhere out, it's pretty far off the coast, but from 20,000 feet, you'd

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:31.500
 be amazed.

1:19:31.500 --> 1:19:32.500
 You can do the calculation.

1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:35.700
 You can see stuff, you know, you'll see land 50 miles away, you know, you can see, you

1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:39.460
 know, and when you're looking at a continent, it's really easy to see you're not looking

1:19:39.460 --> 1:19:40.460
 at an island.

1:19:40.460 --> 1:19:41.460
 I mean, you're looking at Mexico.

1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:44.460
 And you can see on the whitecaps in the water, if there is any.

1:19:44.460 --> 1:19:45.460
 Oh yeah, they're easy.

1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:46.460
 Yeah.

1:19:46.460 --> 1:19:50.860
 For us, we look at it because we know if it's natural wind or, so if it's a really whitecap

1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:53.660
 windy day, then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it.

1:19:53.660 --> 1:19:55.540
 It makes it actually easier.

1:19:55.540 --> 1:19:58.540
 If the ship has to move or it's got a big weight because it has to make its own wind

1:19:58.540 --> 1:20:02.100
 when we land, which is the day that it was this day, you go, oh, okay.

1:20:02.100 --> 1:20:05.420
 And it creates what's called, we call the burble, but when the air flows across the

1:20:05.420 --> 1:20:09.740
 flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know, and then it kicks back up.

1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:12.420
 So when you're coming board to land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then

1:20:12.420 --> 1:20:15.740
 you're going to fall and you got to anticipate that to stay on glideslope.

1:20:15.740 --> 1:20:21.840
 So we're pretty conscious of what's going on out there with the waves and the wind.

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:26.540
 So there's no waves, there's no wind, there's no whitecaps, and we look down and we see

1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:28.420
 whitewater.

1:20:28.420 --> 1:20:33.420
 So if you put a piece of land, a seamount below the surface, like, you know, even 20

1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:35.220
 feet below the surface, it's big enough.

1:20:35.220 --> 1:20:38.900
 As the waves come in, you know, waves have height and length.

1:20:38.900 --> 1:20:42.140
 When they come in, that's what happens on the shore, when a wave comes in, it hits and

1:20:42.140 --> 1:20:45.980
 then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave height up because it can't go anymore

1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:49.520
 and then it breaks over the top and that's where you get the weight.

1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:53.220
 So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount, you'll see stuff come in, the wave

1:20:53.220 --> 1:20:55.180
 will crash and you'll get whitewater.

1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:59.800
 You can go out when it's high tide in any one of the coasts, you can go out here off

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:03.420
 of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks and at high tide, I can't

1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:05.660
 see the rocks are covered, but there'll be whitewater around those rocks.

1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:07.500
 You'll be able to tell there's something underneath the surface.

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:08.500
 Does that make sense?

1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:09.500
 Yeah.

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:10.500
 So that's what it was.

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:14.500
 We don't see an object because there's all kinds of, oh, they saw another craft below

1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:15.500
 the wave.

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:16.740
 We didn't see anything below the water.

1:21:16.740 --> 1:21:18.180
 We just saw whitewater.

1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:21.100
 But the whitewater, and I like to shape it, you can say it was a cross.

1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:23.020
 I say it's about the size of a 737.

1:21:23.020 --> 1:21:27.860
 So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water so the wave

1:21:27.860 --> 1:21:30.820
 is breaking over the top and you're going to get whitewater where the plane is at, you'd

1:21:30.820 --> 1:21:32.520
 see this kind of shape.

1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:34.940
 So it looks like a cross.

1:21:34.940 --> 1:21:39.420
 So as we're looking down off the right side, the backseater in the other airplane, Jim,

1:21:39.420 --> 1:21:41.500
 says this is that talking in partials again.

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:43.180
 He says, hey, Skipper, do you?

1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:44.700
 And that's about what he gets out of his mouth.

1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:47.100
 And I go, what the hell is that?

1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:48.100
 In a nice way.

1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:49.100
 Do you see that essentially is what he's saying?

1:21:49.100 --> 1:21:51.700
 So we see the whitewater and that's what draws our eyes down there.

1:21:51.700 --> 1:21:53.140
 Otherwise we'd have never seen it.

1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:54.140
 So we see this whitewater.

1:21:54.140 --> 1:21:56.460
 I would have loved to see the look on your face when you see that.

1:21:56.460 --> 1:22:01.020
 And then we see this little white tic tac because we're about 20,000 feet above it and

1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:05.740
 it's doing, it's going basically north, south, and then east, west, north, and it's abrupt.

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:06.740
 It's very abrupt.

1:22:06.740 --> 1:22:11.740
 So it's not like a helicopter, if a helicopter is going sideways and it goes once, it's going

1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:15.220
 sideways left and it goes right, what it'll do is it'll go, it's got a speed, it slows

1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:18.760
 down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way.

1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:22.100
 This thing's not, it's like left, right, left, right with no.

1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:28.100
 So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you of the things you've seen in the past.

1:22:28.100 --> 1:22:31.980
 So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter, right?

1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:36.800
 So you go, oh, what is, cause when we see it's moving, we're like, oh, helicopter.

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:39.780
 So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that,

1:22:39.780 --> 1:22:43.820
 because usually when they get down there towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash.

1:22:43.820 --> 1:22:47.020
 You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water, it kicks, the water comes up

1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:50.380
 the sides cause the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that.

1:22:50.380 --> 1:22:53.380
 It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the sides.

1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:56.700
 So you see it and you go, well, there's no, there's no rotor wash.

1:22:56.700 --> 1:22:58.420
 What is that thing?

1:22:58.420 --> 1:22:59.820
 So by this time we're driving around.

1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:02.700
 So as we're, if we were at the six oclock, we're driving around towards that nine oclock

1:23:02.700 --> 1:23:04.340
 position and we're just watching this thing.

1:23:04.340 --> 1:23:07.460
 And it's just, it's still pointing north, south, and it's going left, right, and it's

1:23:07.460 --> 1:23:09.460
 kind of moving around the object.

1:23:09.460 --> 1:23:13.360
 And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half.

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:17.260
 So if you've got the east, west, and then the north, south kind of across, it's hanging

1:23:17.260 --> 1:23:18.820
 out on the southern thing that's hanging out.

1:23:18.820 --> 1:23:21.380
 It's just kind of moving around up, down, left, and it's crossing over it and it's going

1:23:21.380 --> 1:23:22.380
 up.

1:23:22.380 --> 1:23:25.420
 It's just kind of, so now we're like, what the hell is that?

1:23:25.420 --> 1:23:28.900
 So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out.

1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:31.260
 And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here.

1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:32.860
 And I said, yeah, stay up high.

1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:35.360
 Because now we get, we get a different perspective.

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:38.880
 So she's up here and I'm down here as I'm descending.

1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:43.060
 She can watch, because right now all I'm watching is the Tic Tac.

1:23:43.060 --> 1:23:44.660
 She can watch me and the Tic Tac.

1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.740
 So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on, which is really important.

1:23:47.740 --> 1:23:50.540
 You know, you can hear people say it's high cover, whatever.

1:23:50.540 --> 1:23:55.620
 She's watching me, which is, it's perfect as the story goes on, because it gives us

1:23:55.620 --> 1:24:00.300
 two perspectives, you know, of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us when that

1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:01.300
 thing disappears.

1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:04.340
 And they don't, you know, because if it's just like, oh, I lost it and they go, no,

1:24:04.340 --> 1:24:05.340
 it's over to the right.

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:06.340
 We can still see it.

1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:07.860
 We all lost it at the same time.

1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:11.060
 So as we come down, we get to about 12 oclock and I'm descending and it's an easy descent.

1:24:11.060 --> 1:24:15.500
 I'm doing about 300 knots, which is a really good airspeed for the airplane for maneuvering

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:19.740
 because I have, I have everything available to me at that speed.

1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:23.620
 So I'm coming down and as I get to 12 oclock, as the Tic Tac's doing this, it literally,

1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:27.900
 it's like, it's aware of us and it just goes bloop and it kind of points out towards the

1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:29.680
 West and starts coming up.

1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:31.700
 So now it's obviously knows that we're there.

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:33.940
 Whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there.

1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:36.260
 So as we drive around, it's coming up and I'm just coming down.

1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:37.260
 We're just, I'm just watching it.

1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:39.760
 Now, you gotta remember this whole thing is like, this is like five minutes.

1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:43.460
 This is not like we saw it and it was gone or, oh, I saw lights in the sky and they were

1:24:43.460 --> 1:24:44.460
 gone.

1:24:44.460 --> 1:24:50.100
 We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers, watch this thing

1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:51.100
 fly around.

1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:52.140
 So we're like, okay.

1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:55.600
 So I get over to the eight oclock position and I'm a little, I'm a couple thousand feet

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.060
 above it and it's about, so I'm probably at about 15 K I think it is.

1:24:59.060 --> 1:25:00.460
 I think that's my story is about 15.

1:25:00.460 --> 1:25:01.460
 It's just estimating.

1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:05.180
 So you can see it's just a really easy descent because.

1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:06.180
 So what's 15 K?

1:25:06.180 --> 1:25:07.180
 15,000 feet.

1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:08.180
 I thought it was 8,000.

1:25:08.180 --> 1:25:12.700
 No, the other plane ends up about that.

1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:14.500
 So they're still at about 20,000 feet.

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:16.780
 So they're driving around and I'm descending.

1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:17.780
 They're staying up there.

1:25:17.780 --> 1:25:20.460
 So I'm kind of doing this as they drive around.

1:25:20.460 --> 1:25:21.460
 Okay.

1:25:21.460 --> 1:25:23.700
 So I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two oclock position.

1:25:23.700 --> 1:25:27.140
 We're about the eight oclock position and I'm like, oh, I've got, I've got enough altitudes.

1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:28.700
 I'm going to, I'm going to cut across the circle.

1:25:28.700 --> 1:25:31.700
 I tell the guy in my back seat, dude, I'm going to, I'm going to do this.

1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:32.700
 He's like, go for it.

1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:33.700
 Skip.

1:25:33.700 --> 1:25:34.740
 Cause I was a skipper.

1:25:34.740 --> 1:25:37.240
 So I cut across the bottom.

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:40.780
 So I'm kind of almost coming out coaltitude as this thing's coming up, I'm going to meet

1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:41.780
 it.

1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:46.260
 And I'm driving and I get to probably it's, I'm probably about a half mile away, which

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:47.700
 you think, well, a half mile is pretty far.

1:25:47.700 --> 1:25:50.020
 Half mile in aviation isn't, it's nothing.

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.580
 It's I mean, you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane.

1:25:52.580 --> 1:25:54.500
 You can see all kinds of stuff at a half mile.

1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:56.320
 You can see pretty good detail.

1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:58.600
 So I'm like right there and it's coming across my nose.

1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:00.300
 So now I'm basically pointing back towards east.

1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:02.980
 So I'm cutting across cause I'm going to the three oclock position.

1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:05.760
 It's at two oclock and I'm going to meet it at three oclock.

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:08.880
 So as I do this, it goes, it just accelerates and disappears.

1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:11.900
 So this happens at around, estimating about 12,000 feet.

1:26:11.900 --> 1:26:12.900
 So they're at 20.

1:26:12.900 --> 1:26:16.220
 So they've got about 8,000 foot of altitude above us when this happens.

1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:21.060
 And it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, it accelerates and literally in less than,

1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:24.560
 you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes and it's gone.

1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.700
 And so we're like, and I had the first thing is, dude, did you guys see it?

1:26:28.700 --> 1:26:30.740
 The other airplane's like, it's gone.

1:26:30.740 --> 1:26:32.740
 We don't, we have no idea where it's at.

1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:34.020
 So we kind of spin around real quick.

1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:35.460
 I go, well, let's see what's down here.

1:26:35.460 --> 1:26:38.620
 And I turn around and we're looking for the whitewater and we can't even, the whitewater's

1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:39.620
 gone.

1:26:39.620 --> 1:26:40.620
 There's nothing.

1:26:40.620 --> 1:26:41.620
 It's literally all blue.

1:26:41.620 --> 1:26:42.620
 So now you go.

1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:46.860
 And I remember telling the guy in my backseat, like a dude, I'm, I don't know about you,

1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:51.740
 but I'm pretty weirded out because this is, I mean, you know, I had at the time like 30

1:26:51.740 --> 1:26:52.740
 some hundred hours of flying.

1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:53.740
 I'd been doing it for 18 years.

1:26:53.740 --> 1:26:55.740
 It's nothing like anything you've seen.

1:26:55.740 --> 1:26:56.740
 No, no.

1:26:56.740 --> 1:27:00.900
 So as we turn, we go, well, let's just go back, you know, because now I got to put on

1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:06.340
 my real hat, which we have to train because we're getting ready to deploy to overseas.

1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:07.440
 So we got to get our training done.

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:10.700
 So that's my mindset, especially as a CEO, cause I got to get, I got to get training

1:27:10.700 --> 1:27:13.100
 out of the flight time because I'm responsible to do that.

1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:14.540
 So, Hey, let's go back.

1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:19.100
 And the, the, the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine squadron.

1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:22.580
 And so Cheeks is at the, he's listening to all this happen, you know, cause he's just

1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:25.780
 like, cause he, they, when he first went out, they were going to do him, but the little

1:27:25.780 --> 1:27:30.960
 Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F18Cs don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets.

1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:33.260
 So he had launched first and they were going to do him.

1:27:33.260 --> 1:27:36.140
 And then when they knew we were off the deck, they just told him, hey, go to your cap point

1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:42.100
 down South, and we're going to send, we'll pass this off to the Super Hornets.

1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:43.460
 What's a cap point by the way?

1:27:43.460 --> 1:27:44.460
 That's where we hold.

1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:46.700
 So it's called a combat air patrol point.

1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:48.180
 So we're just going to hold at one end.

1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:49.900
 He's going to hold at the other end.

1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:53.500
 It's kind of like, Hey, you guys are going to get, it's, it's, if it's a football field,

1:27:53.500 --> 1:27:54.720
 we're going to sit on one goal line.

1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:55.900
 He's going to sit on the other goal line.

1:27:55.900 --> 1:27:58.660
 And when they say go, we're going to run at each other and then try and do something in

1:27:58.660 --> 1:28:01.020
 the middle of the field and then go back to our set reset points.

1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:02.020
 Okay.

1:28:02.020 --> 1:28:03.020
 So you're talking to him.

1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:05.520
 He's, he's, he's listening to the, he's just listening.

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:06.520
 We don't talk to him at all.

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:07.520
 He's just listening.

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:08.520
 He just dials up.

1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:09.520
 Cause they know that we all know the frequencies.

1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:12.860
 So he's listening to what's going on because he's like, cause they canceled training.

1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:13.860
 So what else is he going to do?

1:28:13.860 --> 1:28:16.700
 He's just going to hang out there and do circles while he's waiting for him and his wingman.

1:28:16.700 --> 1:28:18.820
 So they just, they're listening to all this go on.

1:28:18.820 --> 1:28:20.340
 And then at this point you move on.

1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:21.340
 Yeah.

1:28:21.340 --> 1:28:22.340
 We come back up to train.

1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:24.220
 We go back as we're flying back the controller.

1:28:24.220 --> 1:28:28.780
 Cause we're talking to the kid on the Princeton, the, the, uh, the, uh, they're called OSs

1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:29.780
 or operations specialists.

1:28:29.780 --> 1:28:34.220
 They're the ones that run the radars and we're talking to him and he's like, Hey, sir, you're

1:28:34.220 --> 1:28:35.220
 not going to believe this.

1:28:35.220 --> 1:28:37.060
 He's like, that thing is at your cap.

1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:38.060
 It showed back up.

1:28:38.060 --> 1:28:39.060
 It just popped up.

1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:40.060
 You know what I mean?

1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:41.060
 This is like 60 miles away.

1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:42.060
 It just reappears.

1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:43.060
 We're like, Oh, okay.

1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:44.060
 So we got the radars out.

1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:45.060
 We're looking for it.

1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:46.060
 Uh, we get out there.

1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:47.060
 We never see it.

1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:48.060
 We never see it again.

1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:49.240
 Uh, we do what we need to do.

1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:50.240
 We come back to the ship.

1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:53.020
 Of course, now we're like, Oh, this is going to be, we're going to, you know, I told him,

1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:56.060
 I told him, I go, dude, you know, we're going to catch, we're going to catch shit for this.

1:28:56.060 --> 1:28:59.500
 When we get back to the ship, word's going to get out and we're just going to catch maximum

1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:00.500
 shit.

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:01.500
 And we did.

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:05.500
 We were joking, you know, so the ship plays movies, we have movies on the boat and they

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:06.660
 do 12 hours of movies.

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:08.540
 So they repeat cause there's a day check and a night check.

1:29:08.540 --> 1:29:10.560
 So the same movies in the morning and night play.

1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:14.860
 So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy

1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:16.580
 cause I'll watch stuff on TV that way too.

1:29:16.580 --> 1:29:19.660
 I'll be like, Oh, Hey, I've seen this and it, I'll jump into a movie in the middle and

1:29:19.660 --> 1:29:23.660
 then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning and I'll put it all together, uh,

1:29:23.660 --> 1:29:24.660
 because that's how we have to do it.

1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:25.660
 Cause we're so busy.

1:29:25.660 --> 1:29:34.020
 Well, the movies became, and I, it was men in black, aliens, uh, uh, independence day.

1:29:34.020 --> 1:29:40.460
 Definitely going to catch some shit, but let, let, uh, let me just ask some dumb questions.

1:29:40.460 --> 1:29:45.860
 So just take him, cause it's whatever, whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened,

1:29:45.860 --> 1:29:55.260
 it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, um, events in recent history.

1:29:55.260 --> 1:30:00.180
 So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about it, different kinds of angles.

1:30:00.180 --> 1:30:03.660
 There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here.

1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:10.540
 Uh, so first of all, you mentioned, see, you saw at some point X, Y, and then, uh, somebody

1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:13.780
 in the Princeton said, you're not going to believe this, sir.

1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:16.320
 It's at your cap point that that's a different place.

1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:18.340
 How the heck did it know what your cap point is?

1:30:18.340 --> 1:30:19.340
 That's a good question.

1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:23.980
 And that's the one of you to no one, you know, you don't, we don't tell it, we don't broadcast

1:30:23.980 --> 1:30:27.300
 it, we have a waypoint in the system, but I don't know.

1:30:27.300 --> 1:30:28.300
 Maybe it knew where we were going.

1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:33.140
 Cause we use the same one day after day after day, but it, it obviously knew, but you never

1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:34.380
 saw it there.

1:30:34.380 --> 1:30:35.380
 Never saw it there.

1:30:35.380 --> 1:30:39.480
 Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed, we told them, Hey, look, we just,

1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:40.480
 we just chased this thing.

1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:41.480
 They're like, what?

1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:42.480
 I got to chase it.

1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:46.740
 And they're like, well, I go, dude, and I go, and I told him, I said, dude, get video.

1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:48.500
 And he goes, and so, and that's how he is.

1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:49.500
 He's like, I'm going to go.

1:30:49.500 --> 1:30:52.420
 And he, he was, he, he was determined that he was going to find this thing.

1:30:52.420 --> 1:30:56.940
 So when you look at his video, and this is the stuff that isn't out, that they don't

1:30:56.940 --> 1:30:59.740
 see because not all the, all you see is the FLIR tape.

1:30:59.740 --> 1:31:02.580
 That's the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver.

1:31:02.580 --> 1:31:05.980
 I'll probably overlay the video for people to see.

1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:10.580
 When he goes out, it's you know, what he's looking at on his displays is he has basically

1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:12.460
 two radar displays up.

1:31:12.460 --> 1:31:16.620
 He has azimuth and range on the right one, and he has azimuth and elevation on the left

1:31:16.620 --> 1:31:17.620
 one.

1:31:17.620 --> 1:31:18.620
 So this is called the Azel display.

1:31:18.620 --> 1:31:22.780
 And this is called, this is basically the PPI, which is the, you're at the bottom of

1:31:22.780 --> 1:31:23.780
 it.

1:31:23.780 --> 1:31:24.780
 You're at the bottom of the square.

1:31:24.780 --> 1:31:25.900
 It's really taken this.

1:31:25.900 --> 1:31:30.100
 It's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares

1:31:30.100 --> 1:31:31.100
 it out.

1:31:31.100 --> 1:31:34.740
 So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us because they do this.

1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:35.740
 They square it off.

1:31:35.740 --> 1:31:39.560
 So, so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it because when

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:40.700
 he's not trying to lock it.

1:31:40.700 --> 1:31:44.560
 So the radar is just throwing energy out and getting it, you know, it's a Doppler radar.

1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:46.100
 So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing.

1:31:46.100 --> 1:31:47.460
 It's going, oh, I can see you.

1:31:47.460 --> 1:31:48.740
 And it's looking for return.

1:31:48.740 --> 1:31:49.820
 So he gets a return.

1:31:49.820 --> 1:31:52.780
 So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square, unless it

1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:55.860
 builds a track file on it, but a little green square is just sitting there.

1:31:55.860 --> 1:32:00.140
 It's not moving because it's, it's sitting in one spot in space.

1:32:00.140 --> 1:32:01.940
 He locks it up when he goes to lock it up.

1:32:01.940 --> 1:32:05.320
 Now he's putting a bunch of energy on it, but he's telling the radar, stare down that

1:32:05.320 --> 1:32:08.900
 line of sight and whatever's there, I want you to grab it and build a track file on it,

1:32:08.900 --> 1:32:13.820
 which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going.

1:32:13.820 --> 1:32:14.820
 Okay.

1:32:14.820 --> 1:32:18.580
 So the radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with,

1:32:18.580 --> 1:32:21.780
 it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed.

1:32:21.780 --> 1:32:25.460
 So that's all it is, is you send a signal out, something, it manipulates the signal

1:32:25.460 --> 1:32:29.360
 either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back and the radar was smart

1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:33.060
 enough to go, that is not a return that I'm expecting.

1:32:33.060 --> 1:32:34.060
 Something's messing with me.

1:32:34.060 --> 1:32:35.060
 I'm being jammed.

1:32:35.060 --> 1:32:38.280
 And it shows you and it puts strobes up, it gives these lines on the radar and it does

1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:39.280
 some stuff.

1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:43.460
 So you can mean, well, it does, it goes full into, it's being jammed at about every mode

1:32:43.460 --> 1:32:47.500
 you can possibly see because everything comes up and this aspect gets along, it's all kinds

1:32:47.500 --> 1:32:50.800
 of, I don't want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed.

1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:51.800
 So and it's what it does.

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:54.420
 As you said on Rogan, by the way, that jamming is an act of war, right?

1:32:54.420 --> 1:32:57.980
 Active jamming is, when you actively jam another platform, yes, it's technically an act of

1:32:57.980 --> 1:32:58.980
 war.

1:32:58.980 --> 1:33:01.020
 It feels like you should be freaking out at this point, I mean.

1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:05.860
 So well, he does it and then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle, they

1:33:05.860 --> 1:33:09.620
 have their side stick controllers so they can control all the sensors and they can just

1:33:09.620 --> 1:33:10.880
 toggle around and do stuff.

1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:15.660
 So he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that azimuth

1:33:15.660 --> 1:33:17.780
 elevation on the radar to the targeting pod.

1:33:17.780 --> 1:33:22.460
 Well, as soon as he commanded the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes,

1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:23.460
 oh, what's over there?

1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:25.860
 And it'll stare because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked

1:33:25.860 --> 1:33:27.060
 together.

1:33:27.060 --> 1:33:30.140
 You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up.

1:33:30.140 --> 1:33:34.200
 So when he castles over, it's a switch, it looks like a castle switch, what's a castle?

1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:38.180
 So when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead

1:33:38.180 --> 1:33:41.500
 of looking at the radar, I want to look at the targeting pod, he sees it on the targeting

1:33:41.500 --> 1:33:44.020
 pod because the targeting pod's already looking there.

1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:47.540
 And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out, he's

1:33:47.540 --> 1:33:52.980
 just receiving IR energy from the tic tac and then the system itself will track the

1:33:52.980 --> 1:33:56.180
 pixels and the contrast differences, it depends on what mode you're in.

1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:58.780
 So it says, oh, and that's where those little bars you see in the video where the bars come

1:33:58.780 --> 1:33:59.780
 up left and right.

1:33:59.780 --> 1:34:02.120
 There's doing some vision based tracking.

1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:03.860
 That's exactly what it is.

1:34:03.860 --> 1:34:06.300
 So and then he goes through.

1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:08.580
 Changes zooms, changes the mode.

1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:11.460
 He goes through all the modes, so there's a narrow, medium and wide.

1:34:11.460 --> 1:34:14.420
 So wide is far away, medium and then narrow.

1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:18.500
 And then there's the TV mode and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode.

1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:25.860
 The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode is only medium TV mode.

1:34:25.860 --> 1:34:28.300
 So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode.

1:34:28.300 --> 1:34:32.180
 It's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode.

1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:35.020
 So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background

1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:36.020
 to a white background.

1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:37.260
 So you can figure out what the heck is this?

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:40.740
 Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on the different modes

1:34:40.740 --> 1:34:45.300
 instead of just staring at it going, what is that thing?

1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:50.140
 So the video has been out, it actually was on YouTube for years before the government

1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:51.140
 released it.

1:34:51.140 --> 1:34:54.460
 It was leaked in 2007?

1:34:54.460 --> 1:35:00.560
 No, the guy that was in my backseat sent me an email and I had retired.

1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:05.020
 So this is about, nope, because I was working down in San Diego.

1:35:05.020 --> 1:35:15.300
 So this is about 2008, early 2009, he sends me a link to strangeland.com, which is not

1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:16.300
 suitable for work.

1:35:16.300 --> 1:35:18.260
 Oh yeah, it's top notch.

1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:24.300
 And he says, I can remember the email, hey Skip, does this look familiar?

1:35:24.300 --> 1:35:29.940
 And I look at it, I'm like, how the hell did that get on strangeland.com?

1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:35.300
 So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube

1:35:35.300 --> 1:35:36.620
 link to someone.

1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:40.620
 You don't send strangeland.com to someone because you don't know what you're going to

1:35:40.620 --> 1:35:41.620
 get.

1:35:41.620 --> 1:35:42.620
 It's like Googling kittens.

1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:47.140
 So it ends up there somehow.

1:35:47.140 --> 1:35:50.940
 So it gets on YouTube, which was cool because I would go out with my friends and we'd be

1:35:50.940 --> 1:35:53.780
 drinking and they go, dude, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying?

1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:55.420
 It's kind of like you were asking what it's like.

1:35:55.420 --> 1:35:58.140
 And I go, oh dude, I chased a UFO and they're like, get out.

1:35:58.140 --> 1:35:59.140
 And I'm like, no, serious.

1:35:59.140 --> 1:36:01.100
 This is literally how it happened.

1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:03.040
 So I was sitting with my friend Matt.

1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:07.420
 So Matt and I did our, he was the guy in my right seat of the A6 when I did my very first

1:36:07.420 --> 1:36:08.800
 night trap.

1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:11.060
 And we were friends to this day.

1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:15.660
 Because when you do stuff like people like that, I had to have faith in him, he had to

1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:20.980
 have faith in me, they become like your brother.

1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:24.860
 And these are guys that literally, I don't talk to them on a regular basis, like Chris

1:36:24.860 --> 1:36:26.600
 who works at Apple.

1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.580
 If Chris called me up tomorrow and said, dude, I need help.

1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:30.580
 I need this.

1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:32.540
 I'd be like, all right, let's figure this out and let's do it.

1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:34.660
 Because it's, they're like family, you do it.

1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:38.940
 And most Navy guys, we don't send letters to each other weekly.

1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:43.180
 You know, I have friends that I haven't talked to in 10 years that they showed up on my door,

1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:47.220
 you know, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer, shoot the shit, take about first 10 minutes

1:36:47.220 --> 1:36:48.220
 to catch up.

1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:51.820
 And then it's like old times and it's amazing how fast it's happened.

1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:57.780
 So I'm out to dinner with Matt and I'm telling him this story and he's like, get out of here.

1:36:57.780 --> 1:37:05.480
 So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco, Paco has fightersweep.com, it's a blog site.

1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:09.700
 So Paco's obsessed, like he is way into UFOs.

1:37:09.700 --> 1:37:12.700
 So Paco calls me up, he says, dude, I was talking to Matty.

1:37:12.700 --> 1:37:13.700
 That's what we call him.

1:37:13.700 --> 1:37:14.700
 He goes, I was talking to Matty.

1:37:14.700 --> 1:37:18.460
 He goes, dude, you got to tell me this story.

1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:19.460
 So I'm like, all right.

1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:24.020
 I'm going to spend a chunk of time and so he calls me one day and I'm like, I got to

1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:25.020
 get a voicemail.

1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:26.020
 Hey, give me a call.

1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:29.540
 So I call him up and he answers the phone, but I could hear people in the background

1:37:29.540 --> 1:37:30.540
 and I go, hey dude, what's going on?

1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:31.540
 He goes, hang on, hang on.

1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:32.540
 I got to put you on speakerphone.

1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:33.540
 I go, what are you putting me on speakerphone?

1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:34.540
 He goes, you got to tell the story.

1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:36.420
 I'm having a dinner party.

1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:37.420
 You got to tell the story.

1:37:37.420 --> 1:37:40.100
 So he's literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table

1:37:40.100 --> 1:37:42.440
 as I tell a Tic Tac story.

1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:43.440
 So he calls me up again.

1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.260
 He says, hey, I got this blog and he just writes about fighter stuff.

1:37:48.260 --> 1:37:50.500
 Like he wrote about that we call them the shit hot break.

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:53.940
 That's a guy that when you're laying on a carrier, comes in, turns and gets ready to

1:37:53.940 --> 1:37:54.940
 land really fast.

1:37:54.940 --> 1:37:59.840
 Like breaks it off right at the back of the ship and one of the guys, when we were junior

1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:04.220
 officers on the USS Ranger, one of the department heads in the other squadron is a guy, Nasty.

1:38:04.220 --> 1:38:08.780
 And Nasty was notorious for coming in in a Tomcat and cranking off the shit hot break.

1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:13.700
 So he literally wrote a thing about the shit hot break with Nasty and there's another guy,

1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:20.380
 Mav, was one of our landing signals officers for the air wing.

1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:24.980
 It's a good article on how this was and how it kind of forms you in Naval Aviation, kind

1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:26.420
 of being part of the club.

1:38:26.420 --> 1:38:28.180
 So he's like, I got to write about this thing.

1:38:28.180 --> 1:38:29.980
 I'm like, what do you guys, I got to write about it.

1:38:29.980 --> 1:38:30.980
 I go, all right.

1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:31.980
 Because at first I would say no.

1:38:31.980 --> 1:38:32.980
 I'm like, dude, I don't want this out there.

1:38:32.980 --> 1:38:33.980
 Just.

1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:36.500
 So you haven't really before then talked about it much.

1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:38.860
 My wife didn't even really know the whole story.

1:38:38.860 --> 1:38:39.860
 Why?

1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:42.700
 Just as a comment, is it just because you caught some.

1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:47.300
 You know, it was just, I'll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two

1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:48.300
 days.

1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:49.300
 They played the goofy movies.

1:38:49.300 --> 1:38:52.260
 There's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule that they would put.

1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:56.460
 It was like first one was a far side and the second one was me and the guy in my back seat

1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:59.820
 and it was men in black, but it had our names, you know, protecting protecting the Nimitz

1:38:59.820 --> 1:39:00.820
 battle group type stuff.

1:39:00.820 --> 1:39:03.820
 It's just funny shit like that.

1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:06.180
 So to me it wasn't that big of a deal.

1:39:06.180 --> 1:39:07.180
 It was like, okay, that's weird.

1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:08.820
 We're never going to know what it was.

1:39:08.820 --> 1:39:12.340
 I want to get out there because this is important because there's all kinds of rumors.

1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:15.380
 There's a group of folks there.

1:39:15.380 --> 1:39:20.460
 No one ever came out in suits to talk to us.

1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:22.060
 Nobody looking like me.

1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:26.140
 No came out on a, no, no one came out of the helicopter.

1:39:26.140 --> 1:39:28.220
 No one came out on an airplane.

1:39:28.220 --> 1:39:31.060
 You know, you get, oh, I was told to turn over this classified.

1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:36.060
 What's funny is all the COs and several of them are still in the Navy.

1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:38.660
 There's one that is a, he, I think he just finished up.

1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:40.980
 He was a captain of an aircraft carrier.

1:39:40.980 --> 1:39:44.180
 You know, so he'll end up making Admiral and all that stuff.

1:39:44.180 --> 1:39:45.180
 Those guys are all my friends.

1:39:45.180 --> 1:39:47.220
 I talk to them daily.

1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:48.220
 Just to clarify.

1:39:48.220 --> 1:39:56.100
 So just for people who don't know, there's a story that both on the Nimitz and the Princeton

1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:59.140
 folks in a helicopter landed.

1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:02.400
 They showed up, they took the data, quote unquote.

1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:09.460
 So all the sort of recordings associated with this incident and they took it and presumably

1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:10.460
 deleted it.

1:40:10.460 --> 1:40:13.180
 So there's a kind of story to that.

1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:19.060
 And then from what I've seen, you said that you believe, just like we were talking about

1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:24.420
 offline, that jokes spread faster than, or just rumors spread faster than anything on

1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:29.100
 these ships, that it might've been a joke that started and.

1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:30.220
 Well, they did.

1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:31.740
 So here's the joke.

1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:33.120
 So they had come down, right?

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.100
 We had the tapes and they were Chad's tapes.

1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:39.320
 So we use those tapes over and over again.

1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:42.940
 They're consumable, but remember, I have a budget as a squadron, so I have a budget.

1:40:42.940 --> 1:40:47.060
 So I have to buy those tapes, all that stuff that we use, I'm accountable for.

1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:50.940
 And the tapes are actually classified secret because of the data that's on them.

1:40:50.940 --> 1:40:52.460
 So we had the tapes.

1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:59.100
 So the intelligence guys, the intel officers came down from what's called Civic, CVIC,

1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:03.820
 which is Carrier Intel Center, came down and said, hey, we need the tapes.

1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:07.060
 These guys are gonna come, they're gonna come and get them.

1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:09.420
 So we're like, I'm like, oh, whatever.

1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:15.340
 So we hand them the tapes and then someone, because I have, you know people, shortly after

1:41:15.340 --> 1:41:18.820
 they came and got the tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they're messing

1:41:18.820 --> 1:41:20.820
 with you, they're playing a joke.

1:41:20.820 --> 1:41:26.340
 So I said, oh, well, let's see how well that goes because I'm a CO and they're not.

1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:31.020
 So I went down to Civic and it was a, I think he was a Lieutenant or Lieutenant JG, so he's

1:41:31.020 --> 1:41:32.020
 way junior to me.

1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:37.460
 And I said, hey, I want my tapes back and he looks at me and I go, I know you guys are

1:41:37.460 --> 1:41:38.460
 pulling my leg.

1:41:38.460 --> 1:41:40.100
 I know there's no one came out.

1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:43.420
 And I go, and you have about 30 seconds to get me my tapes before I start tearing this

1:41:43.420 --> 1:41:44.420
 place apart.

1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:46.420
 That's literally what I told him.

1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:50.780
 And I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it's not gonna

1:41:50.780 --> 1:41:52.020
 go well.

1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:54.540
 I said, because this is bullshit and I need those tapes.

1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:57.940
 Then he literally walked right over to a filing cabinet, opened it up, they weren't in a safe.

1:41:57.940 --> 1:42:00.700
 He opened up a filing cabinet and pulled them out and handed them to me.

1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:05.220
 I said, and I basically said a few things to him, like, don't ever fuck with me again.

1:42:05.220 --> 1:42:07.100
 And I left, I had the tapes.

1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:08.540
 So this, no one came out.

1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:11.380
 There's no flying going on when all this is happening.

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:15.260
 And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes.

1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:19.640
 So I took two brand new eight mil tapes and I copied the sections that I want.

1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:23.380
 So there's a rumor or two that, oh, the original FLIR video is 10 minutes long and there's

1:42:23.380 --> 1:42:26.340
 some, one of these petty officers is saying, I saw it, that's total crap.

1:42:26.340 --> 1:42:28.480
 The original video is about a minute, 30 seconds long.

1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:31.740
 What you see on the release video is the entire video.

1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:38.220
 So you have mentioned, I apologize if I say stupid things, please correct me, but you

1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:45.620
 have mentioned that, like on Roguen, I think that you watched it on a bigger screen.

1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:47.740
 It felt like it was higher definition.

1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:55.220
 So let me ask the question, is there a higher definition version, do you think, of the FLIR

1:42:55.220 --> 1:43:01.620
 video that would give us more pixels and more information presumably because of the high

1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.620
 number of.

1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:03.620
 I would doubt it.

1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:05.980
 Because I don't know where, the stuff that the government released, I don't know where

1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:06.980
 they got it.

1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:07.980
 Okay.

1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:11.140
 So the stuff that was on Strangeland and YouTube, someone pulled off of a secret, it looks like

1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:12.140
 a rack.

1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:15.300
 There's tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard

1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:19.100
 drive and they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube.

1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:24.700
 No, it's just like, anytime, even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there's

1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:27.060
 some quality that gets, it degrades.

1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:29.000
 So this, you don't know how many times this has been copied.

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.580
 So we were looking, the videos I've seen are right off the original, they're Hi8 tapes,

1:43:32.580 --> 1:43:35.860
 it's basically pulled off the back of the display, so it's not filmed with cameras,

1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:39.560
 it's literally a digital feed that's pulled off the back and put onto a Hi8 tape.

1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:40.800
 That's how the recorders work.

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:44.540
 Now it's actually digital to digital, it's not even on tapes anymore, it's a digital

1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:47.580
 recording system, but we were still in that process of slowly, because originally we had

1:43:47.580 --> 1:43:52.140
 little cameras here that shine, so if the light hit, it would wash out the displays.

1:43:52.140 --> 1:43:57.460
 So it's a pretty good feed, when you put it on, so instead of looking at it on your tiny

1:43:57.460 --> 1:44:02.260
 little computer monitor or whatever, I'm looking at it on like a 19 inch, because it was still

1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:06.260
 normal TVs back there, we had just put flat screens in the ready room that I had bought,

1:44:06.260 --> 1:44:07.420
 so we could watch movies.

1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:11.220
 A nice, huge 19 inch screen.

1:44:11.220 --> 1:44:13.820
 It's maybe 20, it was nice.

1:44:13.820 --> 1:44:14.820
 Wow, that's huge.

1:44:14.820 --> 1:44:15.820
 It was gigantic.

1:44:15.820 --> 1:44:20.980
 I can get for like 50 bucks, you can get like 60 inches.

1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:23.380
 This is 2005.

1:44:23.380 --> 1:44:25.820
 So you look at it as this big thing.

1:44:25.820 --> 1:44:28.940
 You could see, so when you get to the TV mode, when I say there's little things coming out

1:44:28.940 --> 1:44:30.620
 of the bottom of it, you could see those.

1:44:30.620 --> 1:44:32.320
 It was very clear.

1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:38.620
 But in terms of the actual visual on the Tic Tac, did you get much more information from

1:44:38.620 --> 1:44:40.700
 the higher, from the clear?

1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:41.700
 Little things out of the bottom.

1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:42.700
 We didn't see those visuals.

1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:43.700
 So the bottom information.

1:44:43.700 --> 1:44:44.700
 I got it.

1:44:44.700 --> 1:44:47.060
 So when you see it, because he's coming almost coaltitude with it, you can see the bottom

1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:48.060
 of it.

1:44:48.060 --> 1:44:50.380
 It looks like little, you know, like if you look at a Cessna, there's little antennas

1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:51.380
 hanging out of the bottom.

1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:52.380
 Kind of like that.

1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:53.800
 There was two little things out of the bottom.

1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:54.800
 There's nothing on the top.

1:44:54.800 --> 1:45:00.380
 There was no plume, no IR, no visible propulsions, even heat signature.

1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:01.580
 You know, it's all that stuff.

1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:06.260
 And then the other thing that people didn't see is they didn't see the radar display,

1:45:06.260 --> 1:45:10.040
 which that really raises a classification of it, especially to see what the radar does

1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:12.620
 when it's being jammed.

1:45:12.620 --> 1:45:15.820
 You know, matter of fact, when they did the unofficial official investigation in about

1:45:15.820 --> 1:45:21.060
 2000 and let me think about 2009.

1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:27.540
 I got a call on my cell phone from a guy who government employee and said, hey, he told

1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:28.540
 me who he was.

1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:30.140
 He's still in the government.

1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:31.140
 I'm friends with him.

1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:35.580
 And he said, hey, we're going to investigate your Tic Tac thing.

1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:37.500
 This is literally five years later.

1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:38.500
 Yeah.

1:45:38.500 --> 1:45:39.620
 Five years later.

1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:41.220
 And I said, OK, whatever.

1:45:41.220 --> 1:45:42.220
 And he did a pretty good job.

1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:48.500
 I caught the unofficial official report because it was really never official.

1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:49.740
 It wasn't.

1:45:49.740 --> 1:45:54.500
 But I'll give you the history of why I say that and why it never came out in FOIA requests.

1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:55.540
 So he does the report.

1:45:55.540 --> 1:45:56.740
 He sent me the report.

1:45:56.740 --> 1:45:58.660
 And all he said is, hey, I'm going to send you this report.

1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:01.220
 Please don't distribute this report.

1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:02.620
 I said, OK.

1:46:02.620 --> 1:46:06.800
 The report is now out because Harry Reid got it to George Knapp and they were good enough

1:46:06.800 --> 1:46:07.800
 to redact it.

1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:11.100
 But there's a few versions of it unredacted and I'm very protective of the other people

1:46:11.100 --> 1:46:13.240
 that were involved in this.

1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:15.500
 So Jim has talked, but he's off the grid.

1:46:15.500 --> 1:46:17.380
 He doesn't talk to anyone now.

1:46:17.380 --> 1:46:21.980
 The pilot of his airplane, she has come out on unidentified, but they don't release her

1:46:21.980 --> 1:46:23.260
 name, although people are starting to do it.

1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:25.140
 And she's had weird shit happen around her house.

1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:29.340
 She's got kids, you know, so I'm very protective of her.

1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:32.580
 And I've told people like Jeremy and George, if I know that the names ever came from you,

1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:34.580
 I will never talk to you again about this.

1:46:34.580 --> 1:46:36.000
 And Jeremy's been really good about it.

1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:37.540
 And so is George.

1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:43.900
 And then, but George knew who the names were because he got the report from Senator Reid.

1:46:43.900 --> 1:46:44.900
 And then the other crew.

1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:51.820
 So the pilot of the airplane that took the video that Chad was in, if you talk to that

1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:53.820
 individual, they really don't have the recollection.

1:46:53.820 --> 1:46:58.300
 They were just out flying that day and it wasn't a big deal.

1:46:58.300 --> 1:47:01.780
 So it's you need to protect because not everyone wants people knocking.

1:47:01.780 --> 1:47:05.600
 I don't want people knocking on my door and, you know, and there's rumors are you talk

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:06.600
 to everyone.

1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:10.020
 You know, you're about the 23rd person that I've talked to total.

1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:13.340
 And that includes, you know, the newspapers and stuff.

1:47:13.340 --> 1:47:17.540
 And I've been selective because there's so much, I mean, if I turned down like, I turned

1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:18.540
 down Russian TV.

1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:21.660
 I can give you her name when we're done here.

1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:24.940
 She called, she not only called me, she called my wife, she called my daughter, she called

1:47:24.940 --> 1:47:28.380
 my son and she called my son in law because they're persistent.

1:47:28.380 --> 1:47:30.380
 So I'm pretty protected.

1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:31.380
 I'm very particular.

1:47:31.380 --> 1:47:34.080
 I mean, the reason I'm talking to you is because I knew we would have a conversation that wasn't

1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:37.780
 based just on the tic tac and the incident, but we can actually talk about some of the

1:47:37.780 --> 1:47:42.740
 science and some of the theoretical to get into, to get more people involved to go.

1:47:42.740 --> 1:47:48.020
 Cause I think there's, you know, and when you talk to, you know, Lou Elizondo or Chris

1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:55.580
 Mellon, you know, the group at TTSA, you know, that whole thing, that's to the stars Academy.

1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:57.260
 That's the Tom DeLonge group that got started.

1:47:57.260 --> 1:48:02.860
 So you go, well, you know, cause I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this, but he's

1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:07.500
 actually, when you talk to him, he's, he's, he's very smart and I asked him, how'd you

1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:08.500
 get into this?

1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:12.260
 And he goes, oh, when I was traveling around with Blink 182, he goes, you read a lot of

1:48:12.260 --> 1:48:16.480
 books when you're laying in a van as you're driving to your next gig before you make it

1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:17.480
 big.

1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:20.300
 And he goes, and he read, he was reading books and he read one of them on UFOs.

1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:21.300
 I'm trying to think of the title.

1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:23.740
 That's one of the big ones that's out there real popular.

1:48:23.740 --> 1:48:29.900
 And so he started just, he started asking more and through his fame with Blink 182 in

1:48:29.900 --> 1:48:32.340
 the band, he got more and more connected.

1:48:32.340 --> 1:48:36.380
 You know, if you talk to Chris Mellon, who is an undersecretary of defense for intelligence

1:48:36.380 --> 1:48:43.160
 and he's part of the Mellon dynasty, you know, from Carnegie Mellon type, very, very smart.

1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:47.700
 He knows, he, he, he definitely knows how the government works cause he worked there.

1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:53.740
 And so when I went down to DC to talk to people, he's one of the first people I'll go to.

1:48:53.740 --> 1:49:01.460
 When I did Tucker Carlson about a month ago, month and a half ago, I asked, he texted me,

1:49:01.460 --> 1:49:05.820
 I texted him, Tom, Lou to go, Hey, cause they were like, you gotta do it.

1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:11.060
 Cause I turned to, I turned Tucker down a couple of times before and his, his producer

1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:14.100
 had called me and I'm like, all right, I'll do it.

1:49:14.100 --> 1:49:16.220
 Because those guys like, you gotta, you gotta do this for us.

1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:19.260
 So from my perspective, just to give you some context.

1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:23.260
 So to me, there seems to be some stigma.

1:49:23.260 --> 1:49:27.140
 So I come from the scientific community and I really appreciate you talking to me today.

1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:33.780
 And I think that people who listen to this include, you know, of faculty, fellow faculty

1:49:33.780 --> 1:49:36.020
 at MIT and major universities.

1:49:36.020 --> 1:49:43.380
 And it feels like there's some stigma to the subject from, from the scientific community.

1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:48.180
 A lot of people, especially when they hear your story are like, wow, this is really interesting,

1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:53.900
 but you, you don't even know you, one, you're afraid to talk about it.

1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:58.480
 And two, you don't know what the next steps are, like how can we seriously try to think

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:05.580
 about what you saw, how to think about how we further look for things like it, how we

1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:14.420
 develop systems and plans for how in the future we can immediately collect a lot more data

1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:23.140
 and try to react properly, you know, try to communicate, try to interpret this in the

1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:25.620
 best way possible from the scientific perspective.

1:50:25.620 --> 1:50:31.060
 And I, I just would love to remove stigma from this subject.

1:50:31.060 --> 1:50:37.420
 Well, I think that's the first step we have done in this country, an absolutely terrible

1:50:37.420 --> 1:50:38.480
 job with these things.

1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:42.000
 So you go, and I joke, you know, go back to Roswell.

1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.360
 So the first reports that came out of Roswell was we have this crash flying saucer.

1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:48.020
 That's literally what came out.

1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:51.300
 And then magically the next day it's a weather balloon and they're showing your pieces of

1:50:51.300 --> 1:50:55.380
 mylar and you go, well, that doesn't look like what they showed us yesterday.

1:50:55.380 --> 1:50:58.180
 Then you get into Project Blue Book, you know, so there's that whole series about Project

1:50:58.180 --> 1:50:59.180
 Blue Book.

1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:01.120
 But the bottom line of Project Blue Book is it really did two things.

1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:06.440
 It investigated sightings and it did everything it could to debunk and disprove to the point

1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:10.380
 where it actually went to discredit, you know, to make you look.

1:51:10.380 --> 1:51:15.560
 So there's always been this, I don't know if you'd call it an aura around it or a mystique

1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:19.020
 about UFOs that if you're talking about them, they're nuts.

1:51:19.020 --> 1:51:23.160
 With ours, because I'm not a UFO guy, I'm not a junkie.

1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:29.440
 If you ask me, do I believe that there's life outside of Earth, I would say you probably

1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:34.760
 have a better chance of winning the mega ball lottery than we're the only planet that has

1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:36.840
 life on it in the universe.

1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:38.580
 The odds are against it.

1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:44.280
 If you do just do the math, you have to accept, because there only has to be one other planet

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:48.300
 that has life on it and then I win and you lose.

1:51:48.300 --> 1:51:52.280
 And then more and more science is showing that there's habitable planets out there,

1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:56.040
 that yeah, everything we've learned so far, we know very little, but everything we've

1:51:56.040 --> 1:52:03.480
 learned so far about the planets out there, exoplanets, Earth like planets, it seems that

1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:06.720
 it's very likely that there's life out there.

1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:08.960
 Intelligent life is another topic, but life.

1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:13.760
 Well, we as humans, you know, and even more as Americans, we have this hubris about us

1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:18.680
 that says, ha ha, we're it and you go, not so much.

1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:20.980
 Maybe we're not so intelligent.

1:52:20.980 --> 1:52:22.840
 Because we are, it's just how we learn.

1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:28.760
 So our main mode of transportation and what people figured out years ago was the internal

1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:33.060
 combustion engine, which led us to jet engines and solid rocket fuel.

1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:39.320
 What if you're in another planet where you figured out the ability to create a gravity

1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:43.240
 field or you used, you know, because electromagnetics are becoming bigger and bigger and bigger,

1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:48.560
 you know, catapults on ships were steam powered and the new Gerald Ford is electromagnetic.

1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.840
 Roller coasters used to use a chain to get you to the top of the hill.

1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:53.920
 Now they shoot you with electromagnetics and you're going.

1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:57.760
 So there's a whole new realm of propulsion that, you know, sometimes it's our ability

1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:00.480
 to develop the technology to support theory.

1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:05.800
 You know, we are just now proving, you know, recently theories that Einstein had where

1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:07.080
 people actually joked about them.

1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:10.560
 And now we actually have the technology to prove that gravity can bend light.

1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:12.000
 You know, we've proven that.

1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.600
 So you look at that way and you go, well, does that mean that, you know, 70 years ago

1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:17.920
 Einstein was wrong or 80 years ago Einstein was wrong?

1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:22.260
 Or do you go, we just didn't have the ability to look that deep into space to actually find

1:53:22.260 --> 1:53:24.600
 something that we could, to actually measure.

1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:25.600
 And you know, and I've seen this stuff.

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:29.040
 And that's just a hundred years and the kind of things that can happen in a few centuries.

1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:30.640
 Look what we've done in the last 20 years.

1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:31.640
 Yeah, it's crazy.

1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:35.600
 Let me direct, cause it's such an interesting topic from a career perspective, from a science

1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:43.280
 perspective, you're, I mean, you've spoken, you've been brave in, you know, telling your

1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:48.000
 story, not some dramatic thing, but just telling the things you've seen.

1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:53.080
 Did it encounter, did it impact your career?

1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:55.240
 Is that why more people haven't come out?

1:53:55.240 --> 1:54:03.380
 Like you've mentioned Roswell, like how, what advice do you give to people, to the community,

1:54:03.380 --> 1:54:11.480
 to me as a scientist for ways to go forward about this topic and still have a, you know,

1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:16.880
 not being put in a bin in society that he's a loon or she's a loon or that person.

1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:23.720
 Mine is to get away from the little green men, just divorce the two little green men.

1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:27.400
 And you know, and I've talked to Lou Elizondo about this, you know, and the group that they're

1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:28.400
 working with, which is incredible.

1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:32.960
 I mean, they've got Steve Justice who used to run Skunk Works where they built, you know,

1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:33.960
 projects.

1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:36.560
 Now, Lou Elizondo, as you mentioned, was a program director.

1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.520
 He ran the ATIP program at the Pentagon.

1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:45.220
 And ATIP was a program that was tasked with investigating any kind of UFOs, UAPs.

1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:49.640
 So what's funny is the unofficial official report that I joke about, the guy who wrote

1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:53.640
 the unofficial official report was actually an original member of ATIP.

1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:57.280
 And the original stuff that ATIP did was FOIA exempt.

1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:58.280
 And people go, how do you know that?

1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:03.040
 I go, because I stood there with the memo in my hand that said these are, it literally,

1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:05.600
 I watched the DOD memo that said it and it was signed.

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.120
 So he was one.

1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:09.600
 So that's why the, that's why I call it the unofficial official report.

1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.520
 It was never, it was never releasable because people go, oh, I put in a FOIA request and

1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:14.520
 I didn't get that.

1:55:14.520 --> 1:55:17.480
 I go, well, just because you put in a FOIA request and get it, I go, because how much,

1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:20.320
 how much time do you think that guy is going to spend to get you the information that you

1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:21.600
 requested if he can't find it?

1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:23.320
 I actually got called by the Navy.

1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:29.080
 I had a commander in the Navy call me about right before the article came out in the New

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.080
 York Times.

1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:33.000
 It was, this was starting to come back and she had called me because there's been, there

1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.480
 was a FOIA request for stuff about the Nimitz incident.

1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:38.000
 And I said, do you know of anything?

1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.680
 She called me, she goes, do you know of anything else besides the situation reports that come

1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:42.680
 off the ship?

1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:45.780
 And you know, and you got to remember when the situation report comes off the ship, that's

1:55:45.780 --> 1:55:46.780
 like third hand.

1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:50.880
 So we tell someone, they tell someone, that person has to write it up.

1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:54.180
 So there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it.

1:55:54.180 --> 1:55:56.760
 But then there's the unofficial official report that's actually pretty well written.

1:55:56.760 --> 1:55:59.360
 There's some errors in it, but it was, you know, I didn't help write it.

1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.400
 I just did it.

1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:03.720
 And he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who's who in the zoo and

1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:07.600
 the players.

1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:09.120
 So she called me and said, is there anything out there?

1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:10.720
 And I said, officially out there.

1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:11.720
 She said, yes.

1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:12.720
 I said, I don't know anything.

1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:16.720
 I knew of the unofficial official report, which is that one, but I'm not, you know,

1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:19.760
 if you don't know about it, I'm not going to tell you because it's not my job and nor

1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:20.760
 did I care.

1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:26.720
 I mean, did, in that whole situation, you mentioned Lou, I mean, did you think about

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.360
 your impact to your career?

1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:36.080
 Just to get back to the question, do you think others, other pilots, other thing, other people

1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:40.200
 like in the Roosevelt are thinking about this kind of thing, why aren't they talking about

1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:41.200
 this?

1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:42.680
 Why are people afraid to talk about this?

1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:46.200
 Well, honestly, the military and the press, there's a distrust.

1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:47.840
 I'll just tell you that right now.

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:52.920
 We typically don't like talking to the press because if I talk to you, you know, especially

1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:57.320
 when I do, even the TV shows, you know, cause I've been on a couple of shows, when you look

1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:00.840
 at it, you know, they come to my house and they film me for two hours.

1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:03.480
 And then what you see on the screen is five minutes.

1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:07.040
 Well, and the other thing with the press, let me give you my perspective from Autonomous

1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:12.340
 Vehicles is the clipping happens, yes.

1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:13.640
 But also the incompetence.

1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:17.880
 Let me just call out journalists.

1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:25.680
 They're not thinking, I mean, so here's the thing, I have a PhD and I've taken painfully

1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:32.200
 too many classes from like physics, math, and I also have a deep curiosity about the

1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:33.200
 world.

1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:34.640
 I read a lot.

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:36.000
 That seems to be missing with journalism.

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:40.920
 So you're talking to a person who is not going to push the story forward in an interesting

1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:47.600
 way, not the story, but the actual investigation of perhaps one of the most amazing things

1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:49.800
 that humans have witnessed in history.

1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:55.240
 Like you, it might've been nothing, who knows what you witnessed might've been from a sort

1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:59.360
 of debunking perspective, might've been some kind of trick of mind.

1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:05.840
 You and others have hallucinated something that could be some simple explanation, but

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:15.360
 possibly it was something not of this world and to not do justice to this story from a

1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:20.840
 scientific perspective, it seems at best negligence.

1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:25.340
 And so that's true for journalists, that's true for other scientists.

1:58:25.340 --> 1:58:28.360
 It's just a human nature.

1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:34.080
 If we see something that we can't explain, then sometimes if you just, eh, maybe it's

1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:40.040
 just me and you let it go away and you don't think about it, maybe it'll just, you ignore

1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:41.800
 it.

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.560
 The other side is the inquisitive mind that says, well, what was that?

1:58:44.560 --> 1:58:47.260
 And I want to dig more into it.

1:58:47.260 --> 1:58:53.920
 And if you look at it or you're going against the norm, you can get ostracized.

1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:57.320
 And if you look at, and Einstein's the perfect example, I mean, when he started coming up

1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:02.640
 with some of his theories, some of the top physicists in the world were like, dude, you're

1:59:02.640 --> 1:59:03.640
 a nut job.

1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:09.120
 He's, he's literally proving them, but he didn't have, you know, he proved them in theory,

1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:13.560
 but he didn't have the means to actually do the experiment to prove his theory.

1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:18.280
 There's a great book that I recommend people read called Proving Einstein Right by Jim

1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:25.380
 Gates that talks about like the hard work that people try to do years after to try to

1:59:25.380 --> 1:59:32.200
 experimentally validate the predictions that Einstein made with, with his theories.

1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:33.200
 It's fascinating.

1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:36.640
 But yes, at the time, it's kind of crazy what he's saying.

1:59:36.640 --> 1:59:37.640
 Yeah.

1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:40.320
 If you look at it back at the time, don't we, we look at it now and go, well, the guy

1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:44.800
 was a walking genius and he was, but if you go back in time when he was doing it, it was

1:59:44.800 --> 1:59:47.320
 like, what are you talking about?

1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:48.320
 You know?

1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:52.420
 But one of the challenges is your eyewitness.

1:59:52.420 --> 1:59:56.340
 One of the challenges is you're essentially an eyewitness account.

1:59:56.340 --> 1:59:58.760
 Like we don't have good data.

1:59:58.760 --> 2:00:03.920
 We have very limited data of the incident that you've experienced.

2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:10.880
 So let me kind of dig in, let me just ask some questions of maybe to see if there's,

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:13.120
 just to paint more and more of the picture.

2:00:13.120 --> 2:00:18.640
 One you kind of mentioned, so Tic Tac Shape, let's break apart two situations.

2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:19.920
 One is the video.

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:23.820
 Let's look at the actual eye account, the eyewitness account that you saw with your

2:00:23.820 --> 2:00:25.320
 own eyes.

2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:28.300
 What's the, what can you say about the shape of the thing?

2:00:28.300 --> 2:00:30.800
 Is there interesting aspects outside of the Tic Tac?

2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:33.300
 Like, is there any appendages?

2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:42.320
 Is there some texture to it that, no smooth white Tic Tac, you know, we don't, you don't

2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:50.680
 see there's no, no wings, no visible propulsion, no windows, no probes that we could see.

2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:53.800
 We don't notice, like I said, we don't see the little things on the bottom of it until

2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:59.760
 we see the video in the TV mode when it's zoomed in, right before it's shortly, you

2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:00.760
 kind of see them zoom in.

2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:05.840
 You don't see it typically on the YouTube stuff that's out there, or remember we're

2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:09.960
 looking at the original tape, so there's not, there's basically no degradation.

2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:12.680
 But when you saw with your eyes, there's no kind of appendages.

2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:13.680
 No, none.

2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:17.240
 What about, like somebody asked, a lot of people asked you questions.

2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:19.560
 So I appreciate you spending your time here.

2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:21.560
 Let me ask some of them.

2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.200
 Did you, I mean, you chased it, so we flew close to it, relatively speaking.

2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:30.160
 Was there, did you feel any wake?

2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:36.240
 Like any, did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction, like aerodynamically?

2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:37.240
 No.

2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:38.240
 Nothing.

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.240
 Nothing.

2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:46.580
 So another aspect of it, there's an interesting thing you've developed a feel for, for objects

2:01:46.580 --> 2:01:47.580
 in the air.

2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:53.160
 Did you feel like it was surprised by your arrival?

2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:56.080
 Or did it, let me ask a few questions around it.

2:01:56.080 --> 2:02:00.040
 So did you, did it feel like the thing was surprised?

2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:08.080
 Did it feel like it wanted to be seen, almost to show off its capability?

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:15.480
 And did it, what did it feel like relative to if you were doing a, an air fight against

2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:20.280
 a sort of like a, I don't know, a foreign jet?

2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:25.000
 So one, I think it, I think it knew we were there when we showed up.

2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000
 It's just, it's me.

2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:28.000
 It's kind of like an animal.

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.920
 If you've ever been around deer in a field, you know, the deer will look up and if it

2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:34.440
 sees you and you're on the other side of the field, it'll actually go no threat and it'll

2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:35.440
 start eating.

2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:36.440
 You know, they don't put their tail up.

2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:39.320
 As you move closer to the deer, then it goes, oh, it's there and I'm going to react or I'm

2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:40.800
 going to move.

2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:47.440
 So as we were up high and it's down doing whatever it was doing, you know, which I don't

2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:48.440
 know if someone asks, what do you think?

2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:50.160
 I go, oh, maybe it was communicating with something.

2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:52.080
 I joked on good morning America.

2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:56.000
 Maybe it's like talking to the whales, kind of like Star Trek, you know, and actually

2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:57.000
 use that clip.

2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:00.200
 It was kind of funny, but yeah, we're a little human centric.

2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:04.360
 We think like it would, it'd show up to talk to us, but maybe he's talking to the dolphins.

2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:05.360
 Yeah.

2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:07.560
 It was to whatever, you know, cause it was hanging around that whitewater and I don't

2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:09.300
 know if it was, there's something there as a seamount.

2:03:09.300 --> 2:03:10.300
 We just didn't find it again.

2:03:10.300 --> 2:03:11.880
 I don't know.

2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:16.720
 But once we started to descend and it actually reoriented its longitudinal axis and it started

2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:19.880
 mirroring us coming up and it was obviously where we were there and it was really coming

2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:20.880
 up.

2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:25.800
 Just, you know, you figure I'm at 20 and it's coming up and it ends up getting up to 12

2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:27.200
 where I cut across the circle.

2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:30.140
 I think it was very aware that we were there because it interacted.

2:03:30.140 --> 2:03:34.360
 We call it a two circle fight when you're fighting another airplane.

2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:40.520
 But you know, was it, was, were we afraid?

2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:41.520
 I don't think so.

2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.680
 I mean, and to me it was more curious, you know, the curiosity overcomes any fear that

2:03:44.680 --> 2:03:45.680
 you would have.

2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:51.240
 And I always felt to be honest, if I was inside the airplane, especially as long as much time

2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.740
 as I'd spent inside the airplane flying and doing stuff, I felt totally, it was like a

2:03:56.740 --> 2:03:57.740
 safe zone.

2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:01.880
 I mean, I felt totally comfortable inside the airplane as most, you can't, if you're

2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:04.620
 in the airplane and you feel scared, it's not the job for you.

2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:08.120
 You have to feel that because the airplane is part of you now.

2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:11.600
 You know, I am inside, I have the stick, I have the throttles, I've got my wizzo in the

2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:14.280
 back seat, he's running all the displays.

2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:15.280
 We are a team.

2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.720
 We're in the state of the art airplane, you know, brand new.

2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:21.720
 You feel pretty good.

2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:26.320
 And then you get something that, you know, can climb from the surface up and then accelerate

2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:30.160
 like it did, like it was like no big deal, you know, for an airplane, if you just put

2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:34.800
 me from a standstill, let's just say slow flight, just get me at a hundred knots above

2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:35.800
 the water.

2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:39.520
 And for me to, you can't just start a climb, I'd have to lower the nose, I'd have to accelerate

2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:44.620
 and then I'd have to start coming up and this thing just like, just did it like it was like

2:04:44.620 --> 2:04:45.620
 no big deal.

2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:46.620
 Yeah.

2:04:46.620 --> 2:04:52.360
 You mentioned that like kind of your reaction to it was, it like, it's something that you

2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:53.960
 would love to fly almost.

2:04:53.960 --> 2:05:01.880
 So this object, just the curiosity you experienced is like, like what it almost like, what the

2:05:01.880 --> 2:05:05.080
 heck is that piece of technology and I want to fly it.

2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:10.640
 Like what made you feel like it's something that you could fly?

2:05:10.640 --> 2:05:13.700
 Do you think it's something that a human could fly?

2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:18.160
 Like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology, because another

2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:26.920
 perspective on it is it was not that the thing under the water was the key thing.

2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:32.320
 And what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something that like, I don't think it was

2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:33.320
 a projection.

2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:34.320
 I think it was a real object.

2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.400
 It was an op, a physical hard object that could be flyed.

2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:38.400
 Oh yeah.

2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:39.400
 Yeah.

2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:40.880
 I think all four of us will tell you the same thing.

2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:44.960
 It wasn't, it wasn't, this was not, cause you go, okay, let's just go on.

2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:45.960
 It's a light projection.

2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:50.080
 Well, if we were both sitting next to each other and we were looking at it from the exact

2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:54.640
 same angle and all that, and I go, okay, there's a, in theory you could have that, but with

2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:58.560
 an 8,000 foot altitude difference flying, you know, and they're, you know, she's probably

2:05:58.560 --> 2:05:59.800
 not directly above me.

2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:02.680
 She's kind of hanging out watching this whole thing happen.

2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:06.760
 You know, you're getting two different perspectives from two different altitudes over a clear

2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:07.760
 blue.

2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:10.640
 You know, if you've ever been at sea and I don't mean like coast, I mean like when you

2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:15.480
 get out at sea, the ocean is the bluest, it's incredible.

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:19.160
 You know, you've got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean that you got pretty

2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:20.800
 high contrast.

2:06:20.800 --> 2:06:29.880
 And for this thing just to disappear, it wasn't, I'm telling you, I would, I mean, I know we,

2:06:29.880 --> 2:06:33.120
 we all have the same recollection of what happened.

2:06:33.120 --> 2:06:36.560
 You know, there's some details because it's so long ago, but for the most part, we know

2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.480
 what we saw and we all came back and looked at each other like, what the hell was that?

2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:45.080
 What if, I mean, do you think about the thing under the water that's not often talked about

2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:50.480
 if there's something under the water, couldn't have been something gigantic?

2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:51.480
 It could be.

2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:52.480
 What?

2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:53.480
 Like, do you ever think of this?

2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:54.480
 Big ship comes up.

2:06:54.480 --> 2:06:57.840
 I mean, that's why as a person, so I love like swimming out into the ocean by miles

2:06:57.840 --> 2:06:59.160
 and Olympic swimmers.

2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:04.040
 Like I love that feeling, but I'm also terrified when I swim because the abyss, it could, anything

2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:06.080
 could be under there.

2:07:06.080 --> 2:07:12.760
 Like there's not enough focus on that perhaps because there's no visibility, but is it,

2:07:12.760 --> 2:07:16.560
 is there anything interesting to say about the possibility that was anything underneath

2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:17.560
 there?

2:07:17.560 --> 2:07:18.560
 Could be.

2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:19.560
 I mean, think about it.

2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:25.480
 If you're going to hide on this planet, what's the least explored spot on the planet?

2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:28.080
 Two thirds of it's the ocean.

2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:34.840
 There's literally, I mean, come on, the Malaysia airplane, the triple seven, it was a triple

2:07:34.840 --> 2:07:35.840
 seven that crashed.

2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:38.640
 You know, they turned, they didn't go where they're supposed to and they just disappeared

2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:42.320
 and they've been searching for it and they found pieces of it, but you would think there's

2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:46.600
 large objects that, you know, when that thing hit the water, depending on how it broke up,

2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:49.480
 there's big pieces that would be, you'd find something, they haven't found anything except

2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:50.480
 what floated.

2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:54.720
 So to hide something underwater I think would be easy.

2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:55.720
 So okay.

2:07:55.720 --> 2:08:00.000
 Let's go a little bit in speculation land, but it's the best, it's the best we can do,

2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:05.040
 which is the basic question of what do you think was it?

2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:11.880
 So if you had to put money on it, is it like advanced human created technology?

2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:13.720
 Is it alien technology?

2:08:13.720 --> 2:08:16.880
 Is it an unknown physical phenomena?

2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:20.440
 You know, like a ball lightning, for example, there's a lot of fascinating things we probably

2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:22.440
 humans don't really understand.

2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:29.040
 Is it like I said, some perception cognition that led you some kind of hallucination that

2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:31.240
 made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing?

2:08:31.240 --> 2:08:33.600
 Let me put those things on the table.

2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:39.520
 Or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena like an ice cloud or something like

2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:40.520
 that?

2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:41.520
 What do you think it was?

2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:42.520
 Definitely.

2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:47.480
 I don't think it's an ice cloud because ice clouds don't fly around and react to you.

2:08:47.480 --> 2:08:49.080
 Do I think it was a light?

2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:52.280
 I'd say no, because of the aspects and what we looked and watched it do.

2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:53.280
 I'd say no.

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:54.720
 What do you mean by light?

2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:59.840
 Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception, you know, there's their experience

2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:04.000
 like plasma, you can do plasma and you can go, oh, I can see it, but it's really not,

2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:05.240
 you know, it's plasma.

2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:07.240
 I don't think so.

2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:09.760
 So you would see distortions, I think, as it moved.

2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:10.760
 Maybe not.

2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:16.280
 I'm not a theoretical physicist and some, you know, I'm not an MIT.

2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:21.880
 I would say no, I mean, it looked from all my experience and I had quite a bit of it

2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:27.240
 when this happened, no, I think it was a hard object.

2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:28.620
 It was aware that we were there.

2:09:28.620 --> 2:09:33.560
 It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane and I had to come up and do something exactly

2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:35.180
 what I would do.

2:09:35.180 --> 2:09:36.180
 You know, it mirrored me.

2:09:36.180 --> 2:09:37.720
 It wasn't aggressive.

2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:39.840
 You know, there's talk, oh, it flopped behind us.

2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:41.320
 It was never offensive on us.

2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:42.680
 It never did that.

2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:43.680
 It just mirrored us.

2:09:43.680 --> 2:09:47.920
 So as we're coming down, it's just like, you know, you're kind of, you know, you said you

2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:52.840
 do martial arts, you know, or wrestling, you know, you see people out on the, when they

2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:55.980
 get into the ring, especially with collegiate wrestling, cause my roommate in college was

2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:56.980
 a collegiate wrestler.

2:09:56.980 --> 2:10:01.640
 So I de facto became a wrestler cause he beat me up every night and we joke.

2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:05.760
 I talked to him literally probably three, four times a week.

2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:08.480
 But you know, you see wrestlers when they get out, they kind of, you're kind of feeling

2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.840
 each other as you walk and boxers do the same thing.

2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:11.840
 It was doing that same thing.

2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:15.640
 It's like, what's going on as it comes around, as it comes around and then it was like, Hey,

2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:16.640
 we're going to get here.

2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:19.920
 And then when I got too close to it, you know, it decided I'm out of here.

2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:22.220
 And then it did something that we've never seen.

2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:25.240
 The other question is what if I didn't cut across the circle, what if I just kept going

2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:26.240
 around a circle?

2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:27.240
 We just keep going.

2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:28.240
 I could have just watched it.

2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:32.440
 I mean, my one regret out of the whole thing is we have a camera in our helmet and the

2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:33.440
 joint helmet.

2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:35.920
 There's a little camera, but we never use it because it's nauseating to watch because

2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:38.600
 you've ever put a GoPro on someone's head where they're looking around like this all

2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:40.860
 the time, it'll nauseate you.

2:10:40.860 --> 2:10:44.200
 So we never turn that on and all, you know, it's the one thing I didn't do is reach down

2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:47.840
 and hit the switch, you know, and then we didn't go back and cause our tapes didn't

2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:51.800
 have anything cause we didn't get it on radar.

2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:55.520
 Because I tried to lock it up because I can move the radar with my head, but I couldn't,

2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:56.520
 it wouldn't lock.

2:10:56.520 --> 2:10:57.520
 The radar wouldn't lock.

2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:04.440
 And so, so then the question is, and this is unanswerable, but let's try to get some

2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:05.760
 hints at it.

2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:12.240
 Do you think it's human, like advanced human created technology that's simply top secret

2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:15.160
 that we're just not aware of?

2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:18.620
 Or is it not something not of this world?

2:11:18.620 --> 2:11:26.120
 So you, if you'd asked me in 2004, I just said, I don't know if you ask me now.

2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:34.760
 So we're coming up on 16 years ago for a technology like that, you know, and let's assume that

2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:40.720
 it didn't have a conventional propulsion system in it because I don't think it did.

2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:44.760
 I would like to think that if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds

2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:48.060
 from what we normally do, then it would start coming out.

2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:53.280
 But to hide something like that for 16 years, you know, and I understand, you know, and

2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:56.160
 I don't speak for the United States government and I never will speak for the United States

2:11:56.160 --> 2:11:59.020
 government, but I understand how some of that stuff works for classification levels and

2:11:59.020 --> 2:12:03.400
 why we classify stuff, you know, is it detrimental to national defense?

2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:06.680
 But there's a point where you have to look and go, if we had a technology like this that

2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:13.960
 could literally change the way mankind travels, how we get things into space, our ability

2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:17.080
 to do things, you know, you talk about, you know, are we going to go to Mars?

2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:20.120
 Well, if you have something that has the ability to go, because remember, these things were

2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:24.400
 coming down when the cruiser tractor from above 80,000 feet, which is space, and they

2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:27.640
 would come down and they would come straight down, they'd hang out at like 20,000 feet

2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:30.000
 and then three or four hours later, they'd go back up.

2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.620
 You don't have anything that can come down, hang out and once, you know, and I'm talking

2:12:34.620 --> 2:12:35.620
 hold out in a spot.

2:12:35.620 --> 2:12:36.720
 Well, we all know there's winds.

2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:38.020
 They're not drifting like a balloon.

2:12:38.020 --> 2:12:42.320
 They're just sitting there and then they would go back up and they tracked up to the, when

2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:46.180
 I talked to the controller, he's like, we've seen up to 10 of these things.

2:12:46.180 --> 2:12:50.120
 There's other guys and it was raining and all this other, let's just say they tracked

2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:55.320
 a groups of these things coming down, hanging out and going up.

2:12:55.320 --> 2:12:59.280
 So it's not just propulsion and the way it moves, it's also fuel.

2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:00.280
 It's everything.

2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:01.280
 So...

2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:08.200
 The whole of it indicates a kind of technology that's highly advanced, but you don't think

2:13:08.200 --> 2:13:14.600
 in your sense that you actually don't know, but you know more than a lot of people, in

2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:20.200
 your sense, the top secret military technology, if you think about skunkworks, if you think

2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:25.240
 about it like that, cannot be more than 15 years ahead.

2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:32.480
 I would say for a leap like that, and a perfect example in modern times is the 117.

2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:36.480
 Because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out like it was developed at this time.

2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:40.000
 It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the United States government.

2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:41.000
 What's the 117?

2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.560
 That's the stealth fighter, the original stealth fighter, not the B2, but the stealth fighter.

2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:51.520
 So you look at that, you know, yeah, you can, I think you can hide things for a while.

2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:56.440
 But I think a technology, a leap, I mean, this is not a, hey, we developed this and

2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:00.000
 we're kind of pushing the edge of technology.

2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.400
 This is a giant leap in technology.

2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:06.160
 You know, and the other one is, do we have the basis to do that?

2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:10.360
 You know, because usually when you have a technology like that, universities, especially

2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:15.300
 the one you're working at, MIT, a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top

2:14:15.300 --> 2:14:19.480
 tier universities, you know, so you've got MIT, you've got Caltech, you've got Stanford,

2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:24.680
 Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, I'm just naming schools, Naval Postgraduate

2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:27.400
 School is another one.

2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:31.360
 There's usually indicators, there's papers of, hey, this is where we're going.

2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.260
 I don't think there's a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity based propulsion system

2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:41.040
 that literally, I've got an object, because how do you, how much power would it cost to

2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:46.980
 create a gravity field of your own that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant

2:14:46.980 --> 2:14:48.400
 orb that we live on?

2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:50.560
 Also by the way, you mentioned gravity based.

2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:56.080
 That's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of propulsion, like what

2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:03.240
 kind of propulsion would have to be involved in order to result in that kind of movement.

2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:07.320
 To me, all the gravity discussion just seems insane from a physics perspective, but of

2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:13.880
 course it would seem insane until it's not.

2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:19.280
 Because remember, we only know what we know, which is very little.

2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:27.360
 Someone has to think out of the box to go, is this possible at all?

2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:32.560
 So you're saying that if you had to bet money, all your money, it would be something that's

2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:37.320
 alien technology, so it's not human created technology.

2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:41.360
 Well, I don't like to get into little green men, but I would say that I don't think we've

2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:42.360
 developed it.

2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:45.280
 I don't think we've developed it.

2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:48.080
 Because the other one, someone asked me, they said, what if there wasn't, maybe it was just

2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:53.640
 a drone, maybe it was a UAV that got sent here from someplace else.

2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:57.600
 I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around.

2:15:57.600 --> 2:15:59.800
 So I don't know.

2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:03.800
 I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some of the giant brains that think this stuff

2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:04.800
 up.

2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:07.680
 I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of them.

2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:08.920
 Which topic?

2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:11.240
 Which you mean for drones?

2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:14.120
 Just space travel technology.

2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:18.040
 Because if you look at where we're going, because everyone talks about Mars, and you're

2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:20.760
 okay, and we're, hey, are we going to be able to colonize?

2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:22.080
 And I know Elon is big into that.

2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:26.060
 Yeah, what do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA?

2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:29.720
 We put humans back up there.

2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:35.520
 My theory, so it's funny because I know one of the guys that was, he was one of the original

2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:37.160
 employees at SpaceX.

2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:39.920
 He's a friend of mine, and I won't say his name.

2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:40.920
 But he knows Elon.

2:16:40.920 --> 2:16:45.280
 And he actually worked on the entire Falcon 1 project.

2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:46.360
 He's one of the lead guys on that.

2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:49.760
 So he's got some great, as a matter of fact, there's a movie, there's a book coming out

2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:51.440
 that comes out in about a year on this.

2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:55.080
 The original, the first years of space, first six years of SpaceX.

2:16:55.080 --> 2:16:56.080
 And he's named in the book.

2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:57.600
 And they're supposed to make a movie on it.

2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:00.120
 So I'm like, hey, who's going to play it?

2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:04.920
 But what he's done, to me, it changed the game, and here's why.

2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:10.480
 Because I said, I think it was 62 when Eisenhower warned of the industrial defense complex.

2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:17.000
 Which it has become, everything he warned us of, it has become, and it's really driven

2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:23.840
 by, there's the big three in defense, which is really Northrop, Lockheed, and Boeing.

2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:28.040
 Those are the big, those are your biggest, and Raytheon's kind of right, like a subset

2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:29.040
 of that.

2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:30.040
 But Raytheon's pretty big too.

2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:32.400
 But in US defense, those are the big guys, right?

2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:37.440
 That's actually where a lot of military guys go when they retire, they go do stuff like

2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:38.440
 that.

2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:41.760
 And you look at that, and you go, and the way government contracting is working, and

2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:44.240
 how we charge, and why things cost so much.

2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:50.840
 And then you go, you got Elon, who's got an ego, and he doesn't like to do things a certain

2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:51.840
 way.

2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:54.680
 And I've talked to the guy that worked there on, because the government likes to have oversight

2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:58.040
 of contracts, where he was like, no, just tell me what you want, I'll build it, and

2:17:58.040 --> 2:17:59.560
 I'll give you a bill when it's done.

2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:03.280
 And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money, because he's a money

2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:07.520
 driven guy, which I like, capitalism at its best.

2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:08.880
 So now you look at the two things.

2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:13.280
 So you got the SpaceX, which is the Dragon capsule, right?

2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:15.560
 And then you've got Boeing.

2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:21.440
 So Elon did what Boeing is contracted to do in less time for half the money.

2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:26.000
 And oh, by the way, because he can reuse the boosters, because they come back and land,

2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:29.320
 and you don't have to, like Morton Thicol, we've reused them on the space shuttle.

2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:31.960
 But they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff, because they landed in Saltwater,

2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:34.000
 and then he had to put them all back together.

2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.840
 Where Elon gets them down, because I was joking with this guy, go, what do they do?

2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.440
 Do they like rehaul, overhaul, because no, actually they clean them up, and they can

2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:41.440
 use them again.

2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:43.660
 They're reusable systems.

2:18:43.660 --> 2:18:47.040
 Incredible leap in technology that no one thought of, but here's a private company.

2:18:47.040 --> 2:18:50.680
 So being able to put people in the capsule and the spacesuits, I mean, it's literally

2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:52.840
 like sci fi when you watch when they went up.

2:18:52.840 --> 2:18:59.520
 So I'm a huge fan of what he and his company have been able to do, because the fact that

2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:03.560
 we were paying huge amounts of money to the Russian government, and oh, by the way, if

2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:07.880
 you didn't know, because I have some friends that are astronauts, they all have to learn

2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:08.880
 Russian.

2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:09.880
 Right?

2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:14.040
 And they have to do, it's what, level five, where the test is a phone call, where they

2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:19.720
 call you up and they, because they would go, so I went to the pinning, two friends of mine.

2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:21.800
 The one actually had a mission date, the one got one later.

2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:26.080
 So it's cool when you're watching your friends doing a spacewalk, because I would pull up,

2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:27.960
 because if I knew what was going on, I'd pull up the NASA thing.

2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:32.960
 I was in a meeting one day, and I've got NASA on and makers out there floating around doing

2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:33.960
 his stuff.

2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:36.280
 And I saw one, he's in the space station while they're doing a spacewalk, so it's kind of

2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:40.780
 cool when you go, oh yeah, I know that dude, he's up there in space, floating around.

2:19:40.780 --> 2:19:47.940
 So when you look at what those, they're capable of doing, and then you go, what Elon is bringing

2:19:47.940 --> 2:19:56.300
 to the fact that now it's back in America, it's actually, to me, it's cost effective

2:19:56.300 --> 2:19:58.400
 for us to be able to do more stuff.

2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:01.960
 I think it opens the door to, do we go back to the moon?

2:20:01.960 --> 2:20:03.360
 Is there a reason to go back to the moon?

2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:07.160
 Personally, I think if they're really going to go, in years from now, go to Mars, I think

2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:11.760
 that the moon is the stepping stone to go back, to start proving some of the technology,

2:20:11.760 --> 2:20:15.600
 to go, hey, we can build this, we can get on the moon, and now we can get back off the

2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:17.480
 moon.

2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:22.680
 Because we did this on less than a compact computer in the 60s, which is the whole reason

2:20:22.680 --> 2:20:24.000
 that I flew, because I'm obsessed.

2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:29.720
 Matter of fact, I have the giant Lego Apollo at home, and the Lander, and I have one that

2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:35.400
 my dad built me in 1969, right after that, and Neil Armstrong's an Ohio boy, and so

2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:36.400
 am I.

2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:39.680
 Matter of fact, I have a picture of him in a car in Wapakonet, Ohio, at the parade after

2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:42.680
 he walked on the moon, because his parents didn't live far from my aunt and uncle in

2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:45.140
 Wapakoneta, and they were out at the parade.

2:20:45.140 --> 2:20:48.440
 So I've been obsessed with this since I was a child.

2:20:48.440 --> 2:20:55.440
 Do you hope to, do you think, do you hope that you'll go out to space one day?

2:20:55.440 --> 2:20:56.440
 Me?

2:20:56.440 --> 2:20:58.880
 If I had the opportunity, I'd go in a second.

2:20:58.880 --> 2:20:59.880
 I am not.

2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:03.960
 Because, I mean, that's one of the hopes of the commercial space flight, is that, you

2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:09.880
 know, like people like, I mean, it would be tourism, but you certainly wouldn't want to,

2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:14.320
 in terms of, you're not kind of a civilian, right, I mean, in a sense that you're just

2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:20.360
 a normal person, you're not a 5G pilot currently, but it seems like if we send a civilian up,

2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:24.280
 there would be somebody like you in the next, like, 20 years.

2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:27.080
 I'd be, you know, if Elon wants to throw me on one of those things, I'd be all over

2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:28.080
 it.

2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:31.200
 I'd be like, okay, but, you know, sometimes you gotta get your kicks while you're alive.

2:21:31.200 --> 2:21:33.000
 I'd love to hear that discussion with your wife.

2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:34.880
 Listen, there's the pros and cons.

2:21:34.880 --> 2:21:40.800
 She's, I mean, I've known her since high school, so she, yeah, she knows how I am, you know.

2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:43.280
 Most people that know me are like, yeah, you're pretty much the same person you were in high

2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:44.280
 school.

2:21:44.280 --> 2:21:47.600
 You know, I was a class clown and I still am that way.

2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:49.560
 So let me ask you this question.

2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:57.240
 So I'm talking to Elon again soon, I'm curious to get your perspective on it.

2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:05.240
 If I wanted to talk to him about TICTAC, about these weird out there propulsion ideas, which

2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:10.160
 are obviously, just like you said, if there's something to it, if it can be investigated

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:16.120
 somehow, it would be extremely useful for us to understand in the effort of developing

2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:21.520
 propulsion systems that can get us cheaply out to space.

2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:23.460
 What should Elon think about this stuff?

2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:24.520
 What should he do?

2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:25.960
 What should people like him do?

2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:31.560
 I think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of, take the next step and

2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:38.360
 go, you know, we are tied to fuels and either solid rocket or liquid or whatever we do,

2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:43.760
 but it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust, which is really

2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:48.780
 in layman's terms, you know, we can get into what, but that's what it does.

2:22:48.780 --> 2:22:56.500
 If you have something that you can contain that is a fuel source that would last a significant

2:22:56.500 --> 2:23:00.460
 amount of time, you know, those rocket boosters go and when they're done, they're done.

2:23:00.460 --> 2:23:02.200
 There's enough to get them back down and that's it.

2:23:02.200 --> 2:23:05.020
 There's not a huge, you know, they're not coming back and go, oh, I still got three

2:23:05.020 --> 2:23:06.020
 quarters of a tank.

2:23:06.020 --> 2:23:07.560
 Let's bolt them on and do it again.

2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:10.720
 His system's not doing that.

2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:15.200
 But you know, the way contracting, especially in the government, the government has tons

2:23:15.200 --> 2:23:19.200
 of money, but you got to remember the government has to justify how they spend our tax dollars

2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:20.200
 for the most part.

2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:24.040
 There are times where they can hide money in the budget to get stuff done.

2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:26.600
 But then when you look at, and I'm just going to throw a few out there, but if you look

2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:36.120
 at what Amazon, you know, does with Bezos and you've got Elon, there's some big money

2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:37.120
 out there.

2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:43.280
 I mean, you're talking, you know, Bezos alone could buy companies like big companies.

2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:44.280
 Apple's another one.

2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:47.800
 These companies had huge, huge amounts of money.

2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:52.120
 And then just go over to the Gates Foundation and they've got gazillions and gazillions

2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:53.120
 of dollars.

2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:54.120
 We've got universities.

2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:55.160
 There's so much money out there.

2:23:55.160 --> 2:23:59.880
 If we really wanted to do it, aside from what the government wants to do, because we do

2:23:59.880 --> 2:24:05.720
 live in a free society, I think there's enough to go, how do we do this?

2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:11.400
 And because when you work outside of what the government would want to do, let's, we're

2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:16.160
 not working on this necessarily for the United States, although I am a huge giant.

2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:17.160
 I will be.

2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:18.160
 American.

2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:19.160
 I would never.

2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:20.160
 Yeah.

2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:21.160
 I am an American.

2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:22.160
 You're talking to somebody born in the Soviet.

2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.160
 I can't believe you agreed to this.

2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:32.040
 But, but when I haven't killed me yet, you're here and you've been here for a while.

2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:33.040
 No, no, no.

2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:34.040
 I'm joking.

2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:35.040
 I'm an American citizen.

2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:36.040
 I'm actually pretty much American.

2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:39.680
 But see, when you do that, so you look at, let's just look at American universities.

2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:40.680
 Yes.

2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:43.840
 There are some brilliant minds and we'll just use MIT because you worked down there.

2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:46.880
 There's some brilliant minds, but there's a huge chunk of those brilliant minds that

2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:48.160
 are not American citizens.

2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.760
 So if you want to get into government stuff and you are not an American citizen, it gets

2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:53.960
 really, really, really hard.

2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:59.140
 But if I take money like Bezos money, Elon money, and they, let's just say they want

2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:00.500
 to work together.

2:25:00.500 --> 2:25:04.580
 They can split it up 50, 50, the two of them when the technology gets developed.

2:25:04.580 --> 2:25:07.120
 But now I'm not constrained by who has to do the work.

2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:11.400
 I just want to make sure that I try and keep it in the United States because technology

2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:12.400
 is technology.

2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:17.380
 And if it gets developed and gets over to where a country gets a hold of it and then

2:25:17.380 --> 2:25:21.640
 just basically uses it for their own, because you save them all the research time, you don't

2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:22.720
 want to do that.

2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:25.660
 But if we can get to the point where we can, we do it on the International Space Station.

2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:29.900
 We realize that space was too expensive for one country to do alone.

2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:34.640
 So we made the International Space Station and we have a conglomerate.

2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:38.200
 That's the one thing that the Russians and the U.S. actually work together on.

2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:39.200
 Think about it.

2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:40.200
 That's it.

2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.760
 We work together on space because we realize it's way too expensive for us to do alone

2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:45.120
 and effective.

2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:47.960
 So we've got this thing that's been out there floating around for God, now what is it, like

2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:50.080
 20 years that thing's been up there floating around?

2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:51.080
 So it's getting old.

2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:52.760
 We're going to have to replace parts and do stuff.

2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:56.720
 But if we can pool the money together and come up with something that would literally

2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:01.240
 change mankind and change travel and allow us to actually do a more effective thing of

2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:06.200
 engineering, because if you develop that technology, you don't even have to send a man person.

2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:10.120
 If you can develop a technology that's so, and with our automation and where we're progressing

2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:15.800
 and our competing power to send something out that's not just floating around when,

2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:20.160
 you know, that can react a lot quicker, something that could actually go down to the surface

2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:21.160
 and come back up.

2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:23.680
 So right now, everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there and then it just sends

2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:24.680
 data back.

2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:25.680
 Get an analyzer.

2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:28.600
 But if I've got a technology that can go up there really quick, I'm not worried about

2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:29.600
 man.

2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:30.600
 I don't have life support systems and all that.

2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:34.640
 But if it can go down, it can go, it can cruise around, it can hover above, it can take samples

2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:38.600
 and it can actually take Martian soil and then bring it back.

2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:39.600
 So we can analyze it here.

2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:40.600
 That's a game changer.

2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:44.520
 It's a complete game changer because it opens up all the planets.

2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:45.520
 Exactly.

2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:50.360
 So in a sense, the Tic Tac is a symbol.

2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:56.020
 So whatever you think, even from a debunking perspective, there's a nonzero probability

2:26:56.020 --> 2:26:58.520
 that it's alien technology.

2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:06.920
 In that sense, it serves as a beacon of hope and a reason to, like you said, widen the

2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:13.880
 aperture and to invest big amounts of money into thinking outside the box.

2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:21.240
 It's almost a hope to say we can do better propulsion.

2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:27.200
 We can overcome physics in an order of magnitude better way and it's worthwhile to try.

2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.400
 I think, and I don't think the money, if you look at a big picture with the amount of money,

2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:34.320
 some that's out there floating around these private companies, I think if you said, hey,

2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:37.720
 I've got, let's just say a hundred million dollars, which really a hundred million dollars

2:27:37.720 --> 2:27:41.560
 relative to Bezos has got, what, a hundred and some billion dollars in that work.

2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:45.520
 So if he said, hey, a hundred million dollars, you drop a hundred million dollars and I go

2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:50.440
 and I'm going to put a, like the government will send a broad area announcement out that

2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:53.520
 says, hey, we're looking for this technology or a DARPA program.

2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:57.920
 But what if I just said, hey, who's to stop Bezos and Elon from doing that on their own

2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:01.720
 to say, hey, I want to go pool universities because they have fewer restrictions because

2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:02.720
 it's not tax dollars.

2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:03.720
 They don't have the checks inbound.

2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:04.720
 They can do whatever they want.

2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.160
 So their money, sorry about that, to go, hey, I'm going to put this out and I'm going

2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:14.720
 to get the best physicists that are working at CERN, that are at MIT, that are at Caltech,

2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:15.720
 at the schools I mentioned.

2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:20.080
 And, oh, by the way, a few of these guys are propulsion experts and I'm going to basically,

2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:23.440
 I'm going to fund you guys for 10 years.

2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:26.840
 So you get $10 million a year and I'm going to give you your salaries and we're going

2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:28.160
 to do that or whatever the amount works.

2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:30.960
 So let's cut it down to five so we can pay you well, right?

2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:31.960
 To do the research.

2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:36.640
 But, oh, by the way, the research is, it's not classified, but it's controlled.

2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:40.760
 So we're not going to publicly just put this out in journals, but if we make a leap that

2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:45.060
 we think would advance because although those, let's say there's 10 of them, those 10 scientists

2:28:45.060 --> 2:28:49.560
 come up with something and they put out a paper, there might be a number 11 at another

2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:54.240
 university that reads that paper and says, hey, I kind of had this idea and now you can

2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:59.280
 get a thought pool that pushes us in and gets us out of the mindset.

2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:04.560
 Because we have a tendency to, we evolve the stuff that we create, but it's like I was

2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:09.320
 joking because I know a ton of guys with PhDs and girls.

2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:13.360
 And I said, but how much, when a person gets a PhD in engineering, how much new math is

2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:14.360
 really being done?

2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:18.720
 I said, there's a handful of people in the world that are really doing, I'm talking Stephen

2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:26.000
 Hawkins type brilliance that is going, I'm really doing something that's totally different.

2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.800
 That's a big dramatic thing now going on in physics that everybody's converged towards

2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:34.320
 this local minima or local maxima, whatever you think about it.

2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:44.200
 And it's again, same as with the TICTAC, thinking outside the box is not accepted and it probably

2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:45.200
 should be.

2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:51.720
 But it's hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original, he was

2:29:51.720 --> 2:29:53.080
 out of the box.

2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:54.080
 He did not think the norm.

2:29:54.080 --> 2:29:55.080
 That's true genius.

2:29:55.080 --> 2:29:59.140
 Had he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories, where would

2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:00.140
 we be?

2:30:00.140 --> 2:30:03.080
 Okay, we're jumping around a little bit.

2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:09.720
 So we've talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space, but let me jump back to a

2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:11.840
 few questions that folks had.

2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:17.800
 I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual facts

2:30:17.800 --> 2:30:25.040
 of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers hurts my heart

2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:29.120
 a little bit because people are just talking past each other, but let me kind of bring

2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:30.120
 it up.

2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:36.560
 Mick West, I've just recently started to pay attention just in preparing to talk to you

2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:37.560
 about this world.

2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:44.120
 And Mick West is one of the better known people who kind of makes a career out of trying to

2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:45.120
 debunk.

2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:50.360
 Sort of his natural approach to all situations is that of a skeptic.

2:30:50.360 --> 2:30:55.120
 I think it's very useful and powerful, especially for me coming from a scientific perspective

2:30:55.120 --> 2:30:57.200
 to take the approach he does.

2:30:57.200 --> 2:30:58.200
 It's valuable.

2:30:58.200 --> 2:31:04.760
 And I think no matter what, I think there's, I hope that people, quote unquote, true believers

2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:07.960
 are a little bit more open minded to the work of Mick West.

2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:11.120
 I think it's quite useful and brilliant work.

2:31:11.120 --> 2:31:17.320
 So let me ask, he has a bunch of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible

2:31:17.320 --> 2:31:21.020
 other explanations of the things that were out there.

2:31:21.020 --> 2:31:27.880
 He has some explanations of the things that you've seen in with the Tic Tac, like with

2:31:27.880 --> 2:31:28.880
 your own eyes.

2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:36.200
 He says that it's possible that you miscalculated the size and the distance of the thing and

2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:37.720
 so on when you were flying around.

2:31:37.720 --> 2:31:41.520
 I don't find that as, I mean, maybe you can comment on that.

2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:42.520
 Let me do it right now.

2:31:42.520 --> 2:31:43.520
 Sure.

2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:44.520
 So, cause that comes up.

2:31:44.520 --> 2:31:45.840
 Like how, how did you know it was about 40 feet long?

2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:53.120
 I go, okay, so 16 years flying against other airplanes, know what stuff looks like.

2:31:53.120 --> 2:31:54.860
 You know, I've looked down on things.

2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:56.560
 So if I know, I know, here's the known things.

2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:02.120
 I know when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet ish, right around there.

2:32:02.120 --> 2:32:05.260
 So when I look down, I know what a Hornet looks like looking down on them cause I've

2:32:05.260 --> 2:32:07.200
 done it for all those years.

2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:08.440
 I mean, I got a good idea.

2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:11.880
 So that's, that's why I said 40 feet cause it's about Hornet size.

2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:15.760
 So and as I go around, you know, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge

2:32:15.760 --> 2:32:21.720
 distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you

2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:23.600
 know.

2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:30.120
 So I would argue the fact of, you know, peer experiences, you know, professional observers,

2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:33.800
 which is what we're actually trained to do.

2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:38.160
 And having done it for so long, no, it was, and everyone came back with the same thing.

2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:40.320
 They're like, yeah, it's about size of Hornet.

2:32:40.320 --> 2:32:46.720
 From a human factors perspective, how often in your experience of those 16 years do you

2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:53.000
 find that eyes, what you see is the incorrect state of things.

2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:57.840
 So like how often do you make mistakes with vision?

2:32:57.840 --> 2:33:02.240
 You actually, you make vision issues a lot because you're, and the sad part is, is your

2:33:02.240 --> 2:33:04.820
 brain believes what your eyes see.

2:33:04.820 --> 2:33:08.760
 We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly

2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:14.880
 because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing, but you got to trust your instruments.

2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:16.260
 Let's go back to landing at night.

2:33:16.260 --> 2:33:22.980
 So your eyes assume that the runway and your brain assumes that

2:33:22.980 --> 2:33:26.800
 the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving.

2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.960
 So if I try and do stuff visually, I would, you die every time, not every time, but you

2:33:31.960 --> 2:33:34.600
 die close to every time trying to land on a boat.

2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:37.800
 So we actually use instruments, which are counter to your brain.

2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:41.160
 So, and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through in training.

2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:43.780
 They have this thing, I think they still use it.

2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:51.000
 It's called the MSDD multi spatial disorientation device or the spin and puke.

2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.720
 It looks like a giant carousel and you're in these little modules.

2:33:53.720 --> 2:33:57.360
 And when you get out, you think the thing goes really fast and they can, you can make

2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:01.360
 yourself think that I'm descending or climbing, but we were actually only going around in

2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:04.160
 circles at a very slow rate, as fast as a human can talk.

2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:08.360
 But as they spin you around in a little sub thing and slow it down and speed it up, your

2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:12.520
 body does this and you, you know, and then by visuals of showing you like they can spin

2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:16.640
 it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that are, they can make

2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:18.440
 the line stand still because they're moving the same velocity.

2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:20.680
 They can move the other way and you'll think you're screaming.

2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:23.960
 You see it in amusement parks all the time.

2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:28.440
 You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you're really not doing, you're

2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:29.440
 sitting there.

2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:30.440
 So we get trained on all that stuff.

2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:33.480
 So if you, if you want to look at it and go, well, you're, you're disoriented or this,

2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:35.440
 I'd be like, I'd argue going, no, I'm not.

2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:39.000
 Because you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking at the Tic Tac, I've got

2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:42.420
 a heads up display that tells me what my airplane's doing.

2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:44.680
 So I've got, I know what I'm doing.

2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:45.680
 I can look outside.

2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:49.040
 I've got a sense of what I'm doing, but I'm also looking inside to cross check of what

2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:51.240
 I'm seeing is in reality, what I'm doing.

2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:56.460
 You actually, your brain gotten good at combining almost adding extra sensory information.

2:34:56.460 --> 2:35:01.000
 You have to, you have like supervision, so you're combining what you're seeing and adjusting

2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.480
 what the sensors, what you call an instruments are giving you.

2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:10.600
 And that, that in turn is a loop that adjusts the perception system that like, that, that

2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:13.400
 adjusts your brain's interpretation of what you're saying.

2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:15.860
 You'd be amazed at how good, so here's a, here's another example.

2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:20.960
 So if we go out over the water, so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight.

2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:25.340
 So when we fight, you know, two airplanes, we're going to dog fight.

2:35:25.340 --> 2:35:30.440
 As an instructor and I was for all, most of my time, you have to come back and you have

2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:31.520
 to recreate it.

2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:33.720
 So we call it drawing arrows.

2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:37.360
 So you have to recreate that stuff.

2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.040
 So you get pretty good at going, you know, like I would take off and say, all right,

2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:47.020
 we're starting heading due east and I know where the sun is at because in the short couple

2:35:47.020 --> 2:35:49.160
 minutes that we're going to fight, the sun's really not going to move much.

2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:50.160
 It's going to be in a relative zone.

2:35:50.160 --> 2:35:56.740
 I know that the sun is at, you know, let's just say 195 degrees, right?

2:35:56.740 --> 2:36:00.800
 So I'm starting going east and it's actually be down off my right hand side.

2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:03.280
 So now I know as I'm fighting, cause in the water you don't have any reference.

2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:04.280
 Like I pass land.

2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:05.280
 I pass land.

2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:06.280
 No, you don't.

2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:07.280
 And you can't use clouds cause clouds do move.

2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:09.560
 But you got to come back cause you go, here's where I started.

2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:14.280
 And then you, when, as soon as you end, you go, all right, I ended heading 355.

2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:18.280
 And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relative.

2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:22.440
 So you can create this entire battle that went on with arrows so that you can come back

2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:27.000
 and debrief the guy that you were teaching on exactly what happened.

2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:28.840
 And you get really, really good at that.

2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:31.240
 So when you come up and go, well, Dave, how do you know you were at six oclock?

2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:32.800
 And he went around and he came up here.

2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:36.200
 I go, because I'm trained to do all that.

2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:39.000
 And I take all the notes, why I'm flying, you can do it.

2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:42.960
 But usually it's, you memorize it all and you get done and then you, as soon as you're

2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:45.480
 done, you knock it off, you look at the other airplane, you get set and you start writing

2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:46.480
 all your notes down.

2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:47.480
 Yeah.

2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:50.040
 And you're writing it really fast on your card and you go out with a stack of cards

2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:52.360
 and you stick the new one on your knee board card so you're ready to go and here's the

2:36:52.360 --> 2:36:53.360
 next setup.

2:36:53.360 --> 2:37:00.440
 It's kind of, it's in some way similar to what like at the, at the highest level chess

2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:01.440
 players do.

2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:07.960
 I mean, you're, I mean, they, they, they recap the games.

2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:13.720
 But the, the richness of the representation that they use in remembering like how the

2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:15.240
 games evolved.

2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:19.640
 It's not like it's much richer than the actual moves.

2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:24.680
 It's like these, a bunch of patterns that are hard to put into words, like, like all

2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:30.200
 the richness of thinking they have about the way the game evolved.

2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:34.220
 It's more like instinctual from years and years of experience.

2:37:34.220 --> 2:37:37.240
 So they try to put it into words, but they really can't.

2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:38.240
 It's just.

2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:39.240
 I understand that.

2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:42.560
 It's because for us, if we don't come back with anything, then there's no learning to

2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:43.560
 be had.

2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:44.560
 Right.

2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:47.100
 Because the whole thing is the debrief when we get back and we talk about, that's really

2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:49.100
 where the learning is.

2:37:49.100 --> 2:37:52.600
 And it's the same thing if you want to go back to chess, you know, when you start off,

2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:55.100
 you try and learn because you're remembering what you're doing.

2:37:55.100 --> 2:37:59.100
 If you play against someone, I'm always a big place, play with someone better than you.

2:37:59.100 --> 2:38:00.100
 That's how you learn.

2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:01.600
 If you're constantly beating people, you're not learning anything.

2:38:01.600 --> 2:38:04.120
 You're just learning that they're not good and you're better.

2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:10.080
 When you challenge yourself against someone that is better than you, you learn.

2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:15.760
 So I learned how to fight an airplane with, he's actually one of my best friends, we'll

2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:16.760
 call him Tom.

2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:19.280
 I won't give his call sign because I don't know what his name is.

2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:23.960
 So Tom took me out and taught me how to fight because Tom had just left Top Gun.

2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:28.720
 He was the training officer at Top Gun, which so that's the guy, the training officer is

2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:30.960
 the main guy at Top Gun.

2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:32.440
 So Tom was the training officer at Top Gun.

2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:36.480
 So Tom, when I learned, because I had come out of A6 and we really don't fight because

2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:37.960
 it was a bomber.

2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:40.800
 So I get in F18s and I want to learn how to fight because it's a whole other side of the

2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:41.800
 mission.

2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:42.800
 It's the F and F fighter attack.

2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:44.500
 The F18 is fighter attack.

2:38:44.500 --> 2:38:46.400
 So I had to learn how to fight.

2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:49.760
 So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the world who's going to teach me how to

2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:51.520
 do it.

2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:52.520
 And he did.

2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.080
 And I would do something and then he would go, I'd get to a situation where I had never

2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:57.080
 been.

2:38:57.080 --> 2:38:58.080
 And then I would go, well, I'm going to do this.

2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.400
 And then he would destroy me and he would come back and go, here's why you don't do

2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:03.400
 that.

2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:06.960
 And then I would take that knowledge and I would put it in my little basket of tricks.

2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:09.880
 And over time, because you don't, no one walks out into that world.

2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:13.960
 I don't care how gifted of an aviator and go, I am the man or the woman.

2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:14.960
 I am it.

2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:17.560
 No, it's a learning process.

2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:22.560
 And so over all those years, you've gotten good.

2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:29.560
 So what are the chances that your eyes betrays you when you saw the Tic Tac?

2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:30.560
 Low.

2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:31.560
 Zero.

2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:34.280
 Well, I mean, I'm not zero.

2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:35.280
 So maybe 90.

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:37.920
 Yeah, I am ninety nine point nine percent.

2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:39.200
 So point one percent.

2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:40.320
 My eyes deceive me.

2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:43.720
 But remember, if it deceived me, it had to deceive the other four people.

2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:45.480
 So the percentage is even lower.

2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:46.480
 Yeah.

2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:47.480
 Look up.

2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:51.200
 Well, I don't find that particular debunking case that you said, but I'm glad you put it.

2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:55.000
 You you said those words out loud.

2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:00.320
 So for me, from my perspective, coming into this world and looking at it, I'm a little

2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:03.040
 bit more skeptical.

2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:06.120
 So your eye account, I think, is the most fascinating story.

2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:12.920
 And that I think that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists

2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:19.020
 out there on so many levels, just like we said, an engineering level that maybe there's

2:40:19.020 --> 2:40:24.860
 propulsion systems we can actually build that can do some crazy, amazing stuff.

2:40:24.860 --> 2:40:30.000
 So it's at the very least intriguing and at the best inspiring.

2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:31.000
 I just want to say that.

2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:43.800
 But on the video side, it's like it's the videos for the Flir video, the go fast and

2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:45.720
 the gimbal video.

2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:53.080
 They are only interesting to me to me in the context of your story.

2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:56.800
 Like without that, they're kind of low resolution.

2:40:56.800 --> 2:41:02.760
 It's like it it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical.

2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:04.320
 So this is where I'm coming from.

2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:06.040
 Maybe you can convince me otherwise.

2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:12.740
 But so to bring up Mick West one more time, he looks at the Flir video and he says that

2:41:12.740 --> 2:41:17.940
 one of the most amazing video parts of the Flir video for people haven't seen it is at

2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:31.360
 the end of it, the Tic Tac flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left off the screen.

2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:39.280
 And what Mick West says is that, you know, Mick West, probably others, that the way to

2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:42.880
 explain that is the tracking system.

2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:48.680
 Like we said, this vision based tracking simply loses the like the object.

2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:50.760
 The tracking loses it.

2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:57.160
 And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it's no longer tracking

2:41:57.160 --> 2:41:58.160
 it.

2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:04.640
 So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video.

2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:07.440
 Looking at your face, you do not.

2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:12.500
 So can you maybe comment to that to that debunking aspect?

2:42:12.500 --> 2:42:18.240
 So it's funny how people can extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system.

2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:19.240
 No, for sure.

2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:22.680
 And that's like me going because I'm a big Formula One fan.

2:42:22.680 --> 2:42:25.680
 You know, that's like me going, oh, my God, Lewis, what were you doing?

2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:27.720
 You could have done this with the car and you'd have won the race.

2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:30.880
 You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two time

2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:33.600
 ways, four time, four or five time world champion.

2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.600
 But that would be pretty stupid of me to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car.

2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:43.220
 Or a matter of fact, anyone driving a Formula One car.

2:42:43.220 --> 2:42:45.080
 So I can't tell you how many times I've watched.

2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:49.160
 You got to remember when we looked at this thing, when when Chad came back with the video,

2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:50.160
 we sat there and watched that.

2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:53.120
 I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going, all

2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:54.120
 right, right.

2:42:54.120 --> 2:42:55.120
 All right.

2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:58.360
 Let's look at this, you know, because you can look and see where the you can see where

2:42:58.360 --> 2:42:59.360
 the airplane's going.

2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:00.720
 You can see if it's looking left or right.

2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:02.640
 And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn't do that.

2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:07.080
 It actually when the vehicle starts to move, the bars, the tracking gate starts to open

2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:11.000
 up and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built the pod.

2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:12.920
 The tracking gate will start to open up.

2:43:12.920 --> 2:43:17.460
 And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough.

2:43:17.460 --> 2:43:20.840
 It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around because there's another theory

2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:24.880
 that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane.

2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:28.100
 So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me as it does this, the ball will actually

2:43:28.100 --> 2:43:33.520
 flip around to kind of finish off and it'll it'll it swaps ends because it has, you know,

2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:34.520
 it's a gimbal.

2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:38.080
 It can't just it's not free floating.

2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:39.080
 But there's a theory on one of them.

2:43:39.080 --> 2:43:40.080
 Oh, it's here and it flipped over.

2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:41.600
 It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front.

2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:43.100
 It stays like this.

2:43:43.100 --> 2:43:45.960
 So yet another another debunker who doesn't know this.

2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:50.540
 So, you know, and Mick has had several theories on other of some of the other videos like

2:43:50.540 --> 2:43:53.040
 one of them, the go fast as a bird.

2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:57.860
 And Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job of saying, no, it's not because he's on he's

2:43:57.860 --> 2:43:58.860
 on black hot.

2:43:58.860 --> 2:44:02.560
 So the white object is actually colder than the ocean.

2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:03.560
 That's fine.

2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:05.800
 If they were colder than the ocean, they'd be dead.

2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:13.440
 So the gimbal video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the

2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:15.160
 apparent rotation of the object.

2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:22.880
 That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of.

2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:30.560
 And Mick West suggests that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain.

2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:36.360
 Now, because what Mick West doesn't see is so when they take because I've talked to the

2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:37.760
 one of them, actually, I work with.

2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:38.760
 So I know him.

2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:40.800
 I know I talk to him all the time.

2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:46.000
 So and it's his best friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends for the

2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:50.880
 video, the movie and both of them that go fast in the game were shot by the same person.

2:44:50.880 --> 2:44:51.880
 Yeah.

2:44:51.880 --> 2:44:54.060
 OK, so and they were in each other's wedding.

2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:55.520
 So that's how well they know each other.

2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:58.640
 OK, so what you don't see is.

2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:03.840
 So the airplanes, airplanes still super hornets, but they have the APG 79, which is the new

2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:08.460
 phased array radar that's made by Raytheon, things incredible, OK?

2:45:08.460 --> 2:45:11.480
 It doesn't usually if it's if it's out there and it sees it, it's real.

2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.960
 So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff.

2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:16.120
 And then they actually threw one of the targeting pods out there.

2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:19.520
 Well, the targeting pod, there's heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's

2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:20.520
 there.

2:45:20.520 --> 2:45:21.520
 It's real.

2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:22.760
 It's not you're not picking up some extraneous thing.

2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:27.400
 So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit,

2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:28.400
 look at that thing.

2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:32.200
 And it's in the wind and it's going against the wind while it's doing this.

2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:33.480
 You know, someone goes, oh, it's an airplane.

2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:36.520
 No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect because it's

2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:37.520
 in a turn.

2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:38.520
 This thing doesn't change aspect.

2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:39.520
 It just rotates.

2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:40.520
 It's just rotating.

2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:41.520
 Right.

2:45:41.520 --> 2:45:44.840
 The other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they're on their radar.

2:45:44.840 --> 2:45:51.800
 There's an object that they identify is their number one priority or their launch and steering.

2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:54.560
 So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pod is going to look.

2:45:54.560 --> 2:45:56.480
 That's what you get on the gimbal video.

2:45:56.480 --> 2:45:58.360
 There's five other I think it's five.

2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:02.040
 They're kind of in a V, you know, like a geese would fly that are out in front of it and

2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:03.400
 they're actually coming.

2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:06.680
 They're out in front of it and they actually turn on the radar and go the other way while

2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:13.240
 they're filming the gimbal video, which it's I know Ryan has come out and talked about

2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:14.680
 it.

2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:19.280
 But when you see it, you go, you know, if you take it in context because you go, oh,

2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:20.280
 it's just the video.

2:46:20.280 --> 2:46:23.280
 Well, if you take the video with the radar going, no, there's actually other things out

2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:29.440
 there because there's at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar off the VACAPES.

2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:33.520
 It actually became, I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing at the time, the

2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:34.520
 fighter wing.

2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:35.920
 I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this?

2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:38.900
 He goes, well, we got a NOTAM out, which is a notice to airmen, which means there's these

2:46:38.900 --> 2:46:41.800
 objects out there in the warning area.

2:46:41.800 --> 2:46:44.160
 So anyone, you can fly a Cessna through the warning area.

2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:47.420
 All the warning area tells you is that there's high military traffic and training out here.

2:46:47.420 --> 2:46:52.440
 It's probably best not to be here, but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there.

2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:56.560
 So these things have the right, wherever they're from or whatever they are, you know, cause

2:46:56.560 --> 2:46:57.800
 people are like, oh, they're balloons.

2:46:57.800 --> 2:46:59.400
 Well, balloons float.

2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:02.960
 Balloons don't sit in 70 knots of wind and stay in the same location.

2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:05.340
 They had an airplane because there was two.

2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:06.340
 There's the gimbal thing.

2:47:06.340 --> 2:47:08.240
 That's a pretty big object.

2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:11.480
 There's also, they talk about, it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere.

2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:12.480
 A translucent sphere.

2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:13.480
 What the hell is that?

2:47:13.480 --> 2:47:16.120
 And they almost hit one.

2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:17.420
 It's almost hit them.

2:47:17.420 --> 2:47:21.440
 So that's another, that's one of the biggest, another biggest account.

2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:27.560
 It's like almost hit a plane, something that appeared to be a cube in a translucent sphere.

2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:30.560
 What do you make of that?

2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:36.040
 Again, you know, what, I mean, that that's, that's the most dangerous thing.

2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:37.040
 You're right.

2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:40.120
 The biggest frustration is when you do that and you go, okay, so this thing passed between

2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:43.680
 two airplanes and it was, I think it was more than like a hundred feet or something like

2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:45.640
 that of the airplane that almost hit it.

2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:48.600
 So what they do is they come back and go, Hey, I had a near midair, what'd you have

2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:49.600
 a near midair with?

2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:52.120
 It's kind of this floating beach ball with this cube inside of it.

2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:53.120
 And you go, huh?

2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:57.200
 And you know, so they send out a NOTAM again and they, they do a, what's called a hazard

2:47:57.200 --> 2:47:59.120
 report that says, Hey, there's these objects out there.

2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:04.920
 We almost hit one here and that gets sent off to the Naval safety center.

2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:05.920
 What was done?

2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:06.920
 I mean, what are you going to do?

2:48:06.920 --> 2:48:10.400
 Can you catch one, go out with a giant net and try and bag one?

2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:11.480
 You don't know because they've seen them.

2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:13.280
 They picked them up like hovering on radar.

2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:15.680
 And then all of a sudden they're traveling at really high rates of speed.

2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:18.600
 So you know, what are you going to do?

2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:25.040
 Well, and that, let me ask this, cause this is what people kind of think about.

2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:30.880
 After you witnessed Tic Tac and after this, these incidents, as far as we know, uh, with

2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:39.640
 the gimbal and the go fast, it seems like people in the military did not, did not react

2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:43.220
 like what, like did not freak out.

2:48:43.220 --> 2:48:46.620
 It almost like was like a mundane event.

2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:47.720
 How do you explain that?

2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:53.520
 Why didn't the people on the ship, not the higher ups, why wasn't there a big freakout?

2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:58.560
 Or as some people suggest, the higher ups knew about it all along and just were not

2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:05.560
 letting everyone know that there's some kind of secret military, uh, uh, you know, like,

2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:06.560
 like tests.

2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:07.560
 Yeah.

2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:11.200
 So let's talk about, so let's say you've got this cool new toy, which you call it a cool

2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:12.200
 new toy.

2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:15.640
 You typically don't take your cool new toy out into an area where the cool new toy could

2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:19.880
 get damaged or what if the airplane would have actually hit your cool new toy and you

2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:23.900
 got two people that are ejecting or dead and you got a, you know, $80 million airplane

2:49:23.900 --> 2:49:29.840
 that's now in the bottom of the Atlantic, um, you know, tests are normally done in controlled

2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:30.840
 environments.

2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:32.720
 Just, it's like any test, a lab test or whatever.

2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:36.540
 When you take things out into the real world, you know, you're still going to test it in

2:49:36.540 --> 2:49:38.280
 an area where if something goes wrong.

2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:41.000
 So when they started and we'll go back to Elon.

2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:45.760
 So my friend that worked there, they had a rocket go off, they were out in Kwajalein

2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:50.480
 and when the rocket went up, a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and it ran out of fuel before

2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:53.040
 it got all the way up and it came falling back down.

2:49:53.040 --> 2:49:58.120
 Well, when you're out on an ATOL in the Pacific, if it's going up above you, the worst case

2:49:58.120 --> 2:49:59.340
 is going to land on you.

2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:02.800
 So you're worried about where else is it going to land and it actually crashed next to the

2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:08.360
 ATOL and, and, you know, Elon wasn't happy and threw this guy under the bus.

2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.780
 So that's a test environment because you don't know what's going to happen.

2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:15.780
 So cause someone said, well, when we chased the Tic Tac, well, it could have been some

2:50:15.780 --> 2:50:16.780
 secret government thing.

2:50:16.780 --> 2:50:21.000
 Well, secret government things typically just don't come out and test to where there's going

2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:22.000
 to be.

2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.320
 Unknowing pilots, you can't control a lot of things.

2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:25.320
 You're exactly right.

2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:29.680
 So you go, you know, it's, you know, it's not the Dr. Evil scientist that's going to

2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:34.860
 throw shit out there to get, there's control and there's reasons that we do it because

2:50:34.860 --> 2:50:39.840
 a lot of stuff, especially when you get to there's, there's, you build something in theory,

2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:43.120
 you model it, you go, Hey, this is, it looks like it's going to work.

2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:47.840
 You get funding, you build it, you test it some more, you bench test it.

2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:51.680
 You know, you like an airplane with digital flight controls before it even leaves the

2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:52.680
 ground.

2:50:52.680 --> 2:50:56.540
 They've got things over the pedostatic system that are changing the, what the airplane thinks

2:50:56.540 --> 2:50:59.280
 is the airspeed talking to it and it's probably up on Jack.

2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:02.320
 So the gear up, so it doesn't, it thinks it's flying.

2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:04.800
 It doesn't know it's sitting on Jack stands.

2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:07.680
 And they're just changing the pressure on the pedostatic system so they can actually

2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:11.280
 make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go, Hey, it looks

2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:12.560
 like it's going to work.

2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:15.040
 And then there's wind, there's a bunch of stuff that they do.

2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:17.120
 That's a control environment which you can do the testing.

2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:18.120
 Yeah.

2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:23.600
 Throwing shit out in the middle of where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous

2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:25.400
 thing that I've heard.

2:51:25.400 --> 2:51:26.400
 Is it possible?

2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:27.400
 Yes.

2:51:27.400 --> 2:51:33.020
 Is it more really, is it, is it, is it, is it more likely, it's more likely they're not

2:51:33.020 --> 2:51:34.020
 doing that.

2:51:34.020 --> 2:51:40.720
 Then the other side of that question is why do you think people on the Nimitz and in the

2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:45.920
 US government in general, not freak out more at the incredible thing that you've seen?

2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:48.880
 Freak out in the positive way, freak out in the negative way.

2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:51.440
 Like what are the Russians up to again?

2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:53.760
 Or more like what is this?

2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:55.800
 Like more turmoil.

2:51:55.800 --> 2:52:00.200
 So if you would have put a Chinese flag on the side of it or a Russian flag on the side

2:52:00.200 --> 2:52:03.440
 of it, and I said, yeah, it had a big Russian flag on the side of it, dude.

2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:04.960
 Then it would have got a lot of attention.

2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:06.660
 It would have went high order, right?

2:52:06.660 --> 2:52:11.060
 If it was, you don't have to say Russia or China, just say if there was another country's

2:52:11.060 --> 2:52:16.100
 emblem on the side of this thing that we saw and said, oh, it belonged to them, then it's

2:52:16.100 --> 2:52:17.820
 a big deal.

2:52:17.820 --> 2:52:18.820
 So here's what's going on.

2:52:18.820 --> 2:52:21.600
 So we're literally in the middle of workups and it was a joint workup.

2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:24.360
 Normally they, we go out for a month, go come back, do stuff, go out for a month.

2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:27.920
 This was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to let us when

2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:31.680
 the ship pulled in at Thanksgiving so we could run home up to the central valley, have Thanksgiving

2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:34.380
 with our family, and then run back down and do this, okay?

2:52:34.380 --> 2:52:40.780
 So when I had just taken over, I had had the squadron for a month, right?

2:52:40.780 --> 2:52:46.300
 So I'm a brand new CO, I'm the most junior guy on the, as far as a commanding officer

2:52:46.300 --> 2:52:51.400
 goes, for time in the Navy, and actually at the time I think it was the most junior CO

2:52:51.400 --> 2:52:53.760
 for O5 Command in the Navy, right?

2:52:53.760 --> 2:52:59.520
 So you go, okay, so I'm out here, I got my squadron, I'm running it, I see this thing,

2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:00.640
 we catch shit for it.

2:53:00.640 --> 2:53:02.160
 I have a squadron to run.

2:53:02.160 --> 2:53:08.760
 I have the, the TICTAC was over here and although an extraordinary event, I have 17 aircrew

2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:12.680
 and 300 sailors that I'm responsible for, right?

2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:17.080
 Their wellbeing, making sure they're fed, making sure they're happy, they're birthing,

2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:22.160
 you know, and I'm working with my Master Chief and I'm working with my XO, SNAP, and we're

2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:23.800
 going through all this stuff.

2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:28.440
 I don't have a lot of time to worry about the TICTAC.

2:53:28.440 --> 2:53:32.560
 But people need to talk to me, so you got to remember, you got the captain of the ship,

2:53:32.560 --> 2:53:35.000
 you got the air wing commander, and you got the Admiral.

2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:36.000
 Those are the top three.

2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:40.800
 And you got the CO of the Princeton, who is a major command guy, and that's really your

2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:41.800
 big major command.

2:53:41.800 --> 2:53:45.260
 And then everything else is you got all the squadrons, which are O5 Command, and you got

2:53:45.260 --> 2:53:47.220
 the small boys that are out there, which is O5 Command.

2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:53.280
 So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility of what's going on, I'm pretty much in the

2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:59.120
 top 20 with all my peers, and then I've got, obviously, the captain and the admiral, right?

2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:02.560
 And then he's got some post command guys on his staff that we were friends with.

2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:04.880
 So you're responsible for a lot of things.

2:54:04.880 --> 2:54:05.880
 Yes.

2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:06.880
 Oh, yeah.

2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:07.880
 Busy schedule.

2:54:07.880 --> 2:54:08.880
 Yeah.

2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:09.880
 There's missions.

2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:13.880
 You have to do a lot, get the job done, and there's no time for silly things.

2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:14.880
 That's exactly right.

2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:20.200
 So, and we're the integration, you know, when a battle group deploys, especially when you

2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:24.320
 go to the Middle East for what we were doing, the air power is the key.

2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:28.380
 We take our airport with us, we can park it anywhere we want, and we can do what we need

2:54:28.380 --> 2:54:29.640
 to do.

2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:30.720
 So we're kind of key players.

2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:33.780
 So when you get the theory that, oh, all these men in suits showed up.

2:54:33.780 --> 2:54:37.360
 So the captain of the ship never said anything to me, the admiral never saying to me, the

2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:40.960
 people on his staff that I was friends with never saying to me, the other COs that I talked

2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:44.520
 to on a daily basis never said anything to me, and no one ever came and talked to me,

2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:45.600
 and I'm the guy that chased it.

2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:48.880
 So in all the theories and all the debunkers and all the stories, because I don't know

2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:52.160
 if people think they're going to get rich on this because I made a big donut on this.

2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:53.280
 I can tell you what I got paid for.

2:54:53.280 --> 2:54:57.440
 I got paid to go out and spend 21 hours of my day going to LA and do a five minute talk

2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:58.440
 for someone.

2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:00.920
 And I'm like, and it wasn't for the talk because I'll talk for free because you're not paying

2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:01.920
 me.

2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:08.040
 I said, and then I got paid to go to the McMinnville Fest because my wife and I got to go because

2:55:08.040 --> 2:55:10.800
 it was just looked like fun because the whole town gets involved.

2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:14.760
 And it's the only time I've ever spoken publicly in front of a large audience about this because

2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:16.120
 it was just, you know, it was fun.

2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:18.760
 And I got asked and Jeremy and George Knappen went the year before.

2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:21.080
 So I went with Bob Lazar.

2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:24.560
 So I got to hang out with Bob and his wife and his wife and my wife and, you know, we

2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:28.520
 all hung out kind of, you know, talking not about UFO stuff, but just getting to know

2:55:28.520 --> 2:55:33.760
 each other as people because, you know, Bob's like me, the stuff that he talks about is

2:55:33.760 --> 2:55:34.760
 not the center of his life.

2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:40.180
 If anything, it ruined his life, you know, he's just a really, really smart guy.

2:55:40.180 --> 2:55:42.800
 That's just like the rest of us trying to get through life.

2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:50.400
 Yeah, nevertheless, I mean, that was one of the sad things reading Lou Elizondo's resignation

2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:59.400
 note from his, he was a program director at the ATIP program.

2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:04.080
 One of the sad things is that he's mentioned that, you know, people in government just

2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:10.600
 don't take this seriously as a threat, like UFOs as a threat, like you said, if it doesn't

2:56:10.600 --> 2:56:17.120
 have a Russian label on it, it's a sad thing to think about that, that we have such a busy

2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:25.280
 schedule that the anomaly, it doesn't, is a distraction that we don't want to deal with

2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:29.200
 and it kind of just fades into history.

2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:38.880
 Like literally, it's kind of sad to think that if aliens showed up, like, and it just

2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:44.880
 didn't because they're not, like when aliens show up, they're not going to be a thing that's

2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:50.960
 on the schedule and if they don't start killing people, they just kind of show up in some

2:56:50.960 --> 2:56:57.680
 very nonchalant peaceful way briefly.

2:56:57.680 --> 2:57:02.480
 People would be like, that's, I don't have time for this.

2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:03.480
 That's so sad.

2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:04.480
 That's so sad.

2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:05.480
 It's like anywhere in the world.

2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:11.600
 So, you know, go back, let's go back way back, way back in the time machine, you know, there

2:57:11.600 --> 2:57:16.000
 were people kind of scattered around the globe, you know, and Europe's a perfect example.

2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.800
 Why does France speak French?

2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:23.200
 And then right next to them, Spanish, you know, Spain speaks Spanish and then you'd

2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:27.700
 kind of jump over and Germans are German and the Polish people, everyone speaks a different

2:57:27.700 --> 2:57:31.840
 language because if you look at the way the train kind of subdivide the original people

2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:37.600
 that were there, you know, thousands of years ago, they speak differently, right?

2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:39.560
 You'd be like the US, but see, the US is different.

2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:40.980
 We all speak English because what happened?

2:57:40.980 --> 2:57:44.840
 We came over and we started on the east coast and we migrated west.

2:57:44.840 --> 2:57:48.460
 We won't get into the, you know, what happened and, you know, because the Native Americans

2:57:48.460 --> 2:57:52.400
 all spoke different languages, you know, it's that same type of thing.

2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.880
 So, but anytime we have a tendency to show up, you're actually, you think about, you're

2:57:56.880 --> 2:57:57.880
 an alien.

2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:02.240
 If I went to a different area, if I just, you know, go back 500 years where, you know,

2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:05.640
 or a thousand years where travel, we weren't traveling across oceans at the time.

2:58:05.640 --> 2:58:10.680
 We were, well, we don't think we were, but the Vikings probably were because we had limited,

2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:12.600
 you know, we had to have supplies and the boats weren't as big.

2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:13.600
 We had to build them by hand.

2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:15.040
 We didn't have power tools and all that stuff.

2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:19.600
 So, you know, if you show up someplace like when the conquistadors from Spain came over

2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:25.000
 into South America and you've got, you know, the natives, you're actually an alien, you

2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:30.040
 know, and then you look at what typically happens when aliens show up in a human alien

2:58:30.040 --> 2:58:33.800
 world, you know, and when I say alien, I mean, you are not from that area.

2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:38.640
 The other, we take what we want.

2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:39.640
 And that's what happened.

2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:45.560
 I mean, we literally defuncted civilizations because that's how we are, you know, humans

2:58:45.560 --> 2:58:48.000
 are, we're an interesting group.

2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:49.880
 So you go, now what?

2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:52.400
 What if something is from someplace else?

2:58:52.400 --> 2:58:57.720
 Let's just, let's just go off the grid and go, let's say there are little green men.

2:58:57.720 --> 2:58:58.720
 What are their intentions?

2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:01.160
 Lou asked me this when we were talking to Lou Elizondo and he said, what do you think

2:59:01.160 --> 2:59:02.160
 they were here for us?

2:59:02.160 --> 2:59:03.160
 I said, I don't know.

2:59:03.160 --> 2:59:04.160
 He goes, what?

2:59:04.160 --> 2:59:05.160
 I go, I don't know.

2:59:05.160 --> 2:59:06.160
 They were observing.

2:59:06.160 --> 2:59:07.160
 They'd come down, they'd hang out.

2:59:07.160 --> 2:59:08.720
 And he goes, well, what if they were prepping the battlefield?

2:59:08.720 --> 2:59:10.880
 What if they were observing to figure out what we do?

2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:12.760
 And you go, that's interesting.

2:59:12.760 --> 2:59:16.920
 The other theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and they just check

2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:21.780
 in on us because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization that's

2:59:21.780 --> 2:59:27.040
 inferior to them actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above.

2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:29.160
 Because now these, they become the threatened type.

2:59:29.160 --> 2:59:32.160
 So you watch us grow until we start getting too much.

2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:34.440
 You know, it's kind of like you go, well, cause they always have a tendency to hang

2:59:34.440 --> 2:59:35.440
 out around nuclear.

2:59:35.440 --> 2:59:36.440
 Right?

2:59:36.440 --> 2:59:39.540
 And you go, well, you know, if this is an advanced civilization, I'm going to go science

2:59:39.540 --> 2:59:40.800
 fiction kind of comical.

2:59:40.800 --> 2:59:45.840
 They come down and watch us and go, look at the, the crazy upright monkeys now have developed

2:59:45.840 --> 2:59:46.840
 the atom bomb.

2:59:46.840 --> 2:59:47.840
 Let's hope they don't destroy themselves.

2:59:47.840 --> 2:59:52.120
 Yeah, if I was an alien civilization, I would start paying attention with the atom bomb.

2:59:52.120 --> 3:00:00.880
 That's why the, I mean, there's certainly an uptick of, what is it, UFO sightings since,

3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:03.400
 since the nuclear era, since the nuclear era.

3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:04.400
 Yeah.

3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:07.920
 You go, hmm.

3:00:07.920 --> 3:00:13.240
 Let me ask a little bit out there question, maybe it's a speculation, but maybe touching

3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:26.160
 on Roswell, do you think it's possible that there is out of this world aircraft or beings

3:00:26.160 --> 3:00:32.800
 that are in the possession of one of the governments on this earth, like the US government?

3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:34.560
 Is it possible?

3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:40.840
 So the one perspective of that, if it's possible, is it possible to keep a secret like that?

3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:41.840
 I would say this.

3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:46.760
 I think it's very, it's highly possible because if you go, if you just look at all the sightings

3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.000
 and let's go, just look at project Blue Book, it was what the, I forget how many thousands

3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:55.780
 of sightings that there's a percentage, it's like 10 or 15% of them, they still can't explain.

3:00:55.780 --> 3:00:58.320
 Like our Tic Tac is one of them that, you know, they basically, the government has come

3:00:58.320 --> 3:00:59.920
 out and said, we don't know what that was.

3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:00.920
 Okay.

3:01:00.920 --> 3:01:05.020
 So, so if you go, okay, of that 15% that we don't know, and all of these thousands are

3:01:05.020 --> 3:01:07.840
 still that 15% makes up a pretty big number.

3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:13.840
 What are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered?

3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:18.360
 And I don't care if it's an intact system or you've got pieces of it, of a metal that

3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:27.840
 we can't explain or some, some biological matter to say the least, it could be intact

3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:32.600
 or it couldn't, but the odds of that now are starting to go down that, you know, that could

3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:33.600
 never happen.

3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:36.440
 And I'm not talking just the United States, I'm talking the world.

3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:40.880
 So is there a chance that a foreign government actually possesses or our government or someone

3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:46.420
 in the, in the world on the globe of the seven plus billion people has something that is

3:01:46.420 --> 3:01:47.420
 not from this world?

3:01:47.420 --> 3:01:52.000
 And I'm not talking a meteor, but something that was manufactured in some way that allowed

3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.620
 transport or observation.

3:01:54.620 --> 3:01:57.740
 Could be a drone, could be a foreign drone, you know, like Voyager flies around and does

3:01:57.740 --> 3:01:58.740
 all that stuff.

3:01:58.740 --> 3:02:02.880
 And we've got stuff that just went past Pluto that's out in the Kuiper belt, you know, there's,

3:02:02.880 --> 3:02:04.080
 there's stuff out there floating around.

3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:07.560
 And what about ours, it's going to crash into Jupiter eventually or whatever, cause we've

3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:09.640
 had stuff crash into planets.

3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:14.400
 So if that's the case, you would think something is out there that we have something that we

3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:15.400
 can't explain.

3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:19.640
 And according to Lou, there's stuff that we can't explain, you know, and I would assume

3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:25.920
 that Lou who ran a tip has, has seen stuff that he can't openly talk about because, you

3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:27.840
 know, cause I had a clearance.

3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:31.120
 When you have a clearance, you were, you sign your name, you're bound to that.

3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:36.760
 And to me, that's an important oath that you hold to, you know, and this is kind of where,

3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:39.320
 you know, people have issues with Bob.

3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:42.520
 So if, you know, and I leave it to you to determine if you believe Bob or not.

3:02:42.520 --> 3:02:47.400
 I'll tell you, Bob is a straightforward, very sane, normal, super smart guy.

3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:48.400
 Bob Luzaro.

3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:49.400
 Yeah.

3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:50.400
 Yes.

3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:53.600
 There is the other side that says, well, should he have come out and talked, you know, to

3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:58.040
 those who will clearance who, you know, are true to the government, you would say he should

3:02:58.040 --> 3:02:59.040
 have never spoke.

3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:02.680
 He, he was under an oath to not say anything, but he did.

3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:05.240
 If you ask Bob, why did you say something?

3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:10.780
 His, his answer was, I understand there's an oath, but I felt that the technology could

3:03:10.780 --> 3:03:14.000
 benefit all of mankind and it shouldn't be locked away.

3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:15.000
 And I'll leave it.

3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.440
 If you believe Bob, that's, that's kind of what Bob says.

3:03:17.440 --> 3:03:21.360
 And that, that's such a interesting key point.

3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:28.100
 If there is aircraft, a technology that's in the possession of the, say the US government,

3:03:28.100 --> 3:03:30.720
 should they make that publicly known?

3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:37.820
 This is the question of like, do we release stuff that can potentially change the nature

3:03:37.820 --> 3:03:39.360
 of human civilization?

3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:47.840
 Like the, the way we, the way we think about our place in the world, also the, if that

3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:55.340
 technology is potentially useful for military applications, the nature of military conflict,

3:03:55.340 --> 3:03:58.560
 should we release that information or not, if you were the government?

3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:00.160
 So here, well, here's exactly how.

3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:05.560
 So for, for classified information, the government is the people that classify it.

3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:09.920
 So I can't go, I can't look at something and go, Oh my God, this Avion bottle is now a

3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:10.920
 top secret.

3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.000
 I can't, I don't have the authority, the ability or anyone to do that.

3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:14.000
 That's the guard.

3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:15.000
 That's up to the government.

3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.600
 And I agree with that because I worked for the government for 24 years of my life.

3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:21.460
 So I understand that.

3:04:21.460 --> 3:04:24.840
 But now you go, there's reasons stuff is classified.

3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:25.840
 Okay.

3:04:25.840 --> 3:04:31.440
 And it has to do with, uh, sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained.

3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:32.760
 It's just like the mob.

3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:36.840
 If I have a spy and I'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster, but I have a guy on the

3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:39.680
 inside that's feeding me information, I can't do it.

3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:44.280
 And a perfect example is if you've ever seen the, uh, it's the Tom Cruise movie, what is

3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:45.280
 it?

3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:48.960
 Air America or whatever, but he, he plays the guy in Louisiana who was hauling drugs

3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:53.720
 for Pablo Escobar and he ended up getting a cargo plane and the government, the CIA

3:04:53.720 --> 3:04:56.080
 was kind of funding him to do stuff.

3:04:56.080 --> 3:04:58.840
 That's how he got hooked up with Pablo, but they put cameras on his airplane and when

3:04:58.840 --> 3:05:03.220
 Reagan had come out and said, here's pictures, we have proof that they're running these drugs.

3:05:03.220 --> 3:05:06.600
 It didn't take Pablo long to figure out those pictures were taken from inside of the plane

3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:09.240
 of this guy he had been working with and that guy ends up dead.

3:05:09.240 --> 3:05:10.800
 Does that make sense?

3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:15.840
 So you classify to protect the source, you classify to protect the technology because

3:05:15.840 --> 3:05:20.180
 if the technology would get out, it could be grave damage or there's levels depending

3:05:20.180 --> 3:05:22.200
 on if it's a secret or top secret.

3:05:22.200 --> 3:05:25.720
 There are levels of damage that can be done to the U S government and our wellbeing as

3:05:25.720 --> 3:05:26.880
 a country.

3:05:26.880 --> 3:05:29.560
 And we owe it to this because we're all Americans.

3:05:29.560 --> 3:05:33.320
 You know, to me, no matter what some people will say, even in this country, this is the

3:05:33.320 --> 3:05:35.360
 greatest country on the planet.

3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:38.920
 This is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to do.

3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.260
 It's just, don't be lazy.

3:05:40.260 --> 3:05:46.180
 And I have stories of people that came over here and started with nothing and they're,

3:05:46.180 --> 3:05:49.720
 they're living the American dream and they'll tell you, and they didn't get it because of,

3:05:49.720 --> 3:05:56.440
 you know, like you, you came over here from Russia, you get no minority status or anything

3:05:56.440 --> 3:05:57.440
 else.

3:05:57.440 --> 3:06:03.680
 You get, you're a white Anglo Saxton Protestant, whatever your religion, but you come over

3:06:03.680 --> 3:06:04.680
 here.

3:06:04.680 --> 3:06:09.240
 I kind of knew that from the last, but, um, but you come over here, you basically have

3:06:09.240 --> 3:06:15.200
 made yourself, you're educated, you're working at literally the top research university in

3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:16.280
 the world.

3:06:16.280 --> 3:06:21.920
 To be honest, um, I can do whatever the hell I can create a, with a bit of, with a lot

3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:25.120
 of hard work, I can do quite a, and no one gave it to you.

3:06:25.120 --> 3:06:32.240
 So, I mean, and I, well, I'm a believer that like that, I mean, we are a community.

3:06:32.240 --> 3:06:38.120
 So like there is a social aspect to it, but the freedom and the American dream is a real

3:06:38.120 --> 3:06:39.120
 thing.

3:06:39.120 --> 3:06:43.680
 And this is this, I, you know, I joke about being Russian, but I, I'm an American and

3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:46.280
 this is, I do believe the greatest country on earth.

3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:52.640
 So there's a reason the nationalist pride, uh, the pride in your nation is a powerful

3:06:52.640 --> 3:06:53.640
 thing.

3:06:53.640 --> 3:06:58.180
 And around that, this secrecy holds value.

3:06:58.180 --> 3:07:03.600
 But to me, alien technology is bigger than that.

3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:11.440
 I mean, it's, it's not so much a threat as a, you're holding back something that could

3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:15.120
 inspire the world, like human knowledge.

3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:16.400
 So let's talk in theory.

3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:20.320
 So I'm going to go back to Bob cause I've talked to Bob.

3:07:20.320 --> 3:07:23.920
 So Bob is a propulsion guy, right?

3:07:23.920 --> 3:07:24.920
 Right.

3:07:24.920 --> 3:07:26.200
 Bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor.

3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:29.440
 He built a rocket car, you know, so he did that.

3:07:29.440 --> 3:07:34.900
 So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system, let's just say this is, I'm just talking,

3:07:34.900 --> 3:07:36.940
 this is Dave's theory.

3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:44.800
 I am, I own, I have, I have custody of this thing from a technology that I don't understand.

3:07:44.800 --> 3:07:46.820
 And I know it's a propulsion system.

3:07:46.820 --> 3:07:49.380
 So now I got to figure it out, right?

3:07:49.380 --> 3:07:51.580
 So who are you going to go to, right?

3:07:51.580 --> 3:07:52.580
 You go find someone.

3:07:52.580 --> 3:07:57.440
 So you go, wait, here's a guy who at the time was working at Los Alamos, which they have

3:07:57.440 --> 3:08:00.100
 proven who is big into propulsion.

3:08:00.100 --> 3:08:01.100
 He designs all this.

3:08:01.100 --> 3:08:05.120
 He builds a shit in his garage, Hey, he's super smart.

3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:06.720
 Why don't we bring him in?

3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:09.720
 So you hire him on a contract and you go, Hey, we're going to brief you into a program.

3:08:09.720 --> 3:08:12.680
 And he goes and works on wherever he says he worked, you know, that's not important,

3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:15.820
 but you get access to the technology to try and figure it out.

3:08:15.820 --> 3:08:19.460
 And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know, like we're figuring

3:08:19.460 --> 3:08:22.600
 out these things, but there's a part where our technology isn't advanced enough for us

3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:25.380
 to figure the whole thing out.

3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:29.640
 So then, you know, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out and tell anyone he works

3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:33.520
 on it until he gets to the point where he's stagnated.

3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:34.740
 He's at a, he's at a wall.

3:08:34.740 --> 3:08:35.740
 You go, I can't do it.

3:08:35.740 --> 3:08:37.580
 You know, sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind.

3:08:37.580 --> 3:08:40.520
 So you go find someone else who's into propulsion, you bring him in and they work, they can't

3:08:40.520 --> 3:08:41.520
 figure it out.

3:08:41.520 --> 3:08:44.560
 Or they get to the point where kind of back to the Einstein theory where, Hey, I've got

3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:46.960
 all these theories on how it works, but we don't have the technology.

3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:49.220
 We haven't advanced enough to actually do what we need to do.

3:08:49.220 --> 3:08:51.280
 We still have to advance technology more.

3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:52.280
 So then what do you do?

3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:57.280
 You shelf it, you go, Hey, good projects over and the contract, you shelf it and you wait

3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:02.440
 another 10 years and you wait another 10 years until technology and our abilities and our

3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:06.720
 research advances more and then you go find new people to bring in that are experts in

3:09:06.720 --> 3:09:09.640
 that field and go, Hey, we want you to work on this thing and here's what we know about

3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:10.960
 it so far.

3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:15.600
 Or you don't tell them anything because you, cause remember if you, if you reveal someone

3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:17.600
 else's research, you can taint their beliefs.

3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:18.920
 They'll start to sway in that direction.

3:09:18.920 --> 3:09:20.920
 So you go, I'm not going to tell you anything.

3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:23.200
 I'm going to give you this thing and now you tell me what you think.

3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.140
 And as they progress, if they get stuck on a problem that maybe Bob and someone else

3:09:27.140 --> 3:09:28.940
 solved earlier, you can go, Hey, what about this?

3:09:28.940 --> 3:09:30.260
 You don't have to tell them where it came from.

3:09:30.260 --> 3:09:31.260
 What about this?

3:09:31.260 --> 3:09:35.880
 You can leapfrog and they get another two steps closer to the final answer.

3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:39.320
 And then we get stuck by our evolution of technology and you shelve it again.

3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:41.540
 Do you think that's the right way to do it?

3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:42.540
 Because it's heartbreaking.

3:09:42.540 --> 3:09:48.840
 I don't, listen, I love government, but we just had this discussion about Elon and so

3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:49.840
 on.

3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:56.680
 The, the alternative approach is to release this to the world and say, there's a mystery

3:09:56.680 --> 3:09:57.680
 here.

3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:00.880
 And then the Elons of the world, the Jeff Bezos, we talked about money, but it's also

3:10:00.880 --> 3:10:01.920
 not just money.

3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:08.680
 It's like this engine that's within, we talked about the American dream to say, I'm going

3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:11.800
 to be the one that cracks this mystery open.

3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:17.940
 And like, that's within a lot of us and like money aside, people in their garage just will.

3:10:17.940 --> 3:10:19.400
 But you're thinking like a scientist.

3:10:19.400 --> 3:10:22.340
 Now let me, now let's shift to, let me think like a country.

3:10:22.340 --> 3:10:26.480
 So we have country A, B, and C, and you can look at the nuclear arms race.

3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:28.940
 So we know that Germany was really close.

3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:31.040
 We know that Russia was getting pretty close.

3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:34.680
 We just won the race and we were the first ones with it.

3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:35.680
 And still to this day.

3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:36.880
 And Germany could have won.

3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:38.200
 They could have won.

3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:41.640
 They could have won, but someone was smart enough to not finish the equation when they

3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:43.600
 knew they had the answer.

3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:45.000
 It's literally what it comes down to.

3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:49.920
 Someone was smart enough to realize if that, that got into the hands of the Nazis, that

3:10:49.920 --> 3:10:51.880
 that would be the end.

3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:56.280
 And that's, that's a tough call to do that, knowing that you have the answer and you can't

3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:58.300
 solve the problem because it will go into the wrong end.

3:10:58.300 --> 3:10:59.300
 And that's kind of the fear.

3:10:59.300 --> 3:11:03.960
 When you look at this, you go, okay, so if we do this, if we put it out there, we've

3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:06.040
 got this technology.

3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:09.080
 If we don't work on it kind of international space station, like we're all going to work

3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:15.120
 on it together in a, you know, like Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty free from

3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:16.120
 any weapons or anything.

3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:17.840
 And we're supposed to, you know, we've got the international thing down there.

3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:19.200
 We're all going to work together.

3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:24.600
 If you did it in a, in the confines of that and you could control the flow in and out,

3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:27.720
 because what you don't want is the, someone stealing information and getting it back to

3:11:27.720 --> 3:11:31.280
 where, and countries are notorious to do this, Hey, we're doing it internationally, but we're

3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:36.000
 secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come up with a solution first.

3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:40.680
 That's the problem because we have this inherent thing of power and technology like that is

3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:41.680
 power.

3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:46.120
 It would, it would literally change the game of the way the world operates and from not

3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:52.160
 just a transportation or mankind, but from a military aspect, it's got huge, huge.

3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:53.160
 Yeah.

3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:54.160
 Yeah.

3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:59.560
 I, so beautifully, beautifully presented and there's, I feel like there's a tension between

3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:04.480
 those two places, the scientist view of the world and the national security view of the

3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:05.480
 world.

3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:12.240
 Let me, let me get to this kind of interesting point, which is a lot of conspiracy theorists

3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:17.360
 kind of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally, as a hierarchical system that's

3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:22.020
 exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets.

3:12:22.020 --> 3:12:26.720
 And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe to almost any conspiracy theory, to the degree

3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:34.200
 at least that the conspiracy theorists do, but the, there does seem to be, and I tend

3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:41.340
 to think of government as unfortunately incompetent, at least the bureaucracy.

3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:45.640
 It seems that the communication, like the three videos that were released and just the

3:12:45.640 --> 3:12:54.400
 way of DOD in general talks about the things we've been talking about, it's just confused.

3:12:54.400 --> 3:13:00.720
 There's contradictory, it's not inspiring, it's, it's suspicious.

3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:03.880
 It's just not even the way they released the videos.

3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:09.900
 You know, the Tic Tac, if presented correctly, could just inspire a generation of scientists.

3:13:09.900 --> 3:13:15.640
 It's like at the, you know, us going to the moon and it's inspiring.

3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:20.480
 I mean, it's incredible, you know, and, and the way it was released, it was suspicious.

3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:27.560
 It was like low resolution video on a crappy website, like with some crappy documents.

3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:29.880
 And I mean, why, what is it?

3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:32.960
 I don't know how to ask this question, but can government do better?

3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:38.040
 Why are they doing it this way in terms of communicating the things they do know to the

3:13:38.040 --> 3:13:39.040
 public?

3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.520
 I don't know how, especially in this topic, it's been hidden for so many years.

3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:49.480
 And I don't think, cause I don't buy off on the conspiracy stuff, I just think that, you

3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:53.960
 know, when it comes in, like I said, you know, the government has the right to classify stuff.

3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:56.480
 They classify everything cause they don't know.

3:13:56.480 --> 3:13:58.000
 You have something, you don't know what it is, you don't know.

3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.880
 So we just go, well, it must be, it must be top secret and let's put it in a vault.

3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:05.360
 You know, it's kind of like the Indiana Jones where they take the ark and they put it in,

3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:08.200
 it's in the giant army warehouse.

3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:10.700
 You know, we don't even know what we have.

3:14:10.700 --> 3:14:15.440
 So, but I also believe that, you know, and I'll say this openly, I don't think that the

3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:17.360
 American people need to know everything.

3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:22.980
 I think there's a reason that stuff is classified for the protection of this country.

3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:24.600
 And I totally believe in that.

3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:29.360
 So, you know, I was joking with Joe when he was talking about the storm area 51.

3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:33.760
 So I'm like, yeah, that's probably the worst idea you could possibly have is to just storm

3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:35.680
 a military installation.

3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:36.960
 It's just stupid.

3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:40.520
 There are reasons, there are reasons that we have things that we don't just let out

3:14:40.520 --> 3:14:41.520
 to the public.

3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:46.880
 Because if we do, as soon as you do let someone know that you have something, they immediately

3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:48.080
 try to counter it.

3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:54.440
 And perfect example, the U.S. in the 60s developed a bomber, it was a Mach 3 compression lift

3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:56.200
 bomber called the XB 70.

3:14:56.200 --> 3:14:57.200
 Okay.

3:14:57.200 --> 3:14:59.940
 There was three of them built, three of them ever built.

3:14:59.940 --> 3:15:05.200
 It was a like 60,000 foot high, you know, Mach 3, it was an incredible airplane when

3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:08.520
 you see it, and there's actually the last one remaining is in Dayton, Ohio at the museum.

3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:11.760
 You know, it would go, the wingtips would fold on, it looks like a Concorde, but it's

3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:15.480
 way faster.

3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:20.800
 When that got out that we were developing it, the Soviet Union developed the MiG 25,

3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:25.160
 literally a high altitude interceptor to counter that bomber.

3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:29.680
 And they built an entire fleet of MiG 25s, right?

3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:35.280
 We built three XB 70s and we scrapped the program, right?

3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:40.440
 Because now you go, well, the technology is cool, we proved it, but now it becomes obsolete.

3:15:40.440 --> 3:15:43.260
 So it's not even worth building a whole fleet of these things.

3:15:43.260 --> 3:15:44.660
 You know, it's a chess game.

3:15:44.660 --> 3:15:48.520
 We do something, they do something, we do something, they do something, and we do something

3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:49.520
 and then they counter it.

3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:51.360
 You got to figure out how to defeat it.

3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:53.080
 So you go, oh, we'll build something.

3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:58.880
 So the more we keep quiet, especially from a defense standpoint, the better.

3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:01.200
 Actually, personally, I think we talk too much.

3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:07.440
 And I think the military and the DOD is starting to see that we're too open.

3:16:07.440 --> 3:16:10.120
 You announce, hey, we're building this because there's a budget line and we live in a free

3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:16.820
 society, but you don't have to release all the specs and you don't have to put everything

3:16:16.820 --> 3:16:18.000
 in open source.

3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:21.400
 But that's a problem when we go to the universities.

3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:24.880
 If we want to go do work with MIT and you want to partner with MIT and you're a defense

3:16:24.880 --> 3:16:29.240
 company and you want to partner, you know, you guys have a rule that if you create it,

3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:34.320
 then it can be open source because the university owns it and we are an institution of learning.

3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:38.840
 Where the defense side might go, we don't really want that published in a paper in Scientific

3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:39.840
 America.

3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:40.840
 It's so heartbreaking.

3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:47.240
 I talked to CTO of Lockheed, Keiko Jackson, and just Concord's.

3:16:47.240 --> 3:16:54.040
 Some of the best, if not the best engineering and science, but engineering really ever is

3:16:54.040 --> 3:17:01.080
 done in secrecy and it sucks because it's so inspiring and they can't talk about it.

3:17:01.080 --> 3:17:03.320
 It is, but some of it's due to funding.

3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:04.880
 The US government has deep pockets.

3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:08.960
 You know, some of this new technology that you develop for an open source and lesson,

3:17:08.960 --> 3:17:11.200
 this goes back to the original conversation.

3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:15.520
 We now, there's enough money in the private sector that individuals control.

3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:19.160
 Bezos, I'm not talking Amazon.

3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:23.720
 I'm talking Jeff Bezos, a single individual worth over a hundred billion dollars.

3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:25.280
 He has the ability to do stuff.

3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:31.360
 I'll tell you what, the Gates Foundation with between Bill Gates and his wife and Warren

3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:36.680
 Buffett and some of the other money, because I think Bezos's ex wife actually donated a

3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:40.120
 huge chunk of her half into the Gates Foundation.

3:17:40.120 --> 3:17:43.200
 What's the Gates Foundation worth these days?

3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:46.760
 These are guys, brilliant, brilliant.

3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:49.520
 Some of the greatest minds that we have to go, what are they doing?

3:17:49.520 --> 3:17:52.520
 Because they have the ability to, it's a nonprofit, they can go, hey, I want to fund this.

3:17:52.520 --> 3:17:53.800
 I want to fund this research.

3:17:53.800 --> 3:17:56.000
 They can look beyond the conflict between nations.

3:17:56.000 --> 3:17:59.720
 You can look beyond the conflict of having to have classification.

3:17:59.720 --> 3:18:01.880
 You could do what you want.

3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:10.540
 It's just like, we classify how to do the whole nuclear, how to create a critical mass.

3:18:10.540 --> 3:18:13.640
 But there's really smart high school kids that have figured it out mathematically and

3:18:13.640 --> 3:18:14.640
 they do their science project.

3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:17.160
 And then the government comes in and says, hey, we got to classify your government because

3:18:17.160 --> 3:18:20.600
 we just don't want this out in the public domain, which I understand.

3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:23.640
 And they never stopped them from free thought and developing that.

3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:26.240
 It's just, hey, we really don't want this out there.

3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:27.240
 Okay.

3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:28.240
 So I understand that.

3:18:28.240 --> 3:18:29.240
 I totally understand that.

3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:33.400
 But if Bill and Melinda want to do this and go, hey, we want to do this and they're going

3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:36.760
 to work with Bezos and they're going to work with Elon and we're going to, I mean, you

3:18:36.760 --> 3:18:37.760
 think about it.

3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:41.080
 There's a significant amount of money that could be available to R&D and I'm not talking

3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:45.040
 just science like this, I'm talking medical research and all this.

3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:46.280
 But then you go, well, who gets it?

3:18:46.280 --> 3:18:49.720
 Because now you're competing against the companies that actually do it.

3:18:49.720 --> 3:18:52.000
 You go, is that, well, are they the greatest minds?

3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:58.160
 I'd say, you know, we have a tendency to go, these are the best that we have.

3:18:58.160 --> 3:19:00.760
 And I'd say, well, no, that's the best that we know we have.

3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:03.080
 But there's probably people out there that don't want to work.

3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:05.740
 There's brilliant minds that don't want to do anything with defense because they just

3:19:05.740 --> 3:19:07.380
 disagree with what it does.

3:19:07.380 --> 3:19:10.320
 So they go to another path, they can do something else.

3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:17.080
 And in a sense, like the Elons of the world that Jeff Bezos actually in a certain sense

3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:23.040
 much better than DOD at finding the brilliant, weird minds out there.

3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:24.320
 Because they're not tied to the government.

3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:28.840
 So when you work a government contract, the government writes, they tell you what they

3:19:28.840 --> 3:19:33.640
 want and then they work with you on the requirements and they usually have an end in mean.

3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:36.840
 You know, they have an idea that this is what I want it to be.

3:19:36.840 --> 3:19:43.880
 Where if you go to like SpaceX, where, you know, they come up with, why don't we just

3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:46.440
 land these things on a pad and reuse them?

3:19:46.440 --> 3:19:49.680
 Well, if the government scientist, if you're on a government contract says, no, that's

3:19:49.680 --> 3:19:50.680
 not the requirements.

3:19:50.680 --> 3:19:51.680
 We're not paying for that.

3:19:51.680 --> 3:19:52.680
 We want you to do this.

3:19:52.680 --> 3:19:53.840
 You're kind of controlled.

3:19:53.840 --> 3:19:57.000
 Or when Elon does it, his company, they can do whatever the hell they want to do because

3:19:57.000 --> 3:19:58.620
 they have no bounds.

3:19:58.620 --> 3:20:02.220
 The only bounds they have is the liability if it doesn't work and it lands on something.

3:20:02.220 --> 3:20:03.220
 So what do you do?

3:20:03.220 --> 3:20:04.220
 You go out to Kwajalein and you test it.

3:20:04.220 --> 3:20:06.640
 And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean, hey, we clean it up.

3:20:06.640 --> 3:20:07.640
 No big deal.

3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:10.000
 We lost some money, but we'll move on.

3:20:10.000 --> 3:20:13.960
 It's, you know, money makes the world go around contrary to what everyone thinks.

3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:17.080
 But, you know, there's a lot of money that's sitting around that you can do a lot of really

3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:18.080
 cool stuff with.

3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:19.080
 And I don't know.

3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:23.640
 I mean, I'll guarantee that, what is it, Blue Origin, isn't that Amazon?

3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:26.520
 You know, that they're doing some cool stuff because they have funny.

3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:30.940
 And I joke with the guy I know that worked at SpaceX and he was funny because they were

3:20:30.940 --> 3:20:35.320
 building the first test thing and they were limited.

3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:42.000
 And Elon found this like 400 acre thing, I think it's about 400 acres down by Waco, Texas.

3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:46.840
 And he's like, I go, how, he goes, dude, I worked, he goes, I worked with, he goes, because

3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:47.840
 he's done government contract.

3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:49.040
 He goes, there's government contract.

3:20:49.040 --> 3:20:51.720
 And then there's working at SpaceX with Elon money.

3:20:51.720 --> 3:20:55.220
 And that's what he refers to it as, is Elon money, where it was like, don't, I'll throw

3:20:55.220 --> 3:20:57.460
 them and he would throw the money at it and make it happen.

3:20:57.460 --> 3:20:58.960
 And it's, I'm talking this fast.

3:20:58.960 --> 3:21:01.800
 I mean, he talks about, he has a great story about this.

3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:04.740
 I mean, this is Elon, but this is how fast you can do in the private sector vice the

3:21:04.740 --> 3:21:07.160
 government where there's the bureaucracy is.

3:21:07.160 --> 3:21:11.240
 They had a company that was a, basically a tool and die machine shop that did a lot of

3:21:11.240 --> 3:21:15.600
 their high precision parts for the rockets.

3:21:15.600 --> 3:21:18.080
 They had went to the guy, but he had contracts with other companies.

3:21:18.080 --> 3:21:22.360
 And when the economy was down, the guy was actually looking at going out of business.

3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:24.860
 So the guy I know, he's telling me the story.

3:21:24.860 --> 3:21:26.840
 He was talking to the guy, he had to go over there and get something.

3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:27.840
 And he's like, holy shit.

3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:28.840
 He goes, hang on.

3:21:28.840 --> 3:21:32.280
 So he calls up on the phone, SpaceX, he says, Hey, is Elon there?

3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:33.280
 Can you get them in the boardroom?

3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:35.280
 We'll be there in 20 minutes.

3:21:35.280 --> 3:21:39.160
 So he grabs this guy who's literally going to fold his company.

3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:42.640
 They go over to SpaceX and I may be getting some of this wrong if people are going to

3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:44.820
 fact check me, but this is pretty close.

3:21:44.820 --> 3:21:52.600
 They go in the boardroom and he said, literally within like an hour or two, Elon has bought

3:21:52.600 --> 3:21:53.780
 the guy's company.

3:21:53.780 --> 3:21:57.340
 That guy is now a senior VP running his company.

3:21:57.340 --> 3:22:01.200
 And they're going to pull all the stuff into the SpaceX thing so they can actually build

3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:05.440
 the parts and they can still contract out to make the money outside.

3:22:05.440 --> 3:22:07.200
 And it happened like that fast.

3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:10.880
 It's not just money, it's because I've witnessed it too with Elon.

3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:19.120
 I think it's whatever the forces of capitalism that allow a person like Elon Musk to rise

3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:27.140
 to the top, because I've also worked for DARPA for research in terms of a source of funding.

3:22:27.140 --> 3:22:32.200
 There's a weight of bureaucracy when I was working, being funded by DARPA.

3:22:32.200 --> 3:22:37.180
 And with Elon, I was literally in the presence of anything is possible, cutting across all

3:22:37.180 --> 3:22:43.080
 the bullshit of paperwork, of the way things were done in the past, of the bureaucracy,

3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:48.280
 the rules, the constraints, all of that stuff, just you can cut across immediately.

3:22:48.280 --> 3:22:51.480
 How much money and time do you waste dealing with your bureaucracy when you could actually

3:22:51.480 --> 3:22:53.200
 be doing real work?

3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:54.200
 That's the difference.

3:22:54.200 --> 3:22:58.400
 This is why I honestly, when I went back to the industrial defense complex that we were

3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:03.200
 warned about, when you look at it and go, SpaceX can do something for half the price

3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:08.120
 ahead of schedule that what Boeing, we're paying Boeing, and you go, oh, well, this

3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:09.120
 just came out.

3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:12.520
 And you go, well, then why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this

3:23:12.520 --> 3:23:13.620
 side?

3:23:13.620 --> 3:23:17.240
 Because you've got a fully automated capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly

3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:18.660
 around in.

3:23:18.660 --> 3:23:19.760
 It worked like a champ.

3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:23.720
 It went up, it hung out, it came back, it splashed down.

3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:25.960
 It worked perfectly.

3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:26.960
 We're going to dust it off.

3:23:26.960 --> 3:23:32.480
 And oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules that were used and then put to museums, they're

3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:34.040
 going to reuse that dragon capsule.

3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:36.920
 It came down, they're going to dust it off, put a new coat of paint on it, slap it on

3:23:36.920 --> 3:23:39.960
 top of another rocket and away it goes.

3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:40.960
 Holy cow.

3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:41.960
 It's amazing.

3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:42.960
 It's a shift.

3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:43.960
 It's a complete shift in mentality.

3:23:43.960 --> 3:23:47.240
 And for us as taxpayers, we can explore at half the cost.

3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:54.680
 It's exciting, especially given putting the Tic Tac in context, like then the sky or it's

3:23:54.680 --> 3:23:57.480
 limitless the possibilities we could do with this kind of mechanism.

3:23:57.480 --> 3:23:58.480
 I think it's exciting.

3:23:58.480 --> 3:23:59.480
 Yeah.

3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:00.480
 I think we live in an exciting time right now.

3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:02.800
 This is everything that's messed up in the world right now.

3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:08.000
 Well, this is a hopeful, like there's so much conflict going on, so much tension.

3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:14.240
 That's to me, space exploration at the moment is a reason to get up in the morning and have

3:24:14.240 --> 3:24:18.400
 a hope for the future, to look up to the sky and we're humans.

3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:22.080
 We can solve so many, we can solve all of this.

3:24:22.080 --> 3:24:26.880
 I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing and I said, this would be great, because

3:24:26.880 --> 3:24:30.800
 then the government had come out a month ago and said, hey, this does exist.

3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:33.840
 We're doing this and we're going to release more stuff.

3:24:33.840 --> 3:24:38.080
 And I was texting like Lou and Chris Mellon and those guys before I went on, because they

3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:42.700
 had called me up to be on Tucker's show and I'm like, hey, I go, this would be great.

3:24:42.700 --> 3:24:48.200
 Just come out with this, find the relic of a spaceship, like pull out the Roswell wreckage

3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:51.520
 if you have it, pull out the Roswell wreckage and do it.

3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:57.320
 God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with the riots in the cities.

3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:01.320
 I know it's an election year and all that, but God, it would be refreshing to not have

3:25:01.320 --> 3:25:05.480
 to turn on my TV and see everything that is just depressing in the world.

3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:09.640
 To begin, holy cow, we actually do have this and we're working on this technology.

3:25:09.640 --> 3:25:14.220
 Imagine if there is a Roswell aircraft and they pull it out, imagine the innovation that

3:25:14.220 --> 3:25:19.500
 happens in the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than that.

3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:24.080
 Just the innovation that happens, the look on Elon Musk's face, the look on Jeff Bezos's

3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:25.840
 face and all the brilliance in years.

3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:26.840
 It would change the game.

3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:27.840
 It would change the game.

3:25:27.840 --> 3:25:28.840
 It would change the game completely.

3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:33.560
 Let me ask the big question, I apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it.

3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:42.000
 Outside, I mean, one of the things, the fact that you've laid your eyes on a UFO probably

3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:48.160
 opened your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings, there could be other

3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:50.800
 sightings that have legitimacy to them.

3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:59.180
 What to you is the, outside of your own sighting, is the most interesting sighting or UFO related

3:25:59.180 --> 3:26:01.520
 event in history?

3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:03.000
 I think there's several.

3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:04.000
 What is it?

3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:09.640
 Ramassan Forest in England, the US guys that saw stuff and actually got radiation burns.

3:26:09.640 --> 3:26:14.120
 One guy was medically disabled, but they weren't going to give him and he had help from John

3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:15.120
 McCain.

3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:20.000
 His office helped get the guy's disability reestablished.

3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:22.720
 I think that's a big one.

3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:27.040
 I think there's people out there that have seen stuff and I'm talking credible because

3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:31.440
 there's, you got to remember, there's a huge chunk of the sightings that get disproven.

3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:35.000
 They're actually explainable.

3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:39.760
 You had sent me the question, the Phoenix lights, I think there's...

3:26:39.760 --> 3:26:40.760
 What's that?

3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:43.360
 So I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with some of these.

3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:46.200
 I'm not either, you want a funny story on that.

3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:53.760
 So I was at a conference, hopefully he doesn't watch this and get offended, but we had this,

3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:54.960
 I call it speed dating.

3:26:54.960 --> 3:26:58.680
 So there was a table, about eight people at a table and we would go sit at the table and

3:26:58.680 --> 3:27:02.000
 they could ask us questions and then after 10 minutes we moved to the next table.

3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:04.880
 So I was speed dating all these people that are really into this.

3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:08.720
 It was kind of funny, but I had sat down and it's always funny because some people will

3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:13.320
 try and dominate it, but you have to kind of push the dominators away so that if you're

3:27:13.320 --> 3:27:16.560
 quiet and introverted, you can ask your question too.

3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:19.500
 So we got into this and the guy starts naming all these, well, what about this?

3:27:19.500 --> 3:27:20.500
 What about the Phoenix lights?

3:27:20.500 --> 3:27:21.640
 I'm like, I don't know about the Phoenix lights.

3:27:21.640 --> 3:27:22.640
 What about this event?

3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:23.640
 I don't know about that.

3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:26.720
 He goes, he looks at me and he goes, well, you're not a UFO guy.

3:27:26.720 --> 3:27:29.240
 I go, no, I'm not, but I chased one.

3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:30.240
 So I'm an expert.

3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:31.240
 Have you?

3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:33.960
 And you could see him get deflated because I'm kind of a smart ass like that.

3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:38.600
 Yeah, I mean the firsthand experience from a credible, in some sense these sightings

3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:41.440
 have to do both with the evidence and the human.

3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:46.200
 Well, I think part of that is to us, that's a credibility piece because the four of us

3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:50.840
 that actually saw it, plus the other two that were in the airplane that shot the video,

3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:53.560
 none of us are UFO obsessed people.

3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:59.200
 So when we come out and say, because to me it's five minutes of my life, I did a lot

3:27:59.200 --> 3:28:06.400
 of really cool, I've had really kind of neat things I've been able to do.

3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:14.280
 But when you look at it and go, to me it's not the pinnacle of my life.

3:28:14.280 --> 3:28:18.920
 To other people that they live in the UFO world and it's like they, if you talk to people

3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:26.440
 that are really into it, who've never seen one, it kills them that they didn't see one.

3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:30.920
 When here we are, and what's unique with ours, which kind of adds that level is we just didn't

3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:31.920
 see it.

3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:34.880
 It wasn't like, oh look, something in the sky and it was weird.

3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:39.000
 We actually engaged with it, it was an engaged five minute thing.

3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:44.080
 And there's other stories from other countries, like there's a story in the back when the

3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:49.080
 Soviet Union existed that they actually would chase these things and one of them shot at

3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:53.480
 some, it shot it because they said shoot at it and it shot it and then it got shot down.

3:28:53.480 --> 3:28:56.880
 And then they said, don't ever shoot at them again and don't chase them, just you can observe

3:28:56.880 --> 3:29:00.320
 them, but don't go after them because obviously they have firepower that we can't control

3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:03.920
 because if you can make something float around and jam radars at will and do whatever you

3:29:03.920 --> 3:29:09.760
 want, modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful.

3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:13.120
 You can go to Independence Day, they had that force field around, oh, we got to, now you

3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.440
 got a cyber warfare, you got to take the bug down, you got to take the warfare, so now

3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:19.000
 we can actually inhibit some type of damage.

3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:25.060
 So there's, I mean, you mentioned the Phoenix lights, somebody on I think Reddit said, ask

3:29:25.060 --> 3:29:28.720
 them any thoughts on mass UFO sightings like the Phoenix lights.

3:29:28.720 --> 3:29:33.200
 So the interesting thing, like you said with the Tic Tac is that multiple people laid their

3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:34.760
 eyes on this.

3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:37.280
 What are your thoughts about the Phoenix lights where many people have seen it?

3:29:37.280 --> 3:29:39.960
 So here's the deal with massive sightings.

3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:43.320
 So the Phoenix lights is unexplainable, although I know the Air Force had said something about

3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:44.800
 it was an A10 drop in flares.

3:29:44.800 --> 3:29:47.320
 No, I don't think so.

3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:51.720
 Flares don't burn that long, they just come out and they detract and they go away.

3:29:51.720 --> 3:29:55.800
 Although on the other hand, there's, because clouds can do things, so I lived in Central

3:29:55.800 --> 3:30:01.040
 California for 18 years and you would get, oh my God, what was that in the sky and it

3:30:01.040 --> 3:30:03.460
 was really Vandenberg shooting a missile off.

3:30:03.460 --> 3:30:07.260
 They were doing ICBM tests at one time where they shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across

3:30:07.260 --> 3:30:11.640
 and they go land in the Atoll at Kwajalein and then they can check the displacement,

3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:16.720
 the accuracy and all that stuff, it's stuff that we do because we're a superpower.

3:30:16.720 --> 3:30:19.880
 But when you see them go up, especially if you've ever watched a rocket really launch

3:30:19.880 --> 3:30:22.960
 on a clear night, it'll have the stream, the glow, and you can tell it's a rocket, but

3:30:22.960 --> 3:30:26.740
 if you don't look up until later when it starts to get to the outer edge of the atmosphere

3:30:26.740 --> 3:30:31.180
 where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained, and you can watch this on

3:30:31.180 --> 3:30:34.920
 TV when even the SpaceX ones go up, it's nice and narrow, narrow, narrow, and then it hits

3:30:34.920 --> 3:30:38.600
 a point where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides because the

3:30:38.600 --> 3:30:43.760
 forces aren't holding that all into one unique thing and it looks really odd and then it'll

3:30:43.760 --> 3:30:48.380
 go off because it burns out and then you get stage separation, then you see the next one

3:30:48.380 --> 3:30:51.320
 go off and then it's gone.

3:30:51.320 --> 3:30:53.920
 And people don't understand that because they didn't watch it from launch because we used

3:30:53.920 --> 3:30:57.400
 to sit in our driveway and Vandenberg, it was a three hour drive, but you could sit and

3:30:57.400 --> 3:30:58.400
 watch it.

3:30:58.400 --> 3:31:02.520
 You knew they were launching at night, you'd watch, you'd watch and it's really cool.

3:31:02.520 --> 3:31:06.200
 If you don't see anything, what you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plume, what's

3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:10.080
 left, the residue that's sitting in the atmosphere and the wind starts blowing it so you get

3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:13.400
 these really kind of weird shapes in the sky.

3:31:13.400 --> 3:31:17.160
 That's part, but when you go to Phoenix Lights and you go, hey, when a thousand people see

3:31:17.160 --> 3:31:19.440
 something, are you going to discredit all a thousand people or are you going to try

3:31:19.440 --> 3:31:26.760
 and explain it away with something else, you know, it's a weather balloon, it's a weather

3:31:26.760 --> 3:31:27.760
 balloon.

3:31:27.760 --> 3:31:34.160
 Again, just like the Tic Tac, I think is just inspiring for the limitless nature of the

3:31:34.160 --> 3:31:35.760
 science.

3:31:35.760 --> 3:31:37.400
 I think more is going to come out.

3:31:37.400 --> 3:31:42.760
 I think some of the stuff that the To The Stars folks have done.

3:31:42.760 --> 3:31:44.880
 So there's a To The Stars Academy.

3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:45.880
 What are your thoughts about them?

3:31:45.880 --> 3:31:46.880
 Are they?

3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:48.520
 I talk to them quite a bit.

3:31:48.520 --> 3:31:52.280
 I'm not a part of To The Stars Academy.

3:31:52.280 --> 3:31:57.320
 But I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this.

3:31:57.320 --> 3:31:58.320
 What's their mission?

3:31:58.320 --> 3:31:59.320
 What's their hope?

3:31:59.320 --> 3:32:06.380
 When they started, their mission was to try and, don't look at this as little green men,

3:32:06.380 --> 3:32:11.600
 but let's look at this as a technology and let's try and almost reverse engineer and

3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:17.240
 figure out how these things operate and how can we explain this from using our knowledge,

3:32:17.240 --> 3:32:20.080
 workspace knowledge to go, how would something like this operate?

3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:24.520
 That's really their bottom line was to try and use and then couple that with, because

3:32:24.520 --> 3:32:31.600
 they've got the series unidentified, couple that with television to get the word out.

3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:34.800
 So you're actually putting something instead of...

3:32:34.800 --> 3:32:39.320
 Because everyone has a theory, you know, Ancient Aliens covers all kinds of theories, you know,

3:32:39.320 --> 3:32:43.560
 it's kind of off of, oh my God, and I've seen the stuff and I've seen stuff that I've said

3:32:43.560 --> 3:32:48.040
 taken out of context on shows that I did not talk to.

3:32:48.040 --> 3:32:51.200
 So there's all that, because you can take a clip and go, oh, it's this, it's that, you

3:32:51.200 --> 3:32:52.200
 know?

3:32:52.200 --> 3:32:55.200
 And if I know about stuff like it, you can't technically use my likeness unless I tell

3:32:55.200 --> 3:32:56.420
 you you can.

3:32:56.420 --> 3:32:59.080
 So if I haven't signed something you can't do, there was a guy who put something out,

3:32:59.080 --> 3:33:01.560
 you know, I was in it and I told him, you can take it down and you can talk to lawyers

3:33:01.560 --> 3:33:03.680
 because I'm not supporting you.

3:33:03.680 --> 3:33:07.600
 So they use it to tell some kind of narrative that's not connected to reality.

3:33:07.600 --> 3:33:10.920
 Because let's face it, if you're making TV shows, there's two reasons to do it.

3:33:10.920 --> 3:33:15.160
 One, you want to get word out, or two, you want to make money, or three, both.

3:33:15.160 --> 3:33:19.600
 And so usually it's, I would say the make money is probably the biggest thing to put

3:33:19.600 --> 3:33:20.600
 a TV show out.

3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:27.240
 And the mission of the To The Stars Academy is to not do that, is to try to get some...

3:33:27.240 --> 3:33:31.720
 When they started and I talked to them, because I've talked to Tom and I've talked to Lou

3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:38.200
 and those are the two main players, it was to basically demystify the fact and get rid

3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:43.220
 of the stigma that's tied to UFOs, and let's look at it from a science base and then use

3:33:43.220 --> 3:33:45.800
 TV to get the word out on the progress.

3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:47.000
 And they've done some pretty cool things.

3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:52.720
 I mean, you know, the Italian government gave them all kinds of files that had been property

3:33:52.720 --> 3:33:53.720
 of their government.

3:33:53.720 --> 3:33:54.720
 They got a bunch from...

3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:59.340
 It might have been Argentina gave them all kinds of stuff, like, here's all our records,

3:33:59.340 --> 3:34:00.340
 what can you do with it?

3:34:00.340 --> 3:34:04.800
 To try and now pull from country based to a more global based research, which is what

3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:09.800
 you were talking about, and then using independent scientists that are not tied to a government.

3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:13.840
 I mean, any government, but just using independent research agencies to start looking at some

3:34:13.840 --> 3:34:16.960
 of the metallurgy, because you go, oh, I found this, we had this piece of metal, what is

3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:17.960
 it?

3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:18.960
 And some of the stuff has been explained.

3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:22.000
 They've got some objects, artifacts that have not been explained.

3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.600
 And that's slowly coming out, you know, and I think...

3:34:24.600 --> 3:34:27.760
 And your hope is the US government will release some more things?

3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:33.480
 The US government came out a month ago and said, we have material that we cannot explain

3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:35.220
 the origin.

3:34:35.220 --> 3:34:36.220
 They have said that.

3:34:36.220 --> 3:34:39.520
 They just haven't released the records from the Roswell thing, which I keep joking about.

3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:41.320
 I'm like, come on, it's 70 some years old.

3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:43.440
 I mean, like, let it out.

3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:49.640
 I think you put it beautifully that in this time, that will be a heck of an inspiring,

3:34:49.640 --> 3:34:50.640
 hopeful thing to see.

3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:52.040
 Like people don't...

3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:53.040
 Just to distract them.

3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:54.040
 Right?

3:34:54.040 --> 3:35:02.360
 Yeah, the division is, I mean, nothing will unite us humans, descendants of chimps.

3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:05.800
 Like the idea that there's life out there.

3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:06.800
 It would literally change.

3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:10.640
 I said this a while ago, I think it was the London Sun Times had called me and I said,

3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:12.480
 you know, personally, I think this is a global issue.

3:35:12.480 --> 3:35:13.480
 It's not.

3:35:13.480 --> 3:35:16.400
 If there is stuff coming down, which we're pretty sure there is, there's enough stuff

3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:18.520
 that we can't explain.

3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:21.720
 If there is stuff coming down, then this is not a country based thing and it's not about

3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:25.360
 technology and it's not about who's going to win the next war because you don't know

3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:27.000
 what they're doing.

3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.360
 So you got really a couple of theories.

3:35:29.360 --> 3:35:35.400
 One, you've got ET or close encounters and the other extreme is you've got Independence

3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:36.660
 Day.

3:35:36.660 --> 3:35:41.880
 Are you going to prepare and bet on ET and close encounters or do you actually try and

3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:45.560
 do stuff in case it is Independence Day, you actually have a game plan.

3:35:45.560 --> 3:35:49.680
 And when you get into Independence Day, that scenario, you know, and I don't like going

3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:54.820
 too much into sci fi, but let's just say in theory that that becomes a reality.

3:35:54.820 --> 3:36:02.980
 It's not a US, Russia, China, England, France, Spain, name any country in any continent.

3:36:02.980 --> 3:36:07.560
 It becomes a global issue and the only way you can deny it, it's just like Americans.

3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:10.760
 We all, you know, we're divided.

3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:11.920
 We spend that way forever.

3:36:11.920 --> 3:36:14.280
 So if you think we won't get through this, we'll get through it because we've had times

3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:16.080
 just like this before.

3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:17.400
 Until Nazi Germany pops up.

3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:20.980
 But Nazi Germany pops up or someone flies two airplanes into the World Trade Center

3:36:20.980 --> 3:36:22.720
 and then all of a sudden we're all like united.

3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:25.640
 We all also have very, very short memories.

3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:27.040
 Yes, we do.

3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:28.040
 Exactly.

3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:34.760
 It's when you look and go, well, we can do this and you go, no, no, if you think that

3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:41.560
 everyone on the planet is good, you need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking.

3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:46.080
 You know, we said this, there were people during the rise of Hitler, no, no, it's it's

3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:47.080
 OK.

3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:48.080
 And no, no, it's OK.

3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:49.080
 We're not going to do.

3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:50.080
 We're not going to stop.

3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:51.080
 No, no, it's OK.

3:36:51.080 --> 3:36:52.080
 No, no, it's OK.

3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:53.080
 No, no, it's OK.

3:36:53.080 --> 3:36:59.240
 The only thing that stopped Hitler was his ego by going into Russia.

3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:03.960
 If he just stuck with the pact with Stalin and not went to the east and had to fight

3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:07.800
 and it was really the Russian winner that crushed him and he would have put all his

3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:12.600
 high troops to the other side, there would have been a totally different outcome.

3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:16.840
 The man in the iron, the man in the high tower, whatever, it's a Netflix show where Nazi actually

3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:17.840
 wins it.

3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:22.480
 And you look, you know, we didn't know everything that was going on, especially the atrocities

3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:26.160
 with the concentration camps and what he was doing to the Jews.

3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:29.600
 I mean, it's you look at that going, if you really want to see evil and then there's the

3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:33.960
 whole side of what Stalin did because he actually exterminated more people than Hitler did.

3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:36.040
 But that never gets the press.

3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:41.840
 And the thing is, we forget this, we forget this history in our conflicts today.

3:37:41.840 --> 3:37:44.160
 We forget that there is the nature of evil.

3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:47.400
 We forget that there's real evil in the world.

3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:53.200
 And the thing to fight that evil is to be united, to be both.

3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:59.160
 It's like this interesting line, like you talked about Joe Rogan, of being both like

3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:08.000
 kind to each other, compassionate, empathetic, but also being like strong and a bad motherfucker

3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:14.360
 when you need to, to make sure that you, that like there's a balance between kindness and

3:38:14.360 --> 3:38:15.360
 force.

3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:19.760
 You use force when force is necessary, but you don't have to walk around like Billy

3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:20.760
 Badass all the time.

3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:24.500
 I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with that literally could kick the

3:38:24.500 --> 3:38:28.760
 shit out of whoever came near them, they never got in fights because one, even people that

3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:31.840
 didn't know them, because they were actually nice guys.

3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:34.480
 You know, they were just good dudes.

3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:39.480
 But you know, if you cross them, like I had a friend of mine, he's a nationally ranked

3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:40.480
 wrestler.

3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:45.080
 He went to Naval Academy with me, he's a very, very good friend of mine.

3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:51.760
 And he is, when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 pounds and he did not lose a match

3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:54.440
 his senior year until he went to nationals, he just had a bad day.

3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:57.740
 He actually lost to a guy he had pummeled the shit out of.

3:38:57.740 --> 3:38:58.740
 And he would cross.

3:38:58.740 --> 3:39:01.920
 It was funny, we joke about it even with him, because when you meet him, he's like the nicest

3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:04.680
 like local, hey dude, you know, hey, how are you doing?

3:39:04.680 --> 3:39:05.680
 He's super nice.

3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:08.880
 And he would cross that ring on a wrestling mat.

3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:13.220
 As soon as he crossed that ring, it was like a totally different person and he would go

3:39:13.220 --> 3:39:15.360
 out there and just destroy people.

3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:19.640
 I mean, physically destroy, like put a hurt on.

3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:24.060
 And he would get done and he's like super humble and they'd raise his hand and he'd

3:39:24.060 --> 3:39:28.000
 have this blank expression, they'd raise his hand and he'd walk off and as soon as he crossed

3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:31.040
 the line, he'd look up and smile and go, hey, hi guys, how you doing?

3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:33.500
 Like he literally just went and could rip someone's arms off.

3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:35.400
 But as soon as he crossed the line, he was a totally different person.

3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:37.040
 He's like, and he's that way today.

3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:40.080
 He won't even tell you he's a wrestler.

3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:43.900
 That's kind of a symbol of the best of America.

3:39:43.900 --> 3:39:44.900
 That's what America is.

3:39:44.900 --> 3:39:45.900
 Oh, he's.

3:39:45.900 --> 3:39:46.900
 That wrestler.

3:39:46.900 --> 3:39:47.900
 He's a.

3:39:47.900 --> 3:39:53.900
 You cross the line, you can be hard, but once you're off the mat, you're just a kind human

3:39:53.900 --> 3:39:54.900
 being.

3:39:54.900 --> 3:39:55.900
 Yeah.

3:39:55.900 --> 3:40:06.520
 I know you're super humble, saying it's better to be lucky than good, but your story is inspiring.

3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:11.980
 The entire trajectory of having a dream, of accomplishing that dream, of having one hell

3:40:11.980 --> 3:40:13.700
 of a career.

3:40:13.700 --> 3:40:20.940
 What advice would you give to a young person, to a young version of yourself today that

3:40:20.940 --> 3:40:27.460
 listens to this and is inspired, that wants to fly or wants to go to space and wants to

3:40:27.460 --> 3:40:28.460
 build the rocket?

3:40:28.460 --> 3:40:34.020
 Is there advice you could give them about life, about career, about anything?

3:40:34.020 --> 3:40:35.020
 Yeah.

3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:36.020
 Yeah.

3:40:36.020 --> 3:40:43.300
 First, let me start with, and you had a question on, inspirational people.

3:40:43.300 --> 3:40:49.940
 My grandfather, I had mentioned him earlier, huge funeral, beer delivery guy, was delivering

3:40:49.940 --> 3:40:55.300
 beer in the 60s riots where the guys in the black neighborhoods where white people didn't

3:40:55.300 --> 3:40:56.340
 go.

3:40:56.340 --> 3:40:57.340
 My grandfather's Sicilian.

3:40:57.340 --> 3:41:00.200
 He was one of the first ones in his family born in the United States.

3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.180
 My great grandmother and I had aunts and uncles that I knew growing up that actually came

3:41:03.180 --> 3:41:06.000
 over on the boat.

3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:11.780
 Huge, huge guy and just the nicest, friendliest, would give you the shirt off his back, obviously

3:41:11.780 --> 3:41:12.780
 proven by his funeral.

3:41:12.780 --> 3:41:17.620
 I'm talking at his funeral, the head of the Black Panthers was at his funeral in Toledo,

3:41:17.620 --> 3:41:18.620
 Ohio.

3:41:18.620 --> 3:41:21.860
 The mafia guys were at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio.

3:41:21.860 --> 3:41:26.020
 It was literally a mix of who's who.

3:41:26.020 --> 3:41:29.140
 He had told me once, because when you're little, you start looking.

3:41:29.140 --> 3:41:32.340
 I grew up basically, I was probably middle class, lower middle class.

3:41:32.340 --> 3:41:33.340
 My dad was a fireman.

3:41:33.340 --> 3:41:34.340
 You're not rich.

3:41:34.340 --> 3:41:35.340
 He's working for the city.

3:41:35.340 --> 3:41:37.500
 Paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up.

3:41:37.500 --> 3:41:41.500
 I was talking to my grandfather one day and he said something to me, and this is literally

3:41:41.500 --> 3:41:42.500
 how I run my life.

3:41:42.500 --> 3:41:45.820
 He said, it was about money because you'd see back in the day, if you saw someone in

3:41:45.820 --> 3:41:47.580
 a Mercedes, that was rare.

3:41:47.580 --> 3:41:48.580
 They weren't everywhere.

3:41:48.580 --> 3:41:53.900
 You couldn't lease a car, you actually bought a car and usually bought a car with cash.

3:41:53.900 --> 3:41:56.080
 It was a totally different than we are now.

3:41:56.080 --> 3:42:00.340
 He said, he goes, you know, David, he goes, they're no better than you and you're no better

3:42:00.340 --> 3:42:01.340
 than anyone else.

3:42:01.340 --> 3:42:02.780
 He goes, you got to remember that.

3:42:02.780 --> 3:42:03.780
 He goes, everyone's different.

3:42:03.780 --> 3:42:07.660
 He goes, treat everyone with the respect and dignity that they deserve.

3:42:07.660 --> 3:42:13.340
 He goes, and if they're poor, if they're homeless, he goes, it doesn't make them a bad person.

3:42:13.340 --> 3:42:17.300
 That's who they chose to be and you make choices in your life, but never ever look down on

3:42:17.300 --> 3:42:20.820
 someone because there will always be someone that will look down on you and you should

3:42:20.820 --> 3:42:22.300
 never ever do that.

3:42:22.300 --> 3:42:23.300
 I kept that close to me.

3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:29.500
 He was a huge influence, my mom's dad, just a big, big influence in my life and the way

3:42:29.500 --> 3:42:31.900
 I carried myself.

3:42:31.900 --> 3:42:36.540
 He was one that would say, you can be anything you want to be.

3:42:36.540 --> 3:42:41.300
 He grew up dirt poor and the fact that he had bought a house and took good care of my

3:42:41.300 --> 3:42:45.740
 grandmother and did stuff like that, to him, that was a success.

3:42:45.740 --> 3:42:48.800
 To me, it was always trying to better and move on.

3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:53.820
 He was the one, my parents were a big part of this too, was instilling that anything

3:42:53.820 --> 3:42:55.020
 is possible.

3:42:55.020 --> 3:43:00.380
 When I'm four years and 11 months old in 1969 and I'm watching Neil Armstrong walk on the

3:43:00.380 --> 3:43:04.180
 moon and I'm asking my mom and she says, well, they were all military pilots.

3:43:04.180 --> 3:43:09.620
 We had an Air National Guard that at the time was flying F100, so I'm dating myself.

3:43:09.620 --> 3:43:12.780
 I was just fascinated with flight and I just looked at that going, that's really what I

3:43:12.780 --> 3:43:13.780
 want to do.

3:43:13.780 --> 3:43:14.780
 I never lost sight of that.

3:43:14.780 --> 3:43:16.380
 There was always, I could do this or do that.

3:43:16.380 --> 3:43:20.300
 When I was going to go to college before I enlisted in the Marine Corps, I was accepted

3:43:20.300 --> 3:43:24.780
 into Natural Resources at Ohio State and I'm like, if I can't fly, I'll go be a forest

3:43:24.780 --> 3:43:27.700
 ranger because I wanted to hang out in one of those towers in Colorado and look for

3:43:27.700 --> 3:43:30.980
 fires because that's just, I like that stuff.

3:43:30.980 --> 3:43:33.900
 It was that or be an oceanographer because I was fascinated with Jacques Cousteau and

3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:34.900
 actually that's my degree.

3:43:34.900 --> 3:43:38.940
 My undergrad degree is Jacques Cousteau, so influences are Neil Armstrong and Jacques

3:43:38.940 --> 3:43:39.940
 Cousteau.

3:43:39.940 --> 3:43:40.940
 I have an oceanography degree.

3:43:40.940 --> 3:43:45.740
 I got an MBA from University of Houston, go Cougs, got to mention them.

3:43:45.740 --> 3:43:48.300
 So you look and people go, what are you going to do with that?

3:43:48.300 --> 3:43:52.220
 And I said, I got an oceanography degree because I got, well, I'm going to sail on the ocean,

3:43:52.220 --> 3:43:56.300
 so at least if the ship sinks, I'll know where I'm at and that was a kind of a running joke

3:43:56.300 --> 3:43:57.300
 and then...

3:43:57.300 --> 3:44:03.860
 So these passions and underneath it is the belief that you can be anything you want to

3:44:03.860 --> 3:44:04.860
 be.

3:44:04.860 --> 3:44:05.860
 You can.

3:44:05.860 --> 3:44:09.540
 I told my kids this, when they were young, it was tough, especially for my son.

3:44:09.540 --> 3:44:13.540
 So when Nate was about five, six years, we knew Nate was colorblind.

3:44:13.540 --> 3:44:15.460
 My wife's brothers are both colorblind.

3:44:15.460 --> 3:44:16.460
 It's really color deprived.

3:44:16.460 --> 3:44:18.100
 Color blind, you see black and white.

3:44:18.100 --> 3:44:19.100
 He can't tell.

3:44:19.100 --> 3:44:20.960
 He has issues with greens, reds, browns.

3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:24.140
 It's funny if you're ever around someone like that because he'll go, what are you looking

3:44:24.140 --> 3:44:25.140
 at?

3:44:25.140 --> 3:44:26.140
 He goes right over there by the red thing.

3:44:26.140 --> 3:44:27.140
 I'm like, what are you looking at?

3:44:27.140 --> 3:44:28.140
 I go, this?

3:44:28.140 --> 3:44:29.140
 He had a hat on one day.

3:44:29.140 --> 3:44:30.140
 I go, which one are you going to get?

3:44:30.140 --> 3:44:31.140
 He had a hat in his hand.

3:44:31.140 --> 3:44:32.140
 It was green.

3:44:32.140 --> 3:44:33.140
 He goes, I'm going to get the green one.

3:44:33.140 --> 3:44:34.140
 I go, oh, this one right here.

3:44:34.140 --> 3:44:35.140
 He goes, no, the one on my head.

3:44:35.140 --> 3:44:36.140
 I go, Nate, that one's brown.

3:44:36.140 --> 3:44:37.140
 He's like, leave me alone, dad.

3:44:37.140 --> 3:44:40.340
 He got the brown hat because to him it looked great.

3:44:40.340 --> 3:44:41.660
 So he couldn't fly.

3:44:41.660 --> 3:44:43.300
 He came to me and said, I go, what do you want to do, Nate?

3:44:43.300 --> 3:44:44.740
 You're talking to your kids and what do you want to do?

3:44:44.740 --> 3:44:45.740
 He goes, I want to be a pilot.

3:44:45.740 --> 3:44:50.020
 Now I got to tell him because he's looking at me because I'm a pilot, you can't be a

3:44:50.020 --> 3:44:51.020
 pilot.

3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:57.140
 I go, why can't I be a pilot, I said, because you got eye issues, so you got to redirect.

3:44:57.140 --> 3:45:02.060
 The other one was because I stopped flying when I was 42 years old and it was my childhood

3:45:02.060 --> 3:45:03.060
 dream.

3:45:03.060 --> 3:45:04.060
 So it's like a pro athlete.

3:45:04.060 --> 3:45:08.620
 I know exactly what it feels like when Brett Favre has to walk away from the NFL when you

3:45:08.620 --> 3:45:09.620
 still can do it.

3:45:09.620 --> 3:45:12.940
 Good choice of quarterback, by the way, the greatest of all time, but whatever.

3:45:12.940 --> 3:45:17.740
 So you do and you look at it and you go, I understand what those guys feel like when

3:45:17.740 --> 3:45:22.740
 you have to walk away from something that you love and you think you can still do it.

3:45:22.740 --> 3:45:27.180
 So I told them, I said, look, I was talking to both of my kids and I said, you know, find

3:45:27.180 --> 3:45:34.100
 something that you want to do, that you love to do and that you can do your whole life.

3:45:34.100 --> 3:45:37.460
 And you should be able to do good things for other people.

3:45:37.460 --> 3:45:39.900
 You want to be able to help other people.

3:45:39.900 --> 3:45:40.900
 That's what I said.

3:45:40.900 --> 3:45:45.500
 So both of my kids and there's no one in my family, both of my children, one of them

3:45:45.500 --> 3:45:49.920
 is, my daughter is a doctor doing a residency in internal medicine right now.

3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:53.840
 And my son is in his third year and they're both going to be doctors.

3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:56.660
 And until I look at it as, you know, people go, oh, you got two doctors.

3:45:56.660 --> 3:45:57.660
 I don't care.

3:45:57.660 --> 3:46:01.420
 I told my kids, if you want to be a garbage man or you want to dig ditches, I don't care.

3:46:01.420 --> 3:46:06.020
 Just be, be the best ditch digger that you can be, I said, and be happy doing it.

3:46:06.020 --> 3:46:09.660
 Because what you also find is that we are in this big pursuit of money, money, money,

3:46:09.660 --> 3:46:10.940
 money, money, money, money.

3:46:10.940 --> 3:46:11.940
 That's what makes the world go round.

3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:16.100
 But what you realize, and I'll go back to my grandfather who didn't have a lot of money

3:46:16.100 --> 3:46:18.340
 and he was probably one of the most happy people on life.

3:46:18.340 --> 3:46:20.140
 And unfortunately he died at, he died at 65.

3:46:20.140 --> 3:46:24.540
 He had a massive heart attack because he didn't tell that he, he kind of knew it was happening

3:46:24.540 --> 3:46:30.140
 and he just made the choice to do it and it was devastating to the entire family.

3:46:30.140 --> 3:46:32.280
 But he didn't, he didn't have a lot of money.

3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:35.020
 But I'll tell you what, I know a lot of rich people who have funerals and there's nobody

3:46:35.020 --> 3:46:36.020
 at them.

3:46:36.020 --> 3:46:37.020
 Yeah.

3:46:37.020 --> 3:46:41.480
 And my grandfather, who's a beer delivery guy had, I, I, it literally, it was like three

3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:42.480
 miles long.

3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:43.480
 The Pope.

3:46:43.480 --> 3:46:44.480
 It was crazy.

3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:45.480
 Yeah.

3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:46.480
 Who died?

3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:47.480
 The Pope.

3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:48.480
 That was because there was like, Hey, he's a Catholic.

3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:49.480
 He's just, you know, Italian.

3:46:49.480 --> 3:46:50.480
 He goes, you know, who died?

3:46:50.480 --> 3:46:51.480
 The Pope.

3:46:51.480 --> 3:46:52.480
 And I go, no, that was my grandfather.

3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:53.480
 And then the next funeral I went to was my aunt, his sister.

3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:54.540
 And it was like, you know, 30 people.

3:46:54.540 --> 3:46:57.380
 And I looked at my mother and I said, where's everybody at?

3:46:57.380 --> 3:47:00.480
 She goes, Oh, no, this is normal.

3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:02.700
 This is what a normal funeral looks like.

3:47:02.700 --> 3:47:08.060
 So it's, you know, for young kids, bottom line, one, be nice.

3:47:08.060 --> 3:47:09.060
 Kindness will get you.

3:47:09.060 --> 3:47:10.700
 I'm a big believer in karma.

3:47:10.700 --> 3:47:13.000
 Kindness will get you a long way in the world.

3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:14.000
 You know, it's easy.

3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:15.720
 It's, it's, it's easy to be nice.

3:47:15.720 --> 3:47:17.580
 It doesn't cost you anything.

3:47:17.580 --> 3:47:19.860
 I said, you know, and get rid of the hate.

3:47:19.860 --> 3:47:23.700
 And number two is follow your dreams because everyone is capable of everything.

3:47:23.700 --> 3:47:27.460
 And there's a, there's a self realism, like, you know, if you really have trouble with

3:47:27.460 --> 3:47:32.200
 math, getting a PhD in applied math is probably not something you're going to be able to do,

3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:35.340
 but understand yourself, what your own capabilities are.

3:47:35.340 --> 3:47:38.220
 And you know, inside your heart, don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't

3:47:38.220 --> 3:47:39.220
 do.

3:47:39.220 --> 3:47:43.860
 Just look at yourself and go for it and, and, and you can do anything.

3:47:43.860 --> 3:47:47.220
 It's just, it's, it's a great, the world's incredible.

3:47:47.220 --> 3:47:48.220
 It really is.

3:47:48.220 --> 3:47:52.540
 Let me ask the last big, ridiculous question.

3:47:52.540 --> 3:47:59.420
 So you've lived much of your life, your career is kind of at the edge of life and death.

3:47:59.420 --> 3:48:06.180
 So let me ask kind of several different ways, the same kind of question.

3:48:06.180 --> 3:48:12.860
 One, do you, have you pondered your mortality, the finiteness of it?

3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:20.540
 And the bigger question to ask, even in the context of your, uh, tic tac encounter is,

3:48:20.540 --> 3:48:25.700
 uh, what do you think is the meaning of this, uh, thing we got going on here?

3:48:25.700 --> 3:48:31.020
 The meaning of life, human life in this sense.

3:48:31.020 --> 3:48:33.940
 So let me start with, have I pondered my own mortality?

3:48:33.940 --> 3:48:34.940
 Yes.

3:48:34.940 --> 3:48:36.900
 Very often.

3:48:36.900 --> 3:48:40.960
 And I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell you that I do

3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:42.560
 believe in God.

3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:46.660
 I've just seen too many things in the world that I can't explain.

3:48:46.660 --> 3:48:49.820
 And some people will explain it by subconscious, so I'll give you a story and this kind of

3:48:49.820 --> 3:48:52.860
 puts in the thing of, do I fear death?

3:48:52.860 --> 3:48:55.960
 So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with, we were stationed in Japan together

3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:01.380
 and Japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins, so there's a real high cancer

3:49:01.380 --> 3:49:07.740
 rate for those that served on the base in Atsugi, Japan.

3:49:07.740 --> 3:49:12.820
 Him and his wife had one son, um, and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday

3:49:12.820 --> 3:49:14.820
 of cancer.

3:49:14.820 --> 3:49:19.900
 And I was hanging out with, I'll call him John, and I was hanging out with John, we

3:49:19.900 --> 3:49:24.300
 were in oil and gas, he had come to the same company and we were doing an event together

3:49:24.300 --> 3:49:27.140
 and he was opening up to me because we were actually the demo pilots.

3:49:27.140 --> 3:49:32.460
 We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff and him and I were sitting there talking

3:49:32.460 --> 3:49:39.620
 and he was giving me the whole story and how it really changed his look on life that we're

3:49:39.620 --> 3:49:42.700
 only here for a finite time and that we're all going to die.

3:49:42.700 --> 3:49:46.300
 Well, unfortunately, after all that, when it was really going, him and his wife had

3:49:46.300 --> 3:49:50.880
 moved to a location that would fit their, you know, close to the water where they could

3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:56.500
 do stuff and I won't say where, and he was doing what he loved to do and he got diagnosed

3:49:56.500 --> 3:50:00.540
 with throat cancer.

3:50:00.540 --> 3:50:08.460
 And I was talking to him, uh, it was probably about maybe two months before he died, um,

3:50:08.460 --> 3:50:13.980
 and I said, dude, hey, you're sad, I mean, this is your friend and I'm kind of really

3:50:13.980 --> 3:50:18.580
 bummed out and this is the guy, this is a guy that's dying of cancer and here's what

3:50:18.580 --> 3:50:19.580
 he tells me.

3:50:19.580 --> 3:50:23.500
 He says, Dave, dude, we're all going to die.

3:50:23.500 --> 3:50:28.540
 He goes, but I have to look at it, I have to make the best of the time that I have.

3:50:28.540 --> 3:50:30.460
 And I said, I understand that.

3:50:30.460 --> 3:50:37.860
 And he goes, with the exception of not being with my wife, who he loved dearly, he goes,

3:50:37.860 --> 3:50:39.420
 I'm okay with dying.

3:50:39.420 --> 3:50:47.980
 I've had a really good life and, um, about, uh, cause actually the original announcement

3:50:47.980 --> 3:50:51.180
 when he, when he finally passed away, a buddy of mine called me cause I don't do Facebook

3:50:51.180 --> 3:50:57.560
 and his wife had put it on Facebook that he had passed and about the day before he died,

3:50:57.560 --> 3:51:03.900
 for some reason I was thinking about him and I had a dream or I think it was a dream or

3:51:03.900 --> 3:51:04.900
 an altered reality.

3:51:04.900 --> 3:51:11.700
 You can get into whatever, uh, but he was there, it was just him and I, and I was really

3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:13.420
 sad in the dream.

3:51:13.420 --> 3:51:16.220
 I was actually crying and he was there and he was actually in his uniform.

3:51:16.220 --> 3:51:20.700
 He was in his whites and uh, cause he was a Navy and we were just talking and he looked

3:51:20.700 --> 3:51:22.700
 at me and he said, and this isn't my dream.

3:51:22.700 --> 3:51:25.740
 He's like, Dave, it's all going to be okay.

3:51:25.740 --> 3:51:28.700
 And this is, this is like, and this is a vivid conversation I have.

3:51:28.700 --> 3:51:32.660
 There's people are gonna think I'm weird about this, but, um, but I, you know, I know what

3:51:32.660 --> 3:51:37.620
 my dream was and you know, maybe it's my subconscious creating the dream, but in reality to me,

3:51:37.620 --> 3:51:40.780
 this was real, that it was put there for a reason.

3:51:40.780 --> 3:51:43.700
 He's and he basically explained everything he's, it's okay.

3:51:43.700 --> 3:51:45.220
 I'm going to be fine.

3:51:45.220 --> 3:51:46.220
 My wife is fine.

3:51:46.220 --> 3:51:50.320
 He goes, this is, this is what's meant to be, you know, but you know, and the bottom

3:51:50.320 --> 3:51:54.700
 line was make use of every day that you have because you don't know.

3:51:54.700 --> 3:51:57.820
 And literally two days later, I find out that he passed.

3:51:57.820 --> 3:52:04.140
 Um, so, but ultimately he accepted the finiteness of it.

3:52:04.140 --> 3:52:05.140
 He did.

3:52:05.140 --> 3:52:08.620
 Well, you have to, and it's like, I talk about, you know, money and job position and this

3:52:08.620 --> 3:52:11.660
 and that, and I said, you can get in any, you know, you can go to a company.

3:52:11.660 --> 3:52:15.060
 Just remember when you want to be a VP of a company, you sell your soul to the company.

3:52:15.060 --> 3:52:20.060
 You have to, I said, if you look, I joke with people at work and I said, I said, you know,

3:52:20.060 --> 3:52:22.660
 when you ever think that you're important or this guy has that, I said, when you're

3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:27.420
 sitting on 93 or 95, one 28 and you're sitting in traffic and we're stopped, which doesn't

3:52:27.420 --> 3:52:29.660
 happen right now because of COVID, but normally it's stopped.

3:52:29.660 --> 3:52:33.660
 It's bumper to bumper and you're sitting here like I was coming down here by the gas tank.

3:52:33.660 --> 3:52:38.800
 Um, when you're sitting there, look left and look right, you know, and there can be a Lamborghini

3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:40.760
 or an S five 50 Mercedes.

3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:44.760
 And on the other side, there could be some piece of crap car.

3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:48.840
 We're all sitting on the same freeway at the same time, trying to do the same thing, which

3:52:48.840 --> 3:52:54.380
 is just get home so we can be with our family because the most important thing that we have,

3:52:54.380 --> 3:52:55.380
 it ain't money.

3:52:55.380 --> 3:52:56.480
 It ain't our job.

3:52:56.480 --> 3:52:57.480
 It's not our position.

3:52:57.480 --> 3:53:02.620
 I go, cause when it's all said and done, you could be, you know, you can be with the exception

3:53:02.620 --> 3:53:04.300
 of the presidents of the United States.

3:53:04.300 --> 3:53:07.260
 I mean, name the vice presidents.

3:53:07.260 --> 3:53:11.400
 Most people can't and eventually they're going to die or eventually you're going to see a

3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:15.180
 statue of a guy from the 17 hundreds in the Boston area and you're going to go, I don't

3:53:15.180 --> 3:53:17.140
 even know who that guy was.

3:53:17.140 --> 3:53:18.180
 Did he impact my life?

3:53:18.180 --> 3:53:23.520
 He probably did, but eventually people forget you realize what's important now and the one

3:53:23.520 --> 3:53:29.580
 thing that you have is your family and your close friends and that's, that's it.

3:53:29.580 --> 3:53:31.360
 You can take all the money or everything else.

3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:34.740
 If you're down on your luck, you know, who is going to be, we, I just joke, who are your

3:53:34.740 --> 3:53:36.220
 true friends?

3:53:36.220 --> 3:53:37.220
 It's the person.

3:53:37.220 --> 3:53:39.900
 Well, there's, there's a once that I won't say, but you know, Hey, you're broke down

3:53:39.900 --> 3:53:43.380
 on a road in the middle of nowhere and it's three oclock in the morning, who you going

3:53:43.380 --> 3:53:47.000
 to call is going to get in their car without complaining and come and get you.

3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:48.040
 And that's life.

3:53:48.040 --> 3:53:49.040
 That is life.

3:53:49.040 --> 3:53:50.900
 The people you love.

3:53:50.900 --> 3:53:53.420
 It's it's, it's the people you truly care about.

3:53:53.420 --> 3:53:57.980
 And contrary to, I have, you know, Oh my God, I got 6,000 Facebook friends.

3:53:57.980 --> 3:54:02.060
 You got about that many real friends that you can count on and that's it.

3:54:02.060 --> 3:54:03.060
 Everything else doesn't matter.

3:54:03.060 --> 3:54:04.060
 Oh, it doesn't matter.

3:54:04.060 --> 3:54:05.060
 It doesn't mean you don't be nice.

3:54:05.060 --> 3:54:08.040
 I mean, I have, there's acquaintance friends that I'll do anything for and they can come

3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:12.180
 to my house and stuff, but then there's the people that, you know, you know, like my cousins

3:54:12.180 --> 3:54:19.000
 who are like my brothers that, you know, at a moment's notice, you know, when, when my

3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:23.200
 uncle passed away at a young age, you know, who lived literally right down the street

3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:28.580
 from me and my cousin Chad and I got two boys, there's 14 of us, but there's only two boys.

3:54:28.580 --> 3:54:32.140
 There's three of us together and we all grew up in the same neighborhood, same schools,

3:54:32.140 --> 3:54:33.940
 play football together, all that.

3:54:33.940 --> 3:54:38.080
 I said, if one of those, if rare Chad ever needs me, if something happens like when my

3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:41.580
 uncle died, it wasn't a, it wasn't an issue if I'm coming home.

3:54:41.580 --> 3:54:44.580
 Because I'm booking the ticket and I don't give a shit what it costs because I will be

3:54:44.580 --> 3:54:47.660
 there to be there with you.

3:54:47.660 --> 3:54:54.420
 And then those two guys and my college roommate is another one that I'm very, very close with,

3:54:54.420 --> 3:54:59.460
 you know, you know, if there's, there's, I have a handful of people that, you know, I

3:54:59.460 --> 3:55:01.340
 will drop literally everything.

3:55:01.340 --> 3:55:05.980
 Even if my wife would be pissed at me at times, she's like, seriously, I got to do it.

3:55:05.980 --> 3:55:08.380
 And now she knows, and it's the same thing with her.

3:55:08.380 --> 3:55:12.140
 I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life that if they really need her and

3:55:12.140 --> 3:55:16.540
 she has to go, she would go and I would let her go.

3:55:16.540 --> 3:55:24.220
 So given all that, I'm honored that you would come here and talk to me and take the time.

3:55:24.220 --> 3:55:26.580
 Dave was one of the best conversations I've ever had.

3:55:26.580 --> 3:55:27.580
 Thank you so much.

3:55:27.580 --> 3:55:28.580
 It's a pretty long one.

3:55:28.580 --> 3:55:31.420
 It's probably sets the record for the longest one.

3:55:31.420 --> 3:55:35.660
 So I, I mean, I'm, I'm a loss of words.

3:55:35.660 --> 3:55:36.660
 One of my favorite conversations.

3:55:36.660 --> 3:55:38.660
 Thank you so much for talking to me, Dave.

3:55:38.660 --> 3:55:40.220
 You're welcome.

3:55:40.220 --> 3:55:42.820
