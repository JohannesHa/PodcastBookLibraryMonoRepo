00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
 The following is a conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett,

00:03.600 --> 00:05.720
 her second time on the podcast.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.040
 She's a neuroscientist at Northeastern University

00:09.040 --> 00:11.240
 and one of my favorite people.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.400
 Her new book called Seven and a Half Lessons

00:13.400 --> 00:16.720
 about the Brain is out now as of a couple of days ago,

00:16.720 --> 00:19.520
 so you should definitely support Lisa by buying it

00:19.520 --> 00:21.760
 and sharing with friends if you like it.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.440
 It's a great short intro to the human brain.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.000
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.840
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.040
 Athletic Greens, the all in one drink

00:32.040 --> 00:33.920
 that I start every day with

00:33.920 --> 00:36.480
 to cover all my nutritional bases.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.440
 Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself

00:39.440 --> 00:42.320
 and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.080
 Masterclass, online courses that I enjoy

00:45.080 --> 00:48.600
 from some of the most amazing people in history.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.640
 And BetterHelp, online therapy with a licensed professional.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.000

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000

00:58.000 --> 01:00.160
 As a side note, let me say that Lisa,

01:00.160 --> 01:02.360
 just like Manolis Calles,

01:02.360 --> 01:05.240
 is a local brilliant mind and friend

01:05.240 --> 01:08.120
 and someone I can see talking to many more times.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.720
 Sometimes it's fun to talk to a scientist

01:10.720 --> 01:12.600
 not just about their field of expertise,

01:12.600 --> 01:15.840
 but also about random topics, even silly ones,

01:15.840 --> 01:19.160
 from love to music to philosophy.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.480
 Ultimately, it's about having fun,

01:21.480 --> 01:23.760
 something I know nothing about.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.800
 This conversation is certainly that.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.760
 It may not always work, but it's worth a shot.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.040
 I think it's valuable to alternate

01:31.040 --> 01:32.960
 along all kinds of dimensions,

01:32.960 --> 01:35.720
 like between deeper technical discussions

01:35.720 --> 01:37.880
 and more fun random discussion,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.720
 from liberal thinker to conservative thinker,

01:40.720 --> 01:45.720
 from musician to athlete, from CEO to junior engineer,

01:45.880 --> 01:48.000
 from friend to stranger.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.480
 Variety makes life and conversation more interesting.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.800
 Let's see where this little podcast journey goes.

02:05.240 --> 02:10.000
 And now, here's my conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.800
 Based on the comments in our previous conversation,

02:13.800 --> 02:17.040
 I think a lot of people will be very disappointed,

02:17.040 --> 02:20.920
 I should say, to learn that you are in fact married.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.960
 As they say, all the good ones are taken.

02:22.960 --> 02:27.960
 Okay, so I'm a fan of your husband as well, Dan.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.760
 He's a programmer and musician,

02:29.760 --> 02:32.080
 so a man after my own heart.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.160
 Can I ask a ridiculously over romanticized question

02:36.160 --> 02:40.960
 of when did you first fall in love with Dan?

02:40.960 --> 02:45.360
 It's actually, it's a really romantic story, I think.

02:45.360 --> 02:53.040
 So I was divorced by the time I was 26, 27, 26, I guess.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.960
 And I was in my first academic job,

02:54.960 --> 02:57.240
 which was Penn State University,

02:57.240 --> 02:59.840
 which is in the middle of Pennsylvania,

02:59.840 --> 03:01.040
 surrounded by mountains.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.200
 So you have, it's four hours to get anywhere,

03:03.200 --> 03:05.920
 to get to Philadelphia, New York, Washington.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.960
 I mean, you're basically stuck, you know.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.640
 And I was very fortunate to have

03:12.640 --> 03:14.480
 a lot of other assistant professors

03:14.480 --> 03:16.440
 who were hired at the same time as I was.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.560
 So there were a lot of us,

03:17.560 --> 03:20.440
 we were all friends, which was really fun.

03:20.440 --> 03:24.320
 But I was single and I didn't wanna date a student.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.560
 And there were no,

03:27.560 --> 03:29.760
 and I wasn't gonna date somebody in my department,

03:29.760 --> 03:32.160
 that's just a recipe for disaster.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.400
 So even at 20, whatever you were,

03:35.400 --> 03:37.160
 you were already wise enough to know that.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.440
 Yeah, a little bit, maybe, yeah.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.200
 I wouldn't call me wise at that age.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.080
 But anyways, not sure that I would say that I'm wise now,

03:44.080 --> 03:44.920
 but.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.080
 And so after,

03:50.080 --> 03:53.720
 I was spending probably 16 hours a day in the lab

03:53.720 --> 03:57.240
 because it was my first year as an assistant professor

03:57.240 --> 03:58.800
 and there's a lot to do.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.640
 And I was also bitching and moaning to my friends

04:02.640 --> 04:06.320
 that I hadn't had sex in I don't know how many months

04:06.320 --> 04:10.520
 and I was starting to become unhappy with my life.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.040
 And I think at a certain point,

04:13.040 --> 04:15.560
 they just got tired of listening to me bitch and moan

04:15.560 --> 04:18.320
 and said, just do something about it then,

04:18.320 --> 04:20.360
 like if you're unhappy.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.720
 And so the first thing I did was I made friends

04:23.720 --> 04:25.720
 with a sushi chef in town.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.840
 And this is like a State College, Pennsylvania

04:28.840 --> 04:32.160
 in the early 90s was there was like a pizza shop

04:32.160 --> 04:36.240
 and a sub shop and actually a very good bagel shop

04:36.240 --> 04:39.120
 and one good coffee shop and maybe one nice restaurant.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.160
 I mean, there was really,

04:40.160 --> 04:44.440
 but there was the second son of a Japanese sushi chef

04:44.440 --> 04:47.200
 who was not going to inherit the restaurant.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.200
 And so he moved to Pennsylvania and was giving sushi lessons.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.240
 So I met this guy, the sushi chef

04:54.240 --> 04:57.400
 and we decided to throw a sushi party at the coffee shop.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.680
 So we basically, it was the goal was to invite

04:59.680 --> 05:04.680
 every eligible bachelor really within like a 20 mile radius.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
 We had a totally fun time.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.040
 I wore an awesome crushed velvet burgundy dress,

05:11.040 --> 05:12.540
 it was beautiful dress.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.560
 And I didn't meet any, I met a lot of new friends,

05:16.560 --> 05:17.760
 but I did not meet anybody.

05:17.760 --> 05:18.720
 So then I thought, okay, well,

05:18.720 --> 05:20.960
 maybe I'll try the Personals ads,

05:20.960 --> 05:23.400
 which I had never used before in my life.

05:23.400 --> 05:28.400
 And I first tried the paper Personals ads.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.000
 Like in the newspaper?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
 Like in the newspaper, that didn't work.

05:33.000 --> 05:33.960
 And then a friend of mine said,

05:33.960 --> 05:36.600
 oh, you know, there's this thing called Net News.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.160
 So we're going, this is like 1992 maybe.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.840
 So there was this anonymous, you could do it anonymously.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.840
 So you would read, you could post or you could read ads

05:49.960 --> 05:54.920
 and then respond to an address which was anonymous

05:54.920 --> 05:57.560
 and that was yoked to somebody's real address.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.040
 And there was always a lag

06:01.040 --> 06:04.880
 because it was this like a bulletin board sort of thing.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.920
 So at first I read them over

06:08.920 --> 06:12.680
 and I decided to respond to one or two.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.240
 And, you know, it was interesting.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.960
 Sorry, this is not on the internet.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.320
 Yeah, this is totally on the internet.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.160
 But it takes, there's a delay of a couple of days

06:20.160 --> 06:21.000
 or whatever.

06:21.000 --> 06:21.820
 Yeah, right, right.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.160
 It's 1992, there's no web, web pictures.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.120
 There's no pictures, the web doesn't exist.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.600
 It's all done in ASCII format sort of.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.280
 And, you know, but the ratio,

06:33.280 --> 06:38.280
 but the ratio of men to women was like 10 to one.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.840
 I mean, there were many more men

06:39.840 --> 06:42.920
 because it was basically academics and the government.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.400
 That was it.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.020
 I mean, I think AOL maybe was just starting

06:47.020 --> 06:48.220
 to become popular, but.

06:51.240 --> 06:56.240
 And so the first person I met told me that he was a scientist

06:56.240 --> 07:01.240
 who worked for NASA and, yeah.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.040
 Anyways, it turned out that he didn't actually.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.200
 Yeah, this is how they brag is like you elevate your,

07:11.200 --> 07:12.840
 as opposed to saying you're taller than you are,

07:12.840 --> 07:14.080
 you say like your position is higher.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.720
 Yeah, and I actually, I would have been fine

07:16.720 --> 07:18.360
 dating somebody who wasn't a scientist.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.820
 It's just that they have, it's just that whoever I date

07:21.820 --> 07:26.820
 has to just accept that I am and that I was pretty ambitious

07:28.240 --> 07:30.320
 and was trying to make my career.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.440
 And, you know, that's not, I think it's maybe more common

07:34.440 --> 07:38.500
 now for men to maybe accept that in their female partners,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.520
 but at that time, not so common.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.880
 It could be intimidating, I guess.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.120
 Yes, that has been said.

07:44.120 --> 07:49.120
 And so then the next one I actually corresponded with,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.620
 and we actually got to the point of talking on the phone,

07:51.620 --> 07:53.880
 and we had this really kind of funny conversation

07:53.880 --> 07:57.520
 where, you know, we're chatting and he said,

07:57.520 --> 08:00.080
 he introduces the idea that, you know,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.380
 he's really looking for a dominant woman.

08:02.380 --> 08:05.240
 And I'm thinking, I'm a psychologist by training,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.080
 so I'm thinking, oh, he means sex roles.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.960
 Like, I'm like, no, I'm very assertive

08:08.960 --> 08:10.320
 and I'm glad you think that, you know, okay.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.940
 Anyways, long story short, that's not really what he meant.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.200
 Okay, got it.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.380
 Yeah, so, and I just, you know,

08:20.380 --> 08:22.320
 that will just show you my level of naivete.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.560
 Like, I was like, I didn't completely understand,

08:24.560 --> 08:27.480
 but I was like, well, yeah, you know, no.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.240
 At one point he asked me how I felt

08:29.240 --> 08:33.520
 about him wearing my lingerie, and I was like,

08:33.520 --> 08:35.680
 I don't even share my lingerie with my sister.

08:35.680 --> 08:39.600
 Like, I don't share my lingerie with anybody, you know?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.800
 No.

08:40.800 --> 08:45.280
 The third one I interacted with was a banker

08:45.280 --> 08:50.280
 who lived in Singapore, and that conversation

08:50.880 --> 08:55.160
 didn't last very long because he made an analogy,

08:55.160 --> 08:57.720
 I guess he made an analogy between me

08:57.720 --> 09:01.640
 and a character in The Fountainhead,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.160
 the woman who's raped in The Fountainhead,

09:06.160 --> 09:08.620
 and I was like, okay, that's not.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.460
 That's not a good.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.440
 That's not a good, no, that's not a good one.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.920
 Not that part, not that scene.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.760
 Not that scene.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.240
 So then I was like, okay, you know what?

09:16.240 --> 09:18.440
 I'm gonna post my own ad, and so I did.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.080
 I posted, well, first I wrote my ad,

09:20.080 --> 09:22.600
 and then I, of course, I checked it with my friends

09:22.600 --> 09:24.700
 who were all also assistant professors.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.440
 They were like my little Greek chorus,

09:26.440 --> 09:30.180
 and then I posted it, and I got something like,

09:30.180 --> 09:34.280
 I don't know, 80 something responses in 24 hours.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.120
 I mean, it was very.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.440
 Do you remember the pitch?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.920
 Like how you, I guess, condensed yourself?

09:40.920 --> 09:43.880
 I don't remember it exactly, although Dan has it,

09:44.840 --> 09:48.080
 but actually for our 20th wedding anniversary,

09:48.080 --> 09:51.640
 he took our exchanges, and he printed them off

09:51.640 --> 09:54.640
 and put them in a leather bound book for us to read,

09:54.640 --> 09:55.880
 which was really sweet.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.680
 Yeah, I think I was just really direct.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.160
 Like I'm almost 30.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.220
 I'm a scientist.

10:01.220 --> 10:04.960
 I'm not looking, I'm looking for something serious.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.960
 But the thing is, I forgot to say where my location was

10:08.960 --> 10:12.000
 and my age, which I forgot.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.680
 So I got lots of, I mean, I will say,

10:14.680 --> 10:17.880
 so I printed off all of the responses,

10:17.880 --> 10:22.280
 and I had all my friends over, and we had a big,

10:22.280 --> 10:24.480
 I made a big pot of gumbo,

10:24.480 --> 10:27.280
 and we drank through several bottles of wine

10:27.280 --> 10:28.640
 reading these responses.

10:28.640 --> 10:32.460
 And I would say for the most part, they were really sweet,

10:32.460 --> 10:36.400
 like earnest and genuine as much as you could tell

10:36.400 --> 10:37.320
 that somebody is being genuine.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.320
 I mean, it seemed, there were a couple of really funky ones,

10:40.320 --> 10:42.440
 like this one couple who told me

10:42.440 --> 10:44.480
 that I was their soulmate, the two of them,

10:44.480 --> 10:47.160
 when they were looking for a third person,

10:47.160 --> 10:48.760
 and I was like, oh, okay.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.760
 But mostly super, seemed like super genuine people.

10:53.980 --> 10:57.600
 And so I chose five men to start corresponding with,

10:57.600 --> 10:58.900
 and I was corresponding with them.

10:58.900 --> 11:03.160
 And then about a week later, I get this other email.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.020
 And okay, and then I post something the next day

11:05.020 --> 11:06.760
 that said, okay, thank you so much,

11:06.760 --> 11:10.320
 and I'm gonna, I answered every person back.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.620
 But then after that, I said, okay,

11:11.620 --> 11:13.600
 and I'm not gonna answer anymore,

11:13.600 --> 11:15.080
 because they were still coming in,

11:15.080 --> 11:16.760
 and I couldn't, I have a job,

11:16.760 --> 11:18.720
 and a house to take care of and stuff.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.680
 So, and then about a week later, I get this other email.

11:22.680 --> 11:27.440
 And he says, he just describes himself,

11:27.440 --> 11:30.200
 like I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm a chef,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.520
 I'm a scientist, I'm a this, I'm a this.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.760
 And so I emailed him back, and I said, you know,

11:36.760 --> 11:38.400
 you seem interesting, you can write me

11:38.400 --> 11:40.840
 at my actual address if you want, here's my address.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.120
 I'm not really responding,

11:42.120 --> 11:43.700
 I'm not really responding to other people anymore,

11:43.700 --> 11:45.040
 but you seem interesting, you know,

11:45.040 --> 11:46.800
 you can write to me if you want.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.800
 And then he wrote to me, and I wrote him back,

11:52.560 --> 11:54.900
 and it was a nondescript kind of email,

11:54.900 --> 11:56.860
 and I wrote him back, and I said, thanks for responding.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.840
 You know, I'm really busy right now.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.720
 I was in the middle of writing

11:59.720 --> 12:02.600
 my first slate of grant applications,

12:02.600 --> 12:04.920
 so I was really consumed, and I said,

12:04.920 --> 12:06.880
 I'll get back to you in a couple of days.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.240
 And so I did, I waited a couple days

12:09.240 --> 12:11.280
 till my grants were, you know, safe,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.440
 grant applications safely out the door.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.960
 And then I emailed him back, and then he emailed me,

12:16.960 --> 12:21.520
 and then really across two days, we sent 100 emails.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.280
 And text only, was there pictures or any of that stuff?

12:25.280 --> 12:27.560
 Text only, text only.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.800
 And then, so this was like a Thursday and a Friday,

12:30.800 --> 12:33.860
 and then Friday, he said,

12:33.860 --> 12:35.660
 let's talk on the weekend on the phone.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.080
 And I said, okay.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.840
 And he wanted to talk Sunday night,

12:39.840 --> 12:42.500
 and I had a date Sunday night.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.760
 So I said, okay, sure, we can talk Sunday night.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.440
 And then I was like, well, you know,

12:49.440 --> 12:50.720
 I don't really wanna cancel my date,

12:50.720 --> 12:52.440
 so I'm just gonna call him on Saturday.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.480
 So I just called, I cold called him on Saturday,

12:55.480 --> 12:57.280
 and a woman answered.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.120
 Oh, wow.

12:59.120 --> 12:59.960
 That's not cool.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.640
 Not cool.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.520
 And so she says, you know, hello.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.880
 And I say, oh, you know, stand there.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.760
 And she said, sure, can I ask who's calling?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.720
 And I said, tell him it's Lisa.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.480
 And she went, oh my God, oh my God, I'm just a friend.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.360
 I'm just a friend.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.760
 I just need to tell you, I'm just a friend.

13:17.760 --> 13:21.280
 And I was like, this is adorable, right?

13:21.280 --> 13:23.120
 She doesn't, and then he gets on the phone,

13:23.120 --> 13:24.480
 not hi, nice to meet you.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.400
 The first thing he says to me, she's just a friend.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.400
 So I was just so charmed really by the whole thing.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.560
 So it was Yom Kippur.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.160
 It was the Jewish day of atonement that was ending

13:38.160 --> 13:40.240
 and they were baking cookies and going to a break fast.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.460
 So people, you know, as you know, fast all day,

13:42.460 --> 13:44.840
 and then they go to a party and they break fast.

13:44.840 --> 13:49.840
 So I thought, okay, I'll just cancel my date.

13:49.840 --> 13:54.840
 So I did, and I stayed home and we talked for eight hours.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.320
 And then the next night for six hours.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.160
 And basically it just went on like that.

14:00.160 --> 14:05.160
 And then by the end of the week, he flew to stay college.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.680
 And, you know, we'd gone through this whole thing

14:08.680 --> 14:10.640
 where I'd said, we're gonna take it slow.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.960
 We're gonna get to know each other, you know.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.080
 And then really by, I think we talked like two or three times

14:16.080 --> 14:18.120
 these like really long conversations.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.280
 And then he said, I'm just gonna fly there.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.720
 And then, so of course there's,

14:23.720 --> 14:26.560
 I don't even know that there were fax machines

14:26.560 --> 14:27.400
 at that point.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.120
 Maybe there were, but I don't think so.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.120
 Anyway, so he, we decided we'll exchange pictures.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.800
 And so he, you know, I take my photograph

14:37.800 --> 14:39.040
 and I give it to my secretary.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.400
 And I say to my secretary.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.560
 Fax this.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.000
 I say that, send this priority mail.

14:45.000 --> 14:45.840
 Priority mail, yeah.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.200
 And he goes, okay, I'll send a priority mail.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.440
 And I'm like, it's a priority mail.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.400
 He's like, I know, priority mail, okay.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.840
 And then, so I get Dan's photograph in the mail.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.640
 And, you know, it's him in shorts.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.760
 And you can see that he's probably somewhere

15:01.760 --> 15:03.480
 like the Bahamas or something like that.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.040
 And it's like cropped.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.440
 So clearly what he's done is he's taken a photograph

15:07.440 --> 15:10.280
 where, you know, he's in it with someone else

15:10.280 --> 15:11.920
 who turned out to be his ex wife.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.080
 So I'm thinking, well, this is awesome.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.480
 You know, I've hit the jackpot.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.640
 He's, you know, very appealing to me, very attractive.

15:18.640 --> 15:23.080
 And then, you know, my photograph doesn't show up

15:23.080 --> 15:24.360
 and it doesn't show up.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.360
 And, you know, so like one day and then two days

15:27.360 --> 15:30.720
 and then, you know, he's like, you know, I said,

15:30.720 --> 15:34.160
 well, I asked my secretary to send a priority.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.240
 I mean, I don't know, you know, what he did.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.960
 And he's like, I said, I'm like, well, you don't have to,

15:40.960 --> 15:41.880
 you know, you don't have to come.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.600
 And he's like, no, no, no, I'm gonna, you know,

15:43.600 --> 15:45.400
 we've had like five dates,

15:45.400 --> 15:47.520
 the equivalent of five dates practically.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.360
 And then, so he's supposed to fly on a Thursday or Friday,

15:52.360 --> 15:53.560
 I can't remember.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.360
 And I get a call like maybe an hour

15:56.360 --> 15:58.120
 before his flight's supposed to leave.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.000
 And he says, hi.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.960
 And I say, and it's just something in his voice, right?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.000
 And I say, cause at this point I think I've talked to him

16:03.000 --> 16:05.400
 like for 25 hours, I don't know.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.280
 And he says, hi.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
 And I'm like, you got the picture.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.480
 And he's like, yeah.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.640
 And I'm like, you don't like it.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.800
 And he's like, well,

16:17.120 --> 16:20.040
 I'm sure it's not, I'm sure it's your,

16:20.040 --> 16:21.840
 I'm sure it's just not a good, you know,

16:21.840 --> 16:24.200
 it's not, it's probably not your best.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
 Oh no.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.040
 You know, you don't, you don't have to come.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.360
 And he's like, no, no, no, I'm coming.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.640
 And I'm like, no, you don't have to come.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.200
 And he's like, no, no, I really wanna,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.840
 I'm, you know, I'm getting on the plane.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
 I'm like, you don't have to get on the plane.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.240
 He's like, no, I'm getting on the plane.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.640
 And so I go down to my, I go,

16:40.640 --> 16:42.040
 I'm in my office, this is happening, right?

16:42.040 --> 16:44.640
 So I go downstairs to one of my closest friends

16:44.640 --> 16:46.960
 who is still actually one of my closest friends,

16:48.600 --> 16:51.240
 who is one of my colleagues and Kevin.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.160
 And I say, Kevin, and I go to Kevin,

16:53.160 --> 16:55.760
 I go, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, he doesn't like the photograph.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.480
 And Kevin's like, well, which photograph should you send?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.880
 And I'm like, well, you know the one

16:58.880 --> 16:59.880
 where we're shooting pool?

16:59.880 --> 17:03.920
 And he's like, you sent that photograph?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.040
 That's a horrible photograph.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.360
 I'm like, yeah, but it's the only one that I had

17:07.360 --> 17:09.600
 that was like, where my hair was kind of similar

17:09.600 --> 17:12.000
 to what it is now, and he's like, Lisa,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.840
 like, do I have to check everything for you?

17:15.840 --> 17:18.440
 You should not have sent that, you know?

17:18.440 --> 17:20.280
 But still, he flew over.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.560
 So he flew. Where from, by the way?

17:22.560 --> 17:25.880
 He was in graduate school at Amherst,

17:25.880 --> 17:27.920
 yeah, at UMass Amherst.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.920
 So he flew and I picked him up at the airport

17:32.920 --> 17:38.880
 and he was happy, so whatever the concern was, was gone.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.080
 And I was dressed, you know, I carefully, carefully dressed.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.120
 Were you nervous?

17:44.120 --> 17:46.280
 I was really, really nervous.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.920
 Because I don't really believe in fate

17:49.920 --> 17:52.360
 and I don't really think there's only one person

17:52.360 --> 17:54.040
 that you can be with.

17:54.040 --> 17:59.040
 But I think some people are curvy,

17:59.040 --> 18:02.880
 you know, people who, some people are curvy,

18:02.880 --> 18:04.280
 they're kind of complicated,

18:04.280 --> 18:06.360
 and so the number of people who fit them

18:06.360 --> 18:08.040
 is maybe less than.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.800
 I like it, mathematically speaking, yeah.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.120
 And so when I was going to pick him up at the airport,

18:13.120 --> 18:15.720
 I was thinking, well, this could,

18:15.720 --> 18:19.080
 I could be going to pick up the person I'm gonna marry.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.480
 Or not.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.680
 I mean, like, I really, but I really, you know,

18:24.680 --> 18:27.800
 like, our conversations were just very authentic

18:27.800 --> 18:32.800
 and very moving and we really connected.

18:33.240 --> 18:37.680
 And I really felt like he understood me, actually,

18:38.960 --> 18:41.640
 in a way that a lot of people don't.

18:41.640 --> 18:46.640
 And what was really nice was, at the time,

18:49.240 --> 18:53.160
 you know, the airport was this tiny little airport

18:53.160 --> 18:54.720
 out in a cornfield, basically.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.440
 And so driving back to the town,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.160
 we were in the car for 15 minutes,

19:00.160 --> 19:02.400
 completely in the dark, as I was driving.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.440
 And so it was very similar to,

19:04.440 --> 19:07.480
 we had just spent, you know, 20 something hours

19:07.480 --> 19:09.960
 on the telephone, sitting in the dark,

19:09.960 --> 19:11.280
 talking to each other.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.480
 So it was very familiar.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.400
 And we basically spent the whole weekend together

19:16.400 --> 19:19.000
 and he met all my friends and we had a big party.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.840
 And at the end of the weekend,

19:22.840 --> 19:26.800
 I said, okay, you know,

19:26.800 --> 19:30.160
 if we're gonna give this a shot,

19:30.160 --> 19:33.120
 we probably shouldn't see other people.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.640
 So it's a risk, you know?

19:35.640 --> 19:36.920
 Commitment.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.160
 But I just didn't see how it would work

19:40.160 --> 19:42.160
 if we were dating people locally

19:42.160 --> 19:44.120
 and then also seeing each other at a distance.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.080
 Because, you know, I've had long distance relationships

19:46.080 --> 19:50.240
 before and they're hard and they take a lot of effort.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.880
 And so we decided we'd give it three months

19:51.880 --> 19:54.560
 and see what happened and that was it.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.200
 This is an interesting thing.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.800
 Like we're all, what is it?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.440
 There's several billion of us

20:00.440 --> 20:02.320
 and we're kind of roaming this world

20:02.320 --> 20:04.400
 and then you kind of stick together.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.640
 You find somebody that just like gets you.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.960
 And it's interesting to think about,

20:09.960 --> 20:12.760
 there's probably thousands if not millions of people

20:12.760 --> 20:14.920
 that would be sticky to you,

20:14.920 --> 20:17.720
 depending on the curvature of your space.

20:17.720 --> 20:22.720
 But what is the, could you speak to the stickiness?

20:23.400 --> 20:25.920
 Like to the, just the falling in love?

20:25.920 --> 20:29.880
 Like seeing that somebody really gets you?

20:29.880 --> 20:34.880
 Maybe by way of telling, do you think,

20:35.200 --> 20:36.360
 do you remember there was a moment

20:36.360 --> 20:40.520
 when you just realized, damn it, I think I'm,

20:40.520 --> 20:42.760
 like I think this is the guy.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.240
 I think I'm in love.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.560
 We were having these conversations actually

20:46.560 --> 20:49.520
 from the, really from the second weekend we were together.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.560
 So he flew back the next weekend to State College

20:51.560 --> 20:52.400
 because it was my birthday.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.240
 It was my 30th birthday.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.200
 My friends were throwing me a party.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.040
 And we went hiking and we hiked up some mountain

20:58.040 --> 21:01.520
 and we were sitting on a cliff over this overlook

21:01.520 --> 21:02.480
 and talking to each other.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.040
 And I was thinking, and I actually said to him,

21:04.040 --> 21:06.880
 like I haven't really known you very long,

21:06.880 --> 21:08.520
 but I feel like I'm falling in love with you,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.160
 which can't possibly be happening.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.800
 I must be projecting, but it certainly feels that way.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.640
 Like I don't believe in love at first sight.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.880
 So this can't really be happening,

21:18.880 --> 21:20.200
 but it sort of feels like it is.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.720
 And he was like, I know what you mean.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.480
 And so for the first three months or four months,

21:24.480 --> 21:25.440
 we would say things to each other.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.080
 Like, I feel like I'm in love with you,

21:28.080 --> 21:32.640
 but you know, but that can't,

21:32.640 --> 21:34.160
 but things don't really work like that.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.040
 So, but you know, so, and then it became a joke.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.520
 Like I feel like I'm in love with you.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.680
 And then eventually, you know, I think,

21:41.680 --> 21:43.280
 but I think that was one moment

21:43.280 --> 21:47.960
 where we were talking about just,

21:50.200 --> 21:53.880
 you know, not just all the great aspirations you have

21:53.880 --> 21:54.720
 or all the things,

21:54.720 --> 21:56.560
 but also things you don't like about yourself,

21:56.560 --> 21:57.920
 things that you're worried about,

21:57.920 --> 21:59.720
 things that you're scared of.

21:59.720 --> 22:03.200
 And then I think that was sort of solidified

22:03.200 --> 22:04.040
 the relationship.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.400
 And then there was one weekend

22:06.400 --> 22:09.120
 where we went to Maine in the winter,

22:09.120 --> 22:12.720
 which I mean, I really love the beach always,

22:12.720 --> 22:15.680
 but in the winter, particularly.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.520
 Because it's just beautiful and calm and whatever.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.360
 Yeah.

22:19.360 --> 22:24.360
 And I also, I do find beauty in starkness sometimes.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.280
 Like, so there's this grand majestic scene

22:28.280 --> 22:30.360
 of, you know, this very powerful ocean

22:30.360 --> 22:33.040
 and it's all these like beautiful blue grays

22:33.040 --> 22:35.680
 and it's just stunning.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.440
 And so we were sitting on this huge rock in Maine

22:39.440 --> 22:40.800
 and where we'd gone for the weekend,

22:40.800 --> 22:42.440
 it was freezing cold.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.880
 And I honestly can't remember what he said

22:45.880 --> 22:48.560
 or what I said or what,

22:48.560 --> 22:52.880
 but I definitely remember having this feeling of,

22:53.840 --> 22:57.160
 I absolutely wanna stay with this person.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.820
 And I don't know what my life will be like

22:58.820 --> 23:00.120
 if I'm not with this person.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.400
 Like I need to be with this person.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.680
 Can we, from a scientific and a human perspective,

23:05.680 --> 23:09.320
 dig into your belief that first love at first sight

23:09.320 --> 23:11.520
 is not possible?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.160
 You don't believe in it?

23:13.160 --> 23:15.800
 Cause there is, you don't think there's like a magic

23:15.800 --> 23:19.680
 where you see somebody in the Jack Kerouac way

23:19.680 --> 23:22.880
 and you're like, wow, that's something.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.760
 That's a special little glimmer or something.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.680
 Oh, I definitely think you can connect with someone

23:29.680 --> 23:32.120
 instant, in an instance.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.720
 And I definitely think you can say,

23:34.720 --> 23:35.760
 oh, there's something there

23:35.760 --> 23:37.740
 and I'm really clicking with that person.

23:37.740 --> 23:39.600
 Romantically, but also just as friends,

23:39.600 --> 23:40.760
 it's possible to do that.

23:40.760 --> 23:44.120
 You recognize a mind that's like yours

23:44.120 --> 23:47.520
 or that's compatible with yours.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.440
 There are ways that you feel like you're being understood

23:50.440 --> 23:52.720
 or that you understand something about this person

23:52.720 --> 23:54.440
 or maybe you see something in this person

23:54.440 --> 23:58.240
 that you find really compelling or intriguing.

23:58.240 --> 24:03.240
 But I think your brain is predictive organ, right?

24:03.360 --> 24:05.480
 You're using your past.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.600
 You're projecting.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.120
 You're using your past to make predictions

24:10.120 --> 24:12.880
 and I mean, not deliberately.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.360
 That's how your brain is wired.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.280
 That's what it does.

24:15.280 --> 24:20.200
 And so it's filling in all of the gaps that you,

24:21.200 --> 24:23.120
 there are lots of gaps of information

24:23.120 --> 24:26.280
 that you don't, information you don't have.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.780
 And so your brain is filling those in and.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.600
 But isn't that what love is?

24:32.600 --> 24:35.160
 No, I don't think so, actually.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.360
 I mean, to some extent, sure, you always,

24:38.360 --> 24:41.640
 there's research to show that people who are in love

24:41.640 --> 24:43.800
 always see the best in each other

24:43.800 --> 24:48.300
 and when there's a negative interpretation

24:48.300 --> 24:49.640
 or a positive interpretation,

24:49.640 --> 24:50.820
 they choose the positive ones.

24:50.820 --> 24:54.080
 There's a little bit of positive illusion there going on.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.540
 That's what the research shows.

24:55.540 --> 25:00.540
 But I think that when you find somebody

25:00.540 --> 25:05.540
 when you find somebody who not just appreciates

25:07.900 --> 25:12.900
 your faults but loves you for them actually,

25:13.100 --> 25:16.620
 like maybe even doesn't see them as a fault,

25:16.620 --> 25:20.540
 that's, so you have to be honest enough

25:20.540 --> 25:24.020
 about what your faults are.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.060
 So it's easy to love someone for all the things

25:26.060 --> 25:31.060
 that they, for all the wonderful characteristics they have.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.940
 It's harder, I think, to love someone despite their faults

25:37.940 --> 25:39.820
 or maybe even the faults that they see

25:39.820 --> 25:41.140
 aren't really faults at all to you.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.860
 They're actually something really special.

25:43.860 --> 25:45.700
 But isn't that, can't you explain that

25:45.700 --> 25:48.780
 by saying the brain kind of, like you're projecting,

25:50.780 --> 25:54.300
 you have a conception of a human being

25:54.300 --> 25:58.100
 or just a spirit that really connects with you

25:58.100 --> 26:01.220
 and you're projecting that onto that person

26:01.220 --> 26:04.820
 and within that framework, all their faults

26:04.820 --> 26:06.420
 then become beautiful, like little.

26:06.420 --> 26:09.140
 Maybe, but you just have to pay attention

26:09.140 --> 26:10.380
 to the prediction error.

26:11.540 --> 26:13.700
 No, but maybe that's what love,

26:13.700 --> 26:17.620
 like maybe you started ignoring the prediction error.

26:17.620 --> 26:21.220
 Maybe love is just your ability, like.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.780
 To ignore the prediction error.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.900
 Well, I think that there's some research

26:24.900 --> 26:29.900
 that might say that, but that's not my experience, I guess.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.940
 But there is some research that says,

26:31.940 --> 26:33.260
 I mean, there's some research that says

26:33.260 --> 26:35.780
 you have to have an optimal margin of illusion,

26:35.780 --> 26:40.780
 which means that you put a positive spin on smaller things,

26:42.500 --> 26:45.100
 but you don't ignore the bigger things, right?

26:45.100 --> 26:48.380
 And I think without being judgmental at all,

26:48.380 --> 26:52.740
 when someone says to me, you're not who I thought you were,

26:52.740 --> 26:55.060
 I mean, nobody has said that to me in a really long time,

26:55.060 --> 26:56.580
 but certainly when I was younger,

26:56.580 --> 26:58.540
 that was, you're not who I thought you were.

26:58.540 --> 27:01.460
 My reaction to that was, well, whose fault is that?

27:01.460 --> 27:06.460
 You know, I'm a pretty upfront person.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.820
 I mean, I will though say that in my experience,

27:11.820 --> 27:15.860
 people don't lie to you about who they are.

27:15.860 --> 27:18.420
 They lie to themselves in your presence.

27:18.420 --> 27:23.420
 And so, you know, you don't wanna get tied up in that,

27:29.140 --> 27:30.260
 tangled up in that.

27:30.260 --> 27:32.500
 And I think from the get go,

27:32.500 --> 27:34.420
 Dan and I were just for whatever reason,

27:34.420 --> 27:36.220
 maybe it's because we both had been divorced already

27:36.220 --> 27:41.220
 and, you know, he told me who we thought he was

27:44.380 --> 27:47.380
 and he was pretty accurate as far as I could,

27:47.380 --> 27:48.540
 pretty much actually.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.180
 I mean, there's very,

27:51.420 --> 27:54.780
 I can't say that I've ever come across a characteristic

27:54.780 --> 27:58.460
 in him that really surprised me in a bad way.

27:58.460 --> 28:00.380
 It's hard to know yourself.

28:00.380 --> 28:01.220
 It is hard to know yourself.

28:01.220 --> 28:02.580
 And to communicate that.

28:02.580 --> 28:03.420
 For sure.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.460
 I mean, I'll say, you know,

28:05.460 --> 28:08.420
 I had the advantage of training as a therapist,

28:08.420 --> 28:11.660
 which meant for five years I was under a fucking microscope.

28:11.660 --> 28:12.500
 Yeah.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.820
 You know, when I was training as a therapist,

28:14.820 --> 28:17.020
 it was hour for hour supervision,

28:17.020 --> 28:20.580
 which meant if you were in a room with a client for an hour,

28:20.580 --> 28:23.860
 you had an hour with a supervisor.

28:23.860 --> 28:28.300
 So that supervisor was behind the mirror for your session.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.660
 And then you went and had an hour of discussion

28:30.660 --> 28:33.140
 about what you said, what you didn't say,

28:33.140 --> 28:37.860
 learning to use your own feelings and thoughts

28:37.860 --> 28:42.220
 as a tool to probe the mind of the client and so on.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.660
 And so you can't help but learn a lot of,

28:45.660 --> 28:47.700
 you can't help but learn a lot about yourself

28:47.700 --> 28:48.860
 in that process.

28:48.860 --> 28:53.860
 Do you think knowing or learning how the sausage is made

28:55.260 --> 28:58.100
 ruins the magic of the actual experience?

28:58.100 --> 29:01.540
 Like you as a neuroscientist who studies the brain,

29:01.540 --> 29:05.900
 do you think it ruins the magic of like love at first sight?

29:05.900 --> 29:09.180
 Or are you, do you consciously are still able

29:09.180 --> 29:11.260
 to lose yourself in the moment?

29:11.260 --> 29:13.620
 I'm definitely able to lose myself in the moment.

29:13.620 --> 29:14.740
 Is wine involved?

29:14.740 --> 29:17.340
 Not always, chocolate.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.220
 I mean, some kind of mind altering substance, right?

29:20.220 --> 29:23.100
 But yeah, for sure.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.620
 I mean, I guess what I would say though,

29:24.620 --> 29:29.620
 is that for me, part of the magic is the process.

29:31.140 --> 29:35.140
 Like, so I remember a day there was,

29:35.140 --> 29:38.220
 while I was working on this book of essays,

29:38.220 --> 29:39.780
 I was in New York.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.780
 I can't remember why I was in New York,

29:42.780 --> 29:44.660
 but I was in New York for something.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.940
 And I was in Central Park and I was looking

29:47.940 --> 29:50.380
 at all the people with their babies.

29:50.380 --> 29:54.860
 And I was thinking, each one of these,

29:54.860 --> 29:59.860
 there's a tiny little brain that's wiring itself right now.

30:00.180 --> 30:03.580
 And I just, I felt in that moment,

30:03.580 --> 30:06.020
 I was like, I am never gonna look at an infant

30:06.020 --> 30:08.340
 in the same way ever again.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.220
 And so to me, I mean, honestly,

30:11.220 --> 30:14.340
 before I started learning about brain development,

30:14.340 --> 30:17.780
 I thought babies were cute, but not that interesting

30:17.780 --> 30:21.380
 until they could do interact with you and do things.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.820
 Of course, my own infant, I thought,

30:22.820 --> 30:24.360
 was extraordinarily interesting,

30:24.360 --> 30:27.140
 but they're kind of like lumps.

30:27.140 --> 30:29.980
 That's until they can interact with you,

30:29.980 --> 30:31.600
 but they are anything but lumps.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.960
 I mean, so, and part of the,

30:35.860 --> 30:38.940
 I mean, all I can say is I have deep affection now

30:38.940 --> 30:41.600
 for like tiny little babies in a way

30:41.600 --> 30:45.460
 that I didn't really before

30:46.580 --> 30:51.580
 because of the, I'm just so curious.

30:51.740 --> 30:53.620
 But the actual process of the mechanisms

30:53.620 --> 30:56.480
 of the wiring of the brain, the learning,

30:56.480 --> 30:58.340
 all the magic of the neurobiology.

30:58.340 --> 31:01.080
 Yeah, and or something like,

31:03.080 --> 31:05.940
 when you make eye contact with someone directly,

31:05.940 --> 31:10.940
 sometimes you feel something, right?

31:10.940 --> 31:13.260
 Yeah, that's weird.

31:13.260 --> 31:14.420
 What is it?

31:14.420 --> 31:15.760
 And what is that?

31:15.760 --> 31:20.220
 And so to me, that's not backing away from the moment.

31:20.220 --> 31:22.020
 That's like expanding the moment.

31:22.020 --> 31:24.940
 It's like, that's incredibly cool.

31:24.940 --> 31:27.320
 You know, when I was, I'll just say that

31:27.320 --> 31:30.420
 when I was in graduate school,

31:30.420 --> 31:34.780
 I also was in therapy because it's almost a given

31:34.780 --> 31:36.900
 that you're gonna be in therapy yourself

31:36.900 --> 31:38.380
 if you're gonna become a therapist.

31:38.380 --> 31:41.980
 And I had a deal with my therapist,

31:41.980 --> 31:44.100
 which was that I could call timeout

31:44.100 --> 31:46.140
 at any moment that I wanted to,

31:46.140 --> 31:48.220
 as long as I was being responsible about it.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.640
 And I wasn't using it as a way to get out of something.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.340
 And he could tell me, no, he could decline and say,

31:54.340 --> 31:56.940
 no, you're using this to get out of something.

31:56.940 --> 31:58.940
 But I could call timeout whenever I want

31:58.940 --> 32:00.460
 and say, what are you doing right now?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.360
 Like, what are you, here's what I'm experiencing.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.580
 What are you trying to do?

32:03.580 --> 32:06.340
 Like I wanted to use my own experience

32:06.340 --> 32:10.880
 to interrogate what the process was.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.880
 And that made it more helpful in a way.

32:18.020 --> 32:18.860
 Do you know what I mean?

32:18.860 --> 32:21.600
 So yeah, I don't think learning how something works

32:21.600 --> 32:23.400
 makes it less magical actually,

32:23.400 --> 32:25.340
 but that's just me, I guess.

32:25.340 --> 32:26.540
 I don't know, would you?

32:27.780 --> 32:28.620
 Yes.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.100
 I tend to have two modes.

32:32.100 --> 32:35.580
 One is an engineer and one is a romantic.

32:35.580 --> 32:40.580
 And I'm conscious of like, there's two rooms.

32:41.340 --> 32:43.700
 You can go into the one, the engineer room.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.820
 And I think that ruins the romance.

32:45.820 --> 32:48.540
 So I tend to, there's two rooms.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.420
 One is the engineering room.

32:50.420 --> 32:53.400
 Think from first principles, how do we build the thing

32:53.400 --> 32:55.940
 that creates this kind of behavior?

32:55.940 --> 32:57.980
 And then you go into the romantic room

32:57.980 --> 33:00.180
 where you're like emotional, it's a roller coaster.

33:00.180 --> 33:03.900
 And then the thing is, let's take it slow.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.900
 And then you get married the next night

33:05.900 --> 33:08.660
 that you just this giant mess and you write a song

33:08.660 --> 33:12.180
 and then you cry and then you send a bunch of texts

33:12.180 --> 33:14.180
 and anger and whatever.

33:14.180 --> 33:17.180
 And somehow you're in Vegas and there's random people

33:17.180 --> 33:18.760
 and you're drunk and whatever, all that,

33:18.760 --> 33:21.900
 like in poetry and just mess of it, fighting.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.860
 Yeah, that's not, those are two rooms

33:24.860 --> 33:27.020
 and you go back between them.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.600
 But I think the way you put it is quite poetic.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.900
 I think you're much better at adulting

33:32.900 --> 33:37.580
 with love than perhaps I am.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.180
 Because there's a magic to children.

33:40.180 --> 33:45.180
 I also think like of adults as children.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.640
 It's kind of cool to see, it's a cool thought experiment

33:48.640 --> 33:53.300
 to look at adults and think like that used to be a baby.

33:53.300 --> 33:56.260
 And then that's like a fully wired baby.

33:56.260 --> 33:58.500
 And it's just walking around pretending to be like

33:58.500 --> 34:01.820
 all serious and important, wearing a suit or something.

34:01.820 --> 34:03.660
 But that used to be a baby.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.460
 And then you think of like the parenting

34:05.460 --> 34:07.500
 and all the experiences they had.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.900
 Like it's cool to think of it that way.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.420
 But then I start thinking like

34:11.420 --> 34:13.460
 from a machine learning perspective.

34:13.460 --> 34:16.260
 But once you're like the romantic moments,

34:16.260 --> 34:19.080
 all that kind of stuff, all that falls away.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.580
 I forget about all of that, I don't know.

34:21.580 --> 34:23.420
 That's the Russian thing.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.700
 Maybe, maybe.

34:24.700 --> 34:26.460
 But I also think it might be an age thing

34:26.460 --> 34:28.060
 or maybe an experience thing.

34:28.060 --> 34:33.020
 So I think we all, I mean,

34:33.020 --> 34:35.300
 if you're exposed to Western culture at all,

34:35.300 --> 34:40.020
 you are exposed to the sort of idealized,

34:40.020 --> 34:45.020
 stereotypic, romantic exchange.

34:45.620 --> 34:48.060
 And what does it mean to be romantic?

34:48.060 --> 34:50.120
 And so here's a test.

34:53.640 --> 34:55.000
 I'm seeing how to phrase it.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.980
 Okay, so not really a test,

34:56.980 --> 34:58.740
 but this tells you something about

34:58.740 --> 35:00.400
 your own ideas about romance.

35:03.780 --> 35:06.380
 For Valentine's Day one year,

35:06.380 --> 35:09.780
 my husband bought me a six way plug.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.900
 Is that romantic or not romantic?

35:14.980 --> 35:17.980
 Like, sorry, six way plug, is that like an outlet?

35:17.980 --> 35:19.460
 Yeah, like to put it in an outlet.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.620
 Is that romantic or not romantic?

35:21.620 --> 35:26.620
 I mean, it depends the look in his eyes when he does it.

35:28.020 --> 35:31.540
 I mean, it depends on the conversation

35:31.540 --> 35:33.780
 that led up to that point.

35:33.780 --> 35:38.140
 Depends how much, it's like the music,

35:38.140 --> 35:42.060
 because you have a very, you're both from the,

35:42.060 --> 35:44.300
 my experiences with you as a fan,

35:44.300 --> 35:45.700
 you have both a romantic niche,

35:45.700 --> 35:46.980
 but you have a very pragmatic,

35:46.980 --> 35:51.260
 like you cut through the bullshit of the fuzziness.

35:51.260 --> 35:53.300
 And there's something about a six way plug

35:53.300 --> 35:54.380
 that cuts through the bullshit

35:54.380 --> 35:55.380
 that connects to the human,

35:55.380 --> 35:57.380
 like he understands who you are.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.500
 Exactly, exactly.

36:00.500 --> 36:03.120
 That was the most romantic gift he could have given me

36:03.120 --> 36:05.980
 because he knows me so well.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.020
 He has a deep understanding of me,

36:08.020 --> 36:12.180
 which is that I will sit and suffer and complain

36:12.180 --> 36:15.580
 about the fact that I have to plug and unplug things.

36:15.580 --> 36:17.940
 And I will bitch and moan until the cows come home,

36:17.940 --> 36:21.300
 but it would never occur to me to go buy

36:21.300 --> 36:23.380
 a bloody six way plug.

36:23.380 --> 36:27.120
 Whereas for him, he bought it, he plugged it in,

36:27.120 --> 36:29.340
 he arranged, he taped up all my wires,

36:29.340 --> 36:31.980
 he made it like really usable.

36:31.980 --> 36:36.980
 And for me, that was the best present.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.500
 It was the most romantic thing

36:40.500 --> 36:43.600
 because he understood who I was

36:43.600 --> 36:45.060
 and he did something very,

36:45.060 --> 36:49.360
 or just the casual, like we moved into a house

36:49.360 --> 36:51.400
 that we went from having a two car garage

36:51.400 --> 36:52.920
 to a one car garage.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.640
 And I said, okay, I'm from Canada,

36:54.640 --> 36:56.020
 I'm not bothered by snow.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.620
 Well, I mean, I'm a little bothered by snow,

36:57.620 --> 36:59.240
 but he's very bothered by snow.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.820
 So I'm like, okay, you can park your car in the garage,

37:01.820 --> 37:03.280
 it's fine.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.500
 Every day when it snows, he goes out and cleans my car.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.340
 Every day.

37:08.980 --> 37:12.060
 I never asked him to do it, he just does it

37:12.060 --> 37:15.240
 because he knows that I'm cutting it really close

37:15.240 --> 37:17.900
 in the morning, when we all used to go to work.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.860
 I have a time to the second

37:20.860 --> 37:23.460
 so that I can get up as late as possible,

37:23.460 --> 37:25.980
 work out as long as possible,

37:25.980 --> 37:27.460
 and make it into my office

37:27.460 --> 37:29.220
 like a minute before my first meeting.

37:29.220 --> 37:31.660
 And so if it snows unexpectedly or something,

37:31.660 --> 37:35.180
 I'm screwed because now that's an added 10 or 15 minutes

37:35.180 --> 37:36.740
 and I'm gonna be late.

37:36.740 --> 37:39.340
 Anyways, it's just these little tiny things.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.620
 He's a really easygoing guy

37:43.620 --> 37:45.340
 and he doesn't look like somebody

37:45.340 --> 37:47.360
 who pays attention to detail.

37:48.340 --> 37:50.500
 He doesn't fuss about detail,

37:50.500 --> 37:53.140
 but he definitely pays attention to detail.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.940
 And it is very, very romantic in the sense

37:56.940 --> 38:01.940
 that he loves me despite my little details.

38:04.620 --> 38:05.820
 And understands you.

38:05.820 --> 38:06.660
 Yeah, he understands me.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.540
 It is kind of hilarious that that is,

38:09.540 --> 38:14.540
 the six way plug is the most fulfilling,

38:14.940 --> 38:19.220
 richest display of romance in your life.

38:19.220 --> 38:20.060
 I love it.

38:20.060 --> 38:20.880
 I love it.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.720
 That's what I mean about romance.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.700
 Romance is really, it's not all about chocolates

38:23.700 --> 38:25.500
 and flowers and whatever.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.220
 I mean, those are all nice too, but...

38:28.220 --> 38:29.820
 Sometimes it's about the six way plug.

38:29.820 --> 38:32.260
 Sometimes it's about the six way plug.

38:32.260 --> 38:35.500
 So maybe one way I could ask

38:35.500 --> 38:36.700
 before we talk about the details,

38:36.700 --> 38:38.540
 you also have the author of another book

38:38.540 --> 38:41.300
 as we talked about how emotions are made.

38:41.300 --> 38:44.020
 So it's interesting to talk about the process of writing.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.020
 You mentioned you were in New York.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.180
 What have you learned from writing these two books

38:48.180 --> 38:50.300
 about the actual process of writing?

38:50.300 --> 38:53.420
 And maybe, I don't know what's the most interesting thing

38:53.420 --> 38:54.260
 to talk about there.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.860
 Maybe the biggest challenges

38:55.860 --> 38:58.340
 or the boring, mundane, systematic,

38:58.340 --> 39:00.380
 like day to day of what worked for you,

39:00.380 --> 39:04.060
 like hacks or even just about the neuroscience

39:04.060 --> 39:07.000
 that you've learned through the process

39:07.000 --> 39:08.380
 of trying to write them.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.680
 Here's the thing I learned.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.760
 If you think that it's gonna take you a year

39:11.760 --> 39:12.660
 to write your book,

39:12.660 --> 39:15.260
 it's going to take you three years to write your book.

39:15.260 --> 39:17.120
 That's the first thing I learned

39:17.120 --> 39:22.120
 is that no matter how organized you are,

39:22.560 --> 39:27.560
 it's always gonna take way longer than what you think

39:28.740 --> 39:33.740
 in part because very few people make an outline

39:33.740 --> 39:35.100
 and then just stick to it.

39:36.740 --> 39:39.020
 Some of the topics really take on a life of their own

39:39.020 --> 39:43.740
 and to some extent you wanna let them have their voice.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.960
 You wanna follow leads until you feel satisfied

39:46.960 --> 39:51.960
 that you've dealt with the topic appropriately.

39:52.060 --> 39:54.460
 But that part is actually fun.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.420
 It's not fun to feel like you're constantly behind the eight

39:57.420 --> 39:59.460
 ball in terms of time.

39:59.460 --> 40:02.860
 But it is the exploration and the foraging for information

40:02.860 --> 40:05.020
 is incredibly fun.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.020
 For me anyways, I found it really enjoyable.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.180
 And if I wasn't also running a lab at the same time

40:09.180 --> 40:12.020
 and trying to keep my family going,

40:13.240 --> 40:15.900
 the whole thing would have just been fun.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.420
 But I would say the hardest thing about,

40:18.420 --> 40:20.180
 the most important thing I think I learned

40:20.180 --> 40:22.180
 is also the hardest thing and that for me,

40:22.180 --> 40:27.180
 which is knowing what to leave out.

40:27.740 --> 40:32.500
 A really good storyteller knows what to leave out.

40:32.500 --> 40:37.500
 In academic writing, you shouldn't leave anything out.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.440
 All the details should be there.

40:45.380 --> 40:49.880
 I've written or participated in writing

40:50.820 --> 40:54.620
 over 200 papers, peer reviewed papers.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.660
 So I'm pretty good with detail.

40:57.660 --> 41:01.940
 Knowing what to leave out and not harming

41:01.940 --> 41:04.140
 the validity of the story.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.820
 That is a tricky, tricky thing.

41:06.820 --> 41:10.180
 It was tricky when I wrote How Emotions Are Made,

41:10.180 --> 41:13.780
 but that's a standard popular science book.

41:13.780 --> 41:15.420
 So it's 300 something pages.

41:15.420 --> 41:18.300
 And then it has like a thousand end notes.

41:18.300 --> 41:22.420
 And then each of the end notes is attached to a web note,

41:22.420 --> 41:23.960
 which is also long.

41:23.960 --> 41:28.960
 So I mean, it's, and it start, and I mean the final draft,

41:28.960 --> 41:33.600
 I mean, I wrote three drafts of that book actually.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.960
 And the final draft, and then I had to cut by a third.

41:36.960 --> 41:41.960
 I mean, it was like 150,000 words or something.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.960
 And I had to cut it down to like 110.

41:44.960 --> 41:49.240
 So obviously it's, I struggle with what to leave out.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.520
 Brevity is not my strong suit.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.840
 I'm always telling people that it's a warning.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.120
 So that's why this book was,

41:55.120 --> 41:58.280
 I'd always been really fascinated with essays.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.960
 I love reading essays.

41:59.960 --> 42:04.960
 And after reading a small set of essays by Anne Fadiman

42:05.960 --> 42:07.800
 called At Large and At Small,

42:07.800 --> 42:10.280
 which I just love these little essays.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.280
 What's the topic of those essays?

42:12.280 --> 42:15.280
 They are, they're called familiar essays.

42:15.280 --> 42:18.240
 So the topics are like everyday topics,

42:18.240 --> 42:22.160
 like mail, coffee, chocolate.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.960
 I mean, just like, and what she does

42:23.960 --> 42:26.160
 is she weaves her own experience.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.060
 It's a little bit like these conversations

42:28.060 --> 42:30.560
 that you're so good at curating, actually.

42:32.060 --> 42:36.240
 You're weaving together history and philosophy and science

42:36.240 --> 42:38.560
 and also personal reflections.

42:38.560 --> 42:43.560
 And a little bit, you feel like you're like eavesdropping

42:44.760 --> 42:47.640
 on someone's train of thought in a way.

42:47.640 --> 42:51.560
 It's really, they're really compelling to me.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.320
 Even if it's just a mundane topic.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.280
 Yeah, but it's so interesting

42:55.280 --> 43:00.280
 to learn about like all of these little stories

43:02.760 --> 43:07.760
 in the wrapping of the history of like mail.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.080
 Like that's really interesting.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.000
 And so I read these essays

43:12.000 --> 43:15.400
 and then I wrote to her a little fan girl email.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.940
 This was many years ago.

43:16.940 --> 43:21.700
 And I said, I just love this book.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.760
 And how did you learn to write essays like this?

43:23.760 --> 43:26.000
 And she gave me a reading list of essays

43:26.000 --> 43:27.640
 that I should read like writers.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.980
 And so I read them all.

43:28.980 --> 43:33.600
 And anyway, so I decided it would be a really good challenge

43:33.600 --> 43:37.160
 for me to try to write something really brief

43:37.160 --> 43:42.160
 where I could focus on one or two really fascinating tidbits

43:45.360 --> 43:50.200
 of neuroscience, connect each one

43:50.200 --> 43:54.800
 to something philosophical or like just a question

43:54.800 --> 43:56.560
 about human nature.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.680
 Do it in a really brief format

43:58.680 --> 44:03.680
 without violating the validity of the science.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.240
 That was a, I just set myself this,

44:07.240 --> 44:09.480
 what I thought of as a really, really big challenge

44:09.480 --> 44:11.480
 in part because it was an incredibly hard thing

44:11.480 --> 44:13.340
 for me to do in the first book.

44:13.340 --> 44:15.520
 Yeah, we should say that this is,

44:15.520 --> 44:17.960
 The Seven and a Half Lessons is a very short book.

44:17.960 --> 44:22.840
 I mean, it's like it embodies brevity, right?

44:22.840 --> 44:25.680
 The whole point throughout is just,

44:25.680 --> 44:27.920
 I mean, you could tell that there's editing,

44:27.920 --> 44:31.200
 like there's pain in trying to bring it

44:31.200 --> 44:35.040
 as brief as possible, as clean as possible, yeah.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.880
 Yeah, so it's, the way I think of it is,

44:37.880 --> 44:41.400
 it's a little book of big science and big ideas.

44:41.400 --> 44:44.960
 Yeah, really big ideas in brief little packages.

44:44.960 --> 44:49.840
 And I wrote it so that people could read it.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.800
 I love reading on the beach.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.520
 I love reading essays on the beach.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.880
 I read it, I wrote it so people could read it on the beach

44:55.880 --> 44:58.920
 or in the bathtub or a subway stop.

44:58.920 --> 45:02.080
 Even if the beach is frozen over in the snow.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.700
 Yeah, so my husband, Dan, calls it

45:04.700 --> 45:06.720
 the first neuroscience beach read.

45:06.720 --> 45:10.040
 That's his phrasing, yeah.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.360
 And like you said, you learn a lot about writing

45:13.360 --> 45:15.280
 from your husband, like you were saying offline.

45:15.280 --> 45:20.280
 Well, he is, of the two of us, he is the better writer.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.280
 He is a masterful writer.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.760
 He's also, I mean, he's a PhD in computer science.

45:28.760 --> 45:29.960
 He's a software engineer,

45:29.960 --> 45:34.960
 but he's also really good at organization of knowledge.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.840
 So he built for a company he used to work for,

45:38.840 --> 45:41.680
 he built one of the first knowledge management systems.

45:41.680 --> 45:44.200
 And he now works at Google

45:44.200 --> 45:46.560
 where he does engineering education.

45:46.560 --> 45:50.140
 Like he understands how to tell a good story,

45:51.540 --> 45:54.760
 just about anything, really.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.120
 He's got impeccable timing, he's really funny.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.720
 And luckily for me, he knows very little

46:01.720 --> 46:03.560
 about psychology or neuroscience.

46:03.560 --> 46:05.720
 Well, now he knows more, obviously, but.

46:05.720 --> 46:10.720
 So when How Emotions Were Made, he was really, really helpful

46:13.600 --> 46:17.200
 to me because the first draft of every chapter

46:17.200 --> 46:19.780
 was me talking to him about what,

46:19.780 --> 46:22.560
 I would talk out loud about what I wanted to say

46:22.560 --> 46:24.840
 and the order in which I wanted to say it.

46:24.840 --> 46:28.880
 And then I would write it and then he would read it

46:28.880 --> 46:32.080
 and tell me all the bits that could be excised.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.520
 And sometimes we would, I should say,

46:35.520 --> 46:39.080
 I mean, we don't, he and I don't really argue about much

46:39.080 --> 46:41.440
 except directions in the car.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.280
 Like if we're gonna have an argument,

46:44.280 --> 46:46.200
 that's gonna be where it's gonna happen, where.

46:46.200 --> 46:50.000
 What's the nature of the argument about directions exactly?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.520
 I don't really know, it's just that we're very,

46:52.520 --> 46:54.240
 I think it's that spatially,

46:56.600 --> 46:58.700
 I use egocentric space.

46:58.700 --> 47:01.400
 So I wanna say, turn left.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.880
 Like I'm reasoning in relation

47:03.880 --> 47:06.640
 to my own physical corporeal body.

47:06.640 --> 47:10.000
 So you walk to the church and you turn left and you,

47:10.000 --> 47:11.960
 then whatever, I'm always like,

47:11.960 --> 47:16.240
 and he gives directions allocentrically,

47:16.240 --> 47:21.000
 which means organized around north, south, east, west.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.320
 So to you, the earth is at the center of the solar system

47:24.320 --> 47:26.480
 and to him, reasonably.

47:26.480 --> 47:27.320
 I'm at the center.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.960
 You're at the center of the solar system.

47:29.960 --> 47:30.920
 Okay, so.

47:30.920 --> 47:35.920
 Anyway, but here, we had some really riproaring arguments,

47:37.680 --> 47:40.280
 like really riproaring arguments where he would say,

47:40.280 --> 47:41.920
 like, who is this for?

47:41.920 --> 47:44.360
 Is this for the 1%?

47:44.360 --> 47:47.880
 And I'd be like, 1% meaning not wealth,

47:47.880 --> 47:51.120
 but like civilians versus academics.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.160
 Are these for the scientists

47:52.160 --> 47:54.120
 or is this for the civilians, right?

47:54.120 --> 47:56.360
 So he speaks for the people, for the civilians.

47:56.360 --> 47:59.200
 He speaks for the people and I'd be like, no, you have to.

47:59.200 --> 48:03.080
 And so he made, after one terrible argument that we had

48:03.080 --> 48:05.800
 where it was really starting to affect our relationship

48:05.800 --> 48:09.040
 because we were so mad at each other all the time,

48:09.040 --> 48:14.040
 he made these little signs, writing and science.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.760
 And we only use them, this was like,

48:17.760 --> 48:20.480
 when you pulled out a sign, that's it.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.200
 Like the other person just wins

48:22.200 --> 48:25.200
 and you have to stop fighting about it and that's it.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.600
 And so we just did that.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.160
 And we didn't really have to use it too much for this book

48:29.160 --> 48:32.040
 because this book was in some ways,

48:34.400 --> 48:37.280
 I didn't have to learn a lot of new things for this book.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.960
 I had to learn some, but a lot of

48:41.960 --> 48:46.480
 what I learned for How Emotions Are Made

48:46.480 --> 48:49.600
 really stood me in good stead for this book.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.440
 So there was a little bit,

48:50.440 --> 48:52.400
 each essay was a little bit of learning.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.920
 A couple were, was a little more than the small amount.

48:55.920 --> 48:59.400
 But I didn't have so much trouble here.

48:59.400 --> 49:02.320
 I had a lot of trouble with the first book.

49:02.320 --> 49:07.320
 But still even here, he would tell me

49:07.320 --> 49:08.720
 that I could take something out

49:08.720 --> 49:10.160
 and I really wanted to keep it.

49:10.160 --> 49:14.440
 And I think we only use the signs once.

49:14.440 --> 49:17.160
 Well, if we could dive in some aspects of the book,

49:17.160 --> 49:18.200
 I would love that.

49:18.200 --> 49:23.200
 Can we talk about, so one of the essays looks at evolution.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.620
 It looks at evolution.

49:28.480 --> 49:30.880
 Let me ask the big question.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.880
 Did the human brain evolve to think?

49:33.880 --> 49:38.320
 That's essentially the question that you address in the essay.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.440
 Can you speak to it?

49:39.440 --> 49:40.960
 Sure.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.360
 The big caveat here is that

49:43.360 --> 49:45.760
 we don't really know why brains evolved.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.800
 The big why questions are called teleological questions.

49:49.800 --> 49:54.800
 And in general, scientists should avoid those questions

49:55.040 --> 49:58.660
 because we don't know really why, we don't know the why.

49:58.660 --> 50:03.660
 However, for a very long time,

50:03.860 --> 50:07.080
 the assumption was that evolution worked

50:07.080 --> 50:09.400
 in a progressive upward scale,

50:09.400 --> 50:11.200
 that you start off with simple organisms

50:11.200 --> 50:13.160
 and those organisms get more complex

50:13.160 --> 50:14.940
 and more complex and more complex.

50:14.940 --> 50:18.720
 Now, obviously that's true in some like really general way,

50:18.720 --> 50:22.720
 right, that life started off as single cell organisms

50:22.720 --> 50:24.440
 and things got more complex.

50:24.440 --> 50:29.440
 But the idea that brains evolved in some upward trajectory

50:32.320 --> 50:34.700
 from simple brains in simple animals

50:34.700 --> 50:37.040
 to complex brains in complex animals

50:37.040 --> 50:39.340
 is called a phylogenetic scale.

50:40.240 --> 50:44.380
 And that phylogenetic scale is embedded

50:44.380 --> 50:46.020
 in a lot of evolutionary thinking,

50:46.020 --> 50:48.880
 including Darwin's actually.

50:48.880 --> 50:53.120
 And it's been seriously challenged, I would say,

50:53.120 --> 50:56.340
 by modern evolutionary biology.

50:57.480 --> 51:01.540
 And so thinking is something that,

51:01.540 --> 51:04.340
 rationality is something that humans,

51:04.340 --> 51:07.360
 at least in the West, really prize

51:07.360 --> 51:10.640
 as a great human achievement.

51:10.640 --> 51:15.640
 And so the idea that the most common evolutionary story

51:15.640 --> 51:20.360
 is that brains evolved in like sedimentary rock

51:21.680 --> 51:25.520
 with a layer for instincts, that's your lizard brain,

51:25.520 --> 51:30.460
 and a layer on top of that for emotions,

51:30.460 --> 51:33.240
 that's your limbic system, limbic meaning border.

51:33.240 --> 51:36.480
 So it borders the parts that are for instincts.

51:36.480 --> 51:37.320
 Oh, interesting.

51:37.320 --> 51:42.320
 And then the neocortex or new cortex

51:42.320 --> 51:46.120
 where rationality is supposed to live.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.440
 That's the sort of traditional story.

51:48.440 --> 51:52.000
 It just keeps getting layered on top by evolution.

51:52.000 --> 51:52.840
 Right.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.880
 And so you can think about, I mean,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.440
 sedimentary rock is the way typically people describe it.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.440
 The way I sometimes like to think about it

52:00.440 --> 52:03.320
 is thinking about the cerebral cortex

52:03.320 --> 52:06.800
 like icing on an already baked cake,

52:08.800 --> 52:11.120
 where the cake is your inner beast.

52:11.120 --> 52:14.520
 These like boiling, roiling instincts and emotions

52:14.520 --> 52:19.520
 that have to be contained by the cortex.

52:19.760 --> 52:23.840
 And it's just, it's a fiction, it's a myth.

52:23.840 --> 52:26.240
 It's a myth that you can trace all the way back

52:26.240 --> 52:31.040
 to stories about morality in ancient Greece.

52:31.040 --> 52:35.600
 But what you can do is look at the scientific record

52:35.600 --> 52:38.120
 and say, well, there are other stories

52:38.120 --> 52:40.160
 that you could tell about brain evolution

52:40.160 --> 52:45.160
 and the context in which brains evolved.

52:45.560 --> 52:50.560
 So when you look at creatures who don't have brains

52:50.560 --> 52:55.040
 and you look at creatures who do, what's the difference?

52:55.920 --> 53:00.920
 And you can look at some animals.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.640
 So we call, scientists call an environment

53:05.640 --> 53:09.280
 that an animal lives in a niche, their environmental niche.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.800
 What are the things, what are the parts

53:10.800 --> 53:13.160
 of the environment that matter to that animal?

53:13.160 --> 53:15.840
 And so there are some animals whose niche

53:15.840 --> 53:18.400
 hasn't changed in 400 million years.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.520
 So they're not, these creatures are modern creatures

53:21.520 --> 53:24.480
 but they're living in a niche that hasn't changed much.

53:24.480 --> 53:27.200
 And so their biology hasn't changed much.

53:27.200 --> 53:30.400
 And you can kind of verify that by looking at the genes

53:30.400 --> 53:34.440
 that lurk deep in the molecular structure of cells.

53:34.440 --> 53:38.880
 And so you can, by looking at various animals

53:38.880 --> 53:41.920
 in their developmental state, meaning not,

53:41.920 --> 53:43.160
 you don't look at adult animals,

53:43.160 --> 53:46.920
 you look at embryos of animals and developing animals,

53:46.920 --> 53:49.760
 you can see, you can piece together a different story.

53:49.760 --> 53:53.960
 And that story is that brains evolved

53:53.960 --> 53:57.960
 under the selection pressure of hunting.

53:57.960 --> 54:01.840
 That in the Cambrian period, hunting emerged on the scene

54:01.840 --> 54:05.000
 where animals deliberately ate one another.

54:06.160 --> 54:11.160
 And what, so before the Cambrian period,

54:11.200 --> 54:14.440
 the animals didn't really have,

54:14.440 --> 54:15.840
 well, they didn't have brains,

54:15.840 --> 54:19.000
 but they also didn't have senses really,

54:19.000 --> 54:20.920
 the very, very rudimentary senses.

54:20.920 --> 54:25.920
 So the animal that I wrote about in seven and a half lessons

54:26.360 --> 54:29.120
 is called an amphioxus or a lancelet.

54:29.120 --> 54:34.120
 And little amphioxus has no eyes,

54:34.240 --> 54:38.960
 it has no ears, it has no nose, it has no eyes.

54:38.960 --> 54:43.960
 It has a couple of cells for detecting light and dark

54:44.760 --> 54:47.480
 for circadian rhythm purposes.

54:47.480 --> 54:51.240
 And it can't hear, it has a vestibular cell

54:51.240 --> 54:52.960
 to keep its body upright.

54:53.960 --> 54:56.960
 It has a very rudimentary sense of touch

54:56.960 --> 55:00.400
 and it doesn't really have any internal organs

55:00.400 --> 55:03.040
 other than this like basically stomach.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.760
 It's like a, just like a,

55:04.760 --> 55:06.960
 it doesn't have an enteric nervous system.

55:06.960 --> 55:11.440
 It doesn't have like a gut that moves like we do.

55:11.440 --> 55:14.320
 It just has basically a tube.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.680
 So it's like a little container, yeah.

55:16.680 --> 55:20.120
 And so, and really it doesn't move very much.

55:20.120 --> 55:22.120
 It can move, it just sort of wriggles.

55:22.120 --> 55:24.680
 It doesn't have very sophisticated movement.

55:24.680 --> 55:27.800
 And it's this really sweet little animal.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.560
 It sort of wriggles its way to a spot

55:30.560 --> 55:33.520
 and then plants itself in the sand

55:33.520 --> 55:36.840
 and just filters food as the food goes by.

55:37.880 --> 55:41.560
 And then when the food concentration decreases,

55:41.560 --> 55:46.560
 it just ejects itself, wriggles to some spot randomly

55:47.920 --> 55:50.440
 where probabilistically there will be more food

55:50.440 --> 55:51.920
 and plants itself again.

55:51.920 --> 55:56.280
 So it's not really aware,

55:56.280 --> 55:58.320
 very aware that it has an environment.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.680
 It has a niche, but that niche is very small

56:00.680 --> 56:05.200
 and it's not really experiencing that niche very much.

56:05.200 --> 56:08.040
 So it's basically like a little stomach on a stick.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.800
 That's really what it is.

56:09.800 --> 56:14.800
 And, but when animals start to literally hunt each other,

56:14.800 --> 56:17.800
 all of a sudden it becomes important

56:17.800 --> 56:20.480
 to have, to be able to sense your environment.

56:20.480 --> 56:23.880
 Cause you need to know, is that blob up ahead

56:23.880 --> 56:26.480
 gonna eat me or should I eat it?

56:27.440 --> 56:29.520
 And so all of a sudden you want,

56:29.520 --> 56:31.680
 distance senses are very useful.

56:31.680 --> 56:35.680
 And so in the water, distance senses are vision

56:36.720 --> 56:38.920
 and a little bit hearing.

56:38.920 --> 56:43.920
 Olfaction, smelling and touch,

56:43.920 --> 56:46.280
 because in the water touch is a distance sense

56:46.280 --> 56:49.280
 cause you can feel the vibration, so it's right.

56:49.280 --> 56:54.280
 So on land, you know, vision is a distance sense,

56:54.600 --> 56:58.600
 touch not so much, but for elephants maybe, right?

56:58.600 --> 56:59.440
 The vibrations.

56:59.440 --> 57:02.760
 Vibrations, olfaction definitely

57:02.760 --> 57:04.280
 because of the distance sense.

57:04.280 --> 57:07.480
 And so it's very important to have a sense of touch

57:07.480 --> 57:09.840
 and olfaction definitely because of the concentration

57:09.840 --> 57:12.240
 of, you know, the more concentrated something is,

57:12.240 --> 57:14.840
 the more likely it is to be close to you.

57:14.840 --> 57:17.920
 So animals developed senses.

57:17.920 --> 57:20.340
 They developed a head, like a literal head.

57:20.340 --> 57:22.120
 So amphyoxus doesn't even have a head really.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.640
 It's just a long.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.760
 What's the purpose of a head?

57:25.760 --> 57:27.360
 That's a great question.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.600
 Is it to have a jaw?

57:29.600 --> 57:30.800
 That's a great question.

57:30.800 --> 57:35.560
 So jaw, so yes, jaws are a major.

57:35.560 --> 57:36.680
 Useful feature.

57:36.680 --> 57:39.280
 Yeah, obviously they're a major adaptation

57:39.280 --> 57:42.600
 after there's a split between vertebrates and invertebrates.

57:42.600 --> 57:45.320
 So amphyoxus is thought to be very, very similar

57:45.320 --> 57:48.740
 to the animal that's before that split.

57:48.740 --> 57:50.160
 But then after the development,

57:50.160 --> 57:52.660
 very quickly after the development of a head

57:52.660 --> 57:56.060
 is the development of a jaw, which is a big thing.

57:56.060 --> 57:59.400
 And what goes along with that

57:59.400 --> 58:02.000
 is the development of a brain.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.160
 It's weird, is that just a coincidence

58:04.160 --> 58:07.800
 that the thing, the part of our body,

58:07.800 --> 58:12.520
 of the mammal, I think, body that we eat with

58:12.520 --> 58:15.300
 and attack others with is also the thing

58:15.300 --> 58:20.300
 that contains all the majority of the brain type of stuff.

58:21.840 --> 58:25.000
 Well, actually the brain goes with the development of a head

58:25.000 --> 58:27.760
 and the development of a visual system

58:27.760 --> 58:31.440
 and an auditory system and an olfactory system and so on.

58:31.440 --> 58:34.800
 So your senses are developing

58:34.800 --> 58:38.740
 and the other thing that's happening

58:38.740 --> 58:40.440
 is that animals are getting bigger

58:41.680 --> 58:44.560
 because they're, and also their niche is getting bigger.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.840
 Well, this is the, just sorry to take a tiny tangent

58:47.840 --> 58:50.400
 on the niche thing is it seems like the niche

58:50.400 --> 58:53.400
 is getting bigger, but not just bigger,

58:53.400 --> 58:56.680
 like more complicated, like shaped in weird ways.

58:56.680 --> 59:01.680
 So predation seems to create, the whole world

59:01.760 --> 59:03.400
 becomes your oyster, whatever,

59:03.400 --> 59:06.680
 but you also start to carve out the places

59:06.680 --> 59:08.360
 in which you can operate the best.

59:08.360 --> 59:10.500
 Yeah, and in fact, that's absolutely right.

59:10.500 --> 59:15.040
 And in fact, some scientists think that theory of mind,

59:15.040 --> 59:16.520
 your ability to make inferences

59:16.520 --> 59:21.000
 about the inner life of other creatures

59:21.000 --> 59:24.200
 actually developed under the selection pressure of predation

59:24.200 --> 59:28.100
 because it makes you a better predator.

59:28.100 --> 59:31.180
 Do you ever look at, you just said you looked at babies

59:31.180 --> 59:34.960
 as these wiring creatures.

59:34.960 --> 59:39.300
 Do you ever think of humans as just clever predators?

59:39.300 --> 59:43.120
 Like that there's, underneath it all is this

59:44.560 --> 59:49.440
 the Nietzschean will to power in all of its forms?

59:49.440 --> 59:52.080
 Or are we now friendlier?

59:52.080 --> 59:54.200
 Yeah, so it's interesting.

59:54.200 --> 59:57.260
 I mean, there are zeitgeists

59:57.260 --> 59:59.660
 in how humans think about themselves, right?

59:59.660 --> 1:00:02.440
 And so if you look in the 20th century,

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:08.020
 you can see that the idea of an inner beast

1:00:08.020 --> 1:00:10.880
 that we're just predators, we're just basically animals,

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:13.300
 baseless animals, violent animals

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:15.240
 that have to be contained by culture

1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:17.640
 and by our prodigious neocortex

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:22.640
 really took hold, particularly after World War I,

1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:30.300
 and really held sway for much of that century.

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:36.940
 And then around, at least in Western writing, I would say,

1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:38.520
 you know, we're talking mainly

1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:41.140
 about Western scientific writing,

1:00:41.140 --> 1:00:42.780
 Western philosophical writing.

1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:47.780
 And then, you know, late 90s maybe,

1:00:47.980 --> 1:00:50.500
 you start to see books and articles

1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:53.560
 about our social nature, that we're social animals.

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:54.660
 And we are social animals,

1:00:54.660 --> 1:00:57.140
 but what does that mean exactly?

1:00:57.140 --> 1:01:00.180
 And about.

1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:02.020
 It's us carving out different niches

1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:03.460
 in the space of ideas, it looks like.

1:01:03.460 --> 1:01:04.500
 I think so, I think so.

1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:13.500
 So, you know, do humans, can humans be violent?

1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:15.540
 Yes.

1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:17.940
 Can humans be really helpful?

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:19.720
 Yes, actually.

1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:22.920
 And humans are interesting creatures

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:25.940
 because, you know, other animals

1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:28.340
 can also be helpful to one another.

1:01:28.340 --> 1:01:30.940
 In fact, there's a whole literature, booming literature

1:01:30.940 --> 1:01:35.940
 on how other animals support one another.

1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:40.620
 They regulate each other's nervous systems

1:01:40.620 --> 1:01:41.700
 in interesting ways,

1:01:41.700 --> 1:01:43.540
 and they will be helpful to one another, right?

1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:46.400
 So for example, there's a whole literature on rodents

1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:51.400
 and how they signal one another what is safe to eat,

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.000
 and they will perform acts of generosity

1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000
 to their conspecifics that are related to them,

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.280
 or who they were raised with.

1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.960
 So if an animal was raised in a litter

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:07.760
 that they were raised in,

1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.360
 although not even at the same time,

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:11.320
 they'll be more likely to help that animal.

1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:14.800
 So there's always some kind of physical relationship

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.720
 between animals that predicts

1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:19.840
 whether or not they'll help one another.

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:27.800
 For humans, you know, we have ways of categorizing

1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:32.800
 who's in our group and who isn't by nonphysical ways, right?

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.960
 Even by just something abstract, like an idea.

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:39.840
 And we are much more likely to extend help

1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:41.760
 to people in our own group,

1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:44.960
 whatever that group may be at that moment,

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:48.760
 whatever feature you're using to do that.

1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:51.040
 Feature you're using to define who's in your group

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:51.920
 and who isn't.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.840
 We're more likely to help those people

1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:59.240
 than even members of our own family at times.

1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:03.240
 So humans are much more flexible in their,

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.000
 in the way that they help one another,

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.860
 but also in the way that they harm one another.

1:03:08.860 --> 1:03:13.860
 So I don't think I subscribe to,

1:03:13.860 --> 1:03:18.180
 I don't think I subscribe to, you know,

1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:21.020
 we are primarily this or we are primarily that.

1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:25.140
 I don't think humans have essences in that way, really.

1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:27.260
 I apologize to take us in this direction

1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:28.260
 for a brief moment,

1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:31.940
 but I've been really deep on Stalin and Hitler recently

1:03:32.900 --> 1:03:34.060
 in terms of reading.

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:37.860
 And is there something that you think about

1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:41.580
 in terms of the nature of evil

1:03:41.580 --> 1:03:44.020
 from a neuroscience perspective?

1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:49.020
 Is there some lessons that are sort of hopeful

1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:57.220
 about human civilization that we can find in our brain

1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:00.280
 with regard to the Hitlers of the world?

1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:05.360
 Do you think about the nature of evil?

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.420
 Yeah, I do.

1:04:07.420 --> 1:04:11.020
 I don't know that what I have to say is so useful

1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:14.100
 from a, I don't know that I can say as a neuroscientist,

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:17.700
 well, here's a study that, you know,

1:04:17.700 --> 1:04:20.180
 so I sort of have to take off my lab coat, right?

1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:22.780
 And now I'm gonna now conjecture as a human

1:04:22.780 --> 1:04:24.660
 who just also, who has opinions,

1:04:24.660 --> 1:04:28.140
 but who also maybe has some knowledge about neuroscience.

1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:30.640
 But I'm not speaking as a neuroscientist when I say this,

1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:33.680
 cause I don't think neuroscientists know enough really

1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:34.520
 to be able to say,

1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:38.000
 but I guess the kinds of things I think about are,

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000
 what, so I have always thought,

1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:47.280
 even before I knew anything about neuroscience,

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:49.680
 I've always thought that,

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:54.980
 I don't think anybody could become Hitler,

1:04:54.980 --> 1:04:58.540
 but I think the majority of people can be,

1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:02.760
 can do, are capable of doing very bad things.

1:05:05.260 --> 1:05:06.680
 It's just, the question is really

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:09.200
 how much encouragement does it take from the environment

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.240
 to get them to do something bad?

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:14.400
 That's what I kind of, when I look at the life of Hitler,

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:19.400
 it seems like there's so many places where...

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:20.960
 Something could have intervened.

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:23.360
 Intervene, no, it could change completely the person.

1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:25.280
 I mean, there's like the caricature,

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:28.480
 like the obvious places where he was an artist

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.360
 and if he wasn't rejected as an artist,

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.080
 he was a reasonably good artist.

1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:33.360
 So that could have changed,

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:36.760
 but just his entire, like where he went in Vienna

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:37.720
 and all these kinds of things,

1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:40.000
 like little interactions could have changed

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.240
 and there's probably millions of other people

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:49.240
 who are capable, who the environment may be able to mold

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.760
 in the same way it did this particular person

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:55.960
 to create this particular kind of charismatic leader

1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:57.560
 in this particular moment of time.

1:05:57.560 --> 1:06:01.360
 Absolutely, and I guess the way that I would say it,

1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:04.000
 I would agree 100% and I guess the way that I would say it

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:08.200
 is like this, in the West,

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:13.200
 we have a way of reasoning about causation,

1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:19.080
 which focuses on single, simple causes for things.

1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:22.680
 There's an essence to Hitler,

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:24.800
 there's an essence to his character.

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:26.640
 He was born with that essence

1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:30.160
 or it was forged very, very early in his life

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:35.160
 and that explains the horrible landscape of his behavior.

1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:41.080
 But there's another way to think about it,

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:42.800
 a way that actually is much more consistent

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:45.720
 with what we know about biology,

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:48.920
 how biology works in the physical world.

1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:52.160
 And that is that most things are complex,

1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.280
 not as in, wow, this is really complex and hard,

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.880
 but complex as in complexity,

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:59.800
 that is more than the sum of their parts

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:03.880
 and that most phenomena have many, many

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:08.760
 weak nonlinear interacting causes.

1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:13.760
 And so little things that we might not even be aware of

1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:17.200
 can shift someone's developmental trajectory

1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.000
 from this to that and that's enough

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:23.200
 to take it on a whole set of other paths

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:28.400
 and that these things are happening all the time.

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:31.280
 So it's not random and it's not really,

1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:32.840
 it's not deterministic in the sense

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:35.960
 that like everything you do determines your outcome,

1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:40.960
 but it's a little more like you're nudging someone

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:44.520
 from one set of possibilities

1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.640
 to another set of possibilities.

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:50.000
 But I think the thing that I find optimistic

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:54.680
 is that the other side of that coin is also true.

1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:59.680
 So look at all the people who risked their lives

1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:04.520
 to help people they didn't even know.

1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:09.120
 I mean, I just watched Borat, the new Borat movie.

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.680
 And the thing that I came away with,

1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:14.320
 but the thing I came away with was,

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.000
 look at how generous people were in that.

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.400
 Oh, he's making, there are a lot of people he makes fun of

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:24.600
 and that's fine, but think about like those two people

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:27.080
 two guys, those.

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:28.400
 The Trump supporter guys.

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:29.960
 The Trump supporter guys.

1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:30.800
 Those guys.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:33.200
 That was cool, there was kindness in them, right?

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.200
 They took a complete stranger in a pandemic

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.400
 into their house.

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:42.920
 Who does that?

1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:44.720
 Like that's a really nice thing.

1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:47.540
 Or there's one scene, I mean, I don't wanna spoil it

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:49.340
 for people who haven't seen it,

1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:51.800
 but there's one scene where he goes in,

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:56.800
 he dresses up as a Jew, I laugh myself sick at that scene,

1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:00.840
 seriously, but he goes in

1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:03.080
 and there are these two old Jewish ladies.

1:09:04.180 --> 1:09:07.920
 What a bunch of sweethearts, oh my gosh.

1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:12.240
 Like really, I mean, that was what I was struck by actually.

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:15.440
 I mean, there are other ones or like the babysitter, right?

1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:18.560
 I mean, she was really kind.

1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:22.680
 And yeah, so that's really what I was more struck by.

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.480
 Like sure, there are other people

1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:30.480
 who do very bad things or say bad things or whatever,

1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:35.160
 but like there's one guy who's completely stoic,

1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:39.160
 like the guy who's sending the messages,

1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:41.760
 I don't know if it's facts or whatever.

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.440
 He's just completely stoic,

1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:45.580
 but he's doing his job actually.

1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:48.880
 Like you don't know what he was thinking inside his head,

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:49.800
 you don't know what he's feeling,

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:52.120
 but he was totally professional doing his job.

1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:58.080
 So I guess I just, I had a bit of a different view, I guess.

1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:00.440
 So I also think that about people,

1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:04.000
 I think everybody is capable of kindness,

1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.820
 but the question is how much does it take

1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:09.880
 and what are the circumstances?

1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:11.920
 So for some people it's gonna take a lot

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.360
 and for some people it only takes a little bit,

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:19.360
 but are we actually cultivating an environment

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:26.680
 for the next generation that provides opportunities

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.720
 for people to go in the direction of caring and kindness

1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:37.720
 or, and I'm not saying that as like a Pollyanna ish person.

1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:42.600
 I think there's a lot of room for competition

1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:45.240
 and debate and so on,

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:50.200
 but I don't see Hitler as an anomaly and I never have,

1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:52.680
 that was even before I learned anything about neuroscience.

1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:55.000
 And now I would say knowing what we know

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.280
 about developmental trajectories and life histories

1:10:57.280 --> 1:10:58.600
 and how important that is,

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.600
 knowing what we know about that the whole question

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:07.860
 of like nature versus nurture is a completely wrong question.

1:11:07.860 --> 1:11:11.000
 We have the kind of nature that requires nurture,

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.960
 we have the kind of genes that allow infants to be born

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.040
 with unfinished brains where the brains,

1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:21.900
 their brains are wired across a 25 year period

1:11:21.900 --> 1:11:23.780
 with wiring instructions from the world

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.980
 that is created for them.

1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:29.940
 And so I don't think Hitler is an anomaly,

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.040
 even if it's less probable that that would happen,

1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:39.160
 it's possible that it could happen again

1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:43.280
 and it's not like, you know, he's a bad seed.

1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:45.980
 I mean, that doesn't, I just wanna say for like,

1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:48.720
 of course he's completely 100% responsible for his actions

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.120
 and all the bad things that happen.

1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:53.360
 So I'm not in any way, this is not me saying.

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:56.240
 But the environment is also responsible in part

1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:59.240
 for creating the evil in this world.

1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:04.240
 So like Hitler's in different versions of even more subtle,

1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:07.480
 more smaller scale versions of evil.

1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:12.480
 But I tend to believe that there's a much stronger,

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.360
 I don't like to talk about evolutionary advantages,

1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:20.520
 but it seems like it makes sense for love

1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.240
 to be a more powerful emergent phenomena

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.680
 of our collective intelligence versus hate

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:30.540
 and evil and destruction.

1:12:30.540 --> 1:12:34.400
 Because from a survival, from a niche perspective,

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:38.600
 it seems to be like in my own life

1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.280
 and my thinking about the intuition

1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:44.560
 about the way humans work together to solve problems,

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:47.760
 it seems that love is a very useful tool.

1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.080
 I definitely agree with you.

1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:54.400
 But I think the caveat here is that, you know,

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:58.600
 humans, the research suggests that humans are capable

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.600
 of great acts of kindness and great acts of generosity

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.500
 to people in their in group.

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:10.820
 Right, so we're also tribal.

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:14.400
 Yeah, I mean, that's the kitschy way to say it.

1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:16.560
 We're tribes, we're tribal, yeah.

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:18.280
 So that's the kitschy way to say it.

1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:22.320
 What I would say is that, you know,

1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:24.600
 there are a lot of features

1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:28.300
 that you can use to describe yourself.

1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:31.160
 You don't have one identity, you don't have one self,

1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:33.600
 you have many selves, you have many identities.

1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:37.420
 Sometimes you're a man, sometimes you're a scientist,

1:13:37.420 --> 1:13:40.240
 sometimes you're a, do you have a brother or a sister?

1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:41.060
 Yeah, brother.

1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:42.400
 So sometimes you're a brother.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:45.120
 You know, sometimes you're a friend.

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.640
 Sometimes you're a human so you can keep zooming out.

1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:48.480
 Yes, exactly.

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:49.660
 Living organism on Earth.

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:53.400
 Yes, exactly, that's exactly right.

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:58.120
 And so there are some people

1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:01.820
 who there is research which suggests

1:14:01.820 --> 1:14:05.180
 that there are some people who will tell you,

1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:08.660
 I think it's appropriate and better to help.

1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:11.420
 I should help my family more than I should help my neighbors

1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:13.920
 and I should help my neighbors more than I should help

1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:15.360
 the average stranger.

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.240
 And I should help, you know, the average stranger

1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:20.840
 in my country more than I should help

1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:22.120
 somebody outside my country.

1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:25.480
 And I should help humans more than I should help,

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:26.520
 you know, other animals.

1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:28.400
 And I should, right, so there's a clear hierarchy

1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:33.120
 of helping and there are other people who, you know,

1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:37.120
 they are, their niche is much more inclusive, right?

1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:40.920
 And that they're humans first, right?

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:43.660
 Or creatures of the Earth first, let's say.

1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:50.400
 And I don't think we know how flexible those attitudes are

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.960
 because I don't think the research really tells us that.

1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:56.860
 But in any case, there are, you know,

1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:59.960
 and there are beliefs, people also have beliefs about,

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:03.360
 there's this really interesting research in,

1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:06.720
 really in anthropology that looks at

1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:12.420
 what are cultures particularly afraid of?

1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:15.160
 Like what the people in a particular culture

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.360
 are organizing their social systems

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:20.120
 to prevent certain types of problems.

1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:22.200
 So what are the problems that they're worried about?

1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.360
 And so there are some cultures that are much more

1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:28.400
 hierarchical and some cultures that are,

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:30.520
 you know, much more egalitarian.

1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.380
 There are some cultures that, you know,

1:15:32.380 --> 1:15:35.700
 in the debate of like getting along versus getting ahead,

1:15:35.700 --> 1:15:38.640
 there are some cultures that really prioritize

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.100
 the individual over the group.

1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:41.880
 And there are other cultures that really prioritize

1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:43.300
 the group over the individual.

1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:45.340
 You know, it's not like one of these is right

1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:47.880
 and one of these is wrong, it's that, you know,

1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:49.600
 different combinations of these features

1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:52.960
 are different solutions that humans have come up with

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:55.600
 for living in groups,

1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:58.280
 which is a major adaptive advantage of our species.

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.640
 And it's not the case that one of these is better

1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:03.840
 and one of these is worse.

1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:07.320
 Although as a person, of course, I have opinions about that.

1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:10.600
 And as a person, I can say,

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:14.000
 I would very much prefer certain, I have certain beliefs

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.680
 and I really want everyone in the world

1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.360
 to live by those beliefs, you know.

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:21.360
 But as a scientist, I know that it's not really the case

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:24.200
 that for the species,

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:26.920
 any one of these is better than any other.

1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:29.920
 There are different solutions that work differentially well

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:34.920
 in particular, you know, ecological parts of the world.

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.180
 But for individual humans,

1:16:39.180 --> 1:16:42.120
 there are definitely some systems that are better

1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:43.840
 and some systems that are worse, right?

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.820
 But when anthropologists or when neuroscientists

1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:48.360
 or biologists are talking,

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:50.460
 they're not usually talking about the lives

1:16:50.460 --> 1:16:52.040
 of individual people,

1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:54.400
 they're talking about, you know, the species,

1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:55.640
 what's better for the species,

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:57.360
 the survivability of the species.

1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:59.960
 And what's better for the survivability of the species

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.640
 is variation,

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:03.680
 that we have lots of cultures

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:05.800
 with lots of different solutions

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:09.880
 because if the environment were to change drastically,

1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:14.880
 some of those solutions will work better than others.

1:17:17.580 --> 1:17:21.500
 And you can see that happening with COVID.

1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:23.780
 Right, so some people might be more susceptible

1:17:23.780 --> 1:17:26.220
 to this virus than others.

1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:28.380
 And so variation is very useful.

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:32.020
 Say COVID was much, much more destructive than it is.

1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:36.020
 And like, I don't know, 20% of the population died.

1:17:36.020 --> 1:17:40.180
 So, you know, it's good to have variability

1:17:40.180 --> 1:17:42.860
 because then at least some percent will survive.

1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:46.540
 Yeah, I mean, the way that I used to describe it

1:17:46.540 --> 1:17:51.300
 was, you know, using, you know, those movies

1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:55.180
 like the War of the Worlds or Pacific Rim,

1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:58.360
 you know, where like aliens come down from outer space

1:17:58.360 --> 1:18:01.220
 and they, you know, wanna kill humans.

1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:04.560
 And so all the humans band together as a species

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:06.500
 and they all, like all the, you know,

1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:08.900
 little squabbling from countries and whatever

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:10.460
 all, you know, goes away

1:18:10.460 --> 1:18:13.340
 and everyone is just one big, you know.

1:18:13.340 --> 1:18:18.340
 Well, that, you know, that doesn't happen.

1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:21.980
 I mean, cause COVID is, you know,

1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:26.980
 a virus like COVID 19 is like a creature from outer space.

1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:31.780
 And that's not what you see happening.

1:18:31.780 --> 1:18:33.260
 What you do see happening,

1:18:33.260 --> 1:18:35.580
 it is true that some people, I mean,

1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:37.860
 we could use this as an example of essentialism also.

1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:41.240
 So just to say, like exposure to the virus does not mean

1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:45.020
 that you will become infected with a disease.

1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.200
 So, I mean, in controlled studies,

1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:51.540
 one of which was actually a coronavirus, not COVID,

1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:55.140
 but this was, these are studies from 10 or so years ago,

1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:59.460
 you know, only somewhere between 20 and 40% of people

1:18:59.460 --> 1:19:02.180
 were developed respiratory illness

1:19:02.180 --> 1:19:04.680
 when a virus was placed in their nose.

1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:07.140
 And so.

1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:09.060
 And there's a dose question, all those.

1:19:09.060 --> 1:19:10.660
 Well, not in these studies, actually.

1:19:10.660 --> 1:19:11.580
 So in these studies,

1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:14.400
 the dose was consistent across all people

1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:16.780
 and everything, you know,

1:19:16.780 --> 1:19:18.820
 they were sequestered in hotel rooms

1:19:18.820 --> 1:19:21.380
 and what they ate was, you know,

1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:23.220
 measured out by scientists and so on.

1:19:23.220 --> 1:19:25.620
 And so when you hold dose, I mean,

1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:27.980
 the dose issue is a real issue in the real world,

1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:32.460
 but in these studies, that was controlled.

1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:34.580
 And only somewhere between 20,

1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:35.420
 depending on the study,

1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:38.700
 between 20 and 40% of people became infected with a disease.

1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:43.340
 So exposure to a virus doesn't mean de facto

1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:46.340
 that you will develop an illness.

1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:47.660
 You will be a carrier

1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:50.220
 and you will spread the virus to other people,

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:52.540
 but you yourself may not,

1:19:52.540 --> 1:19:55.820
 your immune system may be in a state

1:19:55.820 --> 1:19:58.740
 that you can make enough antibodies

1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:03.500
 to not show symptoms, not develop symptoms.

1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:08.340
 And so, of course, what this means is,

1:20:08.340 --> 1:20:10.380
 again, is that, you know,

1:20:10.380 --> 1:20:12.700
 like if I asked you, do you think, you know,

1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:17.460
 a virus is the cause of a common cold or,

1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:19.780
 you know, most people, if I asked this question,

1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:21.760
 I can tell you, because I asked this question.

1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:25.780
 So do you think a virus is the cause of a cold?

1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.780
 Most people would say, yes, I think it is.

1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:28.620
 And then I say, yeah, well,

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:32.620
 only 20 to 40% of people develop respiratory illness

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:34.300
 in exposure to a virus.

1:20:34.300 --> 1:20:38.020
 So clearly it is a necessary cause,

1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:39.660
 but it's not a sufficient cause.

1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:41.060
 And there are other causes, again,

1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:44.100
 so not simple single causes for things, right?

1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:47.540
 Multiple interacting influences.

1:20:47.540 --> 1:20:50.420
 So it is true that individuals vary

1:20:50.420 --> 1:20:53.560
 in their susceptibility to illness upon exposure,

1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:57.900
 but different cultures have different sets of norms

1:20:57.900 --> 1:21:01.300
 and practices that allow,

1:21:01.300 --> 1:21:04.720
 that will slow or speed the spread.

1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:08.820
 And that's the point that I was actually trying to make here

1:21:08.820 --> 1:21:13.820
 that, you know, when the environment changes,

1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:18.720
 that is, there's a mutation of a virus

1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:21.620
 that is incredibly infectious,

1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:25.540
 some cultures will succumb,

1:21:25.540 --> 1:21:27.600
 people in some cultures will succumb faster

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:32.380
 because of the particular norms and practices

1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:35.600
 that they've developed in their culture

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:36.560
 versus other cultures.

1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:40.540
 Now, there could be some other, you know,

1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:45.240
 thing that changes that where those other cultures

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.420
 or, you know, would do better.

1:21:46.420 --> 1:21:49.780
 So very individualistic cultures like ours

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:53.840
 may do much better under other types of selection pressures.

1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:57.460
 But for COVID, for things like COVID,

1:21:57.460 --> 1:22:00.000
 you know, my colleague Michelle Gelfant,

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:03.960
 her research shows that she looks at like loose cultures

1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:04.800
 and tight cultures,

1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:08.160
 so cultures that have very, very strict rules

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.440
 versus cultures that are much more individualistic

1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:14.220
 and where personal freedoms are more valued.

1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:18.100
 And she, you know, her research suggests that

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:22.100
 for pandemic circumstances, tight cultures actually,

1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:23.480
 the people survive better.

1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:27.180
 Just to linger a little bit longer,

1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:30.620
 we started this part of the conversation talking about,

1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:33.360
 you know, did humans evolve to think,

1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:36.020
 did the human brain evolve to think,

1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:39.460
 implying is there like a progress to the thing

1:22:39.460 --> 1:22:41.380
 that's always improving?

1:22:41.380 --> 1:22:43.600
 That's right, we never, yeah,

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:46.060
 and so the answer is no.

1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:47.860
 But let me sort of push back,

1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:51.020
 but so your intuition is very strong here,

1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:54.000
 not your intuition, the way you describe this,

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.540
 but is it possible there's a direction to this evolution?

1:22:58.540 --> 1:23:01.920
 Like, do you think of this evolution as having a direction?

1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:04.620
 Like it's like walking along a certain path

1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:06.540
 towards something?

1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:08.980
 Is it, you know, what is it?

1:23:12.140 --> 1:23:16.700
 Is it Elon Musk said like the Earth got bombarded

1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:20.700
 with photons and then all of a sudden,

1:23:20.700 --> 1:23:23.180
 like a Tesla was launched into space or whatever,

1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:24.420
 a rocket started coming?

1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:26.780
 Like, is there a sense in which,

1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:30.780
 even though in the, like within the system,

1:23:30.780 --> 1:23:33.140
 the evolution seems to be this mess of variation,

1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:35.980
 we're kind of trying to find our niches and so on,

1:23:35.980 --> 1:23:38.780
 but do you think there, ultimately, when you zoom out,

1:23:38.780 --> 1:23:40.860
 there is a direction that's strong,

1:23:40.860 --> 1:23:45.860
 that does tend towards greater complexity and intelligence?

1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:50.080
 No.

1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:54.900
 So, I mean, and again, what I would say is I'm really,

1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:58.220
 I'm really just echoing people who are much smarter

1:23:58.220 --> 1:24:00.060
 than I am about this.

1:24:00.060 --> 1:24:01.600
 But see, you're saying smarter.

1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.420
 I thought it doesn't, there's no,

1:24:03.420 --> 1:24:04.960
 I thought there's no smarter.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.180
 No, I didn't say there's no smarter.

1:24:06.180 --> 1:24:08.060
 I said there's no direction.

1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:11.700
 So I think the thing to say, or what I understand

1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:15.360
 to be the case, is that there's variation.

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:17.380
 It's not unbounded variation.

1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:18.780
 And there are selectors.

1:24:18.780 --> 1:24:22.540
 There are pressures that will select.

1:24:22.540 --> 1:24:25.300
 And so not anything is possible

1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:26.860
 because we live on a planet

1:24:26.860 --> 1:24:30.220
 that has certain physical realities to it, right?

1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:32.620
 But those physical realities

1:24:32.620 --> 1:24:37.620
 are what constrain the possibilities, the physical realities

1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:42.140
 of our genes and the physical realities

1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:45.620
 of our corporeal bodies and the physical realities

1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:50.620
 of life on this planet.

1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:56.060
 So what I would say is that there's no direction,

1:24:56.060 --> 1:25:01.060
 but there is, it's not infinite possibility

1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:07.020
 because we live on a particular planet

1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:10.220
 that has particular statistical regularities in it,

1:25:10.220 --> 1:25:12.380
 and some things will never happen.

1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:15.940
 And so all of those things are interacting

1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:20.880
 with our genes and so on,

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.800
 and the physical nature of our bodies

1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:25.480
 to make some things more possible

1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:26.740
 and some things less possible.

1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:29.340
 Look, I mean, humans have very complex brains,

1:25:29.340 --> 1:25:31.060
 but birds have complex brains,

1:25:31.060 --> 1:25:36.060
 and so do octopuses have very complex brains.

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:40.680
 And all three sets of all three of those brains

1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:43.520
 are somewhat different from one another.

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:47.320
 Some birds have very complex brains.

1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:48.820
 Some even have rudimentary language.

1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:51.140
 They have no cerebral cortex.

1:25:51.140 --> 1:25:53.160
 I mean, admittedly, they have,

1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:54.900
 this is now lesson two, right?

1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.580
 They have, is it lesson two or lesson one?

1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:57.420
 Let me think.

1:25:57.420 --> 1:25:58.900
 No, this is lesson one.

1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:03.900
 They have the same neurons,

1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:07.600
 the same neurons that in a human

1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:09.300
 become the cerebral cortex.

1:26:09.300 --> 1:26:10.980
 Birds have those neurons.

1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:13.660
 They just don't form themselves into a cerebral cortex.

1:26:13.660 --> 1:26:15.260
 But I mean, crows, for example,

1:26:15.260 --> 1:26:17.140
 are very sophisticated animals.

1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:19.780
 They can do a lot of the things that humans can do.

1:26:19.780 --> 1:26:22.340
 In fact, all of the things that humans do

1:26:22.340 --> 1:26:24.900
 that are very special, that seem very special,

1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:26.940
 there's at least one other animal on the planet

1:26:26.940 --> 1:26:29.040
 that can do those things too.

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:30.780
 What's special about the human brain

1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:33.060
 is that we put them all together.

1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:35.880
 So we learn from one another.

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:37.620
 We don't have to experience everything ourselves.

1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:40.740
 We can watch another animal or another human

1:26:40.740 --> 1:26:42.620
 experience something, and we can learn from that.

1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:44.060
 Well, there are many other animals

1:26:44.060 --> 1:26:45.800
 who can learn by copying.

1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:47.540
 That we communicate with each other

1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:48.620
 very, very efficiently.

1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:49.460
 We have language.

1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:51.080
 But we're not the only animals

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.900
 who are efficient communicators.

1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:54.300
 There are lots of other animals

1:26:54.300 --> 1:26:57.060
 who can efficiently communicate, like bees, for example.

1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:00.560
 We cooperate really well with one another

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:01.720
 to do grand things.

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:03.420
 But there are other animals that cooperate too.

1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:06.180
 And so every innovation that we have,

1:27:06.180 --> 1:27:07.740
 other animals have too.

1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:11.300
 What we have is we have all of those together

1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:14.900
 interwoven in this very complex dance

1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:19.900
 in a brain that is not unique exactly,

1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:24.900
 but that is, it does have some features

1:27:25.260 --> 1:27:29.900
 that make it particularly useful for us

1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:32.540
 to do all of these things,

1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:35.660
 to have all of these things intertwined.

1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:40.580
 So our brains are, actually the last time we talked,

1:27:40.580 --> 1:27:45.580
 I made a mistake because I said in my enthusiasm,

1:27:45.580 --> 1:27:50.240
 I said, you know, our brains are not larger,

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:51.600
 or relative to our bodies,

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:55.760
 our brains are not larger than other primates.

1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.760
 And that's actually not true, actually.

1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:01.500
 Our brains relative to our body size is somewhat larger.

1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:05.420
 So an ape who's not a human, that's not a human,

1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:09.720
 their brains are larger than their body sizes

1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:13.320
 than say, relative to like a smaller monkey.

1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:17.240
 And a human's brain is larger relative to its body size

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:18.080
 than a gorilla.

1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:22.100
 So that's a good approximation of your, of whatever,

1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:25.180
 of the bunch of stuff that you can shove in there.

1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:26.600
 But, well, what I was gonna say is,

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:29.560
 but our cerebral cortex is not larger

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:33.520
 than what you would expect for a brain of its size.

1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:38.520
 So relative to say an ape, like a gorilla or a chimp,

1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:43.520
 or even a mammal like a dolphin or an elephant, you know,

1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:49.620
 our brains, our cerebral cortex is as large

1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:53.900
 as you would expect it to be for a brain of our size.

1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:57.780
 So there's nothing special about our cerebral cortex.

1:28:57.780 --> 1:29:00.000
 And this is something I explain in the book,

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.080
 where I say, okay, you know, like by analogy,

1:29:04.020 --> 1:29:05.400
 if you walk into somebody's house

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:08.100
 and you see that they have a huge kitchen,

1:29:08.100 --> 1:29:11.620
 you might think, well, maybe this is a place

1:29:11.620 --> 1:29:13.740
 I really definitely wanna eat dinner at

1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:16.660
 because these people must be gourmet cooks.

1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:17.500
 But you don't know anything

1:29:17.500 --> 1:29:19.180
 about what the size of their kitchen means

1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:20.800
 unless you consider it in relation

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:23.100
 to the size of the rest of the house.

1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:26.580
 If it's a big kitchen in a really big house,

1:29:26.580 --> 1:29:29.300
 it's not telling you anything special, right?

1:29:29.300 --> 1:29:31.960
 If it's a big kitchen in a small house,

1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:33.900
 then that might be a place that you wanna eat for,

1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:36.740
 you wanna stay for dinner because it's more likely

1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:39.380
 that that kitchen is large for a special reason.

1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:43.660
 And so the cerebral cortex of a human brain

1:29:43.660 --> 1:29:48.540
 isn't in and of itself special because of its size.

1:29:48.540 --> 1:29:53.540
 However, there are some genetic changes

1:29:53.700 --> 1:29:58.020
 that have happened in the human brain as it's grown

1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:04.200
 to whatever size is typical for the whole brain size, right?

1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:07.660
 There are some changes that do give the human brain

1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:12.460
 slightly more of some capacities.

1:30:12.460 --> 1:30:17.340
 They're not special, but we can do some things

1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:21.620
 much better than other animals.

1:30:21.620 --> 1:30:24.740
 And correspondingly, other animals can do some things

1:30:24.740 --> 1:30:25.780
 much better than we can.

1:30:25.780 --> 1:30:27.000
 We can't grow back limbs,

1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.020
 we can't lift 50 times our own body weight.

1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:30.040
 Well, I mean, maybe you can,

1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:31.860
 but I can't lift 50 times my own body weight.

1:30:31.860 --> 1:30:34.140
 Ants with that regard are very impressive.

1:30:34.140 --> 1:30:36.900
 And then you're saying with the frontal cortex,

1:30:36.900 --> 1:30:40.780
 like that's the size is not always the right measure

1:30:40.780 --> 1:30:44.140
 of capability, I guess.

1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:46.540
 So size isn't everything.

1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:48.300
 Size isn't everything.

1:30:48.300 --> 1:30:49.820
 That's a quoted book.

1:30:49.820 --> 1:30:51.080
 People like it when I disagree,

1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:53.820
 so let me disagree with you on something

1:30:53.820 --> 1:30:56.380
 or just like play devil's advocate a little bit.

1:30:56.380 --> 1:30:58.620
 So you've painted a really nice picture

1:30:58.620 --> 1:31:03.620
 that evolution doesn't have a direction, but is it possible

1:31:03.900 --> 1:31:06.380
 if we just ran Earth over and over again,

1:31:06.380 --> 1:31:08.640
 like this video game,

1:31:08.640 --> 1:31:11.820
 that the final result will be the same.

1:31:11.820 --> 1:31:14.140
 So in the sense that we're,

1:31:14.140 --> 1:31:17.220
 eventually there'll be an AGI type,

1:31:17.220 --> 1:31:19.980
 HAL 9000 type system that just like flies

1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:24.980
 and colonizes nearby Earth like planets.

1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:26.900
 And it's always will be the same.

1:31:26.900 --> 1:31:29.040
 And the different organisms

1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:31.620
 and the different evolution of the brain,

1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:35.180
 like it doesn't feel like it has like a direction,

1:31:35.180 --> 1:31:37.380
 but given the constraints of Earth

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:40.640
 and whatever this imperative,

1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:43.260
 whatever the hell is running this universe,

1:31:43.260 --> 1:31:47.760
 like it seems like it's running towards something,

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:49.940
 is it possible that it will always be the same?

1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:51.800
 Thereby it will be a direction.

1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:56.800
 Yeah, I think as you know better than anyone else

1:31:57.640 --> 1:31:59.280
 that the answer to that question is,

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:03.000
 of course there's some probability that could happen, right?

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.320
 It's not a yes or no answer.

1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:07.580
 It's what's the probability that that would happen?

1:32:07.580 --> 1:32:12.580
 And there's a whole distribution of possibilities.

1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:17.400
 So maybe we end up, what's the probability we end up

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:21.600
 with exactly the same compliment of creatures,

1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:22.680
 including us?

1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:24.560
 What's the likelihood that we end up with

1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:29.960
 creatures that are similar to humans,

1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:33.080
 but similar in certain ways, let's say,

1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:35.760
 but not exactly humans or all the way

1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:40.760
 to a completely different distribution of creatures.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:42.320
 What's the intuition?

1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:43.880
 Like if you were to bet money,

1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:45.440
 what does that distribution look like

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:47.320
 if we ran Earth over and over and over again?

1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:51.200
 I would say given the, you're now asking me questions that.

1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:52.240
 This is not science.

1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:53.440
 This is not science.

1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:54.640
 But I would say, okay, well,

1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:59.000
 what's the probability that it's gonna be a carbon life form?

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.680
 Probably high.

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:03.920
 But that's because I don't know anything about really.

1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:07.880
 Yeah, I'm not really well versed that.

1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:09.360
 What's the probability that,

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:12.120
 so what's the probability that the animals will begin

1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:14.720
 in the ocean and crawl out onto land?

1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:15.560
 Versus the other way.

1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:18.240
 Versus the, I would say probably high.

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:20.120
 I don't know.

1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:22.760
 You know, but do I think what's the likelihood

1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:26.720
 that we would end up with exactly the same or very similar?

1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:28.640
 I think it's low actually.

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:32.120
 I wouldn't say it's low, but I would say it's not 100%.

1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:34.520
 And I'm not even sure it's 50%.

1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:36.400
 You know, I would say,

1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:38.960
 I don't think that we're here by accident

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:41.680
 because I think, like I said, there are constraints.

1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:44.760
 Like there are some physical constraints about Earth.

1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:46.560
 Now, of course, if you were a cosmologist,

1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:49.200
 you could say, well, the fact that the Earth is,

1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:51.280
 if you were to do the Big Bang over again

1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:53.040
 and keep doing it over and over and over again,

1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:56.360
 would you still get the same solar systems?

1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:58.240
 Would you still get the same planets?

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:00.840
 Would, you know, would you still get the same galaxies,

1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:02.800
 the same solar systems, the same planets?

1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:05.800
 You know, I don't know, but my guess is probably not

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:08.520
 because there are random things that happen

1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:12.600
 that can, again, send things in one direct, you know,

1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:14.520
 make one set of trajectories possible

1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:15.880
 and another set impossible.

1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:20.880
 So, but I guess my, if I were gonna bet money

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.080
 or something valuable, I would probably say,

1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:31.480
 it's not zero and it's not 100%

1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:33.280
 and it's probably not even 50%.

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:34.680
 So there's some probability, but I don't know.

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:35.520
 That it will be similar.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:37.320
 That it will be similar, but I don't think,

1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:40.560
 I just think there are too many degrees of freedom.

1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:42.840
 There are too many degrees of freedom.

1:34:42.840 --> 1:34:47.680
 I mean, one of the real tensions in writing this book

1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:52.680
 is to, on the one hand, there's some truth in saying

1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:57.720
 that humans are not special.

1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:00.760
 We are just, you know,

1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:03.040
 we're not special in the animal kingdom.

1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.160
 All animals are well adapted.

1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:11.120
 If they're survived, they're well adapted to their niche.

1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:15.560
 It does happen to be the case that our niche is large.

1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:18.400
 For any individual human, your niche is whatever it is.

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:20.080
 But for the species, right?

1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:23.360
 We live almost everywhere, not everywhere,

1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:28.360
 but almost everywhere on the planet, but not in the ocean.

1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:32.360
 And actually other animals like bacteria, for example,

1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:35.600
 have us beat miles, you know, hands down, right?

1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.400
 So we're, by any definition,

1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:41.760
 we're not special.

1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:46.720
 We're just, you know, adapted to our environment.

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:48.360
 But bacteria don't have a podcast.

1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:50.320
 Exactly, exactly.

1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:53.080
 And so that's the other, so that's the tension, right?

1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.320
 So on the one hand, you know, we're not special animals.

1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:56.920
 We're just, you know,

1:35:56.920 --> 1:35:58.240
 particularly well adapted to our niche.

1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:00.040
 On the other hand, our niche is huge.

1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:03.080
 And we, you know, we don't just adapt to our environment.

1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:04.760
 We add to our environment.

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.920
 We make stuff up, give it a name,

1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:08.480
 and then it becomes real.

1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:10.800
 And so no other animal can do that.

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:13.440
 And so I think the thing,

1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:15.360
 the way to think about it from my perspective

1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:17.920
 or the way I made sense of it is to say,

1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:21.840
 you can look at any individual single characteristic

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:26.440
 that a human has that seems remarkable.

1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:28.680
 And you can find that in some other animal.

1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:33.840
 What you can't find in any other animal

1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:37.280
 is all of those characteristics together

1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:42.280
 in a brain that is souped up in particular ways,

1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:44.440
 like ours is.

1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:46.360
 And if you combine these things,

1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.840
 multiple interacting causes, right?

1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:53.720
 Not one essence, like your cortex, your big neocortex,

1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:56.160
 but which isn't really that big.

1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:59.840
 I mean, it's just big for your big brain,

1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:01.200
 for the size of your big brain.

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:02.840
 It's the size it should be.

1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:05.960
 If you add all those things together

1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:07.320
 and they interact with each other,

1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:10.040
 that produces some pretty remarkable results.

1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:13.080
 And if you're aware of that,

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:19.160
 then you can start asking different kinds of questions

1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:22.560
 about what it means to be human

1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:25.120
 and what kind of a human you wanna be

1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:28.760
 and what kind of a world do you wanna curate

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.040
 for the next generation of humans.

1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:33.720
 I think that's the goal anyways, right?

1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:36.200
 Is just to have a glimpse of,

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.920
 instead of thinking about things in a simple linear way,

1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:45.760
 just to have a glimpse of some of the things that matter,

1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:49.040
 that evidence suggests matters

1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:54.040
 to the kind of brain in the kind of bodies that we have.

1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.720
 Once you know that, you can work with it a little bit.

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:02.040
 You write, words have power over your biology.

1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:04.160
 Right now, I can text the words,

1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:06.400
 I love you from the United States

1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:08.480
 to my close friend in Belgium.

1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:12.000
 And even though she cannot hear my voice or see my face,

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000
 I will change her heart rate, her breathing

1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.640
 and her metabolism.

1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:18.200
 By the way, beautifully written.

1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:22.040
 Or someone could text something ambiguous to you,

1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:24.680
 like, is your door locked?

1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:27.360
 And odds are that it would affect your nervous system

1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:29.480
 in an unpleasant way.

1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:33.000
 So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff to talk about here,

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.960
 but just one way to ask is,

1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.240
 why do you think words have so much power over our brain?

1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:46.200
 Well, I think we just have to look at the anatomy

1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:48.160
 of the brain to answer that question.

1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:52.640
 So, if you look at the parts of the brain,

1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:57.640
 the systems that are important for processing language,

1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:01.640
 you can see that some of these regions

1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:03.560
 are also important for controlling

1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:05.160
 your major organ systems.

1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:07.160
 And like your autonomic nervous system,

1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:09.600
 that controls your cardiovascular system,

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:12.240
 your respiratory system, and so on.

1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:17.240
 That these regions control your endocrine system,

1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:20.240
 your immune system, and so on.

1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:22.800
 So, and you can actually see this in other animals too.

1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:24.760
 So in birds, for example,

1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.080
 the neurons that are responsible for birdsong

1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:30.840
 also control the systems of a bird's body.

1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:33.640
 And the reason why I bring that up is that the,

1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:38.640
 there's some scientists think that the anatomy

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:42.000
 of a bird's brain that control birdsong

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.760
 are homologous or structurally have a similar origin

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:48.360
 to the human system for language.

1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:51.000
 So, the parts of the brain that are important

1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.240
 for processing language are not unique

1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:57.560
 in, and specialized for language.

1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:59.160
 They do many things.

1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:01.760
 And one of the things they do is control

1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:03.680
 your major organ systems.

1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.240
 Do you think we can fall in love,

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:07.840
 I have arguments about this all the time.

1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:10.560
 Do you think we can fall in love based on words alone?

1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:14.000
 Well, I think people have been doing it for centuries.

1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.480
 I mean, maybe it used to be the case

1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.520
 that people wrote letters to each other,

1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:22.160
 you know, and then that was how they communicated.

1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:24.160
 I guess that's how you and Dan got it.

1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:26.400
 Exactly, exactly, exactly.

1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:28.040
 Yeah, exactly.

1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:31.120
 So is the answer a clear yes there?

1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:34.040
 Because I get a lot of pushback from people often

1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:37.840
 that you need the touch and the smell

1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:42.120
 and, you know, the bodily stuff.

1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:45.560
 I think the touch and the smell and the bodily stuff helps.

1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:46.400
 Okay.

1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:47.880
 But I don't think it's necessary.

1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:51.920
 Do you think you can have a lifelong monogamous relationship

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:54.560
 with an AI system that only communicates

1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:56.800
 with you on text, romantic relationship?

1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:00.800
 Well, I suppose that's an empirical question

1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:02.080
 that hasn't been answered yet.

1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:04.880
 But I guess what I would say is

1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:09.280
 I don't think I could.

1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:12.680
 Could any human?

1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:14.400
 Could the average human?

1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:18.000
 Could, you know, so if I,

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.000
 if I even, I wanna even modify that and say,

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:30.520
 I'm thinking now of Tom Hanks and the movie.

1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:31.920
 Castaway?

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:33.280
 Yeah, you know, with Wilson.

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:34.120
 Yeah.

1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:37.440
 I think if that was, if you had to make that work,

1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.040
 if you had to make that work.

1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:40.400
 With a volleyball, yeah.

1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:43.160
 If you had to make it work, could you,

1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:45.280
 could you, prediction and simulation, right?

1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:49.480
 So if you had to make it work, could you make it work?

1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:53.400
 Using simulation and, you know, your past experience,

1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:54.560
 could you make it work?

1:41:56.280 --> 1:41:57.120
 Could you make it work?

1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.800
 You as a human, could you, could you like?

1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.920
 Could you have a relationship literally

1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:04.640
 with an inanimate object and have it sustain you

1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:07.760
 in the way that another human could?

1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:11.000
 Your life would probably be shorter

1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.920
 because you wouldn't actually derive

1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:15.400
 the body budgeting benefits from, right?

1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:20.400
 So we've talked about, you know, how your brain,

1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:24.200
 its most important job is to control your body

1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:27.080
 and you can describe that as your brain running a budget

1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:31.840
 for your body and there are metaphorical, you know,

1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:34.640
 deposits and withdrawals into your body budget

1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:37.400
 and you also make deposits and withdrawals

1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:40.360
 in other people's body budgets, figuratively speaking.

1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.800
 So you wouldn't have that particular benefit.

1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:48.280
 So your life would probably be shorter

1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.040
 but I think it would be harder for some people

1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:52.360
 than for other people.

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.320
 Yeah, I tend to, my intuition is that you can have

1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:57.860
 a deep fulfilling relationship with a volleyball.

1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:03.560
 I think, I think a lot of the, the environments

1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:05.440
 that set up, I think that's a really good example.

1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:10.440
 Like the constraints of your particular environment

1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:16.200
 define the, like I believe like scarcity is a good catalyst

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:20.000
 for deep, meaningful connection with other humans

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000
 and with inanimate objects.

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.680
 So the less you have, the more fulfilling

1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:25.880
 those relationships are.

1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:29.240
 And I would say a relationship with a volleyball,

1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:31.640
 the sex is not great but everything else,

1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:34.640
 I feel like it could be a very fulfilling relationship

1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:37.240
 which I don't know from an engineering perspective

1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:38.760
 what to do with that.

1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:41.520
 And just like you said, it is an empirical question but.

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:43.560
 But there are places to learn about that, right?

1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.140
 So for example, think about children and their blankets.

1:43:49.100 --> 1:43:51.220
 Right, so there, there's something tactile

1:43:51.220 --> 1:43:55.340
 and there's something olfactory and it's very comforting.

1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:00.180
 I mean, even for, even for nonhuman little animals, right?

1:44:00.180 --> 1:44:04.480
 Like puppies and so I don't know about cats but, but.

1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:07.600
 Cats are cold hearted, there's no,

1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:08.800
 there's nothing going on there.

1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:12.000
 I don't know, there are some cats that are very doglike.

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.040
 I mean, really, so.

1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:15.800
 Some cats identify as dogs, yes.

1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:19.100
 I think that's true, yeah, they're species fluid.

1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:26.120
 So you also write, when it comes to human minds,

1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:28.080
 variation is the norm.

1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:30.400
 And what we call quote, human nature

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:32.740
 is really many human natures.

1:44:32.740 --> 1:44:36.260
 So again, many questions I can ask here.

1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:41.260
 But maybe an interesting one to ask is I often hear,

1:44:41.620 --> 1:44:43.780
 we often hear this idea of be yourself.

1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:48.120
 Is this possible to be yourself?

1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.500
 Is it a good idea to strive to be yourself?

1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:54.460
 Is it, does that even have any meaning?

1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:57.320
 It's a very Western question, first of all,

1:44:57.320 --> 1:44:59.500
 because which self are you talking about?

1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:01.860
 You don't have one self.

1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:04.540
 There is no self that's an essence of you.

1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:05.960
 You have multiple selves.

1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:08.360
 Actually, there is research on this.

1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:13.300
 To quote the great social psychologist, Hazel Marcus,

1:45:13.300 --> 1:45:15.880
 you're never, you cannot be a self by yourself.

1:45:18.700 --> 1:45:22.000
 And so different contexts pull for

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.820
 or draw on different features of who you are

1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:31.820
 or what you believe, what you feel, what your actions are.

1:45:32.020 --> 1:45:35.100
 A different context will put certain things,

1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:38.060
 make some features be more in the foreground

1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:39.820
 and some in the background.

1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:42.060
 It takes us back right to our discussion earlier

1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:46.060
 about Stalin and Hitler and so on.

1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:48.500
 The thing that I would caution,

1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:51.660
 in addition to the fact that there is no single self,

1:45:51.660 --> 1:45:54.300
 that you have multiple selves, who you can be,

1:45:54.300 --> 1:45:59.040
 and you can certainly choose the situations

1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:01.200
 that you put yourself in to some extent.

1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:02.860
 Not everybody has complete choice,

1:46:02.860 --> 1:46:04.440
 but everybody has a little bit of choice.

1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:06.400
 And I think I said this to you before,

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:10.600
 that one of the pieces of advice that we gave Sophia

1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:11.920
 when she went, our daughter,

1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:13.280
 when she was going off to college,

1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:18.280
 was try to spend time around people,

1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:21.240
 choose relationships that allow you to be your best self.

1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:26.240
 We should have said your best selves, but, you know.

1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:31.600
 The pool of selves given the environment.

1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:34.080
 Yeah, but the one thing I do wanna say

1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:38.320
 is that the risk of saying be yourself, just be yourself,

1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:42.440
 is that that can be used as an excuse.

1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:45.540
 Well, this is just the way that I am, I'm just like this.

1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:50.540
 And that, I think, should be tremendously resisted.

1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:54.360
 So that's one, that's for the excuse side,

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.640
 but, you know, I'm really self critical often,

1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:00.600
 I'm full of doubt, and people often tell me,

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:04.120
 just don't worry about it, just be yourself, man.

1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:07.520
 And it's, the thing is, it almost,

1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:09.880
 it's not, from an engineering perspective,

1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:12.480
 does not seem like actionable advice.

1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:17.480
 Because, I guess, constantly worrying about who,

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:24.080
 what are the right words to say

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:29.080
 to express how I'm feeling is, I guess, myself.

1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:32.020
 There's a kind of line, I guess,

1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:34.520
 that this might be a Western idea,

1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:37.560
 but something that feels genuine

1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:39.380
 and something that feels non genuine.

1:47:39.380 --> 1:47:42.620
 And I'm not sure what that means,

1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:45.820
 because I would like to be fully genuine and fully open,

1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:49.180
 but I'm also aware, like this morning,

1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:52.220
 I was very silly and giddy, I was like,

1:47:52.220 --> 1:47:57.220
 this is just being funny and relaxed and light,

1:47:57.300 --> 1:48:01.140
 like there's nothing that could bother me in the world,

1:48:01.140 --> 1:48:02.700
 I was just smiling and happy.

1:48:02.700 --> 1:48:04.100
 And then I remember last night,

1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:05.980
 was just feeling very grumpy,

1:48:05.980 --> 1:48:09.100
 like stuff was bothering me.

1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:10.780
 Like certain things were bothering me.

1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:12.660
 And like, what are those?

1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:14.500
 Are those different selves?

1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:16.940
 Like what, who am I in that?

1:48:16.940 --> 1:48:17.780
 And what do I do?

1:48:17.780 --> 1:48:20.520
 Because if we take Twitter as an example,

1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:23.220
 if I actually send a tweet last night

1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:24.340
 and a tweet this morning,

1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:28.900
 it's gonna be very two different people tweeting that.

1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:30.560
 And I don't know what to do with that,

1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:34.980
 because one does seem to be more me than the other,

1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:38.280
 but that's maybe because there's a story that I'm trying,

1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:40.460
 there's something I'm striving to be,

1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:43.200
 like the ultimate human that I might become,

1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:44.580
 I have maybe a vision of that,

1:48:44.580 --> 1:48:46.460
 and I'm trying to become that.

1:48:46.460 --> 1:48:48.960
 But it does seem like there's a lot

1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:50.420
 of different minds in there.

1:48:51.300 --> 1:48:54.460
 And they're all like having a discussion

1:48:54.460 --> 1:48:56.780
 and a battle for who's gonna win.

1:48:56.780 --> 1:48:58.180
 I suppose you could think of it that way,

1:48:58.180 --> 1:49:00.140
 but there's another way to think of it, I think,

1:49:00.140 --> 1:49:03.740
 and that is that maybe the more Buddhist way to think of it,

1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:05.740
 right, or a more contemplative way to think about it,

1:49:05.740 --> 1:49:08.800
 which is not that you have multiple personalities

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:11.820
 inside your head, but you have,

1:49:11.820 --> 1:49:16.820
 your brain has this amazing capacity.

1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:23.940
 It has a population of experiences that you've had

1:49:24.580 --> 1:49:27.820
 that it can regenerate, reconstitute.

1:49:27.820 --> 1:49:32.700
 And it can even take bits and pieces of those experiences

1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:35.940
 and combine them into something new.

1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:39.180
 And it's often doing this to predict

1:49:39.180 --> 1:49:42.240
 what's going to happen next and to plan your actions,

1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.340
 but it's also happening, this also happens just,

1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:47.860
 that's what mind wandering is,

1:49:47.860 --> 1:49:50.240
 or just internal thought and so on.

1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:52.300
 It's the same mechanism, really.

1:49:52.300 --> 1:49:57.060
 And so a lot of times we hear the saying,

1:49:57.060 --> 1:49:58.860
 just think, if you think differently,

1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:00.860
 you'll feel differently.

1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:04.900
 But your brain is having a conversation continually

1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:08.100
 with your body, and your body,

1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:10.660
 your brain's trying to control your body,

1:50:10.660 --> 1:50:13.020
 well, trying, your brain is controlling your body,

1:50:13.020 --> 1:50:16.140
 your body is sending information back to the brain,

1:50:16.140 --> 1:50:19.780
 and in part, the information that your body sends back

1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:23.620
 to your brain, just like the information

1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:27.780
 coming from the world, initiates the next volley

1:50:27.780 --> 1:50:30.300
 of predictions or simulations.

1:50:30.300 --> 1:50:32.340
 So in some ways, you could also say,

1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:37.300
 the way that you feel, I think we talked before

1:50:37.300 --> 1:50:40.220
 about affective feeling or mood,

1:50:40.220 --> 1:50:43.260
 coming from the sensations of body budgeting,

1:50:46.060 --> 1:50:48.960
 influences what you think.

1:50:50.300 --> 1:50:54.840
 And as much as, so feelings influence thought,

1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:58.740
 as much as thought influence feeling, and maybe more.

1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:01.460
 But just the whole thing doesn't seem stable.

1:51:01.460 --> 1:51:05.480
 Well, it's a dynamic system, Mr. Engineer, right?

1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:07.740
 It's a dynamic, it's a dynamical system, right?

1:51:07.740 --> 1:51:09.380
 Nonlinear dynamical system.

1:51:09.380 --> 1:51:11.780
 And I think that's, I'm actually writing a paper

1:51:11.780 --> 1:51:14.980
 with a bunch of engineers about this actually.

1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:17.540
 But I mean, other people have talked about the brain

1:51:17.540 --> 1:51:18.860
 as a dynamical system before,

1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:22.260
 but the real tricky bit is trying to figure out

1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:24.900
 how do you get mental features out of that system?

1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:26.220
 I guess one thing to figure out how you get

1:51:26.220 --> 1:51:27.760
 a motor movement out of that system,

1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:28.940
 it's another thing to figure out

1:51:28.940 --> 1:51:30.380
 how you get a mental feature,

1:51:30.380 --> 1:51:32.900
 like a feeling of being loved

1:51:32.900 --> 1:51:34.860
 or a feeling of being worthwhile,

1:51:34.860 --> 1:51:38.620
 or a feeling of just basically feeling like shit.

1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:39.740
 How do you get a feeling,

1:51:39.740 --> 1:51:42.860
 a mental features out of that system?

1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:48.020
 So what I would say is that you aren't,

1:51:48.020 --> 1:51:50.780
 the Buddhist thing to say is that you're not one person

1:51:50.780 --> 1:51:52.300
 and you're not many people.

1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:57.300
 You are the sum of your experiences

1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:00.860
 and who you are in any given moment,

1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:05.000
 meaning what your actions will be,

1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.680
 is influenced by the state of your body

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.240
 and the state of the world that you've put yourself in.

1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:12.880
 And you can change either of those things.

1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:15.200
 One is a little easier to change than the other, right?

1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:16.640
 You can change your environment

1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:18.960
 by literally getting up and moving,

1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:21.000
 or you can change it by paying attention

1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:22.320
 to some things differently

1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:26.080
 and letting some features come to the fore

1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:28.000
 and other features be backgrounded.

1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.040
 Like I'm looking around your place.

1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:32.600
 Oh no, this is not something you should do.

1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:34.960
 No, but I'm gonna say one thing.

1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:39.640
 No green plants, no green plants.

1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:41.380
 Because green plants mean a home

1:52:41.380 --> 1:52:43.160
 and I want this to be temporary.

1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:45.880
 Fair, fair, but.

1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:48.480
 What goes to your mind when you see no green plants?

1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:53.480
 No, I'm just making the point that what if you,

1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:59.280
 again, not everybody has control over their environment.

1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:01.520
 Some people don't have control over the noise

1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:04.520
 or the temperature or any of those things.

1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:07.100
 But everybody has a little bit of control

1:53:07.100 --> 1:53:10.280
 and you can place things in your environment,

1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:15.280
 photographs, plants, anything that's meaningful to you

1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:19.360
 and use it as a shift of environment when you need it.

1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:21.680
 You can also do things to change

1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:24.000
 the conditions of your body.

1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.760
 When you exercise every day,

1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:28.880
 you're making an investment in your body.

1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:31.280
 Actually, you're making an investment in your brain too.

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:33.880
 It makes you, even though it's unpleasant

1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:37.280
 and there's a cost to it, if you replenish,

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:39.680
 if you invest and you make up that,

1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:44.280
 you make a deposit and you make up what you've spent,

1:53:44.280 --> 1:53:46.320
 you're basically making an investment

1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:48.880
 in making it easier for your brain

1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:51.360
 to control your body in the future.

1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:54.600
 So you can make sure you're hydrated.

1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:55.640
 Drink water.

1:53:55.640 --> 1:53:57.040
 You don't have to drink bottled water.

1:53:57.040 --> 1:53:58.600
 You can drink water from the tap.

1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:01.680
 This is in most places, maybe not everywhere,

1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:06.280
 but most places in the developed world.

1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:09.640
 You can try to get enough sleep.

1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:11.240
 Not everybody has that luxury,

1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:16.240
 but everybody can do something to make their body budgets

1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:17.880
 a little more solvent.

1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:21.680
 And that will also make it more likely

1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:23.640
 that certain thoughts will emerge

1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:27.040
 from that prediction machine, basically.

1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:28.840
 That's the control you do have,

1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.440
 is being able to control the environment.

1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:32.440
 That's really well put.

1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:36.760
 I don't think we've talked about this,

1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:39.040
 so let's go to the biggest unanswerable questions

1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:41.360
 of consciousness.

1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:43.880
 What is, you just rolled your eyes.

1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:45.720
 I did, that was my, yeah.

1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:49.000
 So what is consciousness from a neuroscience perspective?

1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:50.160
 I know you, I mean.

1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:54.240
 I made notes, you know,

1:54:54.240 --> 1:54:56.440
 because you gave me some questions in advance

1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:58.120
 and I made notes for every single.

1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:58.960
 Oh, except that one?

1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:01.240
 Yeah, well that one I had, what the fuck?

1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:02.440
 And then I took it out.

1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.960
 So is there something interesting,

1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:07.560
 because you're so pragmatic.

1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:10.960
 Is there something interesting to say about intuition

1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:13.240
 building about consciousness?

1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:16.240
 Or is this something that we're just totally clueless about

1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.640
 that this is, let's focus on the body,

1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.120
 the brain listens to the body,

1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:24.520
 the body speaks to the brain,

1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:26.920
 and let's just figure this piece out,

1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:29.160
 and then consciousness will probably emerge somehow

1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:30.440
 after that.

1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.080
 No, I think, you know, well, first of all,

1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:35.120
 I'll just say up front,

1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:37.640
 I am not a philosopher of consciousness

1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:40.360
 and I'm not a neuroscientist who focuses on consciousness.

1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:41.880
 I mean, in some sense, I do study it

1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:44.480
 because I study affect and mood.

1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:46.520
 And that is the,

1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:50.920
 you know, to use the phrase,

1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:54.080
 that is the hard question of consciousness.

1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:57.960
 How is it that your brain is modeling your body?

1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.720
 Brain is modeling the sensory conditions of your body.

1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:03.840
 And it's being updated,

1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:06.400
 that model is being updated by the sense data

1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:07.760
 that's coming from your body

1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:10.080
 and it's happening continuously your whole life.

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.560
 And you don't feel those sensations directly.

1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:19.120
 What you feel is a general sense of pleasantness

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.120
 or unpleasantness, comfort, discomfort,

1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:22.320
 feeling worked up, feeling calm.

1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:26.360
 So we call that affect, you know, most people call it mood.

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.840
 So how is it that your brain gives you

1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.720
 this very low dimensional feeling of mood or affect

1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:35.760
 when it's presumably receiving

1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:39.120
 a very high dimensional array of sense data?

1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:42.520
 And the model that the brain is running of the body

1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:44.400
 has to be high dimensional

1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:47.680
 because there's a lot going on in there, right?

1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:49.840
 You're not aware, but as you're sitting there quietly,

1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:54.440
 as your listeners or as our viewers are sitting.

1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:56.360
 They might be working out, running now,

1:56:56.360 --> 1:56:57.880
 or as many of them write to me.

1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:58.720
 That's fair.

1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:00.160
 They're laying in bed, smoking weed

1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:01.880
 with their eyes closed.

1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.040
 That's fair, so maybe we should say that bit again then.

1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:07.800
 So if, so some people may be working out,

1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.280
 some people may be, you know, relaxing.

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:14.120
 But you know, even if you're sitting very still

1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:16.920
 while you're watching this or listening to this,

1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:19.600
 there's a whole drama going on inside your body

1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:21.400
 that you're largely unaware of.

1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:26.200
 Yet your brain makes you aware

1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:29.600
 or gives you a status report in a sense

1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:31.600
 by virtue of these mental features

1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:33.600
 of feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant,

1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:35.320
 feeling comfortable, feeling uncomfortable,

1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:38.080
 feeling energetic, feeling tired and so on.

1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.240
 And so how the hell is it doing that?

1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:46.240
 That is the basic question of consciousness.

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:49.200
 And like the status reports seem to be,

1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:52.480
 in the way we experience them, seem to be quite simple.

1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:56.560
 Like it doesn't feel like there's a lot of data.

1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:57.640
 Yeah, no, there isn't.

1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:02.640
 So when you feel, when you feel discomfort,

1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:04.840
 when you're feeling basically like shit,

1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:06.960
 you feel like shit, what does that tell you?

1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:08.360
 Like, what are you supposed to do next?

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:09.320
 What caused it?

1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:12.160
 I mean, the thing is not one thing caused it, right?

1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:15.560
 It's multiple factors probably influencing

1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:16.920
 your physical state.

1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:17.760
 Your body budget.

1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:18.600
 It's very high dimensional, yeah.

1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:20.200
 It's very high dimensional.

1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:25.200
 And there are different temporal scales of influence, right?

1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:33.000
 So the state of your gut is not just influenced

1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:34.680
 by what you ate five minutes ago.

1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:37.600
 It's also what you ate a day ago and two days ago

1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:38.480
 and so on.

1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:43.480
 So I think the, you know,

1:58:43.480 --> 1:58:48.480
 when I'm, I'm not trying to weasel out of the question,

1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:55.120
 I just think it's the hardest question actually.

1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:58.120
 Do you think we'll ever understand it as scientists?

1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:06.680
 I think that we will understand it

1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:09.720
 as well as we understand other things

1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:14.720
 like the birth of the universe or the, you know,

1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:18.200
 the nature of the universe, I guess I would say.

1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:21.920
 So do I think we can get to that level of an explanation?

1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:24.880
 I do actually, but I think that we have to start asking

1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:28.080
 somewhat different questions and approaching the science

1:59:28.080 --> 1:59:30.280
 somewhat differently than we have in the past.

1:59:30.280 --> 1:59:32.040
 I mean, it's also possible that consciousness

1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:33.600
 is much more difficult to understand

1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:35.320
 than the nature of the universe.

1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:37.680
 It is, but I wasn't necessarily saying

1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:40.800
 that it was a question that was of equivalent complexity.

1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:44.160
 I was saying that I do think that we could get

1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:49.160
 to some, I am optimistic that I would not,

1:59:51.040 --> 1:59:54.520
 I would be very willing to invest the time,

1:59:54.520 --> 1:59:57.040
 my time on this earth as a scientist

1:59:57.040 --> 1:59:58.400
 in trying to answer that question

1:59:58.400 --> 2:00:01.920
 if I could do it the way that I wanna do it,

2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:04.400
 not in the way that it's currently being done.

2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:05.600
 So like rigorously?

2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:06.960
 I don't wanna say unrigorously.

2:00:06.960 --> 2:00:09.400
 I just wanna say that there are certain set of assumptions

2:00:09.400 --> 2:00:11.720
 that, you know, scientists have

2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:13.760
 what I would call ontological commitments.

2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:16.120
 They're commitments about the way the world is

2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:18.720
 or the way that nature is.

2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:23.720
 And these commitments lead scientists sometimes blindly

2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:25.200
 without, they don't, scientists sometimes,

2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:27.000
 sometimes scientists are aware of these commitments,

2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:28.360
 but sometimes they're not.

2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:30.600
 And these commitments on the list influence

2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:34.560
 how scientists ask questions, what they measure,

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:39.560
 how they measure, and I just have very different views

2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:43.160
 than a lot of my colleagues about the ways to approach this.

2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:46.400
 Not everybody, but the way that I would approach it

2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:50.360
 would be different and it would cost more

2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:52.600
 and it would take longer.

2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:54.280
 It doesn't fit very well

2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:56.360
 into the current incentive structure of science.

2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:59.120
 And so do I think that doing science

2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:00.520
 the way science is currently done

2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:02.280
 with the budget that it currently has

2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:04.240
 and the incentive structure that it currently has

2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:05.280
 will we have an answer?

2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:06.800
 No, I think absolutely not.

2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:08.160
 Good luck is what I would say.

2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:12.520
 People love book recommendations.

2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:14.640
 Let me ask what three books.

2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:17.200
 Oh, you can't just like, you can't just give me three.

2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:18.640
 I mean, like really three?

2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:22.560
 What seven and a half books you can recommend.

2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:24.600
 So you're also the author of seven and a half lessons

2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.080
 about the brain.

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.240
 You're a author of how emotions are made.

2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:32.760
 Okay, so definitely those are the top two recommendations

2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:35.240
 of all, the two greatest books of all time.

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:38.440
 Other than that, are there books that technical,

2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:41.080
 fiction, philosophical that you've enjoyed

2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:42.720
 or you might recommend to others?

2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:46.840
 Yes, actually, you know, every PhD student

2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:50.360
 when they graduate with their PhD,

2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:52.880
 I give them a set, like a little library,

2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:54.240
 like a set of books, you know,

2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:55.920
 some of which they've already read,

2:01:55.920 --> 2:01:58.040
 some of which I want them to read or,

2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:03.040
 but I think nonfiction books, I would read,

2:02:03.520 --> 2:02:07.680
 the things I would recommend are The Triple Helix

2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:10.280
 by Richard Lewontin.

2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:14.080
 It's a little book published in 2000,

2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:17.520
 which is, I think, a really good introduction

2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:22.520
 to complexity and population thinking

2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:25.160
 as opposed to essentialism.

2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:27.200
 So this idea, essentialism is this idea

2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:29.920
 that, you know, there's an essence to each person,

2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:32.880
 whether it's a soul or your genes or what have you,

2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:35.440
 as opposed to this idea that you,

2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:38.160
 we have the kind of nature that requires a nurture.

2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:43.160
 We are, we are, you are the product of a complex dance

2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.680
 between an environment, between a set of genes

2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:52.080
 and an environment that turns those genes on and off

2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:53.920
 to produce your brain and your body

2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:56.640
 and really who you are at any given moment.

2:02:56.640 --> 2:02:59.240
 It's a good title for that, Triple Helix.

2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:02.240
 So playing on the double helix where it's just the biology,

2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:03.920
 it's bigger than the biology.

2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:05.360
 Exactly.

2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:06.240
 It's a wonderful book.

2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:08.280
 I've read it probably six or seven times

2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:09.120
 throughout the year.

2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:10.760
 He has another book too, which is,

2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:14.320
 it's more, I think scientists would find it,

2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:15.480
 I don't know, I've loved it.

2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:18.560
 It's called Biology as Ideology.

2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:20.840
 And it really is all about,

2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:22.840
 I wouldn't call it one of the best books of all time,

2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:26.800
 but I love the book because it really does point out,

2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:31.640
 you know, that science is its currently practice.

2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:33.160
 I mean, the book was written in 1991,

2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:34.920
 but it actually, I think, still holds,

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:36.960
 that science is a currently practice,

2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:38.880
 has a set of ontological commitments,

2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:40.440
 which are somewhat problematic.

2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:43.520
 So the assumptions are limiting.

2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:45.400
 Yeah, in ways that you, it's, you know,

2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.640
 it's like you're a fish in water and you don't, like,

2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:49.160
 okay, so, yeah, so here's the.

2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:50.000
 David Foster Wallace, that stuff.

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.680
 Yeah, but, you know, but here's a really cool thing

2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:55.120
 I just learned recently.

2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:57.920
 Is it okay to go off on this tangent for a minute?

2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:00.560
 Yeah, yeah, let's go tangents, great.

2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:02.600
 I was just gonna say that I just learned recently

2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:06.120
 that we don't have water receptors on our skin.

2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:07.720
 So how do you know when you're sweating?

2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:10.560
 How do you know when a raindrop,

2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:12.480
 when, you know, when it's gonna rain and, you know,

2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:13.760
 like a raindrop hits your skin

2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:16.600
 and you can feel that little drop of wetness.

2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:18.480
 How is it that you feel that drop of wetness

2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:22.280
 when we don't have water receptors in our skin?

2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:23.320
 And I was, when I.

2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:24.840
 My mind's blown already.

2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:27.200
 Yeah, that was, I have my reaction too, right?

2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:29.240
 I was like, of course we don't

2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:31.460
 because we evolved in the water.

2:04:31.460 --> 2:04:33.240
 Like, why would we need, you know, it just,

2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:35.120
 it was just this like, you know, you have these moments

2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.240
 where you're like, oh, of course, there's like a, yeah, so.

2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:40.680
 You'll never see rain the same way again.

2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:45.680
 So the answer is it's a combination of temperature

2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:49.840
 and touch, but it's a complex sense

2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:52.520
 that's only computed in your brain.

2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:54.240
 There's no receptor for it.

2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:55.320
 Anyways.

2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:58.440
 Yeah, that's why like snow versus cold rain

2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:00.520
 versus warm rain all feel different

2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:03.600
 because you're trying to infer stuff from the temperature

2:05:03.600 --> 2:05:05.840
 and the size of the droplets is fascinating.

2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:07.600
 Yeah, your brain is a prediction machine.

2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:11.000
 It's using lots and lots of information and combining it.

2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:12.160
 You know, anyway, so.

2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:17.160
 But so biology is ideology is,

2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:19.000
 I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest books of all time,

2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:22.560
 but it is a really useful book.

2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:24.280
 There's a book by,

2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:27.000
 if you're interested in psychology or the mind at all,

2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.040
 there's a wonderful book, a little,

2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:34.040
 it's a fairly small book called Naming the Mind

2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:38.540
 by Kurt Danziger, who's a historian of psychology.

2:05:38.540 --> 2:05:42.440
 Everybody in my lab reads both of these books.

2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:43.920
 So what's the book?

2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:45.520
 It's about the origin of the,

2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:49.560
 where did we get the theory of mind that we have

2:05:49.560 --> 2:05:53.440
 that the human mind is populated by thoughts and feelings

2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:57.800
 and perceptions and where did those categories come from?

2:05:57.800 --> 2:06:00.520
 Because they don't exist in all cultures.

2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:05.940
 Oh, so this isn't, that's a cultural construct?

2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:08.040
 The idea that you have thoughts and feelings

2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:11.280
 and they're very distinct is definitely a cultural construct.

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:15.000
 That's another mind blowing thing, just like the rain.

2:06:16.180 --> 2:06:18.540
 So Kurt Danziger is a,

2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:22.580
 the opening chapter in that book

2:06:22.580 --> 2:06:26.220
 is absolutely mind blowing.

2:06:26.220 --> 2:06:29.380
 I love it, I love it.

2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:30.960
 I just think it's fantastic.

2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:35.480
 And I would say that there are many,

2:06:35.480 --> 2:06:39.020
 many popular science books that I could recommend

2:06:39.020 --> 2:06:42.500
 that I think are extremely well written in their own way.

2:06:42.500 --> 2:06:44.580
 You know, before I, maybe I said this to you,

2:06:44.580 --> 2:06:49.140
 but before I undertook writing How Emotions Are Made,

2:06:49.140 --> 2:06:53.060
 I read, I don't know, somewhere on the order of 50 or 60

2:06:54.340 --> 2:06:56.540
 popular science books to try to figure out

2:06:56.540 --> 2:07:00.460
 how to write a popular science book.

2:07:00.460 --> 2:07:03.980
 Because while there are many books about writing,

2:07:03.980 --> 2:07:07.380
 Stephen King has a great book about writing.

2:07:07.380 --> 2:07:10.660
 And, you know, where he gives tips

2:07:10.660 --> 2:07:13.380
 interlaced with his own personal history.

2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:17.500
 That was where I learned you write for a specific person.

2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:19.320
 You have a specific person in mind.

2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:22.740
 And that's, for me, that person is Dan.

2:07:22.740 --> 2:07:23.580
 That's fascinating.

2:07:23.580 --> 2:07:24.780
 I mean, that's a whole nother conversation

2:07:24.780 --> 2:07:27.980
 to have like which popular science books,

2:07:27.980 --> 2:07:31.340
 like what you learned from that search.

2:07:31.340 --> 2:07:34.300
 Because there's, I have some,

2:07:34.300 --> 2:07:35.700
 for me, some popular science books

2:07:35.700 --> 2:07:38.180
 that like I just roll my eyes, like this is too,

2:07:40.100 --> 2:07:41.780
 it's the same with TED Talks.

2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:45.140
 Like some of them go too much into the flowery

2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:48.860
 and don't, I would say don't give enough respect

2:07:48.860 --> 2:07:50.660
 to the intelligence of the reader.

2:07:51.780 --> 2:07:55.140
 And, but that's, this is my own bias very specifically.

2:07:55.140 --> 2:07:56.660
 I completely agree with you.

2:07:56.660 --> 2:08:01.660
 And in fact, I have a colleague, his name is Van Yang,

2:08:01.660 --> 2:08:06.660
 who, you know, he produced a cinematic lecture

2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:10.580
 of how emotions are made that we wrote together

2:08:10.580 --> 2:08:13.860
 with Joseph Fridman, no relation.

2:08:13.860 --> 2:08:14.940
 Yes.

2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:16.100
 Well, we're all related.

2:08:16.100 --> 2:08:17.420
 Well, I mean, you and I are probably,

2:08:17.420 --> 2:08:18.620
 you know, have some, yeah.

2:08:18.620 --> 2:08:20.740
 Yeah, I remember.

2:08:20.740 --> 2:08:22.820
 It's the memories are in there somewhere.

2:08:22.820 --> 2:08:26.140
 Yeah, it's from many, many, many generations ago.

2:08:26.140 --> 2:08:28.700
 Well, half my family is Russian, so from.

2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:29.540
 The good half.

2:08:29.540 --> 2:08:31.780
 The good half, right.

2:08:31.780 --> 2:08:36.780
 But, you know, he, his goal actually is to produce,

2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:46.460
 you know, videos and lectures

2:08:46.460 --> 2:08:49.820
 that are beautiful and educational

2:08:49.820 --> 2:08:54.820
 and that don't dumb the material down.

2:08:56.260 --> 2:08:59.260
 And he's really remarkable at it actually.

2:08:59.260 --> 2:09:01.980
 I mean, just, but again, you know,

2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:04.340
 that requires a bit of a paradigm shift.

2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:05.460
 We could have a whole conversation

2:09:05.460 --> 2:09:08.340
 about the split between entertainment

2:09:08.340 --> 2:09:09.780
 and education in this country

2:09:09.780 --> 2:09:11.060
 and why it is the way it is,

2:09:11.060 --> 2:09:13.380
 but that's another conversation.

2:09:13.380 --> 2:09:14.340
 To be continued.

2:09:14.340 --> 2:09:17.300
 But I would say if I were to pick one book

2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:20.420
 that I think is a really good example

2:09:20.420 --> 2:09:23.640
 of good science writing, it would be The Beak of the Finch.

2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:28.640
 Which won a Pulitzer Prize a number of years ago.

2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:34.280
 And I'm not, I'm not remembering the author's name.

2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:35.920
 I'm blanking.

2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:40.680
 But the, I'm guessing, is it focusing on birds

2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:42.480
 and the evolution of birds?

2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:45.160
 Actually, there's also The Evolution of Beauty,

2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:48.080
 which is, yeah, which is also a great book.

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:51.460
 But no, The Beak of the Finch is,

2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:56.460
 it's a, it has two storylines that are interwoven.

2:09:56.820 --> 2:10:01.820
 One is about Darwin and Darwin's explorations

2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:04.040
 in the Galapagos Island.

2:10:04.040 --> 2:10:07.800
 And then modern day researchers from Princeton

2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:10.880
 who have a research program in the Galapagos

2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:13.060
 looking at Darwin's finches.

2:10:13.060 --> 2:10:18.060
 And it's just a really, first of all,

2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:21.400
 there's top notch science in there.

2:10:21.400 --> 2:10:26.040
 And really science, like evolutionary biology

2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:28.480
 that a lot of people don't know.

2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:30.860
 And it's told really, really well.

2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:34.440
 It sounds like they're also, there's a narrative in there.

2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:35.840
 It's like storytelling too.

2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:38.720
 Yeah, I think all good popular science books

2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.060
 are storytelling, but storytelling grounded,

2:10:42.060 --> 2:10:44.680
 constrained by the evidence.

2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:47.220
 And then I just wanna say that there are,

2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:51.280
 for fiction, I'm a really big fan of love stories,

2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:54.600
 just to return us to the topic that we began with.

2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:59.600
 And so my, some of my favorite love stories

2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:04.240
 are Major Pettigrew's Last Stand by Helen Simonson.

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:08.700
 It's a love story about people

2:11:08.700 --> 2:11:11.260
 who you wouldn't expect to fall in love

2:11:11.260 --> 2:11:12.960
 and all the people around them

2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:15.720
 who have to overcome their prejudices.

2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:19.520
 And I love this book.

2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:22.120
 What do you like, like what makes a good love story?

2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:24.560
 There isn't one thing.

2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:25.640
 There are many different things

2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:26.880
 that make a good love story.

2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:31.880
 But I think in this case, you can feel,

2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:36.160
 you can feel the journey.

2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:39.080
 You can feel the journey that these characters are on

2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:42.860
 and all the people around them are on this journey too,

2:11:42.860 --> 2:11:47.700
 basically to come to grips with this really unexpected love,

2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:50.280
 really profound love that develops

2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:52.080
 between these two characters

2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:55.680
 who are very unlikely to have fallen in love, but they do.

2:11:55.680 --> 2:12:00.000
 And it's just, it's very gentle.

2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:05.000
 Another book like that is the storied life of A.J. Fierke,

2:12:08.140 --> 2:12:11.120
 which is also a love story.

2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:12.920
 But in this case, it's a love story

2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:17.920
 between a little girl and her adopted dad.

2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:23.320
 And the dad is this like real curmudgeony, you know, guy.

2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:28.120
 But of course there's a story there.

2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:31.760
 And it's just a beautiful love story.

2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:36.680
 But it also, it's like everybody in this community

2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:40.960
 falls in love with him because he falls in love with her.

2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:44.400
 And he, you know, she just gets left at his store,

2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:46.840
 his bookstore, he has this failing bookstore.

2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:51.800
 And he discovers that, you know,

2:12:51.800 --> 2:12:54.440
 he feels like inexplicably this need

2:12:54.440 --> 2:12:56.540
 to take care of this little baby.

2:12:56.540 --> 2:13:00.380
 And this whole life emerges out of that one decision,

2:13:00.380 --> 2:13:05.380
 which is really beautiful actually, very poignant.

2:13:05.380 --> 2:13:10.300
 Do you think the greatest stories have a happy ending

2:13:10.300 --> 2:13:14.060
 or a heartbreak at the end?

2:13:14.060 --> 2:13:15.420
 That's such a Russian question.

2:13:15.420 --> 2:13:18.140
 It's like Russian tragedies, you know.

2:13:18.140 --> 2:13:20.020
 So I would say the answer to that for me,

2:13:20.020 --> 2:13:21.860
 there has to be heartbreak.

2:13:21.860 --> 2:13:24.180
 Yeah, I really don't like heartbreak.

2:13:24.180 --> 2:13:25.620
 I don't like heartbreak.

2:13:25.620 --> 2:13:27.560
 I want there to be a happy ending

2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:32.320
 or at least a hopeful ending.

2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:36.540
 But you know, like Dr. Chivago, like,

2:13:36.540 --> 2:13:40.820
 or the English patient, oh my goodness, like why?

2:13:40.820 --> 2:13:45.220
 Oh, it's just, yeah, no, mm mm.

2:13:45.220 --> 2:13:47.740
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it

2:13:47.740 --> 2:13:50.980
 on a happy note like this.

2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:53.020
 Lisa, like I said, I'm a huge fan of yours.

2:13:53.020 --> 2:13:57.700
 Thank you for wasting yet more time with me talking again.

2:13:57.700 --> 2:13:59.540
 People should definitely get your book

2:13:59.540 --> 2:14:02.440
 and maybe one day I can't wait to talk

2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:03.500
 to your husband as well.

2:14:03.500 --> 2:14:05.520
 Well, right back at you, Lexi.

2:14:07.740 --> 2:14:09.260

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:14:54.860 --> 2:14:58.340
 from Sun Tzu and the Art of War.

2:14:58.340 --> 2:15:01.020
 There are not more than five musical notes,

2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:03.620
 yet the combination of these five give rise

2:15:03.620 --> 2:15:06.700
 to more melodies that can ever be heard.

2:15:06.700 --> 2:15:09.660
 There are not more than five primary colors,

2:15:09.660 --> 2:15:12.940
 yet in combination they produce more hues

2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:15.140
 that can ever be seen.

2:15:15.140 --> 2:15:18.860
 There are not more than five cardinal tastes,

2:15:18.860 --> 2:15:22.940
 and yet combinations of them yield more flavors

2:15:22.940 --> 2:15:25.460
 than can ever be tasted.

2:15:25.460 --> 2:15:54.460
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
