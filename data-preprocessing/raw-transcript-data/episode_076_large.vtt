00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
 The following is a conversation with John Hopfield,

00:03.440 --> 00:07.600
 professor at Princeton, whose life's work weaved beautifully

00:07.600 --> 00:11.720
 through biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.000
 Most crucially, he saw the messy world of biology

00:15.000 --> 00:18.360
 through the piercing eyes of a physicist.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.160
 He's perhaps best known for his work

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
 on associative neural networks,

00:22.160 --> 00:24.960
 now known as Hopfield networks,

00:24.960 --> 00:27.720
 that were one of the early ideas that catalyzed

00:27.720 --> 00:30.320
 the development of the modern field of deep learning.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.120
 As his 2019 Franklin Medal in Physics Award states,

00:35.120 --> 00:37.800
 he applied concepts of theoretical physics

00:37.800 --> 00:41.040
 to provide new insights on important biological questions

00:41.040 --> 00:45.040
 in a variety of areas, including genetics and neuroscience

00:45.040 --> 00:48.000
 with significant impact on machine learning.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.480
 And as John says in his 2018 article titled,

00:51.480 --> 00:55.600
 Now What?, his accomplishments have often come about

00:55.600 --> 00:59.720
 by asking that very question, now what?

00:59.720 --> 01:02.920
 And often responding by a major change of direction.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.000
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.240
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:09.240 --> 01:11.080
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:11.080 --> 01:14.500
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,

01:14.500 --> 01:18.980
 and Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A M.

01:18.980 --> 01:21.520
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

01:21.520 --> 01:22.980
 and never any ads in the middle

01:22.980 --> 01:25.280
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.720
 I hope that works for you

01:26.720 --> 01:29.440
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.920
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.320
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.780
 When you get it, use code LexPodcast.

01:37.780 --> 01:41.000
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.800
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.000
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.440
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

01:49.440 --> 01:50.980
 that works behind the scenes

01:50.980 --> 01:53.800
 to create the abstraction of fractional orders

01:53.800 --> 01:56.360
 is to me an algorithmic marvel.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.560
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

01:58.560 --> 02:00.240
 for solving a hard problem

02:00.240 --> 02:02.720
 that in the end provides an easy interface

02:02.720 --> 02:05.320
 that takes a step up the next layer of abstraction

02:05.320 --> 02:06.720
 over the stock market,

02:06.720 --> 02:09.320
 making trading more accessible for new investors

02:09.320 --> 02:12.040
 and diversification much easier.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.400
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,

02:15.400 --> 02:18.440
 Google Play, and use code LexPodcast,

02:18.440 --> 02:19.720
 you'll get $10,

02:19.720 --> 02:22.520
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

02:22.520 --> 02:24.200
 one of my favorite organizations

02:24.200 --> 02:27.280
 that is helping advance robotics and STEM education

02:27.280 --> 02:28.980
 for young people around the world.

02:29.880 --> 02:34.120
 And now here's my conversation with John Hopfield.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.840
 What difference between biological neural networks

02:37.840 --> 02:39.980
 and artificial neural networks

02:39.980 --> 02:42.280
 is most captivating and profound to you?

02:44.660 --> 02:47.080
 At the higher philosophical level,

02:47.080 --> 02:49.180
 let's not get technical just yet.

02:49.180 --> 02:53.300
 But one of the things that very much intrigues me

02:53.300 --> 02:58.300
 is the fact that neurons have all kinds of components,

03:00.060 --> 03:01.220
 properties to them.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.420
 And in evolutionary biology,

03:05.420 --> 03:07.300
 if you have some little quirk

03:07.300 --> 03:11.980
 in how a molecule works or how a cell works,

03:11.980 --> 03:13.500
 and it can be made use of,

03:13.500 --> 03:15.100
 evolution will sharpen it up

03:15.100 --> 03:20.100
 and make it into a useful feature rather than a glitch.

03:20.180 --> 03:24.860
 And so you expect in neurobiology for evolution

03:24.860 --> 03:27.900
 to have captured all kinds of possibilities

03:27.900 --> 03:29.060
 of getting neurons,

03:29.060 --> 03:31.800
 of how you get neurons to do things for you.

03:33.060 --> 03:36.980
 And that aspect has been completely suppressed

03:36.980 --> 03:38.700
 in artificial neural networks.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.700
 So the glitches become features

03:43.880 --> 03:46.760
 in the biological neural network.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.120
 They can.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.280
 Look, let me take one of the things

03:50.280 --> 03:52.280
 that I used to do research on.

03:54.280 --> 03:58.760
 If you take things which oscillate,

03:58.760 --> 04:02.720
 they have rhythms which are sort of close to each other.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.000
 Under some circumstances,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.920
 these things will have a phase transition

04:06.920 --> 04:08.300
 and suddenly the rhythm will,

04:08.300 --> 04:10.720
 everybody will fall into step.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.160
 There was a marvelous physical example of that

04:14.120 --> 04:17.160
 in the Millennium Bridge across the Thames River,

04:17.160 --> 04:21.020
 about, built about 2001.

04:21.020 --> 04:23.560
 And pedestrians walking across,

04:23.560 --> 04:26.040
 pedestrians don't walk synchronized,

04:26.040 --> 04:28.340
 they don't walk in lockstep.

04:28.340 --> 04:31.520
 But they're all walking about the same frequency

04:31.520 --> 04:33.800
 and the bridge could sway at that frequency

04:33.800 --> 04:36.920
 and the slight sway made pedestrians tend a little bit

04:36.920 --> 04:39.160
 to lock into step and after a while,

04:39.160 --> 04:41.680
 the bridge was oscillating back and forth

04:41.680 --> 04:43.960
 and the pedestrians were walking in step to it.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.960
 And you could see it in the movies made out of the bridge.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.600
 And the engineers made a simple minor mistake.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.680
 They assume when you walk, it's step, step, step

04:53.680 --> 04:56.240
 and it's back and forth motion.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.760
 But when you walk, it's also right foot left

04:58.760 --> 05:00.320
 with side to side motion.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.760
 And it's the side to side motion

05:01.760 --> 05:04.480
 for which the bridge was strong enough,

05:04.480 --> 05:08.220
 but it wasn't stiff enough.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.040
 And as a result, you would feel the motion

05:11.040 --> 05:12.920
 and you'd fall into step with it.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.100
 And people were very uncomfortable with it.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.520
 They closed the bridge for two years

05:16.520 --> 05:18.860
 while they built stiffening for it.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.880
 Now, nerve cells produce action potentials.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.180
 You have a bunch of cells which are loosely coupled together

05:26.180 --> 05:29.400
 producing action potentials at the same rate.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.780
 There'll be some circumstances

05:31.780 --> 05:34.600
 under which these things can lock together.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.880
 Other circumstances in which they won't.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.720
 Well, if they're fired together,

05:40.720 --> 05:43.400
 you can be sure that other cells are gonna notice it.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.960
 So you can make a computational feature out of this

05:45.960 --> 05:48.840
 in an evolving brain.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.800
 Most artificial neural networks

05:51.800 --> 05:53.560
 don't even have action potentials,

05:53.560 --> 05:56.960
 let alone have the possibility for synchronizing them.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.680
 And you mentioned the evolutionary process.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.360
 So the evolutionary process

06:04.360 --> 06:08.040
 that builds on top of biological systems

06:08.040 --> 06:13.040
 leverages the weird mess of it somehow.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.320
 So how do you make sense of that ability

06:18.320 --> 06:22.020
 to leverage all the different kinds of complexities

06:22.020 --> 06:24.620
 in the biological brain?

06:24.620 --> 06:28.760
 Well, look, in the biological molecule level,

06:29.960 --> 06:31.640
 you have a piece of DNA

06:31.640 --> 06:35.400
 which encodes for a particular protein.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.880
 You could duplicate that piece of DNA

06:37.880 --> 06:41.760
 and now one part of it can code for that protein,

06:41.760 --> 06:45.080
 but the other one could itself change a little bit

06:45.080 --> 06:46.800
 and thus start coding for a molecule

06:46.800 --> 06:48.560
 which is slightly different.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.320
 Now, if that molecule was just slightly different,

06:51.320 --> 06:56.280
 had a function which helped any old chemical reaction

06:56.280 --> 06:58.120
 which was important to the cell,

07:00.680 --> 07:03.480
 you would go ahead and let that try,

07:03.480 --> 07:06.580
 and evolution would slowly improve that function.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.520
 And so you have the possibility of duplicating

07:12.800 --> 07:14.760
 and then having things drift apart.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.760
 One of them retain the old function,

07:16.760 --> 07:18.760
 the other one do something new for you.

07:18.760 --> 07:23.760
 And there's evolutionary pressure to improve.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.440
 Look, there isn't in computers too,

07:25.440 --> 07:28.680
 but improvement has to do with closing some companies

07:28.680 --> 07:30.360
 and opening some others.

07:30.360 --> 07:34.120
 The evolutionary process looks a little different.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.520
 Yeah, similar timescale perhaps.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.640
 Much shorter in timescale.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.640
 Companies close, yeah, go bankrupt and are born,

07:42.640 --> 07:45.900
 yeah, shorter, but not much shorter.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.140
 Some companies last a century, but yeah, you're right.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
 I mean, if you think of companies as a single organism

07:53.160 --> 07:55.520
 that builds and you all know, yeah,

07:55.520 --> 08:00.520
 it's a fascinating dual correspondence there

08:00.840 --> 08:02.320
 between biological organisms.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.980
 And companies have difficulty having a new product

08:05.980 --> 08:07.680
 competing with an old product.

08:10.640 --> 08:14.960
 When IBM built its first PC, you probably read the book,

08:14.960 --> 08:18.880
 they made a little isolated internal unit to make the PC.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.680
 And for the first time in IBM's history,

08:22.680 --> 08:25.900
 they didn't insist that you build it out of IBM components.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.060
 But they understood that they could get into this market,

08:31.060 --> 08:33.200
 which is a very different thing

08:33.200 --> 08:35.720
 by completely changing their culture.

08:35.720 --> 08:44.720
 And biology finds other markets in a more adaptive way.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.280
 Yeah, it's better at it.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.280
 It's better at that kind of integration.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.720
 So maybe you've already said it,

08:52.720 --> 08:55.880
 but what to use the most beautiful aspect

08:55.880 --> 08:58.220
 or mechanism of the human mind?

09:01.920 --> 09:05.320
 Is it the adaptive, the ability to adapt

09:05.320 --> 09:07.680
 as you've described, or is there some other little quirk

09:07.680 --> 09:09.320
 that you particularly like?

09:11.520 --> 09:15.720
 Adaptation is everything when you get down to it.

09:16.760 --> 09:21.760
 But the difference, there are differences between adaptation

09:21.760 --> 09:25.280
 where your learning goes on only over generations

09:25.280 --> 09:28.360
 and over evolutionary time,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.720
 where your learning goes on at the time scale

09:30.720 --> 09:34.360
 of one individual who must learn from the environment

09:34.360 --> 09:36.900
 during that individual's lifetime.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.340
 And biology has both kinds of learning in it.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.640
 And the thing which makes neurobiology hard

09:47.640 --> 09:52.640
 is that a mathematical system, as it were,

09:53.120 --> 09:56.500
 built on this other kind of evolutionary system.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.120
 What do you mean by mathematical system?

10:01.120 --> 10:03.600
 Where's the math and the biology?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.280
 Well, when you talk to a computer scientist

10:05.280 --> 10:08.120
 about neural networks, it's all math.

10:08.120 --> 10:12.120
 The fact that biology actually came about from evolution,

10:13.560 --> 10:18.560
 and the fact that biology is about a system

10:19.040 --> 10:22.740
 which you can build in three dimensions.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.880
 If you look at computer chips,

10:27.960 --> 10:31.520
 computer chips are basically two dimensional structures,

10:31.520 --> 10:36.200
 maybe 2.1 dimensions, but they really have difficulty

10:36.200 --> 10:39.200
 doing three dimensional wiring.

10:39.200 --> 10:44.200
 Biology is, the neocortex is actually also sheet like,

10:45.760 --> 10:47.680
 and it sits on top of the white matter,

10:47.680 --> 10:50.400
 which is about 10 times the volume of the gray matter

10:50.400 --> 10:53.520
 and contains all what you might call the wires.

10:53.520 --> 10:58.520
 But there's a huge, the effect of computer structure

11:01.840 --> 11:06.100
 on what is easy and what is hard is immense.

11:09.120 --> 11:13.280
 And biology does, it makes some things easy

11:13.280 --> 11:16.060
 that are very difficult to understand

11:16.060 --> 11:17.920
 how to do computationally.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.040
 On the other hand, you can't do simple floating point

11:21.040 --> 11:23.880
 arithmetic because it's awfully stupid.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.660
 And you're saying this kind of three dimensional

11:25.660 --> 11:30.660
 complicated structure makes, it's still math.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.360
 It's still doing math.

11:32.360 --> 11:36.200
 The kind of math it's doing enables you to solve problems

11:36.200 --> 11:38.280
 of a very different kind.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.760
 That's right, that's right.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.720
 So you mentioned two kinds of adaptation,

11:43.720 --> 11:46.840
 the evolutionary adaptation and the adaptation

11:46.840 --> 11:50.000
 or learning at the scale of a single human life.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
 Which do you, which is particularly beautiful to you

11:56.920 --> 11:59.320
 and interesting from a research

11:59.320 --> 12:01.180
 and from just a human perspective?

12:02.160 --> 12:03.600
 And which is more powerful?

12:05.840 --> 12:08.720
 I find things most interesting that I begin to see

12:10.160 --> 12:12.640
 how to get into the edges of them

12:12.640 --> 12:15.400
 and tease them apart a little bit and see how they work.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.400
 And since I can't see the evolutionary process going on,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.560
 I'm in awe of it.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.120
 But I find it just a black hole as far as trying

12:30.120 --> 12:32.000
 to understand what to do.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.220
 And so in a certain sense, I'm in awe of it,

12:35.220 --> 12:37.520
 but I couldn't be interested in working on it.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.880
 The human life's time scale is however thing

12:43.880 --> 12:47.760
 you can tease apart and study.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.160
 Yeah, you can do, there's developmental neurobiology

12:51.160 --> 12:54.280
 which understands how the connections

12:56.240 --> 13:00.920
 and how the structure evolves from a combination

13:00.920 --> 13:04.400
 of what the genetics is like and the real,

13:04.400 --> 13:08.240
 the fact that you're building a system in three dimensions.

13:08.240 --> 13:13.240
 In just days and months, those early days

13:14.400 --> 13:17.200
 of a human life are really interesting.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.080
 They are and of course, there are times

13:21.080 --> 13:24.260
 of immense cell multiplication.

13:24.260 --> 13:28.120
 There are also times of the greatest cell death

13:28.120 --> 13:30.860
 in the brain is during infancy.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
 It's turnover.

13:33.120 --> 13:38.120
 So what is not effective, what is not wired well enough

13:39.760 --> 13:41.960
 to use at the moment, throw it out.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.040
 It's a mysterious process.

13:45.040 --> 13:49.440
 From, let me ask, from what field do you think

13:49.440 --> 13:51.480
 the biggest breakthrough is in understanding

13:51.480 --> 13:56.400
 the mind will come in the next decades?

13:56.400 --> 13:59.680
 Is it neuroscience, computer science, neurobiology,

13:59.680 --> 14:04.680
 psychology, physics, maybe math, maybe literature?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.040
 Well, of course, I see the world always

14:11.040 --> 14:12.520
 through a lens of physics.

14:12.520 --> 14:17.520
 I grew up in physics and the way I pick problems

14:19.040 --> 14:21.800
 is very characteristic of physics

14:21.800 --> 14:25.360
 and of an intellectual background which is not psychology,

14:25.360 --> 14:28.320
 which is not chemistry and so on and so on.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.200
 Yeah, both of your parents are physicists.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.920
 Both of my parents were physicists

14:31.920 --> 14:36.120
 and the real thing I got out of that was a feeling

14:36.120 --> 14:40.280
 that the world is an understandable place

14:41.840 --> 14:45.480
 and if you do enough experiments and think about

14:45.480 --> 14:48.200
 what they mean and structure things

14:48.200 --> 14:50.720
 so you can do the mathematics of the,

14:50.720 --> 14:53.080
 relevant to the experiments, you ought to be able

14:53.080 --> 14:55.040
 to understand how things work.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.920
 But that was, that was a few years ago.

14:58.920 --> 15:03.600
 Did you change your mind at all through many decades

15:03.600 --> 15:06.000
 of trying to understand the mind,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.560
 of studying in different kinds of ways?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.880
 Not even the mind, just biological systems.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.040
 You still have hope that physics, that you can understand?

15:17.120 --> 15:20.840
 There's a question of what do you mean by understand?

15:20.840 --> 15:21.680
 Of course.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.480
 When I taught freshman physics, I used to say,

15:24.480 --> 15:26.600
 I wanted to get physics to understand the subject,

15:26.600 --> 15:28.920
 to understand Newton's laws.

15:28.920 --> 15:33.840
 I didn't want them simply to memorize a set of examples

15:33.840 --> 15:36.680
 to which they knew the equations to write down

15:36.680 --> 15:38.200
 to generate the answers.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.280
 I had this nebulous idea of understanding

15:42.280 --> 15:44.440
 so that if you looked at a situation,

15:44.440 --> 15:48.400
 you could say, oh, I expect the ball to make that trajectory

15:48.400 --> 15:52.600
 or I expect some intuitive notion of understanding

15:52.600 --> 15:57.600
 and I don't know how to express that very well

15:58.280 --> 16:01.200
 and I've never known how to express it well.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.920
 And you run smack up against it when you do these,

16:04.920 --> 16:07.840
 look at these simple neural nets,

16:07.840 --> 16:12.840
 feed forward neural nets, which do amazing things

16:13.360 --> 16:16.520
 and yet, you know, contain nothing of the essence

16:16.520 --> 16:20.200
 of what I would have felt was understanding.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.040
 Understanding is more than just an enormous lookup table.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.440
 Let's linger on that.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.160
 How sure you are of that?

16:28.160 --> 16:30.320
 What if the table gets really big?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.560
 So, I mean, asked another way,

16:34.560 --> 16:37.160
 these feed forward neural networks,

16:37.160 --> 16:38.960
 do you think they'll ever understand?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.880
 Could answer that in two ways.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.280
 I think if you look at real systems,

16:45.280 --> 16:50.280
 feedback is an essential aspect

16:50.280 --> 16:53.000
 of how these real systems compute.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.520
 On the other hand, if I have a mathematical system

16:55.520 --> 16:58.720
 with feedback, I know I can unlayer this and do it,

16:58.720 --> 17:03.720
 but I have an exponential expansion

17:03.920 --> 17:06.120
 in the amount of stuff I have to build

17:06.120 --> 17:08.800
 if I can resolve the problem that way.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.000
 So feedback is essential.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.120
 So we can talk even about recurrent neural nets,

17:13.120 --> 17:17.600
 so recurrence, but do you think all the pieces are there

17:17.600 --> 17:22.320
 to achieve understanding through these simple mechanisms?

17:22.320 --> 17:25.280
 Like back to our original question,

17:25.280 --> 17:28.480
 what is the fundamental, is there a fundamental difference

17:28.480 --> 17:31.960
 between artificial neural networks and biological

17:31.960 --> 17:34.720
 or is it just a bunch of surface stuff?

17:34.720 --> 17:39.720
 Suppose you ask a neurosurgeon, when is somebody dead?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.480
 Yeah.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.200
 So we'll probably go back to saying,

17:44.200 --> 17:46.760
 well, I can look at the brain rhythms

17:47.960 --> 17:49.280
 and tell you this is a brain

17:49.280 --> 17:51.360
 which has never could have functioned again.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.720
 This is one of the, this other one is one of the stuff

17:53.720 --> 17:58.240
 we treat it well is still recoverable.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.680
 And then just do that by some electrodes

18:00.680 --> 18:04.680
 looking at simple electrical patterns,

18:05.840 --> 18:08.120
 which don't look in any detail at all

18:08.120 --> 18:13.120
 what individual neurons are doing.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.640
 These rhythms are utterly absent

18:17.640 --> 18:19.720
 from anything which goes on at Google.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.080
 Yeah, but the rhythms.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.880
 But the rhythms what?

18:27.880 --> 18:31.280
 So, well, that's like comparing, okay, I'll tell you,

18:31.280 --> 18:36.280
 it's like you're comparing the greatest classical musician

18:36.280 --> 18:39.600
 in the world to a child first learning to play.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.240
 The question I'm at, but they're still both

18:41.240 --> 18:42.680
 playing the piano.

18:42.680 --> 18:47.280
 I'm asking, is there, will it ever go on at Google?

18:48.320 --> 18:49.560
 Do you have a hope?

18:49.560 --> 18:52.200
 Because you're one of the seminal figures

18:52.200 --> 18:55.200
 in both launching both disciplines,

18:55.200 --> 18:57.240
 both sides of the river.

18:59.320 --> 19:04.320
 I think it's going to go on generation after generation.

19:04.320 --> 19:09.200
 The way it has where what you might call

19:09.200 --> 19:11.840
 the AI computer science community says,

19:12.840 --> 19:14.040
 let's take the following.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.920
 This is our model of neurobiology at the moment.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.480
 Let's pretend it's good enough

19:20.480 --> 19:22.400
 and do everything we can with it.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.880
 And it does interesting things.

19:25.880 --> 19:30.320
 And after a while it sort of grinds into the sand

19:30.320 --> 19:35.080
 and you say, ah, something else is needed for neurobiology.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.160
 And some other grand thing comes in

19:38.320 --> 19:41.040
 and enables you to go a lot further.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.240
 What will go into the sand again?

19:44.240 --> 19:47.320
 And I think it could be generations of this evolution.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.800
 I don't know how many of them.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.840
 And each one is going to get you further

19:50.840 --> 19:53.480
 into what a brain does.

19:53.480 --> 19:58.480
 And in some sense, past the Turing test longer

19:58.480 --> 20:02.040
 and in more broad aspects.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.040
 And how many of these are going to have to be

20:08.040 --> 20:11.600
 before you say, I've made something,

20:11.600 --> 20:15.360
 I've made a human, I don't know.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.720
 But your sense is it might be a couple.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.640
 My sense is it might be a couple more.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.800
 Yeah.

20:20.800 --> 20:25.800
 And going back to my brainwaves as it were.

20:25.800 --> 20:30.800
 Yes, from the AI point of view,

20:32.840 --> 20:35.920
 they would say, ah, maybe these are an epiphenomenon

20:35.920 --> 20:37.520
 and not important at all.

20:40.320 --> 20:45.000
 The first car I had, a real wreck of a 1936 Dodge,

20:46.640 --> 20:49.920
 go above about 45 miles an hour and the wheels would shimmy.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.480
 Yeah.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.720
 Good speedometer that.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.720
 Now, nobody designed the car that way.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.000
 The car is malfunctioning to have that.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.800
 But in biology, if it were useful to know

21:05.800 --> 21:08.400
 when are you going more than 45 miles an hour,

21:08.400 --> 21:10.040
 you just capture that.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.440
 And you wouldn't worry about where it came from.

21:15.560 --> 21:16.400
 Yeah.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.920
 It's going to be a long time before that kind of thing,

21:18.920 --> 21:23.920
 which can take place in large complex networks of things

21:25.240 --> 21:27.640
 is actually used in the computation.

21:27.640 --> 21:32.080
 Look, how many transistors are there

21:32.080 --> 21:33.680
 in your laptop these days?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.360
 Actually, I don't know the number.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.960
 It's on the scale of 10 to the 10.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.640
 I can't remember the number either.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.480
 Yeah.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.680
 And all the transistors are somewhat similar.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.840
 And most physical systems with that many parts,

21:49.840 --> 21:54.120
 all of which are similar, have collective properties.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.240
 Yes.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.600
 Sound waves in air, earthquakes,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.640
 what have you, have collective properties.

21:59.640 --> 22:00.480
 Weather.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.280
 There are no collective properties used

22:05.280 --> 22:08.040
 in artificial neural networks, in AI.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.000
 Yeah, it's very.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.320
 If biology uses them,

22:14.320 --> 22:17.040
 it's going to take us to more generations of things

22:17.040 --> 22:18.960
 for people to actually dig in

22:18.960 --> 22:21.320
 and see how they are used and what they mean.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.240
 See, you're very right.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.800
 We might have to return several times to neurobiology

22:28.800 --> 22:32.840
 and try to make our transistors more messy.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.920
 Yeah, yeah.

22:35.040 --> 22:40.040
 At the same time, the simple ones will conquer big aspects.

22:40.040 --> 22:45.040
 And I think one of the most, biggest surprises to me was

22:47.800 --> 22:49.280
 how well learning systems

22:49.280 --> 22:51.800
 because they're manifestly nonbiological,

22:52.840 --> 22:54.880
 how important they can be actually,

22:54.880 --> 22:58.840
 and how important and how useful they can be in AI.

22:59.840 --> 23:04.840
 So if we can just take a stroll to some of your work.

23:04.840 --> 23:09.840
 If we can just take a stroll to some of your work

23:10.280 --> 23:12.480
 that is incredibly surprising,

23:12.480 --> 23:14.080
 that it works as well as it does,

23:14.080 --> 23:18.320
 that launched a lot of the recent work with neural networks.

23:18.320 --> 23:23.320
 If we go to what are now called Hopfield networks,

23:26.040 --> 23:29.720
 can you tell me what is associative memory in the mind

23:29.720 --> 23:31.060
 for the human side?

23:31.920 --> 23:33.560
 Let's explore memory for a bit.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.320
 Okay, what do you mean by associative memory is,

23:37.520 --> 23:42.040
 ah, you have a memory of each of your friends.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.800
 Your friend has all kinds of properties

23:43.800 --> 23:46.000
 from what they look like, what their voice sounds like,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.880
 to where they went to college, where you met them,

23:50.480 --> 23:54.120
 go on and on, what science papers they've written.

23:55.960 --> 24:00.960
 And if I start talking about a 5 foot 10 wire,

24:00.960 --> 24:03.960
 cognitive scientist who's got a very bad back,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.160
 it doesn't take very long for you to say,

24:06.160 --> 24:07.960
 oh, he's talking about Jeff Hinton.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.400
 I never mentioned the name or anything very particular.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.160
 But somehow a few facts that are associated

24:18.160 --> 24:21.960
 with a particular person enables you to get a hold

24:21.960 --> 24:23.800
 of the rest of the facts.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.960
 Or not the rest of them, another subset of them.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.960
 And it's this ability to link things together,

24:33.280 --> 24:37.280
 link experiences together, which goes under

24:37.280 --> 24:40.440
 the general name of associative memory.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.920
 And a large part of intelligent behavior

24:43.920 --> 24:47.440
 is actually just large associative memories at work,

24:47.440 --> 24:48.760
 as far as I can see.

24:49.640 --> 24:53.400
 What do you think is the mechanism of how it works?

24:53.400 --> 24:57.320
 What do you think is the mechanism of how it works

24:57.320 --> 24:58.600
 in the mind?

24:58.600 --> 25:01.360
 Is it a mystery to you still?

25:03.000 --> 25:07.280
 Do you have inklings of how this essential thing

25:07.280 --> 25:08.720
 for cognition works?

25:10.080 --> 25:14.960
 What I made 35 years ago was, of course,

25:14.960 --> 25:19.960
 a crude physics model to actually enable you

25:19.960 --> 25:24.320
 to understand my old sense of understanding

25:24.320 --> 25:26.640
 as a physicist, because you could say,

25:26.640 --> 25:29.560
 ah, I understand why this goes to stable states.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.640
 It's like things going downhill.

25:32.640 --> 25:37.640
 And that gives you something with which to think

25:39.080 --> 25:42.720
 in physical terms rather than only in mathematical terms.

25:42.720 --> 25:47.120
 So you've created these associative artificial networks.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.320
 That's right.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.640
 Now, if you look at what I did,

25:53.720 --> 25:58.720
 I didn't at all describe a system which gracefully learns.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.520
 I described a system in which you could understand

26:02.520 --> 26:06.040
 how learning could link things together,

26:06.040 --> 26:08.120
 how very crudely it might learn.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.280
 One of the things which intrigues me

26:11.280 --> 26:15.240
 as I reinvestigate that system now to some extent is,

26:15.240 --> 26:20.240
 look, I see you, I'll see you every second

26:20.880 --> 26:23.640
 for the next hour or what have you.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.480
 Each look at you is a little bit different.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.640
 I don't store all those second by second images.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.360
 I don't store 3,000 images.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.800
 I somehow compact this information.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.840
 So I now have a view of you,

26:37.840 --> 26:42.840
 which I can use.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.240
 It doesn't slavishly remember anything in particular,

26:47.240 --> 26:50.880
 but it compacts the information into useful chunks,

26:50.880 --> 26:54.840
 which are somehow these chunks,

26:54.840 --> 26:57.800
 which are not just activities of neurons,

26:57.800 --> 26:59.760
 bigger things than that,

26:59.760 --> 27:03.760
 which are the real entities which are useful to you.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.680
 Which are useful to you.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.320
 Useful to you to describe,

27:10.320 --> 27:13.520
 to compress this information coming at you.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.040
 And you have to compress it in such a way

27:15.040 --> 27:19.360
 that if the information comes in just like this again,

27:19.360 --> 27:24.360
 I don't bother to rewrite it or efforts to rewrite it

27:24.760 --> 27:26.720
 simply do not yield anything

27:26.720 --> 27:29.720
 because those things are already written.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.120
 And that needs to be not,

27:32.120 --> 27:36.200
 look this up, have I stored it somewhere already?

27:36.200 --> 27:39.800
 There'll be something which is much more automatic

27:39.800 --> 27:41.840
 in the machine hardware.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.760
 Right, so in the human mind,

27:44.760 --> 27:47.960
 how complicated is that process do you think?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.400
 So you've created,

27:50.720 --> 27:52.600
 feels weird to be sitting with John Hotfield

27:52.600 --> 27:54.920
 calling him Hotfield Networks, but.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.760
 It is weird.

27:55.760 --> 28:00.600
 Yeah, but nevertheless, that's what everyone calls him.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.880
 So here we are.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.960
 So that's a simplification.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.720
 That's what a physicist would do.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.440
 You and Richard Feynman sat down

28:08.440 --> 28:09.960
 and talked about associative memory.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.480
 Now, if you look at the mind

28:14.480 --> 28:17.400
 where you can't quite simplify it so perfectly,

28:17.400 --> 28:18.240
 do you think that?

28:18.240 --> 28:21.920
 Well, let me backtrack just a little bit.

28:21.920 --> 28:22.960
 Yeah.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.680
 Biology is about dynamical systems.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.480
 Computers are dynamical systems.

28:29.480 --> 28:34.480
 You can ask, if you want to model biology,

28:35.360 --> 28:38.440
 if you want to model neurobiology,

28:38.440 --> 28:39.920
 what is the time scale?

28:39.920 --> 28:42.600
 There's a dynamical system in which,

28:42.600 --> 28:46.360
 of a fairly fast time scale in which you could say,

28:46.360 --> 28:49.480
 the synapses don't change much during this computation,

28:49.480 --> 28:51.760
 so I'll think of the synapses fixed

28:51.760 --> 28:54.240
 and just do the dynamics of the activity.

28:54.240 --> 28:58.920
 Or you can say, the synapses are changing fast enough

28:58.920 --> 29:01.360
 that I have to have the synaptic dynamics

29:01.360 --> 29:04.280
 working at the same time as the system dynamics

29:05.160 --> 29:07.800
 in order to understand the biology.

29:11.560 --> 29:15.280
 Most, if you look at the feedforward artificial neural nets,

29:16.160 --> 29:18.440
 they're all done as learnings.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.360
 First of all, I spend some time learning, not performing,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.480
 and I turn off learning and I turn off learning,

29:23.480 --> 29:25.280
 and I turn off learning and I perform.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.680
 Right.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.960
 That's not biology.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.720
 And so as I look more deeply at neurobiology,

29:34.720 --> 29:37.000
 even as associative memory,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.360
 I've got to face the fact that the dynamics

29:39.360 --> 29:42.720
 of the synapse change is going on all the time.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.320
 And I can't just get by by saying,

29:46.320 --> 29:50.640
 I'll do the dynamics of activity with fixed synapses.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.480
 Yeah.

29:52.600 --> 29:56.120
 So the synaptic, the dynamics of the synapses

29:56.120 --> 29:58.200
 is actually fundamental to the whole system.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.000
 Yeah, yeah.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.800
 And there's nothing necessarily separating the time scales.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.560
 When the time scale's gonna be separated,

30:06.560 --> 30:08.200
 it's neat from the physicist's

30:08.200 --> 30:10.840
 or the mathematician's point of view,

30:10.840 --> 30:13.720
 but it's not necessarily true in neurobiology.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.800
 So you're kind of dancing beautifully

30:16.800 --> 30:20.320
 between showing a lot of respect to physics

30:20.320 --> 30:24.080
 and then also saying that physics

30:24.080 --> 30:29.080
 cannot quite reach the complexity of biology.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.680
 So where do you land?

30:30.680 --> 30:33.360
 Or do you continuously dance between the two points?

30:33.360 --> 30:34.920
 I continuously dance between them

30:34.920 --> 30:37.040
 because my whole notion of understanding

30:39.800 --> 30:43.000
 is that you can describe to somebody else

30:43.000 --> 30:47.320
 how something works in ways which are honest and believable

30:47.320 --> 30:52.320
 and still not describe all the nuts and bolts in detail.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.080
 Weather.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.440
 I can describe weather

30:59.560 --> 31:04.560
 as 10 to the 32 molecules colliding in the atmosphere.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.560
 I can simulate weather that way if I have a big enough machine.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.200
 I'll simulate it accurately.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.560
 It's no good for understanding.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.160
 If I want to understand things, I want to understand things

31:16.160 --> 31:19.080
 in terms of wind patterns, hurricanes,

31:19.080 --> 31:21.000
 pressure differentials, and so on,

31:21.000 --> 31:22.640
 all things as they're collective.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.800
 And the physicist in me always hopes

31:29.800 --> 31:32.320
 that biology will have some things

31:32.320 --> 31:35.320
 that can be said about it which are both true

31:35.320 --> 31:38.360
 and for which you don't need all the molecular details

31:38.360 --> 31:39.920
 as the molecules colliding.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.960
 That's what I mean from the roots of physics,

31:42.960 --> 31:44.040
 by understanding.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.960
 So what did, again, sorry,

31:47.960 --> 31:51.160
 but Hopfield Networks help you understand

31:51.160 --> 31:56.160
 what insight did give us about memory, about learning?

31:57.960 --> 32:02.000
 They didn't give insights about learning.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
 They gave insights about how things having learned

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
 could be expressed, how having learned a picture of you,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.240
 a picture of you reminds me of your name.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.080
 That would, but it didn't describe a reasonable way

32:20.080 --> 32:21.880
 of actually doing the learning.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.240
 They only said if you had previously learned

32:27.240 --> 32:30.040
 the connections of this kind of pattern,

32:30.040 --> 32:31.560
 would now be able to,

32:31.560 --> 32:34.640
 behave in a physical way was to say,

32:34.640 --> 32:37.200
 ah, if I put the part of the pattern in here,

32:37.200 --> 32:40.960
 the other part of the pattern will complete over here.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.360
 I could understand that physics,

32:43.360 --> 32:45.920
 if the right learning stuff had already been put in.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.800
 And it could understand why then putting in a picture

32:48.800 --> 32:51.360
 of somebody else would generate something else over here.

32:52.880 --> 32:56.920
 But it did not have a reasonable description

32:56.920 --> 32:59.320
 of the learning that was going on.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.880
 It did not have a reasonable description

33:01.880 --> 33:03.840
 of the learning process.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.680
 But even, so forget learning.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.320
 I mean, that's just a powerful concept

33:07.320 --> 33:11.760
 that sort of forming representations

33:11.760 --> 33:14.960
 that are useful to be robust,

33:14.960 --> 33:17.320
 you know, for error correction kind of thing.

33:17.320 --> 33:20.880
 So this is kind of what the biology does

33:20.880 --> 33:22.320
 we're talking about.

33:22.320 --> 33:26.440
 Yeah, and what my paper did was simply enable you,

33:26.440 --> 33:29.960
 there are lots of ways of being robust.

33:34.120 --> 33:36.480
 If you think of a dynamical system,

33:36.480 --> 33:41.480
 you think of a system where a path is going on in time.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.840
 And if you think for a computer,

33:43.840 --> 33:45.240
 there's a computational path,

33:45.240 --> 33:48.480
 which is going on in a huge dimensional space

33:48.480 --> 33:49.800
 of ones and zeros.

33:51.720 --> 33:55.760
 And an error correction system is a system,

33:55.760 --> 33:58.720
 which if you get a little bit off that trajectory,

33:58.720 --> 34:00.960
 will push you back onto that trajectory again.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.160
 So you get to the same answer in spite of the fact

34:03.160 --> 34:04.720
 that there were things,

34:04.720 --> 34:07.480
 so that the computation wasn't being ideally done

34:07.480 --> 34:08.880
 all the way along the line.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.600
 And there are lots of models for error correction.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.120
 But one of the models for error correction is to say,

34:17.120 --> 34:20.800
 there's a valley that you're following, flowing down.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.960
 And if you push a little bit off the valley,

34:23.960 --> 34:26.600
 just like water being pushed a little bit by a rock,

34:26.600 --> 34:30.120
 it gets back and follows the course of the river.

34:30.120 --> 34:34.520
 And that basically the analog

34:35.760 --> 34:38.680
 in the physical system, which enables you to say,

34:38.680 --> 34:43.640
 oh yes, error free computation and an associative memory

34:43.640 --> 34:46.920
 are very much like things that I can understand

34:46.920 --> 34:49.400
 from the point of view of a physical system.

34:49.400 --> 34:54.400
 The physical system is, can be under some circumstances,

34:54.560 --> 34:55.960
 an accurate metaphor.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.520
 It's not the only metaphor.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.960
 There are error correction schemes,

35:01.960 --> 35:05.960
 which don't have a valley and energy behind them.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.120
 But those are error correction schemes,

35:09.120 --> 35:11.320
 which a mathematician may be able to understand,

35:11.320 --> 35:12.160
 but I don't.

35:13.880 --> 35:18.880
 So there's the physical metaphor that seems to work here.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.600
 That's right, that's right.

35:20.600 --> 35:25.600
 So these kinds of networks actually led to a lot of the work

35:26.520 --> 35:29.760
 that is going on now in neural networks,

35:29.760 --> 35:30.880
 artificial neural networks.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.800
 So the follow on work with restricted Boltzmann machines

35:34.800 --> 35:39.800
 and deep belief nets followed on from these ideas

35:40.760 --> 35:41.760
 of the Hopfield network.

35:41.760 --> 35:46.760
 So what do you think about this continued progress

35:46.760 --> 35:51.760
 of that work towards now re revigorated exploration

35:51.880 --> 35:54.360
 of feed forward neural networks

35:54.360 --> 35:55.720
 and recurrent neural networks

35:55.720 --> 35:57.280
 and convolutional neural networks

35:57.280 --> 36:01.520
 and kinds of networks that are helping solve

36:01.520 --> 36:03.840
 image recognition, natural language processing,

36:03.840 --> 36:05.000
 all that kind of stuff.

36:05.920 --> 36:09.720
 It always intrigued me that one of the most long lived

36:09.720 --> 36:14.000
 of the learning systems is the Boltzmann machine,

36:14.000 --> 36:17.240
 which is intrinsically a feedback network.

36:18.880 --> 36:23.880
 And with the brilliance of Hind and Sinowski

36:24.440 --> 36:26.760
 to understand how to do learning in that.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.720
 And it's still a useful way to understand learning

36:30.720 --> 36:34.760
 and the learning that you understand in that

36:34.760 --> 36:36.520
 has something to do with the way

36:36.520 --> 36:39.040
 that feed forward systems work.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.520
 But it's not always exactly simple

36:41.520 --> 36:44.360
 to express that intuition.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.080
 But it's always amuses me to see Hinton

36:49.080 --> 36:51.640
 going back to the will yet again

36:51.640 --> 36:53.240
 on a form of the Boltzmann machine

36:53.240 --> 36:58.240
 because really that which has feedback

36:59.120 --> 37:01.160
 and interesting probabilities in it

37:02.080 --> 37:05.760
 is a lovely encapsulation of something in computational.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.200
 Something computational?

37:09.200 --> 37:12.160
 Something both computational and physical.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.360
 Computational and it's very much related

37:15.360 --> 37:17.400
 to feed forward networks.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.720
 Physical in that Boltzmann machine learning

37:21.720 --> 37:24.880
 is really learning a set of parameters

37:24.880 --> 37:28.000
 for a physics Hamiltonian or energy function.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.440
 What do you think about learning in this whole domain?

37:32.440 --> 37:37.400
 Do you think the aforementioned guy,

37:37.400 --> 37:42.000
 Jeff Hinton, all the work there with backpropagation,

37:42.000 --> 37:46.120
 all the kind of learning that goes on in these networks,

37:49.600 --> 37:53.160
 if we compare it to learning in the brain, for example,

37:53.160 --> 37:55.520
 is there echoes of the same kind of power

37:55.520 --> 37:59.000
 that backpropagation reveals

37:59.000 --> 38:01.640
 about these kinds of recurrent networks?

38:01.640 --> 38:03.920
 Or is it something fundamentally different

38:03.920 --> 38:10.240
 going on in the brain?

38:10.240 --> 38:13.880
 I don't think the brain is as deep

38:13.880 --> 38:17.000
 as the deepest networks go,

38:17.000 --> 38:22.160
 the deepest computer science networks.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.240
 And I do wonder whether part of that depth

38:24.240 --> 38:28.280
 of the computer science networks is necessitated

38:28.280 --> 38:29.840
 by the fact that the only learning

38:29.840 --> 38:36.240
 that's easily done on a machine is feed forward.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.520
 And so there's the question of to what extent

38:39.520 --> 38:42.640
 is the biology, which has some feed forward

38:42.640 --> 38:46.040
 and some feed back,

38:46.040 --> 38:51.600
 been captured by something which has got many more neurons

38:51.600 --> 38:56.400
 but much more depth than the neurons in it.

38:56.400 --> 39:00.200
 So part of you wonders if the feedback is actually

39:00.200 --> 39:03.640
 more essential than the number of neurons or the depth,

39:03.640 --> 39:06.360
 the dynamics of the feedback.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.760
 The dynamics of the feedback.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.680
 Look, if you don't have feedback,

39:11.680 --> 39:14.600
 it's a little bit like a building a big computer

39:14.600 --> 39:17.800
 and running it through one clock cycle.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.160
 And then you can't do anything

39:19.160 --> 39:24.400
 until you reload something coming in.

39:24.400 --> 39:28.160
 How do you use the fact that there are multiple clock cycles?

39:28.160 --> 39:30.720
 How do I use the fact that you can close your eyes,

39:30.720 --> 39:33.800
 stop listening to me and think about a chessboard

39:33.800 --> 39:38.520
 for two minutes without any input whatsoever?

39:38.520 --> 39:42.440
 Yeah, that memory thing,

39:42.440 --> 39:45.960
 that's fundamentally a feedback kind of mechanism.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.480
 You're going back to something.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.920
 Yes, it's hard to understand.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.920
 It's hard to introspect,

39:53.920 --> 39:57.360
 let alone consciousness.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.080
 Oh, let alone consciousness, yes, yes.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.440
 Because that's tied up in there too.

40:02.440 --> 40:06.880
 You can't just put that on another shelf.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.720
 Every once in a while I get interested in consciousness

40:09.720 --> 40:12.800
 and then I go and I've done that for years

40:12.800 --> 40:17.120
 and ask one of my betters, as it were,

40:17.120 --> 40:18.640
 their view on consciousness.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.880
 It's been interesting collecting them.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.240
 What is consciousness?

40:25.240 --> 40:30.160
 Let's try to take a brief step into that room.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.320
 Well, ask Marvin Minsky,

40:32.320 --> 40:33.640
 his view on consciousness.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.400
 And Marvin said,

40:36.400 --> 40:40.440
 consciousness is basically overrated.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.800
 It may be an epiphenomenon.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.280
 After all, all the things your brain does,

40:45.280 --> 40:49.640
 but they're actually hard computations

40:49.640 --> 40:55.680
 you do nonconsciously.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.240
 And there's so much evidence

40:57.240 --> 41:00.840
 that even the simple things you do,

41:00.840 --> 41:03.280
 you can make decisions,

41:03.280 --> 41:05.680
 you can make committed decisions about them,

41:05.680 --> 41:07.320
 the neurobiologist can say,

41:07.320 --> 41:12.240
 he's now committed, he's going to move the hand left

41:12.240 --> 41:14.800
 before you know it.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.800
 So his view that consciousness is not,

41:16.800 --> 41:19.360
 that's just like little icing on the cake.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.400
 The real cake is in the subconscious.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.960
 Yum, yum.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.920
 Subconscious, nonconscious.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.560
 Nonconscious, what's the better word, sir?

41:27.560 --> 41:29.680
 It's only that Freud captured the other word.

41:29.680 --> 41:33.320
 Yeah, it's a confusing word, subconscious.

41:33.320 --> 41:38.080
 Nicholas Chaiter wrote an interesting book.

41:38.080 --> 41:44.920
 I think the title of it is The Mind is Flat.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.720
 Flat in a neural net sense, might be flat

41:49.720 --> 41:53.400
 as something which is a very broad neural net

41:53.400 --> 41:56.280
 without any layers in depth,

41:56.280 --> 41:58.400
 whereas a deep brain would be many layers

41:58.400 --> 42:00.800
 and not so broad.

42:00.800 --> 42:05.080
 In the same sense that if you push Minsky hard enough,

42:05.080 --> 42:07.840
 he would probably have said,

42:07.840 --> 42:12.840
 consciousness is your effort to explain to yourself

42:12.840 --> 42:16.800
 that which you have already done.

42:16.800 --> 42:20.000
 Yeah, it's the weaving of the narrative

42:20.000 --> 42:23.760
 around the things that have already been computed for you.

42:23.760 --> 42:27.560
 That's right, and so much of what we do

42:27.560 --> 42:32.080
 for our memories of events, for example.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.720
 If there's some traumatic event you witness,

42:35.720 --> 42:39.560
 you will have a few facts about it correctly done.

42:39.560 --> 42:42.960
 If somebody asks you about it, you will weave a narrative

42:42.960 --> 42:47.200
 which is actually much more rich in detail than that

42:47.200 --> 42:50.600
 based on some anchor points you have of correct things

42:50.600 --> 42:53.840
 and pulling together general knowledge on the other,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.680
 but you will have a narrative.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.280
 And once you generate that narrative,

42:58.280 --> 43:00.800
 you are very likely to repeat that narrative

43:00.800 --> 43:02.920
 and claim that all the things you have in it

43:02.920 --> 43:05.040
 are actually the correct things.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.840
 There was a marvelous example of that

43:06.840 --> 43:11.840
 in the Watergate slash impeachment era of John Dean.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.880
 John Dean, you're too young to know,

43:19.880 --> 43:23.960
 had been the personal lawyer of Nixon.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.760
 And so John Dean was involved in the coverup

43:28.760 --> 43:32.280
 and John Dean ultimately realized

43:32.280 --> 43:35.600
 the only way to keep himself out of jail for a long time

43:35.600 --> 43:38.760
 was actually to tell some of the truths about Nixon.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.080
 And John Dean was a tremendous witness.

43:41.080 --> 43:45.880
 He would remember these conversations in great detail

43:45.880 --> 43:48.280
 and very convincing detail.

43:49.280 --> 43:54.280
 And long afterward, some of the tapes,

43:54.880 --> 43:57.560
 the secret tapes as it were from which these,

43:57.560 --> 44:00.520
 Don was, Gene was recalling these conversations

44:01.600 --> 44:04.640
 were published, and one found out that John Dean

44:04.640 --> 44:07.160
 had a good but not exceptional memory.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.560
 What he had was an ability to paint vividly

44:10.560 --> 44:15.140
 and in some sense accurately the tone of what was going on.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.960
 By the way, that's a beautiful description of consciousness.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
 Do you, like where do you stand in your today?

44:32.520 --> 44:34.600
 So perhaps it changes day to day,

44:34.600 --> 44:37.680
 but where do you stand on the importance of consciousness

44:37.680 --> 44:39.860
 in our whole big mess of cognition?

44:42.080 --> 44:44.880
 Is it just a little narrative maker

44:45.740 --> 44:48.860
 or is it actually fundamental to intelligence?

44:51.280 --> 44:56.120
 That's a very hard one.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.760
 When I asked Francis Crick about consciousness,

45:00.640 --> 45:03.280
 he launched forward in a long monologue

45:03.280 --> 45:07.440
 about Mendel and the peas and how Mendel knew

45:07.440 --> 45:10.600
 that there was something and how biologists understood

45:10.600 --> 45:13.240
 that there was something in inheritance,

45:13.240 --> 45:16.240
 which was just very, very different.

45:16.240 --> 45:21.200
 And the fact that inherited traits didn't just wash out

45:21.200 --> 45:26.200
 into a gray, but this or this and propagated

45:27.980 --> 45:30.680
 that that was absolutely fundamental to the biology.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.380
 And it took generations of biologists to understand

45:34.380 --> 45:37.720
 that there was genetics and it took another generation

45:37.720 --> 45:42.080
 or two to understand that genetics came from DNA.

45:42.080 --> 45:47.080
 But very shortly after Mendel, thinking biologists

45:47.360 --> 45:50.920
 did realize that there was a deep problem about inheritance.

45:54.720 --> 45:58.240
 And Francis would have liked to have said,

45:58.240 --> 46:01.520
 and that's why I'm working on consciousness.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.960
 But of course, he didn't have any smoking gun

46:03.960 --> 46:05.360
 in the sense of Mendel.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.600
 And that's the weakness of his position.

46:10.600 --> 46:15.600
 If you read his book, which he wrote with Koch, I think.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.000
 Yeah, Christoph Koch, yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.660
 I find it unconvincing for the smoking gun reason.

46:22.660 --> 46:27.660
 So I'm going on collecting views without actually having taken

46:30.540 --> 46:32.700
 a very strong one myself,

46:32.700 --> 46:35.320
 because I haven't seen the entry point.

46:35.320 --> 46:38.300
 Not seeing the smoking gun from the point of view

46:38.300 --> 46:41.140
 of physics, I don't see the entry point.

46:41.140 --> 46:44.260
 Whereas in neurobiology, once I understood the idea

46:44.260 --> 46:48.860
 of a collective, an evolution of dynamics,

46:48.860 --> 46:52.180
 which could be described as a collective phenomenon,

46:52.180 --> 46:55.740
 I thought, ah, there's a point where what I know

46:55.740 --> 46:59.020
 about physics is so different from any neurobiologist

46:59.020 --> 47:01.740
 that I have something that I might be able to contribute.

47:01.740 --> 47:05.580
 And right now, there's no way to grasp at consciousness

47:05.580 --> 47:07.660
 from a physics perspective.

47:07.660 --> 47:09.720
 From my point of view, that's correct.

47:11.460 --> 47:16.460
 And of course, people, physicists, like everybody else,

47:16.980 --> 47:18.380
 think very muddily about things.

47:18.380 --> 47:23.380
 You ask the closely related question about free will.

47:23.780 --> 47:25.540
 Do you believe you have free will?

47:27.340 --> 47:30.180
 Physicists will give an offhand answer,

47:30.180 --> 47:32.620
 and then backtrack, backtrack, backtrack,

47:32.620 --> 47:34.820
 where they realize that the answer they gave

47:34.820 --> 47:37.540
 must fundamentally contradict the laws of physics.

47:38.420 --> 47:40.380
 Natural, answering questions of free will

47:40.380 --> 47:42.820
 and consciousness naturally lead to contradictions

47:42.820 --> 47:44.260
 from a physics perspective.

47:45.860 --> 47:48.080
 Because it eventually ends up with quantum mechanics,

47:48.080 --> 47:50.460
 and then you get into that whole mess

47:50.460 --> 47:54.760
 of trying to understand how much,

47:54.760 --> 47:58.400
 from a physics perspective, how much is determined,

47:58.400 --> 48:01.060
 already predetermined, how much is already deterministic

48:01.060 --> 48:03.460
 about our universe, and there's lots of different things.

48:03.460 --> 48:06.660
 And if you don't push quite that far, you can say,

48:07.560 --> 48:10.740
 essentially, all of neurobiology, which is relevant,

48:10.740 --> 48:13.740
 can be captured by classical equations of motion.

48:13.740 --> 48:18.740
 Right, because in my view of the mysteries of the brain

48:18.960 --> 48:22.160
 are not the mysteries of quantum mechanics,

48:22.160 --> 48:24.840
 but the mysteries of what can happen

48:24.840 --> 48:28.840
 when you have a dynamical system, driven system,

48:28.840 --> 48:30.680
 with 10 to the 14 parts.

48:32.260 --> 48:34.960
 That that complexity is something which is,

48:37.040 --> 48:39.620
 that the physics of complex systems

48:39.620 --> 48:42.040
 is at least as badly understood

48:42.040 --> 48:45.660
 as the physics of phase coherence in quantum mechanics.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.520
 Can we go there for a second?

48:48.520 --> 48:50.860
 You've talked about attractor networks,

48:51.720 --> 48:54.800
 and just maybe you could say what are attractor networks,

48:54.800 --> 48:58.600
 and more broadly, what are interesting network dynamics

48:58.600 --> 49:03.000
 that emerge in these or other complex systems?

49:05.260 --> 49:06.320
 You have to be willing to think

49:06.320 --> 49:08.720
 in a huge number of dimensions,

49:08.720 --> 49:11.000
 because in a huge number of dimensions,

49:11.000 --> 49:12.920
 the behavior of a system can be thought

49:12.920 --> 49:15.920
 as just the motion of a point over time

49:15.920 --> 49:17.760
 in this huge number of dimensions.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.340
 All right.

49:19.340 --> 49:22.080
 And an attractor network is simply a network

49:22.080 --> 49:25.920
 where there is a line and other lines

49:25.920 --> 49:28.320
 converge on it in time.

49:28.320 --> 49:31.160
 That's the essence of an attractor network.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.000
 That's how you.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.760
 In a highly dimensional space.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.400
 And the easiest way to get that

49:37.400 --> 49:40.760
 is to do it in a highly dimensional space,

49:40.760 --> 49:44.960
 where some of the dimensions provide the dissipation,

49:44.960 --> 49:49.240
 which, if I have a physical system,

49:50.160 --> 49:53.680
 trajectories can't contract everywhere.

49:53.680 --> 49:56.920
 They have to contract in some places and expand in others.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.360
 There's a fundamental classical theorem

49:59.360 --> 50:00.840
 of statistical mechanics,

50:00.840 --> 50:04.560
 which goes under the name of Liouville's theorem,

50:04.560 --> 50:08.600
 which says you can't contract everywhere.

50:08.600 --> 50:12.400
 If you contract somewhere, you expand somewhere else.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.240
 In interesting physical systems,

50:15.240 --> 50:17.480
 you've got driven systems

50:17.480 --> 50:19.240
 where you have a small subsystem,

50:19.240 --> 50:21.720
 which is the interesting part.

50:21.720 --> 50:24.120
 And the rest of the contraction and expansion,

50:24.120 --> 50:26.000
 the physicists would say it's entropy flow

50:26.000 --> 50:27.640
 in this other part of the system.

50:30.880 --> 50:35.520
 But basically, attractor networks are dynamics

50:35.520 --> 50:40.360
 that are funneling down so that you can't be any,

50:40.360 --> 50:42.520
 so that if you start somewhere in the dynamical system,

50:42.520 --> 50:44.120
 you will soon find yourself

50:44.120 --> 50:47.120
 on a pretty well determined pathway, which goes somewhere.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.120
 If you start somewhere else,

50:48.120 --> 50:50.560
 you'll wind up on a different pathway,

50:50.560 --> 50:53.080
 but I don't have just all possible things.

50:53.080 --> 50:56.640
 You have some defined pathways which are allowed

50:56.640 --> 50:58.840
 and onto which you will converge.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.920
 And that's the way you make a stable computer,

51:01.920 --> 51:06.280
 and that's the way you make a stable behavior.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.760
 So in general, looking at the physics

51:08.760 --> 51:13.760
 of the emergent stability in networks,

51:15.200 --> 51:18.160
 what are some interesting characteristics that,

51:19.640 --> 51:20.960
 what are some interesting insights

51:20.960 --> 51:24.960
 from studying the dynamics of such high dimensional systems?

51:24.960 --> 51:29.880
 Most dynamical systems, most driven dynamical systems,

51:29.880 --> 51:33.200
 are driven, they're coupled somehow to an energy source.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.600
 And so their dynamics keeps going

51:35.600 --> 51:37.800
 because it's coupling to the energy source.

51:40.080 --> 51:42.680
 Most of them, it's very difficult to understand at all

51:42.680 --> 51:46.560
 what the dynamical behavior is going to be.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.240
 You have to run it.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.600
 You have to run it.

51:50.600 --> 51:54.080
 There's a subset of systems which has

51:54.080 --> 51:57.280
 what is actually known to the mathematicians

51:57.280 --> 52:02.000
 as a Lyapunov function, and those systems,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.520
 you can understand convergent dynamics

52:05.520 --> 52:08.960
 by saying you're going downhill on something or other.

52:10.640 --> 52:13.560
 And that's what I found with ever knowing

52:13.560 --> 52:17.120
 what Lyapunov functions were in the simple model

52:17.120 --> 52:20.480
 I made in the early 80s, was an energy function

52:20.480 --> 52:23.200
 so you could understand how you could get this channeling

52:23.200 --> 52:28.080
 on the pathways without having to follow the dynamics

52:28.080 --> 52:30.040
 in infinite detail.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.320
 You started rolling a ball at the top of a mountain,

52:34.320 --> 52:36.480
 it's gonna wind up at the bottom of a valley.

52:36.480 --> 52:40.440
 You know that's true without actually watching

52:40.440 --> 52:42.080
 the ball roll down.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.840
 There's certain properties of the system

52:45.840 --> 52:48.360
 that when you can know that.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.400
 That's right.

52:49.400 --> 52:53.640
 And not all systems behave that way.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.240
 Most don't, probably.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.720
 Most don't, but it provides you with a metaphor

52:57.720 --> 53:00.720
 for thinking about systems which are stable

53:00.720 --> 53:03.880
 and who to have these attractors behave

53:03.880 --> 53:07.920
 even if you can't find a Lyapunov function behind them

53:07.920 --> 53:09.880
 or an energy function behind them.

53:09.880 --> 53:11.680
 It gives you a metaphor for thought.

53:11.680 --> 53:16.680
 Yeah, speaking of thought,

53:17.200 --> 53:21.000
 if I had a glint in my eye with excitement

53:21.000 --> 53:25.600
 and said I'm really excited about this something

53:25.600 --> 53:28.440
 called deep learning and neural networks

53:28.440 --> 53:32.440
 and I would like to create an intelligent system

53:32.440 --> 53:37.440
 and came to you as an advisor, what would you recommend?

53:37.440 --> 53:42.440
 Is it a hopeless pursuit to use neural networks

53:42.840 --> 53:44.060
 to achieve thought?

53:44.920 --> 53:48.760
 Is it, what kind of mechanisms should we explore?

53:48.760 --> 53:50.600
 What kind of ideas should we explore?

53:52.040 --> 53:56.560
 Well, you look at the simple networks,

53:56.560 --> 53:58.180
 the one past networks.

54:01.320 --> 54:04.760
 They don't support multiple hypotheses very well.

54:04.760 --> 54:05.600
 Hmm.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.960
 As I have tried to work with very simple systems

54:09.960 --> 54:12.960
 which do something which you might consider to be thinking,

54:12.960 --> 54:17.680
 thought has to do with the ability to do mental exploration

54:17.680 --> 54:20.040
 before you take a physical action.

54:22.440 --> 54:25.480
 Almost like we were mentioning, playing chess,

54:25.480 --> 54:30.440
 visualizing, simulating inside your head different outcomes.

54:30.440 --> 54:31.400
 Yeah, yeah.

54:31.400 --> 54:36.400
 And now you would do that in a feed forward network

54:37.400 --> 54:40.540
 because you've pre calculated all kinds of things.

54:41.960 --> 54:44.080
 But I think the way neurobiology does it

54:44.080 --> 54:47.820
 hasn't pre calculated everything.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.000
 It actually has parts of a dynamical system

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
 in which you're doing exploration in a way which is.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.760
 There's a creative element.

55:01.760 --> 55:02.600
 Like there's an.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.680
 There's a creative element.

55:04.680 --> 55:09.680
 And in a simple minded neural net,

55:13.000 --> 55:18.000
 you have a constellation of instances

55:20.080 --> 55:21.280
 of which you've learned.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.760
 And if you are within that space,

55:25.760 --> 55:30.760
 if a new question is a question within this space,

55:32.800 --> 55:37.520
 you can actually rely on that system pretty well

55:37.520 --> 55:41.040
 to come up with a good suggestion for what to do.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.000
 If on the other hand,

55:42.000 --> 55:45.120
 the query comes from outside the space,

55:46.640 --> 55:48.440
 you have no way of knowing how the system

55:48.440 --> 55:49.280
 is gonna behave.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.440
 There are no limitations on what can happen.

55:51.440 --> 55:55.300
 And so with the artificial neural net world

55:55.300 --> 55:57.080
 is always very much,

55:57.080 --> 56:01.020
 I have a population of examples.

56:01.020 --> 56:04.740
 The test set must be drawn from the equivalent population.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.860
 If the test set has examples,

56:06.860 --> 56:09.920
 which are from a population which is completely different,

56:11.100 --> 56:14.420
 there's no way that you could expect

56:14.420 --> 56:16.500
 to get the answer right.

56:16.500 --> 56:20.980
 Yeah, what they call outside the distribution.

56:20.980 --> 56:22.180
 That's right, that's right.

56:22.180 --> 56:27.180
 And so if you see a ball rolling across the street at dusk,

56:28.420 --> 56:33.300
 if that wasn't in your training set,

56:33.300 --> 56:37.060
 the idea that a child may be coming close behind that

56:37.060 --> 56:39.060
 is not going to occur to the neural net.

56:40.420 --> 56:42.500
 And it is to our,

56:42.500 --> 56:45.580
 there's something in your biology that allows that.

56:45.580 --> 56:47.620
 Yeah, there's something in the way

56:47.620 --> 56:52.300
 of what it means to be outside of the population

56:52.300 --> 56:53.620
 of the training set.

56:53.620 --> 56:55.580
 The population of the training set

56:55.580 --> 56:57.940
 isn't just sort of this set of examples.

57:01.180 --> 57:03.660
 There's more to it than that.

57:03.660 --> 57:06.540
 And it gets back to my question of,

57:06.540 --> 57:09.180
 what is it to understand something?

57:09.180 --> 57:10.020
 Yeah.

57:12.020 --> 57:14.700
 You know, in a small tangent,

57:14.700 --> 57:16.940
 you've talked about the value of thinking

57:16.940 --> 57:18.660
 of deductive reasoning in science

57:18.660 --> 57:20.800
 versus large data collection.

57:21.820 --> 57:25.300
 So sort of thinking about the problem.

57:25.300 --> 57:27.460
 I suppose it's the physics side of you

57:27.460 --> 57:31.100
 of going back to first principles and thinking,

57:31.100 --> 57:33.660
 but what do you think is the value of deductive reasoning

57:33.660 --> 57:35.480
 in the scientific process?

57:37.740 --> 57:39.820
 Well, there are obviously scientific questions

57:39.820 --> 57:42.980
 in which the route to the answer to it

57:42.980 --> 57:46.560
 comes through the analysis of one hell of a lot of data.

57:46.560 --> 57:47.400
 Right.

57:49.180 --> 57:50.500
 Cosmology, that kind of stuff.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.300
 And that's never been the kind of problem

57:56.700 --> 57:58.540
 in which I've had any particular insight.

57:58.540 --> 58:00.240
 Though I must say, if you look at,

58:01.660 --> 58:04.180
 cosmology is one of those.

58:04.180 --> 58:06.780
 If you look at the actual things that Jim Peebles,

58:06.780 --> 58:10.140
 one of this year's Nobel Prize in physics,

58:10.140 --> 58:12.260
 ones from the local physics department,

58:12.260 --> 58:13.760
 the kinds of things he's done,

58:13.760 --> 58:17.000
 he's never crunched large data.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.140
 Never, never, never.

58:19.640 --> 58:23.760
 He's used the encapsulation of the work of others

58:23.760 --> 58:25.240
 in this regard.

58:25.240 --> 58:26.080
 Right.

58:27.820 --> 58:30.840
 But it ultimately boiled down to thinking

58:30.840 --> 58:31.700
 through the problem.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.680
 Like what are the principles under which

58:33.680 --> 58:35.840
 a particular phenomenon operates?

58:35.840 --> 58:37.240
 Yeah, yeah.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.520
 And look, physics is always going to look

58:39.520 --> 58:42.640
 for ways in which you can describe the system

58:42.640 --> 58:47.520
 in a way which rises above the details.

58:47.520 --> 58:52.520
 And to the hard dyed, the wool biologist,

58:53.840 --> 58:56.760
 biology works because of the details.

58:56.760 --> 58:58.720
 In physics, to the physicists,

58:58.720 --> 59:01.160
 we want an explanation which is right

59:01.160 --> 59:03.040
 in spite of the details.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.560
 And there will be questions which we cannot answer

59:05.560 --> 59:13.080
 as physicists because the answer cannot be found that way.

59:13.080 --> 59:15.240
 There's, I'm not sure if you're familiar

59:15.240 --> 59:19.120
 with the entire field of brain computer interfaces

59:19.120 --> 59:24.040
 that's become more and more intensely researched

59:24.040 --> 59:25.920
 and developed recently, especially with companies

59:25.920 --> 59:28.160
 like Neuralink with Elon Musk.

59:29.080 --> 59:31.080
 Yeah, I know there have always been the interests

59:31.080 --> 59:35.720
 both in things like getting the eyes

59:35.720 --> 59:38.320
 to be able to control things

59:38.320 --> 59:40.800
 or getting the thought patterns

59:40.800 --> 59:45.080
 to be able to move what had been a connected limb

59:45.080 --> 59:48.040
 which is now connected through a computer.

59:48.040 --> 59:48.920
 That's right.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.320
 So in the case of Neuralink,

59:51.320 --> 59:54.600
 they're doing 1,000 plus connections

59:54.600 --> 59:56.640
 where they're able to do two way,

59:56.640 --> 1:00:01.440
 activate and read spikes, neural spikes.

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:06.200
 Do you have hope for that kind of computer brain interaction

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:08.440
 in the near or maybe even far future

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:13.400
 of being able to expand the ability

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:18.920
 of the mind of cognition or understand the mind?

1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:23.760
 It's interesting watching things go.

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:27.080
 When I first became interested in neurobiology,

1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:29.400
 most of the practitioners thought you would be able

1:00:29.400 --> 1:00:32.360
 to understand neurobiology by techniques

1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:36.640
 which allowed you to record only one cell at a time.

1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:38.600
 One cell, yeah.

1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:43.320
 People like David Hubel,

1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:45.760
 very strongly reflected that point of view.

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:50.560
 And that's been taken over by a generation,

1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:52.440
 a couple of generations later,

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:56.160
 by a set of people who says not until we can record

1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:59.320
 from 10 to the four, 10 to the five at a time,

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:00.840
 will we actually be able to understand

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:03.360
 how the brain actually works.

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:08.360
 And in a general sense, I think that's right.

1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:11.640
 You have to begin to be able to look

1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:17.840
 for the collective modes, the collective operations of things.

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.240
 It doesn't rely on this action potential or that cell.

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.400
 It relies on the collective properties of this set of cells

1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:26.760
 connected with this kind of patterns and so on.

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:29.960
 And you're not going to succeed in seeing

1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:31.840
 what those collective activities are

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:34.360
 without recording many cells at once.

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:40.200
 The question is how many at once?

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:41.520
 What's the threshold?

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:42.960
 And that's the...

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.240
 Yeah, and look, it's being pursued hard

1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:48.320
 in the motor cortex.

1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:53.320
 The motor cortex does something which is complex,

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:55.640
 and yet the problem you're trying to address

1:01:55.640 --> 1:01:57.400
 is fairly simple.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.920
 Now, neurobiology does it in ways that differ

1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:04.360
 from the way an engineer would do it.

1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:09.360
 An engineer would put in six highly accurate stepping motors

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:15.080
 are controlling a limb rather than 100,000 muscle fibers,

1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:19.320
 each of which has to be individually controlled.

1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:22.720
 And so understanding how to do things in a way

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:26.720
 which is much more forgiving and much more neural,

1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:30.760
 I think would benefit the engineering world.

1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:36.040
 The engineering world, a touch.

1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:38.080
 Let's put in a pressure sensor or two,

1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:42.800
 rather than an array of a gazillion pressure sensors,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.120
 none of which are accurate,

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:47.480
 all of which are perpetually recalibrating themselves.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:50.840
 So you're saying your hope is,

1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:53.600
 your advice for the engineers of the future

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:58.600
 is to embrace the large chaos of a messy, air prone system

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:03.520
 like those of the biological systems.

1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:05.840
 Like that's probably the way to solve some of these.

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:10.640
 I think you'll be able to make better computations

1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:15.640
 slash robotics that way than by trying to force things

1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:22.320
 into a robotics where joint motors are powerful

1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:25.360
 and stepping motors are accurate.

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:27.960
 But then the physicists, the physicist in you

1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:31.280
 will be lost forever in such systems

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:33.720
 because there's no simple fundamentals to explore

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:38.240
 in systems that are so large and messy.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:43.240
 Well, you say that, and yet there's a lot of physics

1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:45.440
 in the Navier Stokes equations,

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:49.800
 the equations of nonlinear hydrodynamics,

1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:51.480
 huge amount of physics in them.

1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:55.560
 All the physics of atoms and molecules has been lost,

1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:58.320
 but it's been replaced by this other set of equations,

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:02.240
 which is just as true as the equations at the bottom.

1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:06.760
 Now those equations are going to be harder to find

1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:10.880
 in general biology, but the physicist in me says

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:13.440
 there are probably some equations of that sort.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.840
 They're out there.

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.160
 They're out there, and if physics

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:19.400
 is going to contribute anything,

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:22.120
 it may contribute to trying to find out

1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:24.360
 what those equations are and how to capture them

1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:25.540
 from the biology.

1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:29.760
 Would you say that's one of the main open problems

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:34.280
 of our age is to discover those equations?

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:38.720
 Yeah, if you look at, there's molecules

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.940
 and there's psychological behavior,

1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:45.600
 and these two are somehow related.

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:50.600
 They're layers of detail, they're layers of collectiveness,

1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:54.680
 and to capture that in some vague way,

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:01.320
 several stages on the way up to see how these things

1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:04.000
 can actually be linked together.

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.880
 So it seems in our universe, there's a lot of elegant

1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:11.080
 equations that can describe the fundamental way

1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:13.440
 that things behave, which is a surprise.

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:15.800
 I mean, it's compressible into equations.

1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:20.760
 It's simple and beautiful, but it's still an open question

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:25.760
 whether that link is equally between molecules

1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:29.400
 and the brain is equally compressible

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.080
 into elegant equations.

1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:36.080
 But your sense, well, you're both a physicist

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:38.440
 and a dreamer, you have a sense that...

1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:42.360
 Yeah, but I can only dream physics dreams.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.240
 Physics dreams.

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.840
 There was an interesting book called Einstein's Dreams,

1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:51.840
 which alternates between chapters on his life

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:57.240
 and descriptions of the way time might have been but isn't.

1:05:57.240 --> 1:06:02.240
 The linking between these being important ideas

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:06.400
 that Einstein might have had to think about

1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:09.440
 the essence of time as he was thinking about time.

1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:14.760
 So speaking of the essence of time in your biology,

1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:18.640
 you're one human, famous, impactful human,

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:22.620
 but just one human with a brain living the human condition.

1:06:22.620 --> 1:06:27.580
 But you're ultimately mortal, just like all of us.

1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:30.540
 Has studying the mind as a mechanism

1:06:30.540 --> 1:06:33.440
 changed the way you think about your own mortality?

1:06:38.620 --> 1:06:41.900
 It has, really, because particularly as you get older

1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:44.920
 and the body comes apart in various ways,

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:52.040
 I became much more aware of the fact

1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:57.040
 that what is somebody is contained in the brain

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.540
 and not in the body that you worry about burying.

1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:07.840
 And it is to a certain extent true

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:10.520
 that for people who write things down,

1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:15.520
 equations, dreams, notepads, diaries,

1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:18.840
 fractions of their thought does continue to live

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:20.640
 after they're dead and gone,

1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:22.440
 after their body is dead and gone.

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:29.440
 And there's a sea change in that going on in my lifetime

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:33.880
 between when my father died, except for the things

1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:37.000
 which were actually written by him, as it were.

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.880
 Very few facts about him will have ever been recorded.

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:42.880
 And the number of facts which are recorded

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:46.880
 about each and every one of us, forever now,

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:51.080
 as far as I can see, in the digital world.

1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:54.080
 And so the whole question of what is death

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:00.920
 may be different for people a generation ago

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:04.120
 and a generation further ahead.

1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:07.760
 Maybe we have become immortal under some definitions.

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:09.320
 Yeah, yeah.

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:14.320
 Last easy question, what is the meaning of life?

1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:22.840
 Looking back, you've studied the mind,

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:26.320
 us weird descendants of apes.

1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:31.640
 What's the meaning of our existence on this little earth?

1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:36.640
 What's the meaning of our existence on this little earth?

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:43.920
 Oh, that word meaning is as slippery as the word understand.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.120
 Interconnected somehow, perhaps.

1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:55.280
 Is there, it's slippery, but is there something

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:58.320
 that you, despite being slippery,

1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:03.320
 can hold long enough to express?

1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:05.640
 I've been amazed at how hard it is

1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:12.240
 to define the things in a living system

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:17.400
 in the sense that one hydrogen atom

1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:19.400
 is pretty much like another,

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:24.200
 but one bacterium is not so much like another bacterium,

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:26.120
 even of the same nominal species.

1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.840
 In fact, the whole notion of what is the species

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:30.320
 gets a little bit fuzzy.

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:33.600
 And do species exist in the absence

1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:36.120
 of certain classes of environments?

1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:40.200
 And pretty soon one winds up with a biology

1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.400
 which the whole thing is living,

1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:45.960
 but whether there's actually any element of it

1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:49.640
 which by itself would be said to be living

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.240
 becomes a little bit vague in my mind.

1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.200
 So in a sense, the idea of meaning

1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:01.200
 is something that's possessed by an individual,

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.080
 like a conscious creature.

1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:07.400
 And you're saying that it's all interconnected

1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:09.640
 in some kind of way that there might not even

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:10.640
 be an individual.

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:14.080
 We're all kind of this complicated mess

1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:17.400
 of biological systems at all different levels

1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:20.560
 where the human starts and when the human ends is unclear.

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:25.560
 Yeah, yeah, and we're in neurobiology where the,

1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:27.880
 oh, you say the neocortex is the thinking,

1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:31.240
 but there's lots of things that are done on the spinal cord.

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:35.680
 And so where's the essence of thought?

1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:37.760
 Is it just gonna be neocortex?

1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:39.360
 Can't be, can't be.

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:43.440
 Yeah, maybe to understand and to build thought

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:47.360
 you have to build the universe along with the neocortex.

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:51.400
 It's all interlinked through the spinal cord.

1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:54.400
 John, it's a huge honor talking today.

1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:55.840
 Thank you so much for your time.

1:10:55.840 --> 1:10:57.160
 I really appreciate it.

1:10:57.160 --> 1:10:59.120
 Well, thank you for the challenge of talking with you.

 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:43.200
 from John Hopfield in his article titled, Now What?

1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:46.280
 Choosing problems is the primary determinant

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:49.080
 of what one accomplishes in science.

1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:52.080
 I have generally had a relatively short attention span

1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:53.560
 in science problems.

1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:56.000
 Thus, I have always been on the lookout

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.760
 for more interesting questions,

1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:00.000
 either as my present ones get worked out

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.440
 or as they get classified by me as intractable,

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:05.240
 given my particular talents.

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.520
 He then goes on to say,

1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:11.200
 what I have done in science relies entirely

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:15.080
 on experimental and theoretical studies by experts.

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.960
 I have a great respect for them,

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:19.360
 especially for those who are willing to attempt

1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:23.080
 communication with someone who is not an expert in the field.

1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:26.440
 I would only add that experts are good

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.360
 at answering questions.

1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:32.000
 If you're brash enough, ask your own.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.280
 Don't worry too much about how you found them.

1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:40.560
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
