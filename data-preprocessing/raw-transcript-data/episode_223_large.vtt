00:00.000 --> 00:03.180
 The following is a conversation with Travis Stevens,

00:03.180 --> 00:06.340
 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo

00:06.340 --> 00:09.620
 and one of the greatest American Judo ever.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.260
 But his story is inspiring,

00:11.260 --> 00:13.280
 not because of that Olympic medal,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.180
 but because of the decades of injury, hardship,

00:16.180 --> 00:18.740
 incredible battles against the best in the world,

00:18.740 --> 00:20.900
 wrapping up in close heartbreaking losses

00:20.900 --> 00:23.580
 at the 2008 and 2012 games,

00:23.580 --> 00:27.300
 all of which eventually led to that very silver medal

00:27.300 --> 00:29.300
 in 2016.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.180
 As we talk about in the podcast,

00:31.180 --> 00:34.260
 Travis is also someone who's largely responsible

00:34.260 --> 00:35.900
 for me getting into Judo,

00:35.900 --> 00:38.420
 for which I will forever be grateful.

00:38.420 --> 00:42.620
 He also happens to be now my Judo coach and mentor.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.340
 I'll release a video of Travis and I

00:44.340 --> 00:46.740
 doing some Judo in a few days.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.060
 To support this podcast,

00:48.060 --> 00:50.460
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.780
 As a side note, let me say a few words

00:53.780 --> 00:57.140
 that I've written down about the Olympic games

00:57.140 --> 00:59.500
 and the International Olympics Committee.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.340
 I'm visiting family as the T shirt,

01:03.220 --> 01:06.620
 but I had to pull away to write and to say these words

01:06.620 --> 01:10.660
 because this very video was taken down by YouTube

01:10.660 --> 01:13.860
 as per the request of the IOC.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.340
 You know it's serious when a Russian takes time away

01:16.340 --> 01:18.340
 from family, food and drink.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.940
 I'm heartbroken to see continued incompetence,

01:21.940 --> 01:24.740
 greed and corruption on the part of the IOC

01:24.740 --> 01:27.780
 in failing to do as the Olympic charter states,

01:27.780 --> 01:31.100
 to quote, ensure the fullest coverage

01:31.100 --> 01:33.660
 and the widest possible audience in the world

01:33.660 --> 01:36.020
 for the Olympic games, end quote.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.820
 I want to give you two facts.

01:38.820 --> 01:41.980
 First, they do not make most of the videos of the games

01:41.980 --> 01:45.520
 available for replay anywhere that is accessible,

01:45.520 --> 01:47.340
 searchable and discoverable,

01:47.340 --> 01:50.020
 whether funded by ads or by subscriptions.

01:50.020 --> 01:53.300
 For example, on YouTube or their own service,

01:53.300 --> 01:56.380
 it is not available anywhere.

01:56.380 --> 02:00.220
 Second, in the most absurd violation of the Olympic charter,

02:00.220 --> 02:05.060
 they've uploaded all of the videos of the 2012, 2016

02:05.060 --> 02:09.860
 and the 2020 slash 21 Olympics to YouTube.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.100
 And they set all of these videos to private.

02:14.220 --> 02:17.260
 This results in a situation like my four hour conversation

02:17.260 --> 02:19.300
 that you're watching now with Travis Stevens

02:19.300 --> 02:22.780
 being taken down due to us including a few seconds

02:22.780 --> 02:26.280
 of a small video overlay of Travis's epic match

02:26.280 --> 02:28.540
 against Ole Bischoff in 2012.

02:28.540 --> 02:32.180
 This is done automatically as per the request of the IOC.

02:32.180 --> 02:36.540
 I have the video due to having screen recorded it from 2012.

02:36.540 --> 02:40.620
 Here you have Travis Stevens, an Olympic silver medalist,

02:40.620 --> 02:43.820
 someone who spent his entire life overcoming injuries,

02:43.820 --> 02:47.540
 losses, hard weight cuts, periods of no financial

02:47.540 --> 02:49.740
 or psychological support culminating

02:49.740 --> 02:54.580
 in the biggest heartbreak of his career in this one match.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.460
 And this match is available nowhere online,

02:57.460 --> 02:59.540
 not for free, not for $1 million.

03:00.900 --> 03:04.140
 Our showing short clips of it results in the IOC

03:04.140 --> 03:06.640
 taking it down, not demonetizing it,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.200
 taking it down, blocking it.

03:09.200 --> 03:13.100
 The IOC silences this amazing story of Travis Stevens

03:13.100 --> 03:16.700
 of heartbreak that eventually led to triumph.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.900
 And there are thousands of stories like it,

03:18.900 --> 03:21.820
 stories that are supposed to inspire the world.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.460
 To me and to billions of others,

03:24.460 --> 03:26.740
 the Olympic games give a chance to celebrate

03:26.740 --> 03:29.380
 and to be inspired by the greatest stories

03:29.380 --> 03:32.180
 of human flourishing in the face of hardship

03:32.180 --> 03:34.980
 and incredibly long odds or dominance

03:34.980 --> 03:36.300
 in the pursuit of perfection

03:36.300 --> 03:39.260
 at levels previously thought to be impossible.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.660
 The Olympic games inspire kids like me to dream

03:43.660 --> 03:46.160
 and to work hard to achieve in our own lives

03:46.160 --> 03:49.100
 the same moments of magic and greatness,

03:49.100 --> 03:53.580
 small or big, that the Olympic games reveal.

03:53.580 --> 03:57.140
 I believe the members of the IOC are good people,

03:57.140 --> 03:59.980
 but people who forgot the dream,

03:59.980 --> 04:03.260
 the fire that was sparked and burned in their hearts

04:03.260 --> 04:06.040
 when they first saw the Olympics as kids.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.420
 They've allowed the gradual corruption

04:08.420 --> 04:10.420
 of their own human spirit

04:10.420 --> 04:13.900
 and thereby have robbed the world of this very fire,

04:13.900 --> 04:16.180
 the fire of the Olympic torch,

04:16.180 --> 04:19.380
 the fire that ought to burn in the eyes and hearts of kids

04:19.380 --> 04:21.240
 watching the Olympics today,

04:21.240 --> 04:24.540
 daring to dream, daring to be great.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.820
 Please, please do better.

04:27.820 --> 04:31.340
 The world needs you, the world needs the Olympic games.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.660
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast

04:35.660 --> 04:38.940
 and here's my conversation with Travis Stevens.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.480
 Judo is a martial arts, a sport,

04:42.480 --> 04:45.100
 a set of techniques, ideas, and philosophies.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.620
 Can we start by maybe you giving a big picture overview

04:48.620 --> 04:52.440
 of what is Judo to somebody who's like outside

04:52.440 --> 04:54.780
 the whole spectrum of grappling sports?

04:54.780 --> 04:57.820
 Yeah, Judo was originated in Japan

04:57.820 --> 05:02.060
 that was used as a police tactic for self defense

05:02.060 --> 05:05.180
 and subduing people.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.980
 It's the art of being able to throw somebody to the ground

05:07.980 --> 05:10.420
 and hold and control the situation.

05:10.420 --> 05:14.060
 I think it's pretty much evolved since then though.

05:14.060 --> 05:17.780
 You know, it's as you include like the sport aspect of it,

05:17.780 --> 05:22.420
 it's grown to be something more and more dynamic

05:22.420 --> 05:25.040
 and it's kind of gotten away from that.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.980
 So the basics is people wear something called a gi,

05:28.980 --> 05:33.260
 which I think nicely mimics like outdoor clothing,

05:33.260 --> 05:37.080
 like a jacket and they start on the feet

05:37.080 --> 05:40.760
 and they get to grip each other

05:40.760 --> 05:45.040
 and the scoring works by the more badass the throw is,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.440
 the more points you get,

05:46.440 --> 05:51.440
 and if you throw the person big and hard on their back,

05:52.800 --> 05:55.600
 you win the match and it's over and that's called an Ippon.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.200
 Yeah, which is equivalent to a knockout.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.120
 So I guess there's no knockdowns in Judo.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.120
 We don't count those.

06:02.120 --> 06:02.960
 Yeah.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.880
 They gotta hit their back and they gotta hit it with force.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.900
 And so there's a huge incentive for the big throws.

06:08.900 --> 06:09.740
 Yeah.

06:09.740 --> 06:14.740
 And there's also the drama of somebody catching you off guard

06:15.600 --> 06:17.900
 with a surprise big throw and it's over.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.120
 Yep, there's two ways of losing really.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.280
 There's the, I saw this coming, right?

06:25.280 --> 06:29.300
 Like you just, you see it, but you can't stop it.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.980
 And those ones tend to be the ones you can live with.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.120
 The ones that are like really hard to live with

06:35.120 --> 06:37.320
 are the ones you never saw coming, right?

06:37.320 --> 06:39.640
 Cause that just shows that that person

06:39.640 --> 06:41.440
 has really outclassed you.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.760
 Right, so there's like a set of, a small set of throws.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.240
 Maybe we can go through them that are like,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.920
 you saw it coming, but you couldn't do anything about it.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.640
 And then there's the set of throws

06:51.640 --> 06:53.560
 that are more like surprises.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.360
 So first of all, the counters,

06:55.360 --> 06:58.440
 or if you fake one thing and go the other way,

06:58.440 --> 07:00.600
 then that's a surprise and it's like, oh shit.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.560
 You off balance the person because they think

07:03.560 --> 07:05.200
 you're going one way and then you go the other way.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.640
 And then there's this, oh shit moment.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.400
 All of a sudden your back is just slammed on the ground.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.560
 One of the ones, I mean, you're good at many throws,

07:12.560 --> 07:15.880
 but one of them is a, that I think reveals

07:15.880 --> 07:19.640
 the beauty of judo is the foot sweep.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.920
 There's something about the off balance and the timing

07:21.920 --> 07:24.440
 that if you catch them right, all of a sudden,

07:24.440 --> 07:26.840
 it's like I had the same feeling when I went skydiving,

07:26.840 --> 07:29.620
 like all of a sudden the ground is not under you anymore.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.420
 Yeah, and you just, you go weightlessness

07:31.420 --> 07:33.320
 for like a split second and you realize

07:33.320 --> 07:35.880
 you've lost like all control of your limbs.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.480
 Like it's like zero gravity, right?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.680
 Like you just, you can't turn, you can't rotate,

07:40.680 --> 07:42.160
 you can't do much of anything.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.080
 And then before you know it, you've hit the floor.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.120
 Yeah.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.120
 It's a cool feeling when you get thrown

07:49.180 --> 07:51.760
 because you hope to do the same thing to another person.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.720
 It's like, you just hit the ground hard

07:54.720 --> 07:56.440
 because it's not, you didn't see it coming.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.880
 It wasn't a big throw that got loaded up.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.360
 It's like all of a sudden the surprise.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.020
 And then like this, like feeling your back just slams

08:06.020 --> 08:07.760
 and there's like the air is up.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.960
 Yeah, and the worst is when you get hit twice

08:09.960 --> 08:11.080
 with one throw, right?

08:11.080 --> 08:14.040
 Because sometimes like the guy throwing you

08:14.040 --> 08:15.360
 didn't expect you to leave either.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.760
 So you hit and then that guy comes down

08:17.760 --> 08:21.000
 like a second and a half later and it's like, boom, boom.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.840
 And then the wind is just gone from you.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.160
 Yeah.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.040
 Those are the worst.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.740
 And then there's the disappointment.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.480
 Like then the intellectual, the cognitive part comes in

08:30.480 --> 08:32.220
 where you're like, oh shit, I just lost.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.060
 Yep.

08:33.060 --> 08:37.120
 And you don't have like a connection to why, right?

08:37.120 --> 08:38.140
 It's almost like you've just,

08:38.140 --> 08:39.800
 like you didn't literally get a concussion.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.040
 Like you understand and remember everything,

08:43.040 --> 08:46.820
 but you can't figure out how this just happened, right?

08:46.820 --> 08:49.160
 Those are the tough ones to deal with.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.600
 Actually, have you had moments like that

08:51.600 --> 08:53.160
 where you don't understand how it happened?

08:53.160 --> 08:55.040
 You have to watch footage to understand what happened?

08:55.040 --> 08:58.640
 Even when you watch it, you're just like, I don't get it.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.280
 Like, why wasn't I in a position to stop this?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.020
 It makes zero sense.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.460
 Conceptually, when you watch it, you're like,

09:08.460 --> 09:10.520
 I understand how to play defense.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.760
 I understand, it looks like I'm in a defensive position,

09:14.760 --> 09:18.520
 but at the end of the day, I still got thrown.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.880
 Yeah, you were talking about, what is it, a 2008 match.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.040
 You have a non traditional gripping style.

09:26.040 --> 09:26.860
 Yeah.

09:26.860 --> 09:27.700
 Is that accurate to say?

09:27.700 --> 09:30.720
 And then you were going against another right handed player

09:30.720 --> 09:33.960
 and then there was some kind of fake that he did

09:33.960 --> 09:35.660
 and then he caught you.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.500
 Yep.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.600
 Can you describe the throw he caught you with?

09:38.600 --> 09:41.860
 He caught me with a drop sale,

09:41.860 --> 09:45.520
 but he kind of like, we were engaged.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.760
 We were looking at each other

09:46.760 --> 09:50.400
 and we were kind of at like a stalemate, right?

09:50.400 --> 09:53.040
 He couldn't really advance, I couldn't really advance.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.560
 And he kind of just let his gaze like wander off

09:56.560 --> 09:58.400
 to the right, like he was looking at something.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.000
 And then I kind of like, what's over there?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.380
 And then I got thrown and it's like.

10:04.380 --> 10:06.840
 So first of all, for people who don't know,

10:06.840 --> 10:11.480
 Seio's Seinagi drop means when you drop to your knees

10:11.480 --> 10:14.620
 and Seinagi is one of the fundamental throws of Judo.

10:14.620 --> 10:18.720
 There's just a handful, but does that actually ever work?

10:18.720 --> 10:22.520
 I always wondered that about like boxing or Judo.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.240
 Does the head movement of the person work?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.520
 Cause we're still like kind of dogs at heart.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.520
 If you look somewhere with a dog,

10:29.520 --> 10:31.720
 the dog is going to look that direction as well.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.080
 Does that actually work ever?

10:33.080 --> 10:37.220
 It does, but on a greater sense,

10:37.220 --> 10:39.960
 what you try to do is not necessarily get

10:39.960 --> 10:42.980
 like a physical reaction of a look,

10:42.980 --> 10:45.480
 but a lull of security where like,

10:45.480 --> 10:48.720
 they've almost like relaxed for that split second

10:48.720 --> 10:52.720
 because you've lured them into like a sense of comfort.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.400
 And then that's when you can strike.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.680
 So you have this, speaking of Seinagi,

10:57.680 --> 11:02.160
 you have this gigantic standing Seinagi.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.240
 And you have a specific grip.

11:05.240 --> 11:08.080
 One of our challenges is there's a large number of people

11:08.080 --> 11:10.280
 that listen to the audio version of this.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.200
 So we're gonna have to try to describe some of this stuff.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.640
 I'll do my best to try to describe with words,

11:15.640 --> 11:19.280
 but you have, you grip with your left hand

11:19.280 --> 11:23.800
 on the lapel of the jacket or like that area.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.080
 And there's kind of a lean into the person.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.320
 And I suppose, is there a feeling of a lull there

11:29.320 --> 11:31.240
 that you're trying to get to where you're just,

11:31.240 --> 11:33.640
 it feels like you're both calmly dancing

11:33.640 --> 11:36.260
 before you turn your hips and go in for the throw?

11:36.260 --> 11:41.260
 I'm actually trying to create a sense of weightlessness

11:43.560 --> 11:46.100
 for my lead leg, which would be my right leg.

11:46.100 --> 11:51.100
 And a sense of resistance from my partner.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.880
 So aren't you both kind of leaning into each other?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.580
 And it creates like an A frame.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.880
 But when the A frame is held together at the top half,

12:00.880 --> 12:02.920
 which would be my left hand and their right hand

12:02.920 --> 12:04.560
 posted on each other's chest,

12:04.560 --> 12:06.600
 it means our legs are free to move

12:06.600 --> 12:08.040
 and our hips are free to move.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.700
 And they're not gonna feel your leg move.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.040
 Because of the weightlessness.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.200
 And is there a feeling like, for them,

12:14.200 --> 12:16.280
 is there a feeling like nothing bad can happen here?

12:16.280 --> 12:18.560
 We're all relaxed, everything's fine?

12:18.560 --> 12:19.400
 Yeah.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.360
 And then they're standing off at a funny angle

12:21.360 --> 12:23.340
 and before they know it, I've spun

12:23.340 --> 12:25.800
 and my back is on their chest and they can't go anywhere.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.820
 Yeah.

12:26.820 --> 12:27.660
 Yeah.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.060
 How did you first develop that throw?

12:29.060 --> 12:32.280
 So for people, it's called Ippon Seinagi,

12:32.280 --> 12:36.880
 which means your right hand goes under their armpit area.

12:36.880 --> 12:41.760
 And that's like a vice that connects you to them.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.180
 And then they go on for the ride.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.960
 The interesting thing with the standing one

12:45.960 --> 12:49.760
 is as opposed to drop Seinagi version,

12:49.760 --> 12:54.200
 the drop Seinagi, you kind of drop under them.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.800
 And because there's a vice,

12:55.800 --> 12:59.500
 they're like pulled under and like over.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
 Yeah.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.820
 With the standing one, I suppose there's some similar physics,

13:04.820 --> 13:07.360
 but you're kind of loading them onto your hip.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.080
 And so they're in the air while you're standing still.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.460
 There's a sense in which they're like,

13:15.460 --> 13:19.060
 you're lifting them above where they started.

13:19.060 --> 13:19.900
 Yes.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.260
 That's how you get the really big air.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.100
 Yeah.

13:23.100 --> 13:27.020
 If obviously, if everything is right.

13:27.020 --> 13:28.780
 So how did you first develop that?

13:28.780 --> 13:29.940
 How did you first?

13:29.940 --> 13:32.980
 I first learned just learning like the very basics

13:32.980 --> 13:35.460
 of the throw, you know, foot placement,

13:35.460 --> 13:36.700
 all that kind of stuff.

13:36.700 --> 13:41.300
 And then, you know, like anything, the basics are nice,

13:41.300 --> 13:43.180
 but once you get good at the basics,

13:43.180 --> 13:44.980
 it's very easy to stop,

13:44.980 --> 13:47.460
 but it gives you a good like fundamental platform

13:47.460 --> 13:51.440
 to learn off of and to expand off of.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.860
 And then I expanded when I first started watching Koga,

13:54.860 --> 13:56.220
 the new wind, right?

13:56.220 --> 13:59.300
 Cause he's the one that first like introduced

13:59.300 --> 14:02.180
 that split hip style Seinagi that I do.

14:02.180 --> 14:06.300
 Once I learned that one,

14:06.300 --> 14:11.020
 I built about eight different variations of Seio

14:11.020 --> 14:13.300
 off that one start position.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.660
 That way I could, regardless of your defense,

14:15.660 --> 14:18.060
 I had an answer for a throw.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.260
 So why that one though?

14:19.260 --> 14:22.660
 Why, can you describe love to me, Travis Stevens?

14:22.660 --> 14:25.320
 Why'd you fall in love with that throw in particular?

14:26.260 --> 14:30.180
 It was really a sense of, you know,

14:30.180 --> 14:32.740
 one of my shortcomings as a kid, like,

14:32.740 --> 14:35.460
 I hate leg day in the gym.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.120
 I hate it with a passion.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.260
 I, if you asked me to do a squat, I'll get it done,

14:41.260 --> 14:44.040
 but I will bitch and moan every step of the way.

14:44.040 --> 14:44.880
 I hate it.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.860
 I remember one time I was at the gym with my trainer

14:46.860 --> 14:48.740
 and he goes, okay, we're going to do front squats.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.500
 And I want you to put 225 on the bar.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.800
 And I was like, I can't do that.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.900
 And he was like, what do you mean you can't do that?

14:54.900 --> 14:58.060
 And I go, I physically, I can't do that.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.380
 And he was like, are you serious?

15:00.380 --> 15:01.220
 And I go, yeah.

15:01.220 --> 15:02.700
 So he's, he didn't believe me.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.280
 We put 225 on the bar and I bottomed out.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.900
 And then he was like, okay, let's go down to 185.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.540
 And I was like, I can't do that.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.260
 I just, that's not happening.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.820
 You probably could, strength wise, you just refuse.

15:12.820 --> 15:15.820
 I just mentally, I cannot wrap my head around like,

15:15.820 --> 15:16.980
 this ain't happening.

15:16.980 --> 15:17.820
 I'm not doing it.

15:17.820 --> 15:21.780
 So I ended up with like 95 pounds on the bar.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.900
 I got you at a front squat, no problem.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.020
 By the way, body weight squats are rough too, psychologically.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.420
 So yeah, I just, when it comes to my legs,

15:29.420 --> 15:33.800
 like I want no part of like leg pressing,

15:33.800 --> 15:35.500
 single leg squats, split squat,

15:35.500 --> 15:36.980
 any of that, I want no part of it.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.140
 So you think like the more traditional variants

15:39.140 --> 15:42.460
 of Sanagi require you to have that leg strength,

15:42.460 --> 15:43.420
 that mass.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.120
 Like when you watch Japanese Judo players,

15:45.120 --> 15:48.140
 like their thighs and their hips, they're thick.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.060
 They got a lot of power there.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.700
 So you're almost like always dropping a little bit

15:52.700 --> 15:54.340
 into a squat position.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.420
 For mine, never.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.740
 No, no, no, not you, sorry.

15:56.740 --> 15:58.100
 For the traditional ones.

15:58.100 --> 15:58.940
 Yeah.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.700
 And so the split hip,

16:00.700 --> 16:03.980
 the split hip actually allows me to keep my legs straight.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.460
 And the farther I split my legs,

16:05.460 --> 16:07.300
 the lower my center of gravity goes.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.800
 Now I don't need my legs.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.640
 Yeah.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.460
 Perfect.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.300
 Love it.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.120
 Let's do it.

16:12.120 --> 16:12.960
 So that's the way you were thinking about it.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.040
 Okay.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.620
 But it's, you know, the interesting thing about it

16:16.620 --> 16:19.500
 is because, you know, as I mentioned to you,

16:19.500 --> 16:22.640
 I've gotten to Judo after first watching you

16:22.640 --> 16:26.700
 in the Olympics and then watching Koga as well.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.660
 And so you start imitating the people you foresee

16:29.660 --> 16:31.660
 and then you take it to Judo coaches

16:31.660 --> 16:32.660
 and they're like, no, no, no, no,

16:32.660 --> 16:34.680
 that's the wrong way to do it.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.260
 And happens all the time.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.600
 It drives me nuts, drives me nuts.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.900
 I was in Poland one time teaching a camp

16:41.900 --> 16:46.460
 and I had two coaches anti coaching,

16:46.460 --> 16:49.060
 telling their kids not to do Seio the way I do it

16:49.060 --> 16:50.260
 because it never works.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.100
 Yeah.

16:51.100 --> 16:51.980
 It's crazy.

16:51.980 --> 16:55.500
 How do you have the fortitude and the guts

16:55.500 --> 16:58.140
 to just go on with a throw that's not traditional,

16:58.140 --> 17:00.100
 a variant that's not traditional?

17:01.880 --> 17:04.080
 If you think about it, you know,

17:04.080 --> 17:08.540
 from a very basic like root of it,

17:08.540 --> 17:11.180
 there's a philosophy and a mentality of Judo

17:11.180 --> 17:13.380
 of how the throws work, right?

17:13.380 --> 17:16.140
 There's a mechanical structure there of like,

17:16.140 --> 17:18.220
 this makes sense.

17:18.220 --> 17:21.000
 If I follow that principle, I can do anything I want.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.320
 Nothing else matters.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.580
 As long as we follow those core principles.

17:25.580 --> 17:28.500
 So in the early days, even then,

17:28.500 --> 17:29.900
 you were able to think on your own.

17:29.900 --> 17:33.060
 Yeah, and I was able to develop a pattern

17:33.060 --> 17:36.720
 for my foot placement based on my opponent's height.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.860
 Because the number one thing any Judo coach would tell you

17:39.860 --> 17:42.720
 is you need your center of gravity below yours.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.380
 Well, now I know exactly where to put my feet

17:45.380 --> 17:48.540
 because the shorter you are, the bigger the split

17:48.540 --> 17:49.760
 because the lower I need to get.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.580
 The taller you are, the less of a split I need.

17:52.580 --> 17:53.620
 Is there something you could say

17:53.620 --> 17:57.200
 about fundamental principles of Judo?

17:57.200 --> 18:00.180
 Is there, over all that time,

18:00.180 --> 18:02.740
 not over 20 years that you've been doing Judo,

18:04.300 --> 18:06.020
 it's not approaching 30, is it?

18:06.020 --> 18:09.500
 Yeah, it's getting there.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.340
 Okay, it's getting there.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.620
 We're a couple years away, but it's getting there.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.100
 Is there some like principles that have emerged?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.900
 Like you said, you have to have your center of gravity

18:19.900 --> 18:21.140
 below theirs.

18:21.140 --> 18:24.060
 Is there other kind of, both on the gripping side,

18:24.060 --> 18:28.140
 the footwork side, leverage, anything you can speak to?

18:28.140 --> 18:31.700
 There's some that have withstood like time,

18:31.700 --> 18:35.340
 like you have to be able to get below

18:35.340 --> 18:36.420
 their center of gravity

18:36.420 --> 18:38.920
 because you have to be able to rotate them

18:38.920 --> 18:40.680
 around their center of gravity.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.000
 And then the other one is,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.180
 that was always a principle when I was growing up

18:45.180 --> 18:48.180
 and I didn't change until later on in my career was,

18:48.180 --> 18:50.020
 you have to be able to pull.

18:50.020 --> 18:53.820
 You need to be able to pull to get them off balance.

18:53.820 --> 18:56.300
 But when you think about that statement as a whole,

18:56.300 --> 18:59.540
 it ended with, they have to be off balance.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.880
 I don't need to pull to get you off balance.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.020
 I just need you off balance.

19:04.020 --> 19:05.540
 And when you think about it that way,

19:05.540 --> 19:08.520
 it allows you to open up the doors to,

19:08.520 --> 19:11.040
 what do I need to do to get you off balance?

19:11.040 --> 19:14.300
 I could push, pull, I could flinch, I could fake,

19:14.300 --> 19:17.320
 and you could put yourself in your own off balance state.

19:17.320 --> 19:22.160
 When you think about people who wrestle,

19:22.160 --> 19:25.440
 if I fake shoot, it causes you to over lean forward,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.280
 which means you're off balance.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.360
 There's no pull, there's no push, there's no nothing.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.420
 I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity

19:32.420 --> 19:34.640
 in the door open for an attack.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.720
 And that off balance could be very subtle?

19:36.720 --> 19:38.220
 Could be very subtle.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.240
 And the better you get and the more skills you get,

19:41.240 --> 19:42.620
 the less subtle it is.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.980
 So we should also mention that there is something called

19:46.980 --> 19:51.340
 forward throws, where you throw the person,

19:52.740 --> 19:54.840
 they're gonna fly facing forward,

19:54.840 --> 19:56.800
 they're gonna fly forward.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.040
 And then a backward throw, they're gonna fly back.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.400
 Yep, and then there's lateral,

20:02.400 --> 20:05.640
 they actually go sideways over, like a cartwheel almost.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.800
 Okay, so the forward throws,

20:07.800 --> 20:09.400
 there's the one we've been talking about,

20:09.400 --> 20:12.240
 which is Seinagi, and there's a bunch of different variants,

20:12.240 --> 20:14.240
 Ippon, Marote, Seinagi.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.920
 There's drop and there's standing versions of them.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.560
 And that all, I don't know if there's a way to summarize it,

20:20.560 --> 20:25.140
 but that's like as clean as getting your center of gravity

20:25.140 --> 20:27.800
 under theirs as it gets.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.520
 And then the rest is just gripping variations.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.160
 I guess it's all gripping variations

20:32.160 --> 20:33.560
 on all of these throws, but.

20:34.520 --> 20:38.960
 And then there is, in terms of forward throws,

20:38.960 --> 20:43.960
 there's the other big one in competition is Uchimata,

20:43.960 --> 20:48.960
 which is, I don't know, we can try to explain that one.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.880
 But it ends up being where one,

20:52.880 --> 20:55.240
 you're standing on just one of your feet,

20:55.240 --> 20:57.020
 and the other one is up in the air.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.360
 And I don't know if you would put in that same category,

20:59.360 --> 21:02.840
 Harai Goshi, like those kinds of throws

21:02.840 --> 21:05.920
 where you're kind of a little bit single footed.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.840
 Yeah, so there's two footed techniques

21:07.840 --> 21:09.460
 and then there's single footed, yeah.

21:09.460 --> 21:13.640
 Oh, Goshi, where it's like you're doing a mix

21:13.640 --> 21:16.360
 between the Uchimata and the Seinagi.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.200
 Yeah.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.080
 It's a hug.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.480
 You hug a person and then you turn your hips around

21:21.480 --> 21:24.480
 such that you're now hugging facing the same direction.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.840
 When it comes to forward throw,

21:25.840 --> 21:29.520
 there's, regardless of the name of the throw

21:29.520 --> 21:32.760
 or the gripping variation that you're using,

21:32.760 --> 21:35.080
 the whole principle is how do I get this person

21:35.080 --> 21:38.980
 to do a forward roll in midair and land on their back?

21:40.240 --> 21:43.520
 The more of a forward roll I can get, the bigger the score.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.120
 If I get like a quarter of a turn

21:46.120 --> 21:47.280
 where like you land on your side

21:47.280 --> 21:50.080
 and you don't go over your back, it's a half score.

21:50.080 --> 21:50.920
 Yeah.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.280
 But they all require me to get you

21:53.280 --> 21:55.160
 to do that forward rolling action.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.760
 So just if we think of one person,

21:56.760 --> 22:00.840
 if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll

22:00.840 --> 22:03.080
 and their back nicely rolls over the ground,

22:03.080 --> 22:04.600
 you're trying to do the exact same thing

22:04.600 --> 22:06.000
 with you connected to them.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.480
 Well, and if it's nice and it's smooth,

22:08.480 --> 22:10.080
 it's probably not a full score.

22:10.080 --> 22:14.000
 It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact.

22:15.100 --> 22:15.940
 Right?

22:15.940 --> 22:16.960
 So if you think of a drop, say Nagi,

22:16.960 --> 22:21.680
 if I'm moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders

22:21.680 --> 22:24.880
 and there's no direct impact, it's only a half score.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.720
 Right.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.120
 They want the force.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.900
 The force, the violence.

22:28.900 --> 22:29.740
 Yes.

22:29.740 --> 22:30.560
 It's good.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.400
 Okay.

22:31.400 --> 22:36.400
 So then in terms of backward throws, the traditional ones,

22:36.400 --> 22:41.400
 there's stuff where you trip them from outside their body,

22:41.480 --> 22:43.360
 like Osoto gari.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.800
 It's a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg

22:46.800 --> 22:51.280
 and you trip them, but your hook goes outside of their legs.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.920
 And then there's the trips from inside their body.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.040
 There's a one foot is called kuchi gari

22:58.040 --> 23:00.960
 and then the other is ochi gari, it doesn't matter.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.640
 The most important thing is outside and inside.

23:03.640 --> 23:07.280
 Inside and then there's like,

23:07.280 --> 23:08.920
 I don't even know how you throw them sideways

23:08.920 --> 23:09.800
 except foot sweeps.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.200
 And then there's the foot sweeps

23:11.200 --> 23:14.920
 where you can sweep one of their legs from out of them

23:14.920 --> 23:17.180
 or both their legs at the same time.

23:17.180 --> 23:20.440
 And like we're talking about this kind of is

23:20.440 --> 23:24.720
 when timed perfectly, it's effortless for everybody involved

23:24.720 --> 23:29.720
 and the ending, like you said, is big, dramatic and violent.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.560
 Yeah.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.360
 Is there other kind of, oh yeah.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.160
 There's a sacrifice techniques.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.040
 There's a bunch of them.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.900
 And that ultimately the variations have to do with gripping,

23:41.900 --> 23:46.080
 but you're basically you, the attacker fall onto your back,

23:46.080 --> 23:49.920
 sticking your legs somewhere onto their body,

23:49.920 --> 23:52.560
 which is like this fulcrum over which they fly

23:52.560 --> 23:54.560
 and do that same kind of roll that you mentioned.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.880
 You basically sacrifice your back to the mat

23:56.880 --> 24:00.040
 in order to throw them into that circular pattern.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.580
 So they hit their back.

24:01.580 --> 24:02.720
 Sometimes we use a foot,

24:02.720 --> 24:04.040
 sometimes we don't.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.540
 And so we should probably say,

24:06.540 --> 24:09.440
 it's okay for you to go onto your back

24:09.440 --> 24:12.240
 as long as you're clearly demonstrating control

24:12.240 --> 24:14.080
 over the other person's body.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.920
 Correct.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.000
 You can't go to your back in the same direction

24:18.000 --> 24:22.140
 that your opponent is trying to put you to your back.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.500
 You have to go the other way

24:23.500 --> 24:27.960
 or you have to initiate you going to your own back.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.280
 Right.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.340
 Like clearly.

24:30.340 --> 24:33.600
 And then there's all the counters

24:33.600 --> 24:37.440
 which almost kind of have a whole group of their own,

24:37.440 --> 24:41.060
 even though they have echoes of the same types of techniques,

24:41.060 --> 24:43.220
 it seems like they're their own whole thing.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.320
 Yeah, but they follow the same principles.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.680
 It's just most counters.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.880
 Like if you wanted to counter Ennuchi Mata, for example,

24:51.880 --> 24:54.520
 you're trying to throw me in a somersault

24:54.520 --> 24:56.540
 over my right shoulder.

24:56.540 --> 24:58.380
 Therefore, I would counter you

24:58.380 --> 25:01.760
 by throwing you over your left shoulder.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.760
 It goes in the opposite shoulder direction,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.920
 but in the same somersault idea.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.500
 And there used to be, I already at this point,

25:09.500 --> 25:13.560
 forget the years, but it might be before the 2012 Olympics

25:13.560 --> 25:17.280
 where they banned, you used to be allowed to grab legs

25:17.280 --> 25:19.440
 in the same way you do in wrestling.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.400
 So you have basically all the techniques

25:21.400 --> 25:24.760
 you would have in wrestling available to you

25:24.760 --> 25:26.120
 if you would like.

25:26.120 --> 25:26.960
 Yeah.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.920
 It's just that some of the techniques in wrestling

25:28.920 --> 25:30.040
 are not that effective

25:30.040 --> 25:32.800
 for getting your opponent to their back.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.720
 Wrestlers wanna take the other person down

25:34.720 --> 25:36.880
 in any way possible and have control.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.760
 Judo wants to take you down, like we said,

25:38.760 --> 25:41.400
 in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.760
 Yeah, it has to be to the back.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.800
 A lot of wrestling takedowns happen

25:44.800 --> 25:49.040
 because they get behind them and then they parterre out.

25:49.040 --> 25:54.040
 Yeah, so, but Judo banned all touching of the legs,

25:54.040 --> 25:57.160
 which is a very dramatic change at the sport.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.480
 But after 2012.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.920
 After, it was after 2012?

25:59.920 --> 26:00.760
 It was.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.120
 In 2012, so 2008, I fought the games

26:03.120 --> 26:05.280
 and everything was free.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.920
 In 2012, we could only touch the legs

26:07.920 --> 26:12.920
 as a defensive action or in response to an attack.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.680
 So I could try to throw you with a normal throw

26:17.680 --> 26:20.400
 and then when you try to counter, I could grab your leg.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.240
 Right.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.240
 So there had to be a secondary technique.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.200
 And didn't, like, didn't they disqualify

26:27.200 --> 26:29.200
 on a first offense?

26:29.200 --> 26:31.360
 First offense was a direct disqualification,

26:31.360 --> 26:35.760
 which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian

26:35.760 --> 26:37.560
 who won in 16.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.200
 She was DQed and I think the quarters.

26:40.200 --> 26:44.000
 And it was like, I wouldn't say it was blatant

26:44.000 --> 26:48.240
 as much as I don't think the act changed the outcome

26:48.240 --> 26:50.040
 of the match had they not disqualified her.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.400
 So that's not that dramatic.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.920
 And by the way, you say 57, that refers to weight divisions

26:54.920 --> 26:58.160
 and that's in kilograms and kilograms is the measure

26:58.160 --> 27:00.200
 of weight that the rest of the world uses

27:00.200 --> 27:02.400
 and the United States does not.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.320
 So, and there's, we should say the divisions for guys,

27:08.360 --> 27:11.120
 I don't know what the 70, I don't know if the lower level,

27:11.120 --> 27:11.960
 60.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.960
 60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100 and heavyweight,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.200
 which has no ceiling.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.120
 No ceiling, as we'll talk about.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.120
 It's an important distinction.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.240
 Yeah, it is an important distinction.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.600
 And you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.960
 All of it.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.280
 All, you never did 73.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.640
 I never did 73.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.840
 Well, you had to cut big for 81 anyway,

27:36.840 --> 27:39.720
 especially towards the end of my career, yeah.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.560
 Okay.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.200
 I overly grew into the division.

27:43.200 --> 27:47.640
 What's, I'm trying to remember, is it about 180 pounds?

27:47.640 --> 27:49.720
 178.6, I think.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.240
 And you have to weigh in with the gear.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.680
 No, nothing.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.880
 You're not allowed to wear anything

27:54.880 --> 27:56.680
 except for your underwear, weigh in.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.880
 Confusing digits, that's right, that's right, that's right.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.200
 That's which is very nice.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.720
 Okay, so we, would you say we covered

28:04.720 --> 28:06.400
 most of the throws or no?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.000
 So there's the forward and the backward,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.680
 there's the sacrifice throws and the counters.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.520
 Yep.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.280
 And then there's the leg grabs.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.880
 And we should say for the leg grabs that were effective,

28:17.880 --> 28:20.480
 it's like the big pickups

28:20.480 --> 28:21.880
 where you just kind of pick them up

28:21.880 --> 28:24.120
 and try to figure out once they're in the air

28:24.120 --> 28:25.520
 what the heck to do with their body

28:25.520 --> 28:26.840
 to get them to the ground.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.720
 You just kind of figure it out as you go.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.560
 I think the really nice one

28:30.560 --> 28:33.800
 that was to me heartbreaking as a fantasy go

28:33.800 --> 28:37.120
 is I guess what's called a fireman's carry,

28:37.120 --> 28:42.120
 which is, it does lead to judo like beautiful throws.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.280
 And the fact that that was gone is,

28:45.280 --> 28:47.440
 that one I missed a little bit,

28:47.440 --> 28:50.600
 but then a bunch of people I guess came up with the variance

28:50.600 --> 28:52.920
 where you don't need to grab the leg.

28:52.920 --> 28:57.160
 It's definitely not as effective as being able to grab it,

28:57.160 --> 28:59.800
 but I'm also on the side of the fence

28:59.800 --> 29:02.080
 having competed in all three.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.280
 It was definitely better for the sport

29:04.280 --> 29:07.240
 to remove it as a whole.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.560
 It's probably good to cover sort of

29:08.560 --> 29:10.960
 the whole spectrum of rules of judo

29:10.960 --> 29:12.440
 is there's groundwork.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.200
 So you do all this stuff on the feet

29:15.200 --> 29:16.680
 where you're trying to murder each other

29:16.680 --> 29:18.000
 with a giant throw.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.120
 But then if the throw doesn't succeed,

29:21.120 --> 29:23.000
 you go to the ground and you stay in the ground

29:23.000 --> 29:25.320
 for some amount of time, like short amount of time.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.960
 You have to move quickly, you have to be attacking.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.680
 And two of the ways you can win

29:30.680 --> 29:32.880
 is similar to people who do jiu jitsu

29:32.880 --> 29:36.720
 is you can submit them, chokes, arm breaks,

29:36.720 --> 29:39.320
 all that kind of stuff, no footlocks.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.320
 And you can also pin them,

29:43.320 --> 29:44.720
 which is get around their legs.

29:44.720 --> 29:47.960
 And this is very, no, this is not like wrestling.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.320
 You have to actually get around their legs

29:50.320 --> 29:53.440
 and pin them in what in jiu jitsu is called

29:53.440 --> 29:55.400
 side control mount, all kinds of ways

29:55.400 --> 29:57.480
 that doesn't involve their legs.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.000
 And then you pin them for like whatever,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.320
 20 seconds, 25 seconds.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.840
 Yeah, 20 seconds now.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.640
 I think the distinction is their back

30:04.640 --> 30:06.520
 has to be facing the mat.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.160
 You have to be past their legs

30:08.160 --> 30:12.000
 and your chest has to be on the same plane as theirs.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.120
 So it doesn't have to necessarily be on top,

30:14.120 --> 30:16.560
 but it has to be on the same plane.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.000
 And all of this is, I think different sports

30:20.000 --> 30:21.240
 have different versions of this,

30:21.240 --> 30:23.600
 but it's like an approximation

30:23.600 --> 30:25.680
 of what dominance looks like.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.280
 So pin and wrestling is dominating your opponent.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.320
 Presumably if you were in a street fight,

30:31.320 --> 30:34.160
 that position allows you to then do a lot of damage.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.840
 Obviously submissions is dominance

30:35.840 --> 30:40.480
 cause you're breaking their arm or choking them to unconscious.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.520
 And then obviously the throw,

30:42.520 --> 30:44.800
 which is not often talked about,

30:44.800 --> 30:47.920
 but like if you talk about a street fight situation,

30:47.920 --> 30:51.680
 a throw is like the best way to murder somebody.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.360
 Like this could end anyone's life.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.360
 Yes.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.800
 It's terrifying actually.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.400
 So, okay, so these are all elements of dominance.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.040
 So going back to set of principles,

31:03.040 --> 31:06.840
 you were mentioning getting your center of mass under theirs,

31:06.840 --> 31:10.760
 which I think applies for type of like the forward

31:10.760 --> 31:13.200
 say Nagi throws, is there other stuff?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.960
 Oh, so you mentioned off balance.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.680
 Yeah, there's the off balance one

31:17.680 --> 31:21.280
 where you can either pull to get an off balance

31:21.280 --> 31:24.080
 or you can give way to the force,

31:24.080 --> 31:26.000
 which can also lead to an off balance.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.560
 You can amplify somebody's force to,

31:30.560 --> 31:34.480
 so for example, if you push me,

31:34.480 --> 31:39.480
 you expect a certain reaction that you're ready for.

31:39.520 --> 31:42.200
 But if you push me and I pull you,

31:42.200 --> 31:44.800
 now you didn't expect that much force coming out of you.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.320
 Therefore you're off balance.

31:47.480 --> 31:50.560
 The thing that's distinctly recognizable about Judo

31:51.440 --> 31:53.680
 is like when done at the highest level,

31:54.960 --> 31:59.960
 like it seems effortless when the big throw happens.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.680
 Like that's just, it doesn't,

32:01.680 --> 32:04.520
 there is no other sport like it in the combat sports

32:04.520 --> 32:07.720
 where it's like when the timing is right,

32:07.720 --> 32:09.240
 everything just is perfect.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.880
 I think you get that out of my mate

32:10.880 --> 32:15.880
 and boxing sometimes when this is a perfect strike,

32:15.920 --> 32:19.760
 just like, but it's not just like a hard hit.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.680
 It's like, it's almost like with Conor McGregor and Aldo,

32:23.680 --> 32:25.640
 for example, when you just catch him just right.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.480
 Just right.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.440
 You didn't look like you hit him that hard,

32:28.440 --> 32:29.640
 but you hit him just right.

32:29.640 --> 32:33.000
 And then you get to see this all the time in Judo.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.120
 It's fascinating.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.400
 And so the beginning part of that

32:36.400 --> 32:38.360
 is because there's a jacket,

32:38.360 --> 32:40.840
 there's also this whole thing that you're a master of,

32:40.840 --> 32:43.480
 which is like, which is gripping.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.200
 So is there something you could say about,

32:46.200 --> 32:48.840
 are there some fundamental principles of gripping

32:48.840 --> 32:50.200
 that you can speak to?

32:50.200 --> 32:52.160
 Like what the hell is gripping?

32:52.160 --> 32:56.000
 Gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent

32:56.000 --> 32:59.560
 in such a way where you have the ability to be offensive

32:59.560 --> 33:03.720
 and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.880
 And it's a distinction because I can hold you

33:08.880 --> 33:13.240
 in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive,

33:13.240 --> 33:16.000
 but if you can take a purely defensive grip

33:16.000 --> 33:19.240
 and then I can't be offensive, we are no longer gripping.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.520
 We are holding each other.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.560
 Right.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.400
 Right.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.360
 And so like that would be the act of being able to grip

33:26.360 --> 33:30.960
 is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you,

33:30.960 --> 33:34.400
 and I can play both offense and defense at the same time

33:34.400 --> 33:36.960
 where you can only play defense.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.200
 So Donaher talks about like Jiu Jitsu that way,

33:40.200 --> 33:41.040
 and not that way,

33:41.040 --> 33:43.520
 but maybe you can see if there's a distinction.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.400
 So you have a set of weapons.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.320
 The other person has a set of weapons.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.640
 You wanna sort of maximize the use of your weapons

33:50.640 --> 33:54.720
 and shut down the set of weapons that they have.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.680
 Do you see gripping the same way on the feet?

33:57.680 --> 34:00.760
 I do if we wanna include body positioning

34:00.760 --> 34:01.720
 with our gripping.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.040
 Because I can give you any grip you want

34:05.040 --> 34:06.400
 and you still can't throw me.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.720
 Because I can put myself in a position

34:08.720 --> 34:11.320
 that nullifies your ability to use those grips

34:11.320 --> 34:13.120
 in a successful way.

34:13.120 --> 34:16.160
 And those, would you say the hips are critical to that

34:16.160 --> 34:17.080
 or is it everything?

34:17.080 --> 34:21.120
 Hips, shoulders, chin position, head position,

34:21.120 --> 34:22.760
 the angle of your foot.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.600
 Yeah, where you lean.

34:24.600 --> 34:25.640
 Wow, okay.

34:25.640 --> 34:28.920
 And so, and there's a bunch of places you can grip.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.720
 Obviously, if people like kind of think of a jacket,

34:31.720 --> 34:33.880
 like there's a bunch of places you can grip

34:33.880 --> 34:35.000
 that are interesting.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.240
 So you can grip on the collar,

34:37.240 --> 34:38.960
 you can grip on the sleeves,

34:38.960 --> 34:41.840
 you can grip like the elbow joint.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.160
 And then you could do those bad ass,

34:44.160 --> 34:48.080
 like Eastern European, Georgian, over the back.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.800
 Over the back, over the opposite sides of the heads.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.440
 The Koreans that grab on one side

34:52.440 --> 34:54.880
 around the head with their hands together.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.080
 There's something really nice about just those,

34:58.080 --> 35:00.600
 I mean, especially George just keeps throwing that hand.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.920
 Just over the person and just,

35:02.920 --> 35:05.600
 you're not actually gripping a belt or anything.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.240
 You're gripping just the entirety of like,

35:08.240 --> 35:09.600
 as opposed to being all nice

35:09.600 --> 35:11.160
 and I'm gonna grab this part of the jacket,

35:11.160 --> 35:12.400
 this part of the jacket.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.720
 You're just like taking the whole fucking jacket

35:15.720 --> 35:17.840
 and just launching somebody.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.160
 For those people that can't picture judo,

35:21.160 --> 35:23.000
 think about it in like,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.240
 if you understood like what a boxing match looks like,

35:26.240 --> 35:29.040
 and you thought about that as like traditional gripping,

35:29.040 --> 35:31.880
 when you throw like a Russian grip over the back,

35:31.880 --> 35:33.160
 that's more like a hockey fight.

35:33.160 --> 35:36.240
 Like I'm just grabbing you and we're just gonna,

35:36.240 --> 35:38.000
 we're gonna be throwing punches left and right.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.960
 Cause when we have that grip,

35:39.960 --> 35:41.840
 somebody has to get thrown.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.880
 There's no, we don't walk around with this grip.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.880
 It's go time once somebody throws it.

35:47.880 --> 35:52.040
 To me, as a fan and sort of amateur practitioner,

35:53.120 --> 35:55.880
 there's two styles of Olympic level judo.

35:55.880 --> 35:59.480
 One is where you're trying not to get thrown.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.040
 And the other is where you're trying to throw.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.720
 More specifically, when you're trying not to get thrown,

36:06.720 --> 36:09.160
 there's like the strategy that you're using gripping

36:09.160 --> 36:13.160
 to nullify their offense and all those kinds of stuff here.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.720
 You're being very clever and strategic and all that,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.360
 maybe using conditioning.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.280
 And then there's people who just like step in the pocket

36:21.280 --> 36:23.960
 and they almost don't care if they're getting thrown

36:23.960 --> 36:24.960
 cause they have the confidence

36:24.960 --> 36:27.120
 that they're gonna throw first.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.080
 And those, like there's a clear distinction

36:29.080 --> 36:31.280
 between the people that do one or the other.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.240
 And I think both can be done extremely successfully

36:35.240 --> 36:36.440
 at the highest level.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.600
 It's just like, obviously you admire the people

36:38.600 --> 36:40.360
 that step in the pocket.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.160
 And I think when you look at the people

36:42.160 --> 36:45.680
 who do judo the best,

36:45.680 --> 36:49.240
 like if we wanna talk about like the top 10%

36:49.240 --> 36:52.040
 of the people who would compete at the games,

36:52.040 --> 36:53.640
 they do both.

36:53.640 --> 36:57.160
 And they do both really well, but they favor one.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.200
 Because if you look at a player like

37:02.600 --> 37:05.160
 Lutepe Tilliani of Georgia, for example,

37:05.160 --> 37:07.520
 there's a guy that stands in the pocket.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.520
 But we can find numerous occasions

37:09.520 --> 37:11.760
 where he's hustled some people

37:11.760 --> 37:13.640
 for like a short period of time

37:13.640 --> 37:17.320
 to get out of scenarios, to elongate the match,

37:17.320 --> 37:19.040
 to make somebody tired.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.320
 So you want both sides of the coin,

37:21.320 --> 37:24.760
 but you better pick the one that 80% of your strategy

37:24.760 --> 37:26.000
 is gonna be built around.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.480
 Sorry for the romantic question,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.240
 but I talked to Dan Gable

37:30.240 --> 37:33.600
 and he always looked to the Russians

37:33.600 --> 37:37.280
 as the artists in wrestling.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.480
 And he always wanted to be an artist.

37:39.480 --> 37:44.160
 But I think he's known for being that sort of guts,

37:44.160 --> 37:46.080
 aggression, mental toughness guy,

37:46.080 --> 37:49.080
 but he always was drawn to the artistry of wrestling.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.440
 It's hard to know when you just watch you,

37:52.440 --> 37:54.040
 because it looks like you're aggressive

37:54.040 --> 37:56.360
 and you got the guts and the mental toughness,

37:56.360 --> 37:58.720
 but there's also obviously a mastery of technique.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.800
 Which would you lean towards in terms of

38:01.800 --> 38:03.680
 what accounts for your success

38:03.680 --> 38:05.200
 and just the way you approach judo?

38:05.200 --> 38:09.760
 Is it the guts, the aggression, the mental toughness,

38:09.760 --> 38:14.760
 or is it the mastery of technique, the artistry?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.600
 Mine would be my aggressiveness

38:17.600 --> 38:20.400
 if I'm gonna pick those two areas.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.080
 But I think there's a third area in there

38:25.080 --> 38:28.160
 that I would put myself in where I'm more of a strategist.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.360
 I look at all of my opponents

38:31.360 --> 38:34.800
 and all I ever see is their faults.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.880
 And the way I do judo is built around their faults.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.920
 And it's just, I put myself in scenarios

38:42.920 --> 38:45.920
 where I don't even know how I'm gonna win.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.760
 But what I've done in those scenarios is

38:48.760 --> 38:51.400
 I've made it very difficult for you to win.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.160
 And then I figure out the rest as I go.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.120
 Like how do you study an opponent?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.880
 Are there bins you can put them in?

39:00.880 --> 39:04.600
 Like there's a lefty and a righty or this kind of stuff.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.840
 How many bins are there in judo in your mind

39:06.840 --> 39:09.880
 that you put your opponents in?

39:09.880 --> 39:11.760
 Yeah, there's probably about 20.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.440
 There's like certain players who you could put

39:15.440 --> 39:18.240
 in a category of like, they're only good

39:18.240 --> 39:21.720
 for the first two thirds of the match.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.760
 After that, they turn into a different player

39:23.760 --> 39:27.320
 where they're either falling into a sense of panic

39:27.320 --> 39:28.680
 or uncertainty.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.800
 And you can, if you were to take a video clip

39:31.800 --> 39:33.720
 of let's say Church's Philly, right?

39:33.720 --> 39:37.400
 They got Georgia and I beat in the Olympic semi.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.000
 He's somebody that would beat you

39:39.000 --> 39:40.800
 in the first three minutes.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.360
 And if you clipped out all of his matches

39:43.360 --> 39:46.480
 and you only watched the first three minutes

39:46.480 --> 39:49.360
 of every match, you would see one style.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.880
 If you found all the matches where he got taken

39:51.880 --> 39:56.880
 into the last minute and he wasn't winning by a major score,

39:56.880 --> 39:59.120
 you would see a completely different fighter.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.320
 And so going into like my Olympic semi,

40:02.320 --> 40:04.800
 I put him into that category of like,

40:04.800 --> 40:07.640
 I wanna get to this guy, cause this guy is beautiful.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.720
 The trick is, how do you get there?

40:10.720 --> 40:11.560
 How do you get there?

40:11.560 --> 40:14.520
 And by the way, we're talking about the 2016 Olympics

40:14.520 --> 40:15.800
 where you won the silver medal.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.480
 You were part of three different Olympics.

40:18.480 --> 40:22.240
 But the cardio aspect of it,

40:23.280 --> 40:26.660
 have you faced exhaustion often in your matches

40:26.660 --> 40:29.080
 where you have to go deep and go like past?

40:29.080 --> 40:32.840
 Yeah, but that's not from the judo side of it.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.840
 That's from like, I did a very bad job of making weight.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.960
 It's always the weight cut.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.400
 Yeah, it's always the weight cut.

40:39.400 --> 40:43.400
 And I think people really struggle with that.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.240
 They blame cardio and training and everything else.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.480
 But when it really comes down to it,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.400
 like we train for an hour and a half, two hours,

40:50.400 --> 40:51.880
 twice a day.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.060
 How are you tired after five minutes?

40:54.060 --> 40:54.900
 Right.

40:54.900 --> 40:56.560
 Right, it becomes into a mental struggle,

40:56.560 --> 41:01.040
 your anxiety, your stress, your lack of belief in yourself.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.640
 Or in my case, sometimes it's poor nutrition.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.660
 Sometimes I had one too many McDonald's meals.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.720
 It just, it happens.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.760
 Okay, so let's talk about weight cutting real quick.

41:11.760 --> 41:16.700
 So I've seen weight cutting break

41:16.700 --> 41:20.360
 some of the toughest fighters, wrestlers, grapplers ever.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.000
 Like burnout break,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.200
 like where it makes you wanna quit the sport.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.800
 So this is what people don't often talk about,

41:27.800 --> 41:29.960
 but mentally it's one of the hardest things,

41:29.960 --> 41:32.800
 especially when you're doing it kind of wrong.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.960
 Because it becomes a mental war.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.440
 So you competed, like you said,

41:37.440 --> 41:40.200
 your whole career at 81 kilograms.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.600
 You walked around at?

41:42.600 --> 41:44.180
 88, 89.

41:44.180 --> 41:49.180
 So about 15 pounds, sometimes 20 pounds over that.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.440
 Give or take.

41:51.440 --> 41:56.440
 And so what was your process like mentally and physically?

41:56.720 --> 41:58.160
 First of all, maybe you can comment on

41:58.160 --> 42:00.880
 when the weigh ins are relative to the matches.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.680
 And then what was your process like leading

42:02.680 --> 42:05.560
 like a week ahead, a day ahead,

42:05.560 --> 42:09.560
 an hour ahead, minutes ahead of the weigh in?

42:09.560 --> 42:13.500
 Man, everyone varies tremendously

42:13.500 --> 42:16.240
 because we're not like most sports

42:16.240 --> 42:18.520
 because you're dropped off in foreign countries

42:18.520 --> 42:20.720
 with who knows what, right?

42:20.720 --> 42:23.620
 Some places have saunas, some places have treadmills.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.040
 I went to a place one time in China

42:27.040 --> 42:31.220
 in the middle of winter where the roads were frozen with ice

42:31.220 --> 42:32.960
 and we had to use our hotel rooms

42:32.960 --> 42:35.880
 because you couldn't sweat outside

42:35.880 --> 42:37.040
 because it was too cold.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.920
 And every one of my Olympics,

42:39.920 --> 42:42.840
 the weight cut was different just given my mass.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.320
 When I went to 2008,

42:45.320 --> 42:48.920
 I was probably like 82, 83 kilos walking around.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.960
 So weight cutting wasn't a thing for me.

42:51.960 --> 42:56.080
 In London, we actually weighed in the morning of.

42:56.080 --> 42:59.080
 So weigh ins were at like 6 a.m.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.920
 And the Olympics were always beneficial to me

43:00.920 --> 43:04.160
 because they actually don't start until like 10 or 11.

43:05.180 --> 43:07.160
 So you actually were able to recover.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.020
 Where on the circuit you would weigh in at 6 a.m.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.440
 and the competition started at 8 a.m.

43:12.440 --> 43:15.120
 It's like, well, I was cutting weight at 5 a.m.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.440
 And most of it for people who are not familiar,

43:17.440 --> 43:19.280
 but maybe you can also correct me,

43:19.280 --> 43:21.820
 most of it, you're really just getting the water

43:21.820 --> 43:22.660
 out of your system.

43:22.660 --> 43:23.480
 It was water cut.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.160
 At that point, yeah.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.640
 Like 24 hours before even, like.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.480
 So are you?

43:28.480 --> 43:29.800
 Like an hour before.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.700
 But yeah, but like leading up to it.

43:33.100 --> 43:36.080
 And have you eaten the day before?

43:36.080 --> 43:38.520
 Do you try to minimize the amount of food in your system?

43:38.520 --> 43:41.240
 My weight cutting process was a little bit different

43:41.240 --> 43:46.240
 than most people because I like to eat.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.960
 I'm not the type of person that believes

43:50.960 --> 43:54.260
 your athletic career is determined by your nutrition.

43:55.360 --> 43:56.200
 Right.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.480
 I don't believe that.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.840
 I think some sports are built that way.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.740
 But when it comes to combat sports,

44:01.740 --> 44:06.080
 like, you know, your ability to knock somebody out

44:06.080 --> 44:08.440
 has nothing to do with whether you had a cheeseburger

44:08.440 --> 44:09.920
 or a salad.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.200
 My ability to throw you is not determined by that.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.760
 I may be able to perform better

44:13.760 --> 44:16.340
 because I've eaten a certain way,

44:16.340 --> 44:19.980
 but not enough to justify an entire diet change.

44:19.980 --> 44:22.560
 Your body is built and my body is built

44:22.560 --> 44:24.040
 to operate with certain things

44:24.040 --> 44:26.580
 that I've had in my system for years.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.720
 Yeah, I think I'm with you,

44:28.720 --> 44:32.120
 but I also believe that there's a mental aspect.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.500
 So if you're surrounded by people

44:33.500 --> 44:35.400
 that tell you diet matters,

44:35.400 --> 44:37.180
 then if your diet is off,

44:37.180 --> 44:38.840
 you're gonna believe you're going to be off

44:38.840 --> 44:40.240
 because the people around you tell you

44:40.240 --> 44:41.640
 your diet should be good.

44:41.640 --> 44:44.400
 So yeah, I think it's like,

44:44.400 --> 44:47.080
 it's the same, I've had an argument with Matthew Walker,

44:47.080 --> 44:51.000
 who's a sleep scientist about sleep.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.720
 And it's like, if you believe sleep is essential,

44:53.720 --> 44:55.560
 it's essential to get eight hours of sleep

44:55.560 --> 44:57.400
 every single night perfectly,

44:57.400 --> 45:00.280
 then you're going to be very stressed when you don't get it.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.520
 And then I think it will negatively affect,

45:02.520 --> 45:04.480
 the stress will negatively affect your longevity

45:04.480 --> 45:06.480
 and all kinds of aspects of your life.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.360
 If you actually just learn to truly listen to your body,

45:09.360 --> 45:12.100
 become a scientist of your own body with sleep and food,

45:12.100 --> 45:15.120
 it might end up that it will be the eight hours a night

45:15.120 --> 45:17.240
 or whatever, but it might be something else

45:17.240 --> 45:18.800
 and probably diet error.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.920
 I remember when I was meeting

45:19.920 --> 45:23.640
 with the USOC nutritionist after London,

45:23.640 --> 45:28.640
 it was probably around 2014, I think.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.160
 And when we had our team meeting

45:31.160 --> 45:33.640
 at the beginning of the year and I was talking to him,

45:33.640 --> 45:35.760
 he was talking about the nutrition plans

45:35.760 --> 45:37.120
 that he could put us on.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.520
 And I was like, time out.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.380
 I've done the USOC thing, like I've done the couscous,

45:41.380 --> 45:43.400
 I've done the lemon in my water.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.480
 I go, I'm full of shit.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.520
 The couscous?

45:46.520 --> 45:47.880
 The couscous? Yeah.

45:47.880 --> 45:48.720
 Oh boy.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.540
 Like there was just,

45:49.540 --> 45:51.560
 cause there's like a cookie cutter plan, right?

45:51.560 --> 45:54.240
 And I was like, look, here's what I want you to do.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.320
 I go, I'll listen to you,

45:56.320 --> 45:57.920
 but you're going to walk into the 711

45:57.920 --> 45:59.940
 across the street from the USOC.

45:59.940 --> 46:03.580
 And if you can't buy it in that 711, it's not on my plan.

46:03.580 --> 46:04.480
 Right.

46:04.480 --> 46:07.080
 I go, because I go to places where

46:07.080 --> 46:10.520
 the only thing I can eat is Pringles and a Snickers bar.

46:10.520 --> 46:11.360
 I've done that.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.360
 Like I've flown to Azerbaijan,

46:13.360 --> 46:16.320
 stayed in a hotel where the restaurant is closed.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.880
 USA Judo hasn't paid for the meal plan.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.500
 And the only thing that's available

46:20.500 --> 46:22.040
 is the thing across the street.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.440
 So you were eating Pringles.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.840
 Before fighting a Grand Slam event,

46:25.840 --> 46:27.200
 while cutting 20 pounds.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.400
 And a Snickers bar.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.780
 Yeah.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.840
 I just, the visual of that, that's some like,

46:31.840 --> 46:33.000
 that's some Rocky shit.

46:33.000 --> 46:33.840
 Okay.

46:33.840 --> 46:34.760
 Give me a nutrition plan.

46:34.760 --> 46:35.600
 Go for it.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.400
 Cause I'm not paying my own way

46:37.400 --> 46:41.420
 to travel with 14 days of food.

46:41.420 --> 46:42.320
 Right.

46:42.320 --> 46:45.440
 I mean, that's, that's one of the magic of your whole career

46:45.440 --> 46:46.960
 and also Judo.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.980
 I mean, I'm sorry to say, of course,

46:48.980 --> 46:51.240
 you want athletes to be super rich

46:51.240 --> 46:53.840
 and super well funded from an athlete perspective

46:53.840 --> 46:56.680
 and the sport to be popular and managed

46:56.680 --> 46:57.800
 in an ultra competent way.

46:57.800 --> 46:58.920
 But as a fan.

46:58.920 --> 46:59.880
 That's not reality.

46:59.880 --> 47:02.760
 But as a fan, it's fun to watch somebody like you

47:02.760 --> 47:04.020
 who's exceptionally driven,

47:04.020 --> 47:07.320
 has to suffer in all these different interesting ways.

47:07.320 --> 47:12.320
 But it's only suffering if you expect the other side.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.160
 Right.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.320
 I don't expect it.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.120
 I accept it for what it is,

47:16.120 --> 47:18.680
 which is why I write off nutrition for athletes.

47:18.680 --> 47:19.520
 Right.

47:19.520 --> 47:20.520
 Cause it can be done without it.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.800
 As long as, you know, to what you said before,

47:22.800 --> 47:25.600
 like you don't believe you need it.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.480
 Some people believe they need it.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.180
 The mind, getting your mind right

47:30.180 --> 47:31.280
 is the most important thing.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.480
 You know what I believe I need?

47:32.480 --> 47:33.320
 What's that?

47:33.320 --> 47:35.040
 A Snickers bar when I'm tired.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.080
 I want a little bit of sugar.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.280
 It makes me feel better.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.580
 What do you want me to do?

47:39.580 --> 47:40.420
 So you,

47:42.080 --> 47:43.680
 what are you going to do?

47:43.680 --> 47:45.040
 Yeah.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.720
 I just love the visual of you eating a Snickers bar

47:47.720 --> 47:48.920
 before a grand slam.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.260
 But that became part of my nutrition plan.

47:51.260 --> 47:54.120
 When the USOC guy wrote my nutrition plan,

47:54.120 --> 47:58.240
 I was eating a burrito bowl with brown rice,

47:58.240 --> 48:02.280
 white meat chicken, black beans, guacamole, cheese,

48:02.280 --> 48:05.040
 two chocolate chip cookies and a Diet Coke.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.320
 This is like Chipotle or?

48:07.320 --> 48:08.960
 It was Beloco, but same concept.

48:08.960 --> 48:12.140
 Same concept with two chocolate chip cookies.

48:12.140 --> 48:13.360
 Cause I needed the sugar.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.200
 I was,

48:15.300 --> 48:19.720
 I was 88 kilos when I stepped on the scale

48:19.720 --> 48:22.920
 at 6.3% body fat.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.080
 Now I got to make 81.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.600
 Six, what?

48:26.600 --> 48:27.440
 Really?

48:27.440 --> 48:28.640
 Yeah.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.120
 And the USOC was like,

48:30.120 --> 48:34.360
 Hey, you know, you can't, you can't fight 81 anymore.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.520
 You have to fight nineties.

48:35.520 --> 48:38.800
 And I go, I'm already into the quad.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.960
 I'm not changing.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.920
 I go, build me a plan where I can do this.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.480
 And now we have to have an acceptable weight cut.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.480
 Like it just, what do you want me to do?

48:47.480 --> 48:48.480
 I'm not the IJF.

48:48.480 --> 48:51.000
 I can't just change the fact that it takes two years

48:51.000 --> 48:52.580
 to qualify.

48:52.580 --> 48:53.600
 I know where I'm at.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.960
 I know what I have to go through

48:54.960 --> 48:57.040
 and I accept the consequences.

48:57.040 --> 48:57.860
 It is what it is.

48:57.860 --> 48:59.180
 What do you want me to do?

48:59.180 --> 49:00.880
 All right, so what was the process?

49:00.880 --> 49:02.760
 I mean, can you, can you speak to,

49:02.760 --> 49:05.120
 so you, you wake up early in the morning,

49:05.120 --> 49:08.540
 the day of the weigh ins, a few hours before.

49:08.540 --> 49:11.200
 Technically my weight cut never started

49:11.200 --> 49:15.320
 until I got off a plane and to a hotel.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.080
 And how many hours?

49:17.080 --> 49:18.000
 Three days.

49:19.180 --> 49:20.680
 So it's a three day cut.

49:20.680 --> 49:21.520
 It's a three day cut.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.120
 Mentally you're thinking of it that way.

49:23.120 --> 49:23.960
 Yep.

49:23.960 --> 49:24.980
 And then you're still eating.

49:24.980 --> 49:26.080
 I eat every day.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.480
 And then like, what do you load up on water?

49:28.480 --> 49:32.320
 Maybe as you start and then the water stops.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.320
 It is what it is.

49:35.320 --> 49:38.440
 So you, I mean, it's a slow,

49:38.440 --> 49:41.600
 you're not actually like sweating all three days.

49:41.600 --> 49:42.960
 Yeah.

49:42.960 --> 49:44.880
 But then it's like torture to sleep.

49:46.560 --> 49:47.560
 Part of the process.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.360
 Are you able to sleep?

49:50.360 --> 49:51.200
 Sometimes.

49:52.320 --> 49:53.200
 It depends.

49:54.280 --> 49:57.140
 So you're dehydrated, further and further dehydrated

49:57.140 --> 50:01.040
 with six, 7% body fat, trying to lose 10 pounds.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.920
 I even developed a way to drink water out of a bottle

50:03.920 --> 50:04.880
 where I don't drink anything,

50:04.880 --> 50:08.040
 but I feel like I have swishing it.

50:08.040 --> 50:08.880
 What's the, no.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.640
 So like, I take like a bottle of water

50:10.640 --> 50:13.520
 and like, if we were to like, to draw a line on it,

50:13.520 --> 50:15.120
 I would tip it and I would go like this.

50:15.120 --> 50:15.960
 I would go.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.480
 And you would draw that line,

50:24.480 --> 50:27.280
 but like I've drank now water for 20 seconds or whatever

50:27.280 --> 50:28.120
 it is.

50:29.160 --> 50:32.000
 And I feel, I get the fix.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.320
 Brain told me I got there.

50:34.360 --> 50:35.820
 No problem.

50:35.820 --> 50:36.920
 That's amazing, man.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.980
 You just, your mind's a very powerful tool.

50:39.980 --> 50:44.440
 And the problem a lot of people have is

50:45.960 --> 50:48.340
 they don't accept the reality of the situation.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.600
 They bitch about the reality of the situation.

50:51.600 --> 50:52.440
 I just.

50:52.440 --> 50:56.880
 First of all, you could always quit, right?

50:56.880 --> 50:57.720
 Yep.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.000
 So like, you're not.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.240
 Never missed weight.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.080
 Never.

51:01.080 --> 51:01.920
 Never missed weight.

51:01.920 --> 51:04.120
 You can perform poorly.

51:04.120 --> 51:04.960
 You can't miss weight.

51:04.960 --> 51:05.800
 Don't miss weight.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.000
 Don't miss weight.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.160
 Because you can always win

51:10.160 --> 51:12.600
 regardless of how bad the weight cut is.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.640
 You can never win if you miss weight.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.200
 But your brain is also really good.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.620
 Maybe not your brain,

51:20.620 --> 51:23.480
 but I know my brain,

51:23.480 --> 51:26.080
 I think most people's brains are good at generating,

51:26.080 --> 51:27.680
 the more desperate things become,

51:27.680 --> 51:30.560
 the better at generating excuses.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.800
 So what were you doing with your mind

51:33.760 --> 51:37.560
 that resulted in you never missing weight?

51:37.560 --> 51:39.040
 The plan.

51:39.040 --> 51:43.540
 So like I said, like my weight cut would never start

51:43.540 --> 51:45.480
 until I got to the hotel

51:45.480 --> 51:48.680
 because I didn't check my weight the morning of,

51:48.680 --> 51:50.760
 I didn't check my weight when I got there.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.840
 I just, while I'm traveling,

51:52.840 --> 51:55.880
 I'm doing things at like a minimal level,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.780
 but I'm never not giving myself something I'm craving.

52:01.880 --> 52:04.760
 If I'm thirsty, I'm drinking a Diet Coke.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.760
 If I'm hungry, I'm buying a Snickers bar.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.040
 I'm buying a sandwich.

52:09.960 --> 52:10.800
 I am.

52:11.680 --> 52:14.160
 And I accept the consequences when I get there.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.040
 And then when I get there,

52:16.040 --> 52:19.000
 if I step on the scale and it says 88 kilos,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.200
 I instantaneously know exactly

52:21.200 --> 52:22.920
 what it's gonna take to be 81.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.800
 And then you just follow like a robot,

52:24.800 --> 52:26.360
 follow a very specific process.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.960
 Yep.

52:27.960 --> 52:28.880
 And then, I mean,

52:28.880 --> 52:31.720
 cause there's a lot of seconds in three days,

52:31.720 --> 52:33.720
 seconds and minutes and you just.

52:33.720 --> 52:36.480
 I just know exactly what it takes from my body.

52:36.480 --> 52:39.720
 I know exactly what a one hour gym workout

52:39.720 --> 52:43.040
 wearing a sauna suit is gonna take.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.520
 I know exactly what I'm gonna lose on day one.

52:45.520 --> 52:47.960
 And I know exactly what I'm gonna lose on day three,

52:47.960 --> 52:49.480
 because they're not the same.

52:49.480 --> 52:52.240
 So I can instantly look at a hotel,

52:52.240 --> 52:55.700
 decide is there a bathroom, sauna, gym,

52:55.700 --> 52:59.840
 temperature of the gym, access to the gym and when it is,

52:59.840 --> 53:03.020
 access to the judo mats, my training partners,

53:03.020 --> 53:06.360
 the roads versus streetlights, the weather outside.

53:06.360 --> 53:08.460
 I can take a look at that environment and say,

53:08.460 --> 53:11.040
 this is my weight, this is weigh ins.

53:11.040 --> 53:12.720
 And instantaneously in my head,

53:12.720 --> 53:14.220
 there's a plan to make weight.

53:14.220 --> 53:18.840
 And you have a sense of how much sweat adds up to 10 pounds.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.560
 How much sweat plus time.

53:20.560 --> 53:21.400
 Yeah.

53:21.400 --> 53:24.040
 And I make sure in my plan,

53:24.040 --> 53:27.360
 all of my meals and how much water I need in between

53:27.360 --> 53:29.160
 is allocated to still make weight.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.880
 Cause you have to eat or drink during that time.

53:31.880 --> 53:36.680
 Are you incorporating like mental exhaustion into this?

53:36.680 --> 53:38.140
 That doesn't exist.

53:38.140 --> 53:38.980
 So it doesn't?

53:38.980 --> 53:39.800
 No, it doesn't.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.120
 Do you like meditate or something?

53:41.120 --> 53:43.560
 What did the thoughts come, especially three days.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.840
 We're not talking about four hours of suffering.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.680
 I'll tell you.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.960
 This has broken some of the toughest people in the world.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.520
 The hardest weight cut I ever had.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.600
 Hardest one.

53:53.680 --> 53:58.680
 I fought Pan Am games in 2015 in Edmonton, Canada

53:58.840 --> 54:03.020
 on a Wednesday and I won.

54:03.020 --> 54:06.600
 So I've made weight on Tuesday.

54:06.600 --> 54:08.700
 I fought on Wednesday where I had to weigh in

54:08.700 --> 54:12.000
 5% of my weight class, so 84 kilos.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
 On Wednesday I was 84 kilos.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
 I got on a plane on that Wednesday night

54:19.400 --> 54:23.260
 and landed Friday morning in Sochi.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.120
 Okay, so I've traveled now.

54:27.680 --> 54:32.280
 I got on the scale, all my bags got lost, everything.

54:32.280 --> 54:36.880
 So somehow I flew from there to here, no bags.

54:36.880 --> 54:40.640
 And I threw all of my stuff in my bag.

54:40.640 --> 54:44.760
 I wore sandals, one pair of pants and a T shirt

54:44.760 --> 54:47.240
 on the plane because I was like, I'm just tired.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.080
 I just fought.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.480
 I don't even want to carry it.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.440
 I don't care.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.880
 What are the odds that I get there and my bags are gone?

54:52.880 --> 54:54.360
 Yeah, very low.

54:54.360 --> 54:55.920
 Very low.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.680
 Sure enough, it's gone.

54:57.680 --> 54:58.960
 I get all the way to Sochi.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.560
 I check into the hotel.

55:00.560 --> 55:01.580
 There's one sauna.

55:02.800 --> 55:03.640
 Guess what?

55:03.640 --> 55:06.480
 You have to reserve it and you're only allowed

55:06.480 --> 55:08.520
 to reserve it for an X period of time.

55:08.520 --> 55:11.200
 Guess in a small tangent, when you phoned out,

55:11.200 --> 55:13.040
 your bags are gone.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.200
 This is something I'll often think about.

55:15.200 --> 55:17.120
 There's like people that are helping you, right?

55:17.120 --> 55:20.320
 Like there's a person at the airport who goes.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.160
 Yep, oops.

55:21.160 --> 55:21.980
 Just like that.

55:21.980 --> 55:24.120
 And then the person at the hotel who tells you

55:24.120 --> 55:27.280
 that you have to reserve the sauna and looks at you like

55:27.280 --> 55:30.800
 you're, they don't care that you've been suffering.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.720
 They don't even understand why you need it.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.840
 Yeah, like why?

55:34.840 --> 55:38.840
 Oh, you know, oh, this, like this little kid reserved it

55:38.840 --> 55:41.520
 for five hours or something to block it off.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.360
 I'm sorry.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.080
 Is there a frustration that gets in there?

55:45.080 --> 55:45.920
 Are you?

55:45.920 --> 55:46.880
 You just accept reality.

55:46.880 --> 55:50.600
 Don't even hinder on like the things you can't change.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.280
 Because the second you get frustrated,

55:52.280 --> 55:55.760
 the second you think you can change it,

55:55.760 --> 55:56.700
 you'll harp on it.

55:56.700 --> 55:58.240
 And that breaks most men.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.140
 Yeah.

55:59.140 --> 56:02.460
 That like little thing in the back of their mind thinking,

56:02.460 --> 56:03.880
 oh, like what if?

56:03.880 --> 56:04.700
 There's no what if.

56:04.700 --> 56:06.800
 There's only right here right now.

56:06.800 --> 56:07.880
 If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

56:07.880 --> 56:10.080
 Let's just quickly come up with a solution

56:10.080 --> 56:11.000
 to fix the problem.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.360
 By the way, as another small tangent,

56:13.360 --> 56:16.280
 all the greatest people I've interacted with

56:16.280 --> 56:19.260
 at the highest level think like that.

56:19.260 --> 56:22.440
 They don't linger on the, it's like the next thing.

56:22.440 --> 56:23.280
 Yeah.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.360
 Because like, if you want to do something great,

56:25.360 --> 56:28.240
 hard stuff is going to keep happening to you.

56:28.240 --> 56:30.420
 And if you're going to let that affect you,

56:30.420 --> 56:32.400
 you're not ever going to do the great thing.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.640
 It's fascinating actually.

56:33.640 --> 56:36.480
 Like that's the one skill you have to learn.

56:36.480 --> 56:38.000
 Elon Musk is great at this.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.780
 Constantly dealing with emergencies.

56:39.780 --> 56:40.620
 Okay.

56:40.620 --> 56:41.440
 Okay, this happened.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.280
 What's the next step?

56:42.280 --> 56:43.200
 Yep.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.040
 Accept.

56:44.040 --> 56:44.860
 It's not that big of a deal.

56:44.860 --> 56:46.040
 Every problem has a solution.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.000
 Yeah.

56:47.000 --> 56:47.840
 Yeah.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.680
 And if I can't solve it, it's not my problem.

56:50.680 --> 56:51.520
 You know what I mean?

56:51.520 --> 56:52.340
 Yeah, exactly.

56:52.340 --> 56:54.320
 So what, so how'd you figure it out?

56:54.320 --> 56:55.160
 In sandals?

56:55.160 --> 56:57.320
 Get this, I get to the hotel.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.160
 Yeah.

56:58.160 --> 56:58.980
 I check in.

56:58.980 --> 57:00.700
 I don't even know about the sauna yet.

57:00.700 --> 57:03.240
 I go, I need to find a clothing store.

57:03.240 --> 57:05.280
 I'm in the middle of Russia.

57:05.280 --> 57:08.280
 I open up Google Maps and I'm like, sports store.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.440
 I find an Adidas sports store

57:11.440 --> 57:14.360
 in the middle of Sochi, Russia, right?

57:14.360 --> 57:18.180
 I spend like $500 on like average sweats.

57:18.180 --> 57:21.960
 No plastics, no nothing, and no running shoes

57:21.960 --> 57:22.880
 cause they don't have any.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.400
 What's the temperature outside?

57:24.400 --> 57:25.320
 Is it cold?

57:25.320 --> 57:27.000
 It was kind of like springish.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.200
 So it wasn't cold, but it wasn't hot.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.040
 Yeah.

57:30.040 --> 57:32.640
 So you still need a lot of layers preferably.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.600
 You would need a lot of layers just to cut

57:34.600 --> 57:36.760
 the amount of weight I'm about to tell you I have to cut

57:36.760 --> 57:40.120
 because after I bought that stuff that next morning,

57:40.120 --> 57:42.800
 and mind you, it's a Friday, it's a Friday morning.

57:42.800 --> 57:47.520
 I go to the venue where we have the mats open to train

57:47.520 --> 57:49.440
 and I step on the scale.

57:49.440 --> 57:52.480
 And then Sagan Batar of Mongolia goes,

57:52.480 --> 57:54.940
 oh, pretty good, you're almost there.

57:54.940 --> 57:59.180
 And I go, no, I'm not.

57:59.180 --> 58:01.540
 I stepped on the scale at almost 94 kilos.

58:01.540 --> 58:05.740
 And I looked at him and I was like, I'm 81.

58:05.740 --> 58:07.740
 And he went, good luck.

58:09.540 --> 58:10.760
 You're almost there.

58:11.780 --> 58:12.620
 Yeah.

58:13.880 --> 58:15.740
 For the next weight class above.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.540
 Is this on a Saturday or Sunday?

58:18.540 --> 58:19.380
 Friday morning.

58:19.380 --> 58:20.220
 No, no, no, sorry.

58:20.220 --> 58:22.720
 Friday morning, the competition is when?

58:22.720 --> 58:23.560
 Sunday.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.380
 Sunday.

58:24.380 --> 58:25.700
 I weigh in Sunday.

58:25.700 --> 58:26.540
 Okay.

58:27.420 --> 58:28.980
 I'm like, holy crap.

58:28.980 --> 58:32.700
 I throw on all my layers and there's one other person

58:32.700 --> 58:35.100
 with me there, Kalita, who was my girlfriend at the time,

58:35.100 --> 58:38.020
 now my wife, we start doing judo.

58:38.020 --> 58:40.780
 Cause I'm like, this will be the easiest way to knock off

58:40.780 --> 58:42.940
 like three or four kilos.

58:42.940 --> 58:44.180
 Well, it's cold.

58:44.180 --> 58:48.660
 I have no gi and I'm working out with a female.

58:48.660 --> 58:52.760
 I can't get overly physical to really get my muscles

58:52.760 --> 58:54.260
 going to really break that sweat

58:54.260 --> 58:56.660
 because she has to compete in a day or two.

58:56.660 --> 58:58.180
 She's not a training partner.

58:58.180 --> 59:00.900
 You can't just use this person.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.140
 I stepped on the scale.

59:02.140 --> 59:03.320
 I was 91 kilos.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.780
 So I went, well, I was a nice den, but like,

59:06.780 --> 59:09.640
 yeah, I go, that's not going to fly.

59:09.640 --> 59:13.020
 So sure enough, the clothes are now ruined.

59:13.020 --> 59:15.980
 They didn't help me lose any extra weight.

59:15.980 --> 59:19.740
 So I go back to the hotel and I start reserving the sauna.

59:19.740 --> 59:21.540
 Do you know how hard it is to lose that much weight

59:21.540 --> 59:24.140
 in a sauna by yourself?

59:24.140 --> 59:25.720
 So it's harder on many levels,

59:25.720 --> 59:27.260
 but one of them is just mental.

59:27.260 --> 59:28.340
 Yeah.

59:28.340 --> 59:29.900
 You're sitting in heat.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.340
 Heat, and you're not doing anything.

59:32.340 --> 59:34.860
 Like if there had been a bike or like the sauna

59:34.860 --> 59:36.560
 was big enough to use a jump rope

59:36.560 --> 59:39.860
 or you could do some sort of activity,

59:39.860 --> 59:44.340
 but you just sit and you stew and you're there mentally.

59:44.340 --> 59:46.860
 At one point during the weight cut,

59:46.860 --> 59:49.900
 I actually had my mouth on the bottom part of the door

59:49.900 --> 59:53.900
 where there was a little gap and my legs up on the benches

59:53.900 --> 59:56.900
 and Kalita holding the door so that it didn't open

59:56.900 --> 59:59.260
 so I couldn't open it so that I could lean against

59:59.260 --> 1:00:01.340
 that thing and have fresh air.

1:00:01.340 --> 1:00:03.540
 Cause I was like, I was struggling.

1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:07.580
 And we're talking about, I mean, how many hours is that?

1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:08.420
 Hours.

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:09.260
 And then the thing is,

1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:11.360
 is because you have to reserve the sauna.

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:13.320
 I can't even take like a 30 minute break

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:16.140
 because the sauna is not going to be mine in an hour,

1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:19.180
 which means you have to use the sauna and the heat

1:00:19.180 --> 1:00:21.180
 for that allotted time period.

1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:23.260
 And I hate saunas.

1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:25.540
 That is always my last resort.

1:00:25.540 --> 1:00:26.620
 I would use a bath.

1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:27.500
 I will train.

1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:28.340
 I will run.

1:00:28.340 --> 1:00:29.660
 I will jump rope.

1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:32.740
 Sauna is like, oh, let me do that for 10 minutes

1:00:32.740 --> 1:00:34.860
 after all of my gym workouts,

1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:37.820
 just to keep the sweat going while I stretch and cool down.

1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:39.420
 That's never like the, hey,

1:00:39.420 --> 1:00:41.200
 I'm going to do five, 10 minute sessions

1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:43.420
 because I need to lose two kilos.

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:44.820
 That is never the plan.

1:00:44.820 --> 1:00:45.660
 Yeah.

1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:50.980
 But I mean, so I've done plenty of sauna for weight cuts

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:54.020
 to know I can't even imagine what you went through.

1:00:54.020 --> 1:00:54.860
 Yeah.

1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:56.900
 And the seconds slow down.

1:00:56.900 --> 1:00:59.540
 That's one way to achieve immortality is like

1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:02.020
 the time slows down to like a stop

1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:04.460
 and you're left alone with your thoughts.

1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:05.300
 You can't do anything.

1:01:05.300 --> 1:01:06.420
 Just like you said, you can't.

1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:09.080
 There's nothing worse than sitting in that kind of heat

1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:11.140
 for 10, 15 minutes.

1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:11.980
 Yeah.

1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:15.180
 And then you walk out and you're not even sweating.

1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:16.020
 Yeah.

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:17.060
 There's nothing worse than that.

1:01:17.060 --> 1:01:19.380
 And if you like, and maybe if you weigh yourself,

1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:20.780
 which you probably shouldn't be doing

1:01:20.780 --> 1:01:21.700
 because it'll break you.

1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:22.540
 Yep.

1:01:22.540 --> 1:01:23.420
 You haven't lost anything.

1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:25.100
 Yep.

1:01:25.100 --> 1:01:26.820
 And I was weighing myself every time

1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:28.760
 because I only get breaks

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:31.340
 when I was hitting weight allotments.

1:01:31.340 --> 1:01:34.220
 And so if I could lose 0.3 in 10 minutes,

1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:37.580
 I'd give myself a break, but I had to hit certain numbers

1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:40.260
 because I only have the sauna for a certain amount of time.

1:01:40.260 --> 1:01:42.500
 And I remember one time I went downstairs

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:44.180
 to get my key to the sauna

1:01:44.180 --> 1:01:46.980
 and the Japanese team had reserved it and took it from me

1:01:47.860 --> 1:01:49.300
 because the guy didn't put my name on the list

1:01:49.300 --> 1:01:51.040
 when I called down to get the sauna.

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:54.060
 So I lost an entire session that I had to get made up

1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:55.500
 towards the later part of the day

1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:57.860
 because I still have no running shoes.

1:01:57.860 --> 1:02:01.340
 And then sure enough, my bags show up 30 minutes

1:02:01.340 --> 1:02:02.240
 after weigh ins.

1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:04.940
 Great.

1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:07.380
 That's like the universe just kind of giving you

1:02:07.380 --> 1:02:08.580
 a little wink there.

1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:09.420
 Yep.

1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:15.060
 I think like, because so few people do this weight cut

1:02:15.060 --> 1:02:18.340
 at this high of a level, people don't often realize

1:02:18.340 --> 1:02:20.020
 because people get a sense of how hard it is

1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:22.580
 to run 200 miles in the desert.

1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:25.580
 Like they, cause they go outside here in Texas,

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:26.580
 you can run five miles.

1:02:26.580 --> 1:02:27.620
 Oh, it's hard.

1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:30.500
 But like the weight cut is really,

1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:34.960
 I, can you, so you just, like, how did you do it?

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:37.920
 Just fucking not refusing to.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:38.940
 You have to make weight.

1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:41.340
 You have to make weight and you just, that's.

1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:50.340
 I am astounded when I hear like UFC fighters like miss weight.

1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:51.620
 Right?

1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:56.220
 Like when Jaden Cox missed weight at the Olympic trials,

1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:59.940
 I was like, at least his was understandable

1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:03.020
 because he missed the actual weigh ins.

1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:05.820
 He didn't, he wasn't like not on weight.

1:03:05.820 --> 1:03:08.660
 But when UFC fighters like miss weight,

1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:12.340
 I'm like, how did that happen?

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.480
 You clearly like gave up a long time ago.

1:03:16.540 --> 1:03:19.940
 There were times where I was like, well, I can't do this.

1:03:19.940 --> 1:03:23.780
 There've been times where I've been in a sauna suit

1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:27.240
 wrestling with a training partner who's probably 60 kilos

1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:31.340
 who fought earlier that day to lose point three.

1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:32.980
 Did lose point three.

1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.800
 Like, are you considering your mortality in this moment?

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:39.420
 Like, aren't you thinking you're going to die?

1:03:39.420 --> 1:03:41.340
 Because like, it's severe dehydration.

1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:44.220
 You could damage your body.

1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:51.780
 Are you thinking about any of this or is it just, man.

1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:52.580
 OK, yes.

1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:55.500
 But see, I'm on the other level too where like,

1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:57.100
 I've been in Belgium, right?

1:03:57.100 --> 1:03:59.860
 Belgium, there used to be a B level tournament.

1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:01.860
 And the tournament used to go on.

1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:03.900
 And because I was always on the heavier side,

1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:08.140
 like 81s fights on the second day, which is the heavyweight day,

1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:10.260
 weigh ins were always at like, let's say,

1:04:10.260 --> 1:04:12.540
 2 p.m. the day before for that tournament.

1:04:12.540 --> 1:04:15.100
 Well, there was a sauna at the tournament.

1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:22.820
 I remember like being in the sauna and like, oh, I'm 80.9 kilos.

1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:24.100
 Weigh ins aren't for three hours.

1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:25.700
 Fuck it, I'm going to have lunch.

1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:33.700
 Because I mentally understand that what I eat right now

1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:35.900
 is going to fuel me for tomorrow.

1:04:35.900 --> 1:04:37.500
 So I don't want to skip it.

1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:41.740
 I have the time to put it into my system and still lose it.

1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.180
 It's almost like a computer program.

1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:46.100
 You're running through the process.

1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:50.340
 I get it, but like that all relies on your ability to be.

1:04:50.340 --> 1:04:51.460
 To get it back off.

1:04:51.460 --> 1:04:53.900
 Yeah, I mean, but also just like go through this process,

1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:54.700
 which is painful.

1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:57.020
 It's like those monks who meditate while sitting in a fire

1:04:57.020 --> 1:05:00.660
 kind of thing or something, right?

1:05:00.660 --> 1:05:02.500
 Yeah, it's really interesting.

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:05.580
 Is there other people that are critical to this

1:05:05.580 --> 1:05:07.460
 or is this all internal to you?

1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:09.820
 Are there people that?

1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:14.180
 Everybody has their own way of doing it.

1:05:14.180 --> 1:05:15.980
 Some people don't cut that much.

1:05:15.980 --> 1:05:18.300
 Some people can't weight cut at all, right?

1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:22.580
 They would rather have been like 83 kilos fighting 90

1:05:22.580 --> 1:05:28.980
 than, you know, be 83 kilos fighting 81.

1:05:28.980 --> 1:05:32.540
 So why did you never move up to 90?

1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:33.780
 What's your sense?

1:05:33.780 --> 1:05:36.460
 Is it from your deep understanding of your own judo

1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:40.540
 and like the judo opponents you would face at 90 and 81?

1:05:40.540 --> 1:05:42.980
 Cause 81 is probably the hardest,

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:45.820
 if not the second hardest division in the history of judo

1:05:45.820 --> 1:05:49.100
 compared to 73 and 81.

1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:52.740
 You know, when I was a kid, like I always wanted to be

1:05:52.740 --> 1:05:54.660
 like the middleweight Olympic champion,

1:05:54.660 --> 1:05:57.300
 like the 81 kilo Olympic champion.

1:05:57.300 --> 1:06:00.140
 When I was in high school, I made a decision

1:06:00.140 --> 1:06:01.940
 when I was trying to make weight for 73,

1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:05.860
 I was like, I was cutting weight for 73

1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:09.020
 like I was cutting weight at the end of my career, right?

1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:11.580
 And I was like, I'm just gonna bag it.

1:06:11.580 --> 1:06:12.660
 I'm gonna accept the fact

1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:14.260
 that I may not make a junior world team,

1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:18.020
 I may not make this team, but I'll grow into the division

1:06:18.020 --> 1:06:20.500
 so when I'm a senior player, like I'm ready to go

1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:22.700
 and I'll naturally be stronger.

1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:25.020
 There's an understanding of like a growth process

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.180
 when you move up a weight class.

1:06:27.180 --> 1:06:31.540
 Most people can't just, oh, I'm gonna fight 90s

1:06:31.540 --> 1:06:33.860
 and I'm gonna win because I wanted 81.

1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:37.260
 The style of judo is different, how you move is different,

1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:38.700
 how they do things is different.

1:06:38.700 --> 1:06:41.100
 There's like a learning curve that goes into it.

1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:45.180
 And because the weight cut didn't really happen

1:06:45.180 --> 1:06:47.500
 until I was getting ready for Rio,

1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:49.860
 I wasn't about to have my last Olympic games

1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:51.020
 be at a different weight class

1:06:51.020 --> 1:06:53.820
 that I may or may not be able to grow into.

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:57.860
 I mean, this is an awesome story of you kind of decided

1:06:57.860 --> 1:06:59.820
 that this will be your life's work

1:06:59.820 --> 1:07:03.540
 in terms of judo competitor is like the 81 division.

1:07:03.540 --> 1:07:05.700
 I'm going to, I mean, I don't know if you saw it that way,

1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:07.660
 but you're talking about three Olympics

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:12.660
 and it's like this story of, I would say tragedy and triumph

1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:18.540
 of just wars and 81 kilograms with the usual cast

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:21.980
 of characters of the top five in the world kind of thing.

1:07:21.980 --> 1:07:24.540
 So you just became a scholar of that,

1:07:24.540 --> 1:07:28.020
 let your body grow into it and then let your body outgrow it

1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:31.700
 and still suffer through it to keep it in the 81 kilograms.

1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:34.940
 You never competed at like at the highest levels at 90.

1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:37.980
 I entered one tournament at 90 kilos.

1:07:37.980 --> 1:07:42.980
 And that was because before Rio from the end of 2014,

1:07:46.980 --> 1:07:49.700
 all the way up until Rio's, every time I fought,

1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:54.580
 I got hurt every time there was no time where I made weight

1:07:54.580 --> 1:07:57.300
 and got injured because my body weight was so high.

1:07:57.300 --> 1:08:01.220
 My body fat was so low that by the time I dehydrated enough

1:08:01.220 --> 1:08:04.420
 to get down there and you take the physicality of judo

1:08:04.420 --> 1:08:08.020
 and throw that into the mix, something broke every time.

1:08:08.020 --> 1:08:10.140
 It was like nature of the beast.

1:08:11.260 --> 1:08:15.820
 So the plan was before Rio,

1:08:17.020 --> 1:08:19.060
 we made an agreement with USA judo

1:08:19.060 --> 1:08:21.980
 that Travis, you're gonna fight 90 kilos,

1:08:21.980 --> 1:08:23.740
 but you're not gonna weigh in at 90 kilos.

1:08:23.740 --> 1:08:27.100
 Like, hey, there's no like, you get to be 94 kilos

1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:29.260
 and cut to 90s, there's like a,

1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:31.960
 you're gonna step on the scale at 84 kilos,

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:34.920
 like a little bit of a weight cut, but not a full one,

1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:38.180
 just so that you feel like you get into like the tournament.

1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:41.380
 Because when I, around 2012,

1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:44.500
 when I was talking with the USOC nutritionist,

1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:46.180
 I actually got my weight down so much

1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:48.320
 that I didn't really need to cut weight.

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:49.760
 The problem is, is I wasn't cutting weight,

1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:51.420
 I didn't feel like I was competing.

1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:52.260
 Got it.

1:08:52.260 --> 1:08:55.140
 Right, you have to go through like that mental process.

1:08:55.140 --> 1:08:56.580
 And I never really reworked that,

1:08:56.580 --> 1:08:59.380
 it was easier to just cut the weight and be ready to go.

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:02.960
 But when I entered into the 90 kilo division,

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:05.180
 I was rushed to the hospital the night after

1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:09.500
 because my body broke out in hives, like full body.

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.980
 They said it was stress induced.

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:14.460
 Fascinating.

1:09:14.460 --> 1:09:18.380
 So a month before the games, I was hospitalized and hungry

1:09:18.380 --> 1:09:21.820
 and filled with steroids to get the hives to drop.

1:09:21.820 --> 1:09:25.620
 And every couple days, my body, when I got back home,

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:27.300
 I would end up in the hospital

1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:29.020
 because my whole body would break out again.

1:09:29.020 --> 1:09:31.100
 I wonder if it's like deviating from the process

1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:34.220
 that you so like perfectly crafted already.

1:09:34.220 --> 1:09:36.740
 Or it was stress from my mind thinking,

1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:39.700
 like even though it's not top of mind,

1:09:39.700 --> 1:09:41.820
 there's probably a portion of me that like the Olympics

1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:46.020
 is coming around and it could be my last, that like my body

1:09:46.020 --> 1:09:48.980
 just reacted to something chemically.

1:09:48.980 --> 1:09:50.880
 So I was breaking out in hives.

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:55.740
 I actually bought like a 600 euro Hugo boss suit

1:09:55.740 --> 1:09:59.100
 because when I was in the Netherlands training at the time,

1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:00.780
 I thought I had bed bugs

1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:02.700
 because I was getting bit everywhere.

1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:04.660
 Then I thought there was something in the detergent

1:10:04.660 --> 1:10:07.560
 at the local thing, so I threw away all my clothes.

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:09.260
 Like I was paying for showers

1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:11.740
 because I was trying to get the detergent off my body

1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:13.620
 and buying new clothes at the airport.

1:10:14.940 --> 1:10:16.140
 Trying to figure it out.

1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:18.100
 Trying to figure it out and just go, yeah,

1:10:18.100 --> 1:10:19.220
 accepting the situation.

1:10:19.220 --> 1:10:22.300
 I mean, but the level of stress is exceptionally high here.

1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:24.580
 Can we talk about the other side?

1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:26.740
 People are gonna love this.

1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:31.740
 But you have a long history of persevering through injuries,

1:10:34.460 --> 1:10:36.660
 through insane amounts of injuries.

1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:39.060
 My ability to tolerate pain

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:41.740
 is probably more than most people.

1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:44.760
 But see, injuries aren't just pain, right?

1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:49.180
 It's like, it's also mental, like psychological.

1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:51.260
 Like again, like the weight cut,

1:10:51.260 --> 1:10:53.040
 it can make a lot of people quit.

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:54.420
 Yep.

1:10:54.420 --> 1:10:57.940
 Can you tell your history of injuries?

1:10:57.940 --> 1:10:59.660
 What are the biggest injuries,

1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:01.560
 the toughest injuries in your career?

1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:05.460
 Starting from what, your early teens?

1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:09.820
 My early teens, I actually got out of sports

1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:14.820
 from 11 to, I wanna say like 15 years old, 16 years old,

1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:18.740
 because a kid shot a double leg through my kneecap

1:11:18.740 --> 1:11:21.100
 and I partially tore all the ligaments in my knee,

1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:23.580
 cartilage, meniscus, the whole nine yards.

1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:25.340
 And I had to learn how to walk again.

1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:29.780
 I spent two years in a leg brace, crutches,

1:11:29.780 --> 1:11:32.100
 hobbling around the school yard.

1:11:32.100 --> 1:11:36.180
 That one was a challenge to come back from.

1:11:36.180 --> 1:11:39.160
 I've broken most of my ribs.

1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:42.060
 I won nationals with nine broken ribs.

1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:45.540
 I was actually getting Novocaine shots into my chest

1:11:45.540 --> 1:11:47.420
 to avoid feeling the pain

1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:49.780
 and then wrapping them to try to

1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:51.220
 make sure I didn't pop alone.

1:11:53.860 --> 1:11:55.980
 I've broken my collarbone.

1:11:55.980 --> 1:11:58.400
 I have five herniated disc in my neck.

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:00.720
 I fractured my back twice.

1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:02.300
 I've broken my tailbone.

1:12:02.300 --> 1:12:04.780
 I tore my SI joints.

1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:08.160
 I've torn my right hamstring twice, my left one once.

1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:13.920
 Broken my ankles a few times.

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:16.500
 I spun it once in a 360 that had dev surgery.

1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:20.860
 Fingers, toes, elbows, shoulders.

1:12:20.860 --> 1:12:22.620
 So all of these are, first of all,

1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:28.620
 you're a tough dude, man.

1:12:28.620 --> 1:12:32.720
 So each of those have a story behind them.

1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:37.300
 So if you're talking about the collarbone or the ankles

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:41.260
 or the back, the neck,

1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:43.100
 is there interesting stories here

1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:44.740
 that are behind these injuries?

1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:49.740
 Hard training, hard competing, jiu jitsu, judo.

1:12:49.820 --> 1:12:53.780
 So ground stuff like sparring in the dojo

1:12:53.780 --> 1:12:56.520
 or like drilling or all that kind of stuff.

1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:59.260
 If you were to sort of break it down,

1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:01.080
 your understanding of the landscape

1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.120
 of injuries you went through.

1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:07.020
 I've never had one in jiu jitsu, ever.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:09.940
 I mean, I might've like torn a fingernail

1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:12.880
 or like gotten key burned,

1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:16.840
 but I've never been like seriously injured.

1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:20.640
 I know when Ponza straight ankle locked me at Copa Podio,

1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:24.680
 that hurt, but I wasn't injured.

1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:28.760
 Like it felt sore, but if I had to run, I could run.

1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:31.200
 I can now understand probably exactly

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.000
 what the injuries came from then.

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.400
 You very quickly excelled at jiu jitsu.

1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:39.040
 You achieved another level in judo.

1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:41.880
 And I think that means the intensity

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.280
 with which you approached judo.

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:47.000
 To achieve that world class level

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.280
 probably is the source of the injuries.

1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:54.280
 Yeah, because the mentality of how I approached judo

1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:57.120
 versus jiu jitsu.

1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:02.120
 Jiu jitsu to me is like a game that like we would play.

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:04.680
 Like if you wanted to like grab a basketball

1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:07.520
 and like go play a game of one on one,

1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.040
 that's like jiu jitsu to me.

1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:13.720
 Like I can't take the sport in its entirety seriously.

1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:15.680
 Cause I feel like the community of jiu jitsu

1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:17.360
 doesn't take it seriously.

1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:19.240
 So just for people who don't know,

1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:21.400
 just to set some context,

1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:24.080
 you're a black belt in jiu jitsu,

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:25.640
 but more importantly,

1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:29.920
 you've beaten a lot of world class jiu jitsu people.

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:33.040
 You've done very well at the highest levels of competition.

1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:35.440
 Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily say I've beaten them

1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:39.080
 as much as I've trained with them.

1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:43.000
 And they understand whoever it is

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.520
 that through training with me,

1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:48.640
 that like, I'm not just a judo guy.

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:52.040
 Like I know how to do jiu jitsu, right?

1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:56.680
 And if any one of them were to come to me and like say,

1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:01.680
 hey, I wanna feel what it feels like to do judo with me.

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.280
 They would quickly understand

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:09.560
 that like the way I approach one

1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:12.040
 is very different than the way I approach the other.

1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:14.160
 Like we probably wouldn't be friends

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:17.440
 if they did judo with me versus if they did jiu jitsu with me.

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:19.440
 I'm curious asking for a friend

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:22.880
 because mostly because I'll do a little judo with you today.

1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:25.600
 So you clearly, cause you're a great instructor and teacher,

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:28.520
 you have a mode where you can demonstrate a technique.

1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:33.400
 Do you know how to like spar where you're going like 50%?

1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:37.040
 It's hard to put like a percentage to it

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:42.040
 because I've never in all of my jiu jitsu ever gone 100%.

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:43.480
 In jiu jitsu?

1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:44.320
 Yeah.

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:47.520
 Like I had a conversation with Salo one time

1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:51.200
 where we were talking about like jiu jitsu and training.

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:54.600
 And I was like, well, if I got his arm, I would just break it.

1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:59.280
 And he was like, but what if he tapped?

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:01.740
 I go, that's not my responsibility.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.800
 If he taps and the ref doesn't say anything,

1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:05.880
 you just break it.

1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:07.320
 You just keep going.

1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:08.920
 He goes, but the tap means it's over.

1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:11.280
 And I said, no, the ref tells me when it's over.

1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:14.360
 I go, I never give you the opportunity to tap.

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.320
 Cause if you have the opportunity to tap,

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.520
 that means you had the opportunity to think about

1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:23.200
 how to get out, make a decision that you can't, then tap.

1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:25.200
 I clearly operated too slowly.

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:29.480
 So there's a, it's either broken or I don't have it.

1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.160
 You're a terrifying person to go against in Judo.

1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:36.820
 Like on the ground, like everything you did, that's amazing.

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:39.000
 That's really amazing.

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000
 That's what made you a really fun person to watch.

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.120
 Cause you really went to war with these people.

1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.000
 Yeah.

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.560
 So you know what it's like to go a hundred percent in Judo.

1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:48.400
 I do.

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:52.280
 Cause I know what it's like to train with somebody

1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:54.280
 under the mentality of,

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:56.480
 I'm going to do everything I want to do.

1:16:56.480 --> 1:16:59.180
 You're going to do nothing you want to do.

1:16:59.180 --> 1:17:00.720
 And you're going to accept that.

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:05.400
 Do you ever train in Judo where you let people get stuff?

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:08.440
 Of course, all the time.

1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:09.840
 Now, or like.

1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:10.860
 Always.

1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:12.880
 Even when you're sort of building up the four years,

1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:14.520
 building up to the Olympics,

1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:17.480
 like there's smaller guys that are throwing you in the gym

1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:18.360
 and that kind of stuff.

1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:19.520
 No, I never said that.

1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:20.360
 Okay.

1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:24.280
 That never came out of my mouth.

1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:25.720
 I said, I let people do stuff.

1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:27.920
 I never said smaller people throw me.

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:29.500
 Oh, you mean you let them get a grip,

1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:31.280
 but then you'll position yourself on such a way

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:32.720
 that it's hopeless.

1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:33.600
 It's like.

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.760
 The number one skillset that Judo is going to teach you

1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:41.700
 is the ability to give people false hope.

1:17:43.980 --> 1:17:44.820
 Right?

1:17:44.820 --> 1:17:45.640
 Cause I can let.

1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:46.480
 I'm really looking forward to the video

1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:47.720
 we're going to shoot later today.

1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:50.640
 Like I can let you take a grip.

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:52.880
 I can let you think that there's opportunity,

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:54.840
 but what you don't understand is

1:17:54.840 --> 1:17:57.280
 by the position and angle that I'm in,

1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:59.280
 it's actually false hope.

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:02.160
 Like, as long as you don't know that it is,

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:04.880
 then now I'm free to operate and do what I want.

1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:08.560
 See, I competed in Judo against black belts

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:12.280
 where I would go in and it looks like

1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:13.600
 I could should be able to throw them.

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:15.360
 And then you just hit a wall.

1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:18.720
 And then I also saw you destroy those black belts.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:19.560
 Yeah.

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.400
 So there's levels to this.

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:21.240
 Yeah.

1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:23.380
 It's the cliche thing of there's black belts

1:18:23.380 --> 1:18:24.900
 and there's black belts.

1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:26.160
 You're unique in this.

1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:29.420
 There may be a couple other Jidoka in America,

1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:30.680
 but you're really like unique.

1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:34.080
 I then get to see people that really

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:37.880
 I felt like were 10X better than me.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.360
 It just feels like that sometimes.

1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:41.720
 I've learned that madness and it said it'd be truly

1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:44.000
 might only be just a little better,

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.720
 but I saw you destroy them.

1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:49.260
 And it was like, holy shit.

1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:51.360
 There's a thing in Judo, right?

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:56.360
 Where, you know, imagine like you as like just an adult,

1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:57.400
 right?

1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:01.780
 And I hope people can like conceptualize this

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:02.620
 when they hear this,

1:19:02.620 --> 1:19:04.920
 but imagine like you're a full grown adult,

1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:07.180
 even male, female, it doesn't matter,

1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:08.440
 but there's a little kid in front of you,

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:12.800
 like call him five or six years old and he's acting out.

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:15.720
 Like, do you think you have the physical capability

1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:19.320
 of with one hand grabbing that person or that kid

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:21.880
 and making sure that they freeze?

1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:23.480
 Like they feel like they're nervous

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.080
 and like they can't do anything.

1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:30.020
 When you fight a good Judo player, when they grab you,

1:19:30.020 --> 1:19:32.200
 that's what it feels like as an adult.

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:36.560
 And even I've felt that from like certain players in Japan,

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:37.440
 like when they get a grip,

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:41.560
 I'm like, I've now lost the function of this one.

1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:43.200
 That's a really good way to put it.

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:46.280
 I think I could potentially beat some of the people

1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:50.520
 I've went against, but certain groups they took,

1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:53.880
 it made me feel powerless.

1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:56.160
 I was like, I didn't know this was possible.

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:57.900
 That kind of power was possible.

1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:00.280
 And you don't even know where it originates from.

1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:02.700
 Cause you're like, how does one person's hand do this

1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:04.920
 where I can't use my whole arm?

1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:06.880
 Or like, I can't pick up my right foot

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:09.320
 because he's holding onto my right sleeve.

1:20:09.320 --> 1:20:13.160
 It was kind of on a basic animalistic sense,

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:15.120
 kind of terrifying.

1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:16.840
 It's, I mean, you don't want to,

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.400
 part of this is like ego,

1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:22.940
 but you realize that there's a food chain

1:20:22.940 --> 1:20:24.580
 and you're not at the top of it.

1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:28.120
 That's part of the humbling process,

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:29.160
 I think of martial arts.

1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:31.380
 It's like, I think everybody,

1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:36.360
 like a lot of people think they're much higher

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:37.200
 in the food chain than they are.

1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:38.640
 Than they really are.

1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:39.960
 And then when you realize,

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:42.040
 this is why it's a really healthy process for people

1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:45.060
 that are not even competing in the Olympics

1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:46.240
 to practice martial arts.

1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:47.500
 Cause you realize, okay,

1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:49.960
 that like putting yourself more accurately

1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:53.160
 in the food chain is really good way

1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:55.480
 to sort of place yourself in the rest of the world.

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:58.520
 It humbles you to the reality, the harshness of the world.

1:20:58.520 --> 1:20:59.640
 Yep.

1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:01.720
 It's kind of like when people look at like survival

1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:04.960
 in the wilderness, it's like, oh, it's not that hard.

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:07.520
 No, you'd probably be dying in a couple of days.

1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:09.840
 Same thing with like judo and martial arts.

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:13.180
 Like, yeah, it's really not that hard,

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:15.420
 but you don't know what to do yet.

1:21:15.420 --> 1:21:17.160
 And so when you find out that first time

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:18.920
 that you don't know what to do,

1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:21.120
 it's devastating to a lot of people,

1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:24.740
 but those that like stick through it and like start to learn,

1:21:24.740 --> 1:21:27.880
 it's a very powerful, like feeling that now,

1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:29.900
 like you can take care of yourself.

1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:34.780
 And I think I want to talk to you a few times before

1:21:34.780 --> 1:21:35.620
 you talked about that.

1:21:35.620 --> 1:21:38.900
 There's like, like the top three, the top five in the world.

1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:40.280
 I don't know where you put them,

1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:43.440
 but they're, they're another like level above.

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.040
 They're a whole nother tier, yeah.

1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:46.880
 And the fact that you're, I mean, it's,

1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:50.440
 it's so exciting to me probably

1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:54.120
 because I just felt all the levels here

1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:59.120
 and I've seen you and others at that height destroy those.

1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:03.820
 I've seen the exponential levels to this game.

1:22:03.820 --> 1:22:08.320
 It's incredible that you're, didn't quit,

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:11.560
 didn't doubt yourself and just persevered

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.000
 through three Olympics to get to that highest,

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.120
 always fighting at that like very highest of levels,

1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:21.880
 but just like, you know, from the top 10 to the top five,

1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:25.580
 like really breaking in through that, I don't know.

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:30.880
 What would you say it took to get to that highest of levels?

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:33.080
 Like if you, when you look back to all the weight cuts,

1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:36.960
 to just the insane amount of injuries, believe it or not,

1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:41.280
 I didn't really think I was there until 2013.

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:45.840
 I thought I was recognized as one of the best

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:47.960
 because I was able to fight for Oppensburg,

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:50.600
 which was the professional Bundesliga team for Germany,

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:52.920
 which is one of the top clubs in all of Europe.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000
 When they asked me to, I felt like Europe had like accepted

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.480
 me as like, oh, I'm a top level judo player,

1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:05.460
 but I don't necessarily think that when I signed on

1:23:05.460 --> 1:23:08.800
 to compete for them, that the division or the world

1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:11.960
 of judo saw me as a top level judo player, right?

1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:16.960
 There's a mental shift that happens along that point.

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:21.960
 And for me, my mental shift really came into play

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:26.640
 in December of 2015 before Rio.

1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:30.440
 That was like, when I lost in Japan,

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.960
 that's when I realized like the world respects my abilities

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:36.520
 and they compete against them.

1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:40.400
 They don't compete against me as a person.

1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:49.400
 They compete against the idea or the persona

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:52.760
 that I've been able to establish over the years

1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:54.200
 of competing in the division.

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:57.760
 Wow, so you're the, they probably have a nickname for you.

1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:02.080
 You're the system of ideas and thought that they study.

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:06.540
 But they're studying me as a conceptual whole,

1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:07.860
 not me as the human.

1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:12.860
 Is your style relatively unique in the 81 kilogram division?

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:18.500
 It was relatively unique for Kayla, I and Jimmy

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.760
 up until 2016.

1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.380
 Now since 2016, you can see a lot of what we used to do

1:24:25.380 --> 1:24:27.760
 throughout most of Europe and even Asia.

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:29.580
 Like you're starting to see some of those techniques

1:24:29.580 --> 1:24:32.660
 that you didn't see before starting to get implemented.

1:24:32.660 --> 1:24:37.660
 Because when I was gearing up for 2015,

1:24:38.940 --> 1:24:42.820
 I had such a slew of injuries that entire calendar year

1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:46.340
 that I never should have made it to Rio.

1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:49.420
 I should have called it quits at the end of 2015

1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:54.060
 because I suffered that major concussion in February.

1:24:54.060 --> 1:24:57.620
 I stepped on a mat in May for the first time.

1:24:57.620 --> 1:24:59.960
 I lost five straight tournaments.

1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:04.960
 I left the national team, went to Japan, won Pan Am games,

1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:07.500
 got a bacterial infection at the Worlds,

1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:10.860
 almost had my leg cut off, tore my SI joint later

1:25:10.860 --> 1:25:14.240
 on that year, and then took fifth in Japan.

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:17.360
 And when you look at like the calendar year as a whole,

1:25:18.300 --> 1:25:22.220
 like the world should have treated me like I was washed up.

1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:23.620
 Like this guy hasn't been training,

1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.800
 he hasn't been doing anything, but I took fifth in Japan.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.300
 Now, how does a guy that hasn't trained all year

1:25:30.300 --> 1:25:32.580
 take fifth at one of the hardest tournaments in the world

1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:33.940
 on two weeks of training?

1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:38.260
 Because they were fighting the guy I used to be,

1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:42.460
 not the guy I was at the tournament,

1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:45.920
 which means they were competing under the idea of like,

1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:48.260
 what is he really capable of?

1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:50.540
 Not what have I brought to the table today?

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:54.700
 And that just gave you the confidence.

1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:57.900
 And that told me that like, well, if I can take fifth

1:25:57.900 --> 1:26:00.580
 and I'm this bad at judo right now,

1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:03.140
 wait until I'm healthy and I'm back in shape,

1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:04.780
 then they're not gonna know what hit them.

1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:07.180
 One of the essential components of being the number one

1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:10.980
 in the world or up in that place is that confidence,

1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:11.980
 the self belief.

1:26:11.980 --> 1:26:13.980
 And the rest of the world believing it.

1:26:14.940 --> 1:26:16.540
 You can have all the confidence in the world,

1:26:16.540 --> 1:26:20.100
 but if the rest of the room doesn't buy it, it's nothing.

1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:21.060
 That's funny.

1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:22.620
 It's like, there's certain people, right?

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:24.980
 Oh, Tyson, Mike Tyson.

1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:27.780
 They all understand he could not train

1:26:27.780 --> 1:26:30.220
 and they're still scared, right?

1:26:30.220 --> 1:26:32.420
 Like he doesn't have to work out that hard anymore.

1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:34.900
 There's several judo, you know this way better,

1:26:34.900 --> 1:26:36.380
 but from a spectator perspective,

1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:38.140
 like Ilias Iliadis is like that.

1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:39.460
 He's one of them.

1:26:39.460 --> 1:26:41.300
 It's like, he.

1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:42.780
 He's portrayed over the years.

1:26:42.780 --> 1:26:44.740
 Why is everyone so scared of that guy?

1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:46.940
 It's interesting.

1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:47.780
 Yep.

1:26:47.780 --> 1:26:49.280
 People were scared of you too.

1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:54.040
 People just gave a certain level of respect to my skillset

1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:56.360
 and whether I had a bad weight cut

1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.200
 or didn't have a bad weight cut

1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.120
 or not trained for the last three months,

1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:02.360
 which never happened, I'm just saying,

1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:04.320
 they were gonna fight the persona.

1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:07.480
 And it's an important distinction

1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:08.840
 when you're looking at the top five

1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:12.120
 because everybody coming up,

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:16.880
 they're training against the persona, not who you are.

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:19.880
 Even I did that at a younger age.

1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:22.660
 That's why I would always go to people's hometowns

1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:25.120
 because I don't care about the persona.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:27.980
 I wanna know what you do day in and day out.

1:27:27.980 --> 1:27:29.060
 When I couldn't beat a Russian,

1:27:29.060 --> 1:27:30.760
 I told Jimmy, send me to Russia.

1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:34.320
 I need to understand and see it with my own eyes

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:36.020
 what they do, outperform,

1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:39.880
 so that I can believe that I can beat them.

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:41.760
 Can I ask you on this, a small tangent.

1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:46.360
 Dagestan has produced some incredible wrestlers.

1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:48.560
 I don't know what the story with judo is,

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:53.560
 where the source of greatness in Russia is for judo,

1:27:53.740 --> 1:27:55.520
 but what do you make of Dagestan?

1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:00.120
 Why, what is it in the culture of there or Russia broadly

1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:01.620
 that produces greatness?

1:28:02.700 --> 1:28:05.340
 Specifically in the combat sports.

1:28:05.340 --> 1:28:07.520
 I don't know, yeah, specifically in the combat sports,

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:09.720
 sorry, but I don't know if you wanna draw a distinction

1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:10.920
 between wrestling and judo.

1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:11.880
 I'm almost curious,

1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:15.120
 do you understand the differences there in the culture?

1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:17.120
 It's still a combat sport to them.

1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:20.280
 They're still in that same like realm

1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:25.280
 of they're taking young kids and that's what they do.

1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:29.120
 So Khabib speaks very highly of judo.

1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:33.520
 It's funny, Khabib, Vladimir Putin.

1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:34.340
 People don't get it,

1:28:34.340 --> 1:28:37.440
 but like judo is like one of the premier sports

1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:39.920
 in the world, but we just don't understand it.

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:42.440
 It's not just popularity, so definitely popularity,

1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:44.880
 but also like this respect.

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:47.040
 And there's a certain thing,

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.440
 which is why I really value judo internationally.

1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:51.760
 You don't get this in the United States,

1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.280
 but internationally there's an understanding,

1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:56.880
 like later in life,

1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:59.960
 when you're a scientist meeting a businessman,

1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:01.620
 when you both have done judo,

1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:04.520
 there's this like nod of respect.

1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:06.320
 It's so interesting.

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:07.840
 There's very few sports like that.

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:09.320
 Basketball doesn't have any,

1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:11.680
 I don't know almost any sport like that.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.640
 And it's fascinating.

1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:16.560
 Wrestling has that in the US, but it's the US only.

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.100
 The rest of the world doesn't do that.

1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:21.020
 There's a few, like you could see that in like Iran

1:29:21.020 --> 1:29:21.860
 or something like that.

1:29:21.860 --> 1:29:24.680
 They'll respect wrestling in that kind of way.

1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:26.440
 Yeah, it's...

1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:28.160
 But judo on like a global scale

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:29.800
 is probably that only one,

1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:34.480
 due to its like physicality and the hardships

1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:38.120
 that you have to go through to reach that upper level.

1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:39.520
 So why do you think Dagestan,

1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:41.400
 why do you think Khabib is as good as he is?

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:44.880
 Is this just the raw genetics of the human

1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:46.840
 or is there something about the system?

1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:47.680
 The system.

1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:50.920
 It's all has to do with the system.

1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:55.560
 So they grow up around fighting in all forms.

1:29:55.560 --> 1:29:56.400
 Yep.

1:29:57.400 --> 1:30:00.460
 They're also, I mean, their technique is exceptionally good.

1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:02.720
 Because they grow up in it.

1:30:02.720 --> 1:30:03.560
 They grow up in it.

1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:08.280
 They don't understand anything else.

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:09.120
 So you don't have to,

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:11.160
 it's almost like you with the weight cutting.

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:13.880
 It's not like a big dramatic thing for them to fight.

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:16.040
 It's like, this is just part of life.

1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:16.880
 Yes.

1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:20.280
 And when you're, I don't wanna say bred into it,

1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:23.360
 but when you've done it for,

1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:26.640
 I wanna say like 90% of your life

1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:29.320
 by the time like Khabib probably has,

1:30:29.320 --> 1:30:30.720
 right from the time he could crawl,

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:34.320
 he's probably even grappling in some fashion thereof, right?

1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:38.920
 When you, as grapplers,

1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:42.760
 like you can look at a wrestler and having never seen

1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:45.960
 this person before and go, you wrestled.

1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:47.120
 Yeah.

1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:48.280
 Why is that?

1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:51.600
 It's because he's probably wrestled since he was like six.

1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:53.920
 So the way he carries himself,

1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:55.720
 the way his body is built,

1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:00.720
 the way he grew into it was framed around wrestling, right?

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:03.600
 So the people in that culture are framed

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:06.200
 around fighting and grappling.

1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:07.040
 You're right.

1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:10.320
 First of all, philosophically, psychologically,

1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.240
 but also just like the way you move your body.

1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:13.080
 Yes.

1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:14.680
 That means like when you're young,

1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:16.600
 the people you admire move their body

1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:17.960
 in a certain kind of way.

1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:22.060
 And then genetically, it just, as they keep doing that,

1:31:22.060 --> 1:31:25.480
 they're just gonna get better and better every generation.

1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:26.560
 Yeah.

1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:27.840
 It's just gonna keep improving

1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:30.000
 because they just keep building into that system

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:31.400
 of turning them out.

1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:34.360
 And part of it, there's like cultural stuff where,

1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:36.640
 I mean, it's such an interesting approach to wrestling.

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:39.440
 I really wanna travel to Dagestan and just talk to them

1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:42.020
 because I happen to be able to speak Russian.

1:31:42.020 --> 1:31:45.460
 Because there's less value

1:31:45.460 --> 1:31:49.520
 for this kind of materialistic success

1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:53.500
 that I think sometimes can get in the way of greatness,

1:31:53.500 --> 1:31:54.580
 it seems like.

1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:56.420
 It makes coaching more difficult.

1:31:56.420 --> 1:31:59.800
 It makes like following orders as an athlete more difficult.

1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:00.640
 I don't know.

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.300
 We struggle with that in USA judo.

1:32:02.300 --> 1:32:03.140
 Yeah.

1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:05.080
 Cause you want more money,

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:08.100
 but then more money, if not applied correctly,

1:32:08.100 --> 1:32:09.760
 can corrupt the system.

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:11.160
 Somehow it can split people up.

1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:13.200
 It's just, it's same thing with the prestige

1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:15.100
 around certain medals over others

1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:20.100
 because athletes start chasing fame instead of development.

1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:23.500
 Yeah.

1:32:23.500 --> 1:32:26.320
 Yeah, that's, I mean, the Setia brothers

1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:29.520
 are famous for this, like ignoring fame,

1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:31.960
 ignoring all of this, like focus on the art itself.

1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:34.280
 Not even, so it's not even the medals,

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:35.320
 exactly like you're saying,

1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:38.040
 just the purity of like when you're in it

1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:40.280
 and let everybody else figure out their stupid medals

1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:41.160
 and money and all that.

1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:42.160
 Cause it comes.

1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:43.000
 It comes.

1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:43.820
 Exactly.

1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:44.660
 It's a result.

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:45.500
 Yeah, exactly.

1:32:45.500 --> 1:32:46.880
 Like it's not that you don't appreciate it,

1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:50.320
 but you know that it comes if you focus on the art.

1:32:50.320 --> 1:32:53.400
 There's a distinction when you're talking

1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:58.400
 about your athletic career or really any endeavor, right?

1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:03.340
 The problem with goal setting is nobody teaches the athletes

1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:06.240
 or the people how to transition

1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:08.960
 from the goal to reality, right?

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:12.560
 So when you look at my career as a whole,

1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:15.160
 like when I was getting ready for 2008,

1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:17.260
 I actually forgot to train for it.

1:33:17.260 --> 1:33:19.480
 I was so happy at such a young age

1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:22.600
 that I became an Olympian that that in and of itself

1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:25.660
 was a goal that I thought had to be admired,

1:33:25.660 --> 1:33:28.040
 had to be celebrated that, you know,

1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:30.020
 the games are right around the corner.

1:33:30.020 --> 1:33:32.640
 I didn't really come down off that high.

1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:37.080
 You're the local optimum of just winning the trials.

1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:37.920
 Yeah.

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:38.760
 That was.

1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:39.580
 It's a big thing.

1:33:39.580 --> 1:33:40.420
 It's a huge thing.

1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:42.320
 But then you're just focusing on the accomplishment,

1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:43.160
 not the.

1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:43.980
 Correct.

1:33:43.980 --> 1:33:48.880
 But at some point, right, when I went into London,

1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:51.540
 I actually went into London going with,

1:33:51.540 --> 1:33:53.280
 I'm gonna prove I'm the best in the world

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.440
 cause I believe I'm the best in the world.

1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:58.560
 And I believe it from like the bottom of my soul

1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.380
 that I'm winning this.

1:34:00.380 --> 1:34:04.320
 And then you're almost like trying to tell the universe,

1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.640
 like I'm accomplishing this thing because it's a goal.

1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:09.080
 But when I went into Rio,

1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:13.780
 I just accepted the fact that I was winning.

1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:14.620
 It's not a goal.

1:34:14.620 --> 1:34:16.780
 Like this is happening.

1:34:16.780 --> 1:34:18.440
 You visualize it.

1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:19.540
 But I felt it.

1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:20.440
 You felt it.

1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:21.280
 Right?

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:23.120
 Like this is no longer a goal anymore.

1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:27.420
 Like I anticipated, like this is happening.

1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:29.980
 I can see this coming down the path

1:34:29.980 --> 1:34:33.740
 because I'm anticipating that the games is happening

1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:34.580
 and I'm gonna win.

1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:35.860
 It's not a goal.

1:34:35.860 --> 1:34:36.820
 It's an anticipation.

1:34:36.820 --> 1:34:39.140
 And there's a distinct distinction there

1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:39.980
 between the two.

1:34:41.380 --> 1:34:44.660
 Okay, so for people who are just watching the video of this,

1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:49.660
 there should be an overlay of Young Travis.

1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:52.780
 This is, you still had to make 81.

1:34:52.780 --> 1:34:54.920
 Is this still a tough cut here?

1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:56.680
 No, this one was relatively easy.

1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:59.700
 This is going all the way back to 2008.

1:34:59.700 --> 1:35:03.500
 So this is the summer before the games.

1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:08.500
 This probably happened in June, I would say.

1:35:08.860 --> 1:35:11.740
 So this is the Olympic trials.

1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:13.500
 So in the United States,

1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:15.980
 you have to, I mean, similar to like wrestling,

1:35:15.980 --> 1:35:18.300
 you have to win the trials to qualify

1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:19.880
 for that particular division

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:21.700
 to represent the United States.

1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:24.600
 So this is, you said June before an August Olympics?

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:25.740
 Yep.

1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:27.940
 So here, I just wanted to show this match

1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:31.180
 because what was, there's another one.

1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:32.300
 I think you do a pin,

1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:34.420
 you do some nice ground work in the other one.

1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:35.760
 But in this one.

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:39.300
 Fighting a teammate.

1:35:39.300 --> 1:35:40.260
 Fighting a teammate.

1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:41.100
 Former teammate.

1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:42.440
 Oh, there's an old school double leg.

1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:43.640
 I forgot about that.

1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:44.780
 And it's weird to see.

1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:49.780
 So there, the Travis's opponent,

1:35:49.780 --> 1:35:51.420
 and Travis is setting up here

1:35:51.420 --> 1:35:58.420
 that Sayonagi posting his left arm and getting it done.

1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.380
 That's a big, that's a big throw.

1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:06.060
 You don't have too many of those big throws on video.

1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:07.840
 Cause like you often on video,

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.700
 you're going against the best people in the world.

1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:12.260
 It's tough to get like that much air.

1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:15.040
 And a lot of times the ones that we do see

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.540
 and the part that a lot of people don't experience

1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:21.780
 is a lot of those times

1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:23.780
 where I threw people with that throw,

1:36:23.780 --> 1:36:25.680
 it was in training camps.

1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:29.020
 So by the time I got to the competition with these guys,

1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:32.000
 they were playing a hundred percent defense

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:33.400
 to never let me do that.

1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:34.420
 Yeah.

1:36:34.420 --> 1:36:36.900
 So you do this here.

1:36:36.900 --> 1:36:38.420
 Are you kind of pulling him down?

1:36:38.420 --> 1:36:41.580
 No, he's, I'm trying to get him to come up.

1:36:41.580 --> 1:36:43.580
 But are you pulling him down to get to fake him out?

1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:45.680
 I'm not doing anything with my left hand.

1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.820
 So here the opponent is.

1:36:48.820 --> 1:36:52.600
 So what I'm doing right now is his head is like in my chest.

1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:57.120
 I'm pressing him to get his head to lift with my chest.

1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:00.980
 So I'm pressing his hand down so I can use my chest

1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:04.180
 to like pinch my scaps and roll his head up

1:37:04.180 --> 1:37:05.680
 so that he wants to pick it up.

1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:10.620
 And then he, I mean, doesn't he know what's coming here?

1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:12.660
 Oh no, he might not.

1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:14.380
 Oh no, he knew, he was a former teammate.

1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:16.540
 He knew exactly what I was trying to do.

1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:20.220
 And that was a really big step with your right foot.

1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:25.220
 It covers about four feet in distance.

1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:31.380
 And your left catches up in like perfect position.

1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:34.380
 Yeah, you back it up a little bit.

1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:39.020
 Keep going, keep going.

1:37:39.020 --> 1:37:41.980
 Right there, this is like an important distinction

1:37:41.980 --> 1:37:44.240
 between mine and everybody else's

1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:47.200
 is because I split his hip,

1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:50.940
 I actually, once I'm able to split,

1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:54.760
 I no longer need his center of gravity below mine.

1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:56.860
 Right, and when you say split,

1:37:56.860 --> 1:37:59.540
 you mean you put your foot in between.

1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:02.180
 I do that split, that four foot split.

1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:04.700
 And then when I get my feet back together,

1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:06.980
 it doesn't matter that I'm under his center of gravity

1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:07.820
 or not.

1:38:09.060 --> 1:38:13.980
 That's why my chest is right around his sternum height

1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:15.180
 for me.

1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:17.900
 Yeah, so there, I mean, how does he get,

1:38:17.900 --> 1:38:19.140
 for people just listening to this,

1:38:19.140 --> 1:38:23.900
 Travis Steps does a big, huge step, gets.

1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:26.860
 Like my hip is probably right around his nipple

1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:28.900
 because he's sprawled back so much.

1:38:28.900 --> 1:38:30.400
 Yeah, that's right.

1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:33.220
 So like, so you're, how does the physics of this work?

1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:36.320
 You're violating the principle of your center of mass

1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:38.900
 being under, oh, I guess somehow it is.

1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:40.820
 I don't know, but he has nowhere to go.

1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:41.940
 He's screwed.

1:38:41.940 --> 1:38:46.940
 Yes, that's the kicker is the way mine works is

1:38:47.580 --> 1:38:50.820
 in order for him to play an effective defense,

1:38:50.820 --> 1:38:53.960
 he needs to have his feet firmly planted on the ground

1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:55.420
 with friction.

1:38:55.420 --> 1:38:56.260
 Yeah.

1:38:56.260 --> 1:38:59.040
 Otherwise he can't press into me to stop it.

1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:02.340
 So when I get him to sprawl back, when I split his legs,

1:39:02.340 --> 1:39:05.620
 he effectively loses that contact with the floor.

1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:07.700
 Even though his feet are on the floor,

1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:10.200
 they're not in a position where he can drive from them.

1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.040
 Yeah.

1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:12.860
 So therefore when I flip, he flips.

1:39:12.860 --> 1:39:17.700
 So there's a natural like flailing here.

1:39:17.700 --> 1:39:20.260
 So he's not falling forward.

1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:21.700
 You're falling forward.

1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:22.520
 Yeah.

1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:23.360
 He's just attached to you.

1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:25.080
 So like you can keep him up there

1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:27.100
 and then like legs would be just flailing.

1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:30.760
 Yep, one of my golden rules when I'm training

1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:33.780
 and I get really tired, one of the like mantras

1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:36.640
 I would always tell myself is I'm gonna put my back

1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:39.580
 on your chest and then I'm gonna put my back on the floor.

1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:40.420
 Yeah.

1:39:40.420 --> 1:39:41.500
 It's gonna be underneath me.

1:39:41.500 --> 1:39:42.940
 That's a good principle to.

1:39:42.940 --> 1:39:43.940
 It's very simple.

1:39:43.940 --> 1:39:46.500
 And it, regardless of like all the chaos

1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:48.380
 and how quickly things are happening,

1:39:48.380 --> 1:39:50.460
 it's something I can just dumb everything down to

1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:51.820
 and focus on.

1:39:51.820 --> 1:39:54.240
 Regardless of the gripping situation, the footwork,

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:56.460
 all of that, get my back to your chest

1:39:56.460 --> 1:39:58.180
 and then put my back on the floor.

1:39:58.180 --> 1:40:02.400
 So this step of getting your back to their chest,

1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:04.860
 like for people who are sort of more,

1:40:04.860 --> 1:40:07.180
 like for example, for people like me,

1:40:07.180 --> 1:40:09.580
 who are just like amateur Judo people,

1:40:09.580 --> 1:40:12.900
 like there's all kinds of ways to prevent this turn

1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:15.540
 from happening, the gripping and just everything.

1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:19.420
 How difficult is it at the highest level

1:40:19.420 --> 1:40:21.780
 to get into this position?

1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:23.960
 I mean, you make it look effortless often,

1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:25.780
 but like to get to the position where you're

1:40:25.780 --> 1:40:29.640
 from facing them to your back is to them.

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:30.940
 Is that like strategy?

1:40:30.940 --> 1:40:32.060
 Is that timing?

1:40:32.060 --> 1:40:32.900
 Is that?

1:40:32.900 --> 1:40:34.180
 Timing.

1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:35.000
 It's timing.

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.260
 It's like anything, like if I wanted to punch you

1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:41.100
 in the face, like how hard is it to really do that

1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:44.220
 if you know you can just play defense and block it?

1:40:44.220 --> 1:40:46.260
 The trick is to get them to play defense

1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:48.140
 to something that never happened.

1:40:50.780 --> 1:40:52.520
 And then you go through like another way.

1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:54.780
 And then you just go through what would technically

1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:58.220
 be your first plan if you planned on them playing defense.

1:40:58.220 --> 1:41:02.180
 So I set the stage from the very beginning for this to work.

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:07.300
 So then this, you're celebrating here,

1:41:07.300 --> 1:41:11.660
 it's a huge sort of, once a big accomplishments,

1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:14.980
 big relief to qualify for the Olympics.

1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:16.740
 And then you go into the Olympics

1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:19.440
 and this is where I first saw Judo.

1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:21.940
 And I kind of thought of them as the same

1:41:21.940 --> 1:41:23.160
 as Judo and Jiu Jitsu.

1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:26.440
 And I was really impressed by your performance

1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:28.420
 in that Olympics.

1:41:28.420 --> 1:41:30.580
 The footage nowhere to be found these days,

1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:34.300
 but at that time I think you could still,

1:41:34.300 --> 1:41:36.940
 you could watch it live on NBC Olympics

1:41:36.940 --> 1:41:38.860
 or somewhere like that.

1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:41.200
 And I remember watching several of your matches.

1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:45.180
 One of them was the match against Ole Bischoff, the German.

1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:47.100
 And I remember being, it'd be nice

1:41:47.100 --> 1:41:49.400
 if you can talk to that match because I don't remember it.

1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.240
 All I remember is being frustrated.

1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:54.520
 Yep.

1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:58.540
 By him not letting you play Judo.

1:41:58.540 --> 1:41:59.420
 Yeah.

1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:03.460
 So obviously you faced him again four years later

1:42:03.460 --> 1:42:05.500
 and there's a lot of frustration there as well.

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:09.180
 But I remember being extra frustrated in 2008.

1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:10.300
 What was that match like?

1:42:10.300 --> 1:42:12.900
 So he might've been number one in the world at the time

1:42:12.900 --> 1:42:13.740
 or up there?

1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:18.420
 He was up there for sure, especially going into 2008.

1:42:18.420 --> 1:42:19.780
 He was really high up there.

1:42:19.780 --> 1:42:20.620
 Yeah.

1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:24.940
 And did he win gold at that Olympics?

1:42:24.940 --> 1:42:25.780
 Yes.

1:42:25.780 --> 1:42:26.600
 Yeah.

1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:27.440
 Because he silvered in London.

1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:31.420
 It was the same Olympic final both in 2008 and London.

1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:32.340
 Yeah.

1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:35.660
 Okay, so you're facing him there.

1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:36.720
 Were you intimidated?

1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:37.560
 What was the strategy?

1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:39.640
 Can you talk to that match?

1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:43.860
 Because it kind of sets the stage for the rematch in 2012.

1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:48.060
 Yeah, he was somebody that I had trained with in the past.

1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:51.940
 And for some reason, when it comes to him and I,

1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.520
 when we train together,

1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:57.800
 it's more of a physical altercation

1:42:57.800 --> 1:42:59.440
 than a Judo training session.

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:04.440
 It's just the coaches have had to break us up a few times.

1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:06.920
 Or you guys get almost angry too?

1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:07.740
 A little bit.

1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:11.320
 It always goes farther than it should.

1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:12.160
 We're friends.

1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:13.560
 We say hello to each other.

1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:15.480
 But for some reason, when we train together,

1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:19.360
 there's something about him and me that just oil and water.

1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:20.440
 I don't know what it is.

1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:21.640
 Could it be also the gripping?

1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:24.160
 Because he's a great gripping strategist.

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.320
 Does he frustrate you with certain kinds of grips

1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:28.940
 and then you get pissed off and then you frustrate him?

1:43:28.940 --> 1:43:30.080
 And then he gets pissed off

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:32.240
 and then before you know it, somebody's kicked somebody

1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:34.760
 or punched somebody in the mouth or done something.

1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:38.120
 Yeah, so one of the only evidences we have online

1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:43.120
 of you fighting him is your foot in his groin area

1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:46.600
 is the only thing we have from that Olympics.

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:47.720
 From 2008.

1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:48.920
 From 2008, yeah.

1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:52.680
 And to answer everybody's question, yes, it was deliberate.

1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:53.940
 Now you can say this.

1:43:53.940 --> 1:43:54.780
 Yeah.

1:43:54.780 --> 1:43:57.560
 But yeah, I remember there being a lot of frustration.

1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:59.920
 You're actually going for a lot of stuff

1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:00.800
 like sacrifice throws.

1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:01.920
 I mean, maybe you're not going

1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:03.440
 for the highest scoring epons,

1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:05.280
 but you're just trying to shake things up,

1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:06.460
 if I remember correctly.

1:44:06.460 --> 1:44:09.880
 Yeah, because when he, I was so young then that,

1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:13.120
 and he was in his prime really at that time, right?

1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:18.120
 He must've been 24, 25, 26,

1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:22.280
 world medalist, European champion at the time.

1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:24.380
 And when he would grab me,

1:44:24.380 --> 1:44:27.460
 I had that sense of feeling stuck.

1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:30.280
 Like I was strong enough if I used all my strength

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:32.200
 to not let him do anything,

1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:33.600
 but then you can't be offensive

1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:34.840
 when you're using all your strength

1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:38.000
 to hold onto the situation.

1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:39.880
 So I was getting really aggravated

1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:43.320
 because I couldn't generate any offense

1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:45.640
 with every time I felt like I gained an advantage

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:47.200
 in the gripping scenario,

1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:50.940
 he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like,

1:44:50.940 --> 1:44:52.640
 well, now I've got to go address this thing,

1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:54.820
 give up what I gained and I have to go back.

1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:59.520
 And if I were to think about watching the match now,

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:01.720
 it probably looked like a lot of flailing

1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:04.440
 because we're just trying to generate enough

1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:05.960
 to not get a penalty,

1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:08.780
 but also not enough to where he could counter it.

1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:11.840
 Did you think you could beat him

1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:14.200
 like when you were walking into the match?

1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.000
 Until I gripped him for the first time,

1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:19.120
 like, cause I had trained with him before,

1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:21.940
 he felt stronger and more in shape

1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:24.640
 than I've ever felt him that day.

1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:29.640
 At that Olympics, which begs a whole nother question.

1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:35.360
 But I remember when he grabbed me for that first time,

1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:39.620
 I went, this is different.

1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:42.760
 And there was a sense of panic at the time

1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:45.960
 cause I was like, holy crap, where did this come from?

1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:49.960
 This is not the guy that I've trained with that I expected.

1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:53.880
 Cause it was a definite like level change

1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:57.680
 in like his ability, strength, speed, and stamina.

1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:00.360
 Like looking back at that, can you explain that?

1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:04.280
 Is it just you being more, less confident

1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:05.480
 because it was the Olympics?

1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:08.560
 It was, is there some kind of routine that he followed

1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:10.840
 to like really level up in intensity

1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:12.200
 for this particular event?

1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:17.160
 I've been told that he only gets to like his prime

1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.320
 for like really big events.

1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:23.920
 Like he doesn't train like year round like I would train,

1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:25.440
 but when it comes to like the games,

1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:29.040
 he doesn't do social media, he doesn't work,

1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:33.400
 he lives, breathes, eats his training for the games,

1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:36.500
 which could institute that level.

1:46:36.500 --> 1:46:37.680
 What about you?

1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:40.480
 Is there a, like Dan Gable famously said,

1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:42.480
 like the one loss he had in college,

1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:44.120
 he was doing a lot of media and stuff.

1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:46.320
 Back then there was no social media.

1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:48.560
 That was a huge mistake for him.

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:51.160
 Do you do social media, do you do like?

1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:52.480
 At that, at this point?

1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:53.720
 Well, at that time it was like AOL.

1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:55.000
 I don't know, what's 2008?

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:58.240
 I didn't even have a Facebook page, a MySpace,

1:46:58.240 --> 1:46:59.600
 nothing at this point.

1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:04.240
 I got my first Facebook page from the USOC in 2012.

1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:05.400
 When I went through the media thing,

1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:07.680
 the lady was like, you have to have it.

1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:08.960
 I go, I don't want it.

1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:09.960
 I don't like people.

1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:11.960
 I want to deal with the people.

1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:13.200
 What am I supposed to do?

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:15.280
 You know, like the social part of the social media.

1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:16.120
 No.

1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:17.920
 Okay.

1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:20.320
 I have to bring this up because,

1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:22.800
 and then you went on to face Tiago Camilo.

1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:24.920
 You lost that match, but he went on to win bronze.

1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:27.480
 That's also an interesting one, but we can skip ahead.

1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:29.000
 I just remember being really impressed

1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:30.440
 both by your groundwork.

1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:33.280
 That was a match I should have won.

1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:34.120
 Yeah.

1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:34.960
 I should have won that.

1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:38.480
 I was, if you don't know judo,

1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:40.880
 you would visually watch that and be like, I'm winning.

1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:43.240
 But he was technically winning on the scoreboard.

1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.760
 So it is what it is.

1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:47.520
 But the point that he got that solidified his win,

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:51.800
 yes, it was a point back in those days.

1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:55.240
 So I can't say anything, but like my shoulder

1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:56.840
 nicked the ground.

1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.400
 So it's like, I don't know.

1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:01.560
 Yeah. A lot of the stories of your Olympic career

1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:04.680
 is like from a fan perspective,

1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:06.720
 it seems like you should have won

1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:09.080
 or you very close to could have won.

1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:09.920
 Yes.

1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:11.280
 And there was a lot of frustration in you

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:14.120
 and your game being like shut down in certain ways.

1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:19.120
 But like the thing that immediately grabbed me in 2008

1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:22.960
 was how much, something about the way you approached judo,

1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:24.880
 how much you wanted to win.

1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:26.440
 Cause I was young then.

1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:31.000
 I was, when I was at this time of my career,

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.040
 I was out to like win.

1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:36.320
 Like there was no like, I'm going to grab you,

1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:37.160
 I'm going to throw you.

1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:40.240
 And if not, you're going to go through a battle.

1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:41.080
 Yeah.

1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:42.640
 You're going to make sure you earned it.

1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:46.120
 It so happened that you competing in 2008,

1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:51.240
 I was, I became a fan of yours at that moment.

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:55.040
 And since then, I kind of knew about judo.

1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:57.640
 My university had a judo club

1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:01.800
 and I kind of knew about jujitsu from mixed martial arts.

1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:04.280
 And obviously I wrestled for many years before

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:06.000
 and I love wrestling,

1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:09.960
 but there's something about you competing that made me,

1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:11.080
 well, there's no other way to say it,

1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:12.680
 but it like changed the direction of my life.

1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:15.360
 Cause it forced me to say, you know what?

1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:18.040
 I'm going to start judo and jujitsu.

1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.800
 And first of all, for that, I'm really grateful,

1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:22.120
 but it's fascinating to think,

1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.200
 because this kid who's 22 years old,

1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.680
 I'm sure I'm not the only one that you've influenced,

1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:30.080
 like you've changed the direction of my life.

1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:33.600
 And there could be huge number of others like that.

1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:36.520
 I mean, that's the power of you as an individual

1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:38.760
 at the, on the Olympic stage.

1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:40.200
 You ever think about the pressure of that?

1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:42.640
 Did you, did you think as a 22 year old,

1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:44.480
 there's a bunch of people,

1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:46.680
 like I know I'm not the only one who changed.

1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:50.440
 I just happened to have like a microphone recently.

1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:51.280
 You know what I mean?

1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:54.520
 Like, is that, it's fascinating to think about, right?

1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:57.280
 Like you, perhaps you didn't think about this.

1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.400
 It's just, it's just a judo match,

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:02.600
 but you like, you influenced hundreds of thousands of people

1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:03.440
 if not millions.

1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:04.800
 Is that interesting?

1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:09.640
 It's, it's not something that really hit me

1:50:09.640 --> 1:50:14.640
 until 2012 when I lost,

1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:18.880
 because that's when like,

1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:25.520
 I would say like the world felt bad for me at that point.

1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.520
 And that's when you knew that like people were watching

1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.080
 and people were inspired by the loss

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.240
 because of how much went into that match.

1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:41.080
 Because, you know, the 99% of us who watched it

1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:44.520
 thought I won, except for the 1% of the people

1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:48.280
 who were considered judges at that day in the event.

1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:49.200
 So.

1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:52.240
 But I mean, that's the, the win or lose,

1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:54.200
 that, that was a really inspiring match.

1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:57.040
 And that's when it, that's when it dinged that like,

1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:00.680
 because I don't, I don't watch something

1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:05.160
 and really get inspired by like the person and the act.

1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:07.400
 It's like a, it's an accumulative thing.

1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:12.080
 But for a lot of people, like when they watch

1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:13.840
 how much goes into it,

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:16.040
 and then when I broke down on the match,

1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:18.800
 like the amount of suffering that happens

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:20.320
 when you lose a match like that.

1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:25.320
 And then, you know, really coming back and winning in Rio,

1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:29.200
 there's a trend of people who were inspired

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:30.920
 that knew about London.

1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:33.520
 And then when they found out I won in Rio,

1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:36.920
 that's when like people like in droves felt like

1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:39.440
 they could overcome their own personal obstacles

1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:41.440
 to still achieve something

1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:44.160
 because they've witnessed somebody who's fallen

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:45.280
 and gotten back up.

1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:47.280
 Yeah.

1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:51.520
 But it's not something that you think about like on the day.

1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:55.920
 It's when you look back and you go, oh, cause and effect.

1:51:55.920 --> 1:51:57.680
 I wonder if you can comment on that.

1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:01.760
 I'm trying to realize and live up to the fact

1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:05.680
 that there's like young people that come up to me

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:09.240
 and I'm starting to realize like certain words I say

1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:11.400
 will have a long lasting impact on them.

1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:12.240
 Yep.

1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:14.560
 Cause you say it as like, you don't even,

1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:16.560
 it doesn't just, the whim.

1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:19.320
 Some of them might come back 30 years later

1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:22.800
 and a word I said was the reason they quit a thing

1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:24.640
 and started the new thing that led them

1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:27.880
 to become their true self, like to find success,

1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:29.200
 all that kind of stuff like.

1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:32.600
 On the flip side though, some people based on the actions

1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:35.720
 that we do today, even with this cast

1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:40.120
 will alter the course of their lives forever.

1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:44.840
 I had a guy one time, was it after London?

1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:46.920
 It must've been after London.

1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:50.160
 He actually found me on Instagram,

1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:53.920
 wrote me what seemed to be like a dissertation on Instagram

1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:58.800
 about how much I disrespected him

1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:03.320
 14 years earlier because I didn't step on a podium

1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:05.280
 to take a picture after winning a tournament

1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:06.920
 where he bronzed.

1:53:06.920 --> 1:53:07.760
 Yeah.

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:11.640
 And I'm thinking to myself, like at the time,

1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:14.160
 like having dinner with my family

1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:15.760
 because I had to leave the next morning

1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:18.600
 was more important to me as a person,

1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:23.600
 not thinking about who you potentially will become

1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:28.600
 and the actions of whatever you do today,

1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:32.160
 if you do become quote unquote famous

1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:34.280
 or somebody in a spotlight,

1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:36.520
 that that could come back to bite you.

1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:37.600
 To me, I don't know about you,

1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:40.520
 that's super motivating,

1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:45.520
 like not to be a lesser version of myself ever.

1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:47.320
 Yeah.

1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:49.280
 Just be on top of your game, whatever that game is,

1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:51.360
 be on top of your game when you interacting with people

1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:53.920
 and when you're just in your own private life.

1:53:53.920 --> 1:53:54.760
 I'm trying to make sure

1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:56.560
 that I'm the exactly same person privately

1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:00.160
 as I am publicly and like making sure I'm on point.

1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:03.560
 I see like just hanging out with Joe Rogan a lot.

1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:06.720
 I see how he's, first of all, the exact same person.

1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:10.080
 And second, he like walks around

1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:11.720
 and there's like a huge number of fans

1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:14.840
 and you'll just take pictures and like, it's very cool.

1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:17.440
 And it's very cognizant of like certain words he says,

1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:20.200
 especially young people, like they're going to take that.

1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:21.920
 And that's going to be a memory for them

1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:24.240
 for a couple of years that might be influential

1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:25.120
 for the rest of their life.

1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:28.440
 So I don't know, that's a cool responsibility,

1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:31.640
 not to fuck it up.

1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:36.160
 But anyway, I bring all that up to just say, thank you.

1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:40.200
 So even if you like were frustrated

1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:41.560
 that you didn't win a medal,

1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:46.560
 at least you influenced one silly Russian kid

1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:48.160
 to get into the martial arts.

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:50.080
 And what happens when you get into martial arts,

1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:52.000
 it alters the direction of your life.

1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.640
 Mine for the better.

1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:59.640
 Okay, so let's go to London 2012 Olympics.

1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:05.240
 One of the most dramatic judo battles of all time rematch.

1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:10.600
 So you've reached the semifinals once again

1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:13.040
 to face the German, Ole Bischoff.

1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.800
 Do you mind if we step through that match a little bit?

1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:19.560
 Yeah, by all means.

1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:23.160
 I've only ever watched the entire thing one time

1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:27.760
 just because, fucking.

1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:31.960
 So for context, for the listener,

1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:36.320
 Travis, first of all, you don't like losing.

1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:38.640
 I think that's fair to say.

1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:41.680
 You know, the hard part with this match

1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:45.360
 is because I went into this Olympics thinking,

1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:47.240
 I'm gonna fucking win the Olympics.

1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:48.520
 I'm the best in the world.

1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.400
 I never in my right mind thought,

1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.880
 oh, I'm gonna win a medal.

1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.200
 Like that never crossed my mind.

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:06.200
 So it's like, I would have rather him just fucking beat me.

1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:11.080
 Because then I lost.

1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:15.480
 So here the referees, as many people thought,

1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:16.920
 robbed you of a victory,

1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:18.600
 but it was also a really close battle.

1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:22.880
 Again, with many of the elements of frustration as 2008

1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:25.360
 in terms of strategically and gripping wise.

1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:28.720
 And it was just a fascinating battle that went to overtime.

1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:30.760
 So can you set the context?

1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:33.400
 So what did the bracket look like?

1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:35.000
 Who were the players here?

1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:38.720
 Who did you beat leading up to this match?

1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:43.640
 As you walk onto the mat, what happened the hours before?

1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:44.960
 As you're standing there.

1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:48.560
 How bad is it when two people are standing like this?

1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.160
 And yeah.

1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:51.320
 That fucking guy, man.

1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:57.360
 But this bracket was really interesting

1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:00.360
 if you look at like the backstory of 81 kilos,

1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:03.000
 like leading up to the Olympics, right?

1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.760
 Because at this point in time,

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.960
 I was inside the top 10 at all times,

1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:14.160
 eight, seven, five, four, sixes.

1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:16.040
 I fell out of there sometimes due to injuries,

1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:17.480
 but I always climbed back in.

1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:23.480
 There was another guy from Azerbaijan

1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:27.280
 that was the Olympic champion at 73 kilos in 2008.

1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:33.280
 And the entire division got rocked by match one

1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:38.280
 because his first match was with Antoine Valus Fortier

1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:40.240
 of Canada.

1:57:41.320 --> 1:57:45.520
 And everybody who saw the draw come out was like,

1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:47.680
 the Azerbaijanis gonna win it.

1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:49.840
 He's the former Olympic champion.

1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:52.400
 He's pretty much won most of the major events,

1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:55.480
 including at 90 kilos, because he just had smooth judo.

1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:01.920
 And match one rolls around, match two rolls around.

1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:05.240
 Antoine's in the shoot and he's looking around

1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:09.040
 and he's like, the Azerbaijanis not here.

1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:10.640
 Well, where is he?

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:15.640
 No joke, he runs into the venue a match before,

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:19.560
 throws his gi on and runs onto the Olympic platform.

1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:22.160
 Loses to the Canadian

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:24.720
 in like a three minute golden score battle.

1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:28.400
 So do you think he warmed up?

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:29.320
 Didn't, he ran.

1:58:29.320 --> 1:58:31.880
 He literally ran into the venue,

1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:34.560
 threw his gi on and ran out, did no judo.

1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:39.080
 And there you see Antoine losing in the quarters.

1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:42.840
 So how good was Antoine?

1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:45.200
 At this point in time, this is,

1:58:45.200 --> 1:58:48.400
 I believe his first international medal

1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:49.560
 was the Olympic games.

1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:53.960
 So I don't think he'd ever meddled in Paris.

1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:57.200
 He went into this bracket unranked,

1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:00.840
 beating the ranked guy first round because he,

1:59:00.840 --> 1:59:02.960
 I don't know if he missed the bus.

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:06.800
 I don't know if he was off his cycle and planned on losing

1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:08.360
 cause he didn't want to test positive.

1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:09.600
 I don't know.

1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:12.800
 There's a lot of like questionable things out there

1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:15.960
 that could have potentially caused him to,

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:20.640
 run onto the Olympic platform for match one.

1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.720
 But it catapulted Antoine into like a belief

1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:31.720
 that like, I beat the seated guy, I'm ready.

1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:34.560
 And that was like a turning point in the Canadian's career

1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:37.560
 just as a whole, right?

1:59:37.560 --> 1:59:40.960
 That's that everybody has a defining moment.

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:45.040
 Like mine was when I beat Bischoff in Dusseldorf

1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:49.800
 at the grand prix for Germany after 2008, right?

1:59:49.800 --> 1:59:53.240
 I beat the Olympic champion in, on his home soil

1:59:53.240 --> 1:59:55.480
 to go win the entire tournament.

1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:57.960
 So we all have like those moments.

1:59:57.960 --> 2:00:00.120
 It's just when it happens at the games,

2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:02.920
 it throws the bracket like into a tailspin.

2:00:02.920 --> 2:00:05.640
 Cause typically you'd know like who's going to beat who,

2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:07.680
 where it's going to happen.

2:00:07.680 --> 2:00:11.640
 And when you look at my quarter final against the Brazilian,

2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:14.120
 what most people don't know is I was,

2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:16.480
 I was so thankful I had that match.

2:00:16.480 --> 2:00:19.920
 Most people would never in a million years be like,

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:22.280
 I want to fight the world number one at the Olympic games.

2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:23.680
 That's what I want to do.

2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:25.880
 I want to be the eighth seed fighting the world number one

2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:26.920
 cause I'm going to win.

2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:29.800
 I was pissed off at him.

2:00:29.800 --> 2:00:34.080
 I was so angry because we,

2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:37.800
 we were at the Pan Am's I think the year before

2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:40.300
 and there was a team tournament and I wanted to fight him.

2:00:40.300 --> 2:00:45.300
 I had lost the quarters to a Cuban, I think.

2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:47.880
 In like the first gripping exchange,

2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:50.280
 he threw me with a drop sale out of nowhere.

2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:51.400
 I was pissed.

2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:55.040
 So I wanted my hands on the Brazilian and the team match.

2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:57.600
 Well, the Brazilian team is warming up.

2:00:57.600 --> 2:00:59.080
 So I walk up to him, no joke.

2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:01.520
 I walked up to him and I go, you're fighting.

2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:03.780
 And he goes, not today.

2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:06.140
 And I went, are you fucking kidding me?

2:01:06.140 --> 2:01:06.980
 I warmed up.

2:01:06.980 --> 2:01:09.440
 I taped up that you're the only fucking guy I want to fight

2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:10.680
 and you're going to fucking sit in the stands

2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:12.680
 and read a goddamn book.

2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:13.680
 I was so angry.

2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:17.120
 I carried that anger cause I never fought him until this day.

2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:18.240
 I was fucking pissed.

2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:19.780
 I was ready to beat him.

2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:23.500
 That's right, I forgot he was the world number one.

2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:27.680
 Cause I remember being really excited at that match.

2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:28.720
 How did you beat him?

2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:31.880
 I threw him with two hands on the same side, collar,

2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:32.720
 like drop sale.

2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:35.640
 I cross gripped, I yanked him behind me and I threw him.

2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:36.480
 Epon?

2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:37.300
 Wazari.

2:01:37.300 --> 2:01:40.560
 And then the match ended 30 seconds later.

2:01:41.620 --> 2:01:42.820
 I was pumped.

2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:43.660
 So fucking angry.

2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:46.320
 I thought, okay, if I'm remembering correctly,

2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:49.900
 I thought, okay, this guy might actually win gold.

2:01:51.900 --> 2:01:55.160
 That's what made, for me as a spectator,

2:01:55.160 --> 2:02:00.160
 remembering now the next match that much more like painful.

2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:04.580
 And then the fans of judo that really followed the sport,

2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:08.680
 the stats, when you look at the games and my draws,

2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:09.760
 I had the worst possible draw

2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:11.560
 as you ever could have imagined.

2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:15.120
 At both London and Rio, I fought the world number one

2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:19.100
 to get to the final or into the semis or past the semis.

2:02:19.100 --> 2:02:22.420
 And everybody I fought in the draw

2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:24.640
 either beat me the last time we fought

2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:27.000
 or I had never fought before.

2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.320
 So I always held a loss going onto the mat

2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:30.240
 at the Olympic games.

2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:31.600
 How'd you feel about that, by the way?

2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:32.920
 Like what were your feelings

2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.360
 about facing the Brazilian first?

2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:36.560
 I was so excited.

2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:38.860
 Well, that was match three.

2:02:38.860 --> 2:02:41.360
 In London, I fought the Slovenian guy first round

2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:42.380
 who beat me.

2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:45.060
 Where'd he beat me?

2:02:45.060 --> 2:02:46.280
 Was it the Worlds?

2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:47.640
 Might've been the Worlds.

2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:50.400
 And then, Church's Ville, I fought in the second round

2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:54.800
 who threw me for Wazari in Japan.

2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:58.160
 And then, Leandro, who I don't think I ever fought,

2:02:58.160 --> 2:02:59.400
 who was world number one.

2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:02.240
 That avoided fighting me at the team tournament.

2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:04.720
 But I mean, every single Olympics you've fought

2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:06.040
 and you really stepped up.

2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:09.040
 It's the only tournament I've ever prepped for.

2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:11.100
 Mentally and physically and just the whole thing?

2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:11.940
 Yeah.

2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:14.280
 We never trained through this tournament

2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:15.520
 like we did for the others.

2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:18.480
 Or I would go into it injured.

2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:19.400
 All right, well, let's talk about,

2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:24.120
 you're standing there next to the German.

2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:26.360
 He looked always smaller than you,

2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:28.260
 but you said like strong.

2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:29.100
 Yeah.

2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:33.720
 So what are you feeling now, Jimmy Pedro behind you?

2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:35.520
 I was fucking ready to take his head off.

2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:38.920
 Did you have an idea of what you're gonna do?

2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:41.800
 Did you try to, do you're thinking of winning by Ypon?

2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:44.040
 Were you thinking like going for big throws,

2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:47.280
 or take him in deep waters, outgrip him?

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:48.160
 What were you thinking?

2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:50.120
 We were about to have a battle

2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:54.040
 and I wasn't gonna throw him until he broke mentally.

2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.280
 Okay.

2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:59.180
 That was, there was no like,

2:03:59.180 --> 2:04:00.980
 oh, this is gonna be a clean throw.

2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:04.180
 That was never, that was never the thought process.

2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:10.720
 So here, you know there's going to be a lot of gripping.

2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:14.080
 So we're seeing a shit ton of gripping.

2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:18.480
 And right here, he throws it, bang, close fisted.

2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:21.740
 You got a lot of adrenaline.

2:04:21.740 --> 2:04:22.580
 You seem calm.

2:04:22.580 --> 2:04:23.420
 I'm pissed.

2:04:23.420 --> 2:04:24.260
 You're pissed.

2:04:24.260 --> 2:04:26.180
 Like, you don't look serious, you just look like.

2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:27.780
 I'm looking at the ref like,

2:04:27.780 --> 2:04:28.700
 cause he keeps telling me to get up.

2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:30.900
 I'm like, I have blood running down my face.

2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:33.180
 I go.

2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:34.680
 Okay.

2:04:34.680 --> 2:04:36.140
 Here, there's blood.

2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:37.980
 See, and he's like, oh yeah, go fix it.

2:04:37.980 --> 2:04:39.980
 And that's on your eyebrow somewhere?

2:04:39.980 --> 2:04:42.260
 Yeah, he split it just underneath it.

2:04:42.260 --> 2:04:43.380
 So you split your eyebrow.

2:04:43.380 --> 2:04:46.820
 And so in judo, they don't, they're allergic to blood,

2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:47.900
 probably for a good reason.

2:04:47.900 --> 2:04:51.180
 But they, so now you have to try to figure out

2:04:51.180 --> 2:04:53.420
 how to tape that up.

2:04:53.420 --> 2:04:54.300
 Yep.

2:04:54.300 --> 2:04:56.980
 Which already sets up one of the most bad ass

2:04:58.140 --> 2:04:59.780
 looks in judo history.

2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:04.140
 First 15 seconds, busted my eye open.

2:05:04.140 --> 2:05:06.380
 Was that getting in the way of your eyesight at all or no?

2:05:06.380 --> 2:05:07.220
 No.

2:05:07.220 --> 2:05:10.740
 Damn, he looks good at gripping.

2:05:10.740 --> 2:05:12.940
 How difficult is it to get a grip on that guy?

2:05:12.940 --> 2:05:13.780
 Very.

2:05:14.740 --> 2:05:16.660
 Like I'm struggling just to get my hand in the collar

2:05:16.660 --> 2:05:18.220
 and he wasn't even blocking it.

2:05:18.220 --> 2:05:19.820
 Is he being cagey?

2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:22.540
 Remember like, is he interested in offense?

2:05:22.540 --> 2:05:23.380
 Nope.

2:05:23.380 --> 2:05:27.300
 He's a very cagey, you know, methodical player.

2:05:27.300 --> 2:05:30.300
 Like he, he never opens himself up.

2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:31.900
 Yeah.

2:05:31.900 --> 2:05:32.740
 There you go.

2:05:32.740 --> 2:05:34.500
 You grabbed the leg as part of a combination.

2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:35.340
 Yep.

2:05:35.340 --> 2:05:38.740
 And people have told me that he's actually very good

2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:39.820
 at throwing people.

2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:41.220
 He just doesn't.

2:05:41.220 --> 2:05:43.380
 So, but he just doesn't show it at these.

2:05:43.380 --> 2:05:44.220
 Nope.

2:05:44.220 --> 2:05:46.660
 Cause he, he doesn't care how he wins.

2:05:46.660 --> 2:05:48.340
 He cares that he wins.

2:05:48.340 --> 2:05:49.180
 Yeah.

2:05:49.180 --> 2:05:51.060
 Which makes him very difficult to beat.

2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:55.340
 Cause he knows when you've strategized to do that,

2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:57.740
 where you look at the rule set and you develop a plan

2:05:57.740 --> 2:05:59.460
 to get through the matches,

2:05:59.460 --> 2:06:01.940
 then you've really got to figure out a way

2:06:01.940 --> 2:06:04.540
 to get that person off that game plan.

2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:07.500
 You know, whether you get ahead by a penalty or something.

2:06:08.740 --> 2:06:10.260
 Right there.

2:06:10.260 --> 2:06:13.820
 Like, he wouldn't give me the sleeve,

2:06:13.820 --> 2:06:15.860
 so I grabbed all of his fingers.

2:06:15.860 --> 2:06:17.180
 Oh, nice.

2:06:17.180 --> 2:06:21.220
 In which I open like, like this way or?

2:06:21.220 --> 2:06:23.940
 I grabbed them the other way and I started lifting them.

2:06:23.940 --> 2:06:24.780
 Ah, yeah.

2:06:24.780 --> 2:06:25.620
 Like I start, nice.

2:06:25.620 --> 2:06:26.460
 Oh, like perfect.

2:06:26.460 --> 2:06:27.300
 Reverse play and mercy.

2:06:27.300 --> 2:06:28.140
 Like this.

2:06:28.140 --> 2:06:28.980
 Yeah.

2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:30.540
 Oh, this is great.

2:06:30.540 --> 2:06:31.660
 Cause he wouldn't give me the sleeve

2:06:31.660 --> 2:06:33.820
 and I needed an attack.

2:06:33.820 --> 2:06:36.060
 And then I'm like, okay, I can't hold onto this forever

2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:37.180
 cause that judge is going to see it.

2:06:37.180 --> 2:06:38.700
 So let me just do a quick throw here

2:06:38.700 --> 2:06:40.500
 while I'm using the fingers in the mercy grip.

2:06:40.500 --> 2:06:41.580
 You're holding on.

2:06:41.580 --> 2:06:42.420
 Yeah.

2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:43.780
 And then I just sit out.

2:06:43.780 --> 2:06:44.620
 Yeah.

2:06:46.860 --> 2:06:49.740
 And then he goes to get up and I go to get on top

2:06:49.740 --> 2:06:50.740
 and right here.

2:06:51.580 --> 2:06:52.580
 Nice.

2:06:52.580 --> 2:06:53.420
 That elbow.

2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:54.260
 You get him?

2:06:54.260 --> 2:06:55.100
 Oh, you got him.

2:06:55.100 --> 2:06:57.340
 Yeah, it looks like I elbow him.

2:06:57.340 --> 2:06:58.500
 Did you do it kind of?

2:06:58.500 --> 2:07:00.020
 No, I didn't.

2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:02.660
 At the time, I never knew this happened

2:07:02.660 --> 2:07:06.220
 until after I watched this like three or four years later.

2:07:06.220 --> 2:07:08.660
 Didn't even know, I didn't even feel it.

2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:09.500
 Look at that.

2:07:09.500 --> 2:07:10.940
 So he's legitimately angry here.

2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:11.820
 Yeah, he's angry.

2:07:13.220 --> 2:07:15.660
 And of course you can't, you can't move.

2:07:15.660 --> 2:07:16.740
 Why would you move?

2:07:16.740 --> 2:07:17.580
 Look at this.

2:07:17.580 --> 2:07:19.100
 This moment right there is gold.

2:07:19.100 --> 2:07:21.380
 If you're not watching this on video, you're missing out.

2:07:21.380 --> 2:07:23.100
 You never get this in judo.

2:07:23.100 --> 2:07:25.420
 No, I don't know if that's ever happened.

2:07:25.420 --> 2:07:26.900
 That little face off.

2:07:26.900 --> 2:07:29.100
 Especially on a stage like this.

2:07:29.100 --> 2:07:30.260
 The reference.

2:07:30.260 --> 2:07:32.180
 And then he brings us in to like talk to us

2:07:32.180 --> 2:07:33.780
 and he's like, hey, we're good, right?

2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:34.860
 Like, you guys aren't about to do

2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:36.420
 what I think you're about to do.

2:07:38.060 --> 2:07:39.900
 And he's like, hey, shake hands again.

2:07:39.900 --> 2:07:41.860
 Cause the first time we did it, that wasn't good enough.

2:07:41.860 --> 2:07:43.260
 Well, you gotta do it again.

2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:47.380
 The heartbreaking part about this

2:07:47.380 --> 2:07:51.260
 and why the IJF switched it to an unlimited golden score.

2:07:51.260 --> 2:07:53.580
 Because we fought five minutes

2:07:54.860 --> 2:07:57.660
 through the entire normal part of the match.

2:07:57.660 --> 2:08:01.980
 And then we did the entire overtime period of three minutes.

2:08:01.980 --> 2:08:04.340
 Not one penalty was given.

2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:07.060
 No gripping infractions, no false attacks,

2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:08.140
 like no stallings.

2:08:08.140 --> 2:08:08.980
 That's great.

2:08:08.980 --> 2:08:10.340
 Nobody was really backing up.

2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:11.180
 Yep.

2:08:11.180 --> 2:08:12.020
 I mean, he was, you know.

2:08:12.020 --> 2:08:13.780
 So what was Jimmy telling you here?

2:08:14.780 --> 2:08:16.500
 Or was he talking to you at all?

2:08:16.500 --> 2:08:19.500
 He's not allowed to talk during medical things

2:08:19.500 --> 2:08:21.860
 and my nose is now broken.

2:08:21.860 --> 2:08:23.860
 But he's also, oh, the nose is broken.

2:08:23.860 --> 2:08:25.060
 From what?

2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:26.540
 I caught an elbow from him.

2:08:28.340 --> 2:08:29.420
 Glad his face is clean.

2:08:29.420 --> 2:08:30.900
 That's fun.

2:08:30.900 --> 2:08:32.700
 And right here, I was pissed.

2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:34.660
 I was so angry at the medic

2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:36.420
 because he's fumbling around and I'm like,

2:08:36.420 --> 2:08:40.180
 my whole plan is to break the German mentally.

2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:42.380
 You gotta hurry up with the tape, man.

2:08:42.380 --> 2:08:43.620
 He's supposed to be tired.

2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:45.220
 He's not supposed to be resting.

2:08:46.940 --> 2:08:48.220
 Is Jimmy yelling here?

2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:49.340
 He can't.

2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:52.380
 No, not here, not here, but during the match.

2:08:52.380 --> 2:08:53.780
 And you can see I just take it from him

2:08:53.780 --> 2:08:54.780
 and I'm like, give it to me.

2:08:54.780 --> 2:08:55.740
 I'm gonna do it myself.

2:08:55.740 --> 2:08:56.580
 Get out of here.

2:08:58.380 --> 2:09:00.740
 How scared is the medic?

2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:01.580
 He's like, this guy's gonna kill me.

2:09:01.580 --> 2:09:03.220
 He can't even tear the tape.

2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:04.500
 Look how nervous he is.

2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:10.900
 We made fun of him for this so much throughout the years.

2:09:10.900 --> 2:09:12.380
 Still do to this day.

2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:13.300
 All right, here we go.

2:09:13.300 --> 2:09:15.780
 Oh, you look great getting geared up.

2:09:15.780 --> 2:09:17.820
 Can't really see, don't care.

2:09:17.820 --> 2:09:19.780
 Was there some outcome in your mind

2:09:19.780 --> 2:09:21.300
 that you could possibly beat him on the ground

2:09:21.300 --> 2:09:22.620
 with a submission or a pin?

2:09:22.620 --> 2:09:24.260
 You knew you were gonna have to throw him.

2:09:24.260 --> 2:09:26.020
 I knew I was gonna have to.

2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:29.020
 If I was gonna throw him or armbar him

2:09:29.020 --> 2:09:31.860
 or pin him, whatever the case may be,

2:09:31.860 --> 2:09:36.860
 it was gonna be his mental like, I'm just tired of this.

2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:38.660
 He's too cagey of a player.

2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:40.340
 He's too experienced.

2:09:41.380 --> 2:09:44.780
 He has to mentally make that choice to give that inch.

2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:47.140
 And then you just have to be ready to take it.

2:09:47.140 --> 2:09:48.620
 So I was just waiting for it.

2:09:50.140 --> 2:09:53.300
 And so now this is four minutes in, one minute left.

2:09:53.300 --> 2:09:54.140
 Yeah.

2:09:54.140 --> 2:09:57.700
 Oh, is that in your game plan two potentials

2:09:57.700 --> 2:10:01.180
 like sumi gaeshi, like the sacrifice throws to him?

2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:03.420
 Cause the whole point of that technique

2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:04.940
 and the sacrifice throws wasn't

2:10:04.940 --> 2:10:07.180
 because I thought I was gonna throw him,

2:10:07.180 --> 2:10:10.060
 but it disrupts the pattern enough

2:10:10.060 --> 2:10:14.100
 to like get him to make a potential mistake.

2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:16.700
 Like see, he should have gotten Ashido there.

2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:18.300
 Hands in the face.

2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:20.220
 But again, that's just part of judo.

2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:21.300
 Yeah.

2:10:21.300 --> 2:10:22.620
 He poked me in the elbow.

2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:25.340
 This is a rough match.

2:10:25.340 --> 2:10:27.700
 Does he act at all or no?

2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:30.060
 Like, was he acting frustrated or anything like that?

2:10:30.060 --> 2:10:33.380
 It was all like, he's like acting for the ref.

2:10:33.380 --> 2:10:34.220
 You know what I mean?

2:10:34.220 --> 2:10:35.860
 Like, oh, that, all that kind of stuff.

2:10:35.860 --> 2:10:39.340
 You're just going in hard, nonstop,

2:10:39.340 --> 2:10:43.620
 like angry, aggressive, feeling cardio here at all.

2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:44.460
 Like.

2:10:44.460 --> 2:10:46.940
 I don't, I didn't get tired during this.

2:10:46.940 --> 2:10:48.700
 And then just always pressing for.

2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:50.220
 Time runs out.

2:10:50.220 --> 2:10:51.820
 Now we're into golden score.

2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:54.580
 12 minutes and 38 seconds later.

2:10:54.580 --> 2:10:56.820
 Yeah, you think about every judo exchange, right?

2:10:56.820 --> 2:10:59.300
 Every time we grip up, every time we attack,

2:10:59.300 --> 2:11:01.380
 sometimes it can take longer to get back to the line

2:11:01.380 --> 2:11:02.660
 than the entire exchange.

2:11:02.660 --> 2:11:03.700
 Yeah.

2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:06.100
 So the more aggression, the more exchanges you have,

2:11:06.100 --> 2:11:09.580
 the longer the time stretches.

2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:13.420
 Then here, the six seconds left in golden score,

2:11:13.420 --> 2:11:18.420
 your tape is now yellow and red

2:11:20.260 --> 2:11:23.220
 with sweat and blood, literally, and time is out.

2:11:23.220 --> 2:11:24.340
 Now, what are you thinking here?

2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:25.900
 Do you think you won the match?

2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:29.460
 I thought I won the match a minute ago.

2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:32.380
 I remember thinking to myself,

2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:36.460
 like if this goes to the flags, I won.

2:11:36.460 --> 2:11:37.540
 No doubt in my mind.

2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:42.500
 Because I felt like the whole time,

2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:45.260
 like I was going to him, right?

2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:46.980
 He was never coming at me.

2:11:47.940 --> 2:11:49.900
 Yeah, that's the way it felt.

2:11:49.900 --> 2:11:52.940
 And like, that's the way it felt body language wise,

2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:55.820
 just the intensity, how fast you're moving towards him.

2:11:55.820 --> 2:11:57.540
 You're constantly going for throws.

2:12:00.820 --> 2:12:02.300
 Now, if you want to rewind that,

2:12:02.300 --> 2:12:03.660
 we can talk about the whole,

2:12:03.660 --> 2:12:05.020
 because it's a part of this clip.

2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:08.420
 So wait a minute, they all went blue.

2:12:08.420 --> 2:12:09.260
 They all did.

2:12:09.260 --> 2:12:12.140
 So in judo, there's three referees,

2:12:12.140 --> 2:12:13.780
 two on the side, one in the center,

2:12:13.780 --> 2:12:14.620
 and they all vote on who won.

2:12:14.620 --> 2:12:16.180
 And now let's pause it right there.

2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:18.260
 Now, the way this is supposed to work,

2:12:18.260 --> 2:12:21.900
 they raise their flags, they do like a one, two count,

2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:24.900
 and then on three, they all raise it together.

2:12:24.900 --> 2:12:28.260
 Now, as a little pretext to this entire match,

2:12:28.260 --> 2:12:32.420
 up until this point, not one match at the Olympic Games

2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:34.820
 has ever been a split decision.

2:12:34.820 --> 2:12:36.620
 Meaning out of three people,

2:12:37.460 --> 2:12:40.380
 not one of them voted against the other group members.

2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:44.580
 So they were all unified blue or all unified white.

2:12:44.580 --> 2:12:45.420
 Yeah.

2:12:45.420 --> 2:12:46.260
 Right?

2:12:46.260 --> 2:12:49.260
 Which is statistically difficult to imagine.

2:12:49.260 --> 2:12:50.660
 Yes.

2:12:50.660 --> 2:12:53.940
 It's almost like they had a referee meeting and said,

2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:55.740
 it's better for the Olympics.

2:12:55.740 --> 2:12:56.980
 To never have a split.

2:12:56.980 --> 2:12:58.260
 Yeah.

2:12:58.260 --> 2:12:59.100
 Okay.

2:13:00.020 --> 2:13:02.820
 So the question becomes,

2:13:02.820 --> 2:13:07.060
 if you would click that frame by frame, right?

2:13:08.100 --> 2:13:11.740
 So right now we have all the refs with their flags out

2:13:11.740 --> 2:13:12.940
 and then click that.

2:13:12.940 --> 2:13:15.340
 So the middle guy starts.

2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:17.020
 He is all the way up.

2:13:17.020 --> 2:13:17.860
 All the way up.

2:13:17.860 --> 2:13:20.260
 The other side judges haven't moved.

2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:23.620
 We now have one side ref all the way up.

2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:26.620
 Then we have a third side ref all the way up.

2:13:28.540 --> 2:13:29.380
 Yeah.

2:13:29.380 --> 2:13:31.540
 So there's a time point

2:13:31.540 --> 2:13:33.700
 when the middle guy has the flag all the way up.

2:13:33.700 --> 2:13:35.860
 If not 80, 90% of the way there.

2:13:35.860 --> 2:13:36.700
 Yeah.

2:13:36.700 --> 2:13:37.860
 Then the other one does.

2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:39.460
 And then the third one goes.

2:13:40.460 --> 2:13:44.740
 So now the question becomes who really,

2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:47.260
 like did the outside refs really have an opinion?

2:13:47.260 --> 2:13:52.260
 Or were they told to wait for the center one to start

2:13:54.460 --> 2:13:59.420
 and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked?

2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:00.260
 Yeah.

2:14:00.260 --> 2:14:01.980
 This is very unfortunate.

2:14:01.980 --> 2:14:03.700
 It's very, honestly, it's very possible

2:14:03.700 --> 2:14:05.020
 that they had this meeting.

2:14:05.020 --> 2:14:09.980
 This is the problem with the Olympics.

2:14:09.980 --> 2:14:13.500
 They sometimes, it's also the problem in the Soviet Union

2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.340
 with communism.

2:14:14.340 --> 2:14:17.900
 They think the committee knows what's good for the people

2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:18.740
 and so on.

2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:20.740
 So they decide universally

2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:24.020
 as opposed to letting the magic of the Olympics

2:14:24.020 --> 2:14:25.380
 be what it is.

2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:28.540
 But nevertheless, in this case,

2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:31.220
 the center ref decided blue.

2:14:31.220 --> 2:14:33.060
 Like what do you think?

2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:34.820
 Do you think it's just a shitty call?

2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:36.580
 Or like?

2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:38.420
 He has the right to pick.

2:14:38.420 --> 2:14:43.420
 But the problem is the other two I don't think did.

2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:48.100
 And so when you do this frame by frame again,

2:14:48.100 --> 2:14:53.100
 I can see from my own perspective two of the refs.

2:14:54.300 --> 2:14:55.900
 And I see them both blue.

2:14:55.900 --> 2:14:59.380
 So when you fast forward that a little bit

2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:03.060
 to get to all the flags, I see the two go blue.

2:15:03.060 --> 2:15:06.180
 And I go, I look over and I look at the other guy

2:15:06.180 --> 2:15:08.060
 and I'm like, really?

2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:10.700
 All three?

2:15:10.700 --> 2:15:13.580
 I fought for eight minutes and I can't even get a vote.

2:15:13.580 --> 2:15:15.820
 I didn't even get a penalty.

2:15:15.820 --> 2:15:17.740
 I can't even get a vote.

2:15:17.740 --> 2:15:18.980
 And that's when I broke.

2:15:21.460 --> 2:15:24.540
 I like, oh, I couldn't believe it.

2:15:25.980 --> 2:15:28.660
 And I'm not gonna lie, he looked shocked.

2:15:32.660 --> 2:15:34.780
 And here you're on your knees.

2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:35.620
 You're crying.

2:15:35.620 --> 2:15:36.700
 Literally crying.

2:15:36.700 --> 2:15:37.540
 This is it.

2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:38.380
 Yeah.

2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:39.220
 But I think it's the end.

2:15:39.220 --> 2:15:40.060
 That was such an amazing match.

2:15:40.060 --> 2:15:41.140
 It was such a war.

2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:45.500
 I mean, both people can't believe what happened.

2:15:45.500 --> 2:15:46.340
 I know.

2:15:46.340 --> 2:15:48.220
 That's the, and like, honestly,

2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:50.700
 I wish we had the rules that we do today,

2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:53.020
 as far as the unlimited golden score,

2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:56.420
 because I would have loved to have seen

2:15:56.420 --> 2:15:57.580
 what would have happened.

2:15:57.580 --> 2:15:59.460
 What was Jimmy saying here to you?

2:15:59.460 --> 2:16:01.460
 I mean, I guess there's nothing to say.

2:16:03.260 --> 2:16:04.100
 Yeah.

2:16:04.100 --> 2:16:06.980
 He was kind of apologizing for the way

2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:11.260
 the scores went.

2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:13.220
 Cause he knows how badly you want it.

2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:14.660
 He saw the match.

2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:16.940
 And he felt I deserved to win it.

2:16:16.940 --> 2:16:19.260
 Based on like, you know, what happened.

2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:21.060
 But he probably with all his experience

2:16:21.060 --> 2:16:24.340
 knows that this is what the Olympics are about.

2:16:24.340 --> 2:16:26.060
 The refs sometimes.

2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:27.820
 I mean, that's the magic of it, man.

2:16:27.820 --> 2:16:30.300
 Well, and at the same time we're at,

2:16:31.380 --> 2:16:34.100
 we're in the Olympic semi final

2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:37.820
 in a sport that's dominated by certain continents.

2:16:37.820 --> 2:16:40.460
 And when you look at the three refs on the mat,

2:16:40.460 --> 2:16:41.540
 they're all European.

2:16:42.860 --> 2:16:43.700
 Yeah.

2:16:43.700 --> 2:16:45.340
 You're telling me there couldn't have been one Pan Am,

2:16:45.340 --> 2:16:49.020
 one African, one Oceana, you know, different.

2:16:49.860 --> 2:16:51.380
 Like, why'd they all have to be European?

2:16:51.380 --> 2:16:55.620
 But to be fair, it's back to your sauna story.

2:16:55.620 --> 2:16:56.460
 Correct.

2:16:56.460 --> 2:16:57.700
 You've dealt with this stuff before.

2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:00.420
 And you've won over this stuff before.

2:17:00.420 --> 2:17:02.300
 And that's why, like, I was broken for life.

2:17:02.300 --> 2:17:04.340
 And you thought you won here, that was.

2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:09.300
 And when I hindered on that for a year and a half,

2:17:09.300 --> 2:17:11.300
 like I couldn't even stand, I was done.

2:17:13.460 --> 2:17:15.580
 But I'm pretty sure there's a slow motion replay

2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:16.420
 on this when I watched it.

2:17:16.420 --> 2:17:18.380
 Hey, he's all excited, that fucking guy.

2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:20.580
 And he's all happy.

2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:21.420
 It's a relief.

2:17:21.420 --> 2:17:23.580
 Hey, hey, hi guys.

2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:24.420
 I did it.

2:17:26.020 --> 2:17:26.860
 Yeah, so here's like.

2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:27.700
 Look at those teeth.

2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:29.140
 My teeth are red.

2:17:29.140 --> 2:17:32.740
 Slow motion replay of the flag being raised,

2:17:32.740 --> 2:17:35.060
 the heart being broken, Travis just bending over.

2:17:35.060 --> 2:17:35.900
 Right here, watch.

2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:36.820
 Watch his reaction.

2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.380
 Like, he, like, you could see his mouth, like,

2:17:39.380 --> 2:17:42.300
 open in awe, like, really?

2:17:42.300 --> 2:17:44.580
 And he's looking at two refs just like I am.

2:17:44.580 --> 2:17:46.940
 He didn't celebrate until he looked at the third one

2:17:46.940 --> 2:17:48.220
 and said, oh, all three.

2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:50.580
 So you think he knew he lost?

2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:52.340
 I think in his head, like,

2:17:53.220 --> 2:17:55.460
 I don't think he really believed he was winning.

2:17:55.460 --> 2:17:57.180
 He did enough to win, yeah.

2:17:57.180 --> 2:17:58.540
 Yeah.

2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:00.340
 Because when his mouth dropped, like,

2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:03.860
 oh yeah, hey, all three.

2:18:03.860 --> 2:18:07.340
 Like, that's not really the reaction you would give.

2:18:07.340 --> 2:18:09.140
 Yeah, I mean, that was,

2:18:10.380 --> 2:18:12.700
 that's one of the greatest matches I've ever seen.

2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:14.300
 I mean, obviously it's painful for you,

2:18:14.300 --> 2:18:19.300
 but that pain, first of all, sets the stage for 2016.

2:18:19.980 --> 2:18:21.740
 But even without that,

2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:25.380
 I think it was just a beautiful story at the Olympics.

2:18:25.380 --> 2:18:28.500
 You've still did incredible job at that Olympics.

2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:30.220
 You stood toe to toe.

2:18:30.220 --> 2:18:35.220
 I think in hindsight, having lost that match

2:18:36.020 --> 2:18:38.580
 did more for me and more for the sport.

2:18:39.460 --> 2:18:40.380
 Yeah, absolutely.

2:18:40.380 --> 2:18:42.540
 As a whole, me losing that match.

2:18:42.540 --> 2:18:43.500
 Yeah.

2:18:43.500 --> 2:18:46.020
 I mean, stories aren't about winning.

2:18:46.020 --> 2:18:47.940
 Stories are about the fighting.

2:18:47.940 --> 2:18:50.100
 So, and that made one hell of a story.

2:18:50.100 --> 2:18:55.100
 But it also has to do with, you know,

2:18:55.100 --> 2:18:59.140
 you know, treachery is probably not the right word to use.

2:18:59.140 --> 2:19:02.460
 It's probably the wrong word entirely to use.

2:19:02.460 --> 2:19:06.540
 But because of the conflict in the match

2:19:06.540 --> 2:19:09.860
 and because of how the refs handled the match there

2:19:09.860 --> 2:19:12.980
 at the end, it created controversy

2:19:12.980 --> 2:19:17.980
 that was spoken about for months on world media, right?

2:19:18.140 --> 2:19:21.220
 I remember articles being written about the Olympics

2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:24.100
 and, you know, the refing and how it was corrupt

2:19:24.100 --> 2:19:26.940
 and that match was one of them.

2:19:26.940 --> 2:19:28.500
 There was another one in fencing

2:19:28.500 --> 2:19:30.940
 where like something happened with the timer

2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:35.180
 where one of the fencers, I guess what happens in fencing,

2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:39.780
 the timer resets up a second if it's down.

2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:42.580
 So the fencer got one second played out,

2:19:42.580 --> 2:19:47.340
 I think like 27 or 28 times and then one on like 30.

2:19:48.260 --> 2:19:51.420
 So like there was like clock fixing for fencing.

2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:54.500
 There was this match that I think just got publicity,

2:19:54.500 --> 2:19:55.620
 good or bad.

2:19:55.620 --> 2:19:57.400
 Publicity is publicity for judo.

2:19:58.500 --> 2:20:01.420
 And then you came back to, I mean,

2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:03.380
 this is the hard thing after this heartbreak

2:20:03.380 --> 2:20:06.060
 to step up and continue fighting, right?

2:20:06.060 --> 2:20:09.100
 I really, really struggled.

2:20:09.100 --> 2:20:14.100
 Like unbelievably struggled from 2012 to like 2014.

2:20:14.380 --> 2:20:16.100
 I almost quit numerous times.

2:20:16.100 --> 2:20:17.940
 I was so angry.

2:20:17.940 --> 2:20:21.860
 I mean, at one point I got so mad at the IGF

2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:24.800
 feeling like they were fucking me every step of the way.

2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:28.640
 I threw a water bottle at a referee after a match.

2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:30.620
 I cussed out a referee one time on a mat.

2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:32.280
 I got suspended from the sport

2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:36.040
 because I was just so angry at that point in time.

2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:39.080
 And IGF is the International Judo Federation

2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:41.620
 and are they the people that supply the referees

2:20:41.620 --> 2:20:42.460
 basically like the certification?

2:20:42.460 --> 2:20:45.380
 They kind of run the sport on a global scale.

2:20:45.380 --> 2:20:50.380
 So you sent a few emails 2014, 15, basically quitting.

2:20:54.420 --> 2:20:57.220
 One of them said I'm mentally and physically broken.

2:20:57.220 --> 2:21:00.960
 Another said, well, the subject line, I'm done.

2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:02.720
 The weight cuts didn't break you.

2:21:02.720 --> 2:21:03.560
 No.

2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:06.800
 So if this broke you,

2:21:06.800 --> 2:21:09.540
 you were really going through a hard time.

2:21:09.540 --> 2:21:10.980
 I was like, you know what?

2:21:10.980 --> 2:21:13.100
 We're just gonna like dumb it down a little bit

2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:14.500
 and get some wins under our belt.

2:21:14.500 --> 2:21:16.300
 I'm gonna go to a world cup,

2:21:16.300 --> 2:21:20.080
 which is like three stages down or four stages down

2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:22.860
 from like the Olympic games.

2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:24.540
 Like this should be like a cake walk.

2:21:24.540 --> 2:21:26.100
 Like making the final of a world cup

2:21:26.100 --> 2:21:27.760
 should be a walk in the park.

2:21:28.700 --> 2:21:30.260
 I show up.

2:21:30.260 --> 2:21:35.260
 I barely beat a 16 year old kid, barely.

2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:37.820
 Then I got smoked in the second round.

2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:39.300
 I got thrown three times.

2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:42.420
 I was like, I'm fucking done.

2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:44.340
 They changed all the fucking rules.

2:21:44.340 --> 2:21:46.060
 They fucked me out of the Olympics.

2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:48.480
 Like, what am I supposed to do?

2:21:49.540 --> 2:21:52.500
 And it was at that moment when I wrote the email

2:21:52.500 --> 2:21:55.520
 where I remember sitting at a bar,

2:21:55.520 --> 2:21:56.360
 I don't drink by the way,

2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:00.560
 but I was sitting at a bar at the hotel sending this email

2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:04.300
 and I got a response back from Jimmy and he goes,

2:22:04.300 --> 2:22:07.540
 well, just stay for the training camp,

2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:09.880
 go to Germany and then whatever happens,

2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:10.720
 don't worry about it.

2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:12.380
 We'll talk when you get home.

2:22:12.380 --> 2:22:16.060
 I was like, fuck that, fuck these people, fuck the rules.

2:22:16.060 --> 2:22:17.260
 I don't fucking care anymore.

2:22:17.260 --> 2:22:19.540
 I'm just gonna do judo the way I wanna do judo.

2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:22.900
 If I fucking get shit out, fuck them.

2:22:22.900 --> 2:22:24.860
 That was my response.

2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:26.860
 Can you become an Olympic champion?

2:22:26.860 --> 2:22:28.460
 Can you become an Olympic medalist?

2:22:28.460 --> 2:22:30.060
 With that kind of thinking, you think or no?

2:22:30.060 --> 2:22:32.220
 Was that, that's counterproductive?

2:22:32.220 --> 2:22:33.060
 Yeah.

2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:37.700
 Okay, just checking because maybe that's also liberating.

2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:39.440
 The expectation was no longer

2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:41.220
 that Travis is gonna win this tournament.

2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:43.780
 The expectation was Travis is gonna come home

2:22:43.780 --> 2:22:44.740
 and be fucking pissed off

2:22:44.740 --> 2:22:45.660
 and we're gonna have to figure out

2:22:45.660 --> 2:22:49.200
 how to manage a pissed off person that's trying to quit

2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:50.860
 that shouldn't be quitting.

2:22:50.860 --> 2:22:52.620
 And did people still believe

2:22:52.620 --> 2:22:54.340
 that you can be a medalist again?

2:22:54.340 --> 2:22:55.180
 Yeah.

2:22:55.180 --> 2:22:56.020
 Like who believed that?

2:22:56.020 --> 2:22:58.780
 Jimmy believed it, the team managers believed it,

2:22:58.780 --> 2:23:00.840
 some of my teammates still believed it,

2:23:01.700 --> 2:23:03.620
 my training partners still did,

2:23:03.620 --> 2:23:06.860
 but they're not the ones that are cutting the weight,

2:23:06.860 --> 2:23:11.620
 flying around, feeling like all of your Judo

2:23:11.620 --> 2:23:12.940
 is now null and void, right?

2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:17.020
 Because at this point, they took away leg grabs entirely.

2:23:17.020 --> 2:23:20.100
 You couldn't break a grip with two hands, right?

2:23:20.100 --> 2:23:23.660
 The meta of Judo has changed again, right?

2:23:23.660 --> 2:23:26.060
 So I got fucked out of it.

2:23:26.060 --> 2:23:28.200
 They took away how I did Judo again

2:23:28.200 --> 2:23:30.780
 and now it's just got more difficult.

2:23:30.780 --> 2:23:34.760
 So when I'm sitting in the hotel and I'm sending this email,

2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:37.060
 I remember being at the training camp,

2:23:37.060 --> 2:23:40.300
 I was like, I don't even fucking care what the rules are,

2:23:40.300 --> 2:23:41.860
 I'm just gonna fucking throw people,

2:23:41.860 --> 2:23:43.380
 I don't even care if I'm cheating,

2:23:43.380 --> 2:23:46.600
 doesn't matter to me, I'll just play stupid, right?

2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:48.660
 So I just started going back and doing Judo

2:23:48.660 --> 2:23:50.080
 without the leg grabs,

2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:54.420
 but with all the same gripping that I was doing beforehand.

2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:56.340
 And then when I got to Germany,

2:23:56.340 --> 2:23:58.620
 I was like, I don't fucking care.

2:23:58.620 --> 2:24:00.820
 I was like, if I gotta cheat to win,

2:24:00.820 --> 2:24:03.060
 then I gotta fucking cheat to win.

2:24:03.060 --> 2:24:06.220
 If I get sheeted out, then I get sheeted out

2:24:06.220 --> 2:24:07.280
 and I won Germany.

2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:10.980
 Which event in Germany?

2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:14.140
 The German Grand Prix, which was a week

2:24:14.140 --> 2:24:16.140
 after losing the World Cup.

2:24:16.140 --> 2:24:20.340
 Because I was trying to do Judo around the new rule set.

2:24:20.340 --> 2:24:23.240
 I wasn't just trying to do Judo, right?

2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:25.820
 Because when you get to the highest level,

2:24:25.820 --> 2:24:28.620
 your game tends to morph around

2:24:28.620 --> 2:24:33.020
 what can you can or cannot get away with.

2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:35.200
 I was more focused on trying to figure out

2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:37.020
 what I can and can't get away with

2:24:37.020 --> 2:24:39.160
 and I stopped actively doing Judo.

2:24:40.060 --> 2:24:42.580
 Once I said, fuck whatever the rule changes are,

2:24:42.580 --> 2:24:43.780
 I'm just gonna keep doing Judo

2:24:43.780 --> 2:24:45.340
 the way I know how to do Judo

2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:47.180
 and if I get a penalty, then so be it.

2:24:48.260 --> 2:24:51.780
 And so that win, that started the road back.

2:24:51.780 --> 2:24:52.920
 The road back, yeah.

2:24:54.380 --> 2:24:57.900
 Cause now it's like, I don't care if you penalize me or not

2:24:57.900 --> 2:25:00.820
 because I'm gonna throw that guy anyways.

2:25:00.820 --> 2:25:02.460
 I'm gonna beat him anyways.

2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:05.340
 And if I get a Shido for doing something wrong,

2:25:05.340 --> 2:25:07.620
 then I'll just stop doing that one thing

2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:09.080
 and just keep doing all the other things

2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:10.740
 that they told me I probably shouldn't be doing

2:25:10.740 --> 2:25:11.820
 but they're not calling me on it

2:25:11.820 --> 2:25:13.420
 so I'm just gonna keep doing it.

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.160
 Well, you found yourself at the 2016 Olympics.

2:25:21.620 --> 2:25:23.140
 Was that ever a doubt, by the way,

2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:27.020
 after this, after 2014 in Germany?

2:25:27.020 --> 2:25:30.480
 I had a lot of doubt after the concussion in 2015.

2:25:31.820 --> 2:25:34.780
 I remember when I first came back

2:25:34.780 --> 2:25:37.820
 after four months of nothingness

2:25:37.820 --> 2:25:41.500
 that even trying to train,

2:25:41.500 --> 2:25:44.660
 the room would start to tilt the world on me.

2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:46.300
 And then when I finally got over that

2:25:46.300 --> 2:25:47.660
 and I could start doing things again,

2:25:47.660 --> 2:25:50.340
 I stepped on the mat for the Pan Ams

2:25:50.340 --> 2:25:54.180
 and I was like, drowning's not the right word

2:25:54.180 --> 2:25:57.500
 but everything was being done in such a slow motion.

2:25:57.500 --> 2:26:01.200
 I had sandbags everywhere that I just couldn't keep up.

2:26:02.820 --> 2:26:04.400
 Like mental fog.

2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:06.940
 Yeah, I remember fighting the Brazilian

2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:10.540
 in the semifinal of Pan Ams.

2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:12.020
 I was halfway through this match

2:26:12.020 --> 2:26:14.460
 and I'm just like, eyes roll up,

2:26:14.460 --> 2:26:16.340
 I'm like, I'm just gonna fucking wing it.

2:26:16.340 --> 2:26:17.180
 And I just fucking winged it

2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:18.900
 and I got countered and thrown free pwn

2:26:18.900 --> 2:26:21.900
 and I was like, I don't even know what to do.

2:26:21.900 --> 2:26:24.380
 And I couldn't even think clearly.

2:26:24.380 --> 2:26:27.460
 And that's when I was like, I may not come back.

2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:28.300
 Yeah.

2:26:28.300 --> 2:26:30.340
 You don't have control over how to come back from this.

2:26:30.340 --> 2:26:31.580
 It's like, it's just your mind

2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:33.740
 and it's not operating correctly.

2:26:33.740 --> 2:26:35.020
 It's not like I can like,

2:26:35.020 --> 2:26:37.740
 oh, my right hand's not working because it's fractured.

2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:39.340
 Let me figure out a way I can not use that.

2:26:39.340 --> 2:26:40.700
 Like when your mind's not working,

2:26:40.700 --> 2:26:44.300
 like it's the one thing you need.

2:26:44.300 --> 2:26:45.740
 Like you gotta have it.

2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:47.460
 So I can work through anything else.

2:26:47.460 --> 2:26:49.140
 I needed that though.

2:26:49.140 --> 2:26:51.420
 And so how did you come back from that time?

2:26:51.420 --> 2:26:53.460
 That's when I wrote another email and I was like,

2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:55.020
 I'm fucking off team USA.

2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:57.460
 I'm not fucking, I'm all done with USA judo.

2:26:57.460 --> 2:26:58.580
 I'm done with the tour.

2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:00.100
 I was like, I quit.

2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:01.900
 Well, I'm gonna go do my own thing.

2:27:01.900 --> 2:27:03.540
 They were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2:27:03.540 --> 2:27:04.740
 Can't quit now.

2:27:04.740 --> 2:27:05.980
 Olympics is in like a year.

2:27:05.980 --> 2:27:07.300
 Like let's talk about this again

2:27:07.300 --> 2:27:08.900
 cause it's the second time I've tried to quit

2:27:08.900 --> 2:27:10.260
 in like two years.

2:27:10.260 --> 2:27:11.100
 Right?

2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:14.940
 So then we sit down in Jimmy's office and he's like,

2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:16.740
 whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't quit.

2:27:16.740 --> 2:27:19.300
 You're gonna kick yourself if you don't go to Rio.

2:27:19.300 --> 2:27:22.180
 I'm telling you right now, don't do that to yourself.

2:27:22.180 --> 2:27:23.860
 Let's figure out a way of like doing this.

2:27:23.860 --> 2:27:27.060
 And I was like, because when we trained before,

2:27:27.060 --> 2:27:29.140
 we did it as a unit, right?

2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:30.540
 We all went to the same tournaments.

2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:31.980
 We all went to the same training camps.

2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:33.860
 And I'm like, you guys are treating me

2:27:33.860 --> 2:27:36.100
 like I'm the same player I used to be.

2:27:36.100 --> 2:27:38.420
 I go, I don't, I'm not operating

2:27:38.420 --> 2:27:40.100
 at the level you think I'm operating at.

2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:41.500
 I go, I can't do that.

2:27:41.500 --> 2:27:43.860
 And he goes, well, what do you wanna do?

2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:45.380
 And I go, I'll tell you what Jimmy,

2:27:45.380 --> 2:27:47.820
 you know I'm being serious because my answer

2:27:47.820 --> 2:27:49.700
 is something you'd never would have expected.

2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:52.620
 I go, why don't you just send me to Japan for three weeks?

2:27:52.620 --> 2:27:54.620
 And he was like, really?

2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:55.980
 I hated Japan.

2:27:55.980 --> 2:27:58.500
 I refused to go there up until this point.

2:27:59.340 --> 2:28:01.580
 But I was like, I have to get to a point

2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:05.780
 where I can get so tired and get through it

2:28:05.780 --> 2:28:07.980
 that like my Judo will come back

2:28:07.980 --> 2:28:09.460
 and my body will learn again.

2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:12.540
 And when you say Japan, you mean the Kodokan,

2:28:12.540 --> 2:28:16.900
 like what's Tokai, is that the highest level of Judo?

2:28:16.900 --> 2:28:18.860
 It's one of the top colleges in the world, yeah.

2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:21.340
 And that's so you can go with the best people in the world.

2:28:21.340 --> 2:28:22.700
 You can go to war with them.

2:28:22.700 --> 2:28:24.620
 Top level, like strong players.

2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:27.220
 Yeah, there's a lot of very strong players.

2:28:27.220 --> 2:28:29.540
 There's a lot of middle class players

2:28:29.540 --> 2:28:32.100
 and there's a lot of volume of rounds.

2:28:32.100 --> 2:28:35.100
 So you value all of it, the middle class too, like the.

2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:37.620
 Because when you're tired, like you can't just train

2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:41.700
 in areas where you're battling for every inch.

2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:46.020
 At some point you have to be successful, right?

2:28:46.020 --> 2:28:48.980
 So you still under duress and under strain

2:28:48.980 --> 2:28:51.100
 and through exhaustion,

2:28:51.100 --> 2:28:53.740
 you still have to have the ability to score.

2:28:53.740 --> 2:28:55.180
 Well, if you're training with the best people

2:28:55.180 --> 2:28:56.060
 in the world all the time,

2:28:56.060 --> 2:28:58.180
 you're not always gonna be able to score.

2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:00.300
 So you still need those B level players

2:29:00.300 --> 2:29:02.900
 in order to really develop again.

2:29:03.820 --> 2:29:06.100
 What is it like, if you can comment briefly

2:29:06.100 --> 2:29:08.740
 on the training in Japan,

2:29:08.740 --> 2:29:11.700
 what's it like to go into a different place?

2:29:11.700 --> 2:29:14.060
 You probably don't speak the language that well.

2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:17.020
 Like, is there an isolation aspect to it?

2:29:17.020 --> 2:29:19.940
 Is it like purely about judo now?

2:29:19.940 --> 2:29:22.020
 I really want it to be isolated.

2:29:22.020 --> 2:29:24.700
 No training partners, no coaches.

2:29:24.700 --> 2:29:26.980
 I want it to get back to my roots

2:29:26.980 --> 2:29:28.740
 and just learn how to fight again.

2:29:30.220 --> 2:29:32.460
 I don't wanna figure out how to beat the German.

2:29:32.460 --> 2:29:37.340
 I don't wanna figure out how I can develop a new entry

2:29:37.340 --> 2:29:41.300
 into my sale against, you know, whoever it may be.

2:29:41.300 --> 2:29:42.140
 It's not.

2:29:42.140 --> 2:29:42.980
 You just wanna fight hard.

2:29:42.980 --> 2:29:44.100
 You just wanna fight.

2:29:44.100 --> 2:29:45.260
 Let me get back to fighting.

2:29:45.260 --> 2:29:48.580
 Let me get back to like the root of who I am.

2:29:48.580 --> 2:29:49.900
 What were those sessions like?

2:29:49.900 --> 2:29:51.020
 What were we talking about?

2:29:51.020 --> 2:29:51.940
 Five minute rounds?

2:29:51.940 --> 2:29:53.260
 Like what, how many?

2:29:53.260 --> 2:29:55.580
 Six minute rounds, 30 minute breaks,

2:29:55.580 --> 2:29:57.000
 14 rounds a session.

2:29:58.860 --> 2:30:00.260
 Sorry, what's the 30 minute break?

2:30:00.260 --> 2:30:01.540
 30 second break.

2:30:01.540 --> 2:30:02.380
 30 second break.

2:30:02.380 --> 2:30:03.220
 30 second break.

2:30:04.780 --> 2:30:05.620
 Sorry, what?

2:30:05.620 --> 2:30:06.460
 14?

2:30:06.460 --> 2:30:07.300
 14 rounds.

2:30:07.300 --> 2:30:08.180
 14 rounds.

2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:09.580
 Every day?

2:30:09.580 --> 2:30:10.580
 Every day.

2:30:10.580 --> 2:30:13.460
 Like five days a week

2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:17.300
 and then 11 or 12 rounds on Saturday.

2:30:17.300 --> 2:30:19.740
 Plus weightlifting, plus running.

2:30:19.740 --> 2:30:21.540
 Plus weightlifting, plus running.

2:30:21.540 --> 2:30:23.580
 So those are hard rounds.

2:30:23.580 --> 2:30:25.340
 What's it feel like to go through that?

2:30:25.340 --> 2:30:30.180
 So you have a bunch of just a sea of black belts, Japan.

2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:33.720
 I'm sure they're hunting you a little bit.

2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:35.320
 Depending on who you are.

2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:36.520
 I was hunted a little bit.

2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:39.700
 Like I didn't really struggle because of who I am.

2:30:39.700 --> 2:30:41.740
 Them as college athletes,

2:30:41.740 --> 2:30:44.180
 they wanna show to their coaches

2:30:44.180 --> 2:30:46.300
 and their higher players,

2:30:46.300 --> 2:30:50.080
 like, oh look, I can throw the world number whoever.

2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:52.180
 But if you're just a guy who shows up,

2:30:52.180 --> 2:30:55.980
 like them beating you doesn't provide any value

2:30:55.980 --> 2:30:57.180
 or raise their status.

2:30:57.180 --> 2:30:59.740
 No, but you're status raising.

2:30:59.740 --> 2:31:00.940
 Yes.

2:31:00.940 --> 2:31:04.340
 So I was actually like in a situation

2:31:04.340 --> 2:31:06.540
 where nobody was watching me

2:31:06.540 --> 2:31:09.180
 and I was free to just battle at my own will.

2:31:09.180 --> 2:31:10.200
 Okay.

2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:12.500
 Which is what it was about for me.

2:31:12.500 --> 2:31:14.300
 And you just push yourself.

2:31:14.300 --> 2:31:15.600
 Because I knew how to do that.

2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:17.900
 I know how to push myself.

2:31:17.900 --> 2:31:19.900
 Are you, when you're doing these 14 rounds,

2:31:19.900 --> 2:31:23.500
 is every single one a standalone thing for you?

2:31:23.500 --> 2:31:24.340
 Yep.

2:31:24.340 --> 2:31:25.700
 So you're not trying to pace yourself?

2:31:25.700 --> 2:31:26.740
 No.

2:31:26.740 --> 2:31:29.580
 Each one is to as much exhaustion as I can get.

2:31:29.580 --> 2:31:33.160
 But then there must be ones where like it's like round nine

2:31:33.160 --> 2:31:35.020
 where you got nothing left.

2:31:35.020 --> 2:31:36.700
 Better figure out how to score.

2:31:36.700 --> 2:31:38.200
 That's all you gotta do.

2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:40.100
 You gotta survive and you gotta score.

2:31:41.540 --> 2:31:44.300
 What's your memories of that, of those three weeks?

2:31:44.300 --> 2:31:46.700
 What's like, what stands out to you?

2:31:46.700 --> 2:31:47.540
 It seems like,

2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:51.060
 cause that's the place where you found the silver medal.

2:31:51.060 --> 2:31:51.900
 Yep.

2:31:53.460 --> 2:31:56.060
 Because it's the place most people don't want to be.

2:31:57.480 --> 2:31:59.300
 Everybody's comfortable.

2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:01.260
 I would rather,

2:32:01.260 --> 2:32:03.860
 I would rather find out who I am and what I'm made of

2:32:03.860 --> 2:32:06.280
 and find those, those end points.

2:32:06.280 --> 2:32:08.340
 And if I can't find them,

2:32:08.340 --> 2:32:11.660
 then that means everybody else has given up before me.

2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:16.980
 Were there a few people that just kinda,

2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:19.940
 you returned to battle over and over in those times

2:32:19.940 --> 2:32:21.580
 and then it was just.

2:32:21.580 --> 2:32:22.420
 Yep.

2:32:24.100 --> 2:32:25.800
 No social media.

2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:26.640
 Nope.

2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:28.580
 None of that, it's just like two men.

2:32:28.580 --> 2:32:30.140
 You lock yourself in your room,

2:32:30.140 --> 2:32:32.540
 you come back, you've thought about it

2:32:32.540 --> 2:32:35.400
 and you come back with a game plan for that day.

2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:37.540
 Against some players here or there

2:32:37.540 --> 2:32:40.780
 and I would, I would develop a hit list.

2:32:40.780 --> 2:32:41.740
 Like I would be like,

2:32:41.740 --> 2:32:44.540
 oh, that motherfucker grabbed me at like 13

2:32:44.540 --> 2:32:46.400
 and I watched him sit fucking four rounds

2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:48.220
 and then come try to kick the shit out of me.

2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:49.520
 I'm gonna fucking grab that guy early

2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:51.580
 and I'm gonna beat the shit out of him.

2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:53.180
 And you just develop that list.

2:32:53.180 --> 2:32:55.540
 There's probably some epic battles in that room, right?

2:32:55.540 --> 2:32:56.380
 Yeah.

2:32:57.780 --> 2:32:58.660
 What's it look like?

2:32:58.660 --> 2:33:00.020
 Like how crowded is it?

2:33:00.020 --> 2:33:01.020
 Very.

2:33:01.020 --> 2:33:02.980
 And so you're just like, yeah.

2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:04.040
 Just sea of people.

2:33:04.040 --> 2:33:05.100
 Sea of people.

2:33:05.100 --> 2:33:05.940
 And you're trying to,

2:33:05.940 --> 2:33:06.900
 are you doing groundwork at all?

2:33:06.900 --> 2:33:07.740
 Just throws.

2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:08.580
 Just throws.

2:33:08.580 --> 2:33:09.400
 Just throws.

2:33:09.400 --> 2:33:10.240
 No transitions, no nothing.

2:33:10.240 --> 2:33:12.180
 But if I get pissed off and like you keep dropping

2:33:12.180 --> 2:33:14.140
 or like not letting me do what I wanna do,

2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:16.020
 I'll rip a choke right across your face.

2:33:16.020 --> 2:33:18.100
 Just to let you know that like,

2:33:18.100 --> 2:33:18.940
 and if I wanted to.

2:33:18.940 --> 2:33:21.940
 You have a really nice style of just like

2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:26.740
 respectfully bullying the shit out of people.

2:33:26.740 --> 2:33:28.240
 Cause some people call me a bully

2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:30.260
 and I have to remind them that like

2:33:31.100 --> 2:33:34.660
 a bully enjoys like beating up the weak.

2:33:34.660 --> 2:33:35.500
 Right.

2:33:35.500 --> 2:33:38.020
 I wanna beat the person that fights back.

2:33:38.020 --> 2:33:38.860
 Right, exactly.

2:33:38.860 --> 2:33:40.940
 It's not fun for me if you don't fight back.

2:33:40.940 --> 2:33:41.780
 Right.

2:33:41.780 --> 2:33:44.600
 Some of the greatest people I've seen like do this,

2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:45.820
 they basically,

2:33:46.620 --> 2:33:48.600
 you have this in the Iowa wrestling rooms,

2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:49.900
 they'll push each other into the wall.

2:33:49.900 --> 2:33:51.680
 Like they get, there's like anger,

2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:53.580
 but it's ultimately underneath it all.

2:33:53.580 --> 2:33:55.180
 It's like a deep respect.

2:33:55.180 --> 2:33:57.380
 I was training with Colton Brown one time

2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:58.880
 and I went to San Jose State

2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:01.420
 cause I was in California for something.

2:34:01.420 --> 2:34:02.540
 And he kept like,

2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:04.540
 he kept circling to the edge.

2:34:04.540 --> 2:34:06.540
 They had like a cupboard that had like,

2:34:06.540 --> 2:34:07.440
 when you opened it,

2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:09.460
 it had like all the tape and like medical supplies.

2:34:09.460 --> 2:34:11.860
 I was like, we'll fucking put you right through that.

2:34:11.860 --> 2:34:13.620
 And he kind of giggled.

2:34:13.620 --> 2:34:14.540
 And then he went by that edge

2:34:14.540 --> 2:34:15.780
 and I fucking ran him right through it.

2:34:15.780 --> 2:34:16.620
 Yeah.

2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:19.020
 See, to me, that's an ultimate sign of respect

2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:21.780
 that both you and Colton will remember well.

2:34:21.780 --> 2:34:22.780
 And we're still friends.

2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:23.620
 We still talk.

2:34:23.620 --> 2:34:24.780
 It's just, I told him I was gonna do it.

2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:25.900
 He knew I meant it too.

2:34:25.900 --> 2:34:26.740
 Yeah.

2:34:26.740 --> 2:34:27.800
 He did it anyways.

2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:28.880
 That just tested me.

2:34:31.820 --> 2:34:32.980
 Yeah.

2:34:32.980 --> 2:34:33.980
 Listen, that's,

2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:35.900
 and that same attitude was,

2:34:35.900 --> 2:34:39.580
 that was in Japan just day after day after day after day.

2:34:39.580 --> 2:34:40.660
 14 rounds.

2:34:40.660 --> 2:34:42.060
 That's rough.

2:34:42.060 --> 2:34:44.260
 And you didn't sit out rounds?

2:34:44.260 --> 2:34:46.160
 And I did it all with a broken hand.

2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:48.780
 How?

2:34:50.540 --> 2:34:52.420
 How did you do it with a broken hand?

2:34:52.420 --> 2:34:53.700
 You show up every day.

2:34:53.700 --> 2:34:54.540
 You show up.

2:34:54.540 --> 2:34:55.380
 Okay.

2:34:55.380 --> 2:34:56.280
 Which one, left or right?

2:34:56.280 --> 2:34:57.580
 My right.

2:34:57.580 --> 2:34:58.420
 Okay.

2:34:58.420 --> 2:34:59.240
 So that's okay.

2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:01.500
 So you can then focus on gripping with your left.

2:35:01.500 --> 2:35:02.740
 It's always a way.

2:35:02.740 --> 2:35:04.020
 It's always a way.

2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:04.900
 But that means you can't,

2:35:04.900 --> 2:35:07.020
 I guess you don't have to grip with your right sometimes.

2:35:07.020 --> 2:35:10.260
 I would palm it with my thumb just like hanging out

2:35:10.260 --> 2:35:11.460
 like this, just like this.

2:35:11.460 --> 2:35:12.660
 So you can do something.

2:35:12.660 --> 2:35:14.020
 So you can do like a Goshi,

2:35:14.020 --> 2:35:14.860
 cause you have a,

2:35:16.020 --> 2:35:16.860
 cause I,

2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:17.740
 what were your main throws?

2:35:17.740 --> 2:35:19.020
 It was Seinagi.

2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:20.460
 Koshiguruma.

2:35:20.460 --> 2:35:21.300
 Okay.

2:35:21.300 --> 2:35:22.140
 Sumi.

2:35:22.140 --> 2:35:22.960
 Uchimata.

2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:23.800
 Uchimata.

2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:27.760
 But you have this big like a Goshi type of thing.

2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:28.600
 Like a.

2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:30.660
 Yeah, but not from like around the waist.

2:35:30.660 --> 2:35:32.140
 It's from over the shoulder.

2:35:32.140 --> 2:35:32.980
 Over the shoulder.

2:35:32.980 --> 2:35:35.420
 And I can do it with just the one hand.

2:35:35.420 --> 2:35:36.920
 Oh, sorry, which one hand?

2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:38.140
 The right one.

2:35:38.140 --> 2:35:39.660
 I don't need the sleeve hand.

2:35:39.660 --> 2:35:40.600
 You don't need the sleeve hand,

2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:42.820
 but you couldn't do it with the broken hand.

2:35:42.820 --> 2:35:44.340
 I could.

2:35:44.340 --> 2:35:45.820
 Cause I can just put my hand in the gi

2:35:45.820 --> 2:35:47.100
 so it can't come off.

2:35:48.020 --> 2:35:49.100
 And then you just,

2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:52.460
 cause what happened was three days

2:35:52.460 --> 2:35:53.980
 before I was leaving for Japan,

2:35:53.980 --> 2:35:57.060
 a guy, my hand was rested like this on a mat

2:35:57.060 --> 2:35:59.740
 and the guy, boom, took my whole thumb off

2:35:59.740 --> 2:36:02.400
 and tore all the tendons in the palm.

2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:05.100
 So when I went to the doctor, he was like,

2:36:05.100 --> 2:36:06.900
 you know, do we have to put a cast on it?

2:36:06.900 --> 2:36:08.380
 And I go, I'm leaving in three days.

2:36:08.380 --> 2:36:10.220
 You're not putting a cast on it.

2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:11.820
 And I go, this is what I want you to do.

2:36:11.820 --> 2:36:12.820
 Just like this, I said,

2:36:12.820 --> 2:36:16.220
 I want you to build a cast that holds it,

2:36:16.220 --> 2:36:19.820
 that Velcros around so that when I'm not training,

2:36:19.820 --> 2:36:21.180
 I can wear it.

2:36:21.180 --> 2:36:22.780
 But then when I'm training,

2:36:22.780 --> 2:36:25.140
 I'll take it off and then I'll put the tape on it.

2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:26.940
 And then whatever happens, happens.

2:36:26.940 --> 2:36:31.360
 Whatever happens, happens.

2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:33.160
 All right, so that's Epic.

2:36:33.160 --> 2:36:37.260
 And that led you to the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:39.720
 Well, that led me to winning Pan Am Gold

2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:41.280
 when I got back from Japan

2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:44.320
 and then almost getting my leg cut off in 2015.

2:36:45.740 --> 2:36:49.400
 That was like, I don't know, maybe a month or two later.

2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:51.680
 I was hospitalized for seven days.

2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:53.560
 The leg being cut off for what?

2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:56.120
 I had three different types of bacterial infections

2:36:56.120 --> 2:36:59.200
 in my right leg, a whole leg swelled.

2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:04.160
 And it was in my blood, skin and in my bone,

2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:05.020
 in my right leg.

2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:11.920
 So I got stuck at MGH in a hospital for seven days

2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:15.920
 until they figured out what the bacteria source was.

2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:17.720
 Where was the source of the infection?

2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:19.000
 Is it in the knee?

2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:19.840
 In the knee?

2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:20.680
 Yeah.

2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:23.400
 Okay, so obviously there's a danger of like,

2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:24.600
 that's life threatening.

2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:26.920
 Yep, so when I went into the emergency room,

2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:28.640
 when I got back from the Worlds,

2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:30.880
 the lady was like, hey, you need to call,

2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:34.120
 you're gonna call because you may lose your leg tonight.

2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:36.000
 And then they put me in the hospital.

2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.200
 What do you think of this whole time?

2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:40.400
 Are you still thinking about Olympics?

2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:43.520
 They put me into the room like four hours later,

2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:44.700
 the doctor came in.

2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:50.840
 I was at MGH in Boston and he was like,

2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:53.040
 you have a serious infection in your leg.

2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:56.080
 I go, he's like, we have to keep you hospitalized

2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:57.320
 until we can figure out what it is.

2:37:57.320 --> 2:37:59.520
 And I was like, buddy,

2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:01.320
 I have the Olympic games in less than a year.

2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:03.560
 I go, I don't give a fuck what it is.

2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:05.640
 I go, just fucking take it out

2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:06.800
 and let me get on with my day.

2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:08.960
 He goes, we can't do that.

2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:10.580
 Like, I don't understand.

2:38:10.580 --> 2:38:12.240
 I go, you told me it's infected,

2:38:12.240 --> 2:38:14.580
 just cut away that part of the tissue,

2:38:14.580 --> 2:38:16.000
 drain it, do whatever you gotta do

2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:17.360
 and then send me on my way.

2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:18.960
 He's like, it doesn't work like that.

2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:20.640
 He said, until we figure out what it is,

2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:22.840
 we can't figure out how to stop it from growing

2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:24.360
 or how far it spread.

2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:27.640
 So it took them seven days to figure out what it was.

2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:29.480
 Then once they figured out what it was,

2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:31.520
 I went in for surgery to remove it.

2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:35.600
 Then I spent, I think it was eight weeks

2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:38.460
 in home care with a PICC line.

2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:41.600
 And then I came back from that.

2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:43.360
 On the first week and a half of judo,

2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.820
 I tore my SI joint trying to throw a guy.

2:38:46.820 --> 2:38:49.920
 And then I came back from that about a month later

2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:52.420
 and then fifth at the Connell Cup.

2:38:52.420 --> 2:38:54.280
 And then the games six months later.

2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:57.880
 How quickly do doctors understand who they're dealing with?

2:38:57.880 --> 2:38:59.920
 Like, is that difficult for you to explain

2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:02.760
 who Travis Stevens is when you go to visit a doctor?

2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:07.120
 I don't think they understand, you know,

2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:10.600
 their role is to get me to do my job

2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:13.840
 to the best of their ability as a doctor.

2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:16.240
 Meaning, it's gonna be less than what they want.

2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:21.240
 And they struggle conceptually with like,

2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:26.280
 but the textbook tells me this.

2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:28.760
 And I go, but I'm not a textbook, right?

2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:30.460
 Like when you go to physical therapy,

2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:32.600
 the first thing they do is they pull out that binder

2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:35.500
 that says day one, we do this exercise.

2:39:35.500 --> 2:39:38.720
 I go, but I have my own goals.

2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:41.320
 Your job is to help me meet my goal.

2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:43.160
 Let's work a plan to do that

2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:44.960
 or I gotta go find somebody else.

2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:47.120
 Did the doctors in general,

2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:50.120
 people outside of your close knit group step up?

2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:52.860
 If they didn't, I found somebody else.

2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:55.740
 And typically I could find a person

2:39:55.740 --> 2:39:57.360
 who knew the right person.

2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:00.240
 I always wonder with people like,

2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:02.800
 cause I'm constantly surrounded by,

2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:04.800
 one of the biggest problems in my life has been,

2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:07.960
 there's a lot of people in my life who love me very much,

2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:11.300
 but who want me to the equivalent of that situation.

2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:14.600
 You know, definitely don't go to the Olympics

2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:16.120
 and definitely like,

2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:18.080
 it seems like the world is full of people

2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:22.240
 that want you to be average and happy, which is great,

2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:23.080
 which is fine.

2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:25.640
 I mean, perhaps that's the way it should be.

2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:27.680
 Like, you know, my parents, people close to you,

2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:31.800
 that's what love, how love manifests itself often in people.

2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:35.220
 But then like, I think the ultimate manifestation of love

2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:37.220
 is understanding who this person is.

2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:40.400
 Here's a madman who's driven towards a particular thing.

2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:43.640
 And the best thing for you to do is not to say,

2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:48.520
 like rest is to say, work harder.

2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:52.720
 Like fuck your infection.

2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:54.080
 You should be training.

2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:57.320
 Have you ever met anybody as crazy as you

2:40:57.320 --> 2:40:58.460
 that can help you?

2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:02.080
 Most of us who get to this point get there

2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:05.920
 because we're all a little unstable.

2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:07.440
 Even my wife, Galita, right?

2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:11.020
 Like when she was getting ready for 2016,

2:41:11.020 --> 2:41:13.900
 or when she was getting ready for 2020,

2:41:13.900 --> 2:41:16.980
 because she moved to Boston to be a coach,

2:41:16.980 --> 2:41:21.980
 she had a neck problem, right?

2:41:22.780 --> 2:41:26.940
 And at some point in time, it's like,

2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:29.040
 what's really important?

2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:31.820
 Day to day life or judo?

2:41:31.820 --> 2:41:35.760
 And believe it or not, the doctor in Canada was like,

2:41:36.820 --> 2:41:39.480
 I am never under any circumstances

2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:41.100
 doing an MRI of your neck again.

2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:44.100
 That's what she told her.

2:41:44.100 --> 2:41:46.140
 She goes, if you have me do an MRI,

2:41:46.140 --> 2:41:47.400
 you're not doing judo again.

2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:52.000
 So just know if you hurt your neck and it requires an MRI,

2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:53.980
 you're done with judo forever.

2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:56.320
 So decide if you wanna do judo or not.

2:41:56.320 --> 2:41:58.980
 That was a conversation we actually had to have.

2:41:58.980 --> 2:42:01.780
 That's a cool thing for a doctor to say.

2:42:01.780 --> 2:42:05.260
 I mean, it depends how bad ass they sound when they say it.

2:42:05.260 --> 2:42:06.460
 So that's a tough conversation.

2:42:06.460 --> 2:42:09.860
 Judo one, what's this with your wife?

2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:11.100
 What's that relationship like?

2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:13.180
 So you're both a little crazy.

2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:14.020
 A little bit.

2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:18.000
 In a good sense, or from my perspective, in a good sense.

2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:23.000
 Yeah, it's just, we understand that when you set a goal

2:42:24.620 --> 2:42:28.780
 to do something, you're not signing on for the good.

2:42:28.780 --> 2:42:29.620
 Yeah.

2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:31.380
 You're signing on for the bad.

2:42:31.380 --> 2:42:34.080
 And I don't think a lot of people understand that.

2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:37.040
 That's like a Valentine's Day card from Travis Stevens.

2:42:38.140 --> 2:42:40.740
 You have to accept everything negative

2:42:40.740 --> 2:42:42.420
 that could possibly happen.

2:42:42.420 --> 2:42:44.500
 And until you do, you're never gonna make it.

2:42:44.500 --> 2:42:46.420
 Because you'll always sell yourself short.

2:42:46.420 --> 2:42:47.260
 Yeah.

2:42:47.260 --> 2:42:48.300
 You'll never go far enough.

2:42:49.460 --> 2:42:50.700
 And if you sign up for the whole thing,

2:42:50.700 --> 2:42:53.220
 then the negative is just like, oh, great.

2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:54.500
 I expected that.

2:42:54.500 --> 2:42:56.220
 If you're experiencing the negative,

2:42:56.220 --> 2:42:58.180
 they're also experiencing the negative.

2:42:58.180 --> 2:42:59.100
 And if you overcome it,

2:42:59.100 --> 2:43:00.980
 maybe they'll get knocked out for it.

2:43:00.980 --> 2:43:01.820
 Yep.

2:43:01.820 --> 2:43:02.720
 Maybe they won't deal with it.

2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:05.140
 Maybe they won't train through it.

2:43:05.140 --> 2:43:06.900
 Right, when I had my five herniated disc

2:43:06.900 --> 2:43:07.900
 and I was in a neck brace,

2:43:07.900 --> 2:43:09.900
 I was still in the gym at seven a.m.

2:43:09.900 --> 2:43:10.740
 Yeah.

2:43:10.740 --> 2:43:12.260
 Doing whatever it is I could do

2:43:12.260 --> 2:43:15.020
 because my job is to be at the gym.

2:43:15.020 --> 2:43:17.180
 David Goggins, I don't know if you know the guy,

2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:20.300
 he's gone, he's damaged lots of parts of his body,

2:43:20.300 --> 2:43:23.100
 like you, trying to achieve things.

2:43:23.100 --> 2:43:28.020
 So, unlike you, his achievements are like,

2:43:28.020 --> 2:43:30.660
 your achievements come with the medal.

2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:33.700
 He's just running in the darkness in the middle of nowhere

2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:34.540
 by himself.

2:43:34.540 --> 2:43:36.940
 It's like, I mean, it's the same probably as with you

2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:39.300
 if you're able to be introspective about it,

2:43:39.300 --> 2:43:41.900
 is he's just battling his own inner demons

2:43:41.900 --> 2:43:44.060
 and working through those

2:43:44.060 --> 2:43:47.660
 and is breaking his body doing so.

2:43:47.660 --> 2:43:51.260
 Are you cognizant of the trade off of the fact

2:43:51.260 --> 2:43:54.860
 that you're damaging your body

2:43:55.920 --> 2:43:57.860
 to get to these levels of achievements,

2:43:57.860 --> 2:44:00.740
 of this level of excellence, of this level of greatness?

2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:02.540
 I mean, I guess that depends

2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:04.340
 on what you consider damage really

2:44:04.340 --> 2:44:08.140
 because I don't really see that I have damaged my body.

2:44:08.140 --> 2:44:10.540
 If anything, I think I've strengthened it.

2:44:10.540 --> 2:44:12.300
 My body can go through more than yours can.

2:44:12.300 --> 2:44:13.140
 Yeah.

2:44:13.140 --> 2:44:13.960
 Who's is weaker?

2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:14.800
 Yeah.

2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:17.260
 Right?

2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:19.560
 It's just like the Thai boxers, right?

2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:20.400
 Yeah.

2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:21.280
 In order to strengthen their shins,

2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:22.700
 they gotta break it a few times.

2:44:22.700 --> 2:44:23.540
 Yeah.

2:44:23.540 --> 2:44:24.600
 It's just nature of the beast.

2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:26.820
 You just had to break a bunch of stuff

2:44:26.820 --> 2:44:28.260
 to find where the weak points are

2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:29.580
 and then made them stronger.

2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:30.420
 Yep.

2:44:30.420 --> 2:44:31.860
 Or strengthen the areas around it

2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:36.140
 to strengthen it by the sheer relation to it.

2:44:36.140 --> 2:44:38.940
 But the problem is you may not be able to do judo

2:44:41.860 --> 2:44:43.520
 for until you're 70.

2:44:44.380 --> 2:44:45.700
 Why not?

2:44:45.700 --> 2:44:47.980
 I may not be able to do judo to the level I used to.

2:44:47.980 --> 2:44:48.820
 Yeah.

2:44:48.820 --> 2:44:50.380
 Don't get me wrong, but I can still do judo.

2:44:50.380 --> 2:44:51.220
 You can still do judo.

2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:53.980
 And I think a lot of people struggle with,

2:44:53.980 --> 2:44:55.380
 they wanna keep doing it

2:44:55.380 --> 2:44:57.260
 like they used to be able to do it.

2:44:57.260 --> 2:44:59.000
 I don't try to do judo like I used to,

2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:00.460
 like you're seeing here.

2:45:00.460 --> 2:45:02.660
 I'm not that guy anymore.

2:45:02.660 --> 2:45:03.660
 I accept that.

2:45:03.660 --> 2:45:05.740
 I don't even try to be that guy anymore.

2:45:06.900 --> 2:45:09.820
 I'm a completely different player today than I am

2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:11.520
 when I was winning Olympic medals.

2:45:15.300 --> 2:45:18.940
 And so I guess when you're looking at my journey

2:45:18.940 --> 2:45:22.900
 and the trade off is I never sacrificed anything.

2:45:22.900 --> 2:45:26.580
 The people around me sacrificed for me.

2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:30.900
 And I never had a downturn after the Olympics

2:45:30.900 --> 2:45:33.440
 because I never identified as an Olympian.

2:45:35.780 --> 2:45:38.280
 You know, a lot of Olympians suffer from depression

2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:39.120
 afterwards.

2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:40.300
 Because they identify as it.

2:45:40.300 --> 2:45:42.460
 Now they don't have who they are.

2:45:42.460 --> 2:45:46.920
 Where was your personal moment of greatness?

2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:49.760
 Like, or do you not experience life that way?

2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:52.100
 Where you were truly proud to be yourself?

2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:52.940
 Like.

2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:53.780
 Every day I wake up.

2:45:56.220 --> 2:45:57.820
 You wake up and you're not proud of who you are,

2:45:57.820 --> 2:46:01.420
 then you've really gotta seek out some help.

2:46:01.420 --> 2:46:03.900
 So that's, first of all, okay, I'll do that

2:46:03.900 --> 2:46:07.300
 because I definitely am not proud of who I am.

2:46:07.300 --> 2:46:11.220
 I just wonder if you didn't identify with the Olympics,

2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:14.020
 was there times, maybe in the training room,

2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:19.020
 maybe in Japan, where you just kinda felt like,

2:46:19.020 --> 2:46:24.020
 I get more of an emotional, I guess, trigger, right?

2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:27.420
 Where like, I feel proud of what I've done

2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:32.380
 when I've set to a task and I've done it.

2:46:33.340 --> 2:46:35.080
 So almost any task.

2:46:35.080 --> 2:46:38.580
 And the more challenging the task, the more reward.

2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:44.860
 You fought a lot of amazing battles in 2016 Olympics.

2:46:44.860 --> 2:46:47.940
 So you got, you beat the, let's see,

2:46:47.940 --> 2:46:51.660
 the world number four in the quarterfinals.

2:46:51.660 --> 2:46:52.620
 It's like a replay.

2:46:52.620 --> 2:46:54.020
 Every single Olympics, you're,

2:46:54.940 --> 2:46:55.780
 all the people.

2:46:55.780 --> 2:46:57.260
 I got terrible draws.

2:46:57.260 --> 2:46:58.260
 Terrible draws.

2:46:58.260 --> 2:46:59.300
 And then you're facing,

2:46:59.300 --> 2:47:00.620
 this is where I was like watching this,

2:47:00.620 --> 2:47:02.060
 I'm like, yeah, he's screwed.

2:47:02.060 --> 2:47:05.340
 You faced the world number one, the Georgian, in the.

2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:07.300
 By the way, for people who don't know,

2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:11.580
 he beat me five times to my beating him once,

2:47:11.580 --> 2:47:13.880
 and the one time I beat him was in London.

2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:16.600
 And all other times he beat me, he beat me biathlon.

2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:19.760
 And not by like a little throw,

2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:21.980
 like he threw me on my head.

2:47:22.860 --> 2:47:25.420
 At one point we were in Georgia.

2:47:25.420 --> 2:47:27.040
 I'm fighting him in the final.

2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:29.220
 I go to my teammate and I go, guess what?

2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:30.520
 Make sure you watch this fight.

2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:32.320
 Somebody's getting thrown free pwn.

2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:34.720
 This match ain't, this ain't match going to distance.

2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:36.360
 And about a minute in,

2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.920
 I tried to take his head off with a big Koshiguruma,

2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:40.520
 which is like a head and arm.

2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:42.880
 He caught me and then threw me on my head

2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:44.060
 and ended the match.

2:47:44.060 --> 2:47:48.340
 So first of all, we're watching the video of you,

2:47:48.340 --> 2:47:50.580
 again, standing next to the guy

2:47:50.580 --> 2:47:52.640
 leading up to your semifinal match.

2:47:52.640 --> 2:47:56.580
 So here, if you win this, you're guaranteed a medal.

2:47:56.580 --> 2:47:59.420
 But the chances of you winning, from my fan perspective,

2:47:59.420 --> 2:48:00.580
 I was like, God damn it.

2:48:01.660 --> 2:48:03.660
 You and the rest of the world, except for me.

2:48:03.660 --> 2:48:04.500
 Except for you.

2:48:04.500 --> 2:48:05.340
 What are you saying?

2:48:05.340 --> 2:48:07.060
 You're talking to yourself here.

2:48:07.060 --> 2:48:08.080
 What are you saying?

2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:09.700
 My name is Travis Stevens.

2:48:09.700 --> 2:48:10.940
 I'm an Olympic champion.

2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:14.540
 I will not be denied.

2:48:14.540 --> 2:48:15.540
 The George is probably like,

2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:17.780
 what the hell is this guy saying?

2:48:17.780 --> 2:48:19.220
 What is he talking to himself?

2:48:20.500 --> 2:48:22.340
 So he was probably ultra confident.

2:48:22.340 --> 2:48:24.340
 Yeah, had to be.

2:48:24.340 --> 2:48:26.060
 The difference is,

2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:29.220
 is I understood the last five times he beat me.

2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:32.380
 I was purposely trying to throw him, not beat him.

2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:35.060
 I wanted to find out if I could.

2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:36.840
 Turns out I can't.

2:48:38.140 --> 2:48:40.660
 But I don't need to throw him to beat him.

2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:42.500
 I need to know how to not lose.

2:48:44.780 --> 2:48:47.860
 But you were still going for stuff here.

2:48:47.860 --> 2:48:51.300
 But all of my attacks drag him to the ground.

2:48:51.300 --> 2:48:53.060
 They're never standing on my feet.

2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:56.980
 Which is a complete, which is a distinction

2:48:56.980 --> 2:48:59.000
 that we talked about at the very beginning, right?

2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:00.220
 You have throws where you're standing

2:49:00.220 --> 2:49:01.660
 and throws where you're dropping.

2:49:01.660 --> 2:49:04.220
 Every time I try to throw him standing,

2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:05.340
 he throws me free pony.

2:49:05.340 --> 2:49:08.460
 He picks me up and he throws me on my head, literally.

2:49:08.460 --> 2:49:10.860
 So what I did is I just needed to get to that last

2:49:10.860 --> 2:49:13.840
 one minute mark, which is what he does mentally

2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:16.820
 in his own Judo, where he changes into a panic

2:49:16.820 --> 2:49:20.500
 and just tries to do things that are uncharacteristic.

2:49:21.620 --> 2:49:23.580
 So you knew he's gonna start panicking here

2:49:23.580 --> 2:49:26.180
 as the match draws to a close

2:49:26.180 --> 2:49:29.620
 and you both have a Shido, a penalty.

2:49:29.620 --> 2:49:31.620
 Did we pass the point where I went for broke

2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:32.660
 and I broke my rule?

2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:34.860
 Which one?

2:49:34.860 --> 2:49:39.860
 I went for a crazy foot sweep, like Ippon switch thing.

2:49:42.460 --> 2:49:43.780
 I can't even remember what it's called

2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:45.460
 because it's not used that often.

2:49:45.460 --> 2:49:47.620
 And he actually landed on top of me

2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:50.420
 and some people wanted it to be called Ippon.

2:49:50.420 --> 2:49:53.180
 But he had actually let go of the gi

2:49:53.180 --> 2:49:54.360
 and was looking for the mat.

2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:55.620
 So he didn't have any control.

2:49:55.620 --> 2:49:57.260
 So they didn't award him a point.

2:49:59.100 --> 2:49:59.920
 Yeah, and here we go.

2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:00.940
 Now we're getting down into the,

2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:02.420
 see like he's getting frustrated.

2:50:02.420 --> 2:50:03.260
 Great.

2:50:03.260 --> 2:50:05.780
 I love it. Perfect.

2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:07.300
 Second penalty, no big deal.

2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:09.380
 We just got to get to the one minute mark.

2:50:09.380 --> 2:50:10.580
 That's all we got to do.

2:50:13.700 --> 2:50:15.460
 So there's no panic here for you.

2:50:15.460 --> 2:50:18.000
 Nope, I'm right where I need to be and look it.

2:50:19.380 --> 2:50:21.600
 Now, if you go back into this match,

2:50:23.340 --> 2:50:25.380
 I would love for somebody to go back

2:50:25.380 --> 2:50:29.860
 and see how many times he did a drop right Ippon Seinagi.

2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:32.300
 Probably never.

2:50:32.300 --> 2:50:33.140
 Yeah.

2:50:33.140 --> 2:50:34.300
 Why is he doing it now?

2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:38.220
 Cause he panics and he changes his Judo

2:50:38.220 --> 2:50:39.500
 at that one minute mark.

2:50:40.900 --> 2:50:43.180
 Look how much I kept that grip.

2:50:43.180 --> 2:50:46.740
 Yeah, you kept, you have that grip this whole time.

2:50:46.740 --> 2:50:48.060
 You have your left hand.

2:50:48.060 --> 2:50:48.980
 Walking him down.

2:50:48.980 --> 2:50:50.040
 Walking him down.

2:50:51.380 --> 2:50:54.780
 He, you keep the grip as he's throwing.

2:50:54.780 --> 2:50:55.620
 Yeah.

2:50:55.620 --> 2:50:58.800
 Which, were you thinking choke as he drops or no?

2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:00.460
 It's just kind of natural instinct.

2:51:00.460 --> 2:51:02.140
 Yeah, because we drilled it.

2:51:02.140 --> 2:51:04.300
 I spent two years drilling this transition.

2:51:04.300 --> 2:51:08.500
 And then very, so for people that don't do Judo, Jujitsu,

2:51:08.500 --> 2:51:09.980
 it's like really nice.

2:51:09.980 --> 2:51:12.580
 You keep, everything is nicely controlled

2:51:12.580 --> 2:51:15.060
 to where you're keeping that Gi under his chin.

2:51:15.060 --> 2:51:16.460
 Like it's really tight control.

2:51:16.460 --> 2:51:19.240
 Like it's very, like you're, I guess it's drilling,

2:51:19.240 --> 2:51:21.300
 but you're cognizant of the position of your wrist

2:51:21.300 --> 2:51:22.140
 the whole time.

2:51:22.140 --> 2:51:25.740
 And you can tell based on like just years of doing it,

2:51:25.740 --> 2:51:27.860
 whether it's under or it's not.

2:51:27.860 --> 2:51:29.740
 You can just feel the difference.

2:51:29.740 --> 2:51:32.220
 And it's probably, even if you wanted to stop that,

2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:34.820
 it's very difficult because your whole time, it's like.

2:51:34.820 --> 2:51:37.280
 Once it's under, it's almost impossible to stop.

2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:41.220
 For people who practice Jujitsu, don't practice Judo,

2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:44.620
 one of the very annoying things about Judo

2:51:44.620 --> 2:51:47.420
 is in order to do Gi chokes,

2:51:47.420 --> 2:51:48.820
 they have to be under the chin.

2:51:48.820 --> 2:51:50.220
 Yes.

2:51:50.220 --> 2:51:52.460
 Even though the kind of intense chokes you do

2:51:52.460 --> 2:51:54.760
 work just fine over the chin, but.

2:51:55.860 --> 2:51:59.380
 And the kicker here and why we practice this choke

2:51:59.380 --> 2:52:01.140
 was because when you go back and watch

2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:04.620
 all of the other matches, he always does this tripod

2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:06.220
 when I try to do arm locks,

2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:08.060
 which is typically what I would do.

2:52:08.060 --> 2:52:10.380
 And when I do that, he ends up sliding out

2:52:10.380 --> 2:52:12.340
 and I end up falling off.

2:52:12.340 --> 2:52:14.740
 So you step up here with the choke,

2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:18.140
 he does a tripod where he sticks his button to the air

2:52:18.140 --> 2:52:23.140
 and you, dude, what's the name of this choke?

2:52:23.420 --> 2:52:24.860
 Bone arrow.

2:52:24.860 --> 2:52:27.180
 No, but, okay, but I mean, when you do from like,

2:52:27.180 --> 2:52:30.260
 from that position, is there a way,

2:52:30.260 --> 2:52:32.740
 this entry into the bone arrow, I guess,

2:52:32.740 --> 2:52:33.580
 because you're doing.

2:52:33.580 --> 2:52:36.380
 We refer to Judo as a British strangle,

2:52:36.380 --> 2:52:38.260
 when they're in that turtle position

2:52:38.260 --> 2:52:39.940
 and you do that rolling motion.

2:52:39.940 --> 2:52:41.500
 Cool.

2:52:41.500 --> 2:52:43.900
 And here, when you go into that,

2:52:43.900 --> 2:52:45.620
 you can fall off of him, like you said,

2:52:45.620 --> 2:52:47.300
 if you're going for an arm bar,

2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:50.820
 but here, literally, because you have it under the chin

2:52:50.820 --> 2:52:53.320
 really well, there's just a nice control.

2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:56.740
 And I've already planned on it being on his chin.

2:52:56.740 --> 2:52:58.620
 That's why I've hooked the arm, right?

2:52:58.620 --> 2:53:00.340
 It's already starting to go straight.

2:53:00.340 --> 2:53:03.660
 Probably this choke in the early stages,

2:53:03.660 --> 2:53:06.800
 like a few frames before, feels like it,

2:53:08.420 --> 2:53:11.460
 like you're safe, it's fine.

2:53:11.460 --> 2:53:13.860
 Like the head will slip out or something like that.

2:53:13.860 --> 2:53:17.900
 Yeah, and that's why my left knee is up by his shoulder,

2:53:17.900 --> 2:53:20.700
 to keep that pressure down so that he can't posture it up.

2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:25.940
 When did you know you have this?

2:53:25.940 --> 2:53:27.140
 Oh, it works right here.

2:53:29.820 --> 2:53:34.320
 I actually panicked right about here.

2:53:36.620 --> 2:53:39.020
 Was maybe his head could come out?

2:53:39.020 --> 2:53:42.060
 My hand, I tore the muscle in my palm

2:53:42.060 --> 2:53:44.500
 because I was pulling so hard that I'm like,

2:53:45.700 --> 2:53:47.320
 he may not tap.

2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:48.160
 Yeah.

2:53:48.160 --> 2:53:52.140
 Like, is my hand just going to give out beforehand?

2:53:52.140 --> 2:53:52.980
 And there he is.

2:53:52.980 --> 2:53:55.020
 And we're right on this edge, right?

2:53:55.020 --> 2:53:57.060
 So like, if we roll a little bit outside

2:53:57.060 --> 2:54:00.340
 and I still don't have it, like that ref could stop it.

2:54:00.340 --> 2:54:02.000
 And then I felt him tapping and.

2:54:03.460 --> 2:54:08.160
 Oh, that, he's heartbroken.

2:54:08.160 --> 2:54:09.000
 I felt.

2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:10.260
 Surprised.

2:54:10.260 --> 2:54:11.320
 There it is.

2:54:13.100 --> 2:54:13.940
 The relief.

2:54:13.940 --> 2:54:15.100
 Olympic final.

2:54:17.340 --> 2:54:22.020
 And he knew, he knew he lost an Olympic medal right there

2:54:22.020 --> 2:54:23.980
 because he already knew

2:54:23.980 --> 2:54:26.740
 that the Japanese guy was going to be his bronze,

2:54:26.740 --> 2:54:27.740
 that he never beats.

2:54:29.660 --> 2:54:34.660
 See the, but also he probably in his head

2:54:35.420 --> 2:54:37.540
 was confident that he would be in the final.

2:54:37.540 --> 2:54:38.620
 Correct.

2:54:38.620 --> 2:54:41.780
 And so like this, he almost is surprised.

2:54:41.780 --> 2:54:42.860
 Yeah.

2:54:42.860 --> 2:54:45.140
 It's not supposed to happen this way.

2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:47.140
 And it's the second time it's happened.

2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:52.140
 And that's how you became an Olympic medalist.

2:54:54.800 --> 2:54:56.560
 Man, that must be a great feeling.

2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:59.440
 That must be a great feeling right here.

2:55:00.840 --> 2:55:04.320
 Just like all the years of injuries, all of it.

2:55:07.500 --> 2:55:11.120
 As fans that watch this too, it's like, holy shit.

2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:11.960
 He actually did it.

2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:13.960
 And it's a packed stadium too.

2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:15.160
 Not one empty seat.

2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:18.080
 Oh man.

2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:21.420
 So maybe what were you thinking here?

2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:24.360
 I'll just focus on the next match.

2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:25.600
 Yeah.

2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:30.600
 It took me maybe like a minute or so to like decompress

2:55:32.940 --> 2:55:35.960
 and then like get back to like my normal state

2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:36.800
 for the final.

2:55:39.340 --> 2:55:42.700
 So the final is against the,

2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:45.460
 the Russian here.

2:55:45.460 --> 2:55:47.300
 What can you say about your mindset?

2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:50.660
 You're saying the exact same thing.

2:55:50.660 --> 2:55:51.660
 Same thing.

2:55:51.660 --> 2:55:54.300
 Travel Stevens, Olympic champion.

2:55:54.300 --> 2:55:58.180
 I will not be denied because I had felt like in London

2:55:58.180 --> 2:56:02.500
 and throughout the years, I felt like I kept getting robbed.

2:56:02.500 --> 2:56:04.700
 So I made sure in my mantra to add that little bit

2:56:04.700 --> 2:56:07.700
 at the end to reassure myself that like,

2:56:07.700 --> 2:56:10.580
 they are not gonna control the outcome of today.

2:56:10.580 --> 2:56:12.280
 I'm gonna control the outcome.

2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:14.180
 What did you know about the Russian?

2:56:14.180 --> 2:56:15.020
 Everything.

2:56:17.180 --> 2:56:20.420
 And I honestly, I thought I had won the Olympics right now.

2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:22.500
 And I still do think that today.

2:56:22.500 --> 2:56:26.180
 Just like mentally when you think about it,

2:56:26.180 --> 2:56:31.180
 that I've won like, yeah, he threw me,

2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:35.580
 but it was like a one in a million chance

2:56:35.580 --> 2:56:37.580
 that that worked for him.

2:56:37.580 --> 2:56:38.540
 Like, come on.

2:56:38.540 --> 2:56:42.420
 So it's not like you feel lucky to be in the final.

2:56:42.420 --> 2:56:44.700
 It's like, you deserve to be champion.

2:56:44.700 --> 2:56:47.860
 Again, remember, I'm anticipating the goal.

2:56:47.860 --> 2:56:49.460
 Like I'm past that.

2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:52.140
 There's a confidence in the way you're moving

2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:52.980
 and the way you're.

2:56:52.980 --> 2:56:54.420
 Yeah, like I have his sleeve.

2:56:54.420 --> 2:56:55.400
 He's not breaking it.

2:56:55.400 --> 2:56:57.820
 Like still walking him down, still going forward.

2:56:57.820 --> 2:57:02.500
 Like I knew exactly how I was gonna beat him.

2:57:04.180 --> 2:57:06.460
 And I developed a plan because when I was getting ready

2:57:06.460 --> 2:57:10.900
 for Rio, we brought in a lot of the top Japanese players

2:57:10.900 --> 2:57:13.940
 that weren't invited to the camp for the national team

2:57:13.940 --> 2:57:14.780
 to Boston.

2:57:14.780 --> 2:57:16.380
 So I had four people, three of them were

2:57:16.380 --> 2:57:17.260
 on the national team.

2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:20.820
 One of them had won the universities in Japan,

2:57:20.820 --> 2:57:22.140
 all at 81 kilos.

2:57:23.100 --> 2:57:25.460
 I only got thrown once during camp for a month.

2:57:25.460 --> 2:57:26.420
 Wow.

2:57:26.420 --> 2:57:29.080
 Like I was ready.

2:57:31.380 --> 2:57:33.880
 I just, I fucking slipped.

2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:36.680
 Where does it happen?

2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:37.780
 Right when he threw me.

2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:40.640
 So if you let this play out really quick,

2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:42.360
 there's a point right here where I'm gonna come around

2:57:42.360 --> 2:57:46.800
 his back and I'm kinda gonna just yoko sutemi,

2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:48.460
 which means like a lateral drop.

2:57:48.460 --> 2:57:50.360
 And I'm just gonna bring him down to the floor,

2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:52.380
 which isn't a throw right here.

2:57:52.380 --> 2:57:54.480
 It's more of like a takedown, right?

2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:55.860
 I'm trying to get him to the ground

2:57:55.860 --> 2:57:57.160
 cause I wanna burn him.

2:57:57.160 --> 2:57:58.920
 He doesn't do any waza.

2:57:58.920 --> 2:58:00.200
 So I'm just gonna keep burning him.

2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:04.120
 And you can see that like I get really close here.

2:58:05.160 --> 2:58:08.440
 He just went a little too far to his side

2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:09.660
 during this exchange.

2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:12.360
 And like he's running.

2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:13.440
 I'm like, ah, he.

2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:20.100
 He's very wiry for an 81 kg player.

2:58:20.100 --> 2:58:20.940
 Yeah.

2:58:20.940 --> 2:58:23.520
 There's not much like muscle on him.

2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:26.040
 But he uses his length and his leverage very well.

2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:28.120
 And you can see like I'm really burning the clock here.

2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:30.560
 Like I'm owning these exchanges

2:58:30.560 --> 2:58:32.440
 more than I'm owning the tachi waza ones,

2:58:32.440 --> 2:58:33.600
 the ones in our feet.

2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:36.320
 So you weren't trying to necessarily like submit him here

2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:40.840
 or like really hard or like pin him.

2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:43.240
 You were trying to break him a bit.

2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:44.880
 I'm doing both.

2:58:44.880 --> 2:58:46.620
 I'm being overly physical.

2:58:48.320 --> 2:58:51.240
 And to a lot of the BJJ people who are watching this,

2:58:51.240 --> 2:58:54.120
 like they're like, oh, well I would have done this.

2:58:54.120 --> 2:58:55.020
 I would have done that.

2:58:55.020 --> 2:58:58.800
 You've got to think like if that referee

2:58:58.800 --> 2:59:00.200
 who's reffing the judo side of it

2:59:00.200 --> 2:59:02.600
 looks at it for a couple of seconds and is like,

2:59:03.540 --> 2:59:05.080
 he's not really moving.

2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:06.200
 They'll stop it.

2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:07.040
 Yeah.

2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:09.960
 So you're like, you understand judo.

2:59:09.960 --> 2:59:10.800
 Yeah.

2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:12.040
 What's called ne waza groundwork.

2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:14.920
 Like what you, cause you're really showing it to the ref.

2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:15.760
 Yes.

2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:17.960
 You have to show movement and progression.

2:59:19.440 --> 2:59:20.600
 That hurt the forehead.

2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:23.420
 Like see, I threw that hand in there kind of hard,

2:59:23.420 --> 2:59:25.840
 ripping it across his face just because.

2:59:29.480 --> 2:59:31.760
 I got to tell you there's a calm.

2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:35.120
 Well, no, he does look a little broken,

2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:38.440
 but the Russians have like this calmness.

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:40.840
 They're pretty good at.

2:59:40.840 --> 2:59:44.320
 Well, don't forget they've competed like this for long time.

2:59:44.320 --> 2:59:45.160
 Yeah.

2:59:45.160 --> 2:59:45.980
 It's all he knows.

2:59:47.680 --> 2:59:48.720
 And this is where I lose it.

2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:50.400
 See how my knee hit the ground.

2:59:50.400 --> 2:59:53.080
 My knee wasn't supposed to touch the ground.

2:59:53.080 --> 2:59:55.840
 I was supposed to sit to my hip to bring him down.

2:59:55.840 --> 2:59:58.120
 Something happened where my knee touched

2:59:58.120 --> 3:00:00.400
 and it didn't happen in the first one.

3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:01.520
 It just happened there.

3:00:02.360 --> 3:00:05.760
 So like that, we never should have been in that predicament.

3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:07.120
 Yeah.

3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:10.040
 And that's one of the things where

3:00:10.040 --> 3:00:12.840
 when you're looking at sports

3:00:12.840 --> 3:00:15.480
 for anybody who's trying to improve,

3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:19.680
 you have to, when you're trying to improve,

3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:23.820
 you've really got to ignore the ends of the spectrums.

3:00:24.960 --> 3:00:28.280
 The oopsies and the they got lucky.

3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:29.840
 And you only focus on the middle.

3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:33.080
 Like the technique I was doing was perfectly sound.

3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:36.720
 It just happened that the one oopsie happened on the stage

3:00:36.720 --> 3:00:38.320
 it shouldn't have happened on.

3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:43.260
 And there's no amount of drilling

3:00:43.260 --> 3:00:47.880
 that will ever like prevent that from happening.

3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:49.360
 And that's just the.

3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:50.200
 That's sports.

3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:52.000
 That's sports, especially the Olympics,

3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000
 especially Judo when it's like one.

3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:54.840
 You got one mistake.

3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:56.800
 Oopsie can just be your.

3:00:56.800 --> 3:00:57.920
 That's it.

3:00:57.920 --> 3:00:58.760
 That's it.

3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:00.160
 You know, it really requires

3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:02.720
 and you have to wrap your head around the idea of like,

3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:04.760
 if you want the ability to beat these people

3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:05.680
 and throw these people,

3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:08.160
 like you got to be willing to get thrown yourself.

3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:09.000
 Yeah.

3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:11.640
 Like this isn't boxing.

3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:13.520
 There's no like, I'm going to stand in a place

3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:16.120
 where he can't hit me and I can hit him.

3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:18.800
 Because we have the gi and because they can grab it,

3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:21.600
 they have just as much ability to throw you as you them.

3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:24.300
 So how'd you feel here?

3:01:24.300 --> 3:01:26.560
 How long was the duration of you feeling upset

3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.240
 that you didn't get the gold versus.

3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:29.120
 Never felt it.

3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:29.960
 Never felt it.

3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:32.320
 Just.

3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:34.080
 Because he didn't beat me.

3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:34.920
 Right.

3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:35.960
 Right, it's an important distinction

3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:40.040
 because when I'm training and when I'm competing,

3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:43.600
 like I understand that I take risks

3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:44.980
 and I accept those consequences.

3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:46.600
 That's why I take them.

3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:48.460
 That's a consequence.

3:01:48.460 --> 3:01:51.060
 That's not him being the better judo player

3:01:51.060 --> 3:01:54.620
 that dominated a match and I didn't have an answer

3:01:54.620 --> 3:01:56.060
 and then he threw me.

3:01:56.060 --> 3:01:58.220
 Then I would be a little upset.

3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:00.400
 Like when you're tired and somebody's coming at you

3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:02.840
 and like, you can't do anything about it,

3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:04.040
 that's a shitty feeling.

3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:04.960
 Yeah.

3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:05.780
 You know?

3:02:05.780 --> 3:02:06.620
 And that wasn't this.

3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:08.800
 And that wasn't this.

3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:12.960
 Like I accept losing when it's my fault.

3:02:14.140 --> 3:02:16.060
 Well, that was a hell of a story, man.

3:02:16.060 --> 3:02:21.060
 So from 2008, 2012, just the sheer number of injuries,

3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:26.740
 the weight cuts, all of that, the wanting to quit,

3:02:26.740 --> 3:02:30.980
 the doubts, I'm sure you did not get,

3:02:30.980 --> 3:02:33.520
 like the fans probably started disappearing

3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:35.700
 somewhere between the second and the third Olympics.

3:02:35.700 --> 3:02:37.860
 Like the support from.

3:02:37.860 --> 3:02:38.700
 It did.

3:02:38.700 --> 3:02:42.560
 Judo within the United States and just everybody, you know.

3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:47.360
 The USOC tried to cut all my funding in 2015 and said,

3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:48.600
 nah, you're too old.

3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:49.680
 Yeah.

3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:52.200
 So through all of that, to win the medal,

3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:55.080
 I mean, that's what the Olympics is about.

3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:57.800
 Is there some, like when you look back,

3:02:57.800 --> 3:02:59.580
 does that seem like another person?

3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:01.360
 Is this like another lifetime ago?

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.480
 Or like, that's a hell of an accomplishment.

3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:05.380
 How do you feel about the whole thing?

3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:11.200
 It's an interesting kind of predicament

3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:13.400
 because there's like those cookie cutter answers

3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:15.720
 about how proud you are and how grateful you are,

3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:20.200
 but at the end of the day, it's not who you are.

3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:24.880
 So that skillset and that mentality that,

3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:29.160
 you know, it took to accomplish that, that's who you are.

3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:34.160
 And so this was just a stepping stone in who I am.

3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:37.180
 So it's in the past to me.

3:03:37.180 --> 3:03:39.540
 Like there's no shrine in my house

3:03:39.540 --> 3:03:41.720
 that has like an Olympic medal in it.

3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:44.680
 I can't even remember the last time I looked at it.

3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:47.700
 So you're saying like the, all the stories,

3:03:47.700 --> 3:03:49.640
 the skills along the way,

3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:53.040
 that's like you right now sitting here is the shrine.

3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:53.880
 Yeah.

3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:56.300
 The who you become along the journey

3:03:56.300 --> 3:03:59.320
 is really what the prize is, right?

3:03:59.320 --> 3:04:02.840
 Like when you think about any of them,

3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:05.520
 most of the people that, you know,

3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:08.220
 go through that depression after the games,

3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:10.920
 it's because that is their shrine.

3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.080
 Like that is who they've identified as.

3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.280
 That is who they've told the world, the community,

3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:19.600
 their friends, their family, that's how they've identified.

3:04:20.580 --> 3:04:23.220
 I've identified as the person who perseveres,

3:04:23.220 --> 3:04:26.140
 overcomes and accepts challenges.

3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:32.160
 So like I, all those things are just like, you know,

3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:33.920
 putting a suitcase off to the side

3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:36.620
 and I'm onto the next great chapter thing

3:04:36.620 --> 3:04:38.280
 that I'm trying to do.

3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:43.280
 And it's both sad and cool that very few people

3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:47.060
 in the world get to experience what it's like to be you.

3:04:47.060 --> 3:04:51.340
 I mean, this level of having gone through that journey.

3:04:52.520 --> 3:04:54.220
 Everyone has the opportunity to.

3:04:56.160 --> 3:04:58.720
 Yeah, yeah.

3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:03.440
 I mean, I've done a few difficult things in my life,

3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:07.120
 but I gotta tell you, weight cuts and sauna.

3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:09.840
 And I would tell people right now who are listening,

3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:12.080
 like, don't go through that.

3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.320
 And I think a lot of wrestlers, a lot of young judo players,

3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:19.560
 a lot of young, like just combat sports people

3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:22.140
 where weight classes are a thing,

3:05:23.840 --> 3:05:25.560
 they almost take a sense of pride.

3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:27.400
 Like when I hear them talking about like,

3:05:27.400 --> 3:05:29.360
 oh, how much weight do you have to cut?

3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:30.640
 If you have to cut a pound more,

3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:33.040
 it's like you've accomplished more, like you're tougher.

3:05:33.040 --> 3:05:33.880
 Yeah.

3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:35.040
 Like you're not.

3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:37.420
 Like there's no trophies for that.

3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:41.140
 You, whatever the reason, had a job to do

3:05:41.140 --> 3:05:44.640
 and you got it done and that is truly inspiring,

3:05:44.640 --> 3:05:46.280
 no matter how hard.

3:05:46.280 --> 3:05:49.960
 That there's a big deep lesson to learn from that.

3:05:49.960 --> 3:05:51.600
 Then you start getting to the specifics

3:05:51.600 --> 3:05:53.280
 of whether you should weight cut or not.

3:05:53.280 --> 3:05:57.040
 But if we don't, then most of the great things we have

3:05:57.040 --> 3:05:58.800
 in this world, we wouldn't have.

3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:00.680
 The reason we have many of the great things

3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:02.900
 is because people did that weight cut.

3:06:02.900 --> 3:06:04.480
 The equivalent of the weight cut

3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:06.480
 for whatever the discipline, man.

3:06:06.480 --> 3:06:10.040
 There's a difference between having to do it

3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:12.600
 because you have to and you get through it,

3:06:12.600 --> 3:06:15.800
 then setting yourself up to do that

3:06:15.800 --> 3:06:18.620
 because you think it's the cool thing

3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:20.240
 or the thing you're supposed to be doing

3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:22.280
 in order to be successful.

3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:25.640
 There are plenty of like two time Olympic medalist.

3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:28.280
 I probably could have been a two time Olympic medalist

3:06:28.280 --> 3:06:30.520
 had I not cut that much weight.

3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:32.720
 I probably would have multiple world medals

3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:33.960
 had I not cut that much weight

3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:36.800
 because my body wouldn't have been that broken.

3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:38.140
 There's always the other side of it.

3:06:38.140 --> 3:06:40.320
 So just when you're looking at it,

3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:43.720
 like I just hear it in like young kids,

3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:45.800
 even some of my own, like when you hear them talk

3:06:45.800 --> 3:06:47.920
 about like where their weight's at,

3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:49.480
 they almost take a sense of pride

3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:51.200
 on how much they have to lose

3:06:51.200 --> 3:06:53.540
 because they hear stories like this.

3:06:53.540 --> 3:06:56.000
 And it's like, that's not the takeaway.

3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:59.040
 I did it because I had to.

3:06:59.040 --> 3:07:01.560
 I was put in a situation where like,

3:07:01.560 --> 3:07:03.040
 I may not have gone to this game

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:04.440
 had I moved up to 90 kilos

3:07:04.440 --> 3:07:07.800
 because I wouldn't have had time to grow into the division.

3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:09.080
 And then you get the job done.

3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:10.160
 And then you get the job done.

3:07:10.160 --> 3:07:14.280
 You're right, there's a very important difference.

3:07:14.280 --> 3:07:16.840
 And that's also with sleep.

3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:18.560
 That's what people talk to me about.

3:07:18.560 --> 3:07:21.760
 There should not be any glorification of not sleeping.

3:07:21.760 --> 3:07:24.820
 There should not be a glorification of cutting weight.

3:07:24.820 --> 3:07:28.800
 But if that's on the way to your,

3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:31.560
 whatever is that fire inside you

3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:35.140
 that you know needs to get done, like the job at hand,

3:07:35.140 --> 3:07:37.960
 if you need to sacrifice in some of those ways,

3:07:37.960 --> 3:07:39.560
 you get the job done.

3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:42.760
 Yeah, and the weight cut is an interesting one

3:07:42.760 --> 3:07:43.760
 because it's different.

3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:46.300
 I mean, you could speak to this.

3:07:46.300 --> 3:07:47.600
 There's different sports

3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:50.320
 in which the weight is more important than others.

3:07:50.320 --> 3:07:52.840
 And there's different levels to this game.

3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:54.960
 I think at the level you operated in,

3:07:54.960 --> 3:07:57.280
 that was probably essential.

3:07:57.280 --> 3:07:59.560
 Like there's huge games changed completely

3:07:59.560 --> 3:08:01.480
 from 81 kg to 90 kg.

3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:02.980
 It's a huge weight jump.

3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:05.820
 It's, first of all, it's weight, but then the strategy,

3:08:05.820 --> 3:08:07.600
 it's like so much changes the height

3:08:07.600 --> 3:08:08.560
 and all those kinds of things.

3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:11.060
 The physical, like people don't understand it,

3:08:11.060 --> 3:08:14.040
 but the physical size of a 90 kilo judo player

3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:17.320
 versus the physical size of an 81 kilo judo player,

3:08:17.320 --> 3:08:19.160
 it's like putting a human in a human.

3:08:19.160 --> 3:08:20.680
 Like there's enough space.

3:08:20.680 --> 3:08:23.820
 That's not like, you could stand next to your friend

3:08:23.820 --> 3:08:25.800
 who's 180 pounds and you could be 160

3:08:25.800 --> 3:08:27.160
 and you guys could look identical.

3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:28.000
 Yeah.

3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:30.040
 It is different when both the 90 kilo,

3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:33.720
 100 kilo and 81 kilo both have 6% body fat

3:08:33.720 --> 3:08:35.920
 and they're cutting into the class.

3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:38.720
 And it always feels like there's more variety at 90 kilo

3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:40.440
 because some of them are lanky and tall.

3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:42.960
 Yeah, some are short and stocky.

3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:45.560
 It's like 81 is more uniform, which I,

3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:48.080
 but then the flip side of that is the,

3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:50.080
 this is what I like in jiu jitsu, again,

3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:53.360
 amateur competing against bigger guys.

3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:54.320
 Like I love that more.

3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:56.760
 I like cutting weight just so I'm slim.

3:08:56.760 --> 3:08:57.800
 Like that's when I feel the best

3:08:57.800 --> 3:08:59.480
 with the same thing that you mentioned.

3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:03.560
 But like, I love going against 200, 220 that.

3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:04.880
 Because in jiu jitsu,

3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:08.440
 the weight doesn't get amplified in the sport.

3:09:08.440 --> 3:09:10.880
 Like the weight is just the weight, right?

3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:15.880
 If you can leg press 220 and you can bench 220,

3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:19.720
 then yeah, you can train with a guy who's 220.

3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:20.680
 That's easy.

3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:22.040
 They're not gonna hurt you.

3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:25.040
 And I mean, there is a truth that,

3:09:25.040 --> 3:09:27.520
 lightweights and middleweights in jiu jitsu

3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:29.600
 and the same is true for judo.

3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:31.240
 It's just like a lot more of them.

3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:32.840
 That means if you wanna be,

3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:37.280
 you're just competing at a higher level.

3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:40.440
 So like, there's much more variety of games.

3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:41.720
 The level is much higher.

3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:43.880
 So you're taking on a bigger challenge,

3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:47.440
 even if you're like, have a weight advantage.

3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:49.840
 So those are all decisions you have to kind of make.

3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:51.280
 And certainly in jiu jitsu,

3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:52.760
 people that are weight cutting are silly.

3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:55.200
 I mean, that's the natural beginner thing to do

3:09:55.200 --> 3:09:58.840
 is to feel the way the nervousness

3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:01.120
 about competition expresses itself

3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:04.920
 is through the desire to be as light as possible,

3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:07.840
 which is the totally wrong desire to have.

3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:11.560
 Right, like when you look at me now,

3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:15.400
 I'm probably like 230, right?

3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:18.000
 But I probably have the strength

3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.880
 of a 70 kilo judo player, right?

3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:24.360
 The weight doesn't really do much.

3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:27.440
 Yeah, I mean, you have the same thing with wrestling.

3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:30.200
 The skinny guys, the skinny you

3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:31.640
 that we're looking at there,

3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:34.960
 just the amount of power in that person is fascinating.

3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:35.880
 Because it doesn't look like,

3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:38.240
 you have some muscle, but it doesn't look,

3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:40.480
 but I've felt the power of some of those people.

3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:42.280
 Yeah, it's scary.

3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:44.640
 Yeah, it's different.

3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:46.840
 That's the best way I can describe it is like scary.

3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:49.640
 It's like, oh shit, again, it's the food chain.

3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:52.680
 You're not at the top of the food chain.

3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:54.040
 That's the natural feeling

3:10:54.040 --> 3:10:56.480
 when you go with some judo people.

3:10:56.480 --> 3:10:58.920
 What's your sense about this recent Olympics?

3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:02.000
 What stands out to you as,

3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:05.960
 so like Teddy Rene who was on a big run for a long time,

3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:08.240
 many consider him to be one of the greatest judo players

3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:12.880
 of all time, two time Olympic gold medalist

3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.880
 and two time Olympic bronze medalist of four Olympics.

3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:19.840
 Not counting like team stuff,

3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:24.600
 just doing individual and then like 10 time world champ.

3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:26.320
 Yeah, I'm not sure how they're gonna catalog

3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:27.880
 that team event.

3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:29.880
 Like are they all technically Olympic champions

3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:32.040
 or is France an Olympic champion?

3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:33.840
 No, they're all technically Olympic champions,

3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:35.760
 but I'm gonna ignore that.

3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:37.560
 Is that how they're gonna classify it now?

3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:40.160
 According, oh, sorry, according to Wikipedia,

3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:41.960
 like according to the internet.

3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:43.960
 I don't know, according to IGF or whatever.

3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:47.640
 Because some of those players never won a match.

3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:49.640
 They just filled a spot.

3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:52.120
 Oh, that's even a starker example.

3:11:52.120 --> 3:11:53.880
 Oh, that's sad.

3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:55.640
 You know, they lost in the individual

3:11:55.640 --> 3:11:57.880
 and then they also lost in the team.

3:11:57.880 --> 3:11:59.720
 And so.

3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:03.320
 Well, it's interesting because in the case of Teddy,

3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:08.720
 he was important to the win against Japan in this Olympics.

3:12:08.720 --> 3:12:11.200
 So like in the team event.

3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:14.960
 So like, I feel like you should put that in the equation

3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:16.880
 to say who won gold, right?

3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:20.280
 It does feel like he won gold in the team

3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:21.880
 because he carried the team.

3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:25.480
 Well, you have like Nomura at 60 kilos from Japan,

3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:28.200
 three time Olympic gold medalist, no team event.

3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:30.000
 Yeah.

3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.800
 Are you gonna weigh Teddy's team event?

3:12:33.800 --> 3:12:35.800
 No, no, we're not arguing this, of course.

3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:37.960
 No, I'm just wondering how like the IGF,

3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:40.360
 like when you look at a player stat,

3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.280
 is it gonna be like team gold medal for the Olympics

3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:47.040
 versus like their own personal gold medal?

3:12:47.040 --> 3:12:51.600
 Yeah, I think in sports, we have to be brutally honest.

3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:55.400
 And I think, hopefully this doesn't piss off people.

3:12:55.400 --> 3:12:56.240
 I hope it does.

3:12:56.240 --> 3:12:59.160
 But judo is an individual sport.

3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:01.600
 It's honestly just that one athlete,

3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:04.160
 maybe the athlete and coach, right?

3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:06.120
 If you look at the big, big picture,

3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:08.920
 but there's no team in judo.

3:13:08.920 --> 3:13:10.800
 That's the beauty of combat sports.

3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:12.560
 That's the honesty of it.

3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:16.160
 That's the brutality of losing to another human being

3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:17.400
 in a combat sport.

3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:20.480
 That's why it's so damn embarrassing when you get slammed

3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:23.280
 is because it's like, there's no team

3:13:23.280 --> 3:13:26.840
 to like carry some of that responsibility.

3:13:26.840 --> 3:13:28.960
 It's all on you and you suck.

3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:30.240
 That's why you lost.

3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:31.360
 There's that weight.

3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:32.920
 And that's why it's like magical.

3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:34.760
 It's not like soccer.

3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:37.440
 It's not like basketball.

3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:38.760
 Yeah, I couldn't play team sports

3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:40.560
 because if one of my teammates

3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:42.440
 wasn't doing their job correctly,

3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:44.400
 I would go play their position.

3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:45.560
 I'm gonna do it better than you.

3:13:45.560 --> 3:13:46.720
 Yeah, but that, you know,

3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:48.960
 some of the greatest leaders of teams also do that.

3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:50.320
 Michael Jordan is like that, right?

3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:54.280
 I mean, it's like with your actions,

3:13:54.280 --> 3:13:57.800
 you raised the level for everybody.

3:13:57.800 --> 3:13:59.320
 Like excellence is expected

3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:00.920
 and therefore everybody needs to step up.

3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:04.000
 So some of the greatest, I would say,

3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.280
 team leaders are individualists at heart.

3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:08.120
 But it's okay.

3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:10.000
 So Teddy, I think 10 time world champion,

3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:13.280
 non team, regular.

3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:14.120
 It's a big number,

3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:16.520
 but I think he has some like open weight categories in there.

3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:17.720
 Open weight, right, right.

3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:19.520
 I mean, you can count those, right?

3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:21.040
 I mean, that's interesting.

3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:22.840
 It's the same division twice.

3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:23.920
 It's the same division twice.

3:14:23.920 --> 3:14:24.760
 That's right.

3:14:24.760 --> 3:14:25.600
 One day after another.

3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:26.440
 Yeah, that's right.

3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:28.840
 I don't know if I wanna count that, yeah.

3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:30.840
 Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons

3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:35.200
 people don't usually put heavyweights in judo

3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:37.800
 as like the greatest of all time,

3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:40.080
 because the level of competition is lower.

3:14:40.080 --> 3:14:40.920
 Yes.

3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:44.640
 But anyway, he did lose in this match

3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:49.640
 to a young Russian, Tamerlan Bashev.

3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:53.800
 Match also not on the internet.

3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:55.160
 Thank you Olympics.

3:14:55.160 --> 3:14:58.200
 I am definitely going to go on some rants on the internet.

3:14:58.200 --> 3:14:59.560
 I love it.

3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:01.440
 As a fan of Olympics,

3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:05.240
 I feel like this definitely needs to change moving forward.

3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:07.400
 Like every single major Olympic event,

3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:10.120
 I also like random sports like weightlifting,

3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:11.760
 even though I don't do Olympic weightlifting.

3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:12.800
 It's fun just to watch.

3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:16.760
 Fun to watch such high level of excellence.

3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:20.560
 And the fact that we can't just fricking watch the full,

3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:23.880
 like each nicely categorized event is really heartbreaking

3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:26.240
 in judo, in Olympic weightlifting,

3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:28.600
 in track and gymnastics, all of that.

3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:32.320
 Anyway, so Teddy lost.

3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:33.960
 I mean, does that stand out to you?

3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:35.800
 If you were to like recap the things

3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:37.520
 that you remember from this Olympics.

3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:39.440
 I picked him losing already.

3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:41.200
 Like in my predictions.

3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:42.560
 Lose which, where?

3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:44.760
 That match or just in general somewhere?

3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:45.600
 In the final.

3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:46.600
 In the final, you thought.

3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:48.440
 Yeah, final or was it semi?

3:15:48.440 --> 3:15:49.640
 When I looked at his draw

3:15:49.640 --> 3:15:52.760
 because he decided not to compete throughout the quad

3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:54.760
 and do like the bare minimum to go,

3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:57.520
 because of his age,

3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:01.320
 I didn't think he would have enough energy

3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:04.800
 to battle his way through the draw that he had.

3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:06.400
 And sure enough, he didn't.

3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:07.800
 He felt earlier than I thought,

3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:12.800
 but he's not the young athletic person he used to be.

3:16:13.400 --> 3:16:16.400
 And when they changed the rules to judo,

3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:18.160
 they allowed people to take people

3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:20.560
 into really, really deep waters,

3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:22.760
 which you saw at this Olympics,

3:16:22.760 --> 3:16:27.760
 which did it ruin the sport or did it not?

3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.160
 Like, I'm not sure,

3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:32.240
 but it was definitely difficult to watch.

3:16:32.240 --> 3:16:35.440
 Would you put him at the greatest of all time

3:16:35.440 --> 3:16:36.680
 or asked another way,

3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:38.440
 like who do you think is the greatest judo player

3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:39.800
 of all time?

3:16:39.800 --> 3:16:42.840
 He's definitely not the greatest judo player,

3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:45.560
 but he's definitely the best competitor.

3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:48.160
 What's the difference in judo player and competitor?

3:16:48.160 --> 3:16:52.600
 There's an ability to like do the act of judo

3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:55.960
 of like throwing, pinning, arm locking

3:16:55.960 --> 3:16:58.720
 versus can you win a judo match?

3:16:58.720 --> 3:17:02.640
 Right, like when you look at somebody like Nomura

3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:05.480
 who like threw everyone he fought,

3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:09.040
 threw three Olympics, multiple world championships,

3:17:09.040 --> 3:17:12.960
 multiple things, like that's a pure judo player.

3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:14.640
 In the essence of judo,

3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:16.480
 he can throw, pin or arm lock

3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:19.480
 just about anybody he steps on the mat with during his time.

3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:25.440
 Teddy tended to, when you look at his judo,

3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:27.320
 because of his size,

3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:30.280
 again, it's just because he's in the heavyweight category,

3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:33.280
 he was so much bigger, so much stronger,

3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:35.920
 people just couldn't handle it.

3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:38.880
 And you would see really good judo players just break.

3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:41.960
 Like they could hang in there for a little bit,

3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:45.160
 but eventually his size, like you can't control that weight.

3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:46.120
 Weight moves weight.

3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:48.040
 And when you have to use all your strength

3:17:48.040 --> 3:17:51.560
 to keep him upright and off of you,

3:17:51.560 --> 3:17:52.760
 your muscles just give out

3:17:52.760 --> 3:17:55.800
 because you don't have somebody of that stature

3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:59.040
 and that skill to train with, to train those muscles.

3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:04.040
 So you're thinking more like those 73, 81, 90 kg people

3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:08.160
 that just stand in the pocket and just give everything.

3:18:08.160 --> 3:18:11.120
 Like what comes to my mind is like a Koga.

3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:11.960
 Koga.

3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:14.200
 You know, a Nomura who's a 60 kilo guy,

3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:16.560
 but again, like his dynamics

3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:20.600
 and how long he was dominant for, like it just.

3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:24.840
 Do you put value to like epic throws,

3:18:24.840 --> 3:18:28.040
 like singular moments of greatness?

3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:31.760
 If it's against a noteworthy player

3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:34.160
 in a noteworthy position.

3:18:34.160 --> 3:18:36.840
 There are a lot of highlights of people

3:18:36.840 --> 3:18:38.440
 that are good judo players,

3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:41.120
 but their highlights are of, you know,

3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:43.960
 scrubs on the IJF circuit.

3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:44.800
 Right.

3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:47.240
 It's like, great, the Japanese guy threw the guy

3:18:47.240 --> 3:18:51.680
 from, you know, Senegal free poem.

3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:52.520
 Great.

3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:53.800
 We kind of expected that.

3:18:53.800 --> 3:18:54.920
 You took the world number one

3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:57.840
 against the 330th person in the world.

3:18:57.840 --> 3:18:59.360
 What'd you think was gonna happen?

3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:01.920
 Like when I see those highlights like thrown around

3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:05.800
 like social media, I'm like, that's not a highlight.

3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:07.760
 They might as well have just been at the dojo

3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:09.440
 like practice and throws.

3:19:09.440 --> 3:19:12.520
 If you look at the like top 10 list for judo,

3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:15.560
 Kano always comes up, you know, as.

3:19:15.560 --> 3:19:18.200
 But he's not somebody that I don't think

3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:19.840
 his results are there,

3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:23.640
 but you don't really know how he got there.

3:19:23.640 --> 3:19:27.320
 So it's hard for me to like, I can't see his judo.

3:19:27.320 --> 3:19:28.320
 So I'm not sure.

3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:29.880
 Kano, by the way, is the founder of judo

3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:30.720
 for people who don't,

3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:32.480
 who are considered to be the founder of judo.

3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:33.320
 Yeah.

3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:35.080
 The sport evolves.

3:19:35.080 --> 3:19:36.200
 The players that are like,

3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:37.960
 if you took champions from the past

3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:40.560
 and you fought them against the players of today,

3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:43.000
 they're, it's not happening.

3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:44.840
 And that goes with anything, right?

3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:46.200
 So every time you think of like,

3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:48.040
 who's the best of all time,

3:19:48.040 --> 3:19:50.080
 it's probably somebody within a generation

3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:51.640
 or two of today.

3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:52.480
 Yeah.

3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:55.520
 If I'm gonna pick my top three, let's say,

3:19:55.520 --> 3:19:59.560
 top three, and I would go generationally speaking,

3:19:59.560 --> 3:20:01.280
 I would pick Ono for today,

3:20:02.760 --> 3:20:06.160
 probably Iliadis for like my timeframe,

3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:09.800
 like the, from a developmental standpoint.

3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:11.720
 And then I'd probably go Koga.

3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:14.360
 And then before Koga, I'd probably go Nomura.

3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:17.320
 As like the person of that generation

3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:18.560
 that people like,

3:20:20.320 --> 3:20:23.160
 as a whole in judo respected.

3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:24.000
 Yeah.

3:20:24.000 --> 3:20:25.120
 Well, in the case of,

3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:27.280
 I wonder if people feared Koga.

3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:28.240
 Yeah.

3:20:28.240 --> 3:20:29.320
 Yeah?

3:20:29.320 --> 3:20:32.280
 Like you're, that little guy's gonna get under you.

3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:33.720
 And you're gonna go for a ride.

3:20:33.720 --> 3:20:35.440
 You know, he was 78 kilos

3:20:35.440 --> 3:20:37.160
 when he took second at the All Japan's,

3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:38.920
 which is an open weight class.

3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:39.800
 Yeah.

3:20:39.800 --> 3:20:41.480
 You know, like he,

3:20:41.480 --> 3:20:44.200
 he could throw down with anybody any weight class.

3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:45.240
 He still went.

3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:46.760
 He was one of the early people

3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:49.360
 that planted the seed of judo,

3:20:49.360 --> 3:20:50.200
 love of judo in you.

3:20:50.200 --> 3:20:51.040
 It's like that.

3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:51.880
 Yeah.

3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:52.720
 And when I looked at him,

3:20:52.720 --> 3:20:57.480
 like that was how like I wanted my judo to be portrayed.

3:20:57.480 --> 3:20:58.920
 That style.

3:20:58.920 --> 3:20:59.920
 Yeah.

3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:02.360
 And then Iliadis, Iliadis, you just like,

3:21:02.360 --> 3:21:04.560
 I mean, you have a similar attitude as him.

3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:05.400
 So you just like the way he carries it.

3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:06.760
 That's why we get along.

3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:10.240
 You guys hang out.

3:21:10.240 --> 3:21:12.200
 I mean, I'd love to see that conversation.

3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:15.160
 I remember when we were talking about like his coaching,

3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:17.880
 I was like, why didn't you take this team?

3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:19.280
 Or like, why'd you pick this team?

3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:21.480
 And he's like, I can't work with those people.

3:21:21.480 --> 3:21:23.920
 Like those people are weak for children.

3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:25.680
 Like they don't know how to train hard.

3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:27.680
 I love that guy.

3:21:27.680 --> 3:21:28.520
 What about Ono?

3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:30.360
 Cause he was competing in this Olympics.

3:21:30.360 --> 3:21:32.160
 He got gold in this Olympics, right?

3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:34.120
 Yeah.

3:21:34.120 --> 3:21:34.960
 Yeah.

3:21:34.960 --> 3:21:36.040
 He lost in the team tournament though.

3:21:36.040 --> 3:21:37.240
 I think he just didn't care.

3:21:37.240 --> 3:21:38.080
 Yeah.

3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:39.240
 He just really wanted to throw that guy.

3:21:39.240 --> 3:21:41.000
 He like throws everybody.

3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:41.840
 Yeah.

3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:44.960
 So he's, he represents the thing you're mentioning.

3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:49.200
 I signed up to the judo fanatics, best of Ono.

3:21:49.200 --> 3:21:51.480
 Is there something that stands out to you about him

3:21:51.480 --> 3:21:53.720
 that's especially you find beautiful,

3:21:53.720 --> 3:21:56.200
 like, or powerful about his technique?

3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:00.440
 His adaptability to the situations

3:22:00.440 --> 3:22:05.080
 and understanding of like what needs to happen

3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:07.200
 in order to throw these people.

3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:10.360
 I specifically watched a match with his

3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:13.560
 and I was going to do a breakdown video on it because.

3:22:13.560 --> 3:22:15.160
 Is there a match, do you remember what it is?

3:22:15.160 --> 3:22:20.160
 It's him versus Garvey of Hungary.

3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:21.880
 Is he good at gripping?

3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:24.080
 So we're watching the match against Hungary.

3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:28.200
 So at the one minute, so right here, coming up.

3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:29.920
 I've heard he's freakishly strong.

3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:32.600
 I've never had the ability to train with him.

3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:33.760
 So I'm not.

3:22:33.760 --> 3:22:35.360
 Obviously he looks super skinny.

3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:39.000
 But when you see him without his gi jacket on,

3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:40.840
 like he's a jacked dude,

3:22:41.720 --> 3:22:44.800
 which is uncharacteristic of a Japanese player

3:22:44.800 --> 3:22:47.720
 from back in the day, in a way changed all that.

3:22:47.720 --> 3:22:49.200
 He was like, we're going to get physical

3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:50.560
 to compete with the Europeans.

3:22:50.560 --> 3:22:52.160
 That's another one of the greats, right?

3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:53.000
 Yeah.

3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:54.520
 He doesn't get mentioned enough.

3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:04.320
 And he's a righty here, yeah, okay.

3:23:04.320 --> 3:23:06.280
 And this is where he started setting it up.

3:23:06.280 --> 3:23:07.760
 It's like, you can see he was standing

3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:10.120
 in like a left handed stance and then he changes.

3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:16.720
 So he grips almost like a double sleeve,

3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:17.560
 not a double sleeve.

3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:18.400
 He holds the tricep.

3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:19.240
 The tricep.

3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:23.040
 And the front sleeve standing like a lefty.

3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:24.720
 And no body grip.

3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:27.080
 Just tricep and sleeve.

3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:30.160
 And that was like the biggest whip

3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:32.800
 and twist of a nutrimata I've ever seen.

3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:35.400
 Yeah, he doesn't actually lift him off the floor.

3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:39.440
 And if you look at it in like slow motion almost,

3:23:42.240 --> 3:23:43.960
 yeah, let's, yeah, there we go.

3:23:45.760 --> 3:23:48.920
 The Hungarian player was like 100% defense

3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:51.600
 and he still did this, right?

3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:54.920
 So right here, like press pause.

3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:59.240
 This is like an identifier if you're trying

3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:02.240
 to like learn judo and figure out how to set it up.

3:24:02.240 --> 3:24:05.560
 Because knowing how to get to the point right before

3:24:05.560 --> 3:24:08.480
 you pull the trigger is probably the most important.

3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:10.680
 So when we watch this play out,

3:24:10.680 --> 3:24:12.640
 what Ono's gonna do is he's gonna pivot

3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:14.480
 off his right leg right here.

3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:16.160
 He's gonna back step with his left

3:24:16.160 --> 3:24:19.000
 and it's gonna pull Ungarvi's front leg

3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:20.720
 all the way forward into what we would call

3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:23.080
 like a neutral square stance.

3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:25.200
 So he plants hard.

3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:26.040
 And look at Ono.

3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:27.160
 Oh, there's an interesting pull with the,

3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:28.240
 oh no, it's not a tricep.

3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:30.920
 He almost like, it starts with the tricep

3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:32.680
 and he like collects the gear or something like that.

3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:34.160
 But it's still above the elbow

3:24:34.160 --> 3:24:36.320
 because you can see the bend, right?

3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:38.600
 And right here, see how he never put,

3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:39.800
 back it up a little bit.

3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:43.720
 This is kind of like one of those things,

3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:45.440
 yeah, pause it right there.

3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:47.400
 So when he puts his right foot down,

3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:50.600
 he's pulling so hard with his back

3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:53.080
 that when Ono goes to put his left foot down,

3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:55.040
 it never touches the mat.

3:24:55.040 --> 3:24:57.400
 But by putting his left foot back,

3:24:57.400 --> 3:24:59.680
 it actually pulls Ungarvi's foot forward.

3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:02.360
 And so he's able to speed up his throw

3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:04.800
 by just continuing that motion back,

3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:07.840
 which what was supposed to have been a step

3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:11.720
 turned out to just, in the middle of the action,

3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:13.360
 he makes a split second decision

3:25:13.360 --> 3:25:15.960
 before putting the foot down to just continue.

3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:18.640
 Cause he recognizes that feel in his hands.

3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:20.880
 And so it's like, it never, it's a swing.

3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:22.800
 Like he never touches the ground with his left foot.

3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:26.000
 It never started as like a big swing to a back step.

3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:28.040
 He changed his mind partway through.

3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:30.640
 So it's right there, he wants to take a step.

3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:32.720
 And then he goes, nope, he's bringing that foot forward.

3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:34.160
 I'm just going to go for it.

3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:36.440
 Wait, is he full?

3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:37.760
 Full air.

3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:38.720
 Look at that.

3:25:38.720 --> 3:25:39.560
 Boom, boom.

3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:43.160
 And look at, if you go a few more steps forward right there,

3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:46.920
 his hip is the same height as Ungarvi shoulder.

3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:51.240
 Because he's leaning so far into the throw

3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:53.000
 with his body weight.

3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:56.240
 And he's allowing that tricep grip to rotate.

3:25:56.240 --> 3:25:58.800
 That's going to draw Ungarvi forward.

3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:01.160
 And now when you pause it right here,

3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:03.440
 you think about the sheer physics

3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:07.040
 to like get your body into this position.

3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:09.160
 Jimmy and I were so like,

3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:10.800
 when we saw this for the first time,

3:26:10.800 --> 3:26:13.640
 we tried to just stand like that and we couldn't do it.

3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:17.160
 His left foot is pointing straight ahead.

3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:19.760
 His chest is perpendicular to that foot

3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:21.320
 or parallel with it, right?

3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:22.760
 And his head is by his foot.

3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:23.600
 Yeah.

3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:25.520
 Is that only possible in the midst of a throw?

3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:27.520
 Do you think he works on making like?

3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:30.360
 I think he's done this particular throw,

3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:33.560
 not this style of it, but Uchi Mata so much

3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:37.440
 that his body has adapted to be able to do this.

3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:38.920
 So when people are trying to learn

3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:41.000
 and like break down videos,

3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:45.040
 they don't understand like the power he has

3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:48.560
 and what we call end range motion.

3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:49.400
 Yeah, look at that.

3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:52.360
 So like look at the full range of motion he takes, right?

3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:53.200
 Yeah.

3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:56.400
 His left foot swings all the way around

3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:00.040
 and the torso starts like at three oclock

3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:02.600
 and it goes all the way around

3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:04.720
 like almost back to the three oclock.

3:27:04.720 --> 3:27:05.560
 Yeah.

3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:08.040
 Like, like what?

3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:10.200
 And he never lifts his leg above his hip.

3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:16.400
 And the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it.

3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:17.560
 Yeah, look at that.

3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:19.120
 Stayed on his feet.

3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:19.960
 What's he doing?

3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:24.480
 Is that a matter of pride or just?

3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:26.520
 I think that's just habit.

3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:29.760
 The way the forces work, like he can just stay up.

3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:34.560
 That's one of the most beautiful throws I've ever seen.

3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:39.640
 There's so much wrong with it, but it worked.

3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:40.480
 It worked.

3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:41.320
 Because when you think about,

3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:42.640
 remember what we talked about the very beginning,

3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:45.600
 like he's got to get his center of gravity under his.

3:27:45.600 --> 3:27:47.200
 Well, here's one of the top players in the world

3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:48.920
 throwing another top player in the world

3:27:48.920 --> 3:27:51.240
 with his hip at that guy's shoulder height

3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:54.400
 and it's still working, it's.

3:27:55.320 --> 3:27:58.480
 Okay, so he, this generation, he could be the great.

3:27:58.480 --> 3:27:59.320
 Yeah.

3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:02.440
 And like he switched a lot of those details

3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:03.960
 of the throw in the middle.

3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:04.800
 In the middle.

3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:07.160
 And that only is, that means he's probably what,

3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:09.600
 like a hundred thousand times that throw has happened.

3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:10.440
 Yeah.

3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:12.880
 I saw you were into chess recently.

3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:16.640
 So you're like me, a bit of a beginner in chess.

3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:20.440
 You're part of launching the website Effective Chess.

3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:23.000
 So I got to ask, maybe it's a personal question,

3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:25.400
 but do you have advice to yourself

3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:28.400
 and to other beginners in exploring chess

3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:31.680
 of how to one, have fun and two, to start getting good?

3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:35.360
 It's nice to see like Olympic caliber athlete

3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.360
 take on a difficult task with a beginner's mind.

3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:42.760
 So like, what's that process like?

3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:47.760
 I'm a huge fan of just learning new things in general.

3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.400
 Right, like when I left Judo,

3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:55.400
 like I took a job as marketing for Fuji Sports

3:28:55.520 --> 3:28:58.280
 and I was getting frustrated with designers.

3:28:58.280 --> 3:29:00.760
 So I learned Photoshop.

3:29:00.760 --> 3:29:02.600
 I also got angry with the photographer.

3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:05.000
 So now I take all the photos too,

3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:07.040
 just because I don't mind learning.

3:29:07.040 --> 3:29:11.880
 I've spent my entire Judo career learning all the time,

3:29:11.880 --> 3:29:13.120
 like adding new techniques,

3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.560
 finding new ways, practicing, developing.

3:29:16.560 --> 3:29:18.560
 And so when it comes to chess,

3:29:18.560 --> 3:29:20.840
 I treat it just like I do anything else.

3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:23.040
 I just stick to one plan

3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:26.600
 and I learn all the ins and outs of that one plan.

3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:29.520
 And then I develop another plan, right?

3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:33.200
 Like I might practice like a London opening, for example,

3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:35.800
 and just, I don't even care if I win or lose.

3:29:35.800 --> 3:29:38.960
 I just wanna figure out how I'm gonna lose

3:29:38.960 --> 3:29:40.520
 and then figure out how I'm gonna win.

3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:43.840
 And once I know that position is now done,

3:29:43.840 --> 3:29:46.400
 then I start with another position.

3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:48.480
 And then once I figured out how I'm gonna lose

3:29:48.480 --> 3:29:49.760
 and how I'm gonna win,

3:29:49.760 --> 3:29:52.120
 the next thing I do is I don't go to a third.

3:29:52.120 --> 3:29:54.360
 I figure out the bridge between the two.

3:29:55.320 --> 3:29:57.120
 Like at what point during my openings

3:29:57.120 --> 3:29:59.560
 can I transition back into this opening?

3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:03.000
 Right, so like you have like some basic openings

3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:04.640
 and you wanna see how they go wrong,

3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:06.120
 how they go right, all the different ways.

3:30:06.120 --> 3:30:09.480
 And then that starts to solidify a higher level concept

3:30:09.480 --> 3:30:10.520
 of that particular opening

3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:12.320
 and you start to stitch together the concepts.

3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:13.440
 The concepts together,

3:30:13.440 --> 3:30:15.600
 cause being able to go from one to another

3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:19.600
 and then back and forth is part of the reasons

3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:21.440
 why like I was successful at judo

3:30:21.440 --> 3:30:25.240
 is just because everything I do,

3:30:25.240 --> 3:30:27.680
 at some point it touches that spider web

3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:30.740
 of like being able to get from one area to another.

3:30:30.740 --> 3:30:32.480
 We refer to it as like a toolbox, right?

3:30:32.480 --> 3:30:34.600
 You need more tools in your toolbox.

3:30:34.600 --> 3:30:36.280
 But if you're always grabbing the wrong tool

3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:40.320
 for that job, then you're just not gonna have success.

3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:41.320
 I actually forgot to ask,

3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:44.280
 you mentioned a few greatest chess players of all time

3:30:44.280 --> 3:30:47.040
 and I noticed you didn't mention Vladimir Putin.

3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:50.800
 I gotta ask you about his judo.

3:30:50.800 --> 3:30:53.800
 Do you by chance know much about his judo?

3:30:53.800 --> 3:30:58.320
 What do you think about a president of a major nation

3:30:58.320 --> 3:30:59.680
 being a judo black belt?

3:30:59.680 --> 3:31:03.080
 And I think from what I've seen, pretty good at it.

3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:08.080
 I think it shows, you know, if he actually got it,

3:31:09.240 --> 3:31:12.040
 like let's go with that premise of like he earned it.

3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:14.320
 Right?

3:31:14.320 --> 3:31:19.240
 That just shows like a level of like physical persistence

3:31:19.240 --> 3:31:22.860
 and mental fortitude to be able to like,

3:31:24.160 --> 3:31:26.120
 you know, take those beatings

3:31:26.120 --> 3:31:29.240
 and just keep showing up until you've overcome

3:31:29.240 --> 3:31:31.280
 and can now give those beatings.

3:31:31.280 --> 3:31:34.360
 As you know, in Japan and Russia, you get it by just like,

3:31:34.360 --> 3:31:36.440
 when you're young, it's easier to get a black belt

3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:39.520
 when you're like, just go through a bunch of beatings

3:31:39.520 --> 3:31:42.800
 for like 10 years in your teenage years.

3:31:42.800 --> 3:31:47.800
 But there's also from it springs like a camaraderie.

3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:51.520
 Like there's a definitely a brotherhood and sisterhood

3:31:51.520 --> 3:31:55.900
 in terms of judo to where you're connected forever

3:31:55.900 --> 3:31:57.520
 because of that.

3:31:57.520 --> 3:31:59.380
 For many people, it's their childhood connection.

3:31:59.380 --> 3:32:01.920
 You sort of leave judo, you know,

3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:04.240
 in your twenties and your thirties, but that's always there.

3:32:04.240 --> 3:32:05.480
 And the same is true with wrestling.

3:32:05.480 --> 3:32:10.480
 So it's interesting to see him pay respect to that,

3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:15.640
 like by going with the Russian national judo team.

3:32:15.700 --> 3:32:18.320
 And I think he did, obviously they have to get thrown,

3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:19.160
 right?

3:32:19.160 --> 3:32:20.800
 But just, you can tell,

3:32:20.800 --> 3:32:22.320
 and you probably could tell even better,

3:32:22.320 --> 3:32:24.940
 but you can tell when a person moves in a way

3:32:24.940 --> 3:32:28.280
 where you're like, okay, you've had like 10 years

3:32:28.280 --> 3:32:31.480
 of beatings and you can tell the way they pull,

3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:32.520
 the way they move.

3:32:32.520 --> 3:32:36.720
 But I also like, in contrast to the US national team,

3:32:36.720 --> 3:32:40.880
 or I don't even think there's a national team for US, right?

3:32:40.880 --> 3:32:42.580
 It's the Pedro Judo center, right?

3:32:44.720 --> 3:32:47.520
 That there is some, it's really cool

3:32:47.520 --> 3:32:49.080
 when there's a camaraderie like that

3:32:49.080 --> 3:32:52.600
 amongst the highest level Olympic caliber athletes in Russia.

3:32:52.600 --> 3:32:54.840
 I suppose Japan might have similar kind of thing.

3:32:54.840 --> 3:32:59.840
 And then you can have the system of people together

3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:03.000
 and then you can have a strong coaching staff,

3:33:03.000 --> 3:33:05.160
 not just like a coach, but a coaching staff.

3:33:05.160 --> 3:33:07.200
 And then you can have the nation backing that staff.

3:33:07.200 --> 3:33:09.040
 I mean, and then the result is like,

3:33:09.040 --> 3:33:12.240
 you have some incredible level of judo emerge.

3:33:14.080 --> 3:33:15.360
 Is there something you could say,

3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:17.560
 we didn't talk much about Jimmy.

3:33:17.560 --> 3:33:20.500
 I mean, he was a critical part of your just,

3:33:20.500 --> 3:33:25.420
 like of your perseverance through all the,

3:33:25.420 --> 3:33:27.220
 all that you had to go through.

3:33:27.220 --> 3:33:28.820
 What did you learn from Jimmy?

3:33:29.660 --> 3:33:32.660
 What are some impacts that he had on your life,

3:33:32.660 --> 3:33:34.260
 both on the mat and off the mat?

3:33:37.100 --> 3:33:41.860
 If we had to like put it down to like a very simple thing,

3:33:41.860 --> 3:33:45.180
 he taught me how to win, right?

3:33:45.180 --> 3:33:49.340
 It wasn't necessarily like the technical side of judo.

3:33:49.340 --> 3:33:51.820
 Like we went over gripping, we went over this,

3:33:51.820 --> 3:33:53.700
 we adapted that.

3:33:53.700 --> 3:33:56.420
 But the real strength to Jimmy was like,

3:33:56.420 --> 3:33:58.420
 he knows how to win.

3:33:58.420 --> 3:34:00.700
 And most people think,

3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:03.060
 well, if I get really good at this technique,

3:34:03.060 --> 3:34:05.700
 I'll be able to throw people with it, not win.

3:34:05.700 --> 3:34:09.520
 That is not how the world of sports works, right?

3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:13.300
 Like I remember in one of my YouTube videos,

3:34:13.300 --> 3:34:17.520
 I was doing a breakdown of a match from the Cuba Grand Prix

3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:19.820
 where I was fighting a Mongolian guy.

3:34:19.820 --> 3:34:22.220
 He's kicking the shit at me, I'm not gonna lie.

3:34:22.220 --> 3:34:26.900
 Four minutes in, like he just throwing me like left

3:34:26.900 --> 3:34:28.780
 and right, he was so fast.

3:34:28.780 --> 3:34:31.180
 I felt like I just couldn't get to him.

3:34:31.180 --> 3:34:34.580
 In the last 30 seconds, he changed.

3:34:34.580 --> 3:34:38.620
 He started protecting his lead instead of continuing

3:34:38.620 --> 3:34:41.900
 the fight the way the entire match was going in his favor.

3:34:41.900 --> 3:34:44.500
 He made a mental shift and when he made that mental shift,

3:34:44.500 --> 3:34:46.080
 I beat him.

3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:49.300
 Because he didn't know how to win the fight.

3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:54.300
 He can win exchanges, but he can't win the fight.

3:34:54.300 --> 3:34:57.260
 So the last thing you wanna do is have to win

3:34:57.260 --> 3:34:59.940
 every exchange in a match.

3:34:59.940 --> 3:35:03.940
 You wanna know how to kick it into sixth gear.

3:35:03.940 --> 3:35:06.180
 Like when to step off the gas,

3:35:06.180 --> 3:35:08.060
 when to focus on gripping,

3:35:08.060 --> 3:35:10.540
 when to attack, how often to attack,

3:35:10.540 --> 3:35:12.720
 all those things like.

3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:14.900
 And you've had those conversations with Jimmy like,

3:35:14.900 --> 3:35:17.820
 this is not like how to stop trying to win every exchange,

3:35:17.820 --> 3:35:18.660
 that kind of thing.

3:35:18.660 --> 3:35:19.940
 And instead.

3:35:19.940 --> 3:35:21.060
 Because I was a brawler before.

3:35:21.060 --> 3:35:23.940
 I was like, if I threw you once, I'm throwing you again.

3:35:23.940 --> 3:35:25.700
 And sometimes you get caught.

3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:27.140
 Why would I do that?

3:35:27.140 --> 3:35:28.940
 I'm already winning.

3:35:28.940 --> 3:35:30.700
 What about like the mental side of the game,

3:35:30.700 --> 3:35:32.900
 the preparation, all those things?

3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:35.940
 One of the biggest things Jimmy brought to the forefront

3:35:35.940 --> 3:35:37.660
 when it came to like the mental side

3:35:37.660 --> 3:35:41.160
 was the visualization, right?

3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:44.400
 And when I started visualizing myself winning,

3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:46.700
 I started seeing more success.

3:35:46.700 --> 3:35:49.420
 But once I started seeing more success,

3:35:49.420 --> 3:35:52.820
 with the visualization also came self doubt.

3:35:52.820 --> 3:35:57.820
 Because as I'm starting to picture myself like,

3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:02.240
 I would picture myself before fighting Church's village,

3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:05.300
 I'm gonna throw him with Koshiguruma and I can see it.

3:36:05.300 --> 3:36:08.320
 And if I stand in the shoot for too long,

3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:11.640
 you start to like, but what if he counters?

3:36:11.640 --> 3:36:14.640
 Then you go, well, if he counters with this,

3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:15.760
 I'm gonna counter with that.

3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:18.040
 But you already let that doubt in.

3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:20.620
 And then you start playing this like five step scenario,

3:36:20.620 --> 3:36:22.200
 but you still come out on top.

3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:26.400
 But all that doubt has like seeped into your mind, right?

3:36:26.400 --> 3:36:29.320
 And a lot of people don't understand

3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:31.900
 that that's a bad thing.

3:36:31.900 --> 3:36:33.720
 You're still winning in your mind,

3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:35.840
 but you're also doubting yourself in your mind.

3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:38.920
 Yeah, once you let that doubt seep in,

3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:40.580
 it's destructive.

3:36:40.580 --> 3:36:44.680
 Yeah, and so I remember I was at the World Championships.

3:36:44.680 --> 3:36:47.520
 I can't remember what year it was, but I was ready.

3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:50.440
 Like I was healthy, I was ready to go.

3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:52.360
 And we all thought like,

3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:54.520
 this is the year Travis wins the Worlds.

3:36:55.360 --> 3:36:57.900
 I go out there in the first round,

3:36:57.900 --> 3:37:00.200
 I'm in the shoot for like 45 minutes.

3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:03.080
 Like the match went into golden score,

3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:05.160
 then the next match went into golden score,

3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:07.440
 then the fucking next match went into golden score.

3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:09.140
 Then the referee came and told me,

3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:10.600
 you can't wear your gi.

3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:12.800
 Then Big Jim goes, why can't he wear his gi?

3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:14.380
 Any gi that has his name on it,

3:37:14.380 --> 3:37:15.520
 we're not gonna let him wear.

3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:17.280
 He has to wear a different gi.

3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:18.800
 So then I go, fuck you, I'm leaving.

3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:20.520
 And I walked out there and I fought.

3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:22.480
 I lost in golden score because I did a kochi

3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:23.880
 and they called it a false attack.

3:37:23.880 --> 3:37:27.360
 And I went, great, I'm out of the fucking Worlds.

3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:29.240
 But when I was in the shoot,

3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:33.200
 I struggled because I started allowing the like

3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:37.480
 Hungarian guy that I was gonna face to do things to me

3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:40.280
 that I would have to play defense to and then counter.

3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:44.380
 It's like, great, but now I'm doubting my own ability.

3:37:44.380 --> 3:37:46.700
 So I went to a sports psychologist

3:37:46.700 --> 3:37:49.920
 and the big game changer for me was,

3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:54.320
 I focused more on the emotional, physical response

3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:59.320
 that happens in matches rather than the actual quote unquote

3:37:59.740 --> 3:38:02.920
 like Instagram picture that would have happened.

3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:05.480
 So when I was getting ready for 2016,

3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:08.360
 you think about like,

3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:10.440
 how do you feel like standing in the shoot?

3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:11.500
 Like, what does your body feel like?

3:38:11.500 --> 3:38:12.560
 Is your heart racing?

3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:13.420
 How's your breath?

3:38:13.420 --> 3:38:15.160
 Is your mouth dry?

3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:16.520
 And then you think about like, okay,

3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:17.680
 the ref just started the match.

3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:18.520
 What happens?

3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.240
 Like, how, what's the atmosphere like?

3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:23.120
 How do you emotionally respond to these things?

3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:28.060
 More so than me trying to beat a specific judo player,

3:38:28.060 --> 3:38:28.900
 right?

3:38:28.900 --> 3:38:31.320
 Like, oh, the ref just gave you a penalty at a minute 30.

3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:32.440
 Like, how do you feel?

3:38:32.440 --> 3:38:35.880
 And then you start thinking about the physical responses.

3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:37.760
 And when you do that really well,

3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:39.600
 you can actually get the pins and needles

3:38:39.600 --> 3:38:41.040
 and your body will start to sweat

3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:44.760
 and your heart will start to race as if you're in it.

3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:47.380
 Cause it's not about the technique.

3:38:47.380 --> 3:38:49.160
 It's more about the physical.

3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:51.600
 Like, what does it feel like to have your fingers ripped

3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:54.240
 out of a gi in the first exchange?

3:38:54.240 --> 3:38:56.280
 Now my hands can feel that.

3:38:56.280 --> 3:38:57.120
 That's fascinating.

3:38:57.120 --> 3:38:59.280
 And then on a cellular level,

3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:02.240
 like I fought the Olympic games so many times

3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:05.200
 to the point where like, it is no longer a goal.

3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:06.680
 It's an anticipation.

3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:07.520
 Right.

3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:09.620
 So down to the experience of the grip break,

3:39:09.620 --> 3:39:13.560
 that just the sweat, the, the heart beating, the, yeah.

3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:15.720
 What does it feel to have your head smashed into a mat

3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:17.720
 and driven across the mat with a mat burn?

3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:18.540
 Yeah.

3:39:18.540 --> 3:39:19.380
 And then getting back up.

3:39:19.380 --> 3:39:20.220
 Yeah.

3:39:20.220 --> 3:39:21.220
 And getting back up.

3:39:21.220 --> 3:39:22.060
 Yeah.

3:39:22.060 --> 3:39:24.000
 Like with a bit of a burn, all that kind of stuff.

3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:25.480
 The actual sensation on the skin.

3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:28.880
 The actual sensation of what it takes to fight a judo match.

3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:30.240
 It's not a strategy, like,

3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:32.520
 but the actual sensations, the full experience.

3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:34.320
 That's fascinating.

3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:36.560
 Cause then your body's going to fight hundreds of matches

3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:38.560
 without the physical damage.

3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:41.220
 And you could probably get really far with that.

3:39:41.220 --> 3:39:44.360
 And not also in just judo, but basically anything.

3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:46.880
 You can simulate.

3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:47.720
 Yeah.

3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:49.400
 If you learn how to simulate well.

3:39:50.720 --> 3:39:55.720
 You've lived a very, a hell of a life.

3:39:55.920 --> 3:39:58.840
 Is there a device you can give to young people?

3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:01.520
 Sort of a high school, college,

3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:05.280
 thinking about their career, thinking about life,

3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:06.960
 how to live one they're proud of?

3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:15.760
 I think the number one thing I can tell people is,

3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.560
 and how I've lived my life is,

3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:20.000
 you've really got to like,

3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:21.920
 forget everybody in your life right now.

3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:24.040
 Your mother, your father, your grandparents,

3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:26.520
 your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whoever it is,

3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:30.800
 and really decide like, what is going to make you happy?

3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:34.040
 At some point in my career,

3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:38.280
 the act of pushing my body to the limit

3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:42.180
 made me happier than winning a grand slam medal.

3:40:44.420 --> 3:40:45.920
 Pushing my body to the limit

3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:48.660
 didn't make me happier than winning an Olympic medal.

3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:52.880
 There's a balance there.

3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:56.360
 And I think a lot of people struggle with living their life

3:40:56.360 --> 3:41:00.440
 where they're happy and they make other people happy

3:41:00.440 --> 3:41:04.620
 or take in their feelings into the considerations

3:41:04.620 --> 3:41:06.520
 of what they need to do in their life.

3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:12.000
 And I think if they can cut those strings sooner,

3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:13.840
 it'll allow you to get over it quicker

3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:16.160
 and get to a happier place sooner.

3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:17.640
 And then as long as you're focusing

3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:19.120
 on what's making you happy,

3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:22.120
 the things you do that make you happy

3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:25.040
 will attract other people who do those things

3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:29.360
 that will in turn build stronger, better relationships.

3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:34.360
 And then you will also realize the best form of yourself

3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:36.600
 and inspire many others.

3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:41.600
 You've inspired me to, for whatever the hell I've done,

3:41:42.760 --> 3:41:44.760
 at least to do a slightly better job

3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:47.440
 than I otherwise would have by doing martial arts,

3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:49.280
 by taking that journey,

3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:51.280
 and I think becoming a better person because of it.

3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:55.280
 So Travis, I have been, I continue to be

3:41:55.280 --> 3:41:56.840
 one of your biggest fans.

3:41:56.840 --> 3:42:01.240
 I love your whole career in the way you pursued happiness.

3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:03.120
 I love what you and Jimmy have done.

3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:06.240
 I love the sport of judo as represented by you.

3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:08.920
 So I deeply appreciate what you've done, man.

3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:11.960
 And I'm honored that you would spend your time with me today.
