00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
 I hate affirmative action.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.480
 I don't just disagree with it.

00:03.480 --> 00:06.360
 I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.900
 I hate it.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.880
 The hatred comes from an understanding

00:09.880 --> 00:12.400
 that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute

00:12.400 --> 00:14.760
 for the actual development of the capacities

00:14.760 --> 00:16.520
 of our people to compete.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.400
 They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.200
 We're gonna have a separate program for you.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.000
 We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.280
 That doesn't make us any smarter.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.240
 It doesn't make us any more creative

00:30.240 --> 00:34.000
 and it doesn't make us any more fit

00:34.000 --> 00:37.320
 for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.080
 The following is a conversation with Glenn Loury,

00:42.080 --> 00:44.200
 professor of economics and social sciences

00:44.200 --> 00:45.480
 at Brown University.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.540
 He is one of the great minds and communicators of our time,

00:49.540 --> 00:53.480
 writing and speaking about race and inequality.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.280
 I highly encourage you to listen to his show

00:56.280 --> 01:00.120
 on YouTube and Substack, simply called The Glenn Show.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.920
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:04.960 --> 01:06.080

01:06.080 --> 01:09.400
 And now, dear friends, here's Glenn Loury.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.960
 Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech

01:12.960 --> 01:15.480
 I think is the greatest speech in American history.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.760
 If I may, I'd like to read a few words of it.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.600
 Sure.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.160
 And ask you a question about this dream.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.160
 I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up

01:26.280 --> 01:28.980
 and live out the true meaning of its creed.

01:28.980 --> 01:31.640
 We hold these truths to be self evident,

01:31.640 --> 01:33.480
 that all men are created equal.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.920
 I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,

01:38.920 --> 01:41.800
 the sons of former slaves and the sons of former

01:41.800 --> 01:44.600
 slave owners will be able to sit down together

01:44.600 --> 01:46.000
 at the table of brotherhood.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.840
 I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,

01:50.840 --> 01:54.160
 a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.600
 sweltering with the heat of oppression,

01:56.600 --> 02:00.840
 will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.320
 I have a dream that my four little children

02:04.320 --> 02:08.000
 will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged

02:08.000 --> 02:09.800
 by the color of their skin,

02:09.800 --> 02:12.540
 but by the content of their character.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.720
 I have a dream today.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.360
 First of all, damn.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.560
 I mentioned to you offline I immigrated to America

02:19.560 --> 02:20.920
 and this is why I love this country.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.160
 This is one of the great speeches that represents

02:23.160 --> 02:25.040
 what this country is about.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.400
 So what is this ideal of equality

02:29.260 --> 02:31.360
 that we should strive for as a nation,

02:31.360 --> 02:33.440
 that all men are created equal?

02:33.440 --> 02:35.720
 What does that mean to you, this equality?

02:37.400 --> 02:41.800
 Well, if we put this in historical context,

02:43.080 --> 02:47.280
 King is speaking in 1963 when he gives that speech.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.280
 It's exactly 100 years after Abraham Lincoln signs

02:53.060 --> 02:55.600
 the Emancipation Proclamation

02:55.600 --> 03:00.600
 declaring the enslaved people to be free.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.960
 They're not yet citizens in 1863,

03:07.040 --> 03:10.500
 but the end of slavery has become the position

03:10.500 --> 03:13.400
 of the federal government when Lincoln issues

03:13.400 --> 03:17.320
 that Emancipation Proclamation.

03:17.320 --> 03:22.000
 So putting it in context, enslaved people,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
 four million or so African descended enslaved people,

03:28.280 --> 03:31.120
 how do they become citizens?

03:31.120 --> 03:36.120
 How do they become in this status of subjugation

03:38.280 --> 03:42.240
 and domination and stigma and exclusion?

03:42.240 --> 03:44.320
 How do they become citizens?

03:44.320 --> 03:48.840
 It seems to me that that's the heart of it.

03:48.840 --> 03:53.120
 The equality that King is talking about

03:53.120 --> 03:58.120
 is an equality of status as members of the nation

03:59.220 --> 04:03.600
 as free and equal citizens within the republic.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.500
 Now, I think it's really important to understand

04:07.500 --> 04:12.500
 that slavery was not merely a legal order,

04:13.880 --> 04:18.320
 but it was also a social system

04:18.320 --> 04:22.840
 that had the symbolism attached to it.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.640
 They had a big journey to make

04:25.640 --> 04:30.640
 from their subjugated status as serfs, as landless people,

04:30.840 --> 04:33.820
 as uneducated, unfit for citizenship really

04:33.820 --> 04:35.680
 in the minds of many.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.680
 So I think that's what in 1963, 100 years later,

04:42.160 --> 04:45.040
 that King is appealing to this idea

04:45.040 --> 04:50.040
 that when Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence

04:50.840 --> 04:54.480
 writes these words, all men are created equal

04:54.480 --> 04:56.040
 and endowed by their creator

04:56.040 --> 04:59.000
 with certain inalienable rights,

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
 Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, didn't have in mind

05:05.680 --> 05:09.240
 when he wrote those words, the people who were slaves.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.400
 But by the time you get to 1963,

05:13.400 --> 05:18.400
 King is invoking this idea, all men,

05:19.120 --> 05:20.560
 and of course he means all persons.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.240
 He doesn't only mean men.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.520
 He means men and women are created equal.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.520
 He wants this idea to be embraced by the country

05:30.840 --> 05:35.040
 in reference to the descendants of the African slaves.

05:35.040 --> 05:35.880
 That's his dream.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.160
 That's his idea.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.980
 The legacy of slavery would be erased,

05:41.160 --> 05:46.160
 that the position of African Americans would be equalized

05:46.480 --> 05:48.980
 within the political community,

05:48.980 --> 05:51.760
 which is the United States of America.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.680
 That's my sense of it in any case.

05:53.680 --> 05:58.320
 So on a very basic level, the worth of a human being

05:58.320 --> 05:59.160
 is equal.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.640
 It's just literally the worth of a human being.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.920
 So I mentioned to you offline

06:03.920 --> 06:06.840
 that I came from the Soviet Union.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.920
 My grandfather fought in World War II,

06:10.920 --> 06:15.920
 and for Hitler, the worth of a Slavic person

06:17.640 --> 06:21.100
 as they were captured, there's different numbers,

06:21.100 --> 06:24.000
 but it's in the hundreds to one German

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
 in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.040
 So he wanted Germany to expand

06:32.040 --> 06:34.400
 and conquer a large part of the world.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.680
 And within that future world, that Third Reich,

06:37.680 --> 06:41.880
 the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person

06:41.880 --> 06:45.920
 is one hundredth or one thousandth of a German person,

06:45.920 --> 06:47.680
 of a pure German person.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.140
 So that has to do with not some kind of public policy

06:51.140 --> 06:53.400
 or politics or all that kind of stuff.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.440
 It has to do with the basic worth of a human being.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.760
 And that's what Dr. King is speaking to,

06:58.760 --> 07:03.560
 that all people on some kind of deep level

07:03.560 --> 07:05.600
 are worth the same.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.800
 If you're somehow weighing the value of a person,

07:10.800 --> 07:14.760
 we're equal in that basic fundamental worth.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.480
 Yeah, I think that's correct.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.480
 I think that's very well said.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.000
 I don't know that he had in mind

07:20.000 --> 07:23.600
 the position of Slavic people in Central Europe

07:23.600 --> 07:25.280
 in the middle of the 20th century,

07:25.280 --> 07:27.880
 or the first part of the 20th century, King.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.400
 I don't know that he had that in mind.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.440
 He might well have done.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.120
 But certainly that's the idea.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.960
 So you don't think he was really thinking

07:35.960 --> 07:40.480
 about this particular civil rights struggle

07:40.480 --> 07:42.800
 and the particular struggle

07:42.800 --> 07:47.800
 against the backdrop of the history of slavery in America

07:47.880 --> 07:49.600
 and thinking about African Americans.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.160
 He wasn't thinking about the basic,

07:52.160 --> 07:55.160
 he wasn't speaking to the basic worth of all human beings.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.860
 No, I don't mean to say that.

07:56.860 --> 08:00.320
 The speech in Washington.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.160
 The dream.

08:01.160 --> 08:06.160
 In 1963 at that march was within the context

08:07.320 --> 08:08.400
 of the United States.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.360
 And it was within the context of the civil rights movement.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.280
 There was a movement that was going on.

08:15.760 --> 08:20.760
 He was an actor in a political drama that was American

08:21.640 --> 08:26.400
 that had to do with the fight over equal rights

08:26.400 --> 08:30.960
 for voting, for housing, for employment,

08:30.960 --> 08:34.720
 for citizenship of blacks in America.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.680
 But King was informed, I think,

08:37.680 --> 08:42.680
 by a much broader Christian ethic of the equality

08:43.120 --> 08:44.480
 of all persons.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.240
 I mean, he gets killed in 1968.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.560
 The five years after that speech in Washington,

08:51.560 --> 08:56.560
 he spends developing his worldview

08:57.280 --> 09:01.200
 and the things that he had to say, for example,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.980
 about the war in Southeast Asia that was going on

09:03.980 --> 09:08.980
 at that time made appeals to universal principles

09:10.600 --> 09:11.440
 of equality.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.760
 He was a pacifist to some degree.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.640
 He was against war.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.680
 He was a socialist to some degree.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.000
 He might not have worn that label publicly,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.060
 but he believed in a decent society

09:25.060 --> 09:27.760
 where the poor would not go untended,

09:27.760 --> 09:30.860
 where healthcare would be available to people who needed it

09:30.860 --> 09:32.640
 and this kind of thing.

09:32.640 --> 09:37.040
 A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life

09:37.040 --> 09:40.300
 was not dependent upon the color of the skin,

09:40.300 --> 09:43.900
 upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken,

09:44.760 --> 09:46.920
 upon whether male or female.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.040
 All persons are created equal.

09:50.040 --> 09:55.040
 This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King,

09:55.240 --> 09:56.860
 on my understanding.

09:56.860 --> 10:01.440
 Broadly speaking, what do you learn about human nature

10:01.440 --> 10:05.320
 by looking at the history of slavery in America?

10:07.560 --> 10:08.400
 Oh my.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.640
 So what does that tell you about people?

10:10.640 --> 10:14.160
 Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head.

10:15.080 --> 10:20.080
 One is about the capacity of people

10:22.480 --> 10:27.480
 for looking the other way in the face of

10:27.480 --> 10:32.480
 unethical and morally profoundly problematic practice.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.000
 So, I mean, slavery was controversial.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.680
 It was controversial going all the way back

10:42.680 --> 10:44.720
 to the founding of the United States of America.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.840
 The country was founded on a compromise

10:47.840 --> 10:52.840
 where half of the country thought that slavery was abhorrent

10:52.840 --> 10:57.840
 and would not have had it countenanced in the Constitution.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.120
 The other half of the country were steeped

11:02.120 --> 11:07.120
 in the dependence on the labor of these African captives

11:07.160 --> 11:08.740
 and their descendants.

11:08.740 --> 11:10.440
 The economy depended upon it.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.760
 They owned them as property.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.760
 That was their wealth.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.660
 Their wealth was invested to some degree

11:14.660 --> 11:17.680
 in the value of these human beings.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.440
 And in order for the United States to come together

11:20.440 --> 11:24.220
 as a confederation of the several colonies,

11:24.220 --> 11:25.940
 there had to be a compromise made.

11:25.940 --> 11:30.280
 And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist

11:31.480 --> 11:35.500
 and the people who were against it

11:35.500 --> 11:38.880
 or who thought it morally problematic

11:38.880 --> 11:42.120
 were able to countenance the practice

11:42.120 --> 11:45.540
 in the Southern states where slavery flourished.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.500
 And that went on for 75 years

11:47.500 --> 11:49.640
 after the founding of the country

11:49.640 --> 11:53.320
 until the crisis of the late 1850s

11:53.320 --> 11:55.240
 that led to the Civil War

11:55.240 --> 11:56.920
 and ultimately to the emancipation.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.200
 So one thing I think about human nature

12:00.200 --> 12:05.200
 from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people

12:05.680 --> 12:10.680
 to live with terrible, morally questionable practices

12:11.440 --> 12:14.360
 and have that as a part of their institutions.

12:14.360 --> 12:19.360
 It took a movement, a massive movement of abolitionists

12:20.360 --> 12:24.880
 struggling against slavery for the better part of a century

12:24.880 --> 12:29.880
 before that practice could be eradicated.

12:29.880 --> 12:34.400
 But the other thing about human nature that I see

12:34.400 --> 12:39.280
 is the ability of people to sustain their humanity

12:39.280 --> 12:44.280
 under the most awful, oppressive conditions.

12:44.880 --> 12:49.800
 The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.480
 I mean, they were chattel,

12:51.480 --> 12:55.180
 they were bought and sold like horses or cattle.

12:56.320 --> 13:01.320
 And yet their humanity was not destroyed by that.

13:01.920 --> 13:06.920
 And they were able to sustain their dignity to some degree

13:06.920 --> 13:11.160
 in such a manner that once emancipation finally did arrive,

13:11.160 --> 13:16.160
 the freedmen and women, the persons who had been enslaved

13:16.160 --> 13:21.160
 and who were set free were able to over the following decades

13:25.800 --> 13:30.800
 build a foundation for the development of African Americans

13:30.800 --> 13:34.040
 within the context of American society

13:34.040 --> 13:39.040
 that eventually culminated in the civil rights movement

13:39.400 --> 13:41.900
 of the middle of the 20th century

13:41.900 --> 13:44.820
 and has led us into the present day.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.720
 So, you know, human nature can countenance awful evil

13:53.340 --> 13:55.560
 but human nature can also survive

13:55.560 --> 13:58.240
 in the face of terrible evil.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.320
 That's what I take from slavery.

14:00.320 --> 14:05.320
 That survival, that flame can burn even when the world

14:05.960 --> 14:07.960
 around it tries to put it out.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.640
 There's still a little flame of human consciousness,

14:11.640 --> 14:16.560
 of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is

14:16.560 --> 14:19.640
 that makes humans flourish and makes humans beautiful

14:19.640 --> 14:21.080
 that lives on.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.000
 That's very well said.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.980
 Yeah, I think you put it very well.

14:23.980 --> 14:28.060
 There's gotta be some poetic way of expressing that.

14:28.060 --> 14:28.900
 Oh.

14:29.740 --> 14:30.860
 Leave it to the poets.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.420
 What about the people that look the other way?

14:34.420 --> 14:37.980
 How many people do you think, just regular people,

14:37.980 --> 14:40.740
 knew that something is, this is wrong?

14:40.740 --> 14:44.700
 Or do people through generations convince themselves,

14:44.700 --> 14:46.820
 most people, most regular people,

14:46.820 --> 14:49.540
 convince themselves that there's nothing wrong?

14:52.540 --> 14:53.620
 Yeah.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.700
 I ask this question because I wonder

14:55.700 --> 14:59.780
 what we're looking the other way on today also.

14:59.780 --> 15:04.780
 Because you have to ask yourself these difficult questions

15:05.260 --> 15:10.260
 of assuming we're the same people we were back then

15:10.860 --> 15:14.180
 then we can be flawed in that same kind of way.

15:14.180 --> 15:18.480
 We can look the other way just as others have in history.

15:20.100 --> 15:24.060
 Yeah, you spoke of the European context

15:24.060 --> 15:28.820
 and of the Nazis and certainly a lot of people

15:28.820 --> 15:33.020
 had to be looking the other way when the massive crimes

15:33.020 --> 15:36.060
 that were committed by that regime were being undertaken.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.940
 I mean, railroad cars full of human beings

15:39.940 --> 15:43.620
 being taken off to be slaughtered or to be worked to death

15:43.620 --> 15:48.180
 in labor camps or to be gassed, et cetera.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.760
 A lot of people had to know about what was going on

15:50.760 --> 15:55.760
 and look the other way or enthusiastically supported

15:55.900 --> 16:00.900
 the persecution of the Jews and the gypsies and so on.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.860
 And I don't know, I wasn't around in 1840.

16:05.860 --> 16:09.980
 My sense of the matter is that like many practices

16:09.980 --> 16:12.660
 that are unjust, most people thought

16:12.660 --> 16:14.060
 that's just the way it is.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.580
 I mean, that's the world that they inherited.

16:16.580 --> 16:20.260
 They were not moralists, they were not revolutionaries.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.980
 They just wanted to go along.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.680
 Some people might've been troubled by it

16:24.680 --> 16:26.460
 but thought there's nothing that can be done.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.340
 Some people might've thought, well,

16:28.340 --> 16:32.780
 they're these black Africans, they're not really like us

16:32.780 --> 16:35.160
 and they are lucky to be here.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.460
 If they were in Africa, they'd be worse off still.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.820
 Some people might've thought that.

16:40.820 --> 16:42.220
 Some people might've been disturbed

16:42.220 --> 16:44.940
 but not been able to see what it is

16:44.940 --> 16:46.380
 that they could do about it.

16:46.380 --> 16:51.380
 They might've thought, oh, this is disgusting.

16:51.460 --> 16:56.180
 This is not something I would wanna have anything to do with

16:56.180 --> 17:01.180
 but not knowing whether there's any practical way

17:01.540 --> 17:05.540
 of opposing it, that's why you need a movement.

17:05.540 --> 17:10.540
 You need for the people who are troubled by the practice

17:10.620 --> 17:12.980
 to know that there are others like themselves

17:12.980 --> 17:16.820
 equally troubled and as they gather together,

17:16.820 --> 17:20.740
 collectively, they can exert their influence.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.580
 I mean, debates about the wrongness of slavery,

17:24.580 --> 17:28.580
 as I say, go all the way back to the founding of the country.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.740
 There were abolitionists and there were people

17:30.740 --> 17:35.740
 who opposed the compromise that led to the framing documents

17:36.940 --> 17:40.780
 and institutions that created the United States of America,

17:40.780 --> 17:45.780
 opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation.

17:47.540 --> 17:52.260
 But it took a while before that could come to a head

17:52.260 --> 17:56.660
 and produce the crisis which ultimately led

17:56.660 --> 17:59.480
 to the eradication of slavery.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.480
 I would note that slavery is not unique to the United States.

18:05.380 --> 18:08.560
 It's not unique to the Western Hemisphere.

18:08.560 --> 18:13.220
 The enslavement of people, the trafficking in human chattel

18:14.380 --> 18:18.100
 is something that one sees on a global basis,

18:18.100 --> 18:22.200
 one sees it going all the way back to antiquity.

18:22.200 --> 18:26.860
 So we might ask, how is it that people finally came

18:26.860 --> 18:30.260
 to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?

18:30.260 --> 18:33.860
 That might be the thing worth really trying to understand

18:33.860 --> 18:36.060
 because the practice itself is,

18:36.060 --> 18:40.540
 there's a wonderful book by the sociologist

18:40.540 --> 18:45.540
 Orlando Patterson called Slavery and Social Death

18:46.100 --> 18:51.100
 that was published in 1982, which is a comprehensive history

18:51.940 --> 18:55.700
 and social analysis of the institution of slavery

18:55.700 --> 19:00.700
 over 2,500 years, going back to the classical Greek

19:00.700 --> 19:05.700
 and Roman civilizations, finding slavery in Africa

19:06.500 --> 19:09.980
 amongst Africans, finding slavery in the Middle East,

19:09.980 --> 19:11.800
 finding slavery in the Far East,

19:11.800 --> 19:16.580
 finding slavery in South Asia, the enslavement of people,

19:16.580 --> 19:19.640
 the practice of taking someone as a captive in war

19:19.640 --> 19:22.500
 and then instead of killing them, which you could do,

19:22.500 --> 19:27.500
 making them into your property was very, very widespread

19:27.500 --> 19:30.580
 in human culture.

19:30.580 --> 19:33.340
 So I mean, I'd like to make this point sometimes

19:33.340 --> 19:36.420
 when people are talking about how wrong slavery was

19:36.420 --> 19:38.700
 and I agree without any question

19:40.020 --> 19:44.540
 that the practice was profoundly morally problematic,

19:46.380 --> 19:50.400
 but I'd like to make the point that given how wrong it was,

19:50.400 --> 19:55.400
 think about how impressive was the accomplishment

19:55.400 --> 19:58.080
 of the eradication of slavery.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.520
 Now, that was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead

20:01.520 --> 20:06.180
 in the war between the states, 1861 to 1865

20:06.180 --> 20:08.300
 in a country of 30 million people.

20:08.300 --> 20:13.300
 That's a lot of dead people who gave their lives

20:13.920 --> 20:16.760
 not to eradicate slavery in every instance,

20:16.760 --> 20:20.040
 probably most of them were just fighting for,

20:21.360 --> 20:25.280
 they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces

20:25.280 --> 20:27.160
 and they fought and they died,

20:27.160 --> 20:30.520
 but the net effect of their having fought and died

20:30.520 --> 20:32.960
 was to push along a process

20:32.960 --> 20:34.880
 that led to the eradication of slavery.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.840
 That's an amazing achievement.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.840
 The slaves themselves were largely uneducated

20:43.840 --> 20:47.080
 and backward in their,

20:47.080 --> 20:48.800
 of course, what else could they have been?

20:48.800 --> 20:50.780
 They were kept in captivity,

20:50.780 --> 20:55.040
 they were prevented from developing their human potential

20:55.040 --> 20:58.720
 and yet after the end of slavery,

20:58.720 --> 21:03.320
 that population, that 4 million plus African descended people

21:04.440 --> 21:08.120
 became the foundation for what a century later

21:08.120 --> 21:12.600
 leads to Martin Luther King standing in the Washington Mall

21:12.600 --> 21:14.440
 and giving that great speech

21:14.440 --> 21:18.280
 and now here we are 150 years down the road

21:18.280 --> 21:21.600
 and Barack Obama is president of the United States.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.260
 Now, he did not descend from slaves,

21:23.260 --> 21:25.640
 I think we must not lose track of that,

21:25.640 --> 21:29.280
 but he identified as an African American

21:29.280 --> 21:32.560
 and was a part of the population

21:32.560 --> 21:35.840
 that consisted largely of people who descended from slaves

21:36.880 --> 21:40.880
 and we are, we African Americans are

21:40.880 --> 21:42.960
 for all practical purposes,

21:42.960 --> 21:46.720
 fully equal citizens of this great republic.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.400
 That has happened within a century and a half

21:49.400 --> 21:52.200
 and I don't know that you can find any parallel

21:52.200 --> 21:55.900
 to that kind of transformation in the status of people

21:56.800 --> 22:01.800
 from human chattel to full citizens of the republic.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.920
 Anywhere in human history,

22:02.920 --> 22:07.240
 it's certainly worth celebrating the achievement

22:07.240 --> 22:10.160
 of the eradication of slavery, I would say.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.360
 And it probably started with a few people

22:14.560 --> 22:18.880
 that inside their mind dared to rebel.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.200
 You know, it's interesting to think about how it all started,

22:23.320 --> 22:26.920
 how in the state of injustice,

22:26.920 --> 22:31.920
 the revolution percolates, like where it starts.

22:32.820 --> 22:36.560
 You said people that see something is wrong find each other.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.000
 It's in the ideas of charismatic individuals

22:43.000 --> 22:44.920
 that not only know that something is wrong,

22:44.920 --> 22:49.920
 but are able to tell others about it and be convincing

22:51.680 --> 22:54.760
 and then together gather and rise up.

22:54.760 --> 22:58.320
 It's interesting to make this kind of incredible progress

22:58.320 --> 23:00.440
 from slavery to where we are today

23:00.440 --> 23:04.300
 to live out the ideal of this all men are created equal.

23:06.160 --> 23:06.980
 Yeah.

23:06.980 --> 23:07.820
 The power of individual,

23:07.820 --> 23:10.020
 because I don't know what you think about it,

23:10.020 --> 23:14.600
 but I tend to think that a few small individuals

23:14.600 --> 23:16.320
 probably originated this.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.280
 Like it's the power of the individual,

23:18.280 --> 23:20.320
 because sometimes we think there's injustice in the world,

23:20.320 --> 23:22.160
 what can I possibly do?

23:22.160 --> 23:26.400
 But I tend to think one person can be the seed

23:26.400 --> 23:29.200
 of starting to fix the injustice.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.040
 Sure.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.280
 One person here, one person there.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.200
 Yeah.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.960
 One thinks of course of Frederick Douglass,

23:38.960 --> 23:43.960
 this massively significant figure who was born in slavery,

23:46.200 --> 23:51.200
 who stole his freedom because he was property

23:52.240 --> 23:54.720
 and he decided he was not gonna be property anymore

23:54.720 --> 23:59.040
 and he took it unto himself to emancipate himself personally

23:59.040 --> 24:04.040
 and who became an educated, a powerfully articulate,

24:04.040 --> 24:09.040
 massively influential person in the United States

24:09.400 --> 24:14.400
 and in England going around presenting himself

24:14.880 --> 24:18.800
 as an embodiment of human dignity

24:18.800 --> 24:23.800
 and commitment to ideals of equality.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.680
 And I mean, he's just one person,

24:27.680 --> 24:30.200
 but there were others like him.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.960
 Just one person.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.560
 All it takes is just one person.

24:33.560 --> 24:38.560
 So here we are on this topic of equality

24:39.600 --> 24:43.000
 in the 21st century.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.400
 So what does equality mean today?

24:45.400 --> 24:50.400
 If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome

24:53.480 --> 24:56.720
 or the injustice of inequality,

24:56.720 --> 25:01.040
 at which point does equality of outcome is just,

25:01.040 --> 25:03.640
 at which point is it unjust?

25:03.640 --> 25:05.640
 Sort of looking at our world today

25:05.640 --> 25:07.680
 and looking at inequality,

25:08.840 --> 25:13.840
 how do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice

25:14.320 --> 25:16.520
 and some is the way of life?

25:16.520 --> 25:19.640
 So what does equality mean when we look at the world today,

25:19.640 --> 25:23.320
 different from Dr. King's speech of the basic humanity?

25:23.320 --> 25:27.800
 I don't think King's speech, I have a dream

25:27.800 --> 25:29.960
 that one day my four little children will be judged

25:29.960 --> 25:31.400
 not by the color of their skin,

25:31.400 --> 25:33.320
 but by the content of their character

25:34.440 --> 25:37.440
 requires equality of outcome.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.080
 He says his children will be judged

25:42.080 --> 25:44.600
 by the content of their character.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.560
 That's a conditional statement.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.840
 That is the judgment will depend upon the content

25:49.840 --> 25:54.040
 of their character, not the color of their skin,

25:54.040 --> 25:56.800
 but it doesn't follow from that,

25:56.800 --> 26:01.560
 that the outcomes, whatever outcomes we consider wealth

26:01.560 --> 26:03.120
 and economic power,

26:05.320 --> 26:06.920
 position within the society,

26:06.920 --> 26:10.240
 representation in the various professions,

26:10.240 --> 26:13.000
 the various measures of social achievement

26:13.000 --> 26:17.320
 doesn't follow from judging by the content of character

26:17.320 --> 26:19.080
 and not color of skin,

26:19.080 --> 26:21.400
 that when we look at the end of the day

26:21.400 --> 26:24.120
 at the social outcomes that they will be equal

26:24.120 --> 26:27.040
 across the different groups.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.680
 In fact, I think there's a contradiction in the idea

26:29.680 --> 26:31.840
 that groups will be equal

26:31.840 --> 26:34.040
 in all of the various social outcomes,

26:34.040 --> 26:36.960
 that they will be equally successful in business,

26:36.960 --> 26:40.760
 that they will be proportionately represented

26:40.760 --> 26:42.240
 in the various professions,

26:42.240 --> 26:45.760
 that they will have the same educational achievement,

26:45.760 --> 26:49.760
 that the occupational profiles will look the same.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.080
 If they are, in fact, distinct groups

26:53.080 --> 26:57.080
 with their own cultural traditions and practices,

26:58.160 --> 27:00.840
 with their own ideals and norms,

27:01.840 --> 27:04.240
 various immigrant populations,

27:04.240 --> 27:06.480
 people coming to the United States of America

27:06.480 --> 27:09.880
 from all corners of the world,

27:09.880 --> 27:13.000
 the descendants of the African slaves,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.600
 the black Americans here today,

27:15.600 --> 27:19.520
 who are ourselves various with different backgrounds,

27:19.520 --> 27:21.960
 different origins and so on,

27:21.960 --> 27:25.320
 the different religious practices and commitments

27:25.320 --> 27:30.320
 that Jewish or Mormon or Christian or whatever,

27:32.760 --> 27:37.600
 however we parcel up the total population

27:37.600 --> 27:38.760
 into the various groups,

27:38.760 --> 27:42.800
 these groups are themselves different from one another.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.240
 They have different norms

27:45.240 --> 27:48.520
 within their own cultural practice.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.760
 How would we expect,

27:49.760 --> 27:51.480
 if in fact we recognize

27:51.480 --> 27:54.400
 that the groups are different from one another,

27:54.400 --> 27:56.720
 that in a world that is fair,

27:56.720 --> 28:00.040
 they would all come out equally represented

28:00.040 --> 28:00.960
 in every undertaking.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.320
 They're not equally represented,

28:03.320 --> 28:06.240
 and that fact, I'm arguing,

28:06.240 --> 28:09.000
 is in and of itself insufficient

28:09.000 --> 28:11.360
 to justify the conclusion

28:11.360 --> 28:15.240
 that they're not somehow being fairly treated.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.640
 Fair treatment doesn't imply equal outcomes

28:18.640 --> 28:21.560
 in a world in which the populations in question

28:21.560 --> 28:23.320
 are themselves different

28:23.320 --> 28:25.440
 with respect to their culture, their practices,

28:25.440 --> 28:27.640
 their norms, their traditions,

28:27.640 --> 28:31.360
 their beliefs, their ideals, and so on.

28:31.360 --> 28:35.200
 The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs,

28:35.200 --> 28:37.200
 cultural orientations, and ideals

28:37.200 --> 28:40.000
 will have consequences

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
 in terms of their different social outcomes.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.160
 So I just think it's a mistake

28:46.160 --> 28:47.800
 that people are making

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
 when they think

28:49.920 --> 28:51.960
 fairness of treatment

28:53.520 --> 28:56.000
 implies equality of outcomes.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.480
 It does not.

28:57.480 --> 29:01.240
 Is the process by which we're speaking now

29:02.600 --> 29:06.320
 in the midst of the National Basketball Association's

29:06.320 --> 29:07.680
 playoffs,

29:07.680 --> 29:10.440
 I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.560
 I mean, I'm just,

29:12.560 --> 29:16.040
 it's a very good team, and I'm excited about my Celtics.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.080
 We defeated

29:18.240 --> 29:20.120
 the Brooklyn

29:21.160 --> 29:22.440
 Nets.

29:22.440 --> 29:25.480
 I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant

29:25.480 --> 29:28.800
 and Kyrie Irving and company, okay,

29:28.800 --> 29:31.240
 in a playoff series.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.720
 We whipped them,

29:32.720 --> 29:34.680
 and we're on our way to

29:35.840 --> 29:37.840
 the Eastern Conference Finals,

29:37.840 --> 29:39.800
 and we're on our way to the NBA Finals,

29:39.800 --> 29:42.520
 and I'm, you know, if I were a betting man,

29:42.520 --> 29:44.560
 I'd put down a few bucks

29:44.560 --> 29:47.600
 that the Boston Celtics, underrated as we are,

29:47.600 --> 29:50.680
 have a very good chance of winning the NBA Finals.

29:50.680 --> 29:51.840
 Okay, so that's the NBA.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.560
 That's the National Basketball Association.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.400
 I'm a sports fan.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.240
 I like basketball.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.640
 Slightly biased prediction, but yes.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.640
 Yeah, it is somewhat biased.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.280
 All I'm saying is,

30:01.280 --> 30:04.520
 if you take a look at who the star players are

30:04.520 --> 30:06.160
 in the National Basketball Association,

30:06.160 --> 30:09.480
 you're gonna find that there's some Eastern Europeans.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.840
 You know, there's some really good basketball players

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
 coming out of Eastern Europe,

30:15.160 --> 30:17.080
 and more power to them,

30:17.080 --> 30:19.760
 and there are a lot of African Americans.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.840
 We're overrepresented.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.480
 There are not that many Jews, as far as I know.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.480
 No offense intended there, Lex,

30:26.480 --> 30:27.320
 but I mean,

30:28.280 --> 30:31.040
 the NBA is not

30:32.200 --> 30:34.120
 equally representative

30:34.120 --> 30:37.480
 of all of the different populations in the United States.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.120
 Now, we could go into the reasons why,

30:39.120 --> 30:41.400
 but I'm just saying the process

30:41.400 --> 30:44.600
 by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.360
 If you can play, you can get on the court.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.240
 All they're looking for is people who can play.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.040
 I think something like that is true

30:54.320 --> 30:56.080
 in many different venues.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.080
 I expect, if you're a really good technical engineer,

31:01.680 --> 31:03.160
 companies are gonna employ you,

31:04.200 --> 31:07.320
 and if you can make money, they're gonna advance you,

31:07.320 --> 31:12.240
 and you will be able to rise to the top of that profession.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.400
 I expect that the people who are engaged

31:15.400 --> 31:17.040
 in financial transactions,

31:17.040 --> 31:20.120
 who are actually making bets on the market,

31:20.120 --> 31:24.200
 by and large, are the people who are good at that activity,

31:24.200 --> 31:26.200
 and if you're good at that activity in this world,

31:26.200 --> 31:27.960
 in this modern world,

31:27.960 --> 31:31.680
 you're gonna rise to the top.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.680
 I'm not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.520
 Of course, there are of many different sorts,

31:40.520 --> 31:43.560
 but I'm saying that to expect that there would be,

31:43.560 --> 31:46.240
 okay, I mean, let's look at who's actually writing code.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.440
 Let's look at who's actually trading bonds.

31:48.440 --> 31:53.440
 Let's look at who's actually starting businesses and so on.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.120
 To say that in a fair world,

31:57.120 --> 31:59.960
 I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population,

31:59.960 --> 32:02.360
 they'd be 10% of every one of those things,

32:02.360 --> 32:06.640
 is to ignore the reality that the differences

32:06.640 --> 32:09.840
 in the culture and practices and norms

32:09.840 --> 32:11.600
 of the various population groups

32:11.600 --> 32:14.840
 will lead to differences in their representation

32:14.840 --> 32:17.080
 amongst people who are outstanding performers

32:17.080 --> 32:20.080
 in one or another activity.

32:20.080 --> 32:24.040
 How do you know if the difference in culture

32:24.040 --> 32:26.920
 accounts for the difference in outcomes,

32:26.920 --> 32:30.120
 or it's the existence of barriers,

32:30.120 --> 32:32.960
 especially barriers early on in life,

32:32.960 --> 32:35.280
 of discrimination that are racially based?

32:35.280 --> 32:38.120
 So if you think about affirmative action,

32:41.040 --> 32:44.840
 in which ways is affirmative action empowering,

32:44.840 --> 32:47.480
 in which way is it limiting

32:47.480 --> 32:50.800
 for these early development of different groups,

32:50.800 --> 32:53.080
 but let's just speak to African Americans.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.280
 We should say that you went to some no name

32:56.280 --> 32:57.720
 Northwestern University at first,

32:57.720 --> 33:00.480
 but then you ended up with the great university of MIT.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.840
 So that's your, not early, but middle development.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.040
 So speaking of the development,

33:09.040 --> 33:13.240
 the opportunities, the equality of opportunity,

33:13.240 --> 33:15.680
 how do we know we got that equality right?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.360
 Yeah, I'm glad you put it like that.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.640
 We were talking about results,

33:20.640 --> 33:22.120
 now we're talking about opportunity.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.920
 I was taking the position that

33:23.920 --> 33:28.920
 when King says, I have a dream and he envisions a world

33:29.560 --> 33:32.320
 where his children will not be barred

33:32.320 --> 33:34.920
 from the good things in life

33:34.920 --> 33:37.040
 because of the color of their skin,

33:37.040 --> 33:42.040
 we're talking about opportunity, not about results.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.360
 But opportunity is not just something

33:45.360 --> 33:48.680
 that depends upon what the law is

33:48.680 --> 33:50.000
 and what public policies are.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.760
 Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions

33:54.760 --> 33:56.880
 in which people are raised,

33:56.880 --> 33:58.360
 the social and economic conditions.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.360
 So the child of a poor family that has no resources,

34:04.680 --> 34:06.440
 it doesn't have the same opportunity

34:06.440 --> 34:08.680
 as a child of a wealthy family

34:08.680 --> 34:11.720
 to realize their full human potential.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.240
 You asked me, how can we tell whether or not

34:14.240 --> 34:19.080
 a difference in outcomes is a reflection

34:19.080 --> 34:21.120
 of unequal opportunity,

34:21.120 --> 34:23.520
 or it's a reflection of differences in culture

34:23.520 --> 34:26.680
 and interest and practice?

34:26.680 --> 34:29.600
 And I don't know that there's a single answer

34:29.600 --> 34:30.440
 to that question,

34:30.440 --> 34:33.440
 but I think one wants to look at the data,

34:33.440 --> 34:36.600
 one wants to try to measure.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.560
 As a social scientist, I would say what you wanna do

34:40.560 --> 34:45.560
 is you wanna estimate the significance of various factors

34:47.240 --> 34:48.480
 for determining the outcome.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.840
 If the outcome is how much money does a person make

34:51.840 --> 34:53.720
 when they work in the labor market?

34:53.720 --> 34:56.640
 So you look at their wages and you think,

34:56.640 --> 34:58.640
 well, that depends upon a number of things.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.920
 It depends upon how educated they are,

35:00.920 --> 35:02.920
 what kind of skills they have,

35:02.920 --> 35:06.960
 what kind of work experience they have, and so on.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.840
 And those things are all legitimate factors

35:11.240 --> 35:13.840
 that might determine how much they end up making

35:13.840 --> 35:15.680
 in the labor market.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.680
 But you also wanna perhaps, controlling for those things,

35:19.680 --> 35:23.280
 see whether or not the fact that they are black

35:23.280 --> 35:25.720
 or they are Latino or whatever,

35:25.720 --> 35:29.320
 fact that they are male or that they are female,

35:29.320 --> 35:31.880
 the fact that they do or do not speak English

35:31.880 --> 35:34.440
 as their native language, this kind of thing,

35:34.440 --> 35:38.680
 whether those factors also are implicated

35:38.680 --> 35:42.320
 in determining how successful they are in the labor market.

35:42.320 --> 35:46.360
 And if you find that after you have controlled

35:46.360 --> 35:51.360
 for the things that are legitimately determining success

35:51.800 --> 35:52.920
 and failure in the labor market,

35:52.920 --> 35:56.480
 like skills and education and experience,

35:56.480 --> 35:58.640
 having controlled for those things,

35:58.640 --> 36:01.640
 the fact that a person is black or is a woman

36:01.640 --> 36:06.640
 or is an immigrant or is of Latino background

36:09.440 --> 36:11.680
 also affects their earnings,

36:11.680 --> 36:14.440
 then you might conclude that to that extent,

36:14.440 --> 36:16.720
 they're not getting equal opportunity in the labor market,

36:16.720 --> 36:17.800
 that kind of idea.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.160
 But I wanna focus a little bit more here

36:22.160 --> 36:23.760
 on what we mean by opportunity

36:23.760 --> 36:28.760
 because it's not just whether employers treat the worker

36:29.840 --> 36:33.160
 on a fair and even basis,

36:33.160 --> 36:36.760
 irregardless of the worker's racial or ethnic background.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.560
 That's one opportunity issue,

36:39.560 --> 36:43.720
 but that's at the end of the development process.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.800
 They are now presenting themselves to the market,

36:46.800 --> 36:50.880
 trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.760
 That's the end of the line.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.960
 What about the developmental opportunity,

36:54.960 --> 36:58.760
 the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place?

36:58.760 --> 37:00.200
 That goes all the way back,

37:00.200 --> 37:01.560
 that goes all the way back to birth.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.480
 It even goes back to before birth.

37:03.480 --> 37:08.480
 Or the mother carrying the infant in the womb,

37:10.520 --> 37:15.320
 she has certain nutritional practices

37:15.320 --> 37:18.360
 as she might be smoking or drinking alcohol

37:18.360 --> 37:19.200
 or something like that.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.840
 I'm not saying she is, I'm not saying she isn't,

37:20.840 --> 37:23.360
 I'm just saying whether she is or she isn't

37:23.360 --> 37:27.080
 that will affect the development of the fetus.

37:27.080 --> 37:32.000
 The newborn, now there's a question of environment.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.680
 There's a question of the development

37:33.680 --> 37:37.800
 of their neurological potential.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.200
 Do they learn how to read?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.360
 Are they stimulated verbally?

37:42.360 --> 37:44.360
 How many words have they heard spoken?

37:45.320 --> 37:49.680
 Are they being nurtured in a home environment

37:49.680 --> 37:52.760
 so as to maximize the possibility

37:52.760 --> 37:55.160
 of them achieving their human potential?

37:55.160 --> 37:57.920
 What about the peer group influences?

37:57.920 --> 38:02.400
 What about the values and norms of the surrounding

38:03.600 --> 38:05.920
 human communities in which they're embedded?

38:05.920 --> 38:08.560
 Do they encourage the young person

38:08.560 --> 38:13.320
 to apply themselves in a systematic way

38:13.320 --> 38:15.920
 to their studies and to their focus

38:15.920 --> 38:18.880
 on their acquisition of language command

38:18.880 --> 38:21.480
 and of their educational potential?

38:22.520 --> 38:25.560
 So development is not only something

38:25.560 --> 38:29.760
 that is controlled by the society's practices,

38:29.760 --> 38:32.280
 it's also something that is influenced

38:32.280 --> 38:37.000
 by the cultural background of the individual.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.280
 And those things are not equal.

38:40.280 --> 38:45.280
 Those things vary across groups in a very significant way.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.280
 And that too will be a factor

38:50.280 --> 38:53.480
 determining disparities of outcome.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.000
 So when I see outcomes that are different,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.720
 I see wealth holding that's different.

38:58.720 --> 39:01.000
 I see educational achievement that's different.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.720
 I see representation in the professional schools

39:03.720 --> 39:05.040
 and law school and medical school

39:05.040 --> 39:06.800
 that's different between groups.

39:06.800 --> 39:11.000
 One question is are the institutions treating people fairly?

39:11.000 --> 39:15.240
 But another question is do the background

39:15.240 --> 39:17.240
 in social and cultural influences

39:17.240 --> 39:20.640
 equip people in the same way?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.400
 And we know that the answer to that,

39:22.400 --> 39:25.840
 not in every instance do they equip people in the same way.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.320
 And so it makes the judgment, the moral judgment

39:28.320 --> 39:32.600
 that we make when we see inequality of outcome complicated.

39:34.040 --> 39:39.040
 Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree,

39:39.080 --> 39:43.880
 but it is also a cultural factor to some degree,

39:43.880 --> 39:46.760
 I wanna say, and that's controversial, I know.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.200
 A lot of people, they think of themselves

39:50.200 --> 39:51.360
 as being progressive.

39:51.360 --> 39:55.200
 They wanna point a finger at society

39:55.200 --> 39:57.040
 whenever they see a disparity.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.120
 But I think that that's a mistake.

40:00.120 --> 40:05.120
 I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.560
 You think that if you get the right law,

40:08.560 --> 40:11.040
 if you have the right public policy,

40:11.040 --> 40:13.480
 if the right politicians are elected to office,

40:13.480 --> 40:16.040
 suddenly those disparities will go away.

40:16.040 --> 40:21.040
 And I'm here to tell you that that's a false hope.

40:22.240 --> 40:26.160
 And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.880
 But I mean, we could go into that.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.440
 You were talking about affirmative action,

40:30.440 --> 40:33.520
 which is something else altogether.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.800
 And you were talking about me and my education,

40:35.800 --> 40:39.280
 which is also something that's a little bit different.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.040
 And I'm happy to talk about those things.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.520
 Northwestern University, by the way, was a great university.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.080
 I'm just joking, it's one of the great universities

40:47.080 --> 40:48.040
 of the world, yes.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.120
 And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University,

40:51.120 --> 40:54.000
 which is how I ended up at MIT in the first place.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.080
 And I got a very good technical training in mathematics

40:58.080 --> 41:00.000
 when I was at Northwestern, so.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.560
 You love both mathematics and human nature.

41:03.560 --> 41:08.320
 And so, which is why you ended up going into economics

41:08.320 --> 41:11.920
 at one of the great economics programs in the world at MIT

41:11.920 --> 41:13.040
 and getting your PhD there.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.280
 So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist,

41:16.280 --> 41:19.880
 which allows you to think systematically and rigorously

41:19.880 --> 41:23.000
 about the way the world and the way humans work at scale.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.720
 Trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans,

41:28.720 --> 41:32.400
 like a psychology perspective, economics allows you to do.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.800
 Well, economics is one of the social sciences.

41:35.800 --> 41:39.320
 I think there's value in psychology and in sociology.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.000
 There's a lot to know that doesn't come up

41:42.000 --> 41:44.080
 within the study of economics.

41:44.080 --> 41:49.080
 We study markets and the dynamics of economic development

41:49.280 --> 41:54.280
 and trade and so on.

41:54.400 --> 41:59.200
 But yeah, speaking personally, as I was coming along,

41:59.200 --> 42:01.160
 I was fascinated by mathematics.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.600
 I was good at it and ended up at Northwestern

42:04.600 --> 42:09.600
 and took a lot of courses there in functional analysis

42:09.600 --> 42:14.480
 and logic and mathematics and dynamical systems

42:14.480 --> 42:18.280
 and stuff that I ended up employing

42:18.280 --> 42:20.920
 in my graduate studies in economics.

42:20.920 --> 42:25.680
 But you're right, I was not satisfied simply

42:25.680 --> 42:27.560
 to be proving theorems.

42:27.560 --> 42:32.160
 I wanted to be addressing issues of social significance

42:32.160 --> 42:33.720
 and economics.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.960
 I discovered to my delight was a field of study

42:37.960 --> 42:41.480
 that allowed me both to develop

42:41.480 --> 42:45.320
 rigorous analytical frameworks,

42:45.320 --> 42:50.320
 modeling and precision of logical deduction

42:52.240 --> 42:56.080
 and inference on the one hand,

42:56.080 --> 43:00.440
 satisfying my mathematical interests,

43:00.440 --> 43:01.280
 but on the other hand,

43:01.280 --> 43:03.800
 could address questions of social significance

43:03.800 --> 43:07.600
 like why does racial inequality persist?

43:07.600 --> 43:10.360
 Why are some countries prospering and growing

43:10.360 --> 43:12.880
 and others less so?

43:12.880 --> 43:16.040
 Why do the prices of raw materials fluctuate

43:16.040 --> 43:19.280
 in the way that they do over time and so on and so forth?

43:19.280 --> 43:24.280
 And I ended up falling in love with the application

43:24.280 --> 43:29.280
 of mathematical analysis to the study of social issues.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.080
 What do you use beautiful about mathematics,

43:32.080 --> 43:35.600
 about mathematical puzzles, about logic,

43:35.600 --> 43:36.800
 all those kinds of things?

43:36.800 --> 43:39.400
 Because it's still there.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.160
 The love for math is still there for you.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.280
 So is there something you could speak to?

43:43.280 --> 43:46.600
 What is the kernel, the flame of that love?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.080
 It's like magic.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.800
 I mean, you know, being able to prove something

43:52.800 --> 43:56.120
 and I mean, you know, I think of offhand,

43:56.120 --> 43:58.960
 you know, there's no largest prime number, okay?

43:58.960 --> 44:02.520
 So how would somebody know that?

44:02.520 --> 44:03.480
 Okay, what's a prime number?

44:03.480 --> 44:05.920
 So a prime number is a number that has a whole number

44:05.920 --> 44:08.720
 that has no divisor other than one.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.040
 There are no divisors of the number

44:11.040 --> 44:16.040
 that makes it a prime number, like 13 or 19 or 37,

44:16.280 --> 44:17.520
 whatever, okay.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.560
 So they're prime numbers.

44:19.560 --> 44:20.760
 There's no largest prime number.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.160
 There are infinite number of prime numbers.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.920
 There's no largest prime number, okay?

44:23.920 --> 44:24.760
 That's an idea.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.720
 You can get your mind around it in an instant.

44:26.720 --> 44:31.680
 It doesn't take a whole lot of depth to see the question.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.240
 There's no largest prime number.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.440
 I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.280
 I mean that.

44:36.280 --> 44:39.120
 Oh, they don't show up in economics except cryptography.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.320
 I understand that's important.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.160
 Yes, yes.

44:41.160 --> 44:44.480
 For code, you know, in coding stuff.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.920
 And that shows up in economics.

44:45.920 --> 44:49.560
 But in terms of models, probably not.

44:49.560 --> 44:52.720
 That's, so prime numbers are little,

44:55.080 --> 44:58.760
 you know, in abstract algebra,

44:58.760 --> 45:00.880
 it's like they show up in all these places

45:00.880 --> 45:04.200
 that are just like beautiful mathematical puzzles

45:04.200 --> 45:05.960
 that don't immediately have an application,

45:05.960 --> 45:09.040
 but somehow maybe challenge you,

45:09.040 --> 45:11.440
 and as a result, push mathematics forward.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.160
 Like Fermat's last theorem, you know,

45:14.160 --> 45:18.200
 as far as I know, no obvious real world application,

45:18.200 --> 45:19.960
 but it has challenged mathematicians

45:19.960 --> 45:21.080
 throughout the centuries.

45:21.080 --> 45:22.120
 Indeed.

45:22.120 --> 45:27.120
 And somehow indirectly progressed the field, but.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.640
 That the rational numbers are countable.

45:31.640 --> 45:34.760
 They can be put in one to one relationship

45:34.760 --> 45:37.000
 with the integers and, you know,

45:37.000 --> 45:38.800
 but that the real numbers are not countable

45:38.800 --> 45:41.080
 and there's a lot more real, quote unquote,

45:41.080 --> 45:41.920
 more real numbers.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.360
 These are orders of infinity.

45:43.360 --> 45:48.360
 This is Cantor, Georg Cantor, and all that kind of stuff.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.680
 Or Gödel's theorem, I studied this as an undergraduate,

45:52.680 --> 45:54.440
 you know, the incompleteness theorem

45:54.440 --> 45:58.040
 that there are propositions within any logical system

45:58.040 --> 46:02.600
 that's rich enough to accommodate arithmetic.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.520
 There are going to be propositions

46:04.520 --> 46:06.560
 that you can formulate that are true,

46:06.560 --> 46:09.440
 but that you cannot prove to be true.

46:10.600 --> 46:14.680
 So the idea that you could systematically develop

46:14.680 --> 46:18.200
 a logical framework for mathematical inquiry

46:19.080 --> 46:21.800
 that could demonstrate the truth or falsity

46:21.800 --> 46:26.800
 of any proposition is not a feasible goal.

46:26.800 --> 46:27.640
 A feasible goal.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.600
 This was Hilbert's project as I understand it

46:30.600 --> 46:35.280
 and Gödel showed that there was no hope ever

46:35.280 --> 46:39.120
 of being able to demonstrate the closure

46:39.120 --> 46:41.480
 of logical systems that were rich enough

46:41.480 --> 46:43.880
 to accommodate the real numbers.

46:43.880 --> 46:47.960
 They gave an existential crisis to all mathematicians

46:47.960 --> 46:50.760
 and scientists alike and humans

46:50.760 --> 46:52.480
 because maybe you can't prove everything.

46:52.480 --> 46:56.960
 I remember, you know, when I was a junior college,

46:56.960 --> 46:58.160
 a community college student

46:58.160 --> 47:00.080
 before I transferred to Northwestern

47:00.080 --> 47:04.520
 and I took a calculus course and it was a lot of fun

47:04.520 --> 47:09.440
 and it was differentiating algebraic expressions

47:09.440 --> 47:12.760
 and integrating and using trigonometric substitutions

47:12.760 --> 47:16.080
 and it was a lot of simple problem solving.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.440
 I get to Northwestern,

47:17.440 --> 47:19.920
 I take a course in differential equations.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.040
 And again, it was a lot of formulaic applying

47:23.040 --> 47:25.360
 if you get a differential equation of this structure

47:25.360 --> 47:28.240
 like if it's linear, you got exponentials, et cetera,

47:28.240 --> 47:29.800
 you can solve it.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.840
 And then I took a course that showed me, you know,

47:32.840 --> 47:35.600
 where the question was not how to solve

47:35.600 --> 47:38.560
 any particular functional expression,

47:38.560 --> 47:41.760
 but it was proving the existence of a solution

47:41.760 --> 47:45.720
 to a differential equation where it was like X dot equals

47:45.720 --> 47:49.240
 F of X and T and F is just some arbitrary function.

47:49.240 --> 47:52.400
 What do I have to assume about the function F

47:52.400 --> 47:54.680
 in order to know that there exists a solution

47:54.680 --> 47:56.960
 to the differential equation,

47:56.960 --> 48:00.800
 dx dt equals F of X and T.

48:00.800 --> 48:03.880
 And it's basically, they called it a Lipschitz condition.

48:03.880 --> 48:08.200
 It's a condition about the bounding of the slope

48:08.200 --> 48:12.320
 of the function F as a function of X that it doesn't,

48:13.600 --> 48:16.480
 that you can sort of uniformly bound the slope

48:16.480 --> 48:20.240
 on that function and then you can use a iterative process

48:20.240 --> 48:24.760
 to show that the sequence of, you know, partial solutions

48:24.760 --> 48:26.640
 to the thing converges to something that's a solution

48:26.640 --> 48:27.480
 to the real thing.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.480
 Anyway, again, I'm not gonna bore you

48:29.480 --> 48:32.960
 or pretend that I'm a mathematician, I'm not.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.080
 But what I'm saying is the difference

48:34.080 --> 48:38.520
 between a specific algebraic formula

48:38.520 --> 48:42.480
 that you can manipulate and solve on the one hand

48:42.480 --> 48:45.320
 and the abstract question of whether there exists

48:45.320 --> 48:49.680
 a solution in the general case is like a huge,

48:49.680 --> 48:53.360
 was like a huge step for me in my study of mathematics

48:53.360 --> 48:56.400
 and the techniques that you have to employ

48:56.400 --> 48:59.680
 to address these larger questions and so on.

48:59.680 --> 49:03.520
 So I, you know, when I was an undergraduate,

49:03.520 --> 49:08.440
 I took the first year PhD sequence in math analysis

49:08.440 --> 49:11.880
 at Northwestern from a brilliant mathematician

49:11.880 --> 49:16.840
 named Avner Friedman and learned about measure theory

49:16.840 --> 49:21.840
 and learned about some early functional analysis ideas

49:25.160 --> 49:28.360
 and when I saw that those ideas were being applied

49:28.360 --> 49:32.080
 by advanced study in economics, I was delighted.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.320
 I found an intellectual home.

49:34.320 --> 49:38.800
 So one of the fascinating challenges in mathematics

49:38.800 --> 49:43.160
 is to think how can you, which echoes

49:43.160 --> 49:47.200
 the challenge of economics, what are the properties

49:47.200 --> 49:52.120
 of an equation that allow you to say something profound

49:52.120 --> 49:53.720
 and say it simply?

49:53.720 --> 49:56.400
 And so the question of economics is how do you

49:56.400 --> 50:00.200
 construct a model where you can generalize nicely

50:00.200 --> 50:03.480
 and say something profound and say it simply?

50:03.480 --> 50:06.360
 So one of the questions, one of the challenges

50:06.360 --> 50:11.360
 of economics is macro versus microeconomics is,

50:13.520 --> 50:16.280
 you know, the world is made up of individuals.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.640
 So there's a connection to this, our discussion

50:18.640 --> 50:21.960
 of race and discrimination and outcomes

50:21.960 --> 50:24.240
 and all those kinds of things.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.560
 The world is made up of individuals,

50:26.560 --> 50:29.800
 but in order to say something general,

50:29.800 --> 50:34.800
 we have to construct groups in order to analyze the data.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.920
 We have to aggregate that data somehow.

50:37.920 --> 50:41.480
 We have to make an average over some set of people.

50:41.480 --> 50:46.080
 So what are the pros and cons of looking at things

50:46.080 --> 50:50.120
 like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome

50:50.120 --> 50:53.600
 based on groups versus based on individuals

50:53.600 --> 50:58.600
 and what are the groups, if there's any pros

50:58.800 --> 51:01.560
 to looking at groups that we should be looking at?

51:01.560 --> 51:04.360
 Okay, well, those are big questions.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.920
 I mean, in economics, you're right.

51:06.920 --> 51:10.440
 I mean, micro, you have an account of how individuals

51:10.440 --> 51:13.200
 make decisions about spending their money

51:13.200 --> 51:16.080
 on this consumption side and about how enterprises

51:16.080 --> 51:20.600
 make decisions about what to produce, how much of it,

51:20.600 --> 51:23.200
 what inputs to use, what techniques of production

51:23.200 --> 51:27.960
 and so on, individual firms, individual consumers,

51:27.960 --> 51:29.160
 and then you want to aggregate.

51:29.160 --> 51:32.120
 So there's a so called theory of general equilibrium

51:32.120 --> 51:37.120
 where you think supply and demand in a bunch of markets,

51:38.200 --> 51:40.960
 you think prices that move to equilibrate,

51:40.960 --> 51:43.040
 but you recognize that the price in one market

51:43.040 --> 51:44.880
 affects people's behavior in another,

51:44.880 --> 51:47.040
 the markets are interacting with each other.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.160
 You realize that the behavior of one individual

51:49.160 --> 51:53.880
 affects the supplies and available resources

51:53.880 --> 51:56.840
 and for other individuals, so they're knitted together

51:56.840 --> 52:00.000
 in some kind of systematic way.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.640
 And you want to try to demonstrate the fact

52:04.640 --> 52:07.480
 that notwithstanding all these interdependencies,

52:07.480 --> 52:12.160
 there exists a solution to the system of equations

52:12.160 --> 52:14.000
 that equates demand and supply

52:14.000 --> 52:15.360
 across all the different markets.

52:15.360 --> 52:19.120
 This is the existence of general equilibrium.

52:19.120 --> 52:22.440
 Then you want to try to say something about the properties

52:22.440 --> 52:25.520
 of an equilibrium, if it exists, is it efficient?

52:25.520 --> 52:27.600
 What do you mean by efficiency?

52:27.600 --> 52:32.000
 Well, the idea of so called Pareto efficient outcomes,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.320
 these are outcomes that cannot be uniformly improved upon,

52:35.320 --> 52:36.880
 everybody can't be made better off

52:36.880 --> 52:39.160
 by an alternative outcome.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.240
 You want to demonstrate the efficiency

52:41.240 --> 52:43.880
 of competitive equilibrium.

52:43.880 --> 52:45.240
 What do you mean by competition?

52:45.240 --> 52:46.920
 You mean that people take their actions

52:46.920 --> 52:51.760
 to do the best for themselves that they can.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.400
 Profits of firms, well being of consumers,

52:54.400 --> 52:57.640
 they try to do the best for themselves that they can,

52:59.080 --> 53:02.000
 but they do so in reference to a set of prices

53:02.000 --> 53:03.600
 that they believe they cannot control.

53:03.600 --> 53:08.320
 That's the criterion of competitive market circumstance.

53:08.320 --> 53:11.280
 So does a competitive equilibrium exist?

53:11.280 --> 53:12.760
 Do there exist a set of prices

53:12.760 --> 53:15.840
 which if everybody recognizes them as given

53:15.840 --> 53:20.800
 and responds to those prices on behalf of their own interest,

53:20.800 --> 53:24.360
 the outcome will be supply equaling demand

53:24.360 --> 53:26.360
 in all the markets where people are interacting

53:26.360 --> 53:30.080
 with one another, and that requires the use

53:30.080 --> 53:33.760
 of some concepts and topology, fixed point theorems

53:33.760 --> 53:36.040
 and whatnot that are familiar to mathematics,

53:36.040 --> 53:38.280
 not very deep mathematical results,

53:38.280 --> 53:40.520
 but important to economics.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.160
 That's all about general equilibrium and whatnot.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.080
 But you ask about groups.

53:45.080 --> 53:49.240
 By the way, amazing whirlwind summary of all of economics,

53:49.240 --> 53:51.720
 but yes, go ahead, that was great.

53:53.600 --> 53:58.160
 Markets of competition of operator efficiency anyway,

53:58.160 --> 53:59.040
 but yes, groups.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.680
 And prices. And prices.

54:01.840 --> 54:05.120
 And by the way, there are some very beautiful

54:07.480 --> 54:10.280
 formalizations of everything that I'm saying here.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.720
 You end up in vector spaces,

54:11.720 --> 54:15.800
 you end up with sets of bundles of consumption

54:15.800 --> 54:17.840
 and production, you end up with convexity,

54:17.840 --> 54:19.840
 you end up with hyperplanes,

54:19.840 --> 54:23.800
 which are in this finite dimensional vector space,

54:23.800 --> 54:28.800
 which are all of the bundles that have the same value

54:29.840 --> 54:30.680
 at a certain price.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.160
 You end up with inner products.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.280
 It's very pretty.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.760
 Yeah, but you almost forget that it's just a bunch

54:38.760 --> 54:41.320
 of humans transacting with each other.

54:43.720 --> 54:47.080
 That markets are made up of individuals.

54:47.080 --> 54:49.000
 Markets are made up of individuals.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.480
 And in order to carry out this formalization,

54:51.480 --> 54:54.560
 you have to make assumptions about the individuals.

54:54.560 --> 54:58.960
 And the end result is true in a formal sense,

54:58.960 --> 55:03.120
 but may not be true as a representation of the reality,

55:03.120 --> 55:04.600
 because it depends upon assumptions

55:04.600 --> 55:06.640
 that themselves may not hold.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.960
 But at least you know what it is that has to be true

55:10.960 --> 55:15.880
 in order for your formal framework to be relevant,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.840
 which is already a step in the right direction, I think.

55:18.840 --> 55:22.520
 I mean, the formalization is better than the intuition.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.720
 There aren't your intuition where we sit back

55:24.720 --> 55:28.440
 and we don't really know exactly what we're talking about

55:28.440 --> 55:33.000
 because we haven't pinned it down in a precise way.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.960
 I'm in favor of the formalization.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.720
 People, they think, what is mathematics

55:37.720 --> 55:39.160
 and the social sciences?

55:39.160 --> 55:40.480
 After all, we're dealing with people.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.160
 People are not automata.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.600
 I agree with that.

55:43.600 --> 55:48.240
 But the analysis of the interaction of people,

55:48.240 --> 55:53.240
 I think, to be rigorous, requires us to be specific

55:53.240 --> 55:55.120
 about what we're talking about, about markets,

55:55.120 --> 55:57.920
 about consumers, about firms, about profits,

55:57.920 --> 56:00.800
 about technology, about preferences.

56:00.800 --> 56:04.520
 And that's the language of economics.

56:06.360 --> 56:11.360
 But people's behavior depends upon what they seek in life,

56:11.360 --> 56:14.880
 depends upon their goals and their objectives.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.320
 Those things are at play.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.200
 They can be pushed this way or that.

56:20.200 --> 56:23.640
 So, I mean, nationalism,

56:23.640 --> 56:25.640
 fighting and dying for your country,

56:27.240 --> 56:31.520
 religion, sacrificing on behalf of some abstract ideal

56:31.520 --> 56:35.440
 of the good or of what is the human situation

56:35.440 --> 56:37.840
 and what is the meaning of life.

56:37.840 --> 56:40.280
 Economists have to assume that these things

56:40.280 --> 56:41.760
 are some particular thing

56:41.760 --> 56:44.880
 before they can turn the crank on their machine

56:44.880 --> 56:48.520
 to analyze the outcomes of human interaction.

56:48.520 --> 56:53.520
 And yet these things, belief in my identity,

56:53.920 --> 56:56.400
 but the things that I'm willing to sacrifice and die

56:56.400 --> 56:59.320
 for purposes of life that I affirm

56:59.320 --> 57:03.920
 and pass on to my children are important preconditions

57:03.920 --> 57:06.840
 for actually carrying out any economic analysis.

57:06.840 --> 57:11.000
 And they are subject to manipulation and to change over time.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.360
 And that's not something that economics

57:13.360 --> 57:15.280
 has a whole lot to say about.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.760
 Well, is there some general things

57:17.760 --> 57:19.800
 that are really powerful in terms of,

57:19.800 --> 57:24.240
 you said nation, religion, those are groups.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.640
 Can you group people nicely

57:26.640 --> 57:29.200
 in helping you understand human nature?

57:29.200 --> 57:33.880
 So group them into nations based on their citizenry.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.280
 That's geography, right?

57:35.280 --> 57:39.320
 The geographic location of your birth

57:39.320 --> 57:44.320
 or your long term residence, or maybe religious belief,

57:44.520 --> 57:48.480
 what religion you believe over time.

57:48.480 --> 57:49.680
 Is there groups like that?

57:49.680 --> 57:54.680
 And then race, is that useful?

57:56.000 --> 57:59.520
 What are the pros and cons of looking at outcomes

57:59.520 --> 58:04.520
 based on these kinds of groups, race in particular?

58:07.200 --> 58:09.040
 I think they're pros and I think they're cons.

58:09.040 --> 58:13.360
 I mean, I am myself, Glenn Loury sits before you right now,

58:14.440 --> 58:16.680
 a black American, an African American.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.160
 I quote unquote, I identify as,

58:19.160 --> 58:21.240
 that's the way they talk about it nowadays.

58:21.240 --> 58:22.840
 I identify as a black American.

58:22.840 --> 58:27.840
 My skin is brown, my hair is coarse, my nose is broad,

58:27.840 --> 58:31.000
 relative to the way other people's noses look.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.680
 My lips are thicker.

58:32.680 --> 58:37.680
 That's a consequence of my ancestral descent

58:37.760 --> 58:42.760
 from the human population resident in the African continent

58:43.080 --> 58:47.740
 in millennia past, my race.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.760
 Here in the United States,

58:50.760 --> 58:55.760
 we have various quote unquote races defined crudely

58:55.760 --> 58:58.880
 in the way that I just tried to define myself.

58:59.840 --> 59:03.480
 You could say, and I think there is a very powerful argument

59:03.480 --> 59:07.480
 that these are superficial differences.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.200
 I mean, really?

59:09.200 --> 59:11.960
 Why should it matter that your eye color

59:11.960 --> 59:16.960
 or your hair color or the shape of the bones in your face

59:17.120 --> 59:19.220
 or the color, the tone of your skin,

59:19.220 --> 59:20.200
 the amount of melanin,

59:20.200 --> 59:23.120
 how it is that you react to ultraviolet radiation

59:23.120 --> 59:28.120
 in terms of your skin, what is that the basis of anything?

59:30.720 --> 59:33.320
 I mean, that's arbitrary, that's not meaningful.

59:33.320 --> 59:34.680
 Could there really be meaning

59:34.680 --> 59:38.000
 in these superficial differences among human beings?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.960
 Isn't that a archaic or barbaric way

59:40.960 --> 59:42.160
 of thinking about ourselves,

59:42.160 --> 59:46.000
 to look at each other's skin color or hair texture

59:46.000 --> 59:49.480
 and then to decide, oh, that's a black or that's a white

59:49.480 --> 59:53.040
 or that's a Latin or that's an Asian or that's a whatever.

59:53.040 --> 59:58.040
 That's something that we should outgrow, a person might say.

59:59.360 --> 1:00:03.360
 That's a relic of a kind of tribal society

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:06.900
 of a kind of pre modern society

1:00:06.900 --> 1:00:11.360
 where we built real structure

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:14.880
 on the basis of such superficial difference.

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.080
 A person could say that.

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:20.640
 On the other hand, I am a black American.

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:22.960
 I mean, that's part of my identity,

1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:25.580
 that's part of my heritage,

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:29.460
 it's part of the stories that I tell myself

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:33.000
 about who my people are.

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.320
 Why do I need a people?

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:37.400
 Why do I need a narrative of descent

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:42.400
 in which I affiliate with a racially defined people?

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:45.760
 Do I really need that?

1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:48.120
 I mean, I think that's an important question.

1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:52.440
 In fact, this is a confession, think of myself as black.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.080
 I could think of myself as simply human.

1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:59.000
 I could not identify specifically as black.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:03.200
 I could say, my eyes are brown too, so what?

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:04.480
 I'm a brown eye?

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:08.280
 I mean, I'm gonna invent a group based on my eye color.

1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.400
 I weigh 290 pounds.

1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:12.520
 I'm gonna have a body size group.

1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:17.440
 I'm a plus 200 and that's quote, who I am, close quote.

1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:18.840
 I don't do that.

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.040
 I came from Chicago.

1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.760
 Yes, I do have a certain sense of affinity with my hometown.

1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:26.320
 I'm a Chicago born person,

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:29.800
 but frankly, I haven't lived in Chicago since 1979.

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.160
 That's a long time.

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:37.640
 I wear my Chicago origins very, very lightly.

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:40.160
 I would not go to war with someone from Cleveland

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.000
 or St. Louis and fight to the death

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.860
 with that St. Louis person or that Cleveland person

1:01:46.860 --> 1:01:49.720
 based upon the fact that we come from different cities.

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.120
 And you have even abandoned in your heart

1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:53.600
 the Chicago Bulls.

1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:56.000
 There's some Chicago that's still in me, I suppose,

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:57.600
 but it's not very deep.

1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:00.400
 It's not quote, who I am anymore.

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:02.880
 And I'm wondering, here I'm trying to pose the question,

1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.080
 why is it that being a descendant of African slaves

1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:06.920
 should be who I am?

1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:08.100
 So there's some answers.

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:12.880
 One answer is people will look at me

1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:17.000
 and deal with me differently based upon what they see.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.120
 I don't have control over that.

1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.400
 I'm going to be perceived as a member of a group,

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:24.960
 whether or not I elect to affiliate myself

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:27.840
 with that group or not.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.620
 Therefore, I need to be mindful of the fact

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:36.620
 that regardless of what my internal orientation is,

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.400
 the world will perceive me in a particular way

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:42.480
 and will perceive me differently

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:44.120
 based upon the color of my skin.

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:46.960
 So a police officer who stops me at two o clock

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:49.600
 in the morning because my tail light is out

1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:54.120
 and ask me for my automobile registration

1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.040
 and I reach quickly to the glove compartment

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.120
 to get my registration.

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.760
 And the police officer says, show me your hands.

1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.880
 And I don't quite hear what he says

1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:07.640
 or I ignore what he says as I'm getting my document

1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:08.760
 out of my glove compartment.

1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:11.880
 But the police officer thinks because I have not responded

1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.440
 to his demand to show my hands

1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:15.600
 that I might be reaching for a weapon.

1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:18.400
 And the police officer sees that I'm black

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:22.040
 and fears that the likelihood that I might have a weapon

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:25.020
 is higher because in that town at that time,

1:03:25.020 --> 1:03:28.320
 a lot of the people who get stopped with weapons in their car

1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:31.700
 happen to be black and male and so on.

1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:34.960
 And he pulls his weapon and he discharges it

1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:37.560
 and I'm bleeding out there and I'm dead now.

1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:40.200
 And all of that is a possibility that's very real

1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:42.440
 and it's based upon the color of my skin.

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.960
 And therefore, when he stops me,

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.920
 I keep my hands on the steering wheel

1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:49.000
 and I don't go to the glove compartment.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.640
 And I'm fearful of the fact that he might mistake me

1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:54.800
 for a criminal, et cetera.

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:58.200
 Or I walk into a high end store, clothing store.

1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:00.520
 I see you're nicely dressed there, Lex.

1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.100
 I'm not, but that's okay.

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.920
 I do have some good clothes at home.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:07.060
 I just didn't wear them here today.

1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:07.900
 But you know what I mean.

1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:11.560
 And the salesman in the clothing store

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:15.920
 either treats me like an old friend

1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:17.880
 and is warm and welcoming.

1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:19.480
 And what can I do for you, sir?

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:20.960
 And let me show you this and that.

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:22.320
 And what are you looking for?

1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:24.640
 Because he thinks I'm gonna spend $1,000 there that day

1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:27.480
 and he's gonna get a 5% commission or whatever it is.

1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:31.200
 And he either does that or he ignores me

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:32.520
 and looks at me with suspicion

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.480
 and thinks I might be trying to shoplift something

1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:38.360
 or thinks I'm only gonna spend $50 and not $500

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.440
 and therefore I'm not worth his time.

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:42.240
 And I'm aware of the fact

1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:44.680
 that when I go into the clothing store,

1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.960
 especially the high end places where I can buy a good suit

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.760
 or buy some really good dress shirts or slacks

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:54.200
 that fit me well and so on,

1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:57.460
 I'm aware of the fact that I may not be taken seriously

1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:00.200
 by the salesman based upon the fact

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.120
 that he's looking at me and he sees a black person.

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:06.080
 And therefore I dress up

1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:09.200
 before I go out to buy clothes to get,

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:10.520
 cause I wanna present myself

1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:13.200
 as not someone who just walked in off the street,

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:14.580
 but as one of those black people

1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:17.380
 who is really prepared to spend some money in the store

1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:18.880
 so that I can be treated with respect.

1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:23.780
 And I have to carry the burden such as it is

1:05:23.780 --> 1:05:28.780
 of knowing that I need to earn the being taken seriously

1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:33.000
 being taken seriously by overcoming the suppositions

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.720
 that people may have about me

1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.400
 based upon the color of my skin, something like that.

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:43.800
 Or I ask myself, what am I gonna teach my children

1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:46.440
 about who they are and where they come from?

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:50.520
 What stories am I gonna tell them about their ancestors?

1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.360
 Who are their ancestors?

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:55.900
 Every African American has European ancestors.

1:05:55.900 --> 1:05:59.520
 Every black person in the United States of America,

1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:02.660
 I think that I can say that almost without exception.

1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:05.920
 We could go to 23andMe and look at the DNA.

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:08.920
 They have European ancestors, they're not purely African.

1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:12.280
 That's a fact and that's a consequence

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:16.160
 of the experience of African descended people

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:18.800
 because it's a mixed population.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:21.880
 My name is Lowry, spelled L O U R Y

1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:25.320
 but pronounced as if it were L O W E R Y.

1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:29.000
 And I gather if you trace the history of that name

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.660
 that it's Scottish.

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:33.400
 So somewhere back then.

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.880
 So you could identify as a Scot.

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:40.400
 Well, or I could claim some Scottish descent, but I don't.

1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:42.160
 I don't know who those ancestors are.

1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:47.080
 And frankly, I don't know who my enslaved ancestors are.

1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:51.080
 I can't trace my family history back very far

1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:53.160
 into the 19th century.

1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:57.960
 So what stories do I tell my children about who we are,

1:06:57.960 --> 1:06:59.360
 about who their ancestors are?

1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:01.920
 I mean, I wanna tell my children some story

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:05.320
 and that story is gonna be colored, quote unquote,

1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.120
 by my race.

1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:10.560
 So even though it is superficial

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:14.280
 and in an ideal world, you might think,

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:17.980
 why would human beings, I mean, I read science fiction.

1:07:17.980 --> 1:07:21.480
 So there's this Chinese writer, Chixin Liu is his name.

1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:26.320
 I might not pronounce it exactly right, C I X I N L I U.

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:30.320
 Chixin Liu, he has a trilogy of The Three Body Problem,

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:35.840
 The Dark Forest, and Death's End.

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:38.800
 Those are the three books of Chixin Liu's trilogy

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:42.920
 about how Trisolaris, which is another star system

1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:46.560
 within a few light years of the solar system,

1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:49.500
 and Earth get into a conflict.

1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:54.500
 And when the Trisolaris come down to dominate Earth,

1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:59.420
 suddenly all of these differences between the Chinese

1:07:59.420 --> 1:08:02.440
 and the North Americans and the Europeans

1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:04.720
 and the Africans and the South Asians

1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:08.160
 become kind of insignificant because after all,

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.320
 the Trisolaris with their advanced civilization

1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:14.120
 whose star system is dying,

1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:15.940
 have their eyes on the solar system,

1:08:15.940 --> 1:08:18.040
 which has a planet, the third rock from the sun

1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:21.560
 that is pretty habitable and the difference between us

1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.540
 become pretty insignificant.

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:29.140
 So we shouldn't need for an invasion

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:34.140
 by extraterrestrial beings to have to happen

1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:38.160
 before we would recognize the common humanity

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.120
 that we all share that is profound and is deep.

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:47.360
 We all descend in effect from the same ancestral population

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.200
 of Homo sapiens who walked out of East Africa eons ago

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:56.880
 and have survived amongst all of the different possible

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.960
 variations of species and whatnot,

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:02.680
 of humanoid population, the Homo sapiens have flourished,

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:05.720
 the others have died out and here we are

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:09.160
 and we can just look at the genetic endowments

1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:12.580
 that characterize our biological essence

1:09:12.580 --> 1:09:15.600
 and we can see that we are quote unquote

1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:16.800
 the same beneath the skin

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:21.680
 and yet we end up freighting so much weight

1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:23.560
 onto these superficial differences.

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.660
 So I can see both sides of the issue is what I'm saying.

1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:30.120
 I can see the argument race is an irrelevancy

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:35.560
 because at the end of the day, deep down it is.

1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:37.440
 But I can also see the argument

1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:41.580
 that I hold on to racial identity because A,

1:09:41.580 --> 1:09:46.460
 my racial presentation colors how other people deal with me

1:09:46.460 --> 1:09:50.060
 but B, because everybody needs a story.

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:52.600
 Everybody needs an account.

1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:53.640
 You tell me you're Jewish.

1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:55.440
 I mean, I don't know how deep that is.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:57.800
 I don't know how genetically profound that is.

1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.800
 I do know that it's a culturally profound identity

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.160
 for a lot of people based upon maybe some of the same

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:09.700
 kind of forces that I'm talking about.

1:10:09.700 --> 1:10:11.900
 A, they won't let you not be Jewish.

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:14.320
 You could say you're not Jewish

1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.840
 but when Hitler is rounding people up,

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:18.680
 what you say doesn't have a whole lot to do

1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:22.120
 with what the Gestapo was about.

1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:24.420
 And B, you need to tell your children a story.

1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:28.360
 That's the fascinating thing about this tribalism

1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:33.360
 that you spoke about that we form tribes as humans

1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:37.520
 throughout human history, form tribes

1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:41.480
 and have directed hate toward other tribes

1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:43.960
 and sometimes violence and destruction.

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:47.920
 And yet tribalism allows you to tell a story

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:51.400
 to your children, allows you to grow a culture.

1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:53.080
 There's something about defining yourself

1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.680
 within a particular tribe that allows you

1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:57.840
 to have a tradition.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:02.240
 You have an article that you wrote

1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:05.440
 called The Case for Black Patriotism.

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:06.280
 Oh yeah.

1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:10.780
 So I should also say it's so interesting

1:11:10.780 --> 1:11:15.780
 because for me personally, I feel, identify as,

1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:21.000
 believe I am an American.

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.160
 And yet within the American umbrella,

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:27.120
 it feels that there's a longing for other tribes.

1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:31.560
 You mentioned Jewish but what I honestly feel is,

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:34.440
 I mean a lot of it is humor and culture and so on

1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:38.960
 is Russian and Ukrainian because that's where I come from.

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:40.600
 That's where my family is from.

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:43.280
 You know, there's like stereotypical things

1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.280
 that are funny, humorous type of thing about Russians

1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:52.860
 that's showing no emotion, good at chess and math,

1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:57.040
 into wrestling, drinking vodka.

1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:59.640
 I mean, there's literally every single stereotype.

1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.400
 I'm in the embodiment of that.

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.200
 So there's a, you celebrate that in certain kinds of ways.

1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:07.240
 There's a tradition there within the American umbrella

1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:12.240
 and some of it is humor, some of it is little quirks

1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:15.120
 of culture but now with the war in Russia and Ukraine,

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:18.560
 interestingly enough, even that little thing,

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:22.960
 it becomes also a source of negative tribalism.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:27.960
 But anyway, that context aside, what is black patriotism

1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:31.760
 and why do you feel?

1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:35.120
 I mean, I'm speaking in an article called

1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:39.840
 The Case for Black Patriotism in a Particular Context

1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:45.440
 and what I'm saying basically is very simple.

1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:47.600
 I'm saying we are African Americans

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.400
 and the emphasis should be on the American.

1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:56.280
 I actually don't even much care

1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:00.560
 for the framing African American

1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:02.900
 but I'm not gonna fight with people about it.

1:13:02.900 --> 1:13:05.880
 It's, I don't think it's worth fighting about.

1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:08.440
 That's not how, I would just say we're Americans

1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:11.080
 or if you want, we're black Americans.

1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:12.660
 We're certainly not African.

1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:16.400
 That is the African American population

1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.700
 is a population of people who come into existence

1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:24.780
 here in North America through the cauldron of slavery.

1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:28.880
 There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa,

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:33.040
 immigrants from West Africa, immigrants from Southern Africa,

1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:35.760
 immigrants from the Caribbean who descend

1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:39.180
 from an ancestral population which is African.

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:43.760
 The history of the world since 1500 is a history

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:48.040
 in which people of African descent are scattered

1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:53.040
 because of slavery throughout the Western hemisphere.

1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:55.400
 And so here we are.

1:13:55.400 --> 1:14:00.400
 But the institution of slavery ended in 1863

1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:04.300
 in the United States.

1:14:06.460 --> 1:14:08.720
 The struggle that we started out talking about

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.420
 which gave rise to Martin Luther King giving that speech

1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:16.880
 that you say is the greatest speech in American history

1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:19.520
 and I'm not gonna argue with you about that,

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.520
 happened right here in the United States.

1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:24.440
 We are, what is the United States?

1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:26.440
 The United States is a nation of immigrants.

1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:30.080
 The population of the North American continent

1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:32.840
 was sparsely populated by an indigenous population

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:37.840
 which was destroyed in conquest by a European population

1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:45.120
 that settled here in North America and appropriated the land

1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.560
 and have built a civilization here

1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:51.440
 which has been peopled by a large influx of immigrants

1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:56.440
 of individuals from Europe, Irish and Italian

1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:01.520
 and Greek and Slavic and Jewish, Russian Jews

1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.240
 coming in large numbers and so on

1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:07.560
 and wave after wave after wave of immigration,

1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:11.000
 Asian, Latin American population of people

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.840
 who have come to reside here in the United States

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:17.400
 and we black Americans who descend from slaves.

1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:20.040
 We African Americans who descend from slaves.

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.560
 So here we are.

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:23.460
 This is a great nation.

1:15:23.460 --> 1:15:28.460
 I mean, this is a monumentally significant political force

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.360
 which is the United States of America founded in 1776, 1787

1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:41.020
 fought a war of independence from the British,

1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:45.020
 established a republic which is a confederation

1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.360
 of these independent colonies

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.680
 which has grown into now the 50 states

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:54.040
 of the United States of America, continental nation.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:58.720
 The richest and most powerful nation on the planet

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:02.520
 with massive influence throughout the world

1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:03.700
 for good and for ill.

1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:08.840
 That's who we are, I wanna say to black people.

1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:11.680
 There is no other home for us.

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.440
 This fantasy of we being a people apart

1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:20.080
 back in the day when I was coming along in the 1960s,

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:20.920
 there was something called

1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:23.800
 the Republic of New Africa Movement

1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:26.320
 and they wanted some states in the South

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:27.520
 given over to black people

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:29.480
 and we were gonna have our own country.

1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:33.400
 And that's a joke, it's a fantasy.

1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:37.360
 It's a mythic, unbalanced,

1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:42.360
 the unrealistic fanciful politics.

1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:48.200
 It's not a serious politics.

1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:51.880
 We're Americans, we're not going anywhere here.

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:54.560
 The idea that, and I wanna say this

1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:56.860
 in a number of different registers,

1:16:56.860 --> 1:16:58.800
 I wanna say first of all,

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:00.560
 we need to make peace with the fact

1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:03.300
 that that's who we are and that's where we are.

1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:07.760
 So nobody is coming, the world court

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:10.160
 is not gonna litigate our disputes.

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:13.120
 The United Nations is not gonna set up a desk

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.300
 for people of African descent who reside in North America.

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:20.240
 We have to work out whatever our concerns are

1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:22.260
 with our fellow Americans right here

1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:25.280
 within the context of American politics.

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.380
 That means compromise.

1:17:27.380 --> 1:17:32.380
 That means looking for a framework for political expression

1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:36.420
 which is broader than our racial identity, et cetera.

1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:38.260
 So I wanna say that.

1:17:38.260 --> 1:17:39.660
 But I also wanna say there's no reason

1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:40.860
 to apologize for this.

1:17:40.860 --> 1:17:42.980
 There's something positive to affirm.

1:17:42.980 --> 1:17:47.500
 I take on this question about slavery in brief,

1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:50.620
 because in fact, slavery was awful and it was wrong

1:17:50.620 --> 1:17:53.900
 and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans

1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:58.140
 and it had consequences that have endured

1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:00.060
 long after the termination of the thing.

1:18:00.060 --> 1:18:03.020
 But I also wanna say, look at what has happened

1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:07.040
 in the last 150 years for African Americans.

1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:10.660
 And I wanna say, look at the vitality

1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:13.900
 of the institutions here in the United States of America,

1:18:13.900 --> 1:18:17.600
 of the Democratic Republic of the United States of America.

1:18:18.740 --> 1:18:22.580
 Again, not perfect, which are malleable enough,

1:18:22.580 --> 1:18:26.860
 these institutions to allow for the transformation

1:18:26.860 --> 1:18:28.420
 of the status of African Americans

1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:33.140
 such as has occurred since the end of slavery.

1:18:33.140 --> 1:18:35.980
 And I wanna say there's a lot to celebrate in that.

1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:38.300
 So this is our country.

1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:44.340
 We are full members of the polity.

1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:48.460
 We have burdens and responsibilities

1:18:48.460 --> 1:18:50.780
 as well as privileges that are associated

1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:52.880
 with our membership in this Republic.

1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:55.860
 That does not mean that we should not fight

1:18:55.860 --> 1:18:57.480
 for what we believe to be right,

1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:01.740
 although we are not one voice here, we black Americans.

1:19:01.740 --> 1:19:04.340
 It does not mean that we should not protest things

1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:07.260
 that we think are deserving of protest.

1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:11.500
 But I wanna say, it does mean that we should not reject

1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:14.620
 the framework that we're operating in

1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:17.340
 because we basically don't have any alternative.

1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:20.720
 And because when viewed in full context,

1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:25.060
 a noble and profoundly significant achievement,

1:19:25.060 --> 1:19:28.300
 the United States of America and a beacon

1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:30.740
 to the rest of the world, I don't wanna go off

1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:34.700
 in some starry eyed kind of jingoistic celebration

1:19:34.700 --> 1:19:38.180
 of America as the greatest civilization, et cetera, et cetera.

1:19:38.180 --> 1:19:43.180
 But this great nation is our nation.

1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:47.740
 And I think we do best by beginning,

1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:49.780
 we black Americans do best by beginning,

1:19:49.780 --> 1:19:51.520
 this is my argument in the piece,

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:56.520
 by beginning from a framework which accepts that fact

1:19:56.900 --> 1:19:58.100
 and then builds on it.

1:20:00.260 --> 1:20:05.260
 So black patriotism is, if not exactly the same,

1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:11.160
 rhymes, echoes American patriotism.

1:20:12.180 --> 1:20:16.020
 So a black American is first and foremost an American.

1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:20.180
 Yeah, a black American is first and foremost an American

1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:21.580
 and it's a good thing too.

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:29.500
 Let me return to the question of Dr. King

1:20:30.180 --> 1:20:35.180
 and another powerful, impactful individual, Malcolm X,

1:20:35.820 --> 1:20:37.820
 to ask you the question.

1:20:37.820 --> 1:20:42.820
 Well, first, people often perhaps inaccurately portray them

1:20:43.540 --> 1:20:48.540
 as representing two different ideals, approaches

1:20:48.540 --> 1:20:52.020
 to the fight for civil rights.

1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:56.320
 So Martin Luther King for the nonviolent approach,

1:20:56.320 --> 1:21:01.320
 the peacemaker, and Malcolm X is the by any means necessary.

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:05.300
 What do you think about this distinction?

1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:08.420
 And broadly speaking, in black patriotism,

1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:12.560
 in the future of black Americans in the 21st century,

1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:14.200
 what is the role of anger?

1:21:15.060 --> 1:21:18.260
 What is the role of protest?

1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:22.140
 Even violence encompasses a lot of things,

1:21:22.140 --> 1:21:26.740
 but just aggression and the fuck the man,

1:21:26.740 --> 1:21:29.900
 we're going to have to make change, force change.

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:33.880
 Okay, I think you put your finger on something

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:35.740
 really important in the context of,

1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:39.280
 we were just discussing my black patriotism essay.

1:21:41.380 --> 1:21:44.720
 It's not the only story.

1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:47.940
 There is another story and Malcolm X is someone

1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:52.580
 you identify and his memory lives on

1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:54.660
 and is powerfully influential.

1:21:55.620 --> 1:21:58.460
 And I think you see it in Black Lives Matter,

1:21:58.460 --> 1:22:01.960
 and I think you see it in the protest and rioting

1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:04.900
 and so forth that has broken out periodically

1:22:04.900 --> 1:22:07.020
 going all the way back to the 1960s and before,

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:10.940
 but especially since the 1960s.

1:22:11.860 --> 1:22:14.600
 You saw it in Los Angeles in 1992,

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:16.580
 the Rodney King civil disturbances

1:22:16.580 --> 1:22:21.400
 that broke out there and the balled up fist,

1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:26.400
 the radical afrocentric rejection

1:22:27.660 --> 1:22:31.700
 of the American story that Martin Luther King,

1:22:31.700 --> 1:22:32.540
 he believed in.

1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:35.300
 He believed in a magnificent promissory note.

1:22:35.300 --> 1:22:37.900
 And a lot of people are rolling their eyes

1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:39.620
 and saying, as you say,

1:22:39.620 --> 1:22:42.180
 fuck the man, magnificent promissory note.

1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:46.100
 I mean, just get your knee off my neck.

1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:47.220
 That's what you can do for me.

1:22:47.220 --> 1:22:49.260
 Don't ask me to believe in your BS

1:22:49.260 --> 1:22:51.220
 about some magnificent promissory note,

1:22:51.220 --> 1:22:54.660
 some founding fathers who were all slave owners anyway.

1:22:54.660 --> 1:22:56.560
 I mean, just get your knee off my neck.

1:22:57.780 --> 1:22:59.820
 Now, I can relate to that.

1:23:00.700 --> 1:23:05.060
 As I mentioned, I grew up in Chicago in the 1950s

1:23:05.060 --> 1:23:06.220
 and the 1960s.

1:23:06.220 --> 1:23:10.160
 I remember Malcolm X, I mean, literally in real time.

1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:14.300
 I remember when he was murdered in 1965

1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:18.100
 in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem,

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.160
 in Manhattan, in New York City.

1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:26.300
 I remember my uncle, I was raised in a house

1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:29.820
 where my aunt and uncle were the master of the house.

1:23:29.820 --> 1:23:31.660
 And my mother and my sister and I lived

1:23:31.660 --> 1:23:35.240
 in a small apartment upstairs in the back

1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:40.240
 of this big house that my successful aunt and uncle owned.

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:42.660
 And my uncle was a small businessman,

1:23:42.660 --> 1:23:46.020
 a barber and a tradesman.

1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:47.580
 He was a hustler.

1:23:47.580 --> 1:23:50.500
 I mean, legally, he did what he had to do to make money.

1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:53.840
 He was a very enterprising, not especially well educated,

1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:57.380
 but a very intelligent and disciplined

1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:01.640
 and resourceful provider for his family,

1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:04.500
 which included myself, my sister,

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:07.060
 and my mother in their household.

1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:08.500
 And we called him Uncle Mooney

1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:10.940
 because he had moon shaped eyes

1:24:10.940 --> 1:24:12.380
 that protruded and were round.

1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:16.980
 Uncle Mooney, James Ellis was his name.

1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:21.720
 Uncle Mooney, James Ellis Lee was my Uncle Mooney.

1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:24.380
 But I'm saying all that to say this.

1:24:24.380 --> 1:24:27.060
 He admired the nation of Islam.

1:24:27.060 --> 1:24:29.900
 I mean, King and Malcolm X,

1:24:29.900 --> 1:24:31.660
 Martin King and Malcolm X differed

1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:33.040
 along a number of different dimensions.

1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:34.420
 Malcolm X was a Muslim.

1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:37.900
 And Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian minister.

1:24:39.340 --> 1:24:41.940
 My Uncle Mooney didn't have any time

1:24:41.940 --> 1:24:44.140
 for these Christian ministers.

1:24:44.140 --> 1:24:46.340
 He thought that was the white man's religion.

1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:50.700
 And back in that day, you'd go into a black church

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:53.340
 and you'd see a portrait of Jesus

1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:57.300
 and he'd be blonde hair, blue eyed.

1:24:57.300 --> 1:25:00.620
 He didn't even look like a Mediterranean.

1:25:00.620 --> 1:25:03.620
 I mean, he didn't look like somebody who came from Palestine.

1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:05.660
 I mean, he looked like somebody who came

1:25:05.660 --> 1:25:07.180
 from Northern Europe or something like that,

1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:08.020
 the picture of Jesus.

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:11.020
 And my Uncle Mooney rejected that whole thing.

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:13.980
 He would be damned if he was gonna bend his knee

1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:16.380
 to some white Jesus.

1:25:17.700 --> 1:25:19.640
 But he was not a Muslim either.

1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:22.060
 But he respected the Muslims.

1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:24.060
 He brought home their newspaper.

1:25:24.060 --> 1:25:25.500
 It was called Muhammad Speaks.

1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:28.100
 This is the nation of Islam,

1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:30.720
 which is the black Muslim movement

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:35.720
 founded in American cities in Detroit and then Chicago,

1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:40.380
 going back to the early middle 20th century

1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:43.800
 and growing into a very significant movement

1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:44.980
 that had a lot of influence,

1:25:44.980 --> 1:25:48.700
 Louis Farrakhan and controversial figure

1:25:48.700 --> 1:25:50.020
 descends from this movement.

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:53.180
 It has fractured now

1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:58.180
 and has the major part of the legacy of the black Muslims

1:25:59.940 --> 1:26:03.260
 has assimilated itself into Islam proper.

1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:08.780
 Malcolm X made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina

1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:11.220
 and came back with a very different vision

1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:12.880
 about what it meant to be a Muslim

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:16.700
 and understood himself to be a part of the large tradition

1:26:16.700 --> 1:26:20.600
 and religious culture of Islam that has a global reach.

1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.940
 And he had a different vision when he came back from that.

1:26:23.940 --> 1:26:27.300
 Some people say that's why he was killed and so on.

1:26:27.300 --> 1:26:28.500
 I don't know.

1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:30.340
 I certainly find that to be plausible

1:26:30.340 --> 1:26:34.220
 that he became the constituted threat to the sect,

1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:36.740
 which was the black Muslims

1:26:36.740 --> 1:26:39.380
 and had to be dealt with.

1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:43.300
 I don't know if we'll ever know the full story on that.

1:26:43.300 --> 1:26:45.620
 But anyway, what I'm trying to say is

1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:47.780
 the black Muslims were there, Malcolm X was there.

1:26:47.780 --> 1:26:51.140
 And in my experience,

1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:55.780
 they constituted a counterpoint to the position of king,

1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:59.660
 which depended on a kind of respect

1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:04.660
 for the best of the tradition of American democracy,

1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:09.100
 appealing to the better nature of our oppressors,

1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:12.420
 live up to the full meaning of our creed.

1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:14.660
 I mean, these are words that he would use.

1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:18.220
 A magnificent promissory note is what he would think of

1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:20.020
 as the declaration of independence

1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:23.220
 and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln,

1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:25.660
 a unfulfilled ideal.

1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:30.660
 And the black Muslims were like, fuck that.

1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:32.460
 We're gonna take care of our own.

1:27:32.460 --> 1:27:35.780
 We're gonna build our own schools.

1:27:35.780 --> 1:27:37.860
 We're gonna build our own businesses.

1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:41.140
 We're not waiting for the white man to do anything.

1:27:41.140 --> 1:27:43.140
 Get your knee off my neck and get out of my way

1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:44.980
 and let me take care of my own.

1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:46.300
 And my uncle respected that.

1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.740
 He respected the straight back,

1:27:48.740 --> 1:27:51.220
 the stand up straight with your shoulders back.

1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:52.060
 That's a Jordan Peterson.

1:27:52.060 --> 1:27:54.820
 But I mean, that was way before Jordan Peterson,

1:27:54.820 --> 1:27:56.140
 but that was his philosophy.

1:27:56.140 --> 1:27:58.980
 Stand up straight, but just raise your children.

1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:01.060
 Don't be depending upon welfare.

1:28:01.060 --> 1:28:03.740
 You're taking welfare from the white man.

1:28:03.740 --> 1:28:04.740
 You need to get busy.

1:28:04.740 --> 1:28:06.380
 You need to educate yourself.

1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:07.500
 You need to clean up your act.

1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:11.180
 Put down the fried chicken because it's gonna kill you.

1:28:11.180 --> 1:28:16.180
 My uncle Mooney loved this book that Elijah Muhammad,

1:28:16.180 --> 1:28:19.100
 they called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad,

1:28:19.100 --> 1:28:22.220
 who was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam.

1:28:22.220 --> 1:28:25.660
 He had a book and all the book said was,

1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:29.620
 be smart, eat green vegetables, don't eat fried food.

1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:32.620
 Don't eat pork.

1:28:32.620 --> 1:28:33.780
 They're Muslims.

1:28:33.780 --> 1:28:38.380
 Don't eat pork and take responsibility for your diet

1:28:38.380 --> 1:28:39.820
 and be healthy.

1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:43.420
 And don't be putting a whole lot of pills into your body.

1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:44.300
 You don't need to do that

1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:45.940
 if you just get control of your diet

1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:47.820
 and you eat properly.

1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:52.820
 My uncle loves this idea of responsibility for self

1:28:53.660 --> 1:28:56.500
 and a determination to build.

1:28:56.500 --> 1:29:00.060
 He respected that in the Muslims,

1:29:00.060 --> 1:29:02.900
 even if he didn't buy the religious part of it.

1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:08.740
 And so, and by the way, when my uncle died in 1983,

1:29:13.220 --> 1:29:15.020
 he left me a bequest.

1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:18.060
 It wasn't money, unfortunately.

1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:21.700
 It was his complete collection

1:29:21.700 --> 1:29:26.700
 of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.

1:29:26.700 --> 1:29:28.220
 And I have these albums.

1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:30.180
 These are 33 and a third LPs.

1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:31.300
 There's six of them.

1:29:32.580 --> 1:29:34.700
 And I have a complete collection,

1:29:34.700 --> 1:29:36.140
 as best as my uncle could assemble,

1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:37.580
 of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.

1:29:37.580 --> 1:29:39.220
 Now, why did he do that?

1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:42.300
 He did that because he did not want me to forget.

1:29:42.300 --> 1:29:43.940
 Don't be dependent upon the white man.

1:29:43.940 --> 1:29:45.580
 Build your own.

1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:48.060
 Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

1:29:48.060 --> 1:29:51.540
 Proud black man, take care of your business.

1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:53.540
 Take care of your children.

1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:56.380
 Pick up the trash in front of your house.

1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:57.500
 Get busy.

1:29:58.860 --> 1:30:00.460
 This was this philosophy.

1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:05.620
 So violence now, that's another story.

1:30:05.620 --> 1:30:08.500
 I mean, Malcolm X would say,

1:30:08.500 --> 1:30:09.820
 we're gonna defend ourselves.

1:30:09.820 --> 1:30:11.380
 You're gonna mess with us,

1:30:11.380 --> 1:30:14.300
 you racist Ku Klux Klan or whatever.

1:30:14.300 --> 1:30:17.500
 We're gonna arm ourselves and we're gonna fight you back.

1:30:17.500 --> 1:30:22.020
 You racist police who are oppressing

1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:24.620
 and persecuting and abusing our people,

1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:27.060
 well, you better be ready

1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:28.780
 because we're gonna fight you back.

1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:33.380
 And that too was the spirit that my uncle,

1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:36.140
 that was a kind of attitude, a kind of posture.

1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:37.300
 My uncle was not a radical.

1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:41.820
 He was a businessman, but he respected this idea.

1:30:41.820 --> 1:30:45.940
 You take your life in your own hands when you mess with us

1:30:45.940 --> 1:30:48.500
 because we're prepared to defend ourselves.

1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:50.300
 So that blood runs in you too.

1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:53.500
 That thread is, when you write about black patriotism,

1:30:53.500 --> 1:30:55.420
 that thread is there too.

1:30:55.420 --> 1:31:00.420
 It's like you embody both the ideal that we're all American,

1:31:00.900 --> 1:31:05.420
 but also that there is this oppressive history.

1:31:05.420 --> 1:31:10.420
 There is the powerful that are manipulating you,

1:31:10.420 --> 1:31:15.420
 that are oppressing you, and you can't just wait around

1:31:16.300 --> 1:31:18.420
 for things to fix themselves.

1:31:18.420 --> 1:31:20.940
 You have to take action.

1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:22.820
 You have to take things into your own hands.

1:31:22.820 --> 1:31:24.660
 And sometimes that means being angry.

1:31:24.660 --> 1:31:26.820
 Sometimes that means being violent.

1:31:26.820 --> 1:31:27.980
 That's there too.

1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:33.300
 Yeah, it's there, but here, and the but is,

1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:37.580
 I don't, me today, Glenn Loury in 2022,

1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:40.460
 think that that is the answer.

1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:45.260
 I don't think that violent rebellion gets us anywhere

1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:46.700
 at the end of the day.

1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:49.900
 I think we're past that.

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:52.860
 There aren't Knight Rider, Ku Klux Klan,

1:31:52.860 --> 1:31:55.740
 people breaking down your door and dragging you away.

1:31:55.740 --> 1:32:00.740
 There are not nooses thrown over a tree limb

1:32:01.980 --> 1:32:03.580
 where you hang somebody from the tree

1:32:03.580 --> 1:32:05.420
 because they whistled at a white woman

1:32:05.420 --> 1:32:07.980
 or they got too much property in your community

1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:10.260
 and you became, they were uppity Negroes

1:32:10.260 --> 1:32:11.100
 and whatnot like that.

1:32:11.100 --> 1:32:14.860
 That is a thing of the past in America

1:32:14.860 --> 1:32:19.380
 that the situation is no longer the one

1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:23.140
 that requires that kind of violent reaction

1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:27.660
 and that there is, if we look at the net effect

1:32:27.660 --> 1:32:32.660
 of the so called rebellions in American cities,

1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:34.860
 they're negative.

1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:39.860
 The George Floyd protests, which became violent

1:32:40.620 --> 1:32:44.180
 and arsonists in the aftermath of civil disturbance

1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:47.100
 and whatnot in the summer of 2020,

1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:50.940
 I think set back the program for African Americans.

1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:52.380
 I don't think it advanced it.

1:32:53.700 --> 1:32:56.980
 I think there are things to be concerned about,

1:32:56.980 --> 1:32:59.180
 schools that are not working,

1:32:59.180 --> 1:33:02.620
 police that are not respecting citizens and so forth.

1:33:02.620 --> 1:33:04.980
 But I think that those are things

1:33:04.980 --> 1:33:07.660
 that affect white Americans as well

1:33:07.660 --> 1:33:12.660
 and that the way to ultimately correct those things

1:33:13.700 --> 1:33:18.700
 is to make alliance and associate oneself

1:33:19.860 --> 1:33:23.300
 with Americans who are concerned to change these things.

1:33:23.300 --> 1:33:25.820
 And I don't think it's properly framed

1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:29.020
 as a racial problem.

1:33:29.020 --> 1:33:34.020
 I certainly don't think that violent rebellion

1:33:36.780 --> 1:33:37.860
 gets us anywhere.

1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:44.260
 I get the historical salience of that posture

1:33:45.060 --> 1:33:47.180
 and it made a lot of sense

1:33:47.180 --> 1:33:49.980
 in the early and the mid 20th century.

1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:51.780
 I don't think it makes very much sense at all

1:33:51.780 --> 1:33:53.460
 in the early 21st century.

1:33:55.100 --> 1:33:57.620
 Well, thank you for allowing me for a brief moment

1:33:57.620 --> 1:33:59.860
 to try to channel your Uncle Mooney

1:33:59.860 --> 1:34:02.300
 and maybe Malcolm X in this conversation

1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:05.300
 as we look forward to the 21st century.

1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:09.380
 You mentioned that in part,

1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:13.020
 you're troubled by the term African American.

1:34:13.020 --> 1:34:18.020
 So words are funny things until they're not.

1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:20.860
 So let me ask you about what I think

1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:22.900
 is one of the most powerful and controversial words

1:34:22.900 --> 1:34:25.580
 in the English language, the N word.

1:34:25.580 --> 1:34:30.580
 So this is a word that I can't say

1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:34.860
 that only certain people have the right to say.

1:34:34.860 --> 1:34:38.900
 I have a friend, Joe Rogan, who has,

1:34:40.900 --> 1:34:43.980
 what would you say, there was mass pushback

1:34:43.980 --> 1:34:48.180
 or highlighting of the fact that he didn't just say N word

1:34:48.180 --> 1:34:51.980
 but said the full word many times

1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:53.740
 throughout his conversations

1:34:53.740 --> 1:34:58.340
 when referring to, in a meta way,

1:34:58.340 --> 1:35:00.540
 about the power of words,

1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:03.460
 especially when related to certain comedians

1:35:03.460 --> 1:35:04.700
 using those words.

1:35:06.420 --> 1:35:07.260
 Yeah.

1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:09.300
 What do you think about this word?

1:35:10.380 --> 1:35:12.700
 Is it empowering?

1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:14.340
 Is it destructive?

1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:17.580
 What is it?

1:35:17.580 --> 1:35:20.700
 What does it mean for race in America?

1:35:20.700 --> 1:35:24.500
 What does it mean that people like Joe Rogan

1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:29.500
 were essentially, there's an attack to cancel him

1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:31.180
 for using the word?

1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:33.820
 Just as a scholar of human nature,

1:35:33.820 --> 1:35:36.140
 what do you think about this whole thing?

1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:39.140
 This is a phenomenon that interests me.

1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:40.580
 Okay.

1:35:40.580 --> 1:35:44.860
 The N word, nigger, I can say it because I'm black.

1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:48.060
 But I mean, I can also say it because I like hip hop.

1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:50.540
 And when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time.

1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:52.420
 These niggas ain't, you know,

1:35:52.420 --> 1:35:54.460
 you better watch out for these, et cetera.

1:35:55.620 --> 1:35:59.020
 I heard the word constantly as I was growing up

1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.700
 as a boy and a young man in Chicago.

1:36:01.700 --> 1:36:03.340
 Niggas ain't shit.

1:36:03.340 --> 1:36:04.780
 That was said.

1:36:04.780 --> 1:36:06.420
 That was, you know,

1:36:06.420 --> 1:36:10.380
 and that could be a reflection of some kind of pathology

1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:13.060
 within the African American community of self hatred

1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:14.140
 and so forth.

1:36:14.140 --> 1:36:18.340
 It could be, or it could just be a colloquial linguistic way.

1:36:18.340 --> 1:36:23.220
 I mean, I assume other groups also have their various,

1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:26.500
 I don't know how the Irish talk about their Irish brothers

1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:27.740
 and, you know, whatever.

1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:30.660
 And I don't know how the Jews talk about

1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:33.260
 the Jewish brothers and whatever.

1:36:33.260 --> 1:36:35.820
 But black people, when talking about other black people

1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:39.180
 use the N word all the time.

1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:45.220
 My nigger, N I G G A, you know, my nigger.

1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:48.020
 That is a term of endearment.

1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:50.980
 My friend, Randall Kennedy,

1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:55.220
 the law professor at Harvard University

1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:57.460
 has a book called Nigger.

1:36:57.460 --> 1:37:00.260
 And he uses the word in the title of the book,

1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:04.860
 the history of a strange history of a provocative word.

1:37:04.860 --> 1:37:06.060
 At some point there's a subtitle,

1:37:06.060 --> 1:37:11.060
 but the title of the book is N I G G E R colon.

1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:15.460
 And then he has a subtitle.

1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:20.380
 I think, of course, the use of the word as a slur

1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:25.380
 and an insult, which is a part of the history

1:37:26.100 --> 1:37:27.860
 of black people in the United States,

1:37:27.860 --> 1:37:31.820
 the use of the word by the Southern racist segregationist,

1:37:31.820 --> 1:37:33.340
 we don't want no niggers up in here.

1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:36.100
 Yall, you know, niggers have no place in my restaurant,

1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:37.940
 in my store, et cetera.

1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:40.140
 That's meant to be an insult.

1:37:40.140 --> 1:37:41.260
 It's an insult to people.

1:37:41.260 --> 1:37:42.180
 It's a fighting word.

1:37:42.180 --> 1:37:44.940
 It's a way that you say that to somebody.

1:37:44.940 --> 1:37:47.940
 It's a invitation for conflict.

1:37:49.020 --> 1:37:52.820
 That said, what is it that about this particular word

1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:55.180
 and also the asymmetry of it,

1:37:55.180 --> 1:37:57.500
 that do you think it's empowering

1:37:57.500 --> 1:38:01.300
 to the black community to own a word?

1:38:04.060 --> 1:38:06.020
 My honest answer to you is I don't know.

1:38:06.020 --> 1:38:08.180
 I don't fully understand it.

1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:10.860
 It has become symbolic in a way.

1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:13.300
 And the policing of the use of the word,

1:38:13.300 --> 1:38:15.380
 I can say it, but white people can't say it.

1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:16.220
 I can say it.

1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:17.060
 I'm not a racist.

1:38:17.060 --> 1:38:19.020
 I'm not a self hating black.

1:38:19.020 --> 1:38:24.020
 I'm just speaking the language of colloquial English

1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:26.660
 that has emerged amongst African Americans

1:38:26.660 --> 1:38:29.140
 in which that word plays a big role.

1:38:29.140 --> 1:38:32.060
 But the prohibition on its use by others.

1:38:32.060 --> 1:38:34.660
 And of course, in the Joe Rogan case,

1:38:34.660 --> 1:38:38.620
 it wasn't as if he was calling anybody an N word.

1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:42.100
 He was simply pointing out that people had said stuff

1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:44.860
 in which the N word was a part of what they said.

1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:46.780
 Now, he did make the statement about,

1:38:47.820 --> 1:38:48.660
 how did he put it?

1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:49.500
 The planet of the apes,

1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:52.980
 that one of the offensive things that he said,

1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:53.820
 he walked into a room,

1:38:53.820 --> 1:38:55.220
 there's a bunch of black guys standing around.

1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:57.100
 He says, like planet of the apes.

1:38:57.100 --> 1:38:59.580
 He said it's like Africa, planet of the apes.

1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:03.060
 Yeah, he should have been a little bit more careful.

1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:05.260
 That was an insult.

1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:10.260
 That was something that if you say that

1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:12.100
 and people are offended,

1:39:12.100 --> 1:39:13.180
 they have a right to be offended.

1:39:13.180 --> 1:39:14.580
 And if you didn't mean to offend them,

1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:15.420
 you can apologize.

1:39:15.420 --> 1:39:16.380
 And he did apologize.

1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:17.940
 I accept his apology.

1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:20.500
 Joe's okay with me as far as that goes.

1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:25.380
 In fact, John McWhorter and I at the podcast that I do,

1:39:25.380 --> 1:39:26.940
 The Glenn Show, had a conversation,

1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:29.300
 part of which touched on the Joe Rogan phenomenon.

1:39:29.300 --> 1:39:31.580
 And we concluded he didn't really do anything wrong.

1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:34.740
 I mean, you can like or you can hate him or whatever,

1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:37.980
 but the idea that he's a racist is kind of ridiculous.

1:39:37.980 --> 1:39:42.980
 So frankly, I mean, if that's your test

1:39:43.140 --> 1:39:46.020
 of what constitutes a racist, the utterance of the word,

1:39:47.780 --> 1:39:52.780
 then it's kind of silly as far as I'm concerned.

1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:58.180
 What do you think about the rigorous testing of people

1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:00.900
 to the degree they're racist or not?

1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:05.900
 The accusation of racism being a way to attack,

1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:09.780
 to bully, to divide.

1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:13.180
 So what are the pros and cons of that once again?

1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:16.060
 Because it does reveal the assholes and the racists,

1:40:16.060 --> 1:40:20.420
 but it can hurt people who are not.

1:40:20.420 --> 1:40:25.420
 Well, I think we have a history here in the United States

1:40:26.020 --> 1:40:30.660
 of blatant racism that goes back a long way.

1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:32.940
 And that has present day echoes.

1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:35.860
 So there are racists.

1:40:35.860 --> 1:40:38.340
 I mean, there are people who will look and see,

1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:39.540
 oh, those are black people.

1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:40.820
 They're patronizing this business.

1:40:40.820 --> 1:40:42.860
 I don't wanna patronize this business anymore.

1:40:42.860 --> 1:40:45.700
 Who if their daughter or their son is dating somebody

1:40:45.700 --> 1:40:47.660
 that is black, they will say,

1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:48.980
 I really wish you wouldn't do that.

1:40:48.980 --> 1:40:50.620
 I mean, why are you hanging out with those people?

1:40:50.620 --> 1:40:52.460
 Don't you know who they are?

1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:54.780
 There are people, there are racists, okay?

1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:56.420
 There are black racists.

1:40:56.420 --> 1:40:59.580
 That is black people who see somebody who's white

1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:03.260
 and who then invoke a whole lot of stereotypes or whatever,

1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:08.260
 or have a visceral dislike based upon nothing

1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:11.060
 other than the color of the person's skin.

1:41:11.060 --> 1:41:12.180
 Such people exist.

1:41:12.180 --> 1:41:15.020
 Racism is a real thing, et cetera.

1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:18.780
 On the other hand, I think this,

1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:22.820
 throwing around the accusation of racism,

1:41:22.820 --> 1:41:25.740
 a college professor is teaching a course.

1:41:25.740 --> 1:41:29.060
 He says in the context of teaching the course

1:41:29.060 --> 1:41:33.860
 that the underrepresentation of blacks

1:41:33.860 --> 1:41:38.060
 in physics program at this university

1:41:38.060 --> 1:41:41.900
 is because they score lower on the test than other groups

1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:44.340
 and they're not qualified.

1:41:44.340 --> 1:41:48.740
 So say the professor gives a lecture and he says,

1:41:48.740 --> 1:41:50.660
 we don't have more blacks in the physics department

1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:52.340
 at this university because there are not enough

1:41:52.340 --> 1:41:54.180
 qualified blacks.

1:41:54.180 --> 1:41:57.140
 Somebody in the classroom who hears that,

1:41:57.140 --> 1:41:59.300
 a black student, objects.

1:41:59.300 --> 1:42:01.820
 He's a racist, okay?

1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:04.500
 That's a power move.

1:42:05.460 --> 1:42:10.020
 It's a move to try to control the conversation.

1:42:10.020 --> 1:42:12.700
 It's not an argument, it's an epithet.

1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:16.540
 You've said that a person who has a particular idea

1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:18.460
 that you don't like, maybe that idea is,

1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:21.220
 I'm against affirmative action, I think it's unfair.

1:42:21.220 --> 1:42:24.620
 I was just with Dorian Abbott.

1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:29.620
 Dorian Abbott is a scientist at the University of Chicago

1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:33.860
 who published a piece in Newsweek magazine

1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:36.620
 in which he said that he thought affirmative action

1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:41.060
 and racial balancing was unethical.

1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:44.660
 He was invited to give a lecture at MIT,

1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:46.420
 a very distinguished lecture in his field

1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:49.180
 based on planetary science.

1:42:49.180 --> 1:42:51.340
 I don't know exactly what it is.

1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:53.580
 I'm not a scientist.

1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:58.220
 But in any case, because he had said

1:42:58.220 --> 1:42:59.820
 that he didn't like affirmative action

1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:01.620
 and he thought affirmative action was racist,

1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.740
 that's basically what he said.

1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:05.140
 Why are we looking at people based upon their race

1:43:05.140 --> 1:43:07.260
 and decide we should just do it on the merit?

1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:08.980
 That was his position.

1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:12.220
 Now, people protesting at the university

1:43:12.220 --> 1:43:15.940
 where he was invited, MIT, saying that he's a racist

1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:17.500
 because he had that opinion.

1:43:17.500 --> 1:43:19.020
 He gets disinvited.

1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:24.020
 Charles Murray is a popular social science writer

1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:29.700
 who is famous for his book about IQ, The Bell Curve,

1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:34.380
 one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences

1:43:34.380 --> 1:43:37.180
 between black and white in performance

1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:41.500
 on mental ability tests and speculates about the extent

1:43:41.500 --> 1:43:43.900
 to which such differences may be connected

1:43:43.900 --> 1:43:48.180
 with the genetic inheritance of these racially diverse people.

1:43:48.180 --> 1:43:51.020
 Now, he could be wrong about everything that he's saying.

1:43:52.420 --> 1:43:57.060
 The Southern Poverty Law Center calls him a white supremacist

1:43:57.060 --> 1:44:02.060
 because he observes that there are racial differences

1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:07.060
 in measured intellectual ability amongst Americans

1:44:07.060 --> 1:44:08.740
 of different racial descent.

1:44:10.660 --> 1:44:12.060
 He could be wrong.

1:44:12.060 --> 1:44:13.500
 Let me stipulate that he is wrong.

1:44:13.500 --> 1:44:15.980
 I mean, I don't wanna argue about whether he's right

1:44:15.980 --> 1:44:16.820
 or wrong.

1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:18.540
 I don't wanna argue about whether he's right

1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:20.460
 or about whether he's wrong.

1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:24.660
 He's addressing himself to a factual issue.

1:44:24.660 --> 1:44:27.780
 And now the issue becomes instead of grappling

1:44:27.780 --> 1:44:29.900
 with the factual questions at hand

1:44:29.900 --> 1:44:32.140
 and demonstrating his rightness or wrongness

1:44:32.140 --> 1:44:35.740
 about those questions, the issue becomes his character.

1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:37.020
 He's a racist.

1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:43.140
 That's, in my mind, a lot like calling him a witch.

1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:48.140
 And the use of that word now, I think,

1:44:48.140 --> 1:44:53.140
 has parallels to accusing people of witchcraft

1:44:53.940 --> 1:44:56.980
 because they have views about substantive questions

1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:01.220
 that bear on racial inequality or racial difference

1:45:01.220 --> 1:45:04.180
 that a person finds unacceptable

1:45:04.180 --> 1:45:05.500
 or that a person disagrees with.

1:45:05.500 --> 1:45:07.620
 And you think you can shut somebody up.

1:45:07.620 --> 1:45:12.620
 Crime in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore,

1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:18.300
 Philadelphia, Washington, DC is out of control,

1:45:18.300 --> 1:45:20.020
 some person might say.

1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:21.620
 Murder rate is high.

1:45:21.620 --> 1:45:22.980
 Who's committing those crimes?

1:45:22.980 --> 1:45:27.300
 They're mostly black young men who are doing the carjackings

1:45:27.300 --> 1:45:28.460
 and who are doing the shootings.

1:45:28.460 --> 1:45:29.740
 They're killing each other.

1:45:29.740 --> 1:45:32.260
 They're making our city unlivable.

1:45:32.260 --> 1:45:35.940
 Now, that's a hypothetical statement that I offer.

1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:39.260
 It might be correct, it might be incorrect.

1:45:39.260 --> 1:45:42.060
 It might be appropriate, it might be inappropriate.

1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:45.540
 It may be true, but something that we would be better off

1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:47.980
 if people didn't focus on, I don't know.

1:45:49.420 --> 1:45:52.060
 Responding to someone making that statement,

1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:55.060
 have you seen what has happened to my city?

1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:57.860
 It used to be that you could go to North Michigan Avenue

1:45:57.860 --> 1:45:59.700
 and you could find one after another

1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:01.100
 after another high end shop.

1:46:01.100 --> 1:46:03.420
 This is in Chicago, my hometown.

1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:07.140
 And tourists would come and they'd go to the theater

1:46:07.140 --> 1:46:08.940
 and there were restaurants and they'd go out.

1:46:08.940 --> 1:46:10.180
 They don't do it anymore.

1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:11.020
 You know what?

1:46:11.020 --> 1:46:12.180
 Half of those stores are boarded up now.

1:46:12.180 --> 1:46:13.380
 You know why?

1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:15.540
 Because when George Floyd was killed,

1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:19.540
 black people mobbed in the city and they burnt

1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:21.180
 and they rioted and they looted

1:46:21.180 --> 1:46:22.980
 and it hasn't been the same ever since.

1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.820
 And I'm moving to the suburbs.

1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:26.860
 I'll be damned if I'm gonna send my children

1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:27.700
 to those schools.

1:46:27.700 --> 1:46:29.300
 A person could say that.

1:46:29.300 --> 1:46:31.380
 They might be right, they might be wrong to say it.

1:46:31.380 --> 1:46:33.420
 They might be right, they might be wrong to say it.

1:46:33.420 --> 1:46:36.140
 Calling them a racist is exactly not

1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:38.940
 a rebuttal of what they said.

1:46:38.940 --> 1:46:39.860
 It's a move.

1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:43.460
 It's a move to try to take control of the conversation

1:46:43.460 --> 1:46:45.700
 by accusing someone of having bad character

1:46:45.700 --> 1:46:48.180
 because they said something that made you uncomfortable,

1:46:48.180 --> 1:46:49.540
 which you can't deal with.

1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:52.740
 So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist.

1:46:52.740 --> 1:46:55.020
 You might as well be calling them a witch.

1:46:55.020 --> 1:46:57.060
 You might as well be calling for their head on a platter

1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:00.100
 because they believe that Satan is Lord

1:47:00.100 --> 1:47:04.420
 because that's the kind of quote argument, close quote,

1:47:04.420 --> 1:47:06.300
 which is precisely not an argument

1:47:07.380 --> 1:47:09.780
 that people who invoke that term are using.

1:47:09.780 --> 1:47:12.140
 And here's what I have to say about that.

1:47:12.140 --> 1:47:17.140
 It's a fool's errand to try to refute somebody

1:47:17.140 --> 1:47:18.540
 by calling them a witch.

1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:23.140
 Likewise, it's a fool's errand to try to rebut

1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:26.220
 the contrary forces in American politics

1:47:26.220 --> 1:47:29.340
 that are a reaction often to real things

1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:31.500
 that are going on on the ground in black communities

1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:33.420
 in the cities across this country

1:47:33.420 --> 1:47:35.380
 by calling people a racist.

1:47:35.380 --> 1:47:39.180
 You may shut them up, but you won't change their minds.

1:47:39.180 --> 1:47:40.020
 And you know what?

1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:41.740
 At the end of the day, they're gonna go to the ballot box

1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:43.060
 and they're gonna vote.

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:45.420
 They're gonna pick up their store

1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:47.580
 and they're gonna move it to the other side of town

1:47:47.580 --> 1:47:49.700
 or to another town altogether.

1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:51.940
 They're gonna keep their children away

1:47:51.940 --> 1:47:53.820
 from places where they think the influences

1:47:53.820 --> 1:47:55.940
 are harmful to those children.

1:47:55.940 --> 1:47:58.580
 They may not even talk about it in public.

1:47:58.580 --> 1:48:00.100
 You can believe that in private

1:48:00.100 --> 1:48:02.460
 that they're talking about it with each other.

1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:05.340
 You had better find a more effective way

1:48:05.340 --> 1:48:07.540
 of dealing with the conflicts in this country

1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:09.780
 that fall along racial fault lines

1:48:09.780 --> 1:48:11.620
 than calling people witches,

1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:15.940
 which is what this, you know, anti racist,

1:48:15.940 --> 1:48:17.340
 you're a racist because you think

1:48:17.340 --> 1:48:20.220
 that the out of wedlock birth rate amongst black Americans

1:48:20.220 --> 1:48:21.900
 is seven babies out of 10 are born

1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:23.620
 to a woman without a husband.

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:25.180
 Their families are falling apart.

1:48:25.180 --> 1:48:26.380
 Now, no one says that in public

1:48:26.380 --> 1:48:27.740
 because they'd be called a racist

1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:29.020
 if they said it in public.

1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:32.380
 But as a matter of fact, the families are falling apart.

1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:33.820
 You didn't change that in the least

1:48:33.820 --> 1:48:35.900
 by telling people to shut up about it.

1:48:35.900 --> 1:48:38.220
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan is called a racist

1:48:38.220 --> 1:48:40.660
 in the 1960s, the late Senator,

1:48:40.660 --> 1:48:43.900
 the New York Senator who was a federal employee

1:48:43.900 --> 1:48:45.580
 and an intellectual writing reports

1:48:45.580 --> 1:48:47.500
 and he writes a report about the Negro family,

1:48:47.500 --> 1:48:48.980
 he called it in those years.

1:48:48.980 --> 1:48:50.100
 If I use the word Negro,

1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:52.220
 now they're gonna call me a racist if I'm a white person.

1:48:52.220 --> 1:48:54.180
 I can't even use the word Negro,

1:48:54.180 --> 1:48:57.580
 which is a historically legitimate reference

1:48:57.580 --> 1:49:01.740
 to the descendants of the enslaved people,

1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:05.460
 which we were as black Americans proud to use until yesterday.

1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:11.580
 So all of this linguistic policing is a sign of weakness.

1:49:12.060 --> 1:49:15.500
 It's false black power.

1:49:15.500 --> 1:49:17.140
 People will seed you the ground.

1:49:17.140 --> 1:49:18.380
 Okay, you don't want me to use that word?

1:49:18.380 --> 1:49:19.380
 I won't use that word anymore.

1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:21.260
 Okay, you don't want me to talk about that in public?

1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:23.580
 All right, I won't talk about it in public anymore.

1:49:23.580 --> 1:49:25.020
 I don't wanna be called a racist, okay?

1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:26.780
 So I won't express my opinion.

1:49:26.780 --> 1:49:28.580
 You haven't changed anybody's mind.

1:49:31.100 --> 1:49:34.460
 And you've also mentioned that for that,

1:49:34.460 --> 1:49:35.940
 you haven't changed anybody's mind,

1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:40.180
 but also for things like in universities and institutions,

1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:42.900
 there's a diversity inclusion

1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:46.660
 and equity kind of meetings and education and so on.

1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:48.460
 And I believe I read somewhere,

1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:50.940
 I've been, like I mentioned to you offline,

1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:55.020
 big fan of your Glenn show, people should listen to it.

1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:56.820
 It's amazing.

1:49:56.820 --> 1:49:59.620
 There's also just interviews of you that I've listened to.

1:49:59.620 --> 1:50:00.660
 I believe you mentioned somewhere

1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:02.580
 that even those kinds of meetings,

1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:05.780
 people might sit through and nod along,

1:50:05.780 --> 1:50:09.620
 but that doesn't necessarily mean that's making progress,

1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:14.620
 that they may actually be bottling up a frustration.

1:50:15.460 --> 1:50:17.540
 The fear is that that's going to result

1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:22.540
 in a pendulum sort of push back towards this idea

1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:27.540
 of forced appreciations, like forced anti racism kind of thing.

1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:32.780
 I talk about this often in my podcast,

1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:36.100
 that's the Glenn show, you can find the Glenn show

1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:38.820
 on my YouTube channel and also at Substack.

1:50:39.860 --> 1:50:41.540
 Yeah, you have a great Substack.

1:50:41.540 --> 1:50:43.660
 You and your friend do Q and As

1:50:43.660 --> 1:50:45.700
 and all that kind of stuff on Patreon.

1:50:45.700 --> 1:50:46.540
 Yeah.

1:50:46.540 --> 1:50:48.300
 So yeah, so people should definitely follow you.

1:50:48.300 --> 1:50:49.540
 It's a brilliant conversation.

1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:50.380
 Check us out.

1:50:50.380 --> 1:50:55.380
 But yeah, I mean, one concern is that the policing,

1:50:56.780 --> 1:50:58.340
 the superficial policing,

1:50:58.340 --> 1:51:00.140
 this is a part of political correctness,

1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:02.260
 the insistence that you only use certain words,

1:51:02.260 --> 1:51:03.940
 that you only talk in a certain way,

1:51:03.940 --> 1:51:06.460
 is a phony kind of power

1:51:06.460 --> 1:51:08.220
 because it doesn't actually persuade people

1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:10.300
 about the issues that are at hand.

1:51:10.300 --> 1:51:12.900
 Instead, it forces them underground

1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:15.020
 in their talk about these issues,

1:51:15.020 --> 1:51:18.740
 and that's problematic.

1:51:18.740 --> 1:51:22.980
 Much better that we have overt and explicit

1:51:22.980 --> 1:51:25.420
 and honest disagreement

1:51:25.420 --> 1:51:27.820
 to the extent that there are disagreement

1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.700
 about things that are going on

1:51:29.700 --> 1:51:34.220
 than that we have a superficial kind of conversation

1:51:37.900 --> 1:51:42.540
 that is purged of any real biting,

1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:48.220
 discomforting confrontation with the realities

1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:49.500
 of the situation at hand.

1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:50.540
 And for black Americans,

1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:52.340
 I think one big part of the reality

1:51:52.340 --> 1:51:57.340
 of the situation at hand is violent crime, violent crime.

1:51:57.980 --> 1:52:00.780
 A police officer is afraid when he stops the car

1:52:00.780 --> 1:52:03.780
 because it's an 18 year old driver in the vehicle.

1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:05.100
 He's got dreadlocks.

1:52:05.100 --> 1:52:06.380
 He's a black person.

1:52:06.380 --> 1:52:08.900
 The car doesn't have the right license plate.

1:52:08.900 --> 1:52:11.900
 He's afraid to deal with that person.

1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:13.500
 And one of the reasons he's afraid to deal with them

1:52:13.500 --> 1:52:17.860
 is because a few who look like him are behaving violently.

1:52:17.860 --> 1:52:20.020
 Their violence is usually perpetrated

1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:23.540
 against others who look like themselves, but not always.

1:52:23.540 --> 1:52:27.460
 And that reality doesn't get changed

1:52:27.460 --> 1:52:32.460
 by telling a newspaper writer who writes about it

1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:36.340
 that they are racist or enforcing within a newsroom.

1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:38.380
 You can't cover that story in that way

1:52:38.380 --> 1:52:41.460
 because to do so would be racist.

1:52:41.460 --> 1:52:45.820
 I think it's a monumental mistake

1:52:45.820 --> 1:52:50.820
 to enforce a closure on public discussion

1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:55.940
 based upon a calculation that if we allow people,

1:52:55.940 --> 1:52:58.780
 if Twitter allows this kind of post,

1:52:58.780 --> 1:53:03.740
 if the Washington Post runs this kind of story, et cetera,

1:53:03.740 --> 1:53:08.740
 you end up with a superficial politeness,

1:53:08.740 --> 1:53:12.700
 a superficial politeness,

1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:17.420
 but a subterranean seething resentment

1:53:17.420 --> 1:53:19.600
 that only makes matters worse.

1:53:21.220 --> 1:53:24.500
 If I can get your comment, maybe you have ideas

1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:28.500
 because it does seem that this kind of attack works

1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:33.500
 of being called a racist, being called, maybe not sexist,

1:53:38.980 --> 1:53:42.860
 but somebody, like we're going through a Johnny Depp trial

1:53:42.860 --> 1:53:44.260
 now, right?

1:53:44.260 --> 1:53:47.420
 It's a defamation trial, and the reason it's a defamation

1:53:47.420 --> 1:53:50.740
 trial is because all it took is a single accusation

1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:54.340
 of Johnny Depp being somebody who sexually

1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:56.660
 and physically abused Amber Heard.

1:53:56.660 --> 1:53:59.500
 And all it took is just a single article.

1:53:59.500 --> 1:54:04.500
 No proof was given except the accusation itself,

1:54:04.780 --> 1:54:06.780
 and the world believed it.

1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:09.580
 So it's effective.

1:54:09.580 --> 1:54:13.180
 So how do you fight back if it's so damn effective

1:54:13.180 --> 1:54:15.380
 that you can just call anybody racist?

1:54:15.380 --> 1:54:16.980
 And it works.

1:54:16.980 --> 1:54:18.300
 It's hard to wash off.

1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:25.300
 It's, you're not proven in the court of law

1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:32.060
 or anything like that, but we get those articles,

1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:35.020
 we get that label, and then the world moves on

1:54:35.020 --> 1:54:37.340
 and just assumes that person is racist.

1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:41.060
 So how do you, do you have any ideas how to fight back?

1:54:41.060 --> 1:54:42.300
 No, I don't, frankly.

1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:44.660
 Just highlighting the fact.

1:54:44.660 --> 1:54:46.780
 Listen, Roseanne Barr, who made this statement

1:54:46.780 --> 1:54:49.500
 about Valerie Jarrett, she made some kind of ape

1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:51.660
 like reference to the whatever, and her show

1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.780
 got canceled, and she's a racist.

1:54:54.780 --> 1:54:56.940
 So first of all, pointing it out, I suppose,

1:54:56.940 --> 1:54:59.460
 is one of the most powerful things that this,

1:54:59.460 --> 1:55:02.980
 the hypocrisy of it, the.

1:55:04.220 --> 1:55:06.780
 You say it works, I guess you're right.

1:55:06.780 --> 1:55:09.980
 It used to be that calling someone a communist worked.

1:55:09.980 --> 1:55:13.900
 I mean, going back to the late 40s, early 50s,

1:55:13.900 --> 1:55:18.060
 Red Scare, McCarthyism, and whatnot,

1:55:18.060 --> 1:55:21.900
 and the person might've belonged to a club

1:55:21.900 --> 1:55:24.780
 that was pro Soviet Union in the 1930s

1:55:24.780 --> 1:55:25.940
 when they were in college.

1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:28.180
 They might've voted for the socialist candidate,

1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:31.980
 Henry Wallace, in the presidential election of 1948.

1:55:31.980 --> 1:55:33.940
 They might belong to the Communist Party.

1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:37.300
 They might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot

1:55:37.300 --> 1:55:39.580
 of stuff about capitalism and whatnot,

1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:42.380
 and they got called a communist or a Marxist,

1:55:42.380 --> 1:55:43.940
 and it could've ruined their career,

1:55:43.940 --> 1:55:45.380
 could've ruined their lives.

1:55:47.580 --> 1:55:49.620
 And a lot of people shut up about it,

1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:51.940
 and it took, and it went on for a long time.

1:55:53.220 --> 1:55:56.900
 And in a way, it kind of still is going on.

1:55:56.900 --> 1:55:58.700
 I mean, you call somebody a Marxist,

1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:01.340
 if you can make that stick, they're certainly not gonna

1:56:01.340 --> 1:56:03.580
 get elected president of the United States.

1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:06.300
 But I don't know about this.

1:56:07.180 --> 1:56:10.700
 I think, you know, I once read this book

1:56:10.700 --> 1:56:13.780
 by a German political scientist

1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:16.780
 called Elisabeth Neula Neumann.

1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:21.780
 That was the writer's name, Elisabeth Neula Neumann.

1:56:21.940 --> 1:56:24.540
 The book was called The Spiral of Silence.

1:56:25.900 --> 1:56:30.020
 And the argument was there can be some views,

1:56:30.020 --> 1:56:34.100
 some issues in society that get defined

1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:37.300
 in such a way that it's inappropriate to hold those views.

1:56:37.300 --> 1:56:39.900
 And as a result, people who don't want to be shamed,

1:56:39.900 --> 1:56:44.900
 who don't want to be ostracized don't express those views.

1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:46.460
 And when they don't express them,

1:56:46.460 --> 1:56:48.980
 anybody holding the view because they don't hear it

1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.860
 said by others think that they're the only one

1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:53.220
 and one of the few who hold the view,

1:56:53.220 --> 1:56:55.300
 and so they don't want to be the only one

1:56:55.300 --> 1:56:58.140
 out there saying something, so they keep it to themselves.

1:56:58.140 --> 1:57:02.780
 So now this view, this attitude in society

1:57:02.780 --> 1:57:05.540
 could be held by a large number of people,

1:57:05.540 --> 1:57:10.540
 but because of the fear that if they were to express it,

1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:15.020
 they'd be ostracized, no one says it.

1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:16.820
 And since no one is saying it,

1:57:16.820 --> 1:57:18.980
 the others who hold the view don't know

1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:20.220
 that they're not alone,

1:57:21.140 --> 1:57:24.420
 that they are not the only ones who hold the view.

1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:25.700
 And hence they keep silent.

1:57:25.700 --> 1:57:26.740
 That could be an equilibrium.

1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:29.540
 It could be a relatively stable situation

1:57:29.540 --> 1:57:32.020
 in which the emperor has no clothes.

1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:36.660
 Everybody can see that this dude is naked, okay?

1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:39.220
 But everybody thinks that, you know,

1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:41.100
 I don't want to be the only one to say it.

1:57:41.100 --> 1:57:44.740
 And so we all kind of collaborate in this charade

1:57:45.620 --> 1:57:47.340
 of keeping the view to ourselves.

1:57:48.580 --> 1:57:53.580
 Then along comes an event that somebody decides

1:57:54.700 --> 1:57:59.700
 to defy the consensus and to speak out.

1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:01.980
 It could be a little kid who in the story

1:58:01.980 --> 1:58:03.180
 about the emperor has no clothes,

1:58:03.180 --> 1:58:05.860
 doesn't realize that he's not supposed to say

1:58:05.860 --> 1:58:07.860
 that the emperor is naked.

1:58:07.860 --> 1:58:09.900
 The thing about the kid in the story

1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:11.220
 who says that the emperor is naked,

1:58:11.220 --> 1:58:12.740
 it's not that he's saying it.

1:58:14.180 --> 1:58:17.420
 It's not even that other people hear him saying it.

1:58:17.420 --> 1:58:19.100
 It's that everybody knows

1:58:19.100 --> 1:58:22.940
 that everybody else heard him say it, okay?

1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:27.020
 The kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes

1:58:27.020 --> 1:58:30.020
 creates a circumstance in which it's common knowledge

1:58:30.020 --> 1:58:31.260
 that the emperor has no clothes.

1:58:31.260 --> 1:58:33.940
 Now common knowledge does not just mean knowledge.

1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:36.420
 It does not even mean widespread knowledge.

1:58:36.420 --> 1:58:38.420
 It means comprehensive knowledge

1:58:38.420 --> 1:58:42.460
 of other person's knowledge of the thing, okay?

1:58:42.460 --> 1:58:45.940
 So the spiral of silence is a equilibrium

1:58:45.940 --> 1:58:48.660
 that is susceptible to being undermined

1:58:49.740 --> 1:58:53.740
 by a process of a kind of cumulative process,

1:58:53.740 --> 1:58:56.220
 a snowballing process of revelation

1:58:56.220 --> 1:59:00.220
 that you're not the only one who thinks this way, okay?

1:59:00.220 --> 1:59:02.220
 It's fascinating to think that there's an ocean

1:59:02.220 --> 1:59:05.540
 of common knowledge that we're waiting for the little kid

1:59:05.540 --> 1:59:08.940
 to wake us up to, different little parts of it.

1:59:08.940 --> 1:59:09.780
 That's correct.

1:59:09.780 --> 1:59:10.700
 And the little kid, by the way,

1:59:10.700 --> 1:59:12.540
 could be somebody like Donald Trump,

1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:15.180
 only more effective than Donald Trump,

1:59:15.180 --> 1:59:17.260
 somebody who is smarter than Donald Trump,

1:59:17.260 --> 1:59:20.900
 somebody who is shrewder than Donald Trump,

1:59:20.900 --> 1:59:25.620
 somebody who figures out that when Colin Kaepernick

1:59:25.620 --> 1:59:29.100
 takes a knee at a football game and says,

1:59:29.100 --> 1:59:31.340
 I'm not gonna stand for this president allegiance,

1:59:31.340 --> 1:59:36.340
 that a vast number of people are very unhappy about that.

1:59:38.820 --> 1:59:39.780
 Somebody who understands

1:59:39.780 --> 1:59:43.180
 that when a Black Lives Matter activist

1:59:43.180 --> 1:59:44.980
 stands up with his ball of fists and says,

1:59:44.980 --> 1:59:47.380
 burn this bitch down about a city

1:59:47.380 --> 1:59:49.660
 in the United States of America,

1:59:49.660 --> 1:59:52.540
 that a lot of people are upset about that, a lot of them.

1:59:52.540 --> 1:59:54.820
 A person, a shrewd politician,

1:59:54.820 --> 1:59:58.700
 a shrewd manager of a public image

1:59:59.740 --> 2:00:02.860
 could build on and create a circumstance

2:00:02.860 --> 2:00:05.580
 in which more and more people will feel safe

2:00:06.940 --> 2:00:07.900
 to express that view.

2:00:07.900 --> 2:00:09.060
 And the more who express it,

2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:12.420
 the safer those who have yet to express it but who hold it

2:00:12.420 --> 2:00:13.940
 will feel in expressing it.

2:00:13.940 --> 2:00:17.060
 And to the extent that the view is very widespread

2:00:17.060 --> 2:00:21.020
 but is kept under wraps, an explosion could happen.

2:00:21.020 --> 2:00:23.060
 And you can look up tomorrow and have a very different

2:00:23.060 --> 2:00:25.460
 country than you had today

2:00:25.460 --> 2:00:30.460
 because the conspiracy of silence, the spiral of silence

2:00:30.740 --> 2:00:34.860
 ends up getting unraveled by somebody who steps out

2:00:34.860 --> 2:00:36.100
 away from the consensus,

2:00:36.100 --> 2:00:38.340
 dares to take the slings and arrows

2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:40.900
 of exposing themselves as a naysayer

2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:44.980
 but taps into a sentiment that's very widespread.

2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:49.700
 And I fear that with respect to many racial issues,

2:00:49.700 --> 2:00:53.940
 this is the situation that we actually confront,

2:00:53.940 --> 2:00:57.220
 that it could unravel in a very ugly way.

2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:00.100
 But it could also unravel in a beautiful way.

2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:02.260
 So it's depending.

2:01:02.260 --> 2:01:04.300
 There is a spiral of silence, you're saying,

2:01:04.300 --> 2:01:07.820
 and it could be, speaking of children,

2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:11.940
 charismatic children, there's a guy named Elon Musk

2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:16.860
 who might be a candidate for such an unraveling, right?

2:01:16.860 --> 2:01:20.060
 You mentioned the person that speaks out

2:01:20.060 --> 2:01:21.140
 could be a Donald Trump.

2:01:21.140 --> 2:01:23.900
 But in this current situation that we live in,

2:01:23.900 --> 2:01:28.260
 like as this week, Elon has purchased Twitter.

2:01:28.260 --> 2:01:29.420
 That's what I hear.

2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:34.300
 And is pushing for, in all kinds of ways,

2:01:34.300 --> 2:01:37.460
 the increase of free speech on Twitter.

2:01:37.460 --> 2:01:40.460
 And speaking about some of the issues

2:01:40.460 --> 2:01:44.500
 that we've been speaking about here with you,

2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:47.940
 but maybe in broader strokes about just the fact

2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:50.660
 that you have to, it's okay to point out

2:01:50.660 --> 2:01:52.900
 that the emperor wears no clothes,

2:01:52.900 --> 2:01:55.940
 and to do so from all sides in a way

2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:57.740
 that everybody's a little bit pissed off,

2:01:57.740 --> 2:01:58.860
 but not too much.

2:01:59.820 --> 2:02:01.540
 What do you think about this whole effort

2:02:01.540 --> 2:02:06.020
 of free speech in these public platforms?

2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:10.280
 Elon in particular, Twitter, your avid Twitter user.

2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:14.340
 But just public platforms for discourse,

2:02:14.340 --> 2:02:18.860
 for us as a civilization to figure stuff out.

2:02:18.860 --> 2:02:21.780
 Yeah, well, the people on the left

2:02:21.780 --> 2:02:23.620
 are very upset about the possibility

2:02:23.620 --> 2:02:28.140
 that Elon Musk and Twitter will be open to,

2:02:28.140 --> 2:02:33.140
 more open to provocative public speech

2:02:33.180 --> 2:02:37.340
 that has heretofore been banned or suppressed.

2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:41.520
 And I think they might be right to be concerned

2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:43.000
 that that could happen.

2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.300
 I don't know enough about the technology

2:02:45.300 --> 2:02:47.740
 and about the market to really,

2:02:47.740 --> 2:02:50.460
 I mean, social media and whatnot,

2:02:50.460 --> 2:02:53.720
 it seems like it's a complicated system

2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:56.380
 of interactions between people and who the users are

2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:57.560
 and so forth and so on.

2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:02.500
 I do know that that New York Post story

2:03:02.500 --> 2:03:06.340
 about Hunter Biden's laptop was real news

2:03:06.340 --> 2:03:08.940
 and could have affected the outcome of the election,

2:03:08.940 --> 2:03:10.540
 and it was suppressed,

2:03:10.540 --> 2:03:14.380
 and that Twitter had a role in suppressing it.

2:03:14.380 --> 2:03:18.560
 I do know that the question of where the COVID 19 virus

2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:22.300
 originated and the role that a lab leak account

2:03:22.300 --> 2:03:26.280
 could have played in the public processing of that event

2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:29.360
 was real news, and that it was suppressed

2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:32.500
 by people who were trying to control misinformation,

2:03:32.500 --> 2:03:36.140
 disinformation, Russian disinformation campaigns

2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:36.980
 and whatnot.

2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:40.780
 So Twitter has users, I'm one of them,

2:03:40.780 --> 2:03:42.120
 and it has a lot of users.

2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:43.820
 It's not as big as Facebook, I gather.

2:03:43.820 --> 2:03:46.780
 It's not, but it's important,

2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:51.780
 the ability to construct counter platforms,

2:03:51.940 --> 2:03:53.660
 people moving around and whatnot.

2:03:54.900 --> 2:03:56.460
 It's a kind of network dynamic

2:03:56.460 --> 2:03:58.500
 that maybe I should understand it better than I do

2:03:58.500 --> 2:04:00.260
 being a social scientist, but.

2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:01.860
 I don't think anyone understands it,

2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:05.460
 even people inside Twitter, which is fascinating.

2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:09.420
 It's a monster because of just the bandwidth of messaging,

2:04:09.420 --> 2:04:12.660
 and you don't know who is a bot and who is a human.

2:04:12.660 --> 2:04:14.340
 That's a fascinating dynamic,

2:04:15.580 --> 2:04:19.120
 and the viral nature of negativity.

2:04:20.940 --> 2:04:22.780
 All of those dynamics, of course,

2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:25.700
 you are probably the right person to understand it

2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.100
 from a social scientist perspective,

2:04:28.100 --> 2:04:29.980
 from an economics perspective,

2:04:29.980 --> 2:04:31.860
 but nobody really understands,

2:04:31.860 --> 2:04:34.780
 and it's fascinating within that domain,

2:04:34.780 --> 2:04:38.900
 how do you allow for free speech,

2:04:38.900 --> 2:04:41.520
 not allow for free speech, encourage free speech,

2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.300
 defend free speech, and at the same time,

2:04:45.300 --> 2:04:49.260
 manage millions of ongoing conversations

2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:54.260
 from just becoming insanely chaotic.

2:04:56.340 --> 2:04:58.680
 Sort of from Twitter perspective,

2:04:58.680 --> 2:05:02.020
 they want people to be happy, to grow,

2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:05.380
 to actually have difficult, critical conversations,

2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:08.240
 and the problem with humans is they think

2:05:08.240 --> 2:05:12.260
 they know what that is, and they think

2:05:12.260 --> 2:05:14.300
 they can label things as misinformation,

2:05:14.300 --> 2:05:18.780
 as counterproductive or healthy conversations, in quotes,

2:05:18.780 --> 2:05:22.100
 and the problem is, as we are learning,

2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:25.280
 humans are not able to do that effectively.

2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:27.780
 First of all, power corrupts.

2:05:27.780 --> 2:05:30.900
 There's something delicious about having the power

2:05:30.900 --> 2:05:33.180
 to label something as misinformation.

2:05:33.180 --> 2:05:35.800
 You do that once for something

2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:37.940
 that might be obviously misinformation,

2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:39.780
 and then you start getting greedy.

2:05:39.780 --> 2:05:40.940
 You start getting excited.

2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:41.860
 It feels good.

2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:43.980
 It feels good to label something

2:05:43.980 --> 2:05:46.660
 as misinformation or disinformation

2:05:46.660 --> 2:05:49.940
 that you just don't like, and over time,

2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:52.460
 especially if there's a culture inside of a company

2:05:52.460 --> 2:05:55.140
 that leans a certain political direction

2:05:55.140 --> 2:05:57.540
 or leans, in all the groups that we talked about,

2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:59.800
 leans a certain way, they'll start

2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:03.580
 to label as misinformation things they just don't like,

2:06:03.580 --> 2:06:07.540
 and that power is delicious, and it corrupts.

2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:08.980
 You have to construct mechanisms,

2:06:08.980 --> 2:06:10.580
 like the Founding Fathers did,

2:06:10.580 --> 2:06:14.300
 for somehow preventing you from allowing

2:06:14.300 --> 2:06:15.900
 that power to get too delicious.

2:06:17.860 --> 2:06:19.660
 At least that's my perspective on what's going on.

2:06:19.660 --> 2:06:21.260
 Well, I'll just tell you personally,

2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:23.340
 I'm excited about the prospect.

2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:25.860
 I'm glad to see Musk making the move that he's making,

2:06:25.860 --> 2:06:29.100
 and we'll see what happens at Twitter and so forth.

2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:33.180
 You're looking forward for the, what did he say?

2:06:33.180 --> 2:06:35.140
 Let's make Twitter more fun.

2:06:35.140 --> 2:06:38.180
 I'm looking forward to the fun.

2:06:39.180 --> 2:06:43.220
 You've talked about you are at a prestigious university.

2:06:43.220 --> 2:06:44.220
 Brown University.

2:06:44.220 --> 2:06:48.060
 Brown University, and you've mentioned

2:06:48.060 --> 2:06:50.220
 that universities might be in trouble.

2:06:50.220 --> 2:06:52.420
 I think it's with Jordan, but everywhere else,

2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:54.940
 that barbarians are at the gate.

2:06:54.940 --> 2:06:59.700
 Who are the barbarians at the gate of the university?

2:06:59.700 --> 2:07:03.500
 So first of all, what is to you beautiful

2:07:03.500 --> 2:07:08.500
 about the ideal of the university in America, of academia?

2:07:09.260 --> 2:07:12.100
 And what is a threat?

2:07:12.100 --> 2:07:15.260
 Well, you know, a university is dedicated

2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:20.260
 to the pursuit of truth, and to the education

2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:24.460
 and nurturing of young people as they enter

2:07:24.460 --> 2:07:29.460
 into the pursuit of truth, to doing research and to teaching

2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:34.700
 in a environment of free inquiry and civil discourse.

2:07:37.020 --> 2:07:40.860
 So free inquiry means you go wherever the evidence

2:07:40.860 --> 2:07:43.540
 and your imagination may lead you.

2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:46.500
 And civil discourse means that you exchange arguments

2:07:46.500 --> 2:07:48.140
 with people when you don't agree with them

2:07:48.140 --> 2:07:50.740
 on behalf of trying to get to the bottom of things.

2:07:50.740 --> 2:07:55.220
 I think the university is a magnificent institution.

2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:59.220
 It is a relatively modern institution.

2:07:59.220 --> 2:08:01.580
 I mean, last 500 years or so.

2:08:01.580 --> 2:08:03.500
 I mean, there are universities that are older than that,

2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:07.260
 but the great research universities of the world,

2:08:07.260 --> 2:08:09.820
 not only here in the United States,

2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:14.340
 are places where human ingenuity is nurtured,

2:08:14.340 --> 2:08:16.780
 where new lot knowledge is created,

2:08:16.780 --> 2:08:21.780
 and where young people are equipped to answer questions

2:08:21.780 --> 2:08:25.260
 that are open questions about our existence

2:08:25.260 --> 2:08:26.940
 in the world that we live in.

2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:30.020
 You can trace to the university much,

2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:33.940
 if not most, of the advances in technology

2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:35.780
 and resourcefulness and our understanding

2:08:35.780 --> 2:08:38.740
 of the origins of the species, of the nature of the universe,

2:08:38.740 --> 2:08:41.540
 cosmology, et cetera, science,

2:08:41.540 --> 2:08:44.740
 the pursuit of humanistic understanding,

2:08:44.740 --> 2:08:47.460
 the nurturing of traditions of inquiry,

2:08:47.460 --> 2:08:49.740
 so forth, so that's the university.

2:08:49.740 --> 2:08:51.140
 Barbarians are at the gates.

2:08:52.260 --> 2:08:55.420
 The people who are trying to shut down open inquiry

2:08:55.420 --> 2:08:58.460
 at the university on behalf of their particular view

2:08:58.460 --> 2:09:03.460
 about things are a threat to what the university stands for,

2:09:03.780 --> 2:09:05.740
 and they should be resisted.

2:09:05.740 --> 2:09:10.740
 So if I'm inquiring about the nature of human intelligence,

2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:13.740
 and I wanna study differences between human populations

2:09:13.740 --> 2:09:15.580
 and their acquisition of,

2:09:15.580 --> 2:09:19.540
 or their expression of cognitive ability,

2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:22.180
 that's fair game, it's an open question.

2:09:22.180 --> 2:09:24.780
 If I wanna know something about the nature

2:09:24.780 --> 2:09:28.780
 of gender affiliation and identity

2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:32.180
 and gender dysphoria and whatnot,

2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:34.100
 that's fair game to study in a university.

2:09:34.100 --> 2:09:37.580
 You can't shut that down, you shouldn't be able to,

2:09:37.580 --> 2:09:41.740
 by saying, I have a particular position here,

2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:43.540
 I'm a member of a particular identity group,

2:09:43.540 --> 2:09:47.580
 suppose I wanna study the history of colonialism,

2:09:47.580 --> 2:09:51.140
 and there's a narrative on the progressive side,

2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:54.220
 which is colonialism is about Europeans dominating

2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:55.620
 and stealing or whatever, whatever,

2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:58.140
 and I happen to think, well, there's another aspect

2:09:58.140 --> 2:09:59.660
 to the story about colonialism too,

2:09:59.660 --> 2:10:02.740
 which is that it's a mechanism for the diffusion

2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:05.340
 of the best in human civilization to populations

2:10:05.340 --> 2:10:08.860
 that were significantly lagging behind with respect to that.

2:10:08.860 --> 2:10:12.980
 It brought literacy to the Southern hemispheric populations

2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:16.780
 that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing.

2:10:16.780 --> 2:10:17.940
 It's complicated.

2:10:17.940 --> 2:10:19.980
 I'm not taking that position, by the way.

2:10:19.980 --> 2:10:22.460
 I'm just saying somebody at a university

2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:26.180
 should be able to take it up and pursue it

2:10:26.180 --> 2:10:28.020
 and engage in argument with people about it.

2:10:28.020 --> 2:10:29.540
 I'm talking about race and ethnicity,

2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:32.340
 but this extends to a wide range of things.

2:10:32.340 --> 2:10:33.660
 Suppose we're talking about race,

2:10:33.660 --> 2:10:36.700
 a wide range of things, suppose we're talking about climate,

2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:38.780
 and one person says the earth is endangered

2:10:38.780 --> 2:10:42.580
 because carbon in global warming, et cetera, et cetera,

2:10:42.580 --> 2:10:44.820
 and another person says, no, wait, no, wait,

2:10:45.940 --> 2:10:48.180
 look at where we stand in the 21st century.

2:10:48.180 --> 2:10:51.460
 We're vastly richer than our ancestors just 250 years ago.

2:10:51.460 --> 2:10:53.260
 We have much more knowledge about that

2:10:53.260 --> 2:10:54.100
 and so forth and so on.

2:10:54.100 --> 2:10:59.100
 250 years from now, human ingenuity will have devised

2:10:59.300 --> 2:11:02.820
 in ways that we can not even begin to anticipate.

2:11:02.820 --> 2:11:07.820
 All manner of technological means for managing the problem.

2:11:09.060 --> 2:11:11.420
 There's no reason that we should shut down

2:11:11.420 --> 2:11:14.340
 industrial civilization today

2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:16.940
 because we fear the consequences of it

2:11:16.940 --> 2:11:20.500
 when in fact we are vastly richer than our ancestors

2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:22.340
 and those who come two centuries after us

2:11:22.340 --> 2:11:24.820
 will be vastly more effective

2:11:24.820 --> 2:11:27.260
 at dealing with problems than we are now.

2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:28.620
 Let's, et cetera.

2:11:28.620 --> 2:11:30.820
 I'm not actually making that argument.

2:11:30.820 --> 2:11:35.340
 I'm just saying the tendency to try to say, oh, no,

2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:36.940
 that person is a climate denier.

2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:40.260
 They can't pursue that area of inquiry

2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:44.420
 is against the spirit of the university.

2:11:44.420 --> 2:11:47.100
 I think the barbarians at the gates

2:11:47.100 --> 2:11:50.460
 has to do with the people who think they know

2:11:50.460 --> 2:11:52.100
 what the right side of history is

2:11:52.100 --> 2:11:54.180
 and try to make the university stand

2:11:54.180 --> 2:11:55.580
 on the right side of history.

2:11:56.540 --> 2:11:58.660
 My position is you don't know

2:11:58.660 --> 2:12:01.180
 what the right side of history is.

2:12:01.180 --> 2:12:03.740
 And the purpose of a university is to equip you

2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:07.740
 to be able to think about what is the right side of history.

2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:11.940
 What is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us

2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:14.500
 as human beings living on this planet

2:12:14.500 --> 2:12:17.780
 with the billions that we are in the condition that we are.

2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:22.500
 So the identitarians,

2:12:22.500 --> 2:12:25.820
 the ones who wanna make the university kowtow

2:12:25.820 --> 2:12:30.460
 to their particular understandings about their own identity.

2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:36.180
 We now have at Brown University and various other places,

2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:38.380
 we don't do Columbus Day anymore.

2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:40.660
 We do Indigenous Peoples Day.

2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:42.980
 When that day comes up in October,

2:12:42.980 --> 2:12:44.380
 we don't talk about Columbus.

2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:46.020
 They're taking down statues of Columbus

2:12:46.020 --> 2:12:48.700
 all across the country and so forth and so on.

2:12:48.700 --> 2:12:50.980
 I'm not arguing anything here other than

2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:55.980
 that the latter day position

2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:03.540
 BIPOCs, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color,

2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:05.820
 the latter day position that the university

2:13:05.820 --> 2:13:09.460
 has to reflect a particular sensibility

2:13:09.460 --> 2:13:11.980
 about these identity questions.

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.860
 I think it's a threat to the integrity of the enterprise.

2:13:14.860 --> 2:13:16.580
 I don't think you're overstating it.

2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:21.580
 I tend to be, just from my limited knowledge of MIT,

2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:25.380
 but perhaps it applies broadly,

2:13:25.380 --> 2:13:29.940
 I think the beauty of the university, broadly speaking,

2:13:29.940 --> 2:13:31.980
 is the faculty and the students.

2:13:33.540 --> 2:13:38.540
 And the problem arises from the overreach

2:13:40.420 --> 2:13:43.980
 of a overgrowing administration

2:13:43.980 --> 2:13:48.980
 that gives, again, thinks that it knows enough

2:13:51.100 --> 2:13:56.100
 to make rules and conclusions based on a set of beliefs,

2:13:56.340 --> 2:14:00.180
 and then based on that, empowers a certain small selection

2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:04.860
 of students to be the sort of voices of activism,

2:14:04.860 --> 2:14:07.100
 of a particular idea.

2:14:07.100 --> 2:14:10.100
 And not, I think activism is beautiful,

2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:12.820
 but not just activism, but anybody that disagrees

2:14:12.820 --> 2:14:17.300
 is shut down, and that, I think,

2:14:17.300 --> 2:14:20.460
 the blame lies with the administration.

2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:23.220
 So I think the solution is in lessening,

2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:25.660
 just like the solution with too big of a government,

2:14:25.660 --> 2:14:28.460
 too big of a bureaucracy, is there needs to be

2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:34.660
 redistribution of power to what makes universities beautiful,

2:14:34.660 --> 2:14:38.820
 which is the old students and the young students,

2:14:38.820 --> 2:14:42.220
 old students being professors.

2:14:42.220 --> 2:14:45.900
 So the scholars, the curious minds,

2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:48.140
 the people that are in this whole thing

2:14:48.140 --> 2:14:51.180
 to explore the world, to be curious about it,

2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:53.340
 on a salary that's probably way too low

2:14:53.340 --> 2:14:54.700
 for the thing they're doing.

2:14:54.700 --> 2:14:57.020
 That's the whole point.

2:14:57.020 --> 2:15:01.100
 And then the administration just gets in the way,

2:15:01.100 --> 2:15:05.780
 and is the source of this kind of,

2:15:05.780 --> 2:15:08.980
 I would say that, in your beautiful phrasing,

2:15:08.980 --> 2:15:10.460
 I would say the administration

2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:12.180
 is the barbarians at the gate.

2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:15.420
 So the solution is smaller bureaucracy,

2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:16.860
 smaller administrations.

2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:18.920
 I have to, on this point, you had this conversation,

2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:23.160
 you put on your self stack with Jordan Peterson

2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.380
 about cognitive inequality.

2:15:25.380 --> 2:15:28.340
 I think it's titled Wrestling with Cognitive Inequality.

2:15:29.540 --> 2:15:33.340
 This particular topic of just IQ differences

2:15:33.340 --> 2:15:36.180
 between groups, why is this,

2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:39.240
 why is it so dangerous to talk about?

2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:42.880
 Why this particular topic?

2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:45.080
 Well, it's like you're calling black people inferior.

2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.920
 It's like you're saying they're genetically inferior.

2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:48.560
 That's what people are saying.

2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:51.840
 It's like you're rationalizing the disparity of outcomes

2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:55.960
 by reference to the intrinsic inferiority of black people.

2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:00.960
 If you say cognitive ability matters for social outcomes,

2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.660
 if you say cognitive ability exists,

2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:04.680
 people really are different

2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:07.240
 in terms of their intellectual functioning.

2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:09.920
 And if you say cognitive ability differences

2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:14.920
 are substantial between racially defined populations,

2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.200
 the sum of that, there is cognitive ability,

2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.260
 it matters, and the difference by race

2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:22.720
 is the conclusion that outcome differences by race

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.240
 are in part due to natural differences

2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:28.000
 between the populations.

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.800
 People find that to be completely offensive

2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:32.200
 and unacceptable.

2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:34.040
 So that's what I think is going on.

2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:37.240
 Can you steel me on that case

2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:40.620
 that we should be careful doing that kind of research?

2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:46.480
 So this has to do with research.

2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:51.500
 It's like the Nazis used Nietzsche in their propaganda.

2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:58.500
 You can use, white supremacists could use conclusions,

2:16:58.500 --> 2:17:03.500
 cherry pick conclusions of studies to push their agenda.

2:17:04.900 --> 2:17:07.060
 Can you steel me on the case that we should be careful?

2:17:07.060 --> 2:17:08.540
 Yeah, I could do it at three levels.

2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:11.500
 One is what do we mean by cognitive ability?

2:17:11.500 --> 2:17:13.660
 So there's many different kinds of intelligence

2:17:13.660 --> 2:17:15.380
 a person might say.

2:17:15.380 --> 2:17:18.260
 How good are IQ tests at measuring

2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:20.760
 other kinds of human capacities

2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:24.220
 that are pertinent to success in life,

2:17:24.220 --> 2:17:27.680
 like temperament, like emotional intelligence, and so on.

2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:31.020
 So intelligence is not a one dimensional thing

2:17:31.020 --> 2:17:32.700
 measured by G.

2:17:32.700 --> 2:17:36.060
 The cognitive psychologists talk about G,

2:17:36.060 --> 2:17:38.500
 the general intelligence factor,

2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:41.460
 which is a statistical construction.

2:17:41.460 --> 2:17:44.620
 It's a factor analytic resolution

2:17:44.620 --> 2:17:48.340
 of the correlation across individuals

2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:49.780
 in their performance on a battery,

2:17:49.780 --> 2:17:50.780
 a different kind of test.

2:17:50.780 --> 2:17:55.780
 And they use that to define a general factor of intelligence

2:17:55.780 --> 2:17:59.900
 that a person could say that is a very narrow view

2:17:59.900 --> 2:18:04.780
 of what human mental capacities actually are.

2:18:04.780 --> 2:18:07.900
 And that it's much better to think about

2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:12.540
 multi dimensional measures of human mental functioning

2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:15.340
 rather than a single cognitive ability measure,

2:18:15.340 --> 2:18:20.340
 so called IQ, which is a narrow construction

2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:25.340
 that doesn't capture all of the subtle nuance

2:18:26.340 --> 2:18:28.280
 of human difference in functioning.

2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:30.560
 Functioning is not just the ability

2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:34.800
 to recite backwards a sequence of numbers.

2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:37.040
 I say eight, seven, nine, five, three, two.

2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:40.040
 You say two, three, five, seven, eight, nine.

2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:40.960
 It's not just that.

2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:45.960
 Intelligence is a complex management

2:18:47.360 --> 2:18:49.600
 of many different dimensions of human performance,

2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:54.600
 including things like being able to stick with a task

2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:58.840
 and not give up, things like being able to discipline

2:18:58.840 --> 2:19:02.080
 and control your impulses so as to remain focused

2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:03.560
 and so forth.

2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:04.620
 That could be one dimension.

2:19:04.620 --> 2:19:07.560
 I could start by questioning the very foundation

2:19:07.560 --> 2:19:12.560
 of the argument for racial differences in cognitive ability

2:19:13.220 --> 2:19:18.220
 by saying that your measure of cognitive ability is flawed.

2:19:18.220 --> 2:19:19.700
 I could go to a higher level.

2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:23.740
 I could say what we're really interested in

2:19:23.740 --> 2:19:28.740
 is social outcomes and the question of what factors

2:19:28.900 --> 2:19:32.420
 influence social outcomes extends well beyond mental ability

2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:33.860
 to many other things.

2:19:33.860 --> 2:19:35.300
 So here's an example.

2:19:37.940 --> 2:19:41.900
 Visual acuity, how well do you see?

2:19:41.900 --> 2:19:43.820
 You're not wearing glasses, I am.

2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:48.820
 Visual acuity varies between human beings.

2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:52.180
 Some people see better than other people do.

2:19:52.180 --> 2:19:54.660
 Visual acuity can be measured.

2:19:54.660 --> 2:19:57.020
 I can put you at the chart and you can,

2:19:57.020 --> 2:19:58.780
 can you identify and read that bottom line

2:19:58.780 --> 2:20:00.260
 in small print or not?

2:20:00.260 --> 2:20:02.060
 So we can measure visual acuity

2:20:02.060 --> 2:20:04.020
 and it varies between human beings.

2:20:04.020 --> 2:20:07.500
 Visual acuity is partly genetic.

2:20:07.500 --> 2:20:09.860
 I think that's undoubtedly true.

2:20:09.860 --> 2:20:12.220
 We inherit genes that influence whether or not

2:20:12.220 --> 2:20:15.900
 we are nearsighted or farsighted or astigmatic or whatever.

2:20:15.900 --> 2:20:19.660
 So visual acuity differs between people

2:20:19.660 --> 2:20:23.740
 and can be measured and is under genetic control.

2:20:23.740 --> 2:20:28.060
 On the other hand, corrective lenses allow for us

2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:29.740
 to level the playing field between people

2:20:29.740 --> 2:20:34.140
 who are differently endowed in terms of visual acuity.

2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:37.500
 Likewise, social outcomes are what we're really interested in

2:20:37.500 --> 2:20:41.620
 employment, earnings, whether or not they're law abiding,

2:20:41.620 --> 2:20:43.580
 how do they conduct themselves and their families

2:20:43.580 --> 2:20:45.700
 and so forth amongst individuals.

2:20:45.700 --> 2:20:47.940
 Yes, social outcomes are influenced

2:20:47.940 --> 2:20:49.620
 by so called cognitive ability,

2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:52.340
 but they're influenced by many other things as well.

2:20:52.340 --> 2:20:56.660
 If there are interventions that can be undertaken in society

2:20:56.660 --> 2:20:58.900
 that level the playing field between people

2:20:58.900 --> 2:21:02.020
 who have different natural endowments of cognitive ability,

2:21:02.020 --> 2:21:05.860
 the fact that people or groups differ in cognitive ability

2:21:05.860 --> 2:21:07.540
 becomes less significant.

2:21:07.540 --> 2:21:10.140
 Just like it's less significant that people differ

2:21:10.140 --> 2:21:12.180
 with respect to how well they see

2:21:12.180 --> 2:21:14.420
 when corrective lenses allow

2:21:14.420 --> 2:21:16.940
 for the leveling of that playing field.

2:21:16.940 --> 2:21:20.740
 There are in fact interventions, educational interventions,

2:21:20.740 --> 2:21:23.740
 early childhood interventions that have been shown

2:21:23.740 --> 2:21:25.260
 to level the playing field

2:21:25.260 --> 2:21:27.220
 to create better life outcomes for people

2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:30.980
 even if they happen to be endowed with low intelligence.

2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:35.340
 So a second level of arguing against this whole program

2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:38.220
 of research on human differences and intelligence

2:21:38.220 --> 2:21:40.340
 is to observe that yes, human beings

2:21:40.340 --> 2:21:42.700
 and perhaps racially defined groups

2:21:42.700 --> 2:21:46.580
 may differ on the average in intellectual endowment,

2:21:46.580 --> 2:21:49.100
 but there well may be social interventions

2:21:49.100 --> 2:21:50.620
 that level the playing field,

2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:51.980
 whether it's in education

2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:55.180
 or in other kinds of programmatic interventions,

2:21:55.180 --> 2:21:57.300
 especially for the poor.

2:21:57.300 --> 2:21:59.900
 A final level of argument is the one that you alluded to,

2:21:59.900 --> 2:22:02.100
 which is that if you talk like this,

2:22:02.100 --> 2:22:04.260
 you're gonna encourage a kind of politics

2:22:04.260 --> 2:22:05.940
 which is very ugly.

2:22:05.940 --> 2:22:09.740
 And it's best to frame the discussion

2:22:09.740 --> 2:22:11.700
 in ways that don't put emphasis

2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:16.700
 on racially defined natural differences between populations.

2:22:17.580 --> 2:22:21.380
 That's an argument that I am myself personally

2:22:22.700 --> 2:22:24.420
 conflicted about.

2:22:24.420 --> 2:22:27.260
 On the one hand, I think, you know,

2:22:27.260 --> 2:22:29.380
 those people are just stupid.

2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:32.940
 It is racist, okay?

2:22:32.940 --> 2:22:36.500
 On the other hand, I think the calculation,

2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:38.180
 we shouldn't do this kind of research.

2:22:38.180 --> 2:22:40.060
 Suppose I'm at the National Science Foundation,

2:22:40.060 --> 2:22:42.340
 a research team submits a proposal.

2:22:42.340 --> 2:22:44.780
 The proposal proposes to undertake a study.

2:22:44.780 --> 2:22:48.540
 The study would explore the extent to which people

2:22:48.540 --> 2:22:50.500
 and racial groups differ with respect

2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:52.500
 to their intellectual performance

2:22:52.500 --> 2:22:55.020
 and how that's influenced by their genetic

2:22:55.020 --> 2:22:56.860
 and environmental interaction.

2:22:56.860 --> 2:22:59.140
 And I decide not to fund the study

2:22:59.140 --> 2:23:01.820
 based on a political calculation

2:23:01.820 --> 2:23:04.580
 that the subject is too sensitive.

2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:06.580
 And if you explore that subject,

2:23:06.580 --> 2:23:08.260
 you might get the wrong answer.

2:23:08.260 --> 2:23:09.900
 And if you get the wrong answer,

2:23:09.900 --> 2:23:12.460
 the white supremacist will be encouraged.

2:23:12.460 --> 2:23:17.460
 Well, that is presuming before the research is done

2:23:17.740 --> 2:23:19.780
 that I know the outcome of the research

2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:23.060
 and that I can calculate what the political consequence

2:23:23.060 --> 2:23:25.260
 of the research outcome is gonna be.

2:23:25.260 --> 2:23:27.660
 That's assuming the thing before you even know

2:23:27.660 --> 2:23:28.940
 what the thing actually is.

2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:30.380
 It's a kind of omniscience.

2:23:30.380 --> 2:23:35.380
 It presumes that you as the master of the universe

2:23:35.620 --> 2:23:37.180
 can tell people what it is

2:23:37.180 --> 2:23:39.380
 that people are being treated like children,

2:23:39.380 --> 2:23:41.540
 what it is that they're capable of knowing

2:23:41.540 --> 2:23:44.060
 and what it is that they're not capable of knowing.

2:23:44.060 --> 2:23:47.460
 It would be like someone saying to Einstein,

2:23:47.460 --> 2:23:49.740
 I don't know about that special relativity theory.

2:23:49.740 --> 2:23:50.940
 You know, it could well lead

2:23:50.940 --> 2:23:53.140
 to the development of technologies

2:23:53.140 --> 2:23:54.420
 that would allow nuclear weapons.

2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:55.780
 Or someone saying to Oppenheimer,

2:23:55.780 --> 2:23:58.860
 who is a physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project

2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:02.180
 where the US developed a nuclear weapons capacity,

2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:04.180
 don't carry out that project

2:24:04.180 --> 2:24:08.300
 because the results of acquiring that knowledge

2:24:08.300 --> 2:24:10.420
 may be more than we can deal with.

2:24:10.420 --> 2:24:13.700
 Or someone saying to someone doing biomedical research

2:24:13.700 --> 2:24:18.700
 who's interested in exploring the nature of the human genome,

2:24:19.260 --> 2:24:20.900
 don't carry out that experiment,

2:24:20.900 --> 2:24:22.740
 that cloning, undertaking, whatever,

2:24:22.740 --> 2:24:26.020
 because the consequences could be deleterious.

2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:27.820
 Well, the consequences could be deleterious.

2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:30.220
 The consequences could also be the cure of cancer.

2:24:30.220 --> 2:24:32.140
 The consequences could also be

2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:33.740
 being able to generate electric power

2:24:33.740 --> 2:24:36.780
 without producing carbon effluent.

2:24:36.780 --> 2:24:38.940
 So who are you to tell me,

2:24:38.940 --> 2:24:42.140
 you being the person in the political position

2:24:42.140 --> 2:24:44.180
 to control the research,

2:24:44.180 --> 2:24:46.140
 what the consequence of doing the research is?

2:24:46.140 --> 2:24:50.860
 I think I don't want to cede that kind of power

2:24:50.860 --> 2:24:55.860
 to politicians over the course of human inquiry.

2:24:55.860 --> 2:24:59.700
 So yes, I would want there to be regulations

2:24:59.700 --> 2:25:03.860
 governing the use of biologically sensitive

2:25:03.860 --> 2:25:06.580
 and potentially dangerous pathogens

2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:10.060
 in a lab in Wuhan or any place else.

2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:13.260
 I would not want to simply leave that to laissez faire.

2:25:13.260 --> 2:25:16.660
 On the other hand, I think that the tendency

2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:19.700
 to try to shut down inquiry

2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:24.220
 on behalf of supposed adverse political consequences

2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:27.620
 is the road to ignorance and impoverishment

2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:29.460
 at the end of the day for humankind,

2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:31.580
 denying ourselves the potential benefits

2:25:31.580 --> 2:25:33.060
 of that kind of inquiry.

2:25:33.060 --> 2:25:35.660
 I think we need to take our chances with inquiry

2:25:35.660 --> 2:25:37.060
 rather than to try to control it.

2:25:37.060 --> 2:25:39.380
 And I feel that way about the exploration

2:25:39.380 --> 2:25:42.780
 of human intelligence as much as anything else.

2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:44.660
 So you've asked me to steel man the case

2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:47.540
 against research on IQ of the sort

2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:51.180
 that Charles Murray is famous for popularizing.

2:25:51.180 --> 2:25:54.780
 And I've said A, your measure of intelligence

2:25:54.780 --> 2:25:58.340
 is single dimensional and it ought to be multi dimensional.

2:25:58.340 --> 2:26:02.020
 I've said B, the consequences of people's differing

2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:03.980
 in intelligence depends not only

2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:05.860
 on the natural endowments of the people

2:26:05.860 --> 2:26:08.740
 but also on the environment

2:26:08.740 --> 2:26:12.300
 and the potential for intervening in that environment

2:26:12.300 --> 2:26:14.340
 through one or another kind of instrument

2:26:14.340 --> 2:26:18.340
 as the metaphorical example of the use of corrective lenses

2:26:18.340 --> 2:26:20.620
 to level the playing field between people

2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:25.020
 with different visual acuity indicates.

2:26:25.020 --> 2:26:28.020
 But finally, I've said, yes,

2:26:28.020 --> 2:26:31.700
 research on racial differences in IQ can foster

2:26:33.060 --> 2:26:38.060
 political beliefs that we would regard to be noxious.

2:26:38.300 --> 2:26:41.660
 On the other hand, to presume that what we don't know yet

2:26:41.660 --> 2:26:44.900
 and might find out from the research is gonna be harmful

2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:48.260
 is to assume a kind of presumption

2:26:48.260 --> 2:26:52.820
 or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be

2:26:52.820 --> 2:26:55.740
 which we ought to be very slow to embrace

2:26:55.740 --> 2:26:57.820
 because if we had done so in the past,

2:26:57.820 --> 2:26:59.980
 we wouldn't have nuclear power.

2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:01.180
 There's a lot of things that we wouldn't know.

2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:03.340
 I mean, what were people saying about Darwin

2:27:03.340 --> 2:27:06.220
 and exploration of the evolution

2:27:06.220 --> 2:27:07.940
 and origin of the species?

2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:10.380
 They were afraid that it was gonna, in effect,

2:27:10.380 --> 2:27:13.380
 disprove the religious based accounts

2:27:13.380 --> 2:27:16.300
 of what were they saying about Copernicus

2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:17.780
 and et cetera, et cetera.

2:27:17.780 --> 2:27:19.780
 So, you know.

2:27:19.780 --> 2:27:24.780
 That was a masterful layering of, quote,

2:27:24.780 --> 2:27:26.860
 wrestling with cognitive inequality.

2:27:26.860 --> 2:27:28.620
 You dragged in nuclear research,

2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:32.820
 Copernicus, Darwin, biomedical research with genetics,

2:27:32.820 --> 2:27:37.180
 even COVID and the lab leak.

2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.940
 I mean, that was just fun to listen to.

2:27:39.940 --> 2:27:40.780
 Okay. Okay.

2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:44.900
 Let me ask you about your politics.

2:27:44.900 --> 2:27:48.420
 So you've recently said that you're a conservative leaning.

2:27:48.420 --> 2:27:51.060
 I mean, maybe that's a day to day thing.

2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:52.100
 Maybe you can push back.

2:27:52.100 --> 2:27:55.860
 But so you have somebody like your friend, John McWhorter,

2:27:56.820 --> 2:28:01.740
 who we could say is on your left, to the left of you.

2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:05.660
 And then you have somebody like Thomas Sowell

2:28:05.660 --> 2:28:09.460
 who maybe is on to the right of you.

2:28:09.460 --> 2:28:10.780
 Yeah, probably.

2:28:10.780 --> 2:28:14.060
 And yet there's a lot of overlap between the three of you.

2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:19.060
 So to what degree does politics affect your view on race

2:28:19.700 --> 2:28:21.020
 in America?

2:28:21.020 --> 2:28:25.380
 And maybe to what degree does your view on race

2:28:25.380 --> 2:28:26.740
 affect your politics?

2:28:28.580 --> 2:28:29.420
 Okay.

2:28:29.420 --> 2:28:33.860
 And that, for people who don't know, has shifted over time.

2:28:33.860 --> 2:28:36.300
 You've been on quite a roller coaster,

2:28:36.300 --> 2:28:38.820
 as anybody who thinks about the world should be.

2:28:38.820 --> 2:28:43.060
 Well, let's begin with the fact that I was trained

2:28:43.060 --> 2:28:48.060
 as an economist in a tradition of what many people

2:28:48.060 --> 2:28:50.980
 would call neoliberalism.

2:28:50.980 --> 2:28:55.980
 I was trained at MIT, which was not a right wing place

2:28:56.220 --> 2:29:01.220
 by any means, but it was a place where you learned

2:29:01.220 --> 2:29:06.220
 about markets and about the benefits of capitalism

2:29:06.220 --> 2:29:10.740
 as a way of organizing society,

2:29:10.740 --> 2:29:13.660
 the virtues of free enterprise,

2:29:13.660 --> 2:29:15.460
 the fact that the pursuit of profit

2:29:15.460 --> 2:29:17.220
 was not necessarily a bad thing,

2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:20.140
 but it well might be the road to prosperity

2:29:20.140 --> 2:29:21.780
 and to economic growth.

2:29:21.780 --> 2:29:25.060
 The idea that private property and individuals seeking

2:29:25.060 --> 2:29:27.900
 to acquire and succeeding in acquiring wealth

2:29:28.900 --> 2:29:32.420
 did create inequality, but it also created opportunity.

2:29:32.420 --> 2:29:36.060
 And it also expanded the ability to do things

2:29:36.060 --> 2:29:38.540
 and expanded our knowledge and our control

2:29:38.540 --> 2:29:41.100
 over the physical environment in which we're embedded

2:29:41.100 --> 2:29:42.380
 and et cetera.

2:29:44.580 --> 2:29:48.660
 So we were not Marxists at MIT, although we did read Marx.

2:29:48.660 --> 2:29:50.580
 I mean, those of us who were intellectually curious,

2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:51.420
 you read Marx.

2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:54.380
 Marx was an important figure in the history of the West.

2:29:54.380 --> 2:29:57.940
 And I think Marx should be read in capital three volumes,

2:29:57.940 --> 2:30:02.220
 et cetera, alienation of labor and whatnot.

2:30:02.220 --> 2:30:04.820
 The implications of modernization,

2:30:04.820 --> 2:30:08.940
 the advent of industrial capitalism, et cetera.

2:30:08.940 --> 2:30:12.500
 That kind of dynamic deserves to be studied

2:30:12.500 --> 2:30:15.100
 and to come at it in a critical way,

2:30:16.380 --> 2:30:21.380
 informed by the intellectual inheritance of Marx and Marxism.

2:30:21.580 --> 2:30:23.860
 I think that's a part of a full education

2:30:23.860 --> 2:30:28.340
 in social philosophy and economic analysis

2:30:28.340 --> 2:30:32.340
 that an open minded person ought to acquaint themselves with.

2:30:32.340 --> 2:30:33.180
 But at the end of the day,

2:30:33.180 --> 2:30:38.180
 I think that the free marketeers have the better of it.

2:30:41.260 --> 2:30:43.220
 I think the story of the 20th century

2:30:43.220 --> 2:30:47.900
 as far as economic development is concerned reflects that.

2:30:47.900 --> 2:30:52.100
 I think that the experiments where centralized control

2:30:52.100 --> 2:30:57.100
 over economic decisions was the order of the day failed.

2:30:57.740 --> 2:31:01.900
 I think that the fact of the 21st century rise of China

2:31:01.900 --> 2:31:05.660
 as a force has a lot to do with the spread of,

2:31:05.660 --> 2:31:08.780
 in effect, capitalist oriented modes

2:31:08.780 --> 2:31:11.500
 of entering economic exchange,

2:31:11.500 --> 2:31:15.540
 freeing up prices, markets, property, and so forth.

2:31:15.540 --> 2:31:18.060
 Although obviously it's a complicated

2:31:18.060 --> 2:31:21.380
 political economic system, we're talking about China.

2:31:21.380 --> 2:31:26.100
 But I think that the story of the 20th century

2:31:26.100 --> 2:31:28.300
 and the hope for the 21st century

2:31:28.300 --> 2:31:33.300
 is that prosperity is enhanced through the free exchange

2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:39.900
 of goods and the pursuit and acquisition of property

2:31:40.140 --> 2:31:45.140
 by people in a more or less capitalist oriented system.

2:31:46.740 --> 2:31:49.860
 That's the view that I hold.

2:31:49.860 --> 2:31:52.340
 I guess that makes me a conservative, I don't know.

2:31:52.340 --> 2:31:56.580
 I wanna say that's not to the exclusion

2:31:56.580 --> 2:31:58.420
 of a social safety net.

2:31:58.420 --> 2:32:02.820
 I'm not saying that old people in an ideal social system

2:32:02.820 --> 2:32:04.460
 would be left to their own devices

2:32:04.460 --> 2:32:05.420
 regardless of whether or not

2:32:05.420 --> 2:32:07.340
 they had saved for their retirement.

2:32:07.340 --> 2:32:12.340
 I'm not saying that the ideal of extending decent access

2:32:13.900 --> 2:32:15.860
 to healthcare to all people regardless

2:32:15.860 --> 2:32:18.020
 of whether or not they can afford it,

2:32:18.020 --> 2:32:20.820
 decent access to education to people

2:32:20.820 --> 2:32:22.940
 regardless of whether or not they can afford it

2:32:22.940 --> 2:32:25.700
 is standing in the way of prosperity.

2:32:25.700 --> 2:32:26.980
 I don't believe that.

2:32:26.980 --> 2:32:29.580
 I think the mixed economies that we see in Northern Europe

2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:34.580
 and in North America are a balancing

2:32:35.020 --> 2:32:37.900
 of the virtues of free enterprise property

2:32:37.900 --> 2:32:40.500
 and the pursuit of wealth on the one hand

2:32:40.500 --> 2:32:44.220
 against the needs to have a decent society

2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:47.700
 in which people who fall between the cracks nevertheless

2:32:47.700 --> 2:32:51.620
 are bolstered through a sense of social solidarity

2:32:51.620 --> 2:32:54.540
 that is accommodated by our common membership

2:32:54.540 --> 2:32:56.900
 within a single nation state,

2:32:56.900 --> 2:32:59.300
 which is why I think nationalism is important.

2:32:59.300 --> 2:33:02.140
 And it's why I think borders are important

2:33:02.140 --> 2:33:06.500
 because without a coherent polity

2:33:06.500 --> 2:33:11.500
 who can see themselves as in a common situation

2:33:12.100 --> 2:33:15.100
 and agree through their politics

2:33:15.100 --> 2:33:17.540
 to support each other to some extent,

2:33:17.540 --> 2:33:18.980
 you can't sustain a safety net.

2:33:18.980 --> 2:33:23.100
 You cannot have a social safety net for a global population.

2:33:23.100 --> 2:33:24.660
 You can only have a social safety net

2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:28.220
 for a bounded population who have a sense

2:33:28.220 --> 2:33:33.060
 of common membership in an ongoing political enterprise

2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:35.660
 which they pay their dues through their taxes

2:33:35.660 --> 2:33:36.980
 in order to sustain it.

2:33:36.980 --> 2:33:38.900
 There's a balancing that has to go on.

2:33:38.900 --> 2:33:42.180
 So that's the first thing that I would say about my politics.

2:33:42.180 --> 2:33:44.020
 I'm a neoliberal economist.

2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.100
 I believe in markets.

2:33:45.100 --> 2:33:46.180
 I believe in prices.

2:33:46.180 --> 2:33:47.780
 I believe in profit.

2:33:47.780 --> 2:33:51.060
 Corporations are not an incarnation of evil.

2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:53.500
 Corporations are a legal nexus

2:33:53.500 --> 2:33:56.620
 through which production gets organized

2:33:56.620 --> 2:34:00.500
 in which you solicit the cooperation of workers,

2:34:00.500 --> 2:34:02.380
 of people who provide capital,

2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:04.060
 of people who provide raw materials

2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:06.740
 and input of customers and so on.

2:34:06.740 --> 2:34:11.740
 And that functionality allows for the production of goods

2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:16.620
 and their distribution and their earning of income

2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:18.820
 and its distribution,

2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:21.340
 which at the end of the day is the foundation

2:34:21.340 --> 2:34:22.180
 of our prosperity.

2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:23.460
 Corporations are people too.

2:34:23.460 --> 2:34:26.660
 Mitt Romney got in trouble for saying that in 2012.

2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:28.740
 But corporations are nothing but a legal fiction.

2:34:28.740 --> 2:34:32.140
 The corporation is not a person as such,

2:34:32.140 --> 2:34:35.100
 but the nexus of contracts and relationships

2:34:35.100 --> 2:34:38.060
 amongst the stakeholders who intersect

2:34:38.060 --> 2:34:41.340
 in the context of the corporation

2:34:41.340 --> 2:34:43.220
 is the way in which we organize

2:34:43.220 --> 2:34:46.380
 the massively complex set of activities

2:34:46.380 --> 2:34:50.980
 that are necessary in order to produce economic benefits,

2:34:50.980 --> 2:34:52.060
 in order to feed people,

2:34:52.060 --> 2:34:55.020
 in order to have everybody with a cell phone in their pocket,

2:34:55.020 --> 2:34:57.900
 in order to be able to travel from one side of a continent

2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:01.700
 to another on a device that is with almost absolute certainty

2:35:01.700 --> 2:35:04.020
 gonna safely take off and land

2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:07.540
 and in order to be able to build cities and et cetera.

2:35:07.540 --> 2:35:10.620
 But do the markets, the ideal of the market

2:35:10.620 --> 2:35:14.980
 collide with the ideal of all men are created equal?

2:35:14.980 --> 2:35:17.780
 The identity, the struggle that we've been talking about

2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:21.380
 of what it means to sort of empower humans

2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:23.340
 that make up this great country.

2:35:23.340 --> 2:35:26.340
 Do they collide and where do they collide?

2:35:26.340 --> 2:35:29.380
 Well, markets are gonna produce inequality

2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:32.260
 and all men being equal is a statement

2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:34.460
 about the intrinsic worth of people,

2:35:34.460 --> 2:35:36.980
 not about the situation that will come about

2:35:36.980 --> 2:35:39.340
 when people interact with each other through markets

2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:41.860
 because people are actually different

2:35:41.860 --> 2:35:43.140
 and because there are factors

2:35:43.140 --> 2:35:46.260
 that are beyond anybody's control called luck and chance

2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:49.300
 that you and I both invest.

2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:51.580
 It looked a priori like your investment and my investment

2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:53.660
 were equally likely to succeed.

2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:55.660
 But as a matter of fact, ex post facto,

2:35:55.660 --> 2:35:58.900
 your investment succeeds, my investment doesn't succeed.

2:35:58.900 --> 2:36:01.060
 I don't have wealth and you have wealth.

2:36:01.060 --> 2:36:04.300
 That is an inevitable consequence of a environment

2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:07.660
 in which both of us are free to make our investment choices

2:36:07.660 --> 2:36:09.860
 and where the consequences of investment

2:36:09.860 --> 2:36:12.660
 depend in part upon random circumstances

2:36:12.660 --> 2:36:14.820
 of which no one has control.

2:36:14.820 --> 2:36:16.420
 But you asked me about my politics

2:36:16.420 --> 2:36:18.460
 and I was just trying to lay down a foundation

2:36:18.460 --> 2:36:22.500
 by saying I begin as an economist

2:36:22.500 --> 2:36:27.020
 in the tradition of liberalism, Adam Smith and so forth,

2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:29.420
 John Maynard Keynes for that matter and so forth,

2:36:30.380 --> 2:36:34.460
 that Milton Friedman and so forth,

2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:39.460
 that Paul Samuelson, Bob Solla, James Tobin and so forth,

2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:44.460
 Thomas Sowell, yes, that appreciates property,

2:36:44.660 --> 2:36:46.740
 the virtues of free enterprise,

2:36:46.740 --> 2:36:51.740
 the set of institutions that allow for security of contract,

2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:56.180
 a rule of law, things of this kind.

2:36:56.180 --> 2:36:59.140
 So that's one thing to say about my politics.

2:36:59.140 --> 2:37:01.140
 Another thing to say about my politics and you're right,

2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:06.140
 I've moved around, is that I began south side of Chicago,

2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:09.460
 black kid, I was a liberal Democrat.

2:37:09.460 --> 2:37:14.460
 I encountered the economics curriculum at the MIT

2:37:14.620 --> 2:37:16.660
 and I became trained in economics

2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:18.860
 in the tradition that I've just described.

2:37:19.980 --> 2:37:24.300
 And I encountered also the Reagan Revolution.

2:37:24.300 --> 2:37:27.260
 This is the late 70s and early 80s.

2:37:27.260 --> 2:37:31.260
 These are big debates about economic policy and so on.

2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:36.260
 And I found a lot to admire in the supply side errors,

2:37:37.900 --> 2:37:39.060
 the people were saying,

2:37:39.060 --> 2:37:41.020
 let's get the government out of the way,

2:37:41.020 --> 2:37:43.060
 the people who were worried about national debt,

2:37:43.060 --> 2:37:45.300
 which is a lot more now than it was then,

2:37:46.300 --> 2:37:47.140
 the people who were worried

2:37:47.140 --> 2:37:48.940
 that the welfare state could be too big,

2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:51.060
 that the incentives of transfer programs

2:37:51.060 --> 2:37:54.100
 could be counterproductive, that you had a war on poverty

2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:56.700
 and we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.

2:37:56.700 --> 2:37:58.420
 And that's what I found.

2:37:58.420 --> 2:38:01.420
 And we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.

2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:04.460
 And there's a lot of evidence that the war on poverty

2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:07.300
 was lost by the people who were trying to, quote unquote,

2:38:07.300 --> 2:38:09.060
 eradicate poverty in our time.

2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:13.580
 That incentives really do matter

2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:17.500
 and that the state, which is driven by politics,

2:38:17.500 --> 2:38:20.700
 is often unresponsive to the dictates of incentives.

2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:24.380
 Whereas markets eliminate people who are inefficient

2:38:24.380 --> 2:38:27.180
 and who are not cognizant of the consequences of incentives

2:38:27.180 --> 2:38:29.540
 because they can't cover their bottom line

2:38:29.540 --> 2:38:31.420
 and they won't persist for very long.

2:38:31.420 --> 2:38:32.700
 If they can't cover their bottom line,

2:38:32.700 --> 2:38:35.900
 they're forced to respond to the realities of differences

2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:37.580
 and costs and benefits and so forth

2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:39.620
 in a way that governments can cover

2:38:39.620 --> 2:38:42.100
 because they have their hand in our pocket.

2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:43.940
 They can cover their losses

2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:46.260
 and they can make accounts balanced,

2:38:46.260 --> 2:38:47.460
 not withstanding their mistakes

2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:51.140
 because they can take my property by fiat,

2:38:51.140 --> 2:38:53.420
 by the power of the state, the tax collector comes,

2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:56.180
 if I don't pay, he seizes my holdings.

2:38:56.180 --> 2:38:59.100
 And they can carry on in that way.

2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:02.820
 They need the corrective influence of markets

2:39:02.820 --> 2:39:05.580
 in order to be responsive to the realities of life.

2:39:05.580 --> 2:39:10.580
 I mean, I may not like it that prices are telling me

2:39:10.580 --> 2:39:12.900
 that something that I wanna do is infeasible.

2:39:12.900 --> 2:39:15.740
 I may not like it, but what the prices are telling me

2:39:15.740 --> 2:39:20.340
 is that the costs of doing it exceed the benefits

2:39:20.340 --> 2:39:22.060
 to be derived from doing it.

2:39:22.060 --> 2:39:24.220
 And if I persist in doing it not withstanding that,

2:39:24.220 --> 2:39:25.500
 I'm gonna run losses.

2:39:25.500 --> 2:39:26.980
 And those losses will accumulate.

2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:30.900
 And the net effect of that over an entire society

2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:34.580
 is stagnation and ultimate attenuation

2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:36.060
 of the economic benefits

2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:37.260
 that might be available to people.

2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:40.620
 Again, I think if you look at the developing world

2:39:40.620 --> 2:39:42.100
 in the postcolonial period,

2:39:42.100 --> 2:39:44.020
 the second half of the 20th century,

2:39:44.020 --> 2:39:46.060
 that's exactly what you see.

2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:48.060
 Planning doesn't work.

2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:50.740
 Centralized control over resource allocation doesn't work.

2:39:50.740 --> 2:39:54.860
 Okay, so I became more conservative in that respect,

2:39:54.860 --> 2:39:57.300
 but I also, and this has to do with race,

2:39:59.380 --> 2:40:04.380
 lost the faith in the posture

2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:08.820
 that what became of the civil rights movement.

2:40:08.820 --> 2:40:11.740
 I mean, the civil rights movement, you quote King 1963,

2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:13.780
 the civil rights movement starts out as

2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:17.940
 we want equal membership in the polity,

2:40:17.940 --> 2:40:22.940
 but it becomes a systematized cover I'm going to argue

2:40:29.540 --> 2:40:34.540
 for deficiencies that are discernible

2:40:35.300 --> 2:40:38.940
 within black American society, which only we could correct.

2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:40.780
 That's a very controversial statement.

2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:43.540
 I make it with trepidation.

2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:47.340
 I don't take any pleasure in saying it,

2:40:47.340 --> 2:40:49.020
 but here's what I'm talking about.

2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:52.300
 So I'm talking about the family.

2:40:53.260 --> 2:40:58.260
 So the family is a matter internal to the community

2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:03.260
 about how men and women relate to each other

2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:06.500
 and engage in social reproduction, childbearing,

2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:09.780
 the standing up of households,

2:41:09.780 --> 2:41:12.340
 the context within which children are developed,

2:41:12.340 --> 2:41:14.660
 are maturing and so forth and so on.

2:41:14.660 --> 2:41:17.700
 So the African American family is in trouble.

2:41:17.700 --> 2:41:20.300
 I think I can demonstrate that

2:41:20.300 --> 2:41:24.340
 by reference to high rates of marital dissolution,

2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:29.020
 by high rates of birth to out of wedlock and so forth.

2:41:31.100 --> 2:41:32.020
 You can't even say that

2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:34.700
 the African American family is in trouble.

2:41:34.700 --> 2:41:39.340
 Violence, homicide is an order of magnitude more prevalent

2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:40.900
 amongst African Americans than it is

2:41:40.900 --> 2:41:43.020
 in the society as a whole.

2:41:43.020 --> 2:41:46.460
 This is behavior, it's behavior of our people.

2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:47.580
 I speak of black people.

2:41:47.580 --> 2:41:49.740
 Of course, we're not the only people in society

2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:51.620
 for whom violence is an issue.

2:41:51.620 --> 2:41:56.620
 It's an order of magnitude more prevalent in our communities.

2:41:56.820 --> 2:42:00.180
 I'm talking about schooling and school failure.

2:42:00.180 --> 2:42:02.780
 So we have affirmative action as a cover.

2:42:02.780 --> 2:42:06.020
 It's a bandaid on differences in the development

2:42:06.020 --> 2:42:07.980
 of intellectual performance,

2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:10.260
 which is only partly a consequence

2:42:10.260 --> 2:42:12.780
 of the natural intelligence of people

2:42:12.780 --> 2:42:16.700
 and largely a consequence of how people spend their time,

2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:20.140
 what they value, how they discipline themselves,

2:42:20.140 --> 2:42:23.740
 what they do with their opportunities,

2:42:23.740 --> 2:42:25.860
 how parents raise their children,

2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:28.500
 what peer groups value and things of this kind.

2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:30.940
 The Asian students who are scoring off the charts

2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:33.220
 on these exams are doing it

2:42:33.220 --> 2:42:35.420
 not because they're intrinsically more intelligent

2:42:35.420 --> 2:42:38.220
 to other people, but because they work harder,

2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:39.820
 because their parents are more insistent

2:42:39.820 --> 2:42:43.220
 on focusing on their intellectual performance

2:42:43.220 --> 2:42:45.100
 because they're disciplined,

2:42:45.100 --> 2:42:46.900
 because of the way that they devote their time

2:42:46.900 --> 2:42:50.420
 and their resources to equipping their children

2:42:50.420 --> 2:42:52.540
 to function in the 21st century.

2:42:52.540 --> 2:42:53.460
 This is what I believe.

2:42:53.460 --> 2:42:55.500
 I think it's demonstrably the case.

2:42:56.420 --> 2:43:00.140
 And it is a factor in racial disparity.

2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:03.020
 The way that the civil rights movement has evolved

2:43:03.020 --> 2:43:05.940
 under the wing of the Democratic Party

2:43:05.940 --> 2:43:10.940
 into an organized apologia for the failures

2:43:11.660 --> 2:43:14.180
 of African Americans to seize the opportunities

2:43:14.180 --> 2:43:17.500
 that exist for us now in the 21st century,

2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:21.140
 but did not exist in the first half of the 20th century,

2:43:21.140 --> 2:43:22.740
 the way in which the civil rights movement

2:43:22.740 --> 2:43:27.300
 has become an avoidance mechanism

2:43:27.300 --> 2:43:29.940
 for us not taking we African Americans responsible.

2:43:29.940 --> 2:43:30.780
 This is Glenn Loury.

2:43:30.780 --> 2:43:33.260
 Not everybody's gonna agree with it.

2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:36.780
 It's part of what makes me a conservative.

2:43:36.780 --> 2:43:38.940
 I am tired of the bellyaching.

2:43:38.940 --> 2:43:42.380
 I'm tired of the excuse me, white supremacy.

2:43:42.380 --> 2:43:45.660
 It is in my mind, a joke.

2:43:45.660 --> 2:43:49.300
 I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric

2:43:49.300 --> 2:43:53.940
 is so seductively attractive to African Americans

2:43:53.940 --> 2:43:57.580
 and so widely adopted by others.

2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:02.900
 And as I am fond of saying, at the end of the day,

2:44:02.900 --> 2:44:04.860
 nobody is coming to save us.

2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:09.380
 I mean, higher education, MIT, Caltech, Stanford,

2:44:10.820 --> 2:44:12.340
 where the future is happening,

2:44:13.660 --> 2:44:17.980
 that is about mastery over the achievements

2:44:17.980 --> 2:44:21.500
 of human civilization, such as they manifest themselves

2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:22.340
 in the 21st century.

2:44:22.340 --> 2:44:26.380
 There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery

2:44:26.380 --> 2:44:27.380
 over the material.

2:44:27.380 --> 2:44:33.380
 There's no substitute for that to be patronized,

2:44:33.700 --> 2:44:34.860
 to have the standards lowered.

2:44:34.860 --> 2:44:37.100
 They wanna get rid of the test.

2:44:37.100 --> 2:44:40.220
 They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.

2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:43.020
 We're gonna have a separate program for you.

2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:45.820
 We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.

2:44:45.820 --> 2:44:48.060
 That doesn't make us any smarter.

2:44:48.060 --> 2:44:49.940
 It doesn't make us any more creative.

2:44:51.020 --> 2:44:54.820
 And it doesn't make us any more fit

2:44:54.820 --> 2:44:58.300
 for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.

2:44:58.300 --> 2:45:01.340
 Now, you wanna be 10% of the population

2:45:01.340 --> 2:45:03.900
 that's carried along for the next 100 years?

2:45:03.900 --> 2:45:09.020
 You wanna be a ward of the state in the late 21st century?

2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:10.100
 You go ahead.

2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:12.100
 Because the Chinese are coming.

2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:13.660
 You're not gonna hold them back.

2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:16.300
 The world is being remade every decade

2:45:16.300 --> 2:45:19.580
 by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing.

2:45:19.580 --> 2:45:23.700
 If you don't get on board with the dynamic advancement

2:45:23.700 --> 2:45:26.100
 of the civilization in which we are embedded,

2:45:26.100 --> 2:45:29.380
 you're gonna end up being dependent on other people

2:45:29.380 --> 2:45:31.300
 to look kindly upon you.

2:45:31.300 --> 2:45:34.900
 And this story that you've got, this bellyache,

2:45:35.940 --> 2:45:39.260
 this excuse, my ancestors were slaves,

2:45:41.020 --> 2:45:45.020
 is only gonna work for so long.

2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:49.060
 So that makes me, I suppose, a kind of conservative.

2:45:49.060 --> 2:45:51.340
 I hate affirmative action.

2:45:51.340 --> 2:45:52.500
 I don't just disagree with it.

2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:55.340
 I don't just think it's against the 14th amendment.

2:45:55.340 --> 2:45:56.900
 I hate it.

2:45:56.900 --> 2:45:58.860
 The hatred comes from an understanding

2:45:58.860 --> 2:46:01.380
 that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute

2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:03.740
 for the actual development of the capacities

2:46:03.740 --> 2:46:05.540
 of our people to compete.

2:46:05.540 --> 2:46:08.300
 I'd much rather be in the position

2:46:08.300 --> 2:46:10.700
 of having them try to keep me out

2:46:10.700 --> 2:46:12.620
 because I'm so damn good,

2:46:12.620 --> 2:46:15.140
 like they're doing with the Asians,

2:46:15.140 --> 2:46:18.340
 than having them have to beg the Supreme Court

2:46:18.340 --> 2:46:21.100
 to allow for a special dispensation on my behalf

2:46:21.100 --> 2:46:25.620
 because they need diversity and inclusion and belonging.

2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:27.060
 It's not just diversity.

2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:28.540
 It's not just diversity and inclusion.

2:46:28.540 --> 2:46:31.500
 It's diversity and inclusion and belonging.

2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:34.540
 I'm whining because I feel like I don't belong.

2:46:35.660 --> 2:46:37.380
 That's a position of weakness.

2:46:37.380 --> 2:46:38.740
 It's pathetic.

2:46:40.180 --> 2:46:42.140
 And it's only political correctness

2:46:42.140 --> 2:46:43.780
 that keeps people who can see this,

2:46:43.780 --> 2:46:45.860
 and believe me, a lot of people can see it

2:46:47.340 --> 2:46:49.180
 from saying so out loud.

2:46:49.180 --> 2:46:52.180
 So you want the black American community

2:46:52.180 --> 2:46:54.180
 to represent strength.

2:46:54.180 --> 2:46:56.900
 Correct, and I want us to deal with what it is

2:46:56.900 --> 2:46:58.700
 that we have to deal with in order to be able

2:46:58.700 --> 2:47:03.700
 to project strength in an increasingly competitive world.

2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:06.380
 Let me ask you,

2:47:08.900 --> 2:47:10.460
 I know you said you're angry

2:47:12.180 --> 2:47:14.060
 or dislike affirmative action.

2:47:14.060 --> 2:47:15.980
 Let me ask you about something

2:47:15.980 --> 2:47:19.180
 that even to my ear cut wrong.

2:47:20.420 --> 2:47:23.020
 Now I'm relatively apolitical.

2:47:23.020 --> 2:47:27.180
 So President Biden, when he was running for president,

2:47:27.180 --> 2:47:30.460
 gave a campaign promise that he will nominate

2:47:30.460 --> 2:47:33.220
 a black woman to the US Supreme Court,

2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:36.140
 saying, quote, the person I will nominate

2:47:36.140 --> 2:47:39.180
 will be someone with extraordinary qualifications,

2:47:39.180 --> 2:47:42.020
 character, experience, and integrity.

2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:43.020
 First sentence.

2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:44.380
 Second sentence.

2:47:44.380 --> 2:47:46.940
 And that person will be the first black woman

2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:50.660
 ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.

2:47:50.660 --> 2:47:53.100
 Do you wish he only said the first sentence

2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:54.380
 and not the second?

2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:58.700
 Yes, I wish that he had only said the first sentence,

2:47:58.700 --> 2:48:00.380
 even if his intention was to do

2:48:00.380 --> 2:48:03.540
 what he said he was gonna do in the second sentence.

2:48:03.540 --> 2:48:06.300
 In other words, I wish that he had simply said,

2:48:06.300 --> 2:48:07.980
 if I have the opportunity to nominate someone

2:48:07.980 --> 2:48:09.300
 to the Supreme Court, it's gonna be

2:48:09.300 --> 2:48:13.020
 a superbly qualified person to carry out that position.

2:48:13.020 --> 2:48:15.420
 And he might've kept to himself his intention

2:48:16.340 --> 2:48:18.700
 to name an African American woman to that position.

2:48:18.700 --> 2:48:21.060
 And then going ahead and named an African American woman

2:48:21.060 --> 2:48:21.900
 to that position.

2:48:21.900 --> 2:48:25.380
 And I'm sure that Katanji Brown Jackson,

2:48:25.380 --> 2:48:27.180
 I don't doubt that she's exceptionally qualified.

2:48:27.180 --> 2:48:28.660
 She has a distinguished career.

2:48:28.660 --> 2:48:31.700
 She served as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

2:48:31.700 --> 2:48:33.020
 She's a graduate at Harvard Law School.

2:48:33.020 --> 2:48:34.700
 She has a background.

2:48:34.700 --> 2:48:39.540
 You do not have to be a world class

2:48:39.540 --> 2:48:41.260
 constitutional legal scholar

2:48:41.260 --> 2:48:43.660
 to get onto the United States Supreme Court.

2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:45.820
 A lot of members of the United States Supreme Court

2:48:45.820 --> 2:48:48.540
 have had different kinds of legal careers

2:48:48.540 --> 2:48:51.540
 before they were elevated to that position.

2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:56.540
 Earl Warren of the famed Warren Court of the 1950s and 60s

2:48:57.180 --> 2:49:01.060
 was a politician as well as a leading jurist and whatnot.

2:49:01.060 --> 2:49:03.180
 I mean, many kinds of people in the US Supreme Court.

2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:06.940
 I have no doubt that Judge Katanji Brown Jackson

2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:10.100
 is a qualified member to be on the Supreme Court.

2:49:10.100 --> 2:49:13.780
 I wish that Biden had not done what he did.

2:49:13.780 --> 2:49:16.140
 He could have just appointed a black woman

2:49:16.140 --> 2:49:18.860
 by saying that he was limiting his considerations

2:49:18.860 --> 2:49:19.700
 to black women.

2:49:19.700 --> 2:49:21.180
 And what are black women as a percentage

2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:24.940
 of all potential appointees to the Supreme Court?

2:49:24.940 --> 2:49:28.580
 3%, 4%, I don't know, we could look the number up.

2:49:30.700 --> 2:49:33.460
 By saying that he puts an asterisk on the appointment,

2:49:33.460 --> 2:49:34.660
 but it's worse than that

2:49:35.940 --> 2:49:39.140
 because she will live down the asterisk

2:49:39.140 --> 2:49:42.340
 if a person is inclined to do that.

2:49:42.340 --> 2:49:44.140
 She will have the opportunity to show

2:49:44.140 --> 2:49:47.300
 through her performance exactly what kind of juror she is.

2:49:47.300 --> 2:49:49.820
 Just as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown

2:49:49.820 --> 2:49:52.740
 through his performance that he was qualified

2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:53.900
 and more than qualified to be

2:49:53.900 --> 2:49:56.260
 on the United States Supreme Court,

2:49:57.500 --> 2:49:59.740
 what I dislike was the pandering.

2:50:01.260 --> 2:50:06.260
 He was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us

2:50:06.620 --> 2:50:09.020
 and then he's treating us like children.

2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:12.140
 Why should I care what color the person is

2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:14.420
 who's on the United States Supreme Court?

2:50:14.420 --> 2:50:17.700
 What I should care about is what kind of opinions

2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:20.020
 they're gonna write when they're on the United States.

2:50:20.020 --> 2:50:22.020
 Do I suppose that being a black woman

2:50:22.020 --> 2:50:23.460
 means that you're gonna write different kinds

2:50:23.460 --> 2:50:24.340
 of opinions than others?

2:50:24.340 --> 2:50:29.340
 Well, perhaps, perhaps that kind of identity politics

2:50:30.700 --> 2:50:35.140
 at the highest level of American legal establishment

2:50:35.140 --> 2:50:39.140
 is something that rubs me very much the wrong way.

2:50:39.140 --> 2:50:42.740
 What I should care about is the nature

2:50:42.740 --> 2:50:43.780
 and the future of the law.

2:50:43.780 --> 2:50:45.700
 I mean, I'm actually struck by this

2:50:45.700 --> 2:50:49.820
 because the court is conservative.

2:50:50.780 --> 2:50:53.820
 It has six conservative members on it

2:50:53.820 --> 2:50:56.420
 and it has three liberal members on it.

2:50:58.380 --> 2:51:02.700
 And if I were and I'm not a liberal Democrat,

2:51:02.700 --> 2:51:04.900
 the highest concern that I would have

2:51:04.900 --> 2:51:07.540
 about an appointment to the Supreme Court is,

2:51:07.540 --> 2:51:11.060
 is this a person who is going to be effective

2:51:11.060 --> 2:51:14.020
 in advocating my liberal views

2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:17.020
 within the highest counsel of American law?

2:51:17.020 --> 2:51:19.940
 Now, the fact that that person is a woman

2:51:19.940 --> 2:51:23.180
 or is a black person is way down the list

2:51:23.180 --> 2:51:26.340
 of the things that I would think are important

2:51:26.340 --> 2:51:29.660
 to the kinds of opinions that they're going to write.

2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:33.380
 So, I mean, I think Joe Biden,

2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:38.380
 this is just a piece of a larger political strategy

2:51:39.540 --> 2:51:41.660
 to cobble together a coalition

2:51:41.660 --> 2:51:44.020
 that'll be successful at the polls

2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:45.700
 in sustaining Democrats.

2:51:46.740 --> 2:51:49.980
 Jim Crow 2.0, this whole characterization

2:51:49.980 --> 2:51:52.940
 of the conflict in the states

2:51:52.940 --> 2:51:56.180
 about election security and voting rights

2:51:56.180 --> 2:51:58.500
 is another part of that strategy.

2:51:58.500 --> 2:52:01.980
 He is pandering to black voters.

2:52:01.980 --> 2:52:04.980
 He is trying to frighten us,

2:52:04.980 --> 2:52:06.940
 thinking that if the Republicans win,

2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:08.740
 our rights will be taken away.

2:52:09.740 --> 2:52:14.740
 And I think it is a infantilization

2:52:14.860 --> 2:52:16.380
 of African American politics.

2:52:16.380 --> 2:52:20.380
 I think black people are not to be as concerned

2:52:20.380 --> 2:52:22.420
 about the color of the skin of a person

2:52:22.420 --> 2:52:23.980
 who is serving in government

2:52:23.980 --> 2:52:26.940
 as they are about the content of their character

2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:30.700
 and the focus of their political

2:52:30.700 --> 2:52:32.820
 and ideological orientation,

2:52:32.820 --> 2:52:37.380
 which for me would be center or even center right,

2:52:37.380 --> 2:52:38.860
 but that's me.

2:52:38.860 --> 2:52:41.460
 And it should not have a significant impact.

2:52:41.460 --> 2:52:43.940
 Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterisks,

2:52:43.940 --> 2:52:46.300
 but to me it was deeply disrespectful

2:52:46.300 --> 2:52:50.380
 that anyone would give an extra asterisk

2:52:50.380 --> 2:52:51.700
 to have to overcome.

2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:52.860
 He didn't have to say it.

2:52:52.860 --> 2:52:54.060
 All he had to do was do it.

2:52:54.060 --> 2:52:55.700
 If he wanted to put a black woman on the court,

2:52:55.700 --> 2:52:57.460
 then he could have gone ahead and done it.

2:52:57.460 --> 2:52:59.780
 The reason he said it is because he wanted black people

2:52:59.780 --> 2:53:01.580
 to vote for him by saying it.

2:53:01.580 --> 2:53:04.540
 And I'm saying that treats us like we're children.

2:53:04.540 --> 2:53:05.780
 It's not a political statement.

2:53:05.780 --> 2:53:06.860
 I just thought as a leader,

2:53:06.860 --> 2:53:11.340
 that was kind of disgusting.

2:53:12.820 --> 2:53:13.900
 Let me ask you about Thomas Sowell.

2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:14.820
 You mentioned him.

2:53:14.820 --> 2:53:18.860
 He's a colleague and somebody who was an influence

2:53:20.980 --> 2:53:22.660
 in the space of ideas.

2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:27.660
 So what broadly, what impact has he had on your ideas

2:53:27.660 --> 2:53:32.660
 and how do you think he shaped the landscape of ideas

2:53:33.020 --> 2:53:35.140
 in our culture in general?

2:53:35.140 --> 2:53:37.540
 I think Thomas Sowell, he's in his 90s now.

2:53:37.540 --> 2:53:39.100
 He's been around for a long time.

2:53:39.100 --> 2:53:40.300
 He's still got it.

2:53:40.300 --> 2:53:41.380
 He's still going at it.

2:53:41.380 --> 2:53:42.220
 He's still going at it.

2:53:42.220 --> 2:53:43.180
 Books continue to come out.

2:53:43.180 --> 2:53:44.420
 I think he's a great man.

2:53:45.340 --> 2:53:49.060
 I think Thomas Sowell, regardless of his race,

2:53:49.060 --> 2:53:54.060
 he's black, is one of the 100 most significant economists

2:53:54.060 --> 2:53:56.180
 of the 20th century.

2:53:56.180 --> 2:53:57.980
 He has chosen as his subject,

2:53:57.980 --> 2:53:59.740
 a substantial part of his subject,

2:53:59.740 --> 2:54:03.220
 subject to investigate the deep causes

2:54:03.220 --> 2:54:07.740
 and consequences of racial disparity of one kind or another.

2:54:07.740 --> 2:54:12.740
 He's written fundamental books about that, many of them.

2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:15.820
 He's a social philosopher.

2:54:15.820 --> 2:54:18.860
 He is a economic historian.

2:54:18.860 --> 2:54:23.860
 He is a combatant in the conflict of ideas

2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:25.940
 around how to think about society

2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:28.420
 and this beyond racial differences,

2:54:28.420 --> 2:54:29.660
 although race has been a big part

2:54:29.660 --> 2:54:31.380
 of what he's written about.

2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:33.580
 He's been critical of affirmative action

2:54:33.580 --> 2:54:36.060
 and he didn't just stand back and wag his finger.

2:54:36.060 --> 2:54:37.980
 He got busy looking at the consequences

2:54:37.980 --> 2:54:40.740
 of affirmative action in societies all around the world.

2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:42.660
 And he's written books about that.

2:54:42.660 --> 2:54:47.180
 He's been critical of the narrative about civil rights

2:54:47.180 --> 2:54:48.780
 and racial inequality.

2:54:48.780 --> 2:54:50.260
 He believes in small government.

2:54:50.260 --> 2:54:54.060
 He doesn't think that efforts to redistribute income

2:54:54.060 --> 2:54:55.860
 have proved to be the solution

2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:58.660
 to the problem of racial disparity.

2:54:58.660 --> 2:55:01.100
 Tom has not been honored by the committee

2:55:01.100 --> 2:55:05.140
 that hands out Nobel recognition in economic science

2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:07.780
 and probably won't be because he's controversial.

2:55:07.780 --> 2:55:12.540
 And I reckon that that committee would be loath to encourage

2:55:12.540 --> 2:55:14.900
 the blowback that they would be sure to receive

2:55:14.900 --> 2:55:17.660
 if they were to take a controversial

2:55:17.660 --> 2:55:22.660
 and politically focus and expressive black conservative

2:55:23.660 --> 2:55:24.860
 and honor in that way.

2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:27.420
 So I think another reason is that Tom

2:55:27.420 --> 2:55:32.420
 as a methodological matter is not especially quantitative.

2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:33.740
 He pays attention to data

2:55:33.740 --> 2:55:36.380
 but he doesn't do statistical analysis

2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:38.340
 and he doesn't do modeling.

2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:40.220
 So from a methodological point of view,

2:55:40.220 --> 2:55:44.180
 he's not a cutting edge kind of person

2:55:44.180 --> 2:55:47.740
 of mathematically sophisticated,

2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:51.700
 kind of quantitatively statistically oriented

2:55:51.700 --> 2:55:53.100
 but he does descriptive stuff.

2:55:53.100 --> 2:55:56.780
 He writes in a style that is much more

2:55:56.780 --> 2:55:59.460
 like a social historian than it is

2:55:59.460 --> 2:56:04.140
 like a mathematically trained analytical economist.

2:56:04.140 --> 2:56:07.380
 On the other hand, he is an economist in the Chicago school

2:56:07.380 --> 2:56:09.940
 with Milton Friedman and George Stickler

2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:14.940
 prominent amongst his teachers who takes price theory

2:56:15.180 --> 2:56:20.180
 which is the analysis of the interplay of market forces,

2:56:21.860 --> 2:56:25.860
 mindful of incentives and so on

2:56:25.860 --> 2:56:30.860
 to implement the basic insights from economic science.

2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:33.100
 There is no free lunch.

2:56:33.100 --> 2:56:34.460
 I mean, there's always gonna be a cost

2:56:34.460 --> 2:56:36.460
 to anything that you do and so on.

2:56:36.460 --> 2:56:40.660
 People respond to incentives, demand curves slope downward.

2:56:40.660 --> 2:56:42.140
 Competition tends to work best

2:56:42.140 --> 2:56:45.060
 when people are free to enter and not and so on.

2:56:45.060 --> 2:56:46.860
 I mean, that kind of thing.

2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:51.780
 But Tom is also a social historian and a philosopher

2:56:51.780 --> 2:56:54.900
 in the tradition of Friedrich von Hayek.

2:56:55.860 --> 2:56:57.820
 One of Tom's books I've deeply admired,

2:56:57.820 --> 2:56:59.980
 "'Knowledge and Decisions,'

2:56:59.980 --> 2:57:03.060
 is an extension of the Hayekian arguments

2:57:03.060 --> 2:57:08.060
 about the limits of central planning and whatnot.

2:57:09.060 --> 2:57:14.060
 So I think Thomas Sowell, African American,

2:57:15.380 --> 2:57:17.540
 born as I understand it in Louisiana,

2:57:18.500 --> 2:57:22.300
 raised in New York City, graduate of Harvard College,

2:57:22.300 --> 2:57:26.580
 a military veteran, a PhD in economics

2:57:26.580 --> 2:57:29.180
 from the University of Chicago,

2:57:29.180 --> 2:57:31.780
 a black conservative social scientist

2:57:31.780 --> 2:57:34.540
 of very high stature, I think he's a great man.

2:57:34.540 --> 2:57:37.820
 And one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century.

2:57:37.820 --> 2:57:42.820
 And you're saying implicitly deserves a Nobel Prize.

2:57:42.940 --> 2:57:45.500
 Yeah, I do think so.

2:57:45.500 --> 2:57:50.060
 I mean, Hayek was awarded by the committee.

2:57:50.060 --> 2:57:53.180
 Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist

2:57:53.180 --> 2:57:54.460
 who wrote about economic development,

2:57:54.460 --> 2:57:56.460
 wrote a famous two volume work,

2:57:56.460 --> 2:57:59.460
 "'An American Dilemma,' about the status of blacks."

2:57:59.460 --> 2:58:04.460
 I mean, I think Tom could be put in that company

2:58:04.620 --> 2:58:06.100
 very easily without any difficulty.

2:58:06.100 --> 2:58:08.900
 I agree, Daniel Kahneman, them,

2:58:08.900 --> 2:58:09.940
 so it doesn't have to be an American.

2:58:09.940 --> 2:58:14.820
 Psychologist, an economist, Eleonora Ostrom,

2:58:14.820 --> 2:58:17.420
 the political scientist who was honored in a joint prize

2:58:17.420 --> 2:58:21.900
 given to her and Oliver Williamson 15 years ago or so.

2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:24.660
 He could be put in that company really quite easily.

2:58:26.060 --> 2:58:27.860
 Let me ask you, you mentioned Obama

2:58:27.860 --> 2:58:31.100
 in the very beginning that we were talking about.

2:58:34.260 --> 2:58:38.140
 How did it feel, that seems like forever ago,

2:58:38.140 --> 2:58:41.780
 that in 2008, Barack Obama became president?

2:58:41.780 --> 2:58:45.780
 Now at that time, perhaps you identify

2:58:45.780 --> 2:58:47.360
 as conservative already.

2:58:48.940 --> 2:58:53.940
 So politics aside, just in general,

2:58:53.940 --> 2:58:58.940
 how did it feel that in 150 years

2:58:59.860 --> 2:59:01.540
 where this country has come along?

2:59:03.260 --> 2:59:07.340
 Well, yeah, I didn't identify in 2008

2:59:07.340 --> 2:59:10.780
 as a conservative to the same extent that I do today.

2:59:12.420 --> 2:59:15.940
 I was kind of in transition yet again.

2:59:15.940 --> 2:59:18.380
 I was excited by the Obama candidacy.

2:59:18.380 --> 2:59:23.140
 At first I was skeptical because after all, he's not black.

2:59:25.260 --> 2:59:27.460
 The man's father is a Kenyan

2:59:27.460 --> 2:59:31.860
 and the man's mother is a white American

2:59:31.860 --> 2:59:35.060
 and he identifies as black.

2:59:35.060 --> 2:59:38.700
 I find it interesting that the first black president

2:59:38.700 --> 2:59:39.660
 of the United States,

2:59:39.660 --> 2:59:42.460
 and I could have put inverted commas around black,

2:59:42.460 --> 2:59:45.920
 and the first black vice president of the United States,

2:59:45.920 --> 2:59:48.420
 neither of them descend from American slaves.

2:59:49.660 --> 2:59:54.660
 Kamala Harris's father is of African ancestry in part.

2:59:54.740 --> 2:59:56.000
 He's a Jamaican immigrant

2:59:56.000 --> 3:00:00.340
 and her mother is an Indian immigrant.

3:00:00.340 --> 3:00:02.380
 She was Kamala Harris,

3:00:04.180 --> 3:00:07.940
 raised up largely in Canada,

3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:11.360
 though born in the United States.

3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:16.360
 Barack Obama is, as I've said, of mixed ancestry

3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:20.200
 and neither of his parents are the descendants

3:00:20.200 --> 3:00:25.200
 of American descendants of African slaves.

3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:31.000
 But blackness is flexible.

3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:35.460
 It's something that you can put on

3:00:35.460 --> 3:00:38.600
 or you can take off to a certain degree for some people

3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:41.640
 and so be it.

3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:46.640
 I was excited, our time has come, hope and change.

3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:51.160
 We are the ones we've been waiting for.

3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:53.120
 These are slogans from 2008.

3:00:54.680 --> 3:00:57.560
 I can't believe I bought that crap.

3:00:57.560 --> 3:00:58.400
 Oh, interesting.

3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.120
 Let me push back here.

3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:04.140
 You talked about, I mean, to me a Jew is a Jew.

3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:08.000
 Skin color is skin color.

3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:08.840
 Yeah.

3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:15.160
 I mean, Barack Obama is black when it matters,

3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:20.800
 when you're talking to a white supremacist,

3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:25.320
 when you're talking to, if you're a slave owner,

3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:26.440
 he's black.

3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:30.680
 Just like you said, when Hitler comes around,

3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:31.520
 a Jew is a Jew.

3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:35.800
 It doesn't matter how you identify, it doesn't matter what.

3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:40.240
 So in that sense, don't you think that Barack Obama

3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:43.400
 is black in the most powerful of ways,

3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.400
 which is designating how far the MLK, the Dr. King vision?

3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:50.140
 Oh, sure.

3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:52.720
 And look, I said it a little bit tongue in cheek.

3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:54.160
 Yes, yes, of course.

3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:57.160
 But I think Obama has been very careful

3:01:57.160 --> 3:02:00.880
 about manufacturing a kind of public persona

3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:05.880
 that is intended to position him in the most effective way.

3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:10.760
 You mean like every politician?

3:02:10.760 --> 3:02:12.580
 Yeah, like every politician, sure.

3:02:12.580 --> 3:02:17.200
 And that the racial identity piece is an aspect of that.

3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:21.320
 I mean, anything I say here would only be speculation

3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:24.180
 because I have no facts about the personal history

3:02:24.180 --> 3:02:25.020
 of Barack Obama.

3:02:25.020 --> 3:02:27.760
 And I accept Barack Hussein Obama,

3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:30.880
 as Hillary Clinton once said, I take him at his word

3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:33.960
 about whatever she was talking about.

3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:35.840
 Well, was he a Christian?

3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:37.700
 I think is what the question was.

3:02:37.700 --> 3:02:40.880
 And there was some right wing attack on Obama

3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:45.560
 for having been raised for some years in the Philippines

3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:48.440
 and all of that, or Indonesia, I beg your pardon,

3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:51.560
 in Indonesia and his stepfather and all of that.

3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:55.960
 But she took him at his word and I take him at his word

3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:58.120
 about his racial identity.

3:02:58.120 --> 3:02:58.960
 No.

3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:01.680
 But you were captivated by the power of his words

3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:04.360
 and you regret to the degree you were captivated.

3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:06.440
 Well, I mean, I think in retrospect,

3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:09.920
 that whole campaign looks like a pie in the sky

3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:13.140
 kind of fairy tale.

3:03:13.140 --> 3:03:15.760
 We are the ones we've been waiting for.

3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:18.320
 I can't quote exactly that speech that he gave

3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:21.440
 in Grant Park in Chicago when he was announced

3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:23.740
 as the winner of the election.

3:03:23.740 --> 3:03:27.080
 But today is the day that the rise of the ocean

3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:28.880
 stopped words to this effect.

3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:32.800
 I mean, those who doubted that we could do it,

3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:34.240
 that tonight is your answer.

3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:36.960
 This was gonna be a new day, it was gonna be a new regime.

3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:40.100
 Well, it wasn't a new day and it wasn't a new regime.

3:03:40.100 --> 3:03:43.120
 It was American politics more or less as usual.

3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:46.360
 Barack Obama turns out not to be the Messiah.

3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:48.400
 Maybe there should be no surprise in that.

3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:52.640
 Race relations got set back during Obama's tenure.

3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:57.920
 My beef with Obama is that, okay, you're black.

3:03:57.920 --> 3:03:59.600
 You say you're black, you're black.

3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:02.300
 You got elected, now we have a black president.

3:04:02.300 --> 3:04:04.140
 A black president.

3:04:05.380 --> 3:04:07.880
 You can do stuff that nobody else could do.

3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:11.000
 You're a black president.

3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.840
 You could tell the people burning down the city

3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:18.600
 to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it.

3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:23.000
 You could tell the race hustlers,

3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:24.600
 they all shocked into the world.

3:04:26.460 --> 3:04:28.280
 Not only has our time come

3:04:28.280 --> 3:04:30.740
 for those who supported my campaign,

3:04:30.740 --> 3:04:34.760
 your time is over for those who wanna carry on

3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:40.280
 a advocacy rooted in racial grievance.

3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:44.040
 The election of myself to this highest office proves

3:04:44.040 --> 3:04:46.720
 that the institution of this state are legitimate

3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:49.220
 and open to all comers.

3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:55.160
 I think Barack Obama, when the SHIT hit the fan,

3:04:56.480 --> 3:04:58.200
 if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.

3:04:58.200 --> 3:05:00.200
 I deeply regret that he said that.

3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:02.460
 He's president of the United States.

3:05:02.460 --> 3:05:06.480
 The color of his skin and the color of Trayvon's skin,

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.080
 the correlation between those two things.

3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:09.440
 If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.

3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:12.280
 Now he says, when he said it,

3:05:12.280 --> 3:05:15.680
 he only meant to sympathize with the parents.

3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:18.020
 But in fact, when he said it from the highest office

3:05:18.020 --> 3:05:20.920
 in the land and then sent his attorney general,

3:05:20.920 --> 3:05:24.680
 Eric Holder out to enforce this narrative,

3:05:24.680 --> 3:05:27.480
 he doubled down on a racial narrative

3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:30.000
 that I think is actually false.

3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:35.000
 I think the story that systemic racism in America

3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:38.320
 as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people

3:05:38.320 --> 3:05:42.680
 because of the color of their skin is demonstrably false.

3:05:42.680 --> 3:05:47.360
 I think that the central threat to black lives

3:05:47.360 --> 3:05:52.360
 is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people

3:05:52.820 --> 3:05:54.440
 against other black people.

3:05:54.440 --> 3:05:56.300
 I think there is such a thing as police brutality

3:05:56.300 --> 3:05:58.840
 and I think there are reasons to have regulations of police

3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:02.240
 but I think it is a second order issue

3:06:02.240 --> 3:06:07.000
 in terms of the quality of life of African Americans.

3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:08.820
 I think Obama could have told the people

3:06:08.820 --> 3:06:12.000
 who after Freddie Gray died in police custody

3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:15.300
 in a van in Baltimore and who undertook

3:06:15.300 --> 3:06:19.280
 to burn that city down to get their asses off the street

3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:21.080
 and go back to their apartments and stop it.

3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:22.820
 I think he could have said in the aftermath

3:06:22.820 --> 3:06:26.560
 of Michael Brown being shot dead by Darren Wilson

3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:30.720
 in Ferguson, Missouri and there was a grand jury deliberation

3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:34.040
 that he elected not to indict Officer Wilson

3:06:34.040 --> 3:06:35.680
 and people took the streets in that city

3:06:35.680 --> 3:06:39.240
 and stood on top of vehicles and so forth and so on.

3:06:39.240 --> 3:06:42.980
 He could have told them we don't mob around courthouses

3:06:42.980 --> 3:06:46.000
 in this country, we respect the rule of law,

3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:48.480
 get your butts off the streets

3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:49.840
 and back into your apartments.

3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:50.860
 He didn't do that.

3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:54.680
 To push back a little bit.

3:06:54.680 --> 3:06:56.720
 Yeah, good, push back.

3:06:56.720 --> 3:06:59.620
 I think you're asking Barack Obama,

3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:04.460
 the first black president of the United States,

3:07:04.460 --> 3:07:07.240
 to do the thing that I think should be done

3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:09.720
 by the second black president of the United States.

3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:13.380
 I think his very example, given the color of his skin,

3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:17.480
 was the most powerful thing.

3:07:17.480 --> 3:07:22.360
 And actually doing some of these hard Thomas Sowell type

3:07:22.360 --> 3:07:26.920
 of Glen Lurie type of strong words about race,

3:07:26.920 --> 3:07:29.620
 it may be too much to ask given the nature

3:07:29.620 --> 3:07:31.680
 of modern day politics.

3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:33.260
 He is a politician.

3:07:33.260 --> 3:07:34.100
 He is a politician.

3:07:34.100 --> 3:07:37.000
 And he needed to get elected, he needed to get reelected.

3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:39.640
 It was in his second term

3:07:39.640 --> 3:07:41.340
 where most of what I'm talking about happened,

3:07:41.340 --> 3:07:43.040
 so he wasn't facing further election.

3:07:43.040 --> 3:07:48.040
 But Obama was what, 46 or 47 when he was inaugurated?

3:07:48.680 --> 3:07:52.120
 He served for eight years, so he's in his mid 50s.

3:07:52.120 --> 3:07:54.840
 He's got another half century or 40 years of life,

3:07:54.840 --> 3:07:56.500
 God willing.

3:07:56.500 --> 3:07:58.960
 His post presidency, I think,

3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:00.680
 was what was primarily on his mind.

3:08:00.680 --> 3:08:03.140
 Not getting elected to anything,

3:08:03.140 --> 3:08:05.280
 but being enshrined in a certain way.

3:08:05.280 --> 3:08:10.280
 And the persona that he is now embodying,

3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:14.880
 which depends upon a racial narrative

3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:18.160
 that I and Thomas Sowell and others object to,

3:08:18.160 --> 3:08:21.360
 I think was very much in the forefront of his mind

3:08:21.360 --> 3:08:23.720
 when he made decisions as the chief executive officer

3:08:23.720 --> 3:08:28.720
 of the country that we've all now have to live with.

3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:33.720
 Yeah, but the fact is, he opened the door

3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:35.960
 in a way that hasn't been done

3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:40.680
 in the history of the United States,

3:08:40.680 --> 3:08:45.680
 that I don't see there being even a significant discussion

3:08:47.500 --> 3:08:52.060
 when an African American, a black man or a black woman

3:08:52.060 --> 3:08:54.920
 runs for president, maybe a black man, let's say,

3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:56.960
 because there still hasn't been a woman president.

3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:01.000
 I just see that that broke open the possibility of that.

3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:02.520
 That's not even a discussion.

3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:05.960
 And that example by itself, I mean, to me,

3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:08.760
 the role of the president isn't just policy.

3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:09.780
 It's to inspire.

3:09:09.780 --> 3:09:14.780
 It's to do the Dr. King thing, which is, I have a dream.

3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:19.500
 And Barack Obama is an example of somebody

3:09:19.500 --> 3:09:21.240
 that could give one hell of a speech.

3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:23.840
 It got you to believe.

3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:26.920
 Obama is a smooth operator without any question.

3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:28.440
 He's a master of his craft.

3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:30.800
 He did the impossible.

3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:34.280
 I mean, he beat Hillary Clinton in that primary fight,

3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:38.000
 and he beat John McCain in that general election,

3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:39.120
 and hats off to him.

3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:43.960
 And moreover, he remains a iconic figure in American culture.

3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:46.160
 I don't think there's any doubt about that.

3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:50.120
 Let me just mention, Clarence Thomas is also black.

3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:55.120
 Clarence Thomas has a story that is vivid and inspiring,

3:09:56.300 --> 3:09:57.380
 just like Obama's story.

3:09:57.380 --> 3:10:00.060
 He overcome obstacles just like Obama did.

3:10:00.060 --> 3:10:02.620
 I mean, extreme poverty and so forth and so on.

3:10:02.620 --> 3:10:07.260
 Clarence Thomas has served longer than any other member

3:10:07.260 --> 3:10:09.380
 of the United States Supreme Court.

3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:13.160
 He is one of nine justices,

3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:15.620
 and it's three equal branches of government.

3:10:15.620 --> 3:10:18.340
 So Clarence Thomas, by my arithmetic,

3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:22.520
 personifies 1 27th of the American state.

3:10:25.060 --> 3:10:28.700
 He is an iconic figure.

3:10:28.700 --> 3:10:32.940
 His example should be an inspiration to Americans

3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:36.380
 of all races, but especially a black American youngsters.

3:10:36.380 --> 3:10:38.900
 He happens to be conservative.

3:10:38.900 --> 3:10:40.020
 He's very conservative.

3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:42.460
 So fucking what?

3:10:43.660 --> 3:10:46.520
 He too deserves to be in that pantheon.

3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:50.860
 He is not. By the custodians of American education,

3:10:50.860 --> 3:10:53.220
 Clarence Thomas's name is not on that many schools.

3:10:53.220 --> 3:10:55.300
 Barack Obama's name will be on many of them.

3:10:55.300 --> 3:10:56.560
 I'm not equating them.

3:10:56.560 --> 3:10:57.460
 They're different people.

3:10:57.460 --> 3:10:59.560
 The offices are very different.

3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:01.980
 But the same logic that you just used

3:11:01.980 --> 3:11:07.020
 to extol the significance of Barack Obama's ascendancy

3:11:07.020 --> 3:11:10.260
 could and should be applied to Clarence Thomas,

3:11:10.260 --> 3:11:12.020
 in my opinion.

3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:17.020
 Yes, but it's the office, but also there is a resume

3:11:19.060 --> 3:11:20.580
 and there's accomplishments,

3:11:20.580 --> 3:11:23.620
 but then there is oratory and charisma

3:11:23.620 --> 3:11:25.480
 and a number of Twitter followers.

3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:31.200
 So there's ability to captivate a large number of people.

3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:33.140
 And that's a skill.

3:11:33.140 --> 3:11:35.860
 That's a skill that correlates,

3:11:35.860 --> 3:11:38.740
 but is not directly connected to

3:11:38.740 --> 3:11:40.820
 with how impressive your resume is.

3:11:40.820 --> 3:11:43.180
 I agree, and moreover, the judicial function,

3:11:43.180 --> 3:11:45.460
 the judge doesn't go out and give speeches of that sort

3:11:45.460 --> 3:11:48.300
 because it's exactly antithetical to what he's doing.

3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:50.420
 He's a custodian of the law,

3:11:50.420 --> 3:11:53.660
 and that's not a popular feature,

3:11:53.660 --> 3:11:54.820
 figure in American policy.

3:11:54.820 --> 3:11:57.780
 He doesn't stand for election, and it's a good thing too.

3:11:57.780 --> 3:11:59.740
 So I take that point.

3:11:59.740 --> 3:12:01.140
 Here, I want to say something else, though,

3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:02.340
 that's provocative.

3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:03.740
 The next black president,

3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:05.340
 you say the first black president

3:12:05.340 --> 3:12:06.980
 shouldn't have been the one to do that.

3:12:06.980 --> 3:12:08.540
 The second one should,

3:12:08.540 --> 3:12:10.540
 is more likely than not gonna be a Republican.

3:12:10.540 --> 3:12:12.380
 I'm not, I don't have a particular person in mind.

3:12:12.380 --> 3:12:13.220
 I'm just saying.

3:12:13.220 --> 3:12:16.300
 I agree, I agree, I agree.

3:12:17.420 --> 3:12:19.520
 And that's why it's gonna be super fun.

3:12:20.620 --> 3:12:25.380
 Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat

3:12:25.380 --> 3:12:27.560
 and give advice to young people.

3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:28.980
 So if you're talking to somebody

3:12:28.980 --> 3:12:31.100
 who's in high school, in college,

3:12:31.100 --> 3:12:34.300
 what advice would you give them about their career,

3:12:34.300 --> 3:12:37.300
 about life in general,

3:12:37.300 --> 3:12:39.340
 how to live a life they can be proud of?

3:12:39.340 --> 3:12:44.180
 Well, I'd say the world is your oyster.

3:12:44.180 --> 3:12:46.020
 I mean, first order of business, you're not a victim.

3:12:46.020 --> 3:12:47.060
 I don't care what color you are.

3:12:47.060 --> 3:12:47.980
 I don't care, you're male, female,

3:12:47.980 --> 3:12:49.460
 you're gay, straight, whatever.

3:12:49.460 --> 3:12:51.280
 The world is your oyster.

3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:52.340
 You are so privileged.

3:12:52.340 --> 3:12:54.060
 You sit here in the United States of America,

3:12:54.060 --> 3:12:55.340
 a free country, a rich country,

3:12:55.340 --> 3:12:56.860
 everything is possible for you.

3:12:56.860 --> 3:12:59.380
 Believe me, you can do anything, okay?

3:13:00.700 --> 3:13:05.700
 Secondly, I would say mastery over the medium

3:13:05.700 --> 3:13:10.700
 in which we're embedded is the key to the future.

3:13:11.780 --> 3:13:15.420
 So get educated, focus, work hard,

3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:21.700
 invest in your future by acquiring the skills that you need

3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:23.980
 to be able to navigate the 21st century.

3:13:25.500 --> 3:13:28.500
 I would say the Chinese are coming

3:13:28.500 --> 3:13:30.340
 and I don't mean anything against China.

3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:32.180
 I just mean to say the world's a small place

3:13:32.180 --> 3:13:34.500
 and it's getting smaller.

3:13:34.500 --> 3:13:39.500
 And you better get moving and you better get moving quickly.

3:13:43.140 --> 3:13:47.340
 I'd say your identity, your coloration, your orientation,

3:13:47.340 --> 3:13:52.340
 your category is not the most important thing about you.

3:13:56.260 --> 3:14:00.940
 So the temptation to limit yourself,

3:14:00.940 --> 3:14:03.120
 I give this speech to my kids.

3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:08.120
 I would say, I quote James Joyce.

3:14:10.780 --> 3:14:15.780
 He has a passage in Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man

3:14:16.860 --> 3:14:21.180
 in which he says, do you know what Ireland is?

3:14:22.060 --> 3:14:27.020
 Ireland is an old sow that eats her pharaoh.

3:14:27.020 --> 3:14:28.940
 This is Joyce.

3:14:28.940 --> 3:14:32.700
 He says, Stephan Daedalus is the character

3:14:32.700 --> 3:14:35.300
 that he has in mind in this Chronicle.

3:14:35.300 --> 3:14:39.940
 He says, your ethnic inheritance,

3:14:39.940 --> 3:14:42.040
 he's talking about Irish nationalism,

3:14:43.380 --> 3:14:46.300
 are like nets holding you back.

3:14:46.300 --> 3:14:49.780
 That your challenge is to learn how to turn those nets

3:14:49.780 --> 3:14:54.020
 into wings and thereby to fly, okay?

3:14:54.020 --> 3:14:58.200
 Flying into the open skies of modern society.

3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:02.540
 Don't be your grandfather, don't be your father.

3:15:02.540 --> 3:15:04.400
 Don't wear your things so heavily

3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:06.020
 that it keeps you from being open

3:15:06.020 --> 3:15:08.700
 to everything that's new in the world.

3:15:08.700 --> 3:15:10.540
 Wear it lightly.

3:15:10.540 --> 3:15:12.220
 Yes, everybody comes from somewhere,

3:15:12.220 --> 3:15:14.320
 but it doesn't have to be where you end up.

3:15:15.380 --> 3:15:18.520
 So you're not your father, you're not your grandfather.

3:15:19.540 --> 3:15:24.540
 You are this wonderfully blessed human being

3:15:25.020 --> 3:15:28.380
 in the middle of, going into the middle of the 21st century

3:15:28.380 --> 3:15:33.380
 and don't miss it, don't live blinkeredly,

3:15:34.940 --> 3:15:37.720
 don't live small, live big.

3:15:41.100 --> 3:15:46.100
 Live big and wear your history lightly.

3:15:48.020 --> 3:15:51.300
 Yeah, everybody's got a mother tongue,

3:15:51.300 --> 3:15:54.420
 everybody's got a story, everybody has a people,

3:15:54.420 --> 3:15:56.720
 but the world is a small place.

3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:01.720
 I love that you're quoting an Irishman.

3:16:01.720 --> 3:16:05.760
 One of the greatest writers of the 20th century,

3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:09.240
 a profound one, but an Irishman nevertheless.

3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:14.240
 The levels of humor within that is not lost on me.

3:16:14.480 --> 3:16:16.900
 Let me just mention the great Ralph Ellison,

3:16:16.900 --> 3:16:19.280
 the African American writer, Invisible Man

3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:23.900
 is his masterpiece, embodied this spirit.

3:16:23.900 --> 3:16:26.760
 Okay, we black Americans, we do come from somewhere,

3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:29.800
 that come in from somewhere is from slavery in America,

3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:32.880
 that's our ancestral heritage.

3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:37.320
 But that's not what we are, skin and bone,

3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:40.160
 these are superficial things, the spirit.

3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:41.880
 And if I were a more religious person,

3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:44.200
 I could give a whole disposition about that,

3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:46.300
 but it's the spirit, it's that light that's inside,

3:16:46.300 --> 3:16:48.600
 that's who we are and our challenge

3:16:48.600 --> 3:16:50.640
 is to live in the fullness of it,

3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:53.480
 as opposed to this blinkered thing

3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:55.200
 where we don't look left, we don't look right,

3:16:55.200 --> 3:16:59.960
 we're just fitting within this template that we inherit.

3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:02.760
 That is a travesty, really.

3:17:03.780 --> 3:17:07.400
 Glenn, you've lived an incredible life, a productive one,

3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:11.600
 but just representing some powerful ideas,

3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:15.920
 some powerful ideals, but life comes to an end.

3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:18.440
 Yeah.

3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:20.900
 Do you think about your death?

3:17:20.900 --> 3:17:24.120
 Are you afraid of it?

3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:29.120
 Well, it is a really interesting coincidence

3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:31.680
 that you posed me that question,

3:17:33.080 --> 3:17:35.100
 because I'm coming from a funeral.

3:17:37.560 --> 3:17:42.560
 Today is Sunday, on the preceding Tuesday, five days ago,

3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:48.120
 I was at the funeral of Eugene Wesley Smith,

3:17:48.120 --> 3:17:53.120
 who was my brother in law, he was my sister's husband.

3:17:55.080 --> 3:18:00.080
 My sister, Leonette, passed away in August of 2021.

3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:06.520
 Her husband has died at the age of 68 in April of 2022,

3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:11.060
 and I was at his funeral.

3:18:12.560 --> 3:18:14.140
 He died suddenly of a heart attack

3:18:14.140 --> 3:18:15.660
 that came completely out of the blue.

3:18:15.660 --> 3:18:18.480
 He seemed to be in perfect health.

3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:20.440
 He was a magnificent human being.

3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:24.600
 I could go into the details, but take my word for it.

3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:29.120
 He was a businessman, a steel trader, metals trader.

3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:30.880
 He would buy and sell.

3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:32.740
 He worked mostly from his home office.

3:18:32.740 --> 3:18:35.240
 He had clients, counterparties,

3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:37.540
 people he did business with all over the world.

3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:44.120
 He had three sons, one of whom is in his early 30s,

3:18:44.120 --> 3:18:45.760
 two of whom are in their late 30s.

3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:48.000
 These are my sister's children.

3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:50.480
 She's deceased, now he's deceased.

3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:54.520
 The older two sons are severely developmentally disabled,

3:18:54.520 --> 3:18:57.400
 and although they're in their late 30s,

3:18:57.400 --> 3:18:59.860
 they're not independently viable.

3:18:59.860 --> 3:19:02.000
 They don't function effectively.

3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:03.300
 They have to be cared for.

3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:08.240
 That responsibility has now fallen to the family,

3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:12.680
 but mainly to the surviving son who lives with his wife

3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:14.880
 and his two young children,

3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:17.060
 and has assumed the responsibility.

3:19:17.060 --> 3:19:20.440
 They've cared at home, my sister and her husband, Wesley,

3:19:20.440 --> 3:19:24.960
 Eugene Wesley Smith, cared for their disabled sons at home.

3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:26.680
 They didn't want to see them institutionalized.

3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:29.260
 They had some help from programs at the state

3:19:29.260 --> 3:19:30.400
 and social worker and so on,

3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:32.400
 but they mainly took on the burden

3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:34.540
 of caring for them at home.

3:19:34.540 --> 3:19:36.160
 Anyway, I go on at length here,

3:19:36.160 --> 3:19:38.440
 and I don't know how much of this you will choose

3:19:38.440 --> 3:19:41.240
 to make use of, and it doesn't matter, really.

3:19:41.240 --> 3:19:43.240
 I'm just trying to respond to your question.

3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:47.220
 I was asked to offer some remarks at the funeral,

3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:51.000
 and I offered them.

3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:56.000
 And I spoke well of this great man.

3:19:56.160 --> 3:19:57.040
 He was a great man.

3:19:57.040 --> 3:19:59.040
 He had a straight back.

3:19:59.040 --> 3:20:00.200
 He was a standup guy.

3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:01.680
 He could be counted on.

3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:02.720
 His word was his bond.

3:20:02.720 --> 3:20:04.160
 He had broad shoulders.

3:20:04.160 --> 3:20:06.480
 He carried a lot of people with him,

3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:08.960
 business associates, family members,

3:20:08.960 --> 3:20:10.560
 and so forth and so on.

3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:12.080
 He had a huge heart.

3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:13.960
 He was a giving and kind person.

3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:15.200
 He had a great mind.

3:20:15.200 --> 3:20:18.320
 He was an intellectual, even though as a businessman,

3:20:18.320 --> 3:20:23.320
 much of his day was taken up with the minutia of contracts

3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:27.560
 and the details of the order being delivered

3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:28.440
 and not being delivered,

3:20:28.440 --> 3:20:30.120
 of the quality of the product,

3:20:30.120 --> 3:20:32.080
 of the financing, and so forth and so on.

3:20:32.080 --> 3:20:34.140
 There was still a powerful mind there.

3:20:34.140 --> 3:20:36.560
 Yeah, he was a powerful mind, and he studied.

3:20:36.560 --> 3:20:37.380
 He read books.

3:20:37.380 --> 3:20:38.880
 He was interested in music and art.

3:20:38.880 --> 3:20:42.240
 He was a spiritual seeker,

3:20:43.360 --> 3:20:46.200
 had been ordained as a child minister in his youth,

3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:51.200
 and while he remained a master of the Christian canon,

3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:58.400
 he also explored Eastern religion and other spiritual paths

3:20:58.680 --> 3:21:01.880
 and kind of stood above any particular tradition

3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:03.720
 as a man who believed in God

3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:06.880
 but thought that God manifests himself in many ways

3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:09.400
 to human beings and that there was much to learn

3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:12.020
 from other religious traditions as well.

3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:13.200
 This is Wesley.

3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:14.640
 We called him Wesley by his middle name,

3:21:14.640 --> 3:21:15.800
 Eugene Wesley Smith.

3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:17.000
 May he rest in peace.

3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:18.800
 68.

3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:20.960
 That's five years younger than I am right now.

3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:23.200
 He dropped dead without any warning.

3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:24.220
 I could, too.

3:21:25.720 --> 3:21:26.920
 So.

3:21:26.920 --> 3:21:29.000
 How did that make you feel?

3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:31.660
 What were the thoughts in your mind leading up to it,

3:21:31.660 --> 3:21:34.400
 having to give that speech in the days that followed?

3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:35.240
 Well, first of all, I wondered,

3:21:35.240 --> 3:21:36.640
 what would I say, what would I say?

3:21:36.640 --> 3:21:38.480
 And, you know, there was no way to prepare,

3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:41.920
 and I decided, you know, I rehearsed in my mind this,

3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:43.800
 you know, he had straight back, he had broad shoulders,

3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:45.680
 he had a big heart, he had a great mind,

3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.520
 you know, he had a capacious spirit and whatnot,

3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:52.480
 and I used that as a template for making my remarks.

3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:54.540
 But my main thought was, my God,

3:21:54.540 --> 3:21:57.480
 life is precious and life is fleeting,

3:21:57.480 --> 3:21:59.740
 and death is a part of life.

3:22:00.840 --> 3:22:03.280
 My death is a part of my life.

3:22:03.280 --> 3:22:05.760
 And I thought, you know, well,

3:22:05.760 --> 3:22:07.920
 I want to take better care of myself than I do,

3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:09.940
 you know, et cetera, et cetera.

3:22:09.940 --> 3:22:13.620
 But I also thought, a lot of this is not in my hands at all.

3:22:13.620 --> 3:22:16.840
 I thought, one should have his affairs in order.

3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:18.880
 My brother did not have all of his affairs in order,

3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:21.340
 in the sense that there is a lot of,

3:22:21.340 --> 3:22:22.600
 you know, things are going to probate,

3:22:22.600 --> 3:22:24.360
 there was no will, there's, you know,

3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:26.160
 it's kind of unsettled.

3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:30.280
 I don't want that to happen to my surviving family members.

3:22:30.280 --> 3:22:34.480
 I want to have my affairs such that, should heaven forbid,

3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:37.120
 I fall over one day and don't get up again.

3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:39.860
 People don't have to scramble about

3:22:39.860 --> 3:22:43.440
 how to take care of things from that point forward.

3:22:43.440 --> 3:22:45.400
 But as a human, are you afraid?

3:22:47.280 --> 3:22:48.120
 In your own heart.

3:22:48.120 --> 3:22:48.960
 I'm afraid.

3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:51.280
 Now, I read this wonderful book called The Swerve.

3:22:52.240 --> 3:22:53.840
 It's about Lucretius.

3:22:53.840 --> 3:22:56.620
 It's about the nature of things,

3:22:56.620 --> 3:23:00.360
 which is this great classical work from the Roman period

3:23:01.440 --> 3:23:03.720
 by this guy, Lucretius.

3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:05.540
 And I'm trying to think of the name of the author,

3:23:05.540 --> 3:23:06.600
 but you could look it up.

3:23:06.600 --> 3:23:07.840
 The Swerve is the book.

3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:11.120
 It won like a National Book Award or a Pulitzer Prize.

3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:13.660
 And it's the history of the recovery of this book

3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:20.800
 by one of these Italian, Renaissance Italian people

3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:24.500
 who would go into the monasteries in Central Europe

3:23:24.500 --> 3:23:27.200
 and look through the scrolls and they discover

3:23:27.200 --> 3:23:29.560
 these classical works from antiquity,

3:23:29.560 --> 3:23:31.840
 which had been lost through the dark ages

3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:36.840
 and they republish and read these works.

3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:41.080
 And Lucretius's great work on the nature of things

3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:45.360
 was one of these books, Poggio Broccolini.

3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:47.000
 I don't remember the Italian guy's name,

3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.360
 but this all could be looked up.

3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:51.480
 Yeah, Poggio Broccolini.

3:23:51.480 --> 3:23:56.480
 15th century and the name of the author

3:23:58.200 --> 3:23:59.880
 is Stephen Greenblatt.

3:23:59.880 --> 3:24:02.400
 Yeah, Stephen Greenblatt, a magnificent book

3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:04.960
 and a terrific story.

3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:09.880
 Anyway, one of Lucretius's points, he was an atheist.

3:24:09.880 --> 3:24:11.640
 I mean, he was a Roman.

3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:15.240
 I mean, he didn't believe in mysticism.

3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:20.240
 And he argued it's irrational to be afraid of death.

3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:21.920
 Why should I fear death?

3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:23.360
 Death is coming to all of us.

3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:27.040
 The point of being afraid, I mean, I'm wasting my time

3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:30.120
 fearing something that I have no ultimate control over.

3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:32.040
 It's irrational to be afraid of death.

3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:38.240
 Yeah, because you can't predict when it happens.

3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:41.480
 You only know that it happens.

3:24:41.480 --> 3:24:43.080
 So why be afraid?

3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:43.920
 How's that?

3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:45.120
 And therefore live every day fully,

3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:49.760
 live every day purposefully, you know,

3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:52.200
 and so on, but these are all just words.

3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:55.040
 You know, I don't wanna die.

3:24:55.040 --> 3:24:55.880
 I wanna live forever.

3:24:55.880 --> 3:24:57.480
 I'm not gonna live forever.

3:24:57.480 --> 3:24:59.680
 I don't wanna suffer.

3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:01.040
 I see people suffering.

3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:04.200
 I saw my late wife, Linda Datcher Lowry,

3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:08.400
 Dr. Linda Datcher Lowry, professor of economics

3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:12.400
 at Tufts University, whom I met in graduate school at MIT,

3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:14.680
 black woman from Baltimore.

3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:17.240
 We married, we raised two sons together.

3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:22.120
 She died at the age of 59 from metastatic breast cancer.

3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:24.280
 And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.

3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:25.440
 And it took a while.

3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:30.360
 And we cared for her at home right up until the very end.

3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:35.000
 She died in our bed with our sons on either side of her.

3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:38.320
 And the dog curled up by the door,

3:25:38.320 --> 3:25:42.080
 the porch door in the bedroom, and she expired.

3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:45.560
 And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.

3:25:45.560 --> 3:25:46.880
 And I don't wanna suffer.

3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:48.360
 Who does?

3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:50.080
 I don't wanna die.

3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:53.120
 I am likely to suffer before I die.

3:25:54.280 --> 3:25:58.040
 I am likely to see my death coming and to lament it.

3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:04.080
 There's a book by Richard John Newhouse, the theologian,

3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:07.280
 called As I Lay Dying,

3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:10.200
 As I Lay Dying, Richard John Newhouse.

3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:15.920
 He had stomach cancer and he thought he was dying.

3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:18.720
 And he wrote this book As I Lay Dying.

3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:22.720
 And then he recovered, he went into remission

3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:24.200
 and he had another couple of years.

3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:27.240
 He thought he was dying and he had another couple of years.

3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:30.800
 And I can remember meeting him at a bookstore

3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:34.200
 in suburban Boston when he was on a tour.

3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:35.920
 He was just a friend of mine,

3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:38.720
 a theologian and a public intellectual.

3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:43.360
 He founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life

3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:45.880
 in New York City, which still exists,

3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:47.760
 Richard John Newhouse.

3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:49.360
 And he's contemplating his own death

3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:51.280
 from the point of view of a Christian minister.

3:26:51.280 --> 3:26:53.280
 He was first a Lutheran pastor

3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:55.840
 and then he converted to Catholicism

3:26:55.840 --> 3:26:58.240
 or as he would have put it, I returned to the church

3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:00.800
 because he thought the Renaissance was over.

3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:03.200
 I mean, I'm sorry, the Reformation,

3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:04.040
 Richard thought was over.

3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:07.960
 He says there's only one church, et cetera.

3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:11.160
 Get into theology stuff here.

3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:14.120
 But I'm saying all that to say,

3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:16.600
 I read that book aloud to my wife, Linda,

3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:17.960
 as she lay dying in that bed.

3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:21.760
 I read that book and it was filled with hope.

3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.320
 I mean, it first acknowledged the dread.

3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:27.760
 Yes, I lie dying.

3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:29.320
 I don't wanna die.

3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:30.680
 I'm a Christian minister.

3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:32.480
 Christ was raised from the dead.

3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:34.120
 I'm supposed to believe in everlasting life

3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:35.640
 but the fact of the matter is this is me

3:27:35.640 --> 3:27:37.600
 and I'm lying here and I'm dying.

3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:39.000
 This is the end of me.

3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:42.160
 How are you gonna do anything other than dread

3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:43.000
 the end of me?

3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:45.520
 So let's acknowledge that I don't wanna die, okay?

3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:47.880
 I'm just gonna tell you that upfront.

3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:52.880
 But that is not the end of,

3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:55.680
 my death is not the end of life.

3:27:55.680 --> 3:27:58.160
 I have lived well and fully.

3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:01.320
 I will go and do my best right up until the end.

3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:04.640
 I will accept what is inevitable

3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:07.000
 and I will hold out this belief.

3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:09.360
 And he's a Christian minister so he holds out this belief.

3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:12.000
 And he knows that the belief is not rational.

3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:16.840
 It's not a reasoned deductive scientific conclusion.

3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:21.440
 It's spiritual in the most fundamental way.

3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:25.000
 It is something that people hold on to and they have hope

3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:26.000
 and he had hope.

3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:29.360
 I don't know if I have that hope.

3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:34.360
 I used to be, but I'm no longer a Christian

3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:39.560
 and I'm no longer a theist really.

3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:42.480
 I'm with Lucretius there.

3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:46.560
 I mean, there's no magic that's going on here.

3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:49.400
 There's no unseen hand behind the scene

3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:51.080
 that's arranging things.

3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:54.000
 What I believe is that when I look at the natural world,

3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:56.520
 I see the evolution of the species

3:28:56.520 --> 3:28:59.760
 and I see the organic development of the planets.

3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:02.480
 I mean, the earth is going to not exist

3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:04.480
 in a finite number of years.

3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:06.280
 I think with a very high probability,

3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:08.480
 the sun is gonna die.

3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:10.520
 It's gonna implode.

3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:13.240
 It's gonna go supernova, whatever is gonna happen.

3:29:13.240 --> 3:29:16.800
 And there's not gonna be any there, there.

3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:19.680
 What's the meaning of life, Glen Lowry?

3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:21.160
 That's the meaning of life.

3:29:21.160 --> 3:29:23.960
 Yeah, let's go, let's go.

3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:25.040
 What's the why?

3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:29.960
 Or is that something economists and social scientists

3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:32.200
 and mathematicians are not equipped to answer?

3:29:33.480 --> 3:29:34.320
 Surely.

3:29:34.320 --> 3:29:38.040
 You know, I think we try to live well and meaningfully

3:29:38.040 --> 3:29:39.640
 within our time.

3:29:39.640 --> 3:29:43.120
 We bond, we reproduce, we try to pass on

3:29:43.120 --> 3:29:48.120
 and we accept our limitations and our mortality.

3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:50.560
 We try to contribute

3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:57.800
 and that's through our children and through our work.

3:30:00.640 --> 3:30:03.640
 And we're in this together, we're not in this alone.

3:30:03.640 --> 3:30:08.400
 We are connected to other people.

3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:11.160
 I get a lot of gratitude out of teaching.

3:30:11.160 --> 3:30:12.080
 I'm a teacher.

3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:16.120
 My students are gonna outlive me.

3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:18.360
 They're gonna have students.

3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:19.760
 I'm a writer.

3:30:19.760 --> 3:30:20.920
 My writing is gonna outlive me.

3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:25.200
 I don't wanna be self important or pretentious here.

3:30:25.200 --> 3:30:27.240
 I doubt that I'm gonna be the James Joyce

3:30:27.240 --> 3:30:29.120
 of the 21st century.

3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:31.520
 They may not be reading my stuff in a hundred years

3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:36.320
 because people will certainly be reading Ulysses

3:30:36.320 --> 3:30:37.400
 in a hundred years.

3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:43.120
 But I try to have an impact on the world that I'm a part of

3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:46.200
 and try to leave a legacy that's dignified.

3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:49.200
 I mean, I could give some flowery words

3:30:49.200 --> 3:30:51.240
 here, truth seeking and whatnot.

3:30:51.240 --> 3:30:52.320
 What about love?

3:30:52.320 --> 3:30:53.160
 Love.

3:30:55.400 --> 3:30:59.520
 What role does love play in this life thing?

3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:00.880
 Love makes the world go round.

3:31:00.880 --> 3:31:03.400
 I mean, without love, I mean, what have we got?

3:31:03.400 --> 3:31:08.400
 I mean, we don't have family and, you know,

3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:16.680
 we certainly have missed out if love is not a central part

3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:18.440
 of our existence.

3:31:18.440 --> 3:31:20.240
 But stop asking me questions like that.

3:31:20.240 --> 3:31:21.840
 Yeah.

3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:24.320
 Glenn, thank you for doing everything you do,

3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:27.880
 for thinking the way you do, for being fearless and bold.

3:31:27.880 --> 3:31:32.280
 And the Glenn show and your writing and your work

3:31:32.280 --> 3:31:33.320
 and just being who you are.

3:31:33.320 --> 3:31:34.960
 Thank you for being you.

3:31:34.960 --> 3:31:37.080
 And thank you for giving me the huge honor

3:31:37.080 --> 3:31:39.800
 of spending your extremely valuable time with me today.

3:31:39.800 --> 3:31:40.840
 This was awesome.

3:31:40.840 --> 3:31:42.120
 It's been my pleasure, Lex.

3:31:42.120 --> 3:31:45.680
 I mean, really, and it has been like four hours, man.

3:31:45.680 --> 3:31:47.760
 You're wearing me out for me.

3:31:47.760 --> 3:31:49.280
 I love it.

3:31:49.280 --> 3:31:52.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Glenn Lowry.

3:31:55.800 --> 3:31:57.880
 And now let me leave you with some words

3:31:57.880 --> 3:32:00.440
 from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

3:32:00.440 --> 3:32:02.720
 If you can't fly, then run.

3:32:02.720 --> 3:32:05.200
 If you can't run, then walk.

3:32:05.200 --> 3:32:07.640
 If you can't walk, then crawl.

3:32:07.640 --> 3:32:11.480
 But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.

3:32:11.480 --> 3:32:26.760
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
