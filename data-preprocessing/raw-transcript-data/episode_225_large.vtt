00:00.000 --> 00:03.060
 The following is a conversation with Jeff Schoenlein,

00:03.060 --> 00:04.600
 a scientist at NIST

00:04.600 --> 00:08.440
 interested in optoelectronic intelligence.

00:08.440 --> 00:12.160
 We have a deep technical dive into computing hardware

00:12.160 --> 00:14.080
 that will make Jim Keller proud.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.440
 I urge you to hop onto this rollercoaster ride

00:17.440 --> 00:19.320
 through neuromorphic computing

00:19.320 --> 00:21.720
 and superconducting electronics

00:21.720 --> 00:24.360
 and hold on for dear life.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.200
 Jeff is a great communicator of technical information

00:27.200 --> 00:30.160
 and so it was truly a pleasure to talk to him

00:30.160 --> 00:32.300
 about some physics and engineering.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.440
 To support this podcast,

 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.880
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast

00:39.880 --> 00:43.380
 and here is my conversation with Jeff Schoenlein.

00:44.380 --> 00:48.920
 I got a chance to read a fascinating paper you authored

00:48.920 --> 00:52.040
 called Optoelectronic Intelligence.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.180
 So maybe we can start by talking about this paper

00:55.180 --> 00:57.060
 and start with the basic questions.

00:57.060 --> 01:00.360
 What is optoelectronic intelligence?

01:00.360 --> 01:02.040
 Yeah, so in that paper,

01:02.040 --> 01:04.280
 the concept I was trying to describe

01:04.280 --> 01:06.680
 is sort of an architecture

01:06.680 --> 01:10.820
 for building brain inspired computing

01:10.820 --> 01:13.380
 that leverages light for communication

01:13.380 --> 01:17.640
 in conjunction with electronic circuits for computation.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.920
 In that particular paper,

01:18.920 --> 01:20.880
 a lot of the work we're doing right now

01:20.880 --> 01:22.000
 in our project at NIST

01:22.000 --> 01:25.840
 is focused on superconducting electronics for computation.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.760
 I won't go into why that is,

01:27.760 --> 01:31.440
 but that might make a little more sense in context

01:31.440 --> 01:35.440
 if we first describe what that is in contrast to,

01:35.440 --> 01:37.880
 which is semiconducting electronics.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.720
 So is it worth taking a couple minutes

01:39.720 --> 01:42.820
 to describe semiconducting electronics?

01:42.820 --> 01:45.960
 It might even be worthwhile to step back

01:45.960 --> 01:49.960
 and talk about electricity and circuits

01:49.960 --> 01:52.240
 and how circuits work

01:52.240 --> 01:54.760
 before we talk about superconductivity.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.560
 Right, okay.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.080
 How does a computer work, Jeff?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.800
 Well, I won't go into everything

01:59.800 --> 02:01.120
 that makes a computer work,

02:01.120 --> 02:05.200
 but let's talk about the basic building blocks,

02:05.200 --> 02:08.440
 a transistor, and even more basic than that,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.520
 a semiconductor material, silicon, say.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.440
 So in silicon, silicon is a semiconductor,

02:15.440 --> 02:18.440
 and what that means is at low temperature,

02:18.440 --> 02:20.760
 there are no free charges,

02:20.760 --> 02:22.880
 no free electrons that can move around.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.920
 So when you talk about electricity,

02:24.920 --> 02:28.040
 you're talking about predominantly electrons

02:28.040 --> 02:30.780
 moving to establish electrical currents,

02:30.780 --> 02:33.080
 and they move under the influence of voltages.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.640
 So you apply voltages, electrons move around,

02:36.640 --> 02:38.420
 those can be measured as currents,

02:38.420 --> 02:40.920
 and you can represent information in that way.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.840
 So semiconductors are special

02:43.840 --> 02:46.860
 in the sense that they are really malleable.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.200
 So if you have a semiconductor material,

02:50.080 --> 02:52.600
 you can change the number of free electrons

02:52.600 --> 02:56.020
 that can move around by putting different elements,

02:56.020 --> 02:58.280
 different atoms in lattice sites.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.200
 So what is a lattice site?

03:00.200 --> 03:02.200
 Well, a semiconductor is a crystal,

03:02.200 --> 03:06.480
 which means all the atoms that comprise the material

03:06.480 --> 03:09.000
 are at exact locations

03:09.000 --> 03:10.880
 that are perfectly periodic in space.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.220
 So if you start at any one atom

03:12.220 --> 03:14.660
 and you go along what are called the lattice vectors,

03:14.660 --> 03:17.320
 you get to another atom and another atom and another atom,

03:17.320 --> 03:19.440
 and for high quality devices,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.920
 it's important that it's a perfect crystal

03:21.920 --> 03:23.820
 with very few defects,

03:23.820 --> 03:27.440
 but you can intentionally replace a silicon atom

03:27.440 --> 03:29.240
 with say a phosphorus atom,

03:29.240 --> 03:32.160
 and then you can change the number of free electrons

03:32.160 --> 03:33.980
 that are in a region of space

03:33.980 --> 03:37.140
 that has that excess of what are called dopants.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.260
 So picture a device that has a left terminal

03:40.260 --> 03:42.040
 and a right terminal,

03:42.040 --> 03:44.160
 and if you apply a voltage between those two,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.740
 you can cause electrical current to flow between them.

03:47.740 --> 03:52.120
 Now we add a third terminal up on top there,

03:52.120 --> 03:53.800
 and depending on the voltage

03:53.800 --> 03:57.160
 between the left and right terminal and that third voltage,

03:57.160 --> 03:58.720
 you can change that current.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.280
 So what's commonly done in digital electronic circuits

04:02.280 --> 04:06.560
 is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right,

04:06.560 --> 04:08.600
 and then change that voltage

04:08.600 --> 04:10.000
 that's applied at what's called the gate,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.220
 the gate of the transistor.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.960
 So what you do is you make it to where

04:13.960 --> 04:15.680
 there's an excess of electrons on the left,

04:15.680 --> 04:17.360
 excess of electrons on the right,

04:17.360 --> 04:18.880
 and very few electrons in the middle,

04:18.880 --> 04:21.520
 and you do this by changing the concentration

04:21.520 --> 04:24.800
 of different dopants in the lattice spatially.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.900
 And then when you apply a voltage to that gate,

04:27.900 --> 04:30.680
 you can either cause current to flow or turn it off,

04:30.680 --> 04:33.440
 and so that's sort of your zero and one.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.360
 If you apply voltage, current can flow,

04:35.360 --> 04:38.380
 that current is representing a digital one,

04:38.380 --> 04:41.960
 and from that, from that basic element,

04:41.960 --> 04:44.200
 you can build up all the complexity

04:44.200 --> 04:45.520
 of digital electronic circuits

04:45.520 --> 04:50.080
 that have really had a profound influence on our society.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.600
 Now you're talking about electrons.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.680
 Can you give a sense of what scale we're talking about

04:54.680 --> 04:56.520
 when we're talking about in silicon

04:57.600 --> 05:01.560
 being able to mass manufacture these kinds of gates?

05:01.560 --> 05:04.480
 Yeah, so scale in a number of different senses.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.520
 Well, at the scale of the silicon lattice,

05:07.520 --> 05:10.880
 the distance between two atoms there is half a nanometer.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.480
 So people often like to compare these things

05:14.480 --> 05:16.540
 to the width of a human hair.

05:16.540 --> 05:20.040
 I think it's some six orders of magnitude smaller

05:20.040 --> 05:24.440
 than the width of a human hair, something on that order.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.840
 So remarkably small,

05:25.840 --> 05:27.280
 we're talking about individual atoms here,

05:27.280 --> 05:29.480
 and electrons are of that length scale

05:29.480 --> 05:31.520
 when they're in that environment.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.440
 But there's another sense

05:32.440 --> 05:34.380
 that scale matters in digital electronics.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.460
 This is perhaps the more important sense,

05:36.460 --> 05:37.880
 although they're related.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.340
 Scale refers to a number of things.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.560
 It refers to the size of that transistor.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.280
 So for example, I said you have a left contact,

05:47.280 --> 05:49.800
 a right contact, and some space between them

05:49.800 --> 05:52.280
 where the gate electrode sits.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.000
 That's called the channel width or the channel length.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.120
 And what has enabled what we think of as Moore's law

06:00.120 --> 06:03.040
 or the continued increased performance

06:03.040 --> 06:05.560
 in silicon microelectronic circuits

06:05.560 --> 06:08.960
 is the ability to make that size, that feature size,

06:08.960 --> 06:13.960
 ever smaller, ever smaller at a really remarkable pace.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.800
 I mean, that feature size has decreased consistently

06:20.160 --> 06:23.760
 every couple of years since the 1960s.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.160
 And that was what Moore predicted in the 1960s.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.480
 He thought it would continue for at least two more decades,

06:29.480 --> 06:30.800
 and it's been much longer than that.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.800
 And so that is why we've been able to fit ever more devices,

06:35.800 --> 06:39.000
 ever more transistors, ever more computational power

06:39.000 --> 06:41.440
 on essentially the same size of chip.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.400
 So a user sits back and does essentially nothing.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.960
 You're running the same computer program,

06:45.960 --> 06:48.360
 but those devices are getting smaller, so they get faster,

06:48.360 --> 06:50.080
 they get more energy efficient,

06:50.080 --> 06:51.520
 and all of our computing performance

06:51.520 --> 06:53.240
 just continues to improve.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.200
 And we don't have to think too hard

06:56.200 --> 06:59.200
 about what we're doing as, say,

06:59.200 --> 07:00.520
 a software designer or something like that.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.200
 I absolutely don't mean to say

07:02.200 --> 07:05.960
 that there's no innovation in software or the user side

07:05.960 --> 07:07.040
 of things, of course there is.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.400
 But from the hardware perspective,

07:09.400 --> 07:12.240
 we just have been given this gift

07:12.240 --> 07:14.520
 of continued performance improvement

07:14.520 --> 07:19.080
 through this scaling that is ever smaller feature sizes

07:19.080 --> 07:22.680
 with very similar, say, power consumption.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.880
 That power consumption has not continued to scale

07:25.880 --> 07:29.360
 in the most recent decades, but nevertheless,

07:29.360 --> 07:31.200
 we had a really good run there for a while.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.160
 And now we're down to gates that are seven nanometers,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.080
 which is state of the art right now.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.760
 Maybe GlobalFoundries is trying to push it

07:38.760 --> 07:39.600
 even lower than that.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.440
 I can't keep up with where the predictions are

07:42.440 --> 07:43.280
 that it's gonna end.

07:43.280 --> 07:48.280
 But seven nanometer transistor has just a few tens of atoms

07:49.880 --> 07:51.720
 along the length of the conduction pathway.

07:51.720 --> 07:56.640
 So a naive semiconductor device physicist

07:56.640 --> 07:58.560
 would think you can't go much further than that

07:58.560 --> 08:02.240
 without some kind of revolution in the way we think

08:02.240 --> 08:03.800
 about the physics of our devices.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.960
 Is there something to be said

08:04.960 --> 08:08.160
 about the mass manufacture of these devices?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.320
 Right, right, so that's another thing.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.800
 So how have we been able

08:10.800 --> 08:13.840
 to make those transistors smaller and smaller?

08:13.840 --> 08:17.720
 Well, companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries,

08:17.720 --> 08:20.280
 they invest a lot of money in the lithography.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.800
 So how are these chips actually made?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.320
 Well, one of the most important steps

08:24.320 --> 08:27.640
 is this what's called ion implantation.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.920
 So you start with sort of a pristine silicon crystal

08:31.920 --> 08:34.040
 and then using photolithography,

08:34.040 --> 08:36.440
 which is a technique where you can pattern

08:36.440 --> 08:38.760
 different shapes using light,

08:38.760 --> 08:41.360
 you can define which regions of space

08:41.360 --> 08:45.600
 you're going to implant with different species of ions

08:45.600 --> 08:46.560
 that are going to change

08:46.560 --> 08:49.520
 the local electrical properties right there.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.640
 So by using ever shorter wavelengths of light

08:52.640 --> 08:54.360
 and different kinds of optical techniques

08:54.360 --> 08:56.560
 and different kinds of lithographic techniques,

08:56.560 --> 09:00.920
 things that go far beyond my knowledge base,

09:00.920 --> 09:03.280
 you can just simply shrink that feature size down.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.640
 And you say you're at seven nanometers.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.200
 Well, the wavelength of light that's being used

09:07.200 --> 09:08.560
 is over a hundred nanometers.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.040
 That's already deep in the UV.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.520
 So how are those minute features patterned?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.720
 Well, there's an extraordinary amount of innovation

09:16.720 --> 09:18.000
 that has gone into that,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.080
 but nevertheless, it stayed very consistent

09:20.080 --> 09:21.720
 in this ever shrinking feature size.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.560
 And now the question is, can you make it smaller?

09:24.560 --> 09:26.760
 And even if you do, do you still continue

09:26.760 --> 09:28.120
 to get performance improvements?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.040
 But that's another kind of scaling

09:30.040 --> 09:34.080
 where these companies have been able to...

09:34.080 --> 09:36.840
 So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.600
 Well, that chip is not made as a chip.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.680
 It's made on a wafer.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.160
 And using photolithography,

09:43.160 --> 09:47.000
 you basically print the same pattern on different dyes

09:47.000 --> 09:49.160
 all across the wafer, multiple layers,

09:49.160 --> 09:53.120
 tens, probably a hundred some layers

09:53.120 --> 09:55.000
 in a mature foundry process.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.360
 And you do this on ever bigger wafers too.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.800
 That's another aspect of scaling

09:58.800 --> 10:00.680
 that's occurred in the last several decades.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.720
 So now you have this 300 millimeter wafer.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.040
 It's like as big as a pizza

10:04.040 --> 10:06.360
 and it has maybe a thousand processors on it.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.640
 And then you dice that up using a saw.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.520
 And now you can sell these things so cheap

10:11.520 --> 10:14.920
 because the manufacturing process was so streamlined.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.160
 I think a technology as revolutionary

10:17.160 --> 10:19.880
 as silicon microelectronics has to have

10:19.880 --> 10:23.480
 that kind of manufacturing scalability,

10:23.480 --> 10:25.400
 which I will just emphasize,

10:25.400 --> 10:28.920
 I believe is enabled by physics.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.480
 It's not, I mean, of course there's human ingenuity

10:31.480 --> 10:35.840
 that goes into it, but at least from my side where I sit,

10:35.840 --> 10:38.760
 it sure looks like the physics of our universe

10:38.760 --> 10:40.880
 allows us to produce that.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.720
 And we've discovered how more so than we've invented it,

10:45.720 --> 10:47.160
 although of course we have invented it,

10:47.160 --> 10:48.440
 humans have invented it,

10:48.440 --> 10:50.960
 but it's almost as if it was there

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
 waiting for us to discover it.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.160
 You mean the entirety of it

10:54.160 --> 10:55.920
 or are you specifically talking about

10:55.920 --> 10:58.320
 the techniques of photolithography,

10:58.320 --> 10:59.680
 like the optics involved?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.560
 I mean, the entirety of the scaling down

11:02.560 --> 11:04.320
 to the seven nanometers,

11:04.320 --> 11:08.200
 you're able to have electrons not interfere with each other

11:08.200 --> 11:11.280
 in such a way that you could still have gates.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.320
 Like that's enabled.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.560
 To achieve that scale, spatial and temporal,

11:16.560 --> 11:18.720
 it seems to be very special

11:18.720 --> 11:21.480
 and is enabled by the physics of our world.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.760
 All of the things you just said.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.960
 So starting with the silicon material itself,

11:25.960 --> 11:28.760
 silicon is a unique semiconductor.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.560
 It has essentially ideal properties

11:31.560 --> 11:33.720
 for making a specific kind of transistor

11:33.720 --> 11:35.200
 that's extraordinarily useful.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.560
 So I mentioned that silicon has,

11:39.560 --> 11:40.640
 well, when you make a transistor,

11:40.640 --> 11:42.000
 you have this gate contact

11:42.000 --> 11:44.520
 that sits on top of the conduction channel.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.240
 And depending on the voltage you apply there,

11:47.240 --> 11:50.000
 you pull more carriers into the conduction channel

11:50.000 --> 11:53.040
 or push them away so it becomes more or less conductive.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.680
 In order to have that work

11:54.680 --> 11:57.120
 without just sucking those carriers right into that contact,

11:57.120 --> 11:59.080
 you need a very thin insulator.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.200
 And part of scaling has been to gradually decrease

12:03.200 --> 12:06.040
 the thickness of that gate insulator

12:06.040 --> 12:09.040
 so that you can use a roughly similar voltage

12:09.040 --> 12:12.080
 and still have the same current voltage characteristics.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.600
 So the material that's used to do that,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.880
 or I should say was initially used to do that

12:16.880 --> 12:18.720
 was a silicon dioxide,

12:18.720 --> 12:21.800
 which just naturally grows on the silicon surface.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.080
 So you expose silicon to the atmosphere that we breathe

12:25.080 --> 12:27.560
 and well, if you're manufacturing,

12:27.560 --> 12:29.720
 you're gonna purify these gases,

12:29.720 --> 12:30.560
 but nevertheless,

12:30.560 --> 12:33.520
 that what's called a native oxide will grow there.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.040
 There are essentially no other materials

12:36.040 --> 12:37.480
 on the entire periodic table

12:37.480 --> 12:42.360
 that have as good of a gate insulator

12:42.360 --> 12:43.680
 as that silicon dioxide.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.280
 And that has to do with nothing but the physics

12:46.280 --> 12:49.240
 of the interaction between silicon and oxygen.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.240
 And if it wasn't that way,

12:51.240 --> 12:54.720
 transistors could not perform

12:54.720 --> 12:58.800
 in nearly the degree of capability that they have.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.880
 And that has to do with the way that the oxide grows,

13:02.880 --> 13:05.760
 the reduced density of defects there,

13:05.760 --> 13:08.600
 it's insulation, meaning essentially it's energy gaps.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.320
 You can apply a very large voltage there

13:10.320 --> 13:12.280
 without having current leak through it.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.520
 So that's physics right there.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.880
 There are other things too.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.840
 Silicon is a semiconductor in an elemental sense.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.560
 You only need silicon atoms.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.800
 A lot of other semiconductors,

13:22.800 --> 13:24.880
 you need two different kinds of atoms,

13:24.880 --> 13:26.800
 like a compound from group three

13:26.800 --> 13:28.560
 and a compound from group five.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.680
 That opens you up to lots of defects that can occur

13:31.680 --> 13:34.360
 where one atom's not sitting quite at the lattice site,

13:34.360 --> 13:35.960
 it is and it's switched with another one

13:35.960 --> 13:38.280
 that degrades performance.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.280
 But then also on the side that you mentioned

13:40.280 --> 13:42.040
 with the manufacturing,

13:43.480 --> 13:45.840
 we have access to light sources

13:45.840 --> 13:48.560
 that can produce these very short wavelengths of light.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.880
 How does photolithography occur?

13:50.880 --> 13:54.440
 Well, you actually put this polymer on top of your wafer

13:54.440 --> 13:56.200
 and you expose it to light,

13:56.200 --> 14:00.080
 and then you use a aqueous chemical processing

14:00.080 --> 14:03.440
 to dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light

14:03.440 --> 14:05.920
 and leave the regions that were not.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.520
 And we are blessed with these polymers

14:08.520 --> 14:09.640
 that have the right property

14:09.640 --> 14:13.560
 where they can cause scission events

14:13.560 --> 14:16.160
 where the polymer splits where a photon hits.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.720
 I mean, maybe that's not too surprising,

14:19.720 --> 14:21.520
 but I don't know, it all comes together

14:21.520 --> 14:24.240
 to have this really complex,

14:24.240 --> 14:26.120
 manufacturable ecosystem

14:26.120 --> 14:30.600
 where very sophisticated technologies can be devised

14:30.600 --> 14:33.000
 and it works quite well.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.360
 And amazingly, like you said,

14:34.360 --> 14:36.240
 with a wavelength at like 100 nanometers

14:36.240 --> 14:37.080
 or something like that,

14:37.080 --> 14:39.720
 you're still able to achieve on this polymer

14:39.720 --> 14:43.440
 precision of whatever we said, seven nanometers.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.720
 I think I've heard like four nanometers

14:45.720 --> 14:48.400
 being talked about, something like that.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.800
 If we could just pause on this

14:49.800 --> 14:52.080
 and we'll return to superconductivity,

14:52.080 --> 14:56.360
 but in this whole journey from a history perspective,

14:56.360 --> 14:58.400
 what do you think is the most beautiful

14:59.440 --> 15:01.680
 at the intersection of engineering and physics

15:01.680 --> 15:03.240
 to you in this whole process

15:03.240 --> 15:06.520
 that we talked about with silicon and photolithography,

15:06.520 --> 15:08.320
 things that people were able to achieve

15:08.320 --> 15:12.280
 in order to push Moore's law forward?

15:12.280 --> 15:13.640
 Is it the early days,

15:13.640 --> 15:16.240
 the invention of the transistor itself?

15:16.240 --> 15:19.280
 Is it some particular cool little thing

15:19.280 --> 15:21.960
 that maybe not many people know about?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.480
 Like, what do you think is most beautiful

15:24.480 --> 15:26.760
 in this whole process, journey?

15:26.760 --> 15:29.560
 The most beautiful is a little difficult to answer.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.040
 Let me try and sidestep it a little bit

15:32.040 --> 15:35.840
 and just say what strikes me about looking

15:35.840 --> 15:40.840
 at the history of silicon microelectronics is that,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.600
 so when quantum mechanics was developed,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.440
 people quickly began applying it to semiconductors

15:47.440 --> 15:49.360
 and it was broadly understood

15:49.360 --> 15:50.760
 that these are fascinating systems

15:50.760 --> 15:52.720
 and people cared about them for their basic physics,

15:52.720 --> 15:55.040
 but also their utility as devices.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.280
 And then the transistor was invented in the late forties

15:59.280 --> 16:02.080
 in a relatively crude experimental setup

16:02.080 --> 16:04.280
 where you just crammed a metal electrode

16:04.280 --> 16:08.040
 into the semiconductor and that was ingenious.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.920
 These people were able to make it work.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.840
 But so what I wanna get to that really strikes me

16:16.840 --> 16:19.320
 is that in those early days,

16:19.320 --> 16:21.200
 there were a number of different semiconductors

16:21.200 --> 16:22.120
 that were being considered.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.840
 They had different properties, different strengths,

16:23.840 --> 16:24.920
 different weaknesses.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.480
 Most people thought germanium was the way to go.

16:28.480 --> 16:33.480
 It had some nice properties related to things

16:33.680 --> 16:37.320
 about how the electrons move inside the lattice.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.800
 But other people thought that compound semiconductors

16:39.800 --> 16:42.000
 with group three and group five also had

16:42.000 --> 16:46.240
 really, really extraordinary properties

16:46.240 --> 16:50.080
 that might be conducive to making the best devices.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.560
 So there were different groups exploring each of these

16:52.560 --> 16:54.240
 and that's great, that's how science works.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.160
 You have to cast a broad net.

16:56.160 --> 17:01.160
 But then what I find striking is why is it that silicon won?

17:02.120 --> 17:05.280
 Because it's not that germanium is a useless material

17:05.280 --> 17:06.760
 and it's not present in technology

17:06.760 --> 17:08.080
 or compound semiconductors.

17:08.080 --> 17:12.640
 They're both doing exciting and important things,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.400
 slightly more niche applications

17:14.400 --> 17:18.080
 whereas silicon is the semiconductor material

17:18.080 --> 17:20.120
 for microelectronics which is the platform

17:20.120 --> 17:22.760
 for digital computing which has transformed our world.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.200
 Why did silicon win?

17:24.200 --> 17:28.720
 It's because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities

17:28.720 --> 17:32.120
 that no one of them was the clear winner

17:32.120 --> 17:34.560
 but it made these sort of compromises

17:34.560 --> 17:36.680
 between a number of different influences.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.520
 It had that really excellent gate oxide

17:40.520 --> 17:43.240
 that allowed us to make MOSFETs,

17:43.240 --> 17:45.400
 these high performance transistors,

17:45.400 --> 17:47.200
 so quickly and cheaply and easily

17:47.200 --> 17:49.360
 without having to do a lot of materials development.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.400
 The band gap of silicon is actually,

17:53.400 --> 17:56.280
 so in a semiconductor there's an important parameter

17:56.280 --> 17:57.480
 which is called the band gap

17:57.480 --> 18:00.600
 which tells you there are sort of electrons

18:00.600 --> 18:04.600
 that fill up to one level in the energy diagram

18:04.600 --> 18:06.800
 and then there's a gap where electrons aren't allowed

18:06.800 --> 18:08.280
 to have an energy in a certain range

18:08.280 --> 18:11.320
 and then there's another energy level above that.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.960
 And that difference between the lower sort of filled level

18:14.960 --> 18:16.880
 and the unoccupied level,

18:16.880 --> 18:19.640
 that tells you how much voltage you have to apply

18:19.640 --> 18:22.160
 in order to induce a current to flow.

18:22.160 --> 18:27.160
 So with germanium, that's about 0.75 electron volts.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.640
 That means you have to apply 0.75 volts

18:29.640 --> 18:32.000
 to get a current moving.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.280
 And it turns out that if you compare that

18:34.280 --> 18:38.520
 to the thermal excitations that are induced

18:38.520 --> 18:40.680
 just by the temperature of our environment,

18:40.680 --> 18:42.120
 that gap's not quite big enough.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.120
 You start to use it to perform computations,

18:45.120 --> 18:47.640
 it gets a little hot and you get all these accidental

18:47.640 --> 18:50.720
 carriers that are excited into the conduction band

18:50.720 --> 18:53.360
 and it causes errors in your computation.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.200
 Silicon's band gap is just a little higher,

18:56.200 --> 18:58.960
 1.1 electron volts,

18:58.960 --> 19:01.280
 but you have an exponential dependence

19:01.280 --> 19:04.200
 on the number of carriers that are present

19:04.200 --> 19:06.600
 that can induce those errors.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.480
 It decays exponentially with that voltage.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.760
 So just that slight extra energy in that band gap

19:12.760 --> 19:17.040
 really puts it in an ideal position to be operated

19:17.040 --> 19:20.200
 in the conditions of our ambient environment.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.440
 It's kind of fascinating that, like you mentioned,

19:22.440 --> 19:27.440
 errors decrease exponentially with the voltage.

19:27.500 --> 19:32.040
 So it's funny because this error thing comes up

19:32.040 --> 19:34.600
 when you start talking about quantum computing.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.020
 And it's kind of amazing that everything

19:36.020 --> 19:37.920
 we've been talking about, the errors,

19:37.920 --> 19:41.480
 as we scale down, seems to be extremely low.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.320
 Yes.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.960
 And like all of our computation is based

19:45.960 --> 19:47.760
 on the assumption that it's extremely low.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.560
 Yes, well it's digital computation.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.480
 Digital, sorry, digital computation.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.000
 So as opposed to our biological computation in our brain,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.240
 is like the assumption is stuff is gonna fail

19:58.240 --> 19:59.800
 all over the place and we somehow

19:59.800 --> 20:01.720
 have to still be robust to that.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.060
 That's exactly right.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.820
 So this also, this is gonna be the most controversial part

20:05.820 --> 20:07.800
 of our conversation where you're gonna make some enemies.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.040
 So let me ask,

20:09.040 --> 20:12.040
 because we've been talking about physics and engineering.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.760
 Which group of people is smarter

20:15.760 --> 20:17.800
 and more important for this one?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.560
 Let me ask the question in a better way.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.560
 Some of the big innovations,

20:22.560 --> 20:25.720
 some of the beautiful things that we've been talking about,

20:25.720 --> 20:26.960
 how much of it is physics?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.440
 How much of it is engineering?

20:28.440 --> 20:31.640
 My dad is a physicist and he talks down

20:31.640 --> 20:34.400
 to all the amazing engineering that we're doing

20:34.400 --> 20:37.920
 in the artificial intelligence and the computer science

20:37.920 --> 20:39.560
 and the robotics and all that space.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.640
 So we argue about this all the time.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.480
 So what do you think?

20:42.480 --> 20:43.920
 Who gets more credit?

20:43.920 --> 20:46.760
 I'm genuinely not trying to just be politically correct here.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.480
 I don't see how you would have any of the,

20:50.480 --> 20:52.600
 what we consider sort of the great accomplishments

20:52.600 --> 20:54.120
 of society without both.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.880
 You absolutely need both of those things.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.640
 Physics tends to play a key role earlier in the development

20:59.640 --> 21:04.640
 and then engineering optimization, these things take over.

21:04.640 --> 21:09.220
 And I mean, the invention of the transistor

21:09.220 --> 21:10.840
 or actually even before that,

21:10.840 --> 21:12.840
 the understanding of semiconductor physics

21:12.840 --> 21:14.800
 that allowed the invention of the transistor,

21:14.800 --> 21:15.640
 that's all physics.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.000
 So if you didn't have that physics,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.300
 you don't even get to get on the field.

21:20.300 --> 21:24.200
 But once you have understood and demonstrated

21:24.200 --> 21:26.520
 that this is in principle possible,

21:26.520 --> 21:28.400
 more so as engineering.

21:28.400 --> 21:32.200
 Why we have computers more powerful

21:32.200 --> 21:36.400
 than old supercomputers in each of our phones,

21:36.400 --> 21:37.520
 that's all engineering.

21:37.520 --> 21:41.720
 And I think I would be quite foolish to say

21:41.720 --> 21:46.720
 that that's not valuable, that's not a great contribution.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.800
 It's a beautiful dance.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.740
 Would you put like Silicon,

21:49.740 --> 21:52.760
 the understanding of the material properties

21:52.760 --> 21:54.320
 in the space of engineering?

21:54.320 --> 21:55.680
 Like how does that whole process work?

21:55.680 --> 21:58.000
 To understand that it has all these nice properties

21:58.000 --> 22:02.240
 or even the development of photolithography,

22:02.240 --> 22:03.840
 is that basically,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.140
 would you put that in a category of engineering?

22:06.140 --> 22:09.960
 No, I would say that it is basic physics,

22:09.960 --> 22:12.760
 it is applied physics, it's material science,

22:12.760 --> 22:17.640
 it's X ray crystallography, it's polymer chemistry,

22:17.640 --> 22:18.800
 it's everything.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.280
 Chemistry even is thrown in there?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.580
 Absolutely, yes, absolutely.

22:22.580 --> 22:23.840
 Just no biology.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.560
 We can get to biology.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.240
 Or the biologies and the humans

22:28.240 --> 22:29.480
 that are engineering the system,

22:29.480 --> 22:31.200
 so it's all integrated deeply.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.560
 Okay, so let's return,

22:32.560 --> 22:35.640
 you mentioned this word superconductivity.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.600
 So what does that have to do with what we're talking about?

22:38.600 --> 22:40.560
 Right, okay, so in a semiconductor,

22:40.560 --> 22:44.280
 as I tried to describe a second ago,

22:44.280 --> 22:49.280
 you can sort of induce currents by applying voltages

22:50.040 --> 22:52.280
 and those have sort of typical properties

22:52.280 --> 22:55.400
 that you would expect from some kind of a conductor.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.000
 Those electrons, they don't just flow

22:59.000 --> 23:00.360
 perfectly without dissipation.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.240
 If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice

23:03.240 --> 23:05.600
 or another electron, it's gonna slow down,

23:05.600 --> 23:06.880
 it's gonna lose its momentum.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.280
 So you have to keep applying that voltage

23:09.280 --> 23:11.440
 in order to keep the current flowing.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
 In a superconductor, something different happens.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.520
 If you get a current to start flowing,

23:16.520 --> 23:18.280
 it will continue to flow indefinitely.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.880
 There's no dissipation.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.660
 So that's crazy.

23:21.660 --> 23:22.500
 How does that happen?

23:22.500 --> 23:26.800
 Well, it happens at low temperature and this is crucial.

23:26.800 --> 23:30.200
 It has to be a quite low temperature

23:30.200 --> 23:32.840
 and what I'm talking about there,

23:32.840 --> 23:35.800
 for essentially all of our conversation,

23:35.800 --> 23:38.780
 I'm gonna be talking about conventional superconductors,

23:39.800 --> 23:42.240
 sometimes called low TC superconductors,

23:42.240 --> 23:45.120
 low critical temperature superconductors.

23:45.120 --> 23:50.120
 And so those materials have to be at a temperature around,

23:50.640 --> 23:51.960
 say around four Kelvin.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.560
 I mean, their critical temperature might be 10 Kelvin,

23:54.560 --> 23:55.400
 something like that,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.120
 but you wanna operate them at around four Kelvin,

23:57.120 --> 23:59.280
 four degrees above absolute zero.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.640
 And what happens at that temperature,

24:01.640 --> 24:03.880
 at very low temperatures in certain materials

24:03.880 --> 24:08.880
 is that the noise of atoms moving around,

24:10.080 --> 24:13.580
 the lattice vibrating, electrons colliding with each other,

24:13.580 --> 24:15.120
 that becomes sufficiently low

24:15.120 --> 24:18.600
 that the electrons can settle into this very special state.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.280
 It's sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum state

24:22.280 --> 24:26.560
 because if I had a piece of superconducting material here,

24:26.560 --> 24:30.920
 let's say niobium is a very typical superconductor.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.640
 If I had a block of niobium here

24:33.640 --> 24:36.700
 and we cooled it below its critical temperature,

24:36.700 --> 24:40.840
 all of the electrons in that superconducting state

24:40.840 --> 24:42.840
 would be in one coherent quantum state.

24:42.840 --> 24:47.520
 The wave function of that state is described

24:47.520 --> 24:49.760
 in terms of all of the particles simultaneously,

24:49.760 --> 24:52.220
 but it extends across macroscopic dimensions,

24:52.220 --> 24:56.120
 the size of whatever block of that material

24:56.120 --> 24:57.040
 I have sitting here.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.460
 And the way this occurs is that,

25:01.220 --> 25:03.480
 let's try to be a little bit light on the technical details,

25:03.480 --> 25:06.520
 but essentially the electrons coordinate with each other.

25:06.520 --> 25:10.300
 They are able to, in this macroscopic quantum state,

25:10.300 --> 25:12.260
 they're able to sort of,

25:12.260 --> 25:14.400
 one can quickly take the place of the other.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.800
 You can't tell electrons apart.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.740
 They're what's known as identical particles.

25:17.740 --> 25:22.040
 So if this electron runs into a defect

25:22.040 --> 25:25.000
 that would otherwise cause it to scatter,

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
 it can just sort of almost miraculously avoid that defect

25:30.440 --> 25:32.240
 because it's not really in that location.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.000
 It's part of a macroscopic quantum state

25:34.000 --> 25:35.660
 and the entire quantum state

25:35.660 --> 25:37.160
 was not scattered by that defect.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.780
 So you can get a current that flows without dissipation

25:40.780 --> 25:42.960
 and that's called a supercurrent.

25:42.960 --> 25:47.840
 That's sort of just very much scratching the surface

25:47.840 --> 25:49.840
 of superconductivity.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.240
 There's very deep and rich physics there,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.520
 just probably not the main subject

25:54.520 --> 25:55.640
 we need to go into right now.

25:55.640 --> 26:00.520
 But it turns out that when you have this material,

26:00.520 --> 26:03.560
 you can do usual things like make wires out of it

26:03.560 --> 26:06.440
 so you can get current to flow in a straight line on a chip,

26:06.440 --> 26:08.920
 but you can also make other devices

26:08.920 --> 26:11.880
 that perform different kinds of operations.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.760
 Some of them are kind of logic operations

26:14.760 --> 26:16.680
 like you'd get in a transistor.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.860
 The most common or the most,

26:21.200 --> 26:25.480
 I would say, diverse in its utility component

26:25.480 --> 26:26.920
 is a Josephson junction.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.980
 It's not analogous to a transistor

26:28.980 --> 26:31.480
 in the sense that if you apply a voltage here,

26:31.480 --> 26:33.880
 it changes how much current flows from left to right,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.360
 but it is analogous in sort of a sense

26:36.360 --> 26:39.200
 of it's the go to component

26:39.200 --> 26:42.040
 that a circuit engineer is going to use

26:42.040 --> 26:44.520
 to start to build up more complexity.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.840
 So these junctions serve as gates.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.680
 They can serve as gates.

26:50.680 --> 26:55.680
 So I'm not sure how concerned to be with semantics,

26:55.680 --> 26:58.880
 but let me just briefly say what a Josephson junction is

26:58.880 --> 27:02.240
 and we can talk about different ways that they can be used.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.280
 Basically, if you have a superconducting wire

27:05.280 --> 27:09.680
 and then a small gap of a different material

27:09.680 --> 27:13.520
 that's not superconducting, an insulator or normal metal,

27:13.520 --> 27:15.800
 and then another superconducting wire on the other side,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.040
 that's a Josephson junction.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.600
 So it's sometimes referred to

27:18.600 --> 27:20.320
 as a superconducting weak link.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.200
 So you have this superconducting state on one side

27:24.200 --> 27:27.520
 and on the other side, and the superconducting wave function

27:27.520 --> 27:30.720
 actually tunnels across that gap.

27:30.720 --> 27:35.460
 And when you create such a physical entity,

27:35.460 --> 27:40.460
 it has very unusual current voltage characteristics.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.320
 In that gap, like weird stuff happens.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.160
 Through the entire circuit.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.600
 So you can imagine, suppose you had a loop set up

27:47.600 --> 27:51.240
 that had one of those weak links in the loop.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.800
 Current would flow in that loop independent,

27:53.800 --> 27:55.640
 even if you hadn't applied a voltage to it,

27:55.640 --> 27:57.060
 and that's called the Josephson effect.

27:57.060 --> 28:00.520
 So the fact that there's this phase difference

28:00.520 --> 28:02.940
 in the quantum wave function from one side

28:02.940 --> 28:04.400
 of the tunneling barrier to the other

28:04.400 --> 28:05.720
 induces current to flow.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.720
 So how does you change state?

28:07.720 --> 28:08.560
 Right, exactly.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.560
 So how do you change state?

28:09.560 --> 28:13.880
 Now picture if I have a current bias coming down

28:13.880 --> 28:16.120
 this line of my circuit and there's a Josephson junction

28:16.120 --> 28:18.120
 right in the middle of it.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.960
 And now I make another wire

28:19.960 --> 28:21.800
 that goes around the Josephson junction.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.600
 So I have a loop here, a superconducting loop.

28:24.600 --> 28:28.960
 I can add current to that loop by exceeding

28:28.960 --> 28:30.860
 the critical current of that Josephson junction.

28:30.860 --> 28:33.980
 So like any superconducting material,

28:34.960 --> 28:37.700
 it can carry this supercurrent that I've described,

28:37.700 --> 28:40.520
 this current that can propagate without dissipation

28:40.520 --> 28:41.840
 up to a certain level.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.240
 And if you try and pass more current than that

28:44.240 --> 28:47.520
 through the material, it's going to become

28:47.520 --> 28:51.140
 a resistive material, normal material.

28:51.140 --> 28:54.140
 So in the Josephson junction, the same thing happens.

28:54.140 --> 28:57.120
 I can bias it above its critical current.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.220
 And then what it's going to do,

28:58.220 --> 29:03.220
 it's going to add a quantized amount of current

29:03.560 --> 29:04.400
 into that loop.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.320
 And what I mean by quantized is it's going to come

29:07.320 --> 29:11.200
 in discrete packets with a well defined value of current.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.320
 So in the vernacular of some people working

29:15.320 --> 29:19.520
 in this community, you would say you pop a flux on

29:19.520 --> 29:20.360
 into the loop.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.760
 So a flux on.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.680
 You pop a flux on into the loop.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.520
 Yeah, so a flux on.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.560
 Sounds like skateboarder talk, I love it.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.960
 Okay, sorry, go ahead.

29:28.960 --> 29:33.640
 A flux on is one of these quantized sort of amounts

29:33.640 --> 29:35.220
 of current that you can add to a loop.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.600
 And this is a cartoon picture,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.400
 but I think it's sufficient for our purposes.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.780
 So which, maybe it's useful to say,

29:41.700 --> 29:45.480
 what is the speed at which these discrete packets

29:45.480 --> 29:47.000
 of current travel?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.160
 Because we'll be talking about light a little bit.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.080
 It seems like the speed is important.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.560
 The speed is important, that's an excellent question.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.800
 Sometimes I wonder where you, how you became so astute.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.800
 But so this.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.400
 Matrix 4 is coming out, so maybe that's related.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.240
 I'm not sure.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.400
 I'm dressed for the job.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.360
 I was trying to get to become an extra on Matrix 4,

30:09.360 --> 30:10.680
 didn't work out.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.280
 Anyway, so what's the speed of these packets?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.000
 You'll have to find another gig.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.600
 I know, I'm sorry.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.440
 So the speed of the pack is actually these flux ons,

30:19.440 --> 30:24.300
 these sort of pulses of current

30:24.300 --> 30:26.200
 that are generated by Joseph's injunctions,

30:26.200 --> 30:28.480
 they can actually propagate very close

30:28.480 --> 30:29.740
 to the speed of light,

30:29.740 --> 30:31.920
 maybe something like a third of the speed of light.

30:31.920 --> 30:32.880
 That's quite fast.

30:32.880 --> 30:37.280
 So one of the reasons why Joseph's injunctions are appealing

30:37.280 --> 30:40.600
 is because their signals can propagate quite fast

30:40.600 --> 30:43.440
 and they can also switch very fast.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.080
 What I mean by switch is perform that operation

30:46.080 --> 30:49.440
 that I described where you add current to the loop.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.960
 That can happen within a few tens of picoseconds.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.880
 So you can get devices that operate

30:56.880 --> 30:58.840
 in the hundreds of gigahertz range.

30:58.840 --> 31:02.080
 And by comparison, most processors

31:02.080 --> 31:04.960
 in our conventional computers operate closer

31:04.960 --> 31:08.360
 to the one gigahertz range, maybe three gigahertz

31:08.360 --> 31:12.960
 seems to be kind of where those speeds have leveled out.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.600
 The gamers listening to this are getting really excited

31:15.600 --> 31:18.080
 to overclock their system to like, what is it?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.560
 Like four gigahertz or something,

31:19.560 --> 31:21.980
 a hundred sounds incredible.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.060
 Can I just as a tiny tangent,

31:24.060 --> 31:26.880
 is the physics of this understood well

31:26.880 --> 31:28.520
 how to do this stably?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.160
 Oh yes, the physics is understood well.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.540
 The physics of Joseph's injunctions is understood well.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.520
 The technology is understood quite well too.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.620
 The reasons why it hasn't displaced

31:37.620 --> 31:41.720
 silicon microelectronics in conventional digital computing

31:41.720 --> 31:45.040
 I think are more related to what I was alluding to before

31:45.040 --> 31:49.240
 about the myriad practical, almost mundane aspects

31:49.240 --> 31:52.080
 of silicon that make it so useful.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.880
 You can make a transistor ever smaller and smaller

31:55.880 --> 31:58.840
 and it will still perform its digital function quite well.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.780
 The same is not true of a Joseph's injunction.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.400
 You really, they don't, they just,

32:02.400 --> 32:04.440
 it's not the same thing that there's this feature

32:04.440 --> 32:06.280
 that you can keep making smaller and smaller

32:06.280 --> 32:08.220
 and it'll keep performing the same operations.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.480
 This loop I described, any Joseph's in circuit,

32:11.480 --> 32:13.600
 well, I wanna be careful, I shouldn't say

32:13.600 --> 32:17.240
 any Joseph's in circuit, but many Joseph's in circuits,

32:17.240 --> 32:19.440
 the way they process information

32:19.440 --> 32:21.280
 or the way they perform whatever function it is

32:21.280 --> 32:22.120
 they're trying to do,

32:22.120 --> 32:24.560
 maybe it's sensing a weak magnetic field,

32:24.560 --> 32:27.480
 it depends on an interplay between the junction

32:27.480 --> 32:28.800
 and that loop.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.560
 And you can't make that loop much smaller.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.120
 And it's not for practical reasons

32:32.120 --> 32:33.480
 that have to do with lithography.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.680
 It's for fundamental physical reasons

32:35.680 --> 32:38.960
 about the way the magnetic field interacts

32:38.960 --> 32:41.160
 with that superconducting material.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.360
 There are physical limits that no matter how good

32:44.360 --> 32:47.260
 our technology got, those circuits would,

32:47.260 --> 32:50.360
 I think would never be able to be scaled down

32:50.360 --> 32:54.360
 to the densities that silicon microelectronics can.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.560
 I don't know if we mentioned,

32:55.560 --> 32:56.960
 is there something interesting

32:56.960 --> 33:00.200
 about the various superconducting materials involved

33:00.200 --> 33:01.040
 or is it all?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.640
 There's a lot of stuff that's interesting.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.440
 And it's not silicon.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.840
 It's not silicon, no.

33:05.840 --> 33:09.520
 So like it's some materials that also required

33:09.520 --> 33:12.560
 to be super cold, four Kelvin and so on.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.280
 So let's dissect a couple of those different things.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.280
 The super cold part,

33:16.280 --> 33:19.640
 let me just mention for your gamers out there

33:19.640 --> 33:21.320
 that are trying to clock it at four gigahertz

33:21.320 --> 33:22.160
 and would love to go to 400.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.120
 What kind of cooling system can achieve four Kelvin?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.280
 Four Kelvin, you need liquid helium.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.040
 And so liquid helium is expensive.

33:29.040 --> 33:29.880
 It's inconvenient.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.080
 You need a cryostat that sits there

33:32.080 --> 33:36.520
 and the energy consumption of that cryostat

33:36.520 --> 33:40.080
 is impracticable for, it's not going in your cell phone.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.080
 So you can picture holding your cell phone like this

33:42.080 --> 33:46.600
 and then something the size of a keg of beer or something

33:46.600 --> 33:47.800
 on your back to cool it.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.520
 Like that makes no sense.

33:49.520 --> 33:54.120
 So if you're trying to make this in consumer devices,

33:54.120 --> 33:57.000
 electronics that are ubiquitous across society,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.280
 superconductors are not in the race for that.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.000
 For now, but you're saying,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.240
 so just to frame the conversation,

34:03.240 --> 34:05.520
 maybe the thing we're focused on

34:05.520 --> 34:10.360
 is computing systems that serve as servers, like large.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.800
 Yes, large systems.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.800
 So then you can contrast what's going on in your cell phone

34:14.800 --> 34:18.240
 with what's going on at one of the supercomputers.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.080
 Colleague Katie Schuman invited us out to Oak Ridge

34:22.080 --> 34:24.080
 a few years ago, so we got to see Titan

34:24.080 --> 34:26.120
 and that was when they were building Summit.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.240
 So these are some high performance supercomputers

34:29.240 --> 34:32.480
 out in Tennessee and those are filling entire rooms

34:32.480 --> 34:33.920
 the size of warehouses.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.280
 So once you're at that level, okay,

34:36.280 --> 34:39.080
 there you're already putting a lot of power into cooling.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.240
 Cooling is part of your engineering task

34:42.240 --> 34:43.600
 that you have to deal with.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
 So there it's not entirely obvious

34:45.600 --> 34:49.520
 that cooling to four Kelvin is out of the question.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.240
 It has not happened yet and I can speak to why that is

34:53.240 --> 34:55.520
 in the digital domain if you're interested.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
 I think it's not going to happen.

34:57.520 --> 35:01.240
 I don't think superconductors are gonna replace

35:01.240 --> 35:04.680
 semiconductors for digital computation.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.640
 There are a lot of reasons for that,

35:07.640 --> 35:09.800
 but I think ultimately what it comes down to

35:09.800 --> 35:13.440
 is all things considered cooling errors,

35:13.440 --> 35:16.080
 scaling down to feature sizes, all that stuff,

35:16.080 --> 35:19.400
 semiconductors work better at the system level.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.720
 Is there some aspect of just curious

35:22.720 --> 35:25.560
 about the historical momentum of this?

35:25.560 --> 35:28.200
 Is there some power to the momentum of an industry

35:28.200 --> 35:31.200
 that's mass manufacturing using a certain material?

35:31.200 --> 35:33.680
 Is this like a Titanic shifting?

35:33.680 --> 35:37.120
 Like what's your sense when a good idea comes along,

35:37.120 --> 35:39.920
 how good does that idea need to be

35:39.920 --> 35:42.640
 for the Titanic to start shifting?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.200
 That's an excellent question.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.520
 That's an excellent way to frame it.

35:46.520 --> 35:51.320
 And you know, I don't know the answer to that,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.600
 but what I think is, okay,

35:53.600 --> 35:56.400
 so the history of the superconducting logic

35:56.400 --> 35:58.000
 goes back to the 70s.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.760
 IBM made a big push to do

35:59.760 --> 36:02.400
 superconducting digital computing in the 70s.

36:02.400 --> 36:06.080
 And they made some choices about their devices

36:06.080 --> 36:09.440
 and their architectures and things that in hindsight,

36:09.440 --> 36:11.000
 were kind of doomed to fail.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.120
 And I don't mean any disrespect for the people that did it,

36:13.120 --> 36:14.280
 it was hard to see at the time.

36:14.280 --> 36:17.880
 But then another generation of superconducting logic

36:17.880 --> 36:22.320
 was introduced, I wanna say the 90s,

36:22.320 --> 36:25.000
 someone named Lykarev and Seminov,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.280
 they proposed an entire family of circuits

36:28.280 --> 36:29.920
 based on Joseph's injunctions

36:29.920 --> 36:33.440
 that are doing digital computing based on logic gates

36:33.440 --> 36:36.600
 and or not these kinds of things.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.560
 And they showed how it could go hundreds of times faster

36:41.560 --> 36:43.200
 than silicon microelectronics.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.360
 And it's extremely exciting.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.040
 I wasn't working in the field at that time,

36:47.040 --> 36:49.560
 but later when I went back and read the literature,

36:49.560 --> 36:52.040
 I was just like, wow, this is so awesome.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.000
 And so you might think, well,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.280
 the reason why it didn't display silicon

36:58.280 --> 37:00.400
 is because silicon already had so much momentum

37:00.400 --> 37:01.720
 at that time.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.960
 But that was the 90s.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.320
 Silicon kept that momentum

37:04.320 --> 37:06.960
 because it had the simple way to keep getting better.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.720
 You just make features smaller and smaller.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.800
 So it would have to be,

37:11.800 --> 37:13.560
 I don't think it would have to be that much better

37:13.560 --> 37:15.440
 than silicon to displace it.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.800
 But the problem is it's just not better than silicon.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.960
 It might be better than silicon in one metric,

37:19.960 --> 37:21.440
 speed of a switching operation

37:21.440 --> 37:24.400
 or power consumption of a switching operation.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.680
 But building a digital computer is a lot more

37:26.680 --> 37:28.720
 than just that elemental operation.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.040
 It's everything that goes into it,

37:31.040 --> 37:33.320
 including the manufacturing, including the packaging,

37:33.320 --> 37:38.320
 including the various materials aspects of things.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.600
 So the reason why,

37:40.600 --> 37:42.800
 and even in some of those early papers,

37:42.800 --> 37:44.120
 I can't remember which one it was,

37:44.120 --> 37:47.480
 Lykarev said something along the lines of,

37:47.480 --> 37:49.920
 you can see how we could build an entire family

37:49.920 --> 37:52.800
 of digital electronic circuits based on these components.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.000
 They could go a hundred or more times faster

37:55.000 --> 37:59.320
 than semiconductor logic gates.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.920
 But I don't think that's the right way

38:00.920 --> 38:02.680
 to use superconducting electronic circuits.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.320
 He didn't say what the right way was,

38:04.320 --> 38:07.480
 but he basically said digital logic,

38:07.480 --> 38:11.280
 trying to steal the show from silicon

38:11.280 --> 38:13.440
 is probably not what these circuits

38:13.440 --> 38:16.360
 are most suited to accomplish.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.840
 So if we can just linger and use the word computation.

38:20.840 --> 38:24.080
 When you talk about computation, how do you think about it?

38:24.080 --> 38:28.920
 Do you think purely on just the switching,

38:28.920 --> 38:31.320
 or do you think something a little bit larger scale,

38:31.320 --> 38:32.720
 a circuit taken together,

38:32.720 --> 38:36.940
 performing the basic arithmetic operations

38:36.940 --> 38:40.400
 that are then required to do the kind of computation

38:40.400 --> 38:42.160
 that makes up a computer?

38:42.160 --> 38:44.400
 Because when we talk about the speed of computation,

38:44.400 --> 38:46.960
 is it boiled down to the basic switching,

38:46.960 --> 38:48.400
 or is there some bigger picture

38:48.400 --> 38:49.240
 that you're thinking about?

38:49.240 --> 38:52.240
 Well, all right, so maybe we should disambiguate.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.600
 There are a variety of different kinds of computation.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.200
 I don't pretend to be an expert

38:57.200 --> 39:00.180
 in the theory of computation or anything like that.

39:00.180 --> 39:02.640
 I guess it's important to differentiate though

39:02.640 --> 39:05.800
 between digital logic,

39:05.800 --> 39:09.800
 which represents information as a series of bits,

39:09.800 --> 39:13.000
 binary digits, which you can think of them

39:13.000 --> 39:14.160
 as zeros and ones or whatever.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.400
 Usually they correspond to a physical system

39:17.400 --> 39:21.240
 that has two very well separated states.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.860
 And then other kinds of computation,

39:22.860 --> 39:25.280
 like we'll get into more the way your brain works,

39:25.280 --> 39:27.600
 which it is, I think,

39:27.600 --> 39:30.400
 indisputably processing information,

39:30.400 --> 39:34.080
 but where the computation begins and ends

39:34.080 --> 39:36.360
 is not anywhere near as well defined.

39:36.360 --> 39:39.680
 It doesn't depend on these two levels.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.320
 Here's a zero, here's a one.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.640
 There's a lot of gray area

39:42.640 --> 39:45.640
 that's usually referred to as analog computing.

39:45.640 --> 39:49.860
 Also in conventional digital computers

39:49.860 --> 39:54.240
 or digital computers in general,

39:54.240 --> 39:57.300
 you have a concept of what's called arithmetic depth,

39:57.300 --> 39:59.820
 which is jargon that basically means

39:59.820 --> 40:03.860
 how many sequential operations are performed

40:03.860 --> 40:07.680
 to turn an input into an output.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.900
 And those kinds of computations in digital systems

40:10.900 --> 40:14.500
 are highly serial, meaning that data streams,

40:14.500 --> 40:16.500
 they don't branch off too far to the side.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.900
 You do, you have to pull some information over there

40:18.900 --> 40:20.900
 and access memory from here and stuff like that.

40:20.900 --> 40:24.340
 But by and large, the computation proceeds

40:24.340 --> 40:26.220
 in a serial manner.

40:26.220 --> 40:27.740
 It's not that way in the brain.

40:27.740 --> 40:30.740
 In the brain, you're always drawing information

40:30.740 --> 40:31.580
 from different places.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.820
 It's much more network based computing.

40:33.820 --> 40:35.680
 Neurons don't wait for their turn.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.180
 They fire when they're ready to fire.

40:37.180 --> 40:39.220
 And so it's asynchronous.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.680
 So one of the other things about a digital system

40:41.680 --> 40:44.500
 is you're performing these operations on a clock.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.700
 And that's a crucial aspect of it.

40:46.700 --> 40:48.900
 Get rid of a clock in a digital system,

40:48.900 --> 40:50.460
 nothing makes sense anymore.

40:50.460 --> 40:51.580
 The brain has no clock.

40:51.580 --> 40:55.340
 It builds its own timescales based on its internal activity.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.500
 So you can think of the brain as kind of like this,

40:59.500 --> 41:00.940
 like network computation,

41:00.940 --> 41:04.600
 where it's actually really trivial, simple computers,

41:05.700 --> 41:08.980
 just a huge number of them and they're networked.

41:08.980 --> 41:12.940
 I would say it is complex, sophisticated little processors

41:12.940 --> 41:14.420
 and there's a huge number of them.

41:14.420 --> 41:16.180
 Neurons are not, are not simple.

41:16.180 --> 41:17.620
 I don't mean to offend neurons.

41:17.620 --> 41:19.780
 They're very complicated and beautiful and yeah,

41:19.780 --> 41:21.980
 but we often oversimplify them.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.820
 Yes, they're actually like there's computation happening

41:24.820 --> 41:25.660
 within a neuron.

41:25.660 --> 41:29.520
 Right, so I would say to think of a transistor

41:29.520 --> 41:32.340
 as the building block of a digital computer is accurate.

41:32.340 --> 41:34.660
 You use a few transistors to make your logic gates.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.060
 You build up more, you build up processors

41:37.060 --> 41:39.140
 from logic gates and things like that.

41:39.140 --> 41:40.600
 So you can think of a transistor

41:40.600 --> 41:42.300
 as a fundamental building block,

41:42.300 --> 41:43.380
 or you can think of,

41:43.380 --> 41:46.360
 as we get into more highly parallelized architectures,

41:46.360 --> 41:47.700
 you can think of a processor

41:47.700 --> 41:49.300
 as a fundamental building block.

41:49.300 --> 41:53.180
 To make the analogy to the neuro side of things,

41:53.180 --> 41:55.320
 a neuron is not a transistor.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.300
 A neuron is a processor.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.220
 It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors,

42:00.220 --> 42:01.340
 but they are more,

42:02.180 --> 42:04.820
 they're lower on the information processing hierarchy

42:04.820 --> 42:05.660
 in a sense.

42:05.660 --> 42:08.180
 They do a bulk of the computation,

42:08.180 --> 42:13.180
 but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves

42:13.580 --> 42:16.300
 that can take in many different kinds of inputs

42:16.300 --> 42:18.780
 on many different spatial and temporal scales

42:18.780 --> 42:20.820
 and produce many different kinds of outputs

42:20.820 --> 42:23.820
 so that they can perform different computations

42:23.820 --> 42:24.860
 in different contexts.

42:24.860 --> 42:27.440
 So this is where enters this distinction

42:27.440 --> 42:30.740
 between computation and communication.

42:30.740 --> 42:34.140
 So you can think of neurons performing computation

42:34.140 --> 42:36.580
 and the inter, the networking,

42:36.580 --> 42:39.000
 the interconnectivity of neurons

42:39.000 --> 42:40.940
 is communication between neurons.

42:40.940 --> 42:43.500
 And you see this with very large server systems.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.020
 I've been, I mentioned offline,

42:45.020 --> 42:46.180
 we've been talking to Jim Keller,

42:46.180 --> 42:48.140
 whose dream is to build giant computers

42:48.140 --> 42:51.220
 that, you know, the bottom like there

42:51.220 --> 42:52.380
 is often the communication

42:52.380 --> 42:54.700
 between the different pieces of computing.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.380
 So in this paper that we mentioned,

42:57.380 --> 42:59.660
 Optoelectronic Intelligence,

42:59.660 --> 43:03.220
 you say electrons excel at computation

43:03.220 --> 43:08.220
 while light is excellent for communication.

43:08.380 --> 43:11.060
 Maybe you can linger and say in this context,

43:11.060 --> 43:13.980
 what do you mean by computation and communication?

43:13.980 --> 43:17.420
 What are electrons, what is light

43:17.420 --> 43:20.660
 and why do they excel at those two tasks?

43:20.660 --> 43:23.620
 Yeah, just to first speak to computation

43:23.620 --> 43:25.620
 versus communication,

43:25.620 --> 43:30.340
 I would say computation is essentially taking in

43:30.340 --> 43:33.860
 some information, performing operations

43:33.860 --> 43:37.220
 on that information and producing new,

43:37.220 --> 43:39.060
 hopefully more useful information.

43:39.060 --> 43:44.060
 So for example, imagine you have a picture in front of you

43:45.020 --> 43:48.020
 and there is a key in it

43:48.020 --> 43:48.940
 and that's what you're looking for,

43:48.940 --> 43:50.700
 for whatever reason, you wanna find the key,

43:50.700 --> 43:51.580
 we all wanna find the key.

43:51.580 --> 43:56.540
 So the input is that entire picture

43:56.540 --> 43:59.060
 and the output might be the coordinates where the key is.

43:59.060 --> 44:01.540
 So you've reduced the total amount of information you have

44:01.540 --> 44:03.020
 but you found the useful information

44:03.020 --> 44:04.380
 for you in that present moment,

44:04.380 --> 44:05.220
 that's the useful information.

44:05.220 --> 44:07.180
 And you think about this computation

44:07.180 --> 44:10.820
 as the controlled synchronous sequential?

44:10.820 --> 44:12.700
 Not necessarily, it could be,

44:12.700 --> 44:16.220
 that could be how your system is performing the computation

44:16.220 --> 44:19.300
 or it could be asynchronous,

44:19.300 --> 44:21.420
 there are lots of ways to find the key.

44:21.420 --> 44:23.700
 It depends on the nature of the data,

44:23.700 --> 44:27.540
 it depends on, that's a very simplified example,

44:27.540 --> 44:28.700
 a picture with a key in it,

44:28.700 --> 44:30.540
 what about if you're in the world

44:30.540 --> 44:32.500
 and you're trying to decide the best way

44:32.500 --> 44:34.900
 to live your life?

44:35.940 --> 44:37.020
 It might be interactive,

44:37.020 --> 44:38.580
 it might be there might be some recurrence

44:38.580 --> 44:41.340
 or some weird asynchrony, I got it.

44:41.340 --> 44:43.260
 But there's an input and there's an output

44:43.260 --> 44:44.460
 and you do some stuff in the middle

44:44.460 --> 44:46.020
 that actually goes from the input to the output.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.340
 You've taken in information

44:47.340 --> 44:49.100
 and output different information,

44:49.100 --> 44:51.820
 hopefully reducing the total amount of information

44:51.820 --> 44:53.820
 and extracting what's useful.

44:53.820 --> 44:57.780
 Communication is then getting that information

44:57.780 --> 44:59.460
 from the location at which it's stored

44:59.460 --> 45:02.660
 because information is physical as Landauer emphasized

45:02.660 --> 45:04.940
 and so it is in one place

45:04.940 --> 45:07.860
 and you need to get that information to another place

45:07.860 --> 45:10.100
 so that something else can use it

45:10.100 --> 45:12.020
 for whatever computation it's working on.

45:12.020 --> 45:13.460
 Maybe it's part of the same network

45:13.460 --> 45:15.020
 and you're all trying to solve the same problem

45:15.020 --> 45:20.020
 but neuron A over here just deduced something

45:20.500 --> 45:21.620
 based on its inputs

45:21.620 --> 45:25.180
 and it's now sending that information across the network

45:25.180 --> 45:26.460
 to another location

45:26.460 --> 45:28.420
 so that would be the act of communication.

45:28.420 --> 45:29.900
 Can you linger on Landauer

45:29.900 --> 45:31.820
 and saying information is physical?

45:31.820 --> 45:35.340
 Rolf Landauer, not to be confused with Lev Landauer.

45:35.340 --> 45:38.020
 Yeah, and he made huge contributions

45:38.020 --> 45:42.980
 to our understanding of the reversibility of information

45:42.980 --> 45:46.700
 and this concept that energy has to be dissipated

45:46.700 --> 45:50.100
 in computing when the computation is irreversible

45:50.100 --> 45:52.140
 but if you can manage to make it reversible

45:52.140 --> 45:55.060
 then you don't need to expend energy

45:55.060 --> 45:59.660
 but if you do expend energy to perform a computation

45:59.660 --> 46:02.300
 there's sort of a minimal amount that you have to do

46:02.300 --> 46:04.460
 and it's KT log two.

46:04.460 --> 46:05.900
 And it's all somehow related

46:05.900 --> 46:07.660
 to the second law of thermodynamics

46:07.660 --> 46:09.620
 and that the universe is an information process

46:09.620 --> 46:11.500
 and then we're living in a simulation.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.980
 So okay, sorry, sorry for that tangent.

46:13.980 --> 46:17.140
 So that's the defining the distinction

46:17.140 --> 46:19.580
 between computation and communication.

46:19.580 --> 46:21.940
 Let me say one more thing just to clarify.

46:21.940 --> 46:26.940
 Communication ideally does not change the information.

46:27.100 --> 46:28.900
 It moves it from one place to another

46:28.900 --> 46:30.940
 but it is preserved.

46:30.940 --> 46:32.500
 Got it, okay.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.700
 All right, that's beautiful.

46:33.700 --> 46:38.620
 So then the electron versus light distinction

46:38.620 --> 46:42.380
 and why are electrons good at computation

46:42.380 --> 46:44.540
 and light good at communication?

46:44.540 --> 46:48.820
 Yes, there's a lot that goes into it I guess

46:48.820 --> 46:52.100
 but just try to speak to the simplest part of it.

46:54.100 --> 46:56.980
 Electrons interact strongly with one another.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.340
 They're charged particles.

46:58.340 --> 47:02.020
 So if I pile a bunch of them over here

47:02.020 --> 47:03.860
 they're feeling a certain amount of force

47:03.860 --> 47:05.700
 and they wanna move somewhere else.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.900
 They're strongly interactive.

47:06.900 --> 47:08.900
 You can also get them to sit still.

47:08.900 --> 47:10.660
 You can, an electron has a mass

47:10.660 --> 47:15.660
 so you can cause it to be spatially localized.

47:15.860 --> 47:18.100
 So for computation that's useful

47:18.100 --> 47:20.140
 because now I can make these little devices

47:20.140 --> 47:21.940
 that put a bunch of electrons over here

47:21.940 --> 47:25.620
 and then I change the state of a gate

47:25.620 --> 47:26.500
 like I've been describing,

47:26.500 --> 47:28.380
 put a different voltage on this gate

47:28.380 --> 47:29.980
 and now I move the electrons over here.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.220
 Now they're sitting somewhere else.

47:31.220 --> 47:33.980
 I have a physical mechanism

47:33.980 --> 47:36.020
 with which I can represent information.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.140
 It's spatially localized and I have knobs

47:38.140 --> 47:41.220
 that I can adjust to change where those electrons are

47:41.220 --> 47:42.380
 or what they're doing.

47:42.380 --> 47:45.220
 Light by contrast, photons of light

47:45.220 --> 47:48.100
 which are the discrete packets of energy

47:48.100 --> 47:50.740
 that were identified by Einstein,

47:50.740 --> 47:53.420
 they do not interact with each other

47:54.540 --> 47:56.260
 especially at low light levels.

47:56.260 --> 48:00.380
 If you're in a medium and you have a bright high light level

48:00.380 --> 48:02.540
 you can get them to interact with each other

48:02.540 --> 48:05.340
 through the interaction with that medium that they're in

48:05.340 --> 48:07.780
 but that's a little bit more exotic.

48:07.780 --> 48:10.340
 And for the purposes of this conversation

48:10.340 --> 48:13.180
 we can assume that photons don't interact with each other.

48:13.180 --> 48:16.100
 So if you have a bunch of them

48:16.100 --> 48:17.580
 all propagating in the same direction

48:17.580 --> 48:19.140
 they don't interfere with each other.

48:19.140 --> 48:22.900
 If I wanna send, if I have a communication channel

48:22.900 --> 48:24.460
 and I put one more photon on it,

48:24.460 --> 48:26.020
 it doesn't screw up with those other ones.

48:26.020 --> 48:29.060
 It doesn't change what those other ones were doing at all.

48:29.060 --> 48:31.260
 So that's really useful for communication

48:31.260 --> 48:33.660
 because that means you can sort of allow

48:33.660 --> 48:35.580
 a lot of these photons to flow

48:37.060 --> 48:38.820
 without disruption of each other

48:38.820 --> 48:41.060
 and they can branch really easily and things like that.

48:41.060 --> 48:42.700
 But it's not good for computation

48:42.700 --> 48:46.340
 because it's very hard for this packet of light

48:46.340 --> 48:48.700
 to change what this packet of light is doing.

48:48.700 --> 48:50.180
 They pass right through each other.

48:50.180 --> 48:53.260
 So in computation you want to change information

48:53.260 --> 48:55.700
 and if photons don't interact with each other

48:55.700 --> 48:58.020
 it's difficult to get them to change the information

48:58.020 --> 48:59.380
 represented by the others.

48:59.380 --> 49:01.580
 So that's the fundamental difference.

49:01.580 --> 49:04.780
 Is there also something about the way they travel

49:04.780 --> 49:06.420
 through different materials

49:07.460 --> 49:10.700
 or is that just a particular engineering?

49:10.700 --> 49:12.580
 No, it's not, that's deep physics I think.

49:12.580 --> 49:17.060
 So this gets back to electrons interact with each other

49:17.060 --> 49:18.140
 and photons don't.

49:18.140 --> 49:22.380
 So say I'm trying to get a packet of information

49:22.380 --> 49:25.820
 from me to you and we have a wire going between us.

49:25.820 --> 49:29.020
 In order for me to send electrons across that wire

49:29.020 --> 49:32.180
 I first have to raise the voltage on my end of the wire

49:32.180 --> 49:34.580
 and that means putting a bunch of charges on it

49:34.580 --> 49:39.140
 and then that charge packet has to propagate along the wire

49:39.140 --> 49:41.260
 and it has to get all the way over to you.

49:41.260 --> 49:44.380
 That wire is gonna have something that's called capacitance

49:44.380 --> 49:46.940
 which basically tells you how much charge

49:46.940 --> 49:48.060
 you need to put on the wire

49:48.060 --> 49:49.980
 in order to raise the voltage on it

49:49.980 --> 49:52.500
 and the capacitance is gonna be proportional

49:52.500 --> 49:54.060
 to the length of the wire.

49:54.060 --> 49:56.900
 So the longer the length of the wire is

49:56.900 --> 49:59.140
 the more charge I have to put on it

49:59.140 --> 50:03.060
 and the energy required to charge up that line

50:03.060 --> 50:04.980
 and move those electrons to you

50:04.980 --> 50:06.860
 is also proportional to the capacitance

50:06.860 --> 50:08.500
 and goes as the voltage squared.

50:08.500 --> 50:13.500
 So you get this huge penalty if you wanna send electrons

50:13.780 --> 50:16.620
 across a wire over appreciable distances.

50:16.620 --> 50:19.140
 So distance is an important thing here

50:19.140 --> 50:20.780
 when you're doing communication.

50:20.780 --> 50:22.140
 Distance is an important thing.

50:22.140 --> 50:25.340
 So is the number of connections I'm trying to make.

50:25.340 --> 50:27.620
 Me to you, okay one, that's not so bad.

50:27.620 --> 50:31.420
 If I want to now send it to 10,000 other friends

50:31.420 --> 50:34.380
 then all of those wires are adding tons

50:34.380 --> 50:35.460
 of extra capacitance.

50:35.460 --> 50:37.660
 Now not only does it take forever

50:37.660 --> 50:39.540
 to put the charge on that wire

50:39.540 --> 50:41.820
 and raise the voltage on all those lines

50:41.820 --> 50:43.540
 but it takes a ton of power

50:43.540 --> 50:46.980
 and the number 10,000 is not randomly chosen.

50:46.980 --> 50:49.100
 That's roughly how many connections

50:49.100 --> 50:50.620
 each neuron in your brain makes.

50:50.620 --> 50:55.020
 So a neuron in your brain needs to send 10,000 messages

50:55.020 --> 50:56.780
 every time it has something to say.

50:56.780 --> 51:00.100
 You can't do that if you're trying to drive electrons

51:00.100 --> 51:02.060
 from here to 10,000 different places.

51:02.060 --> 51:03.660
 The brain does it in a slightly different way

51:03.660 --> 51:04.860
 which we can discuss.

51:04.860 --> 51:07.020
 How can light achieve the 10,000 connections

51:07.020 --> 51:09.340
 and why is it better?

51:09.340 --> 51:12.580
 In terms of like the energy use required

51:12.580 --> 51:15.260
 to use light for the communication of the 10,000 connections.

51:15.260 --> 51:16.100
 Right, right.

51:16.100 --> 51:17.700
 So now instead of trying to send electrons

51:17.700 --> 51:19.380
 from me to you, I'm trying to send photons.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.540
 So I can make what's called a wave guide

51:21.540 --> 51:25.140
 which is just a simple piece of a material.

51:25.140 --> 51:27.060
 It could be glass like an optical fiber

51:27.060 --> 51:29.860
 or silicon on a chip.

51:29.860 --> 51:34.140
 And I just have to inject photons into that wave guide

51:34.140 --> 51:35.800
 and independent of how long it is,

51:35.800 --> 51:39.620
 independent of how many different connections I'm making,

51:39.620 --> 51:43.140
 it doesn't change the voltage or anything like that

51:43.140 --> 51:45.460
 that I have to raise up on the wire.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.940
 So if I have one more connection,

51:47.940 --> 51:49.820
 if I add additional connections,

51:49.820 --> 51:51.760
 I need to add more light to the wave guide

51:51.760 --> 51:53.280
 because those photons need to split

51:53.280 --> 51:55.040
 and go to different paths.

51:55.040 --> 51:58.860
 That makes sense but I don't have a capacitive penalty.

51:58.860 --> 52:01.300
 Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics.

52:01.300 --> 52:03.460
 There are no parasitics associated with light

52:03.460 --> 52:04.420
 in that same sense.

52:04.420 --> 52:07.500
 So this might be a dumb question

52:07.500 --> 52:11.380
 but how do I catch a photon on the other end?

52:11.380 --> 52:12.500
 Is it material?

52:12.500 --> 52:15.020
 Is it the polymer stuff you were talking about

52:15.020 --> 52:19.380
 for a different application for photolithography?

52:19.380 --> 52:20.980
 Like how do you catch a photon?

52:20.980 --> 52:22.500
 There's a lot of ways to catch a photon.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.620
 It's not a dumb question.

52:23.620 --> 52:25.940
 It's a deep and important question

52:25.940 --> 52:29.180
 that basically defines a lot of the work

52:29.180 --> 52:31.380
 that goes on in our group at NIST.

52:31.380 --> 52:34.260
 One of my group leaders, Seywoon Nam,

52:34.260 --> 52:35.780
 has built his career around

52:35.780 --> 52:38.420
 these superconducting single photon detectors.

52:38.420 --> 52:42.460
 So if you're going to try to sort of reach a lower limit

52:42.460 --> 52:45.260
 and detect just one particle of light,

52:45.260 --> 52:47.660
 superconductors come back into our conversation

52:47.660 --> 52:50.140
 and just picture a simple device

52:50.140 --> 52:51.600
 where you have current flowing

52:51.600 --> 52:54.580
 through a superconducting wire and...

52:54.580 --> 52:56.560
 A loop again or no?

52:56.560 --> 52:57.820
 Let's say yes, you have a loop.

52:57.820 --> 52:59.580
 So you have a superconducting wire

52:59.580 --> 53:01.000
 that goes straight down like this

53:01.000 --> 53:04.260
 and on your loop branch, you have a little ammeter,

53:04.260 --> 53:05.800
 something that measures current.

53:05.800 --> 53:07.980
 There's a resistor up there too.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.020
 Go with me here.

53:09.020 --> 53:12.020
 So your current biasing this,

53:12.020 --> 53:13.060
 so there's current flowing

53:13.060 --> 53:14.400
 through that superconducting branch.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.560
 Since there's a resistor over here,

53:16.560 --> 53:18.940
 all the current goes through the superconducting branch.

53:18.940 --> 53:22.280
 Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.300
 We talked about this superconducting

53:24.300 --> 53:25.760
 macroscopic quantum state.

53:25.760 --> 53:28.480
 That's going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon.

53:28.480 --> 53:32.080
 So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.780
 And you've properly designed your circuit

53:33.780 --> 53:36.700
 so that the resistance on that superconducting branch

53:36.700 --> 53:38.420
 is much greater than the other resistance.

53:38.420 --> 53:40.780
 Now all of your current's going to go that way.

53:40.780 --> 53:43.260
 Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current.

53:43.260 --> 53:45.140
 That must mean I detected a photon.

53:45.140 --> 53:47.220
 Then where you broke that superconductivity

53:47.220 --> 53:49.100
 in a matter of a few nanoseconds,

53:49.100 --> 53:51.100
 it cools back off, dissipates that energy

53:51.100 --> 53:52.820
 and the current flows back

53:52.820 --> 53:54.300
 through that superconducting branch.

53:54.300 --> 53:59.260
 This is a very powerful superconducting device

53:59.260 --> 54:02.300
 that allows us to understand quantum states of light.

54:02.300 --> 54:04.880
 I didn't realize a loop like that

54:04.880 --> 54:07.160
 could be sensitive to a single photon.

54:07.160 --> 54:12.000
 I mean, that seems strange to me because,

54:13.060 --> 54:15.700
 I mean, so what happens when you just barrage it

54:15.700 --> 54:16.620
 with photons?

54:16.620 --> 54:18.340
 If you put a bunch of photons in there,

54:18.340 --> 54:19.860
 essentially the same thing happens.

54:19.860 --> 54:21.660
 You just drive it into the normal state,

54:21.660 --> 54:25.420
 it becomes resistive and it's not particularly interesting.

54:25.420 --> 54:27.980
 So you have to be careful how many photons you send.

54:27.980 --> 54:30.100
 Like you have to be very precise with your communication.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.220
 Well, it depends.

54:31.220 --> 54:34.220
 So I would say that that's actually in the application

54:34.220 --> 54:37.060
 that we're trying to use these detectors for.

54:37.060 --> 54:39.900
 That's a feature because what we want is for,

54:41.140 --> 54:46.140
 if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection

54:46.660 --> 54:49.860
 and one of these superconducting detectors is sitting there,

54:49.860 --> 54:51.200
 you get this pulse of current.

54:51.200 --> 54:54.000
 And that synapse says event,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.020
 then I'm gonna do what I do when there's a synapse event,

54:56.020 --> 54:58.660
 I'm gonna perform computations, that kind of thing.

54:58.660 --> 55:02.100
 But if accidentally you send two there or three or five,

55:02.100 --> 55:03.380
 it does the exact same.

55:03.380 --> 55:04.200
 Got it.

55:04.200 --> 55:09.200
 And so this is how in the system that we're devising here,

55:10.040 --> 55:12.740
 communication is entirely binary.

55:12.740 --> 55:15.020
 And that's what I tried to emphasize a second ago.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.780
 Communication should not change the information.

55:17.780 --> 55:21.300
 You're not saying, oh, I got this kind of communication

55:21.300 --> 55:22.280
 event for photons.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.700
 No, we're not keeping track of that.

55:23.700 --> 55:26.580
 This neuron fired, this synapse says that neuron fired,

55:26.580 --> 55:27.420
 that's it.

55:27.420 --> 55:31.460
 So that's a noise filtering property of those detectors.

55:31.460 --> 55:33.140
 However, there are other applications

55:33.140 --> 55:36.140
 where you'd rather know the exact number of photons

55:36.140 --> 55:39.300
 that can be very useful in quantum computing with light.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.820
 And our group does a lot of work

55:41.820 --> 55:44.580
 around another kind of superconducting sensor

55:44.580 --> 55:48.260
 called a transition edge sensor that Adrian Alita

55:48.260 --> 55:49.940
 in our group does a lot of work on that.

55:49.940 --> 55:53.980
 And that can tell you based on the amplitude

55:53.980 --> 55:58.180
 of the current pulse you divert exactly how many photons

55:58.180 --> 55:59.780
 were in that pulse.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.500
 What's that useful for?

56:02.500 --> 56:04.700
 One way that you can encode information

56:04.700 --> 56:07.460
 in quantum states of light is in the number of photons.

56:07.460 --> 56:09.300
 You can have what are called number states

56:09.300 --> 56:11.980
 and a number state will have a well defined number

56:11.980 --> 56:16.400
 of photons and maybe the output of your quantum computation

56:16.400 --> 56:19.780
 encodes its information in the number of photons

56:19.780 --> 56:20.620
 that are generated.

56:20.620 --> 56:23.020
 So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that,

56:23.020 --> 56:24.300
 it's extremely useful.

56:24.300 --> 56:29.240
 Can you achieve like a clock with photons

56:29.240 --> 56:30.260
 or is that not important?

56:30.260 --> 56:33.300
 Is there a synchronicity here?

56:33.300 --> 56:35.380
 In general, it can be important.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.380
 Clock distribution is a big challenge

56:39.380 --> 56:43.300
 in especially large computational systems.

56:43.300 --> 56:47.940
 And so yes, optical clocks, optical clock distribution

56:47.940 --> 56:51.140
 is a very powerful technology.

56:51.140 --> 56:53.180
 I don't know the state of that field right now,

56:53.180 --> 56:55.620
 but I imagine that if you're trying to distribute a clock

56:55.620 --> 56:58.960
 across any appreciable size computational system,

56:58.960 --> 57:00.340
 you wanna use light.

57:00.340 --> 57:04.300
 Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work,

57:04.300 --> 57:07.380
 especially like supercomputers.

57:07.380 --> 57:09.380
 Do they need to do clock distribution

57:09.380 --> 57:14.260
 or are they doing more ad hoc parallel

57:14.260 --> 57:15.540
 like concurrent programming?

57:15.540 --> 57:18.140
 Like there's some kind of locking mechanisms or something.

57:18.140 --> 57:19.320
 That's a fascinating question,

57:19.320 --> 57:23.900
 but let's zoom in at this very particular question

57:23.900 --> 57:28.200
 of computation on a processor

57:28.200 --> 57:31.560
 and communication between processors.

57:31.560 --> 57:36.440
 So what does this system look like

57:36.440 --> 57:38.220
 that you're envisioning?

57:38.220 --> 57:40.100
 One of the places you're envisioning it

57:40.100 --> 57:43.140
 is in the paper on optoelectronic intelligence.

57:43.140 --> 57:44.740
 So what are we talking about?

57:44.740 --> 57:46.300
 Are we talking about something

57:46.300 --> 57:48.740
 that starts to look a lot like the human brain

57:48.740 --> 57:51.300
 or does it still look a lot like a computer?

57:51.300 --> 57:52.980
 What are the size of this thing?

57:52.980 --> 57:55.140
 Is it going inside a smartphone or as you said,

57:55.140 --> 57:58.580
 does it go inside something that's more like a house?

57:58.580 --> 58:01.180
 Like what should we be imagining?

58:01.180 --> 58:02.260
 What are you thinking about

58:02.260 --> 58:05.460
 when you're thinking about these fundamental systems?

58:05.460 --> 58:07.380
 Let me introduce the word neuromorphic.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.960
 There's this concept of neuromorphic computing

58:09.960 --> 58:12.580
 where what that broadly refers to

58:12.580 --> 58:17.580
 is computing based on the information processing principles

58:17.740 --> 58:19.260
 of the brain.

58:19.260 --> 58:23.820
 And as digital computing seems to be pushing

58:23.820 --> 58:26.480
 towards some fundamental performance limits,

58:26.480 --> 58:29.180
 people are considering architectural advances,

58:29.180 --> 58:30.860
 drawing inspiration from the brain,

58:30.860 --> 58:33.660
 more distributed parallel network kind of architectures

58:33.660 --> 58:34.500
 and stuff.

58:34.500 --> 58:37.420
 And so there's this continuum of neuromorphic

58:37.420 --> 58:42.420
 from things that are pretty similar to digital computers,

58:42.740 --> 58:45.720
 but maybe there are more cores

58:45.720 --> 58:49.180
 and the way they send messages is a little bit more

58:49.180 --> 58:52.780
 like the way brain neurons send spikes.

58:52.780 --> 58:56.100
 But for the most part, it's still digital electronics.

58:56.100 --> 58:58.700
 And then you have some things in between

58:58.700 --> 59:02.060
 where maybe you're using transistors,

59:02.060 --> 59:03.220
 but now you're starting to use them

59:03.220 --> 59:06.140
 instead of in a digital way, in an analog way.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.180
 And so you're trying to get those circuits

59:08.180 --> 59:10.320
 to behave more like neurons.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.140
 And then that's a little bit,

59:12.140 --> 59:14.940
 quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things.

59:14.940 --> 59:17.080
 You're trying to get your circuits,

59:17.080 --> 59:19.140
 although they're still based on silicon,

59:19.140 --> 59:22.480
 you're trying to get them to perform operations

59:22.480 --> 59:24.660
 that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain.

59:24.660 --> 59:26.700
 And that's where a great deal of work is

59:26.700 --> 59:27.700
 in neuromorphic computing,

59:27.700 --> 59:30.920
 people like Giacomo Indoveri and Gert Kauenberg,

59:30.920 --> 59:32.980
 Jennifer Hasler, countless others.

59:32.980 --> 59:36.900
 It's a rich and exciting field going back to Carver Mead

59:36.900 --> 59:39.460
 in the late 1980s.

59:39.460 --> 59:44.240
 And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum

59:44.240 --> 59:48.580
 is where you say, I'll give up anything related

59:48.580 --> 59:51.420
 to transistors or semiconductors or anything like that.

59:51.420 --> 59:53.620
 I'm not starting with the assumption

59:53.620 --> 59:55.060
 that I'm gonna use any kind

59:55.060 --> 59:57.020
 of conventional computing hardware.

59:57.020 --> 59:59.300
 And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand

59:59.300 --> 1:00:00.700
 what makes the brain powerful

1:00:00.700 --> 1:00:03.180
 at the kind of information processing it does.

1:00:03.180 --> 1:00:05.540
 And I wanna think from first principles

1:00:05.540 --> 1:00:10.540
 about what hardware is best going to enable us

1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:14.020
 to capture those information processing principles

1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:16.020
 in an artificial system.

1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:17.420
 And that's where I live.

1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:21.740
 That's where I'm doing my exploration these days.

1:00:21.740 --> 1:00:25.800
 So what are the first principles

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:29.960
 of brain like computation communication?

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.580
 Right, yeah, this is so important

1:00:32.580 --> 1:00:35.540
 and I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this because.

1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:37.240
 I only have 13, I'm sorry.

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:41.500
 Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated.

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:44.060
 And I think that's an important part

1:00:44.060 --> 1:00:46.300
 of why it can do what it does.

1:00:46.300 --> 1:00:48.700
 But okay, let me try to break it down.

1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:54.580
 Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before,

1:00:54.580 --> 1:00:57.100
 they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves

1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.220
 and synapses are too.

1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:03.060
 They can change their state based on the activity.

1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:04.900
 So they adapt over time.

1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:06.980
 That's crucial to the way the brain works.

1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:09.380
 They don't just adapt on one timescale,

1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:12.460
 they can adapt on myriad timescales

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:16.060
 from the spacing between pulses,

1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:18.700
 the spacing between spikes that come from neurons

1:01:18.700 --> 1:01:21.540
 all the way to the age of the organism.

1:01:23.100 --> 1:01:28.100
 Also relevant, perhaps I think the most important thing

1:01:28.100 --> 1:01:32.320
 that's guided my thinking is the network structure

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:33.880
 of the brain, so.

1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.600
 Which can also be adjusted on different scales.

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.440
 Absolutely, yes, so you're making new,

1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:41.360
 you're changing the strength of contacts,

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:44.120
 you're changing the spatial distribution of them,

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:46.900
 although spatial distribution doesn't change that much

1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:49.400
 once you're a mature organism.

1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:52.880
 But that network structure is really crucial.

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:55.400
 So let me dwell on that for a second.

1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:58.960
 You can't talk about the brain without emphasizing

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:02.880
 that most of the neurons in the neocortex

1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:04.840
 or the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:08.080
 that we think is most responsible for high level reasoning

1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:09.080
 and things like that,

1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.400
 those neurons make thousands of connections.

1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:15.560
 So you have this network that is highly interconnected.

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.880
 And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons

1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:23.180
 that they make so many different connections

1:02:23.180 --> 1:02:26.880
 is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:28.420
 from any spot in the network

1:02:28.420 --> 1:02:30.320
 to any other spot in the network.

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.920
 So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it.

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.480
 You can quantify this in terms of concepts

1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:41.020
 that are related to fractals and scale invariants,

1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:43.240
 which I think is a very beautiful concept.

1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:46.200
 So what I mean by that is kind of,

1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:50.720
 no matter what spatial scale you're looking at in the brain

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:53.520
 within certain bounds, you see the same

1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:54.960
 general statistical pattern.

1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:59.280
 So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex,

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.280
 most of the connections that those neurons

1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:04.480
 within that box make are gonna be within the box

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:06.200
 to each other in their local neighborhood.

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:09.280
 And that's sort of called clustering, loosely speaking.

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:10.920
 But a non negligible fraction

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.600
 is gonna go outside of that box.

1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:14.080
 And then if I draw a bigger box,

1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:16.400
 the pattern is gonna be exactly the same.

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.400
 So you have this scale invariants,

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:22.720
 and you also have a non vanishing probability

1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:25.400
 of a neuron making connection very far away.

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:28.720
 So suppose you wanna plot the probability

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.420
 of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance.

1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:34.240
 If that were an exponential function,

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.720
 it would go e to the minus radius

1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:38.700
 over some characteristic radius,

1:03:38.700 --> 1:03:41.840
 and it would drop off up to some certain radius,

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.920
 the probability would be reasonably close to one,

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:49.120
 and then beyond that characteristic length R zero,

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.280
 it would drop off sharply.

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.560
 And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.560
 are really localized, and that's not what we observe.

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.680
 Instead, what you see is that the probability

1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:03.760
 of making a longer distance connection, it does drop off,

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.760
 but it drops off as a power law.

1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:08.420
 So the probability that you're gonna have a connection

1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:13.180
 at some radius R goes as R to the minus some power.

1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:16.800
 And that's more, that's what we see with forces in nature,

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:18.440
 like the electromagnetic force

1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.440
 between two particles or gravity

1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:23.000
 goes as one over the radius squared.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.420
 So you can see this in fractals.

1:04:24.420 --> 1:04:28.600
 I love that there's like a fractal dynamics of the brain

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.460
 that if you zoom out, you draw the box

1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:35.040
 and you increase that box by certain step sizes,

1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:36.720
 you're gonna see the same statistics.

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.000
 I think that's probably very important

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.880
 to the way the brain processes information.

1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.600
 It's not just in the spatial domain,

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:45.640
 it's also in the temporal domain.

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:47.240
 And what I mean by that is...

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.640
 That's incredible that this emerged

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:52.320
 through the evolutionary process

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.880
 that potentially somehow connected

1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:57.800
 to the way the physics of the universe works.

1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:00.360
 Yeah, I couldn't agree more that it's a deep

1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:02.720
 and fascinating subject that I hope to be able

1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.160
 to spend the rest of my life studying.

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:07.280
 You think you need to solve, understand this,

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:10.120
 this fractal nature in order to understand intelligence

1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:11.520
 and communication. I do think so.

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.320
 I think they're deeply intertwined.

1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.880
 Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it.

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:19.400
 So just to push that one through,

1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:21.480
 the same thing happens in the temporal domain.

1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.000
 So suppose your neurons in your brain

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.160
 were always oscillating at the same frequency,

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:31.320
 then the probability of finding a neuron oscillating

1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:32.520
 as a function of frequency

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:34.520
 would be this narrowly peaked function

1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:36.520
 around that certain characteristic frequency.

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:37.880
 That's not at all what we see.

1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:40.240
 The probability of finding neurons oscillating

1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:43.880
 or producing spikes at a certain frequency

1:05:43.880 --> 1:05:45.200
 is again a power law,

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:49.640
 which means there's no defined scale

1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.720
 of the temporal activity in the brain.

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:56.040
 At what speed do your thoughts occur?

1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:58.280
 Well, there's a fastest speed they can occur

1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:01.520
 and that is limited by communication and other things,

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.960
 but there's not a characteristic scale.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:06.880
 We have thoughts on all temporal scales

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:10.800
 from a few tens of milliseconds,

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:13.360
 which is physiologically limited by our devices,

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.720
 compare that to tens of picoseconds

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:17.120
 that I talked about in superconductors,

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:19.240
 all the way up to the lifetime of the organism.

1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:20.720
 You can still think about things

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:22.560
 that happened to you when you were a kid.

1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:24.040
 Or if you wanna be really trippy

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:25.840
 then across multiple organisms

1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:27.440
 in the entirety of human civilization,

1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:29.400
 you have thoughts that span organisms, right?

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:31.200
 Yes, taking it to that level, yes.

1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:34.600
 If you're willing to see the entirety of the human species

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:37.160
 as a single organism with a collective intelligence

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.880
 and that too on a spatial and temporal scale,

1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:41.080
 there's thoughts occurring.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:44.000
 And then if you look at not just the human species,

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.440
 but the entirety of life on earth

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:49.600
 as an organism with thoughts that are occurring,

1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:51.600
 that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts,

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:54.640
 there's a different spatial and temporal scale there.

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:57.200
 This is getting very suspicious.

1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:58.640
 Well, hold on though, before we're done,

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.960
 I just wanna just tie the bow

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:04.280
 and say that the spatial and temporal aspects

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.440
 are intimately interrelated with each other.

1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:10.320
 So activity between neurons that are very close to each other

1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:13.560
 is more likely to happen on this faster timescale

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.280
 and information is gonna propagate

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.200
 and encompass more of the brain,

1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.280
 more of your cortices, different modules in the brain

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:23.720
 are gonna be engaged in information processing

1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:25.280
 on longer timescales.

1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:27.960
 So there's this concept of information integration

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.960
 where neurons are specialized.

1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:33.960
 Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:35.720
 has its specific purpose,

1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.880
 but they're also very much integrated.

1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:41.880
 So you have neurons that specialize,

1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:43.640
 but share their information.

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:47.560
 And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations

1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:49.400
 that occur across spatial and temporal scales.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:53.640
 I think capturing those dynamics in hardware,

1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:57.040
 to me, that's the goal of neuromorphic computing.

1:07:57.040 --> 1:07:58.680
 So does it need to look,

1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:00.800
 so first of all, that's fascinating.

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.960
 We stated some clear principles here.

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:08.120
 Now, does it have to look like the brain

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:09.800
 outside of those principles as well?

1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:11.320
 Like what other characteristics

1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:13.080
 have to look like the human brain?

1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.840
 Or can it be something very different?

1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:18.000
 Well, it depends on what you're trying to use it for.

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.760
 And so I think a lot of the community

1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:23.080
 asks that question a lot.

1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:24.360
 What are you gonna do with it?

1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:26.600
 And I completely get it.

1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:28.040
 I think that's a very important question.

1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:31.840
 And it's also sometimes not the most helpful question.

1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:33.800
 What if what you wanna do with it is study it?

1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.120
 What if you just wanna see,

1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:39.280
 what do you have to build into your hardware

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:41.880
 in order to observe these dynamical principles?

1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:47.520
 And also, I ask myself that question every day

1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:49.880
 and I'm not sure I'm able to answer that.

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.200
 So like, what are you gonna do

1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:53.480
 with this particular neuromorphic machine?

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.320
 So suppose what we're trying to do with it

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:56.960
 is build something that thinks.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:59.160
 We're not trying to get it to make us any money

1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:00.240
 or drive a car.

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:02.640
 Maybe we'll be able to do that, but that's not our goal.

1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.600
 Our goal is to see if we can get the same types of behaviors

1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:08.920
 that we observe in our own brain.

1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:10.480
 And by behaviors in this sense,

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.320
 what I mean the behaviors of the components,

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:16.000
 the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.120
 I think there's another element that I didn't really hit on

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:21.200
 that you also have to build into this.

1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:22.920
 And those are architectural principles.

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:26.680
 They have to do with the hierarchical modular construction

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:27.520
 of the network.

1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:30.200
 And without getting too lost in jargon,

1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:33.680
 the main point that I think is relevant there,

1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:35.720
 let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:38.200
 of the architecture of the brain.

1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:41.120
 So in the brain, you have the cortex,

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.560
 which is sort of this outer sheet.

1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.720
 It's actually, it's a layered structure.

1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:48.480
 You can, if you could take it out of your brain,

1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:50.680
 you could unroll it on the table

1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:53.560
 and it would be about the size of a pizza sitting there.

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:56.400
 And that's a module.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:09:57.800
 It does certain things.

1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:00.680
 It processes as Yogi Buzaki would say,

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:03.560
 it processes the what of what's going on around you.

1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:06.200
 But you have another really crucial module

1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:08.040
 that's called the hippocampus.

1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.520
 And that network is structured entirely differently.

1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:12.800
 First of all, this cortex that had described

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:14.640
 10 billion neurons in there.

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:16.840
 So numbers matter here.

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:20.360
 And they're organized in that sort of power law distribution

1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:22.880
 where the probability of making a connection drops off

1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:24.520
 as a power law in space.

1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.840
 The hippocampus is another module that's important

1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:30.880
 for understanding how, where you are,

1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:35.880
 when you are keeping track of your position

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:37.280
 in space and time.

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:39.280
 And that network is very much random.

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:41.960
 So the probability of making a connection,

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:44.760
 it almost doesn't even drop off as a function of distance.

1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:46.720
 It's the same probability that you'll make it here

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.520
 to over there, but there are only about 100 million neurons

1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:54.680
 there, so you can have that huge densely connected module

1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:57.280
 because it's not so big.

1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:02.040
 And the neocortex or the cortex and the hippocampus,

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.920
 they talk to each other constantly.

1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:07.920
 And that communication is largely facilitated

1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:09.720
 by what's called the thalamus.

1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:10.880
 I'm not a neuroscientist here.

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.960
 I'm trying to do my best to recite things.

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:14.680
 Cartoon picture of the brain, I gotcha.

1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:15.560
 Yeah, something like that.

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:18.640
 So this thalamus is coordinating the activity

1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:20.760
 between the neocortex and the hippocampus

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:23.560
 and making sure that they talk to each other

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.280
 at the right time and send messages

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:26.840
 that will be useful to one another.

1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:29.120
 So this all taken together is called

1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:31.600
 the thalamocortical complex.

1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:34.880
 And it seems like building something like that

1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:39.280
 is going to be crucial to capturing the types of activity

1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.400
 we're looking for because those responsibilities,

1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:45.720
 those separate modules, they do different things,

1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:50.720
 that's gotta be central to achieving these states

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:54.840
 of efficient information integration across space and time.

1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.960
 By the way, I am able to achieve this state

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.800
 by watching simulations, visualizations

1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:03.800
 of the thalamocortical complex.

1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:06.440
 There's a few people I forget from where.

1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:09.880
 They've created these incredible visual illustrations

1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:14.880
 of visual stimulation from the eye or something like that.

1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:18.520
 And this image flowing through the brain.

1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:20.880
 Wow, I haven't seen that, I gotta check that out.

1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:22.120
 So it's one of those things,

1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.280
 you find this stuff in the world,

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:26.960
 and you see on YouTube, it has 1,000 views,

1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.800
 these visualizations of the human brain

1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:32.120
 processing information.

1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:36.440
 And because there's chemistry there,

1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.880
 because this is from actual human brains,

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.720
 I don't know how they're doing the coloring,

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.840
 but they're able to actually trace

1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.680
 the different, the chemical and the electrical signals

1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:48.880
 throughout the brain, and the visual thing,

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:51.800
 it's like, whoa, because it looks kinda like the universe,

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:53.800
 I mean, the whole thing is just incredible.

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.640
 I recommend it highly, I'll probably post a link to it.

1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.960
 But you can just look for, one of the things they simulate

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.840
 is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization.

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.520
 You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it's beautiful.

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:11.320
 The other question I have for you is,

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.440
 how does memory play into all of this?

1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:17.120
 Because all the signals sending back and forth,

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:20.880
 that's computation and communication,

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:25.880
 but that's kinda like processing of inputs and outputs,

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.560
 to produce outputs in the system,

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.000
 that's kinda like maybe reasoning,

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.920
 maybe there's some kind of recurrence.

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:33.920
 But is there a storage mechanism that you think about

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:35.840
 in the context of neuromorphic computing?

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:37.760
 Yeah, absolutely, so that's gotta be central.

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.520
 You have to have a way that you can store memories.

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:43.600
 And there are a lot of different kinds

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:45.480
 of memory in the brain.

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.160
 That's yet another example of how it's not a simple system.

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:53.000
 So there's one kind of memory,

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.880
 one way of talking about memory,

1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:59.040
 usually starts in the context of Hopfield networks.

1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.440
 You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program.

1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:05.840
 But the basic idea there is working memory

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:07.840
 is stored in the dynamical patterns

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:10.400
 of activity between neurons.

1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:14.760
 And you can think of a certain pattern of activity

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:19.680
 as an attractor, meaning if you put in some signal

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.400
 that's similar enough to other

1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:26.480
 previously experienced signals like that,

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:29.600
 then you're going to converge to the same network dynamics

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.760
 and you will see these neurons

1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.200
 participate in the same network patterns of activity

1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.600
 that they have in the past.

1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:39.720
 So you can talk about the probability

1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:42.520
 that different inputs will allow you to converge

1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:44.240
 to different basins of attraction

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:46.600
 and you might think of that as,

1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:49.040
 oh, I saw this face and then I excited

1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:50.920
 this network pattern of activity

1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:53.080
 because last time I saw that face,

1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:56.960
 I was at some movie and that's a famous person

1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.120
 that's on the screen or something like that.

1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:00.560
 So that's one memory storage mechanism.

1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:04.400
 But crucial to the ability to imprint those memories

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.040
 in your brain is the ability to change

1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:11.360
 the strength of connection between one neuron and another,

1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:13.280
 that synaptic connection between them.

1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:18.000
 So synaptic weight update is a massive field of neuroscience

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.560
 and neuromorphic computing as well.

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:24.560
 So there are two poles on that spectrum.

1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:28.880
 Okay, so more in the language of machine learning,

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.000
 we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning.

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.960
 And when I'm trying to tie that down

1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:35.520
 to neuromorphic computing,

1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.440
 I will use a definition of supervised learning,

1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:42.960
 which basically means the external user,

1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:45.520
 the person who's controlling this hardware

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:48.360
 has some knob that they can tune

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.400
 to change each of the synaptic weights,

1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:52.160
 depending on whether or not the network

1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:53.560
 is doing what you want it to do.

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:56.120
 Whereas what I mean in this conversation

1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:57.600
 when I say unsupervised learning

1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:59.400
 is that those synaptic weights

1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:03.120
 are dynamically changing in your network

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:05.000
 based on nothing that the user is doing,

1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.080
 nothing that there's no wire from the outside

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:09.040
 going into any of those synapses.

1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:12.080
 The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:15.760
 based on physical properties

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.600
 that you've built into the devices.

1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:21.400
 So if the synapse receives a pulse from here

1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:23.360
 and that causes the neuron to spike,

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:27.040
 some circuit built in there with no help from me

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:29.200
 or anybody else adjust the weight

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.400
 in a way that makes it more likely

1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:34.600
 to store the useful information

1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:36.360
 and excite the useful network patterns

1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:39.360
 and makes it less likely that random noise,

1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:41.440
 useless communication events

1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:45.320
 will have an important effect on the network activity.

1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:48.280
 So there's memory encoded in the weights,

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:49.760
 the synaptic weights.

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.880
 What about the formation of something

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.680
 that's not often done in machine learning,

1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:56.280
 the formation of new synaptic connections?

1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:57.440
 Right, well, that seems to,

1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.120
 so again, not a neuroscientist here,

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:01.960
 but my reading of the literature

1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:04.000
 is that that's particularly crucial

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.400
 in early stages of brain development

1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:09.160
 where a newborn is born

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:11.680
 with tons of extra synaptic connections

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.880
 and it's actually pruned over time.

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:16.800
 So the number of synapses decreases

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:19.680
 as opposed to growing new long distance connections.

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.280
 It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons

1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:26.080
 and assign new synaptic connections

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:29.120
 but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism

1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:31.840
 by which the brain is learning.

1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:34.280
 So for example, like right now,

1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:35.720
 sitting here talking to you,

1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:37.000
 you say lots of interesting things

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.760
 and I learn from you

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:41.240
 and I can remember things that you just said

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:44.720
 and I didn't grow new axonal connections

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.360
 down to new synapses to enable those.

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:50.160
 It's plasticity mechanisms

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:52.920
 in the synaptic connections between neurons

1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.960
 that enable me to learn on that timescale.

1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:57.560
 So at the very least,

1:17:57.560 --> 1:17:59.880
 you can sufficiently approximate that

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.360
 with just weight updates.

1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:02.920
 You don't need to form new connections.

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:05.040
 I would say weight updates are a big part of it.

1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:06.200
 I also think there's more

1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:08.600
 because broadly speaking,

1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:10.440
 when we're doing machine learning,

1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:12.480
 our networks, say we're talking about feed forward,

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:14.120
 deep neural networks,

1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:16.960
 the temporal domain is not really part of it.

1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:18.200
 Okay, you're gonna put in an image

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:20.400
 and you're gonna get out a classification

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:22.000
 and you're gonna do that as fast as possible.

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.160
 So you care about time

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.640
 but time is not part of the essence of this thing really.

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:30.040
 Whereas in spiking neural networks,

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:31.760
 what we see in the brain,

1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:33.360
 time is as crucial as space

1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:34.600
 and they're intimately intertwined

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:36.000
 as I've tried to say.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.280
 And so adaptation on different timescales

1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:44.120
 is important not just in memory formation,

1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:45.360
 although it plays a key role there,

1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:48.240
 but also in just keeping the activity

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.320
 in a useful dynamic range.

1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:52.520
 So you have other plasticity mechanisms,

1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:54.200
 not just weight update,

1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:56.760
 or at least not on the timescale

1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.760
 of many action potentials,

1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:00.200
 but even on the shorter timescale.

1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.720
 So a synapse can become much less efficacious.

1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:07.200
 It can transmit a weaker signal

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:08.800
 after the second, third, fourth,

1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:11.960
 that can second, third, fourth action potential

1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:13.040
 to occur in a sequence.

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:15.960
 So that's what's called short term synaptic plasticity,

1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:17.600
 which is a form of learning.

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.640
 You're learning that I'm getting too much stimulus

1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:21.640
 from looking at something bright right now.

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:23.360
 So I need to tone that down.

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:28.080
 There's also another really important mechanism

1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:30.520
 in learning that's called metoplasticity.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:33.560
 What that seems to be is a way

1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:37.400
 that you change not the weights themselves,

1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:40.280
 but the rate at which the weights change.

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:45.280
 So when I am in say a lecture hall and my,

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:48.400
 this is a potentially terrible cartoon example,

1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:49.680
 but let's say I'm in a lecture hall

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.960
 and it's time to learn, right?

1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:54.280
 So my brain will release more,

1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:57.240
 perhaps dopamine or some neuromodulator

1:19:57.240 --> 1:20:00.320
 that's gonna change the rate

1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:02.240
 at which synaptic plasticity occurs.

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:03.840
 So that can make me more sensitive

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:05.320
 to learning at certain times,

1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:08.360
 more sensitive to overriding previous information

1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:10.320
 and less sensitive at other times.

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:13.200
 And finally, as long as I'm rattling off the list,

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:16.480
 I think another concept that falls in the category

1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:20.560
 of learning or memory adaptation is homeostasis

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:22.440
 or homeostatic adaptation,

1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:24.960
 where neurons have the ability

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:27.800
 to control their firing rate.

1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:31.200
 So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much,

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.000
 it will naturally tone itself down.

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.520
 Its threshold will adjust

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:38.520
 so that it stays in a useful dynamical range.

1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:41.680
 And we see that that's captured in deep neural networks

1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.320
 where you don't just change the synaptic weights,

1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:46.680
 but you can also move the thresholds of simple neurons

1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:47.520
 in those models.

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:52.520
 And so to achieve the spiking neural networks,

1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.640
 you want to use,

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:01.200
 you want to implement the first principles

1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:03.400
 that you mentioned of the temporal

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.040
 and the spatial fractal dynamics here.

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:09.240
 So you can communicate locally,

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:13.320
 you can communicate across much greater distances

1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.000
 and do the same thing in space

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.040
 and do the same thing in time.

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:21.040
 Now, you have like a chapter called

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:24.360
 Superconducting Hardware for Neuromorphic Computing.

1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:27.760
 So what are some ideas that integrate

1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:29.080
 some of the things we've been talking about

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:32.080
 in terms of the first principles of neuromorphic computing

1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:34.280
 and the ideas that you outline

1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:38.040
 in optoelectronic intelligence?

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.920
 Yeah, so let me start, I guess,

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:42.520
 on the communication side of things,

1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:46.280
 because that's what led us down this track

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.120
 in the first place.

1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:51.800
 By us, I'm talking about my team of colleagues at NIST,

1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:54.800
 Saeed Han, Bryce Brimavera, Sonia Buckley,

1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:57.200
 Jeff Chiles, Adam McCallum to name,

1:21:57.200 --> 1:21:58.720
 Alex Tate to name a few,

1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:01.240
 our group leaders, Saewoo Nam and Rich Mirren.

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.480
 We've all contributed to this.

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:05.880
 So this is not me saying necessarily

1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:07.560
 just the things that I've proposed,

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:09.600
 but sort of where our team's thinking

1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:11.560
 has evolved over the years.

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.720
 Can I quickly ask, what is NIST

1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:18.080
 and where is this amazing group of people located?

1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:21.800
 NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:26.720
 The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:29.720
 Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado.

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:36.240
 NIST is a federal agency under the Department of Commerce.

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:40.160
 We do a lot with, by we, I mean other people at NIST,

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.040
 do a lot with standards,

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.080
 making sure that we understand the system of units,

1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:49.320
 international system of units, precision measurements.

1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:53.560
 There's a lot going on in electrical engineering,

1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:54.760
 material science.

1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.000
 And it's historic.

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.280
 I mean, it's one of those, it's like MIT

1:22:58.280 --> 1:22:59.120
 or something like that.

1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:00.960
 It has a reputation over many decades

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:04.240
 of just being this really a place

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.520
 where there's a lot of brilliant people have done

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:07.600
 a lot of amazing things.

1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:10.600
 But in terms of the people in your team,

1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:12.760
 in this team of people involved

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.600
 in the concept we're talking about now,

1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:15.440
 I'm just curious,

1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:17.240
 what kind of disciplines are we talking about?

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.080
 What is it?

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.240
 Mostly physicists and electrical engineers,

1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:21.880
 some material scientists,

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.840
 but I would say,

1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:27.240
 yeah, I think physicists and electrical engineers,

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:29.480
 my background is in photonics,

1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:31.040
 the use of light for technology.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:36.040
 So coming from there, I tend to have found colleagues

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.240
 that are more from that background.

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.240
 Although Adam McConn,

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:42.720
 more of a superconducting electronics background,

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.280
 we need a diversity of folks.

1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:46.840
 This project is sort of cross disciplinary.

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:48.280
 I would love to be working more

1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:50.800
 with neuroscientists and things,

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:53.880
 but we haven't reached that scale yet.

1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:54.720
 But yeah.

1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:56.480
 You're focused on the hardware side,

1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:59.160
 which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned.

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:00.000
 And then of course,

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.120
 neuroscientists may be a source of inspiration

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.360
 for some of the longterm vision.

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:06.240
 I would actually call it more than inspiration.

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:11.120
 I would call it sort of a roadmap.

1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:15.000
 We're not trying to build exactly the brain,

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.520
 but I don't think it's enough to just say,

1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:19.240
 oh, neurons kind of work like that.

1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:20.760
 Let's kind of do that thing.

1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.360
 I mean, we're very much following the concepts

1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.440
 that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us,

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:30.520
 which I believe is a really robust roadmap.

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:33.040
 I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent,

1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:36.080
 it's often stated that we just don't understand the brain.

1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:37.960
 And so it's really hard to replicate it

1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:40.200
 because we just don't know what's going on there.

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:43.560
 And maybe five or seven years ago,

1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:44.800
 I would have said that,

1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:47.880
 but as I got more interested in the subject,

1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:50.480
 I read more of the neuroscience literature

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:53.640
 and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense.

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:55.880
 I can't believe how much they know about this.

1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:59.320
 I can't believe how mathematically rigorous

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.960
 and sort of theoretically complete

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.240
 a lot of the concepts are.

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:06.680
 That's not to say we understand consciousness

1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:08.560
 or we understand the self or anything like that,

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:11.040
 but what is the brain doing

1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:13.600
 and why is it doing those things?

1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:16.000
 Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.840
 So if you're a hardware designer

1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:19.440
 that just wants to get going,

1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:23.000
 whoa, it's pretty clear which direction to go in, I think.

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:28.000
 Okay, so I love the optimism behind that,

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:31.120
 but in the implementation of these systems

1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:37.640
 that uses superconductivity, how do you make it happen?

1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.880
 So to me, it starts with thinking

1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:43.400
 about the communication network.

1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:47.560
 You know for sure that the ability of each neuron

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:50.560
 to communicate to many thousands of colleagues

1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:52.360
 across the network is indispensable.

1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.280
 I take that as a core principle of my architecture,

1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:58.440
 my thinking on the subject.

1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:02.280
 So coming from a background in photonics,

1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.560
 it was very natural to say,

1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:05.360
 okay, we're gonna use light for communication.

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.720
 Just in case listeners may not know,

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:10.840
 light is often used in communication.

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.720
 I mean, if you think about radio, that's light,

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.320
 it's long wavelengths, but it's electromagnetic radiation.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:17.640
 It's the same physical phenomenon

1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:20.200
 obeying exactly the same Maxwell's equations.

1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:24.920
 And then all the way down to fiber, fiber optics.

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:26.240
 Now you're using visible

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.800
 or near infrared wavelengths of light,

1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:30.360
 but the way you send messages across the ocean

1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:33.200
 is now contemporary over optical fibers.

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:37.480
 So using light for communication is not a stretch.

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:38.960
 It makes perfect sense.

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.520
 So you might ask, well, why don't you use light

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:45.280
 for communication in a conventional microchip?

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:49.280
 And the answer to that is, I believe, physical.

1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.080
 If we had a light source on a silicon chip

1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.880
 that was as simple as a transistor,

1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.240
 there would not be a processor in the world

1:26:58.240 --> 1:26:59.760
 that didn't use light for communication,

1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.800
 at least above some distance.

1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.080
 How many light sources are needed?

1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:06.840
 Oh, you need a light source at every single point.

1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:08.440
 A light source per neuron.

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:09.960
 Per neuron, per little,

1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:13.120
 but then if you could have a really small

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.080
 and nice light source,

1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:17.960
 your definition of neuron could be flexible.

1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:19.200
 Could be, yes, yes.

1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:21.720
 Sometimes it's helpful to me to say,

1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.560
 in this hardware, a neuron is that entity

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:25.720
 which has a light source.

1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:27.960
 That, and I can explain.

1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:29.520
 And then there was light.

1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:32.280
 I mean, I can explain more about that, but.

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.680
 Somehow this like rhymes with consciousness

1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:38.240
 because people will often say the light of consciousness.

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:41.680
 So that consciousness is that which is conscious.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:42.520
 I got it.

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:44.840
 That's not my quote.

1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:47.000
 That's me, that's my quote.

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.520
 You see, that quote comes from my background.

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:53.600
 Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine's in darkness.

1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:56.920
 So go ahead.

1:27:56.920 --> 1:27:59.640
 So the point I was making there is that

1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:02.960
 if it was easy to manufacture light sources

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:05.760
 along with transistors on a silicon chip,

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:07.240
 they would be everywhere.

1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:08.880
 And it's not easy.

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:10.160
 People have been trying for decades

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.960
 and it's actually extremely difficult.

1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:14.040
 I think an important part of our research

1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.960
 is dwelling right at that spot there.

1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:17.800
 So.

1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:18.720
 Is it physics or engineering?

1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:19.560
 It's physics.

1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:22.280
 So, okay, so it's physics, I think.

1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:26.920
 So what I mean by that is, as we discussed,

1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:29.400
 silicon is the material of choice for transistors

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.280
 and it's very difficult to imagine

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:35.200
 that that's gonna change anytime soon.

1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.160
 Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light.

1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:43.320
 And that has to do with the immutable properties

1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:44.160
 of silicon itself.

1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:47.880
 The way that the energy bands are structured in silicon,

1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.520
 you're never going to make silicon efficient

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:53.520
 as a light source at room temperature

1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:55.640
 without doing very exotic things

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:58.320
 that degrade its ability to interface nicely

1:28:58.320 --> 1:28:59.840
 with those transistors in the first place.

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.600
 So that's like one of these things where it's,

1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:05.200
 why is nature dealing us that blow?

1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:07.000
 You give us these beautiful transistors

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.640
 and you give us all the motivation

1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.120
 to use light for communication,

1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:11.520
 but then you don't give us a light source.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:14.040
 So, well, okay, you do give us a light source.

1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:15.320
 Compound semiconductors,

1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:16.880
 like we talked about back at the beginning,

1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:19.640
 an element from group three and an element from group five

1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:21.800
 form an alloy where every other lattice site

1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:23.680
 switches which element it is.

1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:27.240
 Those have much better properties for generating light.

1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:30.040
 You put electrons in, light comes out.

1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:33.120
 Almost 100% of the electron hold,

1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.080
 it can be made efficient.

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.440
 I'll take your word for it, okay.

1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:39.600
 However, I say it's physics, not engineering,

1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:41.920
 because it's very difficult

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:45.240
 to get those compound semiconductor light sources

1:29:45.240 --> 1:29:47.520
 situated with your silicon.

1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:49.400
 In order to do that ion implantation

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.760
 that I talked about at the beginning,

1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:52.720
 high temperatures are required.

1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:55.680
 So you gotta make all of your transistors first

1:29:55.680 --> 1:29:58.560
 and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there.

1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:00.800
 You can't grow them afterwards

1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:02.360
 because that requires high temperature.

1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:04.000
 It screws up all your transistors.

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.800
 You try and stick them on there.

1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:07.960
 They don't have the same lattice constant.

1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:10.320
 The spacing between atoms is different enough

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:11.640
 that it just doesn't work.

1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:15.520
 So nature does not seem to be telling us that,

1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:17.960
 hey, go ahead and combine light sources

1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:19.960
 with your digital switches

1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.680
 for conventional digital computing.

1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:24.720
 And conventional digital computing

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:27.640
 will often require smaller scale, I guess,

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:29.560
 in terms of like smartphone.

1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:35.440
 So in which kind of systems does nature hint

1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:40.440
 that we can use light and photons for communication?

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:42.920
 Well, so let me just try and be clear.

1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:46.240
 You can use light for communication in digital systems,

1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:49.640
 just the light sources are not intimately integrated

1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:50.480
 with the silicon.

1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:52.080
 You manufacture all the silicon,

1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:54.680
 you have your microchip, plunk it down.

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:56.640
 And then you manufacture your light sources,

1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:58.720
 separate chip, completely different process

1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:00.440
 made in a different foundry.

1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:03.200
 And then you put those together at the package level.

1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:06.920
 So now you have some,

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:09.480
 I would say a great deal of architectural limitations

1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:13.920
 that are introduced by that sort of

1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:15.400
 package level integration

1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:18.000
 as opposed to monolithic on the same chip integration,

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.600
 but it's still a very useful thing to do.

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.120
 And that's where I had done some work previously

1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.080
 before I came to NIST.

1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:27.920
 There's a project led by Vladimir Stoyanovich

1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:30.800
 that now spun out into a company called IR Labs

1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:33.200
 led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:34.440
 where they're doing exactly that.

1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:36.440
 So you have your light source chip,

1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:39.760
 your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing,

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:40.880
 maybe it's digital electronics,

1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:43.600
 maybe it's some other control purpose, something.

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:47.760
 And the silicon chip drives the light source chip

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:49.800
 and modulates the intensity of the lights.

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:52.640
 You can get data out of the package on an optical fiber.

1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:56.560
 And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.800
 as opposed to sending those signals out

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:00.760
 over electrical lines.

1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:05.160
 But it is somewhat peculiar to my eye

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.880
 that they have to be integrated at this package level.

1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:09.760
 And those people, I mean, they're so smart.

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:12.880
 Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal.

1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:15.520
 So it's very clear that it's not just

1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:18.760
 they're making a bad choice.

1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.480
 This is what physics is telling us.

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:22.280
 It just wouldn't make any sense

1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.240
 to try to stick them together.

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:26.520
 Yeah, so even if it's difficult,

1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:30.880
 it's easier than the alternative, unfortunately.

1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:31.720
 I think so, yes.

1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:33.280
 And again, I need to go back

1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:35.080
 and make sure that I'm not taking the wrong way.

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:36.800
 I'm not saying that the pursuit

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.400
 of integrating compound semiconductors with silicon

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:41.120
 is fruitless and shouldn't be pursued.

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.440
 It should, and people are doing great work.

1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:45.720
 Kai Mei Lau and John Bowers, others,

1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:48.240
 they're doing it and they're making progress.

1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:52.200
 But to my eye, it doesn't look like that's ever going to be

1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:57.720
 just the standard monolithic light source

1:32:57.720 --> 1:32:58.600
 on silicon process.

1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:00.040
 I just don't see it.

1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:02.840
 Yeah, so nature kind of points the way usually.

1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:04.480
 And if you resist nature,

1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:05.680
 you're gonna have to do a lot more work.

1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:07.720
 And it's gonna be expensive and not scalable.

1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:08.560
 Got it.

1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:11.320
 But okay, so let's go far into the future.

1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:14.760
 Let's imagine this gigantic neuromorphic computing system

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:17.360
 that simulates all of our realities.

1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:19.080
 It currently is Mantra Matrix 4.

1:33:19.080 --> 1:33:23.200
 So this thing, this powerful computer,

1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:24.880
 how does it operate?

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:27.520
 So what are the neurons?

1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:29.040
 What is the communication?

1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:30.000
 What's your sense?

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.480
 All right, so let me now,

1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:34.720
 after spending 45 minutes trashing

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.160
 light source integration with silicon,

1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:40.160
 let me now say why I'm basing my entire life,

1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:43.680
 professional life, on integrating light sources

1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:44.960
 with electronics.

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:47.040
 I think the game is completely different

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:49.560
 when you're talking about superconducting electronics.

1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:54.240
 For several reasons, let me try to go through them.

1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:56.480
 One is that, as I mentioned,

1:33:56.480 --> 1:33:57.960
 it's difficult to integrate

1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:01.280
 those compound semiconductor light sources with silicon.

1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:04.800
 With silicon is a requirement that is introduced

1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.280
 by the fact that you're using semiconducting electronics.

1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:08.840
 In superconducting electronics,

1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:10.840
 you're still gonna start with a silicon wafer,

1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:13.880
 but it's just the bread for your sandwich in a lot of ways.

1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:15.800
 You're not using that silicon

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.720
 in precisely the same way for the electronics.

1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:20.440
 You're now depositing superconducting materials

1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:21.840
 on top of that.

1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:24.520
 The prospects for integrating light sources

1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:27.400
 with that kind of an electronic process

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.480
 are certainly less explored,

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:31.960
 but I think much more promising

1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:34.280
 because you don't need those light sources

1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.600
 to be intimately integrated with the transistors.

1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:37.920
 That's where the problems come up.

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:39.920
 They don't need to be lattice matched to the silicon,

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.160
 all that kind of stuff.

1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.640
 Instead, it seems possible

1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:47.320
 that you can take those compound semiconductor light sources,

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:49.160
 stick them on the silicon wafer,

1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:51.400
 and then grow your superconducting electronics

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:52.320
 on the top of that.

1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:55.800
 It's at least not obviously going to fail.

1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:57.280
 So the computation would be done

1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:00.120
 on the superconductive material as well?

1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:01.920
 Yes, the computation is done

1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:03.920
 in the superconducting electronics,

1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:06.400
 and the light sources receive signals

1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:08.200
 that say, hey, a neuron reached threshold,

1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:09.800
 produce a pulse of light,

1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:12.480
 send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections.

1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.240
 Those are, again, superconducting electronics.

1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:18.000
 Perform your computation,

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.640
 and you're off to the races.

1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:20.760
 Your network works.

1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.600
 So then if we can rewind real quick,

1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:25.960
 so what are the limitations of the challenges

1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:28.920
 of superconducting electronics

1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:31.480
 when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?

1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:35.640
 So actually, let me say one other thing

1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:37.560
 about the light sources,

1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:39.840
 and then I'll move on, I promise,

1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:42.320
 because this is probably tedious for some.

1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:44.000
 This is super exciting.

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:45.720
 Okay, one other thing about the light sources.

1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:48.920
 I said that silicon is terrible at emitting photons.

1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:50.640
 It's just not what it's meant to do.

1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:52.800
 However, the game is different

1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:54.080
 when you're at low temperature.

1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:55.720
 If you're working with superconductors,

1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:56.960
 you have to be at low temperature

1:35:56.960 --> 1:35:58.680
 because they don't work otherwise.

1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:00.240
 When you're at four Kelvin,

1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:03.440
 silicon is not obviously a terrible light source.

1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:05.840
 It's still not as efficient as compound semiconductors,

1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:08.680
 but it might be good enough for this application.

1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:11.320
 The final thing that I'll mention about that is, again,

1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:13.960
 leveraging superconductors, as I said,

1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:15.360
 in a different context,

1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:19.520
 superconducting detectors can receive one single photon.

1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:21.240
 In that conversation, I failed to mention

1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:23.480
 that semiconductors can also receive photons.

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.200
 That's the primary mechanism by which it's done.

1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:29.400
 A camera in your phone that's receptive to visible light

1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.080
 is receiving photons.

1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:32.200
 It's based on silicon,

1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.360
 or you can make it in different semiconductors

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:36.600
 for different wavelengths,

1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:39.600
 but it requires on the order of a thousand,

1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:43.560
 a few thousand photons to receive a pulse.

1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:46.160
 Now, when you're using a superconducting detector,

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:48.360
 you need one photon, exactly one.

1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:50.840
 I mean, one or more.

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:54.840
 So the fact that your synapses can now be based

1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:56.680
 on superconducting detectors

1:36:56.680 --> 1:36:58.800
 instead of semiconducting detectors

1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:00.720
 brings the light levels that are required

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:03.160
 down by some three orders of magnitude.

1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:06.520
 So now you don't need good light sources.

1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:08.800
 You can have the world's worst light sources.

1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:11.840
 As long as they spit out maybe a few thousand photons

1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:13.800
 every time a neuron fires,

1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:17.640
 you have the hardware principles in place

1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:19.640
 that you might be able to perform

1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:21.720
 this optoelectronic integration.

1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.040
 To me optoelectronic integration is, it's just so enticing.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:28.680
 We want to be able to leverage electronics for computation,

1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:30.400
 light for communication,

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:32.800
 working with silicon microelectronics at room temperature

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.000
 that has been exceedingly difficult.

1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:40.000
 And I hope that when we move to the superconducting domain,

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.840
 target a different application space

1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:44.920
 that is neuromorphic instead of digital

1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:47.680
 and use superconducting detectors,

1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:50.120
 maybe optoelectronic integration comes to us.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:51.720
 Okay, so there's a bunch of questions.

1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:53.680
 So one is temperature.

1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:58.320
 So in these kinds of hybrid heterogeneous systems,

1:37:58.320 --> 1:37:59.560
 what's the temperature?

1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:01.600
 What are some of the constraints to the operation here?

1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:03.560
 Does it all have to be a four Kelvin as well?

1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:04.400
 Four Kelvin.

1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:06.840
 Everything has to be at four Kelvin.

1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:09.720
 Okay, so what are the other engineering challenges

1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:14.320
 of making this kind of optoelectronic systems?

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:16.720
 Let me just dwell on that four Kelvin for a second

1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:18.280
 because some people hear four Kelvin

1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:19.280
 and they just get up and leave.

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:21.480
 They just say, I'm not doing it, you know?

1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:25.360
 And to me, that's very earth centric, species centric.

1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:27.240
 We live in 300 Kelvin.

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.120
 So we want our technologies to operate there too.

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:30.080
 I totally get it.

1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:31.880
 Yeah, what's zero Celsius?

1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:34.520
 Zero Celsius is 273 Kelvin.

1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:37.640
 So we're talking very, very cold here.

1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:38.480
 This is...

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:39.400
 Not even Boston cold.

1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:40.240
 No.

1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:42.400
 This is real cold.

1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:43.240
 Yeah.

1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:44.280
 Siberia cold, no.

1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:45.680
 Okay, so just for reference,

1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:47.920
 the temperature of the cosmic microwave background

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.400
 is about 2.7 Kelvin.

1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:51.680
 So we're still warmer than deep space.

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:52.960
 Yeah, good.

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:56.520
 So that when the universe dies out,

1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:57.920
 it'll be colder than four K.

1:38:57.920 --> 1:38:59.400
 It's already colder than four K.

1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:01.760
 In the expanses, you know,

1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:05.000
 you don't have to get that far away from the earth

1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.040
 in order to drop down to not far from four Kelvin.

1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:11.200
 So what you're saying is the aliens that live at the edge

1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:13.280
 of the observable universe

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:16.440
 are using superconductive material for their computation.

1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:17.880
 They don't have to live at the edge of the universe.

1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:21.040
 The aliens that are more advanced than us

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.480
 in their solar system are doing this

1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.560
 in their asteroid belt.

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:27.800
 We can get to that.

1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:30.320
 Oh, because they can get that

1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:31.640
 to that temperature easier there?

1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:32.480
 Sure, yeah.

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:34.120
 All you have to do is reflect the sunlight away

1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:36.080
 and you have a huge headstart.

1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:37.680
 Oh, so the sun is the problem here.

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:39.000
 Like it's warm here on earth.

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:39.840
 Got it. Yeah.

1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:41.560
 Okay, so can you...

1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:42.920
 So how do we get to four K?

1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:43.760
 What's...

1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.320
 Well, okay, so what I want to say about temperature...

1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:48.160
 Yeah.

1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:50.640
 What I want to say about temperature is that

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:52.600
 if you can swallow that,

1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:56.200
 if you can say, all right, I give up applications

1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.200
 that have to do with my cell phone

1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:02.040
 and the convenience of a laptop on a train

1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:03.760
 and you instead...

1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:06.440
 For me, I'm very much in the scientific head space.

1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:07.960
 I'm not looking at products.

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:09.880
 I'm not looking at what this will be useful

1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.000
 to sell to consumers.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.400
 Instead, I'm thinking about scientific questions.

1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:16.560
 Well, it's just not that bad to have to work at four Kelvin.

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:19.000
 We do it all the time in our labs at NIST.

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:19.840
 And so does...

1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.440
 I mean, for reference,

1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:25.560
 the entire quantum computing sector

1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:28.680
 usually has to work at something like 100 millikelvin,

1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:29.680
 50 millikelvin.

1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:32.120
 So now you're talking of another factor of 100

1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:35.160
 even colder than that, a fraction of a degree.

1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:37.360
 And everybody seems to think quantum computing

1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:39.200
 is going to take over the world.

1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:40.720
 It's so much more expensive

1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:46.600
 to have to get that extra factor of 10 or whatever colder.

1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:50.280
 And yet it's not stopping people from investing in that area.

1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:53.840
 And by investing, I mean putting their research into it

1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.760
 as well as venture capital or whatever.

1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:56.600
 So...

1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.600
 Oh, so based on the energy of what you're commenting on,

1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.960
 I'm getting a sense that's one of the criticism

1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.720
 of this approach is 4K, 4 Kelvin is a big negative.

1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:10.680
 It is the showstopper for a lot of people.

1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.880
 They just, I mean, and understandably,

1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:16.840
 I'm not saying that that's not a consideration.

1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:17.840
 Of course it is.

1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:18.800
 For some...

1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:21.440
 Okay, so different motivations for different people.

1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:23.000
 In the academic world,

1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.400
 suppose you spent your whole life

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:26.760
 learning about silicon microelectronic circuits.

1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:28.880
 You send a design to a foundry,

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:30.520
 they send you back a chip

1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:33.000
 and you go test it at your tabletop.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:34.360
 And now I'm saying,

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.520
 here now learn how to use all these cryogenics

1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.440
 so you can do that at 4 Kelvin.

1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:39.880
 No, come on, man.

1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:41.200
 I don't wanna do that.

1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:42.040
 That sounds bad.

1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:44.520
 It's the old momentum, the Titanic of the turning.

1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:45.600
 Yeah, kind of.

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:48.360
 But you're saying that's not too much of a...

1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360
 When we're looking at large systems

1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.320
 and the gain you can potentially get from them,

1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:53.440
 that's not that much of a cost.

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:55.160
 And when you wanna answer the scientific question

1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:58.120
 about what are the physical limits of cognition?

1:41:58.120 --> 1:41:59.800
 Well, the physical limits,

1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.440
 they don't care if you're at 4 Kelvin.

1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:04.560
 If you can perform cognition at a scale

1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:07.680
 orders of magnitude beyond any room temperature technology,

1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:09.760
 but you gotta get cold to do it,

1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:10.600
 you're gonna do it.

1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:14.600
 And to me, that's the interesting application space.

1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:16.120
 It's not even an application space,

1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:18.920
 that's the interesting scientific paradigm.

1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:22.560
 So I personally am not going to let low temperature

1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.560
 stop me from realizing a technological domain or realm

1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.800
 that is achieving in most ways everything else

1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:36.160
 that I'm looking for in my hardware.

1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:37.640
 So that, okay, that's a big one.

1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:40.000
 Is there other kind of engineering challenges

1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:40.840
 that you envision?

1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:41.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:43.120
 So let me take a moment here

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:45.760
 because I haven't really described what I mean

1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:49.000
 by a neuron or a network in this particular hardware.

1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.640
 Yeah, do you wanna talk about loop neurons

1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.680
 and there's so many fascinating...

1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:55.960
 But you just have so many amazing papers

1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:57.720
 that people should definitely check out

1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:59.880
 and the titles alone are just killer.

1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:01.080
 So anyway, go ahead.

1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:03.680
 Right, so let me say big picture,

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:07.720
 based on optics, photonics for communication,

1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:10.120
 superconducting electronics for computation,

1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:11.520
 how does this all work?

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.520
 So a neuron in this hardware platform

1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:19.520
 can be thought of as circuits

1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:21.080
 that are based on Josephson junctions,

1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:22.680
 like we talked about before,

1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:25.320
 where every time a photon comes in...

1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:27.120
 So let's start by talking about a synapse.

1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:29.680
 A synapse receives a photon, one or more,

1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:31.400
 from a different neuron

1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:33.600
 and it converts that optical signal

1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:35.320
 to an electrical signal.

1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:38.920
 The amount of current that that adds to a loop

1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:40.840
 is controlled by the synaptic weight.

1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:42.360
 So as I said before,

1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.520
 you're popping fluxons into a loop, right?

1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:46.440
 So a photon comes in,

1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:49.200
 it hits a superconducting single photon detector,

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:52.120
 one photon, the absolute physical minimum

1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:53.040
 that you can communicate

1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:54.520
 from one place to another with light.

1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:56.120
 And that detector then converts that

1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:57.360
 into an electrical signal

1:43:57.360 --> 1:43:58.720
 and the amount of signal

1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:01.200
 is correlated with some kind of weight.

1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:02.940
 Yeah, so the synaptic weight will tell you

1:44:02.940 --> 1:44:05.440
 how many fluxons you pop into the loop.

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:06.560
 It's an analog number.

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.160
 We're doing analog computation now.

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.760
 Well, can you just linger on that?

1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:10.980
 What the heck is a fluxon?

1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:11.960
 Are we supposed to know this?

1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:14.220
 Or is this a funny,

1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:15.600
 is this like the big bang?

1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:18.840
 Is this a funny word for something deeply technical?

1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:21.040
 No, let's try to avoid using the word fluxon

1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:22.960
 because it's not actually necessary.

1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:24.360
 When a photon...

1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:25.440
 It's fun to say though.

1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:29.400
 So it's very necessary, I would say.

1:44:29.400 --> 1:44:30.360
 When a photon hits

1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:32.920
 that superconducting single photon detector,

1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:36.560
 current is added to a superconducting loop.

1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:39.200
 And the amount of current that you add

1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:40.340
 is an analog value,

1:44:40.340 --> 1:44:42.980
 can have eight bit equivalent resolution,

1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:44.240
 something like that.

1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:45.440
 10 bits, maybe.

1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:46.920
 That's amazing, by the way.

1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.480
 This is starting to make a lot more sense.

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:50.620
 When you're using superconductors for this,

1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.720
 the energy of that circulating current

1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:58.600
 is less than the energy of that photon.

1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:01.760
 So your energy budget is not destroyed

1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:04.000
 by doing this analog computation.

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:07.080
 So now in the language of a neuroscientist,

1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:09.180
 you would say that's your postsynaptic signal.

1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:11.680
 You have this current being stored in a loop.

1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:13.480
 You can decide what you wanna do with it.

1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:16.160
 Most likely you're gonna have it decay exponentially.

1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:18.280
 So every single synapse

1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:20.960
 is gonna have some given time constant.

1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.360
 And that's determined by putting some resistor

1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:27.040
 in that superconducting loop.

1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:31.120
 So a synapse event occurs when a photon strikes a detector,

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.880
 adds current to that loop, it decays over time.

1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:35.560
 That's the postsynaptic signal.

1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:38.440
 Then you can process that in a dendritic tree.

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:41.080
 Bryce Primavera and I have a paper

1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:43.420
 that we've submitted about that.

1:45:43.420 --> 1:45:45.380
 For the more neuroscience oriented people,

1:45:45.380 --> 1:45:47.080
 there's a lot of dendritic processing,

1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.440
 a lot of plasticity mechanisms you can implement

1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:51.480
 with essentially exactly the same circuits.

1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:54.460
 You have this one simple building block circuit

1:45:54.460 --> 1:45:57.240
 that you can use for a synapse, for a dendrite,

1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.320
 for the neuron cell body, for all the plasticity functions.

1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:02.360
 It's all based on the same building block,

1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:03.760
 just tweaking a couple parameters.

1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:05.040
 So this basic building block

1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:07.240
 has both an optical and an electrical component,

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:11.680
 and then you just build arbitrary large systems with that?

1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:13.520
 Close, you're not at fault

1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:15.000
 for thinking that that's what I meant.

1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:18.780
 What I should say is that if you want it to be a synapse,

1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:22.240
 you tack a superconducting detector onto the front of it.

1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:23.440
 And if you want it to be anything else,

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:25.280
 there's no optical component.

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.820
 Got it, so at the front,

1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:32.160
 optics in the front, electrical stuff in the back.

1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:34.120
 Electrical, yeah, in the processing

1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.480
 and in the output signal that it sends

1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:39.380
 to the next stage of processing further.

1:46:39.380 --> 1:46:41.480
 So the dendritic trees is electrical.

1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:42.500
 It's all electrical.

1:46:42.500 --> 1:46:44.880
 It's all electrical in the superconducting domain.

1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:48.560
 For anybody who's up on their superconducting circuits,

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.440
 it's just based on a DC squid, the most ubiquitous,

1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:55.160
 which is a circuit composed of two Joseph's injunctions.

1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:58.720
 So it's a very bread and butter kind of thing.

1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:00.900
 And then the only place where you go beyond that

1:47:00.900 --> 1:47:03.040
 is the neuron cell body itself.

1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:05.300
 It's receiving all these electrical inputs

1:47:05.300 --> 1:47:06.840
 from the synapses or dendrites

1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:09.840
 or however you've structured that particular unique neuron.

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:12.320
 And when it reaches its threshold,

1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:14.360
 which occurs by driving a Joseph's injunction

1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:15.760
 above its critical current,

1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:17.200
 it produces a pulse of current,

1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:19.460
 which starts an amplification sequence,

1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:21.380
 voltage amplification,

1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:24.480
 that produces light out of a transmitter.

1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:26.880
 So one of our colleagues, Adam McCann,

1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:27.960
 and Sonia Buckley as well,

1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:30.980
 did a lot of work on the light sources

1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:34.660
 and the amplifiers that drive the current

1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:37.560
 and produce sufficient voltage to drive current

1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:39.160
 through that now semiconducting part.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.160
 So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:45.620
 And that, so the neuron has reached threshold.

1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:47.640
 It produces a pulse of light.

1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:51.560
 That light then fans out across a network of wave guides

1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.520
 to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals

1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.320
 that perform this process themselves.

1:47:57.320 --> 1:47:59.880
 So it's probably worth explaining

1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:02.320
 what a network of wave guides is,

1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:04.780
 because a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that.

1:48:04.780 --> 1:48:07.120
 Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one.

1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:11.380
 But basically, light can be guided in a simple,

1:48:11.380 --> 1:48:14.880
 basically wire of usually an insulating material.

1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:18.280
 So silicon, silicon nitride,

1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:20.040
 different kinds of glass,

1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.440
 just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide.

1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:24.840
 That makes it a little bit big.

1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.160
 We wanna bring these down.

1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:28.040
 So we use different materials like silicon nitride,

1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:32.980
 but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material

1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:35.560
 that just goes and branches,

1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.980
 forms different branch points

1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:43.060
 that target different subregions of the network.

1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:45.000
 You can transition between layers of these.

1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.160
 So now we're talking about building in the third dimension,

1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:48.840
 which is absolutely crucial.

1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.720
 So that's what wave guides are.

1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:52.040
 Yeah, that's great.

1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:54.680
 Why the third dimension is crucial?

1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:56.640
 Okay, so yes, you were talking about

1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:58.760
 what are some of the technical limitations.

1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:04.280
 One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:08.800
 is that our brains are miraculously compact.

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:11.560
 For the number of neurons that are in our brain,

1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:13.520
 it sure does fit in a small volume,

1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:16.200
 as it would have to if we're gonna be biological organisms

1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:19.260
 that are resource limited and things like that.

1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:20.960
 Any kind of hardware neuron

1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:23.460
 is almost certainly gonna be much bigger than that

1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:26.480
 if it is of comparable complexity,

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:28.540
 whether it's based on silicon transistors.

1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:30.720
 Okay, a transistor, seven nanometers,

1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:33.760
 that doesn't mean a semiconductor based neuron

1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:34.680
 is seven nanometers.

1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:35.920
 They're big.

1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:38.780
 They require many transistors,

1:49:38.780 --> 1:49:40.640
 different other things like capacitors and things

1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:41.540
 that store charge.

1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:44.660
 They end up being on the order of 100 microns

1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:45.880
 by 100 microns,

1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:48.240
 and it's difficult to get them down any smaller than that.

1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:50.600
 The same is true for superconducting neurons,

1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.080
 and the same is true

1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:54.000
 if we're trying to use light for communication.

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.860
 Even if you're using electrons for communication,

1:49:56.860 --> 1:50:00.680
 you have these wires where, okay,

1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:03.360
 the size of an electron might be angstroms,

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:05.560
 but the size of a wire is not angstroms,

1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:07.160
 and if you try and make it narrower,

1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:08.520
 the resistance just goes up,

1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:10.760
 so you don't actually win.

1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:12.360
 To communicate over long distances,

1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:15.640
 you need your wires to be microns wide,

1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.160
 and it's the same thing for wave guides.

1:50:17.160 --> 1:50:18.920
 Wave guides are essentially limited

1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:20.280
 by the wavelength of light,

1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:21.920
 and that's gonna be about a micron,

1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:24.680
 so whereas compare that to an axon,

1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:26.760
 the analogous component in the brain,

1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:31.100
 which is 10 nanometers in diameter, something like that,

1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:33.680
 they're bigger when they need to communicate

1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:34.640
 over long distances,

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:37.960
 but grappling with the size of these structures

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.820
 is inevitable and crucial,

1:50:39.820 --> 1:50:44.820
 and so in order to make systems of comparable scale

1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.880
 to the human brain, by scale here,

1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:49.840
 I mean number of interconnected neurons,

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.760
 you absolutely have to be using

1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:53.640
 the third spatial dimension,

1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:55.960
 and that means on the wafer,

1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:57.360
 you need multiple layers

1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:59.600
 of both active and passive components.

1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:03.360
 Active, I mean superconducting electronic circuits

1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:05.360
 that are performing computations,

1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:07.400
 and passive, I mean these wave guides

1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:10.140
 that are routing the optical signals to different places,

1:51:10.140 --> 1:51:11.720
 you have to be able to stack those.

1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:14.720
 If you can get to something like 10 planes

1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.160
 of each of those, or maybe not even 10,

1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:18.840
 maybe five, six, something like that,

1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:19.760
 then you're in business.

1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:22.860
 Now you can get millions of neurons on a wafer,

1:51:22.860 --> 1:51:26.380
 but that's not anywhere close to the brain scale.

1:51:26.380 --> 1:51:27.960
 In order to get to the scale of the human brain,

1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:30.000
 you're gonna have to also use the third dimension

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.560
 in the sense that entire wafers

1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:34.160
 need to be stacked on top of each other

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:36.080
 with fiber optic communication between them,

1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:38.640
 and we need to be able to fill a space

1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:42.040
 the size of this table with stacked wafers,

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:44.280
 and that's when you can get to some 10 billion neurons

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:45.120
 like your human brain,

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.680
 and I don't think that's specific

1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:48.800
 to the optoelectronic approach that we're taking.

1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:51.400
 I think that applies to any hardware

1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:53.560
 where you're trying to reach commensurate scale

1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:55.000
 and complexity as the human brain.

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.520
 So you need that fractal stacking,

1:51:57.520 --> 1:51:59.360
 so stacking on the wafer,

1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:01.120
 and stacking of the wafers,

1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:03.840
 and then whatever the system that combines,

1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:06.360
 this stacking of the tables with the wafers.

1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:07.720
 And it has to be fractal all the way,

1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:08.600
 you're exactly right,

1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:10.060
 because that's the only way

1:52:10.060 --> 1:52:12.500
 that you can efficiently get information

1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:15.060
 from a small point to across that whole network.

1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:17.520
 It has to have the power law connected.

1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:20.640
 And photons are like optics throughout.

1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:21.480
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:23.680
 Once you're at this scale, to me it's just obvious.

1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:25.580
 Of course you're using light for communication.

1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:30.580
 You have fiber optics given to us from nature, so simple.

1:52:30.580 --> 1:52:32.860
 The thought of even trying to do

1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:34.740
 any kind of electrical communication

1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:37.140
 just doesn't make sense to me.

1:52:37.140 --> 1:52:39.260
 I'm not saying it's wrong, I don't know,

1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:40.980
 but that's where I'm coming from.

1:52:40.980 --> 1:52:43.860
 So let's return to loop neurons.

1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:46.460
 Why are they called loop neurons?

1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:48.900
 Yeah, the term loop neurons comes from the fact,

1:52:48.900 --> 1:52:49.980
 like we've been talking about,

1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:53.260
 that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops.

1:52:53.260 --> 1:52:57.420
 So even in a lot of forms of digital computing

1:52:57.420 --> 1:52:58.740
 with superconductors,

1:52:58.740 --> 1:53:02.540
 storing a signal in a superconducting loop

1:53:02.540 --> 1:53:05.060
 is a primary technique.

1:53:05.060 --> 1:53:06.660
 In this particular case,

1:53:06.660 --> 1:53:08.620
 it's just loops everywhere you look.

1:53:08.620 --> 1:53:11.620
 So the strength of a synaptic weight

1:53:11.620 --> 1:53:15.060
 is gonna be set by the amount of current circulating

1:53:15.060 --> 1:53:17.820
 in a loop that is coupled to the synapse.

1:53:17.820 --> 1:53:22.820
 So memory is implemented as current circulating

1:53:22.820 --> 1:53:24.140
 in a superconducting loop.

1:53:24.140 --> 1:53:27.140
 The coupling between, say, a synapse and a dendrite

1:53:27.140 --> 1:53:29.260
 or a synapse in the neuron cell body

1:53:29.260 --> 1:53:33.140
 occurs through loop coupling through transformers.

1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:34.820
 So current circulating in a synapse

1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:37.580
 is gonna induce current in a different loop,

1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:40.820
 a receiving loop in the neuron cell body.

1:53:40.820 --> 1:53:44.500
 So since all of the computation is happening

1:53:44.500 --> 1:53:46.660
 in these flux storage loops

1:53:46.660 --> 1:53:48.380
 and they play such a central role

1:53:48.380 --> 1:53:50.260
 in how the information is processed,

1:53:50.260 --> 1:53:52.820
 how memories are formed, all that stuff,

1:53:52.820 --> 1:53:53.980
 I didn't think too much about it,

1:53:53.980 --> 1:53:55.540
 I just called them loop neurons

1:53:55.540 --> 1:53:58.180
 because it rolls off the tongue a little bit better

1:53:58.180 --> 1:54:01.220
 than superconducting optoelectronic neurons.

1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:07.220
 Okay, so how do you design circuits for these loop neurons?

1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:09.740
 That's a great question.

1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:12.340
 There's a lot of different scales of design.

1:54:12.340 --> 1:54:16.340
 So at the level of just one synapse,

1:54:16.340 --> 1:54:18.980
 you can use conventional methods.

1:54:18.980 --> 1:54:21.100
 They're not that complicated

1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:23.220
 as far as superconducting electronics goes.

1:54:23.220 --> 1:54:27.100
 It's just four Joseph's injunctions or something like that

1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:29.180
 depending on how much complexity you wanna add.

1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:34.180
 So you can just directly simulate each component in SPICE.

1:54:34.940 --> 1:54:35.860
 What's SPICE?

1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:39.220
 It's Standard Electrical Simulation Software, basically.

1:54:39.220 --> 1:54:42.580
 So you're just explicitly solving the differential equations

1:54:42.580 --> 1:54:44.340
 that describe the circuit elements.

1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:46.220
 And then you can stack these things together

1:54:46.220 --> 1:54:48.860
 in that simulation software to then build circuits.

1:54:48.860 --> 1:54:51.580
 You can, but that becomes computationally expensive.

1:54:51.580 --> 1:54:54.100
 So one of the things when COVID hit,

1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:55.780
 we knew we had to turn some attention

1:54:55.780 --> 1:54:59.380
 to more things you can do at home in your basement

1:54:59.380 --> 1:55:02.700
 or whatever, and one of them was computational modeling.

1:55:02.700 --> 1:55:07.700
 So we started working on adapting,

1:55:07.780 --> 1:55:10.180
 abstracting out the circuit performance

1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:12.540
 so that you don't have to explicitly solve

1:55:12.540 --> 1:55:15.860
 the circuit equations, which for Joseph's injunctions

1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:18.460
 usually needs to be done on like a picosecond timescale

1:55:18.460 --> 1:55:21.220
 and you have a lot of nodes in your circuit.

1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:24.860
 So it results in a lot of differential equations

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.340
 that need to be solved simultaneously.

1:55:26.340 --> 1:55:29.420
 We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits

1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:33.740
 that is scalable up to networks of millions or so neurons

1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:36.620
 is sort of where we're targeting right now.

1:55:36.620 --> 1:55:40.820
 So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits.

1:55:40.820 --> 1:55:43.620
 And as I said, it's based on these simple building blocks.

1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:45.140
 So you really only need to understand

1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:46.340
 this one building block.

1:55:46.340 --> 1:55:48.980
 And if you get a good model of that, boom, it tiles.

1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:51.140
 And you can change the parameters in there

1:55:51.140 --> 1:55:52.860
 to get different behaviors and stuff,

1:55:52.860 --> 1:55:56.180
 but it's all based on now it's one differential equation

1:55:56.180 --> 1:55:57.140
 that you need to solve.

1:55:57.140 --> 1:56:00.780
 So one differential equation for every synapse,

1:56:00.780 --> 1:56:03.740
 dendrite or neuron in your system.

1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:05.340
 And for the neuroscientists out there,

1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:08.420
 it's just a simple leaky integrate and fire model,

1:56:08.420 --> 1:56:10.300
 leaky integrator, basically.

1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:11.860
 A synapse is a leaky integrator,

1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:13.460
 a dendrite is a leaky integrator.

1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:18.460
 So I'm really fascinated by how this one simple component

1:56:18.460 --> 1:56:22.180
 can be used to achieve lots of different types

1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:24.420
 of dynamical activity.

1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:27.500
 And to me, that's where scalability comes from.

1:56:27.500 --> 1:56:29.180
 And also complexity as well.

1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:30.860
 Complexity is often characterized

1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:35.420
 by relatively simple building blocks

1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:37.820
 connected in potentially simple

1:56:37.820 --> 1:56:39.340
 or sometimes complicated ways,

1:56:39.340 --> 1:56:41.940
 and then emergent new behavior that was hard to predict

1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:44.660
 from those simple elements.

1:56:44.660 --> 1:56:46.620
 And that's exactly what we're working with here.

1:56:46.620 --> 1:56:49.020
 So it's a very exciting platform,

1:56:49.020 --> 1:56:50.380
 both from a modeling perspective

1:56:50.380 --> 1:56:52.740
 and from a hardware manifestation perspective

1:56:52.740 --> 1:56:57.380
 where we can hopefully start to have this test bed

1:56:57.380 --> 1:56:58.860
 where we can explore things,

1:56:58.860 --> 1:57:00.820
 not just related to neuroscience,

1:57:00.820 --> 1:57:03.300
 but also related to other things

1:57:03.300 --> 1:57:07.140
 that connected to other physics like critical phenomenon,

1:57:07.140 --> 1:57:08.660
 Ising models, things like that.

1:57:08.660 --> 1:57:13.060
 So you were asking how we simulate these circuits.

1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:14.540
 It's at different levels

1:57:14.540 --> 1:57:18.300
 and we've got the simple spice circuit stuff.

1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:19.540
 That's no problem.

1:57:19.540 --> 1:57:21.740
 And now we're building these network models

1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:23.620
 based on this more efficient leaky integrator.

1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:26.220
 So we can actually reduce every element

1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:27.460
 to one differential equation.

1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:28.860
 And then we can also step through it

1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:30.700
 on a much coarser time grid.

1:57:30.700 --> 1:57:32.380
 So it ends up being something like a factor

1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:35.380
 of a thousand to 10,000 speed improvement,

1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:37.740
 which allows us to simulate,

1:57:37.740 --> 1:57:40.540
 but hopefully up to millions of neurons.

1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:44.660
 Whereas before we would have been limited to tens,

1:57:44.660 --> 1:57:45.780
 a hundred, something like that.

1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:48.780
 And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems

1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:49.860
 with a quantum computer.

1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:53.380
 So the goal here is to understand such systems.

1:57:53.380 --> 1:57:55.900
 For me, the goal is to study this

1:57:55.900 --> 1:57:58.940
 as a scientific physical system.

1:57:58.940 --> 1:58:01.940
 I'm not drawn towards turning this

1:58:01.940 --> 1:58:03.460
 into an enterprise at this point.

1:58:03.460 --> 1:58:05.820
 I feel short term applications

1:58:05.820 --> 1:58:07.460
 that obviously make a lot of money

1:58:07.460 --> 1:58:11.380
 is not necessarily a curiosity driver for you at the moment.

1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:12.220
 Absolutely not.

1:58:12.220 --> 1:58:14.020
 If you're interested in short term making money,

1:58:14.020 --> 1:58:16.500
 go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.

1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:20.900
 If you wanna understand things like the physics

1:58:20.900 --> 1:58:23.020
 of a fascinating system,

1:58:23.020 --> 1:58:25.620
 or if you wanna understand something more

1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:27.820
 along the lines of the physical limits

1:58:27.820 --> 1:58:29.460
 of what can be achieved,

1:58:29.460 --> 1:58:32.700
 then I think single photon communication,

1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:35.940
 superconducting electronics is extremely exciting.

1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:39.620
 What if I wanna use superconducting hardware

1:58:39.620 --> 1:58:42.020
 at four Kelvin to mine Bitcoin?

1:58:42.020 --> 1:58:43.260
 That's my main interest.

1:58:44.220 --> 1:58:45.860
 The reason I wanted to talk to you today,

1:58:45.860 --> 1:58:47.660
 I wanna say, no, I don't know.

1:58:47.660 --> 1:58:48.620
 What's Bitcoin?

1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:53.140
 Look it up on the internet.

1:58:53.140 --> 1:58:54.780
 Somebody told me about it.

1:58:54.780 --> 1:58:56.380
 I'm not sure exactly what it is.

1:58:57.500 --> 1:58:59.060
 But let me ask nevertheless

1:58:59.060 --> 1:59:01.380
 about applications to machine learning.

1:59:01.380 --> 1:59:06.380
 Okay, so if you look at the scale of five, 10, 20 years,

1:59:07.300 --> 1:59:11.900
 is it possible to, before we understand the nature

1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:14.420
 of human intelligence and general intelligence,

1:59:14.420 --> 1:59:19.100
 do you think we'll start falling out of this exploration

1:59:19.100 --> 1:59:23.100
 of neuromorphic systems ability to solve some

1:59:23.100 --> 1:59:25.180
 of the problems that the machine learning systems

1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:26.420
 of today can't solve?

1:59:26.420 --> 1:59:31.420
 Well, I'm really hesitant to over promise.

1:59:31.620 --> 1:59:34.100
 So I really don't know.

1:59:34.100 --> 1:59:36.740
 Also, I don't really understand machine learning

1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:37.580
 in a lot of senses.

1:59:37.580 --> 1:59:42.580
 I mean, machine learning from my perspective appears

1:59:42.900 --> 1:59:47.900
 to require that you know precisely what your input is

1:59:49.180 --> 1:59:51.700
 and also what your goal is.

1:59:51.700 --> 1:59:53.300
 You usually have some objective function

1:59:53.300 --> 1:59:54.140
 or something like that.

1:59:54.140 --> 1:59:57.300
 And that's very limiting.

1:59:57.300 --> 2:00:00.540
 I mean, of course, a lot of times that's the case.

2:00:00.540 --> 2:00:03.940
 There's a picture and there's a horse in it, so you're done.

2:00:03.940 --> 2:00:06.500
 But that's not a very interesting problem.

2:00:06.500 --> 2:00:09.500
 I think when I think about intelligence,

2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:13.200
 it's almost defined by the ability to handle problems

2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:15.940
 where you don't know what your inputs are going to be

2:00:15.940 --> 2:00:17.420
 and you don't even necessarily know

2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:18.580
 what you're trying to accomplish.

2:00:18.580 --> 2:00:21.620
 I mean, I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish

2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:22.540
 in this world.

2:00:22.540 --> 2:00:24.540
 Yeah, at all scales.

2:00:24.540 --> 2:00:25.900
 Yeah, at all scales, right.

2:00:25.900 --> 2:00:30.900
 I mean, so I'm more drawn to the underlying phenomena,

2:00:33.700 --> 2:00:37.940
 the critical dynamics of this system,

2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:41.900
 trying to understand how elements that you build

2:00:41.900 --> 2:00:46.900
 into your hardware result in emergent fascinating activity

2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:51.740
 that was very difficult to predict, things like that.

2:00:51.740 --> 2:00:53.660
 So, but I gotta be really careful

2:00:53.660 --> 2:00:55.580
 because I think a lot of other people who,

2:00:55.580 --> 2:00:57.700
 if they found themselves working on this project

2:00:57.700 --> 2:00:59.300
 in my shoes, they would say, all right,

2:00:59.300 --> 2:01:01.660
 what are all the different ways we can use this

2:01:01.660 --> 2:01:02.500
 for machine learning?

2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.340
 Actually, let me just definitely mention colleague

2:01:05.340 --> 2:01:06.660
 at NIST, Mike Schneider.

2:01:06.660 --> 2:01:09.340
 He's also very much interested,

2:01:09.340 --> 2:01:11.720
 particularly in the superconducting side of things,

2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:14.920
 using the incredible speed, power efficiency,

2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:16.620
 also Ken Seagal at Colgate,

2:01:16.620 --> 2:01:18.780
 other people working on specifically

2:01:18.780 --> 2:01:22.020
 the superconducting side of this for machine learning

2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:25.060
 and deep feed forward neural networks.

2:01:25.060 --> 2:01:27.400
 There, the advantages are obvious.

2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:28.780
 It's extremely fast.

2:01:28.780 --> 2:01:31.880
 Yeah, so that's less on the nature of intelligences

2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:35.740
 and more on various characteristics of this hardware

2:01:35.740 --> 2:01:38.340
 that you can use for the basic computation

2:01:38.340 --> 2:01:40.680
 as we know it today and communication.

2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:42.900
 One of the things that Mike Schneider's working on right now

2:01:42.900 --> 2:01:46.160
 is an image classifier at a relatively small scale.

2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:48.380
 I think he's targeting that nine pixel problem

2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:50.100
 where you can have three different characters

2:01:50.100 --> 2:01:54.240
 and you put in a nine pixel image

2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:58.420
 and you classify it as one of these three categories.

2:01:58.420 --> 2:02:00.160
 And that's gonna be really interesting

2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:01.260
 to see what happens there,

2:02:01.260 --> 2:02:05.720
 because if you can show that even at that scale,

2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:08.180
 you just put these images in and you get it out

2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:09.540
 and he thinks he can do it,

2:02:09.540 --> 2:02:11.180
 I forgot if it's a nanosecond

2:02:11.180 --> 2:02:14.040
 or some extremely fast classification time,

2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:14.880
 it's probably less,

2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.420
 it's probably a hundred picoseconds or something.

2:02:17.420 --> 2:02:18.820
 There you have challenges though,

2:02:18.820 --> 2:02:21.600
 because the Joseph's injunctions themselves,

2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:24.580
 the electronic circuit is extremely power efficient.

2:02:24.580 --> 2:02:26.880
 Some orders of magnitude for something more

2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:29.280
 than a transistor doing the same thing,

2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:31.480
 but when you have to cool it down to four Kelvin,

2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:33.900
 you pay a huge overhead just for keeping it cold,

2:02:33.900 --> 2:02:35.300
 even if it's not doing anything.

2:02:35.300 --> 2:02:40.300
 So it has to work at large scale

2:02:40.680 --> 2:02:43.720
 in order to overcome that power penalty,

2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:45.140
 but that's possible.

2:02:45.140 --> 2:02:48.000
 It's just, it's gonna have to get that performance.

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.720
 And this is sort of what you were asking about before

2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:52.760
 is like how much better than silicon would it need to be?

2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:54.120
 And the answer is, I don't know.

2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.220
 I think if it's just overall better than silicon

2:02:57.220 --> 2:03:00.200
 at a problem that a lot of people care about,

2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:02.640
 maybe it's image classification,

2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:03.960
 maybe it's facial recognition,

2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:07.520
 maybe it's monitoring credit transactions, I don't know,

2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:09.000
 then I think it will have a place.

2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:10.440
 It's not gonna be in your cell phone,

2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:12.200
 but it could be in your data center.

2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:16.160
 So what about in terms of the data center,

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:17.680
 I don't know if you're paying attention

2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:19.080
 to the various systems,

2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:23.880
 like Tesla recently announced DOJO,

2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:27.160
 which is a large scale machine learning training system,

2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:28.940
 that again, the bottleneck there

2:03:28.940 --> 2:03:30.900
 is probably going to be communication

2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:32.800
 between those systems.

2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:34.880
 Is there something from your work

2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:38.720
 on everything we've been talking about

2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:41.640
 in terms of superconductive hardware

2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:43.560
 that could be useful there?

2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:46.720
 Oh, I mean, okay, tomorrow, no.

2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:49.000
 In the long term, it could be the whole thing.

2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:49.840
 It could be nothing.

2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:52.120
 I don't know, but definitely, definitely.

2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:55.160
 When you look at the,

2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.720
 so I don't know that much about DOJO.

2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.840
 My understanding is that that's new, right?

2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:01.320
 That's just coming online.

2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:06.320
 Well, I don't even know where it hasn't come online.

2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:09.560
 And when you announce big, sexy,

2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:11.360
 so let me explain to you the way things work

2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:15.680
 in the world of business and marketing.

2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:18.400
 It's not always clear where you are

2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:20.560
 on the coming online part of that.

2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:22.680
 So I don't know where they are exactly,

2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:25.240
 but the vision is from a ground up

2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:28.520
 to build a very, very large scale,

2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:31.080
 modular machine learning, ASIC,

2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.640
 basically hardware that's optimized

2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:34.120
 for training neural networks.

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:36.080
 And of course, there's a lot of companies

2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:39.360
 that are small and big working on this kind of problem.

2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:42.680
 The question is how to do it in a modular way

2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:45.640
 that has very fast communication.

2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:49.520
 The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company

2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:54.520
 that at least at this time is so singularly focused

2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:57.720
 on solving a particular machine learning problem

2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:00.880
 and is making obviously a lot of money doing so

2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:02.200
 because the machine learning problem

2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:05.200
 happens to be involved with autonomous driving.

2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:09.760
 So you have a system that's driven by an application.

2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:14.760
 And that's really interesting because you have maybe Google

2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:17.720
 working on TPUs and so on.

2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:21.440
 You have all these other companies with ASICs.

2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:25.960
 They're usually more kind of always thinking general.

2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:29.160
 So I like it when it's driven by a particular application

2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:32.200
 because then you can really get to the,

2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:37.200
 it's somehow if you just talk broadly about intelligence,

2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:40.240
 you may not always get to the right solutions.

2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:41.560
 It's nice to couple that sometimes

2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:45.600
 with specific clear illustration

2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.640
 of something that requires general intelligence,

2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.880
 which for me driving is one such case.

2:05:49.880 --> 2:05:51.080
 I think you're exactly right.

2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:54.360
 Sometimes just having that focus on that application

2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:57.640
 brings a lot of people focuses their energy and attention.

2:05:57.640 --> 2:06:00.200
 I think that, so one of the things that's appealing

2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:02.440
 about what you're saying is not just

2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:03.840
 that the application is specific,

2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:06.040
 but also that the scale is big

2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:10.640
 and that the benefit is also huge.

2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:12.280
 Financial and to humanity.

2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:13.120
 Right, right, right.

2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:15.480
 Yeah, so I guess let me just try to understand

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.960
 is the point of this dojo system

2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:21.840
 to figure out the parameters

2:06:21.840 --> 2:06:23.840
 that then plug into neural networks

2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:26.520
 and then you don't need to retrain,

2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:29.080
 you just make copies of a certain chip

2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:32.320
 that has all the other parameters established or?

2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:36.760
 No, it's straight up retraining a large neural network

2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:38.560
 over and over and over.

2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:41.640
 So you have to do it once for every new car?

2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:44.800
 No, no, you have to, so they do this interesting process,

2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:47.000
 which I think is a process for machine learning,

2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.200
 supervised machine learning systems

2:06:49.200 --> 2:06:53.720
 you're going to have to do, which is you have a system,

2:06:53.720 --> 2:06:56.400
 you train your network once, it takes a long time.

2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:58.720
 I don't know how long, but maybe a week.

2:06:58.720 --> 2:06:59.760
 Okay. To train.

2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:05.080
 And then you deploy it on, let's say about a million cars.

2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:05.920
 I don't know what the number is.

2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:07.840
 But that part, you just write software

2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:10.680
 that updates some weights in a table and yeah, okay.

2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:12.640
 But there's a loop back.

2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:13.480
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:17.480
 Each of those cars run into trouble, rarely,

2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:23.720
 but they catch the edge cases

2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:26.080
 of the performance of that particular system

2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:28.320
 and then send that data back

2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:31.440
 and either automatically or by humans,

2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:34.760
 that weird edge case data is annotated

2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:37.560
 and then the network has to become smart enough

2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:40.120
 to now be able to perform in those edge cases,

2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.800
 so it has to get retrained.

2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:43.960
 There's clever ways of retraining different parts

2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:46.240
 of that network, but for the most part,

2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:49.280
 I think they prefer to retrain the entire thing.

2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:51.320
 So you have this giant monster

2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:54.880
 that kind of has to be retrained regularly.

2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:58.960
 I think the vision with Dojo is to have

2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:02.320
 a very large machine learning focused,

2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:05.200
 driving focused supercomputer

2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:07.600
 that then is sufficiently modular

2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:11.040
 that can be scaled to other machine learning applications.

2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:12.760
 So they're not limiting themselves completely

2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:14.000
 to this particular application,

2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:17.440
 but this application is the way they kind of test

2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:19.760
 this iterative process of machine learning

2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:23.440
 is you make a system that's very dumb,

2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:27.160
 deploy it, get the edge cases where it fails,

2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:30.000
 make it a little smarter, it becomes a little less dumb

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000
 and that iterative process achieves something

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.160
 that you can call intelligent or is smart enough

2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:37.960
 to be able to solve this particular application.

2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:42.960
 So it has to do with training neural networks fast

2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:45.920
 and training neural networks that are large.

2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:49.920
 But also based on an extraordinary amount of diverse input.

2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:50.760
 Data, yeah.

2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:51.920
 And that's one of the things,

2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:54.520
 so this does seem like one of those spaces

2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:58.920
 where the scale of superconducting optoelectronics,

2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.520
 the way that, so when you talk about the weaknesses,

2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:04.120
 like I said, okay, well, you have to cool it down.

2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:05.760
 At this scale, that's fine.

2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:09.440
 Because that's not too much of an added cost.

2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:10.960
 Most of your power is being dissipated

2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:12.920
 by the circuits themselves, not the cooling.

2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:17.920
 And also you have one centralized kind of cognitive hub,

2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:20.800
 if you will.

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:24.840
 And so if we're talking about putting

2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:28.640
 a superconducting system in a car, that's questionable.

2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:30.080
 Do you really wanna cryostat

2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.400
 in the trunk of everyone in your car?

2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:32.920
 It'll fit, it's not that big of a deal,

2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:35.720
 but hopefully there's a better way, right?

2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:39.080
 But since this is sort of a central supreme intelligence

2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.360
 or something like that,

2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:45.120
 and it needs to really have this massive data acquisition,

2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:47.080
 massive data integration,

2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:49.120
 I would think that that's where large scale

2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:51.280
 spiking neural networks with vast communication

2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:53.160
 and all these things would have something

2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:54.280
 pretty tremendous to offer.

2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:55.760
 It's not gonna happen tomorrow.

2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:58.280
 There's a lot of development that needs to be done.

2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:01.440
 But we have to be patient with self driving cars

2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:02.280
 for a lot of reasons.

2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:04.600
 We were all optimistic that they would be here by now.

2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:06.480
 And okay, they are to some extent,

2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:09.560
 but if we're thinking five or 10 years down the line,

2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:12.080
 it's not unreasonable.

2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:15.200
 One other thing, let me just mention,

2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:17.400
 getting into self driving cars and technologies

2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:19.680
 that are using AI out in the world,

2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:21.520
 this is something NIST cares a lot about.

2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:25.720
 Elham Tabassi is leading up a much larger effort in AI

2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:29.320
 at NIST than my little project.

2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:32.680
 And really central to that mission

2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:35.000
 is this concept of trustworthiness.

2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:38.920
 So when you're going to deploy this neural network

2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:43.320
 in every single automobile with so much on the line,

2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:45.240
 you have to be able to trust that.

2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:48.040
 So now how do we know that we can trust that?

2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:50.080
 How do we know that we can trust the self driving car

2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:53.720
 or the supercomputer that trained it?

2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:54.840
 There's a lot of work there

2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:56.960
 and there's a lot of that going on at NIST.

2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:58.200
 And it's still early days.

2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:01.840
 I mean, you're familiar with the problem and all that.

2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:04.480
 But there's a fascinating dance in engineering

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.680
 with safety critical systems.

2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:08.840
 There's a desire in computer science,

2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:10.640
 just recently talked to Don Knuth,

2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:14.800
 for algorithms and for systems,

2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:17.440
 for them to be provably correct or provably safe.

2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:20.320
 And this is one other difference

2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:22.320
 between humans and biological systems

2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:24.840
 is we're not provably anything.

2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:29.760
 And so there's some aspect of imperfection

2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:32.160
 that we need to have built in,

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:37.160
 like robustness to imperfection be part of our systems,

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:40.680
 which is a difficult thing for engineers to contend with.

2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:42.800
 They're very uncomfortable with the idea

2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:46.880
 that you have to be okay with failure

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:49.720
 and almost engineer failure into the system.

2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:50.960
 Mathematicians hate it too.

2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:53.640
 But I think it was Turing who said something

2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:55.040
 along the lines of,

2:11:55.040 --> 2:11:57.080
 I can give you an intelligent system

2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:59.520
 or I can give you a flawless system,

2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:00.880
 but I can't give you both.

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.120
 And it's in sort of creativity and abstract thinking

2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:07.840
 seem to rely somewhat on stochasticity

2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.320
 and not having components

2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:13.760
 that perform exactly the same way every time.

2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:16.000
 This is where like the disagreement I have with,

2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.560
 not disagreement, but a different view on the world.

2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:19.680
 I'm with Turing,

2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:24.600
 but when I talk to robotic, robot colleagues,

2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:26.440
 that sounds like I'm talking to robots,

2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.840
 colleagues that are roboticists,

2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:31.920
 the goal is perfection.

2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:33.960
 And to me is like, no,

2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:38.880
 I think the goal should be imperfection

2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:40.960
 that's communicated.

2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:44.160
 And through the interaction between humans and robots,

2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:49.160
 that imperfection becomes a feature, not a bug.

2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:52.160
 Like together, seen as a system,

2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:53.680
 the human and the robot together

2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:56.400
 are better than either of them individually,

2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:00.520
 but the robot itself is not perfect in any way.

2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:02.760
 Of course, there's a bunch of disagreements,

2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:04.920
 including with Mr. Elon about,

2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.640
 to me, autonomous driving is fundamentally

2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:10.760
 a human robot interaction problem,

2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.360
 not a robotics problem.

2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:14.320
 To Elon, it's a robotics problem.

2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:18.560
 That's actually an open and fascinating question,

2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:21.680
 whether humans can be removed from the loop completely.

2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:27.680
 We've talked about a lot of fascinating chemistry

2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:31.240
 and physics and engineering,

2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:33.680
 and we're always running up against this issue

2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:37.560
 that nature seems to dictate what's easy and what's hard.

2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.080
 So you have this cool little paper

2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:42.760
 that I'd love to just ask you about.

2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:44.520
 It's titled,

2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:48.200
 Does Cosmological Evolution Select for Technology?

2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:53.200
 So in physics, there's parameters

2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:56.200
 that seem to define the way our universe works,

2:13:56.200 --> 2:13:59.320
 that physics works, that if it worked any differently,

2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:01.720
 we would get a very different world.

2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:04.240
 So it seems like the parameters are very fine tuned

2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:06.480
 to the kind of physics that we see.

2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:08.560
 All the beautiful E equals MC squared,

2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.440
 they would get these nice, beautiful laws.

2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:13.160
 It seems like very fine tuned for that.

2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:15.960
 So what you argue in this article

2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:20.600
 is it may be that the universe has also fine tuned

2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:25.400
 its parameters that enable the kind of technological

2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:29.600
 innovation that we see, the technology that we see.

2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:31.520
 Can you explain this idea?

2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:33.440
 Yeah, I think you've introduced it nicely.

2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:38.440
 Let me just try to say a few things in my language layout.

2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:41.680
 What is this fine tuning problem?

2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:46.560
 So physicists have spent centuries trying to understand

2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:51.560
 the system of equations that govern the way nature behaves,

2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.120
 the way particles move and interact with each other.

2:14:55.120 --> 2:15:00.120
 And as that understanding has become more clear over time,

2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:05.120
 it became sort of evident that it's all well adjusted

2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:12.640
 to allow a universe like we see, very complex,

2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:16.480
 this large, long lived universe.

2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:19.920
 And so one answer to that is, well, of course it is

2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:21.520
 because we wouldn't be here otherwise.

2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:24.400
 But I don't know, that's not very satisfying.

2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:25.560
 That's sort of, that's what's known

2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:27.240
 as the weak anthropic principle.

2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:29.200
 It's a statement of selection bias.

2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:33.640
 We can only observe a universe that is fit for us to live in.

2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:34.960
 So what does it mean for a universe

2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.120
 to be fit for us to live in?

2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:38.400
 Well, the pursuit of physics,

2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:42.600
 it is based partially on coming up with equations

2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:44.640
 that describe how things behave

2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:46.280
 and interact with each other.

2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:48.480
 But in all those equations you have,

2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:49.960
 so there's the form of the equation,

2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:54.200
 sort of how different fields or particles

2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:56.480
 move in space and time.

2:15:56.480 --> 2:15:58.480
 But then there are also the parameters

2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:01.120
 that just tell you sort of the strength

2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:02.840
 of different couplings.

2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:05.160
 How strongly does a charged particle

2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:07.600
 couple to the electromagnetic field or masses?

2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:10.760
 How strongly does a particle couple

2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:12.960
 to the Higgs field or something like that?

2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:16.960
 And those parameters that define,

2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:19.760
 not the general structure of the equations,

2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:23.600
 but the relative importance of different terms,

2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:25.240
 they seem to be every bit as important

2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:27.760
 as the structure of the equations themselves.

2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:29.400
 And so I forget who it was.

2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:31.200
 Somebody, when they were working through this

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:34.000
 and trying to see, okay, if I adjust the parameter,

2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:34.840
 this parameter over here,

2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:36.800
 call it the, say the fine structure constant,

2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:37.920
 which tells us the strength

2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:40.400
 of the electromagnetic interaction.

2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.320
 Oh boy, I can't change it very much.

2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:43.720
 Otherwise nothing works.

2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:45.360
 The universe sort of doesn't,

2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:47.240
 it just pops into existence and goes away

2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:48.920
 in a nanosecond or something like that.

2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:51.040
 And somebody had the phrase,

2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:52.920
 this looks like a put up job,

2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:57.080
 meaning every one of these parameters was dialed in.

2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:00.680
 It's arguable how precisely they have to be dialed in,

2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:03.040
 but dialed in to some extent,

2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:05.360
 not just in order to enable our existence,

2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:07.120
 that's a very anthropocentric view,

2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:10.000
 but to enable a universe like this one.

2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.040
 So, okay, maybe I think the majority position

2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.000
 of working physicists in the field is,

2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:18.960
 it has to be that way in order for us to exist.

2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:20.400
 We're here, we shouldn't be surprised

2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:22.800
 that that's the way the universe is.

2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:24.520
 And I don't know, for a while,

2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:26.120
 that never sat well with me,

2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:28.040
 but I just kind of moved on

2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:29.440
 because there are things to do

2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:31.160
 and a lot of exciting work.

2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:33.760
 It doesn't depend on resolving this puzzle,

2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:38.760
 but as I started working more with technology,

2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:41.840
 getting into the more recent years of my career,

2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:43.720
 particularly when I started,

2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:46.520
 after having worked with silicon for a long time,

2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:49.000
 which was kind of eerie on its own,

2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:51.120
 but then when I switched over to superconductors,

2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:53.560
 I was just like, this is crazy.

2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:57.360
 It's just absolutely astonishing

2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.560
 that our universe gives us superconductivity.

2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:02.440
 It's one of the most beautiful physical phenomena

2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:06.560
 and it's also extraordinarily useful for technology.

2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:07.920
 So you can argue that the universe

2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:11.280
 has to have the parameters it does for us to exist

2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:13.000
 because we couldn't be here otherwise,

2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:14.760
 but why does it give us technology?

2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:18.840
 Why does it give us silicon that has this ideal oxide

2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:20.920
 that allows us to make a transistor

2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:23.640
 without trying that hard?

2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:26.760
 That can't be explained by the same anthropic reasoning.

2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.360
 Yeah, so it's asking the why question.

2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:34.680
 I mean, a slight natural extension of that question is,

2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:38.440
 I wonder if the parameters were different

2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:44.240
 if we would simply have just another set of paint brushes

2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:46.880
 to create totally other things

2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:49.240
 that wouldn't look like anything

2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:50.880
 like the technology of today,

2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:54.520
 but would nevertheless have incredible complexity,

2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:57.160
 which is if you sort of zoom out and start defining things,

2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:01.400
 not by like how many batteries it needs

2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:03.560
 and whether it can make toast,

2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:06.440
 but more like how much complexity is within the system

2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:07.280
 or something like that.

2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:10.000
 Well, yeah, you can start to quantify things.

2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:10.840
 You're exactly right.

2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:13.720
 So nowhere am I arguing that

2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:15.840
 in all of the vast parameter space

2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:18.000
 of everything that could conceivably exist

2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.640
 in the multiverse of nature,

2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:23.280
 there's this one point in parameter space

2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:25.160
 where complexity arises.

2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.640
 I doubt it.

2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:31.120
 That would be a shameful waste of resources, it seems.

2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:33.880
 But it might be that we reside

2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:35.640
 at one place in parameter space

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:40.040
 that has been adapted through an evolutionary process

2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:43.440
 to allow us to make certain technologies

2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:47.080
 that allow our particular kind of universe to arise

2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:49.760
 and sort of achieve the things it does.

2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:52.720
 See, I wonder if nature in this kind of discussion,

2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:55.720
 if nature is a catalyst for innovation

2:19:55.720 --> 2:19:57.680
 or if it's a ceiling for innovation.

2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:00.800
 So like, is it going to always limit us?

2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:04.000
 Like you're talking about silicon.

2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.640
 Is it just make it super easy to do awesome stuff

2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.000
 in a certain dimension,

2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.240
 but we could still do awesome stuff in other ways,

2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:11.560
 it'll just be harder?

2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:15.440
 Or does it really set like the maximum we can do?

2:20:15.440 --> 2:20:17.840
 That's a good thing to,

2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:19.400
 that's a good subject to discuss.

2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:20.960
 I guess I feel like we need to lay

2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:23.160
 a little bit more groundwork.

2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:24.760
 So I want to make sure that

2:20:27.560 --> 2:20:29.240
 I introduce this in the context

2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:31.800
 of Lee Smolin's previous idea.

2:20:31.800 --> 2:20:35.640
 So who's Lee Smolin and what kind of ideas does he have?

2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:39.000
 Okay, Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist

2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.440
 who back in the late 1980s published a paper

2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:45.040
 in the early 1990s introduced this idea

2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:47.000
 of cosmological natural selection,

2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:51.440
 which argues that the universe did evolve.

2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:54.480
 So his paper was called, did the universe evolve?

2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.480
 And I gave myself the liberty of titling my paper

2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.440
 does cosmological selection

2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:03.960
 or does cosmological evolution select for technology

2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:05.000
 in reference to that.

2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:08.200
 So he introduced that idea decades ago.

2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:12.200
 Now he primarily works on quantum gravity,

2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:14.640
 loop quantum gravity, other approaches to

2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:19.280
 unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity,

2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:22.360
 as you can read about in his most recent book, I believe,

2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:24.280
 and he's been on your show as well.

2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:27.760
 So, but I want to introduce this idea

2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:29.360
 of cosmological natural selection,

2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:32.640
 because I think that is one of the core ideas

2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:35.320
 that could change our understanding

2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:37.800
 of how the universe got here, our role in it,

2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:39.840
 what technology is doing here.

2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:41.240
 But there's a couple more pieces

2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:42.360
 that need to be set up first.

2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:46.320
 So the beginning of our universe is largely accepted

2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:47.360
 to be the big bang.

2:21:47.360 --> 2:21:49.920
 And what that means is if you look back in time

2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:52.640
 by looking far away in space,

2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:56.960
 you see that everything used to be at one point

2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:58.920
 and it expanded away from there.

2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:03.920
 There was an era in the evolutionary process of our universe

2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:05.520
 that was called inflation.

2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:08.880
 And this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guth

2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:13.120
 and others, Andre Linde and others in the 80s.

2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:16.040
 And this idea of inflation is basically that

2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:21.040
 when a singularity begins this process of growth,

2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:27.560
 there can be a temporary stage

2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:30.880
 where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly.

2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:33.760
 And based on quantum field theory,

2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:35.720
 this tells us that this should produce matter

2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:37.840
 in precisely the proportions that we find

2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:39.960
 of hydrogen and helium in the big bang,

2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:44.800
 lithium too, lithium also, and other things too.

2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:47.120
 So the predictions that come out of big bang

2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:50.720
 inflationary cosmology have stood up extremely well

2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:52.520
 to empirical verification,

2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:55.720
 the cosmic microwave background, things like this.

2:22:55.720 --> 2:22:59.520
 So most scientists working in the field

2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:03.720
 think that the origin of our universe is the big bang.

2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:08.040
 And I base all my thinking on that as well.

2:23:08.040 --> 2:23:11.440
 I'm just laying this out there so that people understand

2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:14.160
 that where I'm coming from is an extension,

2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:19.080
 not a replacement of existing well founded ideas.

2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:23.800
 In a paper, I believe it was 1986 with Alan Guth

2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:26.560
 and another author Farhi,

2:23:26.560 --> 2:23:30.240
 they wrote that a big bang,

2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:31.520
 I don't remember the exact quote,

2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:35.280
 a big bang is inextricably linked with a black hole.

2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:39.240
 The singularity that we call our origin

2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:42.000
 is mathematically indistinguishable from a black hole.

2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.360
 They're the same thing.

2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:48.880
 And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea,

2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:50.720
 I believe, I don't mean to speak for him,

2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:52.080
 but this is my reading of it.

2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:55.000
 So what Lee Smolin will say is that

2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:58.600
 a black hole in one universe is a big bang

2:23:58.600 --> 2:24:00.720
 in another universe.

2:24:00.720 --> 2:24:04.680
 And this allows us to have progeny, offspring.

2:24:04.680 --> 2:24:08.400
 So a universe can be said to have come

2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:10.480
 before another universe.

2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:14.200
 And very crucially, Smolin argues,

2:24:14.200 --> 2:24:16.920
 I think this is potentially one of the great ideas

2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:18.640
 of all time, that's my opinion,

2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:22.400
 that when a black hole forms, it's not a classical entity,

2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:24.520
 it's a quantum gravitational entity.

2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:27.240
 So it is subject to the fluctuations

2:24:27.240 --> 2:24:32.240
 that are inherent in quantum mechanics, the properties,

2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:35.440
 what we're calling the parameters

2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:38.600
 that describe the physics of that system

2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:40.680
 are subject to slight mutations

2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:42.600
 so that the offspring universe

2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:45.200
 does not have the exact same parameters

2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:48.440
 defining its physics as its parent universe.

2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:50.440
 They're close, but they're a little bit different.

2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:55.160
 And so now you have a mechanism for evolution,

2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:57.280
 for natural selection.

2:24:57.280 --> 2:24:59.680
 So there's mutation, so there's,

2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:03.280
 and then if you think about the DNA of the universe

2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:05.880
 are the basic parameters that govern its laws.

2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:10.880
 Exactly, so what Smolin said is our universe results

2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:14.520
 from an evolutionary process that can be traced back

2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.640
 some, he estimated, 200 million generations.

2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:20.640
 Initially, there was something like a vacuum fluctuation

2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:25.640
 that produced through random chance a universe

2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:27.280
 that was able to reproduce just one.

2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:28.640
 So now it had one offspring.

2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:30.960
 And then over time, it was able to make more and more

2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:35.280
 until it evolved into a highly structured universe

2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:40.160
 with a very long lifetime, with a great deal of complexity

2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:44.080
 and importantly, especially importantly for Lee Smolin,

2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:47.160
 stars, stars make black holes.

2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:49.720
 Therefore, we should expect our universe

2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:53.160
 to be optimized, have its physical parameters optimized

2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:55.600
 to make very large numbers of stars

2:25:55.600 --> 2:25:57.840
 because that's how you make black holes

2:25:57.840 --> 2:25:59.440
 and black holes make offspring.

2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:03.720
 So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved

2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:06.720
 to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring.

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:09.200
 And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that

2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:12.160
 is through stars that the biggest ones die

2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:13.440
 in these core collapse supernova

2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:15.720
 that make a black hole and a child.

2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:19.200
 Okay, first of all, I agree with you

2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:24.200
 that this is back to our fractal view of everything

2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:27.240
 from intelligence to our universe.

2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.120
 That is very compelling and a very powerful idea

2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:36.120
 that unites the origin of life

2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.760
 and perhaps the origin of ideas and intelligence.

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:42.200
 So from a Dawkins perspective here on earth,

2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:45.360
 the evolution of those and then the evolution

2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:49.640
 of the laws of physics that led to us.

2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:52.280
 I mean, it's beautiful.

2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:54.840
 And then you stacking on top of that,

2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:57.480
 that maybe we are one of the offspring.

2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:02.320
 Right, okay, so before getting into where I'd like

2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:05.160
 to take that idea, let me just a little bit more groundwork.

2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:07.080
 There is this concept of the multiverse

2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:08.600
 and it can be confusing.

2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:11.760
 Different people use the word multiverse in different ways.

2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:16.760
 In the multiverse that I think is relevant to picture

2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:20.840
 when trying to grasp Lee Smolin's idea,

2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:24.280
 essentially every vacuum fluctuation

2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:25.920
 can be referred to as a universe.

2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:28.840
 It occurs, it borrows energy from the vacuum

2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:30.200
 for some finite amount of time

2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:33.960
 and it evanesces back into the quantum vacuum.

2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:38.960
 And ideas of Guth before that and Andrei Linde

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:42.480
 with eternal inflation aren't that different

2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.480
 that you would expect nature

2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.920
 due to the quantum properties of the vacuum,

2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:49.480
 which we know exist, they're measurable

2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:52.200
 through things like the Casimir effect and others.

2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:54.200
 You know that there are these fluctuations

2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:55.120
 that are occurring.

2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:58.080
 What Smolin is arguing is that there is

2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:01.400
 this extensive multiverse, that this universe,

2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:04.520
 what we can measure and interact with

2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:07.040
 is not unique in nature.

2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:10.800
 It's just our residents, it's where we reside.

2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.640
 And there are countless, potentially infinity

2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:17.280
 other universes, other entire evolutionary trajectories

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:19.360
 that have evolved into things like

2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:21.000
 what you were mentioning a second ago

2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.080
 with different parameters and different ways

2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:26.000
 of achieving complexity and reproduction

2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:27.040
 and all that stuff.

2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:29.520
 So it's not that the evolutionary process

2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:34.240
 is a funnel towards this end point, not at all.

2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:37.000
 Just like the biological evolutionary process

2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.320
 that has occurred within our universe

2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:42.800
 is not a unique route toward achieving

2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:45.000
 one specific chosen kind of species.

2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.160
 No, we have extraordinary diversity around us.

2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:50.520
 That's what evolution does.

2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.200
 And for any one species like us,

2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:54.840
 you might feel like we're at the center of this process.

2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:57.160
 We're the destination of this process,

2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:59.480
 but we're just one of the many

2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:02.240
 nearly infinite branches of this process.

2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:04.240
 And I suspect it is exactly infinite.

2:29:04.240 --> 2:29:09.080
 I mean, I just can't understand how with this idea,

2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:11.040
 you can ever draw a boundary around it and say,

2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:13.480
 no, the universe, I mean, the multiverse

2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:17.720
 has 10 to the one quadrillion components,

2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:18.880
 but not infinity.

2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:20.200
 I don't know that.

2:29:20.200 --> 2:29:24.080
 Well, yeah, I have cognitively incapable

2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:25.680
 as I think all of us are

2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:29.080
 and truly understanding the concept of infinity.

2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:31.000
 And the concept of nothing as well.

2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.320
 And nothing, but also the concept of a lot

2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:35.360
 is pretty difficult.

2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:37.880
 I can just, I can count.

2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:39.920
 I run out of fingers at a certain point

2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:40.760
 and then you're screwed.

2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:41.760
 And when you're wearing shoes

2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:44.400
 and you can't even get down to your toes, it's like.

2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:47.040
 It's like, all right, a thousand fine, a million.

2:29:47.040 --> 2:29:48.040
 Is that what?

2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:50.040
 And then it gets crazier and crazier.

2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:50.880
 Right, right.

2:29:51.720 --> 2:29:54.840
 So this particular, so when we say technology, by the way,

2:29:55.720 --> 2:30:00.640
 I mean, there's some, not to over romanticize the thing,

2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:04.160
 but there is some aspect about this branch of ours

2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:08.040
 that allows us to, for the universe to know itself.

2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:08.960
 Yes, yes.

2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:13.960
 So to be, to have like little conscious cognitive fingers

2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:18.320
 that are able to feel like to scratch the head.

2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:19.640
 Right, right, right.

2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:22.040
 To be able to construct E equals MC squared

2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:25.640
 and to introspect, to start to gain some understanding

2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:27.400
 of the laws that govern it.

2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:32.000
 Isn't that, isn't that kind of amazing?

2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:35.600
 Okay, I'm just human, but it feels like that,

2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.200
 if I were to build a system that does this kind of thing,

2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:42.080
 that evolves laws of physics, that evolves life,

2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:45.440
 that evolves intelligence, that my goal would be

2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:48.960
 to come up with things that are able to think about itself.

2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:53.360
 Right, aren't we kind of close to the design specs,

2:30:53.360 --> 2:30:54.680
 the destination?

2:30:54.680 --> 2:30:56.040
 We're pretty close, I don't know.

2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:58.360
 I mean, I'm spending my career designing things

2:30:58.360 --> 2:30:59.800
 that I hope will think about themselves,

2:30:59.800 --> 2:31:02.680
 so you and I aren't too far apart on that one.

2:31:02.680 --> 2:31:05.520
 But then maybe that problem is a lot harder

2:31:05.520 --> 2:31:06.360
 than we imagine.

2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:07.800
 Maybe we need to.

2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:09.480
 Let's not get, let's not get too far

2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:12.040
 because I want to emphasize something that,

2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:14.600
 what you're saying is, isn't it fascinating

2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:16.880
 that the universe evolved something

2:31:16.880 --> 2:31:19.880
 that can be conscious, reflect on itself?

2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:23.760
 But Lee Smolin's idea didn't take us there, remember?

2:31:23.760 --> 2:31:25.720
 It took us to stars.

2:31:25.720 --> 2:31:29.160
 Lee Smolin has argued, I think,

2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:32.080
 right on almost every single way

2:31:32.080 --> 2:31:35.760
 that cosmological natural selection

2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:38.720
 could lead to a universe with rich structure.

2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:41.120
 And he argued that the structure,

2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:43.160
 the physics of our universe is designed

2:31:43.160 --> 2:31:46.080
 to make a lot of stars so that they can make black holes.

2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:48.200
 But that doesn't explain what we're doing here.

2:31:48.200 --> 2:31:51.320
 In order for that to be an explanation of us,

2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:55.360
 what you have to assume is that once you made that universe

2:31:55.360 --> 2:31:58.040
 that was capable of producing stars,

2:31:58.040 --> 2:32:00.280
 life, planets, all these other things,

2:32:00.280 --> 2:32:01.280
 we're along for the ride.

2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:02.160
 They got lucky.

2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:05.560
 We're kind of arising, growing up in the cracks,

2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:06.880
 but the universe isn't here for us.

2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:09.200
 We're still kind of a fluke in that picture.

2:32:09.200 --> 2:32:12.400
 And I can't, I don't necessarily have

2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:14.840
 like a philosophical opposition to that stance.

2:32:14.840 --> 2:32:19.840
 It's just not, okay, so I don't think it's complete.

2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:22.960
 So it seems like whatever we got going on here to you,

2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:25.640
 it seems like whatever we have here on earth

2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:28.440
 seems like a thing you might want to select for

2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:29.680
 in this whole big process.

2:32:29.680 --> 2:32:30.520
 Exactly.

2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:32.080
 So if what you are truly,

2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:34.840
 if your entire evolutionary process

2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:36.760
 only cares about fecundity,

2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:39.760
 it only cares about making offspring universes

2:32:39.760 --> 2:32:41.720
 because then there's gonna be the most of them

2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:45.120
 in that local region of hyperspace,

2:32:45.120 --> 2:32:49.320
 which is the set of all possible universes, let's say.

2:32:50.240 --> 2:32:52.800
 You don't care how those universes are made.

2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:54.840
 You know they have to be made by black holes.

2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:57.920
 This is what inflationary theory tells us.

2:32:57.920 --> 2:33:02.040
 The big bang tells us that black holes make universes.

2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:04.200
 But what if there was a technological means

2:33:04.200 --> 2:33:05.920
 to make universes?

2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:09.280
 Stars require a ton of matter

2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:11.640
 because they're not thinking very carefully

2:33:11.640 --> 2:33:12.800
 about how you make a black hole.

2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:15.000
 They're just using gravity, you know?

2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:19.160
 But if we devise technologies

2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:23.280
 that can efficiently compress matter into a singularity,

2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:26.200
 it turns out that if you can compress about 10 kilograms

2:33:26.200 --> 2:33:28.560
 into a very small volume,

2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:29.720
 that will make a black hole

2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:32.360
 that is likely highly probable to inflate

2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.720
 into its own offspring universe.

2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:37.080
 This is according to calculations done by other people

2:33:37.080 --> 2:33:38.720
 who are professional quantum theorists,

2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:40.160
 quantum field theorists,

2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:44.480
 and I hope I am grasping what they're telling me correctly.

2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:47.520
 I am somewhat of a translator here.

2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:50.400
 But so that's the position

2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:52.680
 that is particularly intriguing to me,

2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:56.240
 which is that what might have happened is that,

2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.120
 okay, this particular branch on the vast tree of evolution,

2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:03.200
 cosmological evolution that we're talking about,

2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:05.680
 not biological evolution within our universe,

2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:07.760
 but cosmological evolution,

2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:09.560
 went through exactly the process

2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:10.920
 that Elise Mullen described,

2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:15.800
 got to the stage where stars were making lots of black holes

2:34:15.800 --> 2:34:19.480
 but then continued to evolve and somehow bridged that gap

2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:22.040
 and made intelligence and intelligence

2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:24.080
 capable of devising technologies

2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:27.840
 because technologies, intelligent species

2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:29.640
 working in conjunction with technologies

2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:32.080
 could then produce even more.

2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:35.800
 Yeah, more efficiently, more faster and better

2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:36.840
 and more different.

2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:38.800
 Then you start to have different kind of mechanisms

2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:40.800
 and mutation perhaps, all that kind of stuff.

2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:43.080
 And so if you do a simple calculation that says,

2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:44.960
 all right, if I want to,

2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:49.960
 we know roughly how many core collapse supernovae

2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:54.440
 have resulted in black holes in our galaxy

2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:55.960
 since the beginning of the universe

2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:57.720
 and it's something like a billion.

2:34:57.720 --> 2:35:00.600
 So then you would have to estimate

2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:04.200
 that it would be possible for a technological civilization

2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:07.360
 to produce more than a billion black holes

2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:09.920
 with the energy and matter at their disposal.

2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:12.640
 And so one of the calculations in that paper,

2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:14.000
 back of the envelope,

2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.320
 but I think revealing nonetheless is that

2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:20.720
 if you take a relatively common asteroid,

2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:23.640
 something that's about a kilometer in diameter,

2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:26.680
 what I'm thinking of is just scrap material

2:35:26.680 --> 2:35:28.960
 laying around in our solar system

2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:31.360
 and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks

2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:33.320
 and turn each of those into a universe,

2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:38.080
 then you would have made at least a trillion black holes

2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:41.480
 outpacing the star production rate

2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:43.320
 by some three orders of magnitude.

2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:44.760
 That's one asteroid.

2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:46.840
 So now if you envision an intelligent species

2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:50.920
 that would potentially have been devised initially

2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:53.120
 by humans, but then based on superconducting

2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:55.160
 optoelectronic networks, no doubt,

2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:57.080
 and they go out and populate,

2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:58.920
 they don't have to fill the galaxy.

2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:01.640
 They just have to get out to the asteroid belt.

2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:05.240
 They could potentially dramatically outpace

2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:07.840
 the rate at which stars are producing offspring universes.

2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:10.600
 And then wouldn't you expect that

2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:13.080
 that's where we came from instead of a star?

2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:16.520
 Yeah, so you have to somehow become masters of gravity,

2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:17.360
 so like, or generate.

2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:18.680
 John, this is really gravity.

2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:20.600
 So stars make black holes with gravity,

2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:25.600
 but any force that can make the energy density

2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:28.320
 can compactify matter to produce

2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:31.120
 a great enough energy density can form a singularity.

2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:33.480
 It doesn't, it would not likely be gravity.

2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:34.480
 It's the weakest force.

2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:38.480
 You're more likely to use something like the technologies

2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:40.480
 that we're developing for fusion, for example.

2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:44.240
 So I don't know, the Large Ignition Facility

2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:49.240
 recently blasted a pellet with 100 really bright lasers

2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:53.360
 and caused that to get dense enough

2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:55.280
 to engage in nuclear fusion.

2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:56.560
 So something more like that,

2:36:56.560 --> 2:36:59.200
 or a tokamak with a really hot plasma, I'm not sure.

2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:02.160
 Something, I don't know exactly how it would be done.

2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:04.560
 I do like the idea of that,

2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:07.120
 especially just been reading a lot about gravitational waves

2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:10.600
 and the fact that us humans with our technological

2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:13.160
 capabilities, one of the most impressive

2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:17.360
 technological accomplishments of human history is LIGO,

2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:20.720
 being able to precisely detect gravitational waves.

2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.000
 I'm particularly find appealing the idea

2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:29.520
 that other alien civilizations from very far distances

2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:34.360
 communicate with gravity, with gravitational waves,

2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:37.800
 because as you become greater and greater master of gravity,

2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:40.600
 which seems way out of reach for us right now,

2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:44.280
 maybe that seems like a effective way of sending signals,

2:37:44.280 --> 2:37:48.440
 especially if your job is to manufacture black holes.

2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:49.280
 Right.

2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:51.840
 So that, so let me ask there,

2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:56.440
 whatever, I mean, broadly thinking,

2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:58.920
 because we tend to think other alien civilizations

2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:00.000
 would be very human like,

2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.080
 but if we think of alien civilizations out there

2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:06.640
 as basically generators of black holes,

2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:10.040
 however they do it, because they got stars,

2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:12.800
 do you think there's a lot of them

2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:15.760
 in our particular universe out there?

2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:19.200
 In our universe?

2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:23.400
 Well, okay, let me ask, okay, this is great.

2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:26.680
 Let me ask a very generic question

2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:29.200
 and then let's see how you answer it,

2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:34.120
 which is how many alien civilizations are out there?

2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:38.400
 If the hypothesis that I just described

2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:40.840
 is on the right track,

2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:43.880
 it would mean that the parameters of our universe

2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:48.480
 have been selected so that intelligent civilizations

2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:50.240
 will occur in sufficient numbers

2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:54.720
 so that if they reach something

2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:56.480
 like supreme technological maturity,

2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:00.080
 let's define that as the ability to produce black holes,

2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:02.640
 then that's not a highly improbable event.

2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:05.440
 It doesn't need to happen often

2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:06.680
 because as I just described,

2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:09.200
 if you get one of them in a galaxy,

2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:10.520
 you're gonna make more black holes

2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:12.720
 than the stars in that galaxy.

2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:16.560
 But there's also not a super strong motivation,

2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:21.560
 well, it's not obvious that you need them

2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:23.920
 to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.

2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:24.760
 Right.

2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:27.520
 One of the things that I try to emphasize in that paper

2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:30.640
 is that given this idea

2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.120
 of how our parameters might've been selected,

2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:39.280
 it's clear that it's a series of trade offs, right?

2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:42.040
 If you make, I mean, in order for intelligent life

2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:45.760
 of our variety or anything resembling us to occur,

2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:47.600
 you need a bunch of stuff, you need stars.

2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:51.080
 So that's right back to Smolin's roots of this idea,

2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:54.440
 but you also need water to have certain properties.

2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:58.760
 You need things like the rocky planets,

2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:00.600
 like the Earth to be within the habitable zone,

2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:02.680
 all these things that you start talking about

2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:06.760
 in the field of astrobiology,

2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:08.800
 trying to understand life in the universe,

2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:10.480
 but you can't over emphasize,

2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:13.600
 you can't tune the parameters so precisely

2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:15.160
 to maximize the number of stars

2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:18.960
 or to give water exactly the properties

2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:22.280
 or to make rocky planets like Earth the most numerous.

2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:24.480
 You have to compromise on all these things.

2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:27.360
 And so I think the way to test this idea

2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:30.240
 is to look at what parameters are necessary

2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:32.760
 for each of these different subsystems,

2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:35.080
 and I've laid out a few that I think are promising,

2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:36.640
 there could be countless others,

2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:40.840
 and see how changing the parameters

2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:43.600
 makes it more or less likely that stars would form

2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:46.320
 and have long lifetimes or that rocky planets

2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:48.280
 in the habitable zone are likely to form,

2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:49.400
 all these different things.

2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:53.360
 So we can test how much these things are in a tug of war

2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:56.280
 with each other, and the prediction would be

2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:58.160
 that we kind of sit at this central point

2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.040
 where if you move the parameters too much,

2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:05.680
 stars aren't stable, or life doesn't form,

2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:07.720
 or technology's infeasible,

2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:10.760
 because life alone, at least the kind of life

2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.160
 that we know of, cannot make black holes.

2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:16.400
 We don't have this, well, I'm speaking for myself,

2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:18.560
 you're a very fit and strong person,

2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:20.600
 but it might be possible for you,

2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:22.360
 but not for me to compress matter.

2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:25.960
 So we need these technologies, but we don't know,

2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:28.960
 we have not been able to quantify yet

2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:33.840
 how finely adjusted the parameters would need to be

2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:35.600
 in order for silicon to have the properties it does.

2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:37.840
 Okay, this is not directly speaking to what you're saying,

2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:39.520
 you're getting to the Fermi paradox,

2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:42.840
 which is where are they, where are the life forms out there,

2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:44.560
 how numerous are they, that sort of thing.

2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:46.200
 What I'm trying to argue is that

2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:50.800
 if this framework is on the right track,

2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:53.720
 a potentially correct explanation for our existence,

2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:56.320
 we, it doesn't necessarily predict

2:41:56.320 --> 2:41:59.280
 that intelligent civilizations are just everywhere,

2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:02.520
 because even if you just get one of them in a galaxy,

2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:05.760
 which is quite rare, it could be enough

2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:08.920
 to dramatically increase the fecundity

2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:10.160
 of the universe as a whole.

2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:12.440
 Yeah, and I wonder, once you start generating

2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:15.400
 the offspring for universes, black holes,

2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:18.360
 how that has effect on the,

2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:19.920
 what kind of effect does it have

2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:24.920
 on the other candidate's civilizations

2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:26.160
 within that universe?

2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:28.400
 Maybe it has a destructive aspect,

2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:29.840
 or there could be some arguments

2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:32.040
 about once you have a lot of offspring,

2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:34.040
 that that just quickly accelerates

2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:35.760
 to where the other ones can't even catch up.

2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:39.160
 It could, but I guess if you want me

2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:42.520
 to put my chips on the table or whatever,

2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:45.360
 I think I come down more on the side

2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:51.320
 that intelligent life civilizations are rare.

2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:57.160
 And I guess I follow Max Tegmark here.

2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:01.000
 And also there's a lot of papers coming out recently

2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:04.360
 in the field of astrobiology that are seeming to say,

2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.000
 all right, you just work through the numbers

2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:09.680
 on some modified Drake equation or something like that.

2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:13.040
 And it looks like it's not improbable.

2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:16.280
 You shouldn't be surprised that an intelligent species

2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:18.040
 has arisen in our galaxy,

2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:20.360
 but if you think there's one the next solar system over,

2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:21.600
 it's highly improbable.

2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:23.960
 So I can see that the number,

2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:28.280
 the probability of finding a civilization in a galaxy,

2:43:28.280 --> 2:43:31.080
 maybe it's most likely that you're gonna find

2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:32.880
 one to a hundred or something.

2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:34.960
 But okay, now it's really important

2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:36.720
 to put a time window on that, I think,

2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:40.720
 because does that mean in the entire lifetime of the galaxy

2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:45.720
 before it, so for in our case, before we run into Andromeda,

2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:52.960
 I think it's highly probable, I shouldn't say I think,

2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:56.760
 it's tempting to believe that it's highly probable

2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:00.000
 that in that entire lifetime of your galaxy,

2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.600
 you're gonna get at least one intelligent species,

2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:05.160
 maybe thousands or something like that.

2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:10.160
 But it's also, I think, a little bit naive to think

2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:13.200
 that they're going to coincide in time

2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:14.960
 and we'll be able to observe them.

2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:19.960
 And also, if you look at the span of life on Earth,

2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:24.480
 the Earth history, it was surprising to me

2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:27.880
 to kind of look at the amount of time,

2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:29.680
 first of all, the short amount of time,

2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:31.520
 there's no life, it's surprising.

2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:33.440
 Life sprang up pretty quickly.

2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:35.280
 It's single cell.

2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:36.960
 But that's the point I'm trying to make

2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.960
 is like so much of life on Earth

2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:45.840
 was just like single cell organisms, like most of it.

2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:48.640
 Most of it was like boring bacteria type of stuff.

2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:50.640
 Well, bacteria are fascinating, but I take your point.

2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:51.520
 No, I get it.

2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:52.880
 I mean, no offense to them.

2:44:52.880 --> 2:44:56.840
 But this kind of speaking from the perspective

2:44:56.840 --> 2:44:58.720
 of your paper of something that's able

2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:01.440
 to generate technology as we kind of understand it,

2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:03.400
 that's a very short moment in time

2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:08.400
 relative to that full history of life on Earth.

2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:12.200
 And maybe our universe is just saturated

2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:15.880
 with bacteria like humans.

2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:17.480
 Right.

2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:22.480
 But not the special extra AGI super humans,

2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:25.560
 that those are very rare.

2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:30.400
 And once those spring up, everything just goes to like,

2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:33.360
 it accelerates very quickly.

2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:36.520
 Yeah, we just don't have enough data to really say,

2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:40.000
 but I find this whole subject extremely engaging.

2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:41.680
 I mean, there's this concept,

2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:43.880
 I think it's called the Rare Earth Hypothesis,

2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:46.920
 which is that basically stating that,

2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:49.040
 okay, microbes were here right away

2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:52.120
 after the Hadian era where we were being bombarded.

2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:54.920
 Well, after, yeah, bombarded by comets, asteroids,

2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:57.080
 things like that, and also after the moon formed.

2:45:57.080 --> 2:45:59.560
 So once things settled down a little bit,

2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:02.280
 in a few hundred million years,

2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:03.680
 you have microbes everywhere.

2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:05.200
 And it could have been, we don't know exactly

2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:08.080
 when it could have been remarkably brief that that took.

2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:10.200
 So it does indicate that, okay,

2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:12.160
 life forms relatively easily.

2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:15.920
 I think that alone is sort of a checker on the scale

2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:20.920
 for the argument that the parameters that allow

2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:24.360
 even microbial life to form are not just a fluke.

2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:27.520
 But anyway, that aside, yes,

2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:29.880
 then there was this long dormant period,

2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:31.600
 not dormant, things were happening,

2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:34.120
 but important things were happening

2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:37.320
 for some two and a half billion years or something

2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:40.160
 after the metabolic process

2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:42.840
 that releases oxygen was developed.

2:46:42.840 --> 2:46:46.120
 Then basically the planet's just sitting there,

2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:47.560
 getting more and more oxygenated,

2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:50.200
 more and more oxygenated until it's enough

2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:54.160
 that you can build these large, complex organisms.

2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:56.480
 And so the Rare Earth Hypothesis would argue

2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:01.000
 that the microbes are common everywhere

2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:04.160
 in any planet that's roughly in the habitable zone

2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:06.640
 and has some water on it, it's probably gonna have those.

2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:09.320
 But then getting to this Cambrian explosion

2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:13.760
 that happened some between 500 and 600 million years ago,

2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:16.360
 that's rare, you know?

2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:19.080
 And I buy that, I think that is rare.

2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:21.880
 So if you say how much life is in our galaxy,

2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:24.120
 I think that's probably the right answer

2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:26.440
 is that microbes are everywhere.

2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:29.360
 Cambrian explosion is extremely rare.

2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:32.760
 And then, but the Cambrian explosion kind of went like that

2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:37.760
 where within a couple of tens or a hundred million years,

2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:40.960
 all of these body plans came into existence.

2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:43.120
 And basically all of the body plans

2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:46.080
 that are now in existence on the planet

2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:48.720
 were formed in that brief window

2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:51.640
 and we've just been shuffling around since then.

2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:54.840
 So then what caused humans to pop out of that?

2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:59.840
 I mean, that could be another extremely rare threshold

2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:06.200
 that a planet roughly in the habitable zone with water

2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:08.400
 is not guaranteed to cross, you know?

2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:10.200
 To me, it's fascinating for being humble,

2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:13.080
 like the humans cannot possibly be the most amazing thing

2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.880
 that such, if you look at the entirety of the system

2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:17.800
 that Lee Smolin and you paint,

2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:20.080
 that cannot possibly be the most amazing thing

2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:21.480
 that process generates.

2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:23.720
 So like, if you look at the evolution,

2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:27.040
 what's the equivalent in the cosmological evolution

2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:29.000
 and its selection for technology,

2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.440
 the equivalent of the human eye or the human brain?

2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:35.600
 Universes that are able to do some like,

2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:37.760
 they don't need the damn stars.

2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:42.120
 They're able to just do some incredible generation

2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:46.640
 of complexity fast, like much more than,

2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:47.520
 if you think about it,

2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:50.920
 it's like most of our universe is pretty freaking boring.

2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:53.400
 There's not much going on, there's a few rocks flying around

2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:54.520
 and there's some like apes

2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.520
 that are just like doing podcasts on some weird planet.

2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:02.840
 It just seems very inefficient.

2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:05.960
 If you think about like the amazing thing in the human eye,

2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.440
 the visual cortex can do, the brain, the nervous,

2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:12.840
 everything that makes us more powerful

2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:15.480
 than single cell organisms.

2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:19.320
 Like if there's an equivalent of that for universes,

2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:21.680
 like the richness of physics

2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:24.640
 that could be expressed

2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:26.840
 through a particular set of parameters.

2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:31.040
 Like, I mean, like for me,

2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:33.760
 I'm a sort of from a computer science perspective,

2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:35.600
 huge fan of cellular automata,

2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:39.320
 which is a nice sort of pretty visual way

2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:42.160
 to illustrate how different laws

2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:46.400
 can result in drastically different levels of complexity.

2:49:46.400 --> 2:49:49.000
 So like, it's like, yeah, okay.

2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.320
 So we're all like celebrating,

2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:52.120
 look, our little cellular automata

2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.560
 is able to generate pretty triangles and squares

2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:57.600
 and therefore we achieve general intelligence.

2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:01.840
 And then there'll be like some badass Chuck Norris type,

2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.560
 like universal Turing machine type of cellular automata.

2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:09.560
 They're able to generate other cellular automata

2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:13.120
 that does any arbitrary level of computation off the bat.

2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:16.480
 Like those have to then exist.

2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:19.840
 And then we're just like, we'll be forgotten.

2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:23.800
 This story, this podcast just entertains

2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:26.880
 a few other apes for a few months.

2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:30.240
 Well, I'm kind of surprised to hear your cynicism.

2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:32.080
 No, I'm very up.

2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:36.120
 I usually think of you as like one who celebrates humanity

2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:37.600
 and all its forms and things like that.

2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:39.240
 And I guess I just, I don't,

2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:41.000
 I see it the way you just described.

2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.520
 I mean, okay, we've been here for 13.7 billion years

2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:47.240
 and you're saying, gosh, that's a long time.

2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:48.480
 Let's get on with the show already.

2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:51.520
 Some other universe could have kicked our butt by now,

2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:55.360
 but that's putting a characteristic time.

2:50:55.360 --> 2:50:58.400
 I mean, why is 13.7 billion a long time?

2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:00.440
 I mean, compared to what?

2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:02.320
 I guess, so when I look at our universe,

2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:05.400
 I see this extraordinary hierarchy

2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:08.080
 that has developed over that time.

2:51:08.080 --> 2:51:13.080
 So at the beginning, it was a chaotic mess of some plasma

2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:16.080
 and nothing interesting going on there.

2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:18.880
 And even for the first stars to form,

2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:23.880
 that a lot of really interesting evolutionary processes

2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:26.240
 had to occur, by evolutionary in that sense,

2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:30.520
 I just mean taking place over extended periods of time

2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:32.000
 and structures are forming then.

2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.640
 And then it took that first generation of stars

2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:37.480
 in order to produce the metals

2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:41.280
 that then can more efficiently produce

2:51:41.280 --> 2:51:42.440
 another generation of stars.

2:51:42.440 --> 2:51:44.720
 We're only the third generation of stars.

2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:47.920
 So we might still be pretty quick to the game here.

2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:51.000
 So, but I don't think, I don't, okay.

2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:52.440
 So then you have these stars

2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:54.640
 and then you have solar systems on those solar systems.

2:51:54.640 --> 2:51:58.840
 You have rocky worlds, you have gas giants,

2:51:58.840 --> 2:51:59.800
 like all this complexity.

2:51:59.800 --> 2:52:01.120
 And then you start getting life

2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.800
 and the complexity that's evolved

2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:06.440
 through the evolutionary process in life forms

2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:09.880
 is just, it's not a let down to me.

2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:10.720
 Just seeing that.

2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:14.600
 Some of it is like some of the planets is like icy,

2:52:14.600 --> 2:52:16.080
 it's like different flavors of ice cream.

2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:18.560
 They're icy, but there might be water underneath.

2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:21.120
 All kinds of life forms with some volcanoes,

2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:22.320
 all kinds of weird stuff.

2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:24.600
 No, no, I don't, I think it's beautiful.

2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:25.960
 I think our life is beautiful.

2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:29.560
 And I think it was designed that by design,

2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:31.200
 the scarcity of the whole thing.

2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:33.840
 I think mortality, as terrifying as it is,

2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:37.280
 is fundamental to the whole reason we enjoy everything.

2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:38.200
 No, I think it's beautiful.

2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:42.400
 I just think that all of us conscious beings

2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:45.520
 in the grand scheme of basically every scale

2:52:45.520 --> 2:52:46.960
 will be completely forgotten.

2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:47.800
 Well, that's true.

2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:49.320
 I think everything is transient

2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:52.520
 and that would go back to maybe something more like Lao Tzu,

2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:55.440
 the Tao Te Ching or something where it's like,

2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:57.720
 yes, there is nothing but change.

2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:00.720
 There is nothing but emergence and dissolve and that's it.

2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:03.000
 But I just, in this picture,

2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:04.520
 this hierarchy that's developed,

2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:06.600
 I don't mean to say that now it gets to us

2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:07.440
 and that's the pinnacle.

2:53:07.440 --> 2:53:10.520
 In fact, I think at a high level,

2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:14.240
 the story I'm trying to tease out in my research is about,

2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:17.000
 okay, well, so then what's the next level of hierarchy?

2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:21.520
 And if it's, okay, we're kind of pretty smart.

2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:23.840
 I mean, talking about people like Lee Small

2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:26.240
 and Alan Guth, Max Tegmark, okay, we're really smart.

2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:28.480
 Talking about me, okay, we're kind of,

2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:30.760
 we can find our way to the grocery store or whatever,

2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:33.000
 but what's next?

2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:36.120
 I mean, what if there's another level of hierarchy

2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:37.760
 that grows on top of us

2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:40.280
 that is even more profoundly capable?

2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:42.080
 And I mean, we've talked a lot

2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:43.560
 about superconducting sensors.

2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:48.560
 Imagine these cognitive systems far more capable than us

2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:52.320
 residing somewhere else in the solar system

2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:53.640
 off of the surface of the earth,

2:53:53.640 --> 2:53:55.400
 where it's much darker, much colder,

2:53:55.400 --> 2:53:57.080
 much more naturally suited to them.

2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:00.440
 And they have these sensors that can detect single photons

2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:04.560
 of light from radio waves out to all across the spectrum

2:54:04.560 --> 2:54:07.400
 of the gamma rays and just see the whole universe.

2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:08.960
 And they just live in space

2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:12.960
 with these massive collection optics so that they,

2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:13.800
 what do they do?

2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:18.800
 They just look out and experience that vast array

2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:22.520
 of what's being developed.

2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:24.240
 And if you're such a system,

2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:28.920
 presumably you would do some things for fun.

2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:31.720
 And the kind of fun thing I would do

2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:33.840
 as somebody who likes video games

2:54:33.840 --> 2:54:37.040
 is I would create and maintain

2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:39.340
 and observe something like earth.

2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:47.320
 So in some sense, we're like all what players on a stage

2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:52.320
 for this superconducting cold computing system out there.

2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:56.680
 I mean, all of this is fascinating to think.

2:54:56.680 --> 2:54:59.360
 The fact that you're actually designing systems

2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:01.560
 here on earth that are trying to push this technological

2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:04.800
 at the very cutting edge and also thinking about

2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:09.760
 how does the like the evolution of physical laws

2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:14.240
 lead us to the way we are is fascinating.

2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:15.920
 That coupling is fascinating.

2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:20.800
 It's like the ultimate rigorous application of philosophy

2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:23.680
 to the rigorous application of engineering.

2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:26.400
 So Jeff, you're one of the most fascinating.

2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:29.000
 I'm so glad I did not know much about you

2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:30.440
 except through your work.

2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:34.200
 And I'm so glad we got this chance to talk.

2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:37.800
 You're one of the best explainers

2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:39.820
 of exceptionally difficult concepts.

2:55:40.940 --> 2:55:44.600
 And you're also, speaking of like fractal,

2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:46.680
 you're able to function intellectually

2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:50.240
 at all levels of the stack, which I deeply appreciate.

2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:51.640
 This was really fun.

2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:53.600
 You're a great educator, a great scientist.

2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:56.080
 It's an honor that you would spend

2:55:56.080 --> 2:55:57.280
 your valuable time with me.

2:55:57.280 --> 2:56:00.120
 It's an honor that you would spend your time with me as well.

2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:01.760
 Thanks, Jeff.

2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.560
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:05.240
 with Jeff Schoenlein.

2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:06.680
 To support this podcast,

2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:09.580
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:56:09.580 --> 2:56:12.060
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:56:12.060 --> 2:56:14.320
 from the great John Carmack,

2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:17.300
 who surely will be a guest on this podcast soon.

2:56:18.220 --> 2:56:20.100
 Because of the nature of Moore's Law,

2:56:20.100 --> 2:56:22.800
 anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer

2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:26.040
 can do at one point can be replicated

2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:27.920
 by a merely competent programmer

2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:30.520
 some number of years later.

2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:59.520
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
