00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
 The following is a conversation with Catherine Duclir, a professor of Planetary Science and

00:04.640 --> 00:06.760
 Astronomy at Caltech.

00:06.760 --> 00:12.600
 Her research is on the surface environments, atmospheres, and thermochemical histories

00:12.600 --> 00:16.080
 of the planets and moons in our solar system.

00:16.080 --> 00:22.840
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Fundrise, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Magic Spoon.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.880
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:25.880 --> 00:30.960
 As a side note, let me say that this conversation and a few others, quite big ones actually,

00:30.960 --> 00:35.360
 that are coming up were filmed in a studio where I was trying to outsource some of the

00:35.360 --> 00:36.360
 work.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.920
 Like all experiments, it was a learning experience for me.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.840
 It had some positives and negatives.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.680
 Ultimately, I decided to return back to doing it the way I was doing before, but hopefully

00:44.680 --> 00:49.560
 with a team who can help me out and work with me long term.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.560
 The point is, I will always keep challenging myself, trying stuff out, learning, growing,

00:54.560 --> 00:56.640
 and hopefully improving over time.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.600
 My goal is to surround myself with people who love what they do, are amazing at it,

01:01.600 --> 01:04.960
 and are obsessed with doing the best work of their lives.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.080
 To me, there's nothing more energizing and fun than that.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.680
 In fact, I'm currently hiring a few folks to work with me on various small projects.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.560
 If this is something of interest to you, go to lexfreedman.com slash hiring.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.680
 That's where I will always post opportunities for working with me.

01:21.680 --> 01:28.000
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Catherine DeClear.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.120
 Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?

01:30.120 --> 01:36.440
 Does this upset you or has justice finally been served?

01:36.440 --> 01:38.320
 So I get asked this all the time.

01:38.320 --> 01:43.440
 I think all planetary scientists get asked about Pluto, especially by kids who, we just

01:43.440 --> 01:46.400
 love for Pluto to still be a planet.

01:46.400 --> 01:53.640
 But the reality is, when we first discovered Pluto, it was a unique object in the outer

01:53.640 --> 01:54.640
 solar system.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.040
 And we thought we were adding a planet to the inventory of planets that we had.

01:59.040 --> 02:04.980
 And then over time, it became clear that Pluto was not a unique, large object in the outer

02:04.980 --> 02:08.960
 solar system, that there were actually many of these.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.600
 And as we started discovering more and more of them, we realized that the concept of Pluto

02:12.600 --> 02:18.960
 being a planet didn't make sense unless maybe we added all the rest of them as planets.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.240
 So you could have imagined actually a different direction that this could have gone where

02:22.240 --> 02:26.800
 all the other objects that were discovered in that belt, or at least all the ones, let's

02:26.800 --> 02:33.400
 say, above a certain size, became planets instead of Pluto being declassified.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.920
 But we're now aware of many objects out there in the outer solar system and what's called

02:37.920 --> 02:44.640
 the Kuiper Belt that are of the same size or in some cases even larger than Pluto.

02:44.640 --> 02:50.480
 So the declassification was really just a realization that it was not in the same category

02:50.480 --> 02:52.640
 as the other planets in the solar system.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.420
 And we basically needed to refine our definition in such a way that took into account that

02:57.420 --> 03:03.120
 there's this belt of debris out there in the outer solar system of things with a range

03:03.120 --> 03:05.080
 of sizes.

03:05.080 --> 03:10.840
 Is there a hope for clear categorization of what is a planet and not, or is it all just

03:10.840 --> 03:11.900
 gray area?

03:11.900 --> 03:18.080
 When you study planets, when you study moons, satellites of those planets, is there lines

03:18.080 --> 03:20.960
 that could be cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess?

03:20.960 --> 03:27.120
 Is it all like a fluid, let's say not mess, but it's like fluid of what is a planet, what

03:27.120 --> 03:32.600
 is a moon of a planet, what is debris, what is asteroids, all that kind of...

03:32.600 --> 03:38.440
 So there are technically clear definitions that were set down by the IAU, the International

03:38.440 --> 03:41.640
 Astronomy Union.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.640
 Is it size related?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.440
 Like what are the parameters based on?

03:44.440 --> 03:49.560
 So the parameters are that it has to orbit the sun, which was essentially to rule out

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
 satellites.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.880
 Of course, this was a not very forward thinking definition because it technically means that

03:53.880 --> 03:58.020
 all extrasolar planets according to that definition are not planets.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.340
 So it has to orbit the sun.

04:00.340 --> 04:05.760
 It has to be large enough that its gravity has caused it to become spherical in shape,

04:05.760 --> 04:08.280
 which also applies to satellites and also applies to Pluto.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.680
 The third part of the definition is the thing that really rules out everything else, which

04:11.680 --> 04:15.860
 is that it has to have cleared out its orbital path.

04:15.860 --> 04:21.560
 And because Pluto orbits in a belt of material, it doesn't satisfy that stipulation.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.840
 Why didn't you clear out the path?

04:22.840 --> 04:26.560
 It's not big enough to knock everybody out of the way.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.060
 And this actually is not the first time it has happened.

04:29.060 --> 04:33.440
 So Ceres, when it was discovered, Ceres is the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt,

04:33.440 --> 04:36.760
 and it was originally considered a planet when it was first discovered.

04:36.760 --> 04:42.920
 And it went through exactly the same story, history, where people actually realized that

04:42.920 --> 04:47.180
 it was just one of many asteroids in the asteroid belt region, and then it got declassified

04:47.180 --> 04:50.160
 to an asteroid, and now it's back to a dwarf planet.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.100
 So there is a lot of reclassification.

04:52.100 --> 04:59.840
 So to me, as somebody who studies solar system objects, I just personally don't care.

04:59.840 --> 05:04.460
 My level of interest in something has nothing to do with what it's classified as.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.420
 So my favorite objects in the solar system are all moons, and frequently when I talk

05:08.420 --> 05:12.400
 about them, I refer to them as planets because to me they are planets.

05:12.400 --> 05:17.080
 They have volcanoes, they have geology, they have atmospheres, they're planet like worlds.

05:17.080 --> 05:22.540
 And so the distinction is not super meaningful to me, but it is important just for having

05:22.540 --> 05:28.260
 a general framework for understanding and talking about things to have a precise definition.

05:28.260 --> 05:34.340
 So you don't have a special romantic appreciation of a moon versus a planet versus an asteroid.

05:34.340 --> 05:38.260
 It's just an object that flies out there and it doesn't really matter what the categorization

05:38.260 --> 05:39.260
 is.

05:39.260 --> 05:45.300
 Because there's movies about asteroids and stuff, and then there's movies about the moon,

05:45.300 --> 05:48.780
 whatever, it's a really good movie.

05:48.780 --> 05:55.580
 There's something about moons that's almost like an outlier.

05:55.580 --> 06:03.980
 You think of a moon as a thing that's the secret part, and the planet is the more vanilla

06:03.980 --> 06:04.980
 regular part.

06:04.980 --> 06:05.980
 None of that?

06:05.980 --> 06:06.980
 You don't have any of that?

06:06.980 --> 06:07.980
 No, I actually do.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.220
 I really, satellites are, the moons are my favorite things in the solar system.

06:11.220 --> 06:17.340
 I think part of what you're saying, I agree from maybe a slightly different perspective,

06:17.340 --> 06:22.460
 which is from the perspective of exploration, we've spent a lot of time sending spacecraft

06:22.460 --> 06:23.740
 missions to planets.

06:23.740 --> 06:27.260
 We had a mission to Jupiter, we had a mission to Saturn, we have plenty of missions to Mars

06:27.260 --> 06:28.500
 and missions to Venus.

06:28.500 --> 06:33.220
 I think the exploration of the moons in the outer solar system is the next frontier of

06:33.220 --> 06:35.580
 solar system exploration.

06:35.580 --> 06:39.400
 The belt of debris, just real quick, that's out there.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.140
 Is there something incredible to be discovered there?

06:42.140 --> 06:47.500
 Again, we tend to focus on the planets and the moons, but it feels like there's probably

06:47.500 --> 06:51.880
 a lot of stuff out there and it probably, what is it?

06:51.880 --> 06:56.860
 It's like a garbage collector from outside of the solar system, isn't it?

06:56.860 --> 07:02.060
 Like, doesn't it protect from other objects that kind of fly in and what, it just feels

07:02.060 --> 07:08.500
 like it's a cool, you know when you like walk along the beach and look for stuff and like

07:08.500 --> 07:13.820
 look for, it feels like that's that kind of place where you can find cool weird things.

07:13.820 --> 07:20.580
 Or I guess in our conversation today, when we think about tools and what science is studying,

07:20.580 --> 07:24.140
 is there something to be studied out there or we just don't have maybe the tools yet

07:24.140 --> 07:26.860
 or there's nothing to be found?

07:26.860 --> 07:28.340
 There's absolutely a lot to be found.

07:28.340 --> 07:32.500
 So the material that's out there is remnant material from the formation of our solar system.

07:32.500 --> 07:38.660
 We don't think it comes from outside the solar system, at least not most of it.

07:38.660 --> 07:44.740
 But there are so many fascinating objects out there and I think what you fit on is exactly

07:44.740 --> 07:48.780
 right that we just don't have the tools to study them in detail.

07:48.780 --> 07:53.100
 But we can look out there and we can see there are different species of ice on their surface

07:53.100 --> 07:58.100
 that tells us about, you know, the chemical composition of the disk that formed our solar

07:58.100 --> 07:59.100
 system.

07:59.100 --> 08:03.060
 Some of these objects are way brighter than they should be, meaning they have some kind

08:03.060 --> 08:04.340
 of geological activity.

08:04.340 --> 08:08.040
 People have hypothesized that some of these objects have subsurface oceans.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.460
 You could even stretch your imagination and say some of those oceans could be habitable.

08:12.460 --> 08:16.980
 But we can't get very detailed information about them because they're so far away.

08:16.980 --> 08:21.500
 And so I think if any of those objects were in the inner solar system, it would be studied

08:21.500 --> 08:24.060
 intently and would be very interesting.

08:24.060 --> 08:30.100
 So would you be able to design a probe in that like very dense debris field, be able

08:30.100 --> 08:32.780
 to like hop from one place to another?

08:32.780 --> 08:37.980
 Is that just outside of the realm of like how would you even design devices or sensors

08:37.980 --> 08:42.260
 that go out there and take pictures and land?

08:42.260 --> 08:47.200
 Do you have to land to truly understand a little piece of rock or can you understand

08:47.200 --> 08:52.580
 it from remotely, like fly up close and remotely observe?

08:52.580 --> 08:56.780
 You can learn quite a lot from just a flyby and that's all we're currently capable of

08:56.780 --> 08:58.540
 doing in the outer solar system.

08:58.540 --> 09:05.300
 The New Horizons mission is a recent example which flew by Pluto and then they had searched

09:05.300 --> 09:10.260
 for another object that was out there in the Kuiper Belt, any object that was basically

09:10.260 --> 09:13.900
 somewhere that they could deflect their trajectory to actually fly by.

09:13.900 --> 09:18.500
 And so they did fly by another object out there in the Kuiper Belt and they take pictures

09:18.500 --> 09:19.860
 and they do what they can do.

09:19.860 --> 09:25.220
 And if you've seen the images from that mission of Pluto, you can see just how much detail

09:25.220 --> 09:29.060
 we have compared to just the sort of reddish dot that we knew of before.

09:29.060 --> 09:33.980
 So you do get an amazing amount of information actually from just essentially a high speed

09:33.980 --> 09:34.980
 flyby.

09:34.980 --> 09:41.260
 It always makes me sad to think about flybys that we might be able to, we might fly by

09:41.260 --> 09:46.020
 a piece of rock, take a picture and think, oh, that looks pretty and cool and whatever.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.820
 And that you could study certain like composition of the surface and so on.

09:49.820 --> 09:55.780
 But it's actually teeming with life and we won't be able to see it at first.

09:55.780 --> 09:56.780
 And it's sad.

09:56.780 --> 10:00.300
 Cause you know, like when you're on a deserted island and you wave your hands and the thing

10:00.300 --> 10:05.460
 flies by and you're trying to get their attention and they probably do the same, well in their

10:05.460 --> 10:07.820
 own way, bacteria probably, right?

10:07.820 --> 10:10.100
 But and we miss it.

10:10.100 --> 10:16.380
 I don't know, some reason it makes me, it's the FOMO, it's fear of missing out.

10:16.380 --> 10:23.060
 It makes me sad that there might be life out there and we don't, we're not in touch with

10:23.060 --> 10:24.060
 it.

10:24.060 --> 10:25.060
 We're not talking.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.060
 Yeah.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.060
 Well, okay.

10:27.060 --> 10:32.540
 A sad pause, a Russian philosophical pause.

10:32.540 --> 10:33.540
 Okay.

10:33.540 --> 10:36.900
 What are the tools available to us to study planets and their moons?

10:36.900 --> 10:38.660
 Oh my goodness.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.520
 That is such a big question.

10:41.520 --> 10:47.620
 So among the field of astronomy, so planetary science broadly speaking, well, it falls kind

10:47.620 --> 10:53.860
 of at the border of astronomy, geology, climate science, chemistry, and even biology.

10:53.860 --> 10:57.820
 So it's kind of on the border of many things, but part of it falls under the heading of

10:57.820 --> 10:58.820
 astronomy.

10:58.820 --> 11:04.560
 And among the things that you can study with telescopes, like solar system moons and planets,

11:04.560 --> 11:09.660
 the solar system is really unique in that we can actually send spacecraft missions to

11:09.660 --> 11:11.540
 the objects and study them in detail.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.580
 And so I think that's, that's the kind of type of tool that is, that people are most

11:15.580 --> 11:22.420
 aware of, that's most popularized, these amazing NASA missions that either you fly by the object,

11:22.420 --> 11:27.620
 you orbit the object, you land on the object, potentially you can talk about digging into

11:27.620 --> 11:35.060
 it, drilling, trying to detect tectonic tremors on its surface.

11:35.060 --> 11:42.140
 The types of tools that I use are primarily telescopes and so I, my background is in astrophysics

11:42.140 --> 11:47.700
 and so I actually got into solar system science from astronomy, not from, you know, a childhood

11:47.700 --> 11:52.300
 fascination with spacecraft missions, which is actually what a lot of planetary scientists

11:52.300 --> 11:56.400
 became planetary scientists because of childhood fascination with spacecraft missions, which

11:56.400 --> 12:00.500
 is kind of interesting for me to talk to people and see that trajectory.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.460
 I kind of came at it from the fascination with telescopes angle.

12:03.460 --> 12:08.540
 So you like telescopes, not rockets, or at least when I was a kid it was looking at the

12:08.540 --> 12:14.180
 stars and playing with telescopes that really fascinated me and that's how I got into this.

12:14.180 --> 12:21.260
 But telescopes, it's amazing how much detail and how much information you can get from

12:21.260 --> 12:22.700
 telescopes today.

12:22.700 --> 12:29.860
 You can resolve individual cloud features and watch them kind of sheer out in the atmosphere

12:29.860 --> 12:30.860
 of Titan.

12:30.860 --> 12:38.620
 You can literally watch volcanoes on Io change from day to day as the lava flows expand.

12:38.620 --> 12:43.460
 So and then, you know, spectroscopy, you get compositional information on all these things

12:43.460 --> 12:51.100
 and it's, when I started doing solar system astronomy, I was surprised by how much detail

12:51.100 --> 12:55.740
 and how much information you can get even from Earth and then as well as from orbit

12:55.740 --> 12:59.580
 like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb.

12:59.580 --> 13:06.420
 So with the telescope, you can, I mean, how much information can you get about volcanoes,

13:06.420 --> 13:13.720
 about storms, about sort of weather, just so we kind of get a sense, like what a resolution

13:13.720 --> 13:15.460
 we're talking about?

13:15.460 --> 13:20.020
 Well, in terms of resolution, so at a, you know, on a given night, if I go and take a

13:20.020 --> 13:26.420
 picture of Io and its volcanoes, you can sometimes see at least a dozen different volcanoes.

13:26.420 --> 13:30.180
 You can see the infrared emission coming off of them and resolve them, separate them from

13:30.180 --> 13:36.300
 one another on the surface and actually watch how the heat coming off of them changes with

13:36.300 --> 13:37.300
 time.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.740
 And I think this time variability aspect is one of the big advantages we get from telescopes.

13:41.740 --> 13:45.860
 So you send a spacecraft mission there and you get an incredible amount of information

13:45.860 --> 13:47.580
 over a very short time period.

13:47.580 --> 13:53.480
 But for some science questions, you need to observe something for 30 years, 40 years.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.780
 Like let's say you want to look at the moon Titan, which has one of the most interesting

13:57.780 --> 14:00.540
 atmospheres in the solar system.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.620
 Its orbital period is 29, 30 years.

14:04.620 --> 14:09.700
 And so if you want to look at how its atmospheric seasons work, you have to observe it over

14:09.700 --> 14:11.300
 that long of a time period.

14:11.300 --> 14:15.420
 And you're not going to do that with a spacecraft, but you can do it with telescopes.

14:15.420 --> 14:20.100
 Can we just zoom in on certain things like, let's talk about Io, which is the moon of

14:20.100 --> 14:21.100
 Jupiter.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.100
 Right.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.100
 Okay.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.100
 It's so big.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.380
 There's like volcanoes all over the place.

14:27.380 --> 14:30.260
 It's from a distance.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.260
 It's awesome.

14:31.260 --> 14:37.700
 So can you tell me about this moon and you're sort of a scholar of many planets and moons,

14:37.700 --> 14:40.140
 but that one kind of stood out to me.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.340
 So why is that an interesting one?

14:42.340 --> 14:47.620
 For so many reasons, but Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.500
 It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it.

14:50.500 --> 14:56.140
 It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers up above its surface.

14:56.140 --> 15:03.180
 It puts out more volume of magma per volcano than volcanoes on Earth today.

15:03.180 --> 15:10.160
 But I think to me, the reason that it's most interesting is as a laboratory for understanding

15:10.160 --> 15:12.780
 planetary processes.

15:12.780 --> 15:18.700
 So one of the broad goals of planetary science is to put together a sort of more general

15:18.700 --> 15:24.580
 and coherent framework for how planets work in general.

15:24.580 --> 15:27.660
 Our current framework, you know, it started out very Earth centric.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.540
 We start to understand how Earth volcanoes work.

15:30.540 --> 15:35.140
 But then when you try to transport that to somewhere like Io that doesn't have an atmosphere,

15:35.140 --> 15:41.540
 which has a very tenuous atmosphere, which makes a big difference for how the magma degasses,

15:41.540 --> 15:44.940
 for something that's really small, for something that has a different heat source, for something

15:44.940 --> 15:49.140
 that's embedded in another object's magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have from

15:49.140 --> 15:50.220
 Earth doesn't apply.

15:50.220 --> 15:56.540
 And so broadly, planetary science is trying to broaden that framework so that you have

15:56.540 --> 16:01.260
 a kind of narrative that you can understand how each planet became different from every

16:01.260 --> 16:02.700
 other planet.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.060
 And I'm already making a mistake.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.300
 When I say planet, I mean planets and moons.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.340
 Like I said, I see the moons as planets.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.340
 As planets.

16:09.340 --> 16:10.340
 Yeah.

16:10.340 --> 16:14.620
 I actually already noticed that you didn't introduce Io as the moon of Jupiter.

16:14.620 --> 16:19.300
 You completely, you kind of ignored the fact that Jupiter exists.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.900
 It's like, let's focus on this.

16:21.900 --> 16:22.900
 Yeah.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.900
 Okay.

16:23.900 --> 16:28.780
 So, and you also didn't mention Europa, which I think is the, is that the most famous moon

16:28.780 --> 16:29.780
 of Jupiter?

16:29.780 --> 16:33.660
 Is that the one gets attention because it might have life?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.660
 Exactly.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.660
 Yeah.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.980
 But to you, Io is also beautiful.

16:37.980 --> 16:41.900
 What's the difference between volcanoes on Io versus Earth?

16:41.900 --> 16:44.980
 You said atmosphere makes a difference.

16:44.980 --> 16:48.500
 What the heat source plays a big role.

16:48.500 --> 16:55.860
 So many of the moons in the outer solar system are heated from gravitationally by tidal heating.

16:55.860 --> 17:00.540
 And I'm happy to describe what that is or, yeah, please, what's tidal?

17:00.540 --> 17:01.540
 Yes.

17:01.540 --> 17:07.740
 So tidal heating is, it's, if you want to understand and contextualize planets and moons,

17:07.740 --> 17:10.660
 you have to understand their heat sources.

17:10.660 --> 17:16.580
 So for Earth, we have radioactive decay in our interior as well as residual heat of formation.

17:16.580 --> 17:21.300
 But for satellites, tidal heating plays a really significant role and in particular

17:21.300 --> 17:27.380
 in driving geological activity on satellites and potentially making those subsurface oceans

17:27.380 --> 17:31.040
 in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable.

17:31.040 --> 17:37.500
 And so the way that that works is if you have multiple moons and their orbital periods are

17:37.500 --> 17:42.380
 integer multiples of one another, that means that they're always encountering each other

17:42.380 --> 17:46.420
 at the same point in the orbit.

17:46.420 --> 17:50.220
 So if they were on just random orbits, they'd be encountering each other at random places

17:50.220 --> 17:55.020
 and the gravitational effect between the two moons would be canceling out over time.

17:55.020 --> 18:00.160
 But because they're always meeting each other at the same point in the orbit, those gravitational

18:00.160 --> 18:02.860
 interactions add up coherently.

18:02.860 --> 18:06.100
 And so that tweaks them into eccentric orbits.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.020
 What's an eccentric orbit?

18:08.020 --> 18:12.980
 So eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit, it just means noncircular, so a deviation from

18:12.980 --> 18:13.980
 a circular orbit.

18:13.980 --> 18:19.180
 And that means that for Io or Europa, at some points in their orbit, they're closer to Jupiter

18:19.180 --> 18:22.340
 and at some points in their orbit, they're farther away.

18:22.340 --> 18:29.580
 And so when they're closer, they're stretched out in a sense, but literally just not very

18:29.580 --> 18:32.240
 stretched out, like a couple hundred meters, something like that.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.220
 And then when they're farthest away, they're less stretched out.

18:35.220 --> 18:40.140
 And so you actually have the shape of the object deforming over the course of the orbit.

18:40.140 --> 18:42.620
 And these orbits are like just a couple of days.

18:42.620 --> 18:49.300
 And so that, in the case of Io, that is literally sufficient friction in its mantle to melt

18:49.300 --> 18:50.900
 the rock of its mantle.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.840
 And that's what generates the magma.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.660
 That's the source of the magma.

18:54.660 --> 18:55.660
 Yeah.

18:55.660 --> 18:56.660
 Okay.

18:56.660 --> 19:03.200
 So why is, so Europa is, I thought there was like ice and oceans underneath kind of thing.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.380
 So why is Europa not getting the friction?

19:05.380 --> 19:07.820
 It is, it's just a little bit farther away from Jupiter.

19:07.820 --> 19:10.740
 And then Ganymede is also in the orbital resonance.

19:10.740 --> 19:14.900
 So it's a three object orbital resonance in the Jupiter system.

19:14.900 --> 19:20.700
 But we have these sorts of orbital resonances all over the solar system and also in exoplanets.

19:20.700 --> 19:25.620
 So for Europa, basically because it's farther from Jupiter, the effect is not as extreme,

19:25.620 --> 19:29.500
 but you do still have heat generated in its interior in this way.

19:29.500 --> 19:34.940
 And that may be driving, could be driving hydrothermal activity at the base of its ocean,

19:34.940 --> 19:38.780
 which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life.

19:38.780 --> 19:39.780
 Cool.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.100
 So it's like heating up the ocean a little bit.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.620
 Heating up the ocean a little bit.

19:43.620 --> 19:48.580
 And specifically in these like hydrothermal vents where we see really interesting life

19:48.580 --> 19:51.060
 evolve in the bottom of Earth's oceans.

19:51.060 --> 19:52.060
 That's cool.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.060
 Okay.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.440
 So what's Io, what else?

19:55.440 --> 19:59.740
 So we know the source is this friction, but there's no atmosphere.

19:59.740 --> 20:05.740
 I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like if you and I were to visit Io, like what would

20:05.740 --> 20:06.740
 that look like?

20:06.740 --> 20:08.780
 What would it feel like?

20:08.780 --> 20:15.560
 Is this the entire thing covered in basically volcanoes?

20:15.560 --> 20:18.660
 So it's interesting because there's very little atmosphere.

20:18.660 --> 20:23.300
 The surface is actually really cold, very far below freezing on the surface when you're

20:23.300 --> 20:28.980
 away from a volcano, but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees or the magma when

20:28.980 --> 20:30.740
 it comes out is over a thousand degrees.

20:30.740 --> 20:31.740
 And so.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.820
 But it does come to the surface, the magma?

20:33.820 --> 20:34.820
 It does.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.820
 Yeah.

20:35.820 --> 20:36.820
 In particular places.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.160
 Whoa, that probably looks beautiful.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.540
 So like, so it's frozen, not ice.

20:42.540 --> 20:46.380
 Like what is, is rock, it's really cold rock.

20:46.380 --> 20:51.340
 And then you just have this like, what is, what does that look, what would that look

20:51.340 --> 20:53.480
 like with no atmosphere?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.700
 Would that, uh, would it be smoke?

20:55.700 --> 20:58.620
 What does it look like?

20:58.620 --> 21:03.420
 It's just magma, like just red, yellow, like liquidy things?

21:03.420 --> 21:06.500
 It's black, it's black and red, I guess.

21:06.500 --> 21:10.440
 Like think of the type of magma that you see in Hawaii.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.260
 So different types of magma flow in different ways, for example.

21:13.260 --> 21:19.740
 So in somewhere like Io, the magma is really hot and so it will flow out in sheets because

21:19.740 --> 21:23.620
 it has really low viscosity.

21:23.620 --> 21:27.580
 And I think the lava flows that we've been having in Hawaii over the past couple of years

21:27.580 --> 21:35.020
 are probably a decent analogy, although Io's magma's lavas are even more fluid and faster

21:35.020 --> 21:36.020
 moving.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.020
 How faster?

21:37.020 --> 21:41.580
 Like what, uh, how fat, like if you, uh, by the way, sorry, through the telescope, are

21:41.580 --> 21:43.620
 you tracking at what timescale?

21:43.620 --> 21:47.580
 Like every frame is how far apart?

21:47.580 --> 21:50.820
 If you're looking through a telescope, are we talking about seconds or we're talking

21:50.820 --> 21:56.500
 about days, months, when you kind of track, try to get a picture of what the surface might

21:56.500 --> 21:59.660
 look like, what's the frequency?

21:59.660 --> 22:03.020
 So it depends a little bit on what you want to do.

22:03.020 --> 22:09.240
 I, ideally every night, um, but you could take a frame every second and see how things

22:09.240 --> 22:10.240
 are changing.

22:10.240 --> 22:16.300
 The, the problem with that is that for things to change on a one second timescale, you to

22:16.300 --> 22:19.820
 actually see something change that fast, you have to have super high resolution.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.460
 The spatial resolution we have is a couple of hundred kilometers.

22:22.460 --> 22:28.260
 And so things are not changing on those scales over one second, unless you have something

22:28.260 --> 22:29.900
 really crazy happening.

22:29.900 --> 22:36.100
 So if you get, if you get a telescope closer to Io, if you get a, or a camera closer to

22:36.100 --> 22:39.940
 Io, would you be able to understand something?

22:39.940 --> 22:41.860
 Is that something of interest to you?

22:41.860 --> 22:46.300
 Would you be able to understand something deeper about these volcanic eruptions and

22:46.300 --> 22:52.920
 how magma flows and just the, like the rate of the magma is, or is it basically enough

22:52.920 --> 22:55.100
 to have the kilometer resolution?

22:55.100 --> 22:56.100
 Do you get it?

22:56.100 --> 22:57.100
 No way.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.100
 We want to go there.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.100
 Absolutely.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.100
 You want to go, you want to go to Io?

23:00.100 --> 23:02.660
 I mean, I don't want to go there personally, but I want to send a spacecraft mission there.

23:02.660 --> 23:03.660
 Absolutely.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.660
 Why?

23:04.660 --> 23:05.660
 Why are you scared?

23:05.660 --> 23:06.660
 Why am I scared?

23:06.660 --> 23:11.540
 Oh, you mean you don't like, I don't want to go there as a human as a human.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.580
 I want to send a robot there to look at it though.

23:13.580 --> 23:16.180
 This is again, everybody's discriminating against robots.

23:16.180 --> 23:18.780
 This is not, but it's fine.

23:18.780 --> 23:22.320
 But it's not hospitable to humans in any way, right?

23:22.320 --> 23:24.780
 Just very cold and very hot.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.380
 It's very cold.

23:27.380 --> 23:31.680
 The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide, so you can breathe it.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.680
 There's no pressure.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.860
 I mean, it's kind of all the same things you talk about.

23:34.860 --> 23:39.440
 One talks about, about Mars only worse, the atmosphere is still a thousand times less

23:39.440 --> 23:42.820
 dense than Mars is.

23:42.820 --> 23:47.060
 And the radiation environment is terrible because you're embedded deep within Jupiter's

23:47.060 --> 23:53.060
 magnetic field and Jupiter's magnetic field is full of charged particles that have all

23:53.060 --> 23:56.460
 come out of Io's volcanoes actually.

23:56.460 --> 24:03.060
 So Jupiter's magnetic field strips all this material out of Io's atmosphere and that populates

24:03.060 --> 24:07.540
 its entire magnetosphere and then that material comes back around and hits Io and spreads

24:07.540 --> 24:08.900
 throughout the system actually.

24:08.900 --> 24:13.580
 It's just, it's like Io is the massive polluter of the Jupiter system.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.700
 Okay, cool.

24:15.700 --> 24:23.260
 So what does studying Io teach you about volcanoes on earth or vice versa?

24:23.260 --> 24:30.900
 Is in the difference of the two, what insights can you mine out?

24:30.900 --> 24:34.900
 That might be interesting in some way.

24:34.900 --> 24:35.900
 Yeah.

24:35.900 --> 24:41.540
 Well, we try to port the tools that we use to study earth volcanism to Io and it works

24:41.540 --> 24:49.260
 to some extent, but it is challenging because the situations are so different and the compositions

24:49.260 --> 24:50.260
 are really different.

24:50.260 --> 24:55.020
 When you talk about outgassing, you know, earth volcanoes outgassed primarily water

24:55.020 --> 25:00.540
 and carbon dioxide, and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas.

25:00.540 --> 25:07.100
 And on Io, the water and carbon dioxide are not there, either it didn't form with them

25:07.100 --> 25:09.620
 or it lost them, we don't know.

25:09.620 --> 25:14.220
 And so the chemistry of how the magma outgassed this is completely different.

25:14.220 --> 25:24.580
 But the kind of one to me most interesting analogy to earth is that, so Io, as I've said,

25:24.580 --> 25:29.580
 it has these really low viscosity magmas, the lava spreads really quickly across its

25:29.580 --> 25:34.500
 surface, it can put out massive volumes of magma in relatively short periods of time.

25:34.500 --> 25:39.220
 And that sort of volcanism is not happening anywhere else in the solar system today.

25:39.220 --> 25:46.540
 But literally every terrestrial planet and the moon had this, what we call very effusive

25:46.540 --> 25:48.580
 volcanism early in their history.

25:48.580 --> 25:52.260
 Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse into the early history of earth.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.260
 Yeah.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.260
 Okay, cool.

25:54.260 --> 26:00.220
 So what are the chances that a volcano on earth destroys all of human civilization?

26:00.220 --> 26:01.780
 Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question.

26:01.780 --> 26:06.020
 Yeah, a volcano on earth.

26:06.020 --> 26:09.500
 Do you think about that kind of stuff when you just study volcanoes elsewhere?

26:09.500 --> 26:15.380
 Because isn't it kind of humbling to see something so powerful and so hot, like so unpleasant

26:15.380 --> 26:18.980
 for humans, and then you realize we're sitting on many of them here?

26:18.980 --> 26:19.980
 Right.

26:19.980 --> 26:22.300
 Yeah, Yellowstone is a classic example.

26:22.300 --> 26:26.740
 I don't know what the chances are of that happening.

26:26.740 --> 26:31.380
 My intuition would be that the chances of that are lower than the chances of us getting

26:31.380 --> 26:37.580
 wiped out by some other means, that maybe it'll happen eventually, that there'll be

26:37.580 --> 26:41.060
 one of these massive volcanoes on earth, but we'll probably be gone by then by some other

26:41.060 --> 26:42.060
 means.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.060
 Not to sound bleak.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.060
 That's very comforting.

26:44.060 --> 26:51.060
 Okay, so can we talk about Europa?

26:51.060 --> 26:57.700
 Is there, so maybe can you talk about the intuition, the hope that people have about

26:57.700 --> 27:00.140
 life being in Europa?

27:00.140 --> 27:03.720
 Maybe also, what are the things we know about it?

27:03.720 --> 27:08.540
 What are the things to you that are interesting about that particular moon of Jupiter?

27:08.540 --> 27:09.540
 Sure.

27:09.540 --> 27:15.220
 Yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives, one of the really interesting places in the solar

27:15.220 --> 27:16.960
 system among the solar system moons.

27:16.960 --> 27:25.220
 So there are a few, there's a lot of interest in looking for or understanding the potential

27:25.220 --> 27:27.700
 for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans.

27:27.700 --> 27:33.940
 I think it's fairly widely accepted that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces of

27:33.940 --> 27:37.660
 really anything in the solar system is very low.

27:37.660 --> 27:45.400
 The radiation environment is too harsh and there's just not liquids on the surface of

27:45.400 --> 27:51.460
 most of these things and it's canonically accepted that liquids are required for life.

27:51.460 --> 27:55.620
 And so the subsurface oceans, in addition to maybe Titan's atmosphere, the subsurface

27:55.620 --> 28:01.260
 oceans of the icy satellites are one of the most plausible places in the solar system

28:01.260 --> 28:03.740
 for life to evolve.

28:03.740 --> 28:08.780
 Europa and Cellitus are interesting because for many of the big satellites, so Ganymede

28:08.780 --> 28:13.780
 and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter, also are thought to have subsurface oceans.

28:13.780 --> 28:19.380
 But they have these ice shells and then there's an ocean underneath the ice shell.

28:19.380 --> 28:23.540
 But on those moons around Ganymede, we think that there's another ice shell underneath

28:23.540 --> 28:25.580
 and then there's rock.

28:25.580 --> 28:30.640
 And the reason that that is a problem for life is that your ocean is probably just pure

28:30.640 --> 28:34.740
 water because it's trapped between two big shells of ice.

28:34.740 --> 28:39.980
 So Europa doesn't have this ice shell at the bottom of the ocean, we think.

28:39.980 --> 28:45.500
 And so the water and rock are in direct interaction and so that means that you can basically dissolve

28:45.500 --> 28:47.060
 a lot of material out of the rock.

28:47.060 --> 28:52.840
 You potentially have this hydrothermal activity that's injecting energy and nutrients for

28:52.840 --> 28:53.840
 life to survive.

28:53.840 --> 29:02.500
 And so this rock water interface is considered really important for the potential habitability.

29:02.500 --> 29:08.940
 As a small aside, you kind of said that it's canonically assumed that water is required

29:08.940 --> 29:09.940
 for life.

29:09.940 --> 29:13.700
 Is it possible to have life like in a volcano?

29:13.700 --> 29:21.660
 I remember people were like in that National Geographic program or something kind of hypothesizing

29:21.660 --> 29:23.700
 that you can really have life anywhere.

29:23.700 --> 29:27.860
 So as long as there's a source of heat, a source of energy, do you think it's possible

29:27.860 --> 29:34.580
 to have life in a volcano, like no water?

29:34.580 --> 29:37.780
 I think anything's possible.

29:37.780 --> 29:39.740
 I think so.

29:39.740 --> 29:42.660
 It doesn't have to be water.

29:42.660 --> 29:46.100
 You can tell, as you identified, I phrased that really carefully.

29:46.100 --> 29:53.380
 It's canonically accepted that because scientists recognize that we have no idea what broad

29:53.380 --> 29:57.780
 range of life could be out there and all we really have is our biases of life as we know

29:57.780 --> 29:58.780
 it.

29:58.780 --> 30:02.820
 But for life as we know it, it's very helpful to have or even necessary to have some kind

30:02.820 --> 30:09.260
 of liquid and preferably a polar solvent that can actually dissolve molecules, something

30:09.260 --> 30:10.260
 like water.

30:10.260 --> 30:14.100
 So the case of liquid methane on Titan is less ideal from that perspective.

30:14.100 --> 30:20.460
 But liquid magma, if it stays liquid long enough for life to evolve, you have a heat

30:20.460 --> 30:22.420
 source, you have a liquid, you have nutrients.

30:22.420 --> 30:28.580
 In theory, that checks your three classic astrobiology boxes.

30:28.580 --> 30:29.580
 That'd be fascinating.

30:29.580 --> 30:32.580
 I mean, it'd be fascinating if it's possible to detect it easily.

30:32.580 --> 30:38.780
 How would we detect if there is life on Europa?

30:38.780 --> 30:45.620
 Is it possible to do in a noncontact way from a distance through telescopes and so on?

30:45.620 --> 30:51.140
 Or do we need to send robots and do some drilling?

30:51.140 --> 30:56.900
 I think realistically you need to do the drilling.

30:56.900 --> 31:02.580
 So Europa also has these long tectonic features on its surface where it's thought that there's

31:02.580 --> 31:08.180
 potential for water from the ocean to be somehow making its way up onto the surface.

31:08.180 --> 31:12.400
 And you could imagine some out there scenario where there's bacteria in the ocean.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.540
 It's somehow working its way up through the ice shell.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.200
 It's spilling out on the surface.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.820
 It's being killed by the radiation.

31:18.820 --> 31:24.300
 But your instrument could detect some spectroscopic signature of that dead bacterium.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.980
 But that's many ifs and assumptions.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.780
 That's a hope because then you don't have to do that much drilling.

31:29.780 --> 31:32.100
 You can collect from the surface.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.100
 Skeletons of bacteria.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.100
 Right.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.100
 I'm thinking even remotely.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.100
 Oh, remotely.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.100
 Yeah.

31:37.100 --> 31:45.580
 That's sad that there's a single cell civilization living underneath all that ice trying to get

31:45.580 --> 31:46.580
 up.

31:46.580 --> 31:47.580
 Trying to get out.

31:47.580 --> 31:55.220
 Enceladus gives you a slightly better chance of that because Enceladus is a moon of Saturn

31:55.220 --> 31:59.580
 and it's broadly similar to Europa in some ways.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.580
 It's an icy satellite.

32:00.580 --> 32:05.500
 It has a subsurface ocean that's probably in touch with the rocky interior.

32:05.500 --> 32:09.820
 But it has these massive geysers at its south pole where it's spewing out material that

32:09.820 --> 32:12.940
 appears to be originating all the way from the ocean.

32:12.940 --> 32:20.100
 And so in that case, you could potentially fly through that plume and scoop up that material

32:20.100 --> 32:22.700
 and hope that at the velocities you'd be scooping it up.

32:22.700 --> 32:27.060
 You're not destroying any signature of the life you're looking for.

32:27.060 --> 32:31.500
 But let's say that you have some ingenuity and can come up with a way to do that.

32:31.500 --> 32:38.260
 It potentially gives you a more direct opportunity at least to try to measure those bacteria

32:38.260 --> 32:39.260
 directly.

32:39.260 --> 32:45.100
 Can you tell me a little more on, how do you pronounce it, Salas?

32:45.100 --> 32:46.100
 Enceladus.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.100
 Enceladus.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.780
 Can you tell me a little bit more about Enceladus?

32:49.780 --> 32:58.100
 Like we've been talking about way too much about Jupiter, Saturn doesn't get enough love.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.380
 Saturn doesn't get as much love.

32:59.380 --> 33:02.060
 So what's Enceladus?

33:02.060 --> 33:05.300
 Is that the most exciting moon of Saturn?

33:05.300 --> 33:07.760
 Depends on your perspective.

33:07.760 --> 33:11.380
 It's very exciting from a astrobiology perspective.

33:11.380 --> 33:16.860
 I think Enceladus and Titan are the two most unique and interesting moons of Saturn that

33:16.860 --> 33:22.460
 definitely both get the most attention also from the life perspective.

33:22.460 --> 33:28.500
 So what's the more likely Titan or Enceladus for life?

33:28.500 --> 33:33.580
 If you were to bet all your money in terms of like investing, which to investigate, what

33:33.580 --> 33:37.260
 are the differences between the two that are interesting to you?

33:37.260 --> 33:38.260
 Yeah.

33:38.260 --> 33:43.260
 So the potential for life in each of those two places is very different.

33:43.260 --> 33:48.840
 So Titan is the one place in the solar system where you might imagine, again, all of this

33:48.840 --> 33:53.380
 is so speculative, but you might imagine life evolving in the atmosphere.

33:53.380 --> 33:59.900
 So from a biology perspective, Titan is interesting because it forms complex organic molecules

33:59.900 --> 34:01.740
 in its atmosphere.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.820
 It has a dense atmosphere.

34:02.820 --> 34:04.360
 It's actually denser than Earth's.

34:04.360 --> 34:09.660
 It's the only moon that has an atmosphere denser than Earth's and it's got tons of methane

34:09.660 --> 34:10.660
 in it.

34:10.660 --> 34:13.920
 What happens is that methane gets irradiated, it breaks up and it reforms with other things

34:13.920 --> 34:15.500
 in the atmosphere.

34:15.500 --> 34:21.640
 It makes these complex organic molecules and it's effectively doing prebiotic chemistry

34:21.640 --> 34:23.460
 in the atmosphere.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.540
 While still being freezing cold?

34:25.540 --> 34:26.540
 Yes.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.540
 Okay.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.740
 What would that be like?

34:29.740 --> 34:32.900
 Would that be pleasant for humans to hang out there?

34:32.900 --> 34:34.200
 It's just really cold?

34:34.200 --> 34:37.820
 There's nowhere in the solar system that would be pleasant for humans.

34:37.820 --> 34:38.820
 It would be cold.

34:38.820 --> 34:40.620
 You couldn't breathe the air.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.900
 But colonization wise, if there's an atmosphere, isn't that a big plus?

34:44.900 --> 34:47.860
 Or still a ton of radiation?

34:47.860 --> 34:48.860
 Sure.

34:48.860 --> 34:49.860
 Okay.

34:49.860 --> 34:55.740
 So Titan, that's a really nice feature that life could be in the atmosphere because then

34:55.740 --> 35:01.220
 it might be remotely observable or certainly is more accessible if you visit.

35:01.220 --> 35:02.740
 Okay.

35:02.740 --> 35:05.260
 So what about Enceladus?

35:05.260 --> 35:07.780
 So that would be still in the ocean.

35:07.780 --> 35:08.780
 Right.

35:08.780 --> 35:13.300
 And Enceladus has the advantage, like I said, of spewing material out of its south pole

35:13.300 --> 35:14.300
 so you could collect it.

35:14.300 --> 35:21.220
 But it has the disadvantage of the fact that we don't actually really understand how its

35:21.220 --> 35:28.020
 ocean could stay globally liquid over the age of the solar system.

35:28.020 --> 35:34.860
 And so there are some models that say that it's going through this cyclical evolution

35:34.860 --> 35:40.780
 where the ocean freezes completely and thaws completely and the orbit sort of oscillates

35:40.780 --> 35:45.020
 in and out of these eccentricities.

35:45.020 --> 35:49.540
 And in that case, the potential for life ever occurring there in the first place is a lot

35:49.540 --> 35:55.020
 lower because if you only have an ocean for 100 million years, is that enough time?

35:55.020 --> 36:00.580
 It also means there might be mass extinction events if it does occur and then it just freezes.

36:00.580 --> 36:01.580
 Again, very sad, man.

36:01.580 --> 36:07.620
 This is very depressing, all the slaughter of life elsewhere.

36:07.620 --> 36:11.900
 How unlikely do you think life is on Earth?

36:11.900 --> 36:18.780
 So when you study other planets and you study the contents of other planets, does that give

36:18.780 --> 36:26.020
 you a perspective on the origin of life on Earth, which again is full of mystery in itself,

36:26.020 --> 36:33.900
 not the evolution, but the origin, the first springing to life, like from nothing to life,

36:33.900 --> 36:37.380
 from the basic ingredients to life?

36:37.380 --> 36:40.620
 I guess another way of asking it is how unique are we?

36:40.620 --> 36:46.580
 Yeah, it's a great question and it's one that just scientifically we don't have an answer

36:46.580 --> 36:47.640
 to.

36:47.640 --> 36:53.040
 We don't even know how many times life evolved on Earth, if it was only once or if it happened

36:53.040 --> 36:56.560
 independently a thousand times in different places.

36:56.560 --> 37:01.840
 We don't know whether it's happened anywhere else in the universe, although it feels absurd

37:01.840 --> 37:07.540
 to believe that we are the only life that evolved in the entire universe, but it's conceivable.

37:07.540 --> 37:12.060
 We just have just no real information.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.740
 We don't understand really how life came about in the first place on Earth.

37:15.740 --> 37:23.620
 I mean, so if you look at the Drake equation that tries to estimate how many alien civilizations

37:23.620 --> 37:29.700
 are out there, planets have a big part to play in that equation.

37:29.700 --> 37:36.500
 If you were to bet money in terms of the odds of origins of life on Earth, I mean, this

37:36.500 --> 37:40.220
 all has to do with how special and unique is Earth.

37:40.220 --> 37:45.720
 What you land in terms of the number of civilizations has to do with how unique their rare Earth

37:45.720 --> 37:47.000
 hypothesis is.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.640
 How rare and special is Earth?

37:49.640 --> 37:52.740
 How rare and special is the solar system?

37:52.740 --> 37:58.500
 Like if you had to bet all your money on a completely unscientific question, well, no,

37:58.500 --> 38:03.340
 it's actually a rigorously scientific, we just don't know a lot of things in that equation.

38:03.340 --> 38:08.020
 There's a lot of mysteries about that and it's slowly becoming better and better understood

38:08.020 --> 38:13.500
 in terms of exoplanets, in terms of how many solar systems are out there where there's

38:13.500 --> 38:16.700
 planets that are Earth like planets, it's getting better and better understood.

38:16.700 --> 38:24.780
 What's your sense from that perspective, how many alien civilizations out there, zero or

38:24.780 --> 38:25.780
 one plus?

38:25.780 --> 38:30.420
 You're right that the equation is being better understood, but you're really only talking

38:30.420 --> 38:33.500
 about the first three parameters in the equation or something.

38:33.500 --> 38:38.380
 How many stars are there, how many planets per star, and then we're just barely scratching

38:38.380 --> 38:41.820
 the surface of what fraction of those planets might be habitable.

38:41.820 --> 38:46.460
 The rest of the terms in the equation are like how likely is life to evolve given habitable

38:46.460 --> 38:51.480
 conditions, how likely is it to survive, all these things.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.160
 There are all these huge unknowns.

38:53.160 --> 38:58.860
 Actually I remember when I first saw that equation, I think it was my first year of

38:58.860 --> 39:01.420
 college and I thought this is ridiculous.

39:01.420 --> 39:08.660
 This is A, common sense that didn't need to give a name, you know, and B, just a bunch

39:08.660 --> 39:12.340
 of unknowns, it's like putting our ignorance together in one equation.

39:12.340 --> 39:17.860
 But now I understand this equation, you know, it's not something we'll ever necessarily

39:17.860 --> 39:22.900
 have the answer to, it just gives us a framework for having the exact conversation we're having

39:22.900 --> 39:23.900
 right now.

39:23.900 --> 39:27.660
 And I think that's how it was intended in the first place when it was put into writing

39:27.660 --> 39:33.020
 was to give people a language to communicate about the factors that go into the potential

39:33.020 --> 39:38.100
 for aliens to be out there and for us to find them.

39:38.100 --> 39:46.740
 I would put money on there being aliens, I would not put money on us having definitive

39:46.740 --> 39:49.740
 evidence of them in my lifetime.

39:49.740 --> 39:54.700
 Well, definitive is a funny, is a funny word.

39:54.700 --> 40:01.500
 My sense is, this is the saddest part for me, is my sense in terms of intelligent alien

40:01.500 --> 40:11.100
 civilizations, I feel like we're so, we're so self obsessed that we literally would not

40:11.100 --> 40:13.340
 be able to detect them.

40:13.340 --> 40:20.020
 Even when they're like in front of us, like trees could be aliens, but just their intelligence

40:20.020 --> 40:28.780
 could be realized on a scale, on a time scale or physical scale that we're not appreciating.

40:28.780 --> 40:31.700
 Like trees could be way more intelligent than us.

40:31.700 --> 40:32.700
 I don't know.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.700
 It's just a dumb example.

40:33.700 --> 40:41.260
 It could be rocks or it could be things like, this, I love this, this is a Dawkins memes.

40:41.260 --> 40:46.460
 It could be that ideas are the, like ideas we have, like where do ideas come from?

40:46.460 --> 40:48.140
 Where do thoughts come from?

40:48.140 --> 40:55.840
 Maybe thoughts are the aliens or maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms of communication

40:55.840 --> 40:57.700
 in physics, right?

40:57.700 --> 41:03.060
 This is like, we think of thoughts as something that springs up from neurons firing or where

41:03.060 --> 41:05.340
 the hell they come from.

41:05.340 --> 41:08.160
 And now what about consciousness?

41:08.160 --> 41:10.560
 Maybe consciousness is the communication.

41:10.560 --> 41:18.540
 It sounds like ridiculous, but like we're so self centered on this space, time, communication

41:18.540 --> 41:26.780
 and physical space using like written language, like spoken with audio on a time scale that's

41:26.780 --> 41:30.960
 very specific on a physical scale, it's very specific.

41:30.960 --> 41:37.620
 So I tend to think that, but bacteria will probably recognize like moving organisms will

41:37.620 --> 41:42.700
 probably recognize, but when that forms itself into intelligence, most likely it'll be robots

41:42.700 --> 41:45.620
 of some kind because we won't be meeting the origins.

41:45.620 --> 41:49.140
 We'll be meeting the creations of those intelligences.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.340
 We just would not be able to appreciate it.

41:51.340 --> 42:02.820
 And that's the saddest thing to me that we, yeah, we're too dumb to see aliens.

42:02.820 --> 42:07.300
 Like we're too, we kind of think like, look at the progress of science, we've accomplished

42:07.300 --> 42:08.460
 so much.

42:08.460 --> 42:13.640
 The sad thing it could be that we're just like in the first 0.0001% of understanding

42:13.640 --> 42:15.060
 anything is humbling.

42:15.060 --> 42:20.880
 I hope that's true because I feel like we're very ignorant as a species.

42:20.880 --> 42:25.700
 And I hope that our current level of knowledge only represents the 0.001% of what we will

42:25.700 --> 42:26.700
 someday achieve.

42:26.700 --> 42:29.540
 That actually feels optimistic to me.

42:29.540 --> 42:35.020
 Well, I feel like that's easier for us to comprehend in the space of biology and not

42:35.020 --> 42:39.260
 as easy to comprehend in the space of physics, for example, because we have a sense that

42:39.260 --> 42:45.460
 like we have it, like if you, if you talk to theoretical physicists, they have a sense

42:45.460 --> 42:54.180
 that we understand the basic laws that form the nature of reality of our universe.

42:54.180 --> 42:58.380
 But so there's much more, like physicists are much more confident.

42:58.380 --> 43:06.640
 Biologists are like, uh, this is a squishy mess, we're doing our best, physicists, but

43:06.640 --> 43:10.580
 I would be, it'd be fascinating to see if physicists themselves would also be humbled

43:10.580 --> 43:15.940
 by their being like, what the hell is dark matter and dark energy?

43:15.940 --> 43:21.900
 What the hell is the, not just the origin of the, not just the big bang, but everything

43:21.900 --> 43:24.180
 that happened since the big bang.

43:24.180 --> 43:27.320
 A lot of things that happened since the big bang, we have no ideas about except basic

43:27.320 --> 43:28.320
 models of physics.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.320
 Right.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.320
 What happened before the big bang?

43:30.320 --> 43:31.320
 Yeah.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.320
 Yeah.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.320
 What happened before?

43:33.320 --> 43:34.320
 Or what's happening inside the black hole?

43:34.320 --> 43:36.460
 Why is there a black hole at the center of our galaxy?

43:36.460 --> 43:37.460
 Can somebody answer this?

43:37.460 --> 43:39.660
 A supermassive black hole.

43:39.660 --> 43:41.500
 Nobody knows how it started.

43:41.500 --> 43:44.460
 And they seem to be like in the middle of all galaxies.

43:44.460 --> 43:48.700
 Um, so that could be a portal for aliens to communicate through consciousness.

43:48.700 --> 43:49.700
 Okay.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.700
 Um, all right, back to planets.

43:51.700 --> 43:55.300
 How, um, what's your favorite outside of earth?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.740
 What's your favorite planet or moon?

43:57.740 --> 44:03.500
 Maybe outside of the ones we, well, first, have we talked about it already or, and then

44:03.500 --> 44:05.980
 if we did mention it, what's the one outside of that?

44:05.980 --> 44:06.980
 Oh gosh.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.980
 I have to come up with another favorite that's not IO.

44:08.980 --> 44:09.980
 Oh, IO is the favorite.

44:09.980 --> 44:10.980
 Oh, absolutely.

44:10.980 --> 44:12.540
 Why is IO the favorite?

44:12.540 --> 44:17.540
 I mean, basically everything I've, I've already said, it's just such a, an amazing and unique

44:17.540 --> 44:18.540
 object.

44:18.540 --> 44:26.700
 Um, but on, I guess a personal note, it's probably the object that made me become a

44:26.700 --> 44:28.660
 planetary scientist.

44:28.660 --> 44:34.260
 It's the first thing in the solar system that really deeply captured my interest.

44:34.260 --> 44:42.620
 Um, and when I started my PhD, I wanted to be an astrophysicist working on things like

44:42.620 --> 44:48.380
 galaxy evolution, um, and sort of slowly, I had done some projects in the solar system,

44:48.380 --> 44:53.060
 but IO was the thing that like really caught me in to doing solar system science.

44:53.060 --> 44:54.060
 Okay.

44:54.060 --> 44:56.980
 Let's, let's leave, uh, moons aside.

44:56.980 --> 44:58.920
 What's your favorite planet?

44:58.920 --> 45:01.140
 It sounds like you like moons better than planets.

45:01.140 --> 45:02.940
 So it's, uh, that's accurate.

45:02.940 --> 45:05.700
 Um, but the planets are, are fascinating.

45:05.700 --> 45:10.540
 I think, you know, I find that the planets in the solar system really fascinating.

45:10.540 --> 45:17.020
 What I like about the moons is that they, there's so much less that is known.

45:17.020 --> 45:21.380
 There's still a lot more discovery space and the questions that we can ask are still the,

45:21.380 --> 45:22.380
 the bigger questions.

45:22.380 --> 45:23.380
 Gotcha.

45:23.380 --> 45:27.820
 Um, which, you know, I, and maybe I'm being unfair to the planets because we're still

45:27.820 --> 45:31.580
 trying to understand things like, was there ever life on Mars?

45:31.580 --> 45:37.460
 And that is a huge question and one that we've sent numerous robots to Mars to try to answer.

45:37.460 --> 45:41.220
 So maybe I'm being unfair to the planets, but, but there is certainly quite a bit more

45:41.220 --> 45:44.820
 information, uh, that we have about the planets than the moons.

45:44.820 --> 45:48.260
 But I mean, Venus is, is a fascinating object.

45:48.260 --> 45:53.340
 So I like the objects that lie at the extremes.

45:53.340 --> 45:59.420
 I think that if we can make a sort of theory or, or like I've been saying, framework for

45:59.420 --> 46:04.380
 understanding planets and moons that can incorporate even the most extreme ones, then, you know,

46:04.380 --> 46:08.240
 those are the things that really test your theory and test your understanding.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.400
 And so they've always really fascinated me.

46:10.400 --> 46:15.140
 Not so much the nice habitable places like Earth, but these extreme places like Venus

46:15.140 --> 46:23.620
 that have, um, sulfuric acid clouds and just incredibly hot and dense surfaces.

46:23.620 --> 46:30.120
 And Venus, of course, I love volcanism for some reason, and, and Venus has, probably

46:30.120 --> 46:37.020
 has volcanic activity, definitely has in their recent past, maybe has ongoing today.

46:37.020 --> 46:41.940
 What do you make of the news and maybe you can update it in terms of life being discovered

46:41.940 --> 46:44.180
 in the atmosphere of Venus?

46:44.180 --> 46:45.180
 Is that, sorry.

46:45.180 --> 46:46.180
 Okay.

46:46.180 --> 46:47.180
 You have opinion.

46:47.180 --> 46:49.100
 I can already tell you have opinions.

46:49.100 --> 46:50.100
 Was that fake news?

46:50.100 --> 46:52.740
 I got excited when I saw that.

46:52.740 --> 46:56.460
 What's the, what's the final, uh, is there a life on Venus?

46:56.460 --> 47:01.020
 So the detection that was reported was the detection of the molecule phosphine.

47:01.020 --> 47:10.340
 Um, and they said that they tried every other mechanism they could think of to produce phosphine

47:10.340 --> 47:13.680
 and they, none of, no mechanism worked.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.500
 And then they said, well, we know that life produces phosphine.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.540
 And so that was sort of the train of logic.

47:19.540 --> 47:25.980
 And, um, I don't personally believe that phosphine was detected in the first place.

47:25.980 --> 47:26.980
 Okay.

47:26.980 --> 47:35.500
 So then, I mean, this is just one study, but I, as a layman, I'm skeptical a little bit

47:35.500 --> 47:41.260
 about tools that sense the contents of an atmosphere, like contents of an atmosphere

47:41.260 --> 47:46.740
 from remotely and making conclusive statements about life.

47:46.740 --> 47:48.140
 Oh yeah.

47:48.140 --> 47:53.500
 Well that connection that you just made, the contents of the atmosphere to the life is,

47:53.500 --> 47:54.700
 is a tricky one.

47:54.700 --> 48:00.260
 And yeah, I know that that claim received a lot of criticism for the lines of logic

48:00.260 --> 48:05.060
 that went from detection to, uh, to claim of life.

48:05.060 --> 48:11.760
 Even the detection itself though, did, doesn't, doesn't meet the sort of historical scientific

48:11.760 --> 48:14.580
 standards of, of a detection.

48:14.580 --> 48:20.820
 Um, the, it was a very tenuous detection and only one line of the species was detected.

48:20.820 --> 48:26.600
 And a lot of really complicated data analysis methods had to be applied to even make that

48:26.600 --> 48:27.600
 weak detection.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.600
 Yeah.

48:28.600 --> 48:29.600
 Um.

48:29.600 --> 48:32.660
 So it could be, it could be noise, it could be polluted data, it could be all the, all

48:32.660 --> 48:33.660
 those things.

48:33.660 --> 48:38.100
 And so it doesn't have, it doesn't meet the, the level of rigor that you would hope.

48:38.100 --> 48:44.500
 But of course, I mean, we're doing our best and it's clear that, uh, the human species

48:44.500 --> 48:46.940
 are hopeful to find life.

48:46.940 --> 48:47.940
 Clearly.

48:47.940 --> 48:48.940
 Yes.

48:48.940 --> 48:50.580
 Everyone is so excited about that possibility.

48:50.580 --> 48:51.580
 All right.

48:51.580 --> 48:56.420
 Let's, uh, let me ask you about Mars.

48:56.420 --> 49:05.940
 So, um, there's a guy named Elon Musk and, uh, he seems to want to take something called

49:05.940 --> 49:07.500
 Dogecoin there.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.500
 First of the month.

49:08.500 --> 49:11.340
 I'm just, I'm just kidding about the Dogecoin.

49:11.340 --> 49:20.220
 I don't even know what the heck is up with that whole, um, I think, uh, I think humor

49:20.220 --> 49:28.580
 has power in the 21st century in a way to spread ideas in the most positive way.

49:28.580 --> 49:37.280
 So I love that kind of humor because it makes people smile, but it also kind of sneaks.

49:37.280 --> 49:40.740
 It's like a Trojan horse for cool ideas.

49:40.740 --> 49:45.580
 You you open with humor and you, uh, like the humor is the appetizer.

49:45.580 --> 49:52.860
 And then the main meal is the science and the engineering anyway, uh, do you think it's

49:52.860 --> 50:02.500
 possible to colonize Mars or other planets in the solar system, but we're especially

50:02.500 --> 50:04.300
 looking to Mars.

50:04.300 --> 50:09.100
 Is there something about planets that make them very harsh to humans?

50:09.100 --> 50:14.020
 Is there something in particular you think about and maybe in a high like big picture

50:14.020 --> 50:19.740
 perspective, do you have a hope we, we do in fact become a multi planetary species?

50:19.740 --> 50:26.820
 I do think that if our species survives long enough and we don't wipe ourselves out or

50:26.820 --> 50:32.940
 get wiped out by some other means that we will eventually be able to colonize other

50:32.940 --> 50:33.940
 planets.

50:33.940 --> 50:36.380
 I do not expect that to happen in my lifetime.

50:36.380 --> 50:41.260
 I mean, tourists may go to Mars, tourists, people who commit years of their life to go

50:41.260 --> 50:43.820
 into Mars as a tourist may go to Mars.

50:43.820 --> 50:46.820
 Um, I don't think that we will colonize it.

50:46.820 --> 50:53.540
 Um, is there a sense why it's just too harsh on the environment to, uh, to, to, like it's

50:53.540 --> 51:00.260
 too costly to build something habitable there for a large population.

51:00.260 --> 51:06.260
 I think that we need to do a lot of work and learning how to use the resources that are

51:06.260 --> 51:09.540
 are on the planet already to do the things we need.

51:09.540 --> 51:16.460
 So if you're talking about someone going there for a few months, um, so we'll back up a little

51:16.460 --> 51:17.600
 bit.

51:17.600 --> 51:22.820
 There are many things that make Mars not hospitable, temperature, you can't breathe the air, you

51:22.820 --> 51:27.420
 need a pressure suit, even if you're on the surface, the radiation environment is, you

51:27.420 --> 51:31.580
 know, even in all of those things, the radiation environment is too harsh for the human body.

51:31.580 --> 51:37.940
 Um, all of those things seem like they could eventually have technological solutions.

51:37.940 --> 51:46.220
 Um, the challenge, the, the real significant challenge to me seems to be the, the creation

51:46.220 --> 51:49.540
 of a self sustaining civilization there.

51:49.540 --> 51:53.880
 You know, you can bring pressure suits, you can bring oxygen to breathe, but those are

51:53.880 --> 51:55.220
 all in limited supply.

51:55.220 --> 51:59.760
 And if we're going to colonize it, we need to find ways to make use of the resources

51:59.760 --> 52:05.100
 that are there to do things like produce food, produce the air, the humans need to keep breathing

52:05.100 --> 52:07.140
 just in order to make it self sustaining.

52:07.140 --> 52:09.620
 There's a tremendous amount of work that has to be done.

52:09.620 --> 52:15.420
 And people are working on these problems, but I think that's going to be a major obstacle

52:15.420 --> 52:19.780
 in going from visiting where we can bring everything we need to survive in the short

52:19.780 --> 52:21.780
 term to actually colonizing.

52:21.780 --> 52:22.780
 Yeah.

52:22.780 --> 52:33.400
 I find that whole project of the human species quite inspiring these like huge moonshot projects.

52:33.400 --> 52:38.580
 Somebody I was reading something, um, in terms of the source of food that's that may be the

52:38.580 --> 52:42.860
 most effective on Mars is you could farm insects.

52:42.860 --> 52:44.980
 That's the easiest thing to farm.

52:44.980 --> 52:50.740
 So we'd be eating like cockroaches before living on Mars because that's the easiest

52:50.740 --> 52:54.620
 thing to actually, um, as a source of protein.

52:54.620 --> 52:57.860
 So growing a source of protein is the easiest thing as insects.

52:57.860 --> 53:03.160
 I just imagine this giant for people who are afraid of insects.

53:03.160 --> 53:07.180
 This is not a pleasant, maybe you're not supposed to even think of it that way.

53:07.180 --> 53:09.780
 It'd be like a cockroach milkshake or something like that.

53:09.780 --> 53:10.780
 Right.

53:10.780 --> 53:15.420
 I wonder if, have people been working on the genetic engineering of, of insects to make

53:15.420 --> 53:19.060
 them radiation friendly, right.

53:19.060 --> 53:22.540
 Or pressure resistant or whatever.

53:22.540 --> 53:29.620
 What can possibly go wrong with making radiation resistant, they're already like survived everything.

53:29.620 --> 53:32.900
 Plus I, um, I took an allergy test, um, in Austin.

53:32.900 --> 53:36.820
 So there's everybody's alert is like the allergy levels are super high there.

53:36.820 --> 53:43.020
 Uh, and, uh, one of the things, apparently I'm not allergic to any insects except cockroaches.

53:43.020 --> 53:44.380
 It's hilarious.

53:44.380 --> 53:50.920
 So maybe, uh, um, well, I'm going to use that as a, you know, people use, uh, an excuse

53:50.920 --> 53:52.780
 that I'm allergic to cats to not have cats.

53:52.780 --> 53:56.980
 I'm going to use that as an excuse to, uh, not go to Mars as one of the first batch of

53:56.980 --> 53:57.980
 people.

53:57.980 --> 54:00.740
 I was going to ask if you had the opportunity, would you go?

54:00.740 --> 54:03.080
 Yeah, I'm joking about the cockroach thing.

54:03.080 --> 54:04.080
 I would definitely go.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.220
 I love challenges.

54:05.220 --> 54:08.260
 I love, I love things.

54:08.260 --> 54:17.500
 I love doing things where the possibility of death is, is, uh, not insignificant because

54:17.500 --> 54:22.740
 it makes me appreciate it more.

54:22.740 --> 54:27.780
 Meditating on death makes me appreciate life.

54:27.780 --> 54:35.660
 And uh, when the meditation on death is forced on you because of how difficult the task is,

54:35.660 --> 54:37.900
 I enjoy those kinds of things.

54:37.900 --> 54:44.060
 Most people don't, it seems like, but I love the idea of difficult journeys, um, for no

54:44.060 --> 54:50.780
 purpose whatsoever, except exploration, going into the unknown, seeing what the limits of

54:50.780 --> 54:55.460
 the human mind and the human body are is like, what the hell else is this whole journey that

54:55.460 --> 54:56.460
 we're on for?

54:56.460 --> 55:00.380
 I, I, uh, but it could be because I grew up in the Soviet Union.

55:00.380 --> 55:07.140
 There's a kind of love for space, like the, the space race, the cold war created.

55:07.140 --> 55:13.020
 I don't know if still it permeates American culture as much, but especially with the dad

55:13.020 --> 55:20.460
 as a scientist, I think I've, I've loved the idea of humans striving out towards the stars

55:20.460 --> 55:24.900
 always, like from the engineering perspective has been really exciting.

55:24.900 --> 55:27.020
 I don't know if people love that as much in America anymore.

55:27.020 --> 55:31.860
 I think, uh, Elon is bringing that back a little bit, that excitement about rockets

55:31.860 --> 55:33.940
 and going out there.

55:33.940 --> 55:38.180
 But, uh, so that's, that's hopeful, but for me, I always loved that idea.

55:38.180 --> 55:47.140
 From a alien scientist perspective, if you were to look back on earth, is there something

55:47.140 --> 55:49.180
 interesting you could say about earth?

55:49.180 --> 55:51.060
 Like, how would you summarize earth?

55:51.060 --> 55:57.180
 Like in a report, you know, like, uh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, like if you had to report,

55:57.180 --> 56:03.580
 like write a paper on earth or like a letter, like a, like a one pager, um, summarizing

56:03.580 --> 56:06.700
 the contents of the surface and the atmosphere, is there, is there something interesting?

56:06.700 --> 56:11.140
 Like, do you ever take that kind of perspective on it?

56:11.140 --> 56:14.860
 I know you like volcanism, so volcanoes that will probably be in the report.

56:14.860 --> 56:17.020
 I was going to say that's where I was going to go first.

56:17.020 --> 56:20.560
 Uh, there are a few things to say about the atmosphere, but in terms of the volcanoes,

56:20.560 --> 56:28.300
 so one of the really interesting puzzles to me in planetary science is so we can, we can

56:28.300 --> 56:32.580
 look out there and we've been talking about surfaces and volcanoes and atmospheres and

56:32.580 --> 56:33.860
 things like that.

56:33.860 --> 56:38.100
 But that is just, you know, this tiny little veneer on the outside of the planet and most

56:38.100 --> 56:43.260
 of the planet is completely sort of inaccessible to telescopes or to spacecraft missions.

56:43.260 --> 56:47.580
 You can drill a meter into the surface, but you know, that's still really the veneer.

56:47.580 --> 56:53.500
 Um, and one of the cool puzzles is looking at what's going on on the surface and trying

56:53.500 --> 56:59.400
 to figure out what's happening underneath or just any kind of indirect means that you

56:59.400 --> 57:03.940
 have to study the interior because you can't dig into it directly, even on Earth.

57:03.940 --> 57:06.300
 You can't dig deep into Earth.

57:06.300 --> 57:13.020
 Uh, so from that perspective, looking at Earth, um, one thing that you would be able to tell

57:13.020 --> 57:18.760
 from orbit, given enough time, is that Earth has tectonic plates.

57:18.760 --> 57:22.940
 So you would see that volcanoes follow the edges.

57:22.940 --> 57:27.040
 If you trace where all the volcanoes are on Earth, they follow these lines that trace

57:27.040 --> 57:28.300
 the edges of the plates.

57:28.300 --> 57:34.700
 And similarly, you would see things like the, uh, Hawaiian string of volcanoes that you

57:34.700 --> 57:39.260
 could infer just like, you know, we did as people actually living on Earth, that the

57:39.260 --> 57:43.260
 plates are moving over some plume that's coming up through the mantle.

57:43.260 --> 57:48.180
 And so you could use that to say, if the aliens could look at where the volcanoes are, are

57:48.180 --> 57:51.780
 happening on Earth and say something about the fact that Earth has plate tectonics, which

57:51.780 --> 57:54.180
 makes it really unique in the solar system.

57:54.180 --> 57:55.180
 Um...

57:55.180 --> 57:56.180
 Oh, really?

57:56.180 --> 57:57.180
 So the other planets don't have plate tectonics?

57:57.180 --> 57:58.660
 It's the only one that has plate tectonics.

57:58.660 --> 57:59.660
 Yeah.

57:59.660 --> 58:03.740
 What about Io and the friction and all that, that's not plate tectonics?

58:03.740 --> 58:04.740
 What's the difference between...

58:04.740 --> 58:11.500
 Oh, it's plate tectonics, like another layer of like solid rock that moves around and there's

58:11.500 --> 58:12.500
 cracks.

58:12.500 --> 58:13.500
 Exactly.

58:13.500 --> 58:14.500
 Yeah.

58:14.500 --> 58:19.660
 So, so Earth has plates of solid rock sitting on top of a partially molten layer, and those

58:19.660 --> 58:22.060
 plates are kind of shifting around.

58:22.060 --> 58:26.060
 Um, on Io, it doesn't have that.

58:26.060 --> 58:28.900
 And the volcanism is what we call heat pipe volcanism.

58:28.900 --> 58:32.780
 It's the magma just punches a hole through the crust and comes out on the surface.

58:32.780 --> 58:35.780
 I mean, that's a simplification, but that's effectively what's happening.

58:35.780 --> 58:38.220
 Through the freezing cold crust?

58:38.220 --> 58:39.220
 Yes.

58:39.220 --> 58:41.380
 Very cold, very rigid crust.

58:41.380 --> 58:42.380
 Yeah.

58:42.380 --> 58:44.380
 How do you, how does that look like, by the way?

58:44.380 --> 58:49.540
 I don't think we've mentioned, so the gas that's expelled, like if we were to look at

58:49.540 --> 58:51.940
 it, is it beautiful or is it like boring?

58:51.940 --> 58:52.940
 The gas?

58:52.940 --> 58:56.740
 I mean, the whole thing, like the magma punching through, the icy...

58:56.740 --> 58:57.740
 Oh my gosh.

58:57.740 --> 59:00.700
 Yes, I'm sure it would be beautiful, and the pictures we've seen of it are beautiful.

59:00.700 --> 59:07.620
 You have, so the magma will come out of the lava, will come out of these fissures, and

59:07.620 --> 59:13.620
 you have these curtains of lava that are maybe even a kilometer high.

59:13.620 --> 59:17.660
 So if you looked at videos, I don't know how many volcano videos you've looked at on Earth,

59:17.660 --> 59:20.500
 but you sometimes see a tiny, tiny version of this in Iceland.

59:20.500 --> 59:24.380
 You see just these sheets of magma coming out of a fissure when you have this really

59:24.380 --> 59:29.900
 low viscosity magma, sort of water like, coming out of these sheets.

59:29.900 --> 59:35.420
 And the plumes that come out, because there's no atmosphere, all the plume molecules are

59:35.420 --> 59:42.820
 just plume particles, where they end up is just a function of the direction that they

59:42.820 --> 59:47.940
 left the vent, so they're all following ballistic trajectories, and you end up with these umbrella

59:47.940 --> 59:48.940
 plumes.

59:48.940 --> 59:53.180
 You don't get these sort of complicated plumes that you have on Earth that are occurring

59:53.180 --> 59:56.740
 because of how that material is interacting with the atmosphere that's there.

59:56.740 --> 1:00:01.380
 You just have these huge umbrellas, and it's been hypothesized, actually, that the atmosphere

1:00:01.380 --> 1:00:07.700
 is made of sulfur dioxide, and that you could have these kind of ash particles from the

1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:13.940
 volcano and the sulfur dioxide would condense onto these particles, and you'd have sulfur

1:00:13.940 --> 1:00:18.300
 dioxide snow coming out of these volcanic plumes.

1:00:18.300 --> 1:00:21.380
 And there's not much light, though, right?

1:00:21.380 --> 1:00:25.180
 So you wouldn't be able to, like, it would not make a good Instagram photo, because you

1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:28.140
 have to, would you see the snow?

1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:29.140
 Sure.

1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:30.140
 There's light.

1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:31.140
 It depends.

1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:32.140
 Oh, okay.

1:00:32.140 --> 1:00:33.140
 So you could, okay.

1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:36.380
 It depends what angle you're looking at it, where the sun is, all the things like that.

1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:38.580
 You know, the sunlight is much weaker, but it's still there.

1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:41.180
 It's still there.

1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:44.180
 And how big is Io in terms of gravity?

1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:45.180
 Is it smaller?

1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:47.780
 Is it a pretty small moon?

1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:49.980
 It's quite a bit smaller than Earth anyway.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:50.980
 It's smaller than Earth.

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:51.980
 Okay.

1:00:51.980 --> 1:00:52.980
 Okay.

1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:53.980
 Cool.

1:00:53.980 --> 1:00:54.980
 So they float up for a little bit.

1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:55.980
 So it floats.

1:00:55.980 --> 1:00:56.980
 Wow.

1:00:56.980 --> 1:00:57.980
 Yeah.

1:00:57.980 --> 1:00:58.980
 No, you're right.

1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:00.060
 That would be gorgeous.

1:01:00.060 --> 1:01:03.820
 What else about Earth is interesting besides volcanoes?

1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:04.820
 So plate tectonics.

1:01:04.820 --> 1:01:13.540
 I didn't realize that that was a unique element of a planet in the solar system, because that,

1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:17.940
 I wonder what, I mean, we experienced as human beings, it's quite painful because of earthquakes

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:22.260
 and all those kinds of things, but I wonder if there's nice features to it.

1:01:22.260 --> 1:01:23.260
 Yeah.

1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:30.020
 So coming back to habitability again, things like tectonics and plate tectonics are thought

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:33.220
 to play an important role in the surface being habitable.

1:01:33.220 --> 1:01:36.840
 And that's because you have a way of recycling materials.

1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:41.940
 So if you have a stagnant surface, everything, you know, you use up all the free oxygen,

1:01:41.940 --> 1:01:48.060
 everything reacts until you no longer have reactants that life can extract energy from.

1:01:48.060 --> 1:01:53.880
 And so if nothing's changing on your surface, you kind of reach this stagnation point.

1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:58.620
 But something like plate tectonics recycles material, you bring up new fresh material

1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:04.100
 from the interior, you bring down material that's up on the surface, and that can kind

1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:10.060
 of refresh your nutrient supply, in a sense, or the sort of raw materials that the surface

1:02:10.060 --> 1:02:11.980
 has to work with.

1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:19.580
 So from a kind of astrobiologist perspective, looking at Earth, you would see that recycling

1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:24.540
 of material because the plate tectonics, you would also see how much oxygen is in Earth's

1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:25.540
 atmosphere.

1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:30.820
 And between those two things, you would identify Earth as a reasonable candidate for a habitable

1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:35.780
 environment in addition to, of course, the, you know, pleasant temperature and liquid

1:02:35.780 --> 1:02:37.260
 water.

1:02:37.260 --> 1:02:41.780
 But the abundance of oxygen and the plate tectonics both play a role as well.

1:02:41.780 --> 1:02:45.180
 And also see like tiny dot satellites flying around and rockets.

1:02:45.180 --> 1:02:46.180
 Well, sure, yes.

1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:50.300
 I wonder if they would be able to, I really think about that, like, if aliens were to

1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:58.020
 visit, and would they really see humans as the thing they should be focusing on?

1:02:58.020 --> 1:03:00.220
 I think it would take a while, right?

1:03:00.220 --> 1:03:06.020
 Because it's so obvious that that should, because there's like so much incredible,

1:03:06.020 --> 1:03:10.180
 in terms of biomass, humans are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.

1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:15.060
 There's like ants, they would probably detect ants, right?

1:03:15.060 --> 1:03:19.140
 Or they probably would focus on the water and the fish because there's like a lot of

1:03:19.140 --> 1:03:20.140
 water.

1:03:20.140 --> 1:03:25.060
 I was surprised to learn that there's more species on land than there is in the sea.

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:29.420
 Like there's 90, I think 90 to 95% of the species are on land.

1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:30.420
 Or on land?

1:03:30.420 --> 1:03:31.420
 On land.

1:03:31.420 --> 1:03:32.420
 Not in the sea?

1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:33.420
 No.

1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:34.420
 Not in the sea.

1:03:34.420 --> 1:03:40.220
 Not in the sea, but no, the variety that like the branches created by evolution, apparently

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:45.580
 it's probably a good answer from evolutionary biology perspective, why land created so much

1:03:45.580 --> 1:03:46.980
 diversity, but it did.

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:53.660
 So like the sea, there's so much not known about the sea, about the oceans, but it's

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:57.580
 not, it's not diversity friendly.

1:03:57.580 --> 1:03:58.580
 What can I say?

1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:01.580
 It needs to improve its diversity.

1:04:01.580 --> 1:04:04.940
 Do you think the aliens would come, I mean, the first thing they would see is I suppose

1:04:04.940 --> 1:04:10.220
 our cities, assuming that they had some idea of what a natural world looked like, they

1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:13.580
 would see cities and say, these don't belong.

1:04:13.580 --> 1:04:15.820
 Which of these many species created these?

1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:16.820
 Yeah.

1:04:16.820 --> 1:04:21.620
 I mean, there's, if I were to guess, it would, it's a good question.

1:04:21.620 --> 1:04:27.620
 I don't know if you do this when you look at the telescope, whether you look at geometric

1:04:27.620 --> 1:04:28.620
 shapes.

1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:38.180
 Like if it's, cause to me like hard corners, like what do we think is engineered?

1:04:38.180 --> 1:04:42.500
 Things that are like, have kind of straight lines and corners and so on, they would probably

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:47.460
 detect those in terms of buildings would stand out to them because that's, that goes against

1:04:47.460 --> 1:04:52.420
 the basic natural physics of the world.

1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:58.220
 But I don't know if the electricity and lights and so on, it could be, I honestly, it could

1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:01.220
 be the plate tectonics.

1:05:01.220 --> 1:05:04.940
 It could be like, that they're like the volcanoes that'd be okay.

1:05:04.940 --> 1:05:05.940
 That's a source of heat.

1:05:05.940 --> 1:05:07.220
 And then they would focus.

1:05:07.220 --> 1:05:12.180
 They might literally, I mean, depending on how alien life forms are, they might notice

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:20.260
 the microorganisms before they notice the big, like notice the ant before the elephant.

1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:24.100
 Cause like there's a lot more of them depending what they're measuring.

1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:29.220
 We think like size matters, but maybe with their tools of measurement, they would look

1:05:29.220 --> 1:05:32.420
 for quantity versus size.

1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:36.980
 Like why focus on the big thing, focus on the thing that there's a lot of.

1:05:36.980 --> 1:05:40.640
 And when they see humans, depending on their measurement devices, they might see we're

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:43.760
 made up of billions of organisms.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:46.300
 Like the fact that we have, we're very human.

1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:49.940
 We think we're one organism, but that may not be the case.

1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:56.420
 They might see, in fact, they may also see like a human city as one organism.

1:05:56.420 --> 1:06:03.900
 Like what is this thing that like, clearly this organism gets aroused at night because

1:06:03.900 --> 1:06:11.500
 the lights go on and then, and then it like, it sleeps during the day.

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:16.380
 I don't know how, like the, what perspective you take on the city.

1:06:16.380 --> 1:06:20.500
 Is there something interesting about earth or other planets in terms of weather patterns?

1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:26.260
 So we talked a lot about volcanic patterns.

1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:32.980
 Is there something else about weather that's interesting, like storms or variations in

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:36.620
 temperature, all those kinds of things?

1:06:36.620 --> 1:06:38.480
 Yeah.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:45.180
 So there's sort of every planet and moon has a kind of interesting and unique weather pattern.

1:06:45.180 --> 1:06:50.820
 And those weather patterns are really, we don't have a good understanding of them.

1:06:50.820 --> 1:06:56.900
 We don't even have a good understanding of the global circulation patterns of many of

1:06:56.900 --> 1:07:00.560
 these atmospheres, why the storm systems occur.

1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:08.740
 So the composition and occurrence of storms and clouds and these objects is another one

1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:13.780
 of these kind of windows into the interior that I was talking about with surfaces.

1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:18.340
 One of these ways that we can get perspective and what the composition is at the interior

1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:20.380
 and how the circulation is working.

1:07:20.380 --> 1:07:26.660
 So circulation will bring some species up from deeper in the atmosphere of the planet

1:07:26.660 --> 1:07:30.640
 to some altitude that's a little bit colder and that species will condense out and form

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.620
 a cloud at that altitude.

1:07:32.620 --> 1:07:39.220
 And we can detect in some cases what those clouds are composed of.

1:07:39.220 --> 1:07:46.340
 But looking at where those occur can tell you how the circulation cells are, whether

1:07:46.340 --> 1:07:50.940
 the atmospheric circulation is, say, coming up at the equator and going down at the poles

1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:53.620
 or whether you have multiple cells in the atmosphere.

1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:57.940
 And I mean, Jupiter's atmosphere is just insane.

1:07:57.940 --> 1:07:58.940
 There's so much going on.

1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:02.900
 You look at these pictures and there's all these vortices and antivortices and you have

1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:09.200
 these different bands that are moving in opposite directions that may be giving you information

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:20.460
 about the deep, like deep in the atmosphere, physically deep properties of Jupiter's interior

1:08:20.460 --> 1:08:22.780
 and circulation.

1:08:22.780 --> 1:08:24.860
 What are these vortices?

1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:27.760
 What's the basic material of the storms?

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:30.100
 It's condensed molecules from the atmosphere.

1:08:30.100 --> 1:08:36.100
 So ammonia ice particles in the case of Jupiter, it's methane ice in the case of let's say

1:08:36.100 --> 1:08:40.940
 Uranus and Neptune and other species, you can kind of construct a chemical model for

1:08:40.940 --> 1:08:42.780
 which species can condense where.

1:08:42.780 --> 1:08:47.180
 And so you see a cloud at a certain altitude within the atmosphere and you can make a guess

1:08:47.180 --> 1:08:51.900
 at what that cloud is made of and sometimes measure it directly and different species

1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:53.900
 make different colors as well.

1:08:53.900 --> 1:08:55.220
 Oh, cool.

1:08:55.220 --> 1:08:56.220
 Ice storms.

1:08:56.220 --> 1:08:57.220
 Okay.

1:08:57.220 --> 1:09:02.260
 I mean, the climate of Uranus has always been fascinating to me because it orbits on its

1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:07.420
 side and it has a 42 year orbital period.

1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:11.620
 And so, you know, with Earth, our seasons are because our equator is tipped just a little

1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:13.100
 bit to the plane that we orbit in.

1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:16.240
 So sometimes the sunlight's a little bit above the equator and sometimes it's a little bit

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:17.240
 below the equator.

1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:22.940
 But on Uranus, it's like for 10 years, the sunlight is directly on the North Pole and

1:09:22.940 --> 1:09:26.900
 then it's directly on the equator and then it's directly on the South Pole.

1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:33.460
 And it's actually kind of amazing that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier than it does.

1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:38.500
 But understanding how, taking again, like one of these extreme examples, if we can understand

1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:43.580
 why that atmosphere behaves in the way it does, it's kind of a test of our understanding

1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.820
 of how atmosphere is.

1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:55.540
 So like heats up one side of the planet for 10 years and then freezes it the next, like,

1:09:55.540 --> 1:10:00.480
 and that you're saying should probably lead to some chaos.

1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:01.480
 And it doesn't.

1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:04.860
 The fact that it doesn't tells you something about the atmosphere.

1:10:04.860 --> 1:10:08.440
 So atmospheres have a property that surfaces don't have, which is that they can redistribute

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:09.900
 heat a lot more effectively.

1:10:09.900 --> 1:10:10.900
 Right.

1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:15.780
 So they have a stabilizing, like self regulating aspect to them that they're able to deal with

1:10:15.780 --> 1:10:19.700
 extreme conditions.

1:10:19.700 --> 1:10:27.260
 But predicting how that complex system unrolls is very difficult, as we know, about predicting

1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:28.260
 the weather on Earth even.

1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:29.260
 Oh, my goodness.

1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:30.260
 Yeah.

1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:31.260
 Even with the little variation we have on Earth.

1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:35.100
 You know, people have tried to put together global circulation models.

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.300
 You know, we've done this for Earth.

1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:38.740
 People have tried to do these for other planets as well.

1:10:38.740 --> 1:10:41.820
 And it is a really hard problem.

1:10:41.820 --> 1:10:45.820
 So Titan, for example, like I said, it's one of the best studied atmospheres in the solar

1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:50.540
 system, and people have tried to make these global circulation models and actually predict

1:10:50.540 --> 1:10:55.060
 what's going to happen moving into sort of the next season of Titan.

1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:57.060
 And those predictions have ended up being wrong.

1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:00.780
 And so then, you know, I don't know, it's always exciting when a prediction is wrong

1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:06.020
 because it means that there's something more to learn, like your theory wasn't sufficient.

1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:09.620
 And then you get to go back and learn something by how you have to modify the theory to make

1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:11.900
 it fit.

1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:15.980
 I'm excited by the possibility of one day there will be for various moons and planets,

1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:22.500
 there will be like news programs reporting the weather with the fake confidence of like

1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:25.700
 as if you can predict the weather.

1:11:25.700 --> 1:11:28.580
 We talked quite a bit about planets and moons.

1:11:28.580 --> 1:11:31.780
 Can we talk a little bit about asteroids?

1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:32.780
 For sure.

1:11:32.780 --> 1:11:34.580
 What is, what's an asteroid?

1:11:34.580 --> 1:11:36.940
 And what kind of asteroids are there?

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:41.860
 So the asteroids, let's talk about just the restricted to the main asteroid belt, which

1:11:41.860 --> 1:11:49.580
 is the region, it's a region of debris basically between Mars and Jupiter.

1:11:49.580 --> 1:11:57.620
 And the, these sort of belts of debris throughout the solar system, the outer solar system,

1:11:57.620 --> 1:12:01.780
 you know, the Kuiper belt that we talked about, the asteroid belt, as well as certain other

1:12:01.780 --> 1:12:08.740
 populations where they accumulate because they're gravitationally more favored, are

1:12:08.740 --> 1:12:11.620
 remnant objects from the origin of the solar system.

1:12:11.620 --> 1:12:17.620
 And so one of the reasons that we are so interested in them, aside from potentially the fact that

1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:27.820
 they could come hit Earth, but scientifically it's, it gives us a window into understanding

1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:34.620
 the composition of the material from which Earth and the other planets formed and how

1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:40.000
 that material was kind of redistributed over the history of the solar system.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.200
 So the asteroids, one could classify them in two different ways.

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:45.980
 Some of them are ancient objects.

1:12:45.980 --> 1:12:54.540
 So they accreted out of the sort of disc of material that the whole solar system formed

1:12:54.540 --> 1:13:02.500
 out of and have kind of remained ever since more or less the same.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:06.300
 They've probably collided with each other and we see the, all these collisional fragments

1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:13.120
 and you can actually look and based on their orbits say, you know, like these 50 objects

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:16.300
 originated as the same object.

1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:22.620
 You can see them kind of dynamically moving apart after some big collision.

1:13:22.620 --> 1:13:26.120
 And so some of them are these ancient objects maybe that have undergone collisions.

1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:30.500
 And then there's this other category of object that is the one that I personally find really

1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:38.560
 interesting which is remnants of objects that could have been planets.

1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:45.540
 So early on a bunch of potential planets accreted that we call planetesimals and they formed

1:13:45.540 --> 1:13:49.180
 and they formed with a lot of energy and they had enough time to actually differentiate.

1:13:49.180 --> 1:13:53.560
 So some of these objects differentiated into cores and mantles and crests.

1:13:53.560 --> 1:14:00.720
 And then they were subsequently disrupted in these massive collisions and they, now

1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:05.140
 we have these fragments, we think fragments floating around the asteroid belt that are

1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:08.740
 like bits of mantle, bits of core, bits of crest basically.

1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:14.820
 So it's like puzzle pieces that you might be able to stitch together or I guess it's

1:14:14.820 --> 1:14:22.480
 all mixed up so you can't stitch together the original planet candidates or is that

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:28.900
 possible to try to see if they kind of, I mean, there's too many objects in there to.

1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:33.780
 I think that there are cases where people have kind of looked at objects and by looking

1:14:33.780 --> 1:14:37.620
 at their orbits, they say these objects should have originated together, but they have very

1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:39.620
 different compositions.

1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:44.340
 And so then you can hypothesize maybe they were different fragments of a differentiated

1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:45.340
 object.

1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:49.620
 But one of the really cool things about this is, you know, we've been talking about getting

1:14:49.620 --> 1:14:52.620
 clues into the interiors of planets.

1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:57.580
 We've never seen a planetary core or deep mantle directly.

1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:01.780
 Some mantle material comes up on our surface and then we can see it, but, you know, sort

1:15:01.780 --> 1:15:03.800
 of in bulk.

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:08.220
 We haven't seen these things directly and these asteroids potentially give us a chance

1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:14.060
 to like look at what our own core and mantle is like, or at least would be like if it had

1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:18.980
 been also floating through space for a few billion years and getting irradiated and all

1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:19.980
 that.

1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:26.020
 But it's a cool potential window or like analogy into the interior of our own planet.

1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:30.660
 Well, how do you begin studying some of these asteroids?

1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:33.980
 What if you were to put together a study, like what are the interesting questions to

1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:37.140
 ask that are a little bit more specific?

1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:43.860
 Do you find a favorite asteroid that could be tracked and try to track it through telescopes?

1:15:43.860 --> 1:15:51.780
 Or do you, is it has to be, do you have to land on those things to study it?

1:15:51.780 --> 1:15:58.060
 So when it comes to the asteroids, there are so many of them and the big pictures or the

1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:08.140
 big questions are answered, so some questions can be answered by zooming in in detail on

1:16:08.140 --> 1:16:11.940
 individual object, but mostly you're trying to do a statistical study.

1:16:11.940 --> 1:16:18.300
 So you want to look at thousands of objects, even hundreds of thousands of objects and

1:16:18.300 --> 1:16:25.620
 figure out what their composition is and look at, you know, how many big asteroids there

1:16:25.620 --> 1:16:29.380
 are of this composition versus how many small asteroids of this other composition and put

1:16:29.380 --> 1:16:34.180
 together these kinds of statistical properties of the asteroid belt.

1:16:34.180 --> 1:16:40.160
 And those properties can be directly compared with the results of simulations for the formation

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:42.300
 of the solar system.

1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:50.620
 What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids or the contents of the insides of asteroids

1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:52.960
 and what are still open questions?

1:16:52.960 --> 1:17:00.340
 So I would say that we don't know a whole lot about their compositions.

1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:07.220
 Most of them are small and so you can't study them in such detail with telescopes as you

1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:11.780
 could, you know, a planet or moon and at the same time, because there are so many of them,

1:17:11.780 --> 1:17:17.500
 you could send a spacecraft to a few, but you can't really like get a statistical survey

1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:18.500
 with spacecraft.

1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:24.260
 And so a lot of what we, a lot of what has been done comes down to sort of classification.

1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:31.060
 You look at how bright they are, you look at whether they're red or blue, simply, you

1:17:31.060 --> 1:17:35.180
 know, whether their spectrum is sloped towards long wavelengths or short wavelengths.

1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:41.740
 There are certain, if you point a spectrograph at their surfaces, there are certain features

1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:42.740
 you can see.

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:46.900
 So you can tell that some of them have silicates on them.

1:17:46.900 --> 1:17:50.100
 But these are the sort of, they're pretty basic questions.

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:55.380
 We're still trying to classify them based on fairly basic information in kind of combination

1:17:55.380 --> 1:17:59.520
 with our general understanding of the material the solar system formed from.

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:03.380
 And so you're sort of, you're coming in with prior knowledge, which is that you more or

1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:06.540
 less know what the materials are the solar system formed from, and then you're trying

1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:09.540
 to classify them into these categories.

1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:17.140
 There's still a huge amount of room for understanding them better and for understanding how their

1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:20.180
 surfaces are changing in the space environment.

1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:23.100
 Is it hard to land on an asteroid?

1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:26.100
 Is this a dumb question?

1:18:26.100 --> 1:18:36.300
 It feels like it would be quite difficult to actually operate a spacecraft in such a

1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:38.180
 dense field of debris.

1:18:38.180 --> 1:18:44.100
 Oh, the asteroid belt, there's a ton of material there, but it's actually not that dense.

1:18:44.100 --> 1:18:47.100
 It is mostly open space.

1:18:47.100 --> 1:18:51.540
 So mentally do picture like mostly open space with some rocks.

1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:54.660
 The problem is some of them are not thought to be solid.

1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:58.480
 So some of these asteroids, especially these, these core mantle fragments, you can think

1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:04.500
 of as sort of solid like a planet, but some of them are just kind of aggregates of material.

1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:06.680
 We call them rubble piles.

1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:08.660
 And so there's not necessarily.

1:19:08.660 --> 1:19:15.780
 Might look like a rock, but do a lot of them have kind of clouds around them, like a dust

1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:22.900
 cloud thing, or like, do you know what you're stepping on when you try to land on it?

1:19:22.900 --> 1:19:26.180
 Like what are we supposed to be visualizing here?

1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:29.100
 This is like very few have water, right?

1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:32.700
 There's some water in the outer part of the asteroid belt, but they're not quite like

1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:37.300
 comets in the sense of having clouds around them.

1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:41.180
 There are some crazy asteroids that do become active like comets.

1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:45.820
 That's the whole other category of thing that we don't understand.

1:19:45.820 --> 1:19:50.460
 But their surfaces, I mean, we have visited some, you can find pictures that spacecraft

1:19:50.460 --> 1:19:51.460
 have taken of them.

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:54.700
 We've actually scooped up material off of the surface of some of these objects.

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:58.780
 We're bringing it back to analyze it in the lab.

1:19:58.780 --> 1:20:04.380
 And there's a mission that's launching next year to land on one of these supposedly core

1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:09.780
 fragment objects to try to figure out what the heck it is and what's going on with it.

1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:16.420
 But the surfaces, you know, they're, they're, you can picture a solid surface with some

1:20:16.420 --> 1:20:23.340
 little grains of sand or pebbles on it and occasional boulders, maybe some fine dusty

1:20:23.340 --> 1:20:28.020
 regions, dust kind of collecting in certain places.

1:20:28.020 --> 1:20:30.580
 Is there this, do you worry about this?

1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:41.320
 Is there any chance that one of these fellas destroys all of human civilization by an asteroid

1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:45.780
 kind of colliding with something, changing its trajectory and then heading its way towards

1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:47.460
 earth?

1:20:47.460 --> 1:20:49.420
 That is definitely possible.

1:20:49.420 --> 1:20:54.260
 And it doesn't even have to necessarily collide with something and change its trajectory.

1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:56.020
 We're not tracking all of them.

1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:57.860
 We can't track all of them yet.

1:20:57.860 --> 1:21:01.820
 You know, there's still a lot of them.

1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:05.300
 People are, people are tracking a lot of them and we are doing our best to track more of

1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:06.300
 them.

1:21:06.300 --> 1:21:09.540
 But there are a lot of them out there and it would be potentially catastrophic if one

1:21:09.540 --> 1:21:11.260
 of them impacted earth.

1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:16.980
 Have you, are you aware of this Apophis object?

1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:23.140
 So there's an asteroid, a near earth object called Apophis that people thought had a decent

1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:28.840
 probability of hitting earth in 2029 and then potentially again in 2036.

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:29.940
 So they did a lot of studies.

1:21:29.940 --> 1:21:35.060
 It's not actually going to hit earth, but it is going to come very close.

1:21:35.060 --> 1:21:40.780
 It's going to be visible in the sky in a relatively dark, I mean, not even that dark, probably

1:21:40.780 --> 1:21:50.580
 not visible from Los Angeles, but, and it's going to come a 10th of the way between the

1:21:50.580 --> 1:21:51.740
 earth and the moon.

1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:55.940
 It's going to come closer apparently than some geosynchronous communication satellites.

1:21:55.940 --> 1:21:56.940
 Oh wow.

1:21:56.940 --> 1:22:02.660
 So that is a close call, but people have studied it and apparently are very confident it's

1:22:02.660 --> 1:22:04.300
 not actually going to hit us, but it was.

1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:08.540
 I'm going to have to look into this because I'm very sure, I'm very sure what's going

1:22:08.540 --> 1:22:13.100
 to happen if an asteroid actually hits earth.

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:23.300
 That the scientific community and government will confidently say that, uh, we have nothing

1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:24.300
 to worry about.

1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:26.340
 It's going to be a close call.

1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:30.420
 And then last minute they'll be like, there was a miscalculation.

1:22:30.420 --> 1:22:31.420
 They're not lying.

1:22:31.420 --> 1:22:35.300
 It's just like the space of possibilities, because it's very difficult to track these

1:22:35.300 --> 1:22:40.500
 kinds of things and there's a lot of kind of, um, there's complexities involved in this.

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:46.340
 There's a lot of uncertainties that I just, something tells me that human civilization

1:22:46.340 --> 1:22:49.540
 will end with, we'll see it coming.

1:22:49.540 --> 1:22:54.020
 And then last minute there'll be a, oops, we'll like, we'll see it coming and we'll,

1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:57.740
 it'll be like, no, it's just, it's just threatening, but no problem.

1:22:57.740 --> 1:22:58.740
 No problem.

1:22:58.740 --> 1:23:01.140
 And last minute it'll be like, oops, that was a miscalculation.

1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:10.380
 And it's all over in a matter of like a week, or just very positive and optimistic today.

1:23:10.380 --> 1:23:16.380
 Is there any chance that Bruce Willis can save us in the sense that from what you know

1:23:16.380 --> 1:23:24.460
 about asteroids, is there something that, um, you can catch them early enough to, uh,

1:23:24.460 --> 1:23:31.660
 change volcanic, uh, eruptions, right, um, sort of drill, put a nuclear weapon inside

1:23:31.660 --> 1:23:37.180
 and break up the asteroid or change its trajectory?

1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:38.980
 There is potential for that.

1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:48.180
 If you catch it early enough in advance, um, I think in theory, if you knew five years

1:23:48.180 --> 1:23:56.380
 in advance, um, depending on the objects and how close, how much you would need to deflect

1:23:56.380 --> 1:24:00.620
 it, um, you could deflect it a little bit.

1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:04.100
 I don't know that it would be sufficient in all cases.

1:24:04.100 --> 1:24:09.500
 Um, and this is definitely not my specific area of expertise, but my understanding is

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:11.980
 that there is something you could do.

1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:17.460
 Um, but it also, how you would carry that out depends a lot on the properties of the

1:24:17.460 --> 1:24:18.460
 asteroid.

1:24:18.460 --> 1:24:20.220
 If it's a solid object versus a rubble pile.

1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:26.980
 So let's say you planted some bomb in the middle of it and it blew up, but it was just

1:24:26.980 --> 1:24:28.940
 kind of a pile of material anyway.

1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:33.420
 And then that material comes back together and then you kind of just have the same thing.

1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:38.620
 Presumably its trajectory would be altered, but it's, it's like a terminator too.

1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:43.120
 When it's like the thing that just like you shoot it in splashes and then comes back together

1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.940
 will be very useless.

1:24:44.940 --> 1:24:45.940
 That's fascinating.

1:24:45.940 --> 1:24:48.580
 It was fascinating.

1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:56.860
 I've gotten a lot of hope from watching, uh, uh, SpaceX rockets that land.

1:24:56.860 --> 1:24:57.940
 There's so much.

1:24:57.940 --> 1:24:58.940
 It's like, Oh wow.

1:24:58.940 --> 1:25:06.140
 From an AI perspective, from a robotics perspective, wow, we can do a hell of an amazing job with

1:25:06.140 --> 1:25:09.380
 control.

1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:15.140
 And but then we have an understanding about surfaces here on earth, we can map up a lot

1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:16.140
 of things.

1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:17.140
 I wonder if we can do that.

1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:23.740
 Some kind of detail of being able to have that same level of precision in landing on

1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:31.940
 surfaces with as wide of a variety as asteroids have to be able to understand the exact properties

1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:37.620
 of the surface and be able to encode that into whatever rocket that lands sufficiently

1:25:37.620 --> 1:25:44.580
 to, I presume humans, unlike the, unlike the movies, humans would likely get in the way.

1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:52.900
 Like it should all be done by robots and like land drill, place the, the explosive that

1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:56.580
 should all be done through control, the robots.

1:25:56.580 --> 1:26:01.080
 And then you should be able to dynamically adjust to, um, to the surface.

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.620
 The flip side of that for a robotics person, I don't know if you've seen these, it's been

1:26:05.620 --> 1:26:07.100
 very heartbreaking.

1:26:07.100 --> 1:26:14.060
 Uh, somebody I know well, Russ Tedrick at MIT led the DARPA robotics challenge team for

1:26:14.060 --> 1:26:15.980
 the humanoid robot challenge for DARPA.

1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:20.460
 I don't know if you've seen videos of robots on two feet falling, but you're talking about

1:26:20.460 --> 1:26:24.740
 millions, you know, several years of work from with some of the most brilliant roboticists

1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:27.060
 in the world, millions of dollars.

1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:31.140
 And the final thing is a highlight video on YouTube of robots falling, but they had a

1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:33.800
 lot of trouble with uneven surfaces.

1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:38.420
 That's basically what you have to do with, uh, the challenge involves you're mostly autonomous

1:26:38.420 --> 1:26:43.300
 with some partial human communication, but that human communication is broken up.

1:26:43.300 --> 1:26:48.700
 Like you don't get a, you get a noisy channel, so you can, humans can, which is very similar

1:26:48.700 --> 1:26:54.860
 to what it would be like in humans remotely operating a thing on an asteroid.

1:26:54.860 --> 1:26:57.420
 And so with that, robots really struggled.

1:26:57.420 --> 1:27:03.300
 There's some hilarious painful videos of like a robot, not able to like open the door.

1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:07.640
 And then it tries to open the door without like, it misses the handle and in doing so

1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:12.020
 like falls, I mean, it's, um, it's painful to watch.

1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:15.740
 So like that, there's that, and then there's SpaceX.

1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:21.780
 So I have hope from SpaceX and then I have less hope from bipedal robotics, um, but it's

1:27:21.780 --> 1:27:22.780
 fun.

1:27:22.780 --> 1:27:23.900
 It's fun to kind of imagine.

1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:28.420
 And I think the planetary side of it comes into play in understanding the surfaces of

1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:34.540
 these asteroids more and more that, you know, forget sort of destruction of human civilization.

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:39.100
 It'd be cool to have like spacecraft just landing on all these asteroids to study them

1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:44.940
 at scale and being able to figure out dynamically what, you know, whether it's a rubble pile

1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:51.660
 or whether it's, um, a solid objects, like, do you see that kind of future of science?

1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:57.860
 Maybe a hundred, 200, 300 years from now, where there's just robots expanding out through

1:27:57.860 --> 1:28:00.800
 the solar system, like sensors, essentially.

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:04.260
 Some of it taking pictures from a distance, some of them landing, just exploring and giving

1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:05.260
 us data.

1:28:05.260 --> 1:28:10.580
 Cause it feels like we're working with very little data right now.

1:28:10.580 --> 1:28:14.420
 Sure I, I do see exploration going that way.

1:28:14.420 --> 1:28:23.340
 I think, um, the way that NASA is currently or historically has been doing missions is

1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:28.140
 putting together these, these really large missions that do a lot of things and are extremely

1:28:28.140 --> 1:28:30.500
 well tested and have a very low rate of failure.

1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:38.840
 But now that, um, these sort of CubeSat technologies are, are becoming easier to build, easier

1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:41.700
 to launch, they're, they're very cheap.

1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.980
 And you know, NASA is getting involved in this as well.

1:28:43.980 --> 1:28:48.960
 There's, there's a lot of interest in these missions that are relatively small, relatively

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:50.580
 cheap and just do one thing.

1:28:50.580 --> 1:28:54.160
 So you can really optimize it to just do this one thing.

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.140
 And maybe you could build a hundred of them and send them to different asteroids.

1:28:57.140 --> 1:29:01.100
 And they would just collect this one piece of information from each asteroid.

1:29:01.100 --> 1:29:06.700
 It's a kind of different, more distributed way of doing science, I guess.

1:29:06.700 --> 1:29:11.160
 And there's a ton of potential there, I agree.

1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:17.220
 Let me ask you about objects or one particular object from outside our solar system.

1:29:17.220 --> 1:29:19.660
 We don't get to study many of these, right?

1:29:19.660 --> 1:29:24.580
 They don't, we don't get stuff that just flies in out of nowhere from outside the solar system

1:29:24.580 --> 1:29:25.580
 and flies through.

1:29:25.580 --> 1:29:30.460
 Apparently there's been two recently in the past few years.

1:29:30.460 --> 1:29:34.540
 One of them is Amuamua.

1:29:34.540 --> 1:29:37.340
 What are your thoughts about Amuamua?

1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:38.340
 So fun to say.

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:44.260
 Could it, could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization or is it just a weird shaped

1:29:44.260 --> 1:29:45.260
 comet?

1:29:45.260 --> 1:29:49.540
 I like the way that's phrased.

1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:53.540
 Um, so Amuamua is, is a fascinating object.

1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:57.380
 Just the fact that we have started discovering things that are coming in from outside our

1:29:57.380 --> 1:30:01.980
 solar system is amazing and can, can start to study them.

1:30:01.980 --> 1:30:09.340
 And now that we have seen some, we can design now kind of thinking in advance.

1:30:09.340 --> 1:30:11.980
 The next time we see one, we will be much more ready for it.

1:30:11.980 --> 1:30:14.140
 We will know which telescopes we want to point at it.

1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:18.660
 We will have explored whether we could even launch a fast turnaround mission to actually

1:30:18.660 --> 1:30:23.540
 like get to it before it leaves the solar system.

1:30:23.540 --> 1:30:30.460
 In terms of Amuamua, yeah, it's, for an object in our solar system, it's really unusual in

1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:33.820
 two particular ways.

1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:38.860
 One is the dimensions that we don't see natural things in our solar system that are kind of

1:30:38.860 --> 1:30:39.980
 long and skinny.

1:30:39.980 --> 1:30:45.820
 We see, the things we see in our solar system don't deviate from spherical by that much.

1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:50.540
 And then that it showed these strange properties of accelerating as it was leaving the solar

1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:53.380
 system, which was not understood at first.

1:30:53.380 --> 1:31:03.180
 So in terms of the alien space junk, you know, as a scientist, I cannot rule out that possibility.

1:31:03.180 --> 1:31:05.540
 I have no evidence to the contrary.

1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:06.540
 Um, however,

1:31:06.540 --> 1:31:10.460
 See, you're saying there's a chance.

1:31:10.460 --> 1:31:16.580
 I cannot, I cannot, as a scientist, honestly say that I can rule out that it's alien space

1:31:16.580 --> 1:31:17.580
 junk.

1:31:17.580 --> 1:31:26.640
 However, I see the kind of alien explanation as following this, the Sagan's extraordinary

1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:29.200
 claims require extraordinary evidence.

1:31:29.200 --> 1:31:37.580
 If you are going to actually claim that something is aliens, you need to carefully evaluate,

1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:43.260
 everyone needs to carefully evaluate the other options and see whether it could just be something

1:31:43.260 --> 1:31:45.260
 that we know exists that makes sense.

1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:53.660
 In the case of Oumuamua, there are explanations that fit well within our understanding of

1:31:53.660 --> 1:31:54.660
 how things work.

1:31:54.660 --> 1:31:59.340
 So there are a couple, there are two hypotheses for what it could be made of.

1:31:59.340 --> 1:32:02.140
 They're both basically just ice shards.

1:32:02.140 --> 1:32:05.940
 In one case, it's a nitrogen ice shard that came off of something like Pluto in another

1:32:05.940 --> 1:32:10.980
 solar system, that Pluto got hit with something and broke up into pieces, and one of those

1:32:10.980 --> 1:32:13.320
 pieces came through our solar system.

1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:19.540
 In the other scenario, it's a bit of a failed solar system.

1:32:19.540 --> 1:32:24.820
 So our solar system formed out of a collapsing molecular cloud.

1:32:24.820 --> 1:32:29.660
 Sometimes those molecular clouds are not massive enough, and they sort of collapse into bits,

1:32:29.660 --> 1:32:33.180
 but they don't actually form a solar system, but you end up with these kind of chunks of

1:32:33.180 --> 1:32:35.100
 hydrogen ice, apparently.

1:32:35.100 --> 1:32:38.860
 And so one of those chunks of hydrogen ice could have got ejected and passed through

1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:39.860
 our solar system.

1:32:39.860 --> 1:32:45.780
 So both cases explain these properties in about the same way.

1:32:45.780 --> 1:32:50.720
 So those ices will sublimate once they've passed the sun, and so as they're moving away

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:55.860
 from the sun, you have the hydrogen or nitrogen ice sublimating off the sunward part of it,

1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:58.940
 and so that is responsible for the acceleration.

1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:04.760
 The shape also, because you have all this ice sublimating off the surface, if you take

1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:11.220
 something, the analogy that works pretty well here is for a bar of soap.

1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:17.140
 Your bar of soap starts out sort of close to spherical, at least from a physicist perspective,

1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:21.380
 and as you use it over time, you eventually end up with this long, thin shard because

1:33:21.380 --> 1:33:28.100
 it's been just by sort of weathering, as we would call it.

1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:32.320
 And so in the same way, if you just sublimate material off of one of these ice shards, it

1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:37.020
 ends up long and thin, and it ends up accelerating out of the solar system.

1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:43.380
 And so given that these properties can be reasonably well explained that way, we should

1:33:43.380 --> 1:33:47.380
 be extremely skeptical about attributing things to aliens.

1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:54.060
 See, the reason I like to think that it's aliens is because it puts a lot of priority

1:33:54.060 --> 1:34:00.020
 on us not being lazy and we need to catch this thing next time it comes around.

1:34:00.020 --> 1:34:06.420
 I like the idea that there's objects, it almost saddens me, they come out of the darkness

1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:10.620
 really fast and just fly by and go and leave.

1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:16.260
 It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to study them.

1:34:16.260 --> 1:34:22.540
 It's the easiest way to do space travel outside of the solar system is having the things come

1:34:22.540 --> 1:34:23.540
 to us.

1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:24.540
 Right?

1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:25.540
 I like that way of putting it.

1:34:25.540 --> 1:34:28.880
 And it would be nice to just land on it.

1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:36.620
 And first of all, really importantly, detect it early and then land on it with a really

1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:47.500
 nice spacecraft and study the hell out of it.

1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:56.740
 If there's a chance it's aliens, alien life, it just feels like such a cheap way, inexpensive

1:34:56.740 --> 1:35:03.180
 way to get information about alien life or something interesting that's out there.

1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:08.300
 And I'm not sure if an ice shard from another planetary system will be interesting, but

1:35:08.300 --> 1:35:09.300
 it very well could be.

1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:11.440
 It could be totally new sets of materials.

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:16.660
 It could be, tell us about composition of planets we don't quite understand.

1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:19.620
 And it's just nice when, especially in the case of a Moa Moa, I guess it was pretty

1:35:19.620 --> 1:35:20.620
 close to earth.

1:35:20.620 --> 1:35:30.260
 It would have been nice to, don't go there, they come to us, I don't know.

1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:31.420
 That's what makes me quite sad.

1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:32.420
 It's a missed opportunity.

1:35:32.420 --> 1:35:34.060
 Well, yeah.

1:35:34.060 --> 1:35:39.100
 And whether you think it's aliens or not, it's a missed opportunity, but we weren't

1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:44.380
 prepared and we will be prepared for the next ones.

1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:49.140
 So there's been a movement in astronomy more towards what's called time domain astronomy.

1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:53.060
 So kind of monitoring the whole sky all the time at all wavelengths.

1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:54.060
 That's kind of the goal.

1:35:54.060 --> 1:35:58.020
 And so we expect to detect many more of these in the future, even though these were the

1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:02.020
 first two we saw, our potential to detect them is only increasing with time.

1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:09.260
 And so there will be more opportunities and based on these two, we now can actually sit

1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:11.860
 and think about what we'll do when the next one shows up.

1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:16.740
 I also, what it made me realize, I know I didn't really think through this, but it made

1:36:16.740 --> 1:36:21.820
 me realize if there is alien civilizations out there, the thing we're most likely to

1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:24.660
 see first would be space junk.

1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:28.300
 My stupid understanding of it.

1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:34.400
 And the second would be really dumb kind of, you could think of maybe like relay nodes

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:41.980
 or something objects that you need to have a whole lot of for particular purposes of

1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:44.300
 like space travel and so on.

1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:49.180
 Like a speed limit signs or something, I don't know, whatever we have on earth, a lot of

1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:50.180
 that's dumb.

1:36:50.180 --> 1:36:52.660
 It's not alien aliens in themselves.

1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:57.500
 It's like artifacts that are useful to the engineering in the systems that are engineered

1:36:57.500 --> 1:36:59.300
 by alien civilizations.

1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:05.600
 So like it would, we would see a lot of stuff in terms of setting, in terms of looking for

1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:08.140
 alien life and trying to communicate with it.

1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:17.540
 Maybe we should be looking not for like smart creatures or systems to communicate with.

1:37:17.540 --> 1:37:23.540
 Maybe we should be looking for artifacts or even as dumb as like space junk.

1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:29.340
 It just kind of reframed my perspective of like, what are we looking for as signs?

1:37:29.340 --> 1:37:34.060
 Cause there could be a lot of stuff that doesn't have intelligence, but gives us really strong

1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:37.820
 signs that there's somewhere is life or intelligent life.

1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:44.460
 And yeah, that made me kind of, I know it might be dumb to say, but reframe the kind

1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:46.940
 of thing that we should be looking for.

1:37:46.940 --> 1:37:48.640
 Yeah.

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:53.100
 So the benefit of looking for intelligent life is that we perhaps have a better chance

1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:56.260
 of recognizing it.

1:37:56.260 --> 1:38:01.500
 We couldn't necessarily recognize what an alien stop sign look like.

1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:07.080
 And maybe the theorists are the people who sort of model and try to understand slow system

1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:10.220
 objects are pretty good at coming up with models for anything.

1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:15.500
 I mean, maybe a mua mua was a stop sign, but we're clever enough that we could come up

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:18.220
 with some physical explanations for it.

1:38:18.220 --> 1:38:22.580
 And then we all want to go with the simplest possible, we all want to believe the sort

1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:25.580
 of most skeptical possible explanation.

1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:29.460
 And so we missed it because we're too good at coming up with alternate explanations for

1:38:29.460 --> 1:38:30.460
 things.

1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:35.820
 And it's such an outlier, such a rare phenomenon that we can't study a hundred or a thousand

1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:36.820
 of these objects.

1:38:36.820 --> 1:38:38.140
 We have to, we had just one.

1:38:38.140 --> 1:38:43.620
 And so the science almost destroys the possibility of something special being there.

1:38:43.620 --> 1:38:48.500
 It's like Johnny Ive, this designer of Apple, I don't know if you know who that is.

1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:49.500
 He's the lead designer.

1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:53.260
 He's the person who designed the iPhone and all the major things.

1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:58.260
 And he talked about, he's brilliant, one of my favorite humans on earth and one of the

1:38:58.260 --> 1:39:02.140
 best designers in the history of earth.

1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:07.380
 He talked about like when he had this origins of an idea, like in his baby stages, he would

1:39:07.380 --> 1:39:11.900
 not tell Steve Jobs because Steve would usually like trample all over it.

1:39:11.900 --> 1:39:14.060
 He would say, this is a dumb idea.

1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:19.860
 And so I sometimes think of the scientific community in that sense, because the weapon

1:39:19.860 --> 1:39:26.540
 of the scientific method is so strong at its best that it sometimes crushes the out of

1:39:26.540 --> 1:39:30.580
 the box outlier evidence.

1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:35.020
 We don't get a lot of that evidence because we don't have, we're not lucky enough to have

1:39:35.020 --> 1:39:36.020
 a lot of evidence.

1:39:36.020 --> 1:39:42.780
 So we have to deal with just special cases and special cases could present an inkling

1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:46.900
 of something much bigger, but the scientific method user tramples all over it.

1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:52.260
 And it's hard to know what to do with that because the scientific method works, but at

1:39:52.260 --> 1:39:54.780
 the same time, every once in a while, it's like a balance.

1:39:54.780 --> 1:40:00.380
 You have to do 99% of the time, you have to do like scientific rigor, but every once in

1:40:00.380 --> 1:40:06.300
 a while, this is not you saying, me saying, smoke some weed and sit back and think, I

1:40:06.300 --> 1:40:09.300
 wonder, you know, it's the Joe Rogan thing.

1:40:09.300 --> 1:40:13.980
 It's entirely possible that it's alien space junk.

1:40:13.980 --> 1:40:14.980
 Anyway.

1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:15.980
 Yeah.

1:40:15.980 --> 1:40:16.980
 I think so.

1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:18.380
 I completely agree.

1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:23.580
 And I think that most scientists do speculate about these things.

1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:28.540
 It's just at what point do you act on those things?

1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:33.060
 So you're right that the scientific method has inherent skepticism, and for the most

1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:39.220
 part, that's a good thing because it means that we're not just believing crazy things

1:40:39.220 --> 1:40:41.540
 all the time.

1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:50.040
 But it's an interesting point that requiring that high level of rigor occasionally means

1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:56.540
 that you will miss something that is truly interesting because you needed to verify it

1:40:56.540 --> 1:40:58.620
 three times and it wasn't verifiable.

1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:03.340
 I also think like when you communicate with the general public, I think there's power

1:41:03.340 --> 1:41:10.500
 in that 1% speculation of just demonstrating authenticity as a human being, as a curious

1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:12.540
 human being.

1:41:12.540 --> 1:41:18.940
 I think too often, I think this is changing, but I saw, I've been quite disappointed in

1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:23.160
 my colleagues throughout 2020 with the coronavirus.

1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:28.980
 There's too much speaking from authority as opposed to speaking from curiosity.

1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:32.860
 There's some of the most incredible science has been done in 2020, especially on the virology

1:41:32.860 --> 1:41:34.940
 biology side.

1:41:34.940 --> 1:41:41.860
 And the kind of being talked down to by scientists is always really disappointing to me as opposed

1:41:41.860 --> 1:41:42.860
 to inspiring.

1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:47.820
 Like the things we, there's a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus, but we know a lot of

1:41:47.820 --> 1:41:54.060
 this stuff and we speak from scientists from various disciplines, speak from data in the

1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:56.500
 face of that uncertainty.

1:41:56.500 --> 1:41:58.740
 And we're curious, we don't know what the hell is going on.

1:41:58.740 --> 1:42:02.680
 We don't know if this virus is going to evolve, mutate.

1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:07.900
 We don't know if this virus or the next one might destroy all human civilization.

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:08.980
 You can't speak with certainty.

1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:16.620
 In fact, I was on a survey paper about masks, something I don't talk much about because

1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:22.020
 I don't like politics, but we don't know if masks work, but there's a lot of evidence

1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:24.140
 to show that they work for this particular virus.

1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:27.780
 The transmission of the virus is fascinating actually.

1:42:27.780 --> 1:42:33.480
 The biomechanics of the way viruses spread is fascinating.

1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:36.340
 If it wasn't destructive, it would be beautiful.

1:42:36.340 --> 1:42:42.180
 And we don't know, but it's inspiring to apply the scientific method to the best of our ability,

1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:47.300
 but also to show that you don't always know everything and to, perhaps not about the virus

1:42:47.300 --> 1:42:51.020
 as much, but other things speculate.

1:42:51.020 --> 1:42:57.540
 What if, you know, what if it's the worst case and the best case?

1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:00.760
 Because that's ultimately what we are, descendants of apes that are just curious about the world

1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:01.760
 around us.

1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:11.980
 Yeah, I'll just add to that, not on the topic of masks, but on the topic of curiosity.

1:43:11.980 --> 1:43:19.300
 I mean, I think that's, astronomy and planetary sciences, a field are a little, are unique

1:43:19.300 --> 1:43:26.420
 because for better and for worse, they don't directly impact humanity.

1:43:26.420 --> 1:43:34.300
 So you know, we're not studying virology to prevent transmission of, you know, illness

1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:35.380
 amongst humans.

1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:40.180
 We're not characterizing volcanoes on earth that could destroy cities.

1:43:40.180 --> 1:43:49.780
 We, it really is a more curious and in my opinion, playful scientific field than many.

1:43:49.780 --> 1:43:54.860
 So for better and worse, we can kind of afford to pursue some of the speculation more because

1:43:54.860 --> 1:44:00.420
 human lives are not in danger if we speculate a little bit too freely and get something

1:44:00.420 --> 1:44:01.420
 wrong.

1:44:01.420 --> 1:44:03.520
 Yeah, definitely.

1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:09.940
 In the space of AI, I am worried that we're sometimes too eager, speaking for myself,

1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:14.900
 to like flip the switch to on just to see like what happens.

1:44:14.900 --> 1:44:19.260
 Maybe sometimes we want to be a little bit careful about that because bad things might

1:44:19.260 --> 1:44:21.180
 happen.

1:44:21.180 --> 1:44:27.940
 Is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that were inspiring, had an

1:44:27.940 --> 1:44:30.300
 impact on you that you would recommend?

1:44:30.300 --> 1:44:31.860
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:44:31.860 --> 1:44:35.580
 So many that I just don't know where to start with it.

1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:37.140
 So I love reading.

1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:38.340
 I read obsessively.

1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:43.080
 I've been reading fiction and a little bit of nonfiction, but mostly fiction obsessively

1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:47.820
 since I was a child and just never stopped.

1:44:47.820 --> 1:44:50.140
 So I have some favorite books.

1:44:50.140 --> 1:44:51.780
 None of them are easy readings.

1:44:51.780 --> 1:44:56.580
 So I definitely, I mean, I recommend them for somebody who likes an intellectual challenge

1:44:56.580 --> 1:44:59.980
 in the books that they read.

1:44:59.980 --> 1:45:02.900
 So maybe I should go chronologically.

1:45:02.900 --> 1:45:04.580
 I have at least three.

1:45:04.580 --> 1:45:07.340
 I'm not going to go through 50 here.

1:45:07.340 --> 1:45:14.980
 Yeah, I'd love to also like maybe ideas that you took away from what you mentioned.

1:45:14.980 --> 1:45:15.980
 Yeah.

1:45:15.980 --> 1:45:16.980
 Yeah.

1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:20.300
 Why they were so compelling to me.

1:45:20.300 --> 1:45:27.580
 One of the first books that really captured my fascination was Nabokov's book Pale Fire.

1:45:27.580 --> 1:45:29.380
 Are you familiar with it?

1:45:29.380 --> 1:45:34.560
 So I read it actually for a class.

1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:39.820
 It's one of the few books I've ever read for a class that I actually really liked.

1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:44.680
 And the book is, it's in some sense a puzzle.

1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:52.320
 He's a brilliant writer, of course, but the book is like, it's formatted like a poem.

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:59.460
 So there's an introduction, a very long poem and footnotes, and you get partway through

1:45:59.460 --> 1:46:04.020
 it before realizing that the whole thing is actually a novel, unless you sort of read

1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:05.020
 up on it going in.

1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:10.820
 But the whole thing is a novel and there's a story that slowly reveals itself over the

1:46:10.820 --> 1:46:21.320
 course of all of this and kind of reveals this just fascinating character basically

1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:24.100
 and how his mind works in this story.

1:46:24.100 --> 1:46:31.020
 The idea of a novel also being a kind of intellectual puzzle and something that slowly reveals itself

1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:36.460
 over the course of reading was really fascinating to me and I have since found a lot more writers

1:46:36.460 --> 1:46:38.140
 like that.

1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:44.760
 In a contemporary example that comes to mind is Kazuo Ishiguro, who's pretty much all of

1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:49.600
 his books are like slow reveals over the course of the book and like nothing much happens

1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:54.280
 in the books, but you keep reading them because you just want to know like what the reality

1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:57.660
 is that he's slowly revealing to you.

1:46:57.660 --> 1:47:02.220
 The kind of discovery oriented reading maybe.

1:47:02.220 --> 1:47:04.140
 What's the second one?

1:47:04.140 --> 1:47:08.100
 Perhaps my favorite writer is Renier Maria Rilke.

1:47:08.100 --> 1:47:09.100
 Wow.

1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:11.100
 Are you familiar with him?

1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:13.140
 No, also not familiar.

1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:14.140
 You're hitting hidden ones.

1:47:14.140 --> 1:47:19.420
 I mean, I know in the book of Well, but I've never read Pale Fire, but Rilke, I've never,

1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:22.900
 I know it's a very difficult read, I know that much.

1:47:22.900 --> 1:47:23.900
 Yeah, right.

1:47:23.900 --> 1:47:25.220
 All of these are difficult reads.

1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:33.740
 I think I just, I read for in part for an intellectual challenge, but Rilke, so he wrote

1:47:33.740 --> 1:47:38.060
 one thing that might be characterizable as a novel, but he wrote a lot of poetry.

1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:43.760
 I mean, he wrote this series of poems called the Duino Elegies that were very impactful

1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:53.260
 for me personally, just emotionally, which actually it kind of ties in with astronomy

1:47:53.260 --> 1:48:01.660
 in that there's a sense in which we're all going through our lives alone and there's

1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:10.100
 just this sense of profound loneliness in the existence of every individual human.

1:48:10.100 --> 1:48:18.540
 I think I was drawn to astronomy in part because the sort of vast spaces, the kind of loneliness

1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:24.660
 and desolateness of space made the sort of internal loneliness feel okay.

1:48:24.660 --> 1:48:32.220
 In a sense, it like gave companionship and that's how I feel about Rilke's poetry.

1:48:32.220 --> 1:48:40.920
 He turns the kind of desolation and loneliness of human existence into something joyful and

1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:42.580
 almost meaningful.

1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:48.860
 Yeah, there's something about melancholy, I don't know about Rilke in general, but like

1:48:48.860 --> 1:49:00.860
 contemplating the melancholy nature of the human condition that makes it okay.

1:49:00.860 --> 1:49:05.940
 I got gentle from an engineering perspective, think that there is so much loneliness we

1:49:05.940 --> 1:49:12.100
 haven't explored within ourselves yet and that's my hope is to build AI systems that

1:49:12.100 --> 1:49:15.580
 help us explore our own loneliness.

1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:22.020
 I think that's kind of what love is and friendship is, is somebody who in a very small way helps

1:49:22.020 --> 1:49:28.860
 us explore our own loneliness, like they listen, we connect like two lonely creatures connect

1:49:28.860 --> 1:49:38.100
 for a time and it's like, oh, like acknowledge that we exist together for a brief time, but

1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:43.260
 in a somewhat shallow way, I think relative to how much it's possible to truly connect

1:49:43.260 --> 1:49:44.540
 as two consciousnesses.

1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:48.980
 So AI might be able to help on that front.

1:49:48.980 --> 1:49:49.980
 So what's the third one?

1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:54.100
 Actually, you know, I hadn't realized until this moment, but it's yet another one of these

1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:57.160
 kind of slow reveal books.

1:49:57.160 --> 1:50:05.620
 It's a contemporary Russian, I think Russian American writer named Olga Grushin and she

1:50:05.620 --> 1:50:12.660
 wrote this just phenomenal book called The Dream Life of Sukhanov that I read this year.

1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:18.380
 Maybe it was last year for the first time and it's just a really beautiful, this one

1:50:18.380 --> 1:50:26.060
 you could call a character study, I think of a Russian father coming to terms with himself

1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:33.660
 and his own past as he potentially slowly loses his mind.

1:50:33.660 --> 1:50:36.620
 Slow reveal.

1:50:36.620 --> 1:50:37.620
 Slow reveal.

1:50:37.620 --> 1:50:39.740
 Well, that's apparent from the beginning.

1:50:39.740 --> 1:50:43.740
 I hope I don't think it's a spoiler.

1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:44.740
 Decline into madness.

1:50:44.740 --> 1:50:45.740
 Spoiler alert.

1:50:45.740 --> 1:50:47.540
 So all of these are really heavy.

1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:48.540
 I don't know.

1:50:48.540 --> 1:50:50.540
 I just, I don't have anything lighter to recommend.

1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:53.620
 Ishiguro is the light version of this.

1:50:53.620 --> 1:50:54.620
 Okay.

1:50:54.620 --> 1:50:58.500
 Well, heavy has a certain kind of beauty to it in itself.

1:50:58.500 --> 1:51:03.100
 Is there advice you would give to a young person today that looks up to the stars and

1:51:03.100 --> 1:51:05.160
 wonders what the heck they want to do with their life?

1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:15.180
 So career, science, life in general, you've for now chosen a certain kind of path of curiosity.

1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:20.340
 What insights do you draw from that that you can give us advice to others?

1:51:20.340 --> 1:51:27.940
 I think for somebody, I would not presume to speak to giving people advice on life and

1:51:27.940 --> 1:51:33.820
 humanity overall, but for somebody thinking of being a scientist.

1:51:33.820 --> 1:51:40.060
 So there are a couple of things, one sort of practical thing, which is career wise,

1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:47.780
 I hadn't appreciated this going into science, but you need to, so the questions you're working

1:51:47.780 --> 1:51:55.260
 on and the techniques you use are both of very high importance, maybe equal importance

1:51:55.260 --> 1:51:58.060
 for being happy in your career.

1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:01.660
 If there are questions you're interested in, but the techniques that you need to use to

1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:07.700
 do them are tedious for you, then your job is going to be miserable even if the questions

1:52:07.700 --> 1:52:09.100
 are inspiring.

1:52:09.100 --> 1:52:14.980
 So you have to find, but if the techniques that you use are things that excite you, then

1:52:14.980 --> 1:52:16.700
 your job is fun every day.

1:52:16.700 --> 1:52:22.100
 So for me, I'm fascinated by the solar system and I love telescopes and I love doing data

1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:25.620
 analysis, playing with data from telescopes, coming up with new ways to use telescopes

1:52:25.620 --> 1:52:28.100
 and so that's where I have found that mesh.

1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:32.740
 But if I was interested in, you know, the dynamical evolution of the solar system, how

1:52:32.740 --> 1:52:36.900
 the orbits of things evolve, then I would need to do a different type of work that I

1:52:36.900 --> 1:52:39.800
 would just not find as appealing and so it just wouldn't be a good fit.

1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:44.980
 And so it sort of seems like an unromantic thing to have to think about the techniques

1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:49.100
 being the thing you want to work on also, but it really makes a profound difference

1:52:49.100 --> 1:52:52.300
 for I think your happiness and your scientific career.

1:52:52.300 --> 1:52:53.300
 I think that's really profound.

1:52:53.300 --> 1:52:56.300
 It's like the thing, the menial tasks.

1:52:56.300 --> 1:53:00.300
 If you enjoy those, that's a really good sign that that's the right path for you.

1:53:00.300 --> 1:53:06.420
 I think David Foster Wallace said that the key to life is to be unborable.

1:53:06.420 --> 1:53:09.700
 So basically everything should be exciting.

1:53:09.700 --> 1:53:15.220
 I don't think that's feasible, but you should find an area where everything is exciting.

1:53:15.220 --> 1:53:20.180
 I mean, depending on the day, but you could find the joy in everything, not just the big

1:53:20.180 --> 1:53:28.860
 exciting things that everyone thinks is exciting, but the details, the repetitive stuff, the

1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:32.980
 menial stuff, the stuff that takes years, the stuff that involves a lot of failure and

1:53:32.980 --> 1:53:35.460
 all those kinds of things that you find that enjoyable.

1:53:35.460 --> 1:53:40.800
 That's actually really profound to focus on that because people talk about like dreams

1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:44.500
 and passion and goals and so on, the big thing, but that's not actually what takes you there.

1:53:44.500 --> 1:53:49.340
 What takes you there is every single day, putting in the hours, and that's what actually

1:53:49.340 --> 1:53:51.980
 makes up life is the boring bits.

1:53:51.980 --> 1:54:00.040
 If the boring bits aren't boring, then that's an exciting life because when you were talking

1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:06.500
 so romantically and passionately about IO, I remember the poem by Robert Frost.

1:54:06.500 --> 1:54:11.500
 So let me ask you, let me read the poem and ask what your opinion is.

1:54:11.500 --> 1:54:12.860
 That's called Fire and Ice.

1:54:12.860 --> 1:54:13.860
 Oh yeah.

1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:16.420
 I could almost recite this from memory.

1:54:16.420 --> 1:54:18.300
 Some say the world will end in fire.

1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:19.300
 Some say in ice.

1:54:19.300 --> 1:54:23.600
 From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire.

1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:29.180
 But if I had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction

1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:33.020
 ice is also great and would suffice.

1:54:33.020 --> 1:54:41.380
 So let me ask, if you had to only choose one, would you choose the world to end in fire,

1:54:41.380 --> 1:54:51.180
 in volcanic eruptions, in heat and magma, or in ice, frozen over?

1:54:51.180 --> 1:54:52.180
 Fire or ice?

1:54:52.180 --> 1:54:53.180
 Fire.

1:54:53.180 --> 1:54:54.180
 Excellent choice.

1:54:54.180 --> 1:55:10.660
 I've always been a fan of chaos and the idea of things just slowly getting cold and stopping

1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:14.820
 and dying is just so depressing to me.

1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:20.800
 So much more depressing than things blowing up or burning or getting covered by a lava

1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:21.800
 flow.

1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:27.500
 Somehow the activity of it endows it with more meaning to me, maybe.

1:55:27.500 --> 1:55:32.100
 I've just now had this vision of you in action films where you're walking away without looking

1:55:32.100 --> 1:55:38.420
 back and this explosion's behind you and you put on shades and then it goes to credits.

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:45.780
 Catherine, this is awesome, I think your work is really inspiring.

1:55:45.780 --> 1:55:50.340
 The kind of things we'll discover about planets in the next few decades is super cool and

1:55:50.340 --> 1:55:55.620
 I hope, I know you said there's probably not life in one of them, but there might be and

1:55:55.620 --> 1:55:58.380
 I hope we discover just that.

1:55:58.380 --> 1:56:04.020
 And perhaps even on Io, within the volcanic eruptions, there's a little creature hanging

1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.340
 on that we'll one day discover.

1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:10.620
 Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time with me today, it was really awesome.

1:56:10.620 --> 1:56:14.340
 Yeah, likewise, thank you for having me here.

1:56:14.340 --> 1:56:19.140
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Catherine Duclear and thank you to Fundrise,

1:56:19.140 --> 1:56:23.180
 Blinkist, ExpressVPN and Magic Spoon.

1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:26.460
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:29.740
 And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.

1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:34.500
 On Titan, the molecules that have been raining down like mana from heaven for the last four

1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:41.180
 billion years might still be there, largely unaltered, deep frozen, awaiting for the chemists

1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:42.800
 from Earth.

1:56:42.800 --> 1:57:04.940
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
