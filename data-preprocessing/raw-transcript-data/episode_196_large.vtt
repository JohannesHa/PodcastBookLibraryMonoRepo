 The following is a conversation with Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, human rights activist,

00:06.160 --> 00:14.240
 and author of the book, In Order to Live. Quick mention of our sponsors, Belcampo, Gala Games,

00:14.240 --> 00:19.040
 Batter Help, and Aid Sleep. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:19.840 --> 00:27.440
 Let me say a few words about North Korea. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea went through a famine.

00:27.440 --> 00:34.080
 Mass starvation, caused primarily by King Jong Il, who at the time was the new leader of North

00:34.080 --> 00:43.760
 Korea after his father's death in 1994. Somewhere between 600,000 and 3 million people died due to

00:43.760 --> 00:50.160
 starvation. From all the stories of famine in history, including my own family history, I've

00:50.160 --> 00:56.800
 come to understand that hunger tortures the human mind in a way that can break everything we stand

00:56.800 --> 01:04.880
 for. In North Korea, during the 90s famine, many were driven to cannibalism. Imagine more than 10

01:04.880 --> 01:12.160
 million people suffering starvation for months and years, always on the brink of death. We don't know

01:12.160 --> 01:18.640
 the exact numbers of people who died because the suffering was done in silence, in darkness. Very

01:18.640 --> 01:25.760
 little information in or out. Most people had to survive without electricity, without clean water,

01:25.760 --> 01:31.760
 medical supplies, sanitation, and food. The North Korean propaganda machine called this

01:31.760 --> 01:37.760
 the Arduous March, or the March of Suffering, and words such as famine and hunger were banned

01:37.760 --> 01:44.800
 because they implied government failure. And once again, now, in 2021, King Jong Un,

01:44.800 --> 01:50.160
 the current leader of North Korea, is calling for his country to prepare for another Arduous March,

01:50.160 --> 01:56.160
 or March of Suffering. Another period of mass starvation as the country closes its borders.

01:57.360 --> 02:03.040
 Looking at atrocities of the past decades and the encroaching atrocity there now, I think about the

02:03.040 --> 02:08.320
 quiet suffering of millions of North Koreans. I think about the torture of the human spirit.

02:08.880 --> 02:15.360
 I think about a North Korean child who could be a scientist, an artist, a writer, but who instead

02:15.360 --> 02:21.120
 grows impossibly thin without food, their bodies slowly rotting away as their parents watch

02:21.120 --> 02:28.640
 helplessly. I got emotional in this conversation with you and me, in part because I remembered my

02:28.640 --> 02:35.520
 grandmother, who survived Khaldamur, the famine in Ukraine, intentionally created by Stalin,

02:35.520 --> 02:42.160
 where 4 to 10 million people died and many, many more suffered. Imagine knowing that if you don't

02:42.160 --> 02:47.520
 engage in cannibalism, you will die before your children did, and then they will be eaten.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.880
 Imagine, because of this, deciding to murder and eat your own children,

02:52.880 --> 02:59.920
 as many people did. Imagine the kind of desperation, torture, that leads up to a decision

02:59.920 --> 03:05.920
 like that. I'm not smart enough to know what evil is, nor where to draw the line between good and

03:05.920 --> 03:14.560
 evil. But Stalin, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, are men who in the name of power are willing to make

03:14.560 --> 03:22.160
 millions of people, of children, suffer and die from starvation. I rarely have hate in my heart,

03:22.160 --> 03:28.800
 but I hate these men. I hate that such men exist in this world. I hate that the beauty I love about

03:28.800 --> 03:35.920
 this life exists amidst such unimaginable cruelty. I have been haunted by this conversation,

03:36.480 --> 03:42.240
 by memories of my grandmother's pain. But I've also been warmed by memories of her love.

03:43.360 --> 03:50.480
 Love gives me hope. Hope for the perseverance of the human spirit, even in the face of evil.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.040
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with you and me, Park.

03:57.040 --> 04:03.120
 Park. Can you tell your story from North Korea to today as you describe in your 2015 book,

04:03.760 --> 04:08.560
 and with the extra perspective on life, love and freedom you've gained since then?

04:08.560 --> 04:14.000
 Wow, that's a long story. So I was born in the northern part of North Korea initially.

04:14.720 --> 04:22.000
 And my father was a party member. And my mom was housewife. I had one older sister.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.320
 And I remember born in that country. I never thought I was in an unusual country. Now I'm

04:28.320 --> 04:34.800
 thinking of what is literally called the Hermit Kingdom. But I thought I believed that I was

04:34.800 --> 04:41.360
 living in the best country on earth. It was a socialist paradise. And everybody in the rest

04:41.360 --> 04:48.880
 of the world worshiped my ideal leader. And there was nothing to envy for me. So I had this

04:48.880 --> 04:53.920
 enormous pride in my heart. And grateful to be in that country.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.320
 So it was love for the leader, not fear?

04:57.280 --> 05:03.120
 For me at least, it was love. Yeah, it was all the moderation and gratitude.

05:03.840 --> 05:08.240
 It changed lately, but for me was pure, pure like love.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.800
 Was there any, like looking back with the perspective you have now,

05:12.800 --> 05:19.760
 would you describe some of those moments growing up as full of happiness? Or was that

05:20.480 --> 05:26.000
 delusion at the time? So not knowing the alternative, will you still be able to be happy?

05:26.960 --> 05:32.960
 The fact that I did not know, like in North Korea, this is the only country in this 21st century

05:32.960 --> 05:39.440
 has no internet. And they don't even know the existence of internet. Not only that,

05:39.440 --> 05:47.120
 we don't even have this 24 hour electricity. So not knowing definitely helped, I think,

05:47.840 --> 05:53.280
 to be sane. So as a human being, you're still able to find moments of happiness?

05:53.840 --> 05:59.760
 I think my happiness was from family, nothing else. Even though those days keep telling me

05:59.760 --> 06:06.000
 that they were our source of meaning and happiness, I don't think I ever got happy by that.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
 Maybe they're here and they're in schools. And like when I was learning propaganda,

06:10.560 --> 06:15.040
 like, you know, the proud feeling, right? I mean, the greatest nation here and there,

06:15.040 --> 06:20.000
 but like actually true happiness came from laughing with my family, my friends.

06:20.560 --> 06:26.400
 Are there any childhood memories, pleasant or painful ones that stand out to you now?

06:28.800 --> 06:34.640
 I mean, like, you know, whenever I think about my North Korea, the interesting is

06:34.640 --> 06:40.400
 there's no color. I mean, one is because North Korean country has no color, right? Most of

06:40.400 --> 06:46.880
 things are unpaved and trees all cut down. We have no fear. So people cut down trees to

06:46.880 --> 06:54.640
 make food. So but only that, like, even what we are wearing was like no color. So it's an

06:55.360 --> 06:57.440
 interesting memory to look back.

06:57.440 --> 07:04.720
 What about fashion? I've noticed from sort of you now, you have quite an incredible sense of

07:04.720 --> 07:10.880
 fashion. So contrast that with your time in North Korea. How do you remember fashion? Just

07:10.880 --> 07:14.880
 ways that people could express themselves visually. Was it all bland?

07:15.600 --> 07:20.960
 There was no word for fashion in North Korea. We didn't even know. It was not even in our

07:20.960 --> 07:25.920
 dictionary. So of course, I did not know what Victoria's Secret models were. I didn't even

07:25.920 --> 07:32.080
 know what models were. So when I came out, I learned the model was a job. And like, what

07:32.080 --> 07:38.000
 is that? And I'm still confused. So there's so many jobs that we have here doesn't exist

07:38.000 --> 07:38.960
 in North Korea.

07:39.840 --> 07:44.480
 What was life like in North Korea as compared to the rest of the world? So maybe you said

07:44.480 --> 07:52.720
 there's no internet. 24 hour electricity is a luxury you do not have. What about food?

07:52.720 --> 07:56.000
 What about water? What about basic human rights?

07:56.000 --> 08:01.040
 I think that's a thing like when people were asking me, can you tell me about like life

08:01.040 --> 08:06.480
 in North Korea? And in the past, I was like, I cannot describe it to you. And initially

08:06.480 --> 08:10.480
 I thought, oh, because of my English that I cannot find the words. It's not that it's

08:10.480 --> 08:16.640
 a different planet. The common sense that we have doesn't exist there. Like people literally

08:16.640 --> 08:24.640
 do not know the concept of romantic love, or human rights or liberty. So when I'm thinking

08:24.640 --> 08:31.280
 back to my country, it's, you know, like, as you cannot imagine your life on Mars right

08:31.280 --> 08:37.440
 now. It's like that kind of difference. I grew up never seen the map of the world. I

08:37.440 --> 08:42.720
 never knew that I was Asian. Like the regime told me that I was Kim Il Sung, the first

08:42.720 --> 08:49.200
 Kim race. And then our calendar doesn't begin when Jesus Christ was born. Our calendar begins

08:49.200 --> 08:55.840
 where Kim was born. So we, and history was forgotten to us. They didn't teach us about

08:55.840 --> 09:02.720
 of course, Christianity or like the Big Bang. Like our history began when Kim was born.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.480
 So everything was forgotten to us. And it was a different meaning. I mean, feeling of

09:08.480 --> 09:14.480
 existence, you know, it's not even like same life. I literally think that was almost like

09:14.480 --> 09:18.480
 my past life. And this is like a new life that I began.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
 You're almost like a different human being now.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.480
 Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

09:22.480 --> 09:30.480
 So you've, I have to say, I often say that my favorite book is Animal Farm by George

09:30.480 --> 09:36.480
 Orwell. I've read it, I don't know how many times. And so I was really happy to hear that

09:36.480 --> 09:42.480
 that was of the many books, excellent books that we'll hopefully talk about. You've mentioned

09:42.480 --> 09:50.480
 that Animal Farm had a big impact on you. It was the book that kind of led to a kind

09:50.480 --> 09:54.480
 of awakening for you. Maybe can you describe what impact it had?

09:54.480 --> 09:59.480
 So after going through what I went through, and I arrived in South Korea after many years

09:59.480 --> 10:06.480
 of journey, they were saying, so Kims were dictators, and South Korea is not colonized

10:06.480 --> 10:11.480
 by American bastards. And Americans, first of all, not bastards, they're good people.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.480
 And then they say everything that you believe in North Korea was a lie. It was a propaganda.

10:16.480 --> 10:22.480
 Then at 15, I was thinking, so if everything that I believe was a lie, how do I know what

10:22.480 --> 10:29.480
 I believe is not a lie? That was so hard. How do I trust ever again? And I just, it

10:29.480 --> 10:35.480
 was chaos in belief. I did not know what was true anymore. And that's the moment, a few

10:35.480 --> 10:40.480
 years later, I read this book, like Animal Farm, just by mistake. It was a very short

10:40.480 --> 10:46.480
 book in the library. I was like, okay, I can finish that quickly. And when they're ending

10:46.480 --> 10:52.480
 that, like last chapter, they could not see between the pigs and humans anymore. That

10:52.480 --> 10:59.480
 sentence, I just understood everything that happened. It made every sense to me, what

10:59.480 --> 11:03.480
 happened to me, my people, and to my country.

11:03.480 --> 11:09.480
 Yeah, there's so many things I could say about that book. Yeah, there's a haunting nature

11:09.480 --> 11:16.480
 to the end. And I guess spoiler alert, but you should have read this already. If you're

11:16.480 --> 11:22.480
 listening to this. At the end, the animals were looking to the humans and to the pigs

11:22.480 --> 11:28.480
 and they couldn't see the difference. And then there's this kind of gradual transition

11:28.480 --> 11:37.480
 from the initial revolutionary steps of animals fighting for their freedom to slowly the pigs

11:37.480 --> 11:46.480
 gaining control, went from four legs good, two legs bad, to four legs good, two legs

11:46.480 --> 11:51.480
 better, I believe. Two legs even better, I think, something like that. So like gradually

11:51.480 --> 11:58.480
 transitioning the ideology under which the farm operates. And I think the gradual nature

11:58.480 --> 12:06.480
 of that, where basically you have generations born not knowing how things were in the past.

12:06.480 --> 12:16.480
 And that's what makes the most kind of, for me, haunting transition from freedom to slavery

12:16.480 --> 12:22.480
 to suffering to injustice, all those things. And the animals don't know they're part of

12:22.480 --> 12:31.480
 that. And also for me personally, I always kind of found a kinship with Boxer the horse

12:31.480 --> 12:37.480
 because I just, I'm kind of an idiot, I just work really hard. And I just love the idea

12:37.480 --> 12:47.480
 of working hard for an ideal. And the tragic nature of, to the end, that horse, Boxer,

12:47.480 --> 12:56.480
 working his ass off for the pride for others. But yeah, for the pride of the farm, you know.

12:56.480 --> 13:03.480
 And then the pigs giving him, sort of using that, but then just sending him to the slaughterhouse

13:03.480 --> 13:09.480
 anyway, when he was no longer useful. I mean, there's so many tragic elements that echo

13:09.480 --> 13:14.480
 everything I've seen in the Soviet Union. And many of the elements that you see in even

13:14.480 --> 13:19.480
 harsher, more drastic way in North Korea. If there's something hopeful you pull from

13:19.480 --> 13:26.480
 that book, like within the suffering, within the gradual decline, the taking away the freedom,

13:26.480 --> 13:29.480
 there were still moments of beauty, it seemed like.

13:29.480 --> 13:36.480
 It can be. But I think for me was when I was ending the last page of the book. Until that

13:36.480 --> 13:42.480
 point, I was angry towards the dictator. Why do you do this as a human being? I was so

13:42.480 --> 13:47.480
 angry, dreaming of killing him, right? Revenge on my father, the people that he killed.

13:47.480 --> 13:54.480
 But when I was ending the last chapter, actually everybody was responsible to create this dystopia

13:54.480 --> 14:02.480
 in my country. The initial animals, when they're scared, when they see the first execution,

14:02.480 --> 14:07.480
 and then they were not doing their job, speaking out and keep questioning. They had a question

14:07.480 --> 14:13.480
 and then as soon as they see a fear, they silence. Because of that, that's when I was

14:13.480 --> 14:19.480
 like, my grandma knew life could be different. I think the one thing about North Koreans

14:19.480 --> 14:24.480
 are unique is that they don't know they're oppressed. They don't know that they are slaves

14:24.480 --> 14:29.480
 to the dictator. And the fact that other people know they're oppressed, like in America, a

14:29.480 --> 14:33.480
 lot of people think they are oppressed, like you are not oppressed. You don't even know

14:33.480 --> 14:39.480
 the definition of oppression. And that's like when the new animals came, the new animals

14:39.480 --> 14:44.480
 didn't even know what the life could be like. There's no alternative for them to compare

14:44.480 --> 14:49.480
 even. And I was like, my grandmother knew. Why didn't they not do anything about it?

14:49.480 --> 14:54.480
 And they were just scared. They kept silent. And everybody was responsible.

14:54.480 --> 15:01.480
 So the people who knew were too afraid to say. And then there's people that just didn't

15:01.480 --> 15:07.480
 even know. And I don't know what's more terrifying about human nature, looking at this group

15:07.480 --> 15:12.480
 of people who are afraid to say that things could be otherwise, and then the group of

15:12.480 --> 15:17.480
 people that don't even know it could be better.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.480
 No.

15:18.480 --> 15:23.480
 It's, I don't know, that's the reason I return to that book often, because it's such, maybe

15:23.480 --> 15:29.480
 because it's interesting using animals to represent ideas that were very human. It almost

15:29.480 --> 15:37.480
 allows you to explore the darkness of human nature without sort of being broken by it.

15:37.480 --> 15:44.480
 So you mentioned anger. When I watch your interviews, you're really calm and collected.

15:44.480 --> 15:52.480
 Not just your interviews, you know, Instagram, the way you present yourself. You, I don't

15:52.480 --> 15:58.480
 know, it seems like you're almost at peace with the world. Is there in private times

15:58.480 --> 16:04.480
 when you're just angry? Do you feel fear? Do you go to dark places, depression, all

16:04.480 --> 16:09.480
 those kinds of things? Are you, are you able to put that world that you were in behind

16:09.480 --> 16:10.480
 you?

16:10.480 --> 16:17.480
 It's a joke because I talk about North Korea every single day and I still rescue people

16:17.480 --> 16:23.480
 like from China and Russia and other countries, right? And sometimes I'll rescue mission

16:23.480 --> 16:28.480
 figures and they get captured and sent back. I still have people in North Korea report

16:28.480 --> 16:35.480
 to me. So like when I talked to my sister who chose to not be in this life, activist

16:35.480 --> 16:41.480
 life, she forgot most of things. And like for the other hand, I like to remember everything.

16:41.480 --> 16:50.480
 So sometimes it's a blessing to keep reminded of how, because it's, you know, they say happiness

16:50.480 --> 16:56.480
 is a relative thing. It is sometimes. I mean, I think it's also people say because nobody

16:56.480 --> 17:01.480
 was foreign when you're growing up, everybody was suffering. You should have been okay,

17:01.480 --> 17:07.480
 right? But no, like if you are suffering in that degree, no matter, even if there's no

17:07.480 --> 17:11.480
 comparison, like if you're in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, right? In the concentration

17:11.480 --> 17:16.480
 camp, I'm sure nobody was better than them. I'm sure they were suffering. It's the same

17:16.480 --> 17:22.480
 thing. I suffered. But now because I'm in this place, I can compare easily, right? Getting

17:22.480 --> 17:27.480
 that perspective. But it is true, like I still have days that I cannot get out of bed. And

17:27.480 --> 17:33.480
 I really hoping like that when it was Elon Musk talking about downloading your brain,

17:33.480 --> 17:39.480
 blah, blah, blah. Maybe technology develops that I can download some part of my memory

17:39.480 --> 17:44.480
 and then I can erase it or delete it. And that'd be so much better.

17:44.480 --> 17:51.480
 What I, this is a, sorry for the tough question, but if I came to you, if Elon came to you

17:51.480 --> 17:56.480
 and said, we can erase that part of your memory, would you do it?

17:56.480 --> 18:02.480
 Some days I would do it for sure. And my mom would do 100%. My sister would do it. All

18:02.480 --> 18:10.480
 other defectors know they do 100%. For me, I hesitated because I'm a witness. So if I

18:10.480 --> 18:17.480
 delete that part, I don't know how real that can be. But it is painful. After I talk, give

18:17.480 --> 18:23.480
 a speech, right? I mean, I'm fine. But somehow I'm depressed. Sometimes if the talk was very

18:23.480 --> 18:28.480
 intense, I'm like depressed for three weeks. It takes a while for me to be recharged. But

18:28.480 --> 18:32.480
 I don't know why it is. I just don't know.

18:32.480 --> 18:38.480
 Well, there's also the, and there's a guy named Victor Franco who wrote the book, Man

18:38.480 --> 18:44.480
 Search for Meaning. And there's some aspect where, so he talks about the Holocaust and

18:44.480 --> 18:49.480
 that you can, in those moments of suffering, still discover meaning, still discover happiness

18:49.480 --> 18:55.480
 in the simplest of joys. Like while starving, a little piece of bread could be a source

18:55.480 --> 19:04.480
 of incredible joy. And there's some aspect in which that experience gives you a clarity

19:04.480 --> 19:11.480
 about the world. Like somehow experiencing suffering allows you to deeply experience

19:11.480 --> 19:19.480
 joy and love, and also empathize with the suffering of others. And it's almost like

19:19.480 --> 19:31.480
 brings you closer to other humans. This double edged sword that the highest of joys sometimes

19:31.480 --> 19:36.480
 are catalyzed by suffering. And it's hard to know what to do with that. You see that

19:36.480 --> 19:41.480
 with World War II, the stories of soldiers that have suffered, but some of the closest

19:41.480 --> 19:49.480
 bonds of brotherhood, of just pure love was experienced by them. And it sucks that our

19:49.480 --> 19:55.480
 brains are like this. Love requires hardship. I don't know why that is.

19:55.480 --> 20:01.480
 Yeah, that's like that thing. Of course, in my journey, I learned how to survive, right?

20:01.480 --> 20:08.480
 When to not trust and when to run. But I think most of us keep learning what it means to

20:08.480 --> 20:13.480
 be a human being. I think that was like the ultimate thing I was keep learning. And I

20:13.480 --> 20:19.480
 still don't know fully what it means. But I do think it seems like suffering is necessary

20:19.480 --> 20:25.480
 for people to be grateful and even be joyful too sometimes.

20:25.480 --> 20:31.480
 So I talk about love quite a bit. And you mentioned that romantic love. I'm fascinated

20:31.480 --> 20:41.480
 about love in many aspects. But you mentioned romantic love was forbidden in North Korea.

20:41.480 --> 20:47.480
 What do you think about love now that you've kind of discovered it? What's the role of

20:47.480 --> 20:53.480
 love in life? So why do you think it was forbidden in North Korea?

20:53.480 --> 20:58.480
 So the tragic thing about North Korea is not only just banning Shakespeare, like we don't

20:58.480 --> 21:03.480
 even know what Romeo and Juliet is, right? Our movies is never about love stories. But

21:03.480 --> 21:11.480
 then also they banned the love between mother and daughter, wife and husband, and between

21:11.480 --> 21:17.480
 your friends. They deny you being a human. So only love that I knew was when I described

21:17.480 --> 21:23.480
 my feeling towards the leader and in a written form. That was the only love that people know

21:23.480 --> 21:29.480
 in North Korea. And now I'm like, there are many loves you can experience. I think you

21:29.480 --> 21:35.480
 definitely love science, right? But imagine that if you're being denied that. So there

21:35.480 --> 21:41.480
 are so many loves in life. But in North Korea, all of those things are denied. And I think

21:41.480 --> 21:48.480
 for me, love is what makes you tick. Like, you know, love for your child, love for your

21:48.480 --> 21:55.480
 parents, love for your friends, love for even yourself. That is denied. So I mean, many

21:55.480 --> 22:00.480
 people say like, love is an option. But like, then why do you live? I think we live to love.

22:00.480 --> 22:06.480
 And it doesn't have to be romantic love. It can be anything. But finding love in any person

22:06.480 --> 22:11.480
 or in any subject, I think that's a goal. I think that's when people find meaning in

22:11.480 --> 22:12.480
 something.

22:12.480 --> 22:19.480
 Yeah, I think romantic love is just one sort of, one echo of some core thing. Yeah, science,

22:19.480 --> 22:25.480
 I love science, I love robots, all of those things. And it sounds like deliberately or

22:25.480 --> 22:33.480
 not, the North Korean regime wants to channel that very deep aspect of the human spirit

22:33.480 --> 22:35.480
 all towards the leader.

22:35.480 --> 22:42.480
 Yeah, that's it. That's the only thing they allow us to fear and know about. So I remember,

22:42.480 --> 22:48.480
 I mean, you read 1984 by George Orwell, it talks about double think and double speak,

22:48.480 --> 22:54.480
 who controls the language, who controls thoughts. And why he does talk about as they go, they

22:54.480 --> 23:00.480
 eliminate a lot of words, right? Now, later one word can represent 10 different things.

23:00.480 --> 23:08.480
 And what fascinates me is how many vocabulary meaning people can have. And when I literally

23:08.480 --> 23:14.480
 came out, I remember I went to San Francisco, and someone came to me and hugged me. And

23:14.480 --> 23:19.480
 then he was a guy like, oh, baby, don't worry, I'm gay. I was like, what the heck is gay?

23:19.480 --> 23:24.480
 And then I literally had to go to a hotel room and Google the gay. And it's like, oh,

23:24.480 --> 23:30.480
 that's what you meant. And like that, like, they deny what that is. I'm sure there are

23:30.480 --> 23:36.480
 gays in North Korea. I'm sure there is. But you don't know what it is. And like that,

23:36.480 --> 23:42.480
 they eliminate words. So the fact that you know the concept, that stays much better than

23:42.480 --> 23:46.480
 and that's the thing a lot of people like when you're born, you somehow know what justice

23:46.480 --> 23:52.480
 is, what liberty is. And it's all somebody taught you that. And like, that's the thing

23:52.480 --> 23:57.480
 why people say, oh, humans are inherently know what is right, what is wrong, what is

23:57.480 --> 24:02.480
 oppression. And like, no, that's like BS. You got to learn.

24:02.480 --> 24:10.480
 That's fascinating that words give rise to ideas. So like, as a child, one of the ways

24:10.480 --> 24:15.480
 to learn about justice and freedom is to first learn the word, and then to ask, well, what

24:15.480 --> 24:20.480
 is it? Yeah, the concept. Yeah. And if you don't have the word for it, then you never

24:20.480 --> 24:25.480
 have the kind of first spark that leads to you trying to be curious about it. That's

24:25.480 --> 24:30.480
 interesting and controlling the words. And then, yeah, I mean, your thoughts, you control

24:30.480 --> 24:37.480
 the thoughts. There's so many echoes. I mean, I have, it's a very different, but perhaps

24:37.480 --> 24:44.480
 a very similar experience, which is the journey of my family through the Soviet Union. Because

24:44.480 --> 24:49.480
 there is a love of country. There is a pride of the people. Like you are proud of your

24:49.480 --> 24:57.480
 family in general. But I wonder how much of that is polluted by the propaganda.

24:57.480 --> 25:06.480
 I think a lot. For sure. Yeah. It is to this day, I'm like, my father who died in China

25:06.480 --> 25:13.480
 and he was tortured and then he died. He wanted to go back before his death, right? And then

25:13.480 --> 25:18.480
 it's like, dad, if you go back, you're going to be executed. And it's like, I want to be

25:18.480 --> 25:24.480
 executed. He wanted to go back to North Korea. To be executed. So he can be buried in his

25:24.480 --> 25:32.480
 own land. And then his last wish was, if I die, criminate me and then bring my ashes

25:32.480 --> 25:38.480
 back to my country. When I'm dead, I still want to be in my country. And this is nationalism.

25:38.480 --> 25:45.480
 This is a propaganda, right? But now it's the same thing. It's the same thing. If I

25:45.480 --> 25:52.480
 die, I somehow buried in my land and I still feel like I'm the outsider. I'm always longing

25:52.480 --> 25:57.480
 for my home. It's a horrible home. People say, what's your dream? Do you want to be

25:57.480 --> 26:02.480
 a president? Do you want to run for office? I just want to go home. That's my dream.

26:02.480 --> 26:10.480
 And people here don't get it ever. I don't know what to do with that. I love my country.

26:10.480 --> 26:16.480
 And I think for me, my country is the United States. And perhaps it will be for you too

26:16.480 --> 26:21.480
 one day. It is. I think it's becoming. US has been a very special place in my heart.

26:21.480 --> 26:28.480
 I think this is the first place I felt like I feel like home. And I mean, I was in South

26:28.480 --> 26:33.480
 Korea longer and I didn't feel that way. So I think we have very different life stories,

26:33.480 --> 26:38.480
 but I think it's almost two different people. For me, it's the person that was in the Soviet

26:38.480 --> 26:44.480
 Union and the person that's here. Those are two different people. That previous person's

26:44.480 --> 26:53.480
 home in the Soviet Union and he's part of me. And I suppose in that same way, your first

26:53.480 --> 27:00.480
 maybe two decades of life are somehow longing for the home that is North Korea. And your

27:00.480 --> 27:08.480
 next two decades of life might be finding a home in the United States. Your dad, can

27:08.480 --> 27:19.480
 you tell the story of his struggle, of his death? I mean, first, do you miss him? Do

27:19.480 --> 27:27.480
 you think about it? Oh man, all the time. I had a son when I was 22 and I had IVF three

27:27.480 --> 27:33.480
 times. And as you see, I'm like 80 pounds, but back then I was like 75 pounds. And because

27:33.480 --> 27:42.480
 of my severe malnutrition, somehow my body's very different. And so after three times of

27:42.480 --> 27:49.480
 IVF after 23, I was still wanting family. And the reason I wanted him is because I felt

27:49.480 --> 27:56.480
 so guilty for my father that he never seen this world. I somehow, when you're so desperate,

27:56.480 --> 28:02.480
 you become illogical. Like I want to believe in the, like Buddhist idea, right? You come

28:02.480 --> 28:08.480
 back to life. And I prayed, please come to me, like as my son, so I will take care of

28:08.480 --> 28:14.480
 you. Like come back. And when I was pregnant with my son, even though I planned to get

28:14.480 --> 28:21.480
 pregnant with a girl, doctor made a mistake. It became a boy. So I made his middle name,

28:21.480 --> 28:29.480
 like my father's name Jin Sik. I think he's the only American got North Korean name. It

28:29.480 --> 28:37.480
 is. So he's a part of your father's and your son. Yeah. That's how I, that's how I make

28:37.480 --> 28:44.480
 a sense of it. And that's how I move forward. Like if I, like as a logical human being,

28:44.480 --> 28:48.480
 you, you know, when you're dead, you're done. Maybe that's what I at least used to think,

28:48.480 --> 28:54.480
 but then life's become too unbearable. And somehow that's the thing, like we tell ourselves

28:54.480 --> 28:58.480
 stories in order to live. And that's how I came with my title of the book in order to

28:58.480 --> 29:04.480
 live. I had to tell myself a lot of stories to overcome a lot of things. I think I was

29:04.480 --> 29:15.480
 a part of it. Can you tell the story of you escaping North Korea to China? Yeah, I think

29:15.480 --> 29:26.480
 it's, it's a thing. It's amazing. Even though I was like 13, my like life outside of North

29:26.480 --> 29:32.480
 Korea is almost like went by like one second and my life till that point was like eternity.

29:32.480 --> 29:40.480
 I remember being in China. I arrived there at the end of March at 13. And by October,

29:40.480 --> 29:49.480
 it was six months past. And I literally felt like I lived eternity. And one day living

29:49.480 --> 29:56.480
 in China felt like living one year. One day was a war like surviving through one day was

29:56.480 --> 30:02.480
 so hard. Every night I was like, I cannot believe I got done one day today. That was

30:02.480 --> 30:08.480
 a thing I was grateful for before I went to bed. Okay, I survived. I didn't get captured.

30:08.480 --> 30:16.480
 And I made it another day on earth. So the experience of the minutes is what fear, fear

30:16.480 --> 30:26.480
 of being captured, fear, loss, everything. Because I mean, I saw my own mom in China

30:26.480 --> 30:35.480
 to survive to. So it was more than that. And it's not feeling I think that's a thing in

30:35.480 --> 30:44.480
 China. I learned not to fear. And after my escape was a challenging, I didn't feel anything.

30:44.480 --> 30:50.480
 And it was hard. Not feeling anything is a torture. It's the biggest torture you can

30:50.480 --> 30:57.480
 ever feel like even you fear sadness. That's better than not feeling anything. And I felt

30:57.480 --> 31:03.480
 something when I had my son. That's when I started healing. So he was a miracle to save

31:03.480 --> 31:08.480
 me. But yeah, in China, it wasn't even fear like it was numb.

31:08.480 --> 31:15.480
 You were numb. It was like paralysis. Yeah. Just overwhelming on the uncertainty of your

31:15.480 --> 31:19.480
 future. Did you have a sense what your future held at the time?

31:19.480 --> 31:24.480
 Like what do you even even feature? I don't even know that word. Right? Like, a lot of

31:24.480 --> 31:29.480
 times I was looking at myself like I left my body and like just looking at me. And just

31:29.480 --> 31:34.480
 not feeling it. It's not like I'm scared for her. I'm like sad for her just looking at

31:34.480 --> 31:42.480
 me like, huh, that's interesting. Wow. Not feeling anything. And me like being raped,

31:42.480 --> 31:49.480
 going through every emotion of life to survive, right? But like, somehow, I don't know if

31:49.480 --> 31:55.480
 you say so or something like looking at it just like, you feel nothing. You don't feel

31:55.480 --> 32:03.480
 anything for that person. So even with your mom, like what was, was there some, I don't

32:03.480 --> 32:10.480
 know, some warmth that you were able to extract from the connection with your mom? Yeah, of

32:10.480 --> 32:17.480
 course. I think that made me survive. I had a very strong connection with my family. And

32:17.480 --> 32:23.480
 I think that's what kept me going to do all of that. I think, as you said, I escaped at

32:23.480 --> 32:31.480
 13. My sister at the age of 16 escaped with her friend first. And I was going to escape

32:31.480 --> 32:37.480
 with her. But one day I got like really bad stomach ache. And my parents took me to hospital.

32:37.480 --> 32:41.480
 And in North Korean hospital, they don't have like X ray machines. They don't even have

32:41.480 --> 32:47.480
 electricity. They literally using one needle to inject everybody. And people don't die

32:47.480 --> 32:53.480
 from cancer in North Korea. You die from infection and fever and hunger, right? So most likely

32:53.480 --> 32:57.480
 you're going to die more by being treated by doctor than not being treated. I think

32:57.480 --> 33:02.480
 I was lucky. Even though they thought I had appendix, they operated on me without any

33:02.480 --> 33:09.480
 painkiller. And I didn't get infection. I survived. So that's how I got delayed to escape

33:09.480 --> 33:16.480
 with my sister. And she left me a note in my bedside saying like, follow this lady.

33:16.480 --> 33:21.480
 And this is like another trick about human trafficking, right? She sold me to China as

33:21.480 --> 33:29.480
 a sexual slave. And she executed for it later. She was executed for that later. She had five

33:29.480 --> 33:35.480
 daughters and she sold all her children to China. And we can now sitting here judging

33:35.480 --> 33:41.480
 on like how heartless you are selling your own children to China. And as a sexual slave,

33:41.480 --> 33:46.480
 they were like her children were seven, 10 years old. But that was the only way for her

33:46.480 --> 33:53.480
 to save her children. And if she didn't sell me that day, I would be dead right now. So

33:53.480 --> 33:59.480
 I'm grateful that she sold me. And I think that's the thing is like, life is so crazy.

33:59.480 --> 34:06.480
 You cannot judge. It is so complex. And yeah, that's how she changed my life by selling

34:06.480 --> 34:10.480
 me. She sold my mom and myself in 2007 to China.

34:10.480 --> 34:14.480
 So you're grateful for that. You're grateful for that suffering.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
 Of course I am grateful.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.480
 Because the alternative is worse.

34:18.480 --> 34:24.480
 I would not be here with you. You would never knew I existed.

34:24.480 --> 34:29.480
 What do you make of the others suffering in the world today? The people there in North

34:29.480 --> 34:39.480
 Korea. So that is part of your life's work is helping those people. What do you think

34:39.480 --> 34:42.480
 about them? What should people know about them?

34:42.480 --> 34:46.480
 I think that's when I get angry. Whenever I think about them.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.480
 Who's your anger directed at?

34:48.480 --> 35:00.480
 At the heartlessness of people, the ignorance of people. So when I got out of North Korea,

35:00.480 --> 35:07.480
 I went through all of that. And I went to South Korea one day. I was watching television

35:07.480 --> 35:15.480
 and there's like famous Korean Kpop stars crying and doing some fundraising concert.

35:15.480 --> 35:19.480
 And I literally thought, oh my God, something is horribly going wrong in this country. Why

35:19.480 --> 35:26.480
 are these people crying? It was a cheery campaign. And then later it was showing that it was

35:26.480 --> 35:33.480
 an animal rights campaign to helping out cats and puppies in the shelters.

35:33.480 --> 35:39.480
 Do you know anybody sheds their tears like that to another human being right now? No,

35:39.480 --> 35:44.480
 right? People rather give millions of dollars to save some dolphins than saving these children

35:44.480 --> 35:52.480
 right now being raped in China. And I think I love Elon Musk. I love his voice. I love

35:52.480 --> 35:57.480
 these people want to go to the moon, Mars. And then people told him like, yeah, we went

35:57.480 --> 36:01.480
 to the moon like I did not know in North Korea.

36:01.480 --> 36:06.480
 But I think that's what upsets me. Why there is not even one single human with that kind

36:06.480 --> 36:13.480
 of brilliance in their brain. They can save so much suffering, but nobody does anything.

36:13.480 --> 36:20.480
 I think that's when I feel like hard to find hope in humanity. And that's when I get so

36:20.480 --> 36:26.480
 upset. Because think about like even Biden or Trump or Obama. They know what's happening

36:26.480 --> 36:31.480
 in North Korea exactly, right? I mean, we see satellite photos. There's public executions.

36:31.480 --> 36:37.480
 I mean, the UN says this is a Holocaust happening again. And it's happening. If the Holocaust

36:37.480 --> 36:43.480
 is happening again, how, why, how are you okay doing nothing about it? But somehow humans

36:43.480 --> 36:51.480
 are able to okay nothing, anything. And this is like, this is hard. Like when people say

36:51.480 --> 36:56.480
 I'm going to change the world. I want to make a difference. Like it's hard to believe it,

36:56.480 --> 36:57.480
 you know?

36:57.480 --> 37:02.480
 Yeah, that we can turn our back to human suffering at scale when it's right in front of us. I

37:02.480 --> 37:08.480
 mean, that makes you think about the Holocaust. This is just, everybody was looking the other

37:08.480 --> 37:12.480
 way because it was almost too hard to look at it.

37:12.480 --> 37:17.480
 No, it's not. It's an easier thing. Like that's the thing. I was like here to speak at the

37:17.480 --> 37:21.480
 South by Southwest a few years ago. And like they're, everybody's talking about like Elon

37:21.480 --> 37:26.480
 Musk project going to the moon, right? We're going to be multi, like species. I was like

37:26.480 --> 37:32.480
 back then I didn't even know who he was. So if you guys are trying to go out to this earth,

37:32.480 --> 37:37.480
 you haven't even explored our earth yet. You cannot go to North Korea right now. You haven't

37:37.480 --> 37:43.480
 explored that part of our, our like planet. Can we do that first and then move on?

37:43.480 --> 37:49.480
 Explore the landscape of human suffering, like alleviate suffering in the world. There's

37:49.480 --> 37:55.480
 a lot of suffering happening in Africa that has to do with disease. And for some reason

37:55.480 --> 38:01.480
 it's, even though we turn our back to that kind of suffering too, we still can try to

38:01.480 --> 38:08.480
 do something about it. And there's still efforts in terms of healthcare, in terms of medicine,

38:08.480 --> 38:13.480
 in terms of bioengineering, in terms of like all these efforts to help people from disease.

38:13.480 --> 38:17.480
 But like, that's almost like converting it into an engineering problem and trying to

38:17.480 --> 38:24.480
 solve it. That somehow is easier for us humans. But when there's obvious sort of non disease

38:24.480 --> 38:34.480
 related torture of humans, we look the other way. Whether it's China or it's North Korea.

38:34.480 --> 38:40.480
 Yeah. I mean, that has to be changed somehow. We have to change that somehow.

38:40.480 --> 38:45.480
 It's the thing right now, like the China, like they bring the Xinjiang riggers, right?

38:45.480 --> 38:51.480
 They say, oh, this is a vitamin, take it. And then it kills their sperm and make them

38:51.480 --> 38:56.480
 not reproduce. Their birth rate gone down something 47 to something 50% in the one year

38:56.480 --> 39:02.480
 time. It's a genocide in 21st century. And they get those people and get their like organs

39:02.480 --> 39:08.480
 out. Imagine if there's some people who do that with the cutie puppies and cats. There's

39:08.480 --> 39:14.480
 going to be insane amount of product. They're going to destroy everything. And this is like

39:14.480 --> 39:20.480
 a human nature that I don't get. Why there's so much anti human sentiment in this modern

39:20.480 --> 39:26.480
 world? We don't have to. The fact that I was saying like, the fact that you care about

39:26.480 --> 39:31.480
 animals rights is beautiful because you care about something who cannot speak for themselves.

39:31.480 --> 39:35.480
 The fact that we care about animals is because they cannot speak for themselves, right? They

39:35.480 --> 39:40.480
 don't have that ability. And there are many people who cannot speak for themselves right

39:40.480 --> 39:45.480
 now. And why do you refuse to be the voice for them? Because they are simply being a

39:45.480 --> 39:53.480
 human. And maybe it connects to us not being proud of who we are. Like, I don't know what

39:53.480 --> 39:59.480
 it is. Why do they deny humans this way? Maybe they don't like themselves.

39:59.480 --> 40:05.480
 Yeah, it's almost, we would have to acknowledge some dark things about ourselves in order

40:05.480 --> 40:16.480
 to start helping. What's the solution? So, you know, I see two solutions. One is in the

40:16.480 --> 40:28.480
 military side. It's assassination or the full on invasion. And then on the activism side,

40:28.480 --> 40:38.480
 which is figuring out ways to, like you said, sort of let people in North Korea understand

40:38.480 --> 40:44.480
 their situation, sort of from within try to reform. Or maybe there's others, obviously,

40:44.480 --> 40:50.480
 there could be activism from the outside to build up momentum for the entirety of the

40:50.480 --> 40:56.480
 world, especially the world that is not just the United States or Europe, but also is Russia

40:56.480 --> 41:05.480
 and China and so on. What are your ideas here? What we can do as individuals and as countries?

41:05.480 --> 41:10.480
 I think the first thing that we can do is speak about Chinese role in this sponsoring

41:10.480 --> 41:16.480
 dictatorship in North Korea. Like, I happen to have so much struggle talking about North

41:16.480 --> 41:21.480
 Korea, right? They say, how North Korea is possible? Why is it like the way like this

41:21.480 --> 41:30.480
 is 99% accountability going to CCP? Kim Jong Un cannot last without Chinese help even one

41:30.480 --> 41:36.480
 week. This is completely funded. This Holocaust is funded by CCP. But if you talk about in

41:36.480 --> 41:42.480
 the mainstream, of course, they don't buy it. And I think it's in a way North Korea

41:42.480 --> 41:47.480
 is a lot easier to solve than even in the Middle East. There's nothing conflict like

41:47.480 --> 41:52.480
 between people. There's no ideology, no religion, nothing. People are peaceful, right? There's

41:52.480 --> 41:59.480
 not even one civil, like any discontent among the people. Our problem is there's a dictator

41:59.480 --> 42:05.480
 funded by the second economic power in the world. And even any military, they know if

42:05.480 --> 42:09.480
 they kill Kim Jong Un, they're going to get killed by Chinese. Nobody can dare to stand

42:09.480 --> 42:16.480
 up against Kim Jong Un because China is backing it. So somehow here in the West, we collectively

42:16.480 --> 42:21.480
 acknowledging that China is the responsible person for these crimes against humanity in

42:21.480 --> 42:26.480
 North Korea. Then we can somehow, I don't know, talk to them.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
 Stand up to China.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.480
 Exactly.

42:28.480 --> 42:35.480
 We're failing to do that in a way, in all kinds of avenues of life, of public life,

42:35.480 --> 42:46.480
 because for many reasons, they're probably primarily financial. But it also, I'm against,

42:46.480 --> 42:54.480
 I don't know, maybe you can correct me. I'm against sort of making China this evil enemy

42:54.480 --> 43:02.480
 because I've seen this with Russia as well. And I don't think that leads to progress.

43:02.480 --> 43:10.480
 I think you want to highlight, you basically want to help the Chinese people become the

43:10.480 --> 43:17.480
 best version of themselves. So speak to the Chinese people and not making the leaders

43:17.480 --> 43:24.480
 of China into these caricatures of devils. I feel like the Cold War, the way it was done

43:24.480 --> 43:30.480
 in Russia, both sides, they were caricaturing each other through propaganda and the result

43:30.480 --> 43:34.480
 was not productive at all. It did not help Russia become the best country it could be.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.480
 It did not help America become the best country it could be. And the same thing with China.

43:38.480 --> 43:45.480
 I feel like making them into this enemy, like being afraid of China, making them into the

43:45.480 --> 43:49.480
 thing that's going to spy on us, that's going to destroy the rest of the world, that's not

43:49.480 --> 43:55.480
 going to help China reform themselves. They're going to plant their feet. The dictators,

43:55.480 --> 44:01.480
 the evil people will become more evil. The power hungry will become more, like they will

44:01.480 --> 44:08.480
 centralize the power more. It feels like, maybe naive, but it feels like it should be

44:08.480 --> 44:15.480
 like, again, love, not violence that solves this thing. Now, of course, in North Korea,

44:15.480 --> 44:23.480
 it's like long gone. 80 years, almost 80 years. Love is not going to solve that problem.

44:23.480 --> 44:26.480
 I mean, I don't, it's very difficult.

44:26.480 --> 44:32.480
 They have tried that because of the sunshine policy, which is there's two people walking

44:32.480 --> 44:37.480
 down the street and the sun and the wind made a battle. So who can take off that man, take

44:37.480 --> 44:43.480
 off jacket? So wind tried to blow as much air as he could. And then that man was like

44:43.480 --> 44:47.480
 putting more like his jacket on, right? Not taking off, but sunshine came. Okay, I'm going

44:47.480 --> 44:51.480
 to give him a lot of warmth. And then he took his jacket out and came out. So that was the

44:51.480 --> 44:56.480
 theory. Let's give North Korea as much love as they want. Let's give them a lot of money,

44:56.480 --> 45:00.480
 whatever they want, let's give to them so they know that we are not here to attack them.

45:00.480 --> 45:05.480
 And North Korea, what they did was the guy who did the sunshine policy in South Korea

45:05.480 --> 45:11.480
 named Kim Dae Sung won the Nobel Peace Prize for that. And Kim Jong Il used the money to

45:11.480 --> 45:17.480
 build nuclear weapons. So that's how they came with the nukes. So I think that's the

45:17.480 --> 45:20.480
 thing. I hope that love solves problems.

45:20.480 --> 45:25.480
 But there's got to be a way and the hope is with the 21st century is you can directly

45:25.480 --> 45:29.480
 speak to the people somehow. When there's no internet, when there's nothing like that,

45:29.480 --> 45:34.480
 it's hopeless. I think China, there's a hope that China is still connected to the internet.

45:34.480 --> 45:43.480
 I love your optimism. I have seen the actual dark side of China on the underground. I hope,

45:43.480 --> 45:48.480
 I think that's the thing. People in the West, right? They say, oh, how can it be that bad?

45:48.480 --> 45:56.480
 They ask me like, I walking passing this young teenager man and later the war with my sister.

45:56.480 --> 46:03.480
 He's like intestine coming out through his back, right? And even in that moment, what

46:03.480 --> 46:06.480
 he wanted was, please give me food. He was hungry.

46:06.480 --> 46:11.480
 His intestine is hanging out of his body and he's asking for food.

46:11.480 --> 46:17.480
 Do you know what humans demand when they die in North Korea? All they want is eating, right?

46:17.480 --> 46:18.480
 Yeah.

46:18.480 --> 46:24.480
 And people say, oh, nothing can be that bad. But people just here haven't seen an actual

46:24.480 --> 46:26.480
 true evil.

46:26.480 --> 46:31.480
 Would you say that the evil comes from a tiny minority of people or is it permeate much

46:31.480 --> 46:40.480
 larger parts of the population? Like if we look at sex trafficking, how many people,

46:40.480 --> 46:54.480
 like is it 99.9% of the people are longing to do good in the world? Or is there, is it,

46:54.480 --> 46:58.480
 or do we all have the capacity for evil in certain kinds of environments, certain kinds

46:58.480 --> 47:05.480
 of governmental structures inspire a large percent of the population to do bad things?

47:05.480 --> 47:11.480
 I think humans are capable of anything. There's no exception. I don't think there's any saint

47:11.480 --> 47:17.480
 who born with that morality. I think in North Korea, you can say initially that there's

47:17.480 --> 47:24.480
 few guys in the top wanted the power and then doing this, but eventually made a society

47:24.480 --> 47:29.480
 where people don't even know what compassion is. We don't know the concept of, we don't

47:29.480 --> 47:33.480
 know that you need to feel bad for another human being when they're suffering. The fact

47:33.480 --> 47:39.480
 that you know compassion is in your knowledge. That's why you do that. Humans need to learn.

47:39.480 --> 47:44.480
 It's not anything bad about human nature. It's just saying humans are capable of everything.

47:44.480 --> 47:50.480
 We are the most adaptable species on the planet. That's why we created the internet, like

47:50.480 --> 47:55.480
 talking this way, right? No other animals have done it because we are so adaptable.

47:55.480 --> 48:01.480
 That is a good thing and that's a bad thing. So in the adaptive situation, they all can

48:01.480 --> 48:06.480
 be, I mean during the Holocaust, right? Those people, they could have been capable of good

48:06.480 --> 48:12.480
 too if they were exposed to different system. That's why when people underestimate evil,

48:12.480 --> 48:19.480
 that's what scares me. Evil is evil. It's a different thing. It's a completely different

48:19.480 --> 48:26.480
 thing. Of course, I get your idea. We don't want to isolate 1.3 billion human beings on

48:26.480 --> 48:32.480
 Earth by Chinese, but the thing is we are talking about this regime, not the people.

48:32.480 --> 48:37.480
 I love Chinese people. I speak Chinese. I love all about the country, but this system

48:37.480 --> 48:43.480
 does promote evil. Well, that's an optimistic view actually because we can fix systems.

48:43.480 --> 48:48.480
 Yeah. It's harder to fix people. So if we fix systems, then the people are adaptable,

48:48.480 --> 48:53.480
 as you said. Absolutely. I mean that, and then the question is, first of all, you have

48:53.480 --> 48:58.480
 to talk about it just as you're doing. You're right now like this little flame that burns

48:58.480 --> 49:07.480
 bright, and it's really important for North Korea, but just keep talking about it until

49:07.480 --> 49:13.480
 hopefully it leads to at the highest levels of power, revolutionizing the systems in the

49:13.480 --> 49:21.480
 world. And then in China and in North Korea, do you see North Korea being a potential instigator

49:21.480 --> 49:28.480
 in nuclear war? They will not start a nuclear war as long as they can do whatever they want

49:28.480 --> 49:35.480
 right now, right? North Korea's army is not designed to fight the enemy. They're designed

49:35.480 --> 49:40.480
 to prevent their own people, the coup d'tetre and the revolution with their own citizens.

49:40.480 --> 49:46.480
 That is 1.6 million North Korea with a tiny country, the fourth largest armies in the

49:46.480 --> 49:54.480
 world. So this country is designed to fight with their own citizens. And the army, the

49:54.480 --> 50:00.480
 fourth largest in the world, is designed to basically fight its own people. Oppress their

50:00.480 --> 50:10.480
 own people. That's what North Korean military is about. Okay. Let me ask you some aspects

50:10.480 --> 50:16.480
 about North Korean life. Can you describe the songbun system of ascribed status used

50:16.480 --> 50:21.480
 in North Korea? Yeah. So that's a very interesting thing, right? Right now there are a lot of

50:21.480 --> 50:26.480
 people playing with this ideology of like democratic socialism, socialism, communism,

50:26.480 --> 50:31.480
 whatever you call it, Marxism, Leninism, right? They have all like these similar features

50:31.480 --> 50:38.480
 where we give collective power to a certain entity and they will make the decision for

50:38.480 --> 50:44.480
 bigger good, right? And North Korea came up with the idea, the Kim Il Sung. He was the

50:44.480 --> 50:49.480
 Leninist. He was a Marxist saying, I'm going to create the most equal society on human

50:49.480 --> 50:56.480
 face. So it was communist North Korea. And then they came up with this songbun system.

50:56.480 --> 51:04.480
 It's like family caste system. Three big categories, warrior, wavering, and hostile. And that in

51:04.480 --> 51:09.480
 between three classes, they divide into 50 different classes. So a lot of people don't

51:09.480 --> 51:14.480
 even know which exact class you belong to. That's a secret government document. And that's

51:14.480 --> 51:20.480
 how they decide your future. So in a way, North Korea, before you're born, your life

51:20.480 --> 51:25.480
 is determined for you. And this is a joke, right? They dreamed of creating the most equal

51:25.480 --> 51:31.480
 society. They ended up with became most unequal society in the face of humanity. So there

51:31.480 --> 51:38.480
 are 50 different classes and where the one guy on the top became a god. So when this

51:38.480 --> 51:42.480
 animal farm, as we keep saying, like there's so many, all the animals are equal and some

51:42.480 --> 51:46.480
 of the animals are more equal than others. Exactly. But it's not only, it's just more

51:46.480 --> 51:54.480
 equal. One guy in North Korea became a god. So North Korea was born out of a Marxist ideals.

51:54.480 --> 52:06.480
 Yeah. From Stalin. Can you comment on Juche ideology, which seems to be its own kind of

52:06.480 --> 52:15.480
 socialism, but with unique aspects here, it really does ideologically says the importance

52:15.480 --> 52:21.480
 of having a great leader. Is there some interesting similarities or differences that you can comment

52:21.480 --> 52:27.480
 on between other implementations of communism throughout history, the Soviet Union, China,

52:27.480 --> 52:33.480
 elsewhere? So Juche is very unique. It came on around the 90s after Soviet Union collapsed.

52:33.480 --> 52:39.480
 So before that, North Korea was very still loyal to the Marxism and Leninism, which is

52:39.480 --> 52:45.480
 state takes care of you. We are going to give you the right education, healthcare, your

52:45.480 --> 52:49.480
 livelihood, everybody is going to be equal. You're going to have in the working collective

52:49.480 --> 52:55.480
 farm, collective worker place. Everybody collectively do things together and let's work for the

52:55.480 --> 53:02.480
 paradise. But 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. And until then, North Korea was heavily subsidized

53:02.480 --> 53:07.480
 by Soviet Union's aid. And then Soviet Union didn't give them anything. So not 3 million

53:07.480 --> 53:13.480
 people dying on the streets. The regime then came up with the idea, okay, our goal is what

53:13.480 --> 53:19.480
 is successful ruling for us is keeping the 10% of population alive, which is in the capital

53:19.480 --> 53:26.480
 Pyongyang. So they designed the hunger games. There is a capital, 13 other districts, everybody

53:26.480 --> 53:32.480
 on the countryside on purpose being starved. So those people who are starving cannot thinking

53:32.480 --> 53:36.480
 about meaning of life, cannot thinking about shooting to the moon, right? They're not going

53:36.480 --> 53:40.480
 to think about anything or they're going to think it's like finding next meal. All on

53:40.480 --> 53:45.480
 purpose. All on purpose is manmade famine. International community was begging to give

53:45.480 --> 53:52.480
 North Korea food. Why not? Still at the UN, they beg to give North Korea formula, medicine

53:52.480 --> 53:56.480
 and food. They are begging, can you please feed your people? And Kim Jong Un said, no,

53:56.480 --> 54:01.480
 thank you. Last year, like when North Korea had a horrible, horrible flooding, South Korean

54:01.480 --> 54:06.480
 president begging, can you get, can I give you please some medicines? Like, no, because

54:06.480 --> 54:10.480
 he wants to be the one provider. He doesn't want people to think other people giving him

54:10.480 --> 54:15.480
 the thing. So on purpose, other people are starving. And that Juche idea is that's when

54:15.480 --> 54:20.480
 it's coming from. So until that communism was about like state is being a father figure,

54:20.480 --> 54:25.480
 takes care of all your needs, right? Give the power to us and you're all good. But North

54:25.480 --> 54:30.480
 Korea regime says, okay, now we cannot give people's ration. So which means Juche means

54:30.480 --> 54:37.480
 self reliance. You need to take care of yourself while you're giving every right to us. So

54:37.480 --> 54:43.480
 now in the 90s, the regime told us, okay, we are not going to give you ration. You cannot

54:43.480 --> 54:49.480
 trade. That's illegal, but you find your own way to survive. So be self reliant. That's

54:49.480 --> 54:54.480
 what Juche is. But when you're a guy, you can do whatever you want. You don't need to

54:54.480 --> 55:00.480
 make a sense. That's the difference being a God and being a leader. When it is religion,

55:00.480 --> 55:06.480
 it's not for survival. You cannot challenge it. God's way is suspicious. God works in

55:06.480 --> 55:11.480
 a mysterious way. So when you're a God, people are not going to say, oh, this doesn't make

55:11.480 --> 55:16.480
 sense, right? You're going to, okay, whatever God says, as a human being, we can never change

55:16.480 --> 55:20.480
 his thought. It's unbelievable what regimes can do.

55:20.480 --> 55:39.480
 There's something about famine that is another level of evil to me. What Stalin did in Ukraine

55:39.480 --> 55:51.480
 in the thirties, fuck them. This is what torture is. Cannibalism.

55:51.480 --> 55:58.480
 North Korea too, they eat humans right now in 21st century. 7 billion people on this

55:58.480 --> 56:04.480
 earth right now. You make enough food for 10 billion people. Nobody should be starving

56:04.480 --> 56:10.480
 right now. It's worrisome to me. The humanity is moving forward with the technological advance,

56:10.480 --> 56:15.480
 blah, blah, blah. We are going so fast in advancement. And we are leaving this like

56:15.480 --> 56:21.480
 25 million human beings in the cage, completely leaving them behind. And North Korea is living

56:21.480 --> 56:28.480
 like 16 centuries. This morning I was taking shower, beautiful shower. One never knew what

56:28.480 --> 56:34.480
 shower was. I was bathing a few times a year, going to the river. How do they even know

56:34.480 --> 56:40.480
 what shampoo is? And this is how human beings in 21st century are living. And it doesn't

56:40.480 --> 56:48.480
 bother us. And rather, most people are obsessed being a vegan. How do you reconcile this?

56:48.480 --> 56:52.480
 I think we get used to stuff very quickly. We get used to comforts. That's just the way

56:52.480 --> 56:58.480
 of human life. You take the beautiful things for granted. So I try to appreciate everything

56:58.480 --> 57:05.480
 I have. So whether it's like the food I have now or like the luxury to have a diet and

57:05.480 --> 57:09.480
 be struggling with that. Or just the basic simple moments of being alive with the people

57:09.480 --> 57:14.480
 I love. Or actually I get like, I think I'm on drugs all the time because I feel like

57:14.480 --> 57:22.480
 just even like this mug, everything on this table just brings me joy. But it's like filling

57:22.480 --> 57:29.480
 your life with joy in the full capitalistic American way, you can still at the same time

57:29.480 --> 57:35.480
 not feel too bad about yourself and still focus on the suffering in the world. And I

57:35.480 --> 57:46.480
 think there's some way that in trying to build a better world in America, it has ripple effects

57:46.480 --> 57:55.480
 elsewhere. Sort of like, so I'm a fan of rockets in space. It sounds perhaps counterintuitive

57:55.480 --> 58:04.480
 but sending rockets to space will help solve the North Korea problem because it lets people

58:04.480 --> 58:12.480
 dream and build cool stuff. So it's not the rocket, it's the other people that are inspired

58:12.480 --> 58:17.480
 by the rocket and then look to other problems in the world. I mean, that's what Elon did

58:17.480 --> 58:23.480
 is like he saw problems in the world and thought like, what can I do to help it? And I think

58:23.480 --> 58:30.480
 the North Korea one is a tough one though, because that ultimately has to do with revolutionizing

58:30.480 --> 58:37.480
 government. We got to change China. That's what it takes. Changing China's Communist

58:37.480 --> 58:43.480
 Party is impossible. That's why we couldn't solve North Korea for that many decades. For

58:43.480 --> 58:52.480
 now it's China, but it's China, it's Russia, it's certain aspects of the United States

58:52.480 --> 58:59.480
 and struggling with that. There's a bunch of technologies that are striving at this.

58:59.480 --> 59:04.480
 For example, I don't know what your thoughts about cryptocurrencies. I love it. So like

59:04.480 --> 59:12.480
 there's a idea that money could be a way to destroy or to challenge the power centers

59:12.480 --> 59:18.480
 of the world. Yeah. So if you take away the power from fiat currency and give it to this

59:18.480 --> 59:21.480
 thing that can't be controlled by government, this cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin,

59:21.480 --> 59:26.480
 Ethereum, all those kinds of things, that's a way to get money into the hands of people

59:26.480 --> 59:32.480
 to where the government can't take that money away. But North Koreans don't have electricity,

59:32.480 --> 59:38.480
 no internet. So we can do that with China. We can do it with a lot of African dictatorship

59:38.480 --> 59:44.480
 countries, right? I do think big cryptocurrency is such a fascinating technology, right? I

59:44.480 --> 59:50.480
 think this is an amazing experiment when that power is in our hands. I'm a huge out of

59:50.480 --> 59:56.480
 game believer, but I think North Korea is too behind. I think that's what is unique

59:56.480 --> 1:00:01.480
 about North Korea is that most of the things that we talk about, it's a different planet

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:10.480
 literally. The common law that we have is not applicable. What about Kim Jong Un?

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:18.480
 Kim Jong Un, yeah. Is he intentionally evil or is he mindlessly propagating an evil system

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:22.480
 created by his ancestors? What's your sense of the man?

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:29.480
 So with Kim Il Sung, I can give him more benefit of that. He was a initial true believer of

1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:36.480
 communism. But then as later he gained the power, he realizing, I guess back then he

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:41.480
 thought most of people are dumb, right? Individuals dumb. So therefore I need to make a decision

1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:47.480
 for all of you. That pure arrogance came from out of him. Even that I can tolerate. Okay,

1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:53.480
 fine. And Kim Jong Il, who never like, yeah, fine. He grew up in that system too. But Kim

1:00:53.480 --> 1:01:02.480
 Jong Un is very unique. This guy was educated in Switzerland in the heart of democracy.

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:09.480
 He knew how human beings should be treated. As a child, he went, when you're a child,

1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:14.480
 your brain is very susceptible, right? It will change anybody. Like why the mall was

1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:19.480
 off, that's like changing young people's minds. Like that's every revolutionary they do, right?

1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:25.480
 They go change young people's minds first. This guy was so obsessed with power, him being

1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:31.480
 a God. Even starting in Switzerland didn't change him. And that's why I think that's

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:37.480
 a pure evil. I can give him more benefit of that to his grandfather and father. But when

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:43.480
 it comes to Kim Jong Un, this is like what pure evil looks like. Pure selfish being.

1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:46.480
 That's what it looks like.

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:51.480
 Is there some sense where he's justifying everything he's doing to himself? Or do you

1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:56.480
 think there's a psychopathic aspect to where he enjoys the suffering?

1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:02.480
 I think in his life, right, I read a lot about like North Korea, a lot of CIA documents,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:07.480
 a lot of intelligence people worked there. And even like worked in North Korean type

1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:13.480
 elites and escaped. I could hear about them. So Kim Jong Un, when they are born, they treat

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:20.480
 like gods. So they never have a sense of them being a human. They're like equal with the

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:26.480
 others. For them, like we are just any kind of tool. Like that what Napoleon like thing

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:32.480
 does, right? Anybody is a tool. Like once boxer dies, get him slaughtered for my cause.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:36.480
 And they do not even feel guilty about it because they don't view us that you deserve

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.480
 your worthy of it. Yeah, that's right. So it's not like he even feels, he doesn't even

1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:48.480
 recognize that's a suffering. Like of course this is what you do serving me. Because I

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:54.480
 am, I am this. So I think that's like beyond that. It's not like suffering enters his

1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:00.480
 mind. He doesn't even think what we go through. So he thinks of himself as a god. And then

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.480
 everybody else is just tools that they're disposable. Right. There was rumors several

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:14.480
 times of him dying. Yeah. Do you think he is, obviously his health is not good. Do you

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:21.480
 think he will die soon? What happens if Kim Jong Un dies? Well, when it comes to North

1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:26.480
 Korea, anybody knows what they're going, what Kim Jong Un does is lie, right? Nobody knows.

1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:32.480
 I'm sure CIA knows, but they may never reveal that. CIA has enough intelligence to can tell

1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:37.480
 where Kim Jong Un is, what he's doing. They just don't assassinate him because they don't

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:42.480
 see the means of it right now. Do you think they can assassinate him? They can. They do

1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:45.480
 have ability to get assassinated. Why the hell did they not assassinate him? Because

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:50.480
 they don't care. They don't care about the suffering of 25 million people. They got to

1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:54.480
 pay the price. If they assassinate Kim Jong Un, they got to pay the price afterwards.

1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.480
 There'll be financial, there'll be political price to pay. It'll anger China. Absolutely.

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:04.480
 That is a huge piece for them. And then they'll have to deal, obviously there'll be financial

1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:10.480
 and military consequences of having to deal with the turmoil, the uncertainty, the revolutions

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:15.480
 that will spring up. Yeah. That's the thing. That's why they don't want to take that risk.

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:20.480
 They don't want to do anything. The US now became very passive when they pursue these

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:24.480
 moral values to the rest of the world. They did the same thing with the Holocaust in the

1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:30.480
 early days, actually. Yeah. They didn't care. And that's what their policy has been. They

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:37.480
 don't care. So if Kim Jong Un dies, it's going to be very hard for North Korea to replace

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:43.480
 anybody in his position because Kim's is a brand. It's not just a leader for us, right?

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:49.480
 Whenever we think of Kim, who came with my mind, who's almost a God figure. North Korea

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:56.480
 is the number 10 religion in the world. They copied the Bible. So if you believe that,

1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:01.480
 if there are people who believe in God and Jesus Christ, how do you not believe that

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:06.480
 North Koreans believe in the same thing? So Kim Il Sung's grandfather and his parents

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:14.480
 were devout Christians. So Kim Il Sung grew up this Christian like verses. So when he

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:20.480
 finding his country, he said, I love my people so much that I'm giving you my son Kim Jong

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:26.480
 Il. His body dies, but his spirit is with us forever. Who can know how many here I have,

1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:31.480
 what I think. And when we suffer, we go to paradise with him. And when you block every

1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:36.480
 single information going to country, of course, people are going to believe it. So who would

1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:45.480
 be the successor if he dies? He has a son, first son born 2009 and not not old enough

1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:51.480
 if he dies now. So either his sister might rule for a short amount of time as not like

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:58.480
 a leader, but like we like temporary placement. And then when the son is older enough, he

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:02.480
 might take it off because it's a kingdom. That's most likely and China will do everything

1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:10.480
 they can to maintain that status quo for the North Korean regime. So North Korean people

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:17.480
 have no option here. We just need some leader to courageously come up and do the right thing.

1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:22.480
 So we can't just wait this out. No, we can't. It's not something that takes its course

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:27.480
 and then change. Like we not even know that economic freedom does not bring political

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:33.480
 freedom. We know in China, it doesn't. That's the unique thing about freedom. You got to

1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.480
 fight for it. Otherwise, you don't ever get it. Freedom is something that has to be fought.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:43.480
 And if nobody fighting for freedom, it's not going to be there.

1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:49.480
 Can we talk a little bit about freedom? What does it mean to you? Having had, we talked

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:57.480
 about love in that same way about freedom, having sort of discovered it later in life.

1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:59.480
 What does it mean to you?

1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:07.480
 I think every day I get a new definition of freedom. It is a never ending journey, having

1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:17.480
 this relationship with being free and what it means to be free, right? I think you definitely

1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:22.480
 can live life without being free and also happy life too. I saw a lot of North Korean

1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:28.480
 elites who are fat and have power, but didn't have freedom, were very happy. In a way, happier

1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:33.480
 than the people that I found in New York were like investment bankers and consultants in

1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:41.480
 Manhattan and 70% of them go like talk therapist. I was very confused. I remember writing my

1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:47.480
 book in New York. My editor was saying, Yami, you know you're traumatized. You need to go

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:54.480
 talk to a therapist. I was like, what is therapy? What is trauma? Because in North Korea, they

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:59.480
 don't have word for stress or trauma because how can you be stressed in a socialist paradise?

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:05.480
 They don't let you be knowing what that is. Then they were like, yeah, hearing people

1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:12.480
 having problems, go talk to therapist. I was like, how much is it? $200 per hour and it's

1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:23.480
 a discounted rate too. I was like, no, thank you. We know that freedom comes with responsibility

1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:32.480
 and in a way, it's not that easy to be free, thinking for yourself constantly. In a way,

1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:37.480
 I understand. Let's give government every power we have. Let them decide what education

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:42.480
 that I get. Let them decide where I live. Let someone figure that out for me. That's

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:48.480
 how North Korea began, hoping the government is going to represent my own interests, believing

1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:56.480
 that they were good. With that benefit of doubt and good faith, it began the nightmare.

1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:01.480
 Freedom is not like a gateway to be happy at all. In a way, it can make life a lot more

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:07.480
 complex, but then it's fun, isn't it? You start thinking for yourself. You start making

1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:13.480
 mistakes. It's so fun to be free, even though you can be suffering way more than the people

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:14.480
 who are not free.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.480
 The thing about freedom is when you have freedom, you also have the responsibility for your

1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:28.480
 actions. That could be a huge burden because if you succeed, it's you, but if you fail,

1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:34.480
 it's you. If you do horrible things, it's you. If you don't do something, for example,

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:41.480
 if you don't help people in North Korea, it's you. That's a huge burden. Living with that

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:46.480
 burden is a kind of suffering. There's some aspect in which freedom is suffering.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.480
 It is suffering.

1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:54.480
 Because life is suffering, and then freedom is you as an individual fully living through

1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:01.480
 that. See, you talked, you're friends with Michael Malice. He believes, and so I want

1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.480
 to kind of ask you about government. He believes, he's an anarchist, and he believes kind of

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:19.480
 in freedom fully implemented in human societies, meaning that humans should all be free to

1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:25.480
 choose how they, you know, transact with each other, how they live together. There shouldn't

1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:31.480
 be a centralized force that tells you what to do. Do you think there's some role for

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.480
 government in a healthy society?

1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:36.480
 Yeah.

1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:42.480
 If we look at North Korea, there's the most horrible implementation of government, but

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:49.480
 then if we look at what the United States strives to be, at least in principle, there's

1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:55.480
 an ideal of a government that represents the people and helps the people. Is there a place

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:59.480
 for that kind of ideal, or is government always going to get us into trouble?

1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:05.480
 I am not, I mean, I spoke to Michael Malice. I kept asking why he's an anarchist, right?

1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:11.480
 And he doesn't even believe in military, none of that thing. And I was like, I don't think

1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:17.480
 I want to be in that world you're describing. That's pretty scary. I want the law enforcement.

1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:26.480
 I want like, I don't, in a way that, so why equality makes no sense is that the fact that

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:31.480
 when you and I were born, we were born in a very different capability of thinking, different

1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:36.480
 intelligence, different capability in our physics, right? So equality is nonsense. You

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:43.480
 can never achieve that, right? So to me, that's been, it's very scary in America.

1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:45.480
 When the government tries to enforce.

1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:48.480
 To make equality on everybody, that is impossible.

1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:53.480
 Specifically equality of outcome. So like, so given that we all started different places,

1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:58.480
 enforce, like measure in some kind of way where people stand, and if they're an equal,

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.480
 enforce equality. And that's what leads to the kind of things that you mentioned with

1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:06.480
 the class system in North Korea.

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:12.480
 Yeah. So I think that's why government can be bad. They can be very dumb. And another

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:17.480
 thing is that they cannot know what you want. A lot of times people don't even know what

1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:22.480
 they want as an individual. Like how the heck do you assume government is going to know

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:28.480
 what is best for you? Nobody knows. We just all do our best. I do think though some governments

1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:34.480
 like in Switzerland, you know, have more power, give power to the different state can be good.

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.480
 I think I'm more, you know, like giving power to the state and let individual decide where

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:45.480
 they want to go in within states. Like, I mean, why did you choose Texas, right? There's

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:50.480
 no income tax, right? Like there's a lot of things people find Texas, like, you know,

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:56.480
 charming and they come here. So in a way that I don't want to be in a one strong government

1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:01.480
 that makes every single thing the same way. In a way, I want to kind of experiment to

1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:08.480
 everything. We can have anarchy state. There's no police, nothing going on. You can be whatever

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:13.480
 you want. And you can go to a state where it's like abortion is bad, blah, blah, this

1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:19.480
 is bad. All this like conservative values. And let the ideas compete and let them how

1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:25.480
 they're being practiced in real life. But I think it's very scary when the US government

1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:32.480
 is getting bigger and bigger and then they try to make every state under one big government.

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:35.480
 And that's like when I get really alarmed.

1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:40.480
 Are there things that you see in the United States in the current culture that's kind

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:47.480
 of has echoes of the same things you saw in North Korea that worry you?

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:56.480
 Absolutely. It's in America now the meritocracy doesn't matter, right? It's evil. The white

1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:02.480
 man's idea of talking about if you're competent enough, they say, oh, if you're coming from

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:07.480
 rich white family, you are going to be competent. So other people don't have a chance. But look

1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:13.480
 at Asians who came from nothing as competent and go to Harvard Law School and medical school.

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:19.480
 So it doesn't almost is like there's no incentive for you to work hard anymore in the system

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:24.480
 right now. That is North Korea. There's no incentive because you are born with your class

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:29.480
 already. So no matter what you do, you can never. So the horrible thing about North Korean

1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:35.480
 system is that there's nothing holding Mary up. So if you're coming from other cultures

1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:40.480
 that like Meghan Markle joined the royal family and she became a lawyer, you go up by North

1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:45.480
 Korea. If someone from high class going to marry somebody down, you only go down with

1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.480
 them. That's how they prevent class mix.

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:54.480
 Right. That kind of enforces the separation because there's a huge disincentives to go

1:14:54.480 --> 1:15:03.480
 to marry to integrate between classes. What do you do about this kind of, you know, especially

1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:08.480
 universities, but in companies, I'm thinking about starting a company. So I'm looking at

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:15.480
 this very carefully. There's these ideas of diversity and meritocracy. That's a tension.

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:25.480
 So I think there's a big way in which diversity broadly defined is not at all in a tension

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:33.480
 with meritocracy. So having a variety of people, backgrounds, way of thinking, all those kinds

1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:40.480
 of things is a huge benefit to any group. But the way diversity is often defined is

1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:48.480
 by sort of very crude classes of people, whether it's by skin color or gender or some very

1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:55.480
 kind of large group way. And that actually does two things in my mind. One, it drowns

1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:02.480
 out real diversity or not real, but the full spectrum of diversity, which is like within

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:13.480
 class diversity of like, are you somebody who is exceptionally good at mathematics?

1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:17.480
 Are you somebody who's exceptionally good at psychology? Are you good with people? Are

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:23.480
 you good with numbers? All that kind of stuff that I think spans or intersects in fascinating

1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:29.480
 ways with these kinds of groups. So that's diversity. And then meritocracy is this thing

1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:34.480
 that probably the reason I wanted to move to Silicon Valley and the reason I didn't

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:40.480
 is like having a fire to change the world within you. Like meritocracy is like, I want

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.480
 to be the best in the world at this and I will strive and work hard, not stepping on

1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:54.480
 others, but like purely within yourself, be the best version of yourself. That idea is

1:16:54.480 --> 1:17:03.480
 in some ways being not celebrated or demonized. It's literally meritocracy is being demonized

1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:10.480
 right now in America. Working hard is a symbol of you coming from some established family.

1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:17.480
 The fact that you celebrate accomplishment, hard work is a sign of your patriarchal,

1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:23.480
 whatever thing they call it. And they want to abolish that. They want to like stop giving

1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:28.480
 kids grades. That's what they're already doing, right? They want to stop. They want to like

1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.480
 we should abolish like SAT in America they take to go to college, right? They won't even

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.480
 abolish that. Yeah, some kids have no ability to do math. So why do we have to force them

1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:44.480
 to learn math? And that's what comes with humans overcome challenges. That's what makes

1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:49.480
 us special. But then like, because it's kids coming from this family, let's find a reason

1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.480
 why they cannot, and then they don't have to do that thing. But they still deserve the

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:59.480
 same job. They need to be a lawyer and doctors. And that's like what in North Korea was like

1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:05.480
 not, there was not even meritocracy beginning with, right? Did you born in the same family,

1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:11.480
 the family, the blood, right? Like if one person does something wrong, it's like collective

1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:17.480
 guilt. Because I spoke out, three generations of my family got punished, who I left behind.

1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:23.480
 And then in America, I see the same thing. Like if you're somehow great, great grandfather

1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:30.480
 on the slave, now you are privileged and you're guilty because you are white and guilt. But

1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:36.480
 how do you change your ancestor? How did you have a saying on it? And that is where there's

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:41.480
 no way out. There's no forgiving, there's no moving forwards. And this current culture

1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:47.480
 in America now, like I remember at Columbia, like before class, everybody had to go around

1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:53.480
 saying, tell us what your pronoun is. And my English, my third language, I learned as

1:18:53.480 --> 1:19:00.480
 an adult. Even saying he and she, I'm confused. It's a pure mistake. And they say, call me

1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:04.480
 they, because I'm gender fluid. Basically, I can be a girl, but next hour you talk to

1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:10.480
 me, I'm a boy, right? And if you don't do it right, they like look at you, why are you

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:16.480
 doing it? Right? It makes me so nervous. And this is where I come to, this is a regression

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:23.480
 of civilization. We are regressing as a humanity here. Like the enlightenment, all of those

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:28.480
 things made us so much brighter and looking forward. And now we are going backwards.

1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:33.480
 Well, I think there's a pendulum aspect to it because it's my hope in terms of backwards.

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:38.480
 So pendulum goes backwards too, but it just goes back and forth, I think. And then in

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:44.480
 the long arc of history, we're making progress. I think all of the discussions of diversity

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:51.480
 and inclusion and all those kinds of things, I always thought that they're healthy in moderation.

1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:57.480
 They should be a small part of the conversation amongst other things. The natural aspect,

1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:03.480
 it seems that they kind of have this way of just consuming all conversations. It's like

1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:08.480
 the meetings, like diversity and inclusion meetings multiply somehow, where it's like

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:12.480
 the only thing that you're talking about. And it's very kind of absurd. And when I look

1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:20.480
 at, even at MIT, it's a strangely disproportionate amount of discussions about that. And also

1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:25.480
 to me as an engineer, those discussions are very frustrating because they don't seem to

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:36.480
 actually do anything. So they want to bully people instead of creating systems that fix

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:42.480
 definitive problems. And that in itself, that kind of bullying, that's the same kind of

1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:47.480
 thing you saw in terms of McCarthyism in America against the communists. You certainly saw

1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:55.480
 that in Soviet Union against everybody who's not communist. It creates hate, not progress.

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:59.480
 When you talked to Jordan Peterson recently, and people should listen to that conversation,

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:10.480
 it was a fascinating one. I think he almost got emotional on the discussion about universities

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:16.480
 and your experience with Columbia because he, like myself, for perhaps different reasons,

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:21.480
 have a hope for our academic institutions. Some of the most incredible people, some of

1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:27.480
 the most incredible engineering and idea development, innovation happens in universities. And so

1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:35.480
 we both deeply care about them. Is there something, so the reason he got emotional, the reason

1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:44.480
 he was kind of hurt is the fact that you did not, you were not deeply inspired by your

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:46.480
 experience at Columbia.

1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:54.480
 It made me dumber. It made me scared. It made me terrified that I had to censor myself in

1:21:54.480 --> 1:22:01.480
 America. Are you seriously telling me that you don't ever censor yourself? Can you truly

1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:09.480
 say whatever you want about race, about anything, gender? We all censor ourselves. Let's be

1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:15.480
 honest, right? We are all doing that. And that's what I learned. I thought I was coming

1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:20.480
 to a country where never needed, like first thing my mom taught me growing up in North

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:27.480
 Korea was, don't even whisper because the birds and mice could hear you. And I thought,

1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:32.480
 okay, now America is truly the land of the free, home of the brave. You can say anything

1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:38.480
 you want, and then you have freedom to change your mind and evolve. But the people now demand

1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:43.480
 you to be the perfect version they demand you to be. You cannot change your mind. And

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:49.480
 then what is the meaning of life if you cannot grow? You should feel safe to talk about anything,

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:53.480
 and then later, okay, I was wrong. But now if you do that, you got to get penalized

1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:54.480
 for it.

1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:59.480
 I mean, censorship is a funny thing because you probably should not say dumb things. You

1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:04.480
 should try to say things you want to say in the most eloquent, the most effective way

1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:10.480
 you can. So, I mean, that's what editing is, right? So there's some level of like being

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:17.480
 careful with what you say, not because you're afraid of some overarching kind of group of

1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:22.480
 bullies, but you want to be the best version of yourself when you express stuff. But there's

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:27.480
 some sense where in the university setting, you can put that self censorship like level

1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:33.480
 down more and say stupid stuff and explain and play because you should be forgiven for

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:39.480
 that kind of play, especially when you're discussing difficult aspects of human history,

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:46.480
 whether that include racism, that include atrocities. I'm still nevertheless sort of

1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:53.480
 hopeful, but at the same time, I'm surrounded by engineers. So I don't get to interact with

1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:57.480
 people in humanities much. And it seems like there's getting worse.

1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:59.480
 It's a good thing. It's a good thing.

1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:07.480
 Yeah, I don't know. Well, I do sort of interact with psychologists, but they haven't touched

1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:14.480
 on those kinds of topics yet. I still, sort of in defense of psychology, I still, I wish

1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:15.480
 I had more numbers.

1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:16.480
 Yeah.

1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:22.480
 But I still feel like most psychology people don't partake in this kind of stuff either.

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:26.480
 They're just doing excellent research. We're just highlighting, this is what America does

1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:35.480
 well. You're kind of highlighting anecdotal experiences and making a big deal out of them.

1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:40.480
 But that's good because like it's a slippery slope. If those things start to overtake all

1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:44.480
 of academia, it starts becoming a big problem, even in the engineering field. So we should

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:49.480
 be concerned. But it is truly tragic that somebody who's exceptionally well read like

1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:56.480
 you, whose fire was stoked first with Orwell, that fire should burn bright. Like this should

1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:03.480
 not be, you should be writing many books. You know what I mean? Like, and you'll be,

1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:08.480
 you talk to Jordan, you know, it's very possible depending what you want to do with your life

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:14.480
 that you'll be a future Jordan Peterson, right? So like that, and Columbia should be a place

1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:21.480
 that enriches your mind. And the fact that it didn't is tragic.

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:26.480
 I mean, I did the same. It's like I was there four years. It wasn't like I had a one class

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:31.480
 that was bad in a one semester. That was the thing. When Dr. Piro was asking, is there

1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:38.480
 any one class that had no sentiment of this virtue, signoring, politically right? There

1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:48.480
 was none. Entire course, I think I took 126 credits total. Not even one class. Doesn't

1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:52.480
 matter we were talking about classic art. And that's the thing. I literally thought,

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:57.480
 okay, I pushed the last semester to call like the art and music, right? So I thought this

1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:02.480
 is going to be the least politically correct class I can take. And then it begins with

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:08.480
 who has problem with calling this course the Western civilization of art and music. And

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:12.480
 everyone's like raising their hands. Because like, why do we have to learning about this

1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:18.480
 Beethoven, Mozart, the bigots, and all the people, like, you know, everything ruined

1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:26.480
 by white men. And it's even music, even these paintings. And as I didn't raise my hand,

1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:30.480
 everyone was looking at me. How do you not have the problem with this? Like you should

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:36.480
 hate this, you're Asian. So I think that's the thing is I think the problems are way

1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:43.480
 deeper than what people think. And that's what when I learned is like, it's not that

1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:50.480
 safe in America, we can go complete to the south. And looking at even Europe, that is

1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:57.480
 like, I used to be way more optimistic. But now I actually see, wow, this country can

1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:03.480
 go to south. And we might, if US forced them, right, this is the only country left to battle

1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:08.480
 with the Communist Party in China. We may lose the opportunity to be free ever again

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:10.480
 as a humanity.

1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.480
 Wow. So I mean, that puts a lot of value on having these kinds of conversations. It

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:20.480
 is, I mean, I'm troubled. I'm troubled by a lot of things. But like censorship on YouTube,

1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:26.480
 for example. Yeah, it was very annoying to have to listen to Donald Trump all the time.

1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:31.480
 Just like create drama, like news cycle was completely drowned out by Donald Trump. But

1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:42.480
 like banning him from Twitter, it was like, that was scary for me, because it's like,

1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:48.480
 that's a step towards a direction where you're going to, like, where does that take us? You're

1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.480
 going to silence people, then it's like Jordan Peterson is next.

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:58.480
 That's why we need to promote freedom of thinking and speech, right? And the one thing that

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:08.480
 I love about Dr. Peterson is, he's a psychologist, right? He talks about we think by talking.

1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:12.480
 That's why when you go to therapy, you talk and then you hear yourself and then you think

1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:19.480
 and you come up to the answer. It's so important for humans to talk so we can think. So when

1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:24.480
 they say you cannot talk means you cannot think. And they don't know the consequences

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:31.480
 of that. And this is why I promote, I want the freedom of speech, even though it hurts,

1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:37.480
 ridiculous, you know, sometimes it can be dangerous. But the price, the alternative

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:42.480
 is so bad that we should take the, you know, make this trade off. Everything has a trade

1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:48.480
 off in this world. And it comes with a sacrifice, right? So I think that's what I want to say.

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:53.480
 That's what I want to see in America. But it's unfortunately like the people like you

1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:59.480
 say, who decides what is hate speech? What is dangerous? That's what I've been getting

1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:05.480
 scared. Because everybody's imperfect. How do we want to give that power to them? And

1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:09.480
 they're going to decide, today they might agree with me, say, okay, your speech is good,

1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:14.480
 promotes good, and then they might come back next year and say your speech is bad. What

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:19.480
 are you going to do when that happens to you? We have to almost like get ideas out and then

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:23.480
 play with them. I think what's a really important component of that is forgiving each other

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:31.480
 for like realizing that we're a different person day by day and certainly years later.

1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:36.480
 And I think some of that is both cultural mechanisms of saying like we forgive each

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:42.480
 other for wrong ideas or not wrong ideas, but for who we are, the full evolution of

1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:48.480
 the human being, for the steps we've taken on that evolution, and also creating mechanisms

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:56.480
 that allow you to allow us to forgive each other. Like, for example, on Twitter is like

1:29:56.480 --> 1:30:02.480
 horrible with this because one of the main viral ways that people create drama on Twitter

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:08.480
 is like pulling up an old tweet that somebody said, right? And then saying, oh, this is

1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:14.480
 the guy that thinks that. But that's like the opposite of the mechanisms we need to

1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:20.480
 forgive ourselves, forgive each other for the things we've said in the past. And so

1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:28.480
 part of that is the cultural, part of this is the technological mechanisms. You mentioned

1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:34.480
 Jordan Peterson. You had a great conversation with him. What was chatting with him like?

1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:40.480
 I'm just curious because he's deeply passionate, especially on the Soviet Union side about

1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:46.480
 the atrocities of these kinds of systems. What was it like? What did you agree with

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:52.480
 him on? What did you disagree? What were some things you both kind of learned from each

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:57.480
 other through that conversation, do you think? So here, so my story, the Jordan

1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:04.480
 Peterson, a very long one. So one day I was walking down in Chicago, and they were like

1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:11.480
 huge theater was sold out. It says a big letter, Jordan Peterson sold out. And then it was

1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:15.480
 a huge theater in the middle of Chicago, right? Like, this is my comedian, like who can be

1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:22.480
 selling this entire thing out at like 7pm? And then with my ex husband, we were walking

1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:28.480
 the street. And then we saw people were like selling this like tickets, like for a very

1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:33.480
 higher price, right? And then do you want to take it? And then he was like, yeah, sure.

1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:42.480
 We went in, it's packed. And then I was just happy birth or like, but I wasn't able to

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:46.480
 understand his English that much. My English was still bad. And you didn't know who he

1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:50.480
 was really? No, no. You were just curious? Yeah, it was like 2018. Who's the guy that

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:56.480
 sells out a thing? A theater? Yeah. Yes, I saw Dave Rubin came out before him and make

1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:00.480
 jokes. I still don't know who Dave Rubin is. Afterwards, I met them all. But back then

1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:05.480
 I had no clue what that is. And then he was giving lessons. But what I got from that night

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:12.480
 was not what Jordan said, but what people did on the audience. These people like I don't

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:20.480
 know, thousands of people in this big theater, crying like babies. And that was like, whatever

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.480
 that guy is doing is very special, right? He wasn't like making any jokes. He had no

1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:31.480
 slides, just a one simple person standing in the huge, giant theater talk. And long

1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:38.480
 time too. And people cry as like, wow, okay, whatever that is, I gotta check it out. And

1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:43.480
 then I got home. And then later, many years later, I got a book. And I will start reading

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:49.480
 his book. And it talks about, it explains so much, right? Like now at Columbia, I learned

1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:55.480
 like everything gender is like made up concept, construct, like the hierarchy is my man's

1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:00.480
 idea of making the hierarchy. And then he begins with the number one, the laughsers

1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:06.480
 had the hierarchies, evolution of history that is within us, that we want a hierarchy,

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:12.480
 right? And then chapter five about socialization of child, you know, how do you raise them?

1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:19.480
 And all of it, and then what's why telling the truth is matters, right? And there's a

1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:25.480
 white, like in his entire 12 lessons, I read it and it's like, I was so grateful that I'm

1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:30.480
 alive with this. There's people always say, if Socrates is alive, how much would you pay

1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:36.480
 to have lunch with him? That kind of thing, right? So for me it was like, okay, I'm like

1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:42.480
 alive in the same contemporary world as one of the greatest thinkers of my entire generation.

1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:53.480
 And then like, how much money would I pay? No limit amount. And I like reached out to

1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:57.480
 Michaela on her podcast on Twitter and connected. And then one day she said, do you want to

1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:05.480
 be on Michaela's podcast? I was like, what? I was like, of course. And I was very nervous,

1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:13.480
 but I didn't expect him to be like that connected. Cause I thought he was a psychologist, like

1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:18.480
 he saw so much suffering in the world. He studied Soviet Union, his hobbies collecting

1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:24.480
 those things to remind him of the suffering of a human being. So sometimes some people

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:29.480
 hear so much atrocity, they become like very, you know, not engaged.

1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:30.480
 Yeah, desensitized.

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:31.480
 Desensitized.

1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:35.480
 He felt, he was feeling, he was, it's almost like he was living through the experiences

1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:39.480
 with you as you were talking about it. It was an amazing conversation. So Jordan is

1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:43.480
 one of the great thinkers of our time, but I would say the greatest thinkers of our time

1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:49.480
 is Michael Malus. So you've also got a chance to talk to him. So he wrote a book on North

1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:55.480
 Korea. It's an interesting style book. I learned a lot from it. I learned a lot from Michael

1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:02.480
 about it. And it's interesting that he chose North Korea as a thing to study. That he,

1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:10.480
 of all people, this fascinating human being that is Michael, chose this darkest of aspects

1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:17.480
 of humanity to study. What do you think of Michael? What do you think of his book on

1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:20.480
 North Korea called Dear Reader that people should definitely check out?

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:25.480
 Absolutely. So back then, when I reached out to Michael through mutual friends in South

1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:33.480
 Korea, my English wasn't good. So I got a copy in my hand. I tried to read and a lot

1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:40.480
 of them I didn't understand. So, but I thought it was very fascinating how he explained North

1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:45.480
 Korea through the Dear Leader's perspective, right? Nobody has ever done that. And you

1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:52.480
 can reveal so much about the state and absurdity of the entire situation. And also through

1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:59.480
 humor. And that's what's amazing about Michael. He knows the full gravity of tragedy. He knows

1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:04.480
 the full suffering. He's not just like people here in America on the BuzzFeed making fun

1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:09.480
 of Kim Jong Un's haircut. They don't care what people go through. Michael cares.

1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:16.480
 Deeply cares. And then he still does ridiculous jokes. So that kind of reveals in a dark way

1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:22.480
 the absurdity of evil. And he does that masterfully. Do you?

1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:25.480
 He's a genius. He is definitely a genius.

1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:34.480
 All right. If he watches this, let's not make his head too big here. But is there some

1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:43.480
 aspect to, I mean, there is an absurdity to the whole thing. Kim Jong Un is this, I mean,

1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:45.480
 he's almost like a caricature of evil.

1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:46.480
 It's a joke.

1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:47.480
 It's a joke.

1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:52.480
 A lot of people think it's a joke. They just think like, this is too, too absurd. They

1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:58.480
 just, they laugh. Like, can you imagine you laugh at Holocaust? This is that ridiculous.

1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:04.480
 Can you maybe psychoanalyze that a little bit? Because that's where my mind goes to.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:14.480
 Like, he's so ridiculous that you can't, it's almost like hard to believe this is real.

1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:23.480
 Is that just, is that just my kind of and people's desire to escape the cruelty of reality

1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.480
 by just kind of making a joke out of it?

1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:34.480
 I think it is a few things, right? Like, so North Korea as a nation, number one or number

1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:41.480
 two smartest IQ people in the world, despite their malnutrition. So...

1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:48.480
 So there is, I mean, that's an interesting point. So in your sense, the people...

1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:49.480
 Are not dumb.

1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:57.480
 Still carry the sort of the brilliance. There's a culture there that's like hungry to become

1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:04.480
 realized. Like the people that are silenced by the electricity, by the actually having

1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:08.480
 no food, all those kinds of things. Like, if you add the electricity, if you add the

1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:11.480
 food, you're going to have a cultural center of the world.

1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:16.480
 Like South Korea. That's what they exactly did, right? The exact same Korea. One became

1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:23.480
 like 11th largest economy. One became the world's most like poorest nation, right? And

1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:28.480
 this is a perfect example. Like if, I don't know if you read that book, Why Nation Fails.

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:34.480
 The system. It's not about a culture. It is not about people. It is not about IQ. What

1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:40.480
 makes us too different is a system. South Korea, North Korea is a perfect example of

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:46.480
 that. One is exact same capability. We are a homogeneous country, same language, tradition,

1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:52.480
 all of that. We gave them different system. One is free democracy, one is dictatorship

1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:59.480
 and came up with the biggest different result. And I think North Korea reveals that to us.

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:05.480
 It's not because we are great that we are living in this prosperity. Free market. The

1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:12.480
 ideas gave us to this. The system we built, our ancestors built, gave us this privilege.

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:18.480
 It's not us. Nothing is about us being special here, right? The system that we have is quite

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:25.480
 special. And North Korea proves that to us. It doesn't matter even if you're smart. That's

1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:32.480
 all irrelevant. And I think that's why people just keep denying that they want to feel special.

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:38.480
 Because I'm awesome, I got all of this. No, it's not you, you got this. And when people

1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:44.480
 say, I hate capitalism. I was like, without capitalism, how do you came up with this thing?

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:47.480
 Literally, how did you come up with this?

1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:57.480
 The systems matter. And they matter way more than this individualistic society would like

1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:08.480
 to imagine. It is the most important thing you can have in life. Choosing the right system.

1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:14.480
 Do you have advice for young people today? You've lived an incredible life and you have,

1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:20.480
 I hope, an incredible life ahead of you. What advice would you give to young people today,

1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:28.480
 high schoolers, college students, how to be successful in their career or maybe successful

1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:30.480
 in life?

1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:39.480
 Last thing I want them to feel is guilty. It doesn't do anything, right? So I hate when

1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.480
 people talk about, oh, why guilt? It's like, that doesn't make even any sense, right? I

1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:51.480
 think the fact that they are born with freedom is a blessing for all of us. It's not like

1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:56.480
 I want them to want to do something because they are guilty. I want them to do something

1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:02.480
 because they are grateful. It is true. Like we are sitting here, the fact why I have children

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:09.480
 is suffering, having kids you don't sleep, costly, like so much work. Like any like logical

1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:15.480
 rational mind, you should never want children, right? Why would you do that to yourself?

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:21.480
 Especially as a woman, right? You don't want to do that to yourself. But think about like

1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:26.480
 we are sitting here today, two of us in this amazing technology, this country, because

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:31.480
 somebody in Savannah hundreds of thousands of years ago, they're hunting berries and

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:38.480
 surviving cold. Every suffering they can imagine, they fall for us. That's why we ended up here.

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:45.480
 So life is ultimately bigger than us. And I think that's what I want them. It's not

1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:50.480
 like I want them to do the right thing and be the best version of themselves. It's like,

1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.480
 I want them to feel grateful. And we should be grateful for the freedom and then take

1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:00.480
 full advantage of that. I mean, it starts with the freedom to experience everything

1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:08.480
 in life. And for your life, literally, like how my father, like, you know, working, dying

1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:16.480
 is a lot easier than living. Dying takes like few minutes, right? Maximum. And living takes

1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:22.480
 forever. So when I was facing this unbelievable challenge, I thought, okay, this most rational

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.480
 thing I can do is killing myself right now. But the hardest thing I can choose is choose

1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:33.480
 to live. And my father did that. Even in the concentration camp, even no matter why he

1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:40.480
 said, life is a gift. You need to fight for it. And I think that's what's missing here,

1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:46.480
 that we don't think life as a gift. It's a gift. Like, how many people had to fight

1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:52.480
 for me to be here today? Think about the sacrifice they made for many, many, many generations.

1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:56.480
 I don't even know what they went through. I can't even fathom what they went through.

1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:02.480
 They fought for life. Yeah. And that is my responsibility enough. So it doesn't make

1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:08.480
 them, their fight was not meaningless, right? It meant something because now I'm carrying

1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:18.480
 on that fight. You mentioned considering suicide. Do you think about your mortality now? Now

1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:27.480
 that you're perhaps in a slightly more comfortable place, do you still think about death? I do

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:35.480
 because I was informed actually when I was 21 that I was on the killing list of Kim Jong

1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:43.480
 Un by South Korean intelligence. And then I had to live with that, right? But now I

1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:48.480
 actually feel more because, I don't know, you follow Jamal Khashoggi's story, the Saudi

1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:54.480
 journalist who got chopped off in Turkey embassy, right? His reason why he got killed was he

1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:01.480
 became very prominent on Twitter. He had a huge voice and Saudis followed him. Now I

1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:07.480
 became very first North Korean to have this many social media followings. And recently

1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:13.480
 North Korea started an investigation team to analyze whatever I do, even though it's

1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:18.480
 first time for them. So they don't even know what to do at this point. They're like, this

1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:24.480
 is so new. What do we do? We do Kim Jong Nam. Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of Kim

1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:30.480
 Jong Un got killed in Malaysia. That is another tragedy that I feel so sorry for the US government

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:36.480
 is that Kim Jong Nam was giving information to the CIA for the past like 10 years. That

1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:41.480
 trip, when he got killed in Malaysian airport, he was meeting up with the CIA agent for two

1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:49.480
 days on the Northern Ireland. CIA could have protected him. They didn't. They let him die.

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:50.480
 Who killed him?

1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:55.480
 North Korean Kim Jong Un killed him. Do you know the Malaysian, the ladies, the VX, the

1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:02.480
 nerve agent. North Koreans killed him in Malaysian airport, in the international land. So I mean

1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:07.480
 North Korea, who was a US resident and the Washington Post journalist, when he got killed

1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:13.480
 in Saudi like a lamb, they chopped him into pieces. In that most inhumane death, what

1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:20.480
 was the consequences for the Saudis? Nothing. The word is we think we live in a country

1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:26.480
 where there's no justice. There is no accountability for killing any dissent, no matter how big

1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:27.480
 their names are.

1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:34.480
 So you don't think your vast and quickly growing social media presence protects you?

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:39.480
 No, it does the opposite. Because Kim Jong Un, initially when I spoke out, I don't know

1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:44.480
 if you went through it, they did everything they could to character assassinate me, saying

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:50.480
 I'm a liar, I'm a CIA spy, I get paid. And then they reached out to Penguin saying,

1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:54.480
 we're going to blow up. You cannot write this book. And they did it with Sony. They

1:45:54.480 --> 1:46:00.480
 had a Sony studio for making that stupid movie interview. And then Penguin did their

1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:05.480
 investigation. They met every survivor that I went through in the desert. They got the

1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:09.480
 voice recordings of them because they don't want them to change their mind later. People

1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:14.480
 remember differently. So they got the voice recordings, the Penguin Regal team got all

1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:18.480
 the audios, and now we are ready for the lawsuit. We are going to publish this book because

1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:23.480
 we checked, verified every single thing that was going in the book. And North Korea couldn't

1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:24.480
 do anything anymore.

1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:29.480
 But that's character assassination. Which by the way, that's a whole other conversation

1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:33.480
 that you were able to survive that. I appreciate the kind of strength it requires to survive

1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:39.480
 that because you don't know. And your character being assassinated is in some ways can be

1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:42.480
 as painful as actual assassination.

1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:48.480
 It's worse. It's worse. Everybody think you're a liar. Everybody think you're a liar. And

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:53.480
 now everybody, like you said, this nature of internet is that as long as something is

1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:57.480
 written in the internet, they think that's a fact. Any stupid person can start a blog

1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:02.480
 and write about you. But they think, oh, because it's written on the internet, it's legit.

1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:07.480
 Especially negative stuff. That's the thing I was kind of trying to elaborate on. There's

1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:13.480
 a viral aspect to calling somebody a fraud or a liar that nobody questions whether it's

1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:21.480
 true or not. It just spreads. And it's a dark side of our human nature that we want to destroy

1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:23.480
 the people who are rising.

1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:29.480
 We cannot stand it. Any change maker in this world who wasn't controversial, right? Martin

1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:37.480
 Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, he was called as a terrorist. So I just did not know.

1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:41.480
 The character assassination is the thing. It'll probably continue with you.

1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.480
 It will continue with me forever.

1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:48.480
 So you have to get stronger and stronger, I think, in the face of that. But actual assassination,

1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:54.480
 perhaps it's me being hopeful because I have a situation with Russia that I hope I'm not

1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:00.480
 under. Well, I don't care actually. But there's some aspect in which social media presence,

1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:08.480
 I thought, protects you a little bit. Because just imagine the outrage from an attempted

1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:10.480
 assassination of you.

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.480
 But what was the outrage when Jamal Khashoggi got killed like that?

1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:17.480
 Was the social media presence large?

1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:23.480
 Over one million people. I don't have that following. He was 1.6 million Twitter followers.

1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.480
 And the outrage wasn't there?

1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:31.480
 No. Because Saudis spoke to Amazon, to Prime Studio, Netflix. There were people who made

1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:37.480
 a documentary about him but told everybody cannot get that deal. So there was a huge

1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:42.480
 censorship on that. And people, of course, I mean, they can talk about it one day. Some

1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:45.480
 dissent from Saudi got killed. Horrible.

1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:47.480
 But it just dissipates.

1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:51.480
 They move on to the next cute puppy, right? The next cute cat. That's what the nature

1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:57.480
 of this new generation does. They desensitize. It doesn't affect them. They keep following

1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:02.480
 the instant pleasure, instant high. That's what Instagram does to you. It changes your

1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:07.480
 brain. That's what I was reading. We spoke about shallows. We became shallow and shallow

1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:12.480
 and our brain changed permanently. So this new generation, we can get them angry for

1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:18.480
 like 10 minutes, create hashtags for one day. But then as quick as that was, it goes down

1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:22.480
 like instantly. And I think that's the...

1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:27.480
 Well, that means that... Okay. So that means that there is... It's an effective way to

1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:33.480
 get rid of opposition is by murdering them. And that means United States, if it stands

1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:38.480
 for freedom, if it stands for the freedom of exchange of ideas, should be protecting

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:39.480
 people like you.

1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:45.480
 But they don't because they don't want to be involved. They didn't even protect Kim

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:50.480
 Jong Nam who was giving information 10 years risking his life. That's what is so... I

1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:58.480
 mean, working for CIA is not bad. The thing is that he was giving information to bring

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.480
 down the regime. That is valuable. That is something noble about him. But then you just

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:09.480
 don't go extra miles to that. That's when I lost my faith in the US system as well.

1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:15.480
 Like this country just cares about saving face. What is most the minimum cost they pay

1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:21.480
 for anything? And when I was in South Korea, constantly, every single day intelligence

1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:26.480
 calling me. The North Korean agent going this place, where are you going? The US system

1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:32.480
 came to US, nobody. That's when people said, are you a CIA agent? I wish they called me.

1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:38.480
 I wish they called me. I really truly do. But nobody, nobody does here. I'm sure they

1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:43.480
 know what's going on. But the South Korean agent is more like, oh my gosh, we don't want

1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:47.480
 you to get killed as a South Korean citizen, right? Yeah. And now I'm trying to become

1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:54.480
 your citizen. So it's in a way, it's, I don't know what's worse. Are you afraid for your

1:50:54.480 --> 1:51:03.480
 life? I was afraid. For the several, three, four years, I was afraid. But I had to come

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:09.480
 to terms with it. Like my enemy is not some crazy psychopath. It's a state with nuclear

1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:15.480
 power to attack the most powerful country. If Kim Jong Un decides if I die, I'm going

1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:22.480
 to die. It's not up to me, right? So in a way, also it's liberating that you, it's like

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:27.480
 if you are like afraid of some mobs or some like gangsters on the street, it's almost

1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:32.480
 like you have power over a little bit. You got to be like thinking that's my fault. I

1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:37.480
 went that way, right? But when it comes to Kim Jong Un, I know like my enemy is so much

1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:44.480
 bigger than me. It's in a ways of liberation. And also, you know, I just, I live a lot.

1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:49.480
 So I have seen a lot. I seen everything. I don't have that much regret left here. Like,

1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:54.480
 okay, I'm going too soon. You know, it's like, okay, maybe it's time. Like death is a part

1:51:54.480 --> 1:52:02.480
 of life. So. In some sense, you're willing to accept death to keep fighting for freedom

1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:09.480
 in your, in at least in part a place you call home. Yeah, it is. Do you hope that one day

1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:15.480
 you can return to North Korea? I hope so. I hope I bring my son and tell him this is

1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:21.980
 like where your ancestors from too. It would look very different than the place you came

1:52:21.980 --> 1:52:32.480
 from in your, as you hope. Do you hope that there's a democracy one day that North Korea

1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:42.980
 looks like South Korea? Well, that would be in paradise, right? But I'm a rational optimist.

1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:48.880
 I'm not like just optimistic because I have to be. I think as long as there are people

1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:54.980
 who have changed the world, right? Like who believed in something and worked for it. And

1:52:54.980 --> 1:52:59.280
 like, I don't know, like there's like Alice Shroves, a few people holding entire this

1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:06.080
 world, right? I really believe in that. I think as long as that continues, that can

1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:11.280
 happen in my country. As long as people like you someday want to decide to do something

1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:15.680
 with North Korea and working for it, using your brainpower to solve this puzzle, how

1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:21.680
 fascinating would that be? That's why I continue to speak, continue to recruit. To inspire

1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:29.980
 millions to do something. The books you like are all the books I love. I have to mention

1:53:29.980 --> 1:53:37.780
 this. You mentioned briefly on the, with Jordan, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is an incredible

1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:43.580
 book. I mean, I don't know exactly what I want to ask here, but there's some, I think

1:53:43.580 --> 1:53:52.980
 the book kind of, through telling a story, reveals that life is suffering and yet there's

1:53:52.980 --> 1:53:59.380
 beauty in it. The beauty in every moment that uses kind of a river to paint a metaphor.

1:53:59.380 --> 1:54:07.080
 Is there something that you could say, speak to like how that book impacted your life and

1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.980
 the way you live life, maybe the way you see life, whether it's on the life of suffering

1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:14.580
 side or that life is beautiful side.

1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:20.180
 I mean, he goes the entire journey, right? He goes in this state of, I'm so enlightened

1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:25.080
 that I cannot deal with the people who are there in love and quiet about it. Right? They're

1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:33.380
 like, that's so like primitive. Once he has his own son, he actually being attached. He

1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:37.980
 actually cares. He actually really does whole thing, right? That's a thing that he used

1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:44.180
 to think not. Once his son comes find him, he looks at life differently. I think that's

1:54:44.180 --> 1:54:49.780
 the thing. I did have that kind of journey where, oh, nothing matters, right? So bitter.

1:54:49.780 --> 1:54:58.580
 So so like, so cynical. And after I met so many incredible people, I was talking about

1:54:58.580 --> 1:55:05.180
 that person who told me he was gay. He told me, I love you. And I was like, why do you

1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:10.680
 love me? In the past, people when they wanted me was because they want to rape me. Everybody

1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:15.680
 wanted something from me. That's why they wanted me. And I never understood. You can

1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:20.980
 love somebody unconditionally. And this gay guy, the last one was want to sleep with me,

1:55:20.980 --> 1:55:26.780
 right? And he loves me. And I think I had a blessing after my journey, meeting people

1:55:26.780 --> 1:55:32.380
 who loved me unconditionally because I was just being a human. And I think that's what

1:55:32.380 --> 1:55:39.580
 it is now for me that like him. I live for love now. I live for love. Any kinds of love.

1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:45.180
 Love for knowledge. I like, I read so many books because I love books, right? I love

1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:52.380
 what I do. I love my people. I love humanity. You know, even it sometimes annoys me. I love

1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:53.380
 myself.

1:55:53.380 --> 1:55:56.580
 And that's beautiful too. The annoying parts are beautiful too. What do you, let me ask

1:55:56.580 --> 1:56:01.180
 the ridiculous question. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Of what's

1:56:01.180 --> 1:56:02.980
 the meaning of life?

1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:10.380
 Well, I think at this point I stop questioning why I'm here, right? Like it doesn't matter

1:56:10.380 --> 1:56:15.180
 someone put the atom there or a big bang. I'm here. That's truth, right? I'm going to

1:56:15.180 --> 1:56:19.780
 accept that fully. So what, instead of me keep asking the impossible question, why I'm

1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:24.180
 here. I'm going to let you do that. Let the science do that, right? You guys go out in

1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:28.220
 the space and look for the evidence. I'm conducting.

1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:33.780
 You accept that you're here and you're just going to enjoy it. Like you're here for love,

1:56:33.780 --> 1:56:34.780
 as you said.

1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:40.580
 That's the thing. I think I'm here for the process of pursuing something bigger than

1:56:40.580 --> 1:56:47.180
 me. Process of doing something. It's not like a model. It's not a virtue signal or anything.

1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:52.980
 It just makes me happy that I fight for something bigger. Like than me, right? How boring is

1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:56.820
 that? Every day you get up like, Oh my God, I'm going to buy myself this. I'm going to

1:56:56.820 --> 1:57:03.100
 get this for myself. It's so boring, isn't it? So in a way, I think that's what it is.

1:57:03.100 --> 1:57:09.100
 I'm grateful that I'm in a state. I don't have to fight for myself anymore. But morning

1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:13.660
 people have to do that. And that's sometimes more than enough they have to do. And I salute

1:57:13.660 --> 1:57:19.780
 them. They are doing fighting, saving themselves every day. But now I'm not there. I'm very

1:57:19.780 --> 1:57:22.540
 blessed. That's why I'm very grateful.

1:57:22.540 --> 1:57:27.860
 Still fighting for something much bigger than you. But do you still believe that you can

1:57:27.860 --> 1:57:37.580
 change the world? That you can be a thing that, at least in part, helps North Korea

1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:41.300
 or even broader helps alleviate some suffering in the world?

1:57:41.300 --> 1:57:45.940
 So that's the thing. I was reading this book before by randomness, right?

1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:46.940
 Yeah.

1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:52.900
 I was like, oh my God, you're so courageous. You're amazing. I was like, no, I'm not. I'm

1:57:52.900 --> 1:57:58.180
 horrible. I know myself. You don't want to tell me that. It's random why I ended up here.

1:57:58.180 --> 1:58:02.980
 Like, why did I pick up English so quickly? Why do I love books? Right? I don't know why.

1:58:02.980 --> 1:58:03.980
 It's random.

1:58:03.980 --> 1:58:05.780
 Don't ask why. Just enjoy it.

1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:13.260
 Yeah, it's just random. I think I don't know how the history will remember me. I think

1:58:13.260 --> 1:58:17.860
 only thing I have to at this point to make sure is that the people after I consulting

1:58:17.860 --> 1:58:22.500
 a lot of security teams, like now North Korea became a lot smarter. Like you said, they

1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:28.300
 make it more disguised as a, like a suicide and a car accident. So when I die, they don't

1:58:28.300 --> 1:58:35.500
 even know I got killed. I think that's a higher chance. So I think that's a thing like people

1:58:35.500 --> 1:58:40.700
 are suffering, take it or not, it's your choice. And at least it's my responsibility for them

1:58:40.700 --> 1:58:44.740
 to know what's going on. I think if you did not know and didn't do anything, you're not

1:58:44.740 --> 1:58:51.020
 even guilty of a thing. But once you know, then you are not doing it. Then you, something's

1:58:51.020 --> 1:58:58.180
 like not right. So that's what I'm doing. Like I want people to know. And then what

1:58:58.180 --> 1:59:05.660
 they want to do is not my problem afterwards. Right? So my role is very small in that regards.

1:59:05.660 --> 1:59:12.940
 And I just hope that we're humanized North Koreans for the first time, because we have

1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:18.940
 been so dehumanized, right? Like we are like looking like robots. If you look at us marching

1:59:18.940 --> 1:59:24.800
 and cry, like when your leader dies, almost seems like we don't even have the same emotions.

1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:33.540
 People cannot connect us in the same level. And I think that's something is, that's something

1:59:33.540 --> 1:59:36.100
 media have done it to us.

1:59:36.100 --> 1:59:43.060
 And you're, you're shining a small light on this dark part of the world that I think,

1:59:43.060 --> 1:59:50.500
 and you make it, you're so modest, but I think, I think you will have that little light just

1:59:50.500 --> 1:59:58.200
 might be a big thing that changes that incredible amount of suffering that's happening on that

1:59:58.200 --> 2:00:03.980
 part of the world. You know what I mean? You're, you're an amazing person. I'm so fortunate

2:00:03.980 --> 2:00:08.060
 to get a chance to talk with you. I can't wait what you do in the future. You're, I

2:00:08.060 --> 2:00:13.860
 hope you write many more books. I do hope you continue making videos, continue having

2:00:13.860 --> 2:00:18.580
 conversations. You're an inspiration to me and millions of others. I really appreciate

2:00:18.580 --> 2:00:19.580
 you talking with me today.

2:00:19.580 --> 2:00:22.460
 I'm so honored. Thank you.

2:00:22.460 --> 2:00:26.820
 Thank you. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Yeonmi Park. And thank you

2:00:26.820 --> 2:00:33.460
 to Belcampo, Gala Games, BetterHelp, and 8th Sleep. Check them out in the description to

2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:38.940
 support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Bob Marley. Better

2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:45.640
 to die fighting for freedom than be a prisoner all the days of your life. Thank you for listening

2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:57.500
 and hope to see you next time.
