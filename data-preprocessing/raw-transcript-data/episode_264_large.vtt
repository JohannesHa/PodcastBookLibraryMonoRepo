00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
 If you read a half hour a night,

00:01.640 --> 00:03.520
 the calculation I came to is that you can read

00:03.520 --> 00:05.200
 a thousand books in 50 years.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.160
 All of the components are there

00:07.160 --> 00:09.480
 to engineer intimate experiences.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.560
 Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery,

00:11.560 --> 00:13.360
 the most tantalizing mystery of all.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.880
 How many humans need to disappear

00:15.880 --> 00:17.660
 for us to be completely lost?

00:19.840 --> 00:22.320
 The following is a conversation with Tim Urban,

00:22.320 --> 00:25.480
 author and illustrator of the amazing blog

00:25.480 --> 00:28.040
 called Wait, But Why?

00:28.040 --> 00:30.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.200
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:32.200 --> 00:33.320
 in the description.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.280
 And now, dear friends, here's Tim Urban.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.160
 You wrote a Wait, But Why blog post

00:41.160 --> 00:42.680
 about the big and the small,

00:42.680 --> 00:45.640
 from the observable universe to the atom.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.500
 What world do you find most mysterious or beautiful,

00:48.500 --> 00:50.660
 the very big or the very small?

00:50.660 --> 00:54.080
 The very small seems a lot more mysterious.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.600
 And I mean, the very big I feel like we kind of understand.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.000
 I mean, not the very, very big.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.760
 Not the multiverse, if there is a multiverse,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.160
 not anything outside of the observable universe.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.040
 But the very small,

01:07.040 --> 01:09.560
 I think we really have no idea what's going on,

01:09.560 --> 01:11.240
 or very much less idea.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.080
 But I find that,

01:12.080 --> 01:13.640
 so I think the small is more mysterious,

01:13.640 --> 01:16.200
 but I think the big is sexier.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.320
 I just cannot get enough of the bigness of space

01:23.580 --> 01:26.300
 and the farness of stars.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.200
 And it just continually blows my mind.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.040
 I mean, we still,

01:30.040 --> 01:33.440
 the vastness of the observable universe

01:33.440 --> 01:35.800
 has the mystery that we don't know what's out there.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.240
 We know how it works, perhaps.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.880
 Like, general relativity can tell us

01:40.880 --> 01:42.780
 how the movement of bodies works,

01:42.780 --> 01:45.360
 how they're born, all that kind of things.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.240
 But like, how many civilizations are out there?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.400
 How many, like, what are the weird things that are out there?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.240
 Oh yeah, life.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.680
 Well, extraterrestrial life is a true mystery.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.720
 The most tantalizing mystery of all.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.080
 But that's like our size.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.660
 So that's maybe it's that the actual,

02:02.660 --> 02:04.080
 the big and the small are really cool,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.440
 but it's actually the things that are potentially our size

02:06.440 --> 02:07.720
 that are the most tantalizing.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.160
 Potentially our size is probably the key word.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.000
 Yeah, I mean,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.420
 I wonder how small intelligent life could get.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.400
 Probably not that small.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.360
 And I assume that there's a limit that you're not gonna,

02:18.360 --> 02:19.920
 I mean, you might have like a whale,

02:19.920 --> 02:21.840
 blue whale size intelligent being,

02:21.840 --> 02:23.340
 that would be kind of cool.

02:23.340 --> 02:27.120
 But I feel like we're in the range of order of magnitude

02:27.120 --> 02:28.720
 smaller and bigger than us for life.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.600
 But maybe not.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.200
 Maybe you could have some giant life form.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.000
 Just seems like, I don't know,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.640
 there's gotta be some reason that anything intelligent

02:36.640 --> 02:39.240
 between kind of like a little tiny rodent

02:39.240 --> 02:43.640
 or finger monkey up to a blue whale on this planet.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.480
 I don't know.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.720
 Maybe when you change the gravity and other things.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.120
 Well, you could think of life

02:49.120 --> 02:52.520
 as a thing of self assembling organisms

02:52.520 --> 02:54.000
 and they just get bigger and bigger and bigger.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.920
 Like there's no such thing as a human being.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.920
 A human being is made up of a bunch of tiny organisms

02:58.920 --> 03:00.080
 working together.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.040
 And we somehow envision that as one entity

03:03.040 --> 03:04.560
 because it has consciousness.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.060
 But maybe it's just organisms on top of organisms.

03:08.060 --> 03:10.600
 Organisms all the way down, turtles all the way down.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.320
 So like earth can be seen as an organism

03:13.320 --> 03:17.400
 for people, for alien species that's very different.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.500
 Like why is the human the fundamental entity

03:21.500 --> 03:24.980
 that is living and then everything else

03:24.980 --> 03:26.720
 is just either a collection of humans

03:26.720 --> 03:28.560
 or components of humans?

03:28.560 --> 03:30.360
 I think if it kind of is, if you think about,

03:30.360 --> 03:32.600
 I think of like an emergence elevator.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.760
 And so you've got an ant is on one floor

03:36.760 --> 03:39.560
 and then the ant colony is a floor above.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.280
 Or maybe there's even units within the colony

03:41.280 --> 03:42.880
 that's one floor above and the full colony

03:42.880 --> 03:44.640
 is two floors above.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.940
 And to me, I think that it's the colony

03:46.940 --> 03:49.400
 that is closest to being the animal.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.880
 It's like the individual thing that competes with others

03:53.880 --> 03:57.640
 while the individual ants are like cells

03:57.640 --> 03:59.040
 in the animal's body.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.320
 We are more like a colony in that regard.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.660
 But the humans are weird because we kind of,

04:04.660 --> 04:08.240
 I think of it, if emergence happens in an emergence tower,

04:08.240 --> 04:09.560
 where you've got kind of, as I said,

04:09.560 --> 04:13.320
 cells and then humans and communities and societies.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.040
 Ants are very specific.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.920
 The individual ants are always cooperating

04:16.920 --> 04:19.240
 with each other for the sake of the colony.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.680
 So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.200
 Humans can kind of go,

04:24.200 --> 04:25.840
 we take the elevator up and down

04:25.840 --> 04:27.240
 emergence tower psychologically.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.000
 Sometimes we are individuals

04:29.000 --> 04:31.840
 that are competing with other individuals

04:31.840 --> 04:33.140
 and that's where our mindset is.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.640
 And then other times we get in this crazy zone,

04:35.640 --> 04:37.460
 you know, a protest or a sporting event

04:37.460 --> 04:40.120
 and you're just chanting and screaming

04:40.120 --> 04:41.240
 and doing the same hand motions

04:41.240 --> 04:43.800
 with all these other people and you feel like one.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.720
 You feel like one, you know, and you'd sacrifice yourself.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.920
 And now that's what, you know, soldiers.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.480
 And so our brains can kind of psychologically

04:50.480 --> 04:53.600
 go up and down this elevator in an interesting way.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.320
 Yeah, I wonder how much of that

04:55.320 --> 04:57.080
 is just the narrative we tell ourselves.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.040
 Maybe we are just like an ant colony.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.560
 We're just collaborating always,

05:00.560 --> 05:04.160
 even in our stories of individualism,

05:04.160 --> 05:05.800
 of like the freedom of the individual,

05:05.800 --> 05:09.080
 like this kind of isolation,

05:09.080 --> 05:11.360
 lone man on an island kind of thing.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.820
 We're actually all part of this giant network

05:13.820 --> 05:17.560
 of maybe one of the things that makes humans who we are

05:17.560 --> 05:21.120
 is probably deeply social,

05:21.120 --> 05:22.560
 the ability to maintain

05:22.560 --> 05:24.480
 not just the single human intelligence,

05:24.480 --> 05:26.560
 but like a collective intelligence.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.440
 And so this feeling like individual

05:29.440 --> 05:33.080
 is just because we woke up at this level of the hierarchy.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.600
 So we make it special,

05:34.600 --> 05:39.600
 but we very well could be just part of the ant colony.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.840
 This whole conversation,

05:40.840 --> 05:44.000
 I'm either going to be doing a Shakespearean analysis

05:44.000 --> 05:46.480
 of your Twitter, your writing,

05:46.480 --> 05:49.560
 or very specific statements that you've made.

05:49.560 --> 05:54.560
 So you've written answers to a mailbag of questions.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.080
 The questions were amazing, the ones you've chosen,

05:57.080 --> 05:58.640
 and your answers were amazing.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.200
 So on this topic of the big and the small,

06:00.200 --> 06:03.480
 somebody asked, are we bigger than we are small?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.000
 Or smaller than we are big?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.400
 Who's asking these questions?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.000
 This is really good.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.160
 You have amazing fans.

06:09.160 --> 06:14.160
 Okay, so where do we sit at this level

06:15.800 --> 06:18.480
 of the very small to the very big?

06:18.480 --> 06:20.040
 So are we bigger or are we small?

06:20.040 --> 06:21.560
 Are we bigger than we are small?

06:21.560 --> 06:23.840
 I think it depends on what we're asking here.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.800
 So if we're talking about the biggest thing

06:26.800 --> 06:31.800
 that we kind of can talk about without just imagining

06:31.840 --> 06:34.320
 is the observable universe, the Hubble sphere.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.320
 And that's about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.480
 The smallest thing we talk about is a plank length,

06:44.480 --> 06:47.240
 but you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.480
 But that's 10 to the negative 35.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.560
 Now we're about, conveniently, about 10 to the one.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.880
 Not quite, 10 to the zero.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.960
 We're about 10 to the zero meters long.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.120
 So it's easy because you can just look and say,

06:59.120 --> 07:03.600
 okay, well, for example, atoms are like 10

07:03.600 --> 07:07.080
 to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters

07:07.080 --> 07:08.600
 across, right?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.640
 If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th,

07:10.640 --> 07:12.040
 which is right, that's now.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.920
 So an atom to us is us to this.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.720
 You get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy

07:16.720 --> 07:18.560
 and bigger than the biggest star.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.800
 So we're right in between nebula and an atom.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.160
 Now, if you wanna go down to quark level,

07:24.160 --> 07:26.320
 you might be able to get up to galaxy level.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.320
 When you go up to the observable universe,

07:29.320 --> 07:31.520
 you're getting down on the small side

07:31.520 --> 07:35.640
 to things that we, I think, are mostly theoretically

07:35.640 --> 07:39.800
 imagining are there and hypothesizing are there.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.400
 So I think as far as real world objects

07:43.400 --> 07:45.320
 that we really know a lot about,

07:45.320 --> 07:48.840
 I would say we are smaller than we are big.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.360
 But if you wanna go down to the Planck length,

07:50.360 --> 07:52.600
 we're very quickly, we're bigger than we are small.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.120
 If you think about strings.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.640
 Yeah, strings, exactly, string theory and so on.

07:57.640 --> 07:58.640
 That's interesting.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.200
 But I think like you answered,

08:00.200 --> 08:02.040
 no matter what, we're kind of middleish.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.360
 Yeah, I mean, here's something cool.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.840
 If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino,

08:06.840 --> 08:08.560
 the size doesn't really make sense.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.640
 It's not really a size.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.640
 But when we talk about some of these neutrinos,

08:11.640 --> 08:15.480
 I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.680
 So that's like, I mean, a proton is real small,

08:18.680 --> 08:19.720
 like really small.

08:20.680 --> 08:25.680
 And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.400
 Let's talk about aliens.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.640
 We already mentioned it.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.200
 Let's start just by with the basic,

08:34.200 --> 08:36.040
 what's your intuition as of today?

08:36.040 --> 08:38.400
 This is a thing that could change day by day.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.920
 But how many alien civilizations out there?

08:40.920 --> 08:42.360
 Is it zero?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.200
 Is it a handful?

08:45.200 --> 08:50.200
 Is it almost endless, like the observable universe

08:50.280 --> 08:52.240
 or the universe is teeming with life?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.800
 If I had gun to my head, I have to take a guess.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.360
 I would say it's teeming with life.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.720
 I would say there is.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.720
 I think running a Monte Carlo simulation,

09:00.720 --> 09:03.960
 this paper by Andrew Sandberg and Drexler

09:03.960 --> 09:05.720
 and a few others a couple of years ago,

09:05.720 --> 09:07.280
 I think you probably know about it.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.080
 I think the mean,

09:12.280 --> 09:13.280
 using different,

09:16.040 --> 09:20.240
 running through randomized rake equation multiplication,

09:20.240 --> 09:23.560
 you're ended up with 27 million as the mean

09:23.560 --> 09:26.480
 of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy,

09:26.480 --> 09:27.840
 in the Milky Way alone.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.640
 And so then if you go outside the Milky Way,

09:30.640 --> 09:32.280
 that would turn into trillions.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.280
 That's the mean.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.000
 Now, what's interesting is that there's a long tail

09:37.000 --> 09:40.040
 because they believe some of these multipliers

09:40.040 --> 09:40.880
 in the Drake equation.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.600
 So for example, the probability that life starts

09:45.600 --> 09:46.960
 in the first place,

09:46.960 --> 09:51.960
 they think that the kind of range that we use

09:51.960 --> 09:54.480
 is for that variable or is way too small.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.640
 And that's constraining our possibilities.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.960
 And if you actually extend it to some crazy number

10:00.960 --> 10:03.080
 of orders of magnitude, like 200,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.400
 they think that that variable should be,

10:06.800 --> 10:08.640
 you get this long tail where,

10:08.640 --> 10:09.480
 I forget the exact number,

10:09.480 --> 10:11.400
 but it's like a third or a quarter

10:11.400 --> 10:14.960
 of the total outcomes have us alone.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.920
 I think it's a sizable percentage has us

10:18.920 --> 10:22.200
 as the only intelligent life in the galaxy,

10:22.200 --> 10:23.040
 but you can keep going.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.680
 And I think there's like a non zero,

10:25.680 --> 10:28.160
 like legitimate amount of outcomes there

10:28.160 --> 10:30.120
 that have us as the only life

10:30.120 --> 10:32.640
 in the observable universe at all is on earth.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.400
 I mean, it seems incredibly counterintuitive.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.960
 It seems like, you mentioned that people think

10:37.960 --> 10:41.440
 you must be an idiot because if you picked up one grain

10:41.440 --> 10:42.960
 of sand on a beach and examined it

10:42.960 --> 10:44.280
 and you found all these little things on it,

10:44.280 --> 10:46.600
 it's like saying, well, maybe this is the only one

10:46.600 --> 10:47.440
 that has that.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.760
 And it's like, probably not.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.840
 They're probably most of the sand probably

10:50.840 --> 10:52.320
 or a lot of the sand, right?

10:52.320 --> 10:54.520
 So, and then the other hand, we don't see anything.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.680
 We don't see any evidence, which of course,

10:56.680 --> 10:59.280
 people would say that the people who stuff scoff

10:59.280 --> 11:01.600
 at the concept that we're potentially alone,

11:03.200 --> 11:05.400
 they say, well, of course, there's lots of reasons

11:05.400 --> 11:06.600
 we wouldn't have seen anything.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.960
 And they can go list them and they're very compelling,

11:09.960 --> 11:11.800
 but we don't know.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.960
 And the truth is if there were,

11:12.960 --> 11:14.640
 if this were a freak thing, I mean, we don't,

11:14.640 --> 11:17.720
 if this were a completely freak thing that happened here,

11:17.720 --> 11:19.600
 whether it's life at all or just getting

11:19.600 --> 11:21.040
 to this level of intelligence,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.680
 that species, whoever it was, would think

11:25.680 --> 11:28.320
 there must be lots of us out there and they'd be wrong.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.760
 So just being, again, using the same intuition

11:30.760 --> 11:32.760
 that most people would use, I'd say there's probably lots

11:32.760 --> 11:34.400
 of other things out there.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.640
 Yeah, and you wrote a great blog post about it.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.480
 But to me, the two interesting reasons

11:40.480 --> 11:44.920
 that we haven't been in contact, I too have an intuition

11:44.920 --> 11:47.600
 that the universe is teeming with life.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.720
 So one interesting is around the great filter.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.120
 So we either, the great filter's either behind us

11:54.120 --> 11:55.240
 or in front of us.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.200
 So the reason that's interesting is you get to think

11:58.200 --> 12:01.520
 about what kind of things ensure

12:01.520 --> 12:05.920
 or ensure the survival of an intelligent civilization

12:05.920 --> 12:08.480
 or lead to the destruction of intelligent civilization.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.560
 That's a very pragmatic, very important question

12:10.560 --> 12:11.880
 to always be asking.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.400
 And we'll talk about some of those.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.400
 And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility

12:18.480 --> 12:20.320
 that there could be aliens communicating

12:20.320 --> 12:21.660
 with us all the time.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.700
 In fact, they may have visited.

12:25.160 --> 12:29.620
 And we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it.

12:29.620 --> 12:34.540
 Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve

12:34.540 --> 12:38.120
 is just the range of life that can evolve is so large

12:38.120 --> 12:41.480
 that our narrow view of what is life

12:41.480 --> 12:43.680
 and what is intelligent life is preventing us

12:43.680 --> 12:45.800
 from having communication with them.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.720
 But then they don't seem very smart

12:47.720 --> 12:50.400
 because if they were trying to communicate with us,

12:50.400 --> 12:53.400
 they would surely, if they were super intelligent,

12:53.400 --> 12:56.440
 they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots of life,

12:56.440 --> 12:59.360
 we're not that rare, we're not some crazy weird species

12:59.360 --> 13:01.920
 that hears and has different kinds of ways

13:01.920 --> 13:04.640
 of perceiving signals.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.960
 So they would probably be able to,

13:06.960 --> 13:08.160
 if you really wanted to communicate

13:08.160 --> 13:11.220
 with an earth like species, with a human like species,

13:12.080 --> 13:14.120
 you would send out all kinds of things.

13:14.120 --> 13:18.820
 You'd send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves

13:18.820 --> 13:20.720
 and lots of things.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.160
 So if they're communicating in a way,

13:22.160 --> 13:23.880
 they're trying to communicate with us

13:23.880 --> 13:25.980
 and it's just we're too dumb to perceive the signals,

13:25.980 --> 13:28.380
 it's like, well, they're not doing a great job

13:28.380 --> 13:32.800
 of considering the primitive species we might be.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.840
 So I don't know, I think if a super intelligent species

13:35.840 --> 13:40.840
 wanted to get in touch with us and had the capability of,

13:40.880 --> 13:43.560
 I think probably they would.

13:43.560 --> 13:48.560
 Well, they may be getting in touch with us,

13:48.640 --> 13:50.100
 they're just getting in touch with the thing

13:50.100 --> 13:52.240
 that we humans are not understanding

13:52.240 --> 13:53.780
 that they're getting in touch with us with.

13:53.780 --> 13:55.960
 I guess that's what I was trying to say is

13:55.960 --> 13:57.560
 there could be something about earth

13:57.560 --> 14:00.240
 that's much more special than us humans.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.680
 Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth

14:02.680 --> 14:07.600
 or the thing that's of value and that's curious

14:07.600 --> 14:10.640
 and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful

14:10.640 --> 14:15.280
 might be something that's not just like tweets, okay?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.200
 Like English language that's interpretable

14:17.200 --> 14:19.720
 or any kind of language or any kind of signal,

14:19.720 --> 14:22.360
 whether it's gravity or radio signal

14:22.360 --> 14:24.920
 that humans seem to appreciate.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.520
 Why not the actual, it could be the process

14:28.520 --> 14:29.560
 of evolution itself.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.120
 There could be something about the way

14:31.120 --> 14:33.280
 that earth is breathing essentially

14:33.280 --> 14:34.660
 through the creation of life

14:34.660 --> 14:37.320
 and this complex growth of life.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.400
 There's like, it's a whole different way

14:40.400 --> 14:42.920
 to view organisms and view life

14:42.920 --> 14:44.920
 that could be getting communicated with.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.140
 And we humans are just a tiny fingertip

14:47.140 --> 14:49.000
 on top of that intelligence.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.560
 And the communication is happening

14:50.560 --> 14:54.360
 with the main mothership of earth

14:54.360 --> 14:56.880
 versus us humans that seem to treat ourselves

14:56.880 --> 15:00.480
 as super important and we're missing the big picture.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.760
 I mean, it sounds crazy, but our understanding

15:03.760 --> 15:05.760
 of what is intelligent, of what is life,

15:05.760 --> 15:08.040
 what is consciousness is very limited.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.840
 And it seems to be, and just being very suspicious,

15:11.840 --> 15:14.380
 it seems to be awfully human centric.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.860
 Like this story, it seems like the progress of science

15:17.860 --> 15:22.860
 is constantly putting humans down on the importance,

15:22.860 --> 15:27.860
 humans down on the cosmic importance,

15:28.240 --> 15:32.120
 the ranking of how big we are, how important we are.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.960
 That seems to be the more we discover

15:33.960 --> 15:34.900
 that's what's happening.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.320
 And I think science is very young.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.840
 And so I think eventually we might figure out

15:39.840 --> 15:41.920
 that there's something much, much bigger going on,

15:41.920 --> 15:45.080
 that humans are just a curious little side effect

15:45.080 --> 15:46.440
 of the much bigger thing.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.320
 That's what, I mean, that, as I'm saying,

15:49.320 --> 15:50.680
 it just sounds insane, but.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.240
 Well, it just, it sounds a little like religious.

15:54.240 --> 15:59.080
 It sounds like a spiritual, it gets to that realm

15:59.080 --> 16:02.000
 where there's something that more than meets the eye.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
 Well, yeah, but not, so religious and spiritual,

16:07.560 --> 16:11.120
 often have this kind of whoo whoo characteristic,

16:11.120 --> 16:12.940
 like when people write books about them,

16:12.940 --> 16:14.620
 then go to wars over whatever the heck

16:14.620 --> 16:16.200
 is written in those books.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.860
 I mean, more like it's possible that collective intelligence

16:19.860 --> 16:22.360
 is more important than individual intelligence, right?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.480
 It's the ant colony.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.840
 What's the primal organism?

16:24.840 --> 16:26.920
 Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?

16:26.920 --> 16:29.640
 Yeah, I mean, humans, just like any individual ant

16:29.640 --> 16:32.120
 can't do shit, but the colony can do,

16:32.120 --> 16:35.440
 make this incredible structures and has this intelligence.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.840
 And we're exactly the same.

16:36.840 --> 16:40.240
 I mean, you know the famous thing that no one,

16:40.240 --> 16:42.480
 no human knows how to make a pencil.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.680
 Have you heard this?

16:44.680 --> 16:45.520
 No. Basically, I mean.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.380
 This is great.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.640
 There's not, a single human out there

16:49.640 --> 16:51.640
 has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.040
 So you have to think about, you have to get the wood,

16:54.040 --> 16:56.160
 the paint, the different chemicals

16:56.160 --> 16:57.640
 that make up the yellow paint.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.480
 The eraser is a whole other thing.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.440
 The metal has to be mined from somewhere

17:01.440 --> 17:04.640
 and then the graphite, whatever that is.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.120
 And there's not one person on earth

17:06.120 --> 17:10.040
 who knows how to kind of collect all those materials

17:10.040 --> 17:12.600
 and create a pencil, but together,

17:12.600 --> 17:14.120
 that's one of the, that's child's play.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.280
 It's just one of the easiest things.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.520
 So, you know, the other thing I like to think about,

17:18.520 --> 17:21.080
 I actually put this as a question on the blog once.

17:22.360 --> 17:23.800
 There's a thought experiment

17:24.800 --> 17:26.000
 and I actually wanna hear what you think.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.800
 So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around

17:30.800 --> 17:35.040
 and she says, I'm gonna cast a spell on all of humanity

17:35.040 --> 17:39.360
 and all material things that you've invented

17:39.360 --> 17:41.380
 are gonna disappear all at once.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.960
 So suddenly we're all standing there naked.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.500
 There's no buildings.

17:44.500 --> 17:48.720
 There's no cars and boats and ships and no mines,

17:48.720 --> 17:49.880
 nothing, right?

17:49.880 --> 17:52.960
 It's just the stone age earth and a bunch of naked humans,

17:52.960 --> 17:54.440
 but we're all the same, we have the same brain.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.920
 So we're all know what's going on.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.960
 And we all got a note from her, so we understand the deal.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.560
 And she says, she communicated to every human,

18:00.560 --> 18:02.920
 here's the deal, you lost all your stuff.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.320
 You guys need to make one working iPhone 13

18:07.320 --> 18:09.520
 and you make one working iPhone 13

18:09.520 --> 18:11.680
 that could pass in the Apple store today,

18:11.680 --> 18:13.880
 you know, in your previous world

18:13.880 --> 18:16.440
 for an iPhone 13, then I will restore everything.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.360
 How long do you think?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.080
 And so everyone knows this is the mission.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.680
 We're all aware of the mission, everyone, all humans.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.800
 How long would it take us?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.240
 That's a really interesting question.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.000
 So obviously if you do a random selection

18:28.000 --> 18:31.280
 of 100 or a thousand humans within the population,

18:31.280 --> 18:34.720
 I think you're screwed to make that iPhone.

18:34.720 --> 18:39.540
 I tend to believe that there's fascinating specialization

18:39.540 --> 18:40.840
 among the human civilization.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.160
 Like there's a few hackers out there

18:43.160 --> 18:46.500
 that can like solo build an iPhone.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.520
 But with what materials?

18:48.520 --> 18:50.360
 So no materials whatsoever.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.920
 It has to, I mean, it's virtually, I mean, okay.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.560
 You have to build factories.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.120
 I mean, to fabricate.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.120
 Okay.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.360
 And how are you gonna mine them?

19:03.360 --> 19:04.420
 You know, you gotta mine the materials

19:04.420 --> 19:05.480
 where you don't have any cranes.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.740
 You don't have any, you know.

19:06.740 --> 19:10.820
 Okay, you 100% have to have the, everybody's naked.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.320
 Everyone's naked and everyone's where they are.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.000
 So you and I would currently be naked.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.280
 It's on the ground in what used to be Manhattan.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.120
 So no building.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.600
 No, grassy island.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.440
 Yeah.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.140
 So you need a naked Elon Musk type character

19:22.140 --> 19:23.840
 to then start building a company.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.600
 You have to have a large company then.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.440
 Right.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.480
 He doesn't even know where he, you know,

19:27.480 --> 19:28.320
 where is everyone?

19:28.320 --> 19:29.680
 You know, oh shit, how am I gonna find

19:29.680 --> 19:30.520
 other people I need to talk to?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.000
 But we have all the knowledge of.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
 Yeah, everyone has the knowledge

19:33.000 --> 19:34.040
 that's in their current brains.

19:34.040 --> 19:34.880
 Yeah.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.440
 I've met some legit engineers.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.800
 Crazy polymath people.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.840
 Yeah, but the actual labor of,

19:42.840 --> 19:47.160
 cause you said, cause like the original Mac,

19:47.160 --> 19:50.480
 like the Apple II, that can be built.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.480
 But.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.320
 Even that, you know.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.160
 Even that's gonna be tough.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.240
 Well, I think part of it is a communication problem.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.880
 If you could suddenly have, you know, someone,

19:56.880 --> 19:58.160
 if everyone had a walkie talkie

19:58.160 --> 19:59.600
 and there was, you know, a couple, you know,

19:59.600 --> 20:01.880
 10 really smart people were designated the leaders,

20:01.880 --> 20:02.960
 they could say, okay, I want, you know,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.940
 everyone who can do this to walk west, you know,

20:05.940 --> 20:08.200
 until you get to this little hub and everyone else,

20:08.200 --> 20:10.200
 you know, and they could actually coordinate,

20:10.200 --> 20:11.120
 but we don't have that.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.240
 So it's like people just, you know,

20:12.240 --> 20:14.080
 and then what I think about is,

20:14.080 --> 20:15.960
 so you've got some people that are like trying to organize

20:15.960 --> 20:17.120
 and you'll have a little community

20:17.120 --> 20:18.640
 where a couple hundred people have come together

20:18.640 --> 20:20.120
 and maybe a couple thousand have organized

20:20.120 --> 20:22.320
 and they designated one person, you know, as the leader

20:22.320 --> 20:24.360
 and then they have sub leaders and okay,

20:24.360 --> 20:25.200
 we have a start here.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.320
 We have some organization.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.880
 You're also gonna have some people that say, good,

20:28.880 --> 20:31.600
 humans were scourged upon the earth and this is good.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.560
 And they're gonna try to sabotage.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.880
 They're gonna try to murder the people with the,

20:33.880 --> 20:35.880
 and who know what they're talking about.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.720
 Yeah.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.880
 The elite that possessed the knowledge.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.720
 Well, and so everyone, maybe everyone's hopeful

20:42.720 --> 20:44.320
 for the, you know, we're all civilized and hopeful

20:44.320 --> 20:45.720
 for the first 30 days or something.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.120
 And then things start to fall off.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.760
 They, you know, people get, start to lose hope

20:48.760 --> 20:50.280
 and there's new kinds of, you know,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.200
 new kinds of governments popping up, you know,

20:52.200 --> 20:55.960
 new kinds of societies and they're, you know,

20:55.960 --> 20:57.680
 and they don't play nicely with the other ones.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.180
 And I think very quickly,

20:59.180 --> 21:00.460
 I think a lot of people would just give up and say,

21:00.460 --> 21:01.300
 you know what, this is it.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.120
 We're back in the stone age.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.800
 Let's just create, you know, agrarian.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.040
 We don't also don't know how to farm.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.080
 No one knows how to farm.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.480
 There's like, even the farmers, you know,

21:08.480 --> 21:11.040
 a lot of them are relying on their machines.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.680
 And so we also, you know, mass starvation.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.420
 And that, you know, when you're trying to organize,

21:16.420 --> 21:18.740
 a lot of people are, you know, coming in with, you know,

21:18.740 --> 21:21.840
 spears they've fashioned and trying to murder everyone

21:21.840 --> 21:22.680
 who has food.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.520
 That's an interesting question.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.640
 Given today's society, how much violence would that be?

21:25.640 --> 21:28.000
 We've gotten softer, less violent.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.040
 And we don't have weapons.

21:29.040 --> 21:29.880
 So that's something. We don't have weapons.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.720
 We have really primitive weapons now.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.980
 But we have, and also we have a kind of ethics

21:33.980 --> 21:35.640
 where murder is bad.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.920
 We used to be less, like human life was less valued

21:38.920 --> 21:39.760
 in the past.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.920
 So murder was more okay, like ethically.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.320
 But in the past, they also were really good

21:44.320 --> 21:46.300
 at figuring out how to have sustenance.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.640
 They knew how to get food and water because they,

21:48.640 --> 21:49.800
 so we have no idea.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.980
 Like the ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh

21:51.980 --> 21:52.840
 at what's going on here.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.280
 They'd say, you guys, you don't know what you're,

21:54.280 --> 21:55.400
 none of you know what you're doing.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.240
 Yeah.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.360
 And also the amount of people feeding this amount of people

21:59.360 --> 22:02.200
 in a very, in a stone age, you know, civilization,

22:02.200 --> 22:03.800
 that's not gonna happen.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.960
 So New York and San Francisco are screwed.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.840
 Well, whoever's not near water is really screwed.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.120
 So that's, you're near a river or freshwater river.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.400
 And you know, anyway, it's a very interesting question.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.440
 And what it does, this and the pencil,

22:14.440 --> 22:19.220
 it makes me feel so grateful and like excited about like,

22:19.220 --> 22:21.560
 man, our civilization is so cool.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.440
 And this is, talk about collective intelligence.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.040
 Humans did not build any of this.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.440
 It's collective human super,

22:30.440 --> 22:32.760
 collective humans is a super intelligent,

22:32.760 --> 22:37.200
 you know, being that is, that can do absolutely,

22:37.200 --> 22:38.560
 especially over a long period of time,

22:38.560 --> 22:39.640
 can do such magical things.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.800
 And we just get to be born, when I go out,

22:41.800 --> 22:42.940
 when I'm working and I'm hungry,

22:42.940 --> 22:46.320
 I just go click, click, click, and like a salad's coming.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.160
 The salad arrives.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.040
 If you think about the incredible infrastructure

22:50.040 --> 22:52.040
 that's in place for that, for that quickly,

22:52.040 --> 22:54.380
 or just the internet to, you know, the electricity,

22:54.380 --> 22:55.960
 first of all, that's just powering the things, you know,

22:55.960 --> 22:57.960
 how the, where the, the amount of structures

22:57.960 --> 23:00.640
 that have to be created and for that electricity to be there.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.560
 And then you've got the, you've of course the internet,

23:02.560 --> 23:05.560
 and then you have this system where delivery drivers

23:05.560 --> 23:06.600
 and they have, they're riding bikes

23:06.600 --> 23:07.640
 that were made by someone else.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.120
 And they're going to get the salad

23:09.120 --> 23:11.480
 and all those ingredients came from all over the place.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.600
 I mean, it's just, so I think it's like,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.360
 I like thinking about these things

23:15.360 --> 23:19.220
 because it makes me feel like just so grateful.

23:19.220 --> 23:21.300
 I'm like, man, it would be so awful if we didn't have this.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.720
 And people who didn't have it would think

23:22.720 --> 23:25.180
 this was such magic we live in and we do.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.520
 And like, cool, that's fun.

23:27.520 --> 23:29.640
 Yeah, one of the most amazing things when I showed up,

23:29.640 --> 23:32.160
 I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union

23:32.160 --> 23:36.560
 and the supermarket was, people don't really realize that,

23:36.560 --> 23:39.960
 but the abundance of food, it's not even,

23:41.240 --> 23:43.440
 so bananas was the thing I was obsessed about.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.760
 I just ate bananas every day for many, many months

23:45.760 --> 23:47.720
 because they haven't had bananas in Russia.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.800
 And the fact that you can have as many bananas as you want,

23:49.800 --> 23:53.320
 plus they were like somewhat inexpensive

23:53.320 --> 23:54.720
 relative to the other food.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.080
 The fact that you can somehow have a system

23:58.080 --> 24:00.200
 that brings bananas to you without having to wait

24:00.200 --> 24:02.040
 in a long line, all of those things,

24:02.040 --> 24:03.240
 it's magic.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.000
 I mean, also imagine, so first of all,

24:06.000 --> 24:07.640
 the ancient hunter gatherers,

24:07.640 --> 24:08.960
 you picture the mother gathering and eating

24:08.960 --> 24:10.360
 for all this fresh food, no.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.960
 So do you know what an avocado used to look like?

24:11.960 --> 24:15.920
 It was a little like a sphere and the fruit of it,

24:15.920 --> 24:18.280
 the actual avocado part was like a little tiny layer

24:18.280 --> 24:21.440
 around this big pit that took up almost the whole volume.

24:21.440 --> 24:25.840
 We've made crazy robot avocados today

24:25.840 --> 24:28.280
 that have nothing to do with like what they,

24:28.280 --> 24:33.280
 so same with bananas, these big, sweet, you know,

24:33.280 --> 24:35.760
 and not infested with bugs and, you know,

24:35.760 --> 24:37.760
 they used to eat the shittiest food

24:38.640 --> 24:40.840
 and they're eating uncooked meat

24:40.840 --> 24:42.840
 or maybe they cook it and they're just, it's gross

24:42.840 --> 24:44.680
 and it's things rot.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.240
 So you go to the supermarket and it's just,

24:47.240 --> 24:49.960
 A, it's like crazy super engineered cartoon food,

24:49.960 --> 24:51.360
 fruit and food.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.480
 And then it's all this processed food,

24:52.480 --> 24:54.120
 which, you know, we complain about in our setting.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.240
 Oh, you know, we complain about, you know,

24:55.240 --> 24:56.720
 we need too much process.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.280
 That's a, this is a good problem.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.360
 I mean, if you imagine what they would think,

25:00.360 --> 25:01.400
 oh my God, a cracker.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.280
 You know how delicious a cracker would taste to them?

25:04.280 --> 25:08.120
 You know, candy, you know, pasta and spaghetti.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.360
 They never had anything like this.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.440
 And then you have from all over the world,

25:11.440 --> 25:13.960
 I mean, things that are grown all over the place,

25:13.960 --> 25:16.040
 all here in nice little racks organized

25:16.040 --> 25:17.920
 and on a middle class salary,

25:17.920 --> 25:20.040
 you can afford anything you want.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.200
 I mean, it's again, just like incredible gratitude.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.120
 Like, ah, yeah.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.440
 And the question is how resilient is this whole thing?

25:27.440 --> 25:31.840
 I mean, this is another darker version of your question is

25:31.840 --> 25:35.240
 if we keep all the material possessions we have,

25:35.240 --> 25:39.520
 but we start knocking out some percent of the population,

25:39.520 --> 25:42.080
 how resilient is the system that we built up

25:42.080 --> 25:43.920
 where we rely on other humans

25:43.920 --> 25:45.880
 and the knowledge that built up on the past,

25:45.880 --> 25:48.880
 the distributed nature of knowledge,

25:50.120 --> 25:52.960
 how much does it take?

25:52.960 --> 25:55.480
 How many humans need to disappear

25:55.480 --> 25:57.840
 for us to be completely lost?

25:57.840 --> 25:59.160
 Well, I'm trying to go off one thing,

25:59.160 --> 26:02.480
 which is Elon Musk says that he has this number,

26:02.480 --> 26:05.920
 a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people

26:05.920 --> 26:10.920
 you need to be on Mars to truly be multi planetary.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.600
 Multi planetary doesn't mean, you know,

26:15.000 --> 26:19.480
 like when Neil Armstrong, you know, goes to the moon,

26:19.480 --> 26:21.920
 they call it a great leap for mankind.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.760
 It's not a great leap for anything.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.760
 It is a great achievement for mankind.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.440
 And I always like think about if the first fish

26:29.440 --> 26:31.960
 to kind of go on land just kind of went up

26:31.960 --> 26:33.320
 and gave the shore a high five

26:33.320 --> 26:34.240
 and goes back into the water,

26:34.240 --> 26:36.040
 that's not a great leap for life.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.240
 That's a great achievement for that fish.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.520
 And there should be a little statue of that fish

26:38.520 --> 26:39.680
 and it's, you know, in the water

26:39.680 --> 26:41.400
 and everyone should celebrate the fish.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.880
 But it's, but when we talk about a great leap for life,

26:44.880 --> 26:45.720
 it's permanent.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.680
 It's something that now from now on, this is how things are.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.080
 So this is part of why I get so excited about Mars,

26:51.080 --> 26:53.800
 by the way, is because you can count on one hand,

26:53.800 --> 26:57.120
 like the number of great leaps that we've had,

26:57.120 --> 27:00.840
 you know, like no life to life and single cell

27:00.840 --> 27:02.680
 or simple cell to complex cell

27:02.680 --> 27:06.000
 and single cell organisms to animals to come,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.200
 you know, multi cell animals and then ocean to land

27:09.200 --> 27:12.640
 and then one planet to two planets, anyway, diversion.

27:12.640 --> 27:17.120
 But the point is that we are officially that leap

27:17.120 --> 27:19.880
 for all of life, you know, has happened

27:19.880 --> 27:22.680
 once the ships could stop coming from Earth

27:22.680 --> 27:24.760
 because there's some horrible catastrophic World War III

27:24.760 --> 27:26.240
 and everyone dies on Earth and they're fine

27:26.240 --> 27:29.160
 and they can turn that certain X number of people

27:29.160 --> 27:31.680
 into 7 billion, you know, population

27:31.680 --> 27:33.000
 that's thriving just like Earth.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.400
 They can build ships, they can come back

27:34.400 --> 27:35.240
 and recolonize Earth

27:35.240 --> 27:37.160
 because now we are officially multi planetary

27:37.160 --> 27:38.800
 where it's a self sustaining.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.800
 He says a million people is about what he thinks.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.520
 Now that might be a specialized group.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.560
 That's a very specifically, you know,

27:44.560 --> 27:49.240
 selected million that has very, very skilled million people,

27:49.240 --> 27:51.560
 not just maybe the average million on Earth,

27:51.560 --> 27:53.160
 but I think it depends what you're talking about.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.120
 But I don't think, you know, so one million is one 7,000th,

27:56.120 --> 27:58.440
 one 8,000th of the current population.

27:58.440 --> 28:02.160
 I think you need a very, very, very small fraction

28:02.160 --> 28:04.480
 of humans on Earth to get by.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.320
 Obviously you're not gonna have

28:05.320 --> 28:06.920
 the same thriving civilization

28:06.920 --> 28:08.440
 if you get to a too small a number,

28:08.440 --> 28:10.640
 but it depends who you're killing off, I guess,

28:10.640 --> 28:11.920
 is part of the question.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.280
 Yeah, if you killed off half of the people

28:14.280 --> 28:15.680
 just randomly right now, I think we'd be fine.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.720
 It would be obviously a great awful tragedy.

28:18.720 --> 28:19.920
 I think if you killed off three quarters

28:19.920 --> 28:20.760
 of all people randomly,

28:20.760 --> 28:22.440
 just three out of every four people drops dead.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.800
 I think we'd have, obviously the stock market would crash.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.040
 We'd have a rough patch,

28:27.040 --> 28:30.520
 but I almost can assure you that the species would be fine.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.760
 Well, cause the million number,

28:31.760 --> 28:33.780
 like you said, it is specialized.

28:33.780 --> 28:38.780
 So I think, cause you have to do this,

28:39.080 --> 28:41.680
 you have to basically do the iPhone experiment.

28:41.680 --> 28:46.160
 Like literally you have to be able to manufacture computers.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.000
 Yeah, everything.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.480
 If you're gonna have the self sustaining means

28:48.480 --> 28:50.840
 you can, any major important skill,

28:50.840 --> 28:53.600
 any important piece of kind of infrastructure on earth

28:53.600 --> 28:56.580
 can be built there just as well.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.200
 It'd be interesting to list out

29:00.200 --> 29:01.940
 what are the important things,

29:01.940 --> 29:03.400
 what are the important skills?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.980
 Yeah, I mean, if you have to feed everyone,

29:05.980 --> 29:08.880
 so mass farming, things like that,

29:08.880 --> 29:12.040
 you have to, you have to, you have mining,

29:12.040 --> 29:15.300
 these questions, it's like the materials might be,

29:15.300 --> 29:17.660
 I don't know, five mile, two miles underground,

29:17.660 --> 29:20.400
 I don't know what the actual, but like,

29:20.400 --> 29:22.080
 it's amazing to me just that these things

29:22.080 --> 29:23.080
 got built in the first place.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.320
 And they never got, no one built the first,

29:25.320 --> 29:28.200
 the mine that we're getting stuff for the iPhone for

29:28.200 --> 29:30.720
 probably wasn't built for the iPhone.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.280
 Or in general, early mining was for,

29:33.280 --> 29:35.520
 I think obviously I assume the industrial revolution

29:35.520 --> 29:37.040
 when we realized, oh, fossil fuels,

29:37.040 --> 29:40.080
 we wanna extract this magical energy source.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.240
 I assume that like mining took a huge leap

29:42.240 --> 29:43.400
 without knowing very much about this.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.760
 I think you're gonna need mining,

29:45.760 --> 29:48.480
 you're gonna need like a lot of electrical engineers.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.080
 If you're gonna have a civilization like ours,

29:50.080 --> 29:51.960
 and of course you could have oil and lanterns,

29:51.960 --> 29:53.200
 we could go way back,

29:53.200 --> 29:55.280
 but if you're trying to build our today thing,

29:55.280 --> 29:58.360
 you're gonna need energy and electricity

29:58.360 --> 30:00.620
 and then mines that can bring materials,

30:00.620 --> 30:03.360
 and then you're gonna need a ton of plumbing

30:03.360 --> 30:05.360
 and everything that entails.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.680
 And like you said, food, but also the manufacturer,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.800
 so like turning raw materials into something useful,

30:10.800 --> 30:13.040
 that whole thing, like factories,

30:13.040 --> 30:15.560
 some supply chain, transportation.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.480
 Right, I mean, you think about,

30:17.480 --> 30:18.460
 when we talk about like world hunger,

30:18.460 --> 30:20.960
 one of the major problems is,

30:20.960 --> 30:22.760
 there's plenty of food and by the time it arrives,

30:22.760 --> 30:24.720
 most of it's gone bad in the truck,

30:24.720 --> 30:26.940
 in a kind of an impoverished place.

30:26.940 --> 30:29.680
 So it's like, again, we take it so for granted,

30:29.680 --> 30:33.440
 all the food in the supermarket is fresh, it's all there.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
 And which always stresses me,

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
 if I were running a supermarket,

30:36.440 --> 30:37.920
 I would always be so like miserable

30:37.920 --> 30:41.620
 about like things going bad on the shelves,

30:41.620 --> 30:43.080
 or if you don't have enough, that's not good,

30:43.080 --> 30:44.360
 but if you have too much, it goes bad anyway.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.880
 Of course, there'll be entertainers too.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.960
 Like somebody would have a YouTube channel

30:48.960 --> 30:50.840
 that's running on Mars.

30:50.840 --> 30:55.400
 There is something different about a civilization on Mars

30:55.400 --> 30:59.240
 and Earth existing versus like a civilization

30:59.240 --> 31:01.400
 in the United States versus Russia and China.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.240
 Like that's a different,

31:03.240 --> 31:07.360
 fundamentally different distance, like philosophically.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.200
 Will it be like fuzzy?

31:08.200 --> 31:09.940
 We know there'll be like a reality show on Mars

31:09.940 --> 31:11.400
 that everyone on Earth is obsessed with.

31:11.400 --> 31:15.160
 And I think if people are going back and forth enough,

31:15.160 --> 31:16.080
 then it becomes fuzzy.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.600
 It becomes like, oh, our friends on Mars.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.600
 And there's like this Mars versus Earth,

31:19.600 --> 31:22.640
 and it become like fun tribalism.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.240
 I think if people don't rarely go back and forth

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
 and it really, they're there for,

31:26.240 --> 31:28.280
 I think if you get kind of like, oh, we hate,

31:28.280 --> 31:30.360
 a lot of like us versus them stuff going on.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.880
 There could be also war in space for territory.

31:33.880 --> 31:38.480
 As a first colony happens, China, Russia,

31:38.480 --> 31:41.680
 or whoever the European, different European nations,

31:41.680 --> 31:43.560
 Switzerland finally gets their act together

31:43.560 --> 31:46.840
 and starts wars as opposed to staying out of all of them.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.040
 Yeah, there's all kinds of crazy geopolitical things

31:49.040 --> 31:51.000
 that like we have not even,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.720
 no one's really even thought about too much yet

31:52.720 --> 31:54.440
 that like, it could get weird.

31:54.440 --> 31:57.520
 Think about the 1500s when it was suddenly like a race

31:57.520 --> 32:00.380
 to like colonize or capture land

32:00.380 --> 32:02.360
 or discover new land that hasn't been,

32:02.360 --> 32:04.360
 so it was like this new frontiers.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.840
 There's not really, the land is not,

32:06.840 --> 32:09.240
 the thing about Crimea was like this huge thing

32:09.240 --> 32:11.260
 because this tiny peninsula switched.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.980
 That's how like optimized everything has become.

32:13.980 --> 32:16.400
 Everything is just like really stuck.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.500
 Mars is a whole new world of like,

32:18.500 --> 32:21.100
 territory, naming things and you know,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.960
 and it's a chance for new kind of governments maybe,

32:24.960 --> 32:27.440
 or maybe it's just the colonies of these governments

32:27.440 --> 32:28.680
 so we don't get that opportunity.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.000
 I think it'd be cool if there's new countries

32:30.000 --> 32:32.160
 being totally new experiments.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.800
 And that's fascinating because Elon talks exactly

32:34.800 --> 32:36.560
 about that and I believe that very much.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.400
 Like that should be, like from the start,

32:40.400 --> 32:43.240
 they should determine their own sovereignty.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.320
 Like they should determine their own thing.

32:46.320 --> 32:50.880
 There was one modern democracy in late 1700s, the US.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.480
 I mean, it was the only modern democracy.

32:53.480 --> 32:57.600
 And now of course, there's hundreds or dozen, many dozens.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.720
 But I think part of the reason that was able to start,

32:59.720 --> 33:01.040
 I mean, it's not that people didn't have the idea,

33:01.040 --> 33:04.440
 people had the idea, it was that they had a clean slate,

33:04.440 --> 33:06.720
 new place, and they suddenly were,

33:06.720 --> 33:10.200
 so I think it would be a great opportunity to have,

33:10.200 --> 33:11.720
 there's a lot of people who have done that,

33:11.720 --> 33:13.920
 oh, if I had my own government on an island,

33:13.920 --> 33:15.560
 my own country, what would I do?

33:15.560 --> 33:20.120
 And the US founders actually had the opportunity,

33:20.120 --> 33:21.640
 that fantasy, they were like, we can do it.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.880
 Let's make, okay, what's the perfect country?

33:23.880 --> 33:25.360
 And they tried to make something.

33:25.360 --> 33:29.480
 Sometimes progress is, it's not held up by our imagination.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.360
 It's held up by just, there's no blank canvas

33:33.360 --> 33:34.400
 to try something on.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.480
 Yeah, it's an opportunity for a fresh start.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.440
 The funny thing about the conversation we're having

33:39.440 --> 33:42.520
 is not often had, I mean, even by Elon,

33:42.520 --> 33:43.720
 he's so focused on Starship

33:43.720 --> 33:46.160
 and actually putting the first human on Mars.

33:46.160 --> 33:51.160
 I think thinking about this kind of stuff is inspiring.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.160
 It makes us dream, it makes us hope for the future.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.080
 And it makes us somehow thinking about civilization on Mars

33:59.080 --> 34:03.240
 is helping us think about the civilization here on Earth.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.040
 Yeah, totally. And how we should run it.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.600
 Well, what do you think are, like in our lifetime,

34:07.600 --> 34:11.180
 are we gonna, I think any effort that goes to Mars,

34:11.180 --> 34:13.280
 the goal is in this decade.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.400
 Do you think that's actually gonna be achieved?

34:15.400 --> 34:18.840
 I have a big bet, $10,000 with a friend

34:18.840 --> 34:21.480
 when I was drunk in an argument.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.320
 This is great.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.960
 That the Neil Armstrong of Mars,

34:23.960 --> 34:28.680
 whoever he or she may be, will set foot by the end of 2030.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.960
 Now, this was probably in 2018 when I had this argument.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.800
 So, like what if it?

34:31.800 --> 34:35.560
 So, a human has to touch Mars by the end of 2030.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.120
 Oh, by the year 30.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.600
 Yeah, by January 1st, 2031.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.440
 Yeah.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.120
 Did you agree on the time zone or what?

34:44.120 --> 34:44.960
 No, no.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.080
 If it's coming on that exact day,

34:46.080 --> 34:47.600
 that's gonna be really stressful.

34:48.860 --> 34:52.120
 But anyway, I think that there will be.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.240
 That was 2018.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.920
 I was more confident then.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.240
 I think it's gonna be around this time.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.240
 I mean, I still won the general bet

34:58.240 --> 34:59.680
 because his point was, you are crazy.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.120
 This is not gonna happen in our lifetimes.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.640
 I've been offered many, many decades.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.520
 And I said, you're wrong.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.520
 You don't know what's going on in SpaceX.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.200
 I think if the world depended on it,

35:08.200 --> 35:10.480
 I think probably SpaceX could probably.

35:10.480 --> 35:11.520
 I mean, I don't know this,

35:11.520 --> 35:14.440
 but I think the tech is almost there.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.600
 Like, I don't think, of course,

35:16.600 --> 35:18.160
 it's delayed many years by safety.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.360
 So, they first wanna send a ship around Mars

35:20.360 --> 35:22.080
 and they wanna land a cargo ship on Mars.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.320
 And there's the moon on the way to.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.360
 Yeah, yeah, there's a lot.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.000
 But I think the moon, a decade before,

35:27.000 --> 35:30.640
 seemed like magical tech that humans didn't have.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.160
 This is like, no, we can,

35:33.160 --> 35:35.600
 it's totally conceivable that this,

35:35.600 --> 35:36.720
 you've seen Starship,

35:36.720 --> 35:41.720
 like it is a interplanetary colonial

35:41.720 --> 35:43.960
 or interplanetary transport like system.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.400
 That's what they used to call it.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.520
 The SpaceX, the way they do it is,

35:47.520 --> 35:49.000
 every time they do a launch,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.120
 something fails usually, when they're testing

35:52.120 --> 35:54.280
 and they learn a thousand things.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.320
 The amount of data they get and they improve so,

35:57.320 --> 36:00.120
 each one has, it's like they've moved up

36:00.120 --> 36:01.560
 like eight generations in each one.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.480
 Anyway, so it's not inconceivable that pretty soon

36:04.480 --> 36:07.600
 they could send a Starship to Mars and land it.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.520
 There's just no good reason

36:08.520 --> 36:09.800
 I don't think that they couldn't do that.

36:09.800 --> 36:10.840
 And so, if they could do that,

36:10.840 --> 36:13.880
 they could in theory send a person to Mars pretty soon.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.720
 Now, taking off from Mars and coming back,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.920
 again, I think, I don't think anyone want

36:17.920 --> 36:20.320
 to be on that voyage today because there's just,

36:20.320 --> 36:21.160
 you know, they're still in,

36:21.160 --> 36:24.640
 it's still amateur hour here and getting that perfect.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.960
 I don't think we're too far away now.

36:25.960 --> 36:30.000
 The question is, so every 26 months,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.720
 Earth laps Mars, right?

36:31.720 --> 36:34.240
 It's like a sinusoidal, soil orbit

36:34.240 --> 36:37.200
 or whatever it's called, the period, 26 months.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.080
 So it's right now, like in the evens,

36:39.080 --> 36:43.000
 like 2022 is gonna have one of these, late 2024.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.200
 So people could, this was the earliest estimate I heard.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.920
 Elon said, maybe we can send people to Mars in 2024,

36:48.920 --> 36:51.720
 you know, to land in early 2025.

36:51.720 --> 36:54.360
 That is not gonna happen because that included 2022

36:54.360 --> 36:58.480
 sending a cargo ship to Mars, maybe even a one in 2020.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.080
 And so I think they're not quite on that schedule,

37:00.080 --> 37:03.360
 but to win my bet, 2027, I have a chance

37:03.360 --> 37:05.520
 and 2029, I have another chance.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.880
 We're not very good at like backing up

37:06.880 --> 37:07.720
 and seeing the big picture.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.280
 We're very distracted by what's going on today

37:09.280 --> 37:10.800
 and what we can believe

37:10.800 --> 37:12.440
 because it's happening in front of our face.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.400
 There's no way that humans gonna be landing on Mars

37:15.400 --> 37:17.480
 and it's not gonna be the only thing

37:17.480 --> 37:18.840
 everyone is talking about, right?

37:18.840 --> 37:20.480
 I mean, it's gonna be the moon landing,

37:20.480 --> 37:23.040
 but even bigger deal, going to another planet, right?

37:23.040 --> 37:24.600
 And for it to start a colony,

37:24.600 --> 37:27.080
 not just to, again, high five and come back.

37:27.080 --> 37:31.720
 So this is like the 2020s, maybe the 2030s

37:31.720 --> 37:33.160
 is gonna be the new 1960s.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.240
 We're gonna have a space decade.

37:34.240 --> 37:35.960
 I'm so excited about it.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.040
 And again, it's one of the great leaps for all of life

37:38.040 --> 37:40.480
 happening in our lifetimes, like that's wild.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.720
 To paint a slightly cynical possibility,

37:43.720 --> 37:46.080
 which I don't see happening,

37:46.080 --> 37:49.240
 but I just wanna put sort of value into leadership.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.560
 I think it wasn't obvious that the moon landing

37:52.560 --> 37:55.000
 would be so exciting for all of human civilization.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.960
 Some of that have to do with the right speeches,

37:56.960 --> 37:58.880
 with the space race.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.720
 Like space, depending on how it's presented,

38:01.720 --> 38:03.280
 can be boring.

38:03.280 --> 38:07.600
 I don't think it's been that so far, but I've actually.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.200
 I think space is quite boring right now.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.840
 No, SpaceX is super, but like 10 years ago, space.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.840
 Some writer, I forget who wrote,

38:15.840 --> 38:17.680
 it's like the best magic trick in the show

38:17.680 --> 38:18.560
 happened at the beginning.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.640
 And now they're starting to do this like easy hazard.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.720
 It's like, you can't go in that direction.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.600
 And the line that this writer said is like,

38:23.600 --> 38:28.480
 watching astronauts go up to the space station

38:28.480 --> 38:29.800
 after watching the moon is like

38:29.800 --> 38:31.840
 watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.920
 It's just like, everything is so practical.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.760
 You're going up to the space station, not to explore,

38:36.760 --> 38:38.640
 but to do science experiments in microgravity.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.560
 And you're sending rockets up,

38:41.560 --> 38:43.120
 mostly here and there there's a probe,

38:43.120 --> 38:45.600
 but mostly you're sending them up to put satellites

38:45.600 --> 38:48.560
 for DirecTV or whatever it is.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.880
 It's kind of like lame earth industry usage.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.560
 So I agree with you, space is boring there.

38:55.560 --> 38:59.760
 The first human setting foot on Mars,

38:59.760 --> 39:01.680
 that's gotta be a crazy global event.

39:01.680 --> 39:02.880
 I can't imagine it not being.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.720
 Maybe you're right.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.280
 Maybe I'm taking for granted the speeches

39:05.280 --> 39:06.520
 and the space race and that.

39:06.520 --> 39:09.920
 I think the value of, I guess what I'm pushing

39:09.920 --> 39:12.080
 is the value of people like Elon Musk

39:12.080 --> 39:14.480
 and potentially other leaders that hopefully step up

39:14.480 --> 39:16.160
 is extremely important here.

39:16.160 --> 39:19.240
 Like I would argue without the publicity of SpaceX,

39:19.240 --> 39:21.360
 it's not just the ingenuity of SpaceX,

39:21.360 --> 39:23.400
 but like what they've done publicly

39:23.400 --> 39:25.720
 by having a figure that tweets

39:25.720 --> 39:27.640
 and all that kind of stuff like that,

39:27.640 --> 39:29.560
 that's a source of inspiration.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.400
 Totally.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.680
 NASA wasn't able to quite pull off with a shuttle.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.000
 That's one of his two reasons for doing this.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.240
 SpaceX exists for two reasons.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.160
 One, life insurance for the species.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.560
 I always think about this way.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.440
 If you're an alien on some far away planet

39:44.440 --> 39:46.680
 and you're rooting against humanity

39:46.680 --> 39:49.560
 and you win the bet if humanity goes extinct,

39:49.560 --> 39:51.520
 you do not like SpaceX.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.000
 You do not want them to have their eggs

39:53.000 --> 39:54.160
 in two baskets now.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.000
 Yeah.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.440
 Sure, it's like obviously you could have something

39:59.440 --> 40:00.600
 that kills everyone on both planets,

40:00.600 --> 40:02.080
 some AI war or something.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.840
 But the point is obviously it's good for our chances,

40:06.840 --> 40:08.560
 our longterm chances to be having

40:08.560 --> 40:11.320
 two self sustaining civilizations going on.

40:11.320 --> 40:15.000
 The second reason, he values this I think just as high

40:15.000 --> 40:17.360
 is it's the greatest adventure in history

40:17.360 --> 40:21.000
 going multi planetary and that people need some reason

40:21.000 --> 40:21.960
 to wake up in the morning

40:21.960 --> 40:26.240
 and it'll just be this hopefully great uniting event too.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.560
 I mean, today's nasty, awful political environment,

40:29.560 --> 40:34.080
 which is like a whirlpool that sucks everything into it.

40:34.080 --> 40:38.000
 So you name a thing and it's become a nasty political topic.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.720
 So I hope that space can,

40:42.720 --> 40:44.760
 Mars can just bring everyone together,

40:44.760 --> 40:46.920
 but it could become this hideous thing

40:46.920 --> 40:48.640
 where it's a billionaire,

40:48.640 --> 40:50.720
 some annoying storyline gets built.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.160
 So half the people think that anyone who's excited about Mars

40:53.160 --> 40:55.720
 is an evil something.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.920
 Anyway, I hope it is super exciting.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.920
 So far space has been a uniting, inspiring thing.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.000
 And in fact, especially during this time of a pandemic

41:06.000 --> 41:08.960
 has been just a commercial entity

41:08.960 --> 41:12.080
 putting out humans into space for the first time

41:12.080 --> 41:15.240
 was just one of the only big sources of hope.

41:15.240 --> 41:19.000
 Totally in awe, just like watching this huge skyscraper

41:19.000 --> 41:21.440
 go up in the air, flip over, go back down and land.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.160
 I mean, it just makes everyone just wanna sit back

41:23.160 --> 41:25.000
 and clap and kinda like,

41:25.000 --> 41:26.640
 the way I look at something like SpaceX

41:26.640 --> 41:30.240
 is it makes me proud to be a human.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.480
 And I think it makes a lot of people feel that way.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.240
 It's like good for our self esteem.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.080
 It's like, you know what?

41:34.080 --> 41:35.640
 We're pretty, we have a lot of problems,

41:35.640 --> 41:36.960
 but like we're kind of awesome.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.000
 And if we can put people on Mars,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.400
 sticking up an earth flag on Mars,

41:41.400 --> 41:43.800
 like damn, we should be so proud

41:43.800 --> 41:45.360
 of our like little family here.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.440
 Like we did something cool.

41:46.440 --> 41:51.160
 And by the way, I've made it clear to SpaceX people,

41:51.160 --> 41:52.520
 including Elon, many times,

41:52.520 --> 41:54.000
 and it's like once a year reminder

41:54.000 --> 41:56.880
 that if they want to make this more exciting,

41:56.880 --> 42:00.840
 they send the writer to Mars on the thing.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.320
 And I'll blog about it.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.920
 So I'm just continuing to throw this out there.

42:04.920 --> 42:05.760
 On which trip?

42:05.760 --> 42:07.480
 I'm trying to get them to send me to Mars.

42:07.480 --> 42:08.840
 No, I understand that.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.280
 So I just wanna clarify

42:10.280 --> 42:12.400
 on which trip does the writer wanna go?

42:12.400 --> 42:14.120
 I think my dream one, to be honest,

42:14.120 --> 42:16.960
 would be like the Apollo eight,

42:16.960 --> 42:19.720
 where they just looped around the moon and came back.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.760
 Cause landing on Mars.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.880
 Give you a lot of good content to write about.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.200
 Great content, right?

42:26.200 --> 42:28.680
 I mean, the amount of kind of high minded,

42:28.680 --> 42:30.160
 and so I would go into the thing

42:30.160 --> 42:34.080
 and I would blog about it and I'd be in microgravity.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.480
 So I'd be bouncing around my little space.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.040
 I get a little, they can just send me in a dragon.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.520
 They don't need to do a whole starship.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.840
 And I would bounce around and I would get to,

42:41.840 --> 42:43.640
 I've always had a dream of going

42:43.640 --> 42:47.280
 to like one of those nice jails for a year.

42:47.280 --> 42:49.560
 Because I just have nothing to do besides like read books

42:49.560 --> 42:51.520
 and no responsibilities and no social plans.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.560
 So this is the ultimate version of that.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.320
 Anyway, it's a side topic, but I think it would be.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.280
 But also if you, I mean, to be honest,

42:57.280 --> 43:00.040
 if you land on Mars, it's epic.

43:00.040 --> 43:04.080
 And then if you die there of like finishing your writing,

43:04.080 --> 43:06.600
 it will be just even that much more powerful

43:06.600 --> 43:08.400
 for the impact.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.760
 Yeah, but then I'm gone.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.160
 And I don't even get to like experience the publication

43:12.160 --> 43:14.360
 of it, which is the whole point of some of the greatest

43:14.360 --> 43:16.920
 writers in history didn't get a chance to experience

43:16.920 --> 43:18.080
 the publication of their.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.800
 I know, I don't really think that I think like,

43:19.800 --> 43:21.360
 I think back to Jesus and I'm like, oh man,

43:21.360 --> 43:23.200
 that guy really like crushed it, you know?

43:23.200 --> 43:24.800
 But then if you think about it,

43:26.080 --> 43:28.360
 it doesn't like you could literally die today

43:28.360 --> 43:31.280
 and then become the next Jesus, like 2000 years from now

43:31.280 --> 43:33.560
 in this civilization that's like, there are, you know,

43:33.560 --> 43:35.860
 they're like in magical in the clouds

43:35.860 --> 43:38.760
 and they're worshiping you, they're worshiping Lex.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.680
 And like, that sounds like your ego probably would be like,

43:40.680 --> 43:43.120
 wow, that's pretty cool, except irrelevant to you

43:43.120 --> 43:44.280
 because you never even knew it happened.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.520
 This feels like a Rick and Morty episode.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.960
 It does, it does.

43:47.960 --> 43:51.760
 Okay, you've talked to Elon quite a bit,

43:51.760 --> 43:53.880
 you've written about him quite a bit.

43:53.880 --> 43:58.320
 Just, it'd be cool to hear you talk about

43:58.320 --> 44:00.200
 what are your ideas of what, you know,

44:00.200 --> 44:02.960
 the magic sauces you've written about with Elon.

44:02.960 --> 44:06.080
 What makes him so successful?

44:06.080 --> 44:09.040
 His style of thinking, his ambition, his dreams,

44:09.040 --> 44:11.780
 his, the people he connects with,

44:11.780 --> 44:13.120
 the kind of problems he tackles.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.740
 Is there a kind of comments you can make

44:14.740 --> 44:16.240
 about what makes him special?

44:16.240 --> 44:18.480
 I think that obviously there's a lot of things

44:18.480 --> 44:19.400
 that he's very good at.

44:19.400 --> 44:23.240
 He has, he's obviously super intelligent.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.940
 His heart is very much in like, I think the right place.

44:25.940 --> 44:28.720
 Like, you know, I really, really believe that like,

44:28.720 --> 44:30.120
 and I think people can sense that, you know,

44:30.120 --> 44:32.840
 he just doesn't seem like a grifter of any kind.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.560
 He's truly trying to do these big things

44:34.560 --> 44:36.080
 for the right reasons.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.360
 And he's obviously crazy ambitious and hardworking, right?

44:38.360 --> 44:39.200
 Not everyone is.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.880
 Some people are as talented and have cool visions,

44:40.880 --> 44:43.800
 but they just don't wanna spend their life that way.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.420
 So, but that's, none of those alone

44:46.420 --> 44:48.120
 is what makes Elon, Elon.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.840
 I mean, if it were, there'd be more of him

44:49.840 --> 44:51.480
 because there's a lot of people that are very smart

44:51.480 --> 44:53.920
 and smart enough to accumulate a lot of money and influence

44:53.920 --> 44:56.920
 and they have great ambition and they have, you know,

44:56.920 --> 44:58.800
 their hearts in the right place.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.980
 To me, it is the very unusual quality he has

45:01.980 --> 45:04.020
 is that he's sane in a way

45:04.020 --> 45:06.360
 that almost every human is crazy.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.800
 What I mean by that is we are programmed

45:10.480 --> 45:15.480
 to trust conventional wisdom over our own reasoning

45:17.560 --> 45:19.120
 for good reason.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.800
 If you go back 50,000 years and conventional wisdom says,

45:22.800 --> 45:26.020
 you know, don't eat that berry, you know,

45:26.020 --> 45:28.980
 or this is the way you tie a spearhead to a spear.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.680
 And you're thinking, I'm smarter than that.

45:31.680 --> 45:32.640
 Like, you're not.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.080
 You know, that comes from the accumulation

45:35.080 --> 45:37.040
 of life experience, accumulation of observation

45:37.040 --> 45:39.640
 and experience over many generations.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.760
 And that's a little mini version

45:41.760 --> 45:43.360
 of the collective super intelligence.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.360
 It's like, you know, it's equivalent

45:45.360 --> 45:46.640
 of like making a pencil today.

45:46.640 --> 45:51.640
 Like people back then, like the conventional wisdom,

45:51.840 --> 45:54.160
 like had this super, this knowledge

45:54.160 --> 45:56.080
 that no human could ever accumulate.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.720
 So we're very wired to trust it.

45:57.720 --> 46:00.820
 Plus the secondary thing is that the people who, you know,

46:00.820 --> 46:02.720
 just say that they believe the mountain is,

46:02.720 --> 46:04.680
 they worship the mountain as their God, right?

46:04.680 --> 46:06.120
 And the mountain determines their fate.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.340
 That's not true, right?

46:07.340 --> 46:08.600
 And the conventional wisdom is wrong there,

46:08.600 --> 46:12.720
 but believing it was helpful to survival

46:12.720 --> 46:15.280
 because you were part of the crowd

46:15.280 --> 46:16.120
 and you stayed in the tribe.

46:16.120 --> 46:20.240
 And if you started to, you know, insult the mountain God

46:20.240 --> 46:22.220
 and say, that's just a mountain, it's not, you know,

46:22.220 --> 46:23.320
 you didn't fare very well, right?

46:23.320 --> 46:25.840
 So for a lot of reasons, it was a great survival trait

46:25.840 --> 46:29.400
 to just trust what other people said and believe it.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.720
 And truly, you know, obviously, you know,

46:30.720 --> 46:32.960
 the more you really believed it, the better.

46:32.960 --> 46:37.960
 Today, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world

46:39.880 --> 46:42.400
 and a huge giant society,

46:42.400 --> 46:44.160
 our brains are not built to understand that.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.680
 They have a few settings, you know,

46:45.680 --> 46:47.760
 and none of them is, you know,

46:47.760 --> 46:49.560
 300 million person society.

46:49.560 --> 46:52.500
 So your brain is basically,

46:54.840 --> 46:57.740
 is treating a lot of things like a small tribe,

46:57.740 --> 46:58.580
 even though they're not,

46:58.580 --> 47:01.600
 and they're treating conventional wisdom as, you know,

47:01.600 --> 47:03.640
 very wise in a way that it's not.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.800
 If you think about it this way, it's like, picture a,

47:05.800 --> 47:08.180
 like a bucket that's not moving very much,

47:08.180 --> 47:09.480
 moving like a millimeter a year.

47:09.480 --> 47:11.200
 And so it has time to collect a lot of water in it.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.600
 That's like conventional wisdom in the old days

47:12.600 --> 47:13.640
 when very few things changed.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.900
 Like your 10, you know, great, great, great grandmother

47:15.900 --> 47:17.040
 probably lived a similar life to you,

47:17.040 --> 47:19.280
 maybe on the same piece of land.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.140
 And so old people really knew what they were talking about.

47:21.140 --> 47:23.360
 Today, the bucket's moving really quickly.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.160
 And so, you know, the wisdom doesn't accumulate,

47:25.160 --> 47:27.240
 but we think it does because our brain settings

47:27.240 --> 47:29.020
 doesn't have the, oh, move, you know,

47:29.020 --> 47:31.480
 quickly moving bucket setting on it.

47:31.480 --> 47:35.660
 So my grandmother gives me advice all the time,

47:35.660 --> 47:38.460
 and I have to decide, is this,

47:38.460 --> 47:40.220
 so there are certain things that are not changing,

47:40.220 --> 47:42.760
 like relationships and love and loyalty

47:42.760 --> 47:44.020
 and things like this.

47:44.020 --> 47:45.740
 Her advice on those things, I'll listen to it all day.

47:45.740 --> 47:46.840
 She's one of the people who said,

47:46.840 --> 47:48.520
 you've got to live near your people you love,

47:48.520 --> 47:50.020
 live near your family, right?

47:50.020 --> 47:52.840
 I think that is like tremendous wisdom, right?

47:52.840 --> 47:54.440
 That is wisdom, because that's happens to be something

47:54.440 --> 47:56.640
 that hasn't, doesn't change from generation to generation.

47:56.640 --> 47:57.480
 For now.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.660
 Right, she all, right, for now.

47:59.660 --> 48:01.560
 She's also telling, right, so I'll be the idiot

48:01.560 --> 48:03.400
 telling my brain that they'll actually be in the,

48:03.400 --> 48:05.760
 it's a metaverse, like being like, it doesn't matter.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.480
 And I'm like, you have to, it's not the same

48:07.480 --> 48:08.320
 when you're not in person.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.440
 They're gonna say, it's exactly the same, grandpa.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.560
 And they'll also be thinking to me with their near link,

48:12.560 --> 48:13.920
 and I'm gonna be like, slow down.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.000
 I don't understand what you're saying.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.600
 You just talk like a normal person.

48:16.600 --> 48:19.520
 Anyway, so my grandmother then, but then she says,

48:19.520 --> 48:21.320
 you know, you're, I don't know about this writing

48:21.320 --> 48:23.100
 you're doing, you should go to law school,

48:23.100 --> 48:25.160
 and you know, you want to be secure.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.800
 And that's not good advice for me.

48:26.800 --> 48:28.080
 You know, given the world I'm in,

48:28.080 --> 48:30.720
 and what I like to do, and what I'm good at,

48:30.720 --> 48:31.820
 that's not the right advice.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.960
 But because the world is totally,

48:33.960 --> 48:34.800
 she's in a different world.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.480
 So she became wise for a world that's no longer here, right?

48:37.480 --> 48:38.820
 Now, if you think about that,

48:38.820 --> 48:40.620
 so then when we think about conventional wisdom,

48:40.620 --> 48:41.820
 it's a little like my grandmother,

48:41.820 --> 48:45.080
 and there's a lot of, no, it's not maybe, you know,

48:45.080 --> 48:47.160
 60 years outdated like her software.

48:47.160 --> 48:50.240
 It's maybe 10 years outdated conventional wisdom,

48:50.240 --> 48:51.540
 sometimes 20.

48:51.540 --> 48:55.540
 So anyway, I think that we all continually

48:55.540 --> 48:58.540
 don't have the confidence in our own reasoning

48:58.540 --> 49:00.760
 when it conflicts with what everyone else thinks,

49:00.760 --> 49:02.800
 when with what seems right.

49:02.800 --> 49:06.140
 We don't have the guts to act on that reasoning

49:06.140 --> 49:07.080
 for that reason, right?

49:07.080 --> 49:11.000
 You know, we, and so there's so many Elon examples.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.240
 I mean, just from the beginning,

49:12.240 --> 49:14.720
 building Zip2 was his first company.

49:15.640 --> 49:19.400
 And it was internet advertising at the time

49:19.400 --> 49:22.120
 when people said, you know, this internet was brand new,

49:22.120 --> 49:24.000
 like kind of thinking of like the metaverse,

49:24.000 --> 49:24.880
 VR metaverse today.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.000
 And people would be like, oh, we, you know,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.120
 we facilitate internet advertising.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.720
 People were saying, yeah, people are gonna advertise

49:30.720 --> 49:32.000
 on the internet, yeah, right.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.720
 Actually, it wasn't that he's magical and saw the future,

49:34.720 --> 49:36.240
 it's that he looked at the present,

49:36.240 --> 49:38.480
 looked at what the internet was,

49:38.480 --> 49:40.920
 thought about, you know, the obvious

49:40.920 --> 49:43.960
 like advertising opportunity this was gonna be.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.320
 It wasn't rocket science.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.760
 It wasn't genius, I don't believe.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.840
 I think it was just seeing the truth.

49:48.840 --> 49:50.200
 And when everyone else is laughing,

49:50.200 --> 49:51.520
 saying, well, you're wrong.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.720
 I mean, I did the math and here it is, right?

49:54.720 --> 49:56.760
 Next company, you know, x.com,

49:56.760 --> 49:58.540
 which became eventually PayPal.

49:59.640 --> 50:00.720
 People said, oh yeah, people are gonna put

50:00.720 --> 50:02.760
 their financial information on the internet.

50:02.760 --> 50:03.600
 No way.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.200
 To us, it seems so obvious.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.040
 If you went back then, you would probably feel the same.

50:08.040 --> 50:11.000
 You'd think this is, that is a fake company that no,

50:11.000 --> 50:12.880
 it's just obviously not a good idea.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.400
 He looked around and said, you know, I see where this is.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.720
 And so again, he could see where it was going

50:15.720 --> 50:17.240
 because he could see what it was that day

50:17.240 --> 50:19.280
 and not what it, you know, not people, conventional wisdom

50:19.280 --> 50:21.680
 was still a bunch of years earlier.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.560
 SpaceX is the ultimate example.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.000
 A friend of his apparently bought,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.360
 actually compiled a montage, video montage

50:28.360 --> 50:32.100
 of rockets blowing up to show him this is not a good idea.

50:32.100 --> 50:34.480
 And if, but just even the bigger picture,

50:34.480 --> 50:36.240
 the amount of billionaires who have like thought

50:36.240 --> 50:38.800
 this was, I'm gonna start launching rockets

50:38.800 --> 50:40.380
 and you know, the amount that failed.

50:40.380 --> 50:43.560
 I mean, it's not, conventional wisdom said

50:43.560 --> 50:44.640
 this isn't a bad endeavor.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.960
 He was putting all of his money into it.

50:45.960 --> 50:49.280
 Yeah, landing rockets was another thing.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.520
 You know, well, if you know,

50:50.520 --> 50:52.880
 here's the classic kind of way we reason,

50:52.880 --> 50:55.480
 which is if this could be done,

50:55.480 --> 50:57.280
 NASA would have done it a long time ago

50:57.280 --> 50:58.620
 because of the money it would save.

50:58.620 --> 50:59.760
 This could be done, the Soviet Union

50:59.760 --> 51:01.680
 would have done it back in the sixties.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.480
 It's obviously something that can't be done.

51:03.480 --> 51:06.280
 And the math on his envelope said,

51:06.280 --> 51:07.240
 well, I think it can be done.

51:07.240 --> 51:08.140
 And so he just did it.

51:08.140 --> 51:10.500
 So in each of these cases, I think actually in some ways,

51:10.500 --> 51:12.280
 Elon gets too much credit as, you know,

51:12.280 --> 51:13.940
 people think it's that he's, you know,

51:13.940 --> 51:15.400
 it's that his Einstein intelligence

51:15.400 --> 51:16.680
 or he can see the future.

51:16.680 --> 51:19.560
 He has incredible, he has incredible guts.

51:19.560 --> 51:20.820
 He's so, you know, courageous.

51:20.820 --> 51:23.480
 I think if you actually are looking at reality

51:24.760 --> 51:26.680
 and you're just assessing probabilities

51:26.680 --> 51:29.160
 and you're ignoring all the noise, which is wrong,

51:29.160 --> 51:30.320
 so wrong, right?

51:30.320 --> 51:33.040
 And you just, then you just have to be, you know,

51:33.040 --> 51:36.460
 pretty smart and pretty courageous.

51:36.460 --> 51:39.720
 And you have to have this magical ability to be seen

51:39.720 --> 51:42.240
 and trust your reasoning over conventional wisdom

51:42.240 --> 51:44.560
 because your individual reasoning, you know,

51:44.560 --> 51:46.800
 part of it is that we see that we can't build a pencil.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.160
 We can't build, you know,

51:48.160 --> 51:49.920
 this civilization on our own, right?

51:49.920 --> 51:51.640
 So we kind of count, you know,

51:51.640 --> 51:56.320
 count to the collective for good reasons.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.840
 But this is different when it comes to kind of

51:57.840 --> 51:59.200
 what's possible, you know,

51:59.200 --> 52:02.800
 the Beatles were doing their kind of Motowny chord patterns

52:02.800 --> 52:03.760
 in the early sixties.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.560
 And they were doing what was normal.

52:05.560 --> 52:08.900
 They were doing what was clearly this kind of sound is a hit.

52:08.900 --> 52:10.040
 Then they started getting weird

52:10.040 --> 52:11.480
 because they were so popular.

52:11.480 --> 52:12.600
 They had this confidence to say,

52:12.600 --> 52:15.160
 let's just, we're gonna start just experimenting.

52:15.160 --> 52:17.200
 And it turns out that like,

52:17.200 --> 52:18.560
 if you just, all these people are in this,

52:18.560 --> 52:20.280
 like one groove together doing music,

52:20.280 --> 52:22.920
 and it's just like, there's a lot of land over there.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.480
 And it seems like, you know,

52:24.480 --> 52:25.800
 I'm sure the managers would say,

52:25.800 --> 52:28.040
 and that the, all the record execs would say,

52:28.040 --> 52:29.000
 no, you have to be here.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.440
 This is what sells.

52:30.440 --> 52:31.920
 And it's just not true.

52:31.920 --> 52:33.280
 So I think that Elon is why,

52:33.280 --> 52:35.320
 that's why the term for this

52:35.320 --> 52:36.920
 that actually Elon likes to use

52:36.920 --> 52:39.960
 is reasoning from first principles, the physics term.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.720
 First principles are your axioms.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.480
 And physicists, they don't say, well, what's,

52:43.480 --> 52:44.960
 you know, what do people think?

52:44.960 --> 52:46.340
 No, they say, what are the axioms?

52:46.340 --> 52:47.320
 Those are the puzzle pieces.

52:47.320 --> 52:49.320
 Let's use those to build a conclusion.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.240
 That's our hypothesis.

52:50.240 --> 52:51.280
 Now let's test it, right?

52:51.280 --> 52:53.320
 And they come up with all kinds of new things

52:53.320 --> 52:55.080
 constantly by doing that.

52:55.080 --> 52:57.480
 If Einstein was assuming conventional wisdom was right,

52:57.480 --> 52:59.400
 he never would have even tried to create something

52:59.400 --> 53:02.120
 that really disproved Newton's laws.

53:02.120 --> 53:05.480
 And the other way to reason is reasoning by analogy,

53:05.480 --> 53:08.160
 which is a great shortcut.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.500
 It's when we look at other people's reasoning

53:10.500 --> 53:13.280
 and we kind of photocopy it into our head, we steal it.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.940
 So reasoning by analogy, we do all the time.

53:15.940 --> 53:17.040
 And it's usually a good thing.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.620
 I mean, we don't, it takes a lot of mental energy and time

53:19.620 --> 53:20.600
 to reason from first principles.

53:20.600 --> 53:21.500
 It's actually, you know,

53:21.500 --> 53:23.320
 you don't wanna reinvent the wheel every time, right?

53:23.320 --> 53:26.400
 You want to often copy other people's reasoning

53:26.400 --> 53:27.240
 most of the time.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.720
 And I, you know, most of us do it most of the time

53:28.720 --> 53:30.000
 and that's good, but there's certain moments

53:30.000 --> 53:31.520
 when you're, forget just for a second,

53:31.520 --> 53:34.500
 like succeeding in like the world of like Elon,

53:34.500 --> 53:35.600
 just who you're gonna marry,

53:35.600 --> 53:36.600
 where are you gonna settle down?

53:36.600 --> 53:38.820
 How are you gonna raise your kids?

53:38.820 --> 53:40.880
 How are you gonna educate your kids?

53:40.880 --> 53:42.240
 How you should educate yourself?

53:42.240 --> 53:43.720
 What kind of career paths in terms,

53:43.720 --> 53:45.720
 these moments, this is what on your death bed,

53:45.720 --> 53:47.120
 like you look back on and that's what,

53:47.120 --> 53:49.280
 these are the few number of choices

53:49.280 --> 53:50.480
 that really define your life.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.280
 Those should not be reasoned by analogy.

53:52.280 --> 53:55.200
 You should absolutely try to reason from first principles.

53:55.200 --> 53:58.320
 And Elon, not just by the way in his work,

53:58.320 --> 53:59.360
 but in his personal life.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.440
 I mean, if you just look at the way he's on Twitter,

54:01.440 --> 54:03.400
 he's not, it's not how you're supposed to be

54:03.400 --> 54:07.280
 when you're a super famous, you know, industry titan.

54:07.280 --> 54:08.880
 You're not supposed to just be silly on Twitter

54:08.880 --> 54:11.840
 and do memes and getting little quibbles with you.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.320
 He just does things his own way,

54:14.320 --> 54:15.880
 regardless of what you're supposed to do,

54:15.880 --> 54:17.640
 which sometimes serves him and sometimes doesn't,

54:17.640 --> 54:21.520
 but I think it has taken him where it has taken him.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.400
 Yeah, I mean, I probably wouldn't describe

54:23.400 --> 54:26.000
 his approach to Twitter as first principles,

54:26.000 --> 54:26.820
 but I guess it has the same element.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.320
 I think it is.

54:28.320 --> 54:30.060
 Well, first of all, I will say that a lot of tweets,

54:30.060 --> 54:32.560
 people think, oh, like he's gonna be done after that.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.440
 He's fine, he's just one man, time man of the year.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.560
 Like it's something, it's not sinking him,

54:38.560 --> 54:40.600
 and I think, you know, it's not that I think

54:40.600 --> 54:41.760
 this is like super reasoned out.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.440
 I think that, you know, Twitter is his silly side,

54:43.440 --> 54:48.280
 but I think that he saw,

54:48.280 --> 54:50.800
 his reasoning did not feel like there was a giant risk

54:50.800 --> 54:52.520
 in just being his silly self on Twitter,

54:52.520 --> 54:53.600
 when a lot of billionaires would say,

54:53.600 --> 54:55.560
 well, no one else is doing that.

54:55.560 --> 54:58.160
 So it must be a good reason, right?

54:58.160 --> 55:01.120
 Well, I gotta say that he inspires me to,

55:01.120 --> 55:02.880
 that's okay to be silly.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.240
 Totally. On Twitter.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.680
 And, but yeah, you're right.

55:06.680 --> 55:09.000
 The big inspiration is the willingness to do that

55:09.000 --> 55:11.040
 when nobody else is doing it.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.280
 Yeah, and I think about all the great artists,

55:13.280 --> 55:16.240
 you know, all the great inventors and entrepreneurs,

55:16.240 --> 55:17.800
 almost all of them,

55:17.800 --> 55:19.480
 they had a moment when they trusted their reasoning.

55:19.480 --> 55:24.480
 I mean, Airbnb was over 60 with VCs.

55:24.920 --> 55:25.840
 A lot of people would say,

55:25.840 --> 55:28.960
 obviously they know something we don't, right?

55:28.960 --> 55:30.680
 But they didn't, they said, eh, I think they're all wrong.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.980
 I mean, that's, that takes some kind of different wiring

55:32.980 --> 55:34.240
 in your brain.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.440
 And then that's both for big picture

55:36.440 --> 55:39.520
 and detailed like engineering problems.

55:39.520 --> 55:40.800
 It's fun to talk to him.

55:40.800 --> 55:42.200
 It's fun to talk to Jim Keller,

55:42.200 --> 55:44.520
 who's a good example of this kind of thinking

55:44.520 --> 55:47.560
 about like manufacturing, how to get costs down.

55:47.560 --> 55:49.080
 They always talk about like,

55:49.080 --> 55:52.240
 they talk about SpaceX rockets this way.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.900
 They talk about manufacturing this way,

55:53.900 --> 55:58.900
 like cost per pound or per ton to get to orbit

56:01.200 --> 56:02.560
 or something like that.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.640
 This is all the reason we need to get the cost down.

56:04.640 --> 56:07.120
 It's a very kind of raw materials.

56:07.120 --> 56:07.960
 Yeah.

56:07.960 --> 56:10.520
 Like just very basic way of thinking.

56:10.520 --> 56:11.680
 First principles.

56:11.680 --> 56:12.920
 It's really, yeah.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.040
 And the first principles of a rocket

56:14.040 --> 56:16.400
 are like the price of raw materials

56:16.400 --> 56:19.840
 and gravity, you know, and wind.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.840
 I mean, these are your first principles and fuel.

56:24.540 --> 56:29.160
 Henry Ford, you know, what made Henry Ford blow up

56:29.160 --> 56:30.680
 as an entrepreneur?

56:30.680 --> 56:32.040
 The assembly line, right?

56:32.040 --> 56:35.160
 I mean, he thought for a second and said,

56:35.160 --> 56:38.280
 this isn't how manufacturing is normally done this way,

56:38.280 --> 56:40.680
 but I think this is a different kind of product.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.040
 And that's what changed it.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.640
 And then what happened is when someone reasons

56:43.640 --> 56:45.280
 from first principles, they often fail.

56:45.280 --> 56:47.640
 You know, you're going out into the fog

56:47.640 --> 56:49.320
 with no conventional wisdom to guide you.

56:49.320 --> 56:51.200
 But when you succeed, what you notice is that

56:51.200 --> 56:52.800
 everyone else turns and says, wait, what, what?

56:52.800 --> 56:53.640
 What are they doing?

56:53.640 --> 56:55.220
 And they all, they flock over.

56:55.220 --> 56:56.480
 Look at the iPhone.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.780
 iPhone, you know, Steve Jobs was obviously famously good

56:58.780 --> 57:00.120
 at reasoning from first principles

57:00.120 --> 57:02.840
 because that guy had crazy self confidence.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.840
 He just said, you know, if I think this is right,

57:04.840 --> 57:06.320
 like everyone, and that, I mean, I don't know how,

57:06.320 --> 57:07.520
 I don't know how he does that.

57:07.520 --> 57:09.600
 And I don't think Apple can do that anymore.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.440
 I mean, they lost that.

57:10.440 --> 57:13.360
 That one brain, his ability to do that was made

57:13.360 --> 57:14.800
 that in a totally different company,

57:14.800 --> 57:17.280
 even though there's tens of thousands of people there.

57:17.280 --> 57:20.200
 He said, he didn't say, and I'm giving a lot of credit

57:20.200 --> 57:23.160
 to Steve Jobs, but of course it was a team at Apple

57:23.160 --> 57:26.320
 who said they didn't look at the flip phones and say,

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
 okay, well kind of, you know, let's make a keyboard

57:28.320 --> 57:30.040
 that's like clicky and, you know, really cool Apple.

57:30.040 --> 57:32.440
 A keyboard, they said, what should a mobile device be?

57:32.440 --> 57:35.640
 You know, what the axioms, what are the axioms here?

57:35.640 --> 57:37.480
 And none of them involved a keyboard necessarily.

57:37.480 --> 57:39.140
 And by the time they piece it up, there was no keyboards.

57:39.140 --> 57:40.320
 It didn't make sense.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.000
 Everyone suddenly is going, wait, what, what are they doing?

57:42.000 --> 57:42.840
 What are they?

57:42.840 --> 57:43.720
 And now every phone looks like the iPhone.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.720
 I mean, that's, that's how it goes.

57:46.720 --> 57:51.360
 You tweeted, what's something you've changed your mind about?

57:51.360 --> 57:53.520
 That's the question you've tweeted.

57:53.520 --> 57:55.920
 Elon replied, brain transplants,

57:55.920 --> 57:58.020
 Sam Harris responded, nuclear power.

57:58.020 --> 58:01.440
 There's a bunch of people with cool responses there.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.600
 In general, what are your thoughts

58:02.600 --> 58:03.800
 about some of the responses

58:03.800 --> 58:07.480
 and what have you changed your mind about big or small,

58:07.480 --> 58:10.560
 perhaps in doing the research for some of your writing?

58:10.560 --> 58:13.800
 So I'm writing right now, just finishing a book

58:13.800 --> 58:18.800
 on kind of why our society is such a shit place at the moment

58:19.060 --> 58:20.160
 just polarized.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.840
 And, you know, we have all these gifts

58:21.840 --> 58:23.700
 like we're talking about, just the supermarket, you know,

58:23.700 --> 58:25.660
 we have these, it's exploding technology.

58:25.660 --> 58:28.040
 Fewer and fewer people are in poverty.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.480
 You know, it's, Louis CK, you know, likes to say,

58:30.480 --> 58:32.480
 you know, everything's amazing and no one's happy, right?

58:32.480 --> 58:35.000
 But it's really extreme moment right now

58:35.000 --> 58:37.400
 where it's like, hate is on the rise,

58:37.400 --> 58:38.760
 like crazy things, right?

58:38.760 --> 58:39.760
 And.

58:39.760 --> 58:41.120
 If I could interrupt briefly,

58:41.120 --> 58:43.400
 you did tweet that you just wrote the last word.

58:43.400 --> 58:44.360
 I sure did.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.980
 And then there's some hilarious asshole who said,

58:46.980 --> 58:49.880
 now you just have to work on all the ones in the middle.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.720
 Yeah, I've heard that.

58:50.720 --> 58:53.000
 I mean, when you, when you earned a reputation

58:53.000 --> 58:55.840
 as a tried and true procrastinator,

58:55.840 --> 58:57.840
 you're just gonna get shit forever.

58:57.840 --> 58:58.680
 And that's fine.

58:58.680 --> 58:59.680
 I accept my fate there.

58:59.680 --> 59:02.080
 So do you mind sharing a little bit more

59:02.080 --> 59:03.760
 about the details of what you're writing?

59:03.760 --> 59:07.880
 So you're, how do you approach this question

59:07.880 --> 59:09.280
 about the state of society?

59:09.280 --> 59:11.800
 I wanted to figure out what was going on

59:11.800 --> 59:15.080
 because what I noticed was a bad trend.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.440
 It's not that, you know, things are bad.

59:16.440 --> 59:19.400
 It's that things are getting worse in certain ways.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.240
 Not in every way.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.160
 Look at Max Roser's stuff, you know,

59:23.160 --> 59:24.920
 he comes up with all these amazing graphs.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.400
 This is what's weird is that things are getting better

59:27.400 --> 59:29.960
 in almost every important metric you can think of,

59:31.640 --> 59:35.280
 except the amount of people who hate other people

59:35.280 --> 59:36.680
 in their own country.

59:36.680 --> 59:40.040
 And the amount of people that hate their own country,

59:40.040 --> 59:42.640
 the amount of Americans that hate America's on the rise,

59:42.640 --> 59:44.120
 right, the amount of Americans

59:44.120 --> 59:47.200
 that hate other Americans is on the rise.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.160
 The amount of Americans that hate the president

59:49.160 --> 59:50.200
 is on the rise, all these things,

59:50.200 --> 59:52.800
 like on a very steep rise.

59:52.800 --> 59:53.720
 So what the hell?

59:53.720 --> 59:54.560
 What's going on?

59:54.560 --> 59:56.160
 Like there's something causing that.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.320
 It's not that, you know, a bunch of new people were born

59:58.320 --> 59:59.280
 who were just dicks.

59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.320
 It's that something is going on.

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:04.120
 So I think of it as a very simple,

1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:07.920
 oversimplified equation, human behavior.

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:09.880
 And it's the output.

1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:12.040
 That I think the two inputs are human nature

1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:13.120
 and environment, right?

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:14.520
 And this is basic, you know,

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:18.480
 super kindergarten level like, you know, animal behavior.

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.120
 But I think it's worth thinking about.

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:21.280
 You've got human nature,

1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:24.040
 which is not changing very much, right?

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:27.600
 And then you got, you throw that nature

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:29.040
 into a certain environment

1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:30.840
 and it reacts to the environment, right?

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.560
 It's shaped by the environment.

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:36.480
 And then eventually what comes out is behavior, right?

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:38.040
 Human nature is not changing very much,

1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:40.320
 but suddenly we're behaving differently, right?

1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:42.600
 We are, again, you know, look at the polls.

1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.160
 Like it used to be that the president, you know,

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:47.080
 was liked by, I don't remember the exact numbers,

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:51.200
 but, you know, 80% or 70% of their own party

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.040
 and, you know, 50% of the other party.

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:54.680
 And now it's like 40% of their own party

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:56.120
 and 10% of the other party, you know?

1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.360
 It's, and it's not that the presidents are getting worse.

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:00.760
 Maybe some people would argue that they are,

1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:04.000
 but more so, and there's a lot of, you know,

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.720
 idiot presidents throughout the,

1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:08.320
 what's going on is something in the environment is changing.

1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:11.240
 And that's, you're seeing is a change in behavior.

1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:12.840
 A easy example here is that, you know,

1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:14.080
 by a lot of metrics,

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:18.240
 racism is getting, is becoming less and less of a problem.

1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:21.880
 You know, it's hard to measure, but there's metrics like,

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:23.320
 you know, how upset would you be

1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:26.560
 if your kid married someone of another race?

1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:28.040
 And that number is plummeting,

1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:30.840
 but racial grievance is skyrocketing, right?

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.040
 There's a lot of examples like this.

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:33.640
 So I wanted to look around and say,

1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:34.760
 and the reason I took it on,

1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:36.840
 the reason I don't think this is just an unfortunate trend,

1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:38.920
 unpleasant trend that hopefully we come out of,

1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:40.480
 is that all this other stuff I like to write about,

1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:42.000
 all this future stuff, right?

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.760
 And it's this magical, I always think of this,

1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:45.280
 like I'm very optimistic in a lot of ways.

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:48.480
 And I think that our world would be a utopia,

1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:50.160
 would seem like actual heaven.

1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:53.680
 Like whatever Thomas Jefferson was picturing as heaven,

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:55.440
 other than maybe the eternal life aspect,

1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:59.200
 I think that if he came to 2021 US, it would be better.

1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:00.920
 It's cooler than heaven.

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.880
 But we live in a place that's cooler than 1700s heaven.

1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:05.640
 Again, other than the fact that we still die.

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:07.240
 Now, I think the future world

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:09.640
 actually probably would have, quote, eternal life.

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:12.000
 I don't think anyone wants eternal life actually,

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.320
 if people think they do.

1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:14.560
 Eternal is a long time.

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:16.920
 But I think the choice to die when you want,

1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:19.400
 maybe we're uploaded, maybe we can refresh our bodies.

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.240
 I don't know what it is.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.400
 But the point is, I think about that utopia.

1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:25.920
 And I do believe that like, if we don't botch this,

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:27.120
 we'd be heading towards somewhere

1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:30.040
 that would seem like heaven, maybe in our lifetimes.

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.920
 Of course, if things go wrong,

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:34.880
 now think about the trends here.

1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:36.960
 Just like the 20th century would seem like

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:39.680
 some magical utopia to someone from the 16th century.

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:43.880
 But the bad things in the 20th century

1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:46.160
 were kind of the worst things ever

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:48.000
 in terms of just absolute magnitude.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.080
 World War II, the biggest genocides ever.

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:55.080
 You've got maybe climate change,

1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:58.400
 if it is the existential threat that many people think it is.

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.040
 We never had an existential threat on that level before.

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.000
 So the good is getting better and the bad is getting worse.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.400
 And so what I think about the future,

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:10.400
 I think of us as some kind of big, long canoe as a species.

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:14.920
 5 million mile long canoe, each of us sitting in a row.

1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.280
 And we each have one oar,

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:18.520
 and we can paddle on the left side or the right side.

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:21.960
 And what we know is there's a fork up there somewhere.

1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:26.000
 And the river forks, and there's a utopia on one side

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.200
 and a dystopia on the other side.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:28.560
 And I really believe that that's,

1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:30.440
 we're probably not headed for just an okay future.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:32.400
 It's just the way tech is exploding,

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.200
 like it's probably gonna be really good or really bad.

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:35.800
 The question is which side should we be rowing on?

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.720
 We can't see up there, right?

1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:38.560
 But it really matters.

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:39.560
 So I'm writing about all this future stuff

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:40.600
 and I'm saying none of this matters

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.040
 if we're squabbling our way into kind of like

1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:44.380
 a civil war right now.

1:03:44.380 --> 1:03:45.720
 So what's going on?

1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:48.540
 So it's a really important problem to solve.

1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:51.820
 What are your sources of hope in this?

1:03:51.820 --> 1:03:54.880
 So like how do you steer the canoe?

1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:56.280
 One of my big sources of hope,

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:59.840
 and this is I think my answer to what I changed my mind on,

1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:03.640
 is I think I always knew this, but it's easy to forget it.

1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:05.540
 Our primitive brain does not remember this fact,

1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:10.260
 which is that I don't think there are very many bad people.

1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:13.560
 Now, you say bad, are there selfish people?

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:16.340
 Most of us, I think that if you think of people,

1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:21.560
 there's digital languages, ones and zeros.

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:24.040
 And our primitive brain very quickly can get into the land

1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:25.000
 where everyone's a one or a zero.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.880
 Our tribe, we're all ones, we're perfect.

1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:28.760
 I'm perfect, my family is that other family,

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:29.600
 it's that other tribe.

1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:31.760
 There are zeros and then you dehumanize them, right?

1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:33.880
 These people are awful.

1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:36.140
 So zero is not a human place.

1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:37.640
 No one's a zero and no one's a one.

1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.200
 You're dehumanizing yourself.

1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:41.040
 So when we get into this land,

1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:42.640
 I call it political Disney world,

1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.760
 because the Disney movies have good guys.

1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:48.640
 Scar is totally bad and Mufasa is totally good, right?

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.320
 You don't see Mufasa's character flaws.

1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:52.960
 You don't see Scar's upbringing that made him like that,

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:53.800
 that humanizes him.

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:55.520
 No, lionizes him, whatever.

1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.760
 You are.

1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:57.600
 Well done.

1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:01.760
 Mufasa's a one and Scar's a zero, very simple.

1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:03.640
 So political Disney world is a place,

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.640
 it's a psychological place that all of us have been in.

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:08.160
 And it can be religious Disney world,

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:10.960
 it can be national Disney world and the war, whatever it is,

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:13.320
 but it's a place where we fall into this delusion

1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:14.800
 that there are protagonists and antagonists

1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:15.680
 and that's it, right?

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:16.920
 That is not true.

1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:20.880
 We are all 0.5s or maybe 0.6s to 0.4s in that.

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:22.600
 We are also, on one hand,

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:24.400
 I don't think there's that many really great people,

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.160
 frankly, I think if you get into it,

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:27.760
 people are kind of, a lot of people,

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.480
 most of us have, if you get really

1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:31.120
 into our most shameful memories,

1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:32.360
 the things we've done that are worse,

1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:33.400
 the most shameful thoughts,

1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:35.040
 the deep selfishness that some of us have

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:37.080
 in areas we wouldn't want to admit, right?

1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:40.520
 Most of us have a lot of unadmirable stuff, right?

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.440
 On the other hand, if you actually got into,

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.240
 really got into someone else's brain

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:45.320
 and you looked at their upbringing,

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:47.080
 you looked at the trauma that they've experienced

1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:49.600
 and then you looked at the insecurities they have

1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:50.440
 and you look at all their,

1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:53.600
 if you assemble the highlight reel of your worst moments,

1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:55.480
 the meanest things you've ever done,

1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:56.640
 the worst, the most selfish,

1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:58.440
 the times you stole something, whatever,

1:05:58.440 --> 1:05:59.280
 and you just, people are like,

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:00.920
 wow, Lex is an awful person.

1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:01.760
 If you highlighted your,

1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:03.560
 if you did a montage of your best moments,

1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:05.000
 people would say, oh, he's a god, right?

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.760
 But of course, we all have both of those.

1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:11.480
 So, I've started to really try to remind myself

1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:13.680
 that everyone's a 0.5, right?

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:15.880
 And 0.5s are all worthy of criticism

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.720
 and we're all worthy of compassion.

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.840
 And the thing that makes me hopeful

1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:22.640
 is that I really think that there's a bunch of 0.5s

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:24.720
 and 0.5s are good enough

1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:26.480
 that we should be able to create a good society together.

1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:28.040
 There's a lot of love in every human.

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:30.440
 And I think there's more love in humans than hate.

1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:34.360
 I always remember this moment,

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:35.600
 this is a weird anecdote,

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:38.000
 but I'm a Red Sox fan, Boston Red Sox baseball,

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.440
 and Derek Jeter is who we hate the most.

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:41.360
 He's on the Yankees.

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:42.400
 Yes.

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:44.720
 And hate, right?

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:45.840
 Jeter, right?

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:47.960
 He was his last game in Fenway, he's retiring.

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:49.800
 And he got this rousing standing ovation

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:50.960
 and I almost cried.

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.480
 And it was like, what is going on?

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.320
 We hate this guy,

1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.080
 but actually there's so much love in all humans.

1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:58.640
 It felt so good to just give a huge cheer

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.840
 to this guy we hate because it's like this moment

1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:02.280
 of like a little fist pound being like,

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.000
 of course we all actually love each other.

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.200
 And I think there's so much of that.

1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:08.120
 And so the thing that I think I've come around on

1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:11.160
 is I think that we are in an environment

1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:13.280
 that's bringing out really bad stuff.

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.800
 I don't think it's, if I thought it was the people,

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:16.640
 I would be more hopeful.

1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:17.640
 Like if I thought it was human nature,

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:19.720
 I'd be more upset.

1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:23.120
 It's the two independent variables here,

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:24.480
 or that there's a fixed variable.

1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:25.840
 There's a constant, which is human nature.

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:27.680
 And there's the independent variable environment

1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:30.480
 and that it behaviors the dependent variable.

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:32.360
 I like that the thing that I think is bad

1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:34.520
 is the independent variable, the environment,

1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:35.800
 which means I think we can,

1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:36.840
 the environment can get better.

1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:38.040
 And there's a lot of things I can go into

1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:39.800
 about why the environment I think is bad,

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:42.760
 but I have hope because I think the thing that's bad for us

1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:44.480
 is something that can change.

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.520
 The first principles idea here is that most people

1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:51.640
 have the capacity to be a 0.7 to 0.9.

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:56.640
 If the environment is properly calibrated

1:07:56.880 --> 1:07:57.960
 with the right incentives.

1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.160
 I think that, well, I think that maybe if we're all,

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:01.680
 yeah, if we're all 0.5s,

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:05.480
 I think that environments can bring out our good side.

1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:08.880
 Yeah, so maybe we're all on some kind of distribution

1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:11.000
 and the right environment can, yes,

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.720
 can bring out our higher sides.

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:15.080
 And I think a lot of, in a lot of ways you could say it has.

1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.760
 I mean, the U.S. environment,

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:20.880
 we take for granted how the liberal laws

1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:23.000
 and liberal environment that we live in.

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.240
 I mean, like in New York City, right?

1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:29.360
 If you walk down the street and you like assault someone,

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:31.000
 hey, if anyone sees you, they're probably gonna yell at you.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.920
 You might get your ass kicked by someone for doing that.

1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:35.640
 You also might end up in jail, you know,

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:38.040
 if it's security cameras and there's just norms,

1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:38.880
 you know, we're all trained.

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:40.320
 That's what awful people do, right?

1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:42.240
 So there's, it's not the human nature

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.280
 doesn't have it in it to be like that.

1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:47.480
 It's that this environment we're in has made that a much,

1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:50.120
 much, much smaller experience for people.

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.960
 There's so many examples like that where it's like,

1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:54.520
 man, you don't realize how much of the worst human nature

1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:56.200
 is contained by our environment.

1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:58.800
 And, but I think that, you know,

1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:00.240
 rapidly changing environment,

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:02.240
 which is what we have right now, social media starts.

1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:04.680
 I mean, what a seismic change to the environment.

1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:05.760
 There's a lot of examples like that,

1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:06.920
 rapidly changing environment

1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:09.240
 can create rapidly changing behavior

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:11.680
 and wisdom sometimes can't keep up.

1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:15.800
 And so we, you know, we can really kind of lose our grip

1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:17.280
 on some of the good behavior.

1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:21.760
 Were you surprised by Elon's answer about brain transplants

1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:24.480
 or Sam's about nuclear power or anything else?

1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:25.320
 Just...

1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:27.760
 Sam's I think is, I have a friend,

1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:29.800
 Isabel Boumeke who has a,

1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:33.120
 who's a nuclear power, you know, influencer.

1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:34.920
 I've become very convinced

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.960
 and I've not done my deep dive on this.

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.920
 But here's, in this case, this is,

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:41.640
 this is reasoning by analogy here.

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:45.120
 The amount of really smart people I respect

1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:46.920
 who all, who seem to have dug in,

1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:49.960
 who all say nuclear power is clearly a good option.

1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:51.840
 It's obviously emission free, but you know,

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.120
 the concerns about meltdowns and waste,

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.840
 they see that they're completely overblown.

1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:00.240
 So judging from those people, secondary knowledge here,

1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.720
 I will say I'm a strong advocate.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.200
 I haven't done my own deep dive yet,

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.480
 but it does seem like a little bit odd

1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:08.200
 that you've got people

1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:10.400
 who are so concerned about climate change,

1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:15.320
 who have, it seems like it's kind of an ideology

1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:17.160
 where nuclear power doesn't fit

1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:20.320
 rather than rational, you know, fear of climate change

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:22.160
 that somehow is anti nuclear power.

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.160
 It just, yeah.

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:26.600
 I personally am uncomfortably reasoning by analogy

1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:27.920
 with climate change.

1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:29.680
 I've actually have not done a deep dive myself.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.800
 Me neither, because it's so,

1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:33.280
 man, it seems like a deep dive.

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:37.200
 And my reasoning by analogy there

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.600
 currently has me thinking it's a truly existential thing,

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:41.800
 but feeling hopeful.

1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.320
 So let me, this is me speaking

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:45.720
 and this is speaking from a person

1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.160
 who's not done the deep dive.

1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.480
 I'm a little suspicious

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:52.920
 of the amount of fear mongering going on.

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:54.680
 Especially over the past couple of years,

1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:56.600
 I've gotten uncomfortable with fear mongering

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:59.120
 in all walks of life.

1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:01.480
 There's way too many people interested

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:04.200
 in manipulating the populace with fear.

1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.440
 And so I don't like it.

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:06.880
 I should probably do a deep dive

1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:10.600
 because to me it's, well, the big problem

1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:13.120
 with the opposition to climate change

1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.120
 or whatever the fear mongering is

1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:19.720
 that it also grows the skepticism in science broadly.

1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:20.920
 It's like, and that,

1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.440
 so I need to make sure I do that deep dive.

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:25.080
 I have listened to a few folks

1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:27.800
 who kind of criticize the fear mongering

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:29.080
 and all those kinds of things,

1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:30.800
 but they're few and far between.

1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:33.760
 And so it's like, all right, what is the truth here?

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:36.120
 And it feels lazy, but it also feels like

1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:37.400
 it's hard to get to the,

1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.040
 like there's a lot of kind of activists talking about idea,

1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.040
 versus like sources of objective,

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:52.480
 like calm first principles type reasoning.

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:54.120
 Like one of the things,

1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:57.880
 I know it's supposed to be a very big problem,

1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:00.000
 but when people talk about catastrophic effects

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.680
 of climate change,

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.360
 I haven't been able to like see really great deep analysis

1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:09.480
 of what that looks like in 10, 20, 30 years,

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:12.400
 raising rising sea levels.

1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:17.000
 What are the models of how that changes human behavior,

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.280
 society, what are the things that happen?

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:21.640
 There's going to be constraints on the resources

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:23.360
 and people are gonna have to move around.

1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:24.920
 This is happening gradually.

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.720
 Are we gonna be able to respond to this?

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:27.840
 How would we respond to this?

1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:28.920
 What are the best,

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:30.400
 like, what are the best models

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:32.280
 for how everything goes wrong?

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:36.200
 Again, I was, this is a question I keep starting

1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.640
 to ask myself without doing any research,

1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:43.400
 like motivating myself to get up to this deep dive

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:45.040
 that I feel is deep,

1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:47.200
 just watching people not do a great job

1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:49.480
 with that kind of modeling with the pandemic

1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:52.640
 and sort of being caught off guard and wondering,

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:55.120
 okay, if we're not good with this pandemic,

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:57.560
 how are we going to respond to other kinds of tragedies?

1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.400
 Well, this is part of why I wrote the book.

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:04.200
 Cause I said, we're going to have more and more of these,

1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:08.160
 like big collective, what should we do here situations?

1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:09.680
 Whether it's, how about when, you know,

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:10.720
 we're probably not that far away

1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:14.480
 from people being able to go and decide the IQ of their kid

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.920
 or like, you know, make a bunch of embryos

1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.640
 and actually pick the highest IQ.

1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:19.960
 Can possibly go wrong.

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:20.800
 Yeah.

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:22.960
 And also like, imagine the political sides of that

1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:25.160
 and like something that only wealthy people can afford at

1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:27.320
 first and just the nightmare, right?

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:29.600
 We need to be able to have our wits about us as a species

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:32.840
 where we can actually get into a topic like that

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.680
 and come up with where the collective brain can be smart.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:39.360
 I think that there are certain topics

1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:41.240
 where I think of this and this is again,

1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.080
 another simplistic model, but I think it works

1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:45.200
 is that there's a higher mind and a primitive mind, right?

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.200
 You can, you know, in your head

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:48.880
 and these team up with others.

1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:50.800
 So when the higher minds are in a higher mind

1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.960
 is more rational and puts out ideas

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.000
 that it's not attached to.

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.400
 And so it can change its mind easily

1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:58.440
 cause it's just an idea and the higher mind

1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:00.360
 can get criticized.

1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.840
 Their ideas can get criticized and it's no big deal.

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:05.000
 And so when the higher minds team up,

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.440
 it's like all these people in the room,

1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:07.880
 like throwing out ideas and kicking them

1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:10.000
 and one idea goes out and everyone criticizes it,

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.760
 which is like, you know, shooting bows and arrows at it.

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:13.960
 And the truth, the true idea is, you know,

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:16.000
 the bow, the arrows bounce off and it's so, okay,

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.280
 it rises up and the other ones get shot down.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:19.520
 So it's this incredible system.

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.360
 This is what, you know,

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.480
 this is what good science institution is,

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:24.000
 is, you know, someone puts out a thing,

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.240
 criticism arrows come at it and, you know,

1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.000
 most of them fall and the needle is in the haystack

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.040
 end up rising up, right?

1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:30.920
 Incredible mechanism.

1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:32.480
 So what that's happening is a bunch of people,

1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:34.760
 a bunch of flawed medium scientists

1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:36.480
 are creating super intelligence.

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.440
 Then there's the primitive mind,

1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:44.120
 which, you know, is the more limbic system part of our brain.

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:48.680
 It's the part of us that is very much not living in 2021.

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:51.280
 It's living many tens of thousands of years ago.

1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:54.240
 And it does not treat ideas like this separate thing.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:56.320
 It identifies with its ideas.

1:14:56.320 --> 1:14:59.880
 It only gets involved when it finds an idea sacred.

1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:02.040
 It starts holding an idea sacred and it starts identifying.

1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.280
 So what happens is they team up too.

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:08.280
 And so when you have a topic that a bunch of primitive,

1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:10.480
 that really rouses a bunch of primitive minds,

1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:14.880
 it quickly, the primitive minds team up

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:16.600
 and they create an echo chamber

1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:18.400
 where suddenly no one can criticize this.

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.640
 And in fact, if it's powerful enough,

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:22.040
 people outside the community, you can,

1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:22.880
 no one can criticize it.

1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:23.960
 We will get your paper retracted.

1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:25.760
 We will get you fired, right?

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:27.040
 That's not higher mind behavior.

1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:28.520
 That is crazy primitive mind.

1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:30.520
 And so now what happens is the collective

1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.560
 becomes dumber than an individual,

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:34.880
 a dumber than a reason, a single reasoning individual.

1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:37.040
 You have this collective is suddenly attached

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:40.720
 to this sacred scripture with the idea

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:43.160
 and they will not change their mind

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:44.240
 and they get dumber and dumber.

1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:47.240
 And so climate change, what's worrisome

1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:49.480
 is that climate change has in many ways

1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:50.920
 become a sacred topic,

1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:52.520
 where if you come up with a nuanced thing,

1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.600
 you might get called branded a denier.

1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:57.640
 So there goes the super intelligence,

1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:59.480
 all the arrows, no arrows can be fired.

1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:01.000
 But if you get called a denier,

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.440
 that's a social penalty for firing an arrow

1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:05.080
 at a certain orthodoxy, right?

1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:06.880
 And so what's happening is the big brain

1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:08.000
 gets like frozen, right?

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:08.880
 And it becomes very stupid.

1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:10.520
 Now, you can also say that

1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:12.560
 about a lot of other topics right now.

1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:16.560
 You just mentioned another one, I forget what it was,

1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:19.000
 but that's also kind of like this.

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.280
 The world of vaccine.

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:21.520
 Yeah, yeah, COVID, okay.

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.360
 And here's my point earlier is that

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.760
 what I see is that the political divide

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:28.320
 has like a whirlpool that's pulling everything into it.

1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:32.000
 And in that whirlpool, thinking is done

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.880
 with the primitive mind tribes.

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:38.520
 And so I get, okay, obviously something like race,

1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:40.240
 that makes sense, that also right now,

1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:42.160
 the topic of race, for example, or gender,

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:43.840
 these things are in the whirlpool.

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:45.680
 But that at least is like, okay,

1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:47.080
 that's something that the primitive mind

1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:49.160
 would always get really worked up about.

1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:52.280
 It taps into like our deepest kind of like primal selves.

1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:56.080
 COVID, maybe it's COVID in a way too,

1:16:56.080 --> 1:16:57.920
 but climate change, that should just be something

1:16:57.920 --> 1:16:58.880
 that our rational brains are like,

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:00.360
 let's solve this complex problem.

1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:02.360
 But the problem is that it's all gotten sucked

1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.280
 into the red versus blue whirlpool.

1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:05.120
 And once that happens,

1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:06.320
 it's in the hands of the primitive minds.

1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:09.160
 And we're losing our ability to be wise together,

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:10.680
 to make decisions.

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:13.360
 It's like the big species brain is like,

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:15.200
 or the big American brain is like,

1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:16.760
 drunk at the wheel right now.

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.160
 And we're about to go into our future

1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:21.120
 with more and more big technologies,

1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:23.160
 scary things, we have to make big right decisions.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.040
 And not, we're getting dumber as a collective.

1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:28.400
 And that's part of this environmental problem.

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:30.320
 So within the space of technologists

1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:33.280
 and the space of scientists, we should allow the arrows.

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:35.040
 That's one of the saddest things to me about,

1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:39.960
 is like the scientists, like I've seen arrogance.

1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:42.440
 There's a lot of mechanisms that maintain the tribe.

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:46.520
 It's the arrogance, it's how you built up this mechanism

1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:50.080
 that defends, this wall that defends against the arrows.

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:54.280
 It's arrogance, credentialism,

1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:58.200
 like just ego, really.

1:17:58.200 --> 1:17:59.560
 And then just, it protects you

1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:01.960
 from actually challenging your own ideas.

1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:05.640
 This ideal of science that makes science beautiful.

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.600
 In a time of fear, and in a time of division

1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:12.880
 created by perhaps politicians that leverage the fear,

1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:16.200
 it, like you said, makes the whole system dumber.

1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:17.840
 The science system dumber,

1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:22.680
 the tech developer system dumber,

1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:24.840
 if they don't allow the challenging of ideas.

1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.320
 What's really bad is that like,

1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:28.600
 in a normal environment,

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:30.560
 you're always gonna have echo chambers.

1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:32.320
 So what's the opposite of an echo chamber?

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:34.120
 I created a term for it, because I think we need it,

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:36.520
 which is called an idea lab, an idea lab, right?

1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:38.920
 It's like people treat, it's like people act like scientists,

1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:40.440
 even if they're not doing science,

1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:43.400
 they just treat their ideas like science experiments

1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:45.320
 and they toss them out there and everyone disagrees.

1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:46.880
 And disagreement is like the game.

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:48.360
 Everyone likes to disagree.

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:50.880
 Certain texts thread where everyone is just saying,

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.240
 it's almost like someone throws something out

1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:54.120
 and just it's an impulse for the rest of the group to say,

1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.600
 I think you're being like overly general there.

1:18:56.600 --> 1:18:58.320
 Or I think like, aren't you kind of being,

1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:00.160
 I think that's like your bias showing.

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:01.560
 And it's like, no one's getting offended

1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:02.760
 because it's like, we're all just messing,

1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:04.840
 we all of course respect each other, obviously.

1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:08.440
 We're just, you know, trashing each other's ideas

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:10.600
 and that the whole group becomes smarter.

1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:12.600
 You're always gonna have idea labs and echo chambers,

1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:13.520
 right, in different communities.

1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:15.640
 And most of us participate in both of them.

1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:18.000
 You know, maybe in your marriage is a great idea lab,

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.800
 you love to disagree with your spouse and maybe in,

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:23.000
 but this group of friends or your family at home,

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:24.400
 you know, in front of that sister,

1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:25.600
 you do not bring up politics

1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:27.520
 because she's now enforced when that happens,

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:30.240
 her bullying is forcing the whole room

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.840
 to be an echo chamber to appease her.

1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:35.280
 Now, what scares me is that usually have these things

1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:36.880
 existing kind of in bubbles.

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:39.000
 And usually there's like an age

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.560
 have their natural defenses against each other.

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:44.200
 So an echo chamber person stays in their echo chamber.

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:45.680
 They don't like, they will cut you out.

1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:47.240
 They don't like to be friends with people

1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:48.080
 who disagree with them.

1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:49.120
 You notice that they will cut you out.

1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:50.200
 They'll cut out their parents

1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:51.560
 if they voted for Trump or whatever, right?

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:54.400
 So that's how they do it.

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:56.000
 They will say, I'm going to stay inside

1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:57.120
 of an echo chamber safely.

1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.280
 So my ideas, which I identify with

1:20:00.680 --> 1:20:02.400
 because my primitive mind is doing the thinking

1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:04.040
 are not going to ever have to get challenged

1:20:04.040 --> 1:20:07.320
 because it feels so scary and awful for that to happen.

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.560
 But if they leave and they go into an idea lab environment,

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:10.640
 they're going to, people are going to say, what?

1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:11.760
 No, they're going to disagree.

1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:12.600
 And they're going to say,

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:13.680
 and the person's going to try to bully them.

1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:15.600
 They're going to say, that's really offensive.

1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:16.520
 And people are going to say, no, it's not.

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:17.920
 And they're going to immediately say

1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:19.120
 these people are assholes, right?

1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:21.840
 So the echo chamber person,

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.600
 it doesn't have much power once they leave the echo chamber.

1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:26.120
 Likewise, the idea lab person,

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:27.240
 they have this great environment,

1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:28.560
 but if they go into an echo chamber

1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:29.960
 where everyone else is, and they do that,

1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:30.960
 they will get kicked out of the group.

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.440
 They will get branded as something,

1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:36.640
 a denier, a racist, a right winger, a radical,

1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:38.200
 these nasty words.

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:41.400
 The thing that I don't like right now

1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:44.720
 is that the echo chambers have found ways

1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:48.400
 to forcefully expand into places

1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:51.240
 that normally have a pretty good immune system

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:53.440
 against echo chambers, like universities,

1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:54.960
 like science journals,

1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:56.240
 places where usually it's like,

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:59.000
 there's a strong idea lab culture there, veritas.

1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.680
 You know, that's an idea lab slogan.

1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:06.120
 You have is that these people have found a way to,

1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:07.840
 a lot of people have found a way

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:09.000
 to actually go out of their thing

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.160
 and keep their echo chamber

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:11.920
 by making sure that everyone is scared

1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:13.000
 because they can punish anyone,

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000
 whether you're in their community or not.

1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:19.120
 So that's all brilliantly put.

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:20.720
 When's the book coming out?

1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:21.560
 Any idea?

1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:24.000
 June, July, we're not quite sure yet.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.360
 Okay, I can't wait.

1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:26.360
 Thanks. It's awesome.

1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:28.160
 Do you have a title yet or you can't talk about that?

1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:29.000
 Still working on it.

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.520
 Okay.

1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:32.920
 If it's okay, just a couple of questions from Mailbag.

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:34.280
 I just love these.

1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:37.440
 I would love to hear you riff on these.

1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:39.560
 So one is about film and music.

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:41.960
 Why do we prefer to watch, the question goes,

1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:43.800
 why do we prefer to watch a film

1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:45.560
 we haven't watched before,

1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:47.560
 but we want to listen to songs

1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:50.080
 that we have heard hundreds of times?

1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:51.840
 This question and your answer

1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:53.280
 really started to make me think like,

1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:54.440
 yeah, that's true.

1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:55.760
 That's really interesting.

1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:59.080
 Like we draw that line somehow.

1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:00.240
 So what's the answer?

1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.720
 So I think, let's use these two minds again.

1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:04.440
 I think that when your higher mind

1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.160
 is the one who's taking something in

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:07.400
 and they're really interested in,

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:08.760
 what are the lyrics or I'm gonna learn something

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.480
 or reading a book or whatever.

1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:15.840
 And the higher mind is trying to get information.

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:16.680
 And once it has it,

1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:17.920
 there's no point in listening to it again.

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:19.040
 It has the information.

1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:21.920
 Your rational brain is like, I got it.

1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:27.440
 But when you eat a good meal or have sex or whatever,

1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:28.800
 that's something you can do again and again,

1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:32.720
 because it actually, your primitive brain loves it.

1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:35.360
 And it never gets bored of things that it loves.

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.120
 So I think music is a very primal thing.

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:40.480
 I think music goes right into our primitive brain.

1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:43.880
 A lot, I think it's of course, it's a collaboration.

1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:47.480
 Your rational brain is absorbing the actual message.

1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:48.920
 But I think it's all about emotions

1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:50.040
 and even more than emotions,

1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.400
 it literally like the music taps into like some very,

1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:58.400
 very deep, primal part of us.

1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:02.040
 And so when you hear a song once,

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:03.240
 even some of your favorite songs,

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:04.080
 the first time you heard it,

1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:05.840
 you were like, I guess that's kind of catchy.

1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:07.320
 Yeah.

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:10.200
 And then you end up loving it on the 10th listen.

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:11.560
 But sometimes you even don't even like a song.

1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:12.480
 You're like, oh, this song sucks.

1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:15.200
 But suddenly you find yourself on the 40th time

1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:16.200
 because it's on the radio all the time,

1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:17.360
 just kind of being like, oh, I love this song.

1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:19.640
 And you're like, wait, I hated the song.

1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:23.000
 And what's happening is that the sound is actually,

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.160
 the music's actually carving a pathway in your brain

1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:29.120
 and it's a dance.

1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:30.920
 And when your brain knows what's coming,

1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:33.040
 it can dance, it knows the steps.

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:35.720
 So your brain is your internal kind of,

1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:37.520
 your brain is actually dancing with the music

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:40.360
 and it knows the steps and it can anticipate.

1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:45.040
 And so there's something about knowing,

1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:46.120
 having memorized the song

1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:48.920
 that makes it incredibly enjoyable to us.

1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:49.960
 But when we hear it for the first time,

1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:50.800
 we don't know where it's gonna go.

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:51.640
 We're like an awkward dancer.

1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:53.360
 We don't know the steps and your primitive brain

1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:55.280
 can't really have that much fun yet.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:56.120
 That's how I feel.

1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:59.800
 And in the movies, that's less primitive.

1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:03.640
 That's the story you're taking in.

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:05.680
 But a really good movie that we really love,

1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:07.600
 often we will watch it like 12 times.

1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:09.200
 It's still like it, not that many,

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:11.880
 but versus if you're watching a talk show, right?

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:14.160
 If you're listening to one of your podcasts,

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:15.280
 as a perfect example,

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:16.320
 there's not many people that will listen

1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:17.720
 to one of your podcasts,

1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:19.040
 no matter how good it is, 12 times.

1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:21.360
 Because once you've got it, you've got it.

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:25.320
 It's a form of information that's very higher mind focused.

1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:26.160
 That's how I read it.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:28.760
 Well, the funny thing is there is people

1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:32.200
 that listen to a podcast episode many, many times.

1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:33.960
 And often I think the reason for that

1:24:33.960 --> 1:24:36.120
 is not because of the information, is the chemistry,

1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:38.080
 is the music of the conversation.

1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:38.920
 So it's not the actual.

1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:40.280
 It's the art of it they like.

1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:42.360
 Yeah, they'll fall in love with some kind of person,

1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:45.320
 some weird personality, and they'll just be listening to,

1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:47.800
 they'll be captivated by the beat of that kind of person.

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:48.640
 Or like a standup comic.

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:49.720
 I've watched like certain things,

1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:52.320
 like episodes like 20 times, even though I, you know.

1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:56.440
 I have to ask you about the wizard hat.

1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:58.080
 You had a blog about Neuralink.

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:00.520
 I got a chance to visit Neuralink a couple of times,

1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:05.520
 hanging out with those folks, that was one of the pieces

1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:09.280
 of writing you did that like changes culture

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:12.040
 and changes the way people think about a thing.

1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:15.880
 The ridiculousness of your stick figure drawings

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:20.880
 are somehow, it's like calling the origin

1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:23.320
 of the universe the Big Bang.

1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:25.840
 It's a silly title, but it somehow sticks

1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:28.960
 to be the representative of that.

1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:31.000
 And the same way the wizard hat for the Neuralink

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.480
 is somehow it was a really powerful way to explain that.

1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:37.800
 You actually proposed that the man of the year

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:39.760
 cover of Time should be.

1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:40.600
 One of my drawings.

1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:41.440
 One of your drawings.

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:42.280
 Yes, yes.

1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:43.280
 It's an outrage that it wasn't.

1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:44.200
 It wasn't.

1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.080
 Okay, so what are your thoughts about like all those years

1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:50.760
 later about Neuralink?

1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:54.280
 Do you find this idea, like what excites you about it?

1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:56.880
 Is it the big long term philosophical things?

1:25:56.880 --> 1:25:58.360
 Is it the practical things?

1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:00.560
 Do you think it's super difficult to do

1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.120
 on the neurosurgery side

1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:05.120
 and the material engineering, the robotics side?

1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:08.200
 Or do you think the machine learning side

1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:09.520
 for the brain computer interfaces

1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.240
 where they get to learn about each other,

1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:12.080
 all that kind of stuff.

1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:13.320
 I would just love to get your thoughts

1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:14.280
 because you're one of the people

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.060
 that really considered this problem,

1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:19.640
 really studied it, brain computer interfaces.

1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:21.760
 I mean, I'm super excited about it.

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:24.800
 It's a, I really think it's actually

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:27.400
 Elon's most ambitious thing.

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:28.720
 More than colonizing Mars

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:31.160
 because that's just a bunch of people going somewhere,

1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:33.160
 even though it's somewhere far.

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:37.680
 Neuralink is changing what a person is eventually.

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:42.420
 Now, I think that Neuralink engineers and Elon himself

1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:45.120
 would all be the first to admit that it is a maybe

1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:46.920
 that whether they can do their goals here.

1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:50.320
 I mean, it is so crazy ambitious to try to,

1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:52.280
 even their eventual goals are,

1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.960
 of course in the interim,

1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:55.120
 they have a higher probability

1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:56.200
 of accomplishing smaller things,

1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:59.660
 which are still huge, like basically solving paralysis,

1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:02.640
 strokes, Parkinson, things like that.

1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:03.960
 I mean, it can be unbelievable.

1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:06.360
 And anyone who doesn't have one of these things,

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:08.880
 like we might, everyone should be very happy

1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.760
 about this kind of helping with different disabilities.

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.140
 But the thing that is like,

1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:21.480
 so the grand goal is this augmentation

1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:23.600
 where you take someone who's totally healthy

1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:26.240
 and you put a brain machine interface in any way

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:27.720
 to give them superpowers.

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:32.280
 It's the possibilities if they can do this,

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:33.120
 if they can really,

1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:36.520
 so they've already shown that they are for real,

1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:38.600
 but they've created this robot.

1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:40.700
 Elon talks about like, it should be like LASIK,

1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:42.040
 where it's not,

1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:44.240
 it shouldn't be something that needs a surgeon.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:46.520
 This shouldn't just be for rich people

1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.220
 who have waited in line for six months.

1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:50.280
 It should be for anyone who can afford LASIK

1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:53.160
 and eventually, hopefully something that isn't covered by

1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:56.320
 insurance or something that anyone can do.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:57.760
 Something this big a deal should be something

1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:00.200
 that anyone can afford eventually.

1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:03.160
 And when we have this, again,

1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:05.720
 I'm talking about a very advanced phase down the road.

1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:07.600
 So maybe a less advanced phase,

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.000
 just maybe right now,

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.260
 if you think about when you listen to a song,

1:28:13.260 --> 1:28:16.760
 what's happening, is you actually hear the sound?

1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:18.600
 Well, not really.

1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:22.260
 It's that the sound is coming out of the speaker.

1:28:22.260 --> 1:28:23.520
 The speaker is vibrating.

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:25.080
 It's vibrating air molecules.

1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:26.800
 Those air molecules, you know,

1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.740
 get vibrated all the way to your head pressure wave.

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:34.500
 And then it vibrates your eardrum.

1:28:34.500 --> 1:28:37.060
 Your eardrum is really the speaker now in your head

1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:40.320
 that then vibrates bones and fluid,

1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:44.840
 which then stimulates neurons in your auditory cortex,

1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:49.800
 which give you the perception that you're hearing sound.

1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:52.240
 Now, if you think about that,

1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.120
 do we really need to have a speaker to do that?

1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:56.080
 You could just somehow,

1:28:56.080 --> 1:28:56.920
 if you had a little tiny thing

1:28:56.920 --> 1:28:57.960
 that could vibrate eardrums,

1:28:57.960 --> 1:28:59.280
 you could do it that way.

1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:00.880
 That seems very hard.

1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.160
 But really what you need,

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:03.240
 if you go to the very end

1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:05.000
 with a thing that really needs to happen,

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.080
 is your auditory cortex neurons

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:09.640
 need to be stimulated in a certain way.

1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:11.920
 If you have a ton of Neuralink things in there,

1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:13.320
 Neuralink electrodes,

1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:15.920
 and they get really good at stimulating things,

1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:17.680
 you could play a song in your head

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:20.520
 that you hear that is not playing anywhere.

1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:21.920
 There's no sound in the room,

1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:23.720
 but you hear and no one else could.

1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.280
 It's not like they can get close to your head and hear it.

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:26.120
 There's no sound.

1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:27.200
 They could not hear anything,

1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:28.360
 but you hear sound.

1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:29.180
 You can turn up.

1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:30.140
 So you open your phone,

1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:31.320
 you have the Neuralink app.

1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:32.640
 You open the Neuralink app,

1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:34.080
 and or just Neuralink.

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:35.600
 So basically you can open your Spotify

1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:38.800
 and you can play to your speaker,

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:39.680
 you can play to your computer,

1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:41.240
 you can play right out of your phone to your headphones,

1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.400
 or you can have a new one.

1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:44.680
 You can play into your brain.

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:47.160
 And this is one of the earlier things.

1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:49.820
 This is something that seems like really doable.

1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:52.280
 So no more headphones.

1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:53.300
 I always think it's so annoying

1:29:53.300 --> 1:29:55.840
 because I can leave the house with just my phone

1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:57.600
 and nothing else,

1:29:57.600 --> 1:29:58.440
 or even just an Apple watch.

1:29:58.440 --> 1:29:59.280
 But there's always this one thing,

1:29:59.280 --> 1:30:00.120
 I'm like, and headphones.

1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:01.440
 You do need your headphones, right?

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:03.100
 So I feel like that'll be the end of that.

1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:04.600
 But there's so many things that you,

1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:06.260
 and you keep going,

1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:08.560
 the ability to think together.

1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:10.320
 You can talk about like super brains.

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:12.760
 I mean, one of the examples Elon uses

1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:16.040
 is that the low bandwidth of speech.

1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:19.340
 If I go to a movie and I come out of a scary movie

1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:20.180
 and you say, how was it?

1:30:20.180 --> 1:30:21.160
 I said, oh, it was terrifying.

1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:22.960
 Well, what did I just do?

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:24.520
 I just gave you,

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:26.440
 I had five buckets I could have given you.

1:30:26.440 --> 1:30:29.480
 One was horrifying, terrifying, scary, eerie, creepy,

1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:30.640
 whatever.

1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:31.880
 That's about it.

1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:36.240
 And I had a much more nuanced experience than that.

1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:39.560
 And all I have is these words, right?

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.920
 And so instead I just hand you the bucket.

1:30:41.920 --> 1:30:44.160
 I put the stuff in the bucket and give it to you,

1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:45.440
 but all you have is the bucket.

1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:47.720
 You just have to guess what I put into that bucket.

1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:50.480
 All you can do is look at the label of the bucket and say,

1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:52.860
 when I say terrifying, here's what I mean.

1:30:52.860 --> 1:30:55.120
 So the point is it's very lossy.

1:30:55.120 --> 1:30:57.300
 I had all this nuanced information

1:30:57.300 --> 1:30:58.140
 of what I thought of the movie.

1:30:58.140 --> 1:31:00.680
 And I'm sending you a very low res package

1:31:00.680 --> 1:31:02.000
 that you're gonna now guess

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.060
 what the high res thing looked like.

1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:05.680
 That's language in general.

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:07.140
 Our thoughts are much more nuanced.

1:31:07.140 --> 1:31:08.760
 We can think to each other.

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:09.720
 We can do amazing things.

1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:11.600
 We could A, have a brainstorm that doesn't feel like,

1:31:11.600 --> 1:31:13.080
 oh, we're not talking in each other's heads.

1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:14.480
 Not just that I hear your voice.

1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:15.760
 No, no, no, we are just thinking.

1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:18.900
 No words are being said internally or externally.

1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.680
 The two brains are literally collaborating.

1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:22.520
 It's something, it's a skill.

1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:23.360
 I'm sure we'd have to get good at it.

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:25.080
 I'm sure young kids will be great at it

1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:26.480
 and old people will be bad.

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:28.440
 But you think together and together you're like,

1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:29.600
 oh, had the joint epiphany.

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:31.760
 And now how about eight people in a room doing it, right?

1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:34.040
 So it gets, you know, there's other examples.

1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:37.540
 How about when you're a dress designer or a bridge designer

1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:40.760
 and you want to show people what your dress looks like.

1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:42.480
 Well, right now you gotta sketch it for a long time.

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:44.320
 Here, just beam it onto the screen from your head.

1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:45.160
 So you can picture it.

1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:47.400
 If, you know, if you can picture a tree in your head,

1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:48.840
 well, you can just suddenly,

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:50.080
 whatever's in your head, you can be pictured.

1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:52.000
 So we'll have to get very good at it, right?

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:52.920
 And take a skill, right?

1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:54.240
 You know, you're gonna have to,

1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:56.240
 but the possibilities, my God.

1:31:56.240 --> 1:31:58.960
 Talk about like, I feel like if that works,

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.440
 if we really do have that as something,

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:04.280
 I think it'll almost be like a new ADBC line.

1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:07.280
 It's such a big change that the idea of like anyone living

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:09.320
 before everyone had brain machine interfaces

1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:12.820
 is living in like before the common era.

1:32:12.820 --> 1:32:16.080
 It's that level of like big change if it can work.

1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:18.000
 Yeah, and like a replay of memories,

1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:19.360
 just replaying stuff in your head.

1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:20.640
 Oh my God, yeah.

1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:23.040
 And copying, you know, you can hopefully copy memories

1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.240
 onto other things and you don't have to just rely on your,

1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:27.920
 you know, your wet circuitry.

1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:29.640
 It does make me sad because you're right.

1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:32.080
 The brain is incredibly neuroplastic

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:34.620
 and so it can adjust, it can learn how to do this.

1:32:34.620 --> 1:32:36.080
 I think it'll be a skill.

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:38.440
 Or probably you and I will be too old to truly learn.

1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:40.400
 Well, maybe we can get, there'll be great trainings.

1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:42.040
 You know, I'm spending the next three months

1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:44.880
 in like a, you know, one of the Neuralink trainings.

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:47.560
 But it'll still be a bit of like grandpa, I can't.

1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:48.400
 Definitely.

1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:49.220
 This is, you know, I was thinking,

1:32:49.220 --> 1:32:50.060
 how am I gonna be old?

1:32:50.060 --> 1:32:51.520
 I'm like, no, I'm gonna be great at the new phones.

1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:53.020
 It's like, how can it be the phones?

1:32:53.020 --> 1:32:54.360
 It's gonna be that, you know,

1:32:54.360 --> 1:32:55.480
 the kid's gonna be thinking to me.

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.000
 I'm gonna be like, I just, can you just talk please?

1:32:58.000 --> 1:32:59.480
 And they're gonna be like, okay, I'll just talk.

1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:02.280
 And they're gonna, so that'll be the equivalent of,

1:33:02.280 --> 1:33:04.400
 you know, yelling to your grandparents today.

1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:06.840
 I really suspect, I don't know what your thoughts are,

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:11.080
 but I grew up in a time when physical contact interaction

1:33:11.080 --> 1:33:12.120
 was valuable.

1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:15.640
 I just feel like that's going to go the way

1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:17.080
 that's gonna disappear.

1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:17.920
 What, why?

1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:19.120
 I mean, is there anything more intimate

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.200
 than thinking with each other?

1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:21.480
 I mean, that's, you talk about, you know,

1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:23.080
 once we were all doing that, it might feel like, man,

1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:24.840
 everyone was so isolated from each other so far.

1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:25.680
 Yeah, sorry.

1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:27.560
 So I didn't say that intimacy disappears.

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:29.580
 I just meant physical, having to be in the same,

1:33:29.580 --> 1:33:31.600
 having to touch each other.

1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:34.840
 If people like that, if it is important,

1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:36.960
 won't there be whole waves of people start to say,

1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:38.200
 you know, there's all these articles that come out

1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:39.860
 about how, you know, in our metaverse,

1:33:39.860 --> 1:33:42.320
 we've lost something important and then now there's a huge,

1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:43.600
 all first the hippies start doing it

1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:44.940
 and then eventually it becomes this big wave

1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:46.800
 and now everyone, won't, you know,

1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:49.600
 if something truly is lost, won't we recover it?

1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:51.640
 Well, I think from first principles,

1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:54.680
 all of the components are there to engineer

1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:59.680
 intimate experiences in the metaverse or in the cyberspace.

1:34:00.140 --> 1:34:05.140
 And so to me, I don't see anything profoundly unique

1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:08.160
 to the physical experience.

1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:09.240
 Like I don't understand.

1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:12.240
 But then why are you saying there's a loss there?

1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:13.680
 No, I'm just sad because I won't,

1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:16.240
 oh, it's a loss for me personally, because the world.

1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:17.380
 So then you do think there's something unique

1:34:17.380 --> 1:34:18.400
 in the physical experience.

1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:20.320
 For me, because I was raised with it.

1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:21.160
 Oh.

1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:21.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:34:21.980 --> 1:34:24.240
 So whatever, so anything you're raised with,

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:25.080
 you fall in love with.

1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:27.360
 Like people in this country came up with baseball.

1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:29.240
 I was raised in the Soviet Union.

1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:30.440
 I don't understand baseball.

1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:32.740
 I get, I like it, but I don't love it

1:34:32.740 --> 1:34:34.460
 the way Americans love it.

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.840
 Because a lot of times they went to baseball games

1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:41.720
 with their father and then there's that family connection.

1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.160
 There's a young kid dreaming about, I don't know,

1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:49.880
 becoming an MLB player himself.

1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:50.820
 I don't know, something like that.

1:34:50.820 --> 1:34:52.760
 But that's what you're raised with,

1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:53.800
 obviously is really important.

1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:57.320
 But I mean, fundamentally to the human experience,

1:34:57.320 --> 1:34:58.960
 listen, we're doing this podcast in person.

1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:01.840
 So clearly I still value it, but.

1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:02.680
 But it's true.

1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:04.080
 If this were, obviously through a screen,

1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:05.320
 we all agree that's not the same.

1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:06.160
 Yeah, it's not the same.

1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:08.280
 But if this were some, we had contact lenses on

1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:11.840
 and maybe Neuralink, maybe again, forget,

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:13.800
 again, this is all the devices,

1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:15.280
 even if it's just cool as a contact lens,

1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:16.800
 that's all old school.

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:18.640
 Once you have the brain machine interface,

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.880
 it'll just be projection of,

1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.340
 it'll take over my visual cortex.

1:35:22.340 --> 1:35:25.200
 My visual cortex will get put into a virtual room

1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:26.020
 and so will yours.

1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:29.160
 So we will see, we will hear, really hear and see

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.400
 as if where you won't have any masks, no VR mask needed.

1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:35.040
 And at that point, it really will feel like you'll forget.

1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:37.440
 You'll say, will we together and physically or not?

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:38.280
 You won't even,

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:40.200
 it'd be so unimportant you won't even remember.

1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:41.020
 And you're right.

1:35:41.020 --> 1:35:45.040
 This is one of those shifts in society

1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:46.720
 that changes everything.

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:50.120
 Romantically, people still need to be together.

1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:52.640
 There's a whole set of like physical things

1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:55.520
 with a relationship that are needed.

1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:56.360
 You know, like.

1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:57.180
 Like what?

1:35:57.180 --> 1:35:58.020
 Like sex?

1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:00.140
 Sex, but also just like there's pheromones.

1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.160
 Like there's the physical touch is such a,

1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:04.000
 that's like music.

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.440
 It goes to such a deeply primitive part of us

1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:09.780
 that what physical touch with a romantic partner does,

1:36:09.780 --> 1:36:11.160
 that I think that,

1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:13.800
 so I'm sure there'll be a whole wave of people who,

1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:14.880
 their new thing is that, you know,

1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:16.180
 you're romantically involved people

1:36:16.180 --> 1:36:17.440
 you never actually are in person with,

1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:18.920
 but, and I'm sure there'll be things

1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:20.360
 where you can actually smell what's in the room

1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:21.200
 and you can.

1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:22.040
 Yeah, and touch.

1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:24.320
 Yeah, but I think that'll be one of the last things to go.

1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.840
 I think there'll be, there's something,

1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:29.840
 that to me seems like something that'll be a while

1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:32.020
 before people feel like there's nothing lost

1:36:32.020 --> 1:36:33.760
 by not being in the same.

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.840
 It's very difficult to replicate the human interaction.

1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:37.200
 Although sex also, again,

1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:39.740
 you could not to get too like weird,

1:36:39.740 --> 1:36:41.320
 but you could have a thing where you,

1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:44.520
 you're basically, you know, or, you know,

1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:46.840
 let's just do a massage because it's less like awkward,

1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:48.480
 but like someone, you know,

1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:49.960
 everyone is still imagining sex.

1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:50.800
 So go on.

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:54.720
 A masseuse could massage a fake body

1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:57.000
 and you could feel whatever's happening, right?

1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.960
 So you're lying down in your apartment alone,

1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.200
 but you're feeling a full.

1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:02.880
 There'll be the new like YouTube or like streaming

1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:05.040
 where it's one masseuse massaging one body,

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:06.720
 but like a thousand people are experiencing.

1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:07.540
 Exactly right now.

1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:08.380
 Think about it right now.

1:37:08.380 --> 1:37:10.680
 You know what, Taylor Swift doesn't play for one person

1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:12.320
 and has to go around and every one of her fans

1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:14.620
 she has to go play for or a book, right?

1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:15.760
 You do it and it goes everywhere.

1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:17.160
 So it'll be the same idea.

1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:21.720
 You've written and thought a lot about AI.

1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.040
 So AI safety specifically,

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.420
 you've mentioned you're actually starting a podcast,

1:37:27.420 --> 1:37:28.360
 which is awesome.

1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:30.540
 You're so good at talking, so good at thinking,

1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:33.940
 so good at being weird in the most beautiful of ways,

1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:38.580
 but you've been thinking about this AI safety question.

1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:41.620
 Where today does your concern lie

1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:43.840
 for the near future, for the longterm future?

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:46.540
 Like quite a bit of stuff happened,

1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:48.600
 including with Elon's work with Tesla Autopilot.

1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:52.100
 There's a bunch of amazing robots with Boston Dynamics

1:37:52.100 --> 1:37:57.100
 and everyone's favorite vacuum robot, iRobot, Roomba.

1:37:57.380 --> 1:37:59.300
 And then there's obviously the applications

1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:01.840
 of machine learning for recommender systems

1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:04.380
 in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.

1:38:04.380 --> 1:38:07.780
 And face recognition for surveillance,

1:38:07.780 --> 1:38:09.140
 all these kinds of things are happening.

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:12.580
 Just a lot of incredible use of not the face recognition,

1:38:12.580 --> 1:38:15.300
 but the incredible use of deep learning,

1:38:15.300 --> 1:38:19.340
 machine learning to capture information about people

1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:24.180
 and try to recommend to them what they wanna consume next.

1:38:24.180 --> 1:38:25.340
 Some of that can be abused,

1:38:25.340 --> 1:38:27.100
 some of that can be used for good,

1:38:27.100 --> 1:38:29.060
 like for Netflix or something like that.

1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:30.300
 What are your thoughts about all this?

1:38:30.300 --> 1:38:35.300
 Yeah, I mean, I really don't think humans are very smart,

1:38:35.420 --> 1:38:38.700
 all things considered, I think we're like limited.

1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:43.220
 And we're dumb enough that we're very easily manipulable.

1:38:43.220 --> 1:38:45.980
 Not just like, oh, like our emotions,

1:38:45.980 --> 1:38:50.260
 people can, our emotions can be pulled like puppet strings.

1:38:50.260 --> 1:38:51.240
 I mean, again, I look at like,

1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:53.460
 I do look at what's going on in political polarization now

1:38:53.460 --> 1:38:56.500
 and I see a lot of puppet string emotions happening.

1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:58.980
 So yeah, there's a lot to be scared of for sure,

1:38:58.980 --> 1:39:00.660
 like very scared of.

1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:03.700
 I get excited about a lot of very specific things.

1:39:03.700 --> 1:39:06.420
 Like one of the things I get excited about is I like,

1:39:06.420 --> 1:39:08.540
 so the future of wearables, right?

1:39:08.540 --> 1:39:09.720
 Again, I think that it would be like,

1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:11.700
 oh, the wrist, the Fitbit around my wrist

1:39:11.700 --> 1:39:13.380
 is gonna seem, you know, the whoop

1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:17.900
 is gonna seem really hilariously old school in 20 years.

1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:18.740
 Back with Neuralink.

1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:21.020
 Like a big bracelet, right?

1:39:21.020 --> 1:39:24.140
 It's gonna turn into little sensors in our blood probably,

1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:26.220
 or, you know, even, you know, infrared,

1:39:26.220 --> 1:39:28.700
 we're, you know, just things that are gonna be,

1:39:28.700 --> 1:39:31.060
 it's gonna be collecting a hundred times more data

1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:32.580
 than it collects now, more nuanced data,

1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:34.420
 more specific to our body.

1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:36.660
 And it's going to be, you know, super reliable,

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:38.100
 but that's the hardware side.

1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.460
 And then the software is gonna be,

1:39:40.460 --> 1:39:41.660
 this is, I've not done my deep dive.

1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:42.620
 This is all speculation,

1:39:42.620 --> 1:39:45.060
 but the software is gonna get really good.

1:39:45.060 --> 1:39:46.940
 And this is the AI component.

1:39:46.940 --> 1:39:49.200
 And so I get excited about specific things like that.

1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:54.200
 Like think about if hardware were able to collect,

1:39:54.580 --> 1:39:56.680
 first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome

1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:00.700
 and we know a lot more about what a genome sequence means.

1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:03.420
 Cause you can collect your genome now

1:40:03.420 --> 1:40:04.400
 and we just don't know much.

1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:07.160
 We, okay, we don't have much to do with that information.

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.220
 As AI gets, so now you have your genome,

1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:11.260
 you've got what's in your blood at any given moment,

1:40:11.260 --> 1:40:13.260
 all the levels of everything, right?

1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:16.140
 You have the exact width of your heart arteries

1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:17.780
 at any given moment, you've got.

1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:20.660
 All the, all the virons,

1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:22.780
 all the viruses that ever visited your body

1:40:22.780 --> 1:40:24.020
 cause there's a trace of it.

1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:25.700
 So you have all the pathogens,

1:40:25.700 --> 1:40:27.620
 all the things that like,

1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:29.300
 you should be concerned about health wise

1:40:29.300 --> 1:40:30.740
 and might have threatened you,

1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:32.940
 you might be immune from all of that kind of stuff.

1:40:32.940 --> 1:40:34.180
 They also, of course it knows

1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:35.620
 how fast your heart is beating

1:40:35.620 --> 1:40:37.140
 and it knows how much you know,

1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:39.500
 exactly the amount of exercise,

1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:41.160
 knows your muscle mass and your weight and all that,

1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.960
 but it also maybe can even know your emotions.

1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:44.820
 I mean, make, if emotions, you know, what are they,

1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:45.660
 you know, where do they come from?

1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:48.820
 Probably pretty obvious chemicals once we get in there.

1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:50.660
 So again, Neuralink can be involved here maybe

1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:53.140
 in collecting information, you know,

1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:54.100
 cause right now you have to do the thing,

1:40:54.100 --> 1:40:55.020
 what's your mood right now?

1:40:55.020 --> 1:40:56.300
 And it's hard to even assess, you know,

1:40:56.300 --> 1:40:58.860
 and you're in a bad mood, it's hard to even, but.

1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:00.660
 By the way, just as a shout out,

1:41:00.660 --> 1:41:03.780
 Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's a neuroscientist

1:41:03.780 --> 1:41:05.500
 at Northeastern just wrote a,

1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:07.060
 I mean, not just, like a few years ago,

1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:09.700
 wrote a whole book saying our expression of emotions

1:41:09.700 --> 1:41:12.260
 has nothing to do with the experience of emotions.

1:41:12.260 --> 1:41:15.100
 So you really actually want to be measuring.

1:41:15.100 --> 1:41:16.300
 That, that's exactly.

1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:18.700
 I, you can tell because one of these apps pops up

1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:20.660
 and says, you know, what, how do you feel right now?

1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:21.500
 Good, bad?

1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:22.320
 I'm like, I don't know.

1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:24.700
 Like I feel bad right now because the thing popping up

1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:26.660
 reminded me that I'm procrastinating.

1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:27.900
 So I was on my phone, I should have been more,

1:41:27.900 --> 1:41:29.320
 you know, I'm like, that's not my, you know.

1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:33.400
 So I think it will probably be able to very,

1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:34.660
 get all this info, right?

1:41:34.660 --> 1:41:37.260
 Now the AI can go to town.

1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:39.500
 Think about when the AI gets really good at this

1:41:39.500 --> 1:41:42.460
 and it knows your genome and it knows it can just,

1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:46.300
 I want the AI to just tell me what to do when it turns up.

1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:47.820
 Okay, so how about this?

1:41:47.820 --> 1:41:50.540
 Now imagine attaching that to a meal service, right?

1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:51.700
 And the meal service has everything, you know,

1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:54.620
 all the million ingredients and supplements and vitamins

1:41:54.620 --> 1:41:55.860
 and everything.

1:41:55.860 --> 1:41:59.420
 And I give the, I tell the AI my broad goals.

1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:02.500
 I want to gain muscle or I want to, you know,

1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:04.220
 maintain my weight, but I want to have more energy

1:42:04.220 --> 1:42:05.540
 or whatever, I just want, or I want to, you know,

1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:06.660
 I just want to be very healthy and I want to,

1:42:06.660 --> 1:42:09.420
 obviously everyone wants the same, like 10 basic things.

1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:11.300
 Like you want to avoid cancer, you want to, you know,

1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:13.300
 various things, you want to age slower.

1:42:14.300 --> 1:42:19.300
 So now the AI has my goals and a drone comes at,

1:42:19.620 --> 1:42:22.340
 you know, a little thing pops up and it says like,

1:42:22.340 --> 1:42:24.660
 you know, beep, beep, like, you know, 15 minutes,

1:42:24.660 --> 1:42:25.980
 you're going to eat because it knows that's a great,

1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:27.860
 that's the right time for my body to eat.

1:42:27.860 --> 1:42:30.180
 15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall

1:42:30.180 --> 1:42:32.140
 where a drone has come from the factory,

1:42:32.140 --> 1:42:35.140
 the eating, the food factory and dropped the perfect meal

1:42:35.140 --> 1:42:38.820
 for my, that moment for me, for my mood, for my genome,

1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:40.700
 for my blood contents.

1:42:40.700 --> 1:42:42.740
 And it's, it's because it knows my goals.

1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:44.620
 So, you know, it knows I want to feel energy at this time

1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:45.740
 and then I want to wind down here.

1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:47.380
 So those things you have to tell it.

1:42:47.380 --> 1:42:50.340
 Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it knows what kind

1:42:50.340 --> 1:42:52.500
 of components of a meal you've enjoyed in the past

1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:53.940
 so you can assemble the perfect meal.

1:42:53.940 --> 1:42:56.940
 Exactly, it knows you way better than you know yourself,

1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:58.340
 better than any human could ever know you.

1:42:58.340 --> 1:42:59.940
 And a little thing pops up,

1:42:59.940 --> 1:43:01.460
 you still have some choice, right?

1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:05.220
 Still, it pops up and it says like, you know, coffee,

1:43:05.220 --> 1:43:07.300
 because it knows that, you know, my cutoff,

1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:08.940
 they says, you know, I can have coffee

1:43:08.940 --> 1:43:11.540
 for the next 15 minutes only because at that point

1:43:11.540 --> 1:43:12.940
 it knows how long it stays in my system.

1:43:12.940 --> 1:43:14.740
 It knows what my sleep is like when I have it too late.

1:43:14.740 --> 1:43:16.220
 It knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow

1:43:16.220 --> 1:43:17.780
 because that was my calendar.

1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:19.660
 And so I think a lot of people's, this is,

1:43:19.660 --> 1:43:22.100
 I think something that humans are wrong about

1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:23.660
 is that most people will hear this and be like,

1:43:23.660 --> 1:43:26.060
 that sounds awful, that sounds dystopian.

1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.460
 No, it doesn't, it sounds incredible.

1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:29.660
 And if we all had this, we would not look back and be like,

1:43:29.660 --> 1:43:32.140
 I wish I was like making awful choices every day

1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:33.660
 like I was in the past.

1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:36.180
 And then this isn't, these aren't important decisions.

1:43:36.180 --> 1:43:38.860
 Your important decision making energy,

1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:41.700
 your important focus and your attention can go

1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:44.620
 onto your kids and on your work and on, you know,

1:43:44.620 --> 1:43:46.420
 helping other people and things that matter.

1:43:46.420 --> 1:43:49.940
 And so I think AI, when I think about like personal

1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:53.780
 lifestyle and stuff like that, I really love,

1:43:53.780 --> 1:43:55.420
 like I love thinking about that.

1:43:55.420 --> 1:43:57.020
 I think it's gonna be very, and I think we'll all be

1:43:57.020 --> 1:44:00.460
 so much healthier that when we look back today,

1:44:00.460 --> 1:44:02.060
 one of the things that's gonna look so primitive

1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:03.500
 is the one size fits all thing,

1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:05.460
 getting like reading advice about keto.

1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:10.020
 Each genome is gonna have very specific,

1:44:10.020 --> 1:44:12.780
 one, you know, unique advice coming from AI.

1:44:12.780 --> 1:44:14.180
 And so, yeah.

1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:16.700
 Yeah, the customization that's enabled by collection

1:44:16.700 --> 1:44:19.700
 of data and the use of AI, a lot of people think

1:44:19.700 --> 1:44:22.340
 what's the, like they think of the worst case scenario

1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:25.180
 that data being used by authoritarian governments

1:44:25.180 --> 1:44:26.580
 to control you, all that kind of stuff.

1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:28.420
 They don't think about most likely,

1:44:28.420 --> 1:44:30.020
 especially in a capitalist society,

1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:34.300
 it's most likely going to be used as part of a competition

1:44:34.300 --> 1:44:36.780
 to get you the most delicious and healthy meal possible

1:44:36.780 --> 1:44:38.340
 as fast as possible.

1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:40.700
 Yeah, so the world will definitely be much better

1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:42.260
 with the integration of data.

1:44:42.260 --> 1:44:46.420
 But of course, you wanna be able to be transparent

1:44:46.420 --> 1:44:48.340
 and honest about how that data is misused.

1:44:48.340 --> 1:44:50.380
 And that's why it's important to have free speech

1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:52.500
 and people to speak out, like when some bullshit

1:44:52.500 --> 1:44:53.580
 is being done by companies.

1:44:53.580 --> 1:44:55.940
 That we need to have our wits about us as a society.

1:44:55.940 --> 1:45:00.460
 Like this is free speech is the mechanism

1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:03.460
 by which the big brain can think, can think for itself,

1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:05.940
 can think straight, can see straight.

1:45:05.940 --> 1:45:08.340
 When you take away free speech, when you start saying

1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:10.940
 that in every topic, when any topic's political,

1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:12.820
 it becomes treacherous to talk about.

1:45:12.820 --> 1:45:15.660
 So forget the government taking away free speech.

1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:18.860
 If the culture penalizes nuanced conversation

1:45:18.860 --> 1:45:21.060
 about any topic that's political

1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:24.380
 and the politics is so all consuming

1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:29.380
 and it's such a incredible market to polarize people,

1:45:30.100 --> 1:45:32.860
 for media to polarize people and to bring any topic it can

1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:36.700
 into that and get people hooked on it as a political topic,

1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:38.100
 we become a very dumb society.

1:45:38.100 --> 1:45:39.860
 So free speech goes away as far as it matters.

1:45:39.860 --> 1:45:42.060
 People say, oh, people like to say outside,

1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:43.220
 you don't even know what free speech is.

1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:46.860
 Free speech is, your free speech is not being violated.

1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:48.380
 It's like, no, you're right.

1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:50.780
 My first amendment rights are not being violated.

1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:52.060
 But the culture of free speech,

1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:53.860
 which is the second ingredient of two,

1:45:53.860 --> 1:45:55.540
 you need the first amendment

1:45:55.540 --> 1:45:57.260
 and you need the culture of free speech.

1:45:57.260 --> 1:45:58.180
 And now you have free speech

1:45:58.180 --> 1:46:00.940
 and the culture is much more specific.

1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:03.180
 You obviously can have a culture that believes people

1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:06.340
 right now take any topic again, that has to do with like,

1:46:06.340 --> 1:46:10.020
 some very sensitive topics, police shootings,

1:46:10.940 --> 1:46:13.660
 or what's going on in K through 12 schools

1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:16.820
 or even climate change, take any of these.

1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:19.900
 And the first amendment's still there.

1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:22.700
 You're not gonna get arrested no matter what you say.

1:46:22.700 --> 1:46:25.620
 The culture of free speech is gone

1:46:25.620 --> 1:46:27.060
 because you will be destroyed.

1:46:27.060 --> 1:46:29.420
 Your life can be over as far as it matters

1:46:30.820 --> 1:46:31.700
 if you say the wrong thing.

1:46:31.700 --> 1:46:35.260
 But a really vigorous culture of free speech,

1:46:35.260 --> 1:46:36.540
 you get no penalty at all

1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:38.380
 for even saying something super dumb.

1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:40.380
 People will say, like, people will laugh and be like,

1:46:40.380 --> 1:46:42.660
 well, that was like kind of hilariously offensive

1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:43.940
 and like, not at all correct.

1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:45.460
 Like, you know, you're wrong and here's why.

1:46:45.460 --> 1:46:47.100
 But no one's like mad at you.

1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:49.660
 Now the brain is thinking at its best.

1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:51.020
 The IQ of the big brain is like,

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:53.140
 as high as it can be in that culture.

1:46:53.140 --> 1:46:55.060
 And the culture where, and you say something wrong

1:46:55.060 --> 1:46:56.540
 and people say, oh, wow, you've changed.

1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.780
 Oh, wow, like, look, this is his real colors.

1:46:58.780 --> 1:47:01.580
 He knows the big brain is dumb.

1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:03.860
 You still have mutual respect for each other.

1:47:03.860 --> 1:47:06.980
 So like, you don't think lesser of others

1:47:06.980 --> 1:47:08.540
 when they say a bunch of dumb things.

1:47:08.540 --> 1:47:10.860
 You know it's just the play of ideas.

1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:12.860
 But you still have respect, you still have love for them.

1:47:12.860 --> 1:47:15.300
 Because I think the worst case is

1:47:15.300 --> 1:47:18.780
 when you have a complete free like anarchy of ideas

1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:22.180
 where it's like everybody lost hope

1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:25.740
 that something like a truth can even be converged towards.

1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:27.540
 Like, everybody has their own truth.

1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:29.580
 Then it's just chaos.

1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:31.500
 Like, if you have mutual respect

1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:33.780
 and a mutual goal of arriving at the truth

1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:35.820
 and the humility that you want to listen

1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:37.180
 to other people's ideas,

1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:38.940
 and a forgiveness that other people's ideas

1:47:38.940 --> 1:47:39.860
 might be dumb as hell,

1:47:39.860 --> 1:47:41.340
 that doesn't mean they're lesser beings,

1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:42.420
 all that kind of stuff.

1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:44.540
 But that's like a weird balance to strike.

1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:47.540
 Right now people are being trained, little kids,

1:47:47.540 --> 1:47:49.300
 college students, being trained

1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:51.340
 to think the exact opposite way.

1:47:51.340 --> 1:47:53.260
 To think that there's no such thing as objective truth,

1:47:53.260 --> 1:47:54.620
 which is, you know, the objective truth

1:47:54.620 --> 1:47:59.180
 is the end on the compass for every thinker.

1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:02.140
 Doesn't mean we're necessarily on our way or we're finding,

1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:03.580
 but we're all aiming in the same direction.

1:48:03.580 --> 1:48:05.020
 We all believe that there's a place

1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:06.700
 we can eventually get closer to.

1:48:07.660 --> 1:48:08.980
 Not objective truth, you know,

1:48:08.980 --> 1:48:12.140
 teaching them that disagreement is bad, violence.

1:48:12.140 --> 1:48:14.500
 You know, it's, you know,

1:48:16.220 --> 1:48:17.980
 it's like, you know, you quickly sound like

1:48:17.980 --> 1:48:20.380
 you're just going on like a political rant with this topic,

1:48:20.380 --> 1:48:22.420
 but like, it's really bad.

1:48:22.420 --> 1:48:24.780
 It's like genuinely the worst.

1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:26.860
 If I had my own country,

1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:30.460
 I mean, it's like I would teach kids

1:48:30.460 --> 1:48:31.780
 some very specific things

1:48:31.780 --> 1:48:34.220
 that this is doing the exact opposite of,

1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.380
 and it sucks, it sucks.

1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:40.700
 Speaking of a way to escape this,

1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:43.460
 you've tweeted 30 minutes of reading a day equals,

1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:44.300
 yeah, this whole video,

1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:46.020
 and it's cool to think about reading,

1:48:46.020 --> 1:48:50.260
 like as a habit and something that accumulates.

1:48:50.260 --> 1:48:51.860
 You said 30 minutes of reading a day

1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:54.300
 equals 1000 books in 50 years.

1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:56.940
 I love like thinking about this,

1:48:56.940 --> 1:48:59.340
 like chipping away at the mountain.

1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:02.900
 Can you expand on that sort of the habit of reading?

1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:04.620
 How do you recommend people read?

1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:06.940
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's incredible.

1:49:06.940 --> 1:49:10.580
 If you do something, a little of something every day,

1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:12.780
 it compiles, it compiles.

1:49:12.780 --> 1:49:14.300
 You know, I always think about like the people

1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:16.700
 who achieve these incredible things in life,

1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:19.580
 these great, like famous, legendary people,

1:49:19.580 --> 1:49:21.300
 they have the same number of days that you do,

1:49:21.300 --> 1:49:23.660
 and it's not like they were doing magical days.

1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:26.620
 They just, they got a little done every day,

1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:31.620
 and that adds up to a monument,

1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:33.940
 they're putting one brick in a day,

1:49:33.940 --> 1:49:35.020
 eventually they have this building,

1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:36.300
 this legendary building.

1:49:36.300 --> 1:49:38.140
 So you can take writing,

1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:40.660
 someone who, you know, there's two aspiring writers,

1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:42.100
 and one doesn't ever write,

1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:44.420
 doesn't, you know, manages to never zero write,

1:49:44.420 --> 1:49:45.260
 zero pages a day,

1:49:45.260 --> 1:49:49.340
 and the other one manages to do two pages a week, right?

1:49:49.340 --> 1:49:50.180
 Not very much.

1:49:50.180 --> 1:49:51.140
 The other one does zero pages a week,

1:49:51.140 --> 1:49:55.420
 two pages a week, 98% of both of their time is the same.

1:49:55.420 --> 1:49:58.580
 The other person, just 2%, they're doing one other thing.

1:49:58.580 --> 1:50:00.700
 One year later, they have written,

1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:01.740
 they write two books a year.

1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:04.420
 This prolific person, you know, in 20 years,

1:50:04.420 --> 1:50:05.500
 they've written 40 books,

1:50:05.500 --> 1:50:07.500
 they're one of the most prolific writers of all time.

1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:08.900
 They write two pages a week.

1:50:09.820 --> 1:50:10.980
 Sorry, that's not true.

1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:12.340
 That was two pages a day.

1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:13.420
 Okay, two pages a week,

1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:15.860
 you're still writing about a book every two years.

1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:17.940
 So in 20 years, you've still written 10 books,

1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:19.740
 also prolific writer, right?

1:50:19.740 --> 1:50:21.380
 Huge, massive writing career.

1:50:21.380 --> 1:50:23.380
 You write two pages every Sunday morning.

1:50:23.380 --> 1:50:25.220
 The other person has the same exact week,

1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:26.460
 and they don't do that Sunday morning thing.

1:50:26.460 --> 1:50:27.900
 They are a wannabe writer.

1:50:27.900 --> 1:50:29.100
 They always said they could write.

1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:30.860
 They talk about how they used to be,

1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:31.900
 and nothing happens, right?

1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:34.220
 So it's inspiring, I think,

1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:35.660
 for a lot of people who feel frustrated

1:50:35.660 --> 1:50:36.500
 and they're not doing anything.

1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:38.500
 So reading is another example

1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:43.500
 where someone who reads very, you know, doesn't read,

1:50:43.620 --> 1:50:45.620
 and someone who's a prolific reader,

1:50:45.620 --> 1:50:47.500
 you know, I always think about like the Tyler Cowen types.

1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:49.940
 I'm like, how the hell do you read so much?

1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:51.300
 It's infuriating, you know?

1:50:51.300 --> 1:50:53.780
 Or like James Clear puts out his like,

1:50:53.780 --> 1:50:56.460
 his 10 favorite books of the year,

1:50:56.460 --> 1:50:57.820
 his 20 favorite books of the year.

1:50:57.820 --> 1:51:00.660
 I'm like, your 20 favorites?

1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:02.180
 Like I'm trying to just read 20 books,

1:51:02.180 --> 1:51:03.540
 like that would be an amazing year.

1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:06.020
 So, but the thing is,

1:51:06.020 --> 1:51:07.940
 they're not doing something crazy and magical.

1:51:07.940 --> 1:51:09.940
 They're just reading a half hour a night, you know?

1:51:09.940 --> 1:51:11.580
 If you read a half hour a night,

1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:12.980
 the calculation I came to is that

1:51:12.980 --> 1:51:15.220
 you can read a thousand books in 50 years.

1:51:15.220 --> 1:51:18.580
 So as someone who's 80 and they've read a thousand books,

1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:20.020
 you know, between 30 and 80,

1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:21.780
 they are extremely well read.

1:51:21.780 --> 1:51:24.820
 They can delve deep into many nonfiction areas.

1:51:24.820 --> 1:51:27.820
 They can be, you know, an amazing fiction reader,

1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.380
 avid fiction reader.

1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:30.580
 And again, that's a half hour a day.

1:51:30.580 --> 1:51:31.540
 Some people can do an hour,

1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:33.060
 a half hour in the morning audio book,

1:51:33.060 --> 1:51:34.140
 half hour at night in bed.

1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:35.140
 Now they've read 2000 books.

1:51:35.140 --> 1:51:40.140
 So I think it's motivating.

1:51:40.860 --> 1:51:43.820
 And you realize that a lot of times you think

1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:45.820
 that the people who are doing amazing things

1:51:45.820 --> 1:51:48.860
 and you're not, you think that there's a bigger gap

1:51:48.860 --> 1:51:51.420
 between you and them than there really is.

1:51:51.420 --> 1:51:53.980
 I, on the reading front, I'm a very slow reader,

1:51:53.980 --> 1:51:57.500
 which is just a very frustrating fact about me,

1:51:58.380 --> 1:52:00.660
 but I'm faster with audio books.

1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:02.460
 And also I just, you know, I'll just,

1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:04.300
 it's just hard to get myself to read,

1:52:04.300 --> 1:52:05.660
 but I've started doing audio books

1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:09.060
 and I'll wake up, throw it on, do it in the shower,

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.980
 brushing my teeth, you know, making breakfast,

1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:12.820
 dealing with the dogs, things like that, whatever,

1:52:12.820 --> 1:52:14.140
 until I sit down.

1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:17.820
 And that's, I can read, I can read a book a week,

1:52:17.820 --> 1:52:20.420
 a book every 10 days at that clip.

1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:21.820
 And suddenly I'm this big reader

1:52:21.820 --> 1:52:24.180
 because I'm just, while doing my morning stuff,

1:52:24.180 --> 1:52:25.340
 I have it on and also it's this fun,

1:52:25.340 --> 1:52:26.260
 it makes the morning so fun.

1:52:26.260 --> 1:52:27.860
 I'm like having a great time the whole morning.

1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:29.500
 So I'm like, oh, I'm so into this book.

1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:31.300
 So I think that, you know, audio books

1:52:31.300 --> 1:52:32.940
 is another amazing gift to people

1:52:32.940 --> 1:52:34.180
 who have a hard time reading.

1:52:34.180 --> 1:52:36.260
 I find that that's actually an interesting skill.

1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:38.700
 I do audio books quite a bit.

1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:41.740
 Like it's a skill to maintain, at least for me,

1:52:41.740 --> 1:52:43.180
 probably the kind of books I read,

1:52:43.180 --> 1:52:45.620
 which is often like history or like,

1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:47.060
 there's a lot of content.

1:52:47.060 --> 1:52:51.900
 And if you miss parts of it, you miss out on stuff.

1:52:51.900 --> 1:52:55.300
 And so it's a skill to maintain focus.

1:52:55.300 --> 1:52:56.140
 At least for me.

1:52:56.140 --> 1:52:58.820
 Well, the 10 second back button is very valuable.

1:52:58.820 --> 1:52:59.660
 Oh, interesting.

1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:01.140
 So I just, if I get lost,

1:53:01.140 --> 1:53:02.460
 sometimes the book is so good

1:53:02.460 --> 1:53:03.980
 that I'm thinking about what the person just said.

1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:06.540
 And I just get, the skill for me is just remembering to pause.

1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:09.020
 And if I don't, no problem, just back, back, back, back.

1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:10.460
 Just three quick backs.

1:53:10.460 --> 1:53:12.140
 So of course it's not that efficient,

1:53:12.140 --> 1:53:14.020
 but it's, I do the same thing when I'm reading.

1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:14.860
 I'll read a whole paragraph

1:53:14.860 --> 1:53:15.900
 and realize I was tuning out.

1:53:15.900 --> 1:53:17.100
 Yeah, you know?

1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:19.780
 You know, I haven't actually even considered to try that.

1:53:19.780 --> 1:53:22.900
 I've been so hard on myself maintaining focus

1:53:22.900 --> 1:53:24.300
 because you do get lost in thought.

1:53:24.300 --> 1:53:25.140
 Maybe I should try that.

1:53:25.140 --> 1:53:26.820
 Yeah, and when you get lost in thought, by the way,

1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:27.900
 you're processing the book.

1:53:27.900 --> 1:53:29.220
 That's not wasted time.

1:53:29.220 --> 1:53:31.300
 That's your brain really categorizing

1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:33.460
 and cataloging what you just read and like.

1:53:33.460 --> 1:53:36.060
 Well, there's several kinds of thoughts, right?

1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:37.540
 There's thoughts related to the book

1:53:37.540 --> 1:53:40.060
 and there's a thought that it could take you elsewhere.

1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:43.860
 Well, I find that if I am continually thinking

1:53:43.860 --> 1:53:45.820
 about something else, I just say, I'm not,

1:53:45.820 --> 1:53:47.740
 I just pause the book.

1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:49.220
 Yeah, especially in the shower or something

1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:51.180
 when like, that's sometimes

1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:52.140
 when really great thoughts come up.

1:53:52.140 --> 1:53:53.860
 If I'm having all these thoughts about other stuff,

1:53:53.860 --> 1:53:55.860
 I'm saying clearly my mind wants to work on something else.

1:53:55.860 --> 1:53:56.700
 So I'll just pause it.

1:53:56.700 --> 1:53:57.780
 Yeah, quiet, Dan Carlin.

1:53:57.780 --> 1:53:59.220
 I'm thinking about something else right now.

1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:00.620
 Exactly, exactly.

1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:04.220
 Also you can, things like you have to head out to the store.

1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:06.460
 Like I'm gonna read 20 pages on that trip.

1:54:06.460 --> 1:54:08.540
 Just walking back and forth, going to the airport.

1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:10.460
 I mean, flights, you know, the Uber,

1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:12.060
 and then you're walking to the,

1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:13.100
 walking through the airport,

1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:13.980
 you're sharing the security line.

1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:15.900
 I'm reading the whole time, like,

1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:17.380
 I know this is not groundbreaking.

1:54:17.380 --> 1:54:18.500
 People know what audio books are,

1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:19.980
 but I think that more people

1:54:19.980 --> 1:54:21.380
 should probably get into them than do.

1:54:21.380 --> 1:54:22.220
 Cause I know a lot of people,

1:54:22.220 --> 1:54:23.540
 they have this stubborn kind of things.

1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:25.740
 I don't like, I like to have the paper book and sure,

1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:27.940
 but like, it's pretty fun to be able to read.

1:54:27.940 --> 1:54:31.060
 I still, I listen to a huge number of audio books

1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:32.940
 and podcasts, but I still,

1:54:32.940 --> 1:54:36.540
 the most impactful experiences for me are still reading.

1:54:36.540 --> 1:54:38.340
 And I read very, very slow.

1:54:38.340 --> 1:54:41.060
 And it's very frustrating when like,

1:54:41.060 --> 1:54:43.460
 you go to these websites like that estimate

1:54:43.460 --> 1:54:45.620
 how long a book takes on average,

1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:46.540
 that those are always annoying.

1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:50.100
 They do like a page a minute when I read like best,

1:54:50.100 --> 1:54:51.940
 a page every two minutes, at best.

1:54:51.940 --> 1:54:54.500
 At best, when you're like really like,

1:54:54.500 --> 1:54:55.820
 actually not pausing.

1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:58.060
 I just, my ADD, it's like, I just,

1:54:58.060 --> 1:54:59.860
 it's hard to keep focusing.

1:54:59.860 --> 1:55:01.820
 And I also like to really absorb.

1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:03.460
 So on the other side of things,

1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:05.940
 when I finish a book, 10 years later, I'll be like,

1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:06.980
 you know that scene when this happens

1:55:06.980 --> 1:55:07.820
 and another friend read it,

1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:08.660
 I'll be like, what?

1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:09.500
 I don't remember any like details.

1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:10.860
 I'm like, oh, I can tell you like the entire.

1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:12.380
 So I absorbed the shit out of it,

1:55:12.380 --> 1:55:14.820
 but I don't think it's worth it to like have to read

1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:16.580
 so less, so much less in my life.

1:55:16.580 --> 1:55:18.740
 I actually, so in terms of going to the airport,

1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:22.260
 you know, in these like filler moments of life,

1:55:22.260 --> 1:55:24.860
 I do a lot of, it's an app called Anki.

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.620
 I don't know if you know about it.

1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:29.180
 It's a space repetition app.

1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:31.580
 So there's all of these facts I have when I read,

1:55:31.580 --> 1:55:33.940
 I write it down if I want to remember it.

1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:36.940
 And it's these, you review it.

1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:39.180
 And the one, the things you remember,

1:55:39.180 --> 1:55:41.380
 it takes longer and longer to bring back up.

1:55:41.380 --> 1:55:43.660
 It's like flashcards, but a digital app.

1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:44.500
 It's called Anki.

1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:45.340
 I recommend it to a lot of people.

1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:46.780
 There's a huge community of people

1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:48.100
 that are just like obsessed with it.

1:55:48.100 --> 1:55:49.740
 Anki?

1:55:49.740 --> 1:55:51.660
 A N K I.

1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:55.620
 So this is extremely well known app and idea,

1:55:55.620 --> 1:55:59.460
 like among students who are like medical students,

1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:01.820
 like people that really have to study.

1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:03.740
 Like this is not like fun stuff.

1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:06.300
 They really have to memorize a lot of things.

1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:07.380
 They have to remember them well.

1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:08.540
 They have to be able to integrate them

1:56:08.540 --> 1:56:10.180
 with a bunch of ideas.

1:56:10.180 --> 1:56:13.460
 And I find it to be really useful for like,

1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:14.820
 when you read history,

1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:17.820
 if you think this particular factoid,

1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:19.780
 they'd probably be extremely useful for you.

1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:23.460
 Cause you're, that'd be interesting actually thought.

1:56:23.460 --> 1:56:25.540
 Cause you're doing, you talked about like opening up

1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:27.700
 a trillion tabs and reading things.

1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:32.260
 You know, you probably want to remember some facts

1:56:32.260 --> 1:56:33.540
 you read along the way.

1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:34.940
 Like you might remember, okay,

1:56:34.940 --> 1:56:37.060
 this thing I can't directly put into the writing,

1:56:37.060 --> 1:56:38.860
 but it's a cool little factoid.

1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:39.700
 I want to.

1:56:39.700 --> 1:56:40.540
 Oh, all the time.

1:56:40.540 --> 1:56:41.460
 Store that in there.

1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:43.900
 And that's why I go Anki, drop it in.

1:56:43.900 --> 1:56:45.020
 Oh, you can just drop it in.

1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:45.860
 Yeah.

1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:48.620
 You drop it in a line of a podcast or like a video?

1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:49.620
 Well, no.

1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:50.580
 I guess I can type it though.

1:56:50.580 --> 1:56:51.420
 So yes.

1:56:51.420 --> 1:56:53.740
 So Anki, there's a bunch of,

1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:54.900
 it's called Space Repetitions.

1:56:54.900 --> 1:56:57.060
 There's a bunch of apps that are much nicer than Anki.

1:56:57.060 --> 1:57:00.500
 Anki is the ghetto, like Craigslist version,

1:57:00.500 --> 1:57:02.940
 but it has a giant community because people are like,

1:57:02.940 --> 1:57:04.540
 we don't want features.

1:57:04.540 --> 1:57:06.620
 We want a text box.

1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:08.820
 Like it's very basic, very stripped down.

1:57:08.820 --> 1:57:09.900
 So you can drop in stuff.

1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:10.740
 You can drop it.

1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:11.580
 That sounds really,

1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:13.460
 I can't believe I have not come across this.

1:57:13.460 --> 1:57:15.100
 You actually, once you look into it,

1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:18.300
 you'll realize that how have I not come,

1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:20.100
 you are the person,

1:57:20.100 --> 1:57:22.020
 I guarantee you'll probably write a blog about it.

1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:23.260
 I can't believe you actually have it.

1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:24.100
 Well, it's also just like.

1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:25.100
 It's your people too.

1:57:25.100 --> 1:57:28.220
 And my people say, what do you write about?

1:57:28.220 --> 1:57:30.740
 Literally anything I find interesting.

1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:33.740
 And so for me, once you start a blog,

1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:36.700
 like your entire worldview becomes,

1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:37.700
 would this be a good blog post?

1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:39.220
 Would this be, I mean, that's the lens

1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:40.260
 I see everything through,

1:57:40.260 --> 1:57:42.780
 but I constantly coming across something

1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:46.380
 or just a tweet, something that I'm like,

1:57:46.380 --> 1:57:47.940
 ooh, I need to like share this with my readers.

1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:52.740
 My readers to me are like my friends who I'm like,

1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:53.900
 I'm gonna, oh, I need to show,

1:57:53.900 --> 1:57:55.260
 I need to tell them about this.

1:57:55.260 --> 1:57:56.420
 And so I feel like just a place to,

1:57:56.420 --> 1:57:58.100
 I mean, I collect things in a document right now,

1:57:58.100 --> 1:57:58.940
 if it's like really good,

1:57:58.940 --> 1:58:01.020
 but it's the little factoids and stuff like that.

1:58:01.020 --> 1:58:02.780
 I think, especially if I'm learning something,

1:58:02.780 --> 1:58:03.620
 if I'm like.

1:58:03.620 --> 1:58:05.140
 So the problem is when you say stuff,

1:58:05.140 --> 1:58:07.940
 when you look at it, like tweet and all that kind of stuff

1:58:07.940 --> 1:58:11.540
 is you also need to couple that with a system for review.

1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:14.060
 Cause what Anki does is like literally,

1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:16.460
 it determines for me, I don't have to do anything.

1:58:16.460 --> 1:58:18.660
 There's this giant pile of things I've saved

1:58:18.660 --> 1:58:23.660
 and it brings up to me, okay, here's, I don't know.

1:58:25.380 --> 1:58:27.700
 When Churchill did something, right?

1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:29.860
 I'm reading about World War II a lot now,

1:58:29.860 --> 1:58:31.900
 like a particular event, here's that.

1:58:31.900 --> 1:58:33.940
 Do you remember when, what year that happened?

1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:38.700
 And you say yes or no, or like you get to pick,

1:58:38.700 --> 1:58:42.100
 you get to see the answer and you get to self evaluate

1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:43.380
 how well you remember that fact.

1:58:43.380 --> 1:58:44.340
 And if you remember well,

1:58:44.340 --> 1:58:46.900
 it'll be another month before you see it again.

1:58:46.900 --> 1:58:48.900
 If you don't remember, it'll bring it up again.

1:58:48.900 --> 1:58:52.260
 That's a way to review tweets, to review concepts.

1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:54.740
 And it offloads the kind of,

1:58:54.740 --> 1:58:56.340
 the process of selecting which parts

1:58:56.340 --> 1:58:57.420
 you're supposed to review or not.

1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:58.980
 And you can grow that library.

1:58:58.980 --> 1:59:00.820
 I mean, obviously medical students use it

1:59:00.820 --> 1:59:04.100
 for like tens of thousands of facts and it's.

1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:05.140
 It just gamifies it too.

1:59:05.140 --> 1:59:07.820
 It's like you can passively sit back and just,

1:59:07.820 --> 1:59:09.140
 and the thing will like make sure

1:59:09.140 --> 1:59:10.300
 you eventually learn it all.

1:59:10.300 --> 1:59:13.500
 This is, you know, you don't have to be the executive

1:59:13.500 --> 1:59:15.340
 calling that like the program,

1:59:15.340 --> 1:59:17.500
 the memorization program someone else is handling.

1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:20.900
 I would love to hear about like you trying it out

1:59:20.900 --> 1:59:22.380
 or space repetition as an idea.

1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:24.860
 There's a few other apps, but Anki's the big master.

1:59:24.860 --> 1:59:26.180
 I totally want to try.

1:59:26.180 --> 1:59:29.180
 You've written and spoken quite a bit about procrastination.

1:59:29.180 --> 1:59:32.820
 I like you suffer from procrastination

1:59:32.820 --> 1:59:35.940
 like many other people, suffering quotes.

1:59:37.660 --> 1:59:39.740
 How do we avoid procrastination?

1:59:39.740 --> 1:59:42.040
 I don't think the suffer is in quotes.

1:59:43.620 --> 1:59:45.680
 I think that's a huge part of the problem

1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:48.920
 is that it's treated like a silly problem.

1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:55.060
 People don't take it seriously as a dire problem,

1:59:56.260 --> 1:59:57.880
 but it can be.

1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:00.920
 It can ruin your life.

2:00:03.220 --> 2:00:08.220
 There's like, we talked about the compiling concept

2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:11.340
 with, you know, if you read a little,

2:00:11.340 --> 2:00:14.660
 you know, if you write, if you write two pages a week,

2:00:15.580 --> 2:00:16.700
 you write a book every two years,

2:00:16.700 --> 2:00:18.180
 you're a prolific writer, right?

2:00:18.180 --> 2:00:20.260
 And the difference between, you know,

2:00:20.260 --> 2:00:22.580
 again, it's not that that person's working so hard.

2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:24.660
 It's that they have the ability to,

2:00:24.660 --> 2:00:26.460
 when they commit to something like on Sunday mornings,

2:00:26.460 --> 2:00:27.720
 I'm gonna write two pages.

2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:28.560
 That's it.

2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:33.860
 They respect, they have enough,

2:00:33.860 --> 2:00:36.780
 they respect the part of them that made that decision

2:00:36.780 --> 2:00:39.460
 is a respected character in their brain.

2:00:39.460 --> 2:00:41.300
 And they say, well, that's, I decided it,

2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:43.100
 so I'm gonna do it.

2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:46.780
 The procrastinator won't do those two pages.

2:00:46.780 --> 2:00:48.580
 That's just exactly the kind of thing

2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:50.060
 the procrastinator will keep on their list

2:00:50.060 --> 2:00:51.020
 and they will not do.

2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:53.420
 But that doesn't mean they're any less talented

2:00:53.420 --> 2:00:54.980
 than the writer who does the two pages.

2:00:54.980 --> 2:00:57.380
 Doesn't mean they want it any less.

2:00:57.380 --> 2:00:58.900
 Maybe they want it even more.

2:00:58.900 --> 2:01:01.280
 And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be just as happy

2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:03.660
 having done it as the writer who does it.

2:01:03.660 --> 2:01:05.100
 So what they're missing out on,

2:01:05.100 --> 2:01:07.980
 picture a writer who writes 10 books, you know,

2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:11.100
 bestsellers, and they go on these book tours

2:01:11.100 --> 2:01:15.300
 and, you know, they, and they just are so gratified

2:01:15.300 --> 2:01:16.260
 with their career and, you know,

2:01:16.260 --> 2:01:20.600
 and they think about what the other person is missing

2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:23.480
 who does none of that, right?

2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:27.780
 So that is a massive loss, a massive loss.

2:01:27.780 --> 2:01:32.020
 And it's because the internal mechanism in their brain

2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:33.900
 is not doing what the other person's is.

2:01:33.900 --> 2:01:36.540
 So they don't have the respect for the part of them

2:01:36.540 --> 2:01:37.980
 that made the choice.

2:01:37.980 --> 2:01:40.020
 They feel like it's someone they can disregard.

2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:42.760
 And so to me, it's in the same boat

2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:47.180
 as someone who is obese because their eating habits

2:01:47.180 --> 2:01:50.800
 make them obese over time or their exercise habits.

2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:54.360
 So that, you know, that's a huge loss for that person.

2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:56.720
 That person is, you know, the health problems

2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.040
 and it's just probably making them miserable.

2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:01.960
 And it's self inflicted, right?

2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:05.760
 It's self defeating, but that doesn't make an easy problem

2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:07.520
 to fix just because you're doing it to yourself.

2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:09.400
 So to me, procrastination is another one of these

2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:11.840
 where you are the only person in your own way.

2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:15.260
 You are, you know, you are failing at something

2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:17.640
 or not doing something that you really want to do.

2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:18.920
 You know, it doesn't have to be work.

2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:21.280
 Maybe you're, you want to get out of that marriage

2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:23.080
 that you know, you realize it hits you.

2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:24.320
 You shouldn't be in this marriage.

2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:26.540
 You should get divorced and you wait 20 extra years

2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:28.640
 before you do it or you don't do it at all.

2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:33.700
 That is, you know, you're not living the life

2:02:33.700 --> 2:02:35.120
 that you know you should be living, right?

2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:38.040
 And so I think it's fascinating.

2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:39.960
 Now, the problem is it's also a funny problem

2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:43.040
 because there's short term procrastination,

2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:44.240
 which I talk about as, you know,

2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:45.720
 the kind that has a deadline.

2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:48.000
 Now, some people, you know,

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.520
 this is when I bring in, there's different characters.

2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:52.520
 There's the panic monster comes in the room

2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:54.440
 and that's when you actually, you know,

2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:57.720
 the procrastinator can, there's different levels.

2:02:57.720 --> 2:03:02.480
 There's the kind that even when there's a deadline,

2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:03.600
 they stop panicking.

2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.600
 They just, they've given up

2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:06.420
 and they really have a problem.

2:03:06.420 --> 2:03:08.280
 Then there's the kind that when there's a deadline,

2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:10.440
 they'll do it, but they'll wait till the last second.

2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:13.260
 Both of those people, I think have a huge problem

2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:15.640
 once there's no deadline because,

2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:17.400
 and most of the important things in life,

2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:18.480
 there's no deadline, which is, you know,

2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:21.120
 changing your career, you know,

2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.180
 becoming a writer when you never have been before,

2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:24.840
 getting out of your relationship,

2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:28.480
 you know, be doing whatever you need to,

2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:29.580
 the changes you need to make

2:03:29.580 --> 2:03:31.020
 in order to get into a relation.

2:03:31.020 --> 2:03:32.680
 There's a thing after it.

2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:33.760
 Launching a startup.

2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:35.360
 Launching a startup, right?

2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:37.280
 Or once you've launched a startup,

2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:40.080
 firing is the right, someone that needs to be fired, right?

2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:41.920
 I mean, going out for fundraising

2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:43.360
 instead of just trying to, you know,

2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:46.400
 there's so many moments when the big change

2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:48.320
 that you know you should be making

2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:49.960
 that would completely change your life

2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:53.200
 if you just did it has no deadline.

2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:55.560
 It just has to be coming from yourself.

2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:00.560
 And I think that a ton of people have a problem

2:04:01.060 --> 2:04:04.880
 where they will, they think this delusion

2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:05.840
 that, you know, I'm gonna do that.

2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:07.240
 I'm definitely gonna do that, you know,

2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:09.360
 but not this week, not this month,

2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:10.840
 not today, because whatever.

2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:12.280
 And they make this excuse again and again,

2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:15.060
 and it just sits there on their list collecting dust.

2:04:15.060 --> 2:04:20.060
 And so, yeah, to me, it is a very real suffering.

2:04:20.660 --> 2:04:23.740
 And the fix isn't fixing the habits.

2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:27.580
 Just like not working on the fix, first of all.

2:04:27.580 --> 2:04:30.680
 So there's, okay, there is,

2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:34.980
 there's, just that you have a boat that sucks

2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:37.300
 and it's leaking and it's gonna sink.

2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:40.060
 You can fix it with duct tape for a couple of,

2:04:40.060 --> 2:04:42.280
 you know, for one ride or whatever.

2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:43.760
 That's not really fixing the boat,

2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:44.860
 but you can get you by.

2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:47.300
 So there's duct tape solutions.

2:04:47.300 --> 2:04:49.180
 To me, so the panic monster is the character

2:04:49.180 --> 2:04:52.100
 that rushes into the room once the deadline gets too close

2:04:52.100 --> 2:04:54.560
 or once there's some scary external pressure,

2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:55.500
 not just from yourself.

2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:59.140
 And that's a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators.

2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:00.820
 Again, there's a lot of people who won't,

2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:02.140
 you know, do that thing.

2:05:02.140 --> 2:05:03.700
 They've been writing that book they wanted to write,

2:05:03.700 --> 2:05:05.060
 but there's way fewer people

2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:07.100
 who will not show up to the exam.

2:05:07.100 --> 2:05:08.940
 You know, most people show up to the exam.

2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:12.380
 So that's because the panic monster

2:05:12.380 --> 2:05:14.640
 is gonna freak out if they don't.

2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:16.660
 So you can create a panic monster.

2:05:16.660 --> 2:05:19.340
 If you wanna, you know, you really wanna write music,

2:05:19.340 --> 2:05:20.800
 you really wanna become a singer, songwriter,

2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:25.620
 well, book a venue, tell 40 people about it

2:05:25.620 --> 2:05:28.020
 and say, hey, on, you know, this day, two months from now,

2:05:28.020 --> 2:05:30.340
 come and see, I'm gonna play you some of my songs.

2:05:30.340 --> 2:05:31.940
 You now have a panic monster, you're gonna write songs.

2:05:31.940 --> 2:05:33.400
 You're gonna have to, right?

2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:37.460
 So there's duct tape things.

2:05:37.460 --> 2:05:39.100
 You know, you can do things, you know, people do,

2:05:39.100 --> 2:05:41.560
 I've done a lot of this with a friend and I say,

2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:44.620
 if I don't get X done by a week from now,

2:05:44.620 --> 2:05:47.380
 I have to donate a lot of money

2:05:47.380 --> 2:05:48.300
 somewhere I don't wanna donate.

2:05:48.300 --> 2:05:49.460
 And that's, you would put that

2:05:49.460 --> 2:05:51.500
 in the category of duct tape solutions.

2:05:51.500 --> 2:05:55.240
 Yeah, because it's not, why do I need that, right?

2:05:55.240 --> 2:05:56.560
 If I really had solved this,

2:05:56.560 --> 2:05:58.980
 this is something I want to do for me, it's selfish.

2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:01.420
 This is, I just literally just want to be selfish here

2:06:01.420 --> 2:06:02.740
 and do the work I need to do

2:06:02.740 --> 2:06:04.300
 to get the goals I wanna get, right?

2:06:04.300 --> 2:06:07.500
 There's a much, all the incentives

2:06:07.500 --> 2:06:08.580
 should be in the right place.

2:06:08.580 --> 2:06:10.460
 And yet, if I don't say that,

2:06:10.460 --> 2:06:12.060
 it'll be a week from now and I won't have done it.

2:06:12.060 --> 2:06:14.100
 Something weird is going on, there's some resistance,

2:06:14.100 --> 2:06:16.020
 there's some force that is prevent,

2:06:16.020 --> 2:06:17.800
 that is in my own way, right?

2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:21.180
 And so doing something where I have to pay all this money,

2:06:21.180 --> 2:06:22.500
 okay, now I'll panic and I'll do it.

2:06:22.500 --> 2:06:23.940
 So that's duct tape.

2:06:23.940 --> 2:06:27.380
 Fixing the boat is something where I don't have to do that.

2:06:27.380 --> 2:06:29.100
 I just will do the things that I,

2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:33.060
 again, it's not, I'm talking about super crazy work ethic.

2:06:33.060 --> 2:06:36.540
 Just like, for example, okay, I have a lot of examples

2:06:36.540 --> 2:06:40.140
 because I have a serious problem that I've been working on.

2:06:40.140 --> 2:06:41.740
 And in some ways I've gotten really successful

2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:44.740
 at solving it and in other ways I'm still floundering.

2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:45.580
 So.

2:06:45.580 --> 2:06:47.540
 Yeah, the world's greatest duct taper.

2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:49.980
 Yes, well, I'm pretty good at duct taping.

2:06:49.980 --> 2:06:52.420
 I probably could be even better and I'm like, and I'm.

2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:54.860
 You're procrastinating and becoming a better duct taper.

2:06:54.860 --> 2:06:57.540
 Literally, like, yes, there's nothing, I won't.

2:06:57.540 --> 2:07:00.780
 So here's what I know what I should do as a writer, right?

2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:03.640
 It's very obvious to me is that I should wake up.

2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:04.480
 Doesn't have to be crazy,

2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:06.020
 I don't wanna 6 a.m. or anything insane

2:07:06.020 --> 2:07:10.620
 or I'm not gonna be one of those crazy people at 5.30 jogs.

2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:14.380
 I'm gonna wake up at whatever, you know, 7.30, 8, 8.30

2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:17.300
 and I should have a block, like, just say nine to noon

2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:22.900
 where I get up and I just really quick make some coffee

2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:23.740
 and write.

2:07:23.740 --> 2:07:26.900
 It's obvious because all the great writers in history

2:07:26.900 --> 2:07:28.200
 did exactly that, some.

2:07:28.200 --> 2:07:30.140
 Some of them have done that, that's common.

2:07:30.140 --> 2:07:31.520
 There's some that I like these writers,

2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:32.700
 they do the late night sessions,

2:07:32.700 --> 2:07:33.540
 but most of them they do wake up.

2:07:33.540 --> 2:07:36.280
 But there's a session, but there's a session that's.

2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:38.460
 Most writers write in the morning and there's a reason.

2:07:38.460 --> 2:07:41.060
 I don't think I'm different than those people.

2:07:41.060 --> 2:07:43.780
 It's a great time to write, you're fresh, right?

2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:46.820
 Your ideas from dreaming have kind of collected,

2:07:46.820 --> 2:07:48.540
 you have all, you know, new answers

2:07:48.540 --> 2:07:51.140
 that you didn't have yesterday and you can just go.

2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:53.340
 But more importantly, if I just had a routine

2:07:53.340 --> 2:07:58.000
 where I wrote from nine to noon, weekdays.

2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.260
 Every week would have a minimum of 15 focused hours

2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:04.700
 of writing, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.

2:08:04.700 --> 2:08:06.940
 A 15, 15, no, this is no joke.

2:08:06.940 --> 2:08:09.600
 This is, you know, you're not, your phone's away,

2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:11.660
 you're not talking to anyone, you're not opening your email,

2:08:11.660 --> 2:08:14.100
 you are focused writing for three hours, five.

2:08:14.100 --> 2:08:16.580
 That's a big week for most writers, right?

2:08:16.580 --> 2:08:18.820
 So now what's happening is that every weekday

2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:21.460
 is a minimum of a B, I'll give myself.

2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:23.100
 You know, an A might be, you know, wow,

2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:24.960
 I really just got into a flow and wrote for six hours

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:26.080
 and had, you know, great.

2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:28.700
 But it's a minimum of a B, I can keep going if I want.

2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:31.380
 And every week is a minimum of a B with those 15 hours.

2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:32.980
 Right, and if I just had, talk about compiling,

2:08:32.980 --> 2:08:34.300
 if I, this is the two pages a week.

2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:37.060
 If I just did that every week,

2:08:37.060 --> 2:08:39.020
 I'd achieve all my writing goals in my life.

2:08:39.020 --> 2:08:42.620
 And yet I wake up and most days I just,

2:08:42.620 --> 2:08:44.900
 either I'll revenge procrastination late at night

2:08:44.900 --> 2:08:46.380
 and go to bed way too late and then wake up later

2:08:46.380 --> 2:08:47.860
 and get on a bad schedule and I just fall

2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:48.700
 into these bad schedules.

2:08:48.700 --> 2:08:50.740
 Or I'll wake up and there's just, you know,

2:08:50.740 --> 2:08:52.940
 I'll say I was gonna do a few emails and I'll open it up

2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:54.900
 and I'm suddenly on text and I'm texting.

2:08:54.900 --> 2:08:56.860
 Or I'll just go and, you know, I'll make a phone call

2:08:56.860 --> 2:08:58.220
 and I'll be on phone calls for three hours.

2:08:58.220 --> 2:08:59.420
 It's always something.

2:08:59.420 --> 2:09:00.260
 Yeah, yeah.

2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:02.100
 Or I'll start writing and then I hit a little bit of a wall,

2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:03.420
 but because there's no sacred,

2:09:03.420 --> 2:09:05.300
 this is a sacred writing block,

2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:07.540
 I'll just hit the wall and say, well, this is icky

2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:08.900
 and I'll go do something else.

2:09:08.900 --> 2:09:11.400
 So duct tape, what I've done is,

2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:14.460
 White But Why has one employee, Alisha.

2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:16.100
 She's the manager of lots of things.

2:09:16.100 --> 2:09:17.300
 That's her role.

2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:19.020
 She truly does lots of things.

2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:24.020
 And one of the things we started doing is,

2:09:24.020 --> 2:09:25.980
 either she comes over and sits next to me

2:09:25.980 --> 2:09:29.300
 where she can see my screen from nine to noon.

2:09:29.300 --> 2:09:30.120
 That's all it takes.

2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:31.580
 The thing about procrastination is there's usually,

2:09:31.580 --> 2:09:32.880
 they're not kicking and screaming.

2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:33.760
 I don't want to do this.

2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:35.300
 It's the feeling of, you know, in the old days

2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:36.780
 when you had to go to class,

2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:38.540
 you know, your lunch block is over and it's like,

2:09:38.540 --> 2:09:40.100
 oh, shit, I have class in five minutes.

2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:42.600
 Or it's Monday morning, you go, oh.

2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:43.440
 Yeah.

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:44.260
 But you said, you know what?

2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:45.100
 But you go, you say, okay.

2:09:45.100 --> 2:09:46.500
 And then you get to class and it's not that bad

2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:48.260
 once you're there, right?

2:09:48.260 --> 2:09:49.900
 You know, you have a trainer and he says, okay, next set.

2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:50.860
 And you go, oh, okay.

2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:51.700
 And you do it.

2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:52.520
 That's all it is.

2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:55.420
 It's someone, some external thing being like,

2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:56.340
 okay, I have to do this.

2:09:56.340 --> 2:09:58.300
 And then you have that moment of like, it sucks,

2:09:58.300 --> 2:09:59.220
 but I guess I'll do it.

2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:03.340
 If no one's there though, the problem with the procrastinator

2:10:03.340 --> 2:10:04.180
 is they don't have that person in their head.

2:10:04.180 --> 2:10:05.500
 Other people I think were raised with a sense of shame

2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:06.340
 if they don't do stuff.

2:10:06.340 --> 2:10:09.740
 And that stick in their head is hugely helpful.

2:10:09.740 --> 2:10:11.020
 I don't really have that.

2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:14.180
 And so anyway, Alicia is sitting there next to me.

2:10:15.140 --> 2:10:17.180
 So she's doing her own work, but she can see my screen

2:10:17.180 --> 2:10:19.620
 and she of all people knows exactly what I should be doing,

2:10:19.620 --> 2:10:21.260
 what I shouldn't be doing.

2:10:21.260 --> 2:10:22.500
 That's all it takes.

2:10:22.500 --> 2:10:24.780
 The shame of just having her see me

2:10:24.780 --> 2:10:26.020
 while she's sitting there not working

2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:27.740
 would just be too, it's too weird and too embarrassing.

2:10:27.740 --> 2:10:29.700
 So I get it done and it's amazing.

2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:31.580
 It's a game changer for me.

2:10:31.580 --> 2:10:34.740
 So duct tape can solve, sometimes duct tape is enough,

2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:39.260
 but I'm curious to, I'm still trying to, what is going on?

2:10:39.260 --> 2:10:40.100
 Yeah.

2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:43.580
 I think part of it is that we are actually wired.

2:10:43.580 --> 2:10:47.220
 I think I'm being very sane human actually

2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:48.060
 is what's happening.

2:10:48.060 --> 2:10:48.880
 Or not sane is not the right word.

2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:52.020
 I'm being like, I'm being a natural human

2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:55.500
 that we are not programmed to sit there and do homework

2:10:55.500 --> 2:10:58.620
 of a certain kind that we get the results like

2:10:58.620 --> 2:10:59.660
 six months later.

2:10:59.660 --> 2:11:03.120
 Like that is not, so we're supposed to conserve energy

2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:05.060
 and fulfill our needs as we need them

2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:06.700
 and do immediate things.

2:11:06.700 --> 2:11:10.300
 And we're overriding our natural ways

2:11:10.300 --> 2:11:12.060
 when we wake up and get to it.

2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:14.500
 And I think sometimes it's because the pain,

2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:15.980
 I think a lot of times we're just avoiding suffering

2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:18.580
 and for a lot of people, the pain of not doing it

2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:20.660
 is actually worse because they feel shame.

2:11:20.660 --> 2:11:22.220
 So if they don't get up and take a jog

2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:23.580
 and get up early and get to work,

2:11:23.580 --> 2:11:25.820
 I'll feel like a bad person.

2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:28.060
 And that is worse than doing those things.

2:11:28.060 --> 2:11:29.500
 And then it becomes a habit eventually

2:11:29.500 --> 2:11:31.380
 and it becomes just easy automatic.

2:11:31.380 --> 2:11:33.280
 It becomes I do it because that's what I do.

2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:35.100
 But I think that if you don't have a lot of shame

2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:38.020
 necessarily, the pain of doing those things

2:11:38.020 --> 2:11:42.260
 is worse in the immediate moment than not doing it.

2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:44.100
 But I think that there's this feeling

2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:46.280
 that you capture with your body language

2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:50.100
 and so on, like I don't want to do another set.

2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:53.540
 That feeling, the people I've seen that are good

2:11:53.540 --> 2:11:55.460
 at not procrastinating are the ones

2:11:55.460 --> 2:11:58.580
 that have trained themselves to like the moment

2:11:58.580 --> 2:12:00.020
 they would be having that feeling.

2:12:00.020 --> 2:12:03.800
 They just, it's like Zen, like Sam Harris style Zen.

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:05.580
 You don't experience that feeling.

2:12:05.580 --> 2:12:06.940
 You just march forward.

2:12:06.940 --> 2:12:09.820
 Like I talked to Elon about this a lot actually offline.

2:12:09.820 --> 2:12:11.700
 It's like, he doesn't have this.

2:12:11.700 --> 2:12:12.900
 No, clearly not.

2:12:12.900 --> 2:12:16.060
 It's the way I think, at least he talks about it

2:12:16.060 --> 2:12:18.060
 and the way I think about it is it's like

2:12:18.060 --> 2:12:21.620
 you just pretend you're like a machine running an algorithm.

2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:24.580
 Like you know this, you should be doing this.

2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:26.100
 Not because somebody told you so on.

2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:28.520
 This is probably the thing you want to do.

2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:30.420
 Like look at the big picture of your life

2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:31.580
 and just run the algorithm.

2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:33.540
 Like ignore your feelings, just run as if.

2:12:33.540 --> 2:12:35.260
 But it's framing, frame it differently.

2:12:35.260 --> 2:12:36.100
 Yeah.

2:12:36.100 --> 2:12:38.020
 You know, yeah, you can frame it as like,

2:12:38.020 --> 2:12:40.800
 it can feel like homework or it can feel like

2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:42.420
 you're like, you're living your best life

2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:43.940
 or something when you're doing your work.

2:12:43.940 --> 2:12:46.380
 Yeah, and maybe reframe it.

2:12:46.380 --> 2:12:48.580
 But I think ultimately is whatever reframing

2:12:48.580 --> 2:12:52.340
 you need to do, you just need to do it for a few weeks.

2:12:52.340 --> 2:12:56.980
 And that's how the habit is formed and you stick with it.

2:12:56.980 --> 2:13:01.980
 Like I'm now on a kick where I exercise every day.

2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:06.180
 It doesn't matter what that exercise is.

2:13:06.180 --> 2:13:07.420
 It's not serious.

2:13:07.420 --> 2:13:11.060
 It could be 200 pushups, but it's the thing that like

2:13:11.060 --> 2:13:12.380
 I make sure I exercise every day

2:13:12.380 --> 2:13:15.540
 and it's become way, way easier because of the habit.

2:13:15.540 --> 2:13:19.660
 And I just, and I don't like, at least with exercise

2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:22.140
 because it's easier to replicate that feeling.

2:13:22.140 --> 2:13:24.420
 I don't allow myself to go like,

2:13:24.420 --> 2:13:25.340
 I don't feel like doing this.

2:13:25.340 --> 2:13:26.180
 Right.

2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:27.460
 Well, I think about that, even just like little things,

2:13:27.460 --> 2:13:29.260
 like I brush my teeth before I go to bed

2:13:29.260 --> 2:13:30.260
 and it's just a habit.

2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:31.100
 Yeah.

2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:31.940
 And it is effort.

2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:34.340
 Like if it were something else, I would be like,

2:13:34.340 --> 2:13:35.860
 oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom and go do that.

2:13:35.860 --> 2:13:37.660
 And I just want to like, I'm just gonna lie down right now.

2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:38.860
 But it doesn't even cross my mind.

2:13:38.860 --> 2:13:41.380
 It's just like that I just robotically go and do it.

2:13:41.380 --> 2:13:42.220
 Yeah.

2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:43.640
 And it almost has become like a nice routine.

2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:44.940
 It's like, oh, this part of the night, you know,

2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:47.500
 it's like a morning routine for me stuff is like,

2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:50.060
 you know, that stuff is kind of just like automated.

2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:52.700
 Yeah, it's funny because you don't like go,

2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:54.460
 like I don't think I've skipped many days.

2:13:54.460 --> 2:13:56.540
 I don't think I skipped any days brushing my teeth.

2:13:56.540 --> 2:13:57.380
 Right.

2:13:57.380 --> 2:13:59.080
 Like unless I didn't have a toothbrush,

2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:00.620
 like I was in the woods or something.

2:14:00.620 --> 2:14:01.440
 And what is that?

2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:02.280
 Because it's annoying.

2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:04.420
 Well, so to me, there is,

2:14:04.420 --> 2:14:06.100
 so the character that makes me procrastinate

2:14:06.100 --> 2:14:08.140
 is the instant gratification monkey.

2:14:08.140 --> 2:14:09.540
 That's what I've labeled him, right?

2:14:09.540 --> 2:14:11.260
 And there's the rational decision maker

2:14:11.260 --> 2:14:12.420
 and the instant gratification monkey

2:14:12.420 --> 2:14:14.160
 and these battle with each other.

2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:18.060
 But for procrastinator, the monkey wins.

2:14:18.060 --> 2:14:18.900
 Yeah.

2:14:18.900 --> 2:14:20.780
 I don't think the monkey is, you know,

2:14:20.780 --> 2:14:21.820
 you read about this kind of stuff.

2:14:21.820 --> 2:14:25.900
 I think that this kind of more primitive brain

2:14:25.900 --> 2:14:26.820
 is always winning.

2:14:26.820 --> 2:14:28.180
 And in the non procrastinators,

2:14:28.180 --> 2:14:30.580
 that primitive brain is on board for some reason

2:14:31.780 --> 2:14:32.660
 and isn't resisting.

2:14:32.660 --> 2:14:35.080
 So, but when I think about brushing my teeth,

2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:36.700
 it's like the monkey doesn't even think

2:14:36.700 --> 2:14:38.520
 there's an option to not do it.

2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:40.380
 So it doesn't even like get, there's no hope.

2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:41.820
 Monkey has no hope there.

2:14:41.820 --> 2:14:43.140
 So it doesn't even like get involved.

2:14:43.140 --> 2:14:44.340
 And it's just like, yeah, you know, we have to,

2:14:44.340 --> 2:14:46.820
 just like kind of like robotically, just like, you know,

2:14:46.820 --> 2:14:48.060
 it was kind of like Stockholm syndrome,

2:14:48.060 --> 2:14:50.460
 just like, oh no, no, I have to do this.

2:14:50.460 --> 2:14:51.820
 It doesn't even like wake up.

2:14:51.820 --> 2:14:53.220
 It's like, yeah, we're doing this now.

2:14:53.220 --> 2:14:54.940
 For other things, the monkey's like, ooh, no, no, no.

2:14:54.940 --> 2:14:56.820
 Most days I can win this one.

2:14:56.820 --> 2:15:01.820
 And so the monkey puts up that like fierce resistance

2:15:01.820 --> 2:15:03.860
 and it's like, it's a lot of it's like

2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:05.660
 the initial transition.

2:15:05.660 --> 2:15:09.060
 So I think of it as like jumping in a cold pool

2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:12.580
 where it's like, I will spend the whole day

2:15:12.580 --> 2:15:15.100
 pacing around the side of the pool in my bathing suit,

2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:17.580
 just being like, I don't want to have that one second

2:15:17.580 --> 2:15:18.780
 when you first jump in and it sucks.

2:15:18.780 --> 2:15:20.860
 And then once you're, once I'm in,

2:15:20.860 --> 2:15:21.860
 once I jump in, I'm usually, you know,

2:15:21.860 --> 2:15:23.540
 once I start writing, I'm suddenly I'm like,

2:15:23.540 --> 2:15:24.640
 oh, this isn't so bad.

2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:25.480
 Okay, I'm kind of into it.

2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:27.020
 And then I, then sometimes you can't tear me away.

2:15:27.020 --> 2:15:29.340
 You know, then I suddenly I'm like, I get into a flow.

2:15:29.340 --> 2:15:31.380
 So it's like, once I get into cold water, I don't mind it,

2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:34.900
 but I will spend hours standing around the side of the pool.

2:15:34.900 --> 2:15:36.820
 And by the way, I do this in a more literal sense.

2:15:36.820 --> 2:15:40.440
 When I go to the gym with a trainer in 45 minutes,

2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:41.960
 I do a full full ass workout.

2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:44.820
 And it's not because I'm having a good time,

2:15:44.820 --> 2:15:47.420
 but it's because it's that,

2:15:47.420 --> 2:15:49.080
 oh, okay, I have to go to class feeling, right?

2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:50.540
 But when I go to the gym alone,

2:15:50.540 --> 2:15:55.460
 I will literally do a set and then dick around my phone

2:15:55.460 --> 2:15:57.380
 for 10 minutes before the next set.

2:15:57.380 --> 2:15:59.660
 And I'll spend an over an hour there and do way less.

2:15:59.660 --> 2:16:01.940
 So it is the transition.

2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:03.140
 Once I'm actually doing the set,

2:16:03.140 --> 2:16:04.460
 I'm never like, I don't want to stop in the middle.

2:16:04.460 --> 2:16:05.560
 Now it's just like, I'm going to do this.

2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:07.020
 And I felt happy, I just did it.

2:16:07.020 --> 2:16:07.860
 So it's something,

2:16:07.860 --> 2:16:09.580
 there's something about transitions that is very,

2:16:09.580 --> 2:16:12.980
 that's why procrastinators are late a lot of places.

2:16:12.980 --> 2:16:14.940
 It's, I will procrastinate getting ready

2:16:14.940 --> 2:16:15.940
 to go to the airport,

2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:18.240
 even though I know I should leave at three,

2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:19.220
 so I can not be stressed.

2:16:19.220 --> 2:16:22.420
 I'll leave at 3.36 and I'll be super stressed.

2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:24.700
 Once I'm on the way to the airport,

2:16:24.700 --> 2:16:26.340
 immediately I'm like, why didn't I do this earlier?

2:16:26.340 --> 2:16:28.660
 Now I'm back on my phone doing what I was doing.

2:16:28.660 --> 2:16:31.280
 I just had to get in the damn car or whatever.

2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.440
 So yeah, there's some very, very odd irrational.

2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:38.640
 Yeah, like I was waiting for you to come

2:16:38.640 --> 2:16:40.500
 and you said that you're running a few minutes late.

2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:45.500
 And I was like, I was like, I'll go get you a coffee

2:16:45.620 --> 2:16:49.100
 because I can't possibly be the one who's early.

2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:50.460
 I can't, I don't understand.

2:16:50.460 --> 2:16:51.820
 I'm always late to stuff.

2:16:51.820 --> 2:16:54.060
 And I know it's disrespectful

2:16:54.060 --> 2:16:55.340
 in the eyes of a lot of people.

2:16:55.340 --> 2:16:58.200
 I can't help, you know what I'm doing ahead of it?

2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:00.180
 It's not like I don't care about the people.

2:17:00.180 --> 2:17:03.060
 I'm often like, you know, for like this conversation,

2:17:03.060 --> 2:17:04.360
 I'd be preparing more.

2:17:05.620 --> 2:17:08.220
 It's like, I obviously care about the person,

2:17:08.220 --> 2:17:09.060
 but for some.

2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:10.500
 Yeah, it's misinterpreted as like,

2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:13.060
 there are some people that like show up late

2:17:13.060 --> 2:17:15.880
 because they kind of like that quality in themselves.

2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:16.720
 That's a dick, right?

2:17:16.720 --> 2:17:17.680
 There's a lot of those people,

2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:20.340
 but more often it's someone who shows up frazzled

2:17:20.340 --> 2:17:22.780
 and they feel awful and they're furious at themselves.

2:17:22.780 --> 2:17:23.620
 They're so regretful.

2:17:23.620 --> 2:17:24.440
 Exactly.

2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:25.280
 I mean, that's me.

2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:27.800
 And I mean, all you have to do is look at those people alone

2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:29.820
 running through the airport, right?

2:17:29.820 --> 2:17:31.180
 They're not being disrespectful to anyone there.

2:17:31.180 --> 2:17:33.100
 They just inflicted this on themselves.

2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:33.940
 Like.

2:17:33.940 --> 2:17:34.760
 This is hilarious.

2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:35.600
 Yeah.

2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:38.660
 You tweeted a quote by James Baldwin saying, quote,

2:17:38.660 --> 2:17:41.600
 I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates

2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:46.600
 so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone,

2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:49.580
 they will be forced to deal with the pain.

2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:53.820
 What has been a painful but formative experience

2:17:53.820 --> 2:17:55.300
 in your life?

2:17:55.300 --> 2:17:58.040
 Or what's the flavor, the shape of your pain

2:17:58.040 --> 2:17:59.000
 that fuels you?

2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:02.660
 I mean, honestly, the first thing that jumped to mind

2:18:02.660 --> 2:18:06.260
 is my own like battles against myself to get my work done

2:18:06.260 --> 2:18:07.660
 because it affects everything.

2:18:07.660 --> 2:18:09.700
 When I, I just took five years in this book

2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:11.220
 and granted it's a beast.

2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:13.380
 Like I probably would have taken two or three years,

2:18:13.380 --> 2:18:14.480
 but it didn't need to take five.

2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:16.620
 And that was a lot of, not just, you know,

2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:17.860
 not just that I'm not working,

2:18:17.860 --> 2:18:19.880
 it's that I'm over researching.

2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:22.380
 I'm making it, I'm adding in things I shouldn't

2:18:22.380 --> 2:18:23.820
 because I'm perfectionist, you know,

2:18:23.820 --> 2:18:25.660
 being a perfectionist about like, oh, well I learned that.

2:18:25.660 --> 2:18:26.820
 Now I want to get it in there.

2:18:26.820 --> 2:18:28.020
 I know I'm going to end up cutting it later.

2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:30.940
 Just, you know, or I over outline, you know,

2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:32.660
 something until, you know, trying to get it perfect

2:18:32.660 --> 2:18:33.940
 when I know that's not possible.

2:18:33.940 --> 2:18:36.660
 So making a lot of immature kind of,

2:18:36.660 --> 2:18:38.780
 like, I'm not actually that much of a writing amateur.

2:18:38.780 --> 2:18:40.660
 I've written, including my old blog,

2:18:40.660 --> 2:18:42.260
 I've been a writer for 15 years.

2:18:42.260 --> 2:18:43.260
 I know what I'm doing.

2:18:43.260 --> 2:18:45.900
 I could advise other writers really well.

2:18:45.900 --> 2:18:47.900
 And yet I do a bunch of amateur things

2:18:47.900 --> 2:18:50.260
 that I know while I'm doing them is an,

2:18:50.260 --> 2:18:51.220
 I know I'm being an amateur.

2:18:51.220 --> 2:18:55.580
 So that A, it hurts the actual product.

2:18:55.580 --> 2:18:59.340
 It makes, you know, B, it's waste your precious time.

2:18:59.340 --> 2:19:01.780
 C, when you're mad at yourself,

2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:04.780
 when you're in a negative, you know,

2:19:04.780 --> 2:19:08.140
 self defeating spiral, it almost inevitably will,

2:19:08.140 --> 2:19:09.980
 you'll be less good to others.

2:19:09.980 --> 2:19:12.260
 Like, you know, I'll just, just, I used to, you know,

2:19:12.260 --> 2:19:15.620
 early on in my now marriage,

2:19:15.620 --> 2:19:17.220
 one of the things we always used to do

2:19:17.220 --> 2:19:18.980
 is I used to plan mystery dates.

2:19:18.980 --> 2:19:20.820
 You know, New York city, great, great place for this.

2:19:20.820 --> 2:19:22.980
 I'd find some weird little adventure for us.

2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:24.700
 You know, it could be anything.

2:19:24.700 --> 2:19:25.700
 And I wouldn't tell her what it was.

2:19:25.700 --> 2:19:27.500
 I said, I reserving you for Thursday night,

2:19:27.500 --> 2:19:29.060
 you know, at seven, okay?

2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:31.420
 And it was such a fun part of our relationship.

2:19:31.420 --> 2:19:33.860
 Started writing this book and got into a really bad,

2:19:33.860 --> 2:19:36.380
 you know, personal space where I was like, in my head,

2:19:36.380 --> 2:19:38.220
 I was like, I can't do anything until this is done.

2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:39.100
 You know, like, no.

2:19:39.100 --> 2:19:41.620
 And I just stopped like ever valuing,

2:19:41.620 --> 2:19:44.220
 like, like joy of any kind.

2:19:44.220 --> 2:19:47.140
 Like I was like, no, any, no, that's when I'm done.

2:19:47.140 --> 2:19:49.900
 And that's a trap or very quickly, you know,

2:19:49.900 --> 2:19:50.740
 cause I always think, you know,

2:19:50.740 --> 2:19:51.940
 I think it's going to be a six months away,

2:19:51.940 --> 2:19:53.780
 but actually five years later, I'm like, wow,

2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:55.780
 I really wasn't living fully.

2:19:55.780 --> 2:19:58.260
 And for five years is not, we don't live very long.

2:19:58.260 --> 2:19:59.820
 Like talking about your prime decades,

2:19:59.820 --> 2:20:01.780
 like that's like a sixth of my prime years.

2:20:01.780 --> 2:20:04.860
 Like, wow, like that's a huge loss.

2:20:04.860 --> 2:20:06.260
 So to me, that was excruciating.

2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:10.020
 And, you know, and it was a bad pattern,

2:20:10.020 --> 2:20:12.980
 a very unproductive, unhelpful pattern for me,

2:20:12.980 --> 2:20:15.540
 which is I'd wake up in the morning in this great mood,

2:20:15.540 --> 2:20:18.100
 great mood every morning, wake up thrilled to be awake.

2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:19.380
 I have the whole day ahead of me.

2:20:19.380 --> 2:20:21.180
 I'm going to get so much work done today.

2:20:21.180 --> 2:20:23.580
 And, but you know, first I'm going to do all these other

2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:24.620
 things and it's all going to be great.

2:20:24.620 --> 2:20:27.860
 And then I ended up kind of failing for the day

2:20:27.860 --> 2:20:30.260
 with those goals, sometimes miserably,

2:20:30.260 --> 2:20:31.900
 sometimes only partially.

2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:35.300
 And then I get in bed probably a couple hours later

2:20:35.300 --> 2:20:36.140
 than I want to.

2:20:36.140 --> 2:20:39.020
 And that's when all of the real reality hits me.

2:20:39.020 --> 2:20:42.020
 Suddenly so much regret, so much anxiety,

2:20:42.020 --> 2:20:44.700
 furious at myself, wishing I could take a time machine back

2:20:44.700 --> 2:20:46.700
 three months, six months a year,

2:20:46.700 --> 2:20:48.980
 or just even to the beginning of that day.

2:20:48.980 --> 2:20:51.900
 And just tossing and turning now.

2:20:51.900 --> 2:20:53.140
 I mean, this is a very bad place.

2:20:53.140 --> 2:20:54.260
 This is what I said, suffering,

2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:56.740
 procrastinators suffer in a very serious way.

2:20:56.740 --> 2:20:58.300
 So look, I, you know,

2:20:58.300 --> 2:21:01.260
 I know this probably sounds like a lot of like first world

2:21:01.260 --> 2:21:03.540
 problems and it is, but it's real suffering as well.

2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:06.900
 Like it's, so to me, it's like,

2:21:06.900 --> 2:21:11.500
 it's painful because you're not being,

2:21:11.500 --> 2:21:13.740
 you're not being as good a friend or a spouse or whatever,

2:21:13.740 --> 2:21:14.580
 as you could be.

2:21:14.580 --> 2:21:16.060
 You're also not treating yourself very well.

2:21:16.060 --> 2:21:17.900
 You're usually not being very healthy in these moments.

2:21:17.900 --> 2:21:20.300
 You know, you're often, and you're not being,

2:21:20.300 --> 2:21:21.420
 I'm not being good to my readers.

2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:22.940
 So it's just a lot of this.

2:21:22.940 --> 2:21:27.260
 And it's like, it feels like it's one small tweak away.

2:21:27.260 --> 2:21:28.580
 Sometimes it's like, that's what I said.

2:21:28.580 --> 2:21:31.180
 It's like, you just suddenly are just doing that nine to 12

2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:32.260
 and you get in that habit.

2:21:32.260 --> 2:21:33.660
 Everything else falls into place.

2:21:33.660 --> 2:21:35.380
 All of this reverses.

2:21:35.380 --> 2:21:39.020
 So I feel hopeful, but it's like, it is a,

2:21:39.020 --> 2:21:41.180
 I have not figured, I haven't fixed the boat yet.

2:21:41.180 --> 2:21:43.380
 I have some good duct tape though.

2:21:43.380 --> 2:21:45.420
 And you also don't want to romanticize it

2:21:45.420 --> 2:21:48.420
 because it is true that some of the greats in history,

2:21:48.420 --> 2:21:51.220
 especially writers suffer from all the same stuff.

2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:52.780
 Like they weren't quite able.

2:21:52.780 --> 2:21:56.620
 I mean, you might only write for two or three hours a day,

2:21:56.620 --> 2:22:00.620
 but the rest of the day is often spent kind of tortured.

2:22:00.620 --> 2:22:01.460
 Well, right.

2:22:01.460 --> 2:22:03.500
 This is the irrational thing is if I,

2:22:03.500 --> 2:22:05.060
 and this goes for a lot of people's jobs,

2:22:05.060 --> 2:22:07.180
 people especially who work for themselves,

2:22:07.180 --> 2:22:10.220
 you'd be shocked how much you could wake up at nine

2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:11.980
 or eight or seven or whatever.

2:22:11.980 --> 2:22:13.340
 Get to work and stop at one,

2:22:13.340 --> 2:22:15.420
 but you're really focused in those hours.

2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:20.060
 One or two and do 25 really focused hours of stuff,

2:22:20.060 --> 2:22:23.420
 product stuff a week, and then there's 112 waking hours

2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:24.260
 in the week, right?

2:22:24.260 --> 2:22:27.180
 So we're talking about 80 something hours of free time.

2:22:27.180 --> 2:22:29.500
 You can live, you know, if you're just really focused

2:22:29.500 --> 2:22:31.380
 in your, you know, yin and yang of your time,

2:22:31.380 --> 2:22:34.100
 and that's what, that's my goal is black and white time.

2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:37.260
 I really focused time and then totally like

2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:39.420
 clean conscience free time.

2:22:39.420 --> 2:22:40.740
 Right now I have neither, it's a lot of gray.

2:22:40.740 --> 2:22:42.380
 It's a lot of, I should be working, but I'm not.

2:22:42.380 --> 2:22:43.660
 Oh, I'm wasting this time.

2:22:43.660 --> 2:22:44.500
 This is bad.

2:22:44.500 --> 2:22:45.580
 And that's just as massive.

2:22:45.580 --> 2:22:49.060
 So if you can just get really good at the black

2:22:49.060 --> 2:22:50.340
 and the white, so you just wake up

2:22:50.340 --> 2:22:51.580
 and it's just like full work.

2:22:51.580 --> 2:22:53.420
 And then I think a lot of people could have

2:22:53.420 --> 2:22:54.260
 like all this free time,

2:22:54.260 --> 2:22:55.860
 but instead I'll do those same three hours.

2:22:55.860 --> 2:22:57.660
 It's like you said, I'll do them really late at night

2:22:57.660 --> 2:23:00.100
 or whatever after having tortured myself the whole day

2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:01.020
 and not had any fun.

2:23:01.020 --> 2:23:03.100
 It's not like I'm having fun.

2:23:03.100 --> 2:23:04.580
 I call it the dark playground, by the way,

2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:06.820
 which is where you are when you know you should be working,

2:23:06.820 --> 2:23:08.660
 but you're doing something else.

2:23:08.660 --> 2:23:10.740
 You're doing something fun on paper,

2:23:10.740 --> 2:23:12.700
 but it's never, it feels awful.

2:23:12.700 --> 2:23:14.580
 And so, yeah, I spend a lot of time in the dark.

2:23:14.580 --> 2:23:16.020
 And you know you shouldn't be doing it

2:23:16.020 --> 2:23:18.060
 and you still do it and yeah.

2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:19.380
 It's not clean conscience fun.

2:23:19.380 --> 2:23:21.300
 It's bad, it's toxic.

2:23:21.300 --> 2:23:23.740
 And I think that it's, there's something about,

2:23:23.740 --> 2:23:25.380
 you know, you're draining yourself all the time.

2:23:25.380 --> 2:23:26.780
 And if you just did your focused hours

2:23:26.780 --> 2:23:28.740
 and then if you actually have good, clean fun,

2:23:28.740 --> 2:23:29.580
 fun can be anything.

2:23:29.580 --> 2:23:31.420
 Reading a book can be hanging out with someone

2:23:31.420 --> 2:23:32.260
 who can be really fun.

2:23:32.260 --> 2:23:33.860
 You can go and do something cool in the city.

2:23:33.860 --> 2:23:37.020
 You know, that is critical.

2:23:37.020 --> 2:23:39.020
 You're recharging some part of your psyche there.

2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:39.940
 And I think it makes it easier

2:23:39.940 --> 2:23:40.940
 to actually work the next day.

2:23:40.940 --> 2:23:42.460
 And I say this from the experiences

2:23:42.460 --> 2:23:44.260
 when I have had good stretches.

2:23:44.260 --> 2:23:46.660
 It's like, you know what it is?

2:23:46.660 --> 2:23:48.380
 It's like, you feel like you're fist pounding.

2:23:48.380 --> 2:23:50.340
 One part of your brain is fist pounding the other part.

2:23:50.340 --> 2:23:52.540
 Like, you're like, we got this.

2:23:52.540 --> 2:23:54.820
 Like, we treat ourselves well.

2:23:54.820 --> 2:23:56.060
 Like, this is how you internally feel.

2:23:56.060 --> 2:23:56.980
 Like, I treat myself.

2:23:56.980 --> 2:23:58.380
 And it's like, yeah, no, it's work time.

2:23:58.380 --> 2:23:59.820
 And then later you're like, now it's play time.

2:23:59.820 --> 2:24:00.980
 And it's like, okay, back to work.

2:24:00.980 --> 2:24:02.180
 And you're in this very healthy,

2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:04.100
 like parent child relationship in your head

2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:06.940
 versus like this constant conflict.

2:24:06.940 --> 2:24:08.660
 And like the kid doesn't respect the parent

2:24:08.660 --> 2:24:09.500
 and the parent hates the kid.

2:24:09.500 --> 2:24:10.980
 And like, yeah.

2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:11.820
 And you're right.

2:24:11.820 --> 2:24:14.540
 It always feels like it's like one fix away.

2:24:14.540 --> 2:24:15.860
 So that there's hope.

2:24:15.860 --> 2:24:18.580
 I mean, I guess, I mean,

2:24:18.580 --> 2:24:21.660
 so much of what you said just rings so true.

2:24:21.660 --> 2:24:24.180
 I guess I have the same kind of hope.

2:24:24.180 --> 2:24:27.660
 But you know, this podcast is very regular.

2:24:27.660 --> 2:24:29.060
 I mean, I'm impressed.

2:24:29.060 --> 2:24:32.420
 Like, and I think partially what,

2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:34.340
 there is a bit of a duct tape solution here,

2:24:34.340 --> 2:24:36.380
 which is you just, the,

2:24:36.380 --> 2:24:37.700
 cause it's always easy to schedule stuff

2:24:37.700 --> 2:24:39.060
 for the future for myself, right?

2:24:39.060 --> 2:24:40.020
 Because that's future Tim

2:24:40.020 --> 2:24:42.460
 and future Tim is not my problem.

2:24:42.460 --> 2:24:44.740
 So I'll schedule all kinds of shit for future Tim.

2:24:44.740 --> 2:24:48.300
 And I will then not do it.

2:24:48.300 --> 2:24:49.220
 But in this case,

2:24:49.220 --> 2:24:52.940
 you can schedule podcasts and you have to show up.

2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:53.780
 Yeah, you have to show up.

2:24:53.780 --> 2:24:55.740
 Right, it seems like a good medium for procrastinating.

2:24:55.740 --> 2:24:57.940
 This is not my, this is what I do for fun.

2:24:57.940 --> 2:25:00.460
 I know, but at least this is the kind of thing,

2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:02.500
 especially if it's not your main thing.

2:25:02.500 --> 2:25:03.460
 Especially if it's not your main thing,

2:25:03.460 --> 2:25:05.020
 it's the kind of thing that you would dream of doing

2:25:05.020 --> 2:25:06.380
 and want to do and never do.

2:25:06.380 --> 2:25:10.020
 And I feel like your regular production here

2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:12.140
 is a sign that something is working,

2:25:12.140 --> 2:25:13.300
 at least in this regard.

2:25:13.300 --> 2:25:14.140
 Yeah, in this regard.

2:25:14.140 --> 2:25:16.380
 I'm just, I'm sure you have this same kind of thing

2:25:16.380 --> 2:25:17.220
 with the podcast.

2:25:17.220 --> 2:25:18.980
 In fact, because you're going to be doing the podcast,

2:25:18.980 --> 2:25:22.660
 as possible, the podcast becomes what the podcast is for me.

2:25:22.660 --> 2:25:24.380
 This is you procrastinating.

2:25:24.380 --> 2:25:25.660
 If you think about being 80

2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:27.380
 and if you can get into that person's head

2:25:27.380 --> 2:25:29.700
 and look back and be like, and just deep regret,

2:25:29.700 --> 2:25:31.460
 you just, you know, yearning,

2:25:31.460 --> 2:25:33.220
 you could do anything to just go back

2:25:33.220 --> 2:25:34.660
 and have done this differently.

2:25:34.660 --> 2:25:36.060
 That is desperation.

2:25:36.060 --> 2:25:37.100
 It's just, you don't feel it yet.

2:25:37.100 --> 2:25:38.700
 It's not in you yet.

2:25:38.700 --> 2:25:40.260
 The other thing you could do is if you have a partner,

2:25:40.260 --> 2:25:41.300
 if you want to partner with someone,

2:25:41.300 --> 2:25:43.380
 now you could say, we meet.

2:25:43.380 --> 2:25:44.980
 These 15 hours every week.

2:25:44.980 --> 2:25:46.380
 And that point you're going to get it done.

2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:48.900
 So working with someone can help.

2:25:48.900 --> 2:25:51.220
 Yeah, that's why they say like a co founder

2:25:51.220 --> 2:25:52.740
 is really powerful for many reasons,

2:25:52.740 --> 2:25:54.500
 but that's kind of one of them.

2:25:54.500 --> 2:25:56.980
 Because to actually, for the startup case,

2:25:57.900 --> 2:26:00.860
 you, unlike writing perhaps,

2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:03.180
 it's really like a hundred hour plus thing.

2:26:03.180 --> 2:26:06.980
 Like once you really launch, you go all in.

2:26:06.980 --> 2:26:09.340
 Like everything else just disappears.

2:26:09.340 --> 2:26:11.820
 Like you can't even have a hope of a balanced life

2:26:11.820 --> 2:26:12.660
 for a little bit.

2:26:12.660 --> 2:26:15.340
 So, and there co founder really helps.

2:26:15.340 --> 2:26:16.340
 That's the idea.

2:26:18.300 --> 2:26:20.900
 When you, you're one of the most interesting people

2:26:20.900 --> 2:26:21.820
 on the internet.

2:26:21.820 --> 2:26:26.540
 So as a writer, you look out into the future.

2:26:27.540 --> 2:26:30.460
 Do you dream about certain things you want to still create?

2:26:30.460 --> 2:26:34.140
 Is there projects that you want to write?

2:26:34.140 --> 2:26:37.420
 Is there movies you want to write or direct or?

2:26:37.420 --> 2:26:38.660
 Endless.

2:26:38.660 --> 2:26:40.980
 So it's just endless sea of ideas.

2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:44.140
 No, there's specific list of things that really excite me,

2:26:44.140 --> 2:26:46.220
 but it's a big list that I know

2:26:46.220 --> 2:26:47.340
 I'll never get through them all.

2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:51.580
 And that's part of why the last five years really like,

2:26:51.580 --> 2:26:54.340
 when I feel like I'm not moving as quickly as I could,

2:26:54.340 --> 2:26:57.180
 it bothers me because I have so much genuine excitement

2:26:57.180 --> 2:26:58.380
 to try so many different things.

2:26:58.380 --> 2:27:00.180
 And I get so much joy from finishing things.

2:27:00.180 --> 2:27:03.580
 I don't like doing things, but a lot of writers are like that.

2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:06.580
 Publishing something is hugely joyful

2:27:06.580 --> 2:27:08.140
 and makes it all worth it.

2:27:08.140 --> 2:27:09.980
 Or just finishing something you're proud of,

2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:11.500
 putting it out there and have people appreciate it.

2:27:11.500 --> 2:27:13.700
 It's like the best thing in the world, right?

2:27:13.700 --> 2:27:15.740
 Every kid makes some little bargain with themselves,

2:27:15.740 --> 2:27:19.060
 has a little, a dream or something.

2:27:19.060 --> 2:27:22.940
 And I feel like when I do something that I make something

2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:25.740
 in this, for me, it's been mostly writing

2:27:25.740 --> 2:27:27.660
 and I feel proud of it and I put it out there.

2:27:27.660 --> 2:27:29.140
 I feel like I like, again,

2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:30.940
 I'm like fist pounding my seven year old self.

2:27:30.940 --> 2:27:34.700
 Like there's a little, like I owe it to myself

2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:35.540
 to do certain things.

2:27:35.540 --> 2:27:36.860
 And I just did one of the things I owe.

2:27:36.860 --> 2:27:38.060
 I just paid off some debt to myself.

2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:40.260
 I owed it and I paid it and it feels great.

2:27:40.260 --> 2:27:42.700
 It feels like very like you just feel very,

2:27:42.700 --> 2:27:43.900
 a lot of inner peace when you do it.

2:27:43.900 --> 2:27:46.140
 So the more things I can do,

2:27:46.140 --> 2:27:47.460
 and I just have fun doing it, right?

2:27:47.460 --> 2:27:50.860
 And so I just, for me that includes a lot more writing.

2:27:50.860 --> 2:27:54.460
 I just, short blog posts, I write very long blog posts,

2:27:54.460 --> 2:27:55.620
 but basically short writing

2:27:55.620 --> 2:27:57.940
 in the form of long blog posts is a great,

2:27:57.940 --> 2:27:59.060
 I love that medium.

2:27:59.060 --> 2:28:00.860
 I wanna do a lot more of that.

2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:02.620
 Books yet to be seen, I'm gonna do this

2:28:02.620 --> 2:28:04.100
 and I'm gonna have another book I'm gonna do right after.

2:28:04.100 --> 2:28:05.340
 And we'll see if I like those two.

2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:07.620
 And if I do, I'll do more, otherwise I won't.

2:28:07.620 --> 2:28:08.780
 But I also wanna try other mediums.

2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:10.860
 I wanna make more videos.

2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:14.540
 I want to, I did a little travel series once.

2:28:14.540 --> 2:28:15.380
 I love doing that.

2:28:15.380 --> 2:28:16.780
 I wanna do more of that.

2:28:16.780 --> 2:28:18.500
 Almost like a vlog.

2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:21.260
 No, it was, I let readers in a survey

2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:24.820
 pick five countries they wanted me to go to.

2:28:24.820 --> 2:28:25.660
 That's awesome.

2:28:25.660 --> 2:28:27.940
 And they picked, they sent me to weird places.

2:28:27.940 --> 2:28:32.460
 They sent me, I went to Siberia, I went to Japan.

2:28:32.460 --> 2:28:34.740
 I went from there to, this is all in a row,

2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:37.380
 into Nigeria, from there to Iraq.

2:28:37.380 --> 2:28:39.140
 And from there to Greenland.

2:28:39.140 --> 2:28:41.020
 And then I went back to New York,

2:28:41.020 --> 2:28:42.420
 like two weeks in each place.

2:28:43.620 --> 2:28:46.860
 And I got to, each one I got to have some weird experiences.

2:28:46.860 --> 2:28:48.420
 I tried to like really dig in

2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:51.460
 and have like some interesting experiences.

2:28:51.460 --> 2:28:52.540
 And then I wrote about it.

2:28:52.540 --> 2:28:53.900
 And I taught readers a little bit

2:28:53.900 --> 2:28:55.020
 about the history of these places.

2:28:55.020 --> 2:28:56.340
 And it was just, I love doing that.

2:28:56.340 --> 2:28:58.940
 I love, so, and I'm like, oh man,

2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:01.820
 like I haven't done one of those in so long.

2:29:01.820 --> 2:29:05.820
 And then I have a big like desire to do fictional stuff.

2:29:05.820 --> 2:29:07.740
 Like I want to write a sci fi at some point.

2:29:07.740 --> 2:29:09.740
 And I would love to write a musical.

2:29:09.740 --> 2:29:11.780
 That's actually what I was doing before Wait But Why.

2:29:11.780 --> 2:29:14.420
 I was with a partner, Ryan Langer.

2:29:14.420 --> 2:29:15.860
 We were halfway through a musical

2:29:15.860 --> 2:29:19.860
 and he got tied up with his other musical

2:29:19.860 --> 2:29:21.420
 and Wait But Why started taking off.

2:29:21.420 --> 2:29:22.740
 And we just haven't gotten back to it.

2:29:22.740 --> 2:29:24.260
 But it's such a fun medium.

2:29:24.260 --> 2:29:26.540
 So it's such a silly medium, but it's so fun.

2:29:26.540 --> 2:29:28.460
 So you think about all of these mediums

2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:30.700
 on which you can be creative and create something

2:29:30.700 --> 2:29:32.620
 and you like the variety of it.

2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:37.180
 Yeah, it's just that if there's a chance on a new medium,

2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:38.820
 I could do something good.

2:29:38.820 --> 2:29:39.660
 I want to do it.

2:29:39.660 --> 2:29:40.500
 I want to try it.

2:29:40.500 --> 2:29:42.900
 It sounds like so gratifying and so fun.

2:29:42.900 --> 2:29:45.540
 I think it's fun to just watch you actually sample these.

2:29:45.540 --> 2:29:47.740
 So I can't wait for your podcast.

2:29:47.740 --> 2:29:49.460
 I'll be listening to all of them.

2:29:49.460 --> 2:29:52.220
 I mean, that's a cool medium to see like where it goes.

2:29:52.220 --> 2:29:54.340
 The cool thing about podcasting and making videos,

2:29:54.340 --> 2:29:56.860
 especially with a super creative mind like yours,

2:29:56.860 --> 2:29:59.640
 you don't really know what you're going to make of it

2:29:59.640 --> 2:30:01.180
 until you try it.

2:30:01.180 --> 2:30:03.020
 Yeah, podcasts I'm really excited about,

2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:06.540
 but I'm like, I like going on other people's podcasts.

2:30:06.540 --> 2:30:08.180
 And I never try to have my own.

2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:10.000
 So with every medium,

2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:13.180
 there's the challenges of how the sausage is made.

2:30:13.180 --> 2:30:15.380
 So like the challenges of action.

2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:16.700
 Yeah, but it's also, I like to like,

2:30:16.700 --> 2:30:19.380
 I'll go on like, as you know, long ass monologues

2:30:19.380 --> 2:30:20.540
 and you can't do that.

2:30:20.540 --> 2:30:21.720
 If you're the interviewer,

2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:23.420
 like you're not supposed to do that as much.

2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:27.700
 So I have to like rein it in and that might be hard,

2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:28.540
 but we'll see.

2:30:28.540 --> 2:30:29.500
 You could also do solo type stuff.

2:30:29.500 --> 2:30:31.180
 Yeah, maybe I'll do a little of each.

2:30:31.180 --> 2:30:32.020
 You know what's funny?

2:30:32.020 --> 2:30:34.140
 I mean, some of my favorite is more like solo,

2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:36.060
 but there's like a sidekick.

2:30:36.060 --> 2:30:40.600
 So you're having a conversation, but you're like friends,

2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:43.180
 but it's really you ranting,

2:30:43.180 --> 2:30:46.100
 which I think you'd be extremely good at.

2:30:46.100 --> 2:30:46.940
 That's funny, yeah.

2:30:46.940 --> 2:30:48.820
 Or even if it's 50 50, that's fine.

2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:50.900
 Like if it's just a friend who I want to like really riff

2:30:50.900 --> 2:30:55.380
 with, I just don't like interviewing someone,

2:30:55.380 --> 2:30:57.200
 which I won't, that's not what the podcast will be,

2:30:57.200 --> 2:30:58.040
 but I can't help.

2:30:58.040 --> 2:30:59.940
 I've tried moderating panels before

2:30:59.940 --> 2:31:01.020
 and I cannot help myself.

2:31:01.020 --> 2:31:03.340
 I have to get involved and no one likes a moderator

2:31:03.340 --> 2:31:04.180
 who's too involved.

2:31:04.180 --> 2:31:05.000
 It's very unappealing.

2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:07.600
 So I, you know, interviewing someone and I'm like,

2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:09.980
 I can't, I don't even, I don't, I just, it's not my,

2:31:09.980 --> 2:31:11.540
 I can grill someone, but that's different.

2:31:11.540 --> 2:31:13.720
 That's my curiosity being like, wait, how about this?

2:31:13.720 --> 2:31:14.740
 And I interrupt them and I'm trying to.

2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:16.340
 I see the way your brain works.

2:31:16.340 --> 2:31:17.180
 It's hilarious.

2:31:17.180 --> 2:31:18.000
 It's awesome.

2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:19.940
 It's like lights up with fire and excitement.

2:31:19.940 --> 2:31:21.820
 Yeah, I actually, I love listening.

2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:24.100
 I like watching people, I like listening to people.

2:31:24.100 --> 2:31:25.700
 So this is like me right now,

2:31:25.700 --> 2:31:27.900
 having just listening to a podcast.

2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:29.660
 This is me listening to your podcast right now.

2:31:29.660 --> 2:31:30.780
 I love listening to a podcast

2:31:30.780 --> 2:31:31.820
 because then it's not even like,

2:31:31.820 --> 2:31:33.980
 but once I'm in the room, I suddenly can't help myself.

2:31:33.980 --> 2:31:35.380
 I jump again.

2:31:35.380 --> 2:31:36.700
 Okay.

2:31:36.700 --> 2:31:38.400
 Big last ridiculous question.

2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:40.340
 What is the meaning of life?

2:31:40.340 --> 2:31:42.380
 The meaning of like an individual life?

2:31:42.380 --> 2:31:44.260
 Your existence here on earth,

2:31:44.260 --> 2:31:47.200
 or maybe broadly this whole thing we've got going on,

2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:48.460
 descendants of apes,

2:31:49.340 --> 2:31:50.460
 busily creating.

2:31:50.460 --> 2:31:51.280
 Yeah, well there's, yeah.

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:55.580
 For me, I feel like I want to be around as long as I can.

2:31:55.580 --> 2:31:57.840
 If I can, if I can do some kind of crazy life extension

2:31:57.840 --> 2:31:59.060
 or upload myself, I'm gonna,

2:31:59.060 --> 2:32:01.180
 because who doesn't want to see how cool

2:32:01.180 --> 2:32:03.240
 the year 3000 is?

2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:04.080
 Imagine.

2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:06.300
 You did say mortality was not appealing.

2:32:06.300 --> 2:32:08.100
 No, it's not appealing at all to me.

2:32:08.100 --> 2:32:10.180
 Now, it's ultimately appealing.

2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:12.260
 As I said, no one wants eternal life, I believe,

2:32:12.260 --> 2:32:14.180
 if they understood what eternity really was.

2:32:14.180 --> 2:32:15.900
 And I did Graham's number as a post,

2:32:15.900 --> 2:32:18.160
 and I was like, okay, no one wants to live that many years.

2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:19.340
 But I'd like to choose.

2:32:19.340 --> 2:32:20.180
 I'd like to say, you know what?

2:32:20.180 --> 2:32:21.620
 I'm truly over it now, and I'm going to have,

2:32:21.620 --> 2:32:22.700
 you know, at that point we'd have,

2:32:22.700 --> 2:32:24.380
 our whole society would have like,

2:32:24.380 --> 2:32:25.620
 we'd have a ceremony.

2:32:25.620 --> 2:32:28.060
 We'd have a whole process of someone signing off,

2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:29.420
 and you know, it would be beautiful,

2:32:29.420 --> 2:32:30.260
 and it wouldn't be sad.

2:32:30.260 --> 2:32:33.540
 Well, I think you'd be super depressed by that point.

2:32:33.540 --> 2:32:35.420
 Like, who's gonna sign off when they're doing pretty good?

2:32:35.420 --> 2:32:36.260
 Maybe, maybe, yes.

2:32:36.260 --> 2:32:37.500
 Okay, maybe it's dark.

2:32:37.500 --> 2:32:38.740
 But at least, but the point is,

2:32:38.740 --> 2:32:40.940
 if I'm happy, I can stay around for five, you know.

2:32:40.940 --> 2:32:42.740
 I'm thinking 50 century sounds great.

2:32:42.740 --> 2:32:44.140
 Like, I don't know if I want more than that.

2:32:44.140 --> 2:32:45.540
 50 sounds like a right number.

2:32:45.540 --> 2:32:47.860
 And so if you're thinking, if you would sign up for 50,

2:32:47.860 --> 2:32:50.500
 if you had a choice, one is what I get, that is bullshit.

2:32:50.500 --> 2:32:52.820
 Like, if you're somebody who wants 50,

2:32:52.820 --> 2:32:55.500
 one is a hideous number, right?

2:32:55.500 --> 2:32:56.820
 You know, anyway.

2:32:56.820 --> 2:33:01.100
 So for me personally, I want to be around as long as I can.

2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:02.980
 And then honestly, the reason I love writing,

2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:05.260
 the thing that I love most is like,

2:33:05.260 --> 2:33:08.500
 is like a warm fuzzy connection with other people, right?

2:33:08.500 --> 2:33:11.780
 And that can be my friends, and it can be readers.

2:33:11.780 --> 2:33:13.920
 And that's why I would never want to be like a journalist

2:33:13.920 --> 2:33:16.720
 where their personality is like hidden behind the writing,

2:33:17.740 --> 2:33:19.600
 or like even a biographer, you know.

2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:21.240
 There's a lot of people who are great writers,

2:33:21.240 --> 2:33:23.620
 but it's, I like to personally connect.

2:33:23.620 --> 2:33:25.360
 And if I can take something that's in my head

2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:27.040
 and other people can say, oh my God, I think that too,

2:33:27.040 --> 2:33:28.380
 and this made me feel so much better,

2:33:28.380 --> 2:33:30.220
 it made me feel seen, like that feels amazing.

2:33:30.220 --> 2:33:33.460
 And I just feel like we're all having

2:33:33.460 --> 2:33:35.940
 such a weird common experience on this one little rock,

2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:37.340
 in this one little moment of time,

2:33:37.340 --> 2:33:40.880
 where this weird, these weird four limb beings,

2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:41.720
 and we're all the same.

2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:43.860
 And it's like, we're all, we all, the human experience,

2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:46.180
 so I feel like so many of us suffer in the same ways,

2:33:46.180 --> 2:33:48.040
 and we're all going through a lot of the same things.

2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:50.420
 And to me, it is very, if I lived,

2:33:50.420 --> 2:33:52.160
 if I was on my deathbed and I feel like I had,

2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:54.580
 like I had a ton of human connection,

2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:56.500
 and like shared a lot of common experience,

2:33:56.500 --> 2:33:58.500
 and made a lot of other people feel like,

2:33:59.700 --> 2:34:01.460
 like not alone.

2:34:01.460 --> 2:34:02.780
 Do you feel that as a writer?

2:34:02.780 --> 2:34:07.780
 Do you like hear and feel like the inspiration,

2:34:08.060 --> 2:34:10.460
 like all the people that you make smile,

2:34:10.460 --> 2:34:11.380
 and all the people you inspire?

2:34:11.380 --> 2:34:13.500
 Honestly, not, sometimes, you know,

2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:14.940
 when we did an in person event,

2:34:14.940 --> 2:34:16.260
 and I, you know, meet a bunch of people,

2:34:16.260 --> 2:34:18.140
 and it's incredibly gratifying,

2:34:18.140 --> 2:34:19.620
 or, you know, you just, you know, you get emails,

2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:22.300
 but I think it is easy to forget that how many people,

2:34:22.300 --> 2:34:24.220
 sometimes you're just sitting there alone,

2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:26.900
 typing, dealing with your procrastination.

2:34:26.900 --> 2:34:28.220
 But that's why publishing is so gratifying,

2:34:28.220 --> 2:34:30.280
 because that's the moment when all this connection happens.

2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:32.220
 And especially if I had to put my finger on it,

2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:35.460
 it's like, it's having a bunch of people who feel lonely,

2:34:35.460 --> 2:34:37.060
 and their like existence is all realized,

2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:38.500
 like all, you know, connect, right?

2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:40.220
 So that, if I do a lot of that,

2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:43.060
 and that includes, of course, my actual spending,

2:34:43.060 --> 2:34:44.520
 you know, a lot of really high quality time

2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:46.220
 with friends and family, and like,

2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:50.140
 and making the whole thing as heartbreaking

2:34:50.140 --> 2:34:51.900
 as like mortality and life can be,

2:34:51.900 --> 2:34:53.420
 make the whole thing like fun,

2:34:53.420 --> 2:34:55.700
 and at least we can like laugh at ourselves together

2:34:55.700 --> 2:34:56.940
 while going through it.

2:34:56.940 --> 2:34:58.500
 And that to me is the, yeah.

2:34:58.500 --> 2:35:02.620
 And then your last blog post will be written from Mars

2:35:02.620 --> 2:35:05.460
 as you get the bad news that you're not able to return

2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:07.740
 because of the malfunction in the rocket.

2:35:07.740 --> 2:35:09.180
 Yeah, I would like to go to Mars,

2:35:09.180 --> 2:35:10.140
 and like go there for a week,

2:35:10.140 --> 2:35:11.960
 and be like, yeah, here we are, and then come back.

2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:13.540
 No, I know that's what you want.

2:35:13.540 --> 2:35:14.820
 Staying there, yeah.

2:35:14.820 --> 2:35:15.740
 And that's fine, by the way.

2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:17.780
 If I, yeah, if, so you think,

2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:20.760
 you're picturing me alone on Mars as the first person there,

2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:21.600
 and then it malfunctions.

2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:23.200
 Right, no, you were supposed to return,

2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:26.300
 but it malfunctions, and then there's this,

2:35:26.300 --> 2:35:30.540
 so it's both the hope, the awe that you experience,

2:35:30.540 --> 2:35:32.420
 which is how the blog starts,

2:35:32.420 --> 2:35:34.980
 and then it's the overwhelming,

2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:38.060
 like feeling of existential dread,

2:35:38.060 --> 2:35:41.220
 but then it returns to like the love of humanity.

2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:43.780
 Well, that's the thing, is if I could be writing,

2:35:43.780 --> 2:35:44.880
 and actually like writing something

2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:46.060
 that people would read back on Earth,

2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:47.300
 it would make it feel so much better.

2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:48.120
 Yeah, yeah.

2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:48.960
 You know, if I were just alone,

2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:50.620
 and no one was gonna realize what happened.

2:35:50.620 --> 2:35:51.620
 No, no, no, you get to write.

2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:53.180
 Yeah, no, no, it's perfectly safe.

2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:54.940
 Also, that would bring out great writing.

2:35:54.940 --> 2:35:55.780
 Yeah, I think so.

2:35:55.780 --> 2:35:56.940
 If you don't have your deathbed on Mars alone.

2:35:56.940 --> 2:35:57.780
 I think so.

2:35:57.780 --> 2:35:58.600
 Yeah.

2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:02.780
 Well, that's exactly the future I hope for you, Tim.

2:36:02.780 --> 2:36:04.500
 All right, this was an incredible conversation.

2:36:04.500 --> 2:36:06.580
 You're a really special human being, Tim.

2:36:06.580 --> 2:36:08.980
 Thank you so much for spending

2:36:08.980 --> 2:36:10.140
 your really valuable time with me.

2:36:10.140 --> 2:36:11.900
 I can't wait to hear your podcast.

2:36:11.900 --> 2:36:15.280
 I can't wait to read your next blog post,

2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:17.220
 which you said in a Twitter reply.

2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:19.460
 You'll get more.

2:36:19.460 --> 2:36:20.940
 Yeah, soon enough, I'll be back.

2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:24.580
 After the book, which add that to the long list of ideas

2:36:24.580 --> 2:36:26.700
 to procrastinate about.

2:36:26.700 --> 2:36:28.700
 Tim, thanks so much for talking to me, man.

2:36:28.700 --> 2:36:29.540
 Thank you.

2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:33.620

2:36:39.860 --> 2:36:41.400
 from Tim Urban himself.

2:36:42.380 --> 2:36:44.980
 Be humbler about what you know,

2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:47.460
 more confident about what's possible,

2:36:47.460 --> 2:36:51.140
 and less afraid of things that don't matter.

2:36:51.140 --> 2:37:18.140
 Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.
