00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
 The following is a conversation with Richard Wrangham,

00:03.240 --> 00:05.720
 a biological anthropologist at Harvard

00:05.720 --> 00:08.160
 specializing in the study of primates

00:08.160 --> 00:12.200
 and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,

00:12.200 --> 00:15.160
 and other aspects of ape and human behavior

00:15.160 --> 00:18.360
 at the individual and societal level.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.960
 He began his career over four decades ago

00:20.960 --> 00:22.340
 working with Jane Goodall

00:22.340 --> 00:24.560
 and studying the behavior of chimps,

00:24.560 --> 00:27.320
 and since then has done a lot of seminal work

00:27.320 --> 00:29.800
 on human evolution and has proposed

00:29.800 --> 00:33.380
 several theories for the roles of fire and violence

00:33.380 --> 00:36.580
 in the evolution of us, hairless apes,

00:36.580 --> 00:39.460
 otherwise known as homo sapiens.

00:39.460 --> 00:41.700
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.880
 in the description.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.960
 And now, here's my conversation with Richard Wrangham.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.080
 You've said that we're much less violent

00:53.080 --> 00:57.000
 than our close living relatives, the chimps.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
 Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are

01:01.000 --> 01:04.500
 and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?

01:04.500 --> 01:05.960
 Well, I haven't said exactly

01:05.960 --> 01:07.940
 that we're less violent than chimps.

01:07.940 --> 01:11.260
 What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.

01:11.260 --> 01:13.260
 One stems from proactive aggression

01:13.260 --> 01:15.600
 and the other stems from reactive aggression.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.840
 Proactive aggression is planned aggression.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.760
 Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.560
 It's reactive because it takes place

01:24.560 --> 01:27.500
 in seconds after the threat.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.840
 And the thing that is really striking about humans

01:30.840 --> 01:35.840
 compared to our close relatives is the great reduction

01:36.480 --> 01:40.240
 in the degree of reactive aggression.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.160
 So we are far less violent than chimps

01:43.160 --> 01:46.680
 when prompted by some relatively minor threat

01:46.680 --> 01:48.620
 within our own society.

01:48.620 --> 01:53.620
 And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data

01:53.620 --> 01:58.620
 but the study which is particularly striking

01:59.440 --> 02:04.440
 is one of people living as hunter gatherers

02:05.200 --> 02:09.720
 in a really upsetting kind of environment,

02:09.720 --> 02:14.720
 namely people in Australia living in a place

02:15.300 --> 02:19.180
 where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.640
 There's a lot of domestic violence.

02:21.640 --> 02:26.640
 It's all a sort of a society that is as bad

02:29.240 --> 02:30.540
 from the point of view of violence

02:30.540 --> 02:33.140
 as an ordinary society can get.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.880
 There's excellent data on the frequency

02:36.880 --> 02:39.240
 with which people actually have physical violence

02:39.240 --> 02:40.440
 and hit each other.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.680
 And we can compare that to data

02:42.680 --> 02:46.200
 from several different sites comparing,

02:46.200 --> 02:50.100
 we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence.

02:50.100 --> 02:53.960
 And the difference is between two and three orders

02:53.960 --> 02:55.420
 of magnitude.

02:55.420 --> 02:58.120
 The frequency with which chimps and bonobos hit each other,

02:58.120 --> 03:02.120
 chase each other, charge each other, physically engage

03:02.120 --> 03:06.320
 is somewhere between 500 and a thousand times

03:06.320 --> 03:08.360
 higher than in humans.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.900
 So there's something just amazing about us.

03:09.900 --> 03:13.600
 And this has been recognized for centuries.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.080
 Aristotle drew attention to the fact that we behave

03:17.080 --> 03:19.000
 in many ways like domesticated animals

03:19.000 --> 03:21.320
 because we're so unviolent.

03:21.320 --> 03:26.320
 But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements

03:26.800 --> 03:29.480
 of this 20th century?

03:29.480 --> 03:33.640
 The First and Second World War and much else besides.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.120
 And that is all proactive violence.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.860
 All of that is gangs of people

03:42.280 --> 03:45.160
 making deliberate decisions to go off and attack

03:45.160 --> 03:48.880
 in circumstances which ideally the attackers

03:48.880 --> 03:51.360
 are going to be able to make their kills

03:51.360 --> 03:53.320
 and then get out of there.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.920
 In other words, not face confrontation.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.780
 That's the ordinary way that armies try and work.

03:58.780 --> 04:03.780
 And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees

04:04.880 --> 04:07.100
 are in a very similar kind of state.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.960
 That is to say, if you look at the rate of death

04:10.960 --> 04:15.460
 from chimpanzees conducting proactive coalition violence,

04:15.460 --> 04:20.280
 it's very similar in many ways to what you see in humans.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.580
 So we're not down regulated with proactive violence.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.720
 It's just this reactive violence

04:25.720 --> 04:29.160
 that is strikingly reduced in humans.

04:29.160 --> 04:33.220
 So chimpanzees also practiced kind of tribal warfare.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.060
 Indeed they do, yeah.

04:36.060 --> 04:38.960
 So this was discovered first in 1974.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.960
 It was observed first in 1974,

04:40.960 --> 04:45.960
 which was about the time that the first major study

04:48.080 --> 04:51.200
 of chimpanzees in the wild by Jane Goodall

04:51.200 --> 04:55.480
 had been going for something like five years

04:55.480 --> 05:00.480
 during of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.

05:02.760 --> 05:07.000
 Until then, they'd been observed at a feeding station

05:07.000 --> 05:11.080
 where Jane was luring them in to be observed

05:11.080 --> 05:12.960
 by seeing bananas, which is great.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.360
 She learned a lot, but she didn't learn

05:15.360 --> 05:17.920
 what was happening at the edges of their ranges.

05:17.920 --> 05:22.520
 So five years later, it became very obvious

05:22.520 --> 05:25.680
 that there was hostile relationships between groups.

05:25.680 --> 05:30.580
 And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form

05:30.580 --> 05:32.640
 of the kind of hostile relationships

05:32.640 --> 05:33.740
 that you see in many animals,

05:33.740 --> 05:38.740
 which is a bunch of chimps in this case

05:38.960 --> 05:43.960
 shouting at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.560
 But dramatically, in addition to that,

05:47.560 --> 05:49.320
 there is a second kind of interaction.

05:49.320 --> 05:54.320
 And that is when a party of chimpanzees

05:55.980 --> 06:00.980
 makes a deliberate venture to the edge of their territory,

06:00.980 --> 06:05.980
 silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.760
 And what they're searching for is a lone individual.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.240
 So I've been with chimps when they've heard

06:15.240 --> 06:17.960
 a lone individual under these circumstances,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
 or what they think is a lone one,

06:19.960 --> 06:23.040
 and they touch each other and look at each other

06:23.040 --> 06:26.120
 and then charge forward, very excited.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.880
 And then while they're charging,

06:30.880 --> 06:35.520
 all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call

06:35.520 --> 06:37.520
 erupts with a volley of calls.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.860
 It was just one calling out of a larger party.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.480
 And our chimps put on the brakes

06:43.480 --> 06:46.680
 and scoot back for safety into their own territory.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.680
 But if in fact they do find a lone individual

06:49.680 --> 06:52.460
 and they can sneak up to them,

06:52.460 --> 06:55.000
 then they make a deliberate attack.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.560
 They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting,

06:57.560 --> 07:00.640
 and then they impose terrible damage,

07:00.640 --> 07:03.040
 which typically ends in a kill straight away,

07:03.040 --> 07:08.040
 but it might end up with the victim so damaged

07:08.320 --> 07:13.320
 that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.360
 So that was a very dramatic discovery

07:15.360 --> 07:20.360
 because it really made people realize for the first time

07:20.480 --> 07:22.760
 that Conrad Lorentz had been wrong

07:22.760 --> 07:26.880
 when in the 1960s, in his famous book, On Aggression,

07:26.880 --> 07:30.800
 he said, warfare is restricted to humans.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.080
 Animals do not deliberately kill each other.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.160
 Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals

07:35.160 --> 07:36.420
 that deliberately kill each other,

07:36.420 --> 07:38.560
 and they always do so under essentially

07:38.560 --> 07:40.680
 the same circumstances, which is

07:40.680 --> 07:44.200
 when they feel safe doing it.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.860
 So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.

07:48.040 --> 07:52.400
 Animals feel safe when they have a coalition.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.800
 A coalition that has overwhelming power

07:54.800 --> 07:56.720
 compared to the victim.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.400
 And so wolves will do that, and lions will do that,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.480
 and hyenas will do that, and chimpanzees will do it,

08:02.480 --> 08:04.280
 and humans do it too.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.480
 Can they pull themselves into something

08:08.480 --> 08:10.600
 that looks more like a symmetric war

08:10.600 --> 08:12.660
 as opposed to an asymmetric one?

08:12.660 --> 08:15.280
 So accidentally engaging on the lone individual

08:15.280 --> 08:17.220
 and then getting themselves into trouble?

08:17.220 --> 08:19.080
 Or are they more aggressive

08:19.080 --> 08:21.360
 in avoiding these kinds of battles?

08:21.360 --> 08:24.040
 No, they're very, very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,

08:24.040 --> 08:27.620
 but occasionally, they can make a mistake.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.320
 But so far, there have been no observations

08:32.320 --> 08:33.800
 of anything like a battle

08:33.800 --> 08:37.240
 in which both sides maintain themselves.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.240
 And I think you can very confidently say

08:40.240 --> 08:42.600
 that overwhelmingly what happens is

08:42.600 --> 08:45.060
 that if they discover that there's several individuals

08:45.060 --> 08:48.240
 on the other side, then both sides retreat.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.280
 Nobody wants to get hurt.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.000
 What they want to do is to hurt others.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.840
 Yes.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.440
 So you mentioned Jane Goodall.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.640
 You've worked with her.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.120
 What was it like working with her?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.720
 What have you learned from her?

09:01.080 --> 09:05.000
 Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person

09:05.000 --> 09:09.680
 who she famously began her studies

09:09.680 --> 09:14.680
 not as a qualified person in terms of education,

09:14.680 --> 09:19.680
 but qualified only by enthusiasm and a considerable

09:19.680 --> 09:22.600
 experience, even in her early 20s, with nature.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.440
 So she's courageous in the sense

09:26.440 --> 09:30.520
 of being able to take on challenges.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.720
 The thing that is very impressive about her

09:32.720 --> 09:37.720
 is her total fidelity to the observations,

09:37.720 --> 09:42.720
 very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.440
 waiting until they mount up

09:45.440 --> 09:47.440
 and you've really got a confident picture,

09:48.960 --> 09:53.640
 and tremendous attention to individuals.

09:53.640 --> 09:57.200
 So that was an interesting problem from her point of view

09:57.200 --> 10:02.200
 because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,

10:02.440 --> 10:05.280
 this particular community of Kazakus,

10:05.280 --> 10:08.040
 this particular community of Kazakela,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.400
 about 60 individuals,

10:10.880 --> 10:14.680
 so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.480
 She was there initially with her mother

10:16.480 --> 10:20.400
 and then alone for two or three years

10:20.400 --> 10:22.600
 of really intense observation

10:22.600 --> 10:24.800
 and then slowly joined by other people.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.600
 What she discovered was that there were obvious differences

10:31.600 --> 10:34.520
 in individual personality

10:34.520 --> 10:36.400
 and the difficulty about that was that

10:37.320 --> 10:42.320
 when she reported this to the larger scientific world,

10:42.960 --> 10:45.920
 initially her advisors at Cambridge,

10:47.440 --> 10:49.840
 they said, well, we don't know how to handle that

10:49.840 --> 10:52.800
 because you've got to treat all these animals

10:52.800 --> 10:54.360
 as the same basically,

10:54.360 --> 10:59.360
 because there is no research tradition

11:00.440 --> 11:03.200
 of thinking about personalities.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.720
 Well now, whatever it is, 60 years later,

11:07.800 --> 11:11.520
 the study of personalities is a very rich part

11:11.520 --> 11:13.200
 of the study of animal behavior.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.320
 At any rate, the important point in terms of

11:17.320 --> 11:19.200
 what was she like is that she stuck to her guns

11:19.200 --> 11:23.280
 and she absolutely insisted that we have to show,

11:23.280 --> 11:27.360
 describe in great detail the differences in personality

11:27.360 --> 11:28.360
 among these individuals

11:28.360 --> 11:30.400
 and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologists

11:30.400 --> 11:32.600
 to think about what it means.

11:32.600 --> 11:37.600
 So what is the process of observation like this like?

11:37.840 --> 11:41.520
 Observing the personality but also observing in a way

11:41.520 --> 11:45.480
 that's not projecting your beliefs about human nature

11:45.480 --> 11:48.760
 or animal nature onto chimps,

11:48.760 --> 11:52.520
 which is probably really tempting to project.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.880
 So your understanding of the way the human world works,

11:55.880 --> 11:59.360
 projecting that onto the chimp world.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.560
 Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps

12:01.560 --> 12:05.200
 because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior

12:05.200 --> 12:09.720
 that it's very easy to make those projections, as you say.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.840
 The process involves making very clear definitions

12:14.840 --> 12:16.880
 of what a behavior is.

12:18.440 --> 12:23.440
 Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,

12:24.240 --> 12:25.600
 a bite, and so on,

12:26.720 --> 12:30.280
 and writing down every time these things happen

12:30.280 --> 12:32.640
 and then slowly totting up the numbers of times

12:32.640 --> 12:35.720
 that they happen from individual A

12:35.720 --> 12:37.760
 towards individuals B, C, D, and E,

12:39.040 --> 12:41.600
 so that you build up a very concrete picture

12:41.600 --> 12:43.760
 rather than interpreting at any point

12:43.760 --> 12:44.920
 and stopping and saying,

12:44.920 --> 12:47.360
 well, they seem to be rather aggressive.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.760
 So the sort of formal system

12:51.760 --> 12:54.480
 is that you build up a pattern of the relationships

12:54.480 --> 12:58.560
 based on a description of the different types

12:58.560 --> 13:00.440
 of interactions, the aggressive

13:00.440 --> 13:02.000
 and the friendly interactions,

13:03.080 --> 13:06.040
 and all of these are defined in concrete.

13:07.600 --> 13:12.280
 And so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships.

13:12.280 --> 13:16.320
 And the relationships can be defined as

13:18.560 --> 13:23.560
 relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive,

13:23.640 --> 13:27.400
 based on the frequency of these types of interactions.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.960
 And so one can talk in terms of individuals

13:30.960 --> 13:34.960
 having a relationship which, on the scores of friendliness,

13:34.960 --> 13:38.080
 is two standard deviations outside the mean.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.960
 I mean, you know, it's...

13:40.960 --> 13:44.560
 In which direction, sorry, both directions?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.960
 Well, I mean, that would be, obviously,

13:47.960 --> 13:49.560
 the friendly ones would be the ones

13:49.560 --> 13:52.000
 who have exceptionally high rates

13:52.000 --> 13:54.400
 of spending time close to each other,

13:54.400 --> 13:56.520
 of touching each other in a gentle way,

13:56.520 --> 14:00.000
 of grooming each other, and, by the way,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.320
 finding that those things are correlated with each other.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.880
 So it's possible to define a friendship

14:06.880 --> 14:10.040
 with a capital F in a very systematic way,

14:10.040 --> 14:14.680
 and to compare that between individuals,

14:14.680 --> 14:18.680
 but also between communities of chimpanzees

14:18.680 --> 14:21.000
 and between different species.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.360
 So that, you know, we can say that in some species,

14:23.360 --> 14:26.440
 individuals have friends, and others, they don't at all.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.680
 What about just, because there's different personalities

14:29.680 --> 14:31.880
 and because they're so fascinating,

14:31.880 --> 14:33.600
 what about sort of falling in love

14:33.600 --> 14:37.200
 or forming friendships with chimps, you know?

14:37.200 --> 14:42.200
 Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer?

14:43.920 --> 14:46.320
 What role does that play?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.960
 Because you're tracking these individuals

14:47.960 --> 14:50.760
 that are full of life and intelligence

14:50.760 --> 14:53.560
 for long periods of time.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.120
 Plus, as a human, especially in those days for Jane,

14:58.120 --> 15:00.280
 she's alone, observing it.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.080
 It gets lonely as a human.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.000
 I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human being,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.720
 observing these other intelligent species.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.880
 It's a very reasonable question,

15:08.880 --> 15:11.600
 and of course, Jane, in those early years,

15:11.600 --> 15:15.280
 I think she's willing now to talk about the fact

15:15.280 --> 15:19.840
 that she regrets, to some extent, how close she became.

15:19.840 --> 15:23.560
 And the problem is not just from the humans.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.400
 The problem is from the chimpanzees as well,

15:25.400 --> 15:28.040
 because they do things

15:28.040 --> 15:32.640
 that are extremely affectionate, if you like.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.640
 You know, at one point, Jane offered a ripe fruit

15:39.640 --> 15:42.240
 to a chimpanzee called David Greybeard.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.400
 David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand,

15:47.640 --> 15:48.760
 as if to say thank you.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.160
 And then I think he gave it back, if I remember rightly.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.000
 Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.840
 Um.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.000
 No, thank you.

15:55.000 --> 15:55.840
 Right.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.360
 Oh, it's almost like thank you

15:59.360 --> 16:02.520
 and returning the affection by giving the fruit.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.360
 Yeah, exactly.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.200
 If they did something like that.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.960
 Yeah, no, it was a gentle squeeze.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.080
 I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard,

16:08.080 --> 16:10.200
 as occasionally has happened.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.520
 Some chimps are aggressive to people,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.360
 and others are friendly.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.880
 And the ones that are friendly tend to be

16:18.880 --> 16:20.200
 rather sympathetic characters,

16:20.200 --> 16:24.120
 because they might be ones who are having problems

16:24.120 --> 16:26.080
 in their own society.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.360
 You know, so Joe Mio in Gombe used to come

16:29.360 --> 16:31.640
 and sit next to me quite often,

16:31.640 --> 16:35.720
 and he was having a hard time making it in that society,

16:35.720 --> 16:38.080
 which I can describe to you in terms of the number

16:38.080 --> 16:39.640
 of aggressive interactions, if you want, you know,

16:39.640 --> 16:43.240
 but just to be informed about it.

16:43.240 --> 16:48.240
 So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.200
 And in the community that I've been working with in Uganda

16:52.200 --> 16:56.000
 for the last 30 years, we try extremely hard to impress

16:56.000 --> 16:58.320
 on all of the research students who come with us,

16:58.320 --> 17:01.640
 that it is absolutely vital that you do not fall

17:01.640 --> 17:02.680
 into that temptation.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.800
 Now, you know, we heard a story of one person

17:05.800 --> 17:09.040
 who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.

17:09.040 --> 17:12.120
 It's a very, very bad idea.

17:12.120 --> 17:16.280
 Not because the chimp is going to do anything violent

17:16.280 --> 17:21.280
 at the time, but because if they learn that humans

17:22.240 --> 17:25.960
 are as weak physically as we are compared to them,

17:25.960 --> 17:28.680
 then they can take advantage of us.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.680
 And that's what happened in Gombe.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.280
 So after Jane had done the very obvious thing

17:35.280 --> 17:38.720
 when you're first engaged in this game

17:38.720 --> 17:41.520
 of allowing the infants to approach her

17:41.520 --> 17:43.760
 and then tickling them and playing with them,

17:45.440 --> 17:49.080
 some of those infants had the personality

17:49.080 --> 17:53.280
 of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.000
 And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.880
 who was violent on a regular basis towards humans

17:59.880 --> 18:01.600
 when he was an adult, and he was quite dangerous.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.840
 I mean, he could easily have killed someone.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.040
 In fact, he did kill one person.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.640
 He killed a baby that he took from a mother,

18:09.640 --> 18:11.920
 a human baby, that he took off her hip

18:11.920 --> 18:13.760
 when he met her on the path.

18:15.160 --> 18:20.160
 So it's a reminder that we're dealing with a species

18:20.440 --> 18:23.840
 that are rather humanlike in the range of emotions

18:23.840 --> 18:26.320
 they have, in the capacities they have,

18:26.320 --> 18:28.880
 and even in the strength they have,

18:28.880 --> 18:33.040
 they are in many ways stronger than humans.

18:33.040 --> 18:37.080
 So you've got to be careful.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.920
 So in the full range of friendliness and violence,

18:39.920 --> 18:43.160
 the capacity for these very human things.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.280
 Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,

18:47.280 --> 18:50.160
 as we talked about, that they will kill.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.000
 They will kill not just strangers.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.600
 They can kill other adults within their own group.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.600
 They can kill babies that are strangers.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.160
 They can kill babies in their own group.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.360
 So, you know, this is a long lived individual.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.600
 Obviously, these killings can't have very often

19:06.600 --> 19:08.400
 because otherwise they'd all be dead.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.960
 And we're now finding that they can live

19:11.960 --> 19:14.160
 to 50 or 60 years in the wild

19:14.160 --> 19:16.160
 at relatively low population density

19:16.160 --> 19:17.640
 because they're big animals eating

19:17.640 --> 19:20.440
 a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.880
 So it doesn't happen all the time.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.760
 With friendliness, they are very strong

19:27.760 --> 19:28.760
 to support each other.

19:28.760 --> 19:33.760
 They very much depend on their close friendships,

19:33.760 --> 19:38.760
 which they express through physical contact

19:38.960 --> 19:41.640
 and particularly through grooming.

19:41.640 --> 19:45.720
 So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.280
 I might present for grooming,

19:48.280 --> 19:50.800
 a very common way of starting,

19:50.800 --> 19:53.200
 turning their back or presenting an arm

19:53.200 --> 19:54.520
 or something like that, and the other

19:54.520 --> 19:56.960
 just riffles their fingers through the hair.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.480
 And that's partly just soothing

20:00.480 --> 20:04.360
 and it's partly looking for parasites,

20:04.360 --> 20:06.400
 but mostly it's just soothing.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.240
 And the point about this is it can go on

20:09.240 --> 20:14.240
 for half an hour, it can go on for sometimes even an hour.

20:15.440 --> 20:20.040
 So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.

20:21.280 --> 20:25.720
 When did your interest in this one particular aspect

20:25.720 --> 20:28.920
 of Chim come to be, which is violence?

20:28.920 --> 20:32.240
 When did the study of violence in chimps

20:32.240 --> 20:34.440
 become something you're deeply interested in?

20:35.760 --> 20:40.760
 Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,

20:41.480 --> 20:43.000
 I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall

20:43.000 --> 20:46.160
 and was studying feeding behavior.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.040
 But during that time, we were seeing,

20:49.040 --> 20:52.400
 and I say we because there were half a dozen

20:52.400 --> 20:55.800
 research students all in her camp,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.800
 we were discovering that chimps

20:58.800 --> 21:02.440
 had this capacity for violence.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.000
 The first kill happened during that time,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.600
 which was of an infant in a neighboring group.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.880
 And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.360
 And this was the start of my interest

21:16.360 --> 21:19.280
 because it was such chilling evidence

21:19.280 --> 21:23.320
 of an extraordinary similarity between chimps

21:23.320 --> 21:27.680
 and humans. Now, at that time,

21:27.680 --> 21:31.280
 we didn't know very much about how chimpanzees

21:31.280 --> 21:33.320
 and humans were related.

21:33.320 --> 21:37.520
 Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three

21:37.520 --> 21:40.840
 big black hairy things that live in the African forests

21:40.840 --> 21:45.840
 and eat fruits and leaves when they can't find fruits

21:46.080 --> 21:47.440
 and walk on their knuckles.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.040
 And they all look rather similar to each other.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.760
 So they seem as though they're very similar

21:51.760 --> 21:54.800
 so they seem as though those three species,

21:54.800 --> 21:56.680
 chimps and gorillas and bonobos,

21:56.680 --> 21:59.360
 should all be each other's closest relatives

21:59.360 --> 22:01.480
 and humans are something rather separate.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.640
 And so any of them would be of interest to us.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.520
 Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true

22:08.520 --> 22:10.400
 and that there's a special relationship

22:10.400 --> 22:13.360
 between humans and chimpanzees.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.920
 But at the time, even without knowing that,

22:15.920 --> 22:18.440
 it was obvious that there was something very odd

22:18.440 --> 22:22.760
 about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered

22:22.760 --> 22:25.360
 they were making tools.

22:25.360 --> 22:29.040
 She had seen that they were hunting meat.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.720
 She had seen that they were sharing the meat

22:31.720 --> 22:33.160
 among each other.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.440
 She had seen that the societies were dominated politically

22:36.440 --> 22:38.600
 by males, coalitions of males.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.760
 All of these things, of course,

22:39.760 --> 22:42.200
 resonate so closely with humans.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.400
 And then it turns out that in contrast

22:47.400 --> 22:50.080
 to conventional wisdom at the time,

22:50.080 --> 22:53.200
 the chimpanzees were capable of hunting

22:53.200 --> 22:55.280
 and killing members of neighboring groups.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.400
 Well, at that point, the similarities

23:00.400 --> 23:04.600
 between chimps and humans become less a matter

23:04.600 --> 23:09.160
 of sort of sheer intellectual fascination

23:09.160 --> 23:11.520
 than something that has a really deep meaning

23:11.520 --> 23:14.600
 about our understanding of ourselves.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.720
 I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans

23:18.720 --> 23:21.840
 as a species apart from the rest of nature

23:21.840 --> 23:23.680
 because we are so peculiar.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.400
 But when it turns out that, as it turns out,

23:27.400 --> 23:29.040
 one of our two closest relatives

23:30.840 --> 23:33.840
 has got these features that we share

23:33.840 --> 23:36.680
 and that one of the features is something

23:36.680 --> 23:39.960
 that is the most horrendous,

23:39.960 --> 23:43.600
 as well as fascinating, aspect of human behavior,

23:43.600 --> 23:47.040
 then how can you resist just trying

23:47.040 --> 23:49.080
 to find out what's going on?

23:49.080 --> 23:50.760
 So I have to say this.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.600
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with a man,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.520
 but fans of this podcast are.

23:55.520 --> 23:59.200
 So we're talking about chimps, we're talking about violence.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.120
 My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan,

24:02.120 --> 24:03.560
 is a big fan of those things.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.440
 I'm a big fan of these topics.

24:05.440 --> 24:09.400
 I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.

24:09.400 --> 24:14.400
 So as you're saying, why do we find

24:15.200 --> 24:17.560
 the exploration of violence

24:17.560 --> 24:20.880
 and the relations between chimps so interesting?

24:20.880 --> 24:23.940
 What can they teach us about ourselves?

24:26.160 --> 24:29.760
 Until we had this information about chimpanzees,

24:29.760 --> 24:34.760
 it was possible to believe that the psychology

24:34.760 --> 24:39.760
 behind warfare was totally the result

24:43.640 --> 24:48.640
 of some kind of recent cultural innovation.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.360
 It had nothing to do with our biology.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.240
 Or if you like, that it's got something to do

24:54.240 --> 24:59.240
 with sin and God and the devil and that sort of thing.

24:59.240 --> 25:04.240
 But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully

25:07.120 --> 25:11.720
 about it is that it seems undoubtedly the case

25:11.720 --> 25:16.720
 that our evolutionary psychology has given us

25:18.480 --> 25:22.680
 the same kind of attitude towards violence

25:22.680 --> 25:27.680
 as has occurred in chimpanzees and in both species.

25:27.680 --> 25:32.080
 It has evolved because of its evolutionary significance.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.600
 In other words, because it's been helpful

25:34.600 --> 25:37.920
 to the individuals who have practiced it.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.880
 And now we know that, as I mentioned,

25:41.880 --> 25:44.120
 other species do this as well.

25:44.120 --> 25:49.120
 In fact, wolves, which this is a really kind of

25:50.160 --> 25:54.960
 ironical observation, Conrad Lorentz, who I mentioned

25:54.960 --> 25:59.640
 had been the person who thought that human aggression

25:59.640 --> 26:02.000
 in the form of killing members of our own species

26:02.000 --> 26:05.600
 was unique to our species, he was a great fan of wolves.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.000
 He studied wolves.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
 And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
 to harm each other in spats among members of the same group.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.160
 What happens is that one of them will roll over

26:19.160 --> 26:21.400
 and present their neck, much as you see in a dog park

26:21.400 --> 26:25.680
 nowadays, and the other might put their jaws on the neck

26:25.680 --> 26:26.640
 but will not bite.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.280
 Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves

26:30.280 --> 26:35.240
 in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting

26:35.240 --> 26:39.320
 for each other, they are in fierce competition,

26:39.320 --> 26:43.680
 and as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves

26:43.680 --> 26:47.520
 is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.360
 Wow.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.200
 So it's a really serious business.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.440
 The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern

26:54.440 --> 26:59.440
 of understanding animals in which you don't have

26:59.440 --> 27:03.400
 an instinct for violence, what you have is an instinct,

27:03.400 --> 27:06.840
 if you like, to use violence adaptively.

27:06.840 --> 27:10.760
 And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive,

27:10.760 --> 27:13.880
 if the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.440
 So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent

27:17.440 --> 27:21.280
 than others because of things like the frequency

27:21.280 --> 27:25.400
 with which a large party of males is likely to meet

27:25.400 --> 27:28.000
 a lone victim, and that's going to depend

27:28.000 --> 27:29.480
 on the local ecology.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.880
 But, you know, so the overall answer to the question

27:34.880 --> 27:38.400
 of what do chimps teach us is that we have to take

27:38.400 --> 27:42.400
 very seriously the notion that in humans,

27:42.400 --> 27:47.080
 the tendency to make war is a consequence

27:47.080 --> 27:50.480
 of a long term evolutionary adaptation

27:50.480 --> 27:53.040
 and not just a military ideology

27:53.040 --> 27:57.040
 or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.000
 And of course, you know, a reading of history,

28:01.000 --> 28:05.120
 a judicious reading of history fits that very easily

28:05.120 --> 28:07.760
 because war is so commonplace.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.080
 It's not an accident, so it's not a constraint.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.720
 It's not an accident, so it's not a construction

28:12.720 --> 28:14.560
 of human civilization.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.520
 It's deeply within us, violence.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.440
 So what's the difference between violence

28:20.440 --> 28:24.640
 on the individual level versus group is,

28:24.640 --> 28:26.880
 it seems like with chimps and with wolves,

28:26.880 --> 28:30.760
 there's something about the dynamic of multiple

28:32.280 --> 28:36.280
 chimps together that increase the chance of violence.

28:36.280 --> 28:41.000
 Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
 Like would an individual be as violent

28:45.000 --> 28:47.960
 as they might be as part of a group?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.240
 If we're talking about killing,

28:51.200 --> 28:54.200
 then violence in the sense of killing

28:54.200 --> 28:59.000
 is very much associated with a group.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.920
 And the reason is that individuals don't benefit

29:03.920 --> 29:05.560
 by getting into a fight

29:05.560 --> 29:08.680
 in which they risk being hurt themselves.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.640
 So it's only when you have overwhelming power

29:12.640 --> 29:16.760
 that the temptation to try and kill another victim

29:16.760 --> 29:20.640
 rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.

29:23.360 --> 29:27.840
 The average number of chimpanzee males

29:27.840 --> 29:30.480
 that attack a single male

29:30.480 --> 29:33.160
 in something like 50 observations

29:33.160 --> 29:36.000
 that have accumulated in the last 50 years

29:36.000 --> 29:38.400
 from various different study sites

29:38.400 --> 29:41.080
 is eight, eight to one.

29:41.920 --> 29:46.800
 Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one,

29:46.800 --> 29:49.440
 but that's getting risky.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.640
 But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.

29:51.640 --> 29:55.880
 I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,

29:55.880 --> 29:58.080
 another male on another foot, another male on an arm,

29:58.080 --> 29:59.640
 another male on another arm.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.480
 Now you have an immobilized victim

30:02.480 --> 30:06.320
 with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.680
 And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax

30:08.680 --> 30:10.160
 and tear off his testicles

30:10.160 --> 30:12.560
 and twist an arm until it breaks

30:12.560 --> 30:16.720
 and do this appalling damage with no weapons.

30:18.440 --> 30:23.440
 What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?

30:23.640 --> 30:24.880
 Is there something to be said

30:24.880 --> 30:27.800
 about the actual process of it?

30:27.800 --> 30:29.360
 Is there an artistry to it?

30:29.360 --> 30:32.400
 So if you look at human warfare,

30:32.400 --> 30:34.200
 there's different parts in history

30:34.200 --> 30:37.800
 prefer different kind of approaches to violence.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.240
 It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.760
 But just the nature of violence itself,

30:44.760 --> 30:47.520
 sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,

30:47.520 --> 30:49.080
 is it basically the same?

30:49.080 --> 30:53.400
 You improvise, you immobilize the victim,

30:53.400 --> 30:54.960
 and they just rip off different parts

30:54.960 --> 30:56.760
 of their body kind of thing?

30:56.760 --> 30:58.200
 Yeah, you have to understand

30:58.200 --> 31:01.640
 that these things are happening at high speed

31:01.640 --> 31:04.640
 in thick vegetation, mostly,

31:04.640 --> 31:08.640
 so that they have not been filmed carefully.

31:08.640 --> 31:12.320
 We have a few little glimpses of them

31:12.320 --> 31:15.200
 from one or two people like David Watts,

31:15.200 --> 31:16.400
 who's got some great video,

31:16.400 --> 31:19.840
 but we don't know enough to be able to say that.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.320
 It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles

31:22.320 --> 31:26.880
 that vary between communities, cultural styles,

31:26.880 --> 31:28.920
 but it is possible.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.720
 It is possible, and one thing that is striking

31:32.720 --> 31:37.000
 is that the number of times that an individual victim

31:37.000 --> 31:41.200
 has been killed immediately has been higher

31:41.200 --> 31:45.040
 in Kibale forest in Uganda

31:45.040 --> 31:48.480
 than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.000
 It's conceivable that's just chance.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.160
 We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.240
 I can't remember the exact numbers,

31:55.240 --> 32:00.240
 but 10 versus 15 or something.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.240
 So maybe they damaged to the point

32:04.240 --> 32:07.080
 of expecting a death in one place

32:07.080 --> 32:08.960
 and they just finished it off in the other,

32:08.960 --> 32:11.920
 but most likely that sort of difference

32:11.920 --> 32:16.920
 will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.720
 You know, human beings are able to conceive

32:19.720 --> 32:23.200
 of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.

32:23.200 --> 32:27.280
 Is there any of that for chimps

32:28.360 --> 32:30.320
 when they're thinking about violence?

32:30.320 --> 32:33.360
 Is violence, like what is the nature

32:33.360 --> 32:36.360
 of their conception of violence, do you think?

32:36.360 --> 32:41.360
 Do they realize they're taking another conscious being's life

32:41.440 --> 32:45.760
 or is it some kind of like optimization

32:45.760 --> 32:48.360
 over the use of resources or something like that?

32:48.360 --> 32:53.280
 I don't think it's, I can't think of any way

32:53.280 --> 32:55.120
 to get an answer to the question

32:55.120 --> 32:56.680
 of what they know about that.

32:58.080 --> 33:03.080
 I think that the way to think about the motivation

33:03.240 --> 33:08.240
 is rather like the motivation in sex.

33:09.800 --> 33:14.560
 So when males are interested in having sex with a female,

33:14.560 --> 33:18.800
 whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,

33:18.800 --> 33:20.240
 they don't think about the fact

33:20.240 --> 33:25.200
 that what this is going to do is to lead to a baby, mostly.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.040
 You're right.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.520
 Mostly what they're thinking about is,

33:27.520 --> 33:28.760
 I wanna get my end away.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.440
 And I think that it's a similar kind of process

33:34.440 --> 33:35.720
 with the chimps.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.640
 What they are thinking about is,

33:38.640 --> 33:41.600
 I wanna kill this individual.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.520
 And it's hard to imagine that taking

33:45.520 --> 33:47.560
 the other individual's perspective

33:47.560 --> 33:50.160
 and thinking about what it means for them to die

33:50.160 --> 33:51.720
 is gonna be an important part of that.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.720
 In fact, there's reasons to think

33:53.720 --> 33:55.080
 it should not be an important part of it

33:55.080 --> 33:56.040
 because it might inhibit them

33:56.040 --> 33:57.920
 and they don't want to be inhibited.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.640
 The more efficient they are in doing this, the better.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.440
 But I think it's interesting to think about

34:03.440 --> 34:04.680
 this whole motivational question

34:04.680 --> 34:09.680
 because it does produce this rather haunting thought

34:09.680 --> 34:11.640
 that there has been selection

34:11.640 --> 34:15.480
 in favor of enthusiasm about killing.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.920
 And in our relatively gentle

34:21.920 --> 34:26.480
 and deliberately moral society that we have today,

34:26.480 --> 34:28.920
 it's very difficult for us to face the thought

34:28.920 --> 34:32.400
 that in all of us,

34:32.400 --> 34:37.160
 there might've been residue

34:37.160 --> 34:42.160
 and more than that, sort of an active potential

34:42.160 --> 34:46.480
 for that thought of really enjoying killing someone else.

34:47.520 --> 34:52.520
 But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously

34:52.520 --> 34:56.840
 by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true

34:57.840 --> 35:02.840
 that the ordinary human male would be delighted

35:03.480 --> 35:06.520
 to be part of a group that was killing someone.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.360
 What you've got to do is to be in a position

35:10.360 --> 35:12.520
 where you're regarding the victim

35:12.520 --> 35:16.360
 as dangerous and thoroughly hostile.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.000
 But the pure enjoyment of violence.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.880
 There's, I don't know if you know this historian,

35:23.880 --> 35:25.920
 Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.

35:25.920 --> 35:30.920
 He has an episode, three, four hour episode

35:32.040 --> 35:33.200
 that I recommend to others.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.880
 It's quite haunting.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.280
 But he takes us through an entire history.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.720
 It's called painfotainment.

35:40.720 --> 35:44.480
 The history of humans

35:45.360 --> 35:48.840
 enjoying the murder of others in a large group.

35:48.840 --> 35:53.560
 So like public executions were long part of human history.

35:53.560 --> 35:58.200
 And there's something that for some reason,

35:58.200 --> 36:03.200
 humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.640
 And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.

36:06.640 --> 36:11.240
 For example, he said if it was possible to televise,

36:11.240 --> 36:13.120
 to stream online for example,

36:13.120 --> 36:15.800
 the execution and the murder of somebody

36:15.800 --> 36:17.840
 or even the torture of somebody,

36:17.840 --> 36:22.840
 that a very large fraction of the population on earth

36:23.080 --> 36:24.840
 would not be able to look away.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.600
 They'd be drawn to that somehow.

36:26.600 --> 36:31.560
 As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.840
 So you think that's part of us in there somewhere.

36:33.840 --> 36:38.840
 That selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing

36:39.160 --> 36:41.800
 and the enjoyment of observing

36:44.120 --> 36:47.280
 those in our tribe doing the killing.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.000
 Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end

36:51.000 --> 36:52.520
 is critical I think.

36:52.520 --> 36:57.320
 Because it would be a little bit weird I think

36:57.320 --> 37:01.920
 to imagine a lot of enjoyment about people

37:01.920 --> 37:04.240
 in your own tribe being killed.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.240
 I don't think we're interested in violence

37:06.240 --> 37:08.240
 for violence's sake that much.

37:09.640 --> 37:14.640
 It's when you get these social boundaries set up.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.240
 And in today's world, happily,

37:20.640 --> 37:23.800
 we kind of are already one world.

37:23.800 --> 37:28.800
 You have to dehumanize someone to get to the point

37:29.160 --> 37:34.160
 where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe

37:34.160 --> 37:37.360
 at some level, which is the whole human species.

37:37.360 --> 37:41.120
 But in ancient times, that would not have been true.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.600
 Because in ancient times,

37:43.880 --> 37:47.240
 there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers

37:47.240 --> 37:50.360
 in which the appearance of a stranger

37:50.360 --> 37:55.360
 would lead to an immediate response of shooting on sight.

37:56.280 --> 37:59.240
 Because what was human was the people

37:59.240 --> 38:01.960
 that were in your society.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.840
 And the other things that actually looked like us

38:04.840 --> 38:08.520
 and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.360
 So there was a kind of automatic dehumanization

38:12.360 --> 38:14.920
 of everybody that didn't speak our language

38:14.920 --> 38:19.200
 or hadn't already somehow become recognized

38:19.200 --> 38:24.200
 as sufficiently like us to escape

38:25.280 --> 38:27.760
 the dehumanization contact.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.960
 And so hopefully the story of human history

38:29.960 --> 38:34.960
 is that tribalism fades away,

38:35.240 --> 38:39.120
 that our dehumanization, the natural desire to dehumanize

38:39.120 --> 38:42.280
 or tendency to dehumanize groups

38:42.280 --> 38:45.800
 that are not within this tribe, decreases over time.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.760
 And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.520
 Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.240
 And the great sort of concern, of course,

38:56.240 --> 39:00.360
 is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts

39:00.360 --> 39:02.120
 and then dehumanization happens

39:02.120 --> 39:03.680
 and then violence is released.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.280
 As Hannah Arendt says,

39:06.280 --> 39:10.120
 there currently is no known alternative to war

39:10.120 --> 39:15.120
 as a means of settling really important conflicts.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.720
 So if we look at the big picture,

39:18.720 --> 39:21.960
 what role has violence or do you think violence

39:21.960 --> 39:24.960
 has played in the evolution of Homo sapiens?

39:24.960 --> 39:29.640
 So we are quite an intelligent, quite a beautiful,

39:29.640 --> 39:32.920
 particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.

39:32.920 --> 39:39.920
 What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?

39:41.760 --> 39:43.880
 Well, I think that violence was responsible

39:43.880 --> 39:46.120
 for creating your Homo sapiens.

39:49.280 --> 39:54.280
 And that raises the question of what Homo sapiens is.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.000
 Yes.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.720
 Yeah, exactly.

39:58.720 --> 40:03.720
 So nowadays people begin the concept

40:06.640 --> 40:10.800
 of what Homo sapiens is by thinking about features

40:10.800 --> 40:12.360
 that are very obviously different

40:12.360 --> 40:14.680
 from all of the other species of Homo.

40:15.720 --> 40:20.720
 And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,

40:21.160 --> 40:24.240
 our relatively small face, these are characteristics

40:24.240 --> 40:27.720
 which are developed in a relatively modern way

40:27.720 --> 40:31.120
 by about 170,000 years ago.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.960
 So that's one of the earliest skulls in Africa

40:33.960 --> 40:36.560
 that really captures that.

40:36.560 --> 40:41.560
 But it has been argued that that is an episode

40:44.280 --> 40:49.280
 in a process that has been started substantially earlier.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.200
 And there's no doubt that that's true.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.080
 Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing

40:55.080 --> 41:00.080
 pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.360
 And it goes back to 300,000 years ago,

41:03.360 --> 41:08.360
 315 literally is the time, the best estimate of a date

41:08.560 --> 41:11.920
 for a series of bones from Morocco

41:13.120 --> 41:16.880
 that have been dated three or four years ago at that time

41:16.880 --> 41:21.400
 and have been characterized as earliest Homo sapiens.

41:21.400 --> 41:25.600
 Now at that point, they are only beginning

41:25.600 --> 41:27.760
 the trend of sapionization.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.760
 And that trend consists basically of gracilization

41:31.760 --> 41:35.680
 of making our ancestors less robust,

41:36.960 --> 41:40.680
 shorter faces, smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,

41:40.680 --> 41:45.440
 narrower face, thinner cranium,

41:45.440 --> 41:51.440
 all these things that are associated with reduced violence.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.240
 Okay, so that's saying what,

41:54.240 --> 41:56.120
 that's Homo sapiens beginning.

41:56.120 --> 41:59.600
 So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago

41:59.600 --> 42:01.560
 because by 315,000 years ago,

42:01.560 --> 42:03.320
 you've already got something recognizable.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.160
 So you're more on that side of things

42:05.160 --> 42:06.680
 that those are this gradual process.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.200
 It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.

42:09.200 --> 42:14.200
 It started like 400,000 years ago and it's just.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.160
 It started three to 400,000 years ago

42:16.160 --> 42:19.680
 and if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.

42:19.680 --> 42:23.320
 And then if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.160
 And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.720
 It's all the way, it's just getting

42:26.720 --> 42:28.880
 more and more like the moderns.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.520
 So the question is what happened

42:30.520 --> 42:32.320
 between three and 400,000 years ago

42:32.320 --> 42:34.440
 to produce Homo sapiens?

42:34.440 --> 42:37.840
 And I think we have a pretty good answer now.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.880
 And the answer comes from violence.

42:39.880 --> 42:43.840
 And the story begins by focusing on this question.

42:43.840 --> 42:48.840
 Why is it that in the human species,

42:48.880 --> 42:51.320
 we are unique among all primates

42:51.320 --> 42:55.360
 in not having an alpha male in any group

42:56.760 --> 42:59.400
 in the sense that what we don't have

42:59.400 --> 43:03.600
 is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?

43:05.040 --> 43:10.040
 And the answer that has been portrayed most richly

43:10.040 --> 43:15.040
 by Christopher Boehm and whose work I've elaborated on

43:15.040 --> 43:20.040
 is that only in humans do you have a system

43:21.080 --> 43:26.080
 by which any male who tries to bully others

43:26.320 --> 43:29.720
 and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla

43:29.720 --> 43:31.720
 or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo

43:31.720 --> 43:33.960
 or an alpha baboon or anything like that,

43:33.960 --> 43:36.600
 any male who tries to do that in humans

43:36.600 --> 43:40.920
 gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.920
 That coalition.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.920
 That's a really good picture of human society, yes.

43:46.920 --> 43:47.760
 I like it.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.760
 Okay, and that's the way all our societies work now.

43:50.760 --> 43:51.600
 Yes.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.680
 Because individuals try and be alpha

43:53.680 --> 43:55.040
 and then they get taken out.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.080
 Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves

43:57.080 --> 44:01.360
 as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.200
 Exactly.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.120
 And that's the way we think of ourselves.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.600
 I suppose that's what democracy is.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.440
 Exactly.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.280
 Yes.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.120
 Exactly.

44:09.120 --> 44:14.120
 Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.920
 Well, what alpha males are are males

44:16.920 --> 44:20.720
 who respond with high reactive violence

44:20.720 --> 44:22.840
 to any challenge to their status.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.160
 You see it all the time in primates.

44:25.160 --> 44:28.120
 Some beta male thinks he's getting strong

44:28.120 --> 44:31.800
 and maturing in wisdom and so on,

44:31.800 --> 44:35.960
 and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male.

44:35.960 --> 44:39.440
 And the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.

44:39.440 --> 44:42.240
 Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes

44:42.240 --> 44:44.440
 and then take an opportunity to attack him.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.440
 All of these primates have got a high tendency

44:51.440 --> 44:53.320
 for reactive aggression,

44:53.320 --> 44:56.520
 and that enables the possibility of alpha males.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.360
 We don't.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.520
 We have this great reduction, as I talked about earlier.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.160
 And the question is, when did that reduction happen?

45:04.040 --> 45:08.560
 Well, cut to the famous experiments

45:08.560 --> 45:12.320
 by the Russian biologist Dmitry Belyaev,

45:12.320 --> 45:16.320
 who tried domesticating wild animals.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.960
 When you domesticate wild animals,

45:19.960 --> 45:23.760
 what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.

45:24.680 --> 45:28.280
 You are selecting those individuals to breed

45:28.280 --> 45:32.000
 who are most willing to be approached by a human

45:32.000 --> 45:34.400
 or by another member of their own species

45:34.400 --> 45:39.400
 and are least likely to erupt in reactive aggression.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.960
 And you only have to do that for a few generations

45:42.960 --> 45:47.120
 to discover that there are changes in the skull.

45:47.120 --> 45:52.120
 And those changes consist of shorter face, smaller teeth,

45:52.120 --> 45:54.200
 reduced maleness,

45:54.200 --> 45:56.720
 the males become increasingly female like,

45:58.120 --> 45:59.720
 and reduced brain size.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.320
 Well, the changes that are characteristic

46:03.320 --> 46:05.240
 of domesticated animals in general

46:05.240 --> 46:08.760
 compared to wild animals are all found in Homo sapiens

46:08.760 --> 46:11.520
 compared to our early ancestors.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.240
 So it's a very strong signal

46:13.240 --> 46:15.920
 that when we first see Homo sapiens,

46:15.920 --> 46:18.520
 what we're seeing is that there's a lot of change

46:18.520 --> 46:20.560
 in the shape of the animal.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.920
 What we're seeing is evidence

46:22.920 --> 46:26.200
 of a reduction in reactive aggression.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.320
 And that suggests that what's happening with Homo sapiens

46:29.320 --> 46:32.040
 is that that is the point

46:32.040 --> 46:35.440
 at which there is selection against the alpha males.

46:35.440 --> 46:39.280
 And therefore, the way in which the selection happened

46:39.280 --> 46:41.440
 would have been the way it happens today.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.880
 The beta males take them out.

46:44.160 --> 46:47.480
 So I think that Homo sapiens is a species

46:47.480 --> 46:52.400
 characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression

46:53.280 --> 46:55.320
 as a kind of incidental consequence

46:55.320 --> 46:58.480
 of the suppression of the alpha male.

46:58.480 --> 47:00.760
 And the story of our species

47:00.760 --> 47:04.040
 is the story of how the beta males took charge

47:05.720 --> 47:10.200
 and have been responsible for the generation

47:10.200 --> 47:11.960
 of a new kind of human.

47:11.960 --> 47:16.960
 And incidentally, for imposing on the society

47:20.120 --> 47:23.160
 a new set of values.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.640
 Because when those beta males discovered

47:25.640 --> 47:28.760
 that they could take out the previous alpha male

47:28.760 --> 47:29.880
 and continue to do so,

47:29.880 --> 47:32.080
 because in every generation there'll always be some male

47:32.080 --> 47:35.200
 who says, maybe I'll become the alpha male.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.200
 So they just keep chopping them down.

47:38.560 --> 47:41.400
 In discovering that, they also obviously discovered

47:41.400 --> 47:43.400
 that they could kill anybody in the group.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.240
 Mm hmm.

47:44.240 --> 47:49.240
 Females, young males, anybody who didn't follow their values.

47:51.960 --> 47:56.960
 And so this story is one in which the males of our species,

47:58.560 --> 48:00.400
 and these would be the breeding males,

48:01.920 --> 48:05.800
 have been able to impose their values on everybody else.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.000
 And there is two kind of values.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.560
 There's one kind of value is things

48:08.560 --> 48:09.560
 that are good for the group.

48:09.560 --> 48:11.480
 Like, thou shalt not murder.

48:11.480 --> 48:12.920
 Mm hmm.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.080
 And the other kind of value is things

48:15.080 --> 48:17.080
 that are good for the males.

48:18.480 --> 48:20.240
 Such as, hey, guess what?

48:20.240 --> 48:22.480
 When good food comes in, males get it first.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.320
 Yes.

48:24.520 --> 48:27.520
 I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals

48:27.520 --> 48:30.920
 could outcompete the others.

48:32.040 --> 48:34.400
 Do you have a sense of why,

48:34.400 --> 48:36.400
 or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals

48:36.400 --> 48:38.240
 and all the other early humans.

48:38.240 --> 48:43.240
 Why did Homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish

48:43.240 --> 48:44.680
 and all the other ones,

48:44.680 --> 48:48.000
 all the other branches of evolution died out?

48:49.600 --> 48:50.440
 Or got murdered out.

48:50.440 --> 48:55.040
 I mean, nowadays, when Homo sapiens meets Homo sapiens,

48:55.040 --> 48:58.120
 and we don't know each other initially,

48:58.120 --> 48:59.640
 then conflict breaks out

48:59.640 --> 49:04.640
 and the more militarily able group wins.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.720
 We've seen that everywhere throughout the age

49:07.720 --> 49:11.120
 of exploration and throughout history.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.880
 So I'm rather surprised.

49:13.880 --> 49:18.280
 The conventional wisdom that you see nowadays

49:18.280 --> 49:22.200
 in contemporary anthropology is very reluctant

49:22.200 --> 49:25.840
 to point to success in warfare

49:25.840 --> 49:30.280
 as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals

49:30.280 --> 49:33.560
 within about 3000 years of the sapiens.

49:33.560 --> 49:36.880
 Coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.

49:37.920 --> 49:40.440
 And people are much more inclined to say,

49:40.440 --> 49:43.440
 well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,

49:43.440 --> 49:48.440
 so they just couldn't survive the demographic sort of sweep

49:49.800 --> 49:52.160
 or the disease came in.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.680
 And maybe those things might've been important,

49:54.680 --> 49:58.200
 but far and away, the most obvious possibility

49:58.200 --> 50:02.120
 is that sapiens were just,

50:02.120 --> 50:06.720
 sapiens were just powerful.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.360
 They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.

50:10.360 --> 50:11.600
 They had better weapons.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.840
 They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows,

50:15.840 --> 50:20.200
 to judge from the little microlith bits of flake,

50:22.000 --> 50:23.520
 which the Neanderthals didn't.

50:25.160 --> 50:29.000
 Nowadays, there's evidence of interbreeding,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.400
 quite extensive interbreeding

50:30.400 --> 50:33.120
 between sapiens and Neanderthals,

50:33.120 --> 50:35.160
 as well as with some other groups.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.280
 And sometimes people say, well, you know,

50:37.280 --> 50:38.560
 so they loved each other.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.440
 They made love, not war.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.760
 I think they made love and war.

50:42.760 --> 50:46.520
 And it wouldn't necessarily mean too loving.

50:46.520 --> 50:49.280
 I mean, if you just follow through

50:49.280 --> 50:51.720
 from typical ethnographies nowadays

50:51.720 --> 50:55.440
 of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,

50:55.440 --> 50:56.880
 they didn't know each other,

50:56.880 --> 51:00.520
 then you can imagine that Neanderthal females

51:00.520 --> 51:02.400
 would essentially be captured

51:02.400 --> 51:05.360
 and taken into sapiens groups.

51:07.080 --> 51:12.080
 Maybe you can comment on this cautiously and eloquently.

51:13.840 --> 51:18.200
 What's the role of sexual violence in human evolution?

51:18.200 --> 51:21.480
 Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.920
 You've also mentioned that some of these rules

51:23.920 --> 51:28.760
 are defined by the male side of the society.

51:28.760 --> 51:31.600
 What's the role of sexual violence in this story?

51:33.080 --> 51:34.080
 I think you've got to distinguish

51:34.080 --> 51:35.840
 between groups and within groups.

51:37.600 --> 51:42.600
 And I think the world has been slowly waking up

51:43.200 --> 51:46.000
 over the last several decades

51:46.000 --> 51:51.000
 to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
 And that to me says that it's just another example

51:58.680 --> 52:03.680
 of power corrupts because when frustrated,

52:04.800 --> 52:09.800
 scared, elated soldiers come upon females

52:11.400 --> 52:16.400
 in a group that has been essential dehumanization of,

52:16.400 --> 52:20.520
 then they get carried away by opportunity.

52:21.680 --> 52:25.080
 It is not always possible to argue

52:25.080 --> 52:28.480
 that this is adaptive nowadays

52:28.480 --> 52:31.120
 because you get lots and lots of stories

52:31.120 --> 52:36.120
 of women being abused to the point of being killed.

52:38.640 --> 52:41.200
 She'll be gang raped and then killed.

52:41.200 --> 52:46.120
 There's lots of terrible cases of that reported

52:46.120 --> 52:47.680
 from all sorts of different wars.

52:49.560 --> 52:54.560
 But you can see that that could build on a pattern

52:54.840 --> 52:57.360
 that would have been adaptive

52:57.360 --> 53:01.520
 if happening under so much less extreme circumstances.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.160
 The war is very extreme nowadays

53:05.160 --> 53:07.440
 in the sense that you get battles

53:07.440 --> 53:11.240
 in which people are sent by a military hierarchy

53:11.240 --> 53:14.120
 into a war situation in which they do not feel

53:14.120 --> 53:16.440
 what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt,

53:16.440 --> 53:18.600
 which would have been that if we attack,

53:18.600 --> 53:21.920
 we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.

53:21.920 --> 53:25.840
 Nowadays, you're sent in across the Somme or whatever it is

53:25.840 --> 53:28.640
 and there's a very high chance you will be killed.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.280
 And that's totally unnatural

53:30.280 --> 53:33.040
 and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.

53:34.760 --> 53:37.480
 Then there's sexual coercion within groups.

53:37.480 --> 53:42.120
 And so that takes various kinds of forms.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.720
 But nowadays, of course,

53:44.720 --> 53:46.960
 I think people recognize increasingly

53:46.960 --> 53:51.960
 that the principle form of sexual intimidation

53:53.440 --> 53:57.080
 and rape occurs within relationships.

53:58.400 --> 53:59.840
 It's not stranger rape

53:59.840 --> 54:03.400
 that is really statistically important.

54:03.400 --> 54:08.400
 There's much more what happens behind the walls

54:08.400 --> 54:13.400
 of a bedroom where people have been living for some time.

54:14.400 --> 54:19.400
 And just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.

54:20.400 --> 54:25.320
 One is that it may seem odd

54:25.320 --> 54:30.320
 that males should think it a good idea, as it were,

54:34.360 --> 54:37.800
 to impose themselves sexually on someone

54:37.800 --> 54:39.640
 with whom they have a relationship.

54:40.960 --> 54:45.480
 But what they're doing is intimidating someone

54:45.480 --> 54:48.840
 in a relationship in which the relative power

54:48.840 --> 54:52.280
 in the relationship has continuing significance

54:52.280 --> 54:53.800
 for a long time.

54:53.800 --> 54:58.320
 And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.360
 It's to do with domestic relationships,

55:01.360 --> 55:05.680
 it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.

55:05.680 --> 55:09.800
 It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression

55:09.800 --> 55:12.480
 is one of the tools to regain power,

55:12.480 --> 55:14.880
 gain power, gain more power and that kind of thing.

55:14.880 --> 55:16.680
 Yeah, exactly.

55:16.680 --> 55:21.320
 And in that respect, it's worth noting

55:21.320 --> 55:25.680
 that although this wasn't appreciated for some time,

55:25.680 --> 55:28.320
 it's emerging that in a bunch of primates

55:28.320 --> 55:32.160
 you have somewhat similar, somewhat parallel

55:32.160 --> 55:35.000
 kinds of sexual intimidation

55:35.000 --> 55:37.800
 where males will target particular females,

55:37.800 --> 55:41.280
 even in a group in which the norm is for females

55:41.280 --> 55:43.480
 to mate with multiple males.

55:43.480 --> 55:45.920
 But each male will target a particular female

55:45.920 --> 55:49.560
 and the more he is aggressive towards her,

55:49.560 --> 55:53.160
 then the more she conforms to his wishes

55:53.160 --> 55:55.240
 when he wants to mate.

55:55.240 --> 55:57.920
 So a long term pattern of sexual intimidation.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.320
 So there's that aspect.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.680
 The other aspect I would just note is that

56:02.680 --> 56:07.680
 males get away with a lot compared to females

56:10.240 --> 56:13.680
 in any kind of intersexual conflict.

56:16.160 --> 56:19.960
 So the punishment, here's one example of this,

56:19.960 --> 56:23.520
 the punishment for a husband killing a wife

56:23.520 --> 56:25.640
 has always been much less than the punishment

56:25.640 --> 56:27.120
 for a wife killing a husband.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.200
 And you see similar sorts of things

56:32.200 --> 56:37.200
 in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.

56:38.680 --> 56:42.960
 I bring this up in the context of males

56:42.960 --> 56:47.200
 sexually intimidating their partners,

56:47.200 --> 56:49.160
 be it wives or whoever,

56:50.680 --> 56:52.520
 because it's a reminder that

56:53.560 --> 56:57.800
 it's basically a patriarchal world that we have come from.

56:57.800 --> 57:02.080
 A patriarchal world in which male alliances

57:02.080 --> 57:06.280
 tend to support males and take advantage of the fact

57:06.280 --> 57:09.760
 that they have political power at the expense of females.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.000
 And I would say that that all goes back

57:12.000 --> 57:14.800
 to what happened three to 400,000 years ago

57:14.800 --> 57:16.680
 when the beta males took charge

57:16.680 --> 57:19.160
 and they started imposing their own norms

57:19.160 --> 57:22.520
 on society as a whole and they've continued to do so.

57:22.520 --> 57:26.200
 And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,

57:26.200 --> 57:28.800
 we are not a patriarchal society.

57:28.800 --> 57:33.000
 Well, it's true that the laws try and make it even handed

57:33.000 --> 57:35.440
 nowadays between males and females,

57:35.440 --> 57:38.840
 but obviously we are patriarchal de facto

57:38.840 --> 57:43.840
 because society still in many ways supports men

57:45.360 --> 57:48.040
 better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.

57:48.040 --> 57:50.560
 So beta male patriarchal.

57:51.880 --> 57:55.320
 If we're looking at the evolutionary history.

57:55.320 --> 57:58.880
 Okay, is there, maybe sticking on Jordan for a second,

57:58.880 --> 58:03.880
 is there, so he's a psychologist, right?

58:04.440 --> 58:09.440
 And what part of the picture do you think he's missing

58:09.960 --> 58:14.800
 in analyzing the human relations?

58:16.120 --> 58:20.120
 Like what does he need to understand

58:20.120 --> 58:22.400
 about our origins in violence

58:22.400 --> 58:24.960
 and the way that society has been constructed?

58:24.960 --> 58:29.960
 Or I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives,

58:30.320 --> 58:34.520
 but I just think that what he's doing

58:34.520 --> 58:37.800
 in that particular example is focusing

58:37.800 --> 58:40.160
 on the legalistic position.

58:41.080 --> 58:46.080
 And that's great that you do not find formal patriarchy

58:47.480 --> 58:49.720
 in the law, anything like to the extent

58:49.720 --> 58:53.800
 that you could find it 100 years ago and so on.

58:53.800 --> 58:56.080
 Women have got the vote now, hooray.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.640
 But it took a long time for women to get the vote.

58:58.640 --> 59:03.640
 And it remains the case that women suffer

59:06.320 --> 59:08.560
 in various kinds of ways.

59:08.560 --> 59:13.560
 I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners

59:15.480 --> 59:18.560
 is treated much more rudely than a male

59:18.560 --> 59:21.240
 who has lots of sexual partners.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.120
 There are all sorts of informal ways

59:23.120 --> 59:27.200
 in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.

59:27.200 --> 59:32.200
 And if we look at the surface layer of the law,

59:32.560 --> 59:36.320
 we may miss the deeper human nature,

59:38.000 --> 59:41.200
 like the origins of our human nature that still operates

59:41.200 --> 59:42.600
 no matter what the law says.

59:42.600 --> 59:47.120
 Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward

59:47.120 --> 59:50.960
 because it includes some unpleasant features

59:50.960 --> 59:54.200
 that when we sit back and reflect about them,

59:54.200 --> 59:57.920
 we would like them to go away.

59:57.920 --> 1:00:02.920
 But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:10.000
 to try and have sex with at least one woman,

1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:14.040
 and you know, often lots of women.

1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:17.280
 And so men are constantly putting pressure on women

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.880
 in ways that women find unpleasant.

1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:21.680
 And if men sit back and reflect about it,

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:22.880
 they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this.

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:26.280
 But actually, it just goes on because of human nature.

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:30.920
 So maybe looking at particular humans in history,

1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.840
 let's talk about Genghis Khan.

1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:37.200
 So is this particular human who was one

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:42.200
 of the most famous examples of large scale violence,

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:45.760
 is he a deep representative of human nature

1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:47.920
 or is he a rare exception?

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:52.920
 Well, I think that it's easy to imagine

1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.440
 that most men could have become Genghis Khan.

1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:02.240
 It's possible that he had a particular streak

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:03.280
 of psychopathy.

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:11.400
 You know, it's striking that by the time you become

1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:16.400
 immensely powerful, then your willingness

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:23.120
 to do terrible things for the interest of yourself

1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:28.120
 and your group becomes very high.

1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:36.360
 Stalin, Mao Zedong, these sorts of people have histories

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.360
 in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.

1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:41.240
 But by the time they are big leaders,

1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:43.160
 they are really psychopathic in the sense

1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:47.680
 that they do not follow the ordinary morality

1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:52.680
 of considering the harm that they are doing

1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:53.680
 to their victims.

1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:00.400
 What kind of experiment would we need to discover

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:04.120
 whether or not anybody could fall into this position?

1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.120
 I don't know, but Lord Acton's famous dictum

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:14.120
 was power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:16.360
 And then the point that people often forget

1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:17.880
 is the next sentence that he said,

1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:22.120
 which is, great men are almost always bad men.

1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:23.680
 And that is right.

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:27.160
 It is very difficult to find a great man in history

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:30.440
 who was not responsible for terrible things.

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:35.440
 I think there's some aspect of it that it's not just power.

1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:40.440
 I think men who have been the most destructive

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:45.440
 in human history are not psychopathic completely.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.840
 They have convinced themselves of an idea.

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:52.320
 It's like the idea is psychopathic.

1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:55.080
 Stalin, for example, Hitler's a complicated one.

1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:57.240
 I think he was legitimately insane.

1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:02.240
 But I think Stalin has convinced himself that he's doing good.

1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:06.240
 So the idea of communism is the thing that's psychopathic

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.880
 in his mind, like it bred, you construct the worldview

1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:14.360
 in which the violence is justified, the cruelty is justified.

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:18.320
 So there, in that sense, first of all,

1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:21.320
 you can construct experiments, unethical experiments

1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:25.280
 that could test this, but in that sense,

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:30.280
 anybody else could have been in Stalin's position.

1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:34.080
 It's the idea that could overtake the mind

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.320
 of a human being and in so doing justify cruel acts.

1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:42.080
 And that seems to be, at least in part, unique to humans,

1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:45.520
 is the ability to hold ideas in our minds

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:49.360
 and share those ideas and use those ideas

1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:53.720
 to convince ourselves that proactive violence

1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:56.120
 on a large scale is a good idea.

1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:58.920
 So that, I don't know if you have a comment.

1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:01.960
 I suppose so, I mean, but it seems to me

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:06.960
 what really motivated Stalin was not so much communism

1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:11.200
 as the retention of power.

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.400
 So once he became leader and in the process

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:20.920
 of becoming leader, he was absolutely desperate

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:24.160
 to get rid of anybody who was a challenger.

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:28.480
 He was deeply suspicious, suspicious of anybody,

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:32.560
 even on his side, who might possibly be showing

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:36.040
 a glimmerings of willingness to challenge him.

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:41.040
 So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,

1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:46.920
 Kirov was a great communist, Trotsky was a great communist,

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:51.920
 all his rivals, and I mean, when he went into the towns

1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:55.240
 and murdered people by the tenths of thousands.

1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:56.200
 They were all communists.

1:04:56.200 --> 1:05:00.120
 A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.

1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:02.560
 But what he was worried about was that they were rivals

1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:03.400
 to him.

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:08.880
 I suppose the thought is I am the best person

1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:13.880
 to bring about a global sort of embrace of communism

1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:17.640
 and others are not, and so we have to get rid

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:18.480
 of those others.

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:20.480
 Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:25.480
 but I mean, maybe you know enough about Stalin to really.

1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:29.760
 Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.520
 is from my understanding and sense, of course,

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:37.520
 we can't know for sure, is he believed in communism.

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.600
 This wasn't purely a game of power.

1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:45.280
 Now, he got drunk with power pretty quickly,

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:49.800
 but he really believed for, I believe his whole life,

1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:53.120
 that communism is good for the world.

1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:58.120
 And that, I don't know what role that belief plays

1:05:58.360 --> 1:06:02.880
 with the more natural human desire for power.

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:05.000
 I don't know, but it just seems like.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.320
 As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:09.520
 on his journey.

1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:11.440
 On his journey.

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:15.520
 Hmm, but it's not, that calculus doesn't work that way.

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:18.400
 There's humans who are communists

1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:20.880
 and then there's the idea of communism.

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:25.720
 So for him, in his delusional world view,

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:30.280
 killing a few people is worth the final result

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.720
 of bringing communism to the whole world.

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.320
 But it was more than that, again, because I mean,

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:37.600
 he really wanted power for the Soviet Union

1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:42.600
 and so surely the reason that he orchestrated

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:48.920
 the export of wheat from Ukraine

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:53.920
 and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation

1:06:53.920 --> 1:06:56.040
 was because he wanted to sell it on the market

1:06:56.040 --> 1:06:57.560
 in order to be able to build up

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:01.120
 the power of the Soviet Union.

1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:03.600
 Alternative view of communism might have been,

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:07.160
 well, let's just make sure everybody survives

1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:09.560
 and make sure everybody has enough to eat

1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:13.640
 and we'll all be mutually supportive in a communal network.

1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:16.160
 But no, but he wanted the power for the country.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:19.320
 Well, I guess exactly, so that it's not even communism,

1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:21.800
 the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that,

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:23.080
 it's the country.

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:27.480
 I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:31.280
 for the individual, it's power for a vision

1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:34.840
 for this great nation, the Soviet Union.

1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:39.320
 And it's similar with Hitler, the guy believed

1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:42.320
 that this is a great nation, Germany,

1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:47.320
 and it's a nation that's been wronged throughout history

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:49.960
 and needs to be righted.

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:54.440
 And there's some dance between the individual human

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.560
 and the tribe.

1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:00.040
 Yes, absolutely, yes, and so just like chimpanzees,

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:04.080
 we are fiercely tribal and the tribalism resides

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:09.080
 particularly in male psychology and it's very scary

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:14.200
 because once you assemble a set of males

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:18.880
 who share a tribal identity, then they have power

1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:23.880
 that they can exert with very little concern

1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:28.160
 about what they're doing to damage other people.

1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:33.920
 Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:36.120
 we talked about the corrupting nature of power,

1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:38.680
 do you think that's a manifestation

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:42.840
 of those early origins of violence?

1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:46.040
 What's the connection of this desire for power

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.000
 and our proclivity for violence?

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:54.480
 You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?

1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:56.920
 Power on behalf of a group.

1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:57.760
 Yes.

1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:00.040
 And yeah, that seems to me to go right back

1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:04.520
 to a deep evolutionary origin

1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:07.200
 because you see essentially the same thing

1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:10.520
 in a whole bunch of animals.

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:15.520
 That most of the sort of cognitively complex animals

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:20.240
 live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.280
 And so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed

1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:28.800
 in almost all of the primates.

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.720
 The difference between us and, you know,

1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.520
 chimpanzees and humans on the one hand

1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:36.520
 and other primates on the other

1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.280
 is that we kill and they don't.

1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:42.880
 And the reason they don't is because they never meet

1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:46.000
 in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:49.160
 So two groups of baboons, you know,

1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:52.560
 there's 30 on this side and 50 on this side, fine.

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.640
 Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else

1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:59.560
 because the serious risks involved.

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:02.160
 But nevertheless, they are tribal.

1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:06.120
 So, you know, they will have fairly intense

1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:09.600
 intergroup interactions in which everybody knows

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:12.560
 who is on whose side.

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:17.560
 And the longterm consequences of winning those battles,

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:23.760
 nonlethal battles, is that the dominance get access

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:28.680
 to larger areas of land, more safety and so on,

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:33.680
 with chances are better record

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:38.360
 of reproductive success subsequently.

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.520
 Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.040
 is a feature or a bug?

1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:49.040
 Our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?

1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:51.800
 So what's a bug?

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:56.600
 Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,

1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:02.680
 meaning like it would be more beneficial.

1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:07.760
 Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes

1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.200
 from an evolutionary perspective?

1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.000
 Yeah, yeah, but, but, but.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.080
 What does it mean?

1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:13.200
 What does a bug mean?

1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:14.400
 Yes, right.

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:15.240
 I mean.

1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:17.520
 Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.120
 It's beneficial from, you know,

1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:20.880
 it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved

1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:25.440
 by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.

1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:28.800
 But if by bug you mean something that,

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:30.240
 from the point of view of the species,

1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:32.560
 it would be great if you could just wipe this out

1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:36.040
 because the species would somehow do better as a result.

1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.400
 Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.

1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:46.160
 Come on now, there's some nice things to males,

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:48.120
 speaking as a male.

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.160
 The fact that there are some nice things to males

1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:51.960
 doesn't mean that they're not bugs.

1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.880
 You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,

1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:56.400
 but it would be much better for the species as a whole

1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.400
 not to have to have males who impose this violence

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.840
 on the species as a whole.

1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:03.080
 Yeah.

1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.160
 As somebody who practiced controlled violence

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:10.000
 and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.720
 It does seem kind of fun to have this kind

1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:15.280
 of controlled violence, also sports.

1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:18.440
 Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,

1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:20.560
 I guess that's the deeper question.

1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:24.200
 Don't you think there's some value to conflict

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.720
 for the improvement of society, for progress?

1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:31.080
 That this tension between tribes,

1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:35.240
 isn't this like a experiment,

1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:37.680
 a continued experiment we conduct with each other

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:40.200
 to figure out what is a better world to build?

1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:44.960
 Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas

1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:47.480
 to go to war with each other.

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.600
 It's like the United States with the 50 states

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:53.620
 and it's the laboratory of ideas.

1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:57.180
 Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?

1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:02.960
 This kind of conflict, when it doesn't get out of hand,

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:05.000
 is actually ultimately progressive,

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.720
 productive for a better world.

1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:10.080
 Well, what do you mean by conflict?

1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:12.880
 I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of

1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:16.520
 people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.

1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.920
 And so their ideas are in conflict.

1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:23.480
 They can sit down on a log and chat about it

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:25.640
 and then decide, okay, you're right,

1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:27.100
 or I'm wrong or whatever.

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.080
 But if by conflict, you mean a great idea

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:35.520
 to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,

1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:39.600
 then no, I don't see why it's a good idea

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:40.960
 to have all this violence.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:45.960
 Yeah, there's, I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,

1:13:49.900 --> 1:13:52.260
 but I wonder if human history would evolve

1:13:52.260 --> 1:13:54.240
 the way it did without the violence.

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.740
 Oh, I'm sure you're right.

1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:58.620
 Probably humans would not have evolved

1:13:58.620 --> 1:14:00.700
 in the sense that we have.

1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:05.700
 But I would hope that the course of violence in evolution

1:14:05.700 --> 1:14:08.440
 will continue in the way it has.

1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:11.760
 So, there's all sorts of indications

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:16.760
 that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.

1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:22.960
 And this is made famous in Steven Pinker's book,

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.760
 but others have written about it too,

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.520
 that the frequency of death from violence

1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.840
 in every country you look at,

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:36.160
 has been declining, that's just great.

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:38.040
 And so, you know, the amazing thing about this

1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:40.280
 is that even when you take the deaths

1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:42.960
 due to the First World War and the Second World War,

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:47.200
 the 20th century appears to have been statistically,

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:49.960
 meaning rates of death per individual,

1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:54.160
 the least violent in history.

1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:59.440
 So, we haven't got very far down the course

1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:02.680
 to nonviolence, but we've got a long way to go.

1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.720
 But I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.

1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:10.640
 I think it's ridiculous, frankly, excuse my frankness,

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:13.120
 to say that violence is a good thing.

1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:16.820
 I think that it would be a wonderful concept

1:15:16.820 --> 1:15:19.720
 if we could evolve somehow to a world

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:22.040
 3,000 years from now,

1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:26.780
 where violence is really regarded as simply appalling,

1:15:26.780 --> 1:15:29.920
 and that they look back on our time

1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:32.520
 and can't believe what we were doing.

1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:33.960
 Yeah, but of course,

1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:35.760
 violence takes a lot of different shapes.

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:37.320
 As we start to think deeper and deeper

1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:40.280
 about living beings on Earth,

1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:41.920
 for example, the violence we commit

1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:43.960
 and the torture we commit to animals,

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.240
 and then perhaps down the line,

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:48.480
 as we talked offline about with robots,

1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:49.360
 and that kind of thing.

1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:52.640
 So there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.

1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:54.480
 And some people now talk about violence

1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:58.000
 in the space of ideas, which of course, to me at least,

1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.280
 is a bit of a silly notion relative

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:04.020
 to use that same V word for the space of ideas

1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:06.420
 versus actual physical violence.

1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:08.920
 But it may be that a long time from now,

1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:12.600
 we see that even violence in the space of ideas

1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:16.680
 is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.

1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:19.480
 And so it is interesting where this is headed.

1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:23.000
 And I think you're absolutely right.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.580
 A world, a nonviolent world, does seem like a better world.

1:16:27.580 --> 1:16:30.640
 I wonder if the constraints on resources

1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:34.360
 somehow make that world more and more difficult,

1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:36.120
 especially as we run out of resources.

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.460
 Well, it's got to be very, very different

1:16:37.460 --> 1:16:38.920
 from what we're doing nowadays.

1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:40.880
 And it's unimaginably different.

1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:41.800
 If we could imagine it,

1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:43.200
 then maybe we could work towards it.

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:45.480
 At the moment, nobody knows how to work towards it.

1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:46.960
 Well, that's kind of the stories of humans

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.640
 is we don't really know the future.

1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.200
 We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go

1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:55.440
 and sometimes get into trouble.

1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:57.040
 That's the violence.

1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:59.800
 But George Orwell's vision in 1984

1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:04.760
 was of two or three world powers each so powerful

1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:09.940
 that nobody could destroy the other.

1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:16.080
 But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:20.160
 among heavily armed world powers

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:27.320
 just does not seem as though it's reasonable at all.

1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:36.160
 That is to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations in the world

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:39.440
 dominated by a few big ones,

1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:42.160
 all with arms pointing at each other.

1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:45.280
 And the notion that we could just carry on

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:49.200
 having peace talks and making sure that these arms

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:54.080
 don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration

1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:56.960
 seems incredibly optimistic.

1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:01.880
 Some kind of major change has to happen whereby,

1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:04.080
 and some people would like to see all the weapons go.

1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:05.080
 That'd be great.

1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:07.840
 I'm a member of that sort of group

1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:10.600
 that tries to see that happen.

1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.080
 It's going to be very difficult to see it happen.

1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:16.040
 Another kind of concept is the nations themselves

1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:21.840
 will dissolve and will become one government.

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:23.680
 That itself is a terrifying vision

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:28.000
 because the capacity for abuse by a single world power

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.760
 would be so problematic.

1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:32.440
 And in addition, how do you get there

1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:35.240
 without a war in the first place?

1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:40.040
 So at the moment, we have no reasonable kind of future

1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:41.960
 in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.

1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:43.600
 It's just that we haven't yet to find it.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:46.040
 And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space

1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.640
 argue that you can create decentralized societies

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:52.280
 if you take away the power from states

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:54.080
 to define the monetary system.

1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:58.680
 So they argue like if you make the monetary system

1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:01.240
 such that it's disjoint from the control

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:03.960
 of any one individual, any one government,

1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:05.720
 then that might be a way to form

1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:08.000
 sort of ad hoc decentralized societies.

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.800
 They just pop up all over the place.

1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:13.880
 That's a really interesting technological solution

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.960
 to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.

1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:19.040
 Yes, right.

1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:20.000
 Absolutely.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.520
 And it may well be that the future will emerge

1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:28.640
 out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.

1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:31.160
 Is it nevertheless surprising to you

1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:34.240
 that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.480
 So the mutually assured destruction

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.440
 that we've had for many decades

1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:40.760
 from somebody who studies violence,

1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.240
 how does that make sense to you?

1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:45.440
 Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:50.440
 that accidental, the fact that we have not had an accident

1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:54.280
 yet has been quite remarkable.

1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:56.040
 Yeah, because all the accounts are

1:19:56.040 --> 1:19:59.280
 that we've come very close to having very serious accidents

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:03.120
 where people on either side have misread intentions

1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:05.280
 or apparent launches and so on.

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:08.200
 So yes, I think it is remarkable.

1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:13.200
 There is a nasty generalization that can be made

1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:19.080
 that the longer that powerful states go without having wars

1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:23.360
 than the worst the war is afterwards.

1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:28.400
 And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense

1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:32.000
 because basically what's happening with these tribal groups

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.680
 that the nations are at the moment

1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:38.120
 is that after a big war like the Second World War,

1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.160
 they establish new kinds of dominance relationships.

1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:45.000
 And then during the periods of peace,

1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:50.000
 what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:53.920
 change because some nations become poorer,

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:55.320
 some become richer,

1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:57.840
 some become more militarily powerful and so on.

1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:01.600
 Generally, economy and military goes hand in hand.

1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:05.480
 So right now, China emerged from the war

1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:09.520
 as a relatively low status state and is now high status.

1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:11.600
 So if this were chimpanzees, what would happen

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.120
 is that you would predict a conflict

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:16.120
 because you need to have a readjustment

1:21:16.120 --> 1:21:18.240
 of the formal dominance relationships

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:22.280
 to recognize the new in practice dominance relationships

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:24.760
 recognized by the economy and the military.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:29.240
 So the longer that you have of a period of peace

1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:32.360
 following a war, then the more these tensions

1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:37.200
 of unresolved changed dominance relationships build up.

1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:39.560
 And the longer they take to occur,

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:44.560
 then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.440
 That's a terrifying view

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.520
 because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.

1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:52.720
 That's right. Maybe it's building up.

1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:53.560
 So it's a scary view.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:56.640
 But on the other hand, things have changed hugely

1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:59.720
 with the advent of nuclear weapons

1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:04.720
 because at least that conforms to this psychology

1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:06.720
 that is very clear in other animals,

1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:08.840
 which is you don't want to get into a fight

1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:11.080
 if you are going to get hurt.

1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.480
 So that's the whole principle of MAD,

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:15.680
 Mutual Assured Destruction.

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:18.640
 And it's doubtless been why powerful nations

1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:23.640
 like America and Russia have not used their nuclear weapons

1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.520
 since 1945.

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:30.520
 So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:36.160
 then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology

1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:40.200
 in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions

1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:41.440
 without using them.

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:46.440
 But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.

1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:48.560
 I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed

1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:50.960
 because of the poor economy,

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.960
 but with China desperate to take back Taiwan

1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:02.360
 and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,

1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:04.960
 the potential for something going wrong

1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:06.200
 is clearly very high.

1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:10.400
 So what's the hopeful case that you can make

1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:14.840
 for a long term surviving and thriving human civilization

1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:17.080
 given all the dangers that we face?

1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:19.520
 Well, I can't really exactly make one.

1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:20.840
 I would just say that,

1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:24.840
 we're talking about the dangers,

1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:27.040
 obviously the dangers are there.

1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:29.560
 But what I would sort of think about

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:34.560
 is the notion that surprises come from all sorts

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.520
 of different directions.

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.280
 And I mean, you work in robotics

1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:46.280
 and I can well imagine that you have a lot of experience

1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:50.280
 and imagine that there will be advances in robotics

1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:52.880
 that in some way I can't even conceive

1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:57.880
 will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.

1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:01.720
 Something about by the time chips have been planted

1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:05.560
 in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information

1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:08.400
 in a way that we never did before,

1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:12.040
 will this change the nature of human existence

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:15.120
 in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?

1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.760
 So remove the conflicts, but keep some of the magic,

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:19.600
 the beauty of what it means to be human.

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.760
 So like still be able to enjoy life, the richness of life,

1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:24.680
 the full complexity of life.

1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.320
 Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill

1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:30.440
 and then they go to sleep, right?

1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.440
 You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.

1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:39.900
 And so that's where you have to find the balance.

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:42.960
 Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff.

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:47.740
 And so how it's gonna work out, totally unclear.

1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:55.040
 I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.

1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:57.880
 I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.040
 I think you really need to get rid of males

1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:05.040
 cause males are the source of a major problem,

1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:10.640
 which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.360
 But you don't think the males are also source of beauty

1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:15.200
 and creation?

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:18.120
 No, I mean, I don't have anything against males

1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:20.400
 as individuals and that sort of thing.

1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:22.820
 And males have clearly done a lot.

1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:27.040
 I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.920
 and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful

1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:32.120
 and that sort of thing.

1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:33.020
 On the other hand,

1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:36.160
 I'm not sure there's anything particularly special.

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.160
 And I think that probably females could do the same thing

1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:40.920
 just as well when given the chance.

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:44.320
 Yes, including the dark stuff.

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:47.980
 I mean, a partial part of me is not understanding the,

1:25:47.980 --> 1:25:52.620
 so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.720
 but I tend to believe both men and women,

1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:58.640
 if you look out into the future, can be destructive,

1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:02.000
 can be evil, can be greedy, can be corrupted by power.

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.640
 So if you move males from the picture,

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.160
 which are historically connected to this evolution

1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:09.760
 that we've been talking about, that women are gonna fill

1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:11.920
 that role quite nicely.

1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:15.080
 And then it'll be just the same kind of process.

1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:20.080
 Not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.

1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:25.400
 There's a sense that the will to power, craving power,

1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:28.200
 committing violence is somehow coupled

1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:32.560
 with all of the things that are beautiful about life.

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.080
 That if you remove conflict completely,

1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:37.720
 if you remove all of the evil in the world,

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:43.720
 it seems like you're going to,

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:47.540
 you're not going to have a stable place

1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:49.440
 for the beauty, for the goodness.

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.440
 Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight for the way.

1:26:54.940 --> 1:26:57.440
 If you look at human history, now you can say,

1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:00.360
 the reason I'm nervous about a sort of utopia

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.620
 where everything is great is every time you look

1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:06.720
 through human history when utopia has been chased,

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:09.840
 you run into a lot of trouble or again,

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.680
 sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:16.640
 Now you could say that's a male problem,

1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:18.920
 but I just think it's a human problem.

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:22.120
 And it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too.

1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:23.680
 It's life on earth problem,

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:25.560
 intelligent life on earth problem.

1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:30.560
 So like it's better to not necessarily get rid

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.560
 of the sources of the darker sides of human nature,

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:38.080
 but more create mechanisms that the kindness,

1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.760
 the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,

1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:46.760
 that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.

1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:54.240
 Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia

1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:56.440
 if you got rid of the males.

1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:57.280
 Right.

1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:00.520
 And certainly females are capable of conflict.

1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:03.260
 I just think it's a gamble worth taking

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:04.880
 if you could actually do it.

1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:07.120
 You can certainly find females in history

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.280
 who've done unpleasant things, but nevertheless,

1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:13.480
 we have a very strong evolutionary theory

1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:16.980
 which explains why males benefit more

1:28:16.980 --> 1:28:21.540
 by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.

1:28:21.540 --> 1:28:26.540
 And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,

1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:31.920
 then it would reduce it to get rid of males.

1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:34.100
 Now I understand this is a fantasy,

1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:37.100
 and I think it's a fantasy that people would be able

1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:40.540
 to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology

1:28:40.540 --> 1:28:44.300
 is getting to the point where it's quite likely

1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:49.220
 that human females could breed without the use of males.

1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:50.540
 Mm hmm.

1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:55.540
 And so there would be a sort of a potential dynamic

1:28:55.660 --> 1:29:00.660
 if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.

1:29:01.780 --> 1:29:03.740
 It's a really interesting thought experiment.

1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:07.380
 I will agree with you that if given two buttons,

1:29:07.380 --> 1:29:09.620
 one is get rid of all women,

1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:11.780
 and the other button is get rid of all men,

1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:18.960
 realizing that I have a stake in this choice,

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:20.800
 you're probably getting rid of all men

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:25.680
 if I wanted to preserve earth

1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:28.460
 and the richness of life on earth,

1:29:28.460 --> 1:29:30.300
 I would probably get rid of all men.

1:29:30.300 --> 1:29:31.140
 I don't know.

1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:32.360
 I don't think you have a stake in it.

1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:35.320
 You know, I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.

1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:36.160
 Yeah.

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:39.560
 But I don't see why being a man should make you

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:42.640
 any more interested in having a male future for the world

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:43.640
 than a female future.

1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:46.020
 You know, you've got just as many ancestors

1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.400
 who were male as were female.

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.340
 Well, my problem is I'll have to die.

1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:53.760
 Well, that's gonna happen anyway.

1:29:53.760 --> 1:29:56.920
 I know, but like, I prefer to die tomorrow, not today.

1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:00.520
 You know, I prefer to hit the snooze button

1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:03.720
 on the whole mortality thing, but it's interesting.

1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:05.560
 But this is not suggesting that males have to die

1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:06.800
 in order to make room for females.

1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:11.480
 It's just, you know, all you have to do is just say,

1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:13.920
 don't let's have any more males born.

1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:14.760
 Interesting.

1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:16.600
 Of course, you know, the difficulty is that

1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:19.840
 because we're tribal, you know, some country somewhere

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:21.360
 would say, well, we're not gonna do that.

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:22.180
 Yeah.

1:30:22.180 --> 1:30:23.020
 And then guess what?

1:30:23.020 --> 1:30:24.760
 They'd take over, you know, because they're male.

1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:27.760
 So that's why it's impossible to imagine actually happening.

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:31.040
 You know what, I'm gonna take that

1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:32.200
 and actually think about it.

1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:34.900
 I don't know, I'm uncomfortable.

1:30:34.900 --> 1:30:39.280
 There's a certain kind of woke culture

1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:41.600
 that I've been kind of uncomfortable with

1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:44.520
 because it's not women necessarily.

1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:47.880
 It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.

1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:50.880
 There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.440
 towards others that's created by that culture.

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.200
 So, but you're speaking about something else.

1:30:55.200 --> 1:31:00.200
 You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world

1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:04.440
 and looking at the basics of our human nature

1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:09.440
 and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens

1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:14.480
 and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature

1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:18.200
 if we get rid of them will make for a better world.

1:31:18.200 --> 1:31:20.240
 It's an interesting thought experiment worth thinking about.

1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:21.680
 But it is only a thought experiment.

1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:24.840
 I mean, you know, it's got no practical meaning right now.

1:31:24.840 --> 1:31:28.320
 And I take your point that, you know,

1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:32.480
 males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:37.480
 because the balance of social power

1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:42.580
 is moving against,

1:31:42.580 --> 1:31:45.580
 I mean, you know, quite rightly

1:31:45.580 --> 1:31:47.140
 and in a strong sense, of course,

1:31:47.140 --> 1:31:50.060
 against all the nasty things that males do.

1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:55.740
 But what people sometimes fail to remember

1:31:55.740 --> 1:32:00.660
 is that life is very hard for males

1:32:00.660 --> 1:32:03.660
 who don't have the power,

1:32:03.660 --> 1:32:06.300
 who don't have money,

1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:08.920
 who don't have access to women.

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:13.680
 And, you know, I'm sympathetic to incels.

1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:18.400
 I'm not sympathetic to them using violence

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.200
 to solve their problems.

1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:23.240
 But I am very sympathetic to the fact that

1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:27.200
 it's not easy simply to be told by

1:32:29.700 --> 1:32:34.700
 well off, feminist, middle class people

1:32:36.500 --> 1:32:38.080
 that you shouldn't behave like this

1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:40.360
 or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.

1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:42.400
 Yes, it's who you are.

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:45.960
 I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,

1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:48.680
 male or female,

1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:54.400
 I believe will be the thing that builds a better world.

1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:57.360
 And that's practiced in different ways

1:32:57.360 --> 1:32:58.680
 from different backgrounds.

1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:01.600
 But ultimately, you should listen to others

1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:04.120
 and empathize with the experience of others

1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:06.480
 and put more love out there in the world.

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:09.380
 Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,

1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:12.320
 reduce violence,

1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:17.320
 and reduce that whole psychological experience

1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:19.800
 of being powerless in this world,

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:22.520
 powerless to become the best version of yourself.

1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:23.360
 And that, you know.

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:24.440
 Well, no one's gonna disagree

1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:27.160
 with all those fine sentiments, right?

1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:29.680
 But that, yes.

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:32.000
 But that's an actionable thing

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.120
 is actually practice empathy, right?

1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:40.080
 Like saying that somebody should be silenced

1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:43.780
 or just like this group is bad and this group is good.

1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:45.360
 I just feel like that's not empathy.

1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:50.360
 Empathy is understanding the experience of others

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.960
 and like respecting it.

1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.240
 Like, I mean, that's what a better world looks like.

1:33:57.240 --> 1:33:59.720
 That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.

1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:03.680
 It's like, as opposed to saying my tribe is right,

1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:05.220
 your tribe is wrong.

1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:08.720
 Forget the violence and nonviolence part.

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:11.160
 That's just that act of saying my tribe is right,

1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:12.220
 that tribe is wrong.

1:34:12.220 --> 1:34:13.600
 Removing that from the picture,

1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:15.720
 that's the way to make a better world.

1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:18.320
 Like that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.

1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:21.720
 Not necessarily removing the people

1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:24.160
 who are causing the violence.

1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:25.960
 You have to get to the source of the problem.

1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:27.240
 I don't mean the evolutionary source,

1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:32.240
 but just the mindset that creates the violence

1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:35.960
 is usually just the lack of empathy for others.

1:34:37.800 --> 1:34:40.480
 Yeah, but you know, I mean, you can't just teach that

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:43.560
 because our evolutionary psychology

1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:45.520
 puts us in particular directions.

1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:48.640
 So you don't think, do you think it's possible

1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:53.640
 to learn through practice to resist the basics

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.920
 of our evolutionary psychology, the basic forces?

1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:01.880
 Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training.

1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:04.920
 Lots and lots of education can do it.

1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:09.200
 The famously most peaceful society

1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:11.840
 that anthropologists have recorded

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.840
 involves tremendous amount of teaching,

1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:18.880
 including some punishment.

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.920
 You know, it's a society in Thailand.

1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.920
 You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.

1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:27.760
 There's carrot and steak.

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:31.280
 You know, the point is that you do not find societies

1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:34.360
 in which people are spontaneously

1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.200
 showing the kinds of behaviors

1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:42.040
 that we would all love them to show.

1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:43.320
 It requires work.

1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:45.160
 It requires work.

1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:48.000
 What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?

1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.360
 What are the main ideas in this book?

1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:55.360
 Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes

1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:00.480
 in relationship to both violence and nonviolence.

1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:04.240
 And the violence is that we are one of these few animals

1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.920
 in which we use coalitionary proactive violence

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:10.720
 to kill members of our own species.

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.240
 And we do it in large numbers,

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:14.760
 just like a few other species.

1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:18.960
 And the nonviolence is we're particularly extreme

1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:23.920
 in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:26.960
 And I told you the story of how we get there.

1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:29.120
 So what's so extraordinary about it is that

1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:32.960
 most animals are either high on both

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:35.440
 or relatively low on both.

1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:38.360
 So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence

1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.040
 and reactive violence.

1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:44.240
 Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:46.360
 but still hundreds of times more

1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:49.920
 reactively aggressive than humans are.

1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:54.960
 What we've done is retain proactive violence being high

1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:59.240
 and got reactive violence really being low.

1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:01.200
 And so we have these wonderful societies

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:03.800
 in which we're all so incredibly nice to each other

1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:07.080
 and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:08.880
 and have no problem about

1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:14.760
 leading to any kind of conflict

1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:18.240
 at the same time as we are one of the worst

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:21.840
 killing machine species that's ever existed.

1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:24.240
 So what's so extraordinary about this is that

1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:26.880
 if you look at the political philosophers

1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:28.920
 of the last few hundred years,

1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:33.880
 you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.240
 and Jean Jacques Rousseau,

1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:38.400
 or literally you've got the fight between their followers.

1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:40.720
 So the followers of Hobbes say,

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:41.960
 well, Hobbes was right,

1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:44.200
 because he says that we are naturally violent

1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:46.360
 and you need a Leviathan,

1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.280
 a sort of central government or a king

1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.640
 to be able to suppress the violence.

1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:53.560
 So we're naturally horrid

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.800
 and we can learn to be good.

1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.200
 Whereas Jean Jacques Rousseau is interpreted

1:37:58.200 --> 1:37:59.760
 as saying the opposite,

1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:01.320
 that we are naturally good

1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:03.360
 and it's only when culture intervenes

1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:05.960
 and horrid ideologies come in

1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:08.280
 that we become uncivilized.

1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:10.840
 And so people have had this endless fight

1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:13.680
 between are we naturally corrupt

1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:17.280
 or are we naturally kind?

1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:19.640
 And that has gone on for years

1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:22.960
 and it's only in the last two or three decades

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:25.160
 that anthropologists like Christopher Boehm

1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:26.520
 and Bruce Naft have said,

1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:28.600
 look, it's obvious what the answer is,

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:30.320
 we are both of these things.

1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:32.120
 And what is so exciting now

1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:34.840
 is I think we can understand why we are both.

1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:38.160
 And the answer is we come from ancestors

1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:40.680
 that were elevated on proactive aggression,

1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:43.680
 that were hunters and killers,

1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:46.480
 both of animals and of each other.

1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:49.080
 And you've got to include that

1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:52.840
 as almost certain from the past.

1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:57.840
 And then now we've taken our reactive aggression

1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:00.480
 and we've down regulated it

1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:02.480
 and that's given us power.

1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:04.520
 It's given us power because

1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:06.640
 once you get rid of the alpha male,

1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.520
 once the beta males take over

1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:13.320
 and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,

1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:17.040
 less reactively aggressive individual,

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:21.960
 the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable

1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:24.880
 of focusing on things other than conflict.

1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:27.680
 And so we have social groups

1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:30.920
 in which individuals, instead of constantly being on edge

1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:33.280
 in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,

1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:39.440
 are able to interact in ways that enable them to share

1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:44.000
 looking at a tool together or share their food together

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.200
 or pass ideas from one to the other

1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:49.520
 or support each other when they're ill

1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:51.600
 or whatever the issue is.

1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:56.080
 Cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.

1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:58.360
 So you asked earlier, what did I think about

1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:01.640
 why sapiens were able to expand

1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:04.200
 at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically

1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.640
 around 40,000 years ago?

1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.240
 And the answer is that whatever it was,

1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:12.680
 it had something to do

1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:16.040
 with the sapiens ability to cooperate.

1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:18.200
 That was what gave them bigger groups.

1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:21.640
 That's what enabled them to have

1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:23.800
 a far more effective way of living.

1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:26.160
 And I suspect it was to do with the weapons

1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.200
 and military aspects.

1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:30.200
 But even if it wasn't that,

1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.080
 the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing

1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:36.840
 would have been hugely important.

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.280
 So sapiens then had groups of,

1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.040
 who knows exactly how big they were,

1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:48.360
 but scores of people to judge from their remains.

1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:52.800
 Whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated,

1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:57.800
 small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,

1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:00.760
 where they saw others so rarely

1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:03.880
 that they were inbreeding at high levels.

1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:07.160
 Fathers having babies with their daughters.

1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:09.720
 Very different world.

1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:10.680
 Very different world.

1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.280
 And that's probably what our world was like

1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:13.640
 before we got sapiens.

1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:14.920
 Before we got sapiens.

1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:18.320
 And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence

1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:23.320
 against, once you get rid of the alpha males,

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:29.400
 you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta.

1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:31.360
 The beta males.

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:34.480
 Not kindness, but collaboration, that's the better word.

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:36.520
 Yes, right, much more corruption.

1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.920
 Not just among the males, among the beta males,

1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:42.760
 but also among the gamma males and the females.

1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:44.880
 Yeah, I don't know what a gamma male is,

1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:47.560
 but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:48.760
 Well, I don't know about a whole alphabet,

1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.400
 but I think the big layers are the married men

1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:55.040
 and the unmarried men.

1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:57.280
 Because the married men had a problem

1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:59.200
 with the unmarried men, right?

1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:01.200
 I mean, you see it in ethnographies

1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:03.240
 of hunters and gatherers recently,

1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:06.360
 where the unmarried men would be given rules,

1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:09.720
 such as, I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia

1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:13.680
 was you cannot come to the camp for months.

1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:17.280
 You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush.

1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:20.000
 Because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.960
 And then another kind of rule is,

1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:25.000
 if you are in the camp,

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.680
 you must be in the firelight all the time.

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.720
 Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.

1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:33.880
 You really have to control them

1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:36.920
 because the men who had lots of wives

1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:38.640
 did not want those horrid bachelors

1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:40.280
 sneaking around the place.

1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:41.120
 I love this.

1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:45.000
 You also wrote the book titled Catching Fire,

1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:46.520
 How Cooking Made Us Human.

1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.800
 What's the central idea in this book?

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:52.480
 The subtitle How Cooking Made Us Human

1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:56.320
 refers not to Homo sapiens, but to Homo erectus.

1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:59.040
 So human there means the genus Homo.

1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:03.720
 And Homo erectus is the first full member

1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:08.720
 of the genus Homo in the sense that it looked like us,

1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:12.160
 just with a sort of slightly more robust build

1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:14.120
 and a smaller brain.

1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:17.360
 And the central idea of Catching Fire

1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:22.040
 is that it was the control of fire

1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:27.040
 that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus

1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:30.760
 and therefore the genus Homo,

1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:33.000
 which happened two million years ago.

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:38.000
 And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.

1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:46.360
 And Australopithecines are the creatures

1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:49.360
 from whom we evolved.

1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:52.840
 They were present in Africa

1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:57.080
 from something like six or seven million years ago,

1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:00.720
 up to actually up to one million years ago.

1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:04.080
 And then a branch led off to Homo

1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:05.720
 around two million years ago.

1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:09.400
 And the way to think of Australopithecines

1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:13.360
 is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:16.360
 So they were erect bipedal walkers.

1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:20.400
 They were like chimpanzees in the sense

1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:24.600
 that they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.

1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:27.360
 They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:29.760
 a little bit smaller actually.

1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:32.320
 And they had big jaws

1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:36.640
 because they were still eating raw food.

1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:39.400
 They had big teeth and big jaws.

1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:41.600
 And then around two million years ago,

1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:44.080
 the line of Australopithecines,

1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.920
 which ended with an intermediate species,

1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.240
 a kind of missing link area,

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:52.840
 because it is not missing, called habilis,

1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:54.360
 sometimes called Homo habilis,

1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:55.920
 but more properly, in my view,

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:57.720
 called Australopithecus habilis.

1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:00.840
 That gave rise to Homo erectus.

1:45:00.840 --> 1:45:04.480
 And Homo erectus, here's how different it was.

1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.240
 It had a smaller mouth,

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:11.600
 a smaller jaw, smaller teeth,

1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:16.120
 and to judge from its ribs and pelvis, smaller gut.

1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:21.800
 In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had,

1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:24.800
 which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:26.920
 And that meant that Homo erectus must have slept

1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:27.760
 on the ground.

1:45:28.920 --> 1:45:31.320
 And since it slept on the ground,

1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:33.400
 it should have been able to defend itself somehow

1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:34.720
 against predators.

1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:36.840
 And I can't think of any way they could have done that

1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:38.040
 unless they had fire.

1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:45.040
 So there are two major clues to why it was

1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:49.160
 with Homo erectus that our ancestors

1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:52.280
 first acquired the control of fire.

1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:55.720
 One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees

1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:58.720
 in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos

1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:01.000
 and all the other primates do.

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:07.400
 And the other is that there was this striking reduction

1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:10.160
 throughout the gut,

1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:14.440
 reduction in size of the mouth and the chewing apparatus

1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:16.400
 and in the gut itself.

1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:20.320
 And that conforms to what we have today,

1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:24.880
 that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,

1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:28.640
 which is that our guts are about two thirds of the size

1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:32.040
 of what they would be if we ate raw food

1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:34.480
 to judge by the great apes.

1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:38.600
 So at some point in our evolution,

1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:43.160
 we acquired the skill of cooking

1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:44.880
 and skill of controlling fire.

1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:49.560
 At no time between two million years ago and the present,

1:46:49.560 --> 1:46:52.840
 do we see any changes in our anatomy

1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:57.840
 that can, as it were, justify the enormous change

1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:01.280
 that happens when you are an animal

1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:03.200
 that learns to control fire.

1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:04.360
 But at two million years ago,

1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.280
 we have exactly what you'd expect,

1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.880
 namely the guts becoming smaller

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:11.000
 because the food is becoming softer

1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:12.680
 and much more easy to digest

1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:14.720
 so you don't have to work so hard in the kitchen

1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:17.560
 or so hard in your body to digest it.

1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:21.640
 And as I say, a commitment to sleeping on the ground,

1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.000
 which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays

1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:30.200
 on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti

1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:31.680
 unless you had fire.

1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:34.840
 I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:38.320
 in the bush and you will not catch me

1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:42.880
 just lying on the ground in an area with lots of predators

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.320
 unless I got a fire with me.

1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:46.160
 I'm going to get eaten.

1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:49.120
 You're gonna get terrified and you're gonna get eaten.

1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:51.960
 Okay, so there's a million questions I wanna ask.

1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:55.840
 So one, is it very naturally coupled,

1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:59.500
 the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?

1:47:59.500 --> 1:48:01.440
 Is that an obvious leap?

1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.280
 Well, here's what we know.

1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:06.800
 We know that all the animals that we've tested

1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:10.640
 like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:13.120
 So this is true for all the great apes.

1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:14.260
 We've tested them.

1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:17.320
 That's fascinating, by the way.

1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:18.440
 Why is that?

1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.000
 That's just like a property of food, I suppose.

1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:25.880
 Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking

1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:30.880
 for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest.

1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:33.760
 And there are various signals in the food

1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:35.760
 such as the amount of sugar there,

1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:37.920
 the amount of free amino acids

1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:40.740
 because the amino acids can be tasted.

1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:44.660
 And the physical qualities of the food

1:48:44.660 --> 1:48:47.460
 be particularly important, how tough the food is.

1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:52.140
 Always prefer softer food, provided it feels safe,

1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:53.860
 tastes safe.

1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:57.780
 And these kinds of sensory cues

1:48:57.780 --> 1:49:01.140
 are all there in cooked food.

1:49:01.140 --> 1:49:04.900
 It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins.

1:49:04.900 --> 1:49:08.480
 It's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.

1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:11.940
 So everyone loves it spontaneously.

1:49:11.940 --> 1:49:14.500
 Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food to raw food.

1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:16.580
 Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence

1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:19.020
 of domestication, but even, as I say,

1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:23.060
 all of the great apes, you test naive ones

1:49:23.060 --> 1:49:25.300
 and they prefer it cooked if they can.

1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:28.020
 So then obvious, once you have fire,

1:49:28.020 --> 1:49:29.620
 you're going to accidentally discover

1:49:29.620 --> 1:49:32.540
 that food changes when you apply fire to it

1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:37.260
 and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad.

1:49:37.260 --> 1:49:38.980
 You took the words out of my mouth.

1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:41.180
 I mean, if they have fire at all

1:49:41.180 --> 1:49:43.580
 and their food rolls into it,

1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:46.860
 five minutes later it tastes better than it did before.

1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:50.380
 How big of an invention from an engineering perspective

1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:53.060
 do you think is the discovery of fire?

1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:58.060
 Do you think for homo erectus, homo sapiens,

1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:02.700
 do you think it's the greatest invention ever?

1:50:02.700 --> 1:50:07.700
 Yeah, I think that the control of fire

1:50:09.820 --> 1:50:14.300
 has been ultimately responsible for essentially

1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:17.900
 how grandiose do I want to be here,

1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:21.820
 the entire human story, going back to homo.

1:50:21.820 --> 1:50:26.320
 It is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.

1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.400
 And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely

1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:35.140
 to have changed us is it reduced the difficulty

1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:36.820
 of making a large brain.

1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:43.180
 So the story here is that the constraints

1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:46.040
 on brain size are energetic.

1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:51.500
 You and I have brains that are something

1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:55.860
 like 2.5% of our body weight.

1:50:55.860 --> 1:51:00.860
 It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.

1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:05.500
 So it's disproportionate.

1:51:05.500 --> 1:51:08.620
 There are other expensive organs in our body as well,

1:51:08.620 --> 1:51:09.760
 such as the heart.

1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:16.580
 And what's different about the brain is that in addition

1:51:16.700 --> 1:51:19.100
 to us being able to fuel it in a way

1:51:19.100 --> 1:51:22.820
 that other animals can't, we also have reasons

1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:24.980
 for wanting to have an even bigger brain,

1:51:24.980 --> 1:51:27.020
 whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.

1:51:29.020 --> 1:51:31.020
 So what those reasons are is unclear.

1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:36.020
 But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,

1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:38.580
 cooking makes it possible

1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:42.600
 because it's supplying more calories

1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:46.020
 and it is enormously reducing the amount of time

1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:48.500
 that it takes to chew your food.

1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:51.820
 So if you were a gorilla and you wanted

1:51:51.820 --> 1:51:54.220
 to have a bigger brain, you might say, okay,

1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:55.800
 well, let's just eat some more.

1:51:56.860 --> 1:52:01.860
 But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day

1:52:02.660 --> 1:52:04.740
 in the sense that they are eating

1:52:04.740 --> 1:52:09.620
 for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.

1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:11.300
 That's just chewing.

1:52:11.300 --> 1:52:13.660
 And then they've got to sit around and digest their food

1:52:13.660 --> 1:52:15.620
 because they can't just eat all the time.

1:52:15.620 --> 1:52:20.620
 They've got to take a break while the food is digested

1:52:20.660 --> 1:52:23.780
 in the stomach and then passed into the gut.

1:52:23.780 --> 1:52:25.840
 So the stomach is already full.

1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:29.060
 So basically gorillas are eating

1:52:29.060 --> 1:52:31.220
 about the maximum rate already.

1:52:31.220 --> 1:52:33.500
 So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?

1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:36.060
 It doesn't, it's actually got a smaller brain

1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.100
 relative to its body size than a chimpanzee does.

1:52:39.100 --> 1:52:44.100
 And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.

1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:47.200
 Then you come along and cook and all of a sudden

1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:50.900
 you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.

1:52:50.900 --> 1:52:55.900
 You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.

1:52:56.260 --> 1:53:00.300
 You know, there are 25 bodily processes or more

1:53:00.300 --> 1:53:03.220
 that are involved in digesting your food,

1:53:03.220 --> 1:53:06.940
 making the acid that takes the proteins apart,

1:53:07.980 --> 1:53:12.020
 maintaining the brush border where the molecules

1:53:12.020 --> 1:53:14.140
 are taken across the gut wall and so on.

1:53:15.020 --> 1:53:16.300
 That all costs.

1:53:16.300 --> 1:53:17.900
 It costs you to digest your food.

1:53:17.900 --> 1:53:19.580
 It costs less if you cook your food.

1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:22.780
 So you get a net gain in the amount of energy

1:53:22.780 --> 1:53:25.700
 and you are reducing the amount of time

1:53:25.700 --> 1:53:29.100
 from in our case, our ancestors,

1:53:29.100 --> 1:53:32.940
 probably around 50% of the day chewing

1:53:32.940 --> 1:53:36.460
 to nowadays one hour a day chewing.

1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:38.260
 So all of a sudden you've got hours a day

1:53:38.260 --> 1:53:41.660
 in which to do other things and to use those brains

1:53:41.660 --> 1:53:44.220
 that you've now enabled to grow.

1:53:44.220 --> 1:53:46.980
 So with Homo erectus, you start the process

1:53:46.980 --> 1:53:49.260
 of getting a bigger brain and famously,

1:53:49.260 --> 1:53:51.180
 throughout the whole period of the evolution

1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:54.460
 of the genus Homo, you have a steadily increasing

1:53:54.460 --> 1:53:59.220
 size of brain until right at the end

1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:02.340
 when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story.

1:54:02.340 --> 1:54:03.940
 Which end is this?

1:54:03.940 --> 1:54:06.140
 Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?

1:54:06.140 --> 1:54:09.620
 Yeah, with Homo sapiens, you've got a smaller brain

1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:13.100
 from, people haven't got it exactly down,

1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:17.140
 but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining.

1:54:17.140 --> 1:54:20.300
 And so the fascinating thing about that

1:54:20.300 --> 1:54:23.300
 is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains

1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:25.340
 than their wild ancestors.

1:54:25.340 --> 1:54:27.140
 And I.

1:54:30.620 --> 1:54:32.700
 The domestication is intricately connected

1:54:32.700 --> 1:54:34.140
 to this brain size, you think?

1:54:34.140 --> 1:54:37.020
 And exactly, so I think what we're seeing in humans

1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:39.700
 is that same manifestation.

1:54:39.700 --> 1:54:43.260
 And then the fascinating question is why?

1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:45.540
 And the only point I would want to make about this

1:54:45.540 --> 1:54:50.740
 is that there's no evidence that in the small brain

1:54:50.740 --> 1:54:53.100
 domesticates, they're losing say an average

1:54:53.100 --> 1:54:55.460
 about 15% of brain size.

1:54:55.460 --> 1:54:57.260
 In the small brain domesticates compared

1:54:57.260 --> 1:54:59.420
 to their wild ancestors, there's no indication

1:54:59.420 --> 1:55:02.500
 of a loss of cognitive ability.

1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:08.380
 So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain.

1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:10.540
 It's a more pedomorphic brain,

1:55:10.540 --> 1:55:13.780
 looking like the juveniles of the ancestor.

1:55:13.780 --> 1:55:17.340
 But just as our kids are very smart

1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:19.780
 and can learn amazing things compared to adults,

1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:21.700
 all they lack is wisdom and maturity,

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:25.420
 but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.

1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:27.460
 And I think that's the same with domesticated animals

1:55:27.460 --> 1:55:28.700
 compared to their wild ancestors,

1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:32.500
 and probably therefore with Homo sapiens,

1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:36.700
 say 30,000 years ago, compared to their ancestors.

1:55:36.700 --> 1:55:38.860
 So we have smaller brains than Neanderthals.

1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:43.340
 Size, Richard, isn't everything.

1:55:43.340 --> 1:55:45.180
 Exactly.

1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:47.820
 What's the connection between fire, cooking,

1:55:47.820 --> 1:55:50.460
 and the eating of meat?

1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:53.140
 Which came first, do you think?

1:55:53.140 --> 1:55:56.900
 Humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat

1:55:56.900 --> 1:56:01.420
 or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?

1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:04.340
 I think that fire increased the using of meat.

1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:09.340
 But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt

1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:14.460
 and kill meat, as do bonobos, certainly puts us in,

1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:18.580
 so those two species have a common ancestor with us

1:56:18.580 --> 1:56:20.500
 going six, seven million years ago,

1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:22.180
 and it was from that common ancestor

1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:24.100
 that you get the Australopithecine line.

1:56:24.100 --> 1:56:26.300
 It's very likely therefore Australopithecines

1:56:26.300 --> 1:56:28.260
 were eating meat when they could get it,

1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:29.300
 which wouldn't be very often

1:56:29.300 --> 1:56:31.940
 because they wouldn't be very good sprinters.

1:56:31.940 --> 1:56:33.460
 But nevertheless, they would occasionally be able

1:56:33.460 --> 1:56:36.540
 to get some meat, and I bet they loved it all the time,

1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:38.260
 and basically all primates like meat

1:56:38.260 --> 1:56:40.180
 if they can get it, almost all of them.

1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:44.700
 But I think fire would have been very important

1:56:45.580 --> 1:56:47.980
 for a couple of reasons.

1:56:47.980 --> 1:56:52.980
 One is that once you eat your food cooked,

1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:54.620
 then you're saving yourself time.

1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:58.940
 By saving yourself time, you can free up

1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:03.420
 the opportunity to go and hunt more.

1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:06.300
 Because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.

1:57:07.580 --> 1:57:10.580
 There's every risk that you will get nothing

1:57:10.580 --> 1:57:12.900
 on one particular afternoon that you go off

1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:16.460
 looking for opportunities to kill.

1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:20.020
 But it's high gain because when you do get something,

1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:21.740
 you bring down a kudu,

1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:24.300
 then you've got a serious amount of meat.

1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:28.500
 What did males and females do

1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:29.820
 with the time they were saving

1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:32.620
 from not having to chew their food?

1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:35.220
 I think that in the case of males,

1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:36.620
 it's very reasonable to think they spent

1:57:36.620 --> 1:57:39.460
 a greatly increased amount of time hunting.

1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:44.180
 So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,

1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:46.420
 and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.

1:57:47.460 --> 1:57:52.460
 With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,

1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:55.700
 and the average hunt length is six hours.

1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:57.700
 It's a huge difference.

1:57:57.700 --> 1:58:00.340
 So, and that's possible because the time was available,

1:58:00.340 --> 1:58:01.700
 because they were cooking.

1:58:01.700 --> 1:58:03.340
 Less chewing, more hunting.

1:58:03.340 --> 1:58:04.180
 You got it.

1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:10.020
 The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.

1:58:11.260 --> 1:58:14.060
 So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,

1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:17.500
 and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.

1:58:17.500 --> 1:58:19.380
 They're so excited about going into the hunt,

1:58:19.380 --> 1:58:21.940
 and when they make the kill,

1:58:21.940 --> 1:58:23.820
 then there's screams everywhere,

1:58:23.820 --> 1:58:27.380
 and some don't like to seize it and capture it

1:58:27.380 --> 1:58:28.740
 and take it away from the others,

1:58:28.740 --> 1:58:31.980
 and eventually the strongest one has it,

1:58:31.980 --> 1:58:33.980
 and the others sit around begging

1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:35.700
 and trying to get some and tear it off,

1:58:35.700 --> 1:58:37.540
 and so they all love it.

1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:41.420
 There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree

1:58:41.420 --> 1:58:42.500
 in order to be able to get away

1:58:42.500 --> 1:58:44.540
 from all of these beggars and scavengers,

1:58:44.540 --> 1:58:47.940
 and while he's there, drops of blood

1:58:47.940 --> 1:58:50.260
 or little scraps will fall down to the bottom,

1:58:50.260 --> 1:58:52.580
 and the junior members of society,

1:58:52.580 --> 1:58:55.300
 you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,

1:58:55.300 --> 1:58:58.660
 they are racing through to find a particular leaf

1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:00.620
 that's got a drop of blood on it so they can lick it.

1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:05.620
 I mean, they love it, but it takes them a lot of time

1:59:07.500 --> 1:59:08.340
 to chew it.

1:59:08.340 --> 1:59:11.380
 I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.

1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:16.380
 So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,

1:59:16.820 --> 1:59:19.500
 and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,

1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:21.940
 I've had enough of this, I need real food,

1:59:21.940 --> 1:59:25.820
 and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again

1:59:25.820 --> 1:59:27.900
 because they can get fruit into their bodies

1:59:27.900 --> 1:59:29.900
 so much faster than they can get meat.

1:59:32.260 --> 1:59:34.780
 So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,

1:59:34.780 --> 1:59:37.260
 and they can eat the meat much more readily.

1:59:37.260 --> 1:59:40.180
 So I think that meat eating would become important

1:59:40.180 --> 1:59:42.340
 for two reasons with cooking.

1:59:42.340 --> 1:59:45.820
 So the key, not to oversimplify,

1:59:45.820 --> 1:59:48.500
 but the key moments in human history

1:59:48.500 --> 1:59:52.740
 are with Homo erectus, the discovery of fire

1:59:52.740 --> 1:59:55.180
 and the use of fire for cooking,

1:59:55.180 --> 2:00:00.180
 and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males

2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:03.180
 killing off the alpha males so that the cooperation

2:00:03.180 --> 2:00:06.940
 can exist, and cooperation leads to communication

2:00:06.940 --> 2:00:09.380
 and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas,

2:00:09.380 --> 2:00:10.700
 that kind of thing.

2:00:10.700 --> 2:00:13.660
 Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that

2:00:13.660 --> 2:00:17.420
 is that you have to ask, how is it that the beta males

2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:20.380
 were able to kill the alpha male?

2:00:20.380 --> 2:00:21.220
 Right.

2:00:21.220 --> 2:00:25.580
 And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males

2:00:25.580 --> 2:00:27.700
 within their own group sometimes,

2:00:27.700 --> 2:00:31.180
 it's not a process of killing the alpha male.

2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:32.980
 It's taking advantage of opportunity

2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:36.180
 when some male gets into a bad position,

2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:39.300
 but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.

2:00:39.300 --> 2:00:42.780
 And you can see why, because they don't have language,

2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:46.380
 and without language, it's very difficult to know

2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:50.020
 how confident you can be of the support of others

2:00:50.020 --> 2:00:52.900
 against a particular individual within your own group.

2:00:52.900 --> 2:00:53.780
 Yes.

2:00:53.780 --> 2:00:55.540
 When you're attacking someone from another group,

2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:57.060
 that problem is solved.

2:00:57.060 --> 2:01:02.060
 We all hate those guys, but the alpha male

2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:06.580
 has got alliances within his group.

2:01:06.580 --> 2:01:10.460
 Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.

2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:13.340
 Some of them might be harboring deep feelings

2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:17.740
 of resentment, but how does anyone else know that?

2:01:17.740 --> 2:01:20.100
 So in other words, I think that you have to have

2:01:20.100 --> 2:01:23.700
 some kind of language that is pretty good

2:01:23.700 --> 2:01:27.700
 to solve the problems of gaining confidence

2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:32.620
 that five of you say, or some number,

2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:38.420
 can trust each other in this final attack.

2:01:38.420 --> 2:01:42.100
 And even nowadays, it's difficult.

2:01:42.100 --> 2:01:44.260
 I mean, you mentioned Stalin.

2:01:44.260 --> 2:01:48.460
 It's like, why was everybody terrified?

2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:50.260
 Any dictator that takes control.

2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:53.260
 Why is all of us as individuals terrified

2:01:53.260 --> 2:01:55.180
 when you know there's millions of us?

2:01:56.060 --> 2:01:57.060
 That's right.

2:01:57.060 --> 2:02:00.060
 And so like that, we lack the language,

2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:04.460
 because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.

2:02:04.460 --> 2:02:06.220
 Like, who can we talk to?

2:02:06.220 --> 2:02:08.660
 Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?

2:02:08.660 --> 2:02:10.460
 Exactly, that's right.

2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:14.180
 But do you have this intuition that some kind of language

2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:18.660
 was developing along with this process

2:02:18.660 --> 2:02:20.180
 of beta males taking over?

2:02:20.180 --> 2:02:23.740
 Yes, yes, I mean, once you have sufficient language

2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:25.820
 to be able to have the beta males conspiring

2:02:25.820 --> 2:02:30.100
 to kill the alpha male, then you have selection

2:02:30.100 --> 2:02:33.940
 in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.

2:02:33.940 --> 2:02:38.220
 And at that point, there will be increased ability

2:02:38.220 --> 2:02:40.020
 to communicate and the language will get richer

2:02:40.020 --> 2:02:41.660
 and better and better.

2:02:41.660 --> 2:02:44.380
 So yes, absolutely, positive feedback loop

2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:47.000
 once you get the situation started.

2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:53.060
 Can you maybe comment on the full complexity

2:02:53.060 --> 2:02:55.720
 and richness of the human mind through this process?

2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:00.580
 We've been casually saying cooking, fire,

2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:05.580
 and beta males leading to cooperation.

2:03:06.420 --> 2:03:09.540
 But how does the beauty of the human mind

2:03:09.540 --> 2:03:10.660
 emerge from all of this?

2:03:10.660 --> 2:03:13.060
 Is there other further steps we need to understand?

2:03:13.060 --> 2:03:16.500
 Or is it as simple as this language emerging

2:03:16.500 --> 2:03:21.260
 from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?

2:03:21.260 --> 2:03:23.840
 Or am I also over romanticizing

2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:25.780
 how amazing the human mind is?

2:03:25.780 --> 2:03:27.680
 Is it just like one small step

2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:30.260
 in a long journey of evolution?

2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:34.600
 Well, if the beauty of the human mind

2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:39.600
 is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore,

2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:49.900
 that's one kind of beauty.

2:03:49.900 --> 2:03:54.900
 Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.

2:03:56.540 --> 2:03:58.020
 And we think of that as beautiful

2:03:58.020 --> 2:04:03.020
 because it is a kind of rare and special ability

2:04:03.020 --> 2:04:08.020
 compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness

2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:12.440
 that can commonly predominate.

2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:17.260
 I suppose we have to think of different sources

2:04:17.260 --> 2:04:19.100
 for those two types.

2:04:22.140 --> 2:04:24.580
 I suppose a general answer is that

2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:29.220
 there has been selection in favor of bigger brains,

2:04:29.220 --> 2:04:31.960
 which probably in general has been associated

2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:33.900
 with increasing cognitive ability.

2:04:33.900 --> 2:04:35.860
 And as that has happened,

2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:41.140
 the complexity of life has increased

2:04:41.140 --> 2:04:45.900
 because people have more and more complex,

2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:48.460
 highly differentiated strategies

2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:51.340
 in response to each other's more complex,

2:04:51.340 --> 2:04:53.580
 highly differentiated strategies.

2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:55.820
 We get to a point where there is deception

2:04:55.820 --> 2:04:57.980
 and self deception.

2:04:57.980 --> 2:05:02.820
 There is a manipulation of ideas

2:05:02.820 --> 2:05:07.220
 through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.

2:05:09.700 --> 2:05:12.180
 I guess all I'm wanting to say is that

2:05:13.660 --> 2:05:18.660
 there is a world of the mind that evolves in response

2:05:22.660 --> 2:05:25.940
 to these platforms that are put there.

2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:28.780
 The platform of increasing brain size

2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:30.140
 and therefore cognitive ability

2:05:30.140 --> 2:05:34.140
 made possible by increased energy supply.

2:05:34.140 --> 2:05:38.980
 The platform of cooperation and tolerance

2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:42.940
 in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict

2:05:42.940 --> 2:05:46.500
 and therefore a need to respond to the conflict

2:05:46.500 --> 2:05:49.120
 and manipulate your allies appropriately.

2:05:50.380 --> 2:05:52.540
 I don't see beauty as coming,

2:05:52.540 --> 2:05:53.820
 either kind of beauty as coming

2:05:53.820 --> 2:05:56.780
 sort of totally independently of these things.

2:05:56.780 --> 2:05:58.780
 You know, I don't think there's a selection

2:05:58.780 --> 2:06:02.660
 for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.

2:06:02.660 --> 2:06:03.500
 Yes.

2:06:03.500 --> 2:06:06.020
 You know, but I guess sexual selection,

2:06:06.020 --> 2:06:09.580
 you know, males wanting to impress females

2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:13.700
 in different ways will lead to them wanting to.

2:06:13.700 --> 2:06:15.180
 Write poetry?

2:06:15.180 --> 2:06:16.740
 Well, yes, you know, show off.

2:06:16.740 --> 2:06:18.500
 Yeah, in all the different ways.

2:06:18.500 --> 2:06:20.620
 So all of these are natural consequences

2:06:20.620 --> 2:06:24.780
 of just coming up with strategies of how to cooperate

2:06:24.780 --> 2:06:27.240
 and how to achieve certain ends.

2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:28.860
 So that's just like a natural.

2:06:29.820 --> 2:06:31.980
 Yeah, I mean, we haven't spoken about sexual selection,

2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:34.020
 but that is a really important part of it.

2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:37.340
 You know, they try to out compete each other

2:06:37.340 --> 2:06:42.340
 in, you know, normally without any physical conflict,

2:06:43.100 --> 2:06:45.100
 just in order to be able to be chosen

2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:46.900
 by mates of the opposite sex.

2:06:46.900 --> 2:06:51.240
 And that is certainly a major source of creativity.

2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:56.220
 So you've studied chimps.

2:06:56.220 --> 2:06:59.340
 You also, all the other relatives, gorillas.

2:06:59.340 --> 2:07:01.940
 What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps,

2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:03.780
 about gorillas, about humans?

2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:07.140
 Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary,

2:07:07.140 --> 2:07:10.760
 that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.

2:07:10.760 --> 2:07:12.260
 How are we related?

2:07:12.260 --> 2:07:14.180
 What is the common ancestor?

2:07:14.180 --> 2:07:15.740
 What are the interesting differences?

2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:17.300
 I know I'm asking a million questions,

2:07:17.300 --> 2:07:22.300
 but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,

2:07:22.940 --> 2:07:25.060
 and humans, like how we're related,

2:07:25.060 --> 2:07:27.360
 and what you find fascinating about each?

2:07:29.340 --> 2:07:32.720
 In Africa, straddling the equator,

2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:37.300
 there is a strip of rainforest

2:07:37.300 --> 2:07:42.300
 that relies on the combination of high temperatures

2:07:42.300 --> 2:07:45.660
 and rainfall that you get around the equator.

2:07:45.660 --> 2:07:50.660
 That rainforest goes into about 22 countries.

2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:54.920
 And throughout those countries, you have chimpanzees,

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.160
 although they've gone extinct in two of them.

2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:02.600
 In just a fraction of them,

2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:04.720
 but it was five countries,

2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:09.720
 you've got gorillas, where there are mountains.

2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:12.880
 And in one country, on the left bank

2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:15.860
 of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.

2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:19.020
 So in the African forest,

2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:22.120
 you've got these three African apes, the only African apes,

2:08:23.160 --> 2:08:28.160
 all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.

2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:33.000
 They walk on their knuckles through the forest,

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:34.660
 looking for fruit trees,

2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:39.660
 and eating herbs when they can't find fruits.

2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:46.040
 Gorillas represent the oldest chain.

2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:49.000
 So about 10 million years ago,

2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.800
 maybe as recently as eight million years ago,

2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:54.040
 the ancestor of gorillas broke off

2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:57.300
 from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.

2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.800
 So they've probably remained very similar now

2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:04.680
 to what, very similar to what they were then.

2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:08.960
 They were probably the largest apes,

2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:13.840
 living in montane areas and spending more time

2:09:13.840 --> 2:09:17.860
 eating just herbs, stems,

2:09:19.140 --> 2:09:21.320
 not so vitally dependent on fruit.

2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:26.840
 And living in, if it was like the present,

2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:30.620
 groups up to about 50 stable groups,

2:09:30.620 --> 2:09:34.340
 with one alpha male who was in charge.

2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:42.000
 Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive

2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:46.360
 compared to chimps and bonobos.

2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:51.360
 And I had the privilege of spending a week or two

2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.000
 with gorillas at Dian Fossey's camp before she was murdered.

2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.000
 And I went out with two women,

2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.200
 Kelly and Barb, to a particular group.

2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.200
 And there was a young female in the group called Simba.

2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:16.240
 And Simba approached us and stared at the two women.

2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:18.840
 And then she came towards me

2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:23.840
 and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles

2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:26.680
 and touched me on the forehead.

2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:31.680
 She was watched in doing this by a young male

2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:34.000
 who was quite keen on her.

2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:35.800
 And he was called Digit.

2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:38.200
 And about five minutes later,

2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.080
 Digit stood in front of us on the path.

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:44.760
 And Kelly was in front of me,

2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:48.160
 and then there was Barb, and then there was me.

2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:49.920
 And he came charging down the path

2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:51.840
 and he sidestepped around Kelly,

2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:53.960
 and he sidestepped around Barb,

2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:57.640
 and me, he just knocked with his arm

2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:00.640
 and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.

2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:05.640
 And I love the way that that was a very deliberate response.

2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:10.080
 And I love the way that Simba had been so interested in me

2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:12.280
 and held my eye.

2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:15.040
 Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye,

2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:16.680
 but gorillas really look as though

2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:18.000
 they're trying to sort of figure out

2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:19.200
 what are you thinking about?

2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:24.200
 That was a species that has, goes back

2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:26.480
 for something like 10 million years.

2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:30.440
 In that situation, was there a game being played?

2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:35.000
 Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me,

2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.240
 I don't want you messing with Simba.

2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:40.280
 But was Simba using you?

2:11:40.280 --> 2:11:41.520
 Oh, I see.

2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.040
 Well, that's a fun idea.

2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:45.040
 I don't see why she should be using me,

2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:46.960
 but you mean to use me?

2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:49.800
 I see why she should be using me, but you mean testing

2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:53.240
 how strongly Digit was prepared to intervene to?

2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:54.080
 Yeah, exactly.

2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:57.400
 Oh, that's come straight out of a sort of adolescent

2:11:57.400 --> 2:11:58.320
 high school playbook.

2:11:58.320 --> 2:11:59.960
 All right, well, that's all.

2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:02.720
 No, no, no, there's nothing wrong with it for that.

2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:04.080
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.840
 I never thought of that, and you never know.

2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:09.800
 It's possible.

2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:14.160
 So, yeah, so, okay, so this is an ancient branch

2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:16.800
 of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla

2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:17.800
 that led to gorillas.

2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:19.200
 Gorillas.

2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:20.720
 So then the next thing that happened

2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:23.760
 on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago

2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:28.760
 when you have the line between chimps and bonobos

2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:34.200
 on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.

2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:36.880
 And basically what happened is that at that point,

2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:40.760
 a chimp like ancestor leaves the forest,

2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:45.240
 gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts,

2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:46.720
 and that becomes the Australopithecines

2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:50.920
 and meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor

2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:52.160
 continues in the forest.

2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:57.720
 And later what happens is that one branch of that

2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:00.160
 crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.

2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:02.840
 That was only about two million years ago,

2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:04.240
 maybe one million years ago.

2:13:05.360 --> 2:13:07.520
 Now the chimps that remained in the forest

2:13:07.520 --> 2:13:09.760
 throughout this time and occupied all the countries

2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:12.520
 across from west to east Africa now,

2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:16.000
 again, we assume that they're pretty similar

2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.560
 to the ones that live nowadays,

2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:21.840
 where there's some variation from west to east.

2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:25.840
 And these are animals that live in social communities

2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:29.920
 of between say 20 and 200.

2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:32.360
 They have a lot of them in one group,

2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:35.240
 but they never come together in a single unit.

2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:39.960
 These are, they share an area, a community territory,

2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:41.800
 and that area is defended by males

2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:43.800
 and within it, females wander

2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:46.120
 and bring up their young independently.

2:13:46.120 --> 2:13:49.880
 And the females are very scared

2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:53.800
 about the possibility that males

2:13:53.800 --> 2:13:55.840
 will be mean to their infants.

2:13:55.840 --> 2:13:58.640
 And in order to avoid them doing that,

2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:02.760
 they do their best to mate with every single male

2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:04.720
 in the group multiple times,

2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.520
 as if to give a memory in that male of,

2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:09.000
 yeah, yeah, I reminded you,

2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.600
 so I'm not gonna be mean to your baby.

2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:12.960
 So what's wonderful about chimps?

2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:15.200
 Well, you know, as we've spoken about them,

2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:20.120
 they are creative and sort of amazingly humanlike,

2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:22.800
 but I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments.

2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:24.080
 And here's one.

2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:30.760
 I've got two chimps who are grooming each other

2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:33.680
 on a day when they are utterly exhausted.

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:37.760
 They've walked 11 kilometers the day before,

2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:39.840
 up and down hills.

2:14:39.840 --> 2:14:42.200
 And on this particular day,

2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:44.360
 all they do is they get to one tree

2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:45.800
 and they eat from that tree.

2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:48.480
 And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards

2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:52.480
 and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.

2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:53.840
 So they're utterly exhausted

2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:56.680
 and they're just eating nonstop

2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:58.960
 because they're trying to recover their energy.

2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:02.840
 And this is Hugh and Charlie.

2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:04.400
 And we think they were probably brothers.

2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:08.520
 They've never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.

2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:11.640
 Well, I never remember now who it is,

2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:16.640
 but let's say that they both come down from the tree

2:15:17.040 --> 2:15:22.040
 and they're both carrying branches of the food.

2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:25.080
 They're actually seeds from these branches.

2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.240
 They're both engaged, even in the midday sun

2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:31.880
 when they want to come down and unshade themselves

2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:34.880
 for a bit on the ground, they're still eating.

2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:38.160
 But then Charlie finishes his branch

2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.120
 and he starts grooming Hugh.

2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:47.120
 And Hugh continues eating from his branch.

2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:53.240
 Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes

2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:57.800
 and he reaches out and he lifts the branch

2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:00.320
 from which Hugh is still taking seeds

2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:05.080
 and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back

2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:08.720
 as far as possible away from Hugh.

2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:10.680
 Hugh doesn't do anything.

2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:12.360
 He just finishes his mouthful

2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:15.000
 and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.

2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:16.760
 So this very polite way of saying,

2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:19.800
 will you groom me please has worked.

2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:24.800
 Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back

2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:29.440
 and around to the right side and then down his arm

2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:33.040
 to what point where he can reach the branch again.

2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:34.720
 And then he picks up the branch

2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:37.200
 and continues nonchalantly.

2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:38.040
 Right.

2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:42.000
 So in other words, a very sort of simple little strategy

2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:43.880
 but it just shows the courtesy

2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:47.080
 with which they can treat each other.

2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:49.320
 And the days I love with chimps

2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:50.440
 are when you see that sort of thing

2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:52.640
 or when you see mothers just lying

2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:55.240
 in a sunlit patch in the forest

2:16:55.240 --> 2:16:58.160
 with their babies bouncing on top of them,

2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:01.480
 just having a wonderful peaceful time.

2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:06.080
 And that's what most of their lives are like.

2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:09.680
 So chimpanzees are the species

2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:11.920
 that kind of unites the rest of the apes

2:17:11.920 --> 2:17:14.800
 because a gorilla is in many ways

2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:16.520
 just a big version of a chimpanzee.

2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:19.640
 If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind

2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:22.560
 to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.

2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:26.480
 And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River

2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:31.480
 are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee

2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:33.560
 but obviously humans didn't domesticate them.

2:17:33.560 --> 2:17:35.240
 So they're self domesticated.

2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:36.960
 They are less aggressive

2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:39.760
 and they show all the marks of domestication

2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:41.680
 that domestication animals do

2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:44.640
 compared to wild animals in their bones.

2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:47.520
 So they have reduced differences between males and females

2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:49.080
 in which the males are more like females.

2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:53.000
 They have smaller brains, they have shorter faces,

2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.600
 smaller teeth and smaller bodies.

2:17:55.600 --> 2:17:57.720
 All the things that domesticated animals show.

2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:01.280
 And bonobos live in this environment

2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:05.480
 in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.

2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:08.720
 There's no indication that they will have

2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:12.480
 these aggressive kills and enough data now to show

2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:13.960
 that there's a statistical difference

2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:16.440
 in the frequency of which it would happen.

2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:21.640
 And bonobos are famously erotic.

2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:26.640
 The females have enlarged sexual parts

2:18:27.480 --> 2:18:30.320
 which swell to particularly large size

2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:33.720
 compared to the female chimpanzees.

2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:38.200
 And the females have a lot of interactions with each other

2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:42.040
 in which they excitedly rub their clitorises together

2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:45.320
 and appear to have orgasms.

2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:47.560
 And these occur in the context

2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.400
 of some kind of social tension.

2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:53.880
 And they sometimes happen before,

2:18:53.880 --> 2:18:55.760
 they sometimes happen after the social tension,

2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:59.440
 and they seem to be devices, these interactions,

2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:02.280
 for ensuring that everyone's friends

2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:03.920
 and reducing the chances

2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:05.560
 that they're actually gonna get into a fight.

2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:10.560
 So it's a kind of conflict resolution through sex

2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:13.120
 or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.

2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:15.800
 Well, it's often characterized as make love, not war.

2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:18.280
 Make love, not war.

2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:22.960
 Okay, you mentioned to me offline

2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:25.600
 that you have a deep love for nature.

2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:28.400
 If we look at the world today,

2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:34.200
 how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature

2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:39.600
 remain a big part of our lives as human beings

2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:41.040
 in the way we think about it,

2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:46.040
 in the way we also keep it around, preserve it?

2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:47.960
 You know, we keep it part of our minds

2:19:47.960 --> 2:19:49.080
 and part of our world.

2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:55.120
 It's a very difficult question

2:19:55.120 --> 2:19:58.200
 because every time there was a conflict

2:19:58.200 --> 2:20:02.200
 between conservation of a natural habitat

2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:07.080
 and allowing people to get that little bit of extra food

2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:08.400
 for their babies,

2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:13.080
 then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.

2:20:13.960 --> 2:20:17.640
 And so we have this steady erosion

2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:22.200
 in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.

2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:25.960
 We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats

2:20:25.960 --> 2:20:27.960
 and all the species,

2:20:27.960 --> 2:20:30.840
 and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.

2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:34.600
 Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples

2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:36.480
 of something being saved,

2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:39.320
 but the overall trend is clear.

2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:43.000
 And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that

2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.200
 because it's not human.

2:20:46.520 --> 2:20:49.400
 Now that we are essentially a single tribe,

2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:55.280
 to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.

2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:02.200
 So I think the only way in which we can really conserve

2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:06.520
 is if we put tremendous effort

2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:11.520
 into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.

2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:18.840
 Often this will be the national parks that already exist.

2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:22.680
 And what we have to do is to make them so valuable

2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:26.560
 that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival

2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:29.040
 to be able to keep those sorts of places.

2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:32.720
 And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I

2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:33.680
 have taken in Uganda,

2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:38.680
 where we want to keep the Kibale National Park alive,

2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:41.280
 which has got the largest population chimpanzees

2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:42.120
 in Uganda,

2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.200
 and it's got elephants and wonderful birds

2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:46.720
 and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on,

2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:51.160
 and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.

2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:54.520
 It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases

2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:58.800
 in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism.

2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:02.600
 And you need to make sure that ecotourism is done right.

2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:06.480
 In other places, you will keep nature there

2:22:06.480 --> 2:22:11.480
 because it's useful for maintaining the climate,

2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:13.720
 bringing rain.

2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:20.120
 Maybe you can in some places convince people

2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:25.600
 of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature

2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:28.920
 that even over the long term,

2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:33.920
 presidents whose job it is to look for the future

2:22:34.280 --> 2:22:36.840
 of the country will be persuaded

2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:39.960
 that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.

2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:44.960
 But overall, what is required is for people

2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:50.920
 in the rich countries to do much more investment

2:22:50.920 --> 2:22:55.920
 than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places

2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:01.160
 in their own countries and in the tropics.

2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:02.680
 And if you look at Africa,

2:23:02.680 --> 2:23:07.680
 I mean, the population trends are that Nigeria

2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:12.920
 may become the most populous country in the world, I think,

2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.320
 or within a century.

2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:19.320
 The future of African habitats,

2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:21.880
 you know, it's clear what's gonna happen in general.

2:23:21.880 --> 2:23:23.920
 There's gonna be a huge conversion

2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:25.360
 towards agricultural land.

2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:32.040
 I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago

2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:36.480
 about the prospect of the entire globe

2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:39.720
 being turned into a single human feedlot.

2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:44.560
 It's gonna take a lot to avoid that.

2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:49.560
 He is out there calling for half the earth

2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:53.040
 to be devoted to nature.

2:23:53.040 --> 2:23:56.360
 It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.

2:23:56.360 --> 2:24:00.240
 But unless you have really exciting goals,

2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.720
 probably nothing will be achieved.

2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:06.040
 Yeah, I mean, there's something to me,

2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:08.480
 like when I visit New York and I see Central Park

2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:10.560
 and then somehow constructed a situation

2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:14.160
 where you preserve this park in the middle of the park,

2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:17.600
 probably some of the most expensive land in the world.

2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:19.600
 The fact that that's possible gives me hope

2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:22.800
 that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale,

2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:25.720
 perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons

2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:28.840
 of just valuing the beauty

2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:32.040
 and just respecting our origins

2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:35.200
 of having come from the earth.

2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:39.280
 We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees,

2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:43.240
 bonobos and gorillas as our close relatives

2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:44.480
 still living on the earth.

2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.600
 We're unlucky that we don't have Australopithecines

2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:48.080
 and other species of homo,

2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:49.640
 but we're still lucky to have those

2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:51.920
 because they are incredibly closely related to us

2:24:51.920 --> 2:24:54.440
 compared to what most animals have.

2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:56.880
 There are many animals that don't have any close relatives

2:24:56.880 --> 2:24:58.760
 to them on the earth.

2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:01.040
 But not only are they relatively close,

2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:03.520
 but they teach us so much about ourselves.

2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:06.920
 The similarities between them and ourselves

2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:09.480
 raise questions that we can then test

2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:13.880
 about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities

2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:16.760
 are derived from the same evolutionary stock

2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:18.960
 as in those great apes.

2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:21.160
 Well, how much is that worth?

2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:24.600
 I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars

2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:28.440
 to find evidence of bacteria there,

2:25:28.440 --> 2:25:30.400
 and that's fascinating too.

2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:33.160
 But we should be spending billions on this earth

2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:36.640
 in order to make sure that we have,

2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:40.200
 I don't know how to say it,

2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.640
 substantial representative populations

2:25:43.640 --> 2:25:45.440
 of these close relatives.

2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:47.000
 Yeah, that we can meet.

2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.400
 There's something like space tourism

2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:53.360
 when you go out into space and you look back down on earth.

2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:56.260
 That's to a lot of people, including myself,

2:25:56.260 --> 2:25:57.260
 is worth a lot.

2:25:58.120 --> 2:25:59.640
 But why is that worth a lot?

2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:04.640
 Is because it's humbling and beautiful

2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:07.800
 in the same way that meeting

2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:12.800
 our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.

2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:17.840
 Just to know that this is what we come from.

2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:19.340
 This is who we are.

2:26:19.340 --> 2:26:21.600
 Not just for the understanding or the science of it,

2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:24.940
 but just something about just the beauty of witnessing this.

2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:30.960
 And again, it's both humbling and empowering

2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:34.660
 that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.

2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:37.720
 Yes, and unfortunately,

2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:40.400
 the problems are incredibly difficult to solve

2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:42.400
 and there is no one solver.

2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:44.680
 It has to happen from a network

2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:47.800
 of potentially cooperating people.

2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:49.800
 But I mean, you're so right about it being daunting

2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:52.420
 to think about what it looks like from space.

2:26:52.420 --> 2:26:56.240
 And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed

2:26:56.240 --> 2:26:59.040
 of being able to go out from space.

2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:01.680
 And he said the whole of life

2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:04.400
 would look like a kind of rust on the planet.

2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:08.480
 Yeah, so the aliens were to visit.

2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:10.280
 I'm not sure they would notice the life.

2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:15.280
 They would probably notice the trees or ocean.

2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:17.520
 It's a kind of rust.

2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.480
 But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question.

2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:23.760
 What is the meaning of this rust?

2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:26.280
 What do you think is the meaning of life on Earth?

2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:28.980
 What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?

2:27:31.220 --> 2:27:32.140
 Well, I think it's very clear

2:27:32.140 --> 2:27:35.840
 that we have an evolutionary story

2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:40.840
 that is only getting challenged around the edges.

2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:44.800
 We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.

2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:48.780
 And the meaning is we are here

2:27:48.780 --> 2:27:57.780
 as a consequence of materialistic processes that began,

2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:03.080
 in our sense, with the establishment of the Earth

2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:04.920
 four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was,

2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:08.880
 and then water and oxygen and so on.

2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:12.840
 And we are the astonishing consequence

2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:17.840
 of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.

2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:22.840
 The word random is the wrong word to use

2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:24.840
 unless you understand what it means.

2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:28.840
 You know, it didn't happen by chance,

2:28:28.840 --> 2:28:30.840
 but a lot of random events had to happen

2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:32.840
 to make this possible.

2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:33.840
 And those random events, of course,

2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:37.840
 are the production of appropriate mutations.

2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:43.840
 But the meaning of life is there is no meaning.

2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:48.840
 The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?

2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:53.840
 And that same why propagates itself through the whole of it,

2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:55.840
 through the whole process of it,

2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:58.840
 for the emergence of planets, the emergence,

2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:02.840
 first of all, of galaxies, of star systems.

2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:09.840
 Of planets, of the proteins required

2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:11.840
 to construct the single cell organisms

2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:14.840
 and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms

2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:19.840
 and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land

2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:20.840
 and the whole of it.

2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:21.840
 And then there's fire,

2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:25.840
 some clever guy or lady invented fire,

2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:28.840
 and then now here we are.

2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:32.840
 It just does seem, speaking as a human,

2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:35.840
 kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole thing

2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:36.840
 or the whole...

2:29:36.840 --> 2:29:37.840
 Wonderful story.

2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:40.840
 So much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.

2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:42.840
 Yeah, it is beautiful,

2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:44.840
 but it just seems special that us humans

2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:49.840
 are able to write religions and construct stories

2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:51.840
 and also do science.

2:29:51.840 --> 2:29:56.840
 That seems kind of amazing.

2:29:56.840 --> 2:30:06.840
 It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us

2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:10.840
 that are able to investigate it.

2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:14.840
 And that's why there's this longing for why.

2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:20.840
 That's just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity

2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:21.840
 created by the universe.

2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:26.840
 It seems like there should be a why,

2:30:26.840 --> 2:30:28.840
 but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes

2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:33.840
 and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.

2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:35.840
 Even without an infinite number of universes,

2:30:35.840 --> 2:30:37.840
 I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.

2:30:37.840 --> 2:30:39.840
 Throughout this universe.

2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:41.840
 Yeah, now that we know how many planets

2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:43.840
 have the right sort of conditions,

2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:46.840
 which is what, I can't remember, a lot.

2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:49.840
 It's some significant percentage of all planets.

2:30:49.840 --> 2:30:54.840
 Then there are apparently billions of planets.

2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:59.840
 Things happen so quickly on Earth.

2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:02.840
 Once you've got water, then you've got life.

2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:07.840
 It did not take long for life to evolve

2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:09.840
 in the big scheme of things.

2:31:09.840 --> 2:31:11.840
 And if you think, you look out there,

2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:15.840
 say there's a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations,

2:31:15.840 --> 2:31:21.840
 one dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.

2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:26.840
 It's interesting to think what level of violence is useful

2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:30.840
 for extending the life of a civilization.

2:31:30.840 --> 2:31:33.840
 So we have a particular set of violence in our history.

2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:37.840
 Maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.

2:31:37.840 --> 2:31:41.840
 Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.

2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:42.840
 So you look at viruses.

2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:46.840
 What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?

2:31:46.840 --> 2:31:49.840
 If you're too deadly, that's a big problem.

2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:52.840
 If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.

2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:55.840
 So that is a fascinating exploration of...

2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:57.840
 I don't see any evidence.

2:31:57.840 --> 2:31:58.840
 I don't see where you're coming from

2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.840
 when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.

2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:05.840
 Well, because, I'll say it this way,

2:32:05.840 --> 2:32:11.840
 death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.

2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:13.840
 So violence...

2:32:13.840 --> 2:32:15.840
 But there's lots of ways to die without violence.

2:32:15.840 --> 2:32:18.840
 Right. To me, death in itself is violence.

2:32:18.840 --> 2:32:21.840
 And you can...

2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:23.840
 I mean, a lot of people that talk about, for example,

2:32:23.840 --> 2:32:26.840
 longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff,

2:32:26.840 --> 2:32:28.840
 they see death as a...

2:32:28.840 --> 2:32:30.840
 This is the way they talk about it.

2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:33.840
 And it's interesting to philosophically think of it that way.

2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:37.840
 Death is like mass murder that's happening.

2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:42.840
 People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life,

2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:46.840
 they see that you're helping...

2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:50.840
 The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization,

2:32:50.840 --> 2:32:52.840
 from their perspective,

2:32:52.840 --> 2:32:58.840
 is not allocating all our resources to solving death.

2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:01.840
 Right. Because death is a kind of violence.

2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:04.840
 It is the kind of murder that we're allowing

2:33:04.840 --> 2:33:06.840
 to be committed on us by nature.

2:33:06.840 --> 2:33:11.840
 And so the flip side of that is death makes way for new life,

2:33:11.840 --> 2:33:14.840
 for new ideas.

2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:18.840
 Yes. But that's got nothing to do with peace versus war.

2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:21.840
 You have animals that are very, very peaceful,

2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:24.840
 but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.

2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:28.840
 They just don't do it with death caused by violence.

2:33:28.840 --> 2:33:31.840
 And violent death is premature death, surely.

2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:34.840
 I don't mind about people dying.

2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:40.840
 What I mind about is people dying in their youth, middle age.

2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:41.840
 Prematurely.

2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:44.840
 But some people would say all death is premature.

2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:46.840
 It certainly feels that way.

2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:49.840
 It's died too soon.

2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:51.840
 Anyone who's ever died, died too soon.

2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:54.840
 Yeah. Well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias

2:33:54.840 --> 2:33:57.840
 and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years,

2:33:57.840 --> 2:33:59.840
 that would be great.

2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:01.840
 Do you ponder your own mortality?

2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:03.840
 Are you afraid of death?

2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:05.840
 I don't think I'm afraid of it.

2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:09.840
 I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.

2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:13.840
 I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life,

2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:18.840
 and I don't want to leave the party.

2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:22.840
 Yeah. It's kind of a fun party.

2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:24.840
 I don't want to leave the party either.

2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:27.840
 So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party.

2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:30.840
 And you're right.

2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:33.840
 Having a party with a little bit less violence in it

2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:35.840
 is an even more fun party.

2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:38.840
 Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time with me today.

2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:40.840
 Your work is amazing.

2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:45.840
 It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history

2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:47.840
 and the nature of human civilization.

2:34:47.840 --> 2:34:50.840
 So again, thank you so much for talking today.

2:34:50.840 --> 2:34:51.840
 It's an honor.

2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:52.840
 Well, thanks for your great questions.

2:34:52.840 --> 2:35:12.840
 It was a fun conversation.
