00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with Colin Angle.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.840
 He's the CEO and co founder of iRobot,

00:05.840 --> 00:08.180
 a robotics company that for 29 years

00:08.180 --> 00:11.180
 has been creating robots that operate successfully

00:11.180 --> 00:12.560
 in the real world.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.600
 Not as a demo or on a scale of dozens,

00:15.600 --> 00:18.860
 but on a scale of thousands and millions.

00:18.860 --> 00:21.900
 As of this year, iRobot has sold more than

00:21.900 --> 00:25.700
 25 million robots to consumers,

00:25.700 --> 00:28.160
 including the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot,

00:28.160 --> 00:29.960
 the Bravo floor mopping robot,

00:29.960 --> 00:33.960
 and soon the Terra lawn mowing robot.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.640
 29 million robots successfully operating autonomously

00:37.640 --> 00:39.640
 in real people's homes,

00:39.640 --> 00:42.060
 to me is an incredible accomplishment

00:42.060 --> 00:45.060
 of science, engineering, logistics,

00:45.060 --> 00:48.760
 and all kinds of general entrepreneurial innovation.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.320
 Most robotics companies fail.

00:51.320 --> 00:56.320
 iRobot has survived and succeeded for 29 years.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.860
 I spent all day at iRobot,

00:58.860 --> 01:01.440
 including a long tour and conversation with Colin

01:01.440 --> 01:03.480
 about the history of iRobot,

01:03.480 --> 01:06.740
 and then sat down for this podcast conversation

01:06.740 --> 01:08.560
 that would have been much longer

01:08.560 --> 01:10.780
 if I didn't spend all day learning about

01:10.780 --> 01:12.340
 and playing with the various robots

01:12.340 --> 01:13.980
 and the company's history.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.520
 I'll release the video of the tour separately.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.900
 Colin, iRobot, its founding team, its current team,

01:21.900 --> 01:24.660
 and its mission has been and continues to be

01:24.660 --> 01:27.620
 an inspiration to me and thousands of engineers

01:27.620 --> 01:30.260
 who are working hard to create AI systems

01:30.260 --> 01:33.020
 that help real people.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.660
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.020
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:38.020 --> 01:39.820
 give it five stars on iTunes,

01:39.820 --> 01:41.300
 support it on Patreon,

01:41.300 --> 01:43.300
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:43.300 --> 01:47.140
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:47.140 --> 01:51.120
 And now, here's my conversation with Colin Angle.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.200
 In his 1942 short story, Runaround,

01:55.200 --> 02:00.000
 from his iRobot collection, Asimov proposed

02:00.000 --> 02:02.880
 the three laws of robotics in order,

02:02.880 --> 02:06.840
 don't harm humans, obey orders, protect yourself.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.720
 So two questions.

02:07.720 --> 02:11.680
 First, does the Roomba follow these three laws?

02:11.680 --> 02:14.800
 And also, more seriously,

02:14.800 --> 02:17.160
 what role do you hope to see robots take

02:17.160 --> 02:21.320
 in modern society and in the future world?

02:21.320 --> 02:25.760
 So the three laws are very thought provoking

02:25.760 --> 02:30.760
 and require such a profound understanding

02:31.400 --> 02:36.280
 of the world a robot lives in,

02:36.280 --> 02:40.040
 the ramifications of its action and its own sense of self

02:40.040 --> 02:45.040
 that it's not a relevant bar,

02:45.040 --> 02:50.040
 at least it won't be a relevant bar for decades to come.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.560
 And so if Roomba follows the three laws,

02:54.560 --> 02:56.900
 and I believe it does,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.920
 it is designed to help humans, not hurt them,

03:00.920 --> 03:03.120
 it's designed to be inherently safe,

03:03.120 --> 03:05.980
 and we designed it to last a long time.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.600
 It's not through any AI or intent on the robot's part.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.960
 It's because following the three laws

03:14.960 --> 03:18.220
 is aligned with being a good robot product.

03:19.620 --> 03:23.120
 So I guess it does,

03:23.120 --> 03:27.240
 but not by explicit design.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.800
 So then the bigger picture,

03:28.800 --> 03:33.040
 what role do you hope to see robotics, robots take

03:33.040 --> 03:37.360
 in what's currently mostly a world of humans?

03:37.360 --> 03:42.360
 We need robots to help us continue

03:42.360 --> 03:44.960
 to improve our standard of living.

03:46.120 --> 03:51.120
 We need robots because the average age

03:51.320 --> 03:55.040
 of humanity is increasing very quickly,

03:55.040 --> 03:59.760
 and simply the number of people young enough

03:59.760 --> 04:01.600
 and spry enough to care

04:01.600 --> 04:06.600
 for the elder growing demographic is inadequate.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.400
 And so what is the role of robots?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.880
 Today, the role is to make our lives a little easier,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.320
 a little cleaner, maybe a little healthier.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.120
 But in time, robots are going to be the difference

04:22.120 --> 04:25.680
 between real gut wrenching declines

04:25.680 --> 04:28.080
 in our ability to live independently

04:28.080 --> 04:30.240
 and maintain our standard of living,

04:30.240 --> 04:34.880
 and a future that is the bright one

04:34.880 --> 04:37.480
 where we have more control over our lives,

04:37.480 --> 04:40.560
 can spend more of our time focused

04:40.560 --> 04:43.160
 on activities we choose.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.920
 And I'm so honored and excited

04:47.920 --> 04:50.400
 to be playing a role in that journey.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.720
 So you've given me a tour.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.960
 It showed me some of the long histories,

04:53.960 --> 04:57.120
 now 29 years that iRobot has been at it,

04:57.120 --> 04:59.200
 creating some incredible robots.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.160
 You showed me Pacbot.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.480
 You showed me a bunch of other stuff that led up to Roomba,

05:04.480 --> 05:08.640
 that led to Braava and Terra.

05:08.640 --> 05:13.640
 So let's skip that incredible history

05:14.080 --> 05:15.040
 in the interest of time,

05:15.040 --> 05:16.120
 cause we already talked about it.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.040
 I'll show this incredible footage.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.640
 You mentioned elderly and robotics in society.

05:22.640 --> 05:26.280
 I think the home is a fascinating place for robots to be.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.800
 So where do you see robots in the home?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.640
 Currently, I would say, once again,

05:31.640 --> 05:34.520
 probably most homes in the world don't have a robot.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.160
 So how do you see that changing?

05:36.160 --> 05:39.840
 What do you think is the big initial value add

05:39.840 --> 05:41.920
 that robots can do?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.960
 So iRobot has sort of, over the years,

05:44.960 --> 05:49.360
 narrowed in on the home, the consumer's home,

05:49.360 --> 05:53.120
 as the place where we want to innovate

05:53.120 --> 05:58.120
 and deliver tools that will help a home

05:59.360 --> 06:04.240
 be a more automatically maintained place,

06:04.240 --> 06:06.800
 a healthier place, a safer place,

06:06.800 --> 06:11.480
 and perhaps even a more efficient place to be.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.040
 And today, we vacuum, we mop,

06:15.040 --> 06:16.960
 soon we'll be mowing your lawn.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.480
 But where things are going is,

06:22.720 --> 06:27.080
 when do we get to the point where the home,

06:27.080 --> 06:29.120
 not just the robots that live in your home,

06:29.120 --> 06:32.160
 but the home itself becomes part of a system

06:32.160 --> 06:35.960
 that maintains itself and plays an active role

06:35.960 --> 06:40.760
 in caring for and helping the people live in that home.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.200
 And I see everything that we're doing

06:43.200 --> 06:46.160
 as steps along the path toward that future.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.720
 So what are the steps?

06:47.720 --> 06:51.720
 So if we can summarize some of the history of Roomba,

06:53.280 --> 06:55.520
 you've mentioned, and maybe you can elaborate on it,

06:55.520 --> 06:57.240
 but you mentioned that the early days

06:57.240 --> 07:02.240
 were really taking a robot from something that works

07:02.320 --> 07:04.880
 either in the lab or something that works in the field

07:04.880 --> 07:09.880
 that helps soldiers do the difficult work they do

07:10.200 --> 07:12.640
 to actually be in the hands of consumers

07:12.640 --> 07:15.640
 and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of robots

07:15.640 --> 07:18.480
 that don't break down over how much people love them

07:18.480 --> 07:21.440
 over months of very extensive use.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.840
 So that was the big first step.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.000
 And then the second big step was the ability

07:26.000 --> 07:29.920
 to sense the environment, to build a map, to localize,

07:29.920 --> 07:32.560
 to be able to build a picture of the home

07:32.560 --> 07:34.600
 that the human can then attach labels to

07:34.600 --> 07:38.400
 in terms of giving some semantic knowledge

07:38.400 --> 07:40.880
 to the robot about its environment.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.840
 Okay, so that's like a huge, two big, huge steps.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.520
 Maybe you can comment on them,

07:47.520 --> 07:51.040
 but also what is the next step

07:51.040 --> 07:54.720
 of making a robot part of the home?

07:54.720 --> 07:57.840
 Sure, so the goal is to make a home

07:57.840 --> 08:01.280
 that takes care of itself,

08:01.280 --> 08:03.680
 takes care of the people in the home,

08:03.680 --> 08:07.840
 and gives the user an experience of just living their life

08:07.840 --> 08:10.840
 and the home is somehow doing the right thing,

08:10.840 --> 08:14.120
 turning on and off lights when you leave,

08:14.120 --> 08:17.240
 cleaning up the environment.

08:17.240 --> 08:24.920
 And we went from robots that were great in the lab,

08:24.920 --> 08:27.200
 but were both too expensive

08:27.200 --> 08:32.880
 and not sufficiently capable to ever do an acceptable job

08:32.880 --> 08:37.280
 of anything other than being a toy or a curio in your home

08:37.280 --> 08:42.080
 to something that was both affordable

08:42.080 --> 08:45.720
 and sufficiently effective to drive,

08:45.720 --> 08:50.600
 be above threshold and drive purchase intent.

08:50.600 --> 08:55.440
 Now we've disrupted the entire vacuuming industry.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.760
 The number one selling vacuums, for example, in the US

08:59.760 --> 09:02.840
 are Roombas, so not robot vacuums, but vacuums,

09:02.840 --> 09:05.480
 and that's really crazy and weird.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.000
 We need to pause that. I mean, that's incredible.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.440
 That's incredible that a robot

09:10.440 --> 09:15.480
 is the number one selling thing that does something.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.880
 Yep. Something as essential as vacuuming.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.000
 Yep. Congratulations.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.360
 Thank you. It's still kind of fun to say,

09:22.360 --> 09:26.520
 but just because this was a crazy idea

09:26.520 --> 09:30.880
 that just started, you know, in a room here,

09:30.880 --> 09:33.600
 we're like, do you think we can do this?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.960
 So, hey, let's give it a try.

09:35.960 --> 09:42.760
 But now the robots are starting to understand their environment.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.240
 And if you think about the next step,

09:46.240 --> 09:48.640
 there's two dimensions.

09:48.640 --> 09:52.960
 I've been working so hard since the beginning of iRobot

09:52.960 --> 09:55.000
 to make robots are autonomous,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.560
 that, you know, they're smart enough

09:57.560 --> 09:59.400
 and understand their task enough,

09:59.400 --> 10:04.080
 they can just go do it without human involvement.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.360
 Now what I'm really excited and working on

10:07.360 --> 10:10.560
 is how do I make them less autonomous?

10:10.560 --> 10:15.680
 Meaning that the robot is supposed to be your partner,

10:15.680 --> 10:20.120
 not this automaton that just goes and does what a robot does.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.440
 And so that if you tell it,

10:23.440 --> 10:27.080
 hey, I just dropped some flour by the fridge in the kitchen,

10:27.080 --> 10:28.920
 can you deal with it?

10:28.920 --> 10:32.720
 Wouldn't it be awesome if the right thing just happened

10:32.720 --> 10:35.200
 based on that utterance?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.840
 And to some extent, that's less autonomous

10:37.840 --> 10:40.080
 because it's actually listening to you,

10:40.080 --> 10:44.360
 understanding the context and intent of the sentence,

10:44.360 --> 10:47.360
 mapping it against its understanding

10:47.360 --> 10:52.640
 of the home it lives in and knowing what to do.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.320
 And so that's an area of research.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.360
 It's an area where we're starting to roll out features.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.840
 You can now tell your robot to clean up the kitchen

11:02.840 --> 11:05.840
 and it knows what the kitchen is and can do that.

11:05.840 --> 11:10.400
 And that's sort of 1.0 of where we're going.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.000
 The other cool thing is that we're starting

11:13.000 --> 11:14.600
 to know where stuff is.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.960
 And why is that important?

11:15.960 --> 11:21.480
 Well, robots are supposed to have arms, right?

11:21.480 --> 11:25.200
 Data had an arm, Rosie had an arm, Robbie the robot had an arm.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.680
 I mean, robots are, you know, they are physical things

11:27.680 --> 11:29.480
 that move around in an environment

11:29.480 --> 11:31.200
 and they're supposed to like do work.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
 And if you think about it,

11:34.080 --> 11:37.200
 if a robot doesn't know where anything is,

11:37.200 --> 11:38.720
 why should it have an arm?

11:38.720 --> 11:44.320
 But with this new dawn of home understanding

11:44.320 --> 11:47.680
 that we're starting to go enjoy,

11:47.680 --> 11:49.320
 I know where the kitchen is.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.000
 I might in the future know where the refrigerator is.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.240
 I might, if I had an arm, be able to find the handle,

11:55.240 --> 11:58.440
 open it and even get myself a beer.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.880
 Obviously, that's one of the true dreams of robotics

12:01.880 --> 12:03.480
 is to have robots bringing us a beer

12:03.480 --> 12:05.240
 while we watch television.

12:05.240 --> 12:10.960
 But, you know, I think that that new category of tasks

12:10.960 --> 12:14.200
 where physical manipulation, robot arms,

12:14.200 --> 12:20.160
 is just a potpourri of new opportunity and excitement.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.760
 And you see humans as a crucial part of that.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.240
 So you kind of mentioned that.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.880
 And I personally find that a really compelling idea.

12:28.880 --> 12:33.920
 I think full autonomy can only take us so far,

12:33.920 --> 12:35.320
 especially in the home.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.880
 So you see humans as helping the robot understand

12:38.880 --> 12:43.560
 or give deeper meaning to the spatial information.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.760
 Right. It's a partnership.

12:46.760 --> 12:52.760
 The robot is supposed to operate according to descriptors

12:52.760 --> 12:57.040
 that you would use to describe your own home.

12:57.040 --> 13:02.200
 The robot is supposed to, in lieu of better direction,

13:02.200 --> 13:03.920
 kind of go about its routine,

13:03.920 --> 13:07.640
 which ought to be basically right,

13:07.640 --> 13:12.800
 and lead to a home maintained in a way

13:12.800 --> 13:14.960
 that it's learned you like,

13:14.960 --> 13:21.560
 but also be perpetually ready to take direction

13:21.560 --> 13:26.360
 that would activate a different set of behaviors

13:26.360 --> 13:28.960
 or actions to meet a current need

13:28.960 --> 13:32.360
 to the extent it could actually perform that task.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.400
 So I got to ask you, I think this is a fundamental

13:35.400 --> 13:37.000
 and a fascinating question,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.800
 because iRobot has been a successful company

13:39.800 --> 13:42.360
 and a rare successful robotics company.

13:42.360 --> 13:46.760
 So Anki, Jibo, Mayfield Robotics with their robot curry,

13:46.760 --> 13:50.560
 SciFi Works, Rethink Robotics, these are robotics companies

13:50.560 --> 13:54.040
 that were founded and run by brilliant people.

13:54.040 --> 13:59.680
 But all, very unfortunately, at least for us roboticists,

13:59.680 --> 14:02.120
 all went out of business recently.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.120
 So why do you think they didn't last longer?

14:05.120 --> 14:10.640
 Why do you think it is so hard to keep a robotics company alive?

14:10.640 --> 14:14.120
 You know, I say this only partially in jest

14:14.120 --> 14:17.800
 that back in the day before Roomba,

14:17.800 --> 14:23.920
 you know, I was a high tech entrepreneur building robots.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.400
 But it wasn't until I became a vacuum cleaner salesman

14:26.400 --> 14:29.400
 that we had any success.

14:29.400 --> 14:34.200
 So, I mean, the point is technology alone

14:34.200 --> 14:37.680
 doesn't equal a successful business.

14:37.680 --> 14:43.560
 We need to go and find the compelling need

14:43.560 --> 14:47.600
 where the robot that we're creating

14:47.600 --> 14:53.600
 can deliver clearly more value to the end user

14:53.600 --> 14:55.400
 than it costs.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.000
 And this is not a marginal thing

14:59.000 --> 15:00.400
 where you're looking at the scale and you're like,

15:00.400 --> 15:01.800
 yeah, it's close.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.360
 Maybe we can hold our breath and make it work.

15:04.360 --> 15:11.560
 It's clearly more value than the cost of the robot

15:11.560 --> 15:13.840
 to bring, you know, in the store.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.440
 And I think that the challenge has been finding

15:17.440 --> 15:24.760
 those businesses where that's true

15:24.760 --> 15:28.240
 in a sustainable fashion.

15:28.240 --> 15:34.600
 You know, when you get into entertainment style things,

15:34.600 --> 15:38.240
 you could be the cat's meow one year,

15:38.240 --> 15:43.360
 but 85% of toys, regardless of their merit,

15:43.360 --> 15:45.600
 fail to make it to their second season.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.720
 It's just super hard to do so.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.840
 And so that's just a tough business.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.760
 And there has been a lot of experimentation

15:57.760 --> 16:02.680
 around what is the right type of social companion,

16:02.680 --> 16:05.840
 what is the right robot in the home

16:05.840 --> 16:14.600
 that is doing something other than tasks people do every week

16:14.600 --> 16:17.520
 that they'd rather not do.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.920
 And I'm not sure we've got it all figured out right.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.000
 And so that you get brilliant roboticists

16:23.000 --> 16:25.720
 with super interesting robots

16:25.720 --> 16:32.880
 that ultimately don't quite have that magical user experience

16:32.880 --> 16:40.600
 and thus that value benefit equation remains ambiguous.

16:40.600 --> 16:45.760
 So you as somebody who dreams of robots changing the world,

16:45.760 --> 16:48.800
 what's your estimate?

16:48.800 --> 16:53.280
 How big is the space of applications

16:53.280 --> 16:55.760
 that fit the criteria that you just described

16:55.760 --> 17:00.560
 where you can really demonstrate an obvious significant value

17:00.560 --> 17:05.720
 over the alternative non robotic solution?

17:05.720 --> 17:10.040
 Well, I think that we're just about none of the way

17:10.040 --> 17:13.400
 to achieving the potential of robotics at home.

17:13.400 --> 17:20.440
 But we have to do it in a really eyes wide open,

17:20.440 --> 17:21.920
 honest fashion.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.440
 And so another way to put that is the potential is infinite

17:25.440 --> 17:27.080
 because we did take a few steps,

17:27.080 --> 17:29.680
 but you're saying those steps are just very initial steps.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.600
 So the Roomba is a hugely successful product,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.280
 but you're saying that's just the very, very beginning.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.560
 That's just the very, very beginning.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.040
 It's the foot in the door.

17:38.040 --> 17:45.120
 And I think I was lucky that in the early days of robotics,

17:45.120 --> 17:48.440
 people would ask me, when are you going to clean my floor?

17:48.440 --> 17:53.600
 It was something that I grew up saying,

17:53.600 --> 17:54.800
 I got all these really good ideas,

17:54.800 --> 17:58.120
 but everyone seems to want their floor clean.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.400
 And so maybe we should do that.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
 Yeah, your good ideas.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.840
 Earn the right to do the next thing after that.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.120
 So the good ideas have to match with the desire of the people

18:10.120 --> 18:13.240
 and then the actual cost has to like the business,

18:13.240 --> 18:16.640
 the financial aspect has to all match together.

18:16.640 --> 18:21.240
 Yeah, during our partnership back a number of years ago

18:21.240 --> 18:24.080
 with Johnson Wax, they would explain to me

18:24.080 --> 18:32.520
 that they would go into homes and just watch how people lived

18:32.520 --> 18:35.560
 and try to figure out what were they doing

18:35.560 --> 18:39.960
 that they really didn't really like to do,

18:39.960 --> 18:42.440
 but they had to do it frequently enough

18:42.440 --> 18:51.720
 that it was top of mind and understood as a burden.

18:51.720 --> 18:55.840
 Hey, let's make a product or come up with a solution

18:55.840 --> 19:02.040
 to make that pain point less challenging.

19:02.040 --> 19:07.400
 And sometimes we do certain burdens so often as a society

19:07.400 --> 19:09.400
 that we actually don't even realize,

19:09.400 --> 19:11.480
 like it's actually hard to see that that burden

19:11.480 --> 19:13.200
 is something that could be removed.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.120
 So it does require just going into the home and staring at,

19:17.120 --> 19:19.560
 wait, how do I actually live life?

19:19.560 --> 19:21.080
 What are the pain points?

19:21.080 --> 19:26.400
 Yeah, and getting those insights is a lot harder

19:26.400 --> 19:29.360
 than it would seem it should be in retrospect.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.120
 So how hard on that point?

19:33.120 --> 19:37.440
 I mean, one of the big challenges of robotics

19:37.440 --> 19:42.200
 is driving the cost down to something

19:42.200 --> 19:45.680
 that consumers, people would afford.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.840
 So people would be less likely to buy a Roomba

19:48.840 --> 19:53.320
 if it cost $500,000, which is probably

19:53.320 --> 19:58.040
 sort of what a Roomba would cost several decades ago.

19:58.040 --> 20:02.200
 So how do you drive, which I mentioned is very difficult,

20:02.200 --> 20:05.320
 how do you drive the cost of a Roomba or a robot down

20:05.320 --> 20:07.920
 such that people would want to buy it?

20:07.920 --> 20:11.600
 When I started building robots, the cost of the robot

20:11.600 --> 20:15.480
 had a lot to do with the amount of time it took to build it.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.400
 And so that we build our robots out of aluminum,

20:18.400 --> 20:21.400
 I would go spend my time in the machine shop

20:21.400 --> 20:28.000
 on the milling machine, cutting out the parts and so forth.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.680
 And then when we got into the toy industry,

20:29.680 --> 20:34.280
 I realized that if we were building at scale,

20:34.280 --> 20:35.920
 I could determine the cost of the Roomba

20:35.920 --> 20:38.880
 instead of adding up all the hours to mill out the parts,

20:38.880 --> 20:42.080
 but by weighing it.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.200
 And that's liberating.

20:44.200 --> 20:48.600
 You can say, wow, the world has just

20:48.600 --> 20:51.560
 changed as I think about construction

20:51.560 --> 20:53.160
 in a different way.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.920
 The 3D CAD tools that are available to us today,

20:56.920 --> 21:02.920
 the operating at scale where I can do tooling and injection

21:02.920 --> 21:07.120
 mold, an arbitrarily complicated part,

21:07.120 --> 21:09.840
 and the cost is going to be basically

21:09.840 --> 21:13.960
 the weight of the plastic in that part,

21:13.960 --> 21:16.360
 is incredibly exciting and liberating

21:16.360 --> 21:18.560
 and opens up all sorts of opportunities.

21:18.560 --> 21:26.760
 And for the sensing part of it, where we are today is instead

21:26.760 --> 21:30.640
 of trying to build skin, which is really hard.

21:30.640 --> 21:38.240
 For a long time, I spent creating strategies and ideas

21:38.240 --> 21:42.720
 around how could we duplicate the skin on the human body

21:42.720 --> 21:45.000
 because it's such an amazing sensor.

21:47.880 --> 21:53.920
 Instead of going down that path, why don't we focus on vision?

21:53.920 --> 21:57.280
 And how many of the problems that

21:57.280 --> 22:02.880
 face a robot trying to do real work

22:02.880 --> 22:09.680
 could be solved with a cheap camera and a big ass computer?

22:09.680 --> 22:12.360
 Moore's law continues to work.

22:12.360 --> 22:16.440
 The cell phone industry, the mobile industry

22:16.440 --> 22:19.360
 is giving us better and better tools that can run

22:19.360 --> 22:21.000
 on these embedded computers.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.880
 And I think we passed an important moment maybe

22:27.880 --> 22:33.640
 two years ago where you could put machine vision

22:33.640 --> 22:39.520
 capable processors on robots at consumer price points.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.960
 And I was waiting for it to happen.

22:42.960 --> 22:49.480
 We avoided putting lasers on our robots to do navigation

22:49.480 --> 22:51.800
 and instead spent years researching

22:51.800 --> 22:54.600
 how to do vision based navigation

22:54.600 --> 23:00.400
 because you could just see where these technology

23:00.400 --> 23:01.520
 trends were going.

23:01.520 --> 23:06.680
 And between injection molded plastic and a camera

23:06.680 --> 23:10.800
 with a computer capable of running machine learning

23:10.800 --> 23:12.920
 and visual object recognition, I could

23:12.920 --> 23:18.640
 build an incredibly affordable, incredibly capable robot.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.160
 And that's going to be the future.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.400
 So on that point with a small tangent,

23:23.400 --> 23:27.000
 but I think an important one, another industry in which I

23:27.000 --> 23:30.760
 would say the only other industry in which there

23:30.760 --> 23:34.760
 is automation actually touching people's lives today

23:34.760 --> 23:37.560
 is autonomous vehicles.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.160
 What the vision you just described

23:40.160 --> 23:44.400
 of using computer vision and using cheap camera sensors,

23:44.400 --> 23:48.160
 there's a debate on that of LIDAR versus computer vision.

23:48.160 --> 23:54.360
 And the Elon Musk famously said that LIDAR

23:54.360 --> 23:58.360
 is a crutch that really in the long term,

23:58.360 --> 24:02.000
 camera only is the right solution, which echoes some

24:02.000 --> 24:03.480
 of the ideas you're expressing.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.760
 Of course, the domain in terms of its safety criticality

24:06.760 --> 24:07.600
 is different.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.640
 But what do you think about that approach

24:10.640 --> 24:13.360
 in the autonomous vehicle space?

24:13.360 --> 24:15.160
 And in general, do you see a connection

24:15.160 --> 24:18.480
 between the incredible real world challenges

24:18.480 --> 24:20.680
 you have to solve in the home with Roomba?

24:20.680 --> 24:24.000
 And I saw a demonstration of some of them, corner cases

24:24.000 --> 24:27.800
 literally, and autonomous vehicles.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.600
 So there's absolutely a tremendous overlap

24:31.600 --> 24:36.560
 between both the problems a robot vacuum

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
 and an autonomous vehicle are trying to solve

24:38.560 --> 24:41.840
 and the tools and the types of sensors

24:41.840 --> 24:47.960
 that are being applied in the pursuit of the solutions.

24:47.960 --> 24:53.880
 In my world, my environment is actually

24:53.880 --> 24:57.320
 much harder than the environment an automobile travels.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.800
 We don't have roads.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.280
 We have t shirts.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.680
 We have steps.

25:02.680 --> 25:07.120
 We have a near infinite number of patterns and colors

25:07.120 --> 25:10.160
 and surface textures on the floor.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.960
 Especially from a visual perspective.

25:11.960 --> 25:18.840
 So the way the world looks is an infinitely variable.

25:18.840 --> 25:22.520
 On the other hand, safety is way easier on the inside.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.480
 My robots, they're not very heavy.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.280
 They're not very fast.

25:28.280 --> 25:32.680
 If they bump into your foot, you think it's funny.

25:32.680 --> 25:39.400
 And autonomous vehicles kind of have the inverse problem.

25:39.400 --> 25:45.920
 And so that for me saying vision is the future,

25:45.920 --> 25:49.440
 I can say that without reservation.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.720
 For autonomous vehicles, I think I

25:51.720 --> 25:56.840
 believe what Elon's saying about the future

25:56.840 --> 25:59.040
 is ultimately going to be vision.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.000
 Maybe if we put a cheap lighter on there as a backup sensor,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.800
 it might not be the worst idea in the world.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.000
 So the stakes are much higher.

26:05.000 --> 26:05.840
 The stakes are much higher.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.080
 You have to be much more careful thinking through how far away

26:09.080 --> 26:10.720
 that future is.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.520
 Right.

26:11.520 --> 26:17.880
 But I think that the primary environmental understanding

26:17.880 --> 26:21.800
 sensor is going to be a visual system.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.000
 Visual system.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.560
 So on that point, well, let me ask,

26:25.560 --> 26:29.440
 do you hope there's an iRobot robot in every home

26:29.440 --> 26:31.880
 in the world one day?

26:31.880 --> 26:38.120
 I expect there to be at least one iRobot robot in every home.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.160
 We've sold 25 million robots.

26:41.160 --> 26:47.080
 So we're in about 10% of US homes, which is a great start.

26:47.080 --> 26:52.240
 But I think that when we think about the numbers of things

26:52.240 --> 26:57.520
 that robots can do, today I can vacuum your floor,

26:57.520 --> 27:00.040
 mop your floor, cut your lawn, or soon

27:00.040 --> 27:02.880
 we'll be able to cut your lawn.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.640
 But there are more things that we could do in the home.

27:06.640 --> 27:12.240
 And I hope that we continue using the techniques I described

27:12.240 --> 27:16.240
 around exploiting computer vision and low cost

27:16.240 --> 27:20.960
 manufacturing that we'll be able to create these solutions

27:20.960 --> 27:22.640
 at affordable price points.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.600
 So let me ask on that point of a robot in every home,

27:25.600 --> 27:26.880
 that's my dream as well.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.960
 I'd love to see that.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.880
 I think the possibilities there are indeed

27:31.880 --> 27:34.520
 infinite positive possibilities.

27:34.520 --> 27:39.760
 But in our current culture, no thanks to science fiction

27:39.760 --> 27:45.320
 and so on, there's a serious kind of hesitation, anxiety,

27:45.320 --> 27:51.480
 concern about robots, and also a concern about privacy.

27:51.480 --> 27:55.040
 And it's a fascinating question to me

27:55.040 --> 27:59.560
 why that concern is amongst a certain group of people

27:59.560 --> 28:02.840
 is as intense as it is.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.480
 So you have to think about it because it's a serious concern.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.000
 But I wonder how you address it best.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.840
 So from a perspective of vision sensors,

28:09.840 --> 28:14.320
 so robots that move about the home and sense the world,

28:14.320 --> 28:19.720
 how do you alleviate people's privacy concerns?

28:19.720 --> 28:21.080
 How do you make sure that they can

28:21.080 --> 28:26.680
 trust iRobot and the robots that they share their home with?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.200
 I think that's a great question.

28:28.200 --> 28:33.760
 And we've really leaned way forward on this

28:33.760 --> 28:39.440
 because given our vision as to the role the company intends

28:39.440 --> 28:43.720
 to play in the home, really for us,

28:43.720 --> 28:48.160
 make or break is can our approach

28:48.160 --> 28:50.920
 be trusted to protecting the data

28:50.920 --> 28:53.520
 and the privacy of the people who have our robots?

28:53.520 --> 28:57.600
 And so we've gone out publicly with a privacy

28:57.600 --> 29:00.360
 manifesto stating we'll never sell your data.

29:00.360 --> 29:05.480
 We've adopted GDPR not just where GDPR is required,

29:05.480 --> 29:09.120
 but globally.

29:09.120 --> 29:18.000
 We have ensured that images don't leave the robot.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.080
 So processing data from the visual sensors

29:22.080 --> 29:23.680
 happens locally on the robot.

29:23.680 --> 29:30.720
 And only semantic knowledge of the home with the consumer's

29:30.720 --> 29:32.720
 consent is sent up.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.400
 We show you what we know and are trying

29:35.400 --> 29:45.000
 to go use data as an enabler for the performance of the robots

29:45.000 --> 29:50.720
 with the informed consent and understanding of the people who

29:50.720 --> 29:55.720
 own those robots.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.840
 We take it very seriously.

29:56.840 --> 30:03.840
 And ultimately, we think that by showing a customer that

30:03.840 --> 30:07.320
 if you let us build a semantic map of your home

30:07.320 --> 30:09.240
 and know where the rooms are, well, then

30:09.240 --> 30:11.720
 you can say clean the kitchen.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.480
 If you don't want the robot to do that, don't make the map.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.960
 It'll do its best job cleaning your home.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.720
 But it won't be able to do that.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.120
 And if you ever want us to forget that we know that it's

30:21.120 --> 30:24.400
 your kitchen, you can have confidence

30:24.400 --> 30:26.800
 that we will do that for you.

30:26.800 --> 30:35.800
 So we're trying to go and be a data 2.0 perspective company

30:35.800 --> 30:39.200
 where we treat the data that the robots have

30:39.200 --> 30:43.200
 of the consumer's home as if it were the consumer's data

30:43.200 --> 30:47.360
 and that they have rights to it.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.880
 So we think by being the good guys on this front,

30:50.880 --> 30:55.080
 we can build the trust and thus be entrusted

30:55.080 --> 31:00.160
 to enable robots to do more things that are thoughtful.

31:00.160 --> 31:04.760
 You think people's worries will diminish over time?

31:04.760 --> 31:07.040
 As a society, broadly speaking, do you

31:07.040 --> 31:10.600
 think you can win over trust not just for the company,

31:10.600 --> 31:14.920
 but just the comfort that people have with AI in their home

31:14.920 --> 31:17.040
 enriching their lives in some way?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.560
 I think we're in an interesting place today

31:19.560 --> 31:22.360
 where it's less about winning them over

31:22.360 --> 31:26.720
 and more about finding a way to talk about privacy in a way

31:26.720 --> 31:28.880
 that more people can understand.

31:28.880 --> 31:33.320
 I would tell you that today, when there's a privacy breach,

31:33.320 --> 31:37.000
 people get very upset and then go to the store

31:37.000 --> 31:39.320
 and buy the cheapest thing, paying no attention

31:39.320 --> 31:42.080
 to whether or not the products that they're buying

31:42.080 --> 31:44.600
 honor privacy standards or not.

31:44.600 --> 31:50.040
 In fact, if I put on the package of my Roomba,

31:50.040 --> 31:53.560
 the privacy commitments that we have,

31:53.560 --> 31:58.680
 I would sell less than I would if I did nothing at all.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.360
 And that needs to change.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.880
 So it's not a question about earning trust.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.920
 I think that's necessary but not sufficient.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.520
 We need to figure out how to have

32:06.520 --> 32:10.800
 a comfortable set of what is the grade A meat

32:10.800 --> 32:17.640
 standard applied to privacy that customers can trust

32:17.640 --> 32:20.280
 and understand and then use in their buying decisions.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.520
 That will reward companies for good behavior

32:25.520 --> 32:29.880
 and that will ultimately be how this moves forward.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.640
 And maybe be part of the conversation

32:32.640 --> 32:34.800
 between regular people about what it means,

32:34.800 --> 32:36.280
 what privacy means.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.440
 If you have some standards, you can say,

32:38.440 --> 32:41.080
 you can start talking about who's following them,

32:41.080 --> 32:42.640
 who does not have more.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.440
 Because most people are actually quite clueless

32:45.440 --> 32:47.320
 about all aspects of artificial intelligence,

32:47.320 --> 32:48.440
 the data collection, and so on.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.560
 It would be nice to change that for people

32:50.560 --> 32:52.800
 to understand the good that AI can do.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.560
 And it's not some system that's trying to steal

32:56.560 --> 32:58.760
 all the most sensitive data.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.640
 Do you think, do you dream of a Roomba

33:02.640 --> 33:05.280
 with human level intelligence one day?

33:05.280 --> 33:10.520
 So you've mentioned a very successful localization

33:10.520 --> 33:12.160
 and mapping of the environment, being

33:12.160 --> 33:14.680
 able to do some basic communication to say,

33:14.680 --> 33:16.600
 go clean the kitchen.

33:16.600 --> 33:22.880
 Do you see in your maybe more bored moments,

33:22.880 --> 33:27.080
 once you get the beer, to sit back with that beer

33:27.080 --> 33:30.840
 and have a chat on a Friday night with a Roomba

33:30.840 --> 33:34.160
 about how your day went?

33:34.160 --> 33:38.640
 So to your latter question, absolutely.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.760
 To your former question as to whether a Roomba

33:40.760 --> 33:45.280
 can have human level intelligence, not in my lifetime.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.440
 You can have you.

33:46.440 --> 33:49.720
 I think you can have a great conversation,

33:49.720 --> 33:54.000
 a meaningful conversation with a Roomba

33:54.000 --> 33:56.320
 without it having anything that resembles

33:56.320 --> 33:59.200
 human level intelligence.

33:59.200 --> 34:04.000
 And I think that as long as you realize that conversation

34:04.000 --> 34:08.600
 is not about the robot and making the robot feel good.

34:08.600 --> 34:14.880
 That conversation is about you learning interesting things

34:14.880 --> 34:18.720
 that make you feel like the conversation that you

34:18.720 --> 34:24.840
 had with the robot is a pretty awesome way

34:24.840 --> 34:27.400
 of learning something.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.920
 And it could be about what kind of day your pet had.

34:30.920 --> 34:36.240
 It could be about how can I make my home more energy efficient.

34:36.240 --> 34:40.000
 It could be about if I'm thinking about climbing

34:40.000 --> 34:41.640
 Mount Everest, what should I know?

34:44.440 --> 34:48.640
 And that's a very doable thing.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.480
 But if I think that that conversation

34:51.480 --> 34:53.760
 I'm going to have with the robot is

34:53.760 --> 34:56.840
 I'm going to be rewarded by making the robot happy,

34:56.840 --> 34:58.720
 well, I could just put a button on the robot

34:58.720 --> 35:00.600
 that you could push and the robot would smile.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.200
 And that sort of thing.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.200
 So I think you need to think about the question

35:04.200 --> 35:06.720
 in the right way.

35:06.720 --> 35:12.680
 And robots can be awesomely effective at helping people

35:12.680 --> 35:16.320
 feel less isolated, learn more about the home

35:16.320 --> 35:21.960
 that they live in, and fill some of those lonely gaps

35:21.960 --> 35:24.320
 that we wish we were engaged learning

35:24.320 --> 35:26.640
 cool stuff about our world.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.800
 Last question.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.280
 If you could hang out for a day with a robot

35:32.280 --> 35:35.760
 from science fiction, movies, books,

35:35.760 --> 35:42.080
 and safely pick its brain for that day, who would you pick?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.320
 Data.

35:43.320 --> 35:43.880
 Data.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.280
 From Star Trek.

35:45.280 --> 35:49.600
 I think that A, data is really smart.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.440
 Data has been through a lot trying

35:51.440 --> 35:53.520
 to go and save the galaxy.

35:53.520 --> 35:59.600
 And I'm really interested actually in emotion

35:59.600 --> 36:01.200
 and robotics.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.120
 And I think you'd have a lot to say about that.

36:03.120 --> 36:08.120
 Because I believe actually that emotion

36:08.120 --> 36:14.280
 plays an incredibly useful role in doing reasonable things

36:14.280 --> 36:16.920
 in situations where we have imperfect understanding of

36:16.920 --> 36:18.000
 what's going on.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.760
 In social situations when there's imperfect information.

36:20.760 --> 36:26.320
 In social situations, also in competitive or dangerous

36:26.320 --> 36:32.880
 situations that we have emotion for a reason.

36:32.880 --> 36:36.320
 And so that ultimately, my theory

36:36.320 --> 36:38.520
 is that as robots get smarter and smarter,

36:38.520 --> 36:41.400
 they're actually going to get more emotional.

36:41.400 --> 36:49.120
 Because you can't actually survive on pure logic.

36:49.120 --> 36:53.800
 Because only a very tiny fraction of the situations

36:53.800 --> 36:57.320
 we find ourselves in can be resolved reasonably with logic.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.600
 And so I think Data would have a lot to say about that.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.360
 And so I could find out whether he agrees.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.840
 If you could ask Data one question,

37:04.840 --> 37:08.560
 you would get a deep, honest answer to what would you ask.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.520
 What's Captain Picard really like?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.320
 OK, I think that's the perfect way to end it.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.040
 Colin, thank you so much for talking today.

37:16.040 --> 37:16.960
 I really appreciate it.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.120
 My pleasure.
