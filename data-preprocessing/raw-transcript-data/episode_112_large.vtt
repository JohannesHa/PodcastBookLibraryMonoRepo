00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
 The following is a conversation with Ian Hutchinson, a nuclear engineer and plasma physicist at MIT.

00:06.320 --> 00:12.080
 He has made a number of important contributions in plasma physics, including the magnetic confinement of plasmas,

00:12.080 --> 00:17.760
 seeking to enable fusion reactions, which happens to be the energy source of the stars,

00:17.760 --> 00:25.840
 to be used for practical energy production. Current nuclear reactors, by the way, are based on fission, as we discuss.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.400
 Ian has also written on the philosophy of science and the relationship between science and religion,

00:32.400 --> 00:41.440
 arguing in particular against scientism, which is a negative description of the overreach of the scientific method to questions not amenable to it.

00:41.440 --> 00:46.880
 On this latter topic, I recommend two of his books, his new one, Can a Scientist Believe in Miracles?,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.880
 where he answers more than 200 questions on all aspects of God and science,

00:50.880 --> 00:56.080
 and his earlier book on scientism called Monopolizing Knowledge.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.320
 As you may have seen already, I work hard on having an open mind, always questioning my assumptions,

01:02.320 --> 01:10.400
 and in general marvel at the immense mystery of everything around us and the limitations of at least my mind.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.680
 I'm not religious myself in that I don't go to the synagogue, a church, a mosque,

01:15.680 --> 01:21.360
 but I see the beautiful bond in the community that religion at its best can create.

01:21.360 --> 01:31.760
 I also see, both in scientist and religious leaders, signs of arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and a will to power.

01:31.760 --> 01:38.480
 We're human. Whether Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, agnostic, or atheist,

01:38.480 --> 01:43.280
 this podcast is my humble attempt to explore a complicated human nature.

01:43.280 --> 01:50.480
 What Stanislav Lem in his book Solaris called our own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers.

01:50.480 --> 01:57.600
 I ask that you try to keep an open mind as well and be patient with the limitations of mind.

01:57.600 --> 02:03.760

 but let me risk listing the actual menu items that I ordered because they sound delicious.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.120
 Italian sausages and vegetable skewers with two romescos.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.880
 I don't actually know what romescos are, but the pictures looked awesome.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.200
 And pork fried cauliflower rice with carrots and peas.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.560

 And now here's my conversation with Ian Hutchinson.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.040
 Maybe it'd be nice to draw a distinction between nuclear physics and plasma physics.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
 What is the distinction?

05:39.040 --> 05:41.680
 Nuclear physics is about the physics of the nucleus.

05:41.680 --> 05:46.240
 And my department, Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT,

05:46.240 --> 05:54.240
 is very concerned about all the interactions and reactions and consequences of things that go on in the nucleus,

05:54.240 --> 05:59.440
 including nuclear energy, fission energy, which is the nuclear energy that we have already,

05:59.440 --> 06:03.760
 and fusion energy, which is the energy source of the sun and stars,

06:03.760 --> 06:12.000
 which we don't quite know how to turn into practical energy for humankind at the moment.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.720
 That's what my research has mostly been aimed at.

06:16.720 --> 06:22.880
 But plasmas are essentially the fourth state of matter.

06:22.880 --> 06:29.920
 So if you think about solid, liquid, gas, plasma is the fourth of those states of matter.

06:29.920 --> 06:36.160
 And it's actually the state of matter which one reaches if one raises the temperature.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.800
 So cold things, you know, like ice are solid.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.520
 Liquids are hotter water.

06:43.520 --> 06:48.720
 And if you heat water beyond 100 degrees Celsius, it becomes gas.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.520
 Well, that's true of most substances.

06:51.520 --> 07:01.920
 And plasma is a state of matter in which the electrons are unbound from the nuclei.

07:01.920 --> 07:06.080
 So they become separate from the nuclei and can move separately.

07:06.080 --> 07:12.160
 So we have positively charged nuclei and we have negatively charged electrons.

07:12.160 --> 07:17.680
 The net is still electrically neutral.

07:17.680 --> 07:25.200
 But a plasma conducts electricity, has all sorts of important properties that are associated

07:25.200 --> 07:27.120
 with that separation.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.280
 And that's what plasmas are all about.

07:29.280 --> 07:34.240
 And the reason why my department is interested in plasma physics very strongly is because

07:34.240 --> 07:37.920
 most things, well, for one thing, most things in the universe are plasma.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.480
 The vast majority of matter in the universe is plasma.

07:40.480 --> 07:48.880
 But most particularly, stars and the sun are plasmas because they're very hot.

07:48.880 --> 07:54.800
 And it's only in very hot states that nuclear fusion reactions take place.

07:54.800 --> 08:00.920
 And we want to understand how to implement those kind of phenomena on Earth.

08:00.920 --> 08:05.040
 Maybe another distinction we want to try to get at is the difference between fission

08:05.040 --> 08:06.040
 and fusion.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.080
 So you mentioned fusion is the kind of reaction happening in the sun.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.200
 So what's fission and what's fusion?

08:11.200 --> 08:18.400
 Well, fission is taking heavy elements like uranium and breaking them up.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.040
 And it turns out that that process of breaking up heavy elements releases energy.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.240
 What does it mean to be a heavy element?

08:25.240 --> 08:33.260
 It means that there are many nuclear particles in the nucleus itself, neutrons and protons

08:33.260 --> 08:42.480
 in the nucleus itself so that in the case of uranium, there are 92 protons in each nucleus

08:42.480 --> 08:49.920
 and even more neutrons so that the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, nucleons is short

08:49.920 --> 08:58.160
 for either a proton or a neutron, the total number might be 235, that's U235, or it might

08:58.160 --> 09:01.720
 be 238, that's U238.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.320
 So those are heavy elements.

09:03.320 --> 09:10.400
 Light elements, by contrast, have very few nucleons, protons or neutrons in the nucleus.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.840
 Hydrogen is the lightest nucleus.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.800
 It has one proton.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.480
 There are actually slightly heavier forms of hydrogen, isotopes.

09:19.480 --> 09:26.280
 Deuterium has a proton and a neutron and tritium has a proton and two neutrons.

09:26.280 --> 09:31.040
 So it has a total of three nucleons in the nucleus.

09:31.040 --> 09:38.520
 While taking light elements like isotopes of hydrogen and not breaking them up but actually

09:38.520 --> 09:45.680
 fusing them together, reacting them together to produce heavier elements, typically helium,

09:45.680 --> 09:52.680
 which is helium is a nucleus which has two protons and two neutrons, that also releases

09:52.680 --> 10:00.120
 energy and that or reactions like that, making heavier elements from lighter elements is

10:00.120 --> 10:05.160
 what mostly powers the sun and stars.

10:05.160 --> 10:14.520
 Both fusion and fission release approximately a million times more energy per unit mass

10:14.520 --> 10:16.360
 than chemical reactions.

10:16.360 --> 10:22.040
 So a chemical reaction means take hydrogen, take oxygen, react them together, let's say,

10:22.040 --> 10:25.000
 and get water, that releases energy.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.600
 The energy released in a chemical reaction like that or the burning of coal or on oil

10:29.600 --> 10:35.940
 or whatever else is about a million times less per unit mass than what is released in

10:35.940 --> 10:37.460
 nuclear reactions.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.960
 So but it's hard to do.

10:38.960 --> 10:44.240
 It requires very high energy of impact.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.500
 And actually, it's very easy to understand why.

10:46.500 --> 10:52.360
 And that is that those two nuclei, if they're both, let's say, hydrogen nuclei, one is,

10:52.360 --> 10:58.160
 let's say, deuterium and the other is, let's say, tritium, they're both electrically charged.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.080
 And they're positively charged, so they like charges repel.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.620
 Everyone knows that, right?

11:03.620 --> 11:09.980
 So basically, to get them close enough together to react, you have to overcome the repulsion,

11:09.980 --> 11:15.800
 the electric repulsion of the two nuclei from one another.

11:15.800 --> 11:20.180
 And you have to get them extremely close to one another in order for the nuclear forces

11:20.180 --> 11:25.900
 to overtake the electrical forces and actually form a new nucleus.

11:25.900 --> 11:31.320
 And so one requires very high energies of impact in order for reactions to take place.

11:31.320 --> 11:37.940
 And those high energies of impact correspond to very high temperatures of random motion.

11:37.940 --> 11:41.000
 So that's why you can do something like that in the sun.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.660
 So we can build the sun.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.740
 That's one way to do it.

11:43.740 --> 11:47.260
 But on Earth, how do you create a fusion reaction?

11:47.260 --> 11:48.260
 Yeah.

11:48.260 --> 11:49.260
 Well, nature's.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.260
 Engineering wise.

11:50.260 --> 12:00.960
 Nature's fusion reactors are indeed the stars, and they are very hot in the center.

12:00.960 --> 12:07.080
 And they reach the point where they release more energy from those reactions than they

12:07.080 --> 12:10.920
 lose by radiation and transport to the surface and so forth.

12:10.920 --> 12:15.740
 And that's a state of ignition.

12:15.740 --> 12:19.340
 And that's what we have to achieve to give net energy.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.220
 That's like lighting a fire.

12:21.220 --> 12:27.100
 If you have a bundle of sticks and you hold a match up to it and you see smoke coming

12:27.100 --> 12:33.980
 from the sticks, but you take the match away and the sticks just fizzle out.

12:33.980 --> 12:38.060
 That's not the reason they fizzled out is that, yes, they were burning, there was smoke

12:38.060 --> 12:41.300
 coming from them, but they were not ignited.

12:41.300 --> 12:45.700
 But if you are able to take the match away and they keep burning and they are generating

12:45.700 --> 12:51.700
 enough heat to keep themselves hot and hence keep the reactions going, that's chemical

12:51.700 --> 12:52.700
 ignition.

12:52.700 --> 13:00.140
 But what we need to do, what the stars do in order to generate nuclear fusion energy

13:00.140 --> 13:02.460
 is they are ignited.

13:02.460 --> 13:08.180
 They are generated enough energy to keep themselves hot.

13:08.180 --> 13:13.700
 And that's what we've got to do on Earth if we're going to make fusion work on Earth.

13:13.700 --> 13:22.560
 But it's much harder to do on Earth than it is in a star because we need temperatures

13:22.560 --> 13:31.140
 of order tens of millions of degrees Celsius in order for the reactions to go fast enough

13:31.140 --> 13:37.580
 to generate enough energy to keep it going.

13:37.580 --> 13:44.220
 And so if you've got something that's tens of millions of degrees Celsius and you want

13:44.220 --> 13:48.580
 to keep it all together and keep the heat in long enough to have enough reactions taking

13:48.580 --> 13:57.400
 place, you can't just put it in a bottle, plastic or glass, it would be gone in milliseconds.

13:57.400 --> 14:05.340
 So you have to have some nonmaterial mechanism of confining the plasma.

14:05.340 --> 14:10.940
 In the case of stars, that nonmaterial force is gravity.

14:10.940 --> 14:16.180
 So gravity is what holds the star together, it's what holds the plasma in long enough

14:16.180 --> 14:22.640
 for it to react and sustain itself by the fusion reactions.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.580
 But on Earth, gravity is extremely weak.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.420
 I mean, I don't mean to say we don't fall, yes, we fall.

14:27.420 --> 14:35.700
 But the mutual gravitational attraction of small objects is very weak compared with the

14:35.700 --> 14:40.300
 electrical repulsion or any other force that you can think about on Earth.

14:40.300 --> 14:48.020
 And so we need a stronger force to keep the plasma together, to confine it.

14:48.020 --> 14:55.460
 And the predominant attempt at making fusion work on Earth is to use magnetic fields to

14:55.460 --> 14:57.460
 confine the plasma.

14:57.460 --> 15:03.580
 And that's what I've worked on for much, essentially most of my career, is to understand how we

15:03.580 --> 15:11.880
 can and how best we can confine these incredibly hot gases, plasmas, using magnetic fields

15:11.880 --> 15:18.740
 with the ultimate objective of releasing fusion energy on Earth and generating electricity

15:18.740 --> 15:21.780
 with it and powering our society with it.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.540
 A dumb question.

15:23.540 --> 15:28.460
 So on top of the magnetic fields, do you also need the plastic water bottle walls or is

15:28.460 --> 15:30.340
 it purely magnetic fields?

15:30.340 --> 15:36.780
 Well, actually what we do need walls, those walls must be kept away from the plasma because

15:36.780 --> 15:42.340
 otherwise they'd be melted or the plasma must be kept away from them inside of them.

15:42.340 --> 15:48.460
 But the main purpose of the walls is not to keep the plasma in, it's to keep the atmosphere

15:48.460 --> 15:50.300
 out.

15:50.300 --> 15:56.380
 So if we want to do it on Earth where there's air, we want the plasma to consist of hydrogen

15:56.380 --> 15:59.740
 isotopes or other things, the things we're trying to react.

15:59.740 --> 16:06.300
 And by the way, the density of those plasmas, at least in magnetic confinement fusion, is

16:06.300 --> 16:07.300
 very low.

16:07.300 --> 16:13.740
 It's maybe a million times less than the density of air in this room.

16:13.740 --> 16:19.260
 So in order for a fusion reactor like that to work, you have to keep all of the air out

16:19.260 --> 16:20.620
 and just keep the plasma in.

16:20.620 --> 16:24.300
 So yes, there are other things, but those are things that are relatively easy.

16:24.300 --> 16:29.180
 I mean, making a vacuum these days is technologically quite straightforward.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.500
 We know how to do that.

16:31.500 --> 16:38.540
 What we don't quite know how to do is to make a confinement device that isolates the plasma

16:38.540 --> 16:43.900
 well enough so that it's able to keep itself burning with its own reaction.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.420
 So maybe can you talk about what a tokamak is?

16:47.420 --> 16:54.060
 The Russian acronym from which the word tokamak is built just means toroidal magnetic chamber.

16:54.060 --> 17:00.700
 So it's a toroidal chamber, a torus is a geometric shape which is like a doughnut with a hole

17:00.700 --> 17:02.740
 down the middle.

17:02.740 --> 17:10.640
 And so it's the meat of the doughnut, that's the torus, and it's got a magnetic field.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.320
 So that's really all tokamak means.

17:13.320 --> 17:22.180
 But the particular configuration that is very widespread and is the sort of best prospect

17:22.180 --> 17:28.100
 in the least in the near term for making fusion energy work is one in which there's a very

17:28.100 --> 17:35.940
 strong magnetic field the long way around the doughnut, around the torus.

17:35.940 --> 17:40.280
 So you've got to imagine that there's this doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic field

17:40.280 --> 17:43.300
 just going round and round the long way.

17:43.300 --> 17:53.300
 The big advantage of that is that plasma particles when they're in the presence of a magnetic

17:53.300 --> 17:59.780
 field feel strong forces from the magnetic field and those forces make the particles

17:59.780 --> 18:04.360
 gyrate around the direction of the magnetic field line.

18:04.360 --> 18:12.320
 So basically the particles follow helical orbits following like a spring that's directed

18:12.320 --> 18:13.980
 along the magnetic field.

18:13.980 --> 18:18.640
 Well if you make the magnetic field go inside this toroidal chamber and just simply go round

18:18.640 --> 18:27.840
 and round the chamber then because of this helical orbit the particles can't move fast

18:27.840 --> 18:33.920
 across the magnetic field but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.680
 And if you have a magnetic field that doesn't leave the chamber it doesn't matter if they

18:38.680 --> 18:44.260
 move along the magnetic field it doesn't mean they're going to exit the chamber.

18:44.260 --> 18:52.440
 But if you just had a straight magnetic field for example coming from a Helmholtz coil or

18:52.440 --> 18:57.800
 a bar magnet then you'd have to have ends that would come to the ends of the chamber

18:57.800 --> 19:02.960
 somewhere and the particles would hit the ends and they would lose their energy.

19:02.960 --> 19:07.460
 So that's why it's toroidal and that's why we have a strong magnetic field.

19:07.460 --> 19:14.840
 It's providing a confinement against motion in the in the direction that would lead the

19:14.840 --> 19:16.960
 particles to leave the chamber.

19:16.960 --> 19:21.580
 It turns out that here we're getting a little bit technical but turns out that a toroidal

19:21.580 --> 19:27.680
 field alone is not enough and so you need more fields to produce true true confinement

19:27.680 --> 19:32.720
 of plasma and we get those by passing a current as well through the plasma itself.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.840
 I can make sure it stays on track.

19:34.840 --> 19:40.800
 Well that what that does is makes the field lines themselves into much bigger helices

19:40.800 --> 19:47.560
 and that for reasons that are too complicated to explain that clinches the confinement of

19:47.560 --> 19:53.400
 the particles at least in terms of their single particle orbits so they don't leave the chamber.

19:53.400 --> 20:00.480
 So when the particles are flying along this this this donut the inside of the donut are

20:00.480 --> 20:03.960
 they what's where's the generation of the energy coming from?

20:03.960 --> 20:07.480
 Are they smashing into each other?

20:07.480 --> 20:12.520
 Yeah eventually I mean in a fusion reactor there will be deuterons and tritons and they

20:12.520 --> 20:13.800
 will be smashing in.

20:13.800 --> 20:19.080
 They will be very hot there'll be a hundred million degrees Celsius or something so they're

20:19.080 --> 20:24.960
 moving thermally with very large thermal energies in random directions and they will collide

20:24.960 --> 20:28.400
 with one another and have fusion reactions.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.080
 When those fusion reactions take place energy is released large amounts of energy is released

20:33.080 --> 20:35.260
 in the form of particles.

20:35.260 --> 20:39.060
 One of the particles that's released is an alpha particle which is also charged and it's

20:39.060 --> 20:45.120
 also confined and that alpha particle stays in the in the in the donut and heats the other

20:45.120 --> 20:49.720
 particles that are in that donut so it transfers its energy to those and they it keeps them

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
 hot.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.880
 There are there's some leaking of heat all the time a little bit of radiation some transport

20:54.880 --> 20:56.320
 and so forth.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.440
 There's also a neutron released from that reaction the neutron carries out four fifths

21:00.440 --> 21:06.240
 of the fusion energy and that will have to be captured in a blanket that surrounds the

21:06.240 --> 21:17.600
 chamber in which we take the energy drive some kind of electrical generator from you

21:17.600 --> 21:25.320
 know thermal thermal engine gas turbine or something like that and power the power.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.480
 You got energy.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.200
 So where do we stand?

21:28.200 --> 21:29.200
 Where do we stand?

21:29.200 --> 21:35.440
 I'm getting this thing to be something that actually works that generates energy.

21:35.440 --> 21:42.200
 Well there have been experiments that have generated net nuclear energies or nuclear

21:42.200 --> 21:49.720
 powers in the vicinity of you know a few tens of megawatts for a few seconds.

21:49.720 --> 21:56.360
 So that's you know 10 megajoules that's not much energy it's a few donuts worth of energy

21:56.360 --> 21:57.360
 okay.

21:57.360 --> 22:02.600
 A literal donut.

22:02.600 --> 22:11.120
 But we have studied how well tokamaks can find plasmas and so we now understand in rather

22:11.120 --> 22:19.160
 great detail the way they work and we're able to predict what is going to be required in

22:19.160 --> 22:24.680
 order to build a tokamak that becomes self sustaining that becomes essentially ignited

22:24.680 --> 22:29.560
 or very so close to ignited that it doesn't matter.

22:29.560 --> 22:38.160
 And at the moment at least if you use the modest magnetic field values still very strong

22:38.160 --> 22:44.720
 but limited magnetic field values you have to build a very big device.

22:44.720 --> 22:53.300
 And so we are at the moment worldwide fusion research is at the moment in the process of

22:53.300 --> 22:58.080
 building a very big experiment that's located in the south of France.

22:58.080 --> 23:04.460
 It's called ITER which means the way or just means the international tokamak experimental

23:04.460 --> 23:08.440
 reactor if you like.

23:08.440 --> 23:14.720
 And that experiment is designed to reach this burning plasma state and to generate about

23:14.720 --> 23:21.360
 500 megawatts of fusion power for hundreds of seconds at a time.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.400
 It'll still only be an experiment.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.480
 It won't put electricity on the grid or anything like that.

23:28.480 --> 23:34.400
 It's to figure out whether it works and what the remaining engineering challenges are.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.200
 It's a scientific experiment.

23:36.200 --> 23:41.440
 It won't be engineered to run round the clock and so on and so forth which ultimately one

23:41.440 --> 23:46.260
 needs to do in order to make something that's practical for generating electricity.

23:46.260 --> 23:53.960
 But it will be the first demonstration on earth of a controlled fusion reaction for

23:53.960 --> 23:55.280
 you know long time periods.

23:55.280 --> 23:59.000
 Is that exciting to you?

23:59.000 --> 24:05.400
 It's been an objective that is in many ways motivated my entire career and the career

24:05.400 --> 24:09.960
 of many people like me in the field.

24:09.960 --> 24:15.640
 I have to admit though that one of the problems with ITER is that it's an extremely big and

24:15.640 --> 24:23.760
 expensive and long time to build experiment and so it won't even come into operation until

24:23.760 --> 24:31.200
 about 2025 even though it's been being built for 10 years and it was designed for 30 years

24:31.200 --> 24:33.860
 before that.

24:33.860 --> 24:40.520
 And so that's actually one of the big disappointments of my career in a certain sense which is that

24:40.520 --> 24:47.480
 we won't get to burning fusion reaction until well past the first operation of ITER and

24:47.480 --> 24:52.560
 whether I'm alive or not I don't know but I certainly will be well and truly retired

24:52.560 --> 24:54.480
 by the time that happens.

24:54.480 --> 24:59.920
 And so when I realized maybe some years ago that that was going to be the case it was

24:59.920 --> 25:03.520
 a discouragement to me let's put it like that.

25:03.520 --> 25:09.760
 But if we can try to look maybe in a ridiculous kind of way look into a hundred years from

25:09.760 --> 25:14.520
 now two hundred years five hundred years from now and we you know there's folks like Elon

25:14.520 --> 25:18.640
 Musk trying to travel outside the solar system.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.640
 I mean the amount of energy we need for some of the exciting things we want to do in this

25:22.640 --> 25:29.320
 world if we look again hundred years from now seems to be a very large amount.

25:29.320 --> 25:38.640
 So do you think fusion energy will eventually sometime into your retirement will be basically

25:38.640 --> 25:41.320
 behind most of the things we do?

25:41.320 --> 25:47.200
 Look I absolutely think that fusion research is completely justified.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.880
 In fact we should be spending more time and effort on it than we currently do.

25:51.880 --> 25:59.580
 But it isn't going to be a magic bullet that somehow solves all the problems of energy.

25:59.580 --> 26:04.240
 By the way that's a generic statement you can make about any energy source in my view.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.560
 I think it's a grave mistake to think that science of any sort is suddenly going to find

26:09.560 --> 26:13.840
 a magic bullet for meeting all the energy needs of society or any of the other needs

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
 of society by the way.

26:15.840 --> 26:21.280
 But and we can talk about that later.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.620
 But fusion is very worthwhile and we should be doing it.

26:25.620 --> 26:32.920
 And so my disappointment that I just expressed was in a certain sense of personal disappointment.

26:32.920 --> 26:36.600
 I do think that fusion energy is a terrific challenge.

26:36.600 --> 26:42.400
 It's very difficult to bring the energy source of the sun and stars down to earth.

26:42.400 --> 26:47.560
 This does contrast in a certain sense with fission energy.

26:47.560 --> 26:54.480
 By contrast fission energy efficient to build a fission reactor proved to be amazingly easy.

26:54.480 --> 27:00.900
 You know we did it within a few years of discovering nuclear fission.

27:00.900 --> 27:07.740
 People had figured out how to build a reactor and did so during the Second World War.

27:07.740 --> 27:11.920
 Which is by the way fission is how the current nuclear power plants work.

27:11.920 --> 27:21.520
 And so we have nuclear energy today because fission reactors are relatively easy to build.

27:21.520 --> 27:26.340
 What's hard is getting the materials and that's just as well because if everyone could get

27:26.340 --> 27:30.680
 those materials there would be weapons proliferation and so forth.

27:30.680 --> 27:38.360
 But it wasn't all that long after even the discovery of nuclear fission that fission

27:38.360 --> 27:44.160
 reactors were built and fission reactors of course operated before we had weapons.

27:44.160 --> 27:57.120
 So I think nuclear power is obviously important to meet the energy challenges of our age.

27:57.120 --> 28:04.080
 It is completely intrinsically completely CO2 emissions free.

28:04.080 --> 28:09.360
 And in fact the wastes that come from nuclear power whether it's fission or fusion for that

28:09.360 --> 28:18.240
 matter are so moderate in quantity that we shouldn't really be worried about them.

28:18.240 --> 28:23.540
 I mean yes fission products are highly radioactive and we need to keep them away from people

28:23.540 --> 28:27.360
 but there's so little of them it's that keeping them away from people is not particularly

28:27.360 --> 28:28.680
 difficult.

28:28.680 --> 28:36.160
 And so while people complain a lot about the drawbacks of fission energy I think most of

28:36.160 --> 28:39.160
 those complaints are ill informed.

28:39.160 --> 28:45.760
 We can talk about you know the challenges and the disasters if you like of fission reactors

28:45.760 --> 28:53.760
 but I think fission in the near term offers a terrific opportunity for environmentally

28:53.760 --> 28:59.320
 friendly energy which in the world as a whole is rapidly being taken advantage of.

28:59.320 --> 29:03.840
 You know China and India and places like that are rapidly building fission plants.

29:03.840 --> 29:08.000
 We're not rapidly building fission plants in the US although we are actually building

29:08.000 --> 29:12.200
 two at the moment, two new ones.

29:12.200 --> 29:17.200
 But we do still get 20 percent of our electricity from fission energy and we could get a lot

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
 more.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.680
 So it's clean energy.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.960
 So it's clean energy.

29:20.960 --> 29:28.640
 Now again the concern is there's a very popular HBO show and just came out on Chernobyl.

29:28.640 --> 29:32.480
 There's the Three Mile Island, there's Fukushima, that's the most recent disaster.

29:32.480 --> 29:37.560
 So there's a kind of a concern of yeah I mean nuclear disasters.

29:37.560 --> 29:42.280
 Is that, what do you make of that kind of concern especially if we look into the future

29:42.280 --> 29:44.880
 of fission energy based reactors?

29:44.880 --> 29:48.600
 Well first of all let me say one or two words about the contrast between fission and fusion

29:48.600 --> 29:53.160
 and then we'll come on to the question of the disasters and so forth.

29:53.160 --> 30:00.500
 Fission does have some drawbacks and they're largely to do with four main areas.

30:00.500 --> 30:06.960
 One is do we have enough uranium or other fissile fuels to supply our energy needs for

30:06.960 --> 30:08.040
 a long time?

30:08.040 --> 30:16.080
 The answer to that is we know we have enough uranium to support fission energy worldwide

30:16.080 --> 30:23.200
 for thousands of years but maybe not for millions of years okay.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.680
 So that's resources.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.120
 Secondly there are issues to do with wastes.

30:29.120 --> 30:36.600
 Fission wastes are highly radioactive and some of them are volatile and so for example

30:36.600 --> 30:44.840
 in Fukushima the problem was that some fraction of the fission wastes were volatilized and

30:44.840 --> 30:55.040
 went out as a cloud and polluted areas with cesium 137, strontium 90 and things like that.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.000
 So that's a challenge of fission.

30:58.000 --> 31:07.040
 There's a problem of safety beyond that and that is that in fission it's hard to turn

31:07.040 --> 31:09.040
 the reactor off.

31:09.040 --> 31:14.880
 When you stop the nuclear reactions there is still a lot of heat being liberated from

31:14.880 --> 31:20.600
 the fission products and that is actually what the problem was at Fukushima.

31:20.600 --> 31:27.920
 The Fukushima reactors were shut down the moment that the earthquake took place and

31:27.920 --> 31:29.920
 they were shut down safely.

31:29.920 --> 31:35.540
 What then happened after that at Fukushima was you know there was this enormous tidal

31:35.540 --> 31:45.960
 wave many tens of meters high that came through and destroyed the electricity grid feed to

31:45.960 --> 31:52.480
 the Fukushima reactors and their cooling was then turned off and it was the after heat

31:52.480 --> 31:57.840
 of the turned off reactors that eventually caused the problems that led to release.

31:57.840 --> 32:06.680
 And so that's a safety concern and then finally there's a problem of proliferation and that

32:06.680 --> 32:13.920
 is that fission reactors need fissile fuel and the technologies for producing and enriching

32:13.920 --> 32:24.200
 and so forth the fuels can be used by bad actors to generate the materials needed for

32:24.200 --> 32:27.240
 a nuclear weapon and that's a very serious concern.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.840
 So those are the four problems.

32:29.840 --> 32:34.440
 Fusion has major advantages in respect of all of those problems.

32:34.440 --> 32:45.900
 It has more longer term fuel resources, it has far more benign waste issues, the radioactivity

32:45.900 --> 32:51.340
 from fusion reactions is at least a hundred times less than it is from fission reactions.

32:51.340 --> 32:57.280
 It has essentially none of this after heat problem because it doesn't produce fission

32:57.280 --> 33:02.800
 products that are highly radioactive and generating their own heat when it's turned off.

33:02.800 --> 33:07.840
 In fact the hard part of fusion is turning it on not turning it off.

33:07.840 --> 33:15.320
 And finally you don't need the same fission technology to make fusion work and so it's

33:15.320 --> 33:19.360
 got terrific advantages from the point of view of proliferation control.

33:19.360 --> 33:28.360
 So those are the four main issues which make fusion seem attractive technologically because

33:28.360 --> 33:31.120
 they address some of the problems of fission energy.

33:31.120 --> 33:36.600
 I don't mean to say that fission energy is overwhelmingly problematic but clearly there

33:36.600 --> 33:41.920
 have been catastrophes associated with fission reactors.

33:41.920 --> 33:47.600
 Fukushima actually is I think in many ways are often overstated as a disaster because

33:47.600 --> 33:53.840
 after all nobody was killed by the reactors essentially, zero.

33:53.840 --> 34:02.280
 And that's in the context of a disaster and tsunami that killed between 15 and 20,000

34:02.280 --> 34:05.720
 people instantane more or less instantaneously.

34:05.720 --> 34:17.080
 So you know in the scale of risks one should take the view that in my estimation that fission

34:17.080 --> 34:19.560
 energy came out of that looking pretty good.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.560
 Okay.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.720
 Of course that's not the popular conception.

34:22.720 --> 34:23.720
 Okay.

34:23.720 --> 34:24.720
 Yes that's good.

34:24.720 --> 34:31.100
 I mean with a lot of things that threaten our well being we seem to be very bad users

34:31.100 --> 34:32.440
 of data.

34:32.440 --> 34:38.800
 We seem to be very scared of shock attacks and not at all scared of car accidents and

34:38.800 --> 34:40.520
 this kind of miscalculation.

34:40.520 --> 34:46.840
 And I think from everything I understand nuclear energy, fission based energy goes into that

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
 category.

34:47.840 --> 34:54.240
 It's one of the safest, one of the cleanest forms of energy and yet the PR, whoever does

34:54.240 --> 34:59.640
 the PR for nuclear energy has a hard job ahead of them at the moment.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.400
 Well I think part of that is their association with nuclear weapons because when you say

35:03.400 --> 35:07.600
 the word nuclear people don't instantly think about nuclear energy, they think about nuclear

35:07.600 --> 35:09.440
 weapons.

35:09.440 --> 35:14.320
 And so there is perhaps a natural tendency to do that.

35:14.320 --> 35:20.040
 But yes I agree with you, people are very poor at estimating risks and they react emotionally

35:20.040 --> 35:22.880
 not rationally in most of these situations.

35:22.880 --> 35:27.940
 Can we talk about nuclear weapons just for a little bit?

35:27.940 --> 35:33.200
 So fission is the kind of reaction that's central to the nuclear weapons we have today?

35:33.200 --> 35:35.240
 That's what sets them off.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.660
 That's what sets them off.

35:36.660 --> 35:41.220
 So if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe you can say how these different weapons work.

35:41.220 --> 35:47.320
 So the earliest nuclear weapons, the nuclear bombs that were dropped on Japan etc. etc.

35:47.320 --> 35:50.040
 were pure fission weapons.

35:50.040 --> 35:57.960
 They used enriched uranium or plutonium and their energy is essentially entirely derived

35:57.960 --> 36:00.880
 from fission reactions.

36:00.880 --> 36:09.840
 But it was early realized that more energy was available if one could somehow combine

36:09.840 --> 36:17.360
 a fission bomb with fusion reactions.

36:17.360 --> 36:26.880
 Because the fusion reactions give more energy per unit mass than fission reactions.

36:26.880 --> 36:31.640
 And this was called the super, you might have heard of the expression the super or more

36:31.640 --> 36:35.640
 simply hydrogen bombs.

36:35.640 --> 36:40.320
 Bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and the fusion reactions associated with them.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.840
 Like you said it's hard to turn on.

36:41.840 --> 36:47.600
 It's hard to turn on because you need very high temperatures and you need confinement

36:47.600 --> 36:50.920
 of that long enough for the reactions to take place.

36:50.920 --> 37:03.320
 And so a bomb actually, a thermonuclear bomb or a hydrogen bomb has essentially a chemical

37:03.320 --> 37:15.040
 implosion which then sets off a fission explosion which then sets off and compresses hydrogen

37:15.040 --> 37:22.000
 isotopes and other things, which I don't know because I've never had a security clearance.

37:22.000 --> 37:28.240
 So I can't betray any secrets about weapons because I've never been party to them because

37:28.240 --> 37:33.280
 I know a lot about this problem I can guess.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.600
 And sets off fusion reactions in the middle.

37:36.600 --> 37:41.700
 So that's basically it's that sequence of things which produce these enormous multi

37:41.700 --> 37:47.660
 megaton bombs that have very large yields.

37:47.660 --> 37:52.200
 And so fusion alone can't get you there.

37:52.200 --> 38:00.480
 It is actually possible to set off or to try to set off little fusion bombs alone without

38:00.480 --> 38:08.940
 the surrounding fission explosion and that is what is called laser fusion.

38:08.940 --> 38:17.880
 So another approach to fusion which actually is mostly researched in the weapons complex,

38:17.880 --> 38:24.760
 the national labs and so forth because it's more associated with the technologies of weapons

38:24.760 --> 38:26.080
 is inertial fusion.

38:26.080 --> 38:32.280
 So if you decide instead of trying to make your plasma just sit there in this Taurus

38:32.280 --> 38:37.480
 and in the tokamak and be controlled steady state with a magnetic field, if you're willing

38:37.480 --> 38:43.840
 to accept that I'll just set off an explosion and then I'll gather the energy from that

38:43.840 --> 38:49.720
 somehow I don't quite know how but let's not ask that question too much.

38:49.720 --> 38:58.440
 Then it is possible to imagine generating fusion alone explosions and the way you do

38:58.440 --> 39:06.160
 it is you take some small amount of deuterium tritium fuel you bombard it with energy from

39:06.160 --> 39:12.200
 all sides and this is what the lasers are used for extremely powerful at lasers which

39:12.200 --> 39:16.680
 compresses the pellet of fusion and heats it.

39:16.680 --> 39:21.220
 It compresses it to such a high density and temperature that the reactions take place

39:21.220 --> 39:25.680
 very very quickly and in fact they can take place so quickly that it's all over with before

39:25.680 --> 39:27.120
 the thing flies apart.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.120
 Wow.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.120
 And that is.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.120
 Heated up really fast.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.240
 That is inertial fusion okay.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.680
 Is that useful for energy generation for outside?

39:36.680 --> 39:41.560
 Not yet I mean there are those people who think it will be but you may have heard of

39:41.560 --> 39:46.920
 the big experiment called the National Ignition Facility which was built at Livermore starting

39:46.920 --> 39:53.320
 in the late 1990s and has been in operation since around about 2010.

39:53.320 --> 39:59.800
 It was designed with the claim that it would reach ignition fusion ignition in this pulsed

39:59.800 --> 40:04.940
 form where the reactions have got over with so quickly before the thing whole thing flies

40:04.940 --> 40:05.940
 apart.

40:05.940 --> 40:09.880
 It didn't actually reach ignition and it doesn't look as if it will although you know we never

40:09.880 --> 40:14.360
 know maybe people figure out how to make it work better.

40:14.360 --> 40:20.840
 But the answer is in principle it seems possible to reach ignition in this way maybe not with

40:20.840 --> 40:22.680
 that particular laser facility.

40:22.680 --> 40:31.580
 Are you surprised that we humans haven't destroyed ourselves given that we've invented such powerful

40:31.580 --> 40:33.080
 tools of destruction?

40:33.080 --> 40:39.200
 Like what do you make of the fact that for many decades we've had nuclear weapons now

40:39.200 --> 40:44.280
 speaking about estimating risk at least to me it's exceptionally surprising I was born

40:44.280 --> 40:53.360
 in the Soviet Union that big egos of the big leaders when rubbing up against each other

40:53.360 --> 40:59.880
 have not created the kind of destruction everybody was afraid of for decades.

40:59.880 --> 41:03.960
 Well I must say I'm extremely thankful that it hasn't I don't know whether I'm surprised

41:03.960 --> 41:09.800
 about it I've never thought about it and from the point of view of is it surprising that

41:09.800 --> 41:14.360
 we've we've avoided it I'm just very thankful that we have I think that there is a sense

41:14.360 --> 41:22.040
 in which cooler heads have prevailed at crucial moments I think there is also a sense in which

41:22.040 --> 41:30.800
 you know mutually assured destruction has in fact worked as a policy to restrain the

41:30.800 --> 41:38.560
 great powers from going to war and in fact you know the the the fact that we haven't

41:38.560 --> 41:49.680
 had a world war you know since the 1940s is perhaps even attributable to nuclear weapons

41:49.680 --> 41:59.220
 in a kind of strange and peculiar way but I think humans are deeply flawed and sinful

41:59.220 --> 42:06.540
 people and I certainly don't feel that we're guaranteed that it's going to go on like this.

42:06.540 --> 42:12.280
 And we'll talk about the sort of the biggest picture view of it all but let me just ask

42:12.280 --> 42:18.320
 in terms of your worries of if we look a hundred years from now we're in the middle of what

42:18.320 --> 42:26.160
 is now a natural pandemic that from the looks of it as fortunately as not as bad as it could

42:26.160 --> 42:30.960
 possibly been if you look at the Spanish flu if you look at the history of pandemics if

42:30.960 --> 42:35.400
 you look at all the possible pandemics that could have been that folks like Bill Gates

42:35.400 --> 42:42.840
 are exceptionally terrified about we've I know many people are suffering but it's better

42:42.840 --> 42:48.320
 than it could have been so and now we're talking about nuclear weapons in terms of existential

42:48.320 --> 42:58.440
 threats to us as sinful humans what worries you the most is it nuclear weapons is is it

42:58.440 --> 43:05.280
 natural pandemics engineered pandemics nanotechnology in my field of artificial intelligence some

43:05.280 --> 43:12.440
 people are afraid of killer robots and robots yeah is there do you think in those existential

43:12.440 --> 43:21.680
 terms and do any aspect to any of those things were you I am certainly not confident that

43:21.680 --> 43:29.600
 my children and grandchildren will experience the benefits of civilization that I have enjoyed

43:29.600 --> 43:37.240
 I think it's possible for our civilizations to break down catastrophically I also think

43:37.240 --> 43:44.160
 that it's possible for our civilizations to break down progressively and I think they

43:44.160 --> 43:50.760
 will if we continue to have the explosion of population on the planet that we currently

43:50.760 --> 43:58.640
 have I mean it's it's quite it's quite wrong to think of our problems as mostly being co2

43:58.640 --> 44:05.000
 if we can just solve co2 then we can go on having this you know continually expanding

44:05.000 --> 44:10.960
 economy everywhere in the world of course you can't do that okay I mean there is a finite

44:10.960 --> 44:16.320
 you know bearing capacity of our planet on the resources of our planet on the resources

44:16.320 --> 44:21.480
 of our planet and and we can't continue to do that so I think there are lots of technical

44:21.480 --> 44:32.080
 reasons why a continually expanding economy and and and civilization is impossible and

44:32.080 --> 44:37.560
 therefore actually I'm as much nervous about the fact that our population is eight billion

44:37.560 --> 44:44.680
 or something right now worldwide as I am about the fact that you know a few million people

44:44.680 --> 44:51.380
 would be would be killed by COVID 19 I mean I don't want to be callous about this but

44:51.380 --> 44:57.840
 from the big picture it seems like that's much more of a problem over population people

44:57.840 --> 45:05.680
 not dying is ultimately more of a problem than people dying so you know that probably

45:05.680 --> 45:11.780
 sounds incredibly callous to your listeners but I think it's simply you know a sober assessment

45:11.780 --> 45:18.840
 of the situation is there is there ways from the way those eight billion or seven billion

45:18.840 --> 45:24.800
 or whatever the number is live that could make it sustainable you know because you've

45:24.800 --> 45:29.720
 kind of implied there's a kind of we have especially in the West this kind of capitalist

45:29.720 --> 45:36.880
 view of really consuming a lot of resources is there a way to like if you could change

45:36.880 --> 45:43.440
 one thing or a few things what would you change to make this life make it more likely that

45:43.440 --> 45:50.520
 your grandchildren have a better life than you well okay so let's talk a bit about energy

45:50.520 --> 45:55.680
 because that's something I know a lot a lot about having thought about it most of my career

45:55.680 --> 46:02.580
 in order to reach steady state co2 level okay that's acceptable in terms of global climate

46:02.580 --> 46:10.960
 change and so on and so forth we need to reduce our carbon emissions by at least a factor

46:10.960 --> 46:21.240
 of ten worldwide okay what's more you know the average energy consumption and hence co2

46:21.240 --> 46:28.720
 emission of people in the world is less than a tenth of what we per capita of them what

46:28.720 --> 46:35.280
 we have in the West in America and Europe and so forth so if you have in mind some utopia

46:35.280 --> 46:43.280
 in the future where we've reached a sustainable use of energy and we've also reached a situation

46:43.280 --> 46:50.080
 in which there is far less inequity in the world in the sense that people have share

46:50.080 --> 46:58.000
 the energy resources more uniformly then what that is equivalent to would be to reduce the

46:58.000 --> 47:05.120
 co2 emissions in Western economies not by a factor of ten but by a factor of a hundred

47:05.120 --> 47:10.520
 in other words has to go down to one percent of what it is now okay so you know when people

47:10.520 --> 47:16.440
 talk about you know let's use natural gas because you know maybe it only uses sixty

47:16.440 --> 47:21.600
 percent of the energy of coal it's complete nonsense that's not not even scratching the

47:21.600 --> 47:30.440
 surface of what we would need to do so you know is that going to be feasible I very much

47:30.440 --> 47:40.640
 doubt it and therefore I actually doubt that we can reach a level of energy of fossil energy

47:40.640 --> 47:47.340
 use that is one percent of the current use in the West without totally dramatic changes

47:47.340 --> 47:53.600
 either in you know our society our use of of energy and so forth which actually of course

47:53.600 --> 47:58.160
 is much of that energy is used for producing food and so on and so forth so it's actually

47:58.160 --> 48:03.520
 not so obvious that we can we can get we can cut down our energy usage by that factor or

48:03.520 --> 48:09.800
 we've got to reduce the human population so you run up against that number that's increasing

48:09.800 --> 48:17.680
 still and you don't think that could be it's not it's not that it's not it's not depressing

48:17.680 --> 48:28.600
 it's it's difficult like many truths are do you have a hope that there could be a technological

48:28.600 --> 48:37.120
 solution in short no there is no technological solution to for example for population control

48:37.120 --> 48:41.920
 I mean we have the technology just you know to prevent ourselves bearing children that's

48:41.920 --> 48:49.880
 not a problem technology is in okay solved the challenge is society the challenge is

48:49.880 --> 48:57.160
 human choices the challenge is almost entirely human and sociological not technology not

48:57.160 --> 49:01.480
 technology and when people thought talk about energy they thought they think that there's

49:01.480 --> 49:06.720
 some kind of technological magic bullet for this but there isn't okay and and there isn't

49:06.720 --> 49:10.280
 for the reasons I just mentioned not because it's obvious there isn't but actually there

49:10.280 --> 49:18.080
 isn't and and in in any case that it's true of energy it's true of pollution it's true

49:18.080 --> 49:25.040
 of human population it's true of most of the big challenges in our society are not scientific

49:25.040 --> 49:32.320
 or technological challenges they're human sociological challenges and that's why I think

49:32.320 --> 49:38.440
 it's a terrible mistake even for folks like me who work at you know well the high temple

49:38.440 --> 49:45.160
 of science and technology in in America and maybe in the galaxy yeah I mean you know it's

49:45.160 --> 49:52.760
 it's MIT it's at MIT best university in the world it's it's a terrible mistake if we give

49:52.760 --> 49:57.760
 the impression that technology is going to solve it all technology will make tremendous

49:57.760 --> 50:04.200
 contributions and I think it's it's worth working on it but it's a disaster if you think

50:04.200 --> 50:09.040
 it's going to solve all of our problems and and actually you know I've written a whole

50:09.040 --> 50:15.300
 book about the question of of scientism and the and the over emphasis on science both

50:15.300 --> 50:20.840
 as a way of of solving problems through technology but also as a way of gaining knowledge I think

50:20.840 --> 50:27.560
 it's not all the knowledge there is either yeah I think that book and your journey there

50:27.560 --> 50:33.120
 is fascinating so maybe you can go there can can you tell me about your on a personal side

50:33.120 --> 50:39.600
 your the personal journey of your faith of Christianity and your relationship with with

50:39.600 --> 50:46.080
 God with religion in general yeah in my in my latest book Can a Scientist Believe in

50:46.080 --> 50:52.300
 Miracles I I give a first I devote most of the first chapter to telling how how I became

50:52.300 --> 50:58.280
 a Christian why I became a Christian I I didn't grow up as a Christian which is fascinating

50:58.280 --> 51:02.940
 I mean you didn't grow up as a Christian so you you've discovered the beauty of God and

51:02.940 --> 51:07.960
 physics at the same time concurrent that's a very poetic way of putting it but yes I

51:07.960 --> 51:13.440
 would accept that I became a Christian when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge University

51:13.440 --> 51:18.900
 I I had you know I had gone to a school in which there was religion kind of was part

51:18.900 --> 51:25.040
 of the society there were prayers and at the at the at the daily you know gathering of

51:25.040 --> 51:30.240
 the of the students of the assembly of the students but I but I didn't really believe

51:30.240 --> 51:34.800
 it I just sort of went along with it and it wasn't particularly you know aggressive or

51:34.800 --> 51:41.160
 benign you know benign it just sort of was there but I didn't believe it I didn't didn't

51:41.160 --> 51:45.560
 make much sense to me but when I but I came across Christians from time to time and when

51:45.560 --> 51:54.120
 I went to Cambridge University two of my closest friends turned out were Christians and I think

51:54.120 --> 52:03.240
 it was that was the most important influence on me that that here were two people who were

52:03.240 --> 52:11.440
 really smart like me I'm giving you my yeah my impressions the way I the way I felt at

52:11.440 --> 52:21.560
 the time and and they thought Christianity made sense and and you know testified to its

52:21.560 --> 52:28.120
 significance in their lives and so that was a very important influence on me and I and

52:28.120 --> 52:34.480
 ultimately I mean the reason I I hadn't I hadn't I didn't see Christianity as some

52:34.480 --> 52:38.880
 kind of great evil the way it's sometimes portrayed by the by the radical atheists of

52:38.880 --> 52:43.880
 this century I mean I think that's nonsense but but but I so I think there were certain

52:43.880 --> 52:48.000
 attractive things if you go to a university like Cambridge you know you're surrounded

52:48.000 --> 52:55.240
 by by by Western culture you know from from about you know the 15th century onwards and

52:55.240 --> 53:03.160
 that saturated with Christian art and architecture and so forth and so it's hard it's hard not

53:03.160 --> 53:09.800
 to recognize that Christianity is in fact the foundation of Western society in Western

53:09.800 --> 53:17.880
 culture most Western civilization so so I mean maybe I was in that sense favorably disposed

53:17.880 --> 53:22.600
 towards Christianity as a religion but as a personal faith it didn't mean anything

53:22.600 --> 53:30.320
 to me but I became convinced really of two things one is that the evidence for the resurrection

53:30.320 --> 53:35.440
 of Jesus Christ is actually rather good I mean it's not a proof it's not kind of some

53:35.440 --> 53:40.120
 some kind of scientific demonstrate or mathematical demonstration but it's actually extremely

53:40.120 --> 53:44.520
 good it's not scientific evidence by and large it's historical evidence historical evidence

53:44.520 --> 53:51.360
 yeah so that was one thing and the other thing that came to me when I was at Cambridge it

53:51.360 --> 54:01.520
 became clear that Christianity ultimately is not you know some kind of moral theory

54:01.520 --> 54:08.760
 or philosophy or something like that it is or elite or at least it claims to be a personal

54:08.760 --> 54:14.880
 relationship with God which is made possible you know by what Jesus did and on the cross

54:14.880 --> 54:21.440
 and his life and his teaching and and it's a personal call to a relationship with God

54:21.440 --> 54:26.920
 and that had I'd never thought of it in those terms when I was you know when I was younger

54:26.920 --> 54:33.760
 and that that thought became attractive to me I mean I think most people find the person

54:33.760 --> 54:39.380
 of Christ and just teachings you know compelling insert in a certain sense what do you mean

54:39.380 --> 54:44.840
 by personal do you mean personal for you like a relationship like it's a meditative

54:44.840 --> 54:52.640
 like you specifically you Ian have a connection with God and and then the other side you say

54:52.640 --> 54:59.000
 personal with the actual body the person of Jesus Christ so all of those things what do

54:59.000 --> 55:05.240
 you mean by personal connection and why that was well so as I'm sorry for the stupid questions

55:05.240 --> 55:11.200
 no it's okay no problem as a Christian I believe that I have a relationship with God which

55:11.200 --> 55:18.360
 is best expressed by saying that it's personal and that comes about because you know Jesus

55:18.360 --> 55:31.000
 through his acts has reconciled me with God me a sinner me someone full of sins of failings

55:31.000 --> 55:36.360
 of ways in which I don't live up to even my own ideals let alone the ideals of a holy

55:36.360 --> 55:47.120
 God have been reconciled to the creator of everything and and so Christians myself included

55:47.120 --> 55:53.040
 believe that prayer is in a certain sense a connection with God and there are times

55:53.040 --> 55:59.000
 when I have felt you know that God spoke to me I don't mean necessarily orally in words

55:59.000 --> 56:09.380
 but showed me things or enlighten me or inspired me in ways that I I attribute to him so I

56:09.380 --> 56:17.120
 see it as a as a two way you know relationship in a certain sense of course it's a very asymmetrical

56:17.120 --> 56:21.880
 relationship but nevertheless Christians think that it's a two way it's a two way street

56:21.880 --> 56:28.000
 we're not just talking into the air when we say we won't I'm going to pray for someone

56:28.000 --> 56:33.960
 in this two way communication is there a way that you could try to describe on a podcast

56:33.960 --> 56:46.120
 what is God what is God like in your view if you try to describe is it a force is it

56:46.120 --> 56:53.200
 a set is it a for you intellectually is a set of metaphors that you use to reason about

56:53.200 --> 57:02.040
 the world is it is it is it kind of a computer that does some computation that's the infinitely

57:02.040 --> 57:08.320
 powerful computer or is it like Santa Claus a guy with a with a beard on the cloud like

57:08.320 --> 57:15.480
 I don't mean I don't mean what God actually is I mean in your limited cognitive capacity

57:15.480 --> 57:21.120
 as a human what do you actually what do you find helpful for thinking of what God actually

57:21.120 --> 57:27.040
 looks like what is God well let me start by saying none of the above okay I mean clearly

57:27.040 --> 57:37.400
 God in the Christian God the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob etc it is is not any of those

57:37.400 --> 57:45.100
 things because all of those things you just mentioned are phenomena or or or entities

57:45.100 --> 57:52.800
 in the created world and the most fundamental thing about monotheism as you know Abraham

57:52.800 --> 58:00.640
 and Moses and so forth handed it down is that God is not an entity within the creation within

58:00.640 --> 58:06.280
 the universe that God is the creator of it all and that's what Genesis first two chapters

58:06.280 --> 58:11.880
 of Genesis is really about is it's not it's not about telling us you know how God created

58:11.880 --> 58:18.260
 the world it's about telling us and telling the early Hebrews that God created the world

58:18.260 --> 58:23.360
 okay and that therefore he is not you know simply an entity within it on the other hand

58:23.360 --> 58:31.120
 you know our finite minds have a pretty hard time encompassing that so so one has to therefore

58:31.120 --> 58:38.700
 work in terms of metaphors and images and and so forth and I think we would know very

58:38.700 --> 58:47.200
 little about who God is if we if it was simply up if we were simply left to our own devices

58:47.200 --> 58:51.600
 you know if if we were just you know here you are you're in the universe try to figure

58:51.600 --> 58:56.800
 out who made it and and so forth well you know philosophers think they can do a little

58:56.800 --> 59:03.600
 bit of that maybe and theologians think that they can do a little bit more but but Christians

59:03.600 --> 59:11.720
 think that God has actually helped us along a lot by revealing himself and and we say

59:11.720 --> 59:18.020
 that he's revealed himself supremely in the person of Jesus Christ and so you know when

59:18.020 --> 59:25.200
 Jesus says to his disciples if you've seen me you've seen the Father then that is in

59:25.200 --> 59:31.800
 a certain sense a watchword for answering this question for Christians it is that supremely

59:31.800 --> 59:37.800
 if we want to help ourselves understand who God really is we look to Jesus we look to

59:37.800 --> 59:48.680
 what he did we look to what he said and so forth and we believe that he is one with the

59:48.680 --> 59:53.720
 Father and that's why we believe you know in the Trinity I mean it's basically because

59:53.720 --> 1:00:01.700
 that revelation is extremely central to Christian belief and teaching so in that in that sense

1:00:01.700 --> 1:00:07.520
 through Jesus there was a that's kind of a historical moment that's profound that's

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:15.000
 really powerful do you also think that God makes himself seen in less obvious ways in

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:26.240
 our world today absolutely absolutely I mean it's it's certainly been the outlook of Jews

1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:32.760
 and Christians throughout history that God is seen in the creation that we when we look

1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:41.120
 at the creation we see to some extent the wonder the majesty the might of the person

1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:49.320
 or the entity but the person who created it and and that's a way in which scientists

1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:58.040
 particularly have over over the ages and certainly over most of the last five centuries since

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:05.040
 the scientific revolution scientists have seen in a certain sense the hand of God in

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:10.660
 creation I mean this leads us perhaps to a different discussion but I mean it's it's

1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:19.800
 remarkable to me how influential Christianity and religion in generally has been in science

1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:24.240
 yeah most of the scientists through history as if you described I mean God has been a

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.960
 very big part of their life and their work certainly up until the at the beginning of

1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:34.920
 the 20th century that was the case so maybe this is a good time to can you tell me what

1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:41.520
 scientism is yeah I mean the short answer is that by scientism we mean we mean the

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:48.280
 belief that science is all the real knowledge there is that's a shorthand there are lots

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:52.700
 of different facets of it and what which one can explore and the book in which I explored

1:01:52.700 --> 1:02:00.200
 it most most thoroughly was actually an earlier book called monopolizing knowledge and and

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:06.640
 the purpose of that title is to is to draw attention to the fact that in our society

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:15.760
 as a whole in particularly in the West today we we have grown so reliant on science that

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:23.760
 we that we tend to put aside other ways of getting to know things and so of course at

1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:31.800
 MIT we are focused on science and we do focus on it very much but the truth is that there

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:38.440
 are many ways of getting to know things in our world know things reliably in our world

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:45.120
 and a lot of them are not science so scientism in my view is a terrible intellectual error

1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:49.280
 it's to believe it's the belief that somehow the methods of science as we develop them

1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:56.340
 with you know experiments and in the end they it relies particularly upon reproducibility

1:02:56.340 --> 1:03:02.600
 in the world and on a kind of clarity that comes from measurements and mathematics and

1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:10.280
 related types of of skills those powerful though they are for finding out about the

1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:16.640
 world are not all the knowledge do not give us all the knowledge we we have and there's

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:24.800
 many other forms of knowledge and the illustration that I usually use to to try to help people

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:28.640
 to think about this is to say well look let's think about human history I mean to what extent

1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:34.360
 can human history be discovered scientifically the answer is essentially can't because and

1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:40.060
 the reason is because human history is not reproducible you can't do reproducible experiments

1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:46.920
 or observations and and go back and you know try it over again it's it's a one off thing

1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:53.240
 you know the history is full of unique events and and so you you know you you can't hope

1:03:53.240 --> 1:04:00.140
 to do history using the methods of science yeah I mean in some sense history is a story

1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:05.760
 of miracles I mean they don't have to do with God it's just uniqueness is anyway unique

1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:12.160
 events unique events and that science doesn't like that because it's unique events by their

1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:18.060
 very definition are not reproducible can I ask sort of a tricky question I don't even

1:04:18.060 --> 1:04:25.460
 know what atheist or atheism is but is it possible for somebody to be an atheist and

1:04:25.460 --> 1:04:33.520
 avoid slipping into scientism oh yeah absolutely I mean it I mean there these are two separate

1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:39.480
 things okay I'm quite sure there are many people who don't believe in God and yet recognize

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:44.200
 that there are many different ways of we get knowledge you know some is history some is

1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:54.440
 sociology economics politics philosophy art history language literature etc etc there

1:04:54.440 --> 1:05:00.220
 are many people who recognize those disciplines as having their own approaches to epistemology

1:05:00.220 --> 1:05:05.800
 and to get how we get knowledge and valuing them very highly I don't mean to say that

1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:14.480
 everyone you know who's an atheist automatically you know subscribes to the scientistic viewpoint

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:21.280
 that's not true but it's certainly the case that many of the arguments in fact most of

1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:27.960
 the arguments of the aggressive atheists of this century people are sometimes called new

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:33.360
 atheists although they're actually rather old most of their arguments are rather old

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:40.240
 you know are drawing heavily on scientism so when they say things like there's no evidence

1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:48.160
 to support Christianity okay what they are really focusing on is to say is saying that

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:54.020
 Christianity isn't proved or the evidence for Christianity is not science okay science

1:05:54.020 --> 1:05:59.960
 doesn't prove it and and you you know if you read their books that's what you find they

1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:08.160
 really mean is science doesn't lead you necessarily to believe in a creator God or into it in

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:15.480
 any particular in religion I accept that that's not a problem to me because I don't think

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:18.240
 that science is all the knowledge there is and I think there are other important ways

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:22.600
 of getting to know things and one of them is historical for example and I mentioned

1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:28.040
 earlier that I think I became persuaded and I were and I still am persuaded that the historical

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:34.340
 evidence for the resurrection is very is very persuasive again it's not proof or anything

1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:40.880
 like that but it's but it's pretty good evidence okay yeah I've um I talked to Richard Dawkins

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:48.120
 on this podcast and um uh and uh I saw you debate with Sean Carroll so I I understand

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:54.540
 this world it makes it makes me very curious maybe uh let me ask sort of another way my

1:06:54.540 --> 1:07:04.640
 own kind of uh world view maybe you can help as by way of therapy understand um you know

1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:09.880
 because you've kind of said that there's other ways of knowing what about if we if if I kind

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:17.600
 of sit here and am cognizant of the fact that I almost don't know anything so sort of I'm

1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:23.360
 sitting here almost paralyzed by the the mystery of it all and it's not even when you say there's

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:30.680
 other ways of knowing it um it feels almost too confident to me because uh yeah when I

1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:36.760
 when I listen to beautiful music or uh see art there's something there that's and that's

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:43.640
 uh that's beyond the reach of scientism I would say so beyond the reach of uh the the

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:52.200
 tools of science but I don't even feel like that could be as an actual tool of knowing

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:57.000
 it um yeah I just don't even know where to begin because it just feels like we know so

1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:02.220
 little like uh if we look even a hundred years from now when people look back to this time

1:08:02.220 --> 1:08:07.100
 humans look back to this time they'll probably laugh at how little we knew even a hundred

1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:11.120
 years from now and if we look at a thousand years from now hopefully we're still alive

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:18.360
 or some version of ourselves or AI version of ourselves you know they they'll certainly

1:08:18.360 --> 1:08:26.400
 laugh at the absurdity of our beliefs so what do you uh so you don't seem to be as paralyzed

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:31.760
 by how little we know you confidently push on forward but what do you make of that sense

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:42.360
 of uh of just not knowing of the mystery we need to be modest or or humble if even about

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:48.360
 what we know I accept that and I certainly think that's true not not simply because in

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:54.240
 the future we'll know more science and and there will be more powerful ways of finding

1:08:54.240 --> 1:09:01.320
 out about things but simply because you know sometimes we're not right we're wrong okay

1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:11.280
 in what we think we know um uh so that's crucial but it's also a very Christian outlook that

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:17.520
 kind of humility is what Jesus taught so I so I don't know whether this was in the back

1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:23.100
 of your mind when you were thinking about this but it's often the case that um people

1:09:23.100 --> 1:09:27.960
 of religious faith are are accused of being dogmatists okay and there is a sense in which

1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:35.080
 dogma teaching accepted teaching is is part of religions okay but I don't think that

1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:42.960
 necessarily uh uh that leads one to blind dogmatism and I don't I certainly don't

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:47.640
 think that faith we can talk about this later if you'd like but I certainly don't think

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:53.800
 that faith means thinking you know something and not listening to counter arguments for

1:09:53.800 --> 1:10:01.160
 example um so I I think that's crucial yeah what is uh what does faith mean to you what

1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:06.920
 does it uh feel like what does it actually sort of how do you carry your faith in terms

1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:13.920
 of the way you see the world well I think faith is very often misunderstood in our society

1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:23.520
 at the moment um because uh it's often portrayed as being nothing other than uh believing things

1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:34.440
 you know ain't true you know um or or believing things that are are are not proven okay um

1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:41.560
 and um and this and faith does have a strand which is to do with you know basically believing

1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:50.280
 in um in concepts or um propositions but actually the the word faith is much broader than that

1:10:50.280 --> 1:11:00.000
 faith also means um you know trusting in something trusting in a person or trusting in a thing

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:06.640
 uh the reliability of some technology for example um that's equally part of the meaning

1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:10.920
 of the word faith and and there's a third strand to the to the meaning of the word as

1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:19.080
 well and that is loyalty um so you know I have faith in my wife and and I try to act

1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:25.320
 in faith towards her and that's a kind of loyalty and so those three strands are the

1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:31.760
 are the most important strands of the meaning of faith yes belief in uh in propositions

1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:38.040
 that we might not have you know full proof about or maybe we have very little proof about

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:46.080
 but it's also trust and and loyalty and actually in the in terms of the Christian faith Christians

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:51.920
 are far more called to trust and loyalty than they are to belief in things they don't you

1:11:51.920 --> 1:12:00.000
 know don't have proof of okay um but but the critics of religion generally um tend to emphasize

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.920
 the first one and say well you know you believe things for which you have no evidence okay

1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:09.320
 that's what that's what they think faith is well yeah there there is a sense in which

1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:19.800
 everybody has to live their lives uh believing or or or making decisions in situations when

1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:27.520
 they don't have all the proof or evidence or knowledge that enables you to make a completely

1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:34.840
 um rational or well informed or prudent decision we you know we do this all the time you know

1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:39.480
 my drive down here I nearly took a wrong turning and I thought which which which way do I go

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:50.920
 do I keep going straight on and so my uh voice came out and I think go straight okay so so

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:56.080
 you have to make decisions and sometimes you know you don't have a navigation system telling

1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:00.480
 you what to do you just have to make that decision with no with insufficient evidence

1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:06.200
 and you're doing it all the time as a human and that's part of being sentient um and so

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:13.240
 that kind of um action and belief on the basis of incomplete evidence is not something that

1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:19.280
 I feel uncomfortable doing or I feel that I feel that somehow my Christian commitments

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:22.800
 are forced me to do when I wouldn't have had to have done it otherwise I would have had

1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:28.800
 to do it anyway um and and so you know there's a sense in which um I think it's important

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:33.840
 to see the breadth of meaning of faith and and and to recognize that in certainly in

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:39.600
 the case of Christianity um it's trust and loyalty that the the key themes that we're

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:48.360
 called to and I mean another interesting extension of that that you speak to is kind of loyalty

1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:54.520
 is referring to a connection with something outside of yourself yeah um so I think you've

1:13:54.520 --> 1:14:00.000
 spoken about like existentialism or even just atheism in general as um as leading naturally

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:07.720
 to an individualism as a focus on the on the self and uh ideas that maybe the Christian

1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:13.640
 faith can um instill in you is um allowing you to sort of look outside of yourself so

1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:21.080
 connection I mean loyalty fundamentally is about other beings um and yeah other beings

1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:27.280
 and I mean I think I don't know what it is in me but I'm very much drawn to that idea

1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:32.640
 and um I think humans in general are drawn to that idea you can you can make all kinds

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:37.320
 of evolutionary arguments all that kind of stuff but uh people always kind of tease me

1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:44.060
 uh because I talk about love a lot and I mean there's a lot of uh non scientific things

1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:48.920
 about love right like what the heck is that thing why why do we even need that thing it

1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:54.160
 uh it seems to be an annoying burden that uh that we we get so much uh joy in in life

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:59.160
 from a connection with other human beings deep uh lasting connections with human beings

1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:05.080
 same thing with loyalty why why do we get so much value and pleasure and strength and

1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:09.760
 meaning from loyalty from a connection with somebody else uh going through uh thick and

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:13.560
 thin with somebody else going through some hard times I mean some of the you know the

1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:19.720
 closest friends I I have is going through some some rough times together and that seems

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:29.540
 to make life deeply meaningful what is that so yeah um I that's that resonates with me

1:15:29.540 --> 1:15:37.480
 and I obviously I would I would affirm it um I think just to just to correct the implication

1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:45.920
 that you made I I don't think it's necessarily the the consequence of atheism uh that we

1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:51.040
 that we lose track of those kinds of things I I mean I think that atheists can be loyal

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:57.560
 okay if you like um the question more often comes up in the context of you know where

1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:05.120
 does morality come from and loyalty I think and duty are related to one another you know

1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.540
 if we have loyalty to someone then we have a duty to them okay as well and I think that

1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:17.640
 insofar as we see ourselves as having some kinds any kinds of duties or moral compulsions

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:23.480
 with respect to our relationships to other people it's I think it's a question that always

1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:28.440
 arises well where does these where do these come from and there there are various approaches

1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:37.500
 that people have towards deciding what makes ethics or or morality moral okay but I do

1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:48.760
 think it's the case that um it's very hard to ground morality um in a in any kind of

1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:57.360
 absolute way or a persuasive way um in mere human relationships and so it's certainly

1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:07.040
 the case that in Christianity um there is a sense in which um morality and you know

1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:16.120
 the morality of morals comes from a transcendent place from a transcendent deity and that we

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:27.640
 um that we ground are the compelling force of of morals on God are more than we do on

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:33.460
 individuals because after all you know if it if you if you've got nothing but you know

1:17:33.460 --> 1:17:40.840
 other people why should you you know treat your neighbor well why shouldn't you defraud

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:45.880
 your neighbor if it's good for you well you know you can construct all kinds of arguments

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:50.600
 and some of them are you know obviously arguments that are commonplace in religion too you should

1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:55.800
 do as you would be done by and all this kind of thing right but none of that seems any

1:17:55.800 --> 1:18:00.760
 any more than mere pragmatism to most people okay and so that's what that's one of the

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:06.520
 things if that Nietzsche amongst others you know really identified you know if God is

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:13.240
 dead if the idea of God is grounding our moral behavior is no longer viable in the West which

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:18.960
 Nietzsche thought that it wasn't okay then what does ground it and he had no good answer

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:23.960
 for it in fact he claimed there was no answer but then he couldn't live with that and so

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:32.120
 he invented the idea of the ubermensch you know this this superior human being okay and

1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:38.400
 this was a different way of trying to ground morality not a very successful one you know

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:46.440
 you could argue that it's a forerunner of the sort of racism of Hitler's regime and

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:53.800
 so forth that you know we've in the West thankfully shied away from in the in the past

1:18:53.800 --> 1:19:03.240
 half or three quarters of a century but you know I think it is the case that Christianity

1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:13.920
 gives me a basis for my moral beliefs that is more than mere pragmatism yeah but there

1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:20.560
 is a stepping outside of all that there does seem to be a powerful stabilizing like we

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:27.640
 humans are able to hold ideas together like in a distributed way outside of whether God

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:32.760
 exists or not or any that just our ability to kind of converge together towards a set

1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:40.320
 of beliefs into sometimes into tribes it's kind of I don't know if it's inherent to being

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:46.800
 human beings I hope not because now if I look on Twitter and there's a there's the red team

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:53.120
 and the blue team right it's almost like it's a care it's some kind of TV show that we're

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:58.200
 living in that people get into these tribes and they hold a set of beliefs that sometimes

1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:05.320
 don't I mean they are beliefs for the sake of holding those beliefs and we get this intimate

1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:11.600
 connection between each other for sharing those beliefs and we spoke to the things about

1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:17.000
 loyalty and love and that's the thing that people feel inside the tribe and it seems

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:23.000
 very human that within that tribe those beliefs don't necessarily always have to be connected

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:29.680
 to anything it's just the fact that you know I've did sports my whole life whenever you're

1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:35.600
 on a team the bond you get with it with other people on the team is incredible and the actual

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:42.080
 sport is often the silliest I mean I don't play ball sports anymore but the ball when

1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:46.620
 I played like soccer or tennis I mean all those sports are silly right you're playing

1:20:46.620 --> 1:20:52.900
 with a little ball but there's the bond you get is so deeply meaningful I just it's interesting

1:20:52.900 --> 1:20:59.720
 to me on the sociological level that it's possible to me whatever the beliefs of religion

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:09.680
 is whatever they're actually grounded in they might be they might have a power in themselves

1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:14.200
 I think there is tribalism everywhere and I think tribalism in the US at the moment

1:21:14.200 --> 1:21:21.240
 is rather difficult to bear from my point of view and it's I think fed by the internet

1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:27.660
 and social media and so forth but it's but historically tribalism has been a trait and

1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:38.280
 remains a trait in humans the genius of Christianity is that it supersedes tribalism I mean yes

1:21:38.280 --> 1:21:48.300
 when the Hebrews thought about Yahweh initially they thought about him as their tribal deity

1:21:48.300 --> 1:21:56.600
 just like the tribal deities round about about them and so but and and yet from you know

1:21:56.600 --> 1:22:06.440
 early on in Hebrew history the crucial thing that Yahweh came to mean or I would say revealed

1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:13.680
 of himself to them was that he wasn't just a tribal deity he was the God that created

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:18.920
 the whole thing and if he is the God of the whole thing then he's not just the God of

1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:26.800
 the Hebrews or in the case of you know Americans God is not just the God of Americans he's

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:36.880
 the God of everybody okay and that is a way in a way the most amazing transcending of

1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:45.440
 tribal loyalties and one of the crucial you know occasions in the New Testament you know

1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:52.760
 when the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost you know the the apostles and the and the disciples

1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:57.220
 speak in other tongues and there are people from all all the countries you know round

1:22:57.220 --> 1:23:02.900
 about hear them in their own languages and so you know whether whether you take that

1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:12.360
 as factual or not that is the a statement of the transcendent aspects of Christianity

1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:18.120
 or the claimed transcendent aspects of Christianity that it transcends culture and that's certainly

1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:20.320
 something which I find appealing.

1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:29.360
 When I kind of touch on this topic in my own mind one of the hardest questions is as why

1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:36.520
 is there suffering in the world do you have a good answer well I have I have some answers

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:41.480
 but you're right that it is one of the toughest questions the problem of pain or the problem

1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:49.160
 of suffering or the problem of theodicy as as theologians call it is is is probably one

1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:55.760
 of the toughest I think it's important to say that there are certain types of answers

1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:01.620
 to this question but there are aspects of this question to which there is no intellectual

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:09.520
 answer that is going to satisfy and and the fact of the matter is you know when I'm speaking

1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:18.680
 to an audience let's say at at at some kind of lecture I can be sure that there are people

1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:23.200
 in that audience who are either personally suffering they've got illness they've got

1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:28.080
 pains there maybe they're facing death or someone in their family is in similar sorts

1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:35.200
 of situations so suffering is a reality and and there is nothing that I can say that is

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:43.640
 going to solve their feeling of agony and angst and and maybe despair in those types

1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:50.640
 of situations there is really only one thing that I think humans can do for one another

1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:57.340
 in those kinds of situations and that is simply to be there to be there alongside your friend

1:24:57.340 --> 1:25:04.920
 or your or your colleague or or whoever you know family member or whoever it might be

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:11.200
 and that's the only really sense in which we can give comfort if we try to give intellectual

1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:17.480
 solutions to these problems we're going to be like like the comforters that were in the

1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:26.320
 book of Job in the in the Bible who who brought no comfort to Job himself with their intellectual

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:32.520
 answers but if they had been there and some of them were there they sat alongside that

1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:39.200
 is some level of comfort and and after all that's the meaning of the word compassion

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:45.480
 it means to suffer alongside of somebody and I would say first off you know what does a

1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:52.000
 Christian say about suffering the the first thing a Christian should say is compassion

1:25:52.000 --> 1:26:00.360
 is all that really counts and what's more we say that God has acted in compassion towards

1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:07.040
 us that is to say he has suffered with us in the person of Jesus Christ and when we

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:15.120
 see the passion of Jesus we recognize that God takes suffering deadly seriously has taken

1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:21.120
 it so seriously that he's been willing to come and be a part of his creation in the

1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:29.040
 person of of Jesus Christ and suffer death the most horrible death on the cross and for

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:35.840
 our benefit so that's one side of of suffering but the question you know the philosophical

1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:44.400
 question remains you know surely if God is good you know and God is omnipotent benevolent

1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:50.100
 you know why doesn't he take away all the suffering why doesn't he cause miracles to

1:26:50.100 --> 1:26:54.760
 occur that will take away all this suffering I think there are some good answers to that

1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:05.520
 question in the in the following sense that you know we live in a world where the consistency

1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:13.400
 of the world is an absolutely crucial part of it you know the fact that our world behaves

1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:22.280
 reproducibly in the main is absolutely essential for the integrity of our lives without it

1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:29.640
 we wouldn't exist okay and so there is a sense in which the integrity of creation calls for

1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:34.800
 there being consistent behavior which you know these days we think of as being the laws

1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:41.600
 of nature okay and so the consistent behavior of nature is very very important it's what

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:50.000
 enables us to be what we are and if you're calling upon God in in in in your critique

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:58.260
 of why isn't this benevolent creator you know fixing things one answer is he's fixed things

1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:07.640
 in a certain sense to have an integrity in them and that integrity is the best thing

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:13.360
 it's the way we have our existence it's the way we live and move and have our being and

1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:19.720
 you know if you want something different you've got to show that there is a way in which you

1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:25.680
 could invent a world that is better that it has the integrity that we need to exist okay

1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:32.840
 and and and to be able to think and and and love and and be but but you were going to

1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:38.280
 do it better you know and the atheists think that maybe they have got a better idea but

1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:42.560
 if they thought about it a bit more carefully they'd realize no one has put forward a better

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:50.120
 idea okay so the so another way to say that uh i mean is that suffering is an integral

1:28:50.120 --> 1:29:02.360
 part of this of um of a consistent existence so so sort of uh and the philosophical in

1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:08.560
 a philosophical sense uh the full richness and the beauty of our experience would not

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:14.760
 be as beautiful would not be as rich uh if there was no suffering in the world is that

1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:18.520
 is that possible well i think you said two different things that aren't exactly at least

1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:25.400
 that aren't exactly the same one is that suffering is an integral part of our experience you

1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:31.960
 know that might be considered a challenge to certain types of christian theology or

1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:37.000
 or even uh jewish theology in other words um christians talk about the fall and talk

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:43.920
 about uh adam and eve in the garden and and have have a vision of there being some kind

1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:50.440
 of perception from or perfection from which we have fallen and i think there is a perfection

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:56.920
 from which we've fallen but i don't think that perfection is some kind of physical perfection

1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:02.120
 in other words i don't subscribe personally to the view that some some christians do that

1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:09.320
 there was some state um prior to the fall in which death did not occur i don't think

1:30:09.320 --> 1:30:15.480
 that that's consistent with science as we know it and i and i think that um death for

1:30:15.480 --> 1:30:23.440
 example has been part of the biological world and the and the universe as a whole um from

1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:30.600
 from billions of years ago so so just to be clear about that um you know i on the other

1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:38.440
 hand i do so if that's the case then certainly in that sense at the very least um suffering

1:30:38.440 --> 1:30:47.560
 or at least death okay is part of the biological existence and that probably seems so completely

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:53.040
 obvious to somebody who you know is au fait with science whether they you know whether

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:59.000
 they're a scientist or not well so and i apologize if i'm interrupting but it's the obvious reality

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:03.920
 of of uh our life today but there's a lot of people i think it's currently in vogue

1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:09.800
 i've talked to quite a few folks who kind of see as the goal of many of our pursuits

1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:15.280
 as to extend life indefinitely a sort of uh you know a dream for many people is to live

1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:21.500
 forever uh but in the in the technological world in the engineering world in the scientific

1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:29.680
 world i mean that's that's the big dream to me it feels like that's not a dream it's i

1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:34.480
 certainly would like to live forever uh like that that's the initial feeling the instinctual

1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:40.640
 feeling because you know life is so amazing but then if you actually kind of like you've

1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:45.860
 presented it if you actually uh live that kind of life you would realize that that's

1:31:45.860 --> 1:31:50.560
 actually a step uh backwards that's a step down from the experience of this life in my

1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:57.540
 sense that death is an essential part of life uh about an essential part of this experience

1:31:57.540 --> 1:32:04.560
 death of all things so the thing the fact that things end somehow and the scarcity of

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:12.680
 things somehow create the beauty of this experience that we have yeah transhumanism doesn't look

1:32:12.680 --> 1:32:20.760
 very attractive to me either but it also doesn't look very feasible um but that's a whole big

1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:27.560
 topic that i'm not exactly an expert but i'll say but i but you know i'm of a certain age

1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:35.640
 where my mortality is more pressing or more obvious to me than it once was okay um and

1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:45.080
 and i don't dread that i don't see that as in a certain sense even the enemy okay you're

1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:50.720
 not afraid of death well i'm afraid of lots of things in a in a in a conceptual way but

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:58.400
 it doesn't keep me awake at night okay um i i'm i think like most people i'm more afraid

1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:03.400
 of pain than i am of death so i i don't want to put myself forward as some kind of hero

1:33:03.400 --> 1:33:10.080
 that doesn't worry about these things that's not true but i i do think and maybe this is

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:19.120
 part of my christian outlook um that there is life beyond the grave um but i don't think

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:26.880
 that that it's life in this universe or in this um certainly not in this body and maybe

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:30.880
 not in a certain sense in this mind i mean you know christian christian belief in the

1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:35.680
 afterlife is is that we will be resurrected we will be in a certain sense be with god

1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:39.040
 i don't know what that means and i don't think anybody else really quite knows what that

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:45.300
 means but there are lots of ways that over history people artists and and and writers

1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:49.680
 and so forth have pictured it um and these are all perhaps some of them helpful ways

1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:55.640
 of thinking about it do you think it's possible to know what happens after we die um i i don't

1:33:55.640 --> 1:34:02.080
 think we find out by near death experiences or those kinds of things but but i but i think

1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:09.560
 that uh you know that we have sufficient i feel i have sufficient information if you

1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:16.360
 like um in terms of god's revelation to be confident that that i will go somewhere

1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:29.320
 else okay but it won't be here and i to me the aspirations of transhumanism are horrific

1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:34.640
 i mean i think it would be a nightmare not a dream a nightmare you know to be somehow

1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:42.680
 downloaded into a computer and live one's life like that i because it it completely

1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:49.720
 discounts the integrity of our bodies as well as our minds i mean we aren't just disembodied

1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:58.360
 minds it would not be me that was in the computer it would be something else if if that kind

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:03.000
 of download were possible of course it isn't possible and it's very long way from being

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:08.040
 possible but you know amazing things happen so we shouldn't be too certain so this is

1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:14.320
 this is a place that uh again maybe taking a slight step outside uh wherever philosophizing

1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:21.680
 a little bit uh let me ask you about uh human level or superhuman level intelligence uh

1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:30.240
 the artificial intelligence systems do you what do you make from um from almost a religious

1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:37.240
 or a perspective that we've been talking about of the special aspect of human nature of us

1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:43.800
 creating intelligence systems that exhibit some elements of that human nature is that

1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:48.360
 something again like we were talking about with transhumanism uh there's a feasibility

1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:52.400
 question of how hard is it to actually build machines that human level intelligence or

1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:57.160
 have something like consciousness or have all those kinds of human qualities and then

1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:03.880
 there's the do we want to do that kind of thing so on both of those directions what

1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:10.120
 do you think well okay so you know since your podcast is called ai i don't want to offend

1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:15.200
 too many of your listeners out there that's but i but i i think one should be a little

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:20.640
 bit more modest about one's claims for ai than have typically been the case yeah i think

1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:25.720
 that actually a lot of people in ai are somewhat chastened and so there there are more modest

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:33.920
 claims than are common with the transhumanists and yes and and so forth um and you know i

1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:39.640
 used to play chess when i was a kid i was pretty good at it okay um won competitions

1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:44.680
 and so on and so forth and i when i and i'm talking about when i was in high school i

1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:50.800
 thought it was pretty unlikely that a computer would be able to become good at chess but

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:56.240
 i was dead wrong okay and so you know um how did that make you feel by the way when um

1:36:56.240 --> 1:37:03.000
 t blue big i stopped playing chess seriously when i had when i encountered computers that

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:10.280
 could beat me okay i still play with my grandchildren a little bit but but um but yeah it it seemed

1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:15.640
 like in a certain sense it became a solved problem uh when ai was able to do it better

1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:22.620
 than i could so i think that there are ways in which today we've seen um computers do

1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:29.400
 things which historically were regarded as being very characteristic of human intelligence

1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:36.920
 and in that sense there there is some success to ai i also think that um you know there

1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:41.820
 are certain things which one might think of as being ai which are you know completely

1:37:41.820 --> 1:37:49.440
 widespread in our society i'm thinking about the internet search engines and so forth which

1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:55.540
 are enormously influential and obviously do things more powerfully than any individual

1:37:55.540 --> 1:38:04.320
 human or even any combination of humans could do much faster and and and accessing databases

1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:12.880
 and so on and so forth is all of this is outstripped our human intelligence um i'm not sure the

1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:19.420
 extent though to which that is really intelligence uh in the way that was traditionally meant

1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:28.760
 but it's certainly amazingly um facile and um it it multiplies our ability to access

1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:34.160
 human knowledge and and data and so forth so is that something is that is that enter

1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:39.920
 the realm of something we should be concerned about so in the realm of religion you talk

1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:44.760
 about what is good what is evil what is right what is wrong you have set of morals set of

1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:50.880
 beliefs and when you have an entity come into the picture that uh that has quite a bit of

1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:58.120
 power if we potentially look into the future and intelligence and capability um do you

1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:05.560
 think there's something that religion can say about artificial intelligence or is that

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.360
 something you we shouldn't worry about until that arrives you think just like with the

1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:15.880
 chess program um you know religious writers have thought about this for centuries uh you

1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:21.500
 know there's been a long debate about what is what was historically called the plurality

1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:29.680
 of worlds and it was actually more about whether there are places where other intelligent creatures

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:35.680
 live than it was about us creating them but but i think it's largely the same question

1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:40.600
 it's almost like aliens like other intelligent so if there is other intelligent life in the

1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:46.520
 universe what is its relationship to god okay that is in a certain sense the puzzle that

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:50.360
 religious thinkers and writers have thought about for a long time and there's a whole

1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:55.960
 range of of different opinions about that i mean personally you know i think it's it's

1:39:55.960 --> 1:40:00.400
 an interesting question but it's not a very pressing question at the moment um yeah and

1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:06.480
 i think the same way about the the question of what happens if we're able to build a sentient

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:11.080
 robot for example um i think it's an interesting question and we'll have to think about it

1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:16.240
 when that happens um but i think we're still quite a ways away from that and so i i don't

1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:21.560
 have a good answer um but i think there's a literature that you one could tap um to

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:28.080
 think about if you want to start early on the question well let me ask you another impossible

1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:33.400
 question from a religious or from a personal perspective what do you think is consciousness

1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:41.240
 this this uh subjective experience that we seem to be having there's uh this there's

1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:46.880
 uh the christian religion have something to say about consciousness does your own when

1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:52.760
 you look in the mirror do you have a sense of what is consciousness um i think the bible

1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:57.080
 doesn't have much in the way of answers about that directly in the sense that you're perhaps

1:40:57.080 --> 1:41:02.380
 asking it which is more like i think you're asking for some kind of uh quasi scientific

1:41:02.380 --> 1:41:08.520
 or maybe indeed scientific uh description that's really looking for one yes um i i think

1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:15.720
 that i think that there it's an interesting question i think it's actually um it's a

1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:19.800
 jump too far i think we have we don't even know the answer to the question what is the

1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:25.320
 mind let alone consciousness so if you distinguish between those two things i think the question

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:32.320
 that's being addressed more directly um scientifically as well as in other ways it is what is the

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:38.800
 mind um and that is certainly a very topical question even in places like mit which is

1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:43.880
 not historically involved with philosophical questions you know that people are doing neuroscience

1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:50.880
 and so forth i think it's a very important question and i think that we're going to find

1:41:50.880 --> 1:42:01.760
 that um we are not computers in other words i think uh the the commonplace theory of what

1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:11.680
 mind is is is generally speaking by analogy that we are basically wet wetware okay um

1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:20.800
 that we're some computer like um entity um and that that the analogy to digital computers

1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:27.180
 is is is a pretty decent one i mean that that's of course a viewpoint which um you know which

1:42:27.180 --> 1:42:32.320
 drives the aspirations of the transhumanists i mean they they so much believe that our

1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:37.200
 minds are nothing other than you know in a certain sense some kind of implementation

1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:42.040
 of software in biology that they say to themselves well of course we're going to be able to download

1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:50.960
 it into a into a digital computer i don't think that's true i think it's most likely

1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:58.280
 that quantum mechanics is very important in the brain uh it seems most unlikely that it's

1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:04.520
 not to me i know that that's contrary to the opinions of many people but but that's my

1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:09.560
 view and it's also a view for example of people like roger penrose and and people like that

1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:17.080
 who've written about it um rather extensively and if that's the case then really my mind

1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:25.320
 is not reproduce reducible to some kind of software which can be considered to be portable

1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:33.480
 it is so uh connected to the hardware of my body that the two are inseparable okay and

1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:39.900
 so if that is in fact what we find um as i suspect will be the case then the aspirations

1:43:39.900 --> 1:43:47.480
 of the transhumanists will be very long incoming if at all um so i think that actually physics

1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:56.040
 and chemistry um you know are in a are in a sense um involved with the brain and with

1:43:56.040 --> 1:44:03.360
 in the mind but not in a very simple way like you know like the computer analogy um in and

1:44:03.360 --> 1:44:14.480
 a much more complicated way and i and i also think that um it's philosophically ignorant

1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:23.760
 to speak as if um when and if the actions of the brain are understood at the physical

1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:31.120
 and chemical level that will mean that the mind will vanish as a concept you know that

1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:36.840
 we'll just say no we're nothing but brains okay of course it won't i mean it may well

1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:42.440
 be that our mind is an emergent phenomenon that comes out of the physics and chemistry

1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:50.000
 and biology okay but it's also something that we have to encounter and take seriously and

1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:58.320
 so um you know it's it's not the case that it that the mind is reducible to nothing but

1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:04.720
 physics and chemistry even if it's embedded in you know continuously into physics and

1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:12.040
 chemistry as i rather suspect it is um so i that that's my own view i mean another way

1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:19.320
 of putting it is that the mind or the soul is not something added into humans as might

1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:25.360
 have been the viewpoint um historically i do think there is you know there is something

1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:30.240
 added to humans but it's not it's not the mind it's the spirit and that takes us beyond

1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:35.640
 the physical it takes us beyond this universe but i but i don't think that that consciousness

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:42.360
 the mind etc etc is that thing which is necessarily added in so i i'm not be emergent in some

1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:47.880
 way i'm not a substance dualist in that sense okay if you want to put it philosophically

1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:54.000
 i mean uh but you see your sense is um so the mind and the intelligence and consciousness

1:45:54.000 --> 1:46:00.520
 can be these emergent things do you do you have a hope a sense that science could help

1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:07.800
 us get it pretty far down the road of understanding we will get much further than we have and

1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:15.920
 we it'll be interesting um i mean right now our our methods of diagnosing the human brain

1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:22.440
 are extremely primitive i mean the resolution that we have you know that comes out of uh

1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:28.840
 out of nmr and and brain scans and so forth is miserable compared with what we need in

1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:36.120
 order to understand the brain at the cellular level let alone at the atomic level um but

1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:40.360
 you know we're making progress it's relatively slow progress but it's progress and people

1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.160
 are working on it and we're going to get better at it and we'll find out very interesting

1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:49.520
 things as we do um the time resolution is also completely hopeless compared compare

1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:55.080
 with what we need to understand of a thought you know so um so there's a long way to go

1:46:55.080 --> 1:47:01.200
 and we will get better at it um but i'm but i'm not at all worried as some people are

1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:07.600
 and some people speak as if this is a good thing that somehow the concepts of humanity

1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:15.480
 and the mind and religion and and consciousness are going to vanish because we're going to

1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:21.280
 have you know complete uh physicochemical description of the brain in the near future

1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:26.160
 that we're not going to have that and secondly even if we had it the mind and all these other

1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:31.760
 things aren't going to vanish because of it well i i find kind of compelling the the notion

1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:42.400
 that whoever created this universe uh and us uh did so to understand itself himself

1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:50.760
 i mean there's a there's a there's a powerful self reflection notion to this whole experiment

1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:57.000
 that we're a part of i certainly think that god takes delight in his creation and that

1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:04.240
 it was created for that delight as much as it was um for any other reason and that you

1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:11.040
 know that therefore are there's reason to be hopeful and and awestruck by the creation

1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:15.920
 whether it's on the very small or on the very large i'm not sure if you're familiar there's

1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:21.880
 something called the simulation hypothesis well that's been fun to talk about with the

1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:29.560
 computer scientists and so on which is a kind of thought experiment that proposes that um

1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:33.720
 you know the entirety of the world around us is a kind of a computer program that's

1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:39.520
 a simulation and then we're living inside it i think there's um i think from a certain

1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:45.480
 perspective that could be consistent with a religious view of the world i mean you could

1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:51.760
 just use different terms uh basically uh what are your but it's a it's a it feels like a

1:48:51.760 --> 1:49:01.120
 more um modern updated version of that but what is what's what's your sense of this uh

1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:06.080
 the simulation hypothesis do you find interesting useful to think about it do you find it ridiculous

1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:11.680
 did you find it fun what are your thoughts uh it's fun and it's been of course the subject

1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:21.200
 of various movies yeah um that that some of which are very well known um you know i don't

1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:28.800
 think it makes sense to think of it as a simulation hypothesis in the sense that we're really

1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:38.040
 lying in uh banks um of of uh on banks of of beds having our energy drained away from

1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:43.760
 us um and and the simulation is going on in our individual brains that that makes no sense

1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:48.920
 to me at all i don't think that's what's meant by the simulation hypothesis as you're using

1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:57.080
 it now but i think that there is a um there is very little distinction between saying

1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:07.560
 that a an intelligent creator has set up the universe according to his will and his plan

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:16.260
 and set it in motion and is allowing it to run out maybe as christians say he's sustaining

1:50:16.260 --> 1:50:23.160
 it actually um by his word of power it says in the book of the letter to hebrews okay

1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:34.140
 um in in in in this amazingly consistent and um integrated way um i don't think there's

1:50:34.140 --> 1:50:38.320
 very much difference between saying that and saying that it's a simulation okay i mean

1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:44.240
 i think it's almost the same thing okay but i but i think from but i think it's important

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:52.200
 to recognize that the simulation in that concept the simulation and the creation or the universe

1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:59.780
 are the same thing okay in other words it's a simulation you know that is billions of

1:50:59.780 --> 1:51:07.600
 light years across okay yeah um i mean there's a sense in which it helps one understand especially

1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:13.320
 if you're not religious that there is something outside of the world that uh we live in that

1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:17.600
 there's something bigger than the world we live in um and that i mean it's just another

1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:26.840
 perspective on uh that humbles humbles you um so in that sense one shortcoming of that

1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:33.120
 is is the following is of the of the analogy is this that we think of a simulation as something

1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:39.200
 take taking place in the universe you know when we it's it's taking place in my computer

1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:48.600
 okay i don't think that's the right analogy for um a christian view of creation okay i

1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:55.880
 don't think it's taking place in some other universe that god has made okay i i think

1:51:55.880 --> 1:52:02.280
 maybe it's taking place in the mind of god christians might hypothesize also but i but

1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:07.920
 i think that that that it's important to recognize that christian theology at any rate

1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:14.520
 is that god is not one of the entities in the universe and and presumably therefore

1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:21.360
 is very different from a simulation that we might run on a computer let me ask you adam

1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:26.680
 and eve even adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil does this

1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:31.640
 is this story meaningful to you what does the story mean to you yeah i it is meaningful

1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:37.200
 to me um i i take the you know the writings of the bible very seriously and i think that

1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:43.760
 most christians regard them as having some kind of authoritative um role in their in

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:49.560
 their in their faith um what do i get from it i mean i think the most important thing

1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:53.440
 that christians get from the story of adam and eve and they're eating the apple and

1:52:53.440 --> 1:53:01.160
 so forth is that the relationship between humans and god is broken has been broken by

1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:07.520
 man's disobedience that's what the the story of adam and eve and the apple is all about

1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:17.300
 and um that that broken relationship is for christians what jesus came to redeem came

1:53:17.300 --> 1:53:29.280
 to overcome that brokenness and uh restore uh that relationship with god um uh to some

1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:36.360
 extent at any rate on earth and and ultimately um you know in in the in eternity to restore

1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:43.120
 it fully so that's really what christians mean and gain from the story of adam and eve

1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:48.800
 of course lots of people ask the questions about how sort how literally should we take

1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:53.720
 these stories of particularly the first few few chapters of genesis which is an important

1:53:53.720 --> 1:54:00.560
 question but but i mean but we tend to um get bogged down with it a bit too much i think

1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:08.440
 we should take away the message um and i think the the the uh what the what actually we would

1:54:08.440 --> 1:54:14.320
 have seen if we'd been there okay is something which is a matter of speculation and it's

1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:18.480
 certainly not terribly important from the point of view of christian theology but it

1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:25.880
 seems like a very important moment um as a man of faith do you um do you do you wish

1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:32.680
 that uh i think it was eve first uh yeah well see do you wish that by the way it was just

1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:38.800
 a fruit as a few what you said it very carefully as the fruit fruit of the tree right uh do

1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:43.720
 you wish they wouldn't have eaten of the tree i mean this is a back to our discussion of

1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:50.240
 suffering was that like an essential thing that needed to happen you're gonna have to

1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:59.480
 read paradise lost to get your answer to that beautifully put okay well let me ask the the

1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:05.760
 biggest question one that you also touch in your book but one that i asked every once

1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:13.520
 in a while is what is the meaning of life the meaning of my life is many different things

1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:24.360
 okay but it but they are all kind of centered around um relationships um i mean for a christian

1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:32.080
 one's relationship with god is a crucial part of the meaning of life but one's relationship

1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:40.040
 with one's family wife's wife parents children grandchildren in my case um and so forth those

1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:46.480
 are crucially important um these are all the places where people whether they're religious

1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:56.120
 or not find meaning um but ultimately um i think a person who has faith in a creator

1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:10.200
 um who we think has a an intention or many intentions but a but a but a will um in respect

1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:19.540
 of the world as a whole that's a crucial part of meaning and the idea that my life might

1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:30.920
 have some small significance in the plan of that creator is an amazingly powerful idea

1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:38.640
 that give that brings meaning um i i tell a story in my book that um when i was a student

1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:44.000
 before i became a christian i read a philosophy book with whose approximate title was um what

1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.600
 you know what is the meaning of life and you know that book basically said there is no

1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:52.960
 meaning to life you have to make up the meaning as you go along and i think that's probably

1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:59.520
 the the predominant secular view is these days that there is no real meaning but you

1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.560
 can make up a meaning and that will give you meaning into your life um i don't subscribe

1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:11.280
 to that view anymore um i think there is more meaning than that um but i do think that those

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:15.320
 things which give meaning to our life are very important and we should emphasize them

1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:21.360
 and you you have said that as the part of the as the part of that meaning is the part

1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:31.760
 of your faith uh love and loyalty are key parts so can you try to say what is uh love

1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:45.800
 and loyalty like what what does it mean to you what does it look like if you were to

1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:54.840
 give advice to uh to your children grandchildren of what to look for in in looking for loyalty

1:57:54.840 --> 1:58:02.200
 and and and love what would you try to say well i think it's something like yielding

1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:14.780
 your will or desire to another um it's valuing others more highly or at least as highly as

1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:22.720
 yourself but that's just the start of it because true love you reach a point where you are

1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:32.720
 you feel compelled by the other uh and that i think to some people sounds very scary but

1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:43.000
 actually it's terrifically liberating um and i think that love then brings you into service

1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:52.220
 towards another and i'm you know reminded of um the phrase from the anglican uh prayer

1:58:52.220 --> 1:59:00.200
 book where it talks about um jesus whose service is perfect freedom in other words for us christians

1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:08.480
 to serve god is what perfects our freedom and i think there is an amazing love is um

1:59:08.480 --> 1:59:18.600
 is in part kept captivity but in a kind of paradoxical sense it's also an amazing freedom

1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:24.160
 love is freedom i don't think there's a better way to end it we started with fusion energy

1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:28.720
 and ending on love in there's a huge honor to talk to you thank you so much for your

2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:27.080
 leave you with some words from arthur c clark finally i would like to assure my many buddhist

2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:32.440
 christian hindu jewish and muslim friends that i am sincerely happy that the religion

2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:38.120
 which chance has given you has contributed to your peace of mind and often as western

 medical science now reluctantly admits to your physical well being perhaps it is better

2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:53.240
 to be unsane and happy than sane and unhappy but it is the best of all to be sane and happy

2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.320
 whether our descendants can achieve that goal will be the greatest challenge of the future

2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:05.080
 indeed it may well decide whether we have any future thank you for listening and hope

2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:08.280
