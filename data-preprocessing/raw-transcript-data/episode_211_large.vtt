 The following is a conversation with Brian Miorescu, author of The Immortality Key,

00:05.520 --> 00:10.880
 The Secret History of the Religion with No Name, a book that reconstructs the forgotten history of

00:10.880 --> 00:16.400
 psychedelics in the development of Western civilization. To support this podcast,

00:24.720 --> 00:31.280
 are in the description. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation with Brian

00:31.280 --> 00:39.760
 Miorescu. Who or what do you think God is? How has our conception, maybe put another way,

00:39.760 --> 00:43.680
 of God changed throughout history? We're starting with an easy one, Lex.

00:43.680 --> 00:55.120
 Yep. So, what is God? Well, God is a thought. God is an idea, but its reference is to that which is

00:55.120 --> 01:02.320
 beyond thinking, beyond our ability to even conceive, beyond the categories of being and

01:02.320 --> 01:07.760
 nonbeing. So, how do we talk about that? To talk about it is almost to get it wrong, right? So,

01:07.760 --> 01:14.160
 Joe Campbell famously said that any God that is not transparent to transcendence is like an

01:14.160 --> 01:20.320
 idolatry because it's just a mental construct, and it can't possibly speak to the incomprehensible.

01:20.320 --> 01:28.080
 So, we use poetic language. We say the being of beings, the infinite life energy of the universe,

01:28.640 --> 01:35.040
 the mystery of transcendence, boundless life, unqualified isness, but it doesn't quite get to

01:35.040 --> 01:41.520
 the point. I think that if there's any great insight from mysticism, it's that you and I

01:41.520 --> 01:48.240
 participate with God in a very real way, Lex Friedman, here in Austin, Texas, that in the here

01:48.240 --> 01:54.160
 and now to touch that eternal principle, another way to refer to God, to touch that eternal principle

01:54.160 --> 02:02.240
 within ourselves is to participate with divinity in some way. So, not an external force, but

02:02.240 --> 02:07.440
 that divine sense within. So, there's some aspect in which God is a part of us. So, one, it's the

02:07.440 --> 02:13.600
 thing we can't describe. It represents all of the mystery around us. It's outside our ability to

02:13.600 --> 02:19.200
 comprehend, and at the same time, it's somehow the thing that's inside of us also. The ultimate

02:19.200 --> 02:24.400
 paradox. Mechthild of Magdeburg, 13th century German mystic, maybe the first German mystic,

02:25.840 --> 02:32.160
 says that the day of her spiritual awakening was the day that she saw and knew that she saw God

02:32.160 --> 02:37.920
 in all things and all things in God. And so, we can say this, by the way, without apology or

02:37.920 --> 02:45.120
 lightweight theology or vapid speculation or even heresy. We can talk about this,

02:45.120 --> 02:49.520
 including within the Abrahamic faiths. The mystical core of these faiths all talk about

02:49.520 --> 02:56.160
 the encounter of divinity within. That's what I explore in the immortality key, this notion of

02:56.160 --> 03:02.240
 techniques, archaic techniques in some cases, of ecstasy, that allow that experience of the

03:02.240 --> 03:07.200
 eternal principle to actually rise up in our consciousness when we're still here as flesh and

03:07.200 --> 03:15.680
 blood beings. There's some sense in which our conception of God, though, is conjured up by

03:15.680 --> 03:26.240
 our own mind. And so, aren't we creating God? Aren't we the gods that are creating the idea of

03:26.240 --> 03:36.320
 God? When we talk about God, aren't we playing with ideas that are created by our mind and

03:36.320 --> 03:46.320
 thereby we are the creator, not God? This is a very kind of cyclical question, but in some sense,

03:46.320 --> 03:55.840
 I mean that if God is the thing that represents the mystery all around us, contrast that with

03:55.840 --> 04:01.520
 our conception of God, the way we talk about him, is more a creation of our minds. It's not the

04:01.520 --> 04:07.280
 mystery. It's our struggle to comprehend the mystery. And therefore, we're creating the God

04:07.280 --> 04:12.720
 in terms of the God that we're talking about in this conversation or in general, if that makes any

04:12.720 --> 04:20.320
 sense. It makes no sense whatsoever. Great. This is wonderful. But this is the eternal mystery.

04:21.840 --> 04:27.120
 This is why it's so difficult to talk about, and yet it could be the very center of our beings.

04:27.120 --> 04:33.120
 The Upanishads speak about us as the creators, about us as gods. It's a very different creation

04:33.120 --> 04:41.200
 myth, but the God of the Upanishads in this great verse talks about pouring themselves into

04:41.200 --> 04:48.160
 creation. Indeed, I have become this creation, says God. And there's a great line, verily he or

04:48.160 --> 04:56.640
 she who knows this becomes in this creation a creator. So, yeah, I mean, just our ability to

04:56.640 --> 05:02.480
 engage in mentation, our ability to think about this stuff is partly our divine nature. This is

05:02.480 --> 05:07.840
 what the humanists were talking about in the Renaissance, by the way. And that it's not so much

05:08.560 --> 05:15.680
 learning, putting dots together, having arguments with each other over learned books. It's a

05:15.680 --> 05:21.680
 process of unlearning, is what some of the mystical traditions talk about. Unlearning all these

05:21.680 --> 05:27.040
 thoughts, emotions, traumas, and experiences that have gone into the false construction of our false

05:27.040 --> 05:34.720
 self, that behind all these layers, like peeling back the onion, is a part of us that once you can

05:34.720 --> 05:40.160
 identify that, begins to look a little bit different. In other words, it's one thing to

05:40.160 --> 05:47.360
 foster a relationship with God. It's a very different thing to identify as God. And I mean

05:47.360 --> 05:52.240
 that quite literally, without being heretical. You can find this in the mystery traditions.

05:52.960 --> 05:58.320
 Can you expand on this? You mean a human being can embody God?

06:00.000 --> 06:07.040
 That is textbook incarnational theology that you can find in any Christian mysticism.

06:07.040 --> 06:13.840
 But you can find it in the mystical tradition of Islam and Judaism as well. So, Rumi, for example,

06:14.800 --> 06:22.000
 the great Sufi mystic talks about, if you could get rid of yourself, just get rid of yourself just

06:22.000 --> 06:28.240
 once, the secret of secrets would open to you. That the face of the unknown would appear on the

06:28.240 --> 06:33.520
 perception of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day Christian,

06:33.520 --> 06:38.240
 of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day contemporary mystic,

06:38.880 --> 06:42.080
 talks about, because this stuff does continue, there's a continuity to it.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.080
 The poetry here is incredible.

06:44.080 --> 06:49.200
 So, well, listen to Rabbi Kushner. He says that the emptying of selfhood

06:50.080 --> 06:56.480
 allows the soul to attach to true reality. And in Kabbalism, the true reality is what's called

06:56.480 --> 07:03.680
 the divine nothingness, ayin. And so, I like the adage that atheists and mystics both essentially

07:03.680 --> 07:10.240
 believe in nothing, except that the mystics spell it with a capital N, the divine nothing.

07:10.240 --> 07:15.760
 And then I'll give you Meister Eckhart, another medieval Christian mystic. He says that

07:16.800 --> 07:22.400
 if you could not yourself, the same concept, if you could not yourself for just an instant,

07:22.400 --> 07:27.440
 indeed, I say less than an instant, you would possess all. So, again, you're seeing the same

07:27.440 --> 07:33.600
 thing in Sufism, Kabbalism, Christian mysticism. The way to identify with the divine is to peel

07:33.600 --> 07:37.440
 back these layers and attempt to discover pure awareness.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.920
 If we look at the universe from a physics perspective, or, you know, I'm a computer

07:41.920 --> 07:53.280
 science person, so if the universe is a computer, there's some sense that God, the creator of the

07:53.280 --> 07:58.960
 universe, or just the computer itself, doesn't know what the heck is going to happen. He just

07:58.960 --> 08:05.680
 kind of creates some basic rules and runs the thing. So, there is some element in which you

08:05.680 --> 08:13.600
 can conceive of humans or conscious beings or intelligent beings as a tool that the creator

08:13.600 --> 08:24.240
 uses to understand himself. Do you think that's a perspective that we could or is useful to take on

08:24.240 --> 08:33.040
 God that is basically the universe created humans to understand itself? He doesn't actually know

08:33.040 --> 08:39.200
 the full thing. He needs the human brains to figure out the puzzle. So, that's in contrasting

08:39.200 --> 08:43.840
 to the unlearning to getting out of the way that we've talked about. It's more like, no,

08:43.840 --> 08:48.880
 we need the humans to figure out this puzzle. Well, we have no answers to this, which is why

08:48.880 --> 08:53.840
 philosophers still have jobs, if they have jobs at all. But, I mean, so the physicists take a look

08:53.840 --> 08:58.480
 at this. Have you seen the article that came out, I think it was this month, in the Journal of

08:58.480 --> 09:04.960
 Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Robert Lanza, the biocentrism theory, the idea that the universe

09:04.960 --> 09:10.080
 comes into being through our observation, right, the whole, the God equation. So, not just in

09:10.080 --> 09:15.680
 quantum mechanics, but in general relativity, the idea that we make the universe moment by moment,

09:15.680 --> 09:21.600
 which is kind of mind blowing, gets into ideas of simulation. Okay, so that's how the physicists,

09:21.600 --> 09:26.080
 at least some of them might look at it. You could also look back to the medieval Christian mystics,

09:26.080 --> 09:34.400
 Meister Eckhart, once again, says that the eye with which I see God is the same eye that sees me,

09:34.400 --> 09:42.320
 right? So, one sight, one knowledge, one love, another mind blowing concept. But this is why

09:42.320 --> 09:46.640
 the arts and poetry and music are so important, because although I love astroparticle physics,

09:47.280 --> 09:51.840
 it's another to kind of hear this, the same message across time.

09:51.840 --> 09:58.720
 Yeah, the simulation thing. I was actually looking this morning at video games, just the statistics

09:58.720 --> 10:05.920
 on video games. And I saw that the two top video games in terms of hours played is Fortnite and

10:05.920 --> 10:13.600
 World of Warcraft. And I saw that it's 140 billion hours, billion hours have been played of those

10:13.600 --> 10:22.320
 games. That's a lot of video games. Yeah, but that's very sophisticated worlds being created,

10:22.320 --> 10:27.360
 especially in the World of Warcraft. It's a massive online role playing game. So you have

10:27.360 --> 10:33.120
 these characters that are together sort of creating a world, but they in themselves are also

10:33.120 --> 10:37.280
 developing, they have all these items, and they're like, they're little humans. Like there's

10:37.280 --> 10:41.760
 complicated societies that are formed, they have goals, they're striving and so on. And it's,

10:41.760 --> 10:48.640
 we're creating a universe within our universe. And for now, it's a kind of, it's a basic sort

10:48.640 --> 10:55.200
 of constraint version of our more richer earth like civilization. But it's conceivable that,

10:55.760 --> 11:02.080
 you know, that we are this thing on earth is a kind of video game that somebody else is playing.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.600
 It's like you can see sort of video games upon video games being created.

11:05.600 --> 11:12.080
 That, and this is something I think a lot about, not from philosophical perspective, but practically,

11:12.080 --> 11:19.920
 how fun does this video game have to be for us to let go of the silly pursuits in this meat space

11:19.920 --> 11:27.280
 that we live in and fully just stay in wow, stay in World of Warcraft, stay in the video game for

11:27.280 --> 11:32.160
 full time. So I think about that from an engineering perspective. Like is there going to be a time

11:32.160 --> 11:39.440
 when this video game is actual real life for us, and then the creatures inside the video game,

11:40.160 --> 11:46.800
 they'll be just borrowing our consciousness, sort of to ground themselves will refer to us as the

11:46.800 --> 11:55.440
 gods. Right? Like, won't we become the gods? This conversation is not going how I expected.

11:55.440 --> 12:00.720
 But I think about this a lot from, you know, because I love video games, and I wonder more

12:00.720 --> 12:06.000
 and more of us, especially in COVID times, are living in the digital world. You could think about

12:06.000 --> 12:10.560
 Twitter and all those kinds of things. You could think about clubhouse people using just voices to

12:10.560 --> 12:15.200
 communicate with little icons, sort of in the digital space, you could see more and more will

12:15.200 --> 12:23.280
 be moving in the digital space and let go of this physical space. And then the remnants of the

12:23.280 --> 12:29.200
 ancients that created the video games, that nobody centuries from now will even remember,

12:29.200 --> 12:34.560
 those will be the gods. And then there'll be gods upon gods being created. This is the kind of stuff

12:34.560 --> 12:40.880
 I think about. But is that any at all useful to you to this thought experiment of a simulation?

12:40.880 --> 12:46.000
 Basically, the fabric of our reality, how did it come to be? What is running this thing? Is that

12:46.000 --> 12:52.880
 useful? Or is it ultimately the project of understanding God, of understanding myth,

12:52.880 --> 12:58.800
 is the project that centers on the human, on the human mind, for you?

12:58.800 --> 13:04.880
 Hmm. We seem to be at the center of this divine dance, which sounds awfully anthropocentric.

13:05.440 --> 13:11.680
 But the ancients thought about this too. I mean, the concept in Sanskrit of lila, that the point

13:11.680 --> 13:17.680
 behind existence is this play, right? It's ultimately playful, this divine dance. It gets

13:17.680 --> 13:25.280
 awfully complicated in the Gnostic and Neoplatonic schools, these chains of being from God head down

13:25.280 --> 13:31.920
 to us, right? Some invisible, right? And we're gonna get into Terence McKenna territory later

13:31.920 --> 13:37.200
 on, but we can start now by talking about discarnate entities and archons and aliens

13:37.200 --> 13:43.040
 and archetypes. I mean, there is a world where Terence McKenna does meet Plato and Gnosticism

13:43.040 --> 13:51.840
 quite kindly, and that's in this invisible college, right? The invisible world with which we seem to

13:51.840 --> 13:58.480
 have some kind of symbiosis that has a higher intent, maybe even a purpose or a plan in mind

13:58.480 --> 14:02.960
 for us. So, I mean, these ideas come across when you've had a heroic dose of mushrooms.

14:03.680 --> 14:08.000
 They also pop up in the ancient philosophical literature, this idea of archons who, you know,

14:08.000 --> 14:16.080
 the puppet masters controlling us flesh and blood beings. It's all a cosmic dance, and there are no

14:16.080 --> 14:20.480
 answers to this. First, who are the archons? And second, what is this world where Terence McKenna

14:20.480 --> 14:25.600
 meets Plato? Do you mean in the space of ideas, or are we talking about some kind of world that

14:25.600 --> 14:29.760
 connects all of consciousness throughout human history? I think through different techniques,

14:29.760 --> 14:33.600
 it is, you know, I think a lot about, I think Gordon Wasson is the meeting point of the two.

14:33.600 --> 14:39.920
 So, Gordon Wasson, who I do talk about in the book, was this J.P. Morgan banker turned

14:39.920 --> 14:46.640
 ethnomycologist, and he's largely credited with the rediscovery of psilocybin containing mushrooms,

14:46.640 --> 14:52.720
 which kind of gave rise to the pop psychedelic revolution of the 1960s. He visited Maria Sabina

14:52.720 --> 14:57.440
 down in Mexico. In his wake went Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, the Stones, and everybody else.

14:58.400 --> 15:03.280
 And the way he describes his psilocybin experience is a bit strange because he thinks of

15:03.280 --> 15:09.840
 Plato, right? And he says that, you know, whereas our ordinary reality is kind of this imperfect

15:09.840 --> 15:15.440
 view of things, Gordon Wasson felt that on mushrooms, he was spying the archetypes.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.680
 And he talks about Plato, and he writes about the archetypes in this famous article that's

15:19.680 --> 15:26.880
 released in 1957 in Life magazine. And so, a well read individual from the mid 20th century has his

15:26.880 --> 15:33.760
 his premier psychedelic experience, and out comes Plato because what he was witnessing was so sharp,

15:33.760 --> 15:40.000
 so brilliant, so detailed, in some sense, more real than real, this noetic sense that William

15:40.000 --> 15:45.360
 James talks about, that when you confront something more real than real, these discarnate

15:45.360 --> 15:52.480
 entities, these images, these visionary motifs, you're tempted to believe that you've tapped into

15:52.480 --> 15:57.920
 the truest nature and the underlying structure of the cosmos. And that's difficult to escape from,

15:57.920 --> 16:01.440
 whether you're Plato or Terence McKenna or Gordon Wasson caught in between.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.720
 Can we talk about this being in touch with something that is more real than real?

16:07.440 --> 16:11.520
 And let's just go straight there to McKenna before we return to the bigger picture.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.080
 So he's talked about the, what is it, self healing machine elves?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.120
 Self transforming.

16:17.120 --> 16:25.200
 Self transforming machine elves during his DMT travels. And I just talked to Rick Doblin,

16:25.200 --> 16:32.800
 who also had different travels to this hyperspace. But they all seem to be traveling on the same

16:32.800 --> 16:37.440
 spaceship, just the different locations. And there is a sense in which they seem to be traveling

16:38.640 --> 16:42.640
 through whatever, I don't know if it's through space time or something else,

16:42.640 --> 16:48.640
 to meet something that is more real than real. What can you say about this DMT experience,

16:48.640 --> 16:54.080
 about Terence McKenna, about the poetry he used, but maybe more specifically about

16:54.080 --> 16:56.400
 this place that they seem to all travel to?

16:57.120 --> 17:01.840
 So the big question is, is it real? Is it really more real than real? The ancient philosophers

17:01.840 --> 17:06.960
 were asking the same question and their means of attempting to answer that was by dying.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.640
 And so if you ask Plato the definition of philosophy, he will say that to practice it

17:12.640 --> 17:19.520
 in the right way is to practice dying and being dead. And many people describe the psychedelic

17:19.520 --> 17:25.280
 experience in sort of near death experience terms. And the encountering of all this visual

17:25.280 --> 17:30.320
 imagery tends to be something that is often described as more real than real. So how does

17:30.320 --> 17:35.680
 Terence talk about this? So I was just listening to the triologues, which folks should look up

17:35.680 --> 17:42.400
 somewhere between 1989 and 1990. Terence sits down with his friends, Ralph Abraham and

17:42.400 --> 17:48.080
 Rupert Sheldrake at Esalen. And they're trying to figure out the meaning of these

17:48.080 --> 17:54.000
 discarnate entities and these nonhuman intelligences. And Terence develops a taxonomy

17:54.000 --> 18:01.040
 for how to analyze this. And he says that number one, they're either semi physical,

18:01.040 --> 18:07.280
 but kind of elusive. So think of the Bigfoot or the Yeti or things like this. Beings that exist

18:07.280 --> 18:14.480
 somewhere between mythology and zoology, which isn't really appropriate here. So option number

18:14.480 --> 18:21.600
 two, he says, is the mental. You're dropping so many good lines. It's so good. I apologize.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.560
 Somewhere between mythology and zoology. This is all Terence McKenna. I take no credit for this.

18:28.560 --> 18:34.320
 But you're combining, you're like, Jimi Hendrix only used the blues scale,

18:34.320 --> 18:39.200
 but he still created something new in the music he played. Anyway, go ahead.

18:39.200 --> 18:48.240
 We're going into Mixolydian right now. So option number two, and this is what Terence calls sort

18:48.240 --> 18:55.360
 of the mentalist reductionist approach. And this is pure McKenna poetry. He says that these beings

18:55.360 --> 19:02.640
 could be autonomous fragments of psychic energy that have temporarily escaped the controlling

19:02.640 --> 19:09.360
 power of the ego. So in Jungian senses, these would just be pure projections, the projections

19:09.360 --> 19:13.840
 of schizophrenics in some cases. So they're essentially unreal. And the third option,

19:13.840 --> 19:19.440
 the most tantalizing, is that they're both nonphysical, but autonomous. In other words,

19:19.440 --> 19:25.680
 they actually exist in some kind of real place, in some kind of real space, and that we can have

19:25.680 --> 19:32.160
 Congress with them. There is communication. He talks about the whisperings of the demon artificers,

19:32.160 --> 19:38.000
 and that it's just possible that our meetings with these beings have coaxed the human species

19:38.560 --> 19:44.960
 into self expression in a very real way, that at different times in history, our relationships with

19:44.960 --> 19:51.600
 these semi autonomous beings may actually guide the species. Now, this is high speculation,

19:52.240 --> 19:59.520
 and Terence and Ralph and Rupert wind up talking about the early modern period and the scientific

19:59.520 --> 20:04.960
 enlightenment, and that even someone like Descartes reports a dream in which he came face

20:04.960 --> 20:11.840
 to face with an angel who said that the conquest of nature is to be achieved through measure and

20:11.840 --> 20:19.120
 number. So even the hard minded materialist like Descartes is confronting these discarnate entities.

20:19.120 --> 20:23.680
 John Dee in the 16th century, the high magician of the Elizabethan court,

20:25.120 --> 20:30.480
 he reports decades worth of what we would say is extraterrestrial communication,

20:30.480 --> 20:37.040
 or interdimensional communication. And you can find instances of this throughout history,

20:37.040 --> 20:42.240
 including among the pre Socratics. And Peter Kingsley writes quite a bit about this, but I'll

20:42.240 --> 20:47.520
 save that until your next question. Well, first of all, we don't seem to understand from where

20:47.520 --> 20:53.360
 intelligence came from. We don't understand from where life came from on Earth. But that we can

20:53.360 --> 20:57.360
 kind of intuit because it's the space of chemistry and biology have good theories about the origins

20:57.360 --> 21:05.120
 of life on Earth. But the origins of intelligent life, that is a giant mystery. And there's some

21:05.120 --> 21:11.680
 sense in which, I mean, I don't know if you know the movie 2001 Space Odyssey. But it does seem

21:11.680 --> 21:17.120
 that there's like important throughout human history, throughout life on Earth, there's

21:17.120 --> 21:26.080
 important phase shifts of it feels like something happened, where there's big leaps. It could be

21:26.080 --> 21:31.120
 something coincidental, like fire and learning how to cook meat and all those kinds of things.

21:31.120 --> 21:36.960
 But it feels like there could be other things. And I think that's at the core of your work is

21:36.960 --> 21:44.960
 exploring what those things could be. Is there, is it possible? Talked about Joe Rogan off line.

21:44.960 --> 21:52.800
 Is it entirely possible? Is it possible that psychedelics have in fact contributed of being

21:52.800 --> 21:59.520
 an important source of those phase shift throughout human history of the intellect, basically steering

21:59.520 --> 22:06.400
 the intellectual development and growth of human civilization. It's a hypothesis worth

22:06.400 --> 22:11.280
 investigating. How about that? Beautiful. And maybe not psychedelics in and of themselves,

22:11.280 --> 22:17.040
 but I think our whole conversation is kind of wrapped up in these non ordinary states of

22:17.040 --> 22:23.680
 awareness. We start by talking about God, which is something unordinary and expansive. And I think

22:23.680 --> 22:31.840
 that as you trace the intervention of divinity, if that's the case, throughout human history,

22:31.840 --> 22:38.560
 you have to bump up against the irrational. And Mursi Eliade, the great scholar of religions and

22:38.560 --> 22:44.320
 fellow Romanian said that the history of religions essentially constitutes the point of intersection

22:44.320 --> 22:51.840
 between metaphysics and biology. So that we are biological beings who do interact with our planet,

22:51.840 --> 22:57.840
 with the natural kingdom. And you would think that as, you know, early archaic ecologists,

22:57.840 --> 23:04.240
 we would have figured out what plants work, which fungi don't and developed maybe language around

23:04.240 --> 23:11.360
 that. And so this is another one of McKenna's speculative, but very interesting hypotheses,

23:11.360 --> 23:17.920
 the stone and ape theory. Is it possible that psychedelics were involved in one of the several

23:17.920 --> 23:23.760
 leaps forward? You mentioned the word leap. Jared Diamond talks about the great leap forward 60,000

23:23.760 --> 23:28.560
 years ago. The species had been around for a couple hundred thousand years. All of a sudden,

23:28.560 --> 23:34.000
 the cave painting appears. All of a sudden there's a phase shift. Did something like that happen

23:34.000 --> 23:38.640
 millions of years ago? And I love the way Paul Stamets talks about this. It would be the ingestion

23:39.280 --> 23:47.040
 of perhaps psilocybin containing fungi millions and millions of times over millions and millions

23:47.040 --> 23:52.400
 of years. So it's not just a one time event that cascades, but it's the accumulation

23:52.960 --> 23:59.920
 of psychedelic experience. It's really difficult to test that hypothesis. But I've been talking

23:59.920 --> 24:06.160
 with a paleoanthropologist in South Africa, my friend Lee Berger, about ways that we might test

24:06.160 --> 24:12.400
 for this. And so Lee, amongst many things, is this national geographic explorer. He's the

24:12.400 --> 24:18.000
 paleoanthropologist's paleoanthropologist at the University of Witwatersrand. He's famous,

24:18.000 --> 24:22.720
 amongst other things, for the discovery of previously undiscovered hominids like Homo

24:22.720 --> 24:33.280
 naledi. And there's an interesting point. So naledi is this archaic hominid, morphologically

24:33.280 --> 24:39.920
 archaic, but it dates to about 300,000 years ago, which is very strange. What's even more

24:39.920 --> 24:44.800
 strange about Homo naledi at the Rising Star cave system there in South Africa is that Lee

24:44.800 --> 24:50.640
 believes he's discovered the first bipedal ape deliberately disposing of its dead.

24:51.680 --> 24:58.400
 So there is a recognition of self mortality and the practicing of rituals around death. We're

24:58.400 --> 25:05.840
 talking about burials. And if you have burials, says Lee, in an archaic hominid 300,000 years ago,

25:05.840 --> 25:10.320
 maybe you have language. And I mentioned that because Terence McKenna was obsessed

25:10.320 --> 25:16.720
 with language in the stoned ape theory, that the ingestion of psilocybin in addition to enhancing

25:16.720 --> 25:22.480
 visual acuity, perhaps facilitating sexual arousal, leads to proto language.

25:23.280 --> 25:30.240
 Now, isn't it interesting, this could be entirely a coincidence, that the largest sound inventory

25:30.240 --> 25:37.680
 of any language is the Khoisan of Botswana and Namibia. They have something like 164 consonants

25:37.680 --> 25:43.280
 and 44 vowels. English, by comparison, has about 45. So I don't know what to make of this, but what

25:43.280 --> 25:50.480
 you find in that part of the world is very, very complex language. Language that could be an

25:50.480 --> 25:56.480
 inheritance, language that could be incredibly archaic, together with this recognition of self

25:56.480 --> 26:01.440
 mortality. And when I talk to Lee Berger, we say, when you're looking at universals like that,

26:01.440 --> 26:07.440
 language around all human populations, the recognition of self mortality, the contemplation

26:07.440 --> 26:12.480
 of death, just maybe you have pharmacology. And so maybe we can go out and test for this

26:13.200 --> 26:18.560
 using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, proteomics, technology that doesn't even exist,

26:18.560 --> 26:23.600
 but maybe we can actually test the stoned ape theory to figure out once and for all,

26:23.600 --> 26:27.680
 if there's any merit there. Can you just linger a little bit on the pharmacology tools?

26:27.680 --> 26:34.800
 Like how would it be possible to say something about what was being ingested so, so long ago?

26:34.800 --> 26:43.680
 That's what I asked Dr. Berger. So Lee has discovered in the dental calculus of archaic

26:43.680 --> 26:50.800
 hominids. Dental calculus. I like this. Evidence of their diet. And you might not believe how old

26:50.800 --> 26:57.760
 this was, but in sedeba, Australopithecus sedeba, they found evidence of sedeba's diet going back

26:57.760 --> 27:04.480
 two million years. So through things like phytoliths, which are essentially fossilized

27:04.480 --> 27:12.240
 plant tissue, they found evidence that sedeba was eating bark and leaves and grasses and fruits and

27:12.240 --> 27:18.080
 palm. So no psychedelics to speak of, but it just goes to show that through things like dental

27:18.080 --> 27:23.040
 microwear analysis and other techniques that we're still developing, we can actually figure out what

27:23.040 --> 27:29.040
 the diet was at the time. I'll fast forward to 50,000 years ago. There was another study out of

27:29.040 --> 27:34.800
 El Cidrón Cave in 2012, which found that Neanderthals, again, preceding our species

27:34.800 --> 27:41.760
 50,000 years ago, were ingesting yarrow and chamomile, which had been identified as medicinal.

27:41.760 --> 27:47.360
 So again, not psychedelic or psychoactive, but we kind of have the beginnings of the technology,

27:47.360 --> 27:53.840
 and that was nine years ago, to begin figuring out the ancestral diet of these hominids.

27:53.840 --> 27:59.120
 Presumably there could be a way to figure out, it's not just diet, but which have psychoactive

27:59.120 --> 28:03.200
 elements to them. So whether you're chewing it, whether you're smoking it, whether, I mean, I don't

28:03.200 --> 28:08.800
 know, licking it. I don't know if there's any kind of ways through the dental calculus to figure out

28:09.440 --> 28:15.200
 what exact substances were being consumed. Is it possible to figure out whether psychedelic

28:15.200 --> 28:21.040
 substances are being consumed by looking at human behavior, like you said, organized burials

28:22.640 --> 28:28.240
 or cave paintings? No, but so that's a little bit of a stretch to say, like, where did this

28:28.240 --> 28:34.160
 leap come from? But it's not. It's not. So just last fall, as a matter of fact, so that notion

28:34.160 --> 28:38.160
 has been out there for a while, the idea that hallucinogens and the ritual consumption of

28:38.160 --> 28:43.760
 hallucinogens were somehow related to the great leap forward, were somehow related to the initial

28:43.760 --> 28:48.080
 cave painting. Graham Hancock wrote a beautiful book about this called Supernatural, which in

28:48.080 --> 28:53.840
 many ways like sent me down this rabbit hole back in 2007. But even at the time when he was writing

28:53.840 --> 29:01.440
 that and the year subsequent, it was still kind of seen as a kooky idea. Last fall, interestingly

29:01.440 --> 29:08.720
 enough, the first archeochemical data for the ritual consumption of psychedelics associated with

29:08.720 --> 29:13.920
 cave art was finally published. It's not that ancient. It's only about 400 or 500 years ago,

29:13.920 --> 29:19.680
 but it came from the Pinwheel Cave, a Chumash site in California. And what they found were

29:19.680 --> 29:24.720
 datura quids, like these chewed up, you mentioned, how did they ingest it? These chewed up quids,

29:24.720 --> 29:31.280
 like these bunches of datura, which contain these very powerful tropane alkaloids and what was

29:31.280 --> 29:37.200
 believed to be some kind of Chumash initiation site. So we can say that there is initial

29:37.200 --> 29:42.160
 archeochemical data for the consumption of psychedelics and cave art. And so where else

29:42.160 --> 29:50.000
 might we find this? Are there a lot of archeochemists in the world? Is this fascinating? Is through

29:50.000 --> 29:56.320
 chemistry, through biology, through physics, whatever, like all the disciplines, perhaps one

29:56.320 --> 30:04.320
 day computer science, we apply those tools to study not the data of today, but the data of the past.

30:04.320 --> 30:09.040
 But are we talking about dozens here? Like how hard is this problem relative to how many people

30:09.040 --> 30:15.120
 are taking it on just as a side little tangent? We're probably talking more dozens than hundreds.

30:16.080 --> 30:21.040
 I spent many years trying to track down an archeochemist who would talk to me. There were

30:21.040 --> 30:27.520
 a couple, Pat McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania, and then my friend Andrew Ko at MIT,

30:27.520 --> 30:33.200
 which you might know something about. Andrew really, you know, on his own time, on his own

30:33.200 --> 30:41.440
 dime, has been gathering the data for this organic residue analysis. He has what's called the Open

30:41.440 --> 30:46.880
 Archem Project, which is this online open source repository for this data. But there's never been

30:46.880 --> 30:52.960
 a center for this. No university has stood up a dedicated center, a team really, which is what you

30:52.960 --> 30:57.520
 need of archeochemists looking at this stuff. But I mean, even despite that, there have been some

30:57.520 --> 31:02.320
 remarkable discoveries over the past 10, 20 years. It's still a discipline very much in

31:02.320 --> 31:09.440
 its infancy. Maybe it's becoming a toddler. But as the technology gets better and cheaper, I hope

31:09.440 --> 31:12.480
 you'll see more and more archeochemists joining the fight.

31:12.480 --> 31:18.960
 Yeah. And Andrew is fascinating. His work is fascinating. But also, just because of your work,

31:18.960 --> 31:24.880
 I came across and exchanged a few emails with Patrick McGovern, who's basically, what would

31:24.880 --> 31:30.880
 you call him? So, he has a center, I guess, that does biomolecular archeology at UPenn.

31:30.880 --> 31:36.800
 And he's the author of a bunch of books, one of which is Ancient Brews. So, he's a scholar of beer

31:36.800 --> 31:42.560
 and wine and like ancient alcohol, which is fascinating. They influence, even just alcohol,

31:42.560 --> 31:50.720
 but he has like alcohol with hallucinogenic properties as well. But as a Russian, it's

31:50.720 --> 31:58.640
 fascinating to think about the influence of alcohol on the development of human civilization

31:58.640 --> 32:05.600
 throughout its history. Is there something you can comment on alcohol or in general,

32:07.120 --> 32:13.680
 Patrick's work that was informative to you, inspiring, or kind of added to your conception

32:13.680 --> 32:15.280
 of human history?

32:15.280 --> 32:20.880
 His work was some of the first hard scientific data that I saw for the ritual consumption

32:20.880 --> 32:27.440
 of these intoxicants. I don't think he's ever found the hard and fast data for psychedelics.

32:27.440 --> 32:33.040
 But what he turned me on to was this idea that alcohol or beer and wine specifically

32:33.520 --> 32:37.520
 could have been used as vehicles for the administration of psychedelics. That's where

32:37.520 --> 32:43.280
 it all started for me. Just the notion that ancient beer and ancient wine is very, very

32:43.280 --> 32:48.880
 different from what we drink today, that typically they were cocktails. They were often fortified

32:48.880 --> 32:55.280
 and mixed with different fruits, berries, herbs, plants, maybe even fungi over time,

32:55.280 --> 33:00.800
 because this was all in the absence of distilled liquor. There is no hard alcohol, even in

33:00.800 --> 33:08.000
 Russia, before maybe the 12th century it was in Europe, maybe a bit earlier. But the concept

33:08.000 --> 33:15.040
 of distillation just didn't exist. And so, to pack a punch, rather than just drink a

33:15.040 --> 33:20.640
 kind of watered down Budweiser, these people were interested in fortifying these beverages

33:20.640 --> 33:25.920
 with whatever they could find in nature. And Pat, to his credit, found some of the initial

33:25.920 --> 33:31.200
 data for these, you could say, spiked wines and spiked beers. Not with anything overtly

33:31.200 --> 33:38.080
 psychedelic, but just the fact that in the 16th century BC, at grave circle A in Mycenae,

33:38.080 --> 33:43.040
 there's this Minoan ritual cocktail of beer mixed with wine, mixed with mead, is very

33:43.040 --> 33:48.320
 interesting. It's even more interesting that you find that across the Aegean, in Gordium,

33:48.320 --> 33:54.560
 at King Midas's tomb, right? The same kind of ritual cocktail, which Pat and Sam at the

33:54.560 --> 33:59.040
 Dogfish Head Brewery resurrected as the Midas touch. So, I mean, the notion that we can

33:59.040 --> 34:05.280
 go back, find this data, resurrect it, in some cases, 2800 years later, I found pretty

34:05.280 --> 34:11.520
 exciting 10 years ago. Yeah, bring it back for research. But that's fascinating that

34:11.520 --> 34:16.880
 people are playing with these ideas. And we'll return to, we'll return to our

34:16.880 --> 34:22.080
 ideas of psychedelic infused wine, which is pretty fascinating. But can we step back and

34:22.080 --> 34:27.440
 just kind of look at your work with the book Immortality Key? What is the story that you

34:27.440 --> 34:35.440
 tell in this book? I knew we'd get there eventually, Lex. It's a nonlinear path. Somehow

34:35.440 --> 34:40.400
 we were talking about simulation and the universe is a computer that's creating video games

34:40.400 --> 34:48.080
 and WoW and Fortnite. But we got there and we'll return, always, to the insane philosophical.

34:48.080 --> 34:53.680
 But your book Immortality Key, what's the story that you tell in this book? Which part

34:53.680 --> 34:57.840
 of human history are you studying? Right. So that's the way to phrase it. So it's, you

34:57.840 --> 35:04.480
 know, it's my 12 year search for the hard scientific data for the ritual use of psychedelics

35:04.480 --> 35:09.120
 in classical antiquity. So we're talking about amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans.

35:09.120 --> 35:15.680
 And the paleo Christians. So the generations that would give birth to the largest religion

35:15.680 --> 35:20.000
 the world's ever known. Christianity today was two and a half billion people. The big

35:20.000 --> 35:23.920
 question for me is, you know, were psychedelics actually involved? There was a lot written

35:23.920 --> 35:29.840
 about this in the sixties, John Marco Allegro. The book that I follow was published in 1978

35:29.840 --> 35:35.040
 before I was born. The Road to Eleusis by Gordon Wasson, who we talked about already,

35:35.040 --> 35:40.960
 Albert Hofmann, who famously discovers LSD or synthesizes it from ergot, and Carl Ruck,

35:41.680 --> 35:48.000
 who is still a professor of classics at Boston University, the only surviving member of that

35:48.000 --> 35:55.200
 renegade trio and now 85 years old. So this all predates us. But what was lacking in the 60s,

35:55.200 --> 36:01.040
 70s, 80s, 90s, I think was some of this technology and the hard scientific data.

36:01.040 --> 36:05.760
 Now, for years and years, I went out to the archaeobotanists and the archaeochemists around

36:05.760 --> 36:11.520
 the world and I asked a very basic question. Is there any evidence for psychedelics in classical

36:11.520 --> 36:17.040
 antiquity? And the answer would almost invariably come back no. I'm talking to, in addition to Pat,

36:17.040 --> 36:22.000
 he put me in touch with Hans Peter Sticke in Germany, Tania Valamotti in Greece,

36:22.000 --> 36:26.880
 Assunta Florenzano in Italy. I went all over the place asking one question and getting the same

36:26.880 --> 36:32.960
 answer back time and again. And so the book is essentially my search for that data and

36:32.960 --> 36:41.760
 the eventual uncovering of two what I think are key pieces of data. One data point shows the ritual

36:41.760 --> 36:48.640
 use of a psychedelic beer in classical antiquity in Iberia, what today is Spain. And the other

36:48.640 --> 36:55.440
 shows what looks like a kind of psychedelic wine just outside Pompeii from the first century AD,

36:55.440 --> 37:00.400
 at the right place at the right time when the earliest Christians were showing up in Italy.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.760
 Again, these are early steps in the search for evidence in the space. But

37:07.840 --> 37:15.360
 speaking of early Christians, what role do you think psychedelic infused wine could have played

37:15.360 --> 37:27.600
 in the life of Jesus Christ? I've been saying recently that, and I hope this doesn't sound

37:28.160 --> 37:36.000
 obscurantist, but I think it's impossible to understand Jesus and the birth of Christianity

37:36.000 --> 37:40.720
 in the absence of ancient Greek. And I'll give you a very specific example of why I think that's the

37:40.720 --> 37:49.280
 case. You can read the entire New Testament in ancient Greek and not once will you ever find

37:49.280 --> 37:55.120
 a reference to alcohol because there was no word in ancient Greek for alcohol. The way the word

37:55.120 --> 38:01.840
 sounds alcohol, it's Semitic, it comes from the Arabic. Kehela means to enliven or refresh. It

38:01.840 --> 38:07.760
 probably comes from kohl, K O H L, sort of these powdered metallics that were used in alchemical

38:07.760 --> 38:13.520
 experiments and cosmetics. So again, that's much later in time when we're using alchemy,

38:13.520 --> 38:21.280
 distillation, et cetera. In the first century AD, the power of wine wasn't necessarily tied to

38:21.280 --> 38:26.720
 alcohol, fermented grapes, the way we think about wine today. So Pat McGovern found some of that

38:26.720 --> 38:34.720
 early organic data for wine being mixed with beer and with mead. But if you look at the literature

38:34.720 --> 38:39.440
 from the first century AD, Dioscorides, for example, he writes this massive treatise at the

38:39.440 --> 38:45.600
 exact same time the gospels are being written. And Dioscorides in just one of his books talks about

38:45.600 --> 38:53.520
 56 detailed recipes for spiking wine with all kinds of things like salvia and hellebore and

38:53.520 --> 38:58.880
 frankincense and myrrh, these spice perfumes, but also more dangerous things like henbane

38:58.880 --> 39:05.360
 and mandrake, which he says in Greek can be fatal with just one cupful. And in book 474 of his

39:05.360 --> 39:14.560
 Materia Medica, he talks about black nightshade producing fantasias u aedais, not unpleasant

39:14.560 --> 39:20.560
 visions, what today we would say is psychedelic. So just looking at the literature and the kind of

39:20.560 --> 39:25.040
 literature that even most classicists, I didn't really learn it in undergrad, I came across

39:25.040 --> 39:32.880
 Dioscorides later, but just a basic look at the literature supports what McGovern has been testing,

39:32.880 --> 39:38.560
 which is the fact that wine was routinely mixed with different compounds. It's fascinating,

39:38.560 --> 39:44.800
 by the way, that language affects our conception of the tools we use to understand the world. So

39:44.800 --> 39:56.720
 like you can see wine, you can see psychedelics, if they're not called drugs, you can maybe reframe

39:57.840 --> 40:02.240
 how you see them in terms of their role in us thinking about the world, understanding the

40:02.240 --> 40:06.320
 world. That's really interesting that language has that power, but what language was used to

40:06.320 --> 40:11.840
 understand wine at the time? So we're talking about a Greek speaking world, right? So Jesus

40:11.840 --> 40:16.880
 is born and does his public ministry in the Holy Land, but think about the early church,

40:16.880 --> 40:22.160
 think about where the church takes root. Paul, the greatest evangelist of the time, writes basically

40:22.160 --> 40:27.920
 half the New Testament, he's writing letters in Greek to Greek speakers in places like Corinth

40:28.480 --> 40:35.520
 in Greece, or Philippi, a defunct city just north of the island of Thassos, or he's writing to folks

40:35.520 --> 40:40.560
 in what today is Turkey, the Colossians, the Galatians, he writes letters to the Romans.

40:40.560 --> 40:46.000
 These are Greek speakers in these pockets, these Hellenic pockets all around the ancient

40:46.000 --> 40:51.680
 Mediterranean. And for them, again, ignore Dioscorides, ignore Pat McGovern's work,

40:51.680 --> 40:58.240
 to them to think about wine was to think about a mixed potion. And so the word oinos in ancient

40:58.240 --> 41:02.880
 Greek does show up in the New Testament, but there was another word to describe wine,

41:02.880 --> 41:08.880
 and it exists for like a thousand years before, during, and after the life of Jesus. The word

41:08.880 --> 41:14.400
 used for wine is pharmakon, which obviously gives us the word pharmacy, it means drug.

41:14.400 --> 41:20.400
 So in Greek, a Greek speaker would actually use the word drug to refer to wine. Ruth Skodel,

41:20.400 --> 41:27.920
 the classicist, talks about this as a ritualistic formula. They understood wine as this compound

41:27.920 --> 41:35.920
 beverage, a drug against grief, a medicinal elixir that could either harm or heal, or just maybe a

41:35.920 --> 41:45.840
 sacrament to put you in touch with wine gods old and new. Clearly, religion and myth, but religion

41:45.840 --> 41:55.840
 very much so has sort of a, much like dreams, has like an imagery component. Like you're kind of

41:55.840 --> 42:04.160
 going outside the visual constraints of physical space where you kind of have very specific

42:04.160 --> 42:11.120
 conceptions of what things look like, and you kind of use your imagination to stretch beyond

42:11.120 --> 42:16.240
 the world as we know it. Things that are trying to get in touch with things that are more real

42:16.240 --> 42:26.320
 than real. What role do these tools, do these pharmakons have in trying to stimulate the imagery

42:26.320 --> 42:32.160
 of religion? Do you have a sense that they have a critical role here, or is it just a bunch of

42:32.160 --> 42:36.800
 different factors that are utilized, a bunch of different tools that are utilized to construct

42:36.800 --> 42:41.600
 this imagery? Or is this not even, or is imagery the wrong terminology? Is it more like space of

42:41.600 --> 42:48.480
 ideas that's core to religion? No, I think the wine is absolutely essential. And so, if it's

42:48.480 --> 42:53.600
 impossible to understand paleo Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek, I think it's equally

42:53.600 --> 43:00.640
 difficult in the absence of the sacred pharmacopeia or wine itself, right? Just think about wine

43:00.640 --> 43:05.680
 at the time. I think that the ancient Greek audience would have heard that in a very different

43:05.680 --> 43:11.840
 way from us. And so, they're referring to it maybe as a pharmakon, but the followers of Dionysus,

43:11.840 --> 43:18.240
 which precedes Jesus. And in some cases, the story of Jesus is kind of a recapitulation of the

43:18.240 --> 43:23.520
 mysteries of Dionysus. But when you think about Dionysus, maybe from your high school mythology,

43:23.520 --> 43:28.400
 you think about him as the god of theater, or the god of wine, which is typically what it is,

43:28.400 --> 43:38.000
 or the god of ecstasy. Again, Dionysus is not the god of alcohol. There's no concept of fermented

43:38.000 --> 43:42.400
 grapes. The power of Dionysus and the ability to commune with Dionysus through his blood.

43:43.200 --> 43:49.440
 And before Christianity, the blood of Dionysus is equated to his wine. The sacramental drinking of

43:49.440 --> 43:55.040
 the wine was interpreted, and classicists write about this, including Walter Burkert. It was

43:55.040 --> 44:00.720
 it was interpreted as consuming the god himself in order to become one with the god. This is where we

44:00.720 --> 44:06.400
 get the idea of enthusiasm, because the language matters. Enthusiasm to be filled with the spirit

44:06.400 --> 44:11.680
 of the god, so that you became identified with Dionysus and acquired his divine powers.

44:11.680 --> 44:16.240
 Now, how does that happen? Again, he's not the god of alcohol. He is the god of wine,

44:16.240 --> 44:22.880
 but he's really the god of madness, and delirium, and frenzy. And his principal followers are women.

44:22.880 --> 44:27.520
 They're called the minads. And the way they get in touch with him is through the consumption

44:27.520 --> 44:34.880
 of this sacramental wine. Even at the theater of Dionysus, separate from his outdoor churches,

44:34.880 --> 44:40.400
 there was a wine served there called drima. And this is the wine that gives birth to Hollywood.

44:40.400 --> 44:44.160
 I mean, the ancient Hollywood was there at the theater of Dionysus. This is where

44:44.160 --> 44:48.960
 comedy, and tragedy, and poetry, and music come from. But rather than a hot dog and a beer,

44:48.960 --> 44:53.760
 what they drink at the theater of Dionysus was this wine called drima, which means

44:53.760 --> 44:58.560
 pounded or rubbed. And Professor Ruck talks about maybe it was the drugs

44:58.560 --> 45:04.880
 that were rubbed into this theatrical beverage to help the play come alive.

45:04.880 --> 45:13.280
 So madness is seen as a positive thing, as like a creative journey. It's not, what is it,

45:13.280 --> 45:20.560
 the unlearning, getting out of the way kind of thing. Is that how it's seen? Or is it more like

45:20.560 --> 45:31.840
 entertaining escape from life that is suffering? I gotta inject a little modern Dostoevsky into the old.

45:31.840 --> 45:39.200
 Existential despair. Maybe it's a bit of that. We can't say that there wasn't

45:39.200 --> 45:46.080
 recreational drinking happening. The Greeks also had the symposium. And they also were just

45:46.080 --> 45:53.280
 getting hammered in some cases. But when it comes to the rites of Dionysus, what you see there is

45:54.480 --> 46:00.960
 the creation of these states of awareness in which, again, you identify with the God to become

46:00.960 --> 46:06.640
 the God. There's theophagy. There's the consumption of divinity in order to become divinity. Right

46:06.640 --> 46:12.480
 back to how we started the conversation, right? So if we stop conceiving of God as something

46:12.480 --> 46:18.480
 exterior to us, but that the mystery of being itself is the mystery of your being and the

46:18.480 --> 46:24.640
 mystery of my being, that the way to encounter that is through the sacramental theology, that

46:24.640 --> 46:31.520
 you drink the actual blood of this Greek God to become that God. And there was a place for this

46:31.520 --> 46:37.360
 in ancient Greek society. So drinking the wine and drinking the blood of Dionysus, do you think Jesus

46:38.480 --> 46:45.840
 is an actual physical person that existed in history? Or is he an idea

46:47.040 --> 46:54.000
 that came to life through the consumption of wine and those kinds of rituals?

46:54.000 --> 46:57.360
 So this is where I face my excommunication, depending how I answer this.

46:57.360 --> 47:03.200
 I mean, you're playing with fire and wine.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.240
 A good combination, by the way.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.400
 So I shy away from that controversy in the book. I'm perfectly willing to accept Jesus

47:14.400 --> 47:19.440
 as a historical personage. We have the multiplicity of sources, although it's a

47:19.440 --> 47:25.280
 generation after his death. But we have the Eucharist being described in the four gospels.

47:25.280 --> 47:31.040
 We have it being described by Paul in 1 Corinthians. But when you read John,

47:31.040 --> 47:35.280
 it does read a bit differently than the other gospels. And in my book, I rely a lot on the

47:35.280 --> 47:40.000
 scholarship of Dennis McDonald, who writes a fabulous book called The Dionysian Gospel.

47:40.560 --> 47:45.120
 And this is, again, why the Greek matters, because once you start to analyze the Greek of John's

47:45.120 --> 47:51.520
 gospel, it seems to be a presentation of Jesus very much in the guise of Dionysus. The most

47:51.520 --> 47:57.280
 obvious example is the wedding at Cana, right? That only occurs in John's gospel, the famous

47:57.280 --> 48:02.000
 transformation of water into wine. Now, again, to any Greek speaker of the first century,

48:02.000 --> 48:07.600
 they would have known about the Greek district of Elis on the Peloponnese. And in Elis,

48:07.600 --> 48:14.080
 around the epiphany, every January, the priests of Dionysus would deposit these water basins,

48:14.080 --> 48:19.760
 empty basins in the temple of Dionysus. They'd return the next morning and find them magically

48:19.760 --> 48:25.360
 filled with wine. Now, on the island of Andros, it's even more interesting. Around the same

48:25.360 --> 48:31.760
 epiphany date, the God's gift day, Dies Theodosia, the wine would emanate from the temple and run

48:31.760 --> 48:37.440
 like a river for a week. And you can Google the Bacchanal of the Andrians, a wonderful painting

48:37.440 --> 48:42.080
 by Titian, which hangs in the Prado, and you'll see a river of wine behind these people having

48:42.080 --> 48:47.520
 a great time. This exists for centuries and centuries before the wedding at Cana and before

48:47.520 --> 48:55.040
 Jesus begins his public ministry with what these scholars call the signature miracle of Dionysus.

48:55.040 --> 49:00.880
 It would not have been lost on the Greek audience that something very specific is being communicated

49:00.880 --> 49:07.120
 here. What's being communicated? That you just might find in early Christianity what you hold

49:07.120 --> 49:11.760
 strong to in these mysteries of Dionysus that you may have inherited from your parents, your

49:11.760 --> 49:16.480
 grandparents, your great grandparents for centuries. There was a perfectly good religion.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.400
 There were perfectly good mystery cults in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds.

49:20.400 --> 49:27.040
 And here comes this new, untested, illegal cult, illegal, of a dozen or so illiterate

49:27.040 --> 49:32.400
 day laborers that go on to convert the empire in a few hundred years. The answer to that

49:33.440 --> 49:38.320
 extraordinary growth is not psychedelics, but I do think it's visionary experiences,

49:38.320 --> 49:42.800
 and I do think it's this continuity from the pagan world into early Christianity.

49:42.800 --> 49:47.200
 So what part, you mentioned this idea that's really interesting with, I think you said Paul

49:47.200 --> 49:56.800
 Stamets, of I guess millions of people over millions of years kind of consuming, really

49:56.800 --> 50:02.000
 practicing a ritual or a habit of some sort. This idea of rituals is kind of interesting.

50:02.800 --> 50:08.640
 Again, you mentioned cult. What's the role of ritual consumption of some of these substances

50:08.640 --> 50:15.760
 or just ritual practice of anything in the intellectual growth of particular groups of

50:15.760 --> 50:22.160
 people or societies? So again, I would say it is the centerpiece of ancient life, not just the

50:22.160 --> 50:27.040
 mysteries of Dionysus, which we've only talked a bit about, but the mysteries of Eleusis were

50:27.040 --> 50:32.240
 probably the most famous and longest lasting of these Greek mystery rites. And I mean, just to

50:32.240 --> 50:37.040
 put it in simple terms, the best definition for a mystery religion, as the name implies,

50:37.040 --> 50:42.880
 is something secret, right? Muo from the Greek means to shut the eyes or to shut the mouth,

50:42.880 --> 50:49.840
 to keep quiet about this stuff. We're always teasing details from the archaeological and the

50:49.840 --> 50:56.240
 literary record, and we're kind of just grabbing at these secrets. But Eleusis, which survives for

50:56.240 --> 51:02.480
 like 2,000 years into the Christian period from about 1500 BC to the fourth century AD,

51:02.480 --> 51:08.160
 it's kind of this centerpiece of Greek life. Cicero, the great Roman statesman, calls what was

51:08.160 --> 51:15.120
 happening at Eleusis the most exceptional and divine thing that Athens ever produced. So not

51:15.120 --> 51:21.200
 democracy, the arts and sciences, or philosophy, but the vision that was encountered at Eleusis,

51:21.200 --> 51:27.680
 perhaps through the ritual consumption of a potent psychedelic over hundreds and hundreds of years,

51:27.680 --> 51:32.960
 hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands and thousands, if not millions of initiates, pilgrims,

51:32.960 --> 51:38.160
 who would walk from Athens to Eleusis to encounter this vision. It seems to have been

51:39.120 --> 51:43.120
 not just an important part of Greek life, but the thing that made life livable,

51:43.680 --> 51:49.040
 such that as these mysteries are about to be exterminated by the newly Christianized

51:49.040 --> 51:53.920
 Roman Empire, there's this passage in the ancient literature that talks about these,

51:53.920 --> 51:58.080
 you know, in the absence of these mysteries, life becomes unlivable. Abiotos.

51:58.720 --> 52:03.440
 Is there ways you can, I mean, you write about the mysteries of Eleusis, and is there ways you

52:03.440 --> 52:11.520
 can convert that into words? Why those are so important to them, more important than any other

52:11.520 --> 52:19.520
 invention to them? Why is it such a source of meaning to life? So from what we can reconstruct,

52:19.520 --> 52:25.120
 they would make that pilgrimage 13 miles northwest of Athens to confront their mortality. Remember,

52:25.120 --> 52:30.160
 we were talking about Homo Naledi, and in South Africa, this recognition of self mortality,

52:31.280 --> 52:38.080
 the deliberate disposal of the dead. Plato talks about the real practice of philosophy being the

52:38.080 --> 52:45.200
 death and dying process. So in some senses, you went to Eleusis to die and to experience a death

52:45.200 --> 52:50.080
 before your death. We talked about this with Terence McKenna as well, on this, how the

52:50.080 --> 52:55.840
 psychedelic state seems to share something in common with the near death or out of body experiences

52:55.840 --> 53:01.120
 or these ecstatic experiences, whether through wine or beer or otherwise, you went to Eleusis

53:01.120 --> 53:07.360
 to die. And it was said that only those who had witnessed this vision, whatever vision was to be

53:07.360 --> 53:14.080
 witnessed in Demeter Sanctuary, it essentially vouchsafed you the afterlife, that only those who

53:14.080 --> 53:21.280
 went there became immortal. And Cicero says that at that point, you essentially live with more joy

53:21.280 --> 53:27.520
 and die with a better hope. Can I ask you a question about this human contention with death,

53:27.520 --> 53:34.000
 this confrontation of death that seems to be at the core of things? I don't know how deep to the

53:34.000 --> 53:41.920
 core, but it seems to be a central element of the human condition. What do you think about Ernest

53:41.920 --> 53:51.840
 Becker and those guys that put death at the, what is it, the warm of the core, which as the main

53:51.840 --> 53:58.640
 thing, the main, like this confrontation of our own mortality, first of all, being understanding

53:58.640 --> 54:06.400
 that we're mortal and then confronting the terror of it, the fear of it as the creative, like trying

54:06.400 --> 54:13.200
 to escape the fear of death as the creative force of human society. It's like the reason we do

54:13.200 --> 54:21.760
 anything is because we're just running away from our death, scared. Do you find some of that to be

54:21.760 --> 54:27.200
 true, first of all, as somebody who looks in the mirror, looks at yourself and your own as a human

54:27.200 --> 54:34.080
 being, two, just looking at society today, and three, at this whole big spread of human history

54:34.080 --> 54:39.920
 and all the cool stuff we've created, including the mysteries of Eleusis? I wonder what life would

54:39.920 --> 54:46.880
 look like in the absence of the fear of our mortality. I wonder how we'd interact with one

54:46.880 --> 54:52.400
 another if there was relatively little or no fear of death. I really do when it comes to Becker's

54:52.400 --> 54:58.480
 work and others. If the ancients were known for anything, it was running to death. It was the

54:58.480 --> 55:02.640
 opposite. In fact, dying before dying, which is the immortality key, by the way, it's not

55:02.640 --> 55:07.280
 psychedelics. When I refer to this key, I'm referring to this notion that's preserved in

55:07.280 --> 55:15.120
 Greek, anpethanis, prinpethanis, denthapethanis, otanpethanis. If you die before you die, you won't

55:15.120 --> 55:22.480
 die when you die. For some reason, the ancients prized that experience. And we talked about the

55:22.480 --> 55:29.520
 mystics of Sufism and Kabbalism and Christian mysticism, where you have this same self nodding,

55:29.520 --> 55:34.640
 this death before death, the divine nothingness, right? For some reason, the mystic saints,

55:34.640 --> 55:40.160
 visionaries, and ancient philosophers, they ran to death. And the one message I wanted to try and

55:40.160 --> 55:46.400
 communicate with this book is how they viewed life, that it can only be fully experienced,

55:46.400 --> 55:55.120
 fully embodied in the wake of a really intense, perhaps terrifying, but utterly transformational

55:55.120 --> 56:02.720
 encounter with death. So running to death, not running away from death. You talk about Aldous

56:02.720 --> 56:13.600
 Huxley and mind changers. So if we look at the history where the ancients were running to death

56:13.600 --> 56:23.200
 and maybe using some performance enhancing permacons to run more effectively towards death,

56:23.200 --> 56:31.680
 and now we're using tools of modern society, whether they're psychological, sociological,

56:31.680 --> 56:39.600
 or in case pharmaceutical to run away from this conception. So what do you see as a hopeful future

56:39.600 --> 56:48.000
 for human civilization? If all of these kinds of societies are ice cream flavors,

56:48.000 --> 56:53.520
 how do you create the perfect ice cream flavor? What is the future of religious experience,

56:53.520 --> 56:59.680
 of psychedelic experience, of intellectual journeys, of facing death, running away from death?

57:00.240 --> 57:05.600
 What do you hope that looks like and what kind of ideas should we look to?

57:05.600 --> 57:11.920
 My next book will be entitled Performance Enhancing Pharmacon. You get full copyright.

57:11.920 --> 57:22.160
 Yeah, I like it. But that's a historical view. What in that book would you suggest

57:22.160 --> 57:27.920
 in one of the last chapters about the future of this process?

57:27.920 --> 57:34.640
 Well, Huxley has to stop you. He stopped me in my tracks, Aldous Huxley. So in 1958,

57:34.640 --> 57:43.440
 he pens this op ed of sorts, and it reads incredibly prescient because I really do think

57:43.440 --> 57:51.040
 in many ways as the fog of the war drug is ending and finally lifting that we've kind of come full

57:51.040 --> 57:57.120
 circle back to the late 1950s, which might sound strange. It'll make more sense when you hear what

57:57.120 --> 58:02.880
 Huxley said about psychedelics. And so he was looking forward to a revival of religion, which

58:02.880 --> 58:12.000
 is why I subtitled the book, The Religion with No Name. And to him, to Huxley, this revival wouldn't

58:12.000 --> 58:18.880
 come about through televangelistic mass meetings or photogenic clergymen, as he says, but he points

58:18.880 --> 58:25.520
 to the biochemical discoveries such as we have today that would allow for large numbers of men

58:25.520 --> 58:31.600
 and women to achieve a radical self transcendence and a deeper understanding of the nature of things.

58:31.600 --> 58:36.560
 In other words, that this revival of religion, he says, would be a revolution. Alan Watts comes

58:36.560 --> 58:44.240
 along and says that there's nothing more dangerous to authority than a popular outbreak of mysticism.

58:44.240 --> 58:50.240
 But I think this is what Huxley was pointing to. And he talks about religion in these terms about

58:50.240 --> 58:57.280
 being less about symbols and returning to a sense of experience and intuition. And Huxley says that

58:57.280 --> 59:04.400
 he envisions a religion which gives rise to everyday mysticism. And he talks about something

59:04.400 --> 59:11.120
 that would undergird everyday rationality, everyday tasks and duties, and everyday human

59:11.120 --> 59:17.440
 relationships. In other words, religion has to mean something. And these altered states of

59:17.440 --> 59:23.520
 awareness that we seem to be able to produce quite easily inside the lab at Hopkins, NYU,

59:23.520 --> 59:30.560
 and elsewhere with psilocybin. I think this is kind of part of Huxley's prediction about a time

59:31.200 --> 59:37.520
 when we would have legal access, safe access, efficacious access to this material that would

59:37.520 --> 59:44.640
 allow for insight in an afternoon. And what do you do when millions of people can become mystics in

59:44.640 --> 59:54.800
 an afternoon? So psychedelics, psilocybin might be sort of the practical way of having these kinds of

59:55.760 --> 1:00:01.360
 maybe could be termed religious experiences. And then many people partaking in those experiences

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:05.280
 and then like evolving this collective intelligence thing we've got going on,

1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:10.880
 that's sort of the practice of religion that we should be striving for as opposed to kind of

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:19.280
 operating in the space of ideas, actually practicing it. You mentioned, and that's the

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:27.280
 religion with no name, the use of these tools. Is there a simple way to summarize religion for our

1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:33.440
 previous discussion about God, basically discovering the God inside? What if I give you a very

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:39.440
 complicated definition of religion and then we talk about a more simplified? Let's do it. So

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:44.160
 the most complicated we can get on this is the anthropologist Clifford Geertz. But I think it's

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:49.920
 worth defining our terms when we're talking about God and religion. So religion religio from the

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:55.040
 Latin means to bind back. So to bind us back to some meaningful tradition, to bind us back to the

1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:03.040
 source. Here's a mouthful from Clifford Geertz. Religion, he defines as a set of symbols which

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:09.440
 acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations by formulating

1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:14.400
 conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing those conceptions in such an aura of

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:23.200
 factuality that those moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic, which is complex. What does

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:29.280
 that mean? That religion has to make you feel something, these moods and motivations. But it

1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:35.040
 can't just do that in the way that sex does that for us or sports or ultimate fighting or the World

1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:41.760
 Cup or going to a concert. So we get all that emotion in these experiences like that. But that

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:47.680
 emotion has to be concomitant to a deep existential insight that answers this question for you in the

1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:53.200
 morning. I know why I'm here. I know why humans are here. I think I know what the meaning of life

1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:59.280
 is. That's what religion is. And if you find that meaning in science, then that's your religion and

1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:05.920
 that's fine. But we need to be more honest about that. If your epistemological model is weighing

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:10.080
 facts and figures and you think that's why you're here on this planet and you find deep meaning,

1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.920
 that's okay. Religion is the thing that makes you feel, right? It has the aura of factuality. It

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:22.160
 just makes you feel like you know the point behind existence. In other words, I think it can be

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:25.680
 in other words, I think it comes down to experience. Like Joe Campbell was talking about,

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:30.480
 like Aldous Huxley mentions about experience and intuition. I think this is how we connect to God.

1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:38.800
 Make you feel like you understand the world. I mean, so that's kind of bigger than science.

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:47.120
 That includes science, but it's bigger. Do you think, what is real? Like do you think there's

1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:53.360
 an absolute reality that we're kind of striving towards understanding or is it all just conjured

1:02:53.360 --> 1:03:00.400
 up in our minds? And that's the whole kind of point. We together create these realities and

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:08.960
 play with them and dance to somehow derive meaning from those realities. And it's ultimately not like

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:18.320
 like very deeply integrated into what's like into atoms of space time. Another easy question, Lex.

1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:23.760
 Well, I mean, you have to kind of, when you're thinking about

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:32.240
 emotion and making it concrete into something that feels real, you have to start asking,

1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:40.240
 like, what is real? It's something that Ben Shapiro has this saying of facts don't care

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:46.240
 about your feelings. I was always uncomfortable with this. I mean, he's just being spiffy or

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:53.360
 whatever, but I was always uncomfortable with somehow first that the hubris of thinking that

1:03:53.360 --> 1:04:02.480
 humans can have, like arrive at absolute truth, which is what I assume he means by facts,

1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:09.280
 like things that are uncontrovertible. And then somehow deriding feelings, like feelings are not

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:18.400
 important. To me, like the whole thing is reality. The facts don't even, like facts is reality,

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:24.240
 feelings are reality, like the entirety of human experience is reality. All these

1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:29.680
 consciousnesses somehow interacting together, making up random crap and together agreeing

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:34.640
 they're all going to wear the same colors, rooting for one football team or the other football team

1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:40.800
 or countries, all those things, that's real because we've agreed that it's real.

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:45.760
 And in the same way, it gives us meaning in that same way religion is a set of ideas that

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:58.400
 gives us meaning, but real, it's really difficult for me as a scientist that finds comfort in the

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:04.640
 physical understanding of the universe of physics. I love physics. I love computer science.

1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:11.680
 It makes me feel like everything is perfectly understandable. And then I look at humans,

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:17.760
 humans, they're totally not understandable. It's like a giant mess, but that's part of the beauty.

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:26.880
 Like what is love? Like what the hell is love? It's certainly not like a weird hack to convince me

1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:32.000
 to procreate because it feels something bigger than that. So like taking a purely evolutionary

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.520
 biologist perspective, it's missing the, it's not missing, it's only capturing a part of the picture.

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:44.400
 And so it just keeps making me ask, what is real? Because as a human, it's very human centric.

1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:53.120
 It does certainly feel like a part, a big part of what is real is all the fake stuff my mind makes up.

1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.280
 I mean, okay, I guess, is there something you could say

1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:06.320
 from our discussions about the tools of psychedelics, about our discussion about

1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:10.960
 religion, of what is real, of what is reality?

1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:15.120
 These are largely unanswerable questions.

1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:19.920
 But we should nevertheless strive to answer them. That's the whole point of the human experience.

1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:24.240
 And I think science is one way and religion is another. And I think there's actually a sphere

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:30.000
 where they intersect, you know, there's a way for religion to be a big part of the world.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:35.440
 Religion to be observable, testable, repeatable, falsifiable. When I look at the ancient mysteries,

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:41.600
 that's what I find. I find people exploring alternate states of consciousness and arriving

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:46.880
 at conclusions based on that exploration and deriving deep meaning from that, which yes,

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:51.200
 are feelings and emotions and very hard to quantify. But nonetheless, these are the things

1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:56.640
 that govern our lives. I mean, I don't know a parent who isn't motivated by the love of their

1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:03.360
 children. Everything I do at 40 years old now is pretty much inspired by my love for my two

1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:08.560
 daughters. And I can't prove to you that I love them. I can say it, I can show you behavior,

1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:15.520
 but it's very hard for me to weigh and measure that. So not everything is so reducible to this

1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:23.200
 quantifiable reality. And yet, I also love science. And I love the historical process of weighing this

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:29.440
 data. I love the chemistry. I love the biology. And for me, I think this was the message of the

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:34.880
 ancient Greeks. And I think this is the world in which paleo Christianity was born. I think there

1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:43.520
 is this meeting ground between science and religion, which allow for the, if not the discovery,

1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:50.240
 then at least the near identification of the ultimate reality, which is another way to describe

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:55.360
 God, right? This being of being is the transcendent mystery. So speaking of God,

1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:03.680
 you mentioned to me offline, you're wearing the most sophisticated clothing choice of the elite

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:08.400
 intellectuals. Like you mentioned, Sam Harris was wearing a hoodie. This is the Sam Harris hoodie.

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:14.240
 He's starting a trend. He's starting a trend. This is a new religion, you could even say. It's

1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:22.320
 a ritual. It's a ritual practice of intellectuals of searching for meaning. So there's quite a

1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:29.760
 fascinating debate. So he was for a time still known as one of the sort of new age atheists.

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.520
 So he was kind of trying to explore the role of religion in society and the role of science.

1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:40.800
 And then on the other side, another kind of powerhouse intellectual is Jordan Peterson,

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:48.240
 who in sometimes, for my taste, a bit too poetic of ways is exploring the ideas of religion.

1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:54.640
 And they had these interesting debates that I think will continue about the role of religion

1:08:54.640 --> 1:09:05.920
 in society. For Jordan, there's all these flaws with religion, but there is a lot of value to be

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:12.880
 discovered amidst the rituals, the traditions, the practice, the way we conceive of each other

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:20.080
 because of the ideas that religion propagates. And then for Sam, it says that everything about

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:29.360
 religion basically gets in the way of us fully realizing our human potential, which is deeply

1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:39.760
 scientific and rational and sort of like we're surrounded by mystery. Calling that mystery God

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:45.200
 is getting in the way of us understanding that mystery. What do you think about this debate

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:48.240
 about the role of religion in society?

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.560
 We should continue having this debate. I talked to Jordan a couple of weeks ago, as a matter of fact.

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:55.120
 Excellent. On his podcast? Public? Excellent.

1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.360
 Yes. It'll be out soon. And so, he and I...

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:01.120
 How did that go, by the way?

1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:06.400
 It was incredible. Carl Ruck, the professor, joined us, as a matter of fact, for one of his

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:13.360
 rare public appearances. We went deep. And Jordan is very well read, obviously, on the psychedelic

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:18.640
 literature. He had just had Roland Griffiths from Hopkins on the podcast. And it's one of

1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:23.920
 Roland's figures that Jordan and I, again, just like the language of Aldous Huxley, it's hard to

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:30.800
 move past the following statistic. Over the past 20 years of the modern study of psilocybin, Roland

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:36.800
 will tell you that about three in four of their volunteers walk away from their single dose of

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:43.040
 psilocybin, high dose, saying it was among the most meaningful experiences of their entire lives,

1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:53.600
 if not the most meaningful. And Jordan says, what do you do with that? How do we synthesize that?

1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:02.640
 Here we are quantifying the qualifiable, the unqualifiable. And yet, these compounds have

1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:08.880
 dramatic effects on people's lives, and they walk away feeling like they're more loving,

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:16.720
 more compassionate. The science of all talks about the welling up of cooperation and resource sharing

1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:22.000
 and kindness and all these strange things from this single chemical intervention, which seems to

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:28.800
 reduce us to automata, as if enlightenment can be flipped on like a switch. And yet, there it is,

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:33.120
 there's the data. And I don't see how you walk away from that. I mean, I completely understand

1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.360
 Sam's position. But I think there's a reading of religion, particularly the mystical core

1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:45.040
 of the big faiths, and especially these ancient mystery cults, which do speak, again, to those

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:52.640
 moods and motivations, creating this aura of factuality that these volunteers never walk away

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:57.600
 from, permanently transformed, just like the ancient mysteries. And part of that is perhaps

1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:06.640
 language, that we need to continue to evolve language in how we conceive of these processes.

1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:13.280
 Maybe religion has a bunch of baggage associated with it that is good to let go of,

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.000
 or perhaps not. I don't know. This is connected to our previous part of our conversation is the

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.360
 importance of language in this whole thing. Well, that's how I start my book with one of

1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:27.920
 these volunteers from the NYU psilocybin experiments, this woman, Dina Dina Baser,

1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:34.080
 who's an atheist. And she still describes herself as an atheist. And yet, as one of these three and

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:39.760
 four people who walked away from this experiment transformed, she says that her experience of

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:45.360
 psilocybin was like being bathed in God's love from an atheist. And I asked her why she uses

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:51.360
 the word God, why not the love of the cosmos or the universe or mother nature? And she says,

1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:56.880
 well, frankly, we don't know about any of this stuff and that God makes sense to me. She's still

1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:03.680
 an atheist, but it's the way she describes that as kind of like the way your mother's love must

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:08.880
 have felt when you were a baby. Yeah. There's a kind of, I like the way Einstein uses God. God

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:13.360
 doesn't play dice. There's a poetry. There's a humility that you don't know what the hell is

1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:19.680
 going on. There's a humor to it. I'm a huge fan, especially like more and more of just kind of

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:27.680
 having a big old laugh at the absurdity of this world and this life as represented nicely by memes

1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:34.240
 on Twitter kind of thing. I mean, there's a sense in which we want to be playing with these words

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:41.600
 and not take them so seriously and being a little bit lighthearted and explore. Let me ask you about,

1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:50.880
 because you mentioned NYU, what I find fascinating is how much amazing research, speaking of science,

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:58.240
 right? Studying the effects of psilocybin, studying the effects of various psychedelics, MDMA,

1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:05.600
 on the human mind right now for helping people. But I'm hoping there'll be studies soon at Hopkins

1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:12.400
 and elsewhere that allow people that are kind of more quote unquote creatives or regular people

1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.160
 that don't have a particular demon they're trying to work through, a problem they're trying to work

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:25.760
 through, but more like to see what can I find if I utilize psychedelics to explore? Is there something

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:31.760
 you could say that is exciting to you, that's promising about the future? What currently is

1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.640
 going on but also the future of psychedelics research at Hopkins and elsewhere? The healthy normals.

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.040
 I was looking for the right words because healthy doesn't feel like a good term and

1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:47.440
 normal doesn't feel like a good term because we're all pretty messed up and we're all weird.

1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:53.600
 Well, those with ontological angst in that case. Maybe there'll be a future DSM qualification.

1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:00.400
 There's no doubt that things like psilocybin, MDMA are useful for things like anxiety,

1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:06.720
 depression, end of life distress, PTSD, alcoholism, you name it. And it's largely because of the

1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:13.120
 clinical research that MDMA and psilocybin will probably be legal in some FDA regulated way in

1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:19.040
 the next five years. But again, I start the first page of my book with this question, why do

1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:25.680
 psychedelics work across all these different conditions? And the best that I could find is

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:32.800
 is the meaning, right? Tony Bosse at NYU talks about psilocybin, for example, as meaning making

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:38.000
 medicine, which is interesting because it puts it somewhere between a therapeutic and again,

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.120
 this ontological instigator. What is it about psychedelics that creates these mystical

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:50.080
 experiences or mystical like experiences? You can call them emotional breakthroughs,

1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:54.640
 you can call them moments of awe. I do think we get locked up in the language and we're

1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.640
 somewhere between science and religion here, including legally. So the FDA is one route to

1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:04.800
 this. What excites me about psychedelics is the first amendment. What is this going to mean for

1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:09.600
 religion? The freedom of religion being the first thing that's mentioned in the first amendment

1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:15.520
 before freedom of speech, freedom of assembly. If America is known for anything, it's a refuge

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:21.280
 for religious pioneers. And so we already have the native American church, Brazilian spawn churches

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:28.080
 that are using psychedelics. But what would happen if Judaism or Christianity or Islam were to begin

1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:35.680
 incorporating the very ritual, very sacred and discreet use of psychedelics as part of their

1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:42.080
 liturgy? So not replacing the Sunday Eucharist in the case of Christianity, but part of the extra

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:49.040
 credit dimension of the faith. And then we can, through practice, figure out how essential it is.

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.040
 It could be a minor thing. It could be a major thing. That's another thing I wanted to kind of

1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:58.080
 ask you is, I recently, despite the fact that I'm eating a huge amount of meat, I'm getting fat.

1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:07.200
 I'm loving it. This is actually, as of two days ago, I started this long road to training for David

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:13.680
 Goggins, to training back, to getting back to competing in jiu jitsu. So the fun is over. But

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:21.600
 I also partook in fasting and there was a very strong, there's an almost like a hallucinogenic

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:27.280
 aspect of fasting, because it was, especially because it was a 72 hour fast versus a more common

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:34.640
 fast that I do, which is 24 hours. And a bunch of people talk about throughout history about the

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:42.240
 value of fasting in having these kind of visual, these kind of intellectual experiences. Also,

1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:51.200
 there's meditation, Sam Harris with the hoodie. Do you have a sense that those other rituals of

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:59.040
 fasting, of meditation, and maybe other things could be as essential or more essential to the

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:05.360
 religious experience as psychedelics? Yes, if not, and this is going to sound weird, but maybe not

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:13.200
 if more so. I look at psychedelics as a catalyst for spiritual investigation, not as the superficial

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:21.840
 means to an end. I think their value is in kind of serving as a Google Maps for the Kingdom of Heaven.

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:31.280
 All right, I like this. Well, so Ram Dass's teacher said that when he was offered psychedelics that

1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:37.920
 it'll get you in the room with Jesus, but it won't keep you there. And I think that's all well and

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:41.520
 good, but what if you don't know where the house is in the first place? What if you've never had

1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:47.680
 a mystical experience? What if religion is anathema to you? What if you hate God? What if all

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:51.920
 these words mean nothing to you? And they probably do for many, many people, and it's perfectly

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:57.200
 understandable. I think that we've lost the coordinates to these irrational states, again,

1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:03.120
 that were prized throughout antiquity and that continue to be prized by the mystical communities,

1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:08.560
 even in big organized religion, it just doesn't filter out that much. And so psychedelics, in my

1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:16.720
 mind, help orient our minds, bodies, and souls towards the irrational, right? We talked about

1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:23.520
 McKenna's invisible world that seems to have this symbiosis with our own and perhaps has this higher

1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:30.240
 intent for us. You could very well just, you know, take catalog of your dreams, right? And that would

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:37.120
 do it too. But psychedelics seem to be particularly fast acting, particularly potent, and very

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:42.880
 reliable, especially in the clinical studies. And so I looked at them as biochemical discoveries,

1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:49.920
 like Huxley did. Maybe it's once in your life or infrequently, right? But maybe that's the beginning

1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:55.600
 of a genuine introspection and a life well examined, as the ancients always instructed us.

1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:00.960
 Yeah, it does seem like in the research, the effectiveness of psychedelics always comes with

1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:07.920
 the integration, where you use it, just like you said, as a catalyst for thinking through stuff.

1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:15.920
 It's not going to be, I don't even know if Google Maps, maybe Google Maps is the right analogy,

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:22.240
 but it doesn't do the driving for you. You still have to do the driving. It just kind of gives you

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:28.400
 the directions. So after you come down from the trip, or whatever, you still have to drive.

1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:34.480
 There's other tools that are kind of interesting. We've been talking about this at the psychological

1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:39.440
 level, but there's also a neuroscience perspective of it. If you kind of like go past the skull into

1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:43.760
 the brain with the neurons firing, there's ideas of brain computer interfaces,

1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:48.160
 there's ideas of brain computer interfaces. First of all, there's a whole field of neuroscience

1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:52.160
 that's kind of zooming in and studying the firing of the brain, the firing of the neurons in the

1:20:52.160 --> 1:21:00.240
 brain, of how from those neurons emerges all the things that we think that makes us human. That's a

1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:06.080
 fascinating exploration of the human mind. That's of course where the psychedelics have the chemical,

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:13.280
 the biochemical effects on those neurons. There's ideas of brain computer interfaces,

1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:18.240
 which if you look at, especially what Neuralink is doing with this long term vision,

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:26.880
 with Elon Musk and Neuralink, they hope to expand, he calls it a wizard hat.

1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:38.080
 This is back to the humor on the internet thing. The wizard hat that expands the

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:44.800
 capabilities, the capacity of the human mind. Do you think there's something there or

1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:54.080
 is the human mind so infinitely complex that we're quite a long way away from

1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:02.160
 expanding the capabilities of the human mind through technology versus something like psychedelics?

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:08.720
 I wonder how Terence McKenna would answer that question. He looked to shamans as kind of the

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:15.280
 scientists, the high magicians of the high archaic past and the far flung future.

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:21.120
 You know more about AI than I do, so I'm not going to discount it. But

1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:31.840
 I do think that AI paired with the sacred recovery, the archaeology of consciousness

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:37.600
 and these states, these archaic techniques of ecstasy that were practiced across time. I think

1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:44.400
 that's a winning combination. Part of what I do in the book is just I try and lay out the set

1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:48.640
 and setting. That's often talked about with psychedelics. So maybe psychedelics in the

1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:53.840
 right AI environment is going to work. I think it'd probably work a lot better with that myth

1:22:53.840 --> 1:23:00.560
 and ritual incorporated. So the reason Eleusis worked for 2000 years and let's assume the

1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:05.600
 psychedelic hypothesis has some merit to it. But I think the reason it worked is because you were

1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:11.680
 born into a mythology. You were born into a story about Demeter and Persephone and you waited your

1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:17.360
 entire life to meet them in the flesh. So you weren't just preparing for a few months. It was

1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:24.560
 a lifetime of expectation, anticipation, ritual preparation. In fact, some of the early church

1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:30.080
 fathers made fun of the Greeks for essentially just piquing people's curiosity and revving up

1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:34.240
 the anticipation, which has something to do with the outcome, by the way. But in other words,

1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:39.840
 I think we need to create a new mythology around this. I don't think you pop into a laboratory.

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:45.200
 I don't think you pop into a retreat center from one day to the next. I think that in my own case,

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:50.240
 I think that in my own case, I feel like I've been preparing 12 years for psychedelics and I'm still

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:57.120
 preparing, including in today's conversation. I'm learning new things and I'm willing to explore it

1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:04.960
 together with the computer interface. But I do think ritual is a gigantic part of this. And even

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:11.040
 McKenna would say that. I'll paraphrase him by saying that if you'd met someone who didn't know

1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:18.480
 where they were between the years 1995 and 2005, you would describe them as a fairly damaged person.

1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:23.600
 And yet who among us knows what was happening in Western civilization between 900 and 1300,

1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.960
 let alone 2,500 years ago. So this is in many ways the prophet of the psychedelic renaissance saying

1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:34.400
 that history has lessons. And I don't think they're superficial lessons. I think it cuts to

1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:42.960
 the very core of how and why Western civilization came to be born. Yeah, but that history can be

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:50.560
 loaded into AI systems. And I do love the idea of whether it's to bring computer interfaces or without

1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:57.840
 intrusive, sort of without direct reading of the neurons and more sort of interactive experience

1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:03.280
 with the robot that you can have an AI system that steers your psychedelic experience.

1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:11.200
 That helps you sort of, when you take a heroic dose of psilocybin, for example,

1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:16.880
 helps steer you, steer your mind, say just the right things. I mean, you could say that kind

1:25:16.880 --> 1:25:25.200
 of thing with, it's a totally open problem, I would say. You talk about set and setting.

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:31.200
 This is the interesting thing about Johns Hopkins is you create a comfortable environment,

1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:38.480
 a safe environment for allowing, then if you take a heroic, like a large dose of psilocybin,

1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:43.520
 that you could trust that everything would be safe and you can really allow the exploration

1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:50.320
 of your mind. But then you don't know from a psychotherapy perspective of like during that trip,

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:55.440
 what a human should say to steer that trip. Like that's a totally open set of problems.

1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:00.960
 And in some sense, probably throughout history, those rituals, you figured out what are the

1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.680
 right things to say to each other, how to collaborate. And maybe if you can turn that

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:11.120
 into an optimization problem, AI could figure that out much, much quicker.

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.200
 I'm with you. So, Eleusis was known for three things, the legomena, the dromena,

1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:21.040
 the decnumena, the things said, the things done, the things shown. If you can pack that

1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:26.320
 all into your AI interface, I'm in, Lex Friedman. I'm going to write a proposal and then try to

1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:34.080
 get it through the IRB at MIT. I mean, there is a certain sense in which I definitely wanted

1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:41.520
 to explore psychedelics, I mean, in my personal life, but also more rigorously as a scientist

1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:52.000
 and to push that forward and especially in the AI space. And it is difficult how to do that dance

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:58.000
 when there's gray areas of legality and all those kinds of things. And we're dancing around them.

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:05.840
 And some of that is language and some of that is what we socially conceive of as drugs or not.

1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:11.680
 And you're right that perhaps we can reframe it as religious experiences, all those kinds of things.

1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:16.240
 I mean, it's fascinating because it feels like there's a bunch of tools before us that were

1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:23.600
 used by the ancients that we're not utilizing for exploring the human mind, that we very well could

1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:29.600
 be in a rigorous scientific way, in a safe way. And that's fascinating. There's this interesting

1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:40.640
 period in the 20th century of LSD use that many of the people doing research on psychedelics now

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:47.360
 kind of have their roots in that history. I mentioned that Dr. Rick Doblin, he is one of those people.

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:54.880
 And there's this interesting story of a bunch of creatives that used LSD or other drugs to help them.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:00.880
 What do you make of the idea of somebody like Ken Kesey who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:11.520
 in part under the influence of LSD? What do you make of the use of psychedelics to

1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:22.560
 maximize the creative potential of the human mind? Is this a crutch or is this actually

1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:31.120
 an effective tool that we should explore? One person's crutch might be another's

1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:40.400
 bungee cord. It depends on that mind. Think about Paul McCartney. I mean,

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.000
 we might not have some of the better Beatles music in the absence of LSD.

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:50.400
 And what did Sir Paul say in 1967 when he was asked about his use of LSD? He said that he

1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:57.040
 recognized the dangers inherent in it, but that he did it with a very specific, very deliberate

1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:03.760
 purpose in mind. He wanted to find the answer to what life is all about. And I'm not sure what Sir

1:29:03.760 --> 1:29:10.400
 Paul is doing this week, but he's probably not doing LSD. Speaking back to my theory about these

1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:16.960
 substances being catalyzers of spiritual introspection, it came along at a time in

1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:22.080
 their life when I think they were ripe for it, especially George Harrison. I highly recommend

1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:29.680
 the Martin Scorsese documentary about George Harrison. For them, I think it was exactly

1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:36.320
 the way we ought to investigate it, which is, well, mind expanders. This is what psychedelics

1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:42.720
 do, right? That which makes manifest the contents of the mind. In the absence of an experience like

1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:48.640
 that, and it can be in a three day fast, it can be laying down in a cave, it can be in ritual

1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:52.960
 chanting, it can be in a sun dance, but in the absence of that kind of experience at the right

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:58.640
 time in your life, it may otherwise be very difficult to find entrance to that kingdom of

1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:03.360
 heaven, which I do think is here and now, getting right back to the very beginning. If we are

1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:10.160
 actually to participate in that eternal principle, how and when? What do you think Nietzsche meant

1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:16.480
 when he said that God is dead? So, there's a sense that religion is fading from society,

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:23.920
 and there's a cranky German that kind of wrote about it. What do you think he meant?

1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:30.480
 He was a cranky German who knew a lot about Dionysus, by the way, which is why I like him.

1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:38.000
 So, certainly there's some truth to the mortality of God. I think Gallup put out a study only a

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.040
 couple of months ago where church membership is now officially in the minority in the United States

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:49.920
 at 47%, according to the most recent poll. That number was closer to 70% only 20 years ago.

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:50.320
 Wow.

1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:54.000
 So, we're living through something, and we're living through the unchurching

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:57.200
 of America, and it's the rise of the spiritual but not religious,

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:03.760
 the inheritor of all traditions but the slave to none. There's a rise in the unaffiliated,

1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:08.400
 the nones. I think it was like one third of millennials. It's probably much higher now

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:13.040
 that don't affiliate with any religion. So, in that sense, God is absolutely dead,

1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:19.200
 but maybe not the God that we were trying to define at the very beginning. So, Nietzsche

1:31:19.200 --> 1:31:24.720
 also looked forward to the Übermensch, which would be a fully realized human being that,

1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:32.800
 despite the death of God, did not fall into nihilism and amorality, existential despair,

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:38.160
 all that great German stuff. And there are some commentators who talk about this eternal

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:44.240
 recurrence that just maybe by incorporating some of these techniques, not necessarily doctrine and

1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:49.120
 dogma, but I would say the techniques of antiquity. And again, Nietzsche writes a lot about the

1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:56.000
 rationality of Dionysus having its place in society. If anything, these biochemical discoveries,

1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:02.880
 I think, point us back. They point us back to Dionysus and their responsible incorporation of

1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:11.440
 the irrational into our otherwise society of rational people and our kazoo history.

1:32:11.440 --> 1:32:17.600
 I have a sense that there will be kind of, just kind of as you've implied, that there will be

1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:24.160
 maybe the God of old is dying and there'll be a rebirth of different kind of God and it'll just

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:29.840
 keep happening throughout history. I do think there will be a time where AI will be the gods

1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:36.480
 we look to, the other, the super intelligent, those kinds of things. There's a little bit of an

1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:44.640
 inkling of religious longing for meaning in the way people conceive of aliens currently.

1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:51.280
 I mean, I talked to a bunch of people about UFOs, the EPs and aliens. And so to me,

1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:56.080
 it's very interesting for perhaps different reasons, because I'm just, I look up to the stars

1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:02.960
 and it's incredibly humbling to me to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations

1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:09.600
 out there, which to me seems likely, or perhaps not intelligent, perhaps just alien life. And

1:33:09.600 --> 1:33:14.800
 actually, also that we don't even understand what it means to be intelligent, or do we understand

1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:23.520
 what it means to be alive? The time scale, the spatial scale, which patterns of atoms can form

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:31.920
 in a way that you can call life, it just could be way weirder than we can imagine. And certainly

1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:38.480
 way different than human life. Anyway, that to me is humbling. And so it's almost like the

1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:44.960
 simulation, conceiving of the world as simulation, thinking of aliens to me is a useful thought experiment

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.000
 of like, what would aliens look like if they visited? How would we know? How would we communicate

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:57.760
 with them? How would we send signals to them? If they're already here and we don't see them,

1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:03.440
 how's that possible? That seems to me actually likely that we would just be too self centered

1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:11.440
 and too dumb to see them if they're already here. Anyway, so that's kind of the almost the

1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:18.240
 pragmatic, the engineering, the physics sense of aliens. But there's also kind of a longing

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.240
 to connect with other intelligent beings out there, both the fear and the excitement of that,

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:30.560
 that has kind of a religious aspect to it that I find fascinating. And in the right context,

1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:35.760
 when you remove the skepticism of government from that, it's actually a hopeful longing.

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:44.240
 Do you see this kind of interest in aliens as at all connected to your study of religion?

1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.560
 So you're the first person to ask me about aliens in eight months. So it looks like I'm going on the

1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:59.840
 record. Let's go. I'll drop some J. Allen Hynek on you. So Hynek involved in Project Blue Book

1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:06.160
 famously says in 1966, when the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, and we're

1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:11.600
 assuming that UFOs have something to do with aliens, but when the long awaited solution comes,

1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.680
 I believe it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science,

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:24.080
 but a mighty and unexpected quantum leap. In other words, I do not think that we're dealing with

1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:30.320
 flesh and blood beings in nuts and bolts crafts. I think it's way, way more complicated than that.

1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:36.160
 And if anything, it takes me back to the ancient world. It takes me back to this invisible college

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:42.880
 of beings of apparent higher intent. It takes me to the geniuses and the muses. So the first

1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:49.920
 document in Western civilization, Homer's epics, they begin by invoking an alien. They invoke a

1:35:49.920 --> 1:36:01.360
 muse. Tell me O muse about the man. So Homer isn't inventing poetry. He's channeling poetry, epic

1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:09.600
 poetry from an alien intelligence. Maybe that intelligence has felt a little unrecognized in

1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:16.160
 recent years. Trying to show up in human recognizable forms. The muse is trying to give

1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:22.960
 a little hints of its existence. Yeah. I mean, I have a, I've been saying, I honestly sort of,

1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:30.560
 I don't believe this, but I think about this, whether alien, like muse is a great example,

1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:39.600
 whether aliens could be thoughts. Ideas we have are the aliens or consciousness itself

1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:47.120
 is the methods by which aliens communicate with us. Like I find this very kind of liberating to

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:54.160
 expand our conception of what intelligent beings are. You would like Julian Jaynes. Julian Jaynes

1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.760
 writes a great book, the origins of consciousness and the breakdown of the bicameral mind. It's this

1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:06.320
 theory that the ancient Greek mind was very different from ours. And that when they heard

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.560
 the muses, they heard, or the gods and goddesses for that matter, they would hear them as voices

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:18.560
 in the head and hear it as an internal God figure offering commands, which they couldn't ignore. So

1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:22.800
 were they walking schizophrenics? It might be one way to talk about it before the breakdown of the

1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:28.560
 bicameral mind, but it's a provocative theory, largely untestable. But when you're reading

1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:33.680
 ancient Greek and Latin for that matter, you can't read it very long without bumping up against these

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:40.800
 discarnate entities. They're everywhere. And they survived. They persist across time, which is even

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:45.760
 stranger, not just in the form of all the things my daughters like, like fairies and gnomes and

1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:52.320
 elves. And McKenna loves this, the sylphs and the boulder grinders and the sprites and the gins and

1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:58.560
 elementals, every society has them. It seems to be fairly universal. And they largely exist in

1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:04.080
 folklore, mythology. This is what Jacques Vallée writes about so wonderfully. We've kind of been

1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:11.200
 sneaking around it, but let me ask you from everything we've been talking about, how do you

1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:19.520
 think about consciousness? Is it a fun little trick that the human mind does or is it somehow

1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:27.120
 fundamental to this whole thing? So this three pound lump of jelly inside our craniums,

1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:34.800
 that can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space, it can contemplate the meaning of infinity,

1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:40.960
 and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity, that peculiar self

1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:47.040
 recursive quality that we call self awareness. So this is the hard problem, right? This is the

1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:53.040
 unknowable, the unknown at least. I don't know. I have no good answer for that.

1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:58.160
 Did you think it's somehow deeply fundamental to the human experience or is it just a trick? So

1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:05.040
 you have like, I mean, Sam Harris has really been making me think about this. So, you know,

1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:13.280
 calling free will an illusion. The interesting thing about Sam is it's not just a philosophical

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:23.280
 it's not just a philosophical little chat with him about free will. He really says he experiences

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:29.600
 the lack of free will. Like he's able to, you know, large parts of the day to feel like he

1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:40.480
 has no free will. In that same way, now he thinks that consciousness is not an illusion. It is,

1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:46.560
 you know, it's a real thing. But at the same, I'm more almost like, I'm almost more of like

1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:51.520
 consciousness seems to be a little bit of an illusion in the sense that like, it feels like

1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:57.440
 maybe this is a robotics AI perspective, but it feels like in that same way that Sam steps outside

1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:04.160
 of feeling like he has an agency, feeling like he has a free will, I feel like we should be able to

1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:12.720
 step outside of having a consciousness. So that, from my perspective, maybe that's a hopeful

1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:17.760
 perspective for trying to engineer consciousness. But do you think consciousness is like at the core

1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:26.880
 of this? Or is it just like language? Or almost like a thing we build on top of much deeper human,

1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.600
 the things that makes us human? I don't know. I am attracted to Lanz's notion of biocentrism.

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.520
 I mean, it's difficult to walk away from the double slit experiment, not wondering

1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:45.920
 why we seem capable of collapsing that quantum wave function. It's very, very weird, giving rise

1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:51.280
 to even weirder ideas about superposition and spooky action at a distance and things that MIT

1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.880
 guys know a lot better than me. But it seems to me fundamental. I mean, maybe consciousness is

1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:02.800
 the fundamental thing. I mean, weirdly, some of these ancient incubatory practices, I talked about

1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:08.240
 Peter Kingsley before. So he's not a proponent of ancient psychedelic use, but is a proponent of

1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:14.880
 these ancient rites of incubation that were practiced by Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles,

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:18.960
 other Presocratics. And so what were they doing? They were trying to get in touch with consciousness.

1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:25.360
 They were entering into suspended states of animation in these cave like settings. Pythagoras

1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:30.720
 had built one in his basement and would lie down motionless, apparently, for long periods of time.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:36.720
 And what I think they were trying to do was tap into and trying to answer this question in their

1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:41.920
 own, you could call it a scientific way, actually, less religion than science. And what they would

1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:47.520
 discover or try to discover was a state of awareness that is somehow beyond life and death,

1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:53.360
 beyond waking and dreaming, where you can be aware of the senses, but also in touch with another

1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:00.800
 reality at the exact same time, what Kingsley calls sensation. That, I think, is definitely

1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:08.960
 worth exploring. Well, and the way I hope to explore is by trying to build it. Everybody uses

1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:13.280
 the tools they have. Well, no, I do also hope psychedelics can help. So how do you build that?

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:19.280
 I'm curious. That's a whole other discussion. There's a lot of things I could say here, but

1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:32.800
 let me put simply is I believe that you can go a long way towards building consciousness

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:40.560
 by trying to fake consciousness. So fake it till you make it. As an engineering approach,

1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:46.800
 I think will work for consciousness. You seem satisfied with that.

1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:53.040
 I'm satisfied with that because I know how deeply unsatisfied others are, but just wait.

1:42:55.280 --> 1:43:04.160
 So, I mean, I don't know what to. So the topic of consciousness is mostly handled by

1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:12.560
 philosophers currently. And that's great. And their philosophers are wonderful and good at

1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:18.240
 what they do. I'm not a philosopher. I'm an engineer. And I think the approach there is

1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:29.520
 quite different. I think falling in love is different than trying to have a podcast conversation

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:38.800
 about what is love. I think the engineering effort is just fundamentally different than

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:45.360
 the philosophical effort. And I have a sense that consciousness can be engineered even before it is

1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:50.480
 understood by the philosophers. So I think there's a bunch of things like that in this world that

1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:55.520
 could be engineered before they're understood. I think the intelligence is one such thing.

1:43:55.520 --> 1:44:01.680
 I think we'll be able to engineer super intelligent beings before we're able to understand

1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:10.960
 the human mind. There's a lot of intuition to unpack there of why that is. But

1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:19.680
 as it stands, that's perhaps my engineering optimism and engineering ethic under which I operate.

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:23.920
 Consciousness is easy to build, hard to understand.

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:34.160
 Okay. Are there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that had a big impact on you?

1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:44.560
 Immortality Key is exceptionally well researched. The amount of books you read is I cannot even

1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:53.120
 imagine. So is there something in your travels through the land of language that stuck with

1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:59.680
 you that was especially impactful? I mentioned a couple of them. So I knew nothing about

1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:06.160
 psychedelics before 2007. And it was in hearing about some of the first psilocybin experiments

1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:11.840
 at Hopkins. And then shortly thereafter, I went down this rabbit hole. And so the first set of

1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:17.680
 recommendations all kind of fit in that time period of my life, 2007, 2008. It started with

1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:25.440
 Jeremy Narby, The Cosmic Serpent, DNA and the Origins of Knowledge. It was a total impulse buy

1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:31.840
 at the Barnes and Noble on Sixth Avenue in New York and wound up introducing me to Supernatural

1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:39.120
 by Graham Hancock. That convinced me that there was a long story to psychedelics that

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.560
 he tried to prove in that book and that we're still trying to prove. I mentioned

1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:51.840
 the connection between ritual psychedelics and cave art. This is the neuropsychological model

1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:57.040
 that was first proposed by David Lewis Williams at the University of Waterstrand, the same university

1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:02.720
 where Lee Berger is, by the way, in South Africa. So these ideas are old. But what Graham did in

1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:08.320
 that book is just it's well worth your time. It's well worth a few reads actually. Because it was

1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:15.520
 after that that I discovered Breaking Open the Head by Daniel Pinchback and a lot of other books

1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:23.120
 that just kind of blew my mind. What is Breaking Open the Head about? So it's Daniel's romp through

1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:30.960
 contemporary shamanism. And it's his very well told experiences with everything from psilocybin

1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:38.960
 to iboga being initiated by the Buites. And it was the first time I'd read any firsthand accounts,

1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:45.040
 aside from Jeremy Narby, any firsthand accounts by a New Yorker, by the way, about the potential

1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:51.520
 for these compounds that I'd been ignoring for far too long, obviously. And so that's when I

1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:57.040
 started revisiting the Road to Eleusis and looking through the anthropological literature, reading

1:46:57.040 --> 1:47:02.240
 everything Gordon Wasson had ever written, that Carl Ruck had written. And it sent me down a

1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:06.960
 pretty weird rabbit hole until I found Peter Kingsley, which is my second recommendation.

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:14.720
 So Peter, again, he's not a fan of the psychedelic hypothesis. But what he does is I think expose

1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:20.000
 the value of the irrational to the ancient Greeks, especially the pre Socratic. Here we are talking

1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:29.280
 about AI and God and these entangled philosophical questions. The best I can read Kingsley is that

1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:36.160
 Western civilization is a product of a gift from the goddess Persephone. And this is not a hippie.

1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:43.040
 This is a pretty gold standard classicist who went on to write a couple of books. One is In

1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:48.240
 the Dark Places of Wisdom, and the other is Reality. What better way to title your book?

1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:54.320
 Where he talks about these ancient techniques for exploring the irrational. The same thing Carl Ruck

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:59.840
 was talking about. After compiling all this data in the Road to Eleusis, Ruck says that the biggest

1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:05.280
 challenge is trying to convince his colleagues in the late 1970s that the ancient Greeks,

1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:12.480
 and indeed some of the most famous and intelligent among them, could enter so fully into irrationality.

1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:16.720
 Same thing Nietzsche is talking about in his exploration of Dionysus. And so I think

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:24.080
 Kingsley just stands apart as one of those books, Reality, that my life was never quite the same

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:28.320
 after reading that. We talked about the three pound

1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:40.480
 jelly that is able to conceive of the entirety of the fabric of reality in the universe

1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:49.280
 and everything, and also of its own mortality. What do you think is the meaning of it all?

1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:58.160
 What's the meaning of life? Is a three pound jelly able to answer that one?

1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:06.640
 No, but I can plagiarize Joseph Campbell, which is good enough. Joe Campbell says that I don't

1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:12.480
 think what we're looking for is a meaning of life. I think what we're looking for is an experience

1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:19.120
 of being alive so that the experiences we have on the purely physical plane will have resonances

1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.840
 within that are those of our innermost being and reality. You talked about the true reality,

1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:31.360
 absolute truth. These are all constructs. And I think they're constructs that are made day by day

1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:37.200
 and acquire this aura of factuality, remembering Clifford Geertz's definition of religion. We're

1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:42.880
 all just faking it until we make it. And I think a lot of that has to do with moods and motivations

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.640
 and feelings and emotions, which is not to discredit facts and figures. But I think that

1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:56.000
 meaning, meaning making is a very subjective process that is not only difficult to talk about,

1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:02.160
 but difficult to quantify. And experience is a primary in that versus, so like the actual

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:09.520
 subjective experience is primary to the meaning making process versus like some kind of rigorous

1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:17.840
 analysis of like having an algorithm that runs and computes and then finally spits out 42.

1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:24.320
 Well, this is how families are created. Tell me more about this. Well, my wife and I fell in love

1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:29.360
 and made babies. We didn't type up an Excel sheet and figure out the best way to go about this.

1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:32.880
 That's what I've been doing all these years. That's why I'm single.

1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:41.920
 Too many Excel sheets. Well, we say falling in love, right? We say fall in love. What does that

1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:50.080
 mean to fall in love? You are surrendering to an intelligence that is beyond us. You could say a

1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:54.880
 Godlike intelligence. Richard Rohr, the Franciscan friar I mentioned, in the Universal Christ,

1:50:54.880 --> 1:51:02.000
 he writes a lot about how the divine for you is often encountered in the other. In fact,

1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:07.760
 how could it be otherwise? This is bedrock sacramental theology that you find the God in

1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:14.800
 the things in your life as well you should. That's the proving ground for identifying as God rather

1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.600
 than creating a relationship with God. And so I think that these irrational states play a big role

1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:24.960
 in that. Irrational. Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it than on the topic of love.

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:31.600
 Brian, thank you so much for a brilliant exposition of history and the poetry.

1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:37.520
 I really appreciate you talking with me today. I love you, Lex. I love you too, Brian.

1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:44.320
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Muirrescu. And thank you to Inside Tracker,

1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:51.120
 GiveWell, Ni, Indeed, and Masterclass. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.480
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Terrence McKenna about psychedelics.

1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:04.080
 Part of what psychedelics do is they decondition you from cultural values. This is what makes it

1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:09.440
 such a political hot potato. Since all culture is a kind of con game, the most dangerous candy

1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:14.800
 you can hand out is one which causes people to start questioning the rules of the game.

1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:38.800
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
