00:01.040 --> 00:04.260
 Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?

00:07.400 --> 00:10.560
 The following is a conversation with Karl Deisseroth,

00:10.560 --> 00:12.600
 professor of bioengineering, psychiatry,

00:12.600 --> 00:15.600
 and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.200
 He's one of the greatest living psychiatrists

00:18.200 --> 00:20.480
 and neuroscientists in the world.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.600
 He's also just a fascinating human being.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.400
 We discuss both the darkest and the most beautiful places

00:26.400 --> 00:28.560
 that the human mind can take us.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.000
 He explores this in his book called

00:31.000 --> 00:33.840
 Projections, A Story of Human Emotions.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.760
 I highly recommend it.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.300
 It's written masterfully.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.240
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.160
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:42.160 --> 00:43.360
 in the description.

00:43.360 --> 00:47.200
 And now, dear friends, here's Karl Deisseroth.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.600
 You open your book called Projections,

00:50.600 --> 00:53.440
 A Story of Human Emotions with a few beautiful words

00:53.440 --> 00:56.080
 to summarize all of humanity.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.140
 The book draws insights about the human mind

00:58.140 --> 01:01.200
 from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.480
 So if it's okay, let me read a few sentences

01:03.480 --> 01:05.000
 from the opening.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.800
 You gotta give props to beautiful writing when I see it.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.800
 Quote, in the art of weaving, warp threads are structural

01:13.920 --> 01:16.960
 and strong and anchored at the origin,

01:16.960 --> 01:19.200
 creating a frame for crossing fibers

01:19.200 --> 01:21.060
 as the fabric is woven.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.200
 Projecting across the advancing edge into free space,

01:25.200 --> 01:27.840
 warp threads bridge the formed past

01:27.840 --> 01:32.000
 to the ragged present to the yet featureless future.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.720
 Yet featureless future, well done, well done, sir.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.860
 The tapestry of the human story has its own warp threads,

01:38.860 --> 01:41.560
 rooted deep in the gorges of East Africa,

01:41.560 --> 01:44.280
 connecting the shifting textures of human life

01:44.280 --> 01:47.760
 over millions of years, spanning pictographs

01:47.760 --> 01:52.680
 backdroped by crevice ice, by angulated forestry,

01:52.680 --> 01:56.040
 by stone and steel, and by glowing rare earths.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.420
 The inner workings of the mind give form to these threads,

01:59.420 --> 02:01.960
 creating a framework within us,

02:01.960 --> 02:05.760
 upon which the story of each individual can come into being.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.920
 Personal grain and color arise from the crossed threads

02:08.920 --> 02:13.440
 of our moments and experiences, the fine weft of life,

02:13.440 --> 02:16.600
 embedding and obscuring the underlying scaffold

02:16.600 --> 02:19.520
 with intricate and sometimes lovely detail.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.520
 Here are stories of this fabric fraying in those who are ill.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.840
 In the minds of people for whom the warp

02:26.840 --> 02:31.180
 is exposed and raw and revealing.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.020
 What have you learned about human beings,

02:33.020 --> 02:34.560
 human nature and the human mind,

02:34.560 --> 02:38.240
 from those who suffer from psychiatric maladies,

02:38.240 --> 02:41.240
 for those for whom this fabric is warped?

02:41.240 --> 02:43.420
 And one thing we learn as biologists

02:43.420 --> 02:45.560
 is that when something breaks,

02:45.560 --> 02:50.560
 you see what the original unbroken part was for.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.040
 And we see this in genetics, we see this in biochemistry.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.440
 It's known that when you have a mutated gene,

02:57.440 --> 02:59.900
 sometimes the gene is turned up in strength

02:59.900 --> 03:01.320
 or turned down in strength,

03:01.320 --> 03:03.280
 and that lets you see what it was originally for.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.940
 You can infer true function from dysfunction.

03:06.940 --> 03:11.160
 And this is a theme that I thought needed to be shared

03:11.160 --> 03:13.320
 and needed to be made communicable

03:13.320 --> 03:15.080
 to the lay public, to everybody.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.440
 People who, which is, I think, almost all of us,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.800
 who think and care about the inner workings of our mind,

03:21.800 --> 03:26.360
 but who also care for those who have been suffering,

03:26.360 --> 03:31.360
 who have mental health disorders, who face challenges.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.760
 But then more broadly,

03:33.760 --> 03:36.720
 it's a very much larger story than the present.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.960
 There's a story to be told

03:39.960 --> 03:42.200
 where the protagonist really is the human mind.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.400
 And that was one thing I wanted to share as well

03:44.400 --> 03:47.380
 in projections, is that broader story,

03:47.380 --> 03:50.480
 but still anchored in the moment of patients,

03:50.480 --> 03:53.960
 of people, of experiences of the moment.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.320
 Is there a clear line between dysfunction and function,

03:57.320 --> 03:58.600
 disorder and order?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.440
 This is always debated in psychiatry,

04:02.440 --> 04:05.560
 probably more so than any other medical specialty.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.680
 I'm a psychiatrist, I treat patients still.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.320
 I see acutely ill people who come to the emergency room

04:14.320 --> 04:16.520
 where there's no doubt that this is not something

04:16.520 --> 04:19.980
 that's working well, where the manifestation of disease

04:19.980 --> 04:22.980
 is so powerful, where the person is suffering so greatly,

04:22.980 --> 04:26.680
 where they cannot continue as they are.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.000
 But of course, it's a spectrum,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
 and there are people who are closer

04:30.000 --> 04:34.560
 to the realm of being able to work okay in their jobs,

04:34.560 --> 04:36.280
 but suffer from some small dysfunction.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.860
 And everywhere in between.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.400
 In psychiatry, we're careful to say

04:39.400 --> 04:41.160
 we don't call it a disease or a disorder

04:41.160 --> 04:43.200
 unless there's a disruption

04:43.200 --> 04:45.520
 in social or occupational functioning.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.320
 But of course, psychiatry has a long way to go

04:49.320 --> 04:51.800
 in terms of developing quantitative tests.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.840
 We don't have blood draws, we don't have imaging studies

04:55.840 --> 04:57.800
 that we can use to diagnose.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.920
 And so that line, ultimately, that you're asking about

05:00.920 --> 05:04.440
 between order and disorder, function and dysfunction,

05:04.440 --> 05:05.800
 it's operational at the moment.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.960
 How are things working?

05:08.440 --> 05:10.800
 Can we just linger on the terms for a second?

05:10.800 --> 05:15.440
 So this disease, dysfunction,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.960
 how careful should we be using those words?

05:17.960 --> 05:20.220
 Can we just, even in this conversation,

05:21.560 --> 05:24.400
 from a sort of technical perspective,

05:24.400 --> 05:26.560
 but also a human perspective,

05:26.560 --> 05:31.360
 how quick should we be

05:31.360 --> 05:36.360
 in saying that schizophrenia, depression, autism,

05:38.920 --> 05:42.860
 as we kind of go down across the spectrum

05:42.860 --> 05:44.680
 of different maladies,

05:44.680 --> 05:48.720
 to use the word dysfunction and disease?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.760
 I would say to give ourselves license

05:50.760 --> 05:53.000
 to capture the whole spectrum, let's say disorder,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.160
 because that captures truly, I think, the essence of it,

05:57.160 --> 05:59.680
 which is we need to talk about it when it's not working,

05:59.680 --> 06:00.680
 when there's disorder.

06:00.680 --> 06:05.680
 And that's the fairest and most inclusive term to use.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.600
 So is it fair to assume that basically every member

06:12.600 --> 06:15.840
 of the human species suffers from a large number

06:15.840 --> 06:17.380
 of disorders then?

06:17.380 --> 06:22.040
 Well, we just have to pick which ones are debilitating

06:22.040 --> 06:23.080
 for each person?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.200
 You know, if you look at the numbers,

06:25.200 --> 06:29.880
 there are, if you look at how our mental health disorders

06:29.880 --> 06:30.840
 are currently defined,

06:30.840 --> 06:34.560
 you can look at population prevalence values

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
 for all these disorders,

06:35.560 --> 06:37.880
 and you can come up with estimates

06:37.880 --> 06:42.200
 that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence

06:42.200 --> 06:44.680
 of having a psychiatric disorder

06:44.680 --> 06:46.960
 that approaches 25% or so.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.200
 And so that's, and in some studies it could be more,

06:50.200 --> 06:51.480
 some studies it could be less.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.300
 Now, what do we do with that number?

06:53.300 --> 06:54.140
 What does that mean?

06:54.140 --> 06:55.560
 And in some ways, that's the essence

06:55.560 --> 06:58.920
 of what I was hoping to approach with the book,

06:58.920 --> 07:01.080
 is to reflect on this spectrum that exists

07:01.080 --> 07:02.040
 for all the disorders.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.480
 There is, and taking nothing away from the severity

07:05.480 --> 07:07.880
 and the suffering that comes at the extreme end

07:07.880 --> 07:10.480
 of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them exists

07:10.480 --> 07:14.920
 on a spectrum of severity, from nearly functional

07:14.920 --> 07:17.320
 to completely dysfunctional, life threatening,

07:17.320 --> 07:19.240
 and even fatal.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.520
 And so that number, 25%, more or less,

07:22.520 --> 07:27.520
 it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.480
 To look at that number, where do those numbers come from?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.320
 Is it self report?

07:31.320 --> 07:35.080
 Is it people who show up and say, I need help?

07:35.080 --> 07:38.720
 Is it somebody else that points out that person needs help?

07:38.720 --> 07:41.160
 Or is it like estimates that even go beyond that

07:41.160 --> 07:42.880
 for people who don't ask for help

07:42.880 --> 07:45.640
 or are suffering quietly alone?

07:45.640 --> 07:47.600
 When you look at self report numbers,

07:47.600 --> 07:50.780
 then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or more.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.780
 Those, the most rigorous studies are done

07:55.780 --> 07:57.600
 with structured psychiatric interviews

07:57.600 --> 08:02.360
 where people who are trained in eliciting symptoms carefully

08:02.360 --> 08:05.520
 do complete psychiatric inventories of individuals.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.520
 And these are time consuming laborious studies

08:09.520 --> 08:10.860
 that are not often repeated.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.160
 When they're done, they're done well.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.320
 But very often you'll see a report or something

08:16.320 --> 08:19.020
 in the news of a very high number

08:19.020 --> 08:22.080
 for some disorder or symptom.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.500
 And very often, if it's shockingly high,

08:24.500 --> 08:27.880
 that's coming from a self report of a person.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.120
 And so that's another issue that we have, again,

08:31.120 --> 08:33.600
 take nothing away from the severity and reality

08:33.600 --> 08:35.840
 and biological nature of these disorders,

08:35.840 --> 08:37.520
 which are very genetic, very, you know,

08:37.520 --> 08:40.920
 we understand that these are very biological.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.520
 And yet, we lack right now the lab tests

08:43.520 --> 08:45.440
 and the blood draws to make the diagnoses.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.240
 We'll talk about it, just how biological they are,

08:48.240 --> 08:50.560
 because that too is a mystery.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.760
 You know, in terms of from our perspective

08:53.760 --> 08:55.360
 of how to probe into the disease,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.640
 how to understand it, how to help it.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.000
 So some of it could be neurobiological,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.920
 some of it could be just the dance

09:03.920 --> 09:05.680
 of human emotion and interaction.

09:05.680 --> 09:10.680
 And it's like, is love when it works

09:11.160 --> 09:14.400
 and is love when it breaks down biological

09:14.400 --> 09:15.520
 or is it something else?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.320
 So we're gonna talk about it.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.460
 But let me just like to linger in terms of disorder.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.520
 What about genius?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.760
 You know, that sort of cliche saying,

09:25.760 --> 09:28.100
 like the madness and genius

09:28.100 --> 09:30.720
 that they kind of dance together.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.360
 What about if the thing we see as disorder

09:33.360 --> 09:37.540
 is actually genius, unheard or misunderstood?

09:38.560 --> 09:40.280
 Well, here again, the numbers help us.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.720
 And here's where being rigorous

09:41.720 --> 09:43.280
 and quantitative actually really helps.

09:43.280 --> 09:46.160
 If you look at disorders like autism

09:46.160 --> 09:50.240
 and bipolar disorder and eating disorders,

09:50.240 --> 09:52.080
 anorexia nervosa, for example,

09:53.160 --> 09:56.920
 these, you know, particularly bipolar and anorexia,

09:56.920 --> 10:00.760
 these can be fatal, they can cause immense suffering,

10:00.760 --> 10:04.480
 but they are heavily genetic, all three of these.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.760
 And what's very interesting is each one of these three

10:07.760 --> 10:10.440
 is actually correlated positively,

10:10.440 --> 10:13.680
 positively with measures of intelligence,

10:13.680 --> 10:18.240
 of educational attainment, and even of income.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.840
 And so you look at this severe disorders

10:20.840 --> 10:25.480
 in many cases causing quite an immense morbidity

10:25.480 --> 10:28.920
 and mortality, and yet they are positively correlated

10:28.920 --> 10:31.200
 at the population level with positive things.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.640
 Can you say the three again, autism?

10:33.640 --> 10:37.320
 Autism, anorexia, and bipolar disorder.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.400
 Bipolar, right.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.340
 What's that book, forgot the book name,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.520
 but is intelligence a burden?

10:45.240 --> 10:48.080
 Well, you know, people can get into trouble

10:48.080 --> 10:49.560
 when they think they're smarter than they are,

10:49.560 --> 10:50.500
 I will say that.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.440
 I don't know.

10:52.440 --> 10:56.840
 Sometimes, like, in the deepest meaning of that statement,

10:56.840 --> 10:58.220
 I think ignorance is bliss.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.940
 I'm a big fan of Prince Mishkin from The Idiot

11:00.940 --> 11:04.420
 and Aliosha from Brother Karamazov.

11:04.420 --> 11:08.120
 Optimism can be seen as naivety and dumbness,

11:08.120 --> 11:12.060
 but I think it's a kind of deep intelligence.

11:13.200 --> 11:17.920
 Maybe inability to reason sort of about the mechanics

11:17.920 --> 11:20.680
 of the world, but instead kind of feel the world.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.280
 It seems like that's one of the paths to happiness.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.120
 There is.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.880
 How much you think versus how much you feel,

11:26.880 --> 11:28.160
 this comes up all the time.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.640
 In medicine, we encounter this all the time.

11:31.640 --> 11:36.120
 Day after day, you encounter the abyss of suffering

11:36.120 --> 11:36.960
 from patients.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.420
 How much do you let yourself feel?

11:39.500 --> 11:44.500
 Or how much do you make it abstract and objective

11:44.560 --> 11:46.580
 and try to make it clinical?

11:46.580 --> 11:49.080
 And that range, how you're able to move yourself

11:49.080 --> 11:52.960
 on that spectrum, is very important for survival

11:52.960 --> 11:57.800
 as a physician, and the way you protect yourself

11:57.800 --> 12:00.200
 and your feelings turns out to be very important.

12:00.200 --> 12:04.120
 You quote Finnegan's Wake, mad props for that,

12:04.120 --> 12:05.200
 James Joyce book.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.740
 I took a class in James Joyce in college.

12:07.740 --> 12:10.600
 I think I read parts of Finnegan's Wake.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.440
 I might have been on drugs of some kind,

12:12.440 --> 12:15.720
 or I somehow got an A in that class,

12:15.720 --> 12:18.000
 which probably refers to some kind of curve

12:18.000 --> 12:19.800
 where nobody understood anything.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.420
 The only thing I understood and really enjoyed

12:21.420 --> 12:24.720
 is his short stories, The Dead, and then Ulysses.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.360
 I kind of, I think, read a few Cliff Notes

12:27.360 --> 12:28.880
 that kind of got to the point,

12:28.880 --> 12:31.320
 and then Finnegan's Wake was just a hopeless.

12:34.260 --> 12:35.680
 For people who haven't looked at it,

12:35.680 --> 12:38.180
 maybe you can elucidate to me better,

12:38.180 --> 12:43.180
 but I felt like I was reading things, words,

12:43.400 --> 12:47.760
 and the words made sense, like standing next to each other,

12:47.760 --> 12:51.520
 but when you kind of read for a while,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.000
 you realize you didn't actually understand

12:53.000 --> 12:54.080
 anything that was said.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.880
 Right, but did you have a feeling, though?

12:55.880 --> 12:59.280
 That's one thing I found interesting about Finnegan's Wake.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.600
 I never fully understood it,

13:00.600 --> 13:02.240
 but the words caused feelings in me,

13:02.240 --> 13:03.880
 which I found fascinating,

13:03.880 --> 13:06.840
 and sometimes I couldn't predict it

13:06.840 --> 13:09.680
 from the semantic black and white context

13:09.680 --> 13:11.960
 of what I was seeing in front of me on the page,

13:11.960 --> 13:13.240
 but the rhythm or the melody

13:13.240 --> 13:14.520
 would make me feel certain ways,

13:14.520 --> 13:17.600
 and that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.880
 Of course, that was his, he existed on a spectrum, too,

13:20.880 --> 13:24.920
 and he wrote, as you say, more accessible works.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.440
 I learned a lot about Irish history

13:26.440 --> 13:28.740
 from Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,

13:28.740 --> 13:31.120
 and there was just, he could be as objective

13:31.120 --> 13:35.240
 as he wanted to be, but then when he let himself loose,

13:35.240 --> 13:37.780
 he was in this realm where the words

13:37.780 --> 13:42.680
 had their own purpose separate from semantic meaning

13:42.680 --> 13:46.120
 from their dry dictionary definition.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.360
 You know, there's a funny story that was told,

13:48.360 --> 13:49.700
 doesn't matter if it's true or not,

13:49.700 --> 13:53.000
 but they said that James Joyce, when he was young,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.360
 when he was in his teen years,

13:54.360 --> 13:57.800
 would go around sort of Ireland drinking and so on

13:57.800 --> 14:00.040
 and telling everybody that he's going to be one of,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.040
 if not the greatest writers of the 20th century,

14:03.040 --> 14:06.980
 and he turned out to be that.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.740
 So I always think about that little story

14:09.740 --> 14:10.840
 that somebody told me,

14:11.700 --> 14:14.160
 because I have a lot of people come up to me,

14:14.160 --> 14:16.260
 including myself, I'm a bit of a dreamer.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.480
 You get into certain moods where you say

14:19.480 --> 14:22.780
 I'm going to be the greatest anything ever.

14:22.780 --> 14:27.200
 You get people tell you this, especially young people,

14:27.200 --> 14:32.200
 and it kind of, it makes me feel all kinds of ways,

14:32.200 --> 14:36.240
 but that story reminds me that you just might be

14:36.240 --> 14:39.400
 one of the greatest writers of the 21st century,

14:39.400 --> 14:41.440
 for example, if somebody were to tell me that,

14:41.440 --> 14:44.960
 and don't immediately disregard that,

14:44.960 --> 14:47.320
 because one of the people that say that,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.320
 that's almost like a precondition,

14:49.320 --> 14:51.600
 that's a good requirement just to believe in yourself.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.080
 Maybe it's not a full requirement,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.240
 but it's an interesting story.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.300
 I think when someone tells you that,

14:58.300 --> 15:02.880
 then it creates, one sees an opportunity,

15:02.880 --> 15:03.960
 and then it would be a tragedy

15:03.960 --> 15:05.560
 if the opportunity weren't captured, right?

15:05.560 --> 15:09.080
 And so then that creates some impetus,

15:09.080 --> 15:12.000
 some motivation to do something good.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.320
 I think the mind, it's like, I guess that's what

15:16.320 --> 15:18.820
 books or whatever, I don't even know if it's a book,

15:18.820 --> 15:21.320
 The Secret plugs into, they kind of make

15:21.320 --> 15:23.440
 a whole industry out of it.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.200
 But there is something about the mind

15:26.200 --> 15:28.400
 believing something, making it a reality.

15:28.400 --> 15:32.040
 It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs,

15:32.040 --> 15:35.840
 your belief in yourself, your belief in an idea,

15:35.840 --> 15:39.080
 sort of embracing the me versus the world,

15:39.080 --> 15:42.000
 embracing the madness of this idea

15:42.000 --> 15:44.420
 and making it a life pursuit,

15:44.420 --> 15:46.440
 somehow morphs reality around you

15:46.440 --> 15:48.620
 for some tiny fraction of the population.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.960
 For everybody else, you descend into

15:54.080 --> 15:56.680
 all the beautiful ways that failure

15:56.680 --> 15:59.400
 materializes in our lifetime.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.920
 Well, you know, you mentioned love earlier.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.800
 I mean, that's a great example of how

16:02.800 --> 16:05.360
 belief in something makes it real, right?

16:05.360 --> 16:08.200
 It's not reasonable on the face of it,

16:08.200 --> 16:09.560
 but because you believe it's reasonable,

16:09.560 --> 16:10.920
 then it actually does become reasonable,

16:10.920 --> 16:11.760
 and then it is real.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.120
 And so that's a good example.

16:13.120 --> 16:13.960
 That doesn't happen.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.960
 I'm also in a bioengineering department.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.480
 We don't imagine that a bridge is soundly built

16:18.480 --> 16:19.520
 and then it is soundly built.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.760
 That's something that, it doesn't come up

16:21.760 --> 16:23.280
 in too many realms of human existence,

16:23.280 --> 16:24.520
 but love is one of them.

16:24.520 --> 16:29.520
 And the ability to have a fixed idea

16:29.560 --> 16:32.400
 and to say it's true, and then it is true.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.600
 A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.000
 So maybe it does work a little bit,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.400
 but it can break down like Chernobyl did.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.200
 You can't just say it's safe.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.320
 You have to also prove it's safe.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.880
 But on Finnegan's Wake, I think,

16:45.880 --> 16:47.120
 maybe correct me if I'm wrong,

16:47.120 --> 16:48.760
 you're using kind of Finnegan's Wake

16:48.760 --> 16:52.320
 to give one perspective on what madness is,

16:52.320 --> 16:53.760
 of what's going on in the mind.

16:53.760 --> 16:58.760
 How much of that is that we're simply unable

16:59.600 --> 17:01.000
 to communicate with the person

17:01.000 --> 17:03.800
 on the other side of their mind?

17:03.800 --> 17:07.560
 Like there's almost like a little person inside the brain

17:07.560 --> 17:10.360
 and they have some circuitry that's used

17:10.360 --> 17:12.840
 to communicate emotion, communicate ideas

17:12.840 --> 17:14.040
 to the outside world.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.640
 And there's something about that circuitry

17:15.640 --> 17:17.200
 that makes it difficult to communicate

17:17.200 --> 17:18.880
 with the little person on the other side.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.200
 So if you look at what shows up in schizophrenia,

17:21.200 --> 17:25.160
 with many cases, what we call thought disorders,

17:25.160 --> 17:30.040
 what we call the individual speech symptoms

17:30.040 --> 17:33.720
 of schizophrenia, Finnegan's Wake is loaded with them.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.160
 And it's just full of them.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.880
 We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia

17:39.880 --> 17:44.000
 where the word that is said echoes in some way

17:44.000 --> 17:44.840
 the previous word.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.920
 And we call that a clang association

17:46.920 --> 17:47.880
 because there's no other reason

17:47.880 --> 17:49.320
 than the similarity of the sound,

17:49.320 --> 17:53.200
 like a clang of a garage door being hit.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.600
 And it has a, and sometimes it's not even a word,

17:56.600 --> 17:59.960
 and we call that a neologism, a new word being created.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.200
 And of course, Finnegan's Wake is full of that.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.200
 And then we also, in schizophrenia,

18:05.200 --> 18:06.960
 where there's what we call loose associations

18:06.960 --> 18:10.000
 or tangential thought processes,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.840
 of course, full of that where things just go off

18:11.840 --> 18:15.280
 in directions that are not linear or logical.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.640
 And you can't read Finnegan's Wake, I think,

18:18.640 --> 18:21.480
 without, certainly as a psychiatrist,

18:21.480 --> 18:24.120
 you can't read it without thinking about schizophrenia.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.440
 And then when we look at the families of people

18:27.440 --> 18:30.560
 with schizophrenia, and Joyce was no exception,

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
 there very often are people within the family

18:32.560 --> 18:33.840
 who are on the spectrum.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.960
 Some have it.

18:34.960 --> 18:39.120
 Some are able to see it from a distance,

18:39.120 --> 18:40.840
 from a safe distance.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.040
 There's an association between schizophrenia

18:43.040 --> 18:46.600
 and what we call schizotypal personality disorder

18:46.600 --> 18:49.880
 where people are not quite in this severe state

18:49.880 --> 18:51.880
 of schizophrenia but have some magical thinking,

18:51.880 --> 18:54.560
 have some unusual thought patterns.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.040
 Very often, those are family members

18:56.040 --> 18:57.640
 of people with schizophrenia.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.160
 So this points to this, again, to this idea

19:00.160 --> 19:05.160
 that there is a range, even along this very severe,

19:05.800 --> 19:09.440
 very genetic biological illness that human beings dwell

19:09.440 --> 19:11.480
 on different spots along that spectrum.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.360
 I should mention that we have my friend, Sergey,

19:14.360 --> 19:16.840
 pulling up stuff, young Sergey or old Sergey,

19:16.840 --> 19:17.760
 I don't know what to call you,

19:17.760 --> 19:21.720
 but there's drafts of Finnegan's Wake.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.080
 Yeah, I actually saw pictures of this from,

19:25.480 --> 19:27.080
 I think it was on Instagram or something.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.240
 These are early drafts of Finnegan's Wake.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.400
 And it's so beautiful to see.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.960
 For people who are just listening,

19:31.960 --> 19:34.760
 there's just random paragraphs and writing

19:34.760 --> 19:37.080
 all over the page with stuff crossed out.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.280
 And it's great to see that Joyce himself

19:40.280 --> 19:41.920
 was thinking in this kind of way

19:41.920 --> 19:44.760
 as you're putting it together.

19:44.760 --> 19:45.960
 How much do you think he was thinking

19:45.960 --> 19:48.320
 about the schizophrenic mind?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.160
 I think a lot.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.520
 I think it's known that his daughter suffered

19:51.520 --> 19:52.880
 from schizophrenia.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.840
 And this is, what's depicted here on the page

19:56.840 --> 20:00.600
 is something that I'm sure he either felt himself

20:00.600 --> 20:03.440
 in some level was able to access

20:03.440 --> 20:06.280
 this nonlinearity of processing

20:06.280 --> 20:10.600
 or had seen enough in family that he knew what it was

20:10.600 --> 20:13.360
 and was able to reflect it down

20:13.360 --> 20:14.560
 in black and white on the paper.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.640
 So what he was able to do was quite authentic

20:17.640 --> 20:19.240
 in that sense.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.880
 Of course, I don't want to pigeonhole him.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.760
 He was doing much more than that.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.440
 It was much more than talking about altered human

20:29.400 --> 20:31.320
 thought processes and thought disorders.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.800
 But that was an aspect that he was so good at representing

20:34.800 --> 20:37.560
 that it had to be intentional to some extent.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.760
 And a tiny tangent.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.000
 What does your own writing look like for this book?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.240
 Because it's extremely well written.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.040
 How many edits?

20:46.040 --> 20:48.120
 Did you just drink some whiskey

20:48.120 --> 20:51.440
 and like I'm imagining Hemingway style?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.480
 What's a very different, the writing is very different.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.680
 I mean, it's really, really well written,

20:55.680 --> 21:00.200
 which was like, I was reading it.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.240
 It makes you realize,

21:01.240 --> 21:03.640
 because I was expecting sort of a science kind of,

21:03.640 --> 21:08.640
 which it is like elucidating something

21:08.640 --> 21:09.920
 about the human mind kind of thing.

21:09.920 --> 21:14.920
 But you could also probably write really strong novels.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.000
 So maybe that's in the future.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.560
 But anyway, what is your, how many edits?

21:19.560 --> 21:20.400
 What's your style?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.320
 Does it look like that?

21:21.320 --> 21:22.880
 Is it more structured, organized?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.440
 Unfortunately, I used a laptop,

21:24.440 --> 21:26.480
 so I didn't have this sort of a beautiful record.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.520
 No typewriters, cigarette, and whiskey.

21:29.520 --> 21:33.120
 I did explore which was their particular altered state

21:33.120 --> 21:34.880
 that would help me to be most creative.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.240
 And I found actually, I actually did the best

21:38.240 --> 21:42.640
 while sober, but slightly disinhibited

21:42.640 --> 21:46.320
 in the late hours of the night or early morning.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.680
 Yeah, particularly late hours of the night there.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.400
 I have a friend who would tell me

21:52.400 --> 21:54.680
 that she thought that very early in the morning,

21:54.680 --> 21:57.160
 her inner critic was still asleep

21:57.160 --> 21:59.280
 and she could write more effectively

21:59.280 --> 22:01.320
 before her inner critic woke up.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.840
 And I actually found that outstanding advice for me

22:03.840 --> 22:07.000
 that I often found that I was looser

22:07.000 --> 22:09.360
 and could write more in the morning.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.120
 But the other interesting thing is each chapter,

22:12.120 --> 22:15.520
 each story, it's about a different human being

22:15.520 --> 22:18.440
 with a different class of psychiatric disorder.

22:18.440 --> 22:22.880
 That's what each story, each chapter is anchored in.

22:22.880 --> 22:27.880
 But I'm trying to use words and style of writing

22:27.960 --> 22:32.960
 and diction that captures the feeling of the disorder.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.840
 And so it's different in each story.

22:34.840 --> 22:39.480
 In the story about mania, which is a very expansive,

22:39.480 --> 22:43.240
 exuberant, at least briefly uplifting state

22:43.240 --> 22:45.160
 where the words come out in a torrent

22:45.160 --> 22:48.600
 and they're complex and pressured and elaborate.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.280
 I try to capture that feeling

22:50.280 --> 22:52.480
 with the words used in that chapter.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.560
 And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter,

22:56.560 --> 22:58.440
 where things slowly fragment over time

22:58.440 --> 23:01.840
 and become looser and separated,

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
 I try to capture that in the writing too.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.720
 So for each, it wasn't as if there was a single mode

23:06.720 --> 23:08.320
 I could be in for the whole book.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.240
 For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode

23:11.240 --> 23:14.400
 to capture that inner feeling of the disorder.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.520
 When you put yourself in that mode, does that change you?

23:17.520 --> 23:19.900
 Yeah, I couldn't turn it on and off right away.

23:19.900 --> 23:23.880
 I had to, first I would start by thinking about the person

23:23.880 --> 23:26.240
 or the people, one or two people based on real patients

23:26.240 --> 23:29.960
 and the stories that are put forth.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.360
 The symptom descriptions are real,

23:31.360 --> 23:32.240
 they're from the patients.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.400
 Of course, all details change to protect privacy,

23:35.400 --> 23:38.040
 but the actual symptom descriptions are real.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.240
 And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit

23:41.240 --> 23:45.640
 the space of the mind of that person that I knew.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.520
 And that's not instantaneous.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.840
 It would take some time.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.200
 I needed quiet, I needed to be still.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.700
 That's another reason late at night is good.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.800
 Sergey posted that drowsiness gives creativity boosts,

23:56.800 --> 23:58.840
 according to Andrew Huberman.

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
 Thank you, Andrew.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.160
 He's not wrong, he's not wrong.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.840
 Why projections?

24:04.840 --> 24:09.840
 Is it, I mean, instead of putting words into your mouth,

24:09.840 --> 24:11.320
 because I can imagine a lot.

24:11.320 --> 24:15.680
 I mean, to me, I will start putting words in your mouth,

24:15.680 --> 24:16.920
 despite what I just said.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.480
 So, I mean, to me, projections,

24:20.480 --> 24:22.000
 working on neural networks, for example,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.360
 from an artificial neural networks,

24:23.360 --> 24:25.240
 from a machine learning perspective,

24:25.240 --> 24:27.520
 it's often, that's exactly what you're doing.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.280
 You have an incredibly complex thing

24:29.280 --> 24:32.960
 and you're trying to find simple representations

24:32.960 --> 24:34.640
 in order for you to make sense of it.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.760
 So I was kind of thinking about in that way,

24:36.760 --> 24:41.760
 which is like this incredibly complex neural network

24:43.080 --> 24:46.920
 that is kind of projecting itself onto the world

24:46.920 --> 24:51.040
 through this low bandwidth expression of emotion and speech

24:51.040 --> 24:52.280
 and all that kind of stuff.

24:52.280 --> 24:57.000
 And the way it's, we only have that window into your soul,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.440
 the eyes and the speech and so on.

24:58.440 --> 25:03.440
 So in that way, when there's any kind of disorder,

25:03.440 --> 25:08.160
 we get to only see that disorder through that narrow window

25:08.160 --> 25:11.120
 as opposed to the full complexity of its origins.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.880
 The word projections definitely serves that purpose here,

25:13.880 --> 25:17.640
 but it's got a few other really appropriate

25:17.640 --> 25:19.360
 other connotations as well.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.920
 So the first thing is a projection

25:20.920 --> 25:24.800
 in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection

25:24.800 --> 25:26.880
 that goes from one part of the brain to another.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.560
 And so it's what binds two parts of our brain together.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.080
 There are projections, long range connections

25:33.080 --> 25:36.040
 of axons, these are the outgoing threads

25:36.040 --> 25:39.760
 that connect one part of the brain to another part.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.920
 There's a projection that links, for example,

25:41.920 --> 25:45.720
 auditory cortex where we hear things to reward centers

25:45.720 --> 25:48.360
 where we can feel, where feelings of pleasure

25:48.360 --> 25:50.080
 and reward are initiated.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.440
 And it's been shown that if you have reduced connectivity

25:53.440 --> 25:56.520
 along that dimension, you are less able to enjoy music.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.720
 And so these connections, these projections matter.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.880
 They define how effectively two parts of the brain

26:01.880 --> 26:04.520
 can engage with each other and join together

26:04.520 --> 26:07.760
 to form a joint representation of something.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.360
 So that's one meaning, it's pure neuroscience.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.440
 The word projection is used all the time.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.800
 And it happens to be something that optogenetics,

26:13.800 --> 26:16.040
 a technique that maybe we'll talk about a little later

26:16.040 --> 26:17.200
 that works particularly well with,

26:17.200 --> 26:19.960
 we can use light to turn on or off the activity

26:19.960 --> 26:22.200
 along these projections from one spot of the brain

26:22.200 --> 26:23.040
 to another.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.080
 And this is particularly referring

26:24.080 --> 26:25.840
 to the long range connections.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.360
 It's particularly straightforward

26:27.360 --> 26:28.700
 along these long range projections

26:28.700 --> 26:29.840
 that connect different parts of the brain,

26:29.840 --> 26:32.040
 but it works over shorter range too.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.120
 But then there's this other meaning of projections

26:34.120 --> 26:35.760
 which you were bringing up, which is very relevant,

26:35.760 --> 26:39.040
 which is at some point you can reduce something

26:39.040 --> 26:41.120
 from one level of dimensionality to another,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.280
 and you can project down into a lower dimensional space,

26:43.280 --> 26:44.840
 for example.

26:44.840 --> 26:49.200
 And then finally, there's a psychiatric term projections

26:49.200 --> 26:54.120
 which comes up all the time, which is we very often

26:54.120 --> 26:56.440
 will look at our internal states

26:56.440 --> 26:57.720
 and to understand somebody else,

26:57.720 --> 27:00.520
 we'll project them onto somebody else.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.840
 We'll try to understand someone else's behavior

27:02.840 --> 27:06.440
 and make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings,

27:06.440 --> 27:10.880
 our own sort of narrative onto them

27:10.880 --> 27:15.040
 and use that as a way to help us understand them better.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.140
 And we'll do the reverse too.

27:16.140 --> 27:18.400
 We'll take things we see in the outside world

27:18.400 --> 27:19.660
 and we'll bring them into ourselves

27:19.660 --> 27:21.480
 and see how well they map, how well they align.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.220
 That's called introjection.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.840
 So projections turns out to be a really rich word.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.320
 And then finally, of course, there's the very common

27:28.320 --> 27:31.940
 sense of it as a projector that illuminates

27:31.940 --> 27:35.920
 by conveying information across space with light.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.280
 So for English, for English language,

27:38.280 --> 27:40.200
 perfect word to use for this book.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.360
 But what's funny is not every,

27:43.260 --> 27:45.000
 there are a lot of international translations now

27:45.000 --> 27:46.760
 and all those rich connotations

27:46.760 --> 27:48.660
 aren't captured in other languages.

27:48.660 --> 27:53.400
 And so for some translations, connections is used

27:53.400 --> 27:54.400
 instead of projections.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.120
 In fact, even in England,

27:56.120 --> 27:58.320
 the British version is connections instead of projections

27:58.320 --> 28:00.040
 because apparently projections

28:00.040 --> 28:02.600
 doesn't have the full connotation, I was told.

28:02.600 --> 28:06.560
 So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity

28:06.560 --> 28:09.920
 of meaning with connections, that's interesting.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.680
 I mean, connect, man, words are so interesting.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.000
 They have so many meaning.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.960
 I love language and how much is lost in translation.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.760
 I'm very fortunate enough to be able to speak.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.760
 I'm not good at languages.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.520
 I was just, I guess, forced to by life's circumstance

28:24.520 --> 28:27.720
 to learn two languages, Russian and English.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.640
 And it's just so interesting to watch

28:29.640 --> 28:31.420
 how much of culture, how much of people,

28:31.420 --> 28:34.280
 how much of history is lost in translation.

28:35.240 --> 28:39.960
 The poetry, the music, the history, the pain,

28:39.960 --> 28:41.880
 the way the scientists actually express themselves,

28:41.880 --> 28:43.000
 which is funny.

28:43.000 --> 28:52.000
 I mean, it's so sad to see how much brilliant work

28:52.000 --> 28:53.440
 that was written in Russian.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.960
 There's a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union

28:56.960 --> 28:58.000
 that is now lost.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.120
 It makes me wonder, in the modern day,

29:01.120 --> 29:04.200
 how much incredible science is going on in China

29:05.160 --> 29:07.000
 that is lost in translation.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.040
 And I'll never, I mean, that makes me very sad

29:09.040 --> 29:13.360
 because I'll never learn Chinese in the same way

29:13.360 --> 29:15.800
 that I've learned English and Russian.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.900
 Maybe, whenever I say stuff like that,

29:17.900 --> 29:19.800
 people are like, well, there's still time.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.820
 But, you know, yeah, that's actually fair,

29:23.820 --> 29:28.820
 that I think the 21st century, both China and U.S.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.640
 will have very important roles in the scientific development

29:33.640 --> 29:36.880
 and we should actually bridge the gap through language.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.440
 And that doesn't just mean convincing Chinese

29:39.440 --> 29:40.680
 to speak English.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.240
 That means also learning Chinese.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.440
 Well, we need these bridge people who can do both.

29:45.440 --> 29:50.120
 You know, Nabokov, for example, writing in English

29:50.120 --> 29:53.600
 beautifully, one of my favorite poets, Borges,

29:53.600 --> 29:56.960
 who I mentioned earlier, he wrote both in English

29:56.960 --> 30:00.760
 and in Spanish, I think beautifully in both.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.600
 We need those people who can serve as bridges

30:03.600 --> 30:06.960
 across cultures who really can do both.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.400
 You mentioned Borges, so you open your book

30:10.400 --> 30:14.720
 with a few lines from a poem by Jorge Luis Borges,

30:14.720 --> 30:15.880
 a love poem.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.660
 I'm gonna read parts of it because it's a damn good poem.

30:18.660 --> 30:20.380
 It's called Two English Poems.

30:20.380 --> 30:24.080
 I mean, there's, I'd like to understand why you used it

30:24.080 --> 30:27.480
 and the specific parts you used, which is interesting.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.440
 But then when I read the full thing,

30:30.440 --> 30:35.440
 so I think you used it as a sort of beautiful description

30:36.340 --> 30:39.060
 of what it means to delve deep into understanding,

30:40.080 --> 30:42.440
 offering yourself to the task of understanding

30:42.440 --> 30:43.960
 another human being.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.000
 But if you look at the full context of the poem,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.080
 it's also a damn good description of being hit by love

30:49.080 --> 30:52.760
 and overtaken by it and sort of,

30:52.760 --> 30:56.560
 and trying to figure out how to make sense of the world

30:56.560 --> 30:59.320
 now that you've been stricken by it.

30:59.320 --> 31:03.800
 It says a bunch of things about chatting

31:03.800 --> 31:06.020
 and significantly with friends and all those kinds of things

31:06.020 --> 31:10.600
 and then the poem reads, the big wave brought you.

31:10.600 --> 31:14.160
 I get, this is the moment, I guess, of the universe

31:14.160 --> 31:16.720
 where the two people you fall in love.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.800
 Maybe I'm totally misreading this poem, by the way.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.720
 Doesn't matter, you can't misread a poem.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.720
 So it goes on, words, any words, your laughter,

31:25.880 --> 31:28.900
 and you're so lazily and incessantly beautiful.

31:28.900 --> 31:31.880
 We talked and you have forgotten the words.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.600
 The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street

31:34.600 --> 31:37.720
 of my city, your profile turned away.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.280
 The sounds that go to make your name.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.120
 The lilt of your laughter.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.240
 These are the illustrious toys you have left me.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.280
 So these little memories of these peculiar little details,

31:48.280 --> 31:51.040
 he remembers, those are the illustrious toys.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.160
 I apologize to mix my own words with the poem,

31:53.160 --> 31:55.640
 but you should definitely read it.

31:55.640 --> 31:58.640
 I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.840
 I find them.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.760
 I tell them to the few stray dogs

32:01.760 --> 32:03.980
 and to the few stray stars of the dawn.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.080
 Your dark, rich life.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.620
 I must get at you somehow.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.500
 I put away those illustrious toys you have left me.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.000
 I want your hidden look, your real smile.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.080
 That lonely, mocking smile your cool mirror knows.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.980
 I want your hidden look, your real smile.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.060
 So this is the first part of the poem,

32:28.060 --> 32:30.740
 and then it goes on, which is some of the parts

32:30.740 --> 32:31.940
 that you reference.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.000
 Second part is, what can I hold you with?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.500
 I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets,

32:38.500 --> 32:40.320
 the moon of the jagged suburbs.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.080
 I offer you the bitterness of a man

32:42.080 --> 32:45.220
 who has looked long and long at a lonely moon.

32:45.220 --> 32:48.440
 I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,

32:48.440 --> 32:51.340
 the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze.

32:51.340 --> 32:55.200
 My father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires,

32:55.200 --> 32:57.780
 two bullets through his lungs, and so on, so on.

32:57.780 --> 33:00.480
 I offer you whatever insights my books may hold,

33:00.480 --> 33:02.580
 whatever manliness or humor in my life.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.800
 I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.040
 I offer you that carnival of myself

33:08.040 --> 33:10.080
 that I have saved somehow, the central heart

33:10.080 --> 33:14.120
 that deals not in words, traffics, not with dreams,

33:14.120 --> 33:18.560
 and is untouched by time, my joy, and adversities.

33:18.560 --> 33:22.080
 And I think this is the part that you include in the book.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.600
 I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset,

33:25.600 --> 33:30.600
 years before you were born, I, damn, that's a good line.

33:30.680 --> 33:35.280
 Okay, I offer you explanations of yourself,

33:35.280 --> 33:36.520
 theories about yourself,

33:36.520 --> 33:39.080
 authentic and surprising news of yourself.

33:39.080 --> 33:42.000
 I can give you my loneliness, my darkness,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.560
 the hunger of my heart.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.640
 I'm trying to bribe you with uncertainty,

33:45.640 --> 33:47.720
 with danger, with defeat.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.980
 That is a man who's in love and longing.

33:49.980 --> 33:52.960
 If I've taken, but I just wanna go back to,

33:52.960 --> 33:55.120
 maybe you could say why you wanted to include that poem,

33:55.120 --> 34:00.080
 but also your dark, rich life, I must get at you somehow.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.440
 I put away those illustrious toys you have left me at.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.080
 I want your hidden look, your real smile,

34:06.080 --> 34:09.040
 that lonely, mocking smile, your cool mirror nose.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.100
 Sometimes I meet a stranger, and I just,

34:13.320 --> 34:15.920
 it's like a double take.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.820
 It's like, who are you?

34:17.820 --> 34:19.480
 Have we met before somewhere?

34:19.480 --> 34:22.320
 Who's that person behind there?

34:22.320 --> 34:25.000
 And I wanna get at that, whatever that is.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
 And of course, maybe that's what love is,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.200
 because maybe that's the whole pursuit,

34:30.200 --> 34:32.360
 like a lifelong pursuit of getting at that person.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.640
 Maybe that's what that is,

34:33.640 --> 34:37.960
 and like that insatiable sort of curiosity to keep getting.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.400
 Like, well, who is that person in your own private life?

34:40.400 --> 34:42.680
 Yeah, so that, absolutely, I think that,

34:42.680 --> 34:44.900
 it was a beautiful description of what you just said,

34:44.900 --> 34:46.840
 when there's that first moment,

34:46.840 --> 34:48.880
 and then you wanna dive deeper.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.160
 You want to know what the hidden mysteries are.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.280
 In a way, it's a love poem.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.540
 As a scientist, though, it also,

34:58.480 --> 35:01.120
 it's a bit of how a scientist can love science,

35:01.120 --> 35:06.120
 and that wanting to dive deeper is,

35:07.560 --> 35:09.760
 it's almost like, again, where the,

35:09.760 --> 35:10.840
 it could be a love affair

35:10.840 --> 35:13.320
 with investigating the human mind, for example.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.600
 And that was one reason it spoke to me also.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.160
 Again, thinking about the broader sweep

35:19.160 --> 35:20.860
 of where the human mind came from,

35:20.860 --> 35:25.020
 and the steps it took to get where it is today,

35:25.020 --> 35:26.940
 what was given up along the way,

35:26.940 --> 35:28.180
 what compromises were made.

35:28.180 --> 35:29.780
 And here's where the darkness of the poem

35:29.780 --> 35:31.500
 starts to come in a little bit, too.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.060
 It doesn't shy away from the negativity,

35:35.060 --> 35:39.100
 from the confusion, from the danger.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.340
 And then at the very end,

35:42.120 --> 35:46.540
 the boardface is offering up scenes from his life,

35:46.540 --> 35:49.540
 parts of himself, and this is how we connect with people.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.940
 We offer up parts of ourselves, just here it is,

35:51.940 --> 35:54.640
 and then we see how well does that map onto what you have.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.780
 And it's that offering up that I liked,

35:57.780 --> 36:00.380
 and not the good stuff, or not only the good stuff.

36:00.380 --> 36:01.380
 The yellow rose is nice,

36:01.380 --> 36:03.660
 but he's offering up the bad stuff, too.

36:03.660 --> 36:06.260
 And that, to me, was important for the book,

36:06.260 --> 36:10.000
 because I'm offering up hard stuff, too.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.220
 In fact, a lot of it.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.420
 And also, hard stuff from within me,

36:13.420 --> 36:15.080
 from my own personal side, too.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.460
 And that was, there's a lot of vulnerability

36:17.460 --> 36:20.180
 that comes with that, but that comes with love,

36:20.180 --> 36:21.300
 that comes with writing.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.540
 You have to be open, you have to be vulnerable.

36:23.540 --> 36:28.180
 And so, I thought that reflected what I was trying to do,

36:28.180 --> 36:29.740
 and I thought it was, as an epigraph,

36:29.740 --> 36:33.740
 it kind of made it clear how vulnerable I was

36:33.740 --> 36:38.260
 in taking this step, but also what could come out of it.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.620
 And also, in a meta way,

36:39.620 --> 36:41.820
 because I was not familiar with this poem,

36:41.820 --> 36:46.820
 it made me curious of the poem itself

36:47.620 --> 36:51.260
 to pull at that thread of finding out more.

36:51.260 --> 36:53.300
 You picked a very particular part

36:53.300 --> 36:57.660
 that kind of made you want to pull at that thread,

36:57.660 --> 37:02.660
 and see where did these few lines come from?

37:02.940 --> 37:05.780
 Because I read it as a curiosity of a scientist,

37:05.780 --> 37:08.380
 those lines alone.

37:08.380 --> 37:13.300
 And also, as a desperate human being,

37:13.300 --> 37:17.340
 searching, like offering himself for an understanding,

37:17.340 --> 37:19.500
 or connection with another human being.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.980
 And then, because I wasn't sure if it's a love poem or not,

37:21.980 --> 37:23.700
 or if it's desperation, or if it's curiosity,

37:23.700 --> 37:26.220
 whatever it is, and then you see the love poem.

37:26.220 --> 37:28.300
 I mean, I don't know, that's gonna stick with me

37:28.300 --> 37:32.180
 for a while, your dark, rich life.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.340
 And then a few lines in here are just,

37:35.340 --> 37:38.500
 I mean, those are, I'm gonna just use them

37:38.500 --> 37:40.260
 as pickup lines at a bar.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.420
 I offer you the memory of a yellow rose

37:42.420 --> 37:44.900
 seen at sunset years before you were born.

37:47.380 --> 37:48.900
 No, that's a pickup line I've never heard,

37:48.900 --> 37:51.460
 if I've ever heard one, anyway, sorry.

37:51.460 --> 37:52.300
 But this is universal.

37:52.300 --> 37:55.500
 You see it in so many forms of art.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.340
 Like, we're in Texas now,

37:57.340 --> 38:00.020
 you see this in country and western songs.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.100
 It's often a list of things.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.620
 Like, here's how I describe myself.

38:03.620 --> 38:04.460
 There's this, and there's that,

38:04.460 --> 38:06.300
 and there's the other thing, and here you are.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.900
 These things matter to me,

38:07.900 --> 38:09.260
 and I hope they matter to you, too.

38:09.260 --> 38:11.060
 It's a pretty universal form,

38:11.060 --> 38:13.780
 but he did it in this very artful

38:14.700 --> 38:16.780
 and very vulnerable way.

38:16.780 --> 38:20.580
 It was both beautiful, and you could feel the hurt

38:20.580 --> 38:22.960
 coming from him, too, and that was important.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.300
 The dark stuff, too.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.820
 I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,

38:26.820 --> 38:29.460
 the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze,

38:29.460 --> 38:32.300
 and talking about two bullets through his lungs,

38:32.300 --> 38:36.620
 bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers

38:36.620 --> 38:37.980
 in the hide of a cow,

38:37.980 --> 38:40.320
 a mother's grandfather just 24,

38:40.320 --> 38:43.620
 heading a charge of 300 men in Peru,

38:43.620 --> 38:46.980
 now ghosts on vanished horses.

38:46.980 --> 38:49.080
 So all of it, the whole history of it.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.900
 Since it is a love poem, what do you think about love?

38:55.100 --> 38:58.620
 Carl, what's the role of love in the human condition?

38:58.620 --> 39:00.660
 We'll talk about the dark stuff.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.940
 But maybe love is the dark stuff, too.

39:02.940 --> 39:06.980
 I mean, it's the most powerful connection we can form,

39:06.980 --> 39:11.280
 and that's what makes it so important to us.

39:11.280 --> 39:16.280
 It's the strongest and most stable connection

39:16.300 --> 39:17.700
 that we can form with another person,

39:17.700 --> 39:19.900
 and that matters immensely.

39:19.900 --> 39:24.420
 It matters for the human family to have evolved

39:24.420 --> 39:27.220
 to be something that could survive against the odds

39:27.220 --> 39:29.740
 that we've faced over the years.

39:29.740 --> 39:34.740
 That unreasonable bond that becomes reasonable

39:35.580 --> 39:37.740
 by virtue of its own existence.

39:38.580 --> 39:43.580
 And of course, that joy, the wild, raw joy of love,

39:45.060 --> 39:46.660
 is not a bad thing, either.

39:46.660 --> 39:48.540
 So you put these together,

39:48.540 --> 39:50.660
 the strongest bridge we can form,

39:51.580 --> 39:54.340
 and the reward and the joy that it brings.

39:54.340 --> 39:56.820
 That's what love is to me,

39:56.820 --> 40:01.360
 and from my perspective, this is something that,

40:02.740 --> 40:05.040
 it can be hard to capture fairly,

40:05.040 --> 40:07.220
 because you wanna talk about the positive

40:07.220 --> 40:09.100
 and the negative sides at once.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.360
 They need to be wrapped up together

40:10.360 --> 40:13.700
 for a full, honest description of what it is,

40:13.700 --> 40:16.660
 and that's hard to do in a compact form.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.380
 And so you have to take time to talk about love.

40:19.380 --> 40:23.580
 You have to take time to do it justice.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.500
 It takes a book, or at least a poem.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.420
 Or several thousands of them.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.620
 I don't know, could you pull up,

40:30.620 --> 40:33.980
 there's a video I saw, yeah, like right here.

40:33.980 --> 40:35.500
 So can you pause for a second?

40:37.380 --> 40:39.220
 So there's March of the Penguins.

40:39.220 --> 40:44.140
 So you always see penguins huddling together against,

40:44.140 --> 40:46.340
 I mean, sorry if I say just metaphors and everything,

40:46.340 --> 40:49.940
 but them huddling together against the harshness

40:50.820 --> 40:52.180
 of the conditions around them.

40:52.180 --> 40:55.680
 That's very kind of, that's like a metaphor for life,

40:55.680 --> 40:57.500
 like finding this connection.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.220
 That's kind of what love is.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.140
 It's like it allows you to forget whatever the absurdity,

41:02.140 --> 41:03.740
 whatever the suffering of life is,

41:03.740 --> 41:06.720
 together you get to like huddle for warmth.

41:06.720 --> 41:11.500
 And that's why I love sort of just the honesty

41:11.500 --> 41:13.100
 and the intensity of the way penguins,

41:13.100 --> 41:15.180
 just in the middle of like the cold do this.

41:15.180 --> 41:18.900
 And then this video I saw, a lonely,

41:18.900 --> 41:20.940
 this is misinformation.

41:20.940 --> 41:23.900
 So the name of the video is Lonely Deranged Penguin.

41:23.900 --> 41:26.060
 I don't know if he's deranged.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.740
 So if you play it.

41:27.740 --> 41:32.740
 So he left his pack and there's a nice like voiceover

41:34.540 --> 41:36.040
 and you don't need to play it,

41:36.040 --> 41:38.940
 but he for some reason left the pack

41:38.940 --> 41:41.820
 and journeyed out into the mountains.

41:41.820 --> 41:44.740
 And so the narrator says that he's deranged,

41:44.740 --> 41:46.500
 he's lost his mind.

41:46.500 --> 41:50.700
 Now I'd like to project the idea that he's actually,

41:50.700 --> 41:52.940
 there's so many stories you could think of.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.100
 He's returning to his homeland.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.740
 He's an outsider thinking,

41:56.740 --> 41:58.340
 journeying out into the unknown,

41:58.340 --> 42:00.180
 thinking he may be able to discover

42:00.180 --> 42:02.100
 something greater than the tribe.

42:02.100 --> 42:04.640
 He might be looking for a lost love.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.660
 Why is he deranged immediately?

42:06.660 --> 42:07.980
 Why has he lost his mind?

42:07.980 --> 42:10.980
 Anyway, but this, people should look up this video

42:10.980 --> 42:12.940
 because to me, I might be the only one

42:12.940 --> 42:17.940
 who romanticizes this, but it's such a nice kind of,

42:17.940 --> 42:21.820
 it's both a picture of perhaps a mental disorder,

42:21.820 --> 42:23.900
 which is what the video kind of describes.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.900
 And it may be some deeper explanation

42:25.900 --> 42:30.900
 that's not, that has to do with the motivation of a mind.

42:32.620 --> 42:35.500
 But yeah, I don't know if you have a deeper analysis

42:35.500 --> 42:36.340
 on this penguin.

42:36.340 --> 42:39.140
 Well, I, like you as a psychiatrist,

42:40.100 --> 42:43.640
 I would want to sit down with a penguin and go through,

42:44.600 --> 42:47.680
 I want to see the notes from his prior therapist.

42:47.680 --> 42:51.620
 But this actually is relevant,

42:51.620 --> 42:54.620
 not knowing what was that penguin's motivation.

42:54.620 --> 42:57.740
 We have very clear situations

42:57.740 --> 42:59.620
 where there are both within an individual,

42:59.620 --> 43:03.700
 we go through periods of time when we stay in one place

43:03.700 --> 43:06.580
 and we reap the benefits from what we've built.

43:06.580 --> 43:11.300
 And then we go through periods of foraging, of wandering.

43:11.300 --> 43:15.180
 Even if there may be resources where we are,

43:15.180 --> 43:17.700
 we have periods of time in our lives

43:17.700 --> 43:22.700
 where we wander, where we go in an exploratory mode.

43:22.700 --> 43:26.500
 And different people express that trait in different ways.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.860
 This is not a human specific trait.

43:27.860 --> 43:31.540
 If you go down to the tiny little nematode worm,

43:31.540 --> 43:34.740
 C. elegans with 302 nervous system cells,

43:34.740 --> 43:37.180
 they go through these phases of foraging and rest

43:37.180 --> 43:39.540
 and different individuals have different propensity

43:39.540 --> 43:42.900
 to forage or to rest and stay in one place.

43:42.900 --> 43:45.540
 At the level of the species, that's really good

43:45.540 --> 43:50.540
 that there's that diversity in their willingness to forage.

43:51.060 --> 43:52.980
 Some stay where they are,

43:52.980 --> 43:56.660
 the species is somewhat on a firm footing then,

43:56.660 --> 44:00.340
 but some carry a burden, a risk for themselves,

44:00.340 --> 44:03.340
 but it's good for the species that they're explorers

44:03.340 --> 44:04.640
 and they will venture out.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.180
 The migration patterns that different species blunder into

44:09.180 --> 44:10.760
 and that turned out to be really good,

44:10.760 --> 44:13.300
 they weren't logically derived.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.260
 They most certainly started

44:15.260 --> 44:18.220
 from something like this, an exploration.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.340
 And humans do this too, you think?

44:19.340 --> 44:20.460
 And we do it too.

44:20.460 --> 44:23.860
 In fact, it's something we do extremely well.

44:23.860 --> 44:25.940
 Let's talk about psychiatry a little bit.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.940
 So in my book, you're a rockstar.

44:30.940 --> 44:33.100
 First of all, for people who don't know,

44:33.100 --> 44:38.100
 aside from sort of the neurological view of the brain

44:38.320 --> 44:40.200
 and neuroscience view of the brain,

44:40.200 --> 44:43.200
 you're also one of the great psychiatrists of our time.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.780
 I've always, not always, but when I was younger,

44:45.780 --> 44:47.680
 I dreamed about being a psychiatrist.

44:49.860 --> 44:53.380
 So it's like getting to meet your heroes

44:53.380 --> 44:57.480
 and also getting to meet the people who,

44:59.020 --> 45:01.500
 the best at the top of the world

45:01.500 --> 45:03.580
 at the thing you've failed to pursue.

45:03.580 --> 45:07.220
 So I'm getting a free therapy session on top of that.

45:07.220 --> 45:11.460
 Okay, so what big picture, what is the practice,

45:11.460 --> 45:13.860
 the goal, the hope of modern psychiatry?

45:13.860 --> 45:17.380
 If you could try to describe the discipline

45:17.380 --> 45:20.700
 as you see it, maybe historically

45:20.700 --> 45:23.060
 throughout the 20th century,

45:23.060 --> 45:25.500
 in contrasting to what it is today.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.460
 Or maybe if you want to describe

45:27.460 --> 45:29.580
 to what you hope psychiatry becomes

45:29.580 --> 45:32.720
 or longs to become in the 21st century.

45:34.180 --> 45:36.340
 It's been an interesting journey.

45:36.340 --> 45:39.380
 Psychiatry started out pretty firmly grounded

45:39.380 --> 45:40.980
 in neurology and pathology.

45:40.980 --> 45:44.260
 Some of the initial founders effectively of the field

45:44.260 --> 45:48.220
 were very well grounded in microscopy, looking at cells,

45:49.580 --> 45:52.540
 working with patients, particularly on the neurological side,

45:52.540 --> 45:54.460
 and this certainly included Freud

45:54.460 --> 45:56.060
 and some of his contemporaries.

45:58.340 --> 46:03.100
 But they rapidly discovered that what they could work with

46:03.100 --> 46:05.700
 at the level of cells and microscopy

46:05.700 --> 46:09.620
 was so far from the realm of what they could get

46:09.620 --> 46:12.380
 from a human being and what they were getting

46:12.380 --> 46:14.660
 from the human being was so much more interesting

46:14.660 --> 46:17.260
 and was so mysterious and so unknown

46:17.260 --> 46:18.880
 that many of them just said,

46:18.880 --> 46:20.180
 we're gonna inhabit this domain

46:20.180 --> 46:23.220
 and we're gonna work with the people with their words

46:23.220 --> 46:27.060
 and understand what we can based on verbal communication,

46:27.060 --> 46:30.520
 because that was the only tool that people really had.

46:30.520 --> 46:35.520
 And that was a very important step for the field.

46:37.220 --> 46:39.180
 I would say one of the interesting things

46:39.180 --> 46:42.620
 that came from the early decades of psychiatry

46:42.620 --> 46:44.020
 really was this distinction

46:44.020 --> 46:47.220
 between the conscious and the unconscious mind

46:47.220 --> 46:51.440
 and paying particular attention to the unconscious mind

46:51.440 --> 46:54.020
 as something that was worthy of consideration

46:54.020 --> 46:58.620
 that might be important in explaining people's actions

46:58.620 --> 47:01.140
 and that perhaps even insight into that was valuable

47:01.140 --> 47:02.620
 in its own right.

47:02.620 --> 47:07.580
 And out of that, psychoanalysis became a practice

47:07.580 --> 47:12.580
 that was not always focused on cures or treatments,

47:12.840 --> 47:14.220
 but was more focused on insight.

47:14.220 --> 47:15.380
 What does it mean?

47:15.380 --> 47:17.340
 How can we help people understand

47:17.340 --> 47:19.900
 why they're feeling something or thinking something

47:19.900 --> 47:21.180
 or dreaming something?

47:22.260 --> 47:24.700
 And that insight separate even from treatment

47:24.700 --> 47:26.540
 was an interesting thing.

47:26.540 --> 47:28.940
 As long as one was honest about that

47:28.940 --> 47:31.160
 and said we're going for understanding,

47:31.160 --> 47:32.400
 we're going for insight.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.820
 Maybe it's useful to just pause on that.

47:34.820 --> 47:39.080
 If we look at the father of psychoanalysis, Zygmunt Freud,

47:40.780 --> 47:43.340
 what do you make of the ideas that he had?

47:43.340 --> 47:46.860
 So you mentioned taking the unconscious,

47:46.860 --> 47:49.380
 the subconscious seriously.

47:49.380 --> 47:50.900
 That's like step one,

47:50.900 --> 47:52.220
 like that there could be worlds

47:52.220 --> 47:53.900
 we do not have direct access for

47:53.900 --> 47:57.820
 and we probe at them through conversation

47:57.820 --> 48:00.900
 or is that too simplistic

48:00.900 --> 48:03.100
 to call psychoanalysis conversation?

48:03.100 --> 48:05.220
 That's not too simplistic, but that's right.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.660
 And I think that was valuable.

48:06.660 --> 48:09.040
 Where Freud ended up breaking

48:09.040 --> 48:10.300
 from some of his contemporaries,

48:10.300 --> 48:13.300
 he was very focused on this unconscious

48:13.300 --> 48:15.700
 as being so tightly linked to libido.

48:15.700 --> 48:18.860
 And really from his perspective,

48:18.860 --> 48:20.820
 you couldn't really separate the operation

48:20.820 --> 48:22.720
 of the unconscious mind from these aspects

48:22.720 --> 48:24.180
 of the libidinous aspects.

48:24.180 --> 48:25.020
 And that was one reason.

48:25.020 --> 48:25.860
 What's a libidinous aspect?

48:25.860 --> 48:29.140
 You know, sexually related drives.

48:29.140 --> 48:33.100
 Carl Jung, who was his contemporary,

48:33.100 --> 48:36.220
 that's one factor that led to them separating

48:36.220 --> 48:39.540
 was Carl Jung felt there was a lot more

48:39.540 --> 48:42.700
 to the unconscious than this libidinous aspect of it.

48:42.700 --> 48:45.820
 And he saw it as a much more complete

48:47.500 --> 48:50.900
 alternate representation of the conscious self,

48:50.900 --> 48:53.460
 one that maybe reflected a whole range

48:53.460 --> 48:58.360
 of different motivations and desires.

49:00.020 --> 49:04.780
 And to properly treat it one had to consider all of them

49:04.780 --> 49:06.420
 rather than the ones that Freud was focused on.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.340
 Carl Jung, shut your mouth.

49:08.340 --> 49:09.780
 Thank you.

49:09.780 --> 49:13.300
 Thank you for the high level of images

49:13.300 --> 49:14.340
 that Sergei's pulling up.

49:14.340 --> 49:15.500
 For people who are just listening,

49:15.500 --> 49:19.860
 he pulled up a quote from Sigmund Freud's meme,

49:19.860 --> 49:22.540
 your mom quote Freud.

49:23.380 --> 49:28.380
 So the shadow, the Carl Jung shadow encompasses everything,

49:28.780 --> 49:31.260
 not just the desire to have sex with your mother

49:31.260 --> 49:32.580
 or sex period.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.320
 That's right, that's right.

49:34.320 --> 49:38.100
 If you look at those two folks en masse,

49:38.100 --> 49:39.980
 I mean, there's a kind of,

49:39.980 --> 49:44.140
 it's almost like a technique for philosophical exploration

49:44.140 --> 49:47.320
 of human mind, human motivations.

49:47.320 --> 49:49.980
 So it's not even like necessarily,

49:49.980 --> 49:53.720
 it's also doubles as a methodology for helping people,

49:53.720 --> 49:54.980
 but it's almost like a,

49:56.420 --> 49:59.940
 it's a kind of philosophical method.

49:59.940 --> 50:03.740
 Right, this is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis.

50:03.740 --> 50:06.860
 And even though it's, I would say,

50:06.860 --> 50:10.340
 mostly not considered a treatment today,

50:10.340 --> 50:11.740
 it persists for a couple of reasons.

50:11.740 --> 50:15.820
 One is it's thought that it gives people some insight.

50:15.820 --> 50:19.940
 But second, there's been a huge influence on literature,

50:19.940 --> 50:22.060
 on philosophy, on art.

50:22.060 --> 50:24.500
 And the opening up of discussion

50:24.500 --> 50:27.580
 about what was below our conscious mind

50:27.580 --> 50:31.700
 was so fertile in the implications

50:31.700 --> 50:34.700
 that it sort of reverberated and still does

50:34.700 --> 50:37.100
 throughout all these different realms of human endeavor

50:37.100 --> 50:42.100
 from different artistic experiences that people have

50:42.100 --> 50:47.100
 that can be colored by this concept of the unconscious.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.760
 Now, the other thing that was interesting

50:51.760 --> 50:54.100
 is this distinction,

50:55.320 --> 50:57.760
 you know, what are the parts of the unconscious?

50:57.760 --> 51:00.680
 And so there were these id and ego

51:00.680 --> 51:04.040
 and superego subdivisions that,

51:05.920 --> 51:09.120
 you know, that Freud, for example, would talk about them.

51:09.120 --> 51:13.080
 And the id was the primary, the primal drives

51:13.080 --> 51:16.480
 that an infant would have or that a very young child

51:16.480 --> 51:19.840
 just warmth and feeding and then later

51:19.840 --> 51:22.520
 the sexual or libidinous aspects.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.160
 And for Freud, the later happened very quickly.

51:25.160 --> 51:29.400
 That's the controversial thing about him, I think.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.520
 I guess he thought like even children had sexual desires,

51:32.520 --> 51:35.120
 that they're like dealing with, contending with.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.360
 So it's the full thing.

51:36.360 --> 51:38.640
 Hungry, wanting to eat, wanting to poop,

51:38.640 --> 51:39.920
 wanting to have sex.

51:39.920 --> 51:43.680
 Yeah, and he was extremely focused on that aspect.

51:43.680 --> 51:46.280
 But then there was the superego,

51:46.280 --> 51:49.120
 which brought on these later sort of moralistic

51:51.080 --> 51:52.840
 sort of codes of conduct.

51:52.840 --> 51:56.200
 And that, of course, was very often in tension,

51:56.200 --> 51:58.560
 but all this could play out subconsciously.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.800
 And then the ego, this third aspect was mediating,

52:01.800 --> 52:04.680
 and Freud's conception mediated this tension

52:04.680 --> 52:06.300
 between the different parts.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.500
 Now, I think that's interesting.

52:08.500 --> 52:13.500
 I will say that in some ways, it's maybe unnecessary

52:14.380 --> 52:16.260
 from the perspective of modern neuroscience

52:16.260 --> 52:21.260
 to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives

52:23.100 --> 52:27.300
 and the primal gratification drives.

52:27.300 --> 52:29.260
 In some ways, they're all drives,

52:29.260 --> 52:31.660
 and maybe they're even all primal drives.

52:31.660 --> 52:34.540
 The moralistic drives, they're taught,

52:34.540 --> 52:37.900
 and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate

52:37.900 --> 52:42.340
 back to survival, and you could even say,

52:42.340 --> 52:46.260
 selfish aspects of health and life

52:46.260 --> 52:47.540
 for the self and family.

52:47.540 --> 52:52.540
 And so this is, I think it's maybe an artificial distinction.

52:53.500 --> 52:56.300
 The concept of the unconscious is very valuable

52:56.300 --> 52:59.820
 and very interesting, but these categorizations

52:59.820 --> 53:04.820
 of id and superego may not map onto neurobiology

53:05.900 --> 53:07.300
 in any particular way.

53:07.300 --> 53:10.540
 If there's a town hall of competing drives and desires,

53:10.540 --> 53:13.700
 and they interrelate to each other,

53:13.700 --> 53:16.060
 they involve different aspects of the brain

53:16.060 --> 53:18.740
 and the history of the person,

53:18.740 --> 53:22.140
 and actions and choices come out of the result

53:22.140 --> 53:25.420
 of that overall shouting in the town hall.

53:25.420 --> 53:27.940
 So in some sense, Carl Jung was a step into the direction

53:27.940 --> 53:32.300
 of liberating yourself from such harsh categorizations.

53:32.300 --> 53:35.260
 Do you think, I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman

53:35.260 --> 53:37.420
 with System One and System Two.

53:37.420 --> 53:40.500
 There's just these very compelling categorizations

53:40.500 --> 53:44.180
 of the human mind that seem to be sticky

53:46.940 --> 53:51.300
 in the superego, no, in how we talk about these ideas

53:51.300 --> 53:52.740
 and so on.

53:52.740 --> 53:55.500
 Do you think those are helpful or do they get in the way?

53:55.500 --> 53:57.900
 Is it some kind of balance in terms of deeper understanding

53:57.900 --> 53:59.380
 of how the mind actually works?

53:59.380 --> 54:01.700
 You know, it's from modern neuroscience,

54:02.940 --> 54:07.940
 whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question

54:08.220 --> 54:10.020
 like this at the level of cells,

54:10.900 --> 54:12.340
 it seems to get farther away.

54:12.340 --> 54:14.780
 And I'll give you an example of what I mean by that.

54:14.780 --> 54:16.820
 So one thing I'm doing in my laboratory

54:16.820 --> 54:20.740
 and many people are doing is we are listening in

54:20.740 --> 54:24.420
 on the activity of cells, neurons in the brain

54:24.420 --> 54:27.700
 of mice or rats or fish or monkeys.

54:27.700 --> 54:28.540
 Individual cells.

54:28.540 --> 54:29.940
 Individual cells, exactly.

54:29.940 --> 54:33.220
 Of which there are, in our brain, many billions.

54:33.220 --> 54:37.260
 And when we do and we try to predict

54:37.260 --> 54:39.300
 what action will be taken by an animal

54:40.500 --> 54:43.660
 to address this question, where does the choice arise?

54:43.660 --> 54:47.060
 Where does the impetus to make a particular selection

54:47.060 --> 54:48.780
 of one action versus another action,

54:48.780 --> 54:50.060
 where does that start in the brain?

54:50.060 --> 54:52.940
 If you're recording, listening in on the activity of cells

54:52.940 --> 54:56.660
 all across the brain, where's the earliest spot

54:56.660 --> 55:00.620
 you can pick up a choice being made?

55:00.620 --> 55:01.460
 Well?

55:01.460 --> 55:02.300
 That's so awesome.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.180
 Yeah, at one level, you might think,

55:04.180 --> 55:07.340
 how excited would Jung have been to see this

55:07.340 --> 55:10.340
 or Freud or the early psychoanalyst

55:10.340 --> 55:11.620
 to see where this starts.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.820
 But it's not so simple because an emerging theme

55:15.820 --> 55:17.140
 in very recent neuroscience,

55:17.140 --> 55:19.620
 literally over the last few years,

55:19.620 --> 55:23.220
 is that things sort of all start together

55:23.220 --> 55:24.380
 all across the brain.

55:24.380 --> 55:27.060
 And so you can be recording from the cortex,

55:27.060 --> 55:29.900
 this rim of cells at the surface of the brain,

55:29.900 --> 55:31.860
 or you can be recording deeper

55:31.860 --> 55:33.220
 in a structure called the striatum,

55:33.220 --> 55:34.940
 which is a little older.

55:34.940 --> 55:38.380
 It's more tightly linked to action.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.300
 And then structures called the thalamus,

55:40.300 --> 55:41.660
 other parts of the brain.

55:41.660 --> 55:43.020
 And if you record from these,

55:43.020 --> 55:48.020
 these all sort of represent the action and the choice

55:48.820 --> 55:51.300
 more or less all at about the same time, very close.

55:51.300 --> 55:56.020
 And so you can't point to a particular spot and say,

55:56.020 --> 55:59.180
 here's where the choice or the action originates.

55:59.180 --> 56:00.620
 It's a group.

56:00.620 --> 56:02.620
 Finding the free will neuron.

56:03.820 --> 56:05.140
 It's relevant to that question.

56:05.140 --> 56:08.100
 Nobody is close to being able to point to such a thing.

56:08.100 --> 56:11.820
 Well, close is a relative term.

56:11.820 --> 56:16.180
 And nobody, what I tweet today,

56:16.180 --> 56:17.860
 all generalizations are wrong.

56:19.820 --> 56:21.180
 So including this one.

56:21.180 --> 56:22.260
 Let's actually talk about that.

56:22.260 --> 56:25.300
 So the study of individual cells.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.900
 If you could linger on your sense

56:27.900 --> 56:30.460
 that as you get closer to that understanding,

56:30.460 --> 56:33.100
 it feels like you're getting farther away.

56:33.100 --> 56:34.020
 Why is that?

56:34.020 --> 56:36.020
 Because that often is the feeling

56:36.020 --> 56:37.560
 until you're actually there.

56:38.460 --> 56:42.860
 So like, you know, see that's when I'm running

56:42.860 --> 56:44.940
 and I know there's only a mile left,

56:44.940 --> 56:46.940
 it just feels like that mile

56:46.940 --> 56:49.020
 is just getting longer and longer,

56:49.020 --> 56:50.140
 but eventually you finish.

56:50.140 --> 56:51.820
 So maybe we're getting close

56:51.820 --> 56:54.540
 to cracking open these beginnings of a sense,

56:54.540 --> 56:56.180
 like we'll talk about consciousness

56:56.180 --> 56:59.580
 or these very difficult, big questions

56:59.580 --> 57:00.900
 about the human mind.

57:00.900 --> 57:02.380
 Where do they start?

57:02.380 --> 57:04.700
 You're right to say we shouldn't generalize

57:04.700 --> 57:06.420
 or make absolutist statements,

57:06.420 --> 57:09.180
 but I would say right now,

57:09.180 --> 57:12.900
 the reason things are looking even harder to crack

57:12.900 --> 57:14.740
 than we had initially thought,

57:14.740 --> 57:16.460
 we now have the data streams

57:16.460 --> 57:18.220
 that we've wanted for so long

57:18.220 --> 57:22.260
 in terms of activity patterns all across the brain

57:22.260 --> 57:23.260
 at the level of cells.

57:23.260 --> 57:26.660
 We can literally see what the cells are doing.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.820
 Immense data sets.

57:27.820 --> 57:30.780
 You know, we get, these are time series

57:30.780 --> 57:34.080
 of one individual cell with sub second resolution

57:34.080 --> 57:36.740
 and you can collect this from enormous numbers of cells

57:36.740 --> 57:38.080
 across the brain.

57:38.080 --> 57:40.860
 So very rich data sets that we've wanted for a long time

57:40.860 --> 57:44.580
 and yet having these has not led

57:44.580 --> 57:48.140
 to an understanding of truly where actions

57:48.140 --> 57:51.980
 initiate in terms of regions or locations.

57:51.980 --> 57:54.180
 And let's get a few questions on that.

57:54.180 --> 57:59.180
 Is the answer, high level question by your intuition,

57:59.660 --> 58:01.660
 is the answer within the data?

58:01.660 --> 58:04.620
 Or do we need different kind of data?

58:04.620 --> 58:07.900
 So we should also say that when you collect data

58:07.900 --> 58:10.700
 about the brain, there's like the richness

58:10.700 --> 58:12.620
 of information you're collecting,

58:12.620 --> 58:14.760
 but there's also human doing stuff.

58:14.760 --> 58:19.760
 And information, so static information about the human

58:20.960 --> 58:23.480
 and dynamic information about the human

58:23.480 --> 58:25.300
 and you can get them to do different stuff

58:25.300 --> 58:27.400
 and you can select different humans

58:27.400 --> 58:30.680
 and that's part of the collection of data aspect.

58:30.680 --> 58:33.420
 So like when you're collecting data about the brain,

58:33.420 --> 58:36.360
 there's some truths that you can,

58:36.360 --> 58:38.200
 you know, in machine learning is like annotations,

58:38.200 --> 58:39.680
 like supervised learning.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.080
 There's some true things you can hold on to

58:42.080 --> 58:46.040
 before you look at the full rich mess complexity

58:46.040 --> 58:47.600
 of the human mind.

58:47.600 --> 58:50.040
 So given the data you've looked at,

58:50.040 --> 58:54.040
 do you think the answer for the origin of free will

58:54.040 --> 58:56.640
 in the human mind can be found?

58:58.120 --> 59:03.120
 Well, one amazing thing is that nobody's found it,

59:04.340 --> 59:05.860
 but we have these rich data sets

59:05.860 --> 59:08.880
 and then there's a conundrum which is,

59:09.800 --> 59:11.520
 is it in the data and we just don't know

59:11.520 --> 59:12.360
 how to look at it.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.760
 Maybe we don't know the right scale,

59:13.760 --> 59:15.800
 the right projection to make of the data,

59:15.800 --> 59:17.760
 the right way to interpret it.

59:17.760 --> 59:21.280
 And here's where causal testing becomes very valuable

59:21.280 --> 59:23.820
 because then instead of just passively observing,

59:25.200 --> 59:28.380
 well, here are the activity patterns

59:28.380 --> 59:30.680
 and then here's the choice made by the animal.

59:32.240 --> 59:36.040
 As we've gotten more powerful at reaching in

59:36.040 --> 59:38.000
 and causing things to happen in the brain,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.680
 turning up or down the activity

59:40.680 --> 59:44.440
 of certain types of cells or defined populations of cells

59:44.440 --> 59:46.400
 and seeing how that affects actions,

59:46.400 --> 59:48.920
 these causal perturbations have turned out

59:48.920 --> 59:50.480
 to be very valuable.

59:50.480 --> 59:52.240
 We're just now getting to the point

59:52.240 --> 59:57.240
 where we can apply these in very wide swaths of the brain

59:58.440 --> 1:00:01.480
 at cellular resolution and so we're gonna be able,

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.280
 hopefully to make some headway on this question

1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:07.320
 with causality and that's the one thing

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:10.120
 that optogenetics provides us this way of using light

1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:12.160
 that we develop to control cells.

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:15.440
 This is an untapped, relatively untapped

1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:17.160
 at this broad brain wide scale

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:18.880
 and hopefully we can get there in the near future.

1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:22.640
 But I would say that the answer may be in the data

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:24.360
 but we don't know how to find it.

1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.000
 Well, there's this interactive element

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.720
 like where you can cause stuff that's really powerful

1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:30.560
 because you get to, I mean,

1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:33.480
 as opposed to collecting data passively,

1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:35.240
 you get your collecting data actively.

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:38.400
 So can you maybe describe one of the many things

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:40.960
 you're known for, one of the big things

1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:43.560
 is called optogenetics, what is it?

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:46.160
 Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen.

1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:50.240
 It's a way of determining what actually matters

1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:52.200
 in terms of the activity of the brain

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:55.040
 for the amazing things it does,

1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.440
 sensation, cognition, action.

1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:01.720
 And what it does is it provides activity.

1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:04.320
 It's a way of playing in, if you will,

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.560
 activity patterns into precisely defined cells.

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:09.600
 And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think.

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:12.260
 It's, you know, right away there's a problem

1:01:12.260 --> 1:01:13.360
 if you think about how do we do this?

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:16.360
 How could we play in well defined activity patterns

1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:20.080
 and provide a stream of activity into this cell

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:22.680
 and that cell and that cell but not these other cells?

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.920
 So just for context, we're talking about the brains

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:30.920
 of mice, monkeys, humans,

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:35.880
 and then the goal is to try to control accurately

1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:38.280
 the behavior of a single neuron

1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:42.760
 and then to be able to monitor single collection

1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:45.840
 of single neurons to then say, well,

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:50.600
 to draw some deeper insight about the origins,

1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.280
 first of all, the function of different parts of the brain,

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.960
 different neurons, different kinds of neurons,

1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:57.400
 but also the origins of the big things,

1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:00.080
 the flap of the butterfly wing that leads

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:03.480
 to an actual behavioral thing.

1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.000
 Yeah, so if you could, exactly, so if you could turn on

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.560
 or off the brain or parts of the brain or cell types

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:15.560
 or individual cells at the natural rate and rhythm

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:18.880
 and timing of normal brain activity,

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:19.840
 that would be immensely valuable

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:21.800
 because you could determine what actually mattered,

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.880
 what could cause complex things to happen

1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:26.000
 and what could prevent complex things from happening

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.720
 in a specific way.

1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:29.880
 But right away, you've got a problem if you wanna do this

1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:33.280
 and scientists, neuroscientists have wanted to do this

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:34.240
 for a long time.

1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:37.240
 Francis Crick of Double Helix of DNA fame,

1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:40.560
 he wrote a famous paper in 1999.

1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:43.080
 He got interested in neuroscience later in life

1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:47.680
 and he said, what we need in neuroscience is a way

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:50.560
 that we could turn on or off the activity

1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:55.440
 of individual types of neurons in a behaving animal.

1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:00.200
 And he even said the ideal signal would be light

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:04.560
 because it would be fast, it could penetrate

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:06.740
 through the brain to some extent.

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.800
 And he had no idea how to do it.

1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:13.640
 He said this would probably be very farfetched,

1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:15.480
 but it would be a good thing.

1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:17.120
 And so that's what you're actually saying,

1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:19.280
 like if you wanna do this kind of thing

1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:22.800
 and you imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:24.560
 It's pretty difficult.

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:26.640
 It's pretty difficult and then even once you get in,

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:29.160
 it's hard because all brain cells are electrical,

1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:31.440
 all neurons are electrically activated.

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:33.880
 And so if you wanted to use electricity

1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:37.300
 as what you were putting in,

1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:39.480
 you won't have any specificity at all.

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.360
 If you have an electrode, a wire,

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.360
 and you put it in the brain and you send current through it,

1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:48.280
 all the cells near the electrode will be stimulated.

1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:50.160
 That's like trying to control fish

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.680
 by spraying them with water.

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:56.280
 Yeah, right, because there's already a lot of electricity

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:58.240
 going around anyway and you're adding more,

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:00.800
 but there's no specificity

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.560
 even among the different kinds of cells either

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:05.040
 because all around the wire that you've put in,

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:06.820
 there are gonna be so many different cells

1:04:06.820 --> 1:04:08.520
 doing totally different things,

1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.520
 many of them in opposition to each other.

1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:12.260
 We know that's one way the brain is set up.

1:04:12.260 --> 1:04:14.240
 There are parts of the brain

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.000
 where neurons side by side

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.360
 are doing completely different things

1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.240
 and maybe even antagonistic to each other.

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:21.080
 So what do you do?

1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.700
 How do you play in activity with any kind of specificity?

1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:26.440
 Well, what you do is use,

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.840
 what we found is what you can do is

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:33.200
 make some cells responsive to light.

1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:36.700
 Now, normally no cells deep in the brain

1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:37.640
 really respond to light.

1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.120
 They're not built for that.

1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:42.360
 There's no reason for them to respond to light in there,

1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:45.240
 which is a great situation to start with

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:48.960
 because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:51.560
 will be a huge signal above the noise.

1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:53.520
 And so that's what we do with optogenetics.

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:58.520
 We take genes, bits of DNA from microbes,

1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:00.800
 single celled organisms,

1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:05.080
 and these single celled organisms like algae,

1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:09.360
 they make little proteins

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.960
 that sit in the surface of their cells

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:15.240
 that receive light, capture a photon of light

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:18.400
 and open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell

1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:21.840
 and let charged particles, ions like sodium and potassium

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:24.440
 flow across the membrane of the cell.

1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:27.440
 And that, these algae and bacteria,

1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:28.760
 they do this for their own reasons

1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:30.280
 because that helps them move,

1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:32.900
 it helps them make and use energy.

1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:36.560
 But that's a beautiful thing for neuroscience

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.400
 because movement of ions,

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:40.680
 charged particles across the membrane of the cell

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:43.960
 is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work with.

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:47.240
 So if we can take this bit of DNA

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.780
 that encodes this beautiful protein

1:05:48.780 --> 1:05:51.440
 that turns light into electricity from algae,

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:54.600
 and if we can put it into some neurons,

1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:58.200
 but not other neurons, which we can do using genetic tricks,

1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.440
 then you've got a situation,

1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:01.240
 then you can shine on the light

1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:03.920
 and only the cells that have the gene

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:05.760
 and that are expressing the gene

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:08.160
 will be the initial direct cells

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.200
 that are activated by the light.

1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:10.880
 And so that's the essence of optogenetics

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.600
 is the ability to do that.

1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.100
 We get that initial specificity

1:06:14.100 --> 1:06:15.840
 that you could never get with an electrode.

1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:18.240
 So let me say that this is,

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:22.560
 we recently got the Alaska Prize for this.

1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:24.240
 It's a brilliant idea.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:28.880
 So I talked to Andrew Huberman,

1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:31.060
 who's a friend of yours, friend of mine,

1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:33.520
 so not to jinx things,

1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:36.720
 but he believes that you deserve the Nobel Prize for this.

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:41.720
 So, I do too, but what, my votes.

1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.680
 Anyway, the thing is, it doesn't matter.

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:47.440
 Prizes will be all forgotten, all of us will be forgotten.

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:49.880
 When the cool idea is a cool idea,

1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.600
 that's a really powerful idea.

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.760
 It's actually, the origins of it

1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:57.580
 you might be interested in are even, are very deep.

1:06:57.580 --> 1:06:59.820
 There was a botanist in St. Petersburg

1:06:59.820 --> 1:07:01.520
 named Andre Fomensen.

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:05.600
 In 1866, he published a paper

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:07.840
 on the single celled green algae.

1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:09.960
 And he was the botanist who first noticed

1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:12.060
 that they moved in response to light.

1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:14.500
 These are tiny single celled algae that have flagella,

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.440
 so they swim through the water.

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:20.080
 And he noticed this, he was a botanist,

1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:21.520
 and he published this.

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:26.100
 It was a paper, you know, he wrote in German,

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:27.720
 but he published it in a French journal,

1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:29.640
 and he was doing it from St. Petersburg,

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:32.400
 so it was a very international effort.

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:34.120
 But you have to go back to 1866,

1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:37.080
 and that, I like to highlight how far back

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:40.840
 that discovery goes is back to Andre Fomensen.

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:44.040
 And this is a, it highlights the value

1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:45.720
 of just pure basic science discovery.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.380
 That always originates somewhere

1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:50.520
 in the Eastern European block.

1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:53.600
 But I don't think he expected the splicing

1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:57.920
 of genetic material from the algae into the human brain.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:07:59.440
 And one of the cool things we've been able to do now

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:02.040
 with modern methods is to really study these proteins.

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:04.280
 And so we've discovered some of these proteins,

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:05.480
 other groups have as well.

1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:07.640
 We've dived deep into their structure,

1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:09.920
 just like the double helix structure of DNA

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:12.560
 was uncovered with X ray crystallography.

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.840
 We used the same method in X ray crystallography

1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:18.080
 to see how these beautiful little proteins work.

1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:20.080
 We reengineered them for all kinds of function.

1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:22.360
 We can make them, instead of responding to blue light,

1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:24.520
 we can make them respond to red light.

1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:26.400
 We can speed them up, slow them down.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.920
 We can make them, with genetic engineering,

1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:32.320
 we can make them have different ions flow through them.

1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:34.720
 And so it's this convergence, as you said,

1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:36.920
 like the botanist in 1866 couldn't have predicted

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:38.440
 what we could do with this.

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:40.680
 And the fact that we've been able to discover

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:42.240
 how these beautiful proteins work

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.040
 and then apply them to neuroscience

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:46.280
 is really a thrilling story.

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:49.440
 Is it possible to achieve scale, do you think, with this?

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:53.760
 Meaning, like what is the progress of the next 50 years,

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.840
 100 years looks like in terms of the precision

1:08:56.840 --> 1:08:59.120
 and the scale of control of using light?

1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:02.320
 It's going so fast it's hard to predict.

1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:03.920
 I'll give you a sense of it though.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:11.120
 First paper we published in 2005,

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:12.400
 that was just encultured neurons.

1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:14.520
 By 2007, so that was in a dish.

1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:17.520
 By 2007, we had it working in behaving mice.

1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:20.800
 By 2009, we had it pretty general.

1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:23.320
 So we had methods to really make it a versatile method.

1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:26.280
 It could be applied to essentially any cell.

1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:29.240
 By 2012, we could get to single cell resolution.

1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:31.080
 We used light guidance strategies

1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:36.520
 to target individual cells in the brain of a living mouse.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:42.840
 By 2019, we were able to control up to 20 to 50

1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:44.840
 individually specified single cells

1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:48.600
 in the brain of a mouse in ways that specifically changed

1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:50.920
 its behavior, that could bias its decisions one

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:51.680
 way or the other.

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:58.600
 In fact, we could take a mouse and without any visual stimulus

1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:01.160
 at all, we could make it act as if it

1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:03.440
 had seen a particular visual stimulus

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:07.640
 by playing in, using the single cell resolution optogenetics,

1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:11.040
 a specific pattern of activity into 20 or 25

1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:12.960
 individually specified cells.

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.400
 That's 2019 to your question of scale.

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:18.200
 Now in 2022, we're controlling hundreds

1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.840
 of individually specified single cells

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:24.560
 over all of visual cortex of a mouse, all the part

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:28.800
 of the brain that is the initial direct target

1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:31.160
 of the incoming information from the retina.

1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:34.320
 Are you constrained to specific types of cells currently?

1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:36.800
 Like you mentioned, long range is easier.

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:39.680
 Is there constraints on which cells?

1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:41.040
 Now there really isn't.

1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:43.600
 Now that we have this individual cell guidance,

1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.840
 we can target any individual kind of cell very reliably.

1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:55.520
 And so now to your question of scale, how far can we go?

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:58.680
 Well, things are moving quickly.

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:00.000
 It's hard to say.

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.560
 We can access individual cells across the entire brain now.

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:09.080
 If you look 10, 20 years in the future,

1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:11.880
 I think we'll surprise ourselves.

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:14.520
 But the fact that we're already able to cause

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:17.600
 specific perceptions to happen and specific actions

1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:19.480
 means we're essentially where we want to be.

1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:25.960
 And now it's a matter of just more experiments,

1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:26.800
 more discoveries.

1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:29.960
 But the basic principles are clear now.

1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:32.200
 The basic capability is there.

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:36.320
 Is there a pathway to doing the same for humans?

1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:38.400
 Optogenetics is primarily, it's a discovery tool

1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:41.760
 that really is well suited for use in mice and rats

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:48.120
 and monkeys because it involves putting in a gene

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:49.720
 and also delivering light.

1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:52.600
 And those are two things that you can do in human beings,

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:55.760
 but you'd want to do in a very careful way.

1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:59.280
 Now that said, there is actually just less than a year ago,

1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:02.480
 my friend Botan Droska in Switzerland,

1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:07.760
 he did the first human optogenetics therapy.

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:10.000
 And he published this in the journal Nature Medicine.

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.760
 So about 10, 12 years ago, he and I

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:17.240
 published a paper together where we gave him

1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.000
 one of our optogenetic tools, one

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:26.000
 of these light activated regulators of ion flow.

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.840
 These are called microbial opsins, by the way, opsins.

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:33.120
 And he put one of those into an extracted retina

1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:35.760
 from a human being who had died.

1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.800
 So it was a cadaveric retina.

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.000
 And he was able to show that optical control in this paper

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.360
 was able to turn on or off individual cells

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:46.440
 in the human retina.

1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:48.480
 So that was a while back.

1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:53.200
 He spent about 10 years of going through all the regulatory

1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:56.480
 hoops and hurdles and going through primate studies.

1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:00.560
 And finally, he was able to take a human being

1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:03.280
 with a retinal degeneration syndrome, so someone

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:06.480
 who was blind in both eyes.

1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:12.320
 And he gave one of these opsins into one eye of this human

1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:16.720
 being who was blind and with the goal

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.760
 of conferring light sensitivity onto this retina that

1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:23.440
 was not able to see light.

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:26.440
 And he was able to make this person see through that eye.

1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:27.640
 So he took a blind person.

1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.080
 And the blind person could see now,

1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.760
 could reach for objects selectively on a table.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:36.400
 And he published this in Nature Medicine.

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:39.600
 And it was, you know, that's an amazing thing.

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:40.480
 Do you know the title of the paper?

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:41.480
 What's his name again?

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:43.840
 Rosca, R O S K A.

1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:45.680
 And you look up the Nature paper.

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:46.760
 Nature Medicine.

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:47.680
 Nature Medicine.

1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:49.360
 So that's sort of proof of principle.

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.200
 Now, the retina is very accessible.

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:52.640
 It's near the surface.

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.280
 You can use natural light, or you

1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:57.800
 can use brighter natural light.

1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:01.960
 I'm myself, I see optogenetics as a discovery tool.

1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:04.520
 It's a way to figure out the principles by which the brain

1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:05.720
 works and how it operates.

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:07.560
 Partial recovery of visual function

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:10.120
 in a blind patient after optogenetic therapy.

1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:14.360
 So he went through the full process of doing primates

1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:17.200
 and then going, wow, that's dedication

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.320
 and that's really exciting to see.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:23.920
 As beautiful as that is, and I'm glad he did all that work,

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:27.240
 there are so many other ways that optogenetics

1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:28.520
 could help with therapies.

1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:31.760
 Once you know the principles, then any kind of therapy

1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:32.840
 can become more powerful.

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:36.720
 Once you know the causal cells in a symptom,

1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:40.120
 like in lack of motivation or inability

1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:43.960
 to enjoy things or altered sleep or altered energy,

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:46.080
 once you know the cells that are causal,

1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:49.640
 then you can make medications that address those cells.

1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:52.360
 You could address brain stimulation treatments that

1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:53.440
 might address those cells.

1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:58.720
 Also, diagnosis, very effective systematic way of diagnosing,

1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:01.360
 or at least providing you rich data

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.680
 to some of these deep questions about schizophrenia,

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:08.800
 about bipolar, all of those kinds of things.

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:11.720
 The tools are low resolution currently

1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:15.320
 for determining the degree to which you have a thing

1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.920
 and whether you have a thing at all.

1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:18.840
 Yeah, exactly.

1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:23.040
 And so the hope is that's a great example

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:27.640
 of how you can cure or you can provide

1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:30.120
 some relief for a symptom of a person who has

1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.120
 a serious degenerative disease.

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:36.200
 But the principles are what we're after,

1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:39.520
 and that's why I spend, even though I'm a psychiatrist,

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:42.480
 even though I still see patients, I'm not myself

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:45.480
 trying to drive any clinical trials in the lab.

1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.400
 I'm trying to discover, and then any kind of therapy

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:50.880
 could result from that.

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:54.960
 What do you think about my friend,

1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:58.360
 Elon Musk, and his efforts with Neuralink?

1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:02.840
 So this is another, there's a lot of things to say here,

1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:05.360
 because there's a lot of ideas under the umbrella

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:09.760
 of Neuralink, but one of them is to use electrical signals

1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:13.280
 to stimulate, and then you also record,

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.840
 you collect electrical signals from the brain

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:17.920
 at a higher and higher resolution,

1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:22.920
 and you go implant surgically the methods

1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:26.440
 by which you do the stimulation and the data collection.

1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:30.520
 So it's possible for the ideas of optogenetics

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:34.080
 to play well with this, and we can even zoom out

1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:36.960
 outside of just Neuralink, and just the whole idea

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:39.520
 of brain computer interfaces.

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.760
 What are your thoughts?

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:43.600
 Well, I think the engineering that they've done

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:44.480
 is actually pretty cool.

1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:46.120
 So I like the.

1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:47.000
 Robots.

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.480
 Yeah, from the design perspective,

1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:53.240
 and it was a design approach that wasn't being taken

1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:55.760
 in academia, and it's great that they did it,

1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.400
 and I think it's pretty cool.

1:16:57.400 --> 1:16:59.000
 So I'll say that.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.560
 Also, there are many ways that you can record

1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:06.320
 from many thousands of neurons, and that's not the only way.

1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:08.000
 It's a very interesting way.

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.400
 We and others are using brain penetrating electrodes

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:14.200
 that actually get quite deep.

1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:16.440
 This whole structure of the brain is very interesting.

1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:20.440
 There's the surface cortex, where it's the most recently

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:23.680
 emergent part of the brain in evolution.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:24.800
 Mammals have it.

1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:27.000
 Reptiles have something a little bit like it,

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.880
 but it's not really the full thing.

1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:31.040
 This is a very recent thing.

1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:33.600
 That's what we can access with some of these,

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:35.080
 like the Neuralink approach,

1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:38.280
 and with some of these short electrodes.

1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:39.480
 This part of the brain, the cortex,

1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:40.680
 is only a few millimeters thick.

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:42.880
 There's so much that's deep, though, that's so important.

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:44.680
 There's the striatum, there's the thalamus.

1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:49.120
 There are the parts of the brain that drive motivation,

1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:52.960
 that drive hunger and thirst and social interaction

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:57.960
 and parenting and flight and fear and anxiety.

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:00.440
 All these things are, there's so much that's deep

1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:02.800
 that these surface approaches are not getting to.

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:06.600
 And so we and others are using these very long electrodes

1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:08.800
 that help us get deep, and we can still record

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:11.600
 for many cells, many thousands of cells.

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:15.360
 We can have multiple of these at once in the same animal.

1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:18.440
 And so there's a diversity of methods to get to this goal.

1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:21.240
 I think it's great that people coming from

1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:26.760
 outside academia will bring ideas

1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:29.040
 that weren't being worked on, at least approaches.

1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:31.160
 They may turn out to be synergistic.

1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:33.600
 These things do work very well with optogenetics

1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:37.400
 because all these electrical recording methods,

1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:39.640
 that's one channel of information flow.

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:43.200
 Light delivery is a separate, more or less independent.

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:45.360
 There can be some artifacts that happen,

1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:46.200
 but if you're careful,

1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.840
 it's another independent pathway of information flow.

1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:53.160
 And we've done really fun experiments in mice

1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:56.240
 where we play in patterns of activity with light,

1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:59.480
 and we record activity from across the brain of a mouse

1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:02.320
 electrically, and so using optical and electrical together

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:04.000
 is extremely powerful.

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:08.260
 So like optoelectric brain computer interfaces.

1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:13.080
 Which, by the way, there's efforts on the computing side

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:16.200
 to build optoelectric servers,

1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.920
 so like where you have both electricity.

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.160
 So because optics is really interesting,

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:22.880
 light is a very interesting method of communication

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:26.220
 that's, like you said, orthogonal in many ways.

1:19:26.220 --> 1:19:28.920
 It doesn't have some of the constraints of bandwidth

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:32.400
 that electricity does going through wires,

1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:34.320
 but you're able to,

1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:38.640
 but less ability to control precisely at scale.

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.680
 So like there's challenges and there's benefits,

1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:42.200
 and having those two interplays

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.040
 really, really, really fascinating,

1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:46.640
 especially when obviously on the other side

1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.640
 of your signal is a biological mesh, mush, mushy mesh.

1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:54.660
 Well, the mushy mesh is kind of interesting

1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:56.460
 because there are problems with light.

1:19:56.460 --> 1:19:57.980
 Light scatters in the brain,

1:19:57.980 --> 1:20:01.420
 so the photons don't just go linearly through.

1:20:01.420 --> 1:20:04.220
 Whenever they hit an interface between fat and water,

1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:08.060
 lipid and water, they bounce off in different directions.

1:20:08.060 --> 1:20:10.820
 And so you can come in with all the resolution you want.

1:20:10.820 --> 1:20:13.540
 You could play in an incredibly detailed,

1:20:13.540 --> 1:20:15.460
 high resolution pattern of light,

1:20:15.460 --> 1:20:18.300
 but the photons start scattering quite quickly,

1:20:18.300 --> 1:20:20.980
 and by the time you've gone a couple of millimeters deep,

1:20:20.980 --> 1:20:24.580
 you've lost almost all that fine spatial information.

1:20:24.580 --> 1:20:26.980
 So, but we've developed workarounds.

1:20:26.980 --> 1:20:29.140
 The longer wavelength light you use,

1:20:29.140 --> 1:20:31.140
 if you get into the infrared, there's less scattering.

1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:33.900
 You can use two photon methods or three photon methods

1:20:33.900 --> 1:20:36.100
 where the photons have to arrive all together

1:20:36.100 --> 1:20:37.620
 at the same time.

1:20:37.620 --> 1:20:39.220
 You can put in fiber optics.

1:20:39.220 --> 1:20:42.420
 We developed these fiber optic methods in 2007

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:44.220
 where you can access these deep structures

1:20:44.220 --> 1:20:45.460
 with fiber optic methods,

1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:46.980
 and you can put many of these fiber optics

1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:48.860
 at the same time in an animal.

1:20:48.860 --> 1:20:53.300
 We've used holographic methods, 3D holograms,

1:20:53.300 --> 1:20:56.900
 to play in hundreds of individual cell size spots of light,

1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:59.220
 and we can change those quickly.

1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:00.340
 So there are a lot of tricks,

1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:01.860
 a lot of interesting optics engineering

1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:03.860
 that has come together with neuroscience

1:21:03.860 --> 1:21:04.820
 in a pretty exciting way.

1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:06.060
 Well, that is engineering, too.

1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:07.660
 It was just super, super, super exciting.

1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:10.820
 I should mention, because I remember I mentioned Elon.

1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:15.740
 I recently got, for the first time ever, got COVID.

1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:20.740
 Well, how did I go so long without,

1:21:21.300 --> 1:21:24.340
 finally, so I'm all vaccinated and everything like that.

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:27.900
 And so I got, because I think he mentioned it publicly

1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:28.980
 so I can mention it,

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:30.620
 but I won't mention anybody else involved.

1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:33.780
 But hanging out, we all got, Elon got COVID.

1:21:33.780 --> 1:21:35.180
 And the interesting thing about,

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:36.540
 maybe you can comment about this.

1:21:36.540 --> 1:21:38.860
 So I was only sick for like a half a day.

1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:40.540
 I got a fever of like 104.

1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:44.020
 I just went up and then crashed.

1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:47.580
 And then I was, now maybe I'm just seeing

1:21:47.580 --> 1:21:48.700
 the silver lining of everything,

1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:53.700
 but afterwards, I have like a greater clarity

1:21:54.740 --> 1:21:55.580
 about the world.

1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.740
 You just think it's greater clarity.

1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:01.980
 Maybe, maybe I just, it was so,

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:06.140
 maybe so intensely the mind fog kind of thing

1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:07.860
 for such a short amount of time.

1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:12.060
 But the people who were involved were also reporting this.

1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:13.180
 It's kind of interesting.

1:22:13.180 --> 1:22:17.580
 It's like, because I do know like the immune system

1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:21.860
 is involved with the brain in very interesting ways.

1:22:21.860 --> 1:22:24.780
 So like the human mind also incorporates all these other,

1:22:24.780 --> 1:22:28.140
 it's not just the, it's not just the nervous system.

1:22:28.140 --> 1:22:30.220
 And I just wonder, because everyone always says,

1:22:30.220 --> 1:22:32.540
 no, not like, everyone always says like COVID

1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:34.740
 does all these bad things or whatever the disease is

1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:36.060
 or whatever the virus.

1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:39.740
 But I wonder like, I hate to be a Steven Pinker on this,

1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:42.180
 but like, I wonder what the benefits of certain disease are

1:22:42.180 --> 1:22:43.860
 if you're able to recover.

1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:46.460
 Like what, is there some like, again,

1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:47.540
 don't want to romanticize it,

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:50.180
 but if your system goes to some kind of hardship

1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:51.900
 and you come out on the other end,

1:22:51.900 --> 1:22:54.860
 I wonder sometimes if there's a greater,

1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:56.460
 maybe killed off a bunch of neurons

1:22:56.460 --> 1:22:57.420
 that didn't need anyway,

1:22:57.420 --> 1:22:58.860
 and they were actually getting in the way.

1:22:58.860 --> 1:23:00.580
 There were the hater neurons.

1:23:00.580 --> 1:23:01.420
 I don't know.

1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:02.540
 Well, that was your inner critic that I was talking about.

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:03.380
 Exactly.

1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:05.060
 You killed off your critic.

1:23:05.060 --> 1:23:07.340
 Well, you know, there are mechanisms for what you,

1:23:07.340 --> 1:23:10.460
 the potential mechanisms for what you're talking about.

1:23:10.460 --> 1:23:13.260
 There are, there's actually been a fair bit of research

1:23:13.260 --> 1:23:18.260
 on post COVID neurological function.

1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:20.940
 Actually, my wife, Michelle Monjay, who's at Stanford,

1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:22.340
 she's done a lot of this work.

1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:25.500
 Akiko Iwasaki at Yale has done a lot of this.

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:30.300
 But what they found is that there's a loss of myelin.

1:23:30.300 --> 1:23:33.380
 This is the coating of those long range projections

1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:35.420
 that go from one part of the brain to another.

1:23:35.420 --> 1:23:37.580
 Myelin is this sort of insulator

1:23:37.580 --> 1:23:39.220
 that coats these long range projections

1:23:39.220 --> 1:23:42.220
 and makes the impulses go faster and more reliably.

1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:48.620
 And there's altered function of the myelin producing cells

1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:52.660
 and altered myelin in the case of COVID.

1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:55.660
 They've looked in both mouse and human brains.

1:23:56.620 --> 1:23:59.980
 And, but of course it could be very idiosyncratic.

1:23:59.980 --> 1:24:03.380
 Many people have cognitive problems post COVID.

1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:04.500
 You're definitely aware of that.

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:07.260
 So many people report this persistent brain fog

1:24:07.260 --> 1:24:08.940
 and the ability to function.

1:24:08.940 --> 1:24:11.460
 But it depends on where the inflammation was.

1:24:11.460 --> 1:24:14.980
 Maybe the people who have dysfunction post COVID,

1:24:14.980 --> 1:24:17.060
 they had a global effect.

1:24:17.060 --> 1:24:20.300
 Maybe you lost some of these projections

1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:23.700
 that were restraining you in some way.

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:25.300
 And these plausibly exist.

1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:30.020
 And it's known that there are cell populations

1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:33.180
 in the prefrontal cortex that actively restrain

1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:36.380
 deeper structures from expressing what they do.

1:24:36.380 --> 1:24:39.980
 And it's theoretically possible that you had a lucky.

1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:42.380
 Somebody has to get lucky, right?

1:24:42.380 --> 1:24:44.020
 Somebody has to get lucky, yeah.

1:24:44.020 --> 1:24:45.140
 Why not me?

1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:48.900
 All right, if we can actually go back to this idea

1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:51.780
 of trying through optogenetics

1:24:53.700 --> 1:24:58.700
 to find origins of when the wave first starts.

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.780
 Origins of a decision.

1:25:01.780 --> 1:25:06.780
 Origin of idea.

1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:10.180
 Origin of maybe consciousness

1:25:10.180 --> 1:25:12.700
 or the subjective experience.

1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:15.140
 So origin of things in the mind.

1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:20.140
 So one thing, Carl Jung, is there a God neuron?

1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:24.020
 Is there a belief neuron?

1:25:24.020 --> 1:25:27.540
 Is there, so through this methodology of optogenetics,

1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:32.540
 can you start getting to where a belief begins

1:25:34.940 --> 1:25:37.340
 or an idea begins?

1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:41.020
 And especially looking at the strongest of our beliefs.

1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:43.220
 Maybe beliefs of love and hate,

1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:48.220
 but religious belief into something really grand,

1:25:51.100 --> 1:25:52.860
 on the grandest of scale.

1:25:52.860 --> 1:25:57.860
 Yeah, neuroscience and neurology point us a little bit.

1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:02.900
 We don't have an answer to that, but for example.

1:26:02.900 --> 1:26:04.340
 A lot of these questions I'm gonna ask you,

1:26:04.340 --> 1:26:07.380
 there's no good answer, but you're providing the tools

1:26:07.380 --> 1:26:09.660
 that give us hope to find the answer one day.

1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:11.020
 Yeah, and we have early clues.

1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:14.700
 So for example, when patients with epilepsy

1:26:14.700 --> 1:26:19.700
 have experiences of religiosity as part of their seizure

1:26:19.700 --> 1:26:22.620
 or the aura before their seizure,

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:26.700
 very often those are in the temporal lobe,

1:26:26.700 --> 1:26:30.420
 in these parts of the brain that are at the side.

1:26:30.420 --> 1:26:33.580
 And so that's an initial clue.

1:26:33.580 --> 1:26:37.780
 There are also parts of the brain that are involved

1:26:37.780 --> 1:26:41.500
 in the definition of the self

1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:45.900
 and defining the borders or boundaries of the self.

1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:48.980
 And we know this, this is some experiments that we did

1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:50.780
 in my lab, there's a part of the brain

1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:55.420
 where if there's a rhythm of a particular type,

1:26:55.420 --> 1:26:59.980
 you can cause a separation of the sense of self

1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.100
 from the sense of the body.

1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:04.460
 What's normally bound up and unitary,

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:06.060
 we normally think of ourself and our body

1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:08.180
 as pretty tightly bound up together,

1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:09.780
 those can be separated, it turns out.

1:27:09.780 --> 1:27:11.020
 We can't take that for granted.

1:27:11.020 --> 1:27:12.060
 And there are certain conditions,

1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:14.900
 certain patterns of activity in one part of the brain

1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:17.220
 called the retro splenial cortex,

1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:20.900
 where you can actually separate those two out.

1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:25.180
 And so if you think about these very big questions,

1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:29.420
 you know, what is, where are the origins of religiosity?

1:27:29.420 --> 1:27:33.140
 Where, how do we define the boundaries of who we are

1:27:33.140 --> 1:27:35.500
 relative to others and to the world?

1:27:36.660 --> 1:27:40.460
 How do we link ourself to our body

1:27:40.460 --> 1:27:42.100
 and how can that become separated?

1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:44.060
 These are actually, believe it or not,

1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:48.900
 now accessible and rigorously and quantitatively so.

1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:50.820
 We did an experiment with optogenetics

1:27:50.820 --> 1:27:53.620
 where we provided this abnormal rhythm

1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:57.100
 to this particular part of the mouse brain

1:27:57.100 --> 1:28:02.100
 and we saw this separation of detection of a stimulus

1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:04.620
 and caring about it.

1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:07.580
 So that's like stimulating something about the mouse brain

1:28:07.580 --> 1:28:11.940
 that affects these neurons that give the conception of self.

1:28:11.940 --> 1:28:15.380
 So you're able to dissociate the experience

1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:17.940
 from the impact of the experience onto you.

1:28:17.940 --> 1:28:19.540
 That's right, exactly right.

1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:22.140
 So like these are the goals of meditation.

1:28:23.580 --> 1:28:25.820
 These are the goals whenever I get drunk,

1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:27.300
 pretty much effective.

1:28:27.300 --> 1:28:28.980
 I mean, that's not a scientific statement,

1:28:28.980 --> 1:28:30.940
 just an experiential anecdotal one.

1:28:32.060 --> 1:28:34.740
 Also psychedelics seek to this,

1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:37.940
 to attain this kind of state.

1:28:37.940 --> 1:28:39.100
 That's so interesting.

1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:40.500
 Well, you mentioned psychedelics, you know,

1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:45.500
 DMT and 5MeO DMT, these create this religious experience,

1:28:45.580 --> 1:28:47.580
 this connection, people describe them

1:28:47.580 --> 1:28:49.500
 as a strong connection to God.

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:53.420
 That in theory, these are accessible with modern methods.

1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:56.180
 Now that we have these rich recording methods,

1:28:56.180 --> 1:29:01.180
 we can explore what are the precise millisecond resolution,

1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:05.300
 cellular resolution, brain wide manifestations

1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:06.660
 of these altered states.

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:11.020
 So like you could look at an altered state like on DMT,

1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:14.540
 record it across many people,

1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:18.020
 and then from there see where do these experiences

1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:21.540
 originate in the brain in terms of single neurons,

1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:25.260
 and then how do they propagate

1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:26.540
 and interact with everything else?

1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:30.980
 And if there's some kind of common signal,

1:29:30.980 --> 1:29:34.340
 like how do you narrow down the set of neurons

1:29:34.340 --> 1:29:36.740
 that are responsible for particular experience

1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:38.740
 or for a particular behavioral effect?

1:29:38.740 --> 1:29:40.460
 Yeah, here's where optogenetics is so useful

1:29:40.460 --> 1:29:45.460
 because anytime you give an agent like ketamine or PCP,

1:29:46.860 --> 1:29:49.500
 which we used for our dissociation experiments

1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:50.660
 that I was mentioning,

1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:55.020
 or you have a psychedelic LSD or DMT

1:29:55.020 --> 1:29:57.900
 for this altered perceptual state,

1:29:57.900 --> 1:30:00.620
 if you give either of those,

1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:03.020
 these change everything across the brain, okay?

1:30:03.020 --> 1:30:06.060
 So just the fact that you maybe give them to a mouse,

1:30:06.060 --> 1:30:08.060
 let's say, or eventually to a human,

1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:13.660
 you won't know yet which cells to home in on

1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:17.180
 as the causal players in all this

1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:19.380
 just by recording the activity.

1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:21.900
 But then what we found is that optogenetics

1:30:21.900 --> 1:30:23.780
 providing a causal pattern of activity

1:30:23.780 --> 1:30:28.020
 guided by what you see can let you test hypotheses.

1:30:28.020 --> 1:30:31.180
 And we saw this rhythm with ketamine and PCP

1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:33.980
 for dissociation, and then we said, okay,

1:30:33.980 --> 1:30:35.860
 let's test what's causal.

1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:38.100
 We came in and provided that rhythm.

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:39.500
 We tried a few different things,

1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:41.900
 but only one of the causal tests we tried

1:30:41.900 --> 1:30:45.100
 actually caused the behavioral dissociation.

1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:47.260
 And so that's how we home in on what actually matters.

1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:49.220
 And is it repeatable once you see the causality?

1:30:49.220 --> 1:30:51.260
 So like that's one definition of causality

1:30:51.260 --> 1:30:55.100
 is like you try and it repeats across different mice

1:30:55.100 --> 1:30:55.980
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:56.820
 Exactly.

1:30:58.100 --> 1:30:59.940
 And so you could do that for DMT.

1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.140
 You could do that for the really fascinating

1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:06.780
 mind expanding, thank you, thank you.

1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:08.380
 So the meme for people just listening,

1:31:08.380 --> 1:31:10.140
 this is again another disagreement

1:31:10.140 --> 1:31:13.460
 between Freud and Carl Jung.

1:31:13.460 --> 1:31:15.100
 Religion and spirituality.

1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:18.900
 This is the, I guess the ring scene from Lord of the Rings.

1:31:18.900 --> 1:31:20.820
 Religion and spirituality, Freud says,

1:31:20.820 --> 1:31:23.460
 cast it into the fire, destroy it.

1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:25.260
 Carl Jung says, no.

1:31:25.260 --> 1:31:26.580
 So for people who don't know,

1:31:26.580 --> 1:31:31.580
 Sergei is the Slavic Lord of the Meme.

1:31:31.580 --> 1:31:33.780
 Thank you, I appreciate that.

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:34.700
 So what we're talking about,

1:31:34.700 --> 1:31:36.700
 so there is, I mean, I think a connection

1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:38.540
 between DMT and religious experiences

1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:40.340
 are some of these psychedelics.

1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:41.860
 Do you think it's possible to

1:31:44.020 --> 1:31:47.300
 sort of stimulate religious experiences?

1:31:47.300 --> 1:31:50.060
 And so religious experiences are one of the most

1:31:50.060 --> 1:31:52.580
 deep kind of experiences.

1:31:52.580 --> 1:31:57.100
 And so here you could first understand

1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:00.060
 where they originate, how they propagate

1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:02.900
 through the brain, and then to stimulate them.

1:32:05.020 --> 1:32:06.740
 And so this is, and these can happen

1:32:06.740 --> 1:32:09.660
 in people who had no predisposition.

1:32:10.940 --> 1:32:15.940
 People who are as agnostic or atheistic as you'd like,

1:32:15.940 --> 1:32:17.700
 they can have these, they can feel connected

1:32:17.700 --> 1:32:20.140
 to God in these states.

1:32:20.140 --> 1:32:21.980
 Now, to be clear, I'm not advocating these.

1:32:21.980 --> 1:32:24.740
 We don't know what's safe in human beings,

1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:26.940
 but we definitely have not yet.

1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:29.540
 But we definitely can do these experiments in mice,

1:32:29.540 --> 1:32:32.300
 and that was already very productive

1:32:32.300 --> 1:32:33.700
 in understanding dissociation.

1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:37.340
 So we can already imagine making headway on these methods.

1:32:37.340 --> 1:32:39.580
 And then I had a, and this does map

1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:42.980
 onto the non psychedelic human experience.

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:45.740
 I had a patient who was actually described

1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:47.300
 in the book Projections.

1:32:47.300 --> 1:32:49.740
 This was the patient that's in the mania chapter,

1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:51.620
 the bipolar chapter.

1:32:51.620 --> 1:32:56.340
 Here was a guy who had never had a psychiatric illness

1:32:56.340 --> 1:32:57.380
 or symptom in his life.

1:32:57.380 --> 1:33:00.540
 He was a retirement age gentleman,

1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:02.900
 and nobody in his family either.

1:33:02.900 --> 1:33:05.020
 So no family history, no personal history

1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:07.260
 of any psychiatric illness, and he'd never been religious,

1:33:07.260 --> 1:33:08.820
 particularly before either.

1:33:08.820 --> 1:33:13.340
 Certainly no passionate type of religion.

1:33:13.340 --> 1:33:15.900
 But he, not through any psychedelic or drug,

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:18.060
 he had a stressful experience,

1:33:18.060 --> 1:33:21.660
 actually a post 9 11 change in how he was thinking.

1:33:21.660 --> 1:33:24.900
 And he was pushed into a mania, a manic state,

1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:26.780
 revealing that he had bipolar,

1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:29.620
 never before known in this case, in this person.

1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:33.940
 And his mania, his elevated state in bipolar

1:33:33.940 --> 1:33:37.100
 included this profound religiosity,

1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:38.260
 which he had never had before.

1:33:38.260 --> 1:33:43.260
 And he was preaching in a elevated,

1:33:44.180 --> 1:33:46.140
 vigorous way to his family.

1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:50.020
 And so this state can be created in people

1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:52.540
 even late in life who had no predisposition for it

1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:54.980
 and even without a neurochemical.

1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:59.980
 So the causality of that is very interesting to explore.

1:34:00.740 --> 1:34:05.740
 How did the manic state unleash this religiosity?

1:34:05.900 --> 1:34:08.580
 But you see that in other realms of psychiatry too.

1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:11.660
 OCD can manifest as religiosity also.

1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:13.780
 You can take people who never really had

1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:18.500
 a religion, never played a powerful role in their life,

1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:21.120
 but then when their obsessive compulsive symptoms

1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:23.180
 become severe, they can manifest in this.

1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:26.340
 I think I'm in that group, so I'm a bit OCD.

1:34:26.340 --> 1:34:29.740
 We have, I think this is subreddits,

1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:32.860
 when there's oddly satisfying things.

1:34:32.860 --> 1:34:35.980
 So there's certain things that are really satisfying

1:34:35.980 --> 1:34:39.620
 to my OCD, in my mild OCD.

1:34:39.620 --> 1:34:41.980
 I think it's pretty much a religious experience.

1:34:41.980 --> 1:34:45.900
 So I understand that if it's not direct,

1:34:45.900 --> 1:34:48.360
 it's at least rhymes.

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:51.900
 So maybe can you speak to the,

1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:54.740
 Sergei's probably desperately scrambling

1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:57.020
 to pull up oddly satisfying, thank you.

1:34:57.020 --> 1:34:58.300
 People can check it out themselves.

1:34:58.300 --> 1:35:01.740
 It is, as the subreddit promises, oddly satisfying.

1:35:03.020 --> 1:35:08.020
 Can we talk about bipolar and maybe depression?

1:35:08.020 --> 1:35:11.340
 Well, let's talk about, I mean, I don't know if there's

1:35:11.340 --> 1:35:13.900
 a nice way to discuss the differences

1:35:13.900 --> 1:35:17.660
 in the full landscape of suffering that's here,

1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:20.080
 but maybe what is depression?

1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:23.240
 And what are the types of depression?

1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:28.240
 What kind of depression have you seen and experienced

1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:31.300
 and researched and how can people overcome it?

1:35:31.300 --> 1:35:33.560
 How can humans overcome it and deal with it,

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:35.020
 live with it and overcome it?

1:35:36.300 --> 1:35:38.940
 So this is my clinical specialty.

1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:42.020
 I see patients in my outpatient clinical work

1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:44.420
 with treatment resistant depression.

1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:48.500
 So very hard to treat severe illness

1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:51.580
 where medications haven't been working.

1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:54.620
 I also see patients with autism spectrum disorders.

1:35:54.620 --> 1:35:58.540
 These are my two clinical focal areas,

1:35:58.540 --> 1:36:02.580
 but then I do emergency room work as well.

1:36:02.580 --> 1:36:06.140
 But the depression, why do I focus on that?

1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:11.140
 It's so, one feels tantalizingly close to helping

1:36:13.220 --> 1:36:16.860
 these people who are suffering so deeply.

1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:20.660
 And that's why I focused on it is these are people who,

1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:23.000
 there may not even be anything situational

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.460
 that's difficult or challenging in their life.

1:36:25.460 --> 1:36:28.120
 You can have people who seem to have everything

1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:28.960
 that you would want.

1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:30.800
 Every objective measure of their life is fine,

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:35.800
 yet they can be just hit with this unstoppable hopelessness

1:36:41.180 --> 1:36:43.280
 and inability to see into the future,

1:36:44.380 --> 1:36:47.500
 a discounting of the value of their own action.

1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:50.980
 Anything they can imagine themselves doing seems worthless

1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:54.860
 or they are unable to enjoy things.

1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:56.420
 We call this anhedonia.

1:36:56.420 --> 1:36:59.580
 There's no reward, no pleasure, not in food,

1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:02.180
 social interaction, movies, books,

1:37:02.180 --> 1:37:05.820
 anything that they would enjoy, positivity gone.

1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:09.220
 They can have a profound negative internal state,

1:37:09.220 --> 1:37:13.100
 psychic pain, and these things can seem,

1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:16.900
 and in the severe cases, are inescapable.

1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:19.580
 So what is going on?

1:37:19.580 --> 1:37:23.380
 Why is this state part of human existence?

1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:27.620
 It's got a strong biological, genetic link, we know that.

1:37:27.620 --> 1:37:29.780
 It's been linked to certain genes,

1:37:29.780 --> 1:37:33.020
 certain regions of the chromosomes, and twin studies.

1:37:33.020 --> 1:37:34.820
 There's a clear genetic link.

1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:37.740
 It doesn't explain everything, but it's a big part of it.

1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:39.900
 Genetics are a strong contributor.

1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:44.500
 And although you can have depression

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.740
 without anything terrible going on in your life,

1:37:46.740 --> 1:37:50.620
 the symptoms can be made worse by stressors, by trauma.

1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:55.860
 But at a very deep level,

1:37:55.860 --> 1:37:58.220
 there's nothing we can measure in a person objectively,

1:37:58.220 --> 1:38:01.700
 so we don't have, there's not a known chemical,

1:38:01.700 --> 1:38:04.300
 not a known structure that's different,

1:38:04.300 --> 1:38:06.180
 not a known brain activity pattern

1:38:06.180 --> 1:38:08.220
 that we can pick up with EEG.

1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:09.740
 A lot of people are exploring this,

1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:11.540
 but right now we have no objective measures.

1:38:11.540 --> 1:38:15.500
 All we do is talk to people and we elicit these symptoms.

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:20.500
 We explore them, distinguish them from other possible causes,

1:38:20.940 --> 1:38:22.540
 and then what do we do?

1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:24.900
 Well, we have a lot of things that we can do.

1:38:24.900 --> 1:38:27.340
 Well, we have a range of treatments.

1:38:27.340 --> 1:38:30.420
 We have medications that can help people,

1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:32.260
 do help people, but not everybody.

1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:34.260
 And if they don't work,

1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:36.700
 then we can go to brain stimulation methods.

1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:39.580
 We can do things even like electroconvulsive therapy,

1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:42.340
 which is very effective,

1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:45.860
 but it's sort of the final thing we go to in the end.

1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:49.260
 And so we have treatments.

1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:52.100
 They work for some people.

1:38:52.100 --> 1:38:53.500
 They don't do everything we'd like.

1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:56.620
 But here's the problem is at a very deep level,

1:38:56.620 --> 1:38:59.500
 we don't understand really what's going on in the brain.

1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:02.260
 We don't have a physical interpretation of the problem.

1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:04.740
 We have all these symptoms,

1:39:04.740 --> 1:39:07.740
 but we can't yet point to a set of cells

1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:10.480
 or a set of circuits or an activity pattern

1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:12.180
 that is causing major depression,

1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:14.600
 this disease state per se in human beings.

1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:17.780
 Why do you think you can't yet

1:39:17.780 --> 1:39:19.300
 from an optogenetics perspective?

1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:22.180
 Is it because there's so many possible causes?

1:39:22.180 --> 1:39:24.940
 Is it so many things involved?

1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:27.540
 So I think the answer is there are many things involved

1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:30.660
 and all these different symptoms that I've mentioned,

1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:32.900
 those we can study and those we can fix,

1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:34.580
 the individual symptoms.

1:39:34.580 --> 1:39:37.200
 And we can do this in animals to be clear.

1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:39.060
 So in a mouse, for example,

1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:42.840
 we can instantaneously and precisely

1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:46.500
 turn up or down the motivation of an animal

1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:48.100
 to overcome a challenge.

1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:50.300
 We can turn up or down its ability

1:39:50.300 --> 1:39:54.500
 to be motivated by, or we think experience reward

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:58.420
 from situations or actions.

1:39:59.260 --> 1:40:01.620
 We can increase its apparent energy level,

1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:06.240
 its drive to meet challenges.

1:40:07.260 --> 1:40:10.180
 We can turn up or down social interaction.

1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:12.340
 All these individual features of depression,

1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:17.220
 individual symptoms, we now can point to exact projections

1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:20.740
 and cells that are causal in mediating these.

1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:24.760
 But we don't know is why all these different symptoms

1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:27.500
 show up together in major depression

1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:29.060
 and the human disease syndrome.

1:40:29.060 --> 1:40:30.640
 And that's the mystery.

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:33.980
 It's sort of, in other fields of medicine,

1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:35.460
 someone with congestive heart failure

1:40:35.460 --> 1:40:36.740
 who comes into the clinic,

1:40:36.740 --> 1:40:38.060
 they have very different symptoms.

1:40:38.060 --> 1:40:41.140
 They have shortness of breath and they have swollen feet.

1:40:42.100 --> 1:40:46.260
 Couldn't be two more different across the body

1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:47.780
 sets of symptoms.

1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:49.780
 Neither one obviously related to the heart,

1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:50.820
 but they're both happening

1:40:50.820 --> 1:40:53.060
 because the heart is not working as a pump, okay?

1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:56.240
 And now, thankfully in cardiology,

1:40:57.140 --> 1:40:59.900
 we understand these disparate symptoms

1:40:59.900 --> 1:41:03.620
 that seem totally unrelated can be completely understood

1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:05.780
 because there's an altered pump action of the heart.

1:41:05.780 --> 1:41:10.340
 That's what we are hoping for in psychiatry

1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:13.620
 and in the study of depression or any disease.

1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:14.580
 These different symptoms,

1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:18.840
 the inability to enjoy things, the hopelessness.

1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:22.620
 What's the unifying principle?

1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:23.460
 Yeah, unifying.

1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:26.780
 I mean, is there some truth to that Tolstoy quote

1:41:26.780 --> 1:41:28.820
 that all happy families are alike

1:41:28.820 --> 1:41:31.740
 and each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way?

1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:36.460
 So basically, I mean, this is the human condition.

1:41:37.460 --> 1:41:42.260
 And basically, the physicists long to find

1:41:42.260 --> 1:41:47.180
 a theory of everything, isn't understanding depression

1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:51.460
 essentially require you to really have

1:41:51.460 --> 1:41:53.900
 the big theory of everything for the human mind?

1:41:55.380 --> 1:41:58.360
 I think we, it would certainly be nice to have that,

1:41:58.360 --> 1:41:59.700
 a theory of everything.

1:41:59.700 --> 1:42:00.720
 Don't get me wrong.

1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:01.560
 I don't think we need it.

1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.260
 The understatement of the century, it would be nice.

1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:07.780
 Well, it's also a good question if it's possible.

1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:08.780
 Yeah, yeah.

1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:11.940
 Well, that I have some thoughts on too.

1:42:11.940 --> 1:42:14.900
 But to this specific question,

1:42:14.900 --> 1:42:16.340
 I don't think we need a theory of everything.

1:42:16.340 --> 1:42:20.380
 I think there will be unifying principles we can get to.

1:42:20.380 --> 1:42:23.540
 But even shy of that, we can treat symptoms

1:42:23.540 --> 1:42:24.640
 and that's a big step.

1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:27.920
 And as you say, different unhappy families are different,

1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:30.060
 different unhappy people are different.

1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:31.740
 If we have somebody who comes to the clinic

1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:34.700
 and I see someone with a profound anhedonia

1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:36.360
 as one of their main symptoms,

1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.100
 inability to enjoy things,

1:42:38.100 --> 1:42:41.380
 and if I know based on optogenetics work and animal work

1:42:41.380 --> 1:42:44.700
 that a particular medication can treat anhedonia,

1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:47.340
 even if it doesn't fix major depression in everybody,

1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:50.420
 if I treat that one symptom in that one person,

1:42:50.420 --> 1:42:51.620
 that's a good thing.

1:42:51.620 --> 1:42:55.300
 And so we don't need the theory of everything

1:42:55.300 --> 1:42:58.420
 and we don't even need the unifying principle

1:42:58.420 --> 1:43:01.620
 to help people with insights that come from optogenetics.

1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:05.580
 How much does talking help for diagnosis

1:43:05.580 --> 1:43:09.760
 and for treatment, would you say, for depression?

1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:11.560
 It's a big part of what we do.

1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:15.260
 Every good psychiatrist should be pretty adept

1:43:15.260 --> 1:43:18.200
 in these verbal communications and talk therapy

1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:20.020
 as part of what they do.

1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:22.900
 I give medications, I deliver brain stimulation treatments,

1:43:22.900 --> 1:43:26.340
 but a big, big part of everything I do with every patient

1:43:26.340 --> 1:43:31.000
 is talk therapy because it works so well together

1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.300
 with these other modalities.

1:43:33.300 --> 1:43:36.180
 Even alone, it can help people with moderate

1:43:36.180 --> 1:43:39.980
 or mild depression by itself.

1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:41.580
 People with severe depression,

1:43:41.580 --> 1:43:46.260
 people with other psychiatric illnesses that are severe,

1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:47.780
 you don't wanna do talk therapy alone,

1:43:47.780 --> 1:43:48.860
 that's not gonna do it.

1:43:48.860 --> 1:43:52.220
 But it still is crucial to do together with the others.

1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:56.700
 And it's critical because it's part of how

1:43:56.700 --> 1:44:01.300
 you reshape cognitions, complex activity patterns,

1:44:01.300 --> 1:44:03.580
 and you won't get to that with a medication

1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:05.380
 or a brain stimulation treatment.

1:44:05.380 --> 1:44:07.780
 Do you have advice for people who suffer

1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:12.660
 from mild forms of depression or feel as they might,

1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:14.980
 both for those people, and do you have advice

1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:19.480
 for people who love the people who suffer

1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:22.060
 from depression and want to help?

1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:26.340
 Yeah, one of the incredibly frustrating things

1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:30.620
 about depression is the very nature of it makes it hard

1:44:30.620 --> 1:44:34.220
 for the people who suffer to get treatment

1:44:34.220 --> 1:44:35.740
 because they're hopeless,

1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:37.460
 so they don't think treatment will help.

1:44:37.460 --> 1:44:40.540
 They have low energy, so they're not motivated

1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:42.580
 to participate in treatment in many cases.

1:44:43.980 --> 1:44:46.500
 Sometimes they're actively suicidal.

1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:48.300
 That certainly doesn't help.

1:44:48.300 --> 1:44:53.300
 They have all these things that seem to prevent treatment

1:44:53.780 --> 1:44:54.620
 from being effective.

1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:56.340
 So the loved ones, that's where the loved ones

1:44:56.340 --> 1:44:59.780
 are so important, is helping them overcome these barriers

1:44:59.780 --> 1:45:04.780
 to treatment, the motivation, the safety, and the insight.

1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:09.460
 That's critical, and particularly for the severe cases.

1:45:09.460 --> 1:45:13.780
 For the mild cases, where people still have some insight

1:45:13.780 --> 1:45:16.580
 and motivation and energy to get something done,

1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:19.200
 there are many things you can do.

1:45:20.740 --> 1:45:25.500
 Exercise is extremely important in mood maintenance.

1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:28.260
 Regulation of sleep and getting sufficient

1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:31.140
 and regular enough sleep is very important.

1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:33.540
 And talk therapy can be helpful in those mild

1:45:33.540 --> 1:45:36.380
 or moderate cases, just looking at cognitions,

1:45:36.380 --> 1:45:40.700
 looking at patterns of thought that people

1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:43.500
 may have fallen into, where they catastrophize,

1:45:43.500 --> 1:45:47.640
 where they spiral from small things into big things.

1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:52.640
 A little bit of talk therapy, 10, 12 sessions,

1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:55.680
 can help people identify those patterns they may have

1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.680
 in themselves that are taking occasional negative thoughts,

1:46:00.980 --> 1:46:03.820
 which everybody has, and magnifying those

1:46:03.820 --> 1:46:06.980
 into more persistent negative states.

1:46:08.220 --> 1:46:10.780
 If you work at this, and it's kind of like homework,

1:46:10.780 --> 1:46:14.060
 this is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:15.620
 It's very structured, very organized.

1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:16.460
 You work hard.

1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:18.100
 It requires insight and motivation,

1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.340
 and you have to be motivated.

1:46:20.340 --> 1:46:23.380
 But if you are, then you can identify these triggers

1:46:23.380 --> 1:46:25.300
 that send you down particular pathways.

1:46:25.300 --> 1:46:27.100
 And work to intercept them.

1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:30.500
 And that is amazingly very effective

1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:32.340
 in mild to moderate cases.

1:46:32.340 --> 1:46:35.460
 So you basically have to train yourself

1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:40.300
 to see the world as a collection of triggers.

1:46:40.300 --> 1:46:44.900
 And you have to first understand, like collect the data,

1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:47.200
 like basically see every experience

1:46:48.780 --> 1:46:53.780
 as a thing that creates a follow on emotion, a feeling.

1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:58.780
 And like, I've learned this, you know, like on social media,

1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:04.380
 where like early on, you know, like all of us,

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:08.260
 you know, I'll say something,

1:47:08.260 --> 1:47:12.820
 I kind of respond to negativity with negativity.

1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:16.380
 And then you observe the results of that.

1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:21.300
 And then over time, you think, wait a minute.

1:47:21.300 --> 1:47:24.020
 This thing that I've been doing where

1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:27.540
 when somebody says, you suck, and you say, no, you suck.

1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:32.980
 That never produces the result you thought it might.

1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:37.980
 And so might not want to just, don't say you suck back.

1:47:38.420 --> 1:47:41.640
 And I do this through a lot of things in life.

1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:46.460
 I'm very fortunate to not suffer from depression,

1:47:46.460 --> 1:47:51.460
 but first of all, I have had and have people in my life

1:47:51.980 --> 1:47:56.980
 who do, and also, you know, all of us have depression

1:47:57.060 --> 1:48:00.740
 who don't suffer from depression, have depression out.

1:48:00.740 --> 1:48:03.140
 Like, it's always knocking on the door.

1:48:03.140 --> 1:48:04.380
 Right, yeah.

1:48:04.380 --> 1:48:09.380
 And so you have mild, I mean,

1:48:09.620 --> 1:48:14.280
 if you're very careless with the triggers all around you,

1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:17.960
 then you're just, I think all of us have the capacity

1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:22.300
 to really suffer from that kind of chemical

1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:26.240
 or psychological or philosophical existential crisis.

1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:30.220
 But then it raises a question, why are we built this way?

1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:32.700
 It seems like it doesn't make sense, right?

1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:34.720
 And here's where some of us thinking about

1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:38.940
 where we came from as the human family

1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:40.500
 is kind of interesting.

1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:44.420
 It doesn't make sense that somewhere on that spectrum

1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:48.200
 that it's good to detect that there's an array

1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:51.900
 of adverse forces out there in the world right now

1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:56.900
 at this moment and to withdraw, to hunker down,

1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:02.500
 to not fight, not strive, not try to meet the challenge

1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:06.560
 and outweigh these negative forces

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:08.220
 that are present out there.

1:49:08.220 --> 1:49:13.220
 And that makes a lot of sense, and all animals

1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:15.940
 that have been studied in one form or another show this.

1:49:15.940 --> 1:49:18.260
 Even the worm that I mentioned earlier,

1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:22.360
 C. elegans with 302 neurons, it can effectively give up

1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:24.020
 in challenging situations.

1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:25.900
 We've done this with zebrafish,

1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:28.420
 tiny little transparent fish.

1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:30.340
 You can give them a challenging situation

1:49:30.340 --> 1:49:33.980
 and they will give up, but then if you stimulate

1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:37.180
 a couple very specific brain regions in particular ways,

1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:40.460
 you can motivate them to overcome the challenge.

1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:41.780
 And if you inhibit those regions,

1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:44.660
 they give up much more easily than they would otherwise.

1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:47.220
 You can do this in mice, you can do this in rats.

1:49:47.220 --> 1:49:49.880
 So this is an ancestral conserve pattern

1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:53.980
 to detect that things are pretty bad out there

1:49:54.940 --> 1:49:58.660
 and to conserve energy, to hunker down,

1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:00.260
 to wait out the storm.

1:50:00.260 --> 1:50:04.300
 So as you, unfortunately, many of our maladies

1:50:04.300 --> 1:50:09.300
 have useful roots that contribute to our survival.

1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:14.900
 So both depression and motivation have uses.

1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:18.540
 And sometimes it's nice to just shut the hell up

1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:22.180
 and huddle with the penguins versus,

1:50:22.180 --> 1:50:24.940
 for some unknown reason, venture out on your own

1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:28.060
 into the mountains like a David Goggins type character.

1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:31.660
 So what's the difference to you between,

1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:36.260
 you see patients, between sort of rigorous psychoanalysis?

1:50:38.780 --> 1:50:41.100
 I don't know if you consider talk therapy

1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:42.740
 and psychoanalysis, are they neighbors,

1:50:42.740 --> 1:50:43.740
 are they overlapping?

1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:45.220
 They're neighbors.

1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:49.140
 Psychoanalysis is, they're relatively,

1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:51.940
 it's not nearly done as much as the talk therapy,

1:50:51.940 --> 1:50:54.340
 like the cognitive behavioral therapy I mentioned.

1:50:56.540 --> 1:51:00.540
 The psychoanalysis is a little more niche now

1:51:00.540 --> 1:51:04.020
 and partly because it's not, the data isn't,

1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:09.060
 in terms of actual treatment of actual therapeutic effects,

1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:13.020
 data not as supportive as for cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:15.940
 But it's still interesting as for insight,

1:51:15.940 --> 1:51:17.500
 people, a lot of people still do it

1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:19.700
 to gain insight into themselves.

1:51:19.700 --> 1:51:23.140
 And in general, it's a good sort of conversation starter.

1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:27.460
 Those methods, they're good for getting things out.

1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:30.300
 We don't focus on dreams typically these days

1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:32.540
 in psychiatry, but they're great conversation starters.

1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:35.500
 They're great ways to get things out if people have,

1:51:37.140 --> 1:51:39.020
 and so we like to use those methods

1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:41.060
 just to get the ball rolling sometimes,

1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:42.900
 get people to open up a little bit.

1:51:42.900 --> 1:51:45.940
 But the actual treatment tends not to involve

1:51:45.940 --> 1:51:49.860
 these psychoanalytic approaches where you are really

1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:53.620
 probing the unconscious mind and its manifestation

1:51:53.620 --> 1:51:58.020
 through dreams, for example, as the goal.

1:51:58.020 --> 1:51:59.180
 That's not the goal.

1:51:59.180 --> 1:52:01.540
 Modern talk therapy, we're really focusing on treatment,

1:52:01.540 --> 1:52:03.020
 how to get people to feel better.

1:52:03.020 --> 1:52:05.060
 See, I use that as a conversation opener,

1:52:05.060 --> 1:52:09.780
 the Freudian thing where I try to delve at a bar

1:52:09.780 --> 1:52:13.180
 of the deep sexual desires in a person's subconscious

1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:16.020
 and I find that opens up possibilities very quickly.

1:52:16.020 --> 1:52:20.340
 Now, what's, I mean, this is a silly sounding question,

1:52:20.340 --> 1:52:22.180
 but what's the difference between

1:52:22.180 --> 1:52:25.580
 cognitive behavioral therapy and conversation?

1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:30.340
 So, because I personally, as a fan of conversations,

1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:32.740
 as a fan of just, I like listening to podcasts

1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:36.020
 versus like audio book, I like both,

1:52:36.020 --> 1:52:38.580
 but they're very different and I like conversation.

1:52:38.580 --> 1:52:41.180
 I like, it makes me personally very anxious,

1:52:41.180 --> 1:52:45.020
 so I like to be the listener, like a third wheel,

1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:47.660
 like overhearing a conversation kind of thing,

1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:51.140
 but it's a really powerful method for humans

1:52:51.140 --> 1:52:54.340
 to explore each other's mind, just raw conversation.

1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:58.260
 So, do you think it can be more productive

1:52:58.260 --> 1:53:01.740
 to be very systematic about it or is conversation itself

1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.700
 the art form of helping each other,

1:53:04.700 --> 1:53:06.740
 understanding each other and helping each other?

1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:08.580
 There are forms of talk therapy

1:53:08.580 --> 1:53:10.940
 that are essentially conversational

1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:13.460
 or they much more approach pure conversation.

1:53:13.460 --> 1:53:17.100
 There's a befriending therapy,

1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:18.460
 there's interpersonal therapy.

1:53:18.460 --> 1:53:23.060
 These are approaches that are purely talk therapy,

1:53:23.060 --> 1:53:25.580
 but they're not as structured

1:53:25.580 --> 1:53:26.780
 as cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:53:26.780 --> 1:53:28.980
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is,

1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:31.060
 there are manuals, there are guidelines.

1:53:31.060 --> 1:53:33.700
 You can almost go through it in a very cookbooky way.

1:53:33.700 --> 1:53:35.700
 There's homework that you get done.

1:53:35.700 --> 1:53:38.700
 So, it's in its fullest form,

1:53:38.700 --> 1:53:39.700
 it's very different from these

1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:42.140
 more conversational strategies.

1:53:42.140 --> 1:53:44.300
 But what's interesting is sometimes people compare them

1:53:44.300 --> 1:53:47.820
 and so you'll see almost like randomized controlled studies

1:53:49.540 --> 1:53:51.340
 comparing cognitive behavioral therapy

1:53:51.340 --> 1:53:53.580
 with interpersonal therapy, for example.

1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:56.180
 And they both can work and actually in some studies,

1:53:56.180 --> 1:53:58.020
 they look comparable.

1:53:59.180 --> 1:54:03.340
 So, to your point, conversation and insights

1:54:03.340 --> 1:54:05.500
 that come from conversation, if done well,

1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:09.060
 if done artfully, can be as powerful.

1:54:09.060 --> 1:54:10.980
 This reminds me of Robin Williams.

1:54:10.980 --> 1:54:13.980
 I have to ask you several questions here on that.

1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:16.980
 But one of my favorite movies is Good Will Hunting.

1:54:16.980 --> 1:54:19.420
 I don't know if you've seen it with Robin Williams.

1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:21.940
 So, as a psychiatrist yourself,

1:54:21.940 --> 1:54:25.620
 can you do a deep analysis of this other famous psychiatrist

1:54:25.620 --> 1:54:29.020
 which is the movie character played by Robin Williams

1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:30.700
 at Good Will Hunting?

1:54:30.700 --> 1:54:33.260
 Is it just a caricature between a psychiatrist

1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:35.340
 and patient relationship?

1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:39.340
 Or is there something to you that was moving

1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:41.220
 about his ability to connect

1:54:41.220 --> 1:54:44.260
 to this obviously struggling young kid?

1:54:45.140 --> 1:54:46.580
 I think you hit on the key thing there

1:54:46.580 --> 1:54:48.820
 which is the depth of the connection.

1:54:48.820 --> 1:54:53.820
 If there's too powerful a connection,

1:54:55.580 --> 1:54:58.340
 that can impair therapy

1:54:58.340 --> 1:55:01.140
 because it could impair open communication.

1:55:01.140 --> 1:55:05.540
 If someone, if a patient has a, sees the role,

1:55:05.540 --> 1:55:08.140
 sees the relationship in a particular way,

1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:09.700
 like in a friendly way maybe,

1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:14.420
 or like a parental child type way,

1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:17.860
 that can cause problems because then what they choose

1:55:17.860 --> 1:55:21.700
 to share, what they choose to bring up is selected

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:25.540
 to be appropriate for that view of the relationship.

1:55:26.460 --> 1:55:31.100
 And so, I and many other talk therapists actually prefer

1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:37.060
 not to let things get, not let the connection get that deep.

1:55:37.500 --> 1:55:39.180
 You wanna have trust.

1:55:39.180 --> 1:55:42.620
 You wanna have a therapeutic alliance, we sometimes call it.

1:55:44.260 --> 1:55:47.180
 But it's got to be enough of a blank slate

1:55:47.180 --> 1:55:50.820
 that the patient is not consciously

1:55:50.820 --> 1:55:54.500
 or unconsciously constrained in what they choose to share.

1:55:55.780 --> 1:56:00.780
 And so, great movie, great actors, all good,

1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:06.300
 no complaints except realistically,

1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:09.020
 the relationship should be a little more arm's length

1:56:09.020 --> 1:56:09.860
 than that.

1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:13.140
 Let's pretend this is real life.

1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:16.900
 Sometimes can't you leave a little bit of yourself

1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:18.540
 in the interaction with the patient?

1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:20.540
 I mean, it's another human being.

1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:22.420
 Yes, so there's a balance.

1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:24.420
 And actually you do need some of it

1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:28.820
 because let's say this person is having challenges,

1:56:28.820 --> 1:56:30.740
 interpersonal challenges in their life.

1:56:32.340 --> 1:56:35.060
 The best way to notice what those are

1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:38.860
 and to identify them and to work with them

1:56:39.740 --> 1:56:43.220
 is if you can elicit some of those problems

1:56:43.220 --> 1:56:47.620
 in the office, in the therapeutic interaction.

1:56:47.620 --> 1:56:49.980
 And this is really powerful.

1:56:49.980 --> 1:56:54.420
 As long as you're alert to it, aware of it,

1:56:54.420 --> 1:56:56.980
 and you don't let it go out of hand,

1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:58.980
 this transference, we call it,

1:56:58.980 --> 1:57:03.980
 is when you transfer in between

1:57:04.700 --> 1:57:06.380
 the current therapeutic relationship

1:57:06.380 --> 1:57:08.580
 and external relationships

1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:10.700
 that the patient may have had with others.

1:57:10.700 --> 1:57:12.860
 And so if the therapist starts to feel

1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:17.940
 an inner feeling like anger, let's say.

1:57:17.940 --> 1:57:18.940
 So let's say you have a patient

1:57:18.940 --> 1:57:22.260
 who is stirring frustration in you

1:57:22.260 --> 1:57:24.420
 or even in extreme cases, anger,

1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:26.900
 the best thing for the therapist to do in that case

1:57:26.900 --> 1:57:31.100
 is to recognize it and to realize

1:57:31.100 --> 1:57:33.300
 that's probably being stirred by other people

1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:34.860
 in the patient's life.

1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:37.020
 And that could be the source of a lot of problems.

1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:39.940
 And so instead of trying to wall it off,

1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:42.020
 and say, oh, I shouldn't be feeling that,

1:57:42.020 --> 1:57:44.300
 I better be a better therapist instead,

1:57:44.300 --> 1:57:45.980
 and recognize it and use it,

1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:48.260
 and help the patient that way.

1:57:48.260 --> 1:57:49.620
 And so you've gotta be a human being.

1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:52.060
 You've gotta be a person who feels.

1:57:52.060 --> 1:57:53.660
 You've gotta be open.

1:57:53.660 --> 1:57:56.540
 But be in control of it and be aware of it.

1:57:56.540 --> 1:57:58.380
 If I may, I just wanna read,

1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:00.020
 because it's one of my favorite scenes.

1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:02.620
 Probably one of the greatest scenes,

1:58:02.620 --> 1:58:04.540
 one of the greatest scenes in movie history

1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:07.460
 because Robin Williams does a single take.

1:58:08.540 --> 1:58:09.380
 Is that right?

1:58:09.380 --> 1:58:10.220
 I didn't know that.

1:58:10.220 --> 1:58:12.060
 So this is a very interesting interaction between them.

1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:15.380
 So Will, and I'm sure this is a common interaction,

1:58:17.380 --> 1:58:19.060
 maybe with a therapist and a patient,

1:58:19.060 --> 1:58:21.300
 maybe with a father and son,

1:58:21.300 --> 1:58:23.500
 where Will, the young character,

1:58:23.500 --> 1:58:25.060
 the young, brilliant mathematician,

1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:28.380
 and Sean is the therapist, the older therapist,

1:58:28.380 --> 1:58:31.820
 where Will looks at a painting that Sean painted

1:58:31.820 --> 1:58:35.940
 and then does a deep, critical analysis of the painting

1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:40.580
 that basically describes pretending

1:58:40.580 --> 1:58:43.420
 as if he can understand another human being completely

1:58:43.420 --> 1:58:45.420
 by just looking at their painting.

1:58:45.420 --> 1:58:48.100
 And then Sean gives this whole speech

1:58:49.300 --> 1:58:52.340
 that contrasts sort of raw intelligence

1:58:52.340 --> 1:58:54.300
 and the wisdom of experience.

1:58:54.300 --> 1:58:56.860
 And Sean says, single take.

1:58:56.860 --> 1:58:59.620
 He says, you've never been out of Boston, right?

1:58:59.620 --> 1:59:01.260
 And Will says, nope.

1:59:01.260 --> 1:59:03.660
 All this in a sexy Boston accent, by the way.

1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:07.420
 And then Sean gives the speech.

1:59:07.420 --> 1:59:08.820
 If I asked you about art,

1:59:08.820 --> 1:59:10.340
 you'd probably give me the skinny

1:59:10.340 --> 1:59:12.940
 and about every art book ever written.

1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:15.700
 Michelangelo, you know a lot about him.

1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:17.540
 Life's work, political aspirations,

1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:19.700
 him and the Pope, sexual orientation,

1:59:19.700 --> 1:59:21.380
 the whole works, right?

1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:23.980
 But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like

1:59:23.980 --> 1:59:26.060
 in the Sistine Chapel.

1:59:26.060 --> 1:59:27.660
 You never actually stood there

1:59:27.660 --> 1:59:31.460
 and looked up at that beautiful ceiling, seeing that.

1:59:31.460 --> 1:59:32.780
 If I asked you about women,

1:59:32.780 --> 1:59:34.860
 you'll probably give me a syllabus

1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:36.700
 of your personal favorites.

1:59:36.700 --> 1:59:40.220
 You may have even been laid a few times.

1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:42.700
 The language here is just beautiful.

1:59:42.700 --> 1:59:45.420
 But you can't tell me what it feels like

1:59:45.420 --> 1:59:48.220
 to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.

1:59:49.100 --> 1:59:50.580
 You're a tough kid.

1:59:50.580 --> 1:59:51.740
 If I asked you about war,

1:59:51.740 --> 1:59:54.460
 you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right?

1:59:54.460 --> 1:59:57.380
 Probably not, but let's say.

1:59:57.380 --> 1:59:59.860
 Once more into the breach here, friends.

1:59:59.860 --> 2:00:02.220
 But you've never been near one.

2:00:02.220 --> 2:00:05.060
 You've never held your best friend's head on your lap

2:00:05.060 --> 2:00:07.060
 and watched him gasp his last breath,

2:00:07.060 --> 2:00:09.300
 looking to you for help.

2:00:09.300 --> 2:00:11.420
 If I asked you about love,

2:00:11.420 --> 2:00:13.300
 you'd probably quote me a sonnet.

2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:16.140
 But you've never looked at a woman

2:00:16.140 --> 2:00:18.540
 and be truly vulnerable,

2:00:18.540 --> 2:00:21.780
 known someone who can level you with their eyes,

2:00:21.780 --> 2:00:25.420
 feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you,

2:00:25.420 --> 2:00:27.780
 who could rescue you from the depths of hell

2:00:27.780 --> 2:00:32.340
 and you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel.

2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:34.300
 To have that love for her,

2:00:34.300 --> 2:00:38.340
 be there forever, through anything, through cancer.

2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:40.260
 And you wouldn't know about sleeping,

2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:42.620
 sitting up in a hospital room for two months,

2:00:42.620 --> 2:00:46.260
 holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes

2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:49.220
 the terms visiting hours don't apply to you.

2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:51.260
 You don't know about real loss

2:00:51.260 --> 2:00:55.180
 because that only occurs when you love something

2:00:55.180 --> 2:00:57.860
 more than you love yourself.

2:00:57.860 --> 2:01:01.860
 I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.

2:01:01.860 --> 2:01:03.260
 I look at you.

2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:05.700
 I don't see an intelligent, confident man.

2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:08.900
 I see a cocky, scared, shitless kid.

2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:10.380
 But you're a genius, Will.

2:01:10.380 --> 2:01:12.060
 No one denies that.

2:01:12.060 --> 2:01:14.820
 No one can possibly understand the depths of you.

2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:16.700
 But you presume to know everything about me

2:01:16.700 --> 2:01:18.740
 because you saw a painting of mine

2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:21.660
 you ripped my fucking life apart.

2:01:21.660 --> 2:01:23.860
 You're an orphan, right?

2:01:23.860 --> 2:01:25.300
 Do you think I know the first thing

2:01:25.300 --> 2:01:27.620
 about how hard your life has been,

2:01:27.620 --> 2:01:31.740
 how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist?

2:01:31.740 --> 2:01:33.980
 Does that encapsulate you?

2:01:33.980 --> 2:01:36.020
 Personally, I don't give a shit about all that

2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:37.540
 because you know what?

2:01:37.540 --> 2:01:39.220
 I can't learn anything from you

2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:41.740
 that I can't read in some fucking book

2:01:41.740 --> 2:01:45.260
 unless you want to talk about you, who you are.

2:01:45.260 --> 2:01:47.540
 And I'm fascinated, I'm in.

2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:50.380
 But you don't want to do that, do you, sport?

2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:53.660
 You're terrified of what you might say.

2:01:53.660 --> 2:01:55.820
 Your move, chief.

2:01:55.820 --> 2:01:57.500
 Well done, sir, I know it's a movie.

2:01:57.500 --> 2:01:58.820
 It's interesting, right?

2:01:58.820 --> 2:02:00.140
 So some of that conversation

2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:03.140
 is at some intellectual level, too.

2:02:03.140 --> 2:02:06.060
 It's not just emotional, it's something,

2:02:06.060 --> 2:02:10.700
 it's like, the reason I kind of connect with that is

2:02:10.700 --> 2:02:14.300
 that's a lot of work for a therapist.

2:02:14.300 --> 2:02:16.180
 Like, to really understand another,

2:02:16.180 --> 2:02:19.520
 because he's, I mean, from, okay, I know this is fictional,

2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:22.900
 but just, there's calculation happening.

2:02:22.900 --> 2:02:26.020
 He deeply cares to say the words

2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:27.960
 that the other person needs to hear,

2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:32.620
 but also a little bit loses himself in the pride,

2:02:32.620 --> 2:02:35.220
 but then catches himself again,

2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:38.620
 switches from anger to connection.

2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:39.500
 Yeah.

2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:40.900
 A lot is brought up there.

2:02:40.900 --> 2:02:42.900
 You're right, there has to be some emotion

2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:46.140
 in the therapist to care enough to keep going,

2:02:46.140 --> 2:02:51.140
 to keep probing, to open up as he's doing so, right?

2:02:51.140 --> 2:02:53.940
 He revealed a lot about himself, his own vulnerabilities,

2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:56.780
 but that gave him authenticity.

2:02:56.780 --> 2:02:58.060
 He had to open himself up

2:02:58.060 --> 2:03:01.780
 so that the kid would see the authenticity

2:03:01.780 --> 2:03:03.800
 and open himself up in return.

2:03:05.100 --> 2:03:10.020
 So how do you do that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist?

2:03:10.020 --> 2:03:11.140
 You have to be careful.

2:03:11.140 --> 2:03:13.740
 You don't wanna do too much,

2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:17.540
 but opening up a little bit does help.

2:03:17.540 --> 2:03:20.260
 It does create a chance.

2:03:20.260 --> 2:03:21.420
 You're offering up something

2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.740
 and that helps the patient come back in return,

2:03:24.740 --> 2:03:28.740
 and it gives you that believability and authenticity.

2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:31.380
 Do you pay the price for that, for opening it up?

2:03:31.380 --> 2:03:32.900
 You can.

2:03:32.900 --> 2:03:33.820
 You have a family.

2:03:33.820 --> 2:03:38.220
 You have an incredibly difficult research.

2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:40.380
 You're doing a lot of things in your world.

2:03:40.380 --> 2:03:42.500
 I mean, it's the price you pay for like.

2:03:43.900 --> 2:03:45.740
 Well, this was one of the terrifying things

2:03:45.740 --> 2:03:50.100
 about writing the book was I do open up

2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:52.620
 in a little bit about my own personal life,

2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:53.820
 my own personal challenges,

2:03:53.820 --> 2:03:55.540
 and that was a considered decision

2:03:55.540 --> 2:04:00.540
 because I could have done the patient work

2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:02.200
 and the science work

2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:04.900
 and the history of the human family work

2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:06.480
 and tied it all together,

2:04:07.860 --> 2:04:12.860
 but it wasn't, and in an early draft, it was like that,

2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:15.540
 but it wasn't real yet.

2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:19.540
 It wasn't something that everybody could connect with,

2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:22.180
 and I said, then I realized, look, if I'm gonna do this,

2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:26.380
 I've gotta open up myself,

2:04:26.380 --> 2:04:28.140
 and then people can connect with me

2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:31.780
 and see what I'm really saying, and so I did,

2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:36.780
 and that was not something that I'd gone in planning to do.

2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:39.360
 In retrospect, I learned a lot about myself.

2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:42.300
 It was actually really, I think, a good thing that I did,

2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:43.820
 but it was scary.

2:04:43.820 --> 2:04:48.820
 Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?

2:04:51.300 --> 2:04:55.500
 You know, I had, things haven't always been easy,

2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:57.300
 personally or professionally.

2:04:57.300 --> 2:05:00.820
 I had moments, you know, I was effectively a single dad

2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:03.180
 for a while, a number of years,

2:05:03.180 --> 2:05:05.300
 and these came at probably the hardest,

2:05:05.300 --> 2:05:09.440
 also, professional lifetimes for me, too,

2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:13.380
 the absolute hardest days of late medical school,

2:05:13.380 --> 2:05:18.300
 internship, taking call, getting up at 3 a.m.,

2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:23.300
 surgery, medicine, rounds, unforgiving environments,

2:05:24.380 --> 2:05:27.260
 and then all the while, personal life,

2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:32.500
 stripped down to the bare, and these were low moments,

2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:34.460
 and then I was hit particularly hard by

2:05:35.740 --> 2:05:39.420
 just experiences on the clinical ward,

2:05:39.420 --> 2:05:42.020
 connecting too deeply with patients,

2:05:42.020 --> 2:05:44.020
 like a child with a brain tumor,

2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:47.420
 and feeling it too strongly, and those things,

2:05:49.400 --> 2:05:51.760
 when you get down to those lowest of the low moments,

2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:53.580
 when everything is stripped away,

2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:58.160
 and there's only this raw core,

2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:00.260
 well, that's pretty hard.

2:06:00.260 --> 2:06:02.060
 That was probably the lowest moment,

2:06:02.060 --> 2:06:04.180
 and you learn a lot about yourself in those moments,

2:06:04.180 --> 2:06:09.180
 you know, what's left, and then what are the roots out

2:06:09.180 --> 2:06:14.180
 from there, and that can be powerful to see in yourself.

2:06:15.420 --> 2:06:18.860
 Have you thought about killing yourself?

2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:20.260
 I have not.

2:06:20.260 --> 2:06:21.100
 I have not.

2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:23.580
 Have you seen that thought in the distance?

2:06:25.140 --> 2:06:28.940
 I am fortunate that that has not come to my mind,

2:06:28.940 --> 2:06:32.020
 and I have not seen it, even in the distance,

2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:36.900
 and in some ways, I've wondered if that's made me,

2:06:36.900 --> 2:06:40.620
 am I a less effective psychiatrist because of that?

2:06:40.620 --> 2:06:44.060
 I've been, I've felt everything stripped away.

2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:48.220
 I've been at the lowest of the low, and yet, that.

2:06:48.220 --> 2:06:49.060
 There's still hope.

2:06:49.060 --> 2:06:52.420
 There's a light of hope still at the end of the tunnel.

2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:55.280
 So you never lost, even for brief moments, that.

2:06:56.780 --> 2:06:57.780
 Never did.

2:06:57.780 --> 2:06:59.020
 I don't know why.

2:06:59.020 --> 2:06:59.860
 You don't know why.

2:06:59.860 --> 2:07:00.820
 There was no reason.

2:07:00.820 --> 2:07:01.660
 You don't know why.

2:07:01.660 --> 2:07:03.900
 No reason to feel hope at that moment, honestly.

2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:07.700
 Uh, so it was just the light without reason.

2:07:07.700 --> 2:07:08.840
 Yeah, that's right.

2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:13.180
 What wisdom do you draw from that time?

2:07:15.060 --> 2:07:19.460
 About, so first of all, you said something funny,

2:07:19.460 --> 2:07:23.140
 which is, I wonder if it, that it's somehow

2:07:23.140 --> 2:07:28.140
 not having thoughts of suicide limits your capacity

2:07:28.140 --> 2:07:33.140
 to truly understand somebody who is having those thoughts.

2:07:34.780 --> 2:07:39.380
 So how many demons must a psychiatrist have

2:07:39.380 --> 2:07:41.460
 in order to be a good psychiatrist?

2:07:42.940 --> 2:07:45.420
 You know, this is a really interesting question.

2:07:45.420 --> 2:07:47.580
 I think everybody knows, and I can say this,

2:07:47.580 --> 2:07:50.820
 that psychiatrists can be a little unusual.

2:07:50.820 --> 2:07:53.700
 We think about ourselves, right?

2:07:53.700 --> 2:07:54.780
 We think about our brains.

2:07:54.780 --> 2:07:56.940
 That may be one reason why we become psychiatrists

2:07:56.940 --> 2:07:59.340
 is we think, oh, that's interesting going on in there.

2:07:59.340 --> 2:08:00.660
 What's that about?

2:08:00.660 --> 2:08:03.940
 So a little introspective, a little introverted maybe,

2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:07.720
 and that's what can make us good when we're good.

2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:12.720
 And, but also that may select for people

2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:14.740
 who have some unusual aspects,

2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:17.140
 but you don't have to have all of them.

2:08:17.140 --> 2:08:21.100
 There's a lot that can go wrong in the psychiatric realm.

2:08:21.100 --> 2:08:24.860
 I think having some of those, some of it,

2:08:24.860 --> 2:08:26.140
 but not all of it is enough.

2:08:26.140 --> 2:08:29.580
 You get to see how low things can get.

2:08:29.580 --> 2:08:34.580
 You can get, you get empathy from that,

2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:37.560
 even if the symptoms are not the same.

2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:41.060
 Just empathy for struggle, for suffering.

2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:42.820
 That's right, that's right.

2:08:42.820 --> 2:08:46.820
 Do you yourself have to practice observing triggers

2:08:46.820 --> 2:08:49.480
 just as a human operating in this world?

2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:53.200
 I've definitely, those skills that have come from therapy,

2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:55.940
 I've found them useful, yeah.

2:08:55.940 --> 2:09:00.020
 If I noticed that, we've all been through experiences

2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:03.380
 where we wonder, oh, I got really mad in that interaction.

2:09:03.380 --> 2:09:05.300
 Why did I get that mad?

2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:06.980
 Yeah, sure, maybe I could have been irritated,

2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:08.660
 but man, why did I?

2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:12.140
 And then thinking about it and realizing,

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:16.540
 okay, back up here, think about the broader context.

2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:23.140
 Think about how that relates to prior events in my life.

2:09:23.140 --> 2:09:25.940
 Okay, yeah, so this is a thing for me

2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:30.140
 when something of this class happens, then it triggers me.

2:09:30.140 --> 2:09:32.440
 So going forward, I'm gonna be aware of that.

2:09:33.980 --> 2:09:35.100
 And I've definitely used that

2:09:35.100 --> 2:09:40.100
 because you don't wanna be out of control of those emotions.

2:09:40.420 --> 2:09:41.460
 You wanna identify them.

2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:42.860
 You wanna know where they come from

2:09:42.860 --> 2:09:44.780
 and you wanna head them off

2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:48.300
 as a civilized human being living on this earth,

2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:50.060
 trying to get along with other people.

2:09:50.060 --> 2:09:51.980
 You wanna understand those moments.

2:09:51.980 --> 2:09:56.880
 Let me return to Robin Williams for a second

2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:00.820
 and looking at Robin Williams, the actor,

2:10:00.820 --> 2:10:03.140
 sorry, the human,

2:10:03.140 --> 2:10:06.320
 because you mentioned for depression,

2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:08.220
 you can have everything going well.

2:10:08.220 --> 2:10:12.940
 And I think there's just famous cases of just public figures

2:10:12.940 --> 2:10:15.120
 because a lot of people know them,

2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:19.700
 where they suffer quietly

2:10:19.700 --> 2:10:22.620
 and it seems like from the outside perspective

2:10:22.620 --> 2:10:24.820
 that they have everything going for them,

2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:27.180
 that they're at the top of their career.

2:10:27.180 --> 2:10:28.580
 Two people that come to mind

2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:32.300
 are Robin Williams and Anthony Bourdain.

2:10:32.300 --> 2:10:36.540
 What insight do you have in why either of those have taken,

2:10:36.540 --> 2:10:39.860
 why Robin Williams, a comedian,

2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:42.340
 one of sort of the most jolly humans?

2:10:42.340 --> 2:10:43.820
 Obviously, there was always the darkness

2:10:43.820 --> 2:10:48.820
 that he was channeling in order to present the happiness,

2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:53.180
 but it feels like that realness is only possible

2:10:53.180 --> 2:10:56.340
 when you're deeply self honest and analytical

2:10:56.340 --> 2:10:59.460
 and then if you're deeply self honest,

2:10:59.460 --> 2:11:00.920
 you're going to realize that there's a lot

2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:03.620
 of beautiful things about life that you can discover

2:11:03.620 --> 2:11:05.240
 and if you do that,

2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:07.820
 how can you possibly then take your own life?

2:11:07.820 --> 2:11:10.180
 I mean, you go through all of these thoughts

2:11:10.180 --> 2:11:15.180
 and I think a lot of people really loved Robin Williams,

2:11:16.100 --> 2:11:18.020
 which is why it was really difficult to see

2:11:18.020 --> 2:11:21.420
 how can even him, how can even Robin Williams

2:11:21.420 --> 2:11:22.260
 take his own life?

2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:24.620
 So I don't know if there's something to be said

2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:25.960
 about the nature of depression

2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:27.780
 from just looking at his case.

2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:33.380
 I think the action of suicide is not well understood.

2:11:33.380 --> 2:11:35.540
 It doesn't always, although often,

2:11:35.540 --> 2:11:37.660
 is correlated with depression.

2:11:37.660 --> 2:11:40.420
 There are cases of suicide where there is not

2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:42.900
 clear depression, that's in the minority.

2:11:42.900 --> 2:11:44.260
 By the way, if I just,

2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:46.120
 because you said it so interesting,

2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:49.820
 action of suicide, because there's also thoughts of suicide

2:11:49.820 --> 2:11:54.580
 and probably those, they're probably somewhat understood,

2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:59.300
 but it's an interesting, because you can think of suicide,

2:11:59.300 --> 2:12:00.940
 if you have suicidal ideation,

2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:04.020
 you can think of that for so many reasons.

2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:04.940
 That's right.

2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:09.940
 And I mean, thoughts sometimes, like painful thoughts,

2:12:16.380 --> 2:12:19.260
 angry thoughts, or thoughts in general,

2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:21.340
 can be very different, like fantasies, for example.

2:12:21.340 --> 2:12:24.440
 You can fantasize, like sexual fantasies.

2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:28.480
 You can fantasize, I was just for humor's sake

2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:30.780
 wanted to mention stuff, but then people think I'm serious,

2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:32.380
 so I'm not gonna mention anything.

2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:34.900
 But sexual fantasies, and then there's,

2:12:34.900 --> 2:12:36.420
 I know there's people that have sexual fantasies

2:12:36.420 --> 2:12:38.580
 and they don't wanna actually do that in real life.

2:12:38.580 --> 2:12:41.400
 That sexual fantasy serves some kind of purpose

2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:44.340
 in imagination only, and in that same way,

2:12:44.340 --> 2:12:46.940
 suicide might serve a purpose in imagination only,

2:12:46.940 --> 2:12:48.800
 is very unlikely to lead to action.

2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:52.500
 And yet there's other thoughts that maybe are more amorphous

2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:55.320
 that do lead to action, and that leap,

2:12:56.300 --> 2:12:58.420
 yeah, that, oh boy, that's a fascinating,

2:12:58.420 --> 2:13:02.140
 and that's such a philosophically powerful thought

2:13:02.140 --> 2:13:05.680
 to not exist, like that question, that's the,

2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:08.680
 is it Sarcher or Camus, Camus?

2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:11.700
 Well, the myth is Sisyphus, Camus, who says,

2:13:11.700 --> 2:13:14.580
 like basic question of why live?

2:13:15.500 --> 2:13:16.500
 Good question.

2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:18.100
 Yeah, right.

2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:20.820
 So that's a great question, actually,

2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:22.860
 and there are other related questions.

2:13:22.860 --> 2:13:26.340
 Some people may have the thought of suicide

2:13:26.340 --> 2:13:31.340
 because there seems no point, there's no joy in life.

2:13:33.180 --> 2:13:36.780
 That's one reason that some people can put forward.

2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:39.900
 Sometimes there's an, it's not just the absence of joy,

2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:43.140
 there's an active pain, an active psychic pain

2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:46.540
 in some people, and that, the inescapability of that

2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:50.500
 is enough to drive the thoughts of suicide.

2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:53.260
 And then there are interpersonal and cultural reasons

2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:54.660
 as well that can show up.

2:13:54.660 --> 2:13:59.660
 But the act, this act of ending of the self is,

2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:02.500
 in all these cases, there's no real way to study this

2:14:02.500 --> 2:14:05.300
 in animals, no other animal as far as we know

2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:10.300
 that we can study has this concept of this is myself,

2:14:10.780 --> 2:14:13.620
 the situation is not tolerable, therefore,

2:14:13.620 --> 2:14:15.400
 I will end the self.

2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:16.780
 To our knowledge, this is not something

2:14:16.780 --> 2:14:18.740
 that can be studied in other animals.

2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:23.740
 So it remains this very poorly understood action.

2:14:26.260 --> 2:14:29.860
 And in predicting it, so what do we do as psychiatrists?

2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:30.700
 We have this challenge.

2:14:30.700 --> 2:14:33.980
 People come to the emergency room, they say they're suicidal

2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:35.380
 or their friends say they're suicidal

2:14:35.380 --> 2:14:39.060
 or they've taken some action that didn't lead to death.

2:14:40.220 --> 2:14:41.060
 What do we do?

2:14:41.060 --> 2:14:43.980
 Well, there's a whole range of options.

2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:46.120
 Was it a suicidal gesture in the sense

2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:51.120
 of not intending death or was the intent death?

2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:53.620
 And if it was the intent was death,

2:14:53.620 --> 2:14:54.440
 what were the reasons?

2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:55.500
 Are the reasons transient?

2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:56.980
 Are they gone now?

2:14:56.980 --> 2:15:00.220
 What's the probability that it'll be repeated?

2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:02.980
 So we do all these things just to decide

2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:04.300
 what sort of treatment should be carried out,

2:15:04.300 --> 2:15:09.060
 but nowhere is there a deep understanding of the biology,

2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:12.520
 of the cells and circuits and activity patterns

2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:16.860
 that underlie the action to end the self.

2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:21.700
 It's a very, it's this frustrating thing.

2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:26.460
 It's so timely, it's so common, it shows up in veterans,

2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:29.420
 it shows up in kids, it shows up in people

2:15:29.420 --> 2:15:33.580
 at every stage of life, and yet we're very bad

2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:36.380
 at understanding it and we're relatively poor

2:15:36.380 --> 2:15:40.820
 at predicting it and our tools are not very powerful.

2:15:40.820 --> 2:15:42.740
 We can put people in a locked unit,

2:15:42.740 --> 2:15:44.900
 we can give them care, therapy for a while.

2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:47.140
 At some point, we release them

2:15:47.140 --> 2:15:48.660
 and there's only so much we can do.

2:15:48.660 --> 2:15:50.860
 It's one of the most frustrating things,

2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:53.600
 the suffering that is linked to suicidality.

2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:56.700
 But it is a decision and it is an action

2:15:56.700 --> 2:15:58.380
 and if you look at optogenetics,

2:15:58.380 --> 2:16:01.780
 you should be able to one day sort of understand

2:16:01.780 --> 2:16:05.460
 the dynamics of such weighty decisions.

2:16:05.460 --> 2:16:07.600
 The individual causes then, if someone is anhedonic,

2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:11.300
 if there is no joy in life, that very likely

2:16:11.300 --> 2:16:12.740
 is addressable by optogenetics.

2:16:12.740 --> 2:16:16.880
 We know how to turn that dial very robustly in animals.

2:16:17.780 --> 2:16:20.660
 The motivation to overcome challenges,

2:16:20.660 --> 2:16:24.940
 that we have some hope of understanding.

2:16:25.780 --> 2:16:28.380
 Psychic pain, internal negative states,

2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.360
 we have actually a handle on that as well.

2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:32.980
 There's a structure in the brain called the habenula

2:16:32.980 --> 2:16:35.440
 and some linked structures around it

2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:39.100
 that seems to generate this negative internal state.

2:16:39.100 --> 2:16:42.500
 It's active when a state of acute disappointment,

2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:47.280
 acute outcomes that go wrong, not as expected.

2:16:49.940 --> 2:16:52.240
 Moments of unexpected pain.

2:16:52.240 --> 2:16:54.220
 The habenula is there, it seems,

2:16:54.220 --> 2:16:59.100
 it's active to report on internal negativity

2:16:59.100 --> 2:17:00.940
 with its action.

2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:02.680
 And so you could imagine strategies

2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:03.900
 to target this brain structure

2:17:03.900 --> 2:17:07.260
 that might have the effect of reducing psychic pain,

2:17:07.260 --> 2:17:09.760
 reducing the negativity of internal states.

2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:11.940
 That is a very concrete hope.

2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:14.180
 It's precise, it's anatomical.

2:17:14.180 --> 2:17:17.420
 Optogenetics has given us all the firm foundation we need

2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:19.740
 to go after that question.

2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:21.460
 So I think there is hope.

2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:22.960
 If you look at the individual causes,

2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:25.940
 the individual symptoms relating to suicide,

2:17:25.940 --> 2:17:26.980
 and then it's like a puzzle,

2:17:26.980 --> 2:17:29.340
 you put together the puzzle pieces.

2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:33.940
 By the way, I do think my habenula is

2:17:34.940 --> 2:17:37.420
 very functioning, very actively.

2:17:37.420 --> 2:17:39.940
 And I wonder if it's like,

2:17:39.940 --> 2:17:43.180
 because you can also learn to channel these things, right?

2:17:43.180 --> 2:17:45.940
 Some of the things we suffer from,

2:17:45.940 --> 2:17:48.220
 I mean, there's degrees of suffering,

2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:53.220
 can be a source of progress and personal growth

2:17:54.580 --> 2:17:57.020
 and development and all those kinds of things.

2:17:57.020 --> 2:18:01.140
 I mean, I, what is it?

2:18:01.140 --> 2:18:05.000
 Nietzsche suffered from stomach issues.

2:18:07.300 --> 2:18:09.140
 I wonder if he's written some of those things

2:18:09.140 --> 2:18:11.580
 if his stomach was all great.

2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:15.260
 I mean, there's, I kind of think that

2:18:18.060 --> 2:18:19.460
 a difficult life in some form,

2:18:19.460 --> 2:18:21.740
 you can get, you get to choose in some regard

2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:22.820
 and some of you don't.

2:18:22.820 --> 2:18:25.340
 The difficulties you have and the ones you do have,

2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:27.420
 it's nice to use if possible.

2:18:27.420 --> 2:18:28.760
 Sometimes it's nice to treat,

2:18:28.760 --> 2:18:31.460
 sometimes it's nice to use.

2:18:31.460 --> 2:18:33.580
 Well, the way you phrase it, I think you're using it.

2:18:33.580 --> 2:18:35.780
 I could be wrong, but if you,

2:18:35.780 --> 2:18:39.180
 you phrased in this semi humorous way about your habenula,

2:18:39.180 --> 2:18:43.780
 it seems to me that you're using that to good effect.

2:18:43.780 --> 2:18:46.300
 Now, but one never really knows

2:18:46.300 --> 2:18:48.100
 what someone else's internal state is.

2:18:48.100 --> 2:18:51.860
 As I look at you, I don't know the depths of what's going on

2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:56.780
 and it's possible that it's a much harder situation

2:18:56.780 --> 2:18:57.820
 in there.

2:18:57.820 --> 2:18:58.700
 Yes.

2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:00.400
 So that's, I actually worry about this a lot.

2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:02.120
 So I'm extremely self critical,

2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:04.420
 like in the privacy of my own mind,

2:19:04.420 --> 2:19:05.900
 which is an interesting thing

2:19:05.900 --> 2:19:07.780
 when you get to meet the internet

2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:09.960
 and the internet will tell you you suck.

2:19:11.580 --> 2:19:15.100
 But for now, now this is what I worry about

2:19:15.100 --> 2:19:16.820
 and I'm very paying attention.

2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:19.280
 For now it's really, I just have this like very negative

2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:23.620
 voice, but that voice seems to be very useful

2:19:23.620 --> 2:19:26.320
 for productivity and so I channel it.

2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:29.060
 I just put it on the table and let that voice like

2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:33.980
 talk to me, but I'm very, I'm like monitoring that voice

2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:35.780
 because looking at Robin Williams, you know,

2:19:35.780 --> 2:19:38.940
 you get older, your brain changes or like you're,

2:19:38.940 --> 2:19:43.540
 and then that voice can now all of a sudden grow, right?

2:19:43.540 --> 2:19:45.260
 And then where you can't control as much,

2:19:45.260 --> 2:19:47.900
 you have to be very careful with these kinds of things.

2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:50.180
 You're very right about that.

2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:53.060
 So my negativity, I have this,

2:19:53.060 --> 2:19:56.020
 I never think I've done enough is sort of where my

2:19:56.020 --> 2:19:57.460
 negativity comes from inside.

2:19:57.460 --> 2:20:02.460
 I never think that I've met the potential of the moment.

2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:07.420
 I haven't done, I haven't, you know,

2:20:08.780 --> 2:20:12.180
 made the most of the opportunities that are available.

2:20:12.180 --> 2:20:15.100
 Still early, I haven't, you know,

2:20:15.100 --> 2:20:16.660
 progressed as far as I should.

2:20:16.660 --> 2:20:20.940
 And exactly as you're saying, that works for a while.

2:20:20.940 --> 2:20:23.660
 But then what happens as you get later in life

2:20:23.660 --> 2:20:28.660
 and there's less runway to, you know, fix that.

2:20:28.940 --> 2:20:33.020
 And then maybe then that negative voice is a problem.

2:20:33.020 --> 2:20:34.940
 But also at that point, the negative voice

2:20:34.940 --> 2:20:36.820
 starts having more and more of a point.

2:20:36.820 --> 2:20:39.900
 When you're being very successful,

2:20:39.900 --> 2:20:42.160
 it's easy to be like, no, okay, well,

2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:46.100
 like because later in life, you're really literally

2:20:46.100 --> 2:20:49.700
 just sitting there on a rocking chair doing nothing.

2:20:49.700 --> 2:20:53.640
 And then it's, or maybe any kind of tragedy happens.

2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.140
 Loss of a loved one, loss of a job,

2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:01.480
 loss or you get screwed over in some kind of way.

2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:02.540
 I don't know.

2:21:02.540 --> 2:21:04.180
 And then all of a sudden the negative voice

2:21:04.180 --> 2:21:05.660
 is just you and the negative voice

2:21:05.660 --> 2:21:07.940
 for days and days and days.

2:21:07.940 --> 2:21:10.380
 And so I don't know, to go back to your example

2:21:10.380 --> 2:21:13.420
 of Robin Williams, I don't know what was going on inside him.

2:21:13.420 --> 2:21:15.460
 I don't know the nature of his internal state.

2:21:15.460 --> 2:21:18.540
 Was it active psychic pain that?

2:21:18.540 --> 2:21:20.240
 May I mention, may I interrupt to just say

2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:23.580
 that Sergei posted an examination of Robin Williams.

2:21:23.580 --> 2:21:27.380
 His brain tissue suggested that he suffered from quote,

2:21:27.380 --> 2:21:32.380
 diffuse LEWY, Lewy body dementia, LBD.

2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:38.300
 Depression is a symptom of LBD and it's not about psychology.

2:21:38.300 --> 2:21:40.460
 It's rooted in urology.

2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:42.020
 This is words from Sergei.

2:21:42.020 --> 2:21:43.660
 His brain was falling apart.

2:21:43.660 --> 2:21:45.340
 Yeah, Lewy body dementia.

2:21:45.340 --> 2:21:47.660
 This is a very interesting neurological disorder

2:21:47.660 --> 2:21:51.900
 where among other things, there's neuron death indeed.

2:21:51.900 --> 2:21:54.540
 So you've got frank neuron loss.

2:21:54.540 --> 2:21:58.280
 It's not just a matter of some longstanding psychic pain,

2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:00.940
 but you've got a progressive loss.

2:22:00.940 --> 2:22:03.020
 And so clearly you've got a situation

2:22:03.020 --> 2:22:04.500
 where he could have finally reached a point

2:22:04.500 --> 2:22:07.540
 where the balance that he'd worked out

2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:12.460
 between negativity and positivity was disrupted due to loss.

2:22:12.460 --> 2:22:15.140
 The wrong cells died, the wrong projections were cut.

2:22:15.140 --> 2:22:16.920
 By the Lewy body dementia.

2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:19.620
 Certainly dopamine neurons die in Lewy body dementia.

2:22:19.620 --> 2:22:23.440
 Those are neurons that give rise to much of the feelings

2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:27.380
 of reward and pleasure that we experience among other roles.

2:22:27.380 --> 2:22:30.700
 So clearly in his case, there could have been

2:22:30.700 --> 2:22:34.360
 a very concrete cellular neurological issue

2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:36.860
 that was progressive and pushed him to that point.

2:22:37.740 --> 2:22:41.720
 But were you about to make a point about broader

2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:45.020
 that if there is not a neurological degeneration?

2:22:45.020 --> 2:22:47.380
 Yeah, so in his case, not knowing that,

2:22:48.340 --> 2:22:49.660
 it could have been simply that,

2:22:49.660 --> 2:22:52.780
 let's say he had an internal psychic pain state

2:22:52.780 --> 2:22:56.660
 and he was in sort of a compensated mode

2:22:56.660 --> 2:22:58.740
 for much of his life, able to generate enough joy

2:22:58.740 --> 2:23:01.160
 from his comedy and his social interactions.

2:23:02.660 --> 2:23:06.860
 But eventually later in life, those things drop away,

2:23:06.860 --> 2:23:08.180
 the balance shifts.

2:23:08.180 --> 2:23:10.780
 You get tired of fighting the pain for that long.

2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:14.160
 So you've got this time dependent non stationarity

2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:18.260
 that happens and then the same symptom

2:23:18.260 --> 2:23:20.260
 becomes no longer tolerable in the end.

2:23:21.180 --> 2:23:22.660
 What is autism?

2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:24.300
 What do we know about autism?

2:23:25.420 --> 2:23:30.420
 Human beings exist on a spectrum of how social we can be.

2:23:30.700 --> 2:23:34.640
 And this is pretty interesting actually, scientifically,

2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:38.240
 but also very important clinically.

2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:40.420
 There are hyper social states where people

2:23:40.420 --> 2:23:42.800
 are almost too social.

2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:44.740
 There are chromosomal deletion states

2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:47.740
 where people have instant affinity and bonding

2:23:47.740 --> 2:23:52.740
 and rich deep seeming connections with people, very verbal.

2:23:52.740 --> 2:23:57.620
 On the other end, people with autism spectrum disorder

2:23:57.620 --> 2:24:02.620
 are not able to keep up with social interactions

2:24:05.300 --> 2:24:06.540
 and it's a spectrum.

2:24:06.540 --> 2:24:09.500
 Some have mild to moderate difficulties.

2:24:09.500 --> 2:24:13.800
 They may have inability to understand

2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:16.140
 what the next thing to do in a social situation is,

2:24:16.140 --> 2:24:18.980
 but may have perfectly good language abilities.

2:24:19.820 --> 2:24:21.860
 And as you progress further along the spectrum,

2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:23.180
 that gets more and more severe

2:24:23.180 --> 2:24:28.100
 so they can't make eye contact because it's too overwhelming

2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:29.780
 to think about what has to be done next

2:24:29.780 --> 2:24:32.260
 if a person looks in a particular way.

2:24:32.260 --> 2:24:33.460
 And then as you go farther,

2:24:33.460 --> 2:24:38.020
 then language and social communication themselves break down

2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:41.980
 so there's no reciprocity, there's no shared enjoyment.

2:24:41.980 --> 2:24:43.500
 And that this gets very hard then

2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:45.340
 as you get to this far end of the spectrum

2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:50.060
 where there's really an absence of social cognition at all

2:24:50.060 --> 2:24:52.820
 and social bonding.

2:24:52.820 --> 2:24:54.580
 So why does this exist?

2:24:54.580 --> 2:24:55.620
 What is it?

2:24:55.620 --> 2:24:56.860
 It's very genetic.

2:24:56.860 --> 2:25:00.020
 As I mentioned, it's one of the top three or four

2:25:00.020 --> 2:25:03.820
 most biological in the sense of most genetically determined

2:25:03.820 --> 2:25:05.400
 of the psychiatric illnesses.

2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:08.020
 It does have these interesting positive correlations,

2:25:08.020 --> 2:25:09.240
 slight positive correlations

2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:11.420
 with intelligence and education.

2:25:13.420 --> 2:25:16.140
 And the reason for that

2:25:16.140 --> 2:25:18.300
 is kind of interesting to think about.

2:25:18.300 --> 2:25:19.480
 Is there something good about it?

2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.020
 Just like, or at least with at least part of the spectrum,

2:25:23.020 --> 2:25:23.980
 is there something good about it?

2:25:23.980 --> 2:25:26.220
 Just as we were talking about for depression,

2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:27.460
 as you could say for mania,

2:25:27.460 --> 2:25:29.260
 as you could say for schizophrenia.

2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:33.660
 And here it's kind of interesting

2:25:33.660 --> 2:25:37.380
 to think about the underlying science

2:25:37.380 --> 2:25:40.200
 of what it means to be good at a social interaction.

2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:44.020
 Someone who's very good at a social interaction

2:25:44.020 --> 2:25:45.220
 is incredibly good at dealing

2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:48.420
 with unpredictable information,

2:25:48.420 --> 2:25:51.420
 is able to handle this torrent of information

2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:54.300
 coming through rapidly changing

2:25:56.020 --> 2:25:58.540
 model of the other person and of the interaction

2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:02.540
 and their model of you, your model of them.

2:26:02.540 --> 2:26:03.940
 With each word that changes,

2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:05.580
 with each new bit of information

2:26:05.580 --> 2:26:06.940
 that comes in through the conversation,

2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:09.740
 each bit of body language, all this is rapidly changing.

2:26:09.740 --> 2:26:12.400
 And some people are able to keep up

2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.640
 with that firehose of information perfectly well.

2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:17.300
 But that's a special brain state to be in.

2:26:17.300 --> 2:26:20.420
 That's working with unpredictability.

2:26:20.420 --> 2:26:24.500
 That's the only way that can be done

2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:29.100
 is most likely by constantly running models

2:26:29.100 --> 2:26:32.200
 of what the other person might be about to say.

2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:34.360
 So you can't stop and think, oh, what did that word mean?

2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:37.660
 What did that shift in eye contact mean?

2:26:37.660 --> 2:26:38.800
 What do they mean together?

2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:41.180
 There has to be some advanced work going on

2:26:41.180 --> 2:26:42.440
 where you're predicting what's going on

2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:43.840
 if you're to keep up with a rich

2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:45.300
 and fast social interaction.

2:26:46.620 --> 2:26:51.620
 Now, on the flip side, there are brain states

2:26:51.700 --> 2:26:53.580
 that maybe don't have to work so fast

2:26:53.580 --> 2:26:54.940
 but that are extremely important still.

2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:57.100
 Dealing with something that's not moving

2:26:57.100 --> 2:27:00.220
 or that's predictable, still complex,

2:27:00.220 --> 2:27:05.220
 like mathematical proof or a very complex arrangement

2:27:05.500 --> 2:27:08.740
 of geometrical shapes, a large number

2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:11.100
 of individual nonmoving things.

2:27:11.100 --> 2:27:14.420
 There's possibly a way of being that's particularly good

2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:16.460
 at dealing with these static, unmoving,

2:27:16.460 --> 2:27:19.980
 or predictable situations and less so

2:27:19.980 --> 2:27:22.940
 with these rapidly changing social situations.

2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:25.940
 And so the way I conceptualize autism

2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:30.940
 is these are people whose brains are not so good

2:27:31.020 --> 2:27:34.500
 with the high bit rate, unpredictable information,

2:27:34.500 --> 2:27:38.060
 but may be quite good at given enough time,

2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:43.060
 given the grace to work with the system,

2:27:45.140 --> 2:27:46.980
 to look at it from different angles,

2:27:47.860 --> 2:27:49.740
 to take different perspectives with a confidence

2:27:49.740 --> 2:27:52.880
 that it's not changing in between perspectives.

2:27:53.980 --> 2:27:55.680
 That's a brain state that's valuable.

2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:59.540
 It's something that has probably contributed

2:27:59.540 --> 2:28:01.140
 to a lot of the success of the human family,

2:28:01.140 --> 2:28:02.340
 being able to design something,

2:28:02.340 --> 2:28:07.340
 being able to consider all the different contributions

2:28:09.060 --> 2:28:13.300
 to a static, predictable system.

2:28:13.300 --> 2:28:17.820
 So autism, in a sense, is a spectrum

2:28:17.820 --> 2:28:21.140
 that has identifiable characteristics

2:28:21.140 --> 2:28:25.100
 about the way people deal with dynamic information,

2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:29.100
 often expressed itself as like social dynamic information.

2:28:29.100 --> 2:28:31.180
 But you critically, your use of the word often there

2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:32.700
 is really, I think, smart,

2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:35.900
 because it's not just social interaction

2:28:35.900 --> 2:28:37.220
 that is a challenge in autism.

2:28:37.220 --> 2:28:39.980
 And so many people conceptualize it purely

2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:44.820
 as a social dysfunction disorder.

2:28:44.820 --> 2:28:47.560
 But it's really any unpredictable information

2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:49.500
 that's a problem, that's a challenge

2:28:49.500 --> 2:28:50.880
 for people on the spectrum.

2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:55.880
 They react very negatively to unexpected sounds,

2:28:56.260 --> 2:28:59.300
 even if not social sounds, unexpected lights,

2:28:59.300 --> 2:29:02.300
 unexpected touches, and so it's really

2:29:02.300 --> 2:29:05.060
 unpredictable information that is, in my view,

2:29:05.060 --> 2:29:08.380
 the core problem with the processing in autism,

2:29:08.380 --> 2:29:09.220
 not just social.

2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:11.500
 Social just shows up because it's so unpredictable.

2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:12.940
 Yeah, it's so interesting.

2:29:12.940 --> 2:29:16.780
 I mean, I try to not to think about that stuff.

2:29:16.780 --> 2:29:21.780
 I'm afraid of thinking about disorders

2:29:22.580 --> 2:29:25.440
 and things like that because just like I don't like

2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:28.500
 sort of economics or game theory,

2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:32.260
 I want to be careful with it because it,

2:29:32.260 --> 2:29:34.300
 whenever you have a category or a model,

2:29:34.300 --> 2:29:37.620
 it's too easy to just, for everything,

2:29:37.620 --> 2:29:39.400
 I mean, it's the OCD thing.

2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:40.860
 I like models too much.

2:29:40.860 --> 2:29:42.220
 I like categories too much.

2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:44.200
 The moment you acknowledge yourself,

2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:46.340
 well, I have an eating disorder, for example,

2:29:46.340 --> 2:29:49.180
 or something like that, as opposed to just being a,

2:29:49.180 --> 2:29:51.340
 well, I'll just leave it at that

2:29:51.340 --> 2:29:54.520
 from my own critical understanding of myself.

2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:56.940
 Let's just say I don't know how to moderate eating fruit.

2:29:56.940 --> 2:29:57.780
 People make fun of me.

2:29:57.780 --> 2:30:00.780
 They think all fruit is healthy.

2:30:00.780 --> 2:30:01.660
 I know.

2:30:03.100 --> 2:30:05.200
 I don't know how to moderate anything,

2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:10.200
 but even fruit, apples and cherries, is a nightmare.

2:30:10.260 --> 2:30:14.380
 Anyway, that's such a psychiatrist thing to say.

2:30:14.380 --> 2:30:15.220
 Very interesting.

2:30:15.220 --> 2:30:16.060
 Thank you.

2:30:18.340 --> 2:30:22.680
 But there's characteristics and it's interesting

2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:24.300
 to think about, like for example,

2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:26.580
 I have trouble making eye contact,

2:30:26.580 --> 2:30:29.020
 but I actually, as you said it now,

2:30:29.020 --> 2:30:34.020
 it's not that I'm shy at all in that sense.

2:30:35.140 --> 2:30:38.540
 It's literally, I'm getting way too much information

2:30:38.540 --> 2:30:40.180
 and it's distracting me.

2:30:40.180 --> 2:30:44.020
 Like I need to just close my eyes so I can,

2:30:44.020 --> 2:30:46.580
 like all the things that people seem to be able to do

2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:51.020
 in parallel, it's just, you just asked me a question.

2:30:51.020 --> 2:30:53.300
 For me to think about the answer to that question,

2:30:53.300 --> 2:30:56.120
 I can't have all this cool, rich visual information

2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:57.180
 coming my way.

2:30:57.180 --> 2:31:01.020
 That's literally, because I often close my eyes to think.

2:31:01.020 --> 2:31:04.060
 It's not because I'm afraid of something, whatever.

2:31:04.060 --> 2:31:06.940
 It's just like too much information happening here.

2:31:06.940 --> 2:31:08.980
 Well, that's a beautiful description.

2:31:08.980 --> 2:31:12.300
 It's amazing that that is how you experience

2:31:12.300 --> 2:31:15.620
 the eye contact aspect.

2:31:15.620 --> 2:31:18.340
 I think that's, I mean, you've articulated

2:31:18.340 --> 2:31:22.620
 what captures it for so many people,

2:31:22.620 --> 2:31:23.720
 which is that it's overwhelming.

2:31:23.720 --> 2:31:26.020
 There's just too much information just coming in

2:31:26.020 --> 2:31:30.740
 through the eyes and to keep up with it,

2:31:30.740 --> 2:31:33.460
 to know you're gonna be expected to keep up with it,

2:31:33.460 --> 2:31:35.140
 first of all, so there's that aspect.

2:31:35.140 --> 2:31:37.200
 You know, you've learned socially

2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:38.900
 that there's gonna be an expectation

2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:40.740
 if you're making eye contact.

2:31:40.740 --> 2:31:42.740
 People are gonna think you're keeping up with it,

2:31:42.740 --> 2:31:45.660
 and you don't want to because you wanna focus

2:31:45.660 --> 2:31:50.200
 on other things and make progress in other dimensions.

2:31:50.200 --> 2:31:52.220
 Yeah, and so then there's a strong desire

2:31:52.220 --> 2:31:53.580
 to look away or to close the eyes

2:31:53.580 --> 2:31:57.860
 because it's overwhelming, it's a distraction,

2:31:57.860 --> 2:32:00.180
 and it's gonna cause errors of understanding.

2:32:00.180 --> 2:32:02.020
 And of course, our eyes, that's part,

2:32:02.020 --> 2:32:04.540
 the way we use our eyes is part of the human communication,

2:32:04.540 --> 2:32:07.180
 so you have to kind of be aware of that,

2:32:07.180 --> 2:32:10.580
 of that element of it.

2:32:10.580 --> 2:32:12.140
 So yeah, I mean, but it's fascinating.

2:32:12.140 --> 2:32:13.940
 You should be aware of your own self

2:32:13.940 --> 2:32:16.180
 in those little characteristics,

2:32:16.180 --> 2:32:19.580
 whether it's classified on some aspect

2:32:19.580 --> 2:32:22.860
 of the autism spectrum or just in general,

2:32:22.860 --> 2:32:26.220
 whether it's eating, whether it's depression,

2:32:26.220 --> 2:32:29.180
 whether it's even like schizophrenia

2:32:29.180 --> 2:32:32.980
 that I hope we get a chance to talk to a little bit.

2:32:32.980 --> 2:32:35.420
 Yeah, but those things are all made up

2:32:35.420 --> 2:32:40.100
 of different symptoms and characteristics,

2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:43.380
 and use them as a superpower, I suppose,

2:32:43.380 --> 2:32:47.900
 is the best we can hope for in mild cases, I guess.

2:32:47.900 --> 2:32:50.300
 I do think both brain states can't coexist

2:32:50.300 --> 2:32:51.140
 at the same time.

2:32:51.140 --> 2:32:52.820
 The way of dealing with something unpredictable

2:32:52.820 --> 2:32:55.140
 and dealing with something predictable,

2:32:55.140 --> 2:32:56.500
 those are different ways of being,

2:32:56.500 --> 2:33:01.100
 here's a huge opportunity for very creative

2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:04.540
 model building in theoretical neuroscience

2:33:04.540 --> 2:33:07.180
 and linking that to these data streams

2:33:07.180 --> 2:33:11.060
 we're getting across the brain that we talked about earlier,

2:33:11.060 --> 2:33:13.660
 these immense data sets of activity across the brain.

2:33:15.300 --> 2:33:17.300
 Here's where I think there could be

2:33:17.300 --> 2:33:19.860
 a real convergence of theoreticians and experimentalists

2:33:19.860 --> 2:33:23.100
 to say, okay, given what we know about wiring of the brain,

2:33:24.420 --> 2:33:27.900
 here is what the brain state is likely to be

2:33:27.900 --> 2:33:30.980
 that deals well with unpredictable information,

2:33:30.980 --> 2:33:31.860
 and here's the brain state

2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:33.740
 that deals with predictable information.

2:33:33.740 --> 2:33:36.580
 Here's why they're incompatible, at least at the same time.

2:33:36.580 --> 2:33:39.100
 Here's why you've gotta be able to detect

2:33:39.100 --> 2:33:40.140
 which state you should be in.

2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:42.140
 Here's how you could switch between them.

2:33:42.140 --> 2:33:44.700
 Here's the kind of cells that you would predict,

2:33:44.700 --> 2:33:46.540
 almost like predicting the Higgs boson.

2:33:46.540 --> 2:33:49.540
 Here's the kind of circuitry that I would predict

2:33:49.540 --> 2:33:51.820
 should govern the switching,

2:33:51.820 --> 2:33:56.460
 or might make one state too sticky, too hard to get out of.

2:33:58.300 --> 2:34:01.100
 That is a huge opportunity for an interaction

2:34:01.100 --> 2:34:04.300
 from the theoretical and experimental side together.

2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:07.900
 Make one state too sticky.

2:34:07.900 --> 2:34:12.580
 The sort of measure the stickiness of the state

2:34:12.580 --> 2:34:14.980
 and how to lessen the stickiness.

2:34:14.980 --> 2:34:16.500
 Get some oil in the machine.

2:34:16.500 --> 2:34:19.460
 Yes, yeah, what would predict the kind of oil

2:34:19.460 --> 2:34:20.500
 that would work well.

2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:26.900
 What, in your practice, is treatment or advice

2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:31.340
 for the people on the autism spectrum?

2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:34.460
 So right now, there's no real medical treatment.

2:34:34.460 --> 2:34:36.580
 There are behavioral treatments

2:34:36.580 --> 2:34:38.860
 that are most effective early in life.

2:34:38.860 --> 2:34:42.140
 They make sure people don't fall too far behind.

2:34:42.140 --> 2:34:43.780
 If you're not interacting socially,

2:34:43.780 --> 2:34:46.900
 you create this vicious cycle

2:34:46.900 --> 2:34:48.580
 where you fall farther and farther behind

2:34:48.580 --> 2:34:49.700
 because you're not interacting.

2:34:49.700 --> 2:34:52.700
 And these therapies which are applied early in life,

2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:54.380
 therapists work with the kids,

2:34:55.860 --> 2:34:57.860
 train them to deal with these things

2:34:57.860 --> 2:34:59.860
 that otherwise would be aversive to them,

2:34:59.860 --> 2:35:02.660
 teach them how to predict things and interact,

2:35:02.660 --> 2:35:04.820
 and that has a big effect.

2:35:04.820 --> 2:35:06.820
 But it's behavioral therapy.

2:35:06.820 --> 2:35:08.820
 There's no medicine that works.

2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:12.020
 There are ways of reducing individual symptoms though

2:35:12.020 --> 2:35:13.980
 that sometimes come along with autism

2:35:13.980 --> 2:35:15.700
 and those do respond to medications.

2:35:15.700 --> 2:35:18.660
 So you can, one thing, very often,

2:35:18.660 --> 2:35:21.380
 my patients with autism are very anxious

2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:23.820
 because they live in a world

2:35:23.820 --> 2:35:25.500
 that they have a really hard time

2:35:25.500 --> 2:35:26.540
 predicting what's gonna happen.

2:35:26.540 --> 2:35:29.380
 And so they find, and some of these are high functioning,

2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:33.820
 Silicon Valley types who they may make great livings

2:35:33.820 --> 2:35:37.180
 but they're very unhappy because they're on the spectrum.

2:35:38.100 --> 2:35:43.100
 They don't understand how social interactions really work.

2:35:43.220 --> 2:35:46.180
 They're very anxiety provoking

2:35:46.180 --> 2:35:47.180
 because they don't know what to say.

2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:50.900
 They don't have any clue how anybody else knows what to say.

2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:52.700
 They're constantly worried they're gonna say something

2:35:52.700 --> 2:35:54.540
 that's completely inappropriate

2:35:54.540 --> 2:35:55.580
 and so they're very anxious.

2:35:55.580 --> 2:35:57.420
 And I can treat their anxiety.

2:35:57.420 --> 2:35:59.700
 It doesn't touch the autism per se

2:35:59.700 --> 2:36:01.620
 but I can help them with their anxiety.

2:36:02.500 --> 2:36:04.340
 What I just talked about, eye contact.

2:36:05.220 --> 2:36:08.260
 I am richly, even with eyes closed

2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:09.340
 and all those kinds of things,

2:36:09.340 --> 2:36:12.220
 I'm richly experiencing the world.

2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:14.420
 And it's not like you're afraid of the world

2:36:14.420 --> 2:36:16.100
 or you're not able, I don't know what to do.

2:36:16.100 --> 2:36:17.420
 No, I know everything.

2:36:17.420 --> 2:36:19.140
 In fact, I know way too much.

2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:20.820
 There's so many cool options.

2:36:20.820 --> 2:36:24.540
 Like at any one moment, there's all the stuff happening

2:36:24.540 --> 2:36:26.180
 and it's all beautiful.

2:36:26.180 --> 2:36:28.620
 And at any one moment, you can do anything you want.

2:36:28.620 --> 2:36:29.780
 You can take off your clothes.

2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:31.740
 You can punch that guy over there.

2:36:31.740 --> 2:36:33.820
 You can run away.

2:36:33.820 --> 2:36:35.820
 You can go in for a hug.

2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:38.380
 You can say something profound and deep

2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:39.980
 or you can say something generic

2:36:39.980 --> 2:36:42.260
 or you can do so many things you can say.

2:36:42.260 --> 2:36:46.380
 And then it'll go, it'll unravel in all these kinds of ways

2:36:46.380 --> 2:36:48.900
 and this moment could be completely life changing

2:36:48.900 --> 2:36:51.300
 or it can be mundane and meaningless.

2:36:51.300 --> 2:36:54.540
 And all of those options are before you at any one moment.

2:36:54.540 --> 2:36:59.540
 And so it's like, it's amazing and overwhelming

2:36:59.820 --> 2:37:02.100
 if you allow yourself to think about it,

2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:04.660
 which whatever, exactly.

2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:06.340
 Like, well, I'm fortunate with chess,

2:37:06.340 --> 2:37:08.460
 you have a few set options.

2:37:08.460 --> 2:37:11.860
 Two dimensional, at least dimensional is constraints.

2:37:11.860 --> 2:37:15.140
 There is unlimited possibilities

2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:18.420
 and unlimited beautiful things happening all around you.

2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:20.540
 So I don't think there's a kind of sense

2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:25.540
 that somehow you're limited in the places of,

2:37:28.140 --> 2:37:29.820
 in the way you can see the world

2:37:29.820 --> 2:37:31.860
 and how you can interact with that world.

2:37:31.860 --> 2:37:35.400
 I am overwhelmed by the lack of limit.

2:37:36.300 --> 2:37:38.540
 That all of us should be, have you looked around?

2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:40.180
 You can do whatever the hell you want.

2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:42.180
 Nobody will remember you anyway.

2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:44.100
 All of us will be dead one day.

2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:45.820
 You could do anything.

2:37:45.820 --> 2:37:49.700
 You can, I don't know, you can get naked

2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:50.900
 and run around the city,

2:37:50.900 --> 2:37:52.700
 as long as you're not hurting anybody,

2:37:52.700 --> 2:37:54.580
 and it doesn't matter.

2:37:54.580 --> 2:37:55.580
 So it's Austin, anyway.

2:37:55.580 --> 2:37:59.060
 Austin, yeah, exactly.

2:37:59.060 --> 2:38:03.100
 Seems like a to do item for anybody living in Austin,

2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:04.540
 for sure.

2:38:04.540 --> 2:38:07.220
 But the spectrum is an interesting concept

2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:10.420
 because that is, when I say,

2:38:10.420 --> 2:38:12.460
 when I refer to the spectrum,

2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:15.320
 I'm actually referring to, it's a precise clinical term,

2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:17.900
 but you're right, it's been coopted more broadly

2:38:17.900 --> 2:38:20.900
 and it is widely used and it can be

2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:22.500
 an unfair categorization of someone

2:38:22.500 --> 2:38:25.860
 who's socially and occupationally very healthy.

2:38:25.860 --> 2:38:28.140
 And that is critical

2:38:29.740 --> 2:38:32.260
 because we don't define a disorder

2:38:32.260 --> 2:38:34.740
 unless there's social or occupational dysfunction.

2:38:34.740 --> 2:38:36.820
 It doesn't matter what the symptoms are.

2:38:36.820 --> 2:38:39.740
 I've had patients who are pleasantly hallucinating,

2:38:39.740 --> 2:38:43.140
 so frankly, psychotic, but doesn't affect their lives,

2:38:43.140 --> 2:38:46.400
 so I don't give that person a diagnosis

2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:49.980
 because there's not social or occupational dysfunction.

2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:53.620
 Same with anything on this,

2:38:53.620 --> 2:38:57.320
 any of the diverse symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.

2:38:58.580 --> 2:38:59.980
 If someone has them,

2:38:59.980 --> 2:39:03.140
 but they're successful socially and occupationally,

2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:05.620
 we don't say that there's a disorder.

2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:07.700
 But then you're right, that the concept of the spectrum

2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:12.700
 does become a useful pigeonholing device,

2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:15.500
 which is maybe not the best thing.

2:39:15.500 --> 2:39:19.980
 Yeah, and the eye contact is an interesting one,

2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:21.180
 is an interesting one.

2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:22.260
 I'm torn on it.

2:39:23.780 --> 2:39:25.900
 I'm torn about the usefulness of eye contact

2:39:25.900 --> 2:39:27.460
 because people kind of make fun of it,

2:39:27.460 --> 2:39:31.660
 but let me just say one thing about eye contact

2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:33.180
 and about life in general.

2:39:33.180 --> 2:39:34.720
 It's okay to be weird,

2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:39.420
 but like some people, when you have your eyes closed

2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:41.740
 and there's that weird, what is happening to this creature?

2:39:41.740 --> 2:39:44.860
 Like you see a weird creature on the side of the road.

2:39:44.860 --> 2:39:46.340
 It's interesting.

2:39:46.340 --> 2:39:49.120
 And you wanna, I mean, the weird stuff,

2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.580
 I'm gonna go back to Robin Williams with the,

2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:53.780
 that's the good stuff, right?

2:39:53.780 --> 2:39:56.380
 He has that whole speech about him and his wife

2:39:56.380 --> 2:39:59.280
 and what he loves all the little peculiarities,

2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:00.180
 all the weird stuff.

2:40:00.180 --> 2:40:04.220
 And that, like let those flourish.

2:40:04.220 --> 2:40:06.420
 Let those, like celebrate those in yourself

2:40:06.420 --> 2:40:08.580
 and not in some kind of woke way,

2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:10.940
 but in some like very human way.

2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:13.060
 This is what makes us, this is the weirdness.

2:40:13.060 --> 2:40:17.380
 Yeah, I'm 100% on board with that.

2:40:17.380 --> 2:40:22.380
 And I don't think, you know, people who are happy

2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:27.140
 and who have people in their lives who are happy with them,

2:40:27.140 --> 2:40:30.500
 these are, I think, let the weirdness flourish.

2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:33.620
 Let the, all the different ways members

2:40:33.620 --> 2:40:35.220
 of the human family can be different.

2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:36.140
 Let's see them all.

2:40:36.140 --> 2:40:38.840
 That's one of our, that's one of the joys of being alive

2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:41.140
 is seeing all the ways we can be human.

2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:43.960
 And I think about it all the time.

2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:48.060
 Why do we have all these ways of being human?

2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:53.000
 And even within one individual,

2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:54.220
 you go through phases of life

2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:57.160
 where you express different sides of your way of being,

2:40:57.160 --> 2:40:59.280
 which is also a pretty fun opportunity, right?

2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.880
 You can go through phases where you're in one mode

2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:05.300
 and phases when you're in another mode.

2:41:05.300 --> 2:41:09.720
 And let that, you know, just let that flourish too.

2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:13.360
 Let the ways that you can be you vary as well.

2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:15.720
 I think that's important for people to explore.

2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.760
 And I should, like, as if you can address the internet,

2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:25.320
 but I would like to sort of ask the internet

2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:31.400
 to celebrate the weirdness of people.

2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:35.700
 Like, that's, it's the Robin Williams,

2:41:37.580 --> 2:41:39.160
 people call these imperfections,

2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:40.800
 but they're not, that's the good stuff.

2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:43.800
 For any one individual person,

2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:47.680
 find the weird stuff and celebrate it,

2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:50.480
 as opposed to what the internet often does,

2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:55.000
 which is find the weird stuff and criticize it.

2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.580
 Because when you criticize the weird stuff,

2:41:57.580 --> 2:42:01.700
 you're creating conformity, which is another human thing.

2:42:01.700 --> 2:42:05.700
 But that conformity creates a boring world.

2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:10.700
 You want the weird, you want the crazy.

2:42:10.780 --> 2:42:12.580
 That's what fun is made of.

2:42:12.580 --> 2:42:16.220
 That's the foundation of humor

2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:19.020
 and all of the ways in which we deal

2:42:19.020 --> 2:42:21.620
 with the suffering in the world,

2:42:21.620 --> 2:42:23.500
 with the injustices in the world,

2:42:23.500 --> 2:42:28.300
 is like this like huge variety of weird.

2:42:30.900 --> 2:42:32.600
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:34.980
 And that's what, at the depth of psychiatry,

2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:38.780
 is like you wanna acknowledge the weird,

2:42:38.780 --> 2:42:41.860
 celebrate the weird, like step around it

2:42:41.860 --> 2:42:44.980
 to find the particular aspects of weird

2:42:44.980 --> 2:42:47.260
 that are debilitating, like you said.

2:42:47.260 --> 2:42:49.620
 They're somehow negatively affecting your ability

2:42:49.620 --> 2:42:51.100
 to function in the world,

2:42:51.100 --> 2:42:54.700
 as opposed to trying to shut it all down.

2:42:54.700 --> 2:42:55.540
 That's right.

2:42:56.580 --> 2:42:58.420
 Well, on that topic, I mean,

2:42:58.420 --> 2:43:00.700
 I'd love to talk to you about schizophrenia.

2:43:00.700 --> 2:43:04.900
 What is schizophrenia?

2:43:04.900 --> 2:43:07.500
 From your research and from your general understanding,

2:43:07.500 --> 2:43:10.700
 and what is the full landscape of suffering

2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:15.000
 and wisdom that schizophrenia explores?

2:43:15.900 --> 2:43:19.420
 Schizophrenia is a state where

2:43:19.420 --> 2:43:22.300
 there is a break from reality.

2:43:22.300 --> 2:43:25.020
 And so this can show up, as we call them,

2:43:25.020 --> 2:43:27.700
 the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

2:43:27.700 --> 2:43:29.780
 These include hallucinations,

2:43:29.780 --> 2:43:32.020
 hearing something or seeing something that's not there,

2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:34.660
 usually auditory hallucinations.

2:43:34.660 --> 2:43:38.500
 Paranoia, people can have complex fears.

2:43:38.500 --> 2:43:41.200
 Delusions, which we call fixed false beliefs,

2:43:41.200 --> 2:43:43.380
 people get an extremely unshakable

2:43:43.380 --> 2:43:46.580
 but completely implausible idea about something.

2:43:46.580 --> 2:43:49.880
 Sometimes it relates to themself, sometimes to the world.

2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:51.500
 These we call the positive symptoms,

2:43:51.500 --> 2:43:53.260
 break from reality as we know it.

2:43:54.640 --> 2:43:57.020
 Then there are the negative symptoms that come with it,

2:43:57.020 --> 2:43:59.820
 and these are progressive.

2:43:59.820 --> 2:44:04.460
 These are flattening of emotion, as we call it,

2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:07.540
 so starting to express less and less positive emotion,

2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:12.040
 ending more in a neutral or flat state.

2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:16.520
 Thought disorder, inability to work with complex patterns

2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:19.580
 of planning or thinking, so you can't make plans,

2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:21.200
 you'd have poor working memory,

2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:25.420
 you can't keep track of where you were in a conversation,

2:44:25.420 --> 2:44:26.920
 in a sequence of actions.

2:44:27.820 --> 2:44:32.820
 So poor and impaired working with the thoughts of oneself

2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:37.980
 and then these positive symptoms of break from reality.

2:44:37.980 --> 2:44:41.100
 Okay, now why do these come together?

2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:44.060
 What's the neurobiology of it?

2:44:44.060 --> 2:44:45.380
 Again, we don't know.

2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:48.020
 Schizophrenia, extremely genetically determined.

2:44:48.020 --> 2:44:48.860
 If you look at the numbers,

2:44:48.860 --> 2:44:51.920
 could be upwards of 80% genetically determined.

2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:56.920
 1% of the human population around the world,

2:44:57.240 --> 2:44:58.840
 it's universal, okay?

2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:00.880
 It's not confined to any one culture,

2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:04.640
 not even really biased in one culture or another,

2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:06.200
 about 1% around the world.

2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:12.360
 And has this progressive quality to it, untreated,

2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:13.560
 so it's very interesting.

2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:17.080
 There's a break that happens, we call it first break,

2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:22.080
 when someone experiences their first disruption of reality,

2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:25.160
 they can have a completely typical life up until that point.

2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:28.200
 So you might have a, and I've seen just heartbreaking cases

2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:31.560
 of like this in the Stanford emergency room

2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:33.160
 where a kid has come there,

2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.660
 who's been extremely high functioning in that sense

2:45:37.660 --> 2:45:41.720
 of academic achievement and athletic and interpersonal,

2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:43.360
 and then comes to college.

2:45:43.360 --> 2:45:47.600
 Usually in men, it's around 18, 19 when the first break

2:45:47.600 --> 2:45:52.520
 happens, some terrifying paranoia hits

2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:55.240
 or some auditory hallucinations start.

2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:57.760
 They're getting screamed at by a voice in their head.

2:45:57.760 --> 2:45:59.520
 So devastating.

2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:02.800
 With women, comes on also often a little later,

2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:06.120
 sometimes in the 20s, and it can be progressive.

2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.640
 If it's not treated, it just progresses and progresses.

2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:14.120
 The voices become overwhelming, the delusions

2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:16.740
 and paranoia extend and expand.

2:46:16.740 --> 2:46:18.360
 The thought, the negative symptoms particularly

2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:20.360
 become more and more severe.

2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:23.120
 So one can't even maintain thoughts

2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:24.860
 in any sort of ordered fashion.

2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:30.040
 And then eventually, it can be fatal,

2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:33.720
 it can lead to suicide, it can lead to erratic behavior

2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:35.480
 that leads to accidents.

2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:38.840
 Now, it can be treated.

2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.200
 There are medications that help, fortunately.

2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:44.040
 They have side effects, so they're not perfect.

2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:49.040
 You can have movement problems and actually a whole host

2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:51.600
 of different side effects that come from the medications.

2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:55.160
 But we can help people now with schizophrenia

2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:56.580
 very, very significantly.

2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:00.460
 But the amazing thing, and this is emblematic

2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:03.260
 of where psychiatry stands, we don't have

2:47:03.260 --> 2:47:05.760
 the deep understanding, just like with depression,

2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.600
 we don't have that heart as a pump level of understanding

2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:11.440
 that we'd like to have with schizophrenia,

2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:15.360
 despite it being so biological, so genetic in its nature.

2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:20.360
 So is there a way to return to the other side

2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:22.360
 of the first break?

2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:24.040
 So when you have a break with reality,

2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:27.480
 is there a way to kind of stitch it together?

2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.360
 So some people, that works, but we don't really know how.

2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:36.120
 So medications, antipsychotic medications, we call them,

2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:39.220
 they block a particular neurotransmitter receptor

2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:44.240
 called the serotonin 2A receptor,

2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:46.440
 and they modulate dopamine as well

2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:48.280
 and other neurotransmitters.

2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:53.700
 These can take someone who's actively hallucinating,

2:47:53.700 --> 2:47:56.720
 actively paranoid, put them back in a completely normal

2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:01.280
 state, and some people stay that way indefinitely.

2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:04.240
 So you can bring people back from that,

2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:07.240
 back to the other side, have it stitched together.

2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:11.920
 More typically, you'll end up in some intermediate state

2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:15.440
 where symptoms are reduced powerfully,

2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:16.960
 but there might be still something there

2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:19.480
 and you've got a drop down in functioning

2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:22.020
 that may be persistent for a while.

2:48:22.020 --> 2:48:26.080
 But concepts, what physically is going on?

2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:31.080
 One idea is that it's communication within the brain.

2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:34.800
 One part of the brain is not able to tell

2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:36.400
 other parts of the brain what it's doing.

2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:38.020
 And so the auditory hallucinations

2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:40.240
 are very interesting in this regard.

2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:42.080
 They often have this conversational,

2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:44.280
 inner monologue like quality.

2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:45.440
 As we're walking along the street,

2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:47.180
 we may have an inner monologue,

2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:49.200
 thoughts about what's going on.

2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:50.680
 If we see somebody we don't like,

2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:52.080
 we may have a thought,

2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:54.160
 wish somebody would punch that guy, something like that,

2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:55.300
 or maybe I should punch that guy.

2:48:55.300 --> 2:48:59.920
 But these are so far below where we would ever act

2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:02.320
 or even think of acting,

2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:03.800
 but they're just things that come up.

2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:05.880
 And in people with schizophrenia,

2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:09.920
 those inner thoughts, that inner monologue,

2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:14.920
 is not recognized as the inner monologue of the self.

2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:19.960
 And so it's perceived as something coming from the outside

2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:23.360
 or from inside, but from another entity.

2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:26.000
 Another, oh, another, I thought you meant

2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:29.240
 like another room inside the same building.

2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:31.880
 Another room inside there, yeah.

2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:35.280
 And so that's, so it could be conceptualized

2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:38.320
 as a communication within the brain problem,

2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:40.880
 notifying another part of the brain what's going on.

2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:44.280
 And there's some evidence consistent with that.

2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:45.760
 I don't know if you can help with this,

2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:48.320
 but I sometimes, so I've been talking

2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:50.280
 to quite a few homeless folks recently,

2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:54.120
 just, so what I do is I hang out at night

2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:59.800
 and talk to interesting people.

2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:02.560
 And some of them, and I've known people in the past

2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:03.920
 who suffer from schizophrenia,

2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:07.040
 and some of them, like self, will describe

2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:11.360
 as that as something they suffer from.

2:50:12.440 --> 2:50:14.400
 And they seem to understand something deeply

2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:15.880
 about this world.

2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:17.960
 I don't know if it's correlated

2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:22.960
 or maybe it's another aspect of like depression,

2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:27.720
 all those things that I've encountered in my own life

2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:31.580
 is maybe just the struggle and the suffering

2:50:31.580 --> 2:50:33.180
 has taken you through a life

2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:35.280
 where you think deeply about life.

2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:37.500
 Like there's like self reflection

2:50:37.500 --> 2:50:39.520
 that society forces on you

2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:43.320
 because it's a disorder of some kind.

2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:46.240
 It's interesting, I guess my only sort

2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:48.480
 of anecdotal observation is people who suffer

2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:53.040
 from schizophrenia seem to be very interesting

2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:58.040
 and very thoughtful in a nonlinear way about the world.

2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:02.980
 I've noticed that it's not always positive.

2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:06.560
 There are unusual ways they view the world.

2:51:06.560 --> 2:51:10.000
 It was, but it's always interesting.

2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.680
 That could be conspiratorial thinking too.

2:51:12.680 --> 2:51:15.040
 Like, but like the theories they have

2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:17.080
 about the way the world functions,

2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:20.480
 often very well read, which is also interesting

2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:21.620
 because they're almost like looking

2:51:21.620 --> 2:51:23.640
 for helpful answers from somewhere.

2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:24.540
 Absolutely there.

2:51:24.540 --> 2:51:26.440
 And so they're, they might be citing

2:51:26.440 --> 2:51:27.920
 some very interesting literature

2:51:27.920 --> 2:51:32.760
 and then using that to, there's a stickiness

2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:34.800
 in their mind to different models of the world

2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:36.640
 and trying to make sense of that world.

2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:39.080
 And those models could include conspiracy theories.

2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:42.400
 Yeah, they're very attuned to complexity

2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:44.960
 and they come up with unlikely explanations,

2:51:46.180 --> 2:51:48.440
 which is one of the things that makes them,

2:51:48.440 --> 2:51:50.520
 it makes it hard for them to function in the world

2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:53.040
 is how unlikely their explanations are.

2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:55.800
 But you're right, there's a depth of consideration

2:51:55.800 --> 2:51:59.520
 of the complexity of the world and a concern about it

2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:04.640
 and a work, an impulse to work to understand it

2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:07.080
 that is actually quite refreshing.

2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:11.120
 But the first case in the medical literature,

2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:15.280
 there was a classical schizophrenia.

2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:17.880
 There was a patient named James Tilly Matthews

2:52:17.880 --> 2:52:22.380
 who had this, he sketched out for his doctor

2:52:22.380 --> 2:52:26.560
 the experiences he was sensing

2:52:26.560 --> 2:52:31.080
 and he drew himself as a cowering figure

2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:34.600
 on the ground controlled by a loom,

2:52:34.600 --> 2:52:37.840
 a weaving device that was sending threads,

2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:40.840
 long threads, projections across space

2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:44.080
 from the loom to him, to his arms and to his body

2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:46.800
 and controlling him from afar.

2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:51.720
 And he called this the air loom, a loom in the air.

2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:54.200
 And it was such an evocative thing

2:52:54.200 --> 2:52:56.640
 because this was the start of the Industrial Revolution

2:52:56.640 --> 2:53:01.280
 or mid and it was where really industrial strength,

2:53:01.280 --> 2:53:05.840
 looms and weaving devices were really kind of the emblematic

2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:10.280
 of the most complex, powerful technological achievements

2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:13.280
 of the time and so that was the explanation available

2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:18.040
 to him to explain how his body was seemingly moved

2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:22.040
 without his volition and these days, of course,

2:53:22.040 --> 2:53:25.040
 people with schizophrenia will have more technology

2:53:25.040 --> 2:53:29.020
 appropriate interpretations, they'll have delusions

2:53:29.020 --> 2:53:32.920
 of satellite or alien control or beamed information,

2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:35.060
 very, very common to have this delusion

2:53:35.060 --> 2:53:39.640
 of a government agency sending electromagnetic

2:53:39.640 --> 2:53:43.360
 or radio frequency information to control their limbs.

2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:45.760
 But it's the same thing, whether it's a thread

2:53:45.760 --> 2:53:48.280
 from an Industrial Revolution loom

2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:53.280
 or RF radiation, it's the same thing just adapted

2:53:53.480 --> 2:53:56.400
 to the moment explaining, trying to explain

2:53:56.400 --> 2:53:58.520
 the world they live in and their relationship to the world.

2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:01.160
 But unconstrained by sort of the thing

2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:02.720
 that's socially acceptable,

2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:05.320
 which is both refreshing and dangerous.

2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:06.160
 Yes.

2:54:08.640 --> 2:54:10.880
 I wrote down a question.

2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:12.000
 Why do we cry?

2:54:13.240 --> 2:54:15.200
 Are tears a window to some depths

2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:17.500
 that we ourselves don't know?

2:54:17.500 --> 2:54:19.620
 I almost wanna make fun of myself for that question,

2:54:19.620 --> 2:54:22.600
 but you do talk seriously about crying in the book.

2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:26.280
 In fact, the whole first chapter really tussles

2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:29.240
 with crying as why do we do it, what does it mean,

2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:31.000
 why is it involuntary?

2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:32.560
 It seems like a weakness, right?

2:54:32.560 --> 2:54:35.240
 Because it's so involuntary and it's reflecting

2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:36.740
 something true and inside.

2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:39.120
 At the level of the individual,

2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:40.480
 that seems like a problem, right?

2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:42.560
 Wouldn't it be better if we could control it,

2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:47.560
 if we could not show that emotion when it's not useful,

2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:49.480
 show it when it's useful?

2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:51.800
 But it's not, it's largely involuntary.

2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:55.540
 And so there's a value to it, I think,

2:54:55.540 --> 2:54:59.040
 as an honest reporter of a need,

2:54:59.040 --> 2:55:03.520
 of hope and frailty at the same time.

2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.520
 I am a human being, there's a frailty to myself

2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:12.280
 or my situation where I need social help,

2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:14.680
 I need help from my community.

2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:16.760
 I have hope that that is possible,

2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:21.520
 but I'm not enough for myself, I need the community.

2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:25.400
 That I think is what the social signal of crying is.

2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:29.280
 Now people have studied crying, it's an extreme,

2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:33.240
 you can quantify the extent to which the presence of tears

2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.920
 on a face triggers reactions in onlookers.

2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:41.040
 And you can show the same face in the presence

2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:44.320
 or absence of tears and show that to people

2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:49.320
 under quantifiable and rigorous psychological conditions.

2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:53.280
 And tears are much more powerful at stirring

2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:57.040
 the desire to help in viewers

2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:01.120
 than any other facial feature.

2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:04.000
 Which is pretty interesting that it's the honest one

2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:05.640
 that's also the most powerful, right?

2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:07.720
 It kind of indicates there's a certain logic

2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:11.240
 to our design as social beings

2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:13.680
 that we have an honest report.

2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:17.160
 That's hard to control.

2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:21.520
 But is it well understood how that connects

2:56:21.520 --> 2:56:26.360
 to the internal state of emotion?

2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:30.480
 Yeah, there are long range projections that come,

2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:31.840
 so where is crying generated?

2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:33.200
 This is the confusing thing about it.

2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:36.600
 So that we have a little tear duct, the lacrimal gland

2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:38.080
 that leads to the release of fluid,

2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:40.360
 it ejects fluid and it comes out.

2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:43.440
 And those of course, that whole system was designed

2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:47.040
 to keep the eye clean, to wash out particulate irritants.

2:56:47.040 --> 2:56:49.760
 So it's a long standing, as long as we've had eyes

2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:52.840
 and have been out of the water in our evolution,

2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:53.960
 we've needed this sort of thing.

2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:56.120
 So long standing biological structure,

2:56:56.120 --> 2:56:59.960
 recently co opted it seems by our evolution

2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:02.040
 as social primates.

2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:03.880
 Now, how could that happen?

2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:07.560
 Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures

2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:10.280
 in the pons, which is a structure deep in our,

2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:14.120
 just above our neck, between our neck and our head.

2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:16.760
 And reflecting its ancient origin, right?

2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:18.560
 As you go farther down toward the spinal cord,

2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:21.840
 these are the more basic early evolved structures.

2:57:21.840 --> 2:57:25.240
 And in the pons, that's where breathing is controlled,

2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:30.240
 tear duct contraction.

2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.000
 And what we found and with optogenetics,

2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:35.360
 we helped sort this out,

2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:36.760
 there are long range projections

2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:40.960
 from fear and anxiety regions in the forebrain

2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:43.360
 that project all the way to the pons

2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:45.360
 in and around those areas.

2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:47.280
 The reason those are there,

2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:50.720
 we think is to regulate the respiratory rate changes,

2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:52.960
 the breathing changes of fear and anxiety.

2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:55.720
 So we know when we're in a state of fear and anxiety,

2:57:55.720 --> 2:57:58.840
 we need, we cope better if we have elevated heart rate,

2:57:58.840 --> 2:58:01.480
 elevated respiratory rate, more blood pumping around,

2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:02.440
 more oxygenated blood,

2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:05.040
 we're ready to meet the threat if it happens.

2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:07.480
 All those cells are down there in the pons too,

2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:12.480
 right next to the lacrimal duct, the tear gland neurons.

2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:17.480
 And so almost certainly this fear anxiety induced crying

2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:22.480
 arose from a very slightly misdirected long range projection

2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:27.520
 that was there to regulate breathing.

2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:29.800
 And a little twist, just a little misdirection,

2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:33.640
 a little missing of one sign post to stop here,

2:58:33.640 --> 2:58:35.320
 going on a little farther,

2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:38.920
 getting to the lacrimal gland neurons gave us crying.

2:58:38.920 --> 2:58:40.400
 And that's, and we just have it,

2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:43.680
 that peculiar sort of structure, neuronal structure

2:58:43.680 --> 2:58:46.680
 that resulted in that, that's what we're stuck with.

2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:50.000
 And that ends up being, in terms of social interaction,

2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.880
 one of the more important, authentic,

2:58:53.880 --> 2:58:57.040
 involuntary displays of interstate.

2:58:57.040 --> 2:58:57.880
 That's right.

2:58:57.880 --> 2:58:58.920
 And social communication.

2:58:58.920 --> 2:58:59.760
 Yeah.

2:58:59.760 --> 2:59:04.000
 Oh, yeah, is there other stuff like that?

2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:08.160
 I mean, do you, yeah, I mean, the human face is fascinating

2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:12.280
 as a display of emotion, as a display of truth and lying

2:59:12.280 --> 2:59:13.880
 and all those kinds of things.

2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:18.880
 I personally, I mean, we're all, I suppose,

2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:24.160
 have different sensors that are sensitive

2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:25.720
 to certain aspects of the human face.

2:59:25.720 --> 2:59:28.320
 But to me, it seems like the eyes

2:59:28.320 --> 2:59:31.240
 are really important communication or something.

2:59:31.240 --> 2:59:33.160
 You know, I've talked to a few sort of girls

2:59:33.160 --> 2:59:35.320
 about like Botox and stuff like that.

2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:37.560
 And it always bothers me when,

2:59:37.560 --> 2:59:38.800
 I guess guys can do this too,

2:59:38.800 --> 2:59:43.440
 but like when women speak negatively

2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:46.280
 of, I guess you can call them wrinkles,

2:59:46.280 --> 2:59:49.760
 at the tips of an eye.

2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:54.440
 But like to me, when you smile, when you wink,

2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:58.040
 not wink, but like narrow the eyes,

2:59:58.040 --> 3:00:00.320
 something is communicated and those,

3:00:00.320 --> 3:00:03.120
 that stuff is really useful, the human face.

3:00:03.120 --> 3:00:05.400
 And when it's gone, something is missing.

3:00:05.400 --> 3:00:08.560
 And a lot of little stuff, it feels like it really,

3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:10.680
 it's almost involuntary, I guess,

3:00:10.680 --> 3:00:12.860
 but it's harder to describe as the presence

3:00:12.860 --> 3:00:13.920
 or absence of tears.

3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:16.600
 It's like something about this person,

3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:18.840
 you can tell they're not bullshitting you.

3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:19.680
 Yeah, yeah.

3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:21.940
 And so that was what made, presumably,

3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:24.840
 that tear recruitment so powerful,

3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:28.420
 is it just landed in this very high value real estate

3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:29.780
 for social communication.

3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:31.640
 If it had gone to, you know,

3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:34.000
 there's a lot of neurons in the pons

3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:39.000
 that control movement of large muscles elsewhere,

3:00:40.180 --> 3:00:41.620
 that would have been much less effective

3:00:41.620 --> 3:00:43.440
 as a social signal than something around the eye.

3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:46.800
 So it was, however that little misdirection happened,

3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:50.420
 it landed in a great area for social communication.

3:00:50.420 --> 3:00:53.400
 And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits

3:00:53.400 --> 3:00:57.000
 that regulate that necessary involuntary change

3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.640
 in heart rate and respiratory rate,

3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:02.440
 it also was involuntary and that became valuable

3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:05.880
 as a truth signal, as social beings.

3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:08.480
 So very interesting when you think about

3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:09.680
 the origins of the human family,

3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:12.480
 the origins of social structures

3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:14.920
 and our ability and need to call for help

3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:18.080
 when there's hope, but need at the same time.

3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:23.080
 What is consciousness, Carl?

3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:26.560
 So you're actually using techniques.

3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.360
 I mean, even putting psychiatry aside,

3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:31.760
 just looking at optogenetics,

3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:34.440
 you're trying to understand some of these deep aspects

3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:36.040
 of the human mind.

3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:38.380
 And maybe this is a good time to return to a question

3:01:38.380 --> 3:01:41.160
 you mentioned you might have an opinion on

3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:43.260
 if there's such a thing as a theory of everything

3:01:43.260 --> 3:01:44.920
 for the human mind.

3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:47.800
 Because surely answering of what is consciousness

3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:50.920
 is as, well, that's not sure.

3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:53.480
 But it seems like it's a fundamental part

3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:56.160
 of the human experience in the human mind

3:01:56.160 --> 3:02:00.680
 and solving that question will result in solving

3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:02.620
 the bigger thing about the human mind.

3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:05.000
 The flip side could be consciousness

3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.680
 is just the few neurons that are generating

3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:10.080
 some useful thing that make us,

3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:12.920
 it's like the sense of self

3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:16.280
 that you talked about in the mice.

3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:18.620
 Maybe it's a subset of those cells

3:02:18.620 --> 3:02:21.080
 that are just creating a richer sense of self

3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:21.920
 and that's it.

3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:26.240
 So this is a great question.

3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:28.080
 All neuroscientists think about this

3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:29.840
 and a lot of non neuroscientists too.

3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:34.040
 It's the reason a lot of people came to the study

3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:36.080
 of the brain is to think about consciousness

3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.360
 and not just being awake or alert

3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:40.480
 but really what's sometimes called

3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:42.240
 the hard problem of consciousness

3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:45.880
 which is what is that nature of that inner

3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:47.800
 subjective sense we have?

3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:50.080
 Not just information processing

3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:54.960
 but feeling something about the information.

3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:59.120
 What is that inner state of subjectivity physically?

3:02:59.120 --> 3:02:59.960
 What is it?

3:03:00.880 --> 3:03:03.320
 And that's called the hard problem of consciousness

3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:08.320
 and it's not a extremely well defined question.

3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:11.340
 Everybody has sort of a sense of what it means

3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:14.200
 but it's such a hard problem

3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:17.120
 because you run into paradoxes quite quickly

3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:18.440
 the more you think about it

3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:21.800
 and that is exciting also

3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:23.320
 because it makes us think

3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:25.080
 actually there's some fundamental,

3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:28.120
 there's a big thing that we're missing.

3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:30.880
 The brain is not just a collection of little tricks.

3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:32.760
 There is a big, big concept.

3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:34.000
 So that's your sense of the big

3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:37.600
 because a flip side could be with optogenetics.

3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:40.320
 You can, there's an engineering question.

3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:43.920
 Can you turn consciousness on and off like a light switch?

3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:47.200
 Okay, so here's where exactly consciousness

3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:48.920
 frames the problem extremely well

3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:50.580
 and it frames it the following way.

3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:54.680
 So I told you earlier that we can stimulate

3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:59.600
 20 or 25 cells in the visual cortex of a mouse

3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:03.520
 and we can make it behave and we can make its brain act

3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:06.040
 as if it's seeing something that isn't there.

3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:07.240
 We have that level of control now.

3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:10.920
 We can pick out 25 neurons, play in activity

3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.080
 and both behavior and in the brain,

3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.120
 it's as if it's seeing something specific.

3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:18.600
 Okay, now let's do a thought experiment,

3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:21.840
 you know, a Gedanken experiment and let's play this out.

3:04:22.760 --> 3:04:24.380
 Let's say we could do the same thing

3:04:24.380 --> 3:04:27.880
 for every single neuron in the brain of a human being.

3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:30.120
 Let's say we had total control

3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:31.520
 and I could do something like,

3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:34.800
 I could show you a rich deep color red

3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:36.480
 and you could look at it and you would be aware

3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:38.240
 that it's red, but also you might have some feelings

3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:40.320
 about it, something would be stirred in you,

3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:43.400
 some subjective sense as you looked at that rich color red

3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:48.880
 and then I would take away the visual stimulus

3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:50.340
 and I would, in this thought experiment,

3:04:50.340 --> 3:04:53.300
 I would, using some hyperoptogenetics,

3:04:53.300 --> 3:04:57.000
 I would play in exactly the same pattern of activity

3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:00.360
 in every cell in your brain for as long as was needed,

3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:03.360
 whatever, 15 seconds, something like that,

3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:06.880
 that exactly matched what was going on

3:05:06.880 --> 3:05:10.320
 when you were feeling that inner subjective sense.

3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:12.160
 Okay, so in that thought experiment,

3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:16.320
 a question for you is would you be feeling

3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:18.080
 that same inner subjective sense?

3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:20.560
 Stimulus is gone, every neuron's doing the same thing

3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:21.960
 because I'm controlling it.

3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:25.800
 There's a philosophical question there.

3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:29.360
 If you ask me specifically, I would say yes.

3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:31.400
 Okay, good, most people would say that

3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:33.740
 because it's hard to say no, right?

3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:34.800
 It's very hard to say no.

3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:38.240
 If every cell in your brain is doing what it was doing,

3:05:38.240 --> 3:05:39.560
 what else could be different?

3:05:39.560 --> 3:05:42.720
 How could? Well, most normal people would say yes.

3:05:42.720 --> 3:05:46.320
 Of course, philosophers would then start saying no.

3:05:46.320 --> 3:05:48.240
 They're the ones that say,

3:05:50.460 --> 3:05:53.040
 I'm in sort of parallel and sorry

3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:54.240
 if it's a bit of an interruption,

3:05:54.240 --> 3:05:58.400
 but if there's a robot that's conscious in front of you,

3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:02.900
 if it appears conscious, then it's conscious.

3:06:02.900 --> 3:06:07.300
 Like to me, of course, philosophers again speak up

3:06:07.300 --> 3:06:10.040
 and say, well, no, how do you know it's conscious?

3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:12.360
 Well, how do you know anything is conscious?

3:06:12.360 --> 3:06:15.460
 And sort of as normal humans,

3:06:15.460 --> 3:06:19.160
 we tend to lean on the experience

3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:22.640
 versus some kind of philosophical concept.

3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:25.320
 So the great thing about what you just said,

3:06:25.320 --> 3:06:28.400
 the Turing test is it's very practical.

3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:31.000
 If it acts conscious, it is conscious.

3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:32.880
 But I think that's limiting.

3:06:32.880 --> 3:06:34.760
 I like the thought experiment.

3:06:34.760 --> 3:06:36.240
 I think it's actually more informative.

3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:39.760
 And so I'm halfway to the conclusion there,

3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:43.240
 but let's take it as your answer was yes,

3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:44.920
 that you would be feeling the same thing.

3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:47.120
 Okay, now here's where it gets fun.

3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:52.120
 Now that every cell in your brain knows what it has to do

3:06:55.480 --> 3:06:58.080
 in the sense that we know it and we're providing it,

3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:02.600
 your brain cells don't need to be in your head

3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:04.680
 anymore at all, right?

3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:06.440
 The only reason they're next to each other,

3:07:06.440 --> 3:07:08.120
 the only reason they're wired together

3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:12.200
 is to affect each other, to stimulate or inhibit each other.

3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:13.580
 But we don't need that anymore

3:07:13.580 --> 3:07:15.280
 because optogenetically,

3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:17.280
 we're providing that activity pattern

3:07:17.280 --> 3:07:18.120
 for as long as needed.

3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:20.000
 We're providing the effect of the communication.

3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:22.600
 They don't need to be connected anymore.

3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:24.480
 They don't even need to be in your head.

3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:28.040
 I could spread your neurons all over the continent,

3:07:28.040 --> 3:07:29.200
 all over the galaxy,

3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:34.040
 and I could still provide the same stimulus pattern

3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:36.760
 over 10 or 15 seconds to all those neurons.

3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:41.560
 And somewhere Lex Friedman would have to be,

3:07:41.560 --> 3:07:45.280
 even though no longer existing as a physical object anymore,

3:07:45.280 --> 3:07:48.240
 would be feeling that subjective feeling.

3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:49.080
 And it's inescapable

3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:52.040
 because it's exactly the same as the previous situation.

3:07:52.040 --> 3:07:54.360
 All the neurons have to be spatially,

3:07:55.320 --> 3:07:56.840
 like the locality constraint,

3:07:56.840 --> 3:07:58.920
 they have to be spatially close to each other.

3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:03.680
 And you talk about light opto,

3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:08.680
 which is funny because light is the fastest traveling thing

3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:10.320
 that we know of.

3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:13.080
 Maybe let's not put them all over the universe

3:08:13.080 --> 3:08:14.680
 because we might get relativistic problems then.

3:08:14.680 --> 3:08:15.800
 Let's just keep them out.

3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:17.000
 Let's keep all your neurons.

3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.240
 Let's spread them over North America, okay?

3:08:19.240 --> 3:08:22.720
 And let's play them out, same pattern of activity.

3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:24.200
 And right, it seems absurd, right?

3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:25.960
 There's no way that could be true.

3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:28.720
 There's no way that Lex would be feeling

3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:29.760
 that internal sense

3:08:29.760 --> 3:08:32.800
 if his neurons were spread all over North America.

3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:35.200
 And yet it's exactly the same as the previous situation

3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:37.000
 where you said, sure.

3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:38.000
 So we've got a paradox.

3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:39.320
 And this is what makes people think.

3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:40.880
 Is it a paradox though, sorry?

3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:42.600
 Well, maybe paradox is the wrong word.

3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:44.000
 We got a problem.

3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:46.120
 We got a problem because it reveals

3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:49.840
 that there's something big about those,

3:08:49.840 --> 3:08:53.100
 that internal subjective state that we're not explaining.

3:08:53.100 --> 3:08:54.680
 And we don't really have a hope of explaining

3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:55.720
 in the near future.

3:08:55.720 --> 3:08:58.680
 But don't you think we would still have that?

3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:00.580
 It's just the word internal loses meaning,

3:09:00.580 --> 3:09:02.200
 but don't you think we still have

3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:04.360
 that internal subjective state?

3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:09.360
 Or if not, then where the heck is the magic coming from?

3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:12.460
 Okay, well, I just think,

3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:16.840
 I think one of the problems

3:09:16.840 --> 3:09:19.160
 that I think we need to let go of

3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:23.460
 is we tend to, outside of the experience of consciousness,

3:09:23.460 --> 3:09:25.720
 the hard problem of consciousness,

3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:27.940
 we tend to think that we individual humans

3:09:27.940 --> 3:09:29.180
 are really special.

3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:32.360
 Not the subjective experience,

3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:34.840
 but the entirety of it, like the body

3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:35.800
 that contains the thing.

3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:40.800
 So the local, the constraint of all the stuff

3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:43.320
 has to be together, and it's all mine.

3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:48.640
 That's a very, I don't know if that has anything to do

3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:52.000
 with the mechanisms that are creating this.

3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:56.960
 So in fact, one really nice way to break through that

3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:01.960
 is to either observe or create consciousness

3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:06.160
 that spans multiple organisms.

3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:12.400
 Sort of like, let's say it's not an organism dependent

3:10:14.340 --> 3:10:17.540
 phenomena, that the phenomena can,

3:10:17.540 --> 3:10:22.160
 that's just a peculiar way it has evolved on Earth,

3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.320
 but it's a phenomena that doesn't have anything to do

3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:30.520
 with a specific biological system.

3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.760
 Right, so and we have different parts of our brain exist

3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:40.760
 and sometimes create complex awarenesses of things

3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:46.360
 that involve different neurons that are distributed widely

3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:49.040
 and that need to communicate with each other

3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:51.240
 to form this joint representation,

3:10:51.240 --> 3:10:53.120
 this state of consciousness.

3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:57.280
 But indeed, why do they have to be in the same head?

3:10:57.280 --> 3:11:01.280
 We don't know why that would be the case that they do.

3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:06.640
 And so that's a huge unanswered question in the field

3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:11.640
 is what is it that binds the activity of neurons together

3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:14.440
 so they can form a joint representation?

3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:16.840
 And actually this comes back to the dissociation experiment

3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:19.360
 we talked about before, where your sense of self

3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:23.480
 becomes separated from your body.

3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:26.600
 Those things that were fused in a joint representation,

3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:29.900
 the same concept, unitary, are now separate.

3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:35.440
 And in late 2020, we published a paper in Nature

3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:37.160
 showing how this could be.

3:11:37.160 --> 3:11:41.000
 We used optogenetics to drive this rhythm

3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:44.000
 that ketamine and PCP cause in retrosplenial cortex

3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:47.520
 and we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync

3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:50.440
 and when they were active, never able to be active

3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:53.680
 at the same time, never able to form

3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:56.120
 a joint representation at the same time.

3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:58.080
 And so we've got a toehold into these questions.

3:11:58.080 --> 3:11:59.920
 We don't have the answers, but.

3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:02.600
 And that mimics the dynamics of ketamine effects.

3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:04.280
 Exactly, exactly.

3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:06.880
 And you're able to find that kind of oscillation.

3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:09.920
 Wow, wow, wow.

3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:13.520
 I see if you get even greater and greater control

3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:16.000
 with more control over individual neurons

3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:19.840
 and understanding, like if you think of certain neurons

3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:24.500
 that having some role to play in the sense of self,

3:12:24.500 --> 3:12:26.180
 you can play like an orchestra.

3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:31.720
 That, to create certain degrees of consciousness,

3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:35.500
 degrees of subjectivity, and thereby understand

3:12:35.500 --> 3:12:37.480
 what is consciousness.

3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:40.880
 But by having a very complicated light switch essentially.

3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:44.780
 And here's the challenge is the nice thing

3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:48.200
 about the thought experiment is it kind of highlights

3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:51.760
 that we're gonna hit a point where

3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:57.380
 we're addressing some very, very fundamental questions.

3:12:57.380 --> 3:13:02.380
 What allows the activity of two sets of neurons

3:13:03.640 --> 3:13:07.080
 to become mutually relevant to each other?

3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:11.560
 This is in some ways maybe one of the deepest

3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:14.600
 remaining questions in neuroscience is what allows

3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:18.900
 activity patterns to become relevant to each other?

3:13:18.900 --> 3:13:21.200
 Do they have to be in sync temporarily?

3:13:21.200 --> 3:13:25.920
 Do they need to be, is there some other quality

3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:28.440
 that we don't know about that also needs to be present

3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:32.140
 to allow cells to fuse together into a joint representation?

3:13:32.140 --> 3:13:37.140
 Just so I understand, because it feels close

3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:39.460
 to some very, very deep idea.

3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.600
 So there's a bunch of semi distributed signals

3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:44.840
 going on in the brain.

3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:50.680
 And you're saying there could be something

3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:53.800
 like a theory of everything if one to exist

3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:58.240
 is to understand why, how and why signals

3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:03.240
 close to each other start becoming relevant to each other

3:14:07.040 --> 3:14:10.900
 as part of some very much bigger signal

3:14:10.900 --> 3:14:12.420
 that they're producing.

3:14:12.420 --> 3:14:14.960
 How they coordinate, essentially.

3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:18.440
 Because it's very distributed.

3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:22.440
 I mean that's a kind of, within a distributed system,

3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:24.260
 how is order achieved?

3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:28.840
 And this is a very specific kind of distributed system

3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:32.400
 that is one of the most intelligent that we're aware of

3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:33.880
 in the known universe.

3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:38.280
 In that would maybe be something also,

3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:42.400
 an understanding of the full conscious experience too.

3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.440
 That this kind of coordination.

3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:46.640
 How does the coordination between different neurons

3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:49.060
 that are responsible for sense of self,

3:14:49.060 --> 3:14:51.740
 how do they begin to form a big picture

3:14:51.740 --> 3:14:54.080
 that we see as a human experience?

3:14:54.080 --> 3:14:55.520
 That's really, really interesting.

3:14:55.520 --> 3:14:57.160
 So uniting the small and the,

3:14:57.160 --> 3:15:00.960
 I mean that's actually literally theory of everything.

3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:03.840
 Uniting the small, the sort of the theory of the neuron.

3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:07.800
 The functioning of the neuron with the big.

3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:12.060
 Just the functioning of the entire mind.

3:15:12.060 --> 3:15:12.900
 That's right.

3:15:12.900 --> 3:15:14.920
 And I think keeping a toehold in both

3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:17.820
 at the cellular level of resolution

3:15:17.820 --> 3:15:19.720
 and the brain wide resolution will be critical.

3:15:19.720 --> 3:15:21.320
 If you lose touch with either,

3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:23.580
 I think you'll miss the big insight.

3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:25.380
 So that's what we're trying to do.

3:15:25.380 --> 3:15:29.200
 Keeping grounded in the cellular resolution.

3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:32.200
 Trying to keep the broadest brain wide perspective

3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:33.360
 and meet in the middle.

3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:36.920
 Do you think you'll see it in your lifetime?

3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:39.560
 A major breakthrough in that dimension.

3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:40.400
 I have hope.

3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:42.020
 I have hope.

3:15:42.020 --> 3:15:43.760
 It's very hard to predict what will happen

3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:45.480
 with big things like this.

3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:46.800
 If we don't get there,

3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:48.560
 there'll be plenty of other exciting stuff.

3:15:48.560 --> 3:15:49.760
 So it's okay.

3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:52.920
 But the other aspect of this whole thing

3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:55.240
 is that your life is pretty short.

3:15:55.240 --> 3:15:56.640
 Yeah, that's true.

3:15:56.640 --> 3:15:59.440
 So first of all, you can die any day.

3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:01.360
 I tend to try to think about that,

3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:03.900
 that it ends, it can end any moment

3:16:03.900 --> 3:16:05.640
 because it really, really can.

3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:08.760
 And if not, it'll be soon anyway.

3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:09.960
 Do you think about that?

3:16:09.960 --> 3:16:12.260
 Do you think about your mortality?

3:16:12.260 --> 3:16:13.100
 I do, yeah.

3:16:13.100 --> 3:16:16.000
 It comes back to what we talked about earlier.

3:16:16.920 --> 3:16:18.480
 I never think I've done enough

3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:20.880
 and it's relevant to that for sure.

3:16:20.880 --> 3:16:23.460
 There's a deadline.

3:16:25.060 --> 3:16:27.180
 Do you think there's ever going to be a feeling

3:16:27.180 --> 3:16:31.720
 where you sit back and you're really proud of yourself?

3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:35.320
 I hope so.

3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:36.680
 Like, I've done enough.

3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:38.400
 I've done everything there is.

3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:41.080
 Because the thing is,

3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:44.800
 a warrior has some number of battles in them.

3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:47.000
 And at a certain point, if you're deeply honest,

3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:50.240
 it's like, well, that was a pretty good run.

3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:53.040
 As far as runs goes, that was pretty good.

3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:55.240
 And you can hang up your helmet

3:16:55.240 --> 3:17:00.240
 and then go sort of drink some ale,

3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:03.600
 listen to some music with the old lady,

3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:04.920
 and say, I did pretty good.

3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:06.280
 You think you'll get there?

3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:10.320
 You know, with something,

3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:12.960
 nature always has surprises for us.

3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:17.400
 The curious mind is always after more.

3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:21.240
 But biology gives us other rewards.

3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:25.020
 Children and family, community.

3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:28.400
 And one can feel good about those things.

3:17:30.340 --> 3:17:31.740
 Biology is full of rewards.

3:17:31.740 --> 3:17:34.780
 But do you think about those rewards?

3:17:34.780 --> 3:17:37.040
 What do you think is the why of those rewards?

3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:40.200
 What's the meaning of life and this existence?

3:17:40.200 --> 3:17:44.520
 What's the why of biology?

3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:45.460
 What does it want from us?

3:17:45.460 --> 3:17:47.980
 Why are all these cells very busy

3:17:47.980 --> 3:17:49.320
 putting together an organism

3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:53.660
 that seems to want to just be in a hurry to do stuff

3:17:53.660 --> 3:17:57.560
 and survive, but it's not happy being survived.

3:17:57.560 --> 3:17:59.240
 Like you said, it's curious.

3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:01.640
 It keeps wanting to get into more trouble.

3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:02.960
 Why?

3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:07.360
 Yeah, you know, we're clearly designed for that, right?

3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:10.680
 We're clearly designed to ask why and to answer.

3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:12.920
 And that, I think, is,

3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:15.320
 I don't know the meaning of all life.

3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:17.920
 I think a meaning of our lives is that.

3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:22.480
 And this is the Aristotelian happiness.

3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:24.320
 An organism is happy, an animal's happy

3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:26.440
 if it's performing to its design, right?

3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:29.760
 If it's doing what it was made for.

3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:33.680
 Yeah, well, you have to understand, what's the design?

3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:38.680
 And, you know, who is the designer

3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:43.840
 and what were they up to and how hard is it?

3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:45.180
 Do you have to build the whole universe?

3:18:45.180 --> 3:18:47.640
 And does the design even know what the hell they're doing?

3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:51.720
 Because, you know, maybe the designer built humans

3:18:51.720 --> 3:18:56.480
 to find out about themselves.

3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:57.520
 That's what I would do.

3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:00.720
 Like, if I had the power to build clones,

3:19:00.720 --> 3:19:02.480
 I would build a lot of clones

3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:04.840
 and I would get them into different trouble

3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:08.560
 to understand, like, what am I designed,

3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:10.440
 what's this body designed to do?

3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:11.680
 How far can I go that way?

3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:12.880
 Exactly.

3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:15.640
 And then, and I dissociate myself completely

3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:19.000
 from having any way to know, like, that I know that person.

3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:19.980
 Oh, that's good.

3:19:19.980 --> 3:19:21.280
 I mean, I suppose you could do that

3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:26.200
 in a single person's body, but dissociation, you could.

3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:29.280
 Yeah, but I do wonder what,

3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:33.800
 if you look at Earth as a collection of humans,

3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:35.940
 as a collection of biological organisms,

3:19:35.940 --> 3:19:38.920
 it seems that we're busy doing something

3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:45.440
 and it just seems too beautiful and too special

3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:50.440
 to be a random, a random experiment.

3:19:50.440 --> 3:19:55.440
 It seems like it's an experiment that's cleverly designed

3:19:57.080 --> 3:19:58.760
 That's right.

3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:00.640
 by some forces of nature

3:20:00.640 --> 3:20:03.560
 that are beyond our current understanding.

3:20:03.560 --> 3:20:05.520
 And maybe that's part of our design,

3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:06.560
 is to keep asking why.

3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:07.380
 You said answer.

3:20:07.380 --> 3:20:10.380
 I'm not sure that's part of the design, the answer.

3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:15.080
 I think we're given just the sufficiently limited

3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:19.020
 cognitive capability that we know how to long

3:20:19.020 --> 3:20:22.520
 to find the answer and we lack the ability

3:20:22.520 --> 3:20:24.120
 to find the answer.

3:20:24.120 --> 3:20:26.460
 That's basically a summary of your career.

3:20:26.460 --> 3:20:27.800
 No, I'm just kidding.

3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:29.480
 And then we give each other Nobel Prizes

3:20:29.480 --> 3:20:33.200
 for having even an inkling of a good step

3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:35.120
 towards the right direction.

3:20:35.120 --> 3:20:37.240
 Carl, you're an incredible human being.

3:20:38.580 --> 3:20:41.000
 I'm a huge fan of who you are as a person,

3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:43.520
 who you are as a scientist, who you are as a writer.

3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:45.300
 I just thank you so much.

3:20:45.300 --> 3:20:46.720
 I'm so honored that you would sit down

3:20:46.720 --> 3:20:47.560
 and talk to me today.

3:20:47.560 --> 3:20:48.380
 It was amazing.

3:20:48.380 --> 3:20:49.840
 It's been incredibly fun.

3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:50.740
 Let's do it again sometime.

3:20:50.740 --> 3:20:51.580
 Let's do it again.

3:20:51.580 --> 3:20:52.400
 It's been really great.

3:20:52.400 --> 3:20:55.600
 Your insights and wit and modesty

3:20:55.600 --> 3:20:58.260
 are really quite rewarding.

3:20:58.260 --> 3:21:00.520
 Thank you so much, man.

3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:02.040
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:21:02.040 --> 3:21:03.680
 with Carl Diceroth.

3:21:03.680 --> 3:21:04.920

 please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:21:07.480 --> 3:21:11.500
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

3:21:11.500 --> 3:21:13.960
 Knowing your own darkness is the best method

3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:16.360
 for dealing with the darkness of other people.

3:21:16.360 --> 3:21:20.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
