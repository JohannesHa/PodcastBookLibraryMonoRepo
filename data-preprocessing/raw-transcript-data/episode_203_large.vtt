00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Anya Fernald,

00:02.720 --> 00:04.760
 cofounder of Belcampo Farms,

00:04.760 --> 00:07.340
 that was founded with the purpose to create meat

00:07.340 --> 00:10.560
 that's good for people, the planet, and the animals,

00:10.560 --> 00:14.900
 specifically treating their animals as ethically as possible.

00:14.900 --> 00:18.120
 In this, she sought to revolutionize the meat industry

00:18.120 --> 00:19.600
 from the inside out.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.120
 She's also a scholar and practitioner

00:22.120 --> 00:24.080
 of regenerative agriculture,

00:24.080 --> 00:26.940
 and she's a chef who has appeared many times

00:26.940 --> 00:28.760
 as a judge on Iron Chef.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.880
 Plus, she has one of my favorite food related Instagrams.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.920
 On top of that, she's also a longtime friend

00:34.920 --> 00:38.500
 of Andrew Huberman, which is how we first got connected.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.280
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:40.280 --> 00:43.520
 Gala Games, Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic,

00:43.520 --> 00:45.620
 and Fundrise.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.780
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:48.780 --> 00:52.020
 As a side note, let me say that I got the chance to visit

00:52.020 --> 00:53.840
 and spend a few days with Anya

00:53.840 --> 00:56.800
 at Belcampo Farms in Northern California.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.920
 I met many animals there, from cows to pigs,

00:59.920 --> 01:03.120
 and saw the amazing land on which they grazed.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.640
 I butchered meat, I watched Anya cook many amazing meals,

01:07.640 --> 01:10.380
 I ate raw meat and cooked meat,

01:10.380 --> 01:14.400
 and spent long hours at the bonfire talking with friends

01:14.400 --> 01:16.800
 and listening to the sounds of nature.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.600
 I hiked, swam in a cold mountain lake,

01:19.600 --> 01:22.780
 and slept in a tent underneath the stars.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.480
 It was an amazing eye opening experience,

01:25.480 --> 01:29.920
 especially in my first ever visit to a slaughterhouse.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.600
 The term slaughterhouse is haunting in itself.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.560
 The animals I met lived a great life,

01:36.560 --> 01:38.960
 but in the end, they were slaughtered,

01:38.960 --> 01:40.720
 in the most ethical way possible,

01:40.720 --> 01:43.020
 but slaughtered nevertheless.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.200
 Seeing animals with whom just the day before

01:45.200 --> 01:47.960
 I made a connection be converted to meat

01:47.960 --> 01:51.840
 that I then consumed was deeply honest to me.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.480
 This ethical farm, Belcampo,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.660
 represents less than 1% of animals raised

01:56.660 --> 01:58.120
 in the United States.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.560
 The rest is factory farmed.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.960
 I could not escape the thought

02:01.960 --> 02:05.000
 of the 40 to 50 billion animals worldwide

02:05.000 --> 02:08.400
 raised in terrible conditions on these factory farms.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.680
 I've spent most of my life thinking about

02:10.680 --> 02:13.880
 and being in contact with human suffering,

02:13.880 --> 02:15.200
 but the landscape of suffering

02:15.200 --> 02:16.800
 in the minds of conscious beings

02:16.800 --> 02:19.000
 is much larger than humans.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.280
 I must admit that I still am haunted

02:21.280 --> 02:24.480
 by human suffering more than animal suffering.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.640
 Perhaps I will one day see the wrong

02:26.640 --> 02:28.680
 in me drawing such a line.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.960
 Either way, the visit to Belcampo Farms

02:30.960 --> 02:34.200
 made me realize that I have not thought deeply enough

02:34.200 --> 02:36.240
 about the ethics of my choices

02:36.240 --> 02:38.120
 and the choices of human civilization

02:38.120 --> 02:39.880
 with respect to animals.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.920
 And more importantly, I have not thought

02:42.920 --> 02:45.800
 or learned enough about large scale solutions

02:45.800 --> 02:48.040
 to alleviate animal suffering.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.960
 Belcampo is paving the way on this

02:49.960 --> 02:52.160
 and is the reason I wanted to show my support

02:52.160 --> 02:55.920
 for their and Anya's efforts in regenerative farming

02:55.920 --> 02:58.740
 and ethical treatment of animals.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

03:00.720 --> 03:03.760
 and here is my conversation with Anya Fernald.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.700
 If you're watching the video version of this

03:15.700 --> 03:17.940
 and are asking yourself why we're in nature right now,

03:17.940 --> 03:20.940
 there's actually a beautiful mountain in the background.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.440
 There's an incredible vast landscape.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.300
 There's a farm.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.900
 We're sitting behind a table and nevertheless,

03:28.900 --> 03:32.340
 I'm wearing a suit and tie amidst nature.

03:32.340 --> 03:35.400
 We're at the beautiful Belcampo Farms.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.800
 We're going to talk about that,

03:36.800 --> 03:38.280
 this incredible place you have here,

03:38.280 --> 03:40.680
 but you cooked some meat yesterday.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.040
 It tasted delicious.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.640
 So I'd love to talk about just the science

03:44.640 --> 03:46.720
 and art of cooking first.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.600
 You as a chef, when you think of cooking,

03:49.600 --> 03:51.960
 is it a science or is it an art?

03:51.960 --> 03:55.560
 Art and service together, probably.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.560
 Art to me because it's about creating something of beauty

04:00.920 --> 04:03.400
 and being responsive and creating something

04:03.400 --> 04:06.200
 that's expression of creativity and love.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.560
 Cooking also has a very strong element of service

04:09.560 --> 04:11.640
 and it doesn't mean necessarily service to another person,

04:11.640 --> 04:15.040
 but like service to health, wellness, environment.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.440
 There's an element of supporting through food

04:17.440 --> 04:18.960
 in how I approach cooking.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.280
 So it's bigger than just like how the ingredients

04:21.280 --> 04:22.680
 come together to form a taste.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.760
 It's the whole pipeline.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.840
 Like the fact that there's a lot of work

04:26.840 --> 04:30.900
 that went into bringing the ingredients together

04:30.900 --> 04:35.900
 and then giving you the ability to make the meal

04:36.560 --> 04:39.160
 and then who gets to consume the meal and the whole thing.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.060
 And you see that as service as opposed to just the taste.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.680
 Yeah, I also think of food as one of the key ways

04:46.680 --> 04:51.040
 that we interact with our environment, right?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.540
 It's the part of our environment

04:52.540 --> 04:54.560
 that goes inside us most visibly, right?

04:54.560 --> 04:55.900
 Of course, we interact with our environment.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.480
 We could have skin creams that have certain things in them

04:58.480 --> 05:01.000
 or our clothes can then be absorbed.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.080
 There's things in the air.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.960
 There's our water and there's food, right?

05:03.960 --> 05:06.600
 It's like how we're engaging in the world.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.680
 Physiologically, it's the most significant way

05:08.680 --> 05:10.640
 we engage in our environment.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.320
 We're extracting resources, calories, energy

05:13.320 --> 05:14.960
 from the environment in various ways

05:14.960 --> 05:19.120
 in order to preserve our bodies.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.320
 There's also so many feedback loops

05:21.320 --> 05:23.800
 that I don't think we know the beginning of

05:23.800 --> 05:27.000
 that our bodies are picking up on around nutrients,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.600
 available nutrients, immune response.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.800
 Like there's deep levels of sensory evaluation

05:33.800 --> 05:38.200
 that lead to health and alertness and wellness.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.000
 You hear about this a lot with babies that, you know,

05:42.040 --> 05:43.880
 if there's a risk of an infection

05:43.880 --> 05:46.380
 that a mom's breast milk will help the baby

05:46.380 --> 05:48.760
 develop a resistance, like there's this way

05:48.760 --> 05:50.320
 that our bodies can tune into health

05:50.320 --> 05:52.640
 and can't extrapolate from that in any specific way,

05:52.640 --> 05:55.240
 but think about that as an example of the many ways

05:55.240 --> 05:58.400
 in which our bodies are reading available nutrients and food

05:58.400 --> 06:01.680
 to signal other aspects of wellness and health.

06:01.680 --> 06:06.680
 That said, the final product of cooking is,

06:06.680 --> 06:08.540
 when done well, is really delicious.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.380
 And what we ate yesterday was really delicious.

06:10.380 --> 06:15.380
 So that aspect of it, bringing the ingredients together

06:15.420 --> 06:17.340
 in a way that tastes delicious,

06:17.340 --> 06:19.700
 do you see that as a science or art?

06:19.700 --> 06:21.020
 That's the art of it.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.220
 I mean, the art is like creating temptation

06:24.220 --> 06:27.060
 and indulgence and giving people pause,

06:27.060 --> 06:29.800
 you know, like creating experience that's like so sensual.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.220
 And like, I love that about when I make something

06:33.220 --> 06:36.460
 really simple and beautiful and delicious

06:36.460 --> 06:38.980
 the way that, like there's that moment of silence

06:38.980 --> 06:39.900
 at the table.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.700
 And that to me is the moment of art, like appreciation.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.620
 What about the buildup?

06:44.620 --> 06:48.020
 I mean, we got to watch you make the stuff over a fire.

06:48.020 --> 06:51.060
 So the calmness of the air, I mean, that's an experience.

06:51.060 --> 06:54.780
 We don't often get to see that experience of the preparation.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.540
 It's the anticipation, like you said.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.180
 Maybe that's the most delicious part of a meal

06:58.180 --> 06:59.820
 is the anticipation of it.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.540
 That's something that I'm glad you bring up

07:01.540 --> 07:04.140
 because it's an element that with eating so many

07:04.140 --> 07:08.140
 of our meals, like out of a bag and you know,

07:08.140 --> 07:09.860
 the instance where you start to eat the meals

07:09.860 --> 07:12.140
 when the delivery shows up and you might smell something

07:12.140 --> 07:13.100
 when you open the bag, right?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.620
 And no judgment on that.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.180
 That's something I do too, right?

07:16.180 --> 07:18.540
 But that does take away a whole element

07:18.540 --> 07:20.900
 of surprise and delight.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.540
 And also I think of your body's ability to prepare for it.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.500
 You know, you think about our most common memories

07:25.500 --> 07:28.220
 of childhood for those of us who grew up in homes

07:28.220 --> 07:31.740
 with parents who cooked is smell of things cooking.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.060
 And it's not the eating of it.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.060
 It's the smell of things cooking.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.460
 So why is that so memorable?

07:37.460 --> 07:40.220
 It's an anticipatory piece of food.

07:40.220 --> 07:42.540
 That's what you remember about your experiences of food

07:42.540 --> 07:44.340
 is the moment of like sweet anticipation

07:44.340 --> 07:46.180
 of this great sensual experience.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.820
 It's gonna be really gratifying on these emotional

07:48.820 --> 07:49.980
 and physical levels.

07:49.980 --> 07:52.700
 So I think we're also resonating on those memories

07:52.700 --> 07:55.500
 because it's like, it's an experience of food

07:55.500 --> 07:58.060
 where the sensuality of it is kind of extended.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.140
 So it's a long kind of arc of buildup

08:00.140 --> 08:01.620
 and then you're eating it and it's amazing.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.740
 Then you're enjoying it and your body feels good.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.340
 So all those pieces together,

08:05.340 --> 08:06.860
 it's a much more memorable experience

08:06.860 --> 08:08.980
 than just grabbing the cookie out of a bag, right?

08:08.980 --> 08:12.660
 So look at our own and just revisit in your mind

08:12.660 --> 08:15.420
 like the memories of food, the most compelling ones.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.820
 It's the smell and then the experience

08:18.820 --> 08:20.940
 and then sometimes how one felt, right?

08:20.940 --> 08:22.940
 Yeah, and the people involved with the smell.

08:22.940 --> 08:25.220
 So like somehow it's all tied in together

08:25.220 --> 08:27.100
 whether it's family or people close to you

08:27.100 --> 08:28.540
 or even if it's just chefs.

08:28.540 --> 08:32.660
 There's something about the personality of the human

08:32.660 --> 08:33.740
 involved in making the food

08:33.740 --> 08:35.900
 that kind of sticks with you in the memory.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.980
 And for me, I recently did a 72 hour fast

08:38.980 --> 08:42.220
 and there's a kind of sadness after you eat

08:42.220 --> 08:43.060
 that it's over.

08:43.060 --> 08:45.420
 I think the most delicious part was the,

08:45.420 --> 08:49.580
 I went to the grocery store and just actually walking around

08:49.580 --> 08:52.380
 and looking at food with like everything looked delicious.

08:52.380 --> 08:54.420
 Even like the crappiest stuff looked delicious

08:54.420 --> 08:55.700
 and I missed that.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.060
 I really enjoyed that anticipation

08:58.060 --> 08:59.660
 and then I picked out the meal.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.100
 I went home and I cooked it

09:01.100 --> 09:03.220
 and the whole thing took, I don't know,

09:03.220 --> 09:05.500
 maybe two, three hours, like the whole process.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
 And that was the most delicious part

09:07.500 --> 09:08.740
 and the first taste of course.

09:08.740 --> 09:13.620
 And then after it was over, there's a bit of a sadness

09:13.620 --> 09:16.900
 because the part I remember is the buildup, the anticipation

09:16.900 --> 09:20.020
 and then once you eat, it's over.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.060
 We kind of focus on the destination

09:22.060 --> 09:23.420
 but it's the whole journey.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.900
 The whole like, even if you go to a restaurant,

09:25.900 --> 09:29.220
 it's the conversations leading up to the meal

09:29.220 --> 09:30.700
 and the first taste of the meal.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.540
 That's where the joy is.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.380
 And if you get to watch the making of that meal,

09:34.380 --> 09:35.420
 that's incredible.

09:35.420 --> 09:38.260
 That's where the smell, the visual,

09:38.260 --> 09:40.260
 how the ingredients come together

09:40.260 --> 09:43.460
 and especially as we were looking over the fire,

09:43.460 --> 09:48.460
 like watching it, the fire play with the raw meat

09:50.220 --> 09:53.940
 and over time bring out the colors, bring out the,

09:53.940 --> 09:57.220
 I don't know, like you can visually associate the flavor,

09:57.220 --> 10:01.180
 you know, how it becomes a little bit burnt on the outside,

10:01.180 --> 10:02.820
 you know, it has a crispiness to it,

10:02.820 --> 10:03.940
 it starts to gain that crispiness

10:03.940 --> 10:06.220
 and immediately your past memories

10:06.220 --> 10:08.620
 of the delicious crispiness of various foods you've eaten

10:08.620 --> 10:10.500
 are somehow mapped into your,

10:10.500 --> 10:13.180
 immediately you start to taste it visually.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.180
 I don't know, yeah, that experience is magical.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.780
 It's, and of course, maybe it's the Russian thing

10:17.780 --> 10:20.680
 but I'm almost like saddened when it's over.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.680
 I think fasting is gaining in popularity

10:24.680 --> 10:27.300
 because we're having to relearn the importance

10:27.300 --> 10:30.880
 of being hungry in anticipation and delight.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.920
 Yeah.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.400
 We have such a fear of hunger

10:34.400 --> 10:37.840
 and that's really functional in evolution, right?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.240
 But we have this deep fear of hunger

10:39.240 --> 10:42.280
 and part of the great American experience has been

10:42.280 --> 10:44.440
 that we don't have to be afraid of hunger at all

10:44.440 --> 10:47.120
 because there's food everywhere and it's really cheap.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.920
 In all that abundance, we've lost this edge of hunger

10:51.920 --> 10:54.240
 and we don't let ourselves get hungry.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.040
 And that's one thing that I learned

10:56.040 --> 10:59.080
 in part of my journey as a cook and chef has been,

10:59.080 --> 11:01.560
 you know, moving abroad was the first time

11:01.560 --> 11:03.760
 when I lived out of the US,

11:03.760 --> 11:06.560
 was the first time that I regularly experienced hunger

11:06.560 --> 11:09.880
 because the time between meals was really long

11:09.880 --> 11:12.120
 and that was just what everybody did.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.840
 And so I was hungry for two hours before lunch.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.340
 And that was the first time in my life

11:16.340 --> 11:19.200
 that there hadn't just been readily available snacks.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.720
 So I wonder if the intermittent fasting

11:21.720 --> 11:23.760
 and part of the popularity around it,

11:23.760 --> 11:26.000
 I'm sure there's all these amazing metabolic things

11:26.000 --> 11:28.600
 that are happening, but also people might also feel better

11:28.600 --> 11:32.300
 because they're really anticipating and enjoying food.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.800
 And then if you look at the feelings of fullness,

11:34.800 --> 11:37.320
 there's a really interesting thing that happens

11:37.320 --> 11:41.200
 when you cook and your sense of fullness,

11:41.200 --> 11:45.320
 which is if you cook and you're hungry,

11:45.320 --> 11:47.240
 the experience of being around the food,

11:47.240 --> 11:50.240
 smelling it, touching it, sampling it,

11:50.240 --> 11:53.620
 you'll take your hunger down by 40%.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.640
 And this is my own observation.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.040
 But as, I mean, we've all had the experience

11:58.040 --> 11:59.840
 of cooking Thanksgiving and the cook

11:59.840 --> 12:01.500
 never kind of wants to eat that much Thanksgiving.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.960
 That's an extreme experience.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.220
 But when you really dive in and you're cooking

12:05.220 --> 12:06.660
 for a few hours and you're smelling

12:06.660 --> 12:07.860
 and smelling and smelling,

12:07.860 --> 12:12.040
 it totally changes your threshold of satiety and fullness

12:12.040 --> 12:15.520
 because of other sensory things that are happening.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.560
 And for those of us looking to maintain weight

12:18.560 --> 12:20.740
 and something to consider in this is that cooking

12:20.740 --> 12:24.280
 is also part of what your appetite,

12:24.280 --> 12:27.000
 when you're hungry, what are you hungry for, right?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
 So we tend to think about calories, but when you're hungry,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.480
 you might also be hungrier for a wider range of things.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.800
 And it might be smells, it might be stopping.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.720
 There's other elements and that's something,

12:38.720 --> 12:42.960
 I think as a cook, that it's powerful to explore

12:42.960 --> 12:46.320
 and be with and observe how your hunger changes

12:46.320 --> 12:47.920
 when you're cooking.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.560
 Well, let me ask the romantic question.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.400
 When did you first fall in love with cooking?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.340
 Me falling in love with cooking

12:55.340 --> 12:58.760
 was about solving a problem in my family.

12:58.760 --> 13:03.760
 And it had to do with my mom feeling very anxious

13:04.000 --> 13:08.520
 about cooking and overwhelmed frequently

13:08.520 --> 13:09.640
 when it came to meals.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.600
 And I'm naturally very good at juggling a lot of things.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.080
 And it was just something I could dive in and help

13:17.080 --> 13:21.080
 and help my dad, who I'm very, very close to.

13:21.080 --> 13:25.320
 So it was a very functional role where I would see

13:25.320 --> 13:28.920
 this kind of crescendo of anxiety around meal times

13:28.920 --> 13:33.920
 as a kid and would be able to dive in and solve things.

13:33.920 --> 13:37.040
 And I also loved women who cooked.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.800
 Like my father's mother was a great cook.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.360
 She was, I remember her telling me as a kid,

13:42.360 --> 13:45.040
 I was asking her about church and why she went to church.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.400
 And she's like, I mostly go to church

13:46.400 --> 13:50.560
 because I get to cook for the potlucks.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.040
 And so there was an openness around that,

13:53.040 --> 13:54.360
 but she just loved to cook for people

13:54.360 --> 13:56.160
 and there was this real tenderness

13:56.160 --> 13:57.800
 and expression of that love.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.640
 So seeing women in my life who had this real tenderness

14:01.640 --> 14:04.200
 and love that they shared through food

14:04.200 --> 14:06.840
 and then also being able in my own home

14:06.840 --> 14:09.120
 to kind of pitch in and add value

14:09.120 --> 14:14.120
 and help my mom and dad was really powerful for me.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
 Cause I felt like I had a superpower.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.440
 I felt like, oh man, I just made this stressful thing

14:19.440 --> 14:20.720
 go away.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.880
 That was huge.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.720
 It's kind of interesting.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.040
 I don't know if you can comment on,

14:24.040 --> 14:26.720
 especially for me growing up in Russia,

14:26.720 --> 14:29.240
 it's probably true in a lot of cultures,

14:29.240 --> 14:30.400
 maybe every culture.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.720
 That food, and especially like in a family,

14:33.720 --> 14:36.920
 the mother that cooks is the source of love

14:36.920 --> 14:38.720
 and like ties the family together.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.320
 It creates events where everyone comes together.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.640
 It's one of the only chances of togetherness.

14:45.640 --> 14:49.160
 The thing that bonds a family is like dinner

14:49.160 --> 14:51.120
 or food, eating together.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.080
 And I don't know what to do with that.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.720
 It ties up with like dieting and so on.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.120
 When I was on stricter diets,

14:57.120 --> 14:59.320
 especially competing and cutting weight and stuff,

14:59.320 --> 15:02.680
 it felt like I was almost like losing opportunity

15:02.680 --> 15:04.560
 to connect with friends and family.

15:04.560 --> 15:05.800
 It's interesting.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.720
 It's almost like cultures,

15:08.720 --> 15:12.400
 we cannot fully experience love and family without eating.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.800
 And on the flip side of that,

15:13.800 --> 15:17.680
 eating enables us to experience love and family.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.200
 I don't know what to do with that.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.040
 It's a tough one.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.480
 Cause there's lots of layers around kind of gender roles

15:23.480 --> 15:26.440
 and families changing and things.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.440
 I'd say I agree around the alienation

15:29.440 --> 15:31.120
 and I've done carnivore diet

15:31.120 --> 15:32.800
 and I've tried some of these extreme protocols.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.480
 And I too, I suffered from loneliness.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.160
 It was like doing carnivore

15:37.160 --> 15:40.640
 and not being able to eat what my kids ate

15:40.640 --> 15:42.240
 and talk about it at the same time.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.120
 Those pieces are real.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.320
 And I wonder with all of these diets,

15:47.280 --> 15:50.200
 if that structure is actually helping

15:50.200 --> 15:52.040
 or just taking away from people's

15:52.040 --> 15:54.200
 kind of sensual understanding.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.720
 But I think that there's some rigor

15:55.720 --> 15:57.280
 around that that helps people discover

15:57.280 --> 15:59.680
 what's good for them by eliminating

15:59.680 --> 16:02.400
 and then growing towards more intuitive food

16:02.400 --> 16:05.320
 is a good evolution from that base.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.960
 I love to cook for people.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.680
 I love to pay attention to their way of being

16:13.680 --> 16:15.760
 and read what they'd like to eat.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.800
 And it's my purest way of love.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.720
 And that's for everybody in my life.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.640
 I actually love to cook for people I love.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.560
 I would struggle to be putting out food all the time.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.520
 It's like something for me, it's a real act of caretaking.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.400
 So I definitely have that in my makeup.

16:33.400 --> 16:38.400
 And I definitely notice in times of real stress,

16:41.480 --> 16:43.720
 that's the piece that drops off.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.560
 And it's like, if I'm unable to care for myself,

16:45.560 --> 16:46.920
 I have a hard time cooking.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.400
 So for me, it's very emotional.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.800
 It's very connected to love.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.880
 And individualistic.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.640
 So like focused on the particular individual.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.040
 It's almost like a journey of understanding

16:58.040 --> 17:00.200
 what that person is excited about

17:00.200 --> 17:02.760
 in the landscape of flavors.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.040
 Like figuring that person out, what they like,

17:05.040 --> 17:06.760
 what they love to eat.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.400
 Yeah, I see cooking from, I mostly cook for myself.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.080
 So I see that as almost, this is gonna be like

17:14.080 --> 17:17.360
 the worst term, but like an act of self love.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.200
 Uh huh.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.640
 This is gonna be clipped out.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.640
 But that like, it's almost an exploration

17:25.640 --> 17:27.960
 of like what brings me joy.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.760
 And it's surprising, because I usually don't share,

17:29.760 --> 17:32.640
 because the things that bring me joy

17:32.640 --> 17:34.160
 are the simplest ingredients.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.400
 Like I'm one of those people,

17:36.400 --> 17:38.080
 I don't know if you can psychoanalyze me,

17:38.080 --> 17:40.840
 because you also like basic ingredients.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.600
 I like a single ingredient to ingredients,

17:43.600 --> 17:45.520
 because I feel like I can deeply appreciate

17:45.520 --> 17:47.360
 the particular ingredient then.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.440
 I get easily distracted.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.360
 You know, people who are really good listening to music,

17:51.360 --> 17:52.960
 they can hear a piece of music,

17:52.960 --> 17:55.680
 and in their mind, extract the different layers,

17:55.680 --> 17:57.640
 and enjoy different layers at a time.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.440
 Like the bass, the drums, the different layering

18:00.440 --> 18:02.760
 of the piano, the beats, and all that kind of stuff.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.880
 That's what it means to truly enjoy music,

18:04.880 --> 18:06.680
 to listen to a piece over and over.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.560
 Like almost like as a scholar.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.640
 In that same way for food, I just can't do more

18:10.640 --> 18:13.280
 than like three, because then it's just,

18:13.280 --> 18:15.840
 I have to give in to the chaos of it, I guess.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.600
 But when it's just a basic ingredient,

18:17.600 --> 18:22.000
 like just meat, or just a vegetable, like basic grilled

18:22.000 --> 18:24.320
 without sauces, without any of that,

18:24.320 --> 18:27.280
 that I've discovered is what brings me a lot of joy.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.080
 But that's boring to a lot of people.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.760
 So I usually have to be kind of private about that joy.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.200
 So, but that's mine, so yeah, I figured that out.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.960
 I guess as a chef, you have to figure that out

18:38.960 --> 18:41.880
 about everybody that you care for.

18:41.880 --> 18:46.880
 Well, also for you, you're very interested in things,

18:46.880 --> 18:50.120
 and interested in things being done well

18:50.120 --> 18:50.960
 and appreciating them.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.720
 So the single ingredient also allows you to control

18:53.720 --> 18:55.400
 for perfection in cooking that,

18:55.400 --> 18:58.280
 which is probably really appealing to you.

18:58.280 --> 19:01.760
 And I think sometimes I see people also in the beginning

19:01.760 --> 19:05.280
 of their journey of culinary trying to do too many things.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.280
 So there's another piece too, that you'll notice,

19:08.280 --> 19:11.200
 if you recall last night, I grilled us a salad,

19:11.200 --> 19:13.520
 and then I did all those pieces separately.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.240
 And that's something in general to be really attentive of

19:16.240 --> 19:17.680
 when you're building flavor,

19:17.680 --> 19:21.640
 to make sure you pay attention to every piece separately.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.720
 The idea that you can, okay,

19:24.720 --> 19:27.520
 with a soup or something or a stew, there's workarounds,

19:27.520 --> 19:29.280
 but like to make a great dish

19:29.280 --> 19:31.480
 that's got four or five vegetables in it,

19:31.480 --> 19:35.320
 cook them all separately to their optimal deliciousness

19:35.320 --> 19:36.640
 and then combine them.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.280
 So that's another way to approach that,

19:38.280 --> 19:39.640
 is that you may also be able to look

19:39.640 --> 19:41.360
 at the different ingredients separately

19:41.360 --> 19:44.520
 and still have that sense of understanding of it.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.280
 But there's too often that we're layering together

19:47.280 --> 19:50.680
 like four or five things and then cooking them all at once

19:50.680 --> 19:52.520
 and then surprise that it's not delicious.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.040
 Cause you can't really optimize on multiple variables

19:56.040 --> 19:58.720
 at the same time for peak awesomeness.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.200
 And that's actually, the number one way you see this

20:01.200 --> 20:03.800
 is roasting a whole chicken, which is a really difficult,

20:03.800 --> 20:05.720
 it's the simplest dish, but it's very difficult

20:05.720 --> 20:08.640
 because you have the breast meat, which is bigger chunks.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.600
 They cook faster.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.440
 You have the thighs and drums,

20:11.440 --> 20:14.200
 which are smaller and they cook slower.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.120
 To optimize that and pay attention to it

20:16.120 --> 20:17.240
 and do it all right,

20:17.240 --> 20:19.440
 you're actually solving for different outcomes.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.480
 So there's one example, but oftentimes food

20:22.480 --> 20:25.360
 is less delicious with multiple ingredients at the start

20:25.360 --> 20:27.440
 because we're not able to pay attention

20:27.440 --> 20:29.760
 to how each one needs to end up.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.560
 So there's a way to parse that apart

20:31.560 --> 20:33.840
 and achieve a better outcome.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.240
 I don't know if you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.240
 It's a documentary about, yeah.

20:39.240 --> 20:43.200
 So there's an obsession that that particular,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.560
 first of all, set of humans,

20:46.480 --> 20:50.320
 but also the particular cuisine

20:50.320 --> 20:52.600
 that focused on the basics of the ingredients.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.560
 What do you think of that kind of trying to achieve mastery

20:56.560 --> 21:00.120
 through repeating the making of the same meal

21:00.120 --> 21:02.840
 over and over and over for like decades?

21:02.840 --> 21:06.200
 Like, do you find beauty in that journey towards mastery

21:06.200 --> 21:09.560
 or do you think it should be always an exploration

21:09.560 --> 21:11.200
 to where you're always trying things,

21:11.200 --> 21:14.560
 you're always kind of injecting new flavors,

21:14.560 --> 21:16.720
 new experiences, all that kind of stuff?

21:17.800 --> 21:19.480
 I think you have to decide on a palette.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.960
 You know, if we're talking about an art,

21:20.960 --> 21:24.120
 it's equivalent to saying, am I a sculptor or a painter?

21:24.120 --> 21:26.560
 That, the sushi lexicon thing,

21:26.560 --> 21:28.880
 that's a very, very narrow, small canvas

21:28.880 --> 21:30.080
 that you're painting on.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
 And that is a beautiful road, right?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.760
 There's a beauty and a perfection to that.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.680
 It's like, I mean, there's many things culturally

21:36.680 --> 21:38.440
 around that that you could extrapolate

21:38.440 --> 21:40.520
 for specifically for Japan.

21:40.520 --> 21:44.400
 But I encourage people on the journey in food

21:44.400 --> 21:47.480
 to choose like kind of a language

21:47.480 --> 21:49.280
 that they're working within.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.280
 And if you wanna step out of that occasionally

21:51.280 --> 21:52.960
 and have one or two dishes,

21:52.960 --> 21:55.240
 but if you wanna get mastery with food,

21:55.240 --> 21:58.440
 you probably aren't gonna be able to get more than say,

21:58.440 --> 22:00.560
 20 ingredients that you use regularly

22:00.560 --> 22:02.400
 that you really understand.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.600
 And so we often see, you know, I see the American pantry,

22:06.600 --> 22:08.720
 it's got tons of sauces and tons of spices

22:08.720 --> 22:10.560
 and tons of spice blends.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.880
 And then really people only use just a couple of things.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.600
 And the idea that you can sort of splash out

22:15.600 --> 22:17.760
 and do Korean one night and then tacos the next night,

22:17.760 --> 22:20.680
 you can absolutely, but to get in a regular cadence

22:20.680 --> 22:21.640
 of specific ingredients,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.880
 you're probably gonna get more mastery with that sooner.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.040
 And I think as much as you can do

22:27.040 --> 22:30.840
 to get an understanding of the basics around salt and acid

22:30.840 --> 22:31.880
 and understand your palette,

22:31.880 --> 22:34.520
 like for me, it's lemon and usually sherry vinegar, right?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.880
 So that's my acid palette.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.160
 And my fat palates, you know, suet and butter, olive oil.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.760
 So you can sort of choose your language,

22:40.760 --> 22:42.320
 what you're painting with,

22:42.320 --> 22:44.360
 but I wouldn't splash out and say, do I use sesame oil?

22:44.360 --> 22:45.520
 Yeah, every once in a while,

22:45.520 --> 22:48.440
 but that's not part of my base palette, right?

22:48.440 --> 22:50.800
 Can you say again what your fat palette is?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.680
 It'd be butter, suet and olive oil.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.640
 And olive oil, so not, why olive oil?

22:56.640 --> 22:58.280
 Is it your roots in Italy?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.800
 I like the flavor for finish

22:59.800 --> 23:02.160
 because of the bitterness that it adds.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.720
 So I like the bitter and acid contrast on meat

23:05.720 --> 23:07.640
 and vegetables, which is mostly what I eat.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.000
 And so I love that way that the bitterness

23:11.000 --> 23:12.800
 and astringency complements

23:12.800 --> 23:14.280
 and allows the flavors to come out.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.240
 What do you think about coconut oil?

23:16.240 --> 23:19.720
 I recently discovered that there's a, I don't know,

23:19.720 --> 23:21.880
 there's a sweetness or there's something to it

23:21.880 --> 23:26.880
 that I really enjoy, maybe because it's new.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.120
 It's good with heat.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.000
 And I really love it for some reason.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.680
 As a chef, do you ever try it?

23:33.680 --> 23:34.520
 What do you think about it?

23:34.520 --> 23:35.800
 I like it in coffee.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.960
 I like it as a treat a little bit.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.400
 I find the flavor a little bit challenging in foods.

23:41.400 --> 23:45.120
 I also find that it's difficult

23:46.000 --> 23:48.160
 on the quality of that ingredient.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.280
 So I've found often that I buy a high quality coconut oil

23:51.280 --> 23:53.080
 and there's rancidity in it.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.160
 And I don't totally know why.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.480
 I think it's just the cold chain

23:55.480 --> 23:57.280
 and how that product's packaged.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.080
 So I've had some issues with product quality in that.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.080
 But for me, it's a little bit too much sweetness

24:03.080 --> 24:05.040
 in my foods, but then again,

24:05.040 --> 24:07.080
 I don't cook in like a Southeast Asian palette.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.000
 I try to not have much sweetness in my foods in general.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.040
 So I, just because of the palette that I like to cook with.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.120
 So for me, coconut's got a little bit too much

24:14.120 --> 24:15.960
 of those high notes and earthiness,

24:15.960 --> 24:18.320
 which is a nice combination, but it's more like a treat.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.640
 Yeah, it is almost like a treat.

24:19.640 --> 24:23.560
 It has a flavor of its own that almost stands on its own.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.080
 Like I could probably just eat coconut.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.480
 That's probably the only oil I could enjoy by itself.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.360
 It sounds weird to say,

24:30.360 --> 24:33.360
 but it feels like fat is often a thing

24:33.360 --> 24:35.520
 that enriches the flavor of something else.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.360
 Coconut can almost stand on its own.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.000
 You might also be responding to that.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.720
 It's a complex flavor.

24:40.720 --> 24:44.400
 So there's also, there's an analogous,

24:44.400 --> 24:46.560
 you know, if you look at butter, for example,

24:46.560 --> 24:48.400
 a lot of the butter that we eat in the US

24:48.400 --> 24:50.280
 is just sweet cream butter.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.400
 It's not cultured.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.440
 If you explore like a cultured fermented butter,

24:55.440 --> 24:58.160
 maybe a grass milk, grass fed and finished butter,

24:58.160 --> 25:00.480
 you're gonna get a ton more complexity.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.760
 And so you may also just be responding

25:02.760 --> 25:05.040
 to having fats with more flavor,

25:05.040 --> 25:09.120
 which is the journey in the US

25:09.120 --> 25:12.760
 has been towards refined foods that are very neutral.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.680
 And then you have to combine more of them

25:14.680 --> 25:16.400
 to make things taste like things.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.960
 And so if you're coming from a background

25:19.960 --> 25:21.960
 of using mostly just generic butter

25:21.960 --> 25:23.640
 or let's say canola oil to cook with,

25:23.640 --> 25:25.280
 those are very neutral oils.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.680
 So you can also take some of your favorite fats

25:27.680 --> 25:30.040
 and look for versions of them that are more flavorful.

25:30.040 --> 25:33.320
 I mean, I love olive oil as a treat in a spoon.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.160
 Really?

25:34.160 --> 25:35.400
 Like a good California extra virgin olive oil.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.240
 I'll just like have it as,

25:36.240 --> 25:37.760
 I'll eat a piece of butter as a treat.

25:37.760 --> 25:38.600
 Yeah.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.000
 That's like, or butter with salt on it.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.120
 Like good fats can, all of them can be,

25:43.120 --> 25:44.600
 if they're minimally processed

25:44.600 --> 25:47.720
 and they're fabulous and it's so delicious, right?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.960
 But there are things that you have to like look for

25:49.960 --> 25:53.120
 a version of them that's got that full palette of flavor.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.720
 Well, for me also the flavors are inextricably tied

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
 to the memories I've had with those flavors.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.960
 So for better or worse,

26:01.920 --> 26:04.200
 back when I used to eat a lot of ice cream,

26:04.200 --> 26:06.240
 I for some reason had a lot of pleasant experience

26:06.240 --> 26:07.440
 with coconut ice cream.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.440
 So that particular flavor just permeates

26:10.440 --> 26:11.360
 throughout my life now.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.080
 Like I'm stuck with it for better or worse

26:14.080 --> 26:17.440
 as a flavor that brings up pleasant memories.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.640
 And as I have a few such flavors,

26:19.640 --> 26:22.560
 I have such relationship with all kinds of meat too.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.160
 Like it's just so many pleasant memories and that's it.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.960
 Like you're almost tasting the memories.

26:28.960 --> 26:33.160
 And that there's no way to separate the flavor

26:33.160 --> 26:34.560
 from the memories, I suppose.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.920
 And that's a powerful thing.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.560
 What's your favorite meal to cook?

26:39.080 --> 26:41.480
 I'll roast a couple of chickens

26:41.480 --> 26:44.760
 and then I'll poach them, like I'll boil them

26:44.760 --> 26:45.600
 and let it cool down.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.320
 It's a complicated one.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.800
 I'll let them cool down.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.720
 I'll pull all the meat off, put the bones back into the pot

26:51.720 --> 26:54.960
 and then cook that for like three or four hours

26:54.960 --> 26:57.160
 and then add in like shiitake mushrooms

26:57.160 --> 26:58.800
 and all the chicken meat.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.280
 And I'll throw in a bottle of white wine

27:01.280 --> 27:04.640
 into the stock as well, a bunch of thyme and garlic.

27:04.640 --> 27:09.640
 And I love it because it's the way the house smells.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.960
 It's very laborious.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.000
 It's soothing for me to spend time picking apart meat

27:14.000 --> 27:14.920
 and chopping things up.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.640
 There's like a lot of manuality around it.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.360
 So I'd say from a personal, like, I mean,

27:19.360 --> 27:21.040
 I love grilling a steak and doing those things as well,

27:21.040 --> 27:24.560
 but there's something about making a stock from scratch

27:24.560 --> 27:26.760
 and the way it smells, the way I feel,

27:26.760 --> 27:29.760
 the time it takes, the kind of checking in on it

27:29.760 --> 27:31.380
 that I really, really love.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.240
 There's many things I love to make

27:33.240 --> 27:35.440
 that I don't even love to eat.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.160
 I think you see this a lot in like baking and bakers,

27:38.160 --> 27:40.880
 people who bake a ton and they love the process of it,

27:40.880 --> 27:42.640
 even if they don't eat that many baked goods.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.360
 So anything for me that's really like enjoyable

27:45.360 --> 27:47.280
 is typically things like making cinnamon buns.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.640
 I don't eat very many cinnamon buns,

27:48.640 --> 27:51.080
 but I love making them because it takes all the sort

27:51.080 --> 27:54.160
 of like futzing around and taking your time and watching it

27:54.160 --> 27:56.360
 and the way it smells, the way the house smells.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.880
 All of that stuff is like,

27:57.880 --> 28:01.360
 it's like almost like a meditative exercise for me.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.440
 Is there a science, is there an art to cooking meat well

28:04.440 --> 28:05.960
 and the different kinds of meats?

28:05.960 --> 28:08.080
 Is there something you can convert it towards

28:09.480 --> 28:14.480
 in to say ideas, how to bring out the best of it

28:15.560 --> 28:17.420
 out of what particular meat,

28:17.420 --> 28:18.440
 whatever steak we're talking about,

28:18.440 --> 28:20.360
 whatever beef we're talking about?

28:20.360 --> 28:21.800
 Is there something that can be said?

28:21.800 --> 28:26.440
 The basic approach to cooking any type of meat

28:27.440 --> 28:30.500
 beyond the artistry of it is pretty scientific.

28:30.500 --> 28:35.160
 And it's what type of muscle is it in the animal

28:35.160 --> 28:37.360
 and what's the surface area to volume ratio?

28:38.700 --> 28:40.720
 Okay, so let's look at those two questions.

28:40.720 --> 28:44.080
 So the first piece is what's the type of muscle

28:44.080 --> 28:44.920
 in the animal?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.300
 What's the functionality?

28:46.300 --> 28:49.160
 You don't necessarily need to know that to evaluate it,

28:49.160 --> 28:51.520
 but you need to understand, is it a tender muscle

28:51.520 --> 28:53.640
 that's not used very frequently in the animal?

28:53.640 --> 28:55.200
 Or is it a big load bearing muscle

28:55.200 --> 28:57.340
 that gets a lot of action, like the cheek, right?

28:57.340 --> 28:59.500
 Or the shin or those pieces?

29:00.360 --> 29:04.200
 The muscles like those along the spinal cord

29:04.200 --> 29:06.560
 that make up rib eyes and New York steaks and things,

29:06.560 --> 29:08.200
 those aren't very exercised.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.160
 They're right next to the spinal cord.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.680
 Spinal cord's doing most of the work there.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.720
 They're kind of like stabilizing muscles

29:13.720 --> 29:17.640
 around this big functional piece of skeletal structure

29:17.640 --> 29:19.320
 in the animal.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.720
 Other muscles, like the ones around the diaphragm

29:21.720 --> 29:23.720
 with the flat iron steaks and skirt steaks and things,

29:23.720 --> 29:25.640
 those are really functional muscles

29:25.640 --> 29:27.340
 that are doing a ton and moving.

29:27.340 --> 29:30.400
 And if they're moving a lot, what happens?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.080
 Well, functionally, they've got lots of muscle sheaths

29:34.080 --> 29:36.000
 because muscles that move frequently

29:36.000 --> 29:39.320
 have to do a lot of like complex contraction.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.020
 That's why there's, in the cheek, for example,

29:43.020 --> 29:45.020
 there's tons of visible fiber

29:45.020 --> 29:47.320
 of like collagenous connective tissue.

29:47.320 --> 29:52.320
 That connective tissue is everything in how the meat cooks

29:52.860 --> 29:56.700
 because connective tissue doesn't respond to high heat

29:56.700 --> 29:58.220
 with becoming more tender.

29:58.220 --> 29:59.260
 Muscles do, right?

29:59.260 --> 30:00.100
 They can get a sear on them.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.300
 You can cut them and eat them.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.820
 The collagenous tissue will glom up and get really tough.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.380
 So you either have to liquefy it

30:06.380 --> 30:10.940
 with really low, slow heat with moisture, right?

30:10.940 --> 30:12.620
 Or you have to barely cook it.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.020
 And so that's the major piece.

30:15.020 --> 30:15.860
 So that's the question of like,

30:15.860 --> 30:18.220
 why wouldn't you just throw a brisket on the grill?

30:18.220 --> 30:19.060
 Okay?

30:19.060 --> 30:19.900
 It's not about the fat.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.740
 You can cut the fat out.

30:20.740 --> 30:22.500
 The reason you're not gonna throw a brisket on the grill

30:22.500 --> 30:23.340
 and cook it hot and fast

30:23.340 --> 30:25.980
 is it's got too much collagenous connective tissue in it.

30:25.980 --> 30:28.860
 Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen

30:28.860 --> 30:31.220
 and these fibers and tendons in them effectively.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.580
 So you're never gonna be able to just cook that up

30:33.580 --> 30:35.180
 hot and fast.

30:35.180 --> 30:36.020
 So that's the first piece.

30:36.020 --> 30:38.660
 It's like, where's this muscle in the architecture

30:38.660 --> 30:39.500
 of the animal?

30:39.500 --> 30:42.300
 And then what does that mean for what's going on

30:42.300 --> 30:43.140
 in the muscle?

30:43.140 --> 30:46.820
 And that's actually more important than fat content.

30:46.820 --> 30:48.020
 We get really kind of,

30:48.020 --> 30:50.540
 we pay a lot of attention to fat content in muscles.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.780
 You can make a steak tender

30:51.780 --> 30:53.140
 if it doesn't have a ton of fat in it.

30:53.140 --> 30:55.660
 It actually has more to do if there's collagenous

30:55.660 --> 30:57.060
 and connective tissue in it.

30:58.020 --> 30:58.860
 That's fascinating.

30:58.860 --> 30:59.900
 I never even thought about that.

30:59.900 --> 31:04.180
 I just, I thought it kind of universal.

31:04.180 --> 31:06.900
 I mean, it adds to the texture of the meat,

31:06.900 --> 31:08.620
 the chewiness of the meat.

31:08.620 --> 31:12.620
 But you're saying it's also adds to how the meat is cooked.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.060
 How heat, how it reacts to heat,

31:15.060 --> 31:17.540
 how the entirety of the meat reacts to heat.

31:17.540 --> 31:20.900
 And the fat is not as important to that as the collagen.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.180
 The fat will make the flavor more delicious, right?

31:23.180 --> 31:25.420
 Like it'll add unctuousness and mouthfeel

31:25.420 --> 31:26.220
 and things like that.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.940
 But all the connective tissue in meat

31:28.940 --> 31:29.940
 and in some of the cuts,

31:29.940 --> 31:31.540
 like that we ate at a skirt steak last night,

31:31.540 --> 31:35.220
 you could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside.

31:35.220 --> 31:37.580
 On a ribeye, that same collagen sheath is this big.

31:37.580 --> 31:38.420
 There's only one.

31:38.420 --> 31:39.260
 It goes around the outside, okay?

31:39.260 --> 31:42.900
 Cause it's just that muscle, there's one large muscle fiber.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.900
 So that specific, it's a myelin sheath, right?

31:46.900 --> 31:48.900
 That material needs moisture

31:48.900 --> 31:51.540
 and low and slow heat to become tender.

31:51.540 --> 31:54.020
 The other side of that is that when it becomes tender,

31:54.020 --> 31:56.820
 it liquefies and it adds all this beautiful

31:56.820 --> 31:58.540
 gelatinous consistency.

31:58.540 --> 31:59.660
 That's what bone broth is.

31:59.660 --> 32:03.980
 That's why like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious.

32:03.980 --> 32:05.780
 It's not that it's full of all that fat.

32:05.780 --> 32:06.620
 That fat's also great.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.540
 But a lot of that mouthfeel comes from that really

32:09.540 --> 32:12.540
 beautiful dissolved collagen.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.380
 So when you're looking at like,

32:13.380 --> 32:15.620
 how do I understand how I'm gonna cook a piece of meat?

32:15.620 --> 32:17.540
 That first fork in the road is,

32:17.540 --> 32:20.140
 how is this gonna respond to heat?

32:20.140 --> 32:23.220
 And what's the appropriate cooking technique?

32:23.220 --> 32:27.300
 Then the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio.

32:27.300 --> 32:30.500
 And that's important because the heat is gonna impact

32:30.500 --> 32:32.900
 the meat through the surfaces of the meat

32:32.900 --> 32:34.620
 that are in contact with the heat.

32:34.620 --> 32:39.620
 So if I have a steak that's three inches thick,

32:39.620 --> 32:42.700
 I'm gonna cook it extremely differently from a steak

32:42.700 --> 32:46.300
 that's a half inch thick or three quarters of an inch thick.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.180
 And that's the major, and that's the truth.

32:48.180 --> 32:51.780
 If I have a piece of pork shoulder that's cut into cubes

32:51.780 --> 32:53.860
 versus having a whole pork shoulder,

32:53.860 --> 32:55.420
 that surface area to volume ratio,

32:55.420 --> 32:58.060
 that's gonna totally change how I cook it.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.620
 And same things like pot roast and a beef stew

33:01.620 --> 33:03.620
 would be the same cut of meat, right?

33:03.620 --> 33:05.500
 But how I cook them is gonna change

33:05.500 --> 33:06.820
 based on the surface area to volume.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.940
 Because you've gotta let moisture and heat

33:08.940 --> 33:11.140
 work its way into the center of the meat.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.620
 And that's gonna be determined by the amount of surface

33:13.620 --> 33:16.020
 of the meat that's in contact with whatever cooking liquid

33:16.020 --> 33:17.100
 or heat you've got.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.740
 Is there different sources of heat to play with?

33:19.740 --> 33:23.060
 Like a big flame versus a small,

33:23.060 --> 33:25.860
 or maybe even like almost no flame,

33:25.860 --> 33:27.420
 like over coals, all that kind of stuff.

33:27.420 --> 33:30.900
 Is there some science to the source of heat

33:30.900 --> 33:32.740
 in how it plays with the meat?

33:32.740 --> 33:35.340
 Well, there's indirect heat and direct heat.

33:35.340 --> 33:39.420
 And that really is mostly about temperature

33:39.420 --> 33:43.060
 in more than actual, I mean, smoke is important as well

33:43.060 --> 33:44.580
 that can permeate, but really the smoke

33:44.580 --> 33:46.740
 doesn't go into the center of most cuts that you barbecue.

33:46.740 --> 33:48.180
 It'll come in like the smoke ring.

33:48.180 --> 33:52.220
 It's a maximum like half an inch on the outside,

33:52.220 --> 33:54.620
 maybe a little bit deeper on a really long, slow cook.

33:54.620 --> 33:58.300
 So they, but the smoke, that does create a ton of flavor

33:58.300 --> 33:59.820
 on the surface of the meat.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.300
 But that's, so the indirect allows you to have

34:02.300 --> 34:04.660
 smoke contacting it and then a very,

34:04.660 --> 34:06.260
 very low and slow heat.

34:06.260 --> 34:11.260
 And what that does is indirect heat will be low

34:11.820 --> 34:15.460
 and slow enough that the center of the meat will get warm

34:15.460 --> 34:17.580
 at the same time as the exterior of the meat.

34:17.580 --> 34:21.300
 And it'll all cook equally and all get equally tender.

34:22.180 --> 34:23.460
 If you go very hot and fast,

34:23.460 --> 34:26.580
 you risk the interior of the meat not getting right.

34:26.580 --> 34:28.860
 You kind of create a shell on the, on it.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.660
 And you slow down the interior of the meat,

34:30.660 --> 34:32.020
 which you actually want to do with something

34:32.020 --> 34:35.340
 like a steak where you want to keep it rare on the inside.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.380
 So it's really indirect versus direct.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.380
 Then once you get into direct heat, right,

34:39.380 --> 34:43.780
 look at in that category, there's wood, charcoal, gas,

34:43.780 --> 34:44.900
 right, that's about it.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.420
 And those are meaningfully different.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.700
 They're meaningfully different.

34:48.700 --> 34:50.740
 Charcoal and wood, that's more of,

34:50.740 --> 34:52.340
 there's more poetry and wood.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.300
 There's a little bit more flavor,

34:54.300 --> 34:56.100
 not functionally very different,

34:56.100 --> 34:59.220
 but gas versus charcoal wood is very different.

34:59.220 --> 35:02.260
 And that's because of the actual scent of the,

35:02.260 --> 35:04.540
 of the cook, right, the scent of the flavor.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.900
 And then there's a,

35:06.900 --> 35:09.300
 I think an evenness of heat distribution

35:09.300 --> 35:11.980
 that comes off of charcoal that's different from gas,

35:11.980 --> 35:13.780
 because no matter how awesome your gas grill is,

35:13.780 --> 35:16.380
 you do have hotter and cooler spots.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.020
 So gas grills are typically,

35:18.020 --> 35:19.460
 you can kind of control for that

35:19.460 --> 35:21.620
 if you just are going really hot and fast,

35:21.620 --> 35:22.980
 which is why gas grills are fine

35:22.980 --> 35:24.500
 if you're just like throwing that steak on,

35:24.500 --> 35:26.660
 get a hard sear on it, those burgers put a crust on it.

35:26.660 --> 35:27.780
 Gas is fabulous for that.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.780
 It's perfect.

35:28.780 --> 35:30.740
 When you're doing things that do better

35:30.740 --> 35:33.220
 with a low and slow cook,

35:33.220 --> 35:36.540
 like let's say a whole tenderloin or chicken thigh,

35:36.540 --> 35:39.980
 that's going to be a little bit less elegant on gas

35:39.980 --> 35:41.540
 than on charcoal versus wood.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.380
 So when you have more,

35:42.380 --> 35:44.980
 more kind of nuance in the low, slow cook

35:44.980 --> 35:46.580
 over the natural fuels.

35:46.580 --> 35:50.700
 Talking about like smoke and flame and charcoal versus gas,

35:52.100 --> 35:54.740
 it also adds to the experience and the smell

35:54.740 --> 35:57.660
 and the whole thing of the cooking,

35:57.660 --> 36:00.020
 like versus just like the taste it creates.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.420
 There's a certain experience too,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.140
 like when there's a bit of smoke,

36:03.140 --> 36:04.660
 maybe I don't know what the chemistry of it is,

36:04.660 --> 36:05.940
 but I feel like with smoke,

36:05.940 --> 36:07.980
 the smell is distributed more effectively.

36:07.980 --> 36:08.820
 I don't know if that's true,

36:08.820 --> 36:13.820
 but there's a smell and a visual aspect to the experience

36:13.820 --> 36:15.900
 that's almost enriched with a bit of smoke

36:15.900 --> 36:18.980
 or like an open flame.

36:18.980 --> 36:21.540
 Like if you can see the flame, there's magic to that.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.300
 And it goes to the experience piece

36:23.300 --> 36:24.140
 that we were talking about before.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.940
 We were talking exactly about that,

36:25.940 --> 36:29.500
 like the nuance and the beauty of like that long, slow cook

36:29.500 --> 36:31.220
 and your house smelling like something.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.220
 Why do people freak out about barbecue?

36:33.220 --> 36:34.180
 Yeah.

36:34.180 --> 36:35.020
 Why?

36:35.020 --> 36:36.460
 Because you go in and it smells bomb.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.140
 It smells so good.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.660
 It smells like heaven, right?

36:39.660 --> 36:42.900
 It smells fatty and delicious and the smells everywhere

36:42.900 --> 36:44.540
 and everyone's smelling the same smell.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.860
 So there's like this collective experience.

36:46.860 --> 36:47.980
 It's incredible.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.980
 That's, I mean, I think that's why barbecue

36:49.980 --> 36:52.300
 is so sticky for people.

36:52.300 --> 36:53.700
 It's like so yummy

36:53.700 --> 36:56.620
 and you get this huge like anticipatory thing about it.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.700
 It's like, cause it smells incredible.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.780
 What was that incredible grill that we used yesterday?

37:00.780 --> 37:01.620
 What is that about?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.220
 That's called a Sea Island Forge.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.660
 It's a wood fire grill that's inspired

37:05.660 --> 37:07.700
 by like a South American style of cooking.

37:07.700 --> 37:08.780
 So it's like, it's big.

37:08.780 --> 37:11.500
 It has also the things with the crank.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.940
 It allows you to control the distance from the flame.

37:13.940 --> 37:14.780
 It's awesome.

37:14.780 --> 37:15.860
 It's really key with the wood fire.

37:15.860 --> 37:20.380
 So when we evolved from cooking over wood to charcoal,

37:20.380 --> 37:22.940
 right, when that became more popular,

37:22.940 --> 37:25.300
 the reason that we did that is that allowed us

37:25.300 --> 37:28.620
 to skip the whole part of making our own charcoal, right?

37:28.620 --> 37:29.940
 So when you're cooking over wood,

37:29.940 --> 37:32.100
 all you're doing is making your own charcoal.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.860
 You don't ever cook over wood with the red fire.

37:34.860 --> 37:36.740
 Like we don't like throw a steak on

37:36.740 --> 37:38.540
 when the flames are orange and leaping up

37:38.540 --> 37:40.180
 because you're just gonna get, you know,

37:40.180 --> 37:42.500
 carbons like char all over your meat.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.020
 So you're, when you're cooking over wood,

37:44.020 --> 37:45.500
 you first cook down the wood,

37:45.500 --> 37:48.220
 you create the coal base, the natural coal base,

37:48.220 --> 37:49.420
 and then you cook over that.

37:49.420 --> 37:50.980
 So you saw yesterday, I built my fire,

37:50.980 --> 37:52.660
 I let it burn down, added some fresh wood

37:52.660 --> 37:56.180
 so I could reinforce my coals with new coals coming in.

37:56.180 --> 37:59.140
 But then I was actually cooking over the embers.

38:00.060 --> 38:04.340
 You shorten that cycle with charcoal, it's more efficient.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.380
 But what you lose is that whole cycle of, you know,

38:07.380 --> 38:10.500
 that really beautiful experience of smelling.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.100
 Now, if you're cooking on a Traeger,

38:12.100 --> 38:13.500
 you're gonna get awesome smoke smell.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.820
 You know, like there's plenty of ways to do this.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.020
 It doesn't always have to be wood fire.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.820
 And I love all the different ways, right?

38:19.820 --> 38:23.460
 But I really like the experience of the campfire.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.300
 And I love that kind of just like sitting by it,

38:25.300 --> 38:26.740
 building it, having to take the time.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.620
 I like building the fire, going inside,

38:28.620 --> 38:31.140
 preparing all my meats, bringing them out, cooking them.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.060
 That whole experience start to finish

38:33.060 --> 38:36.180
 is really just like something that it's my favorite.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.620
 It's my favorite way to spend time, you know?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.060
 So I think, and why is that?

38:40.060 --> 38:41.700
 Is the food that different than cooking it

38:41.700 --> 38:43.500
 in a more conventional grill?

38:43.500 --> 38:45.980
 Probably not, you know, like in a pure experience.

38:45.980 --> 38:48.860
 But I think the actual experience is super memorable

38:48.860 --> 38:51.340
 because you are outside, you are still in your role.

38:51.340 --> 38:54.660
 You're enjoying this, you know, you're just taking in,

38:54.660 --> 38:56.700
 you're watching, you're anticipating.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.740
 I love that whole experience.

38:58.740 --> 39:03.580
 Does the origin of the meat itself make a difference?

39:03.580 --> 39:05.580
 So we're here at Belcampo Farms

39:05.580 --> 39:10.220
 and we'll, maybe you could talk about what your vision,

39:10.220 --> 39:14.580
 your dream is in terms of like food,

39:14.580 --> 39:16.820
 in terms of where food comes from,

39:16.820 --> 39:19.140
 where meat comes from, but food broadly,

39:19.140 --> 39:23.340
 and how that affects the entirety of the culinary journey.

39:25.180 --> 39:27.380
 On the question of where does it come from

39:27.380 --> 39:31.780
 and does that matter, I'd say the way that meat is raised

39:31.780 --> 39:35.540
 is massively important for flavor and for how it cooks.

39:36.420 --> 39:41.420
 I think most cooks who try cooking grass fed

39:41.940 --> 39:44.460
 versus corn fed, that's the first moment

39:44.460 --> 39:45.860
 where they realize that, right?

39:45.860 --> 39:48.900
 Where corn fed meat cooks much more slowly,

39:48.900 --> 39:53.020
 it's got bigger veins of fat that slow the heat transfer

39:53.020 --> 39:54.980
 throughout the muscle of the animal,

39:54.980 --> 39:56.580
 compared to grass fed, which is leaner,

39:56.580 --> 39:58.300
 heat moves through it more quickly,

39:58.300 --> 40:00.220
 those steaks will cook much, much faster.

40:00.220 --> 40:03.660
 So there's very kind of technical reasons why,

40:03.660 --> 40:07.220
 how meat is raised that we're aware of.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.620
 And there's other things that I've noticed,

40:09.620 --> 40:13.620
 like that slower growing poultry

40:13.620 --> 40:16.740
 has a very, very different musculature and fiber to it

40:16.740 --> 40:19.940
 than fast growing poultry, that's confinement animals.

40:19.940 --> 40:21.820
 It's just, it has to do with the way

40:21.820 --> 40:22.780
 that the muscles are built.

40:22.780 --> 40:26.060
 They tend to be finer and thinner and more tender

40:26.060 --> 40:28.020
 and a little bit more susceptible to heat.

40:28.020 --> 40:32.300
 So the character of the meat's radically different.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.020
 It's also much more flavorful

40:34.020 --> 40:35.700
 when it's grown more naturally.

40:35.700 --> 40:39.260
 And I think some of the reliance in the US

40:39.260 --> 40:42.220
 on like sugary sauces and lots of salts

40:42.220 --> 40:45.860
 and flavors and things like that's actually based

40:45.860 --> 40:50.020
 on having the broadly available meat out there

40:50.020 --> 40:51.660
 is pretty low on flavor.

40:51.660 --> 40:54.420
 And so we're adding in a lot to compensate for that.

40:54.420 --> 40:57.900
 So to your point of like enjoying things very simply

40:57.900 --> 41:01.620
 and with like salt and nothing else,

41:01.620 --> 41:03.620
 like the more flavorful that product is,

41:03.620 --> 41:06.540
 I think the more people will find that enjoyable.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.260
 Let's paint a vision.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.420
 I mean, you're a visionary.

41:09.420 --> 41:14.420
 You have a vision to have basically meat in every store

41:14.940 --> 41:19.180
 that comes from a farm like Belcampo

41:19.180 --> 41:22.340
 that's basically doing regenerative farming.

41:22.340 --> 41:24.140
 How do we get there?

41:24.140 --> 41:27.380
 It's about a network of smaller producers

41:27.380 --> 41:31.180
 working together with shared values.

41:31.180 --> 41:36.180
 And it's true that there's a limit on regenerative farming

41:36.180 --> 41:39.980
 in that it requires more human knowledge.

41:39.980 --> 41:44.620
 So regenerative farming is more difficult to scale

41:44.620 --> 41:46.140
 in a single operation.

41:46.140 --> 41:48.140
 It'd be really challenging to have a regenerative farm

41:48.140 --> 41:50.140
 that was like 200,000 acres

41:50.140 --> 41:53.460
 because of the amount of manpower needed to pay attention.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.540
 Can you first, and I apologize to interrupt,

41:55.540 --> 41:58.740
 but can you say what is regenerative farming?

41:58.740 --> 41:59.740
 Sure.

41:59.740 --> 42:04.740
 So if you're looking at scaling regenerative farming,

42:04.740 --> 42:07.180
 it's a traditional system of agriculture.

42:07.180 --> 42:09.380
 Regenerative farming is how we used to farm.

42:10.780 --> 42:14.260
 We used to farm with an eye towards the longterm.

42:15.300 --> 42:19.060
 You might be on the Friedman farm thinking about your heirs

42:19.060 --> 42:22.900
 five generations from now farming that same land.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.300
 Are you gonna leave that land nutritionally empty?

42:26.300 --> 42:28.980
 No, it's a longterm thinking.

42:28.980 --> 42:32.500
 Also in traditional ag, you don't have inputs.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.740
 That are very convenient. You can put some chicken manure on,

42:35.740 --> 42:40.100
 but you can't spray or dump something that massively

42:40.100 --> 42:43.580
 increases the growing potential of the land.

42:45.300 --> 42:49.580
 That was not available until the past 60 years.

42:49.580 --> 42:54.580
 So regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming

42:54.980 --> 42:58.620
 where you're increasing soil fertility through your farming.

42:58.620 --> 43:02.460
 You increase soil fertility by feeding the soil.

43:02.460 --> 43:04.940
 You feed the soil through carbon.

43:06.380 --> 43:08.100
 That's why regenerative farming is better

43:08.100 --> 43:08.940
 for the environment.

43:08.940 --> 43:12.020
 It sequesters carbon and puts carbon into the soil.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.620
 Now it's interesting.

43:14.620 --> 43:18.620
 Plants need carbon and put it into the soil

43:18.620 --> 43:20.420
 when they're going through growth.

43:21.460 --> 43:23.620
 So if you have a beautiful field of grass

43:23.620 --> 43:25.220
 that's just waving in the wind,

43:25.220 --> 43:26.620
 that's where you're gonna get the most

43:26.620 --> 43:28.820
 of the carbon that's going into the soil.

43:28.820 --> 43:30.740
 That's not sequestering as much carbon

43:30.740 --> 43:34.620
 as plants that have been damaged and are regrowing.

43:34.620 --> 43:36.420
 Plants that have been damaged and are regrowing

43:36.420 --> 43:38.580
 are repairing and they're doing that

43:38.580 --> 43:41.340
 by drawing down carbon as one of the nutrients

43:41.340 --> 43:42.180
 that feeds them.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.300
 To damage the plants effectively,

43:45.300 --> 43:47.780
 that's what we're doing with regenerative grazing.

43:49.300 --> 43:53.700
 So the cows or, you know, lambs or whatever out there,

43:53.700 --> 43:57.540
 they're eating and taking the grass down

43:57.540 --> 43:59.700
 and that then cause a regrowth cycle

43:59.700 --> 44:01.180
 that sequesters carbon.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.020
 Wow.

44:02.020 --> 44:02.860
 There's a limit to it.

44:02.860 --> 44:03.700
 There's an edge,

44:03.700 --> 44:05.780
 because if those plants are so damaged

44:05.780 --> 44:07.180
 that they can't regrow,

44:07.180 --> 44:08.620
 then it turns into a dirt patch

44:08.620 --> 44:10.220
 and that doesn't sequester any carbon.

44:10.220 --> 44:11.220
 So it's a balance.

44:11.220 --> 44:13.300
 How do you find that balance?

44:13.300 --> 44:15.860
 That has to do with like the frequency

44:15.860 --> 44:18.020
 and the scale of the grazing essentially?

44:18.020 --> 44:19.460
 Exactly.

44:19.460 --> 44:20.860
 And so you have to find the right balance

44:20.860 --> 44:24.340
 and that connects to both the grass.

44:24.340 --> 44:27.100
 I mean, is the ultimately the focus here

44:27.100 --> 44:30.100
 is on the life cycle of whatever is grazing,

44:30.100 --> 44:32.740
 whether it's cows or lambs or so on?

44:32.740 --> 44:34.540
 That's why the scalability question.

44:34.540 --> 44:37.220
 So all that stuff that I just talked about,

44:37.220 --> 44:39.740
 like think about all the actions that that requires.

44:39.740 --> 44:42.500
 Somebody's out there looking and paying attention

44:42.500 --> 44:45.540
 and understanding how far the grass is,

44:45.540 --> 44:47.980
 remembering what happened in that field last year.

44:47.980 --> 44:50.380
 There's a huge human intelligence need

44:50.380 --> 44:55.380
 and human kind of availability of attention.

44:55.820 --> 44:58.820
 Now, industrial farming has done a great job

44:58.820 --> 45:00.860
 at de skilling agriculture.

45:03.180 --> 45:05.020
 Industrial farming has taken agriculture

45:05.020 --> 45:09.420
 from being art science to being entry level employment.

45:10.980 --> 45:11.820
 Yeah.

45:11.820 --> 45:13.740
 So that's the limiting factor on regen

45:13.740 --> 45:14.580
 and that's why I think...

45:14.580 --> 45:15.900
 It's a human intelligence piece.

45:15.900 --> 45:16.820
 Exactly.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.100
 I gotta ask,

45:18.100 --> 45:19.540
 I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff.

45:19.540 --> 45:20.540
 I mentioned to you offline

45:20.540 --> 45:23.020
 that I spent a bit of time with some robots

45:23.020 --> 45:24.100
 and Boston Dynamics.

45:24.100 --> 45:25.180
 Do you think there's a way

45:25.180 --> 45:27.620
 to use artificial intelligence to help?

45:27.620 --> 45:29.100
 So data collection,

45:29.100 --> 45:33.820
 so automating some of the things that makes humans special,

45:33.820 --> 45:34.940
 make some of that decision,

45:34.940 --> 45:36.600
 some of that memory that's then utilized,

45:36.600 --> 45:38.380
 converges to knowledge to make decisions

45:38.380 --> 45:39.980
 about the crops and so on.

45:39.980 --> 45:41.940
 Is there a way AI can help?

45:41.940 --> 45:42.760
 Do you think?

45:42.760 --> 45:43.600
 Totally.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.780
 I mean, that would be incredible.

45:45.780 --> 45:47.180
 That's one of the ingredients

45:47.180 --> 45:48.620
 that could help with the regenerative farming.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.940
 A number of discrete decision points

45:50.940 --> 45:54.740
 that could completely be automated as well

45:54.740 --> 45:56.700
 in order to supplement and work with somebody,

45:56.700 --> 45:58.660
 like a farmer in managing it,

45:58.660 --> 46:01.300
 about the performance on land.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.660
 And a bit of that's being done right now

46:02.660 --> 46:04.820
 with some aerial mapping,

46:04.820 --> 46:07.900
 but that type of AI would be huge in this.

46:07.900 --> 46:11.780
 I mean, there's estimates that if the damage

46:11.780 --> 46:14.100
 and underutilized rangeland in the world

46:14.100 --> 46:15.900
 was converted to regenerative agriculture

46:15.900 --> 46:19.300
 somewhere between like 20 and 40% of the world's carbon

46:19.300 --> 46:20.620
 could be sequestered.

46:20.620 --> 46:22.480
 So there's a huge potential.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.840
 The problem is cultural.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.660
 We've like lost the generational thread of knowledge

46:29.660 --> 46:30.740
 about how to do this.

46:30.740 --> 46:31.900
 It's kind of been two generations

46:31.900 --> 46:34.140
 that haven't farmed this way.

46:34.140 --> 46:38.020
 Also the science around it is limited

46:38.020 --> 46:40.460
 by the scale and longevity.

46:40.460 --> 46:43.060
 So the data collection around regenerative farming

46:43.060 --> 46:45.980
 is also limited by the fact it's kind of piecemeal.

46:45.980 --> 46:48.040
 There's small operations that are doing it.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.160
 They're learning and developing as they go,

46:50.160 --> 46:51.620
 and they haven't been documenting it

46:51.620 --> 46:53.460
 and doing it for too long.

46:53.460 --> 46:55.780
 Is the ethical treatment of animals

46:55.780 --> 46:58.760
 a part of regenerative farming?

46:58.760 --> 47:01.620
 So in the way you do things at Belcampo,

47:01.620 --> 47:02.660
 that's a huge part.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.700
 Is that necessarily part of the life cycle?

47:05.700 --> 47:08.100
 So like the things that you're trying to measure

47:08.100 --> 47:13.100
 is like the way, like not damaging the land too much,

47:13.980 --> 47:16.420
 make sure that the sort of the land

47:16.420 --> 47:17.980
 is constantly healthy and is producing,

47:17.980 --> 47:20.340
 and then the grazing process,

47:20.340 --> 47:22.300
 and also the carbon piece,

47:22.300 --> 47:25.760
 the fact that it's a carbon neutral or something like that.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.780
 I mean, are all of those pieces of the regenerative farming

47:28.780 --> 47:31.500
 or is this an extra part to your vision

47:31.500 --> 47:32.340
 that you're thinking about?

47:32.340 --> 47:34.140
 It's all implicit and regenerative.

47:34.140 --> 47:37.380
 I call it out separately because we are certified humane,

47:37.380 --> 47:38.860
 which is another layer of welfare

47:38.860 --> 47:41.600
 that has to do with density and a couple other things.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.060
 But regenerative, I mean, think about it.

47:44.060 --> 47:46.020
 If you're a cow and you're in a regenerative operation

47:46.020 --> 47:49.140
 where the whole life cycle of the pasture

47:49.140 --> 47:52.540
 means that you only eat the top six inches of the grass,

47:52.540 --> 47:54.460
 and then when there's whatever, a couple inches left,

47:54.460 --> 47:56.360
 then that field is left dormant.

47:56.360 --> 47:58.060
 That's a better experience, right?

47:58.060 --> 48:00.100
 So just think about it kind of functionally that way.

48:00.100 --> 48:02.820
 Well, grazing period is a better experience, right?

48:02.820 --> 48:05.560
 And that's not what's done in,

48:05.560 --> 48:06.980
 I mean, that's the grass fed piece, right?

48:06.980 --> 48:11.980
 That's the other piece with certified organics, amazing.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.620
 There's plenty of certifications

48:14.620 --> 48:17.500
 that grass fed and finished is also great,

48:17.500 --> 48:19.140
 but there are workarounds for those.

48:19.140 --> 48:21.300
 You can have certified organic feedlots.

48:21.300 --> 48:22.760
 You can have grass fed and finished,

48:22.760 --> 48:25.880
 which is an animal fed a grass seed pellet.

48:26.860 --> 48:29.020
 Those aren't things that we do here, right?

48:29.020 --> 48:30.800
 And regenerative captures that.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.660
 Because if you're, it's like anything,

48:32.660 --> 48:35.540
 you're isolating these very specific certifications,

48:35.540 --> 48:37.580
 it doesn't have a holistic approach.

48:37.580 --> 48:40.220
 Regenerative though, unfortunately, isn't certified yet.

48:40.220 --> 48:42.760
 We've gotten USDA approval to use that word

48:42.760 --> 48:45.140
 based on our carbon sequestration data,

48:45.140 --> 48:47.780
 but it's not a regulated term.

48:47.780 --> 48:49.540
 So that's kind of the mix right now

48:49.540 --> 48:51.540
 is to figure out how to document it.

48:51.540 --> 48:53.780
 And it's not totally clear what it means

48:53.780 --> 48:56.700
 like for pigs and chickens, which are omnivores.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.140
 It's very clear for ruminants,

48:58.140 --> 49:01.020
 which are animals that have a rumen that eat grass.

49:01.020 --> 49:03.500
 For omnivores, which is like what we are,

49:03.500 --> 49:05.980
 they eat primarily grain in farming operations,

49:05.980 --> 49:07.740
 and that's a little bit more complex.

49:07.740 --> 49:09.380
 So it's kind of a moving landscape,

49:09.380 --> 49:13.820
 but regenerative as a word is the better definition

49:13.820 --> 49:15.320
 of the whole life cycle approach

49:15.320 --> 49:18.060
 of letting animals and nature work together.

49:18.060 --> 49:20.880
 Is it true that it's possible to have a farm

49:20.880 --> 49:25.300
 that doesn't produce, sort of is carbon neutral?

49:25.300 --> 49:28.540
 We have been third party verified

49:28.540 --> 49:31.060
 to be carbon impact negative.

49:31.060 --> 49:34.300
 So Belcampo's 25,000 acres and the animals here,

49:36.300 --> 49:38.620
 all of the carbon, including from our shipping

49:38.620 --> 49:40.860
 on our mail order is all offset

49:40.860 --> 49:43.300
 by the amount of grazing that's happening.

49:43.300 --> 49:45.100
 Also that encompasses our partner farms.

49:45.100 --> 49:49.040
 We buy a number of live animals in from other partner farms.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.060
 That's their impacts also incorporated in that.

49:51.060 --> 49:52.900
 I mean, first of all, that's incredible.

49:52.900 --> 49:55.100
 And second of all, is that possible to scale?

49:55.100 --> 49:57.460
 I don't see why it isn't.

49:57.460 --> 50:00.580
 I mean, it's complex to scale,

50:00.580 --> 50:02.540
 but I mean, we're putting people on the moon

50:02.540 --> 50:04.780
 and you have a robotic dog.

50:04.780 --> 50:05.620
 I mean.

50:05.620 --> 50:09.940
 But that's less about scale, that's more about innovation.

50:09.940 --> 50:12.660
 So like in many ways what Belcampo has done

50:12.660 --> 50:14.460
 is innovative at a small scale.

50:14.460 --> 50:16.460
 The question is whether that innovation can be scaled.

50:16.460 --> 50:20.100
 That's where I feel like we in the industry need more help.

50:20.100 --> 50:23.140
 You know, the AI piece, the intelligence,

50:23.140 --> 50:27.500
 the thinking about ways to do things differently

50:27.500 --> 50:29.220
 is where we need more support.

50:29.220 --> 50:31.460
 And I think it's been a, you know,

50:31.460 --> 50:36.460
 a kind of a swing in the past couple of years

50:37.100 --> 50:40.620
 where it's like meat's a mess, it's terrible.

50:40.620 --> 50:44.180
 So let's ditch meat and opt for these hyper process,

50:44.180 --> 50:46.580
 you know, plant based solutions.

50:46.580 --> 50:50.540
 And I am saying there's a way to make meat

50:50.540 --> 50:52.460
 a part of the solution.

50:52.460 --> 50:54.580
 And it's gonna mean eating less of it.

50:54.580 --> 50:56.100
 It's gonna mean paying more for it.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.460
 It's gonna mean that the farming systems

50:57.460 --> 50:59.000
 are more complicated.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.580
 It's not the easiest path,

51:00.580 --> 51:03.200
 but I think in the long term it's the better path.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.340
 And it's also better for human health.

51:05.340 --> 51:07.860
 Can you comment on the certified humane piece?

51:07.860 --> 51:11.220
 So how do you run a farm?

51:11.220 --> 51:13.980
 Like what does it mean to raise an animal

51:13.980 --> 51:17.020
 from the beginning of its life to the end of its life

51:17.020 --> 51:18.980
 in a way that's ethical, that's humane?

51:18.980 --> 51:22.740
 I think the first piece you need to just be comfortable with

51:22.740 --> 51:27.000
 is that making an animal into meat, you know,

51:27.000 --> 51:28.620
 is something that you're comfortable with.

51:28.620 --> 51:30.820
 Cause I think that's the biggest question, right?

51:30.820 --> 51:34.180
 And so certified humane actually goes all the way through

51:34.180 --> 51:35.360
 the death of the animal,

51:35.360 --> 51:37.540
 how it's killed and handled at processing.

51:37.540 --> 51:39.580
 So I put that out there just to say,

51:39.580 --> 51:43.700
 well, this is all about producing an animal to die for meat.

51:43.700 --> 51:45.300
 And that's not necessarily,

51:45.300 --> 51:47.340
 that's something people struggle with with the word humane.

51:47.340 --> 51:48.180
 And I understand that.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.780
 Like I have space and empathy for that.

51:49.780 --> 51:51.740
 It's a complicated decision.

51:51.740 --> 51:53.700
 And when you have to be comfortable with at the outset

51:53.700 --> 51:56.240
 to say, this is an animal that's gonna die to feed me.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.100
 Yeah, so we should pause on that

51:58.100 --> 52:01.940
 cause I actually just the two days ago read a paper

52:01.940 --> 52:03.980
 that argued that, you know,

52:03.980 --> 52:06.660
 the killing of an animal period cannot be humane.

52:06.660 --> 52:07.740
 So it's impossible.

52:07.740 --> 52:10.580
 And so, and that's an argument just like you're saying

52:10.580 --> 52:14.140
 we could make, but if we now on the table kind of

52:15.780 --> 52:18.940
 take as a starting point, the idea that

52:20.380 --> 52:24.020
 it's possible to kill an animal for food in an ethical way,

52:24.020 --> 52:25.780
 if we take that as a starting point.

52:25.780 --> 52:27.360
 So we won't argue about that.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.500
 It is worth arguing about it elsewhere.

52:29.500 --> 52:30.720
 And it probably will.

52:30.720 --> 52:33.180
 I will probably talk to a few vegan folks

52:33.180 --> 52:35.200
 and we'll talk about the vegan diet.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.580
 I'm fascinated by it as well.

52:36.580 --> 52:37.980
 So I'm torn in the whole thing.

52:37.980 --> 52:41.060
 But if we just take that as a starting point,

52:41.060 --> 52:45.300
 what then is an ethical humane way to treat an animal?

52:45.300 --> 52:48.240
 I look at ethical humane animal treatment

52:48.240 --> 52:51.340
 as the major phases of life.

52:51.340 --> 52:55.920
 So conception, birth and mothering,

52:55.920 --> 53:00.920
 diet, those are kind of the major touch points of life.

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
 So what we're looking at is evolutionary approach,

53:07.760 --> 53:09.480
 which means is the animal eating

53:09.480 --> 53:11.480
 what it evolved to eat primarily?

53:12.340 --> 53:15.480
 Is the animal primarily outdoors,

53:15.480 --> 53:18.140
 which is how all animals evolved,

53:18.140 --> 53:20.160
 given when the climate's appropriate for it.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.520
 There's certain times when you can't have animals

53:22.520 --> 53:24.360
 fully outdoors, like here on our ranch,

53:24.360 --> 53:28.320
 we have had issues with cold weather and things.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.840
 But so if you have appropriate weather conditions,

53:31.840 --> 53:33.600
 does the animal outdoors?

53:33.600 --> 53:37.080
 Is the animal able to nurture and engage with its young?

53:37.080 --> 53:38.680
 Those are the kind of key touch points,

53:38.680 --> 53:40.560
 but it's really the birth of it.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.400
 Let me start this one from the scratch.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.400
 Okay, so when I'm looking at,

53:45.400 --> 53:47.120
 or when I consider what's humane,

53:47.120 --> 53:48.920
 setting aside the death part,

53:48.920 --> 53:51.480
 I look at the evolutionary diet,

53:51.480 --> 53:54.160
 access to the outdoors,

53:55.240 --> 53:59.500
 and ideally spending the majority of its life outdoors,

53:59.500 --> 54:02.300
 low density, so animals spread out,

54:03.160 --> 54:07.320
 and engagement with young, social interactions,

54:07.320 --> 54:08.160
 and that's all kind of simplistic.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.600
 Social interaction is a cool one.

54:09.600 --> 54:12.200
 I mean, I also read an article that like,

54:12.200 --> 54:16.560
 cows, for example, have social, like they have friends.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.960
 Yeah, yeah.

54:17.960 --> 54:18.800
 That's fascinating.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.640
 I mean, that piece with the young,

54:20.640 --> 54:21.700
 social interaction with young,

54:21.700 --> 54:23.600
 social interaction with each other,

54:23.600 --> 54:25.400
 that at a basic level,

54:25.400 --> 54:28.080
 I'm sure that interaction is not as rich as humans,

54:28.080 --> 54:31.680
 but that piece seems to be part of the humane picture.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.280
 And you said also, just a quick comment,

54:34.280 --> 54:37.520
 evolutionary diet, meaning the diet

54:37.520 --> 54:40.120
 that they were evolved to have.

54:40.120 --> 54:41.700
 And that's pretty simple.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.960
 You can look at the physiology of the animal

54:43.960 --> 54:45.180
 and figure that out.

54:45.180 --> 54:48.680
 So ruminant species are lamb, goats, and beef,

54:48.680 --> 54:50.980
 and they have five stomachs.

54:50.980 --> 54:55.200
 They evolved eating really low calorie, high fiber foods.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.720
 That's why they've got all the stomachs.

54:56.720 --> 54:58.000
 They need a lot of processing.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.920
 You or I were to eat grass, we die in a week, right?

55:00.920 --> 55:02.580
 Our physiology can't handle it.

55:02.580 --> 55:05.920
 Cows were built and evolved to eat this very low calorie,

55:05.920 --> 55:08.800
 very high fiber, very low density food.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.760
 And they walk around slowly,

55:10.760 --> 55:13.500
 they're moving constantly and they're eating it.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.760
 When we put them on a corn fed diet,

55:15.760 --> 55:17.840
 that's the opposite of their evolutionary diet

55:17.840 --> 55:19.880
 and their systems really struggle with it.

55:19.880 --> 55:22.260
 Now, pigs and chickens are different.

55:22.260 --> 55:23.840
 Pigs and chickens are omnivores

55:24.720 --> 55:29.720
 and pigs will happily eat chickens, for example.

55:30.620 --> 55:33.520
 Our pigs on the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes

55:33.520 --> 55:34.360
 and eat them.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.360
 They enjoy all of it.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.680
 They're omnivores.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.040
 So that you often see,

55:42.040 --> 55:45.240
 and I've seen people try to raise like a grass fed chicken

55:45.240 --> 55:46.880
 and that doesn't exist.

55:46.880 --> 55:50.000
 I mean, they need a higher, omnivores eat everything.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.400
 They're what's called monogastric.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.080
 They got one stomach

55:53.080 --> 55:56.320
 and that one stomach needs higher density nutrients.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.360
 So in the case of chicken,

55:58.360 --> 56:02.200
 if you're to do, look back in American history

56:02.200 --> 56:04.080
 and in the 1950s, it took,

56:04.080 --> 56:05.920
 commercial chickens took like 54 weeks

56:05.920 --> 56:07.680
 to come to full weight.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.540
 Now it's two and a half weeks in confinement farming

56:10.540 --> 56:14.160
 on our systems, it's like eight to 10 weeks typically.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.280
 So it's a very,

56:15.280 --> 56:17.680
 you have to give them some amount of nutrient density,

56:17.680 --> 56:20.640
 but there's the idea that no grain,

56:20.640 --> 56:22.760
 because that's a misinformation

56:22.760 --> 56:25.200
 for any type of commercial operation,

56:25.200 --> 56:27.500
 free range, regenerative, pastured, everything,

56:27.500 --> 56:30.440
 you're gonna have to have a grain feed to get any type of,

56:30.440 --> 56:32.320
 it's actually, I think for the case of chickens,

56:32.320 --> 56:34.460
 unless you're in a place with like tons of natural seeds

56:34.460 --> 56:36.640
 and grubs and worms and stuff to eat,

56:36.640 --> 56:38.420
 really challenging for the chicken.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.040
 So you gotta give them some high density,

56:40.040 --> 56:41.680
 high calorie food different from that.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.600
 That's the evolutionary diet is a really key thing.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.680
 That's the fundamental thing for health.

56:46.680 --> 56:47.640
 And it's also interesting

56:47.640 --> 56:51.120
 because the evolutionary diet ties to human health.

56:51.120 --> 56:52.720
 I've looked at the nutritional analysis

56:52.720 --> 56:55.840
 on all of our products and it's,

56:55.840 --> 57:00.840
 the evolutionary diet is for the case of beef and lamb

57:01.440 --> 57:03.880
 gets their omega three to six ratios,

57:03.880 --> 57:05.160
 the same as wild game.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.640
 So it's not like beef is really radically different

57:08.640 --> 57:11.500
 from elk, a ruminant species, right?

57:11.500 --> 57:14.560
 If you feed beef an evolutionary diet,

57:14.560 --> 57:16.680
 their nutritional profile is the same as wild meat.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.160
 There's a wild ruminant.

57:18.160 --> 57:20.380
 I got a chance to witness Neuralink,

57:20.380 --> 57:21.880
 I don't know if you're familiar with that company,

57:21.880 --> 57:23.880
 the brain computer interfaces.

57:23.880 --> 57:27.320
 And they have, I got a chance to see in person

57:27.320 --> 57:30.760
 just a bunch of pigs who had Neuralink chips implanted

57:30.760 --> 57:31.800
 and taken out.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.040
 Those pigs are so happy with life.

57:34.040 --> 57:36.240
 I don't know, I've never seen a happier animal.

57:36.240 --> 57:39.360
 I mean, cause they get to eat,

57:39.360 --> 57:42.520
 cause you were mentioning sort of diets and stuff.

57:42.520 --> 57:45.080
 Pigs seem to love a lot of stuff.

57:45.080 --> 57:47.400
 They're easily made to be happy.

57:47.400 --> 57:51.200
 I don't know if you can comment on your thoughts

57:51.200 --> 57:56.200
 of exploring the capacity of the pig mind

57:59.480 --> 58:01.520
 through some of this testing with Neuralink,

58:01.520 --> 58:02.840
 whether that's exciting to you,

58:02.840 --> 58:04.160
 whether maybe on the humane side,

58:04.160 --> 58:05.560
 it's a little bit concerning,

58:07.480 --> 58:10.180
 if there's something to be said on sort of like,

58:10.180 --> 58:14.380
 yeah, I don't know if it's even the ethical side,

58:14.380 --> 58:16.860
 but just because of your connection to meat

58:16.860 --> 58:21.180
 and to nature and understanding these living beings.

58:21.180 --> 58:22.900
 Well, pigs are incredibly intelligent.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.540
 So I'm not surprised that they're a subject matter

58:24.540 --> 58:25.980
 for Neuralink.

58:25.980 --> 58:26.900
 They're smarter than dogs

58:26.900 --> 58:28.700
 and they're empathetic and emotional.

58:29.660 --> 58:33.060
 And we'll go look at our pigs afterwards and see,

58:33.060 --> 58:36.260
 but they're kind of like joyful and exuberant

58:36.260 --> 58:37.900
 when they're in good health.

58:37.900 --> 58:41.120
 And so that makes sense.

58:41.120 --> 58:43.720
 I'm interested and open.

58:43.720 --> 58:48.720
 I feel that the kind of bleeding edge agriculture movement

58:50.780 --> 58:53.280
 that I'm on the edge of in some ways,

58:53.280 --> 58:54.280
 we're a larger operator,

58:54.280 --> 58:59.260
 but we as a movement have to get into the game.

58:59.260 --> 59:01.940
 We have to move forward in a way that allows us to scale

59:01.940 --> 59:03.740
 if we wanna be viable.

59:03.740 --> 59:06.740
 So I think there has to be openness to how that can happen.

59:06.740 --> 59:09.500
 And I also think there needs to be more thoughtful

59:09.500 --> 59:13.820
 and noisy data about how regenerative ranching

59:13.820 --> 59:15.460
 can sequester carbon.

59:15.460 --> 59:18.700
 I mean, thousands of American ranches

59:18.700 --> 59:20.740
 are selling carbon credits right now.

59:20.740 --> 59:21.860
 The data is that valid.

59:21.860 --> 59:24.620
 And they're not selling carbon credits from like grassland

59:24.620 --> 59:26.340
 that just got a fence around it.

59:26.340 --> 59:28.140
 They're selling carbon credits for verified data

59:28.140 --> 59:31.460
 from animals assisting in carbon sequestration, right?

59:31.460 --> 59:35.620
 So there's got to be a way to get the tech community involved

59:35.620 --> 59:38.460
 in ways to help regenerative agriculture scale.

59:38.460 --> 59:39.780
 In different creative ways.

59:39.780 --> 59:41.220
 And actually, that'd be interesting

59:41.220 --> 59:43.220
 if like Neuralink somehow has,

59:43.220 --> 59:45.180
 and especially because Elon Musk is involved

59:45.180 --> 59:48.880
 and Kimball Musk has his whole effort and appreciation

59:48.880 --> 59:51.080
 of regenerative agriculture

59:51.080 --> 59:54.940
 that I wonder if Neuralink has a role to play,

59:54.940 --> 59:59.720
 like exploring the neurobiology of the animal,

59:59.720 --> 1:00:01.620
 if that somehow will create innovations

1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:06.620
 that lead to improved scaling of regenerative agriculture.

1:00:08.340 --> 1:00:09.180
 That'd be interesting.

1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:10.200
 But you're saying you should be open

1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:11.040
 to all those possibilities.

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.900
 I don't think, I don't know the landscape to know what.

1:00:13.900 --> 1:00:16.060
 But my sense is that it's very hard.

1:00:17.020 --> 1:00:17.840
 It's very hard.

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:19.940
 And our farming operation to scale,

1:00:19.940 --> 1:00:22.240
 it's been incredibly complex and challenging.

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:24.380
 We now work with partner farms.

1:00:24.380 --> 1:00:27.180
 I see their operations, they're incredibly complex.

1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:28.920
 You know, it just seems like there's got to be a way

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:31.860
 to make some of these things simpler and easier

1:00:31.860 --> 1:00:32.860
 to share information.

1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:33.960
 Yeah.

1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:36.060
 I don't know what that answer is.

1:00:36.060 --> 1:00:37.220
 You know what would be cool

1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:39.720
 is if we can understand deeper ways

1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:42.900
 to measure the happiness of an animal.

1:00:42.900 --> 1:00:44.500
 Because then we can optimize,

1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:47.180
 like certified humane could be literally

1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:48.180
 an optimization problem.

1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:51.500
 Just make sure, as opposed to kind of using our,

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:53.560
 projecting our own human values,

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.140
 actually measuring what the animal is happy doing.

1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:58.720
 That could be, so understanding the pig brain

1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:00.860
 might help us understand pig happiness

1:01:00.860 --> 1:01:04.540
 and reframe what it means for a happy animal.

1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:07.100
 And then maybe it's a lot easier to make a happy animal,

1:01:07.100 --> 1:01:09.860
 to make the animal happy than we think.

1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:12.140
 And it might have to do with a variety of delicious food

1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:13.700
 in the case of the pig.

1:01:13.700 --> 1:01:16.380
 Is there something you could say about grass fed meat?

1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:18.940
 Is it all, just out of my own sort of curiosity,

1:01:18.940 --> 1:01:21.620
 whenever people say sort of grass fed meat

1:01:21.620 --> 1:01:22.460
 is better for you,

1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:24.940
 are all grass fed meat made the same?

1:01:24.940 --> 1:01:26.180
 Is there different like,

1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:29.400
 it's like the word organic.

1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:31.640
 Is there a lot of variety within that?

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:32.800
 Like the way Belcampo does it,

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:34.160
 will the others do it?

1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.360
 Just more color if you could add to this whole word

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:39.200
 and what it means.

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:43.160
 Grass fed beef has been on grass its entire life.

1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:45.340
 And you wanna look for the words 100% grass fed

1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:47.320
 or grass fed and finished.

1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.320
 Now, the challenge with feeding beef grass its whole life

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:55.560
 is that it gains weight more slowly.

1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.240
 Although beef didn't evolve,

1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:02.560
 eating corn and things, it can eat them.

1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:05.920
 And in eating them, it gains weight more rapidly

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:10.680
 and has like a version of like an inflammatory response.

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.000
 If you actually look inside the rumen of the animal

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:14.840
 inside the stomach,

1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:18.040
 it's like black and shiny inside compared to grass fed

1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:20.240
 animals like greens, smells like compost.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:22.480
 So the animals themselves, their whole physiology

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.560
 is damaged by that food,

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:26.480
 but they also gain weight really quickly

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:27.680
 and they put on a lot of fats.

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.400
 Like if you or me were to eat a bunch of processed food

1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:32.120
 compared to eating a bunch of greens,

1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.720
 it's the same impact, you're gonna blow up.

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:37.080
 So the problem for grass fed

1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:39.880
 is getting the animals to gain weight.

1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:41.560
 They're getting a ton of exercise,

1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:43.440
 they're eating really clean, right?

1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:45.320
 And they're super chill.

1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:49.240
 So that's different from the animals that are kept still

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:52.200
 eating really nutrient dense foods

1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:55.640
 and under a ton of stress, which is a confinement animal.

1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:59.280
 So are all grass fed meats created the same?

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.640
 The diet, yeah, nutritional profile broadly,

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.560
 but the length of time that the animal lives

1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:08.760
 is extremely important for the flavor of the meat.

1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:14.560
 We're taking our beef to 24 to 26 months,

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:16.560
 conventional is around 18 months.

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.360
 So I'm always looking,

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:20.080
 and if you're evaluating grass fed animals,

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:22.360
 you wanna get animals that are typically

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:23.640
 allowed to live for longer

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:24.960
 because their flavor is gonna be better,

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.600
 there's gonna be a bit more fat

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:31.600
 and their omega ratios also vary very differently.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.040
 And I've seen omega ratios,

1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:37.480
 in our firm everywhere from one to three to one to one,

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:39.800
 ideal is one to one game is typically one to one

1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:42.000
 or one to two omega three to sixes.

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.800
 But in operations where you don't have year round grass,

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:46.720
 it's more complicated, you know, you're feeding hay

1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.720
 and you don't get that three to six ratio.

1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:51.640
 Omega threes come from green grass,

1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:53.720
 they're the fat in greens.

1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:56.760
 And so they're scarce and costly, right?

1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:59.320
 So you can have grass fed and finished animals

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:00.480
 that don't have that perfect ratio

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:02.800
 because maybe they're in a climate or for whatever reasons,

1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:05.560
 we've had to do it too, during the droughts do hay finishing,

1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.560
 it's not optimal, it changes the ratio a bit.

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:10.160
 So there's a little bit of variance within it.

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:14.000
 I'd say though, the variance is a little bit higher

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.480
 the variance within grass fed is still small

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:20.480
 compared to the variance between conventional

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:21.880
 and grass fed, right?

1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:24.520
 So there's definitely things to look for within it,

1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:27.800
 but the real difference is between those two.

1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:32.800
 Also thing to notice is that it's not a verified word, okay?

1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:37.320
 So grass fed means animals that have been on grass

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:38.720
 at some point in their life.

1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:43.920
 The way the cattle industry is in the US,

1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:46.280
 there's segmentation.

1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:49.080
 So there's cow calf operations,

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:52.080
 then those calves get sold to stocker operations

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:54.320
 which raised animals in their teens basically,

1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:56.720
 and then those get sold to feed lots.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:58.800
 And so those three phases,

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:02.480
 that first phase of the cow calf is always on grass.

1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:04.680
 It's mother cows and mom cows are amazing.

1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:06.560
 They can thrive on anything

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:08.440
 and still put all their nutrients into their baby

1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:09.720
 and their babies will be healthy.

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.120
 So you never are putting mother cows

1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:12.760
 on really premium pasture.

1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:15.160
 So it's usually just kind of like okay pasture,

1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:17.080
 dirty lot, if you ever see kind of like,

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.320
 scrubly lots with lots of cows and calves on,

1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:20.720
 that's a cow calf operation.

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:24.000
 So there's also a loophole, unfortunately,

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.280
 where people use the term grass fed,

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:27.680
 and they're actually referring to animals

1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:29.180
 that at some point in their life had grass,

1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:31.480
 but that might be pretty far in the rear view mirror.

1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:34.720
 So you need to look at that grass fed and finished

1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.640
 or grass fed 100%.

1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:38.440
 That ratio of omega three to sixes,

1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:41.080
 it changes in like a week on grain.

1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:42.120
 So it's radically different.

1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.920
 Unfortunately, it's the same thing for you and me.

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:45.280
 You can eat clean for a month,

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:48.000
 you eat junk for three days, you're garbage, right?

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.160
 It's not like you can just like coast on that, right?

1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:51.000
 We know what that's like.

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.720
 Same thing for animals, our physiology changes.

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:55.200
 Food's the number one way we interact with our environment.

1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.160
 And our body changes really rapidly and dramatically.

1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:01.480
 So we know Belcampo and just the way

1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:04.520
 sort of this regenerative farming approach of Belcampo

1:06:04.520 --> 1:06:07.560
 and the sort of high humane is good for the land,

1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:09.780
 is good for the animal.

1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:12.600
 Can you comment on ways it's good for the human

1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.200
 that eats the meat?

1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:16.680
 Is this meat better for you?

1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:21.360
 Yes, and this is where they kind of focus on the joy

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:23.420
 and animals doing yoga and all this sort of like

1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:27.780
 cynical stuff about this type of agriculture.

1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:30.280
 So just like set that aside,

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.760
 it really is better for your health.

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:35.680
 It's got a better fat ratio, it's less inflammatory,

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:39.440
 it's got higher protein, it's just better product.

1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.000
 In the case of beef, it's lower in fat

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.400
 and that fat has a better quality and it's higher

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.260
 in poultry and pork, it's also higher in protein.

1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:49.000
 So all the nutritionals are better.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.480
 It's got higher density of vitamins,

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:52.280
 it's got higher density of minerals.

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:55.360
 And none of this stuff is radically different than,

1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:59.200
 it's not like the product is black and white,

1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:02.640
 but every metric meaningfully is better

1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:05.000
 in the right direction across the board.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.840
 So why wouldn't you?

1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:10.920
 I hesitate to take anecdotal evidence

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:13.000
 as like final scientific conclusions,

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.140
 but it does seem I've eaten quite a bit

1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:16.600
 of belcampo meat, for example,

1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:19.580
 and it's just my body seems to respond,

1:07:19.580 --> 1:07:21.640
 like it's less bothered by it.

1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:25.800
 Meaning like less inflamed, I just feel better.

1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:28.260
 Because I mostly eat a meat diet

1:07:28.260 --> 1:07:30.840
 and it does seem to be a little bit of a difference

1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:34.040
 what kind of meat I eat, where it comes from.

1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:37.260
 I don't know if that's my own psychology also.

1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:39.180
 I mean, there is an aspect to like,

1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:42.060
 when you know that the meat came from a good place

1:07:42.060 --> 1:07:45.120
 and all the ways we've defined good,

1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:46.880
 you feel better about it.

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:49.480
 And that has an effect, like decreased stress.

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:50.840
 So I'm a huge believer in that,

1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:53.240
 like outside of just nutrition,

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.740
 how you feel about the whole experience is a huge impact.

1:07:55.740 --> 1:07:58.720
 But it does feel like the meat itself

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.320
 is actually just leading to less inflammation for me

1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:04.920
 or like less, like the bloated feeling

1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:07.560
 and all those negative effects that could come with meat

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.480
 versus like certain other ground beef that I eat,

1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:15.340
 like store bought chicken breast or steak,

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:16.440
 all those kinds of things.

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:19.220
 My body's a little bit more,

1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:21.140
 works a little bit harder to process that food,

1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:21.980
 it feels like.

1:08:21.980 --> 1:08:23.040
 I don't know if there's science to that,

1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:25.360
 but sort of anecdotally, that seems to be the case.

1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:26.920
 Omega sixes are a big part of that,

1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:27.760
 for in the case of the beef.

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.840
 You eat a lot of beef, you love beef.

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:33.000
 And so in a conventional beef product,

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.680
 it's a one to 30 ratio of omega threes to sixes.

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:39.440
 And sometimes one to 20, one to 30,

1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:41.400
 but that's the wrong direction.

1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:45.320
 In our beef, it's as low as one to one.

1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:48.700
 So that and the omega sixes are what's part of inflammation.

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:52.460
 Now, the magic in animals

1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:55.000
 is that they're incredibly efficient processors.

1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:00.000
 And in the same way that the body can process

1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:04.160
 and take out tons of things that are toxic

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:05.000
 out of the environment,

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.640
 I mean, animals bodies can do that too.

1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:09.880
 So the beauty of meat is that it can be pretty clean.

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:12.600
 Things like Roundup and stuff don't end up in the meat.

1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:14.800
 When we have antibiotics in our meat,

1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:16.840
 we're not worried about getting like tetracycline

1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:18.420
 from the chicken breast.

1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:19.400
 What we're worried about

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:21.600
 is the workers getting tetracycline,

1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:23.280
 the chicken growing faster than it should,

1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:26.320
 the meat being chewier and not as high quality.

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.120
 But the actual antibiotics don't,

1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:30.280
 the animals great at filtering that, right?

1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:31.120
 They get that out.

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:34.720
 So you have to think about meat not as like contamination

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.320
 of like, oh, there's gonna be some of that garbage

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:39.600
 they used in the farming in my meat,

1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:41.080
 but it's the more subtle things.

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.720
 It's the fat ratio, it's the protein density.

1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:48.440
 And there's also just, I think in my experience,

1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:50.580
 there's just more complex flavor

1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:52.520
 and things that taste more complex.

1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.840
 This is, science backs this up, they fill you up faster.

1:09:56.840 --> 1:09:59.000
 So if you're looking to limit,

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.400
 to eat for fullness and, but not eat as many calories,

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:06.380
 more complex foods are the way to do that.

1:10:06.380 --> 1:10:08.920
 And that hit, you hit your satiety,

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:10.140
 help you hit that satiety.

1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.600
 So things like, I mean, all the key amino acids

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:16.440
 that help you feel full, mostly from meat, right?

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.800
 So those are, that's part of it, like it,

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.080
 but all meats have those.

1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:20.800
 Then there's other kind of micronutrients

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:21.960
 and things around that complex flavor

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:23.440
 that help you feel full faster.

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.520
 Forgive me for this question,

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.120
 but it is kind of an interesting one

1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:30.020
 that people are curious about.

1:10:30.020 --> 1:10:33.680
 What does it feel like to be a,

1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:38.120
 or what does it take to be a woman CEO of a meat company?

1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:39.960
 I mean, you're no longer CEO of Belcampo,

1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:42.800
 but you did, you ran, you cofounded Belcampo,

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:44.440
 you ran it for many, many years.

1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:47.700
 Is there something that you could say

1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.220
 in terms of challenges associated with that?

1:10:51.220 --> 1:10:54.320
 And how did you personally overcome it?

1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:58.280
 So to be a female running a meat and livestock operation,

1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:04.480
 it felt very alone, a lot, you know, for a long time.

1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:09.960
 I felt very, like everybody waiting for me to fail

1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:14.520
 or watching and assuming that I was like,

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:17.240
 just good at marketing or whatever else.

1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:22.240
 And so it's taken me a while to not internalize that.

1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:31.200
 I think the only reason I'm here

1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:34.920
 is we have our own supply chain in Slaughterhouse.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.320
 And I think had I really been playing

1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:37.320
 in the broader meat industry,

1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:38.780
 it would have been a shorter journey.

1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:40.040
 You know, it would have been very hard

1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:42.440
 to make it even get to this phase.

1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:47.440
 But I do, you know, I think the mission is my life's work.

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:59.560
 The mission of cleaner ingredients that tastes so amazing.

1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:02.400
 You don't need to do too much to them.

1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:04.720
 You know, I like creating food

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.800
 that's in support of good health.

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.080
 And then secondary to that, it's the environment,

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:13.600
 but I want healthy food to be a joy to eat, right?

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:18.600
 And that's, you know, creating innovation in the space

1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:23.980
 for this company has been about building a brand

1:12:23.980 --> 1:12:26.240
 that people understand and is transparent

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:28.560
 and that people believe in in an industry

1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:30.800
 that's broadly perceived of as pretty corrupt.

1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:33.560
 So those are things I feel enormously proud of.

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:37.280
 So you focused on the mission and the pushback,

1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:40.920
 all the mess of the industry.

1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:42.120
 You try not to internalize it,

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.200
 trying not to let it affect you and focus on the mission.

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:46.220
 You know, and it's in the joy of it

1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:49.280
 and the part where it's gotten fun for me

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.760
 has been returning to what I love about it.

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:53.100
 And I've only had the privilege

1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:54.880
 of doing that pretty recently.

1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:58.880
 So I think for me personally, you know, starting,

1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:01.880
 I host these events on the farm called Meat Camps,

1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:03.720
 where I cook and teach people to cook

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:06.400
 and, you know, taste and talk about flavor

1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:10.320
 and all the like sensual aspects of it that are my fire.

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.080
 Like, thank goodness I did that stuff

1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:14.400
 because otherwise it was just such a beating.

1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:15.440
 You know, so there were parts of it

1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:17.200
 where I got to feed my fire.

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:19.600
 And then now in the, you know, the past year,

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:22.200
 since resigning, I've been, I do all the recipe development.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:23.600
 I shoot all the content.

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:25.020
 I, you know, taste product.

1:13:25.020 --> 1:13:26.840
 I'm developing all of our new products.

1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:27.840
 I launched our meatballs.

1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:29.660
 I'm just about to launch our chicken meatballs,

1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:31.480
 doing a high protein bone broth.

1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:34.160
 Like those are, that's why I did this

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:36.680
 was to be able to build this great product

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:37.960
 that I could build on.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:40.160
 So I'm kind of at that place now,

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:41.360
 but it's taken a lot longer.

1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:43.960
 And I think, you know, looking at the landscape

1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:47.060
 of what to do in food, this is definitely,

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.940
 we tackled the most complicated problem.

1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:55.660
 That I can imagine, you know, I did it like

1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:57.640
 in the most old fashioned way, right?

1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:59.520
 So it's been super complex.

1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:00.880
 And then I also look at it and I'm like, yeah,

1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:03.720
 and it's been messy and it's gonna continue to be hard,

1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:07.080
 but I'm proud of having tackled the hard problems.

1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:08.560
 So the hard problem here is not

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:10.560
 in the space of technologies.

1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:13.680
 It's in the space of bringing something

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:17.400
 that we've done for a long, long time in our human history

1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:21.160
 and scaling it in the face

1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.160
 of all the other economic pressures.

1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:25.980
 Like doing so successfully,

1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:27.760
 also communicating to the rest of the world

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:29.600
 that this is a powerful solution.

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:32.360
 So inspiring the rest of the world that regenerative farming,

1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:34.960
 like running a company in this kind of way

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.120
 that's humane for animals, good for the land,

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:41.100
 good for people, even if it costs,

1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:44.040
 like if there's an increased cost to the meat,

1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:46.120
 even if that, if you have a broader vision

1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:48.920
 that means eating less meat overall,

1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:52.240
 that that is like inspiring the world

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:53.780
 that this is a future we want.

1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:57.540
 And just taking that on and getting that done.

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:00.980
 Got a chance to eat a little bit of cheese,

1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:03.680
 which is a good opportunity

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:06.400
 to talk about your experience in Italy.

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:08.720
 You spent some time, or as south of Europe,

1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:09.920
 I'm not sure if it was Italy.

1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:11.440
 Yeah, I lived in Italy, but.

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:14.760
 And there's cheese involved, right?

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:18.860
 Like what did you take away from that experience,

1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:21.600
 both as a chef and as a human being?

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:25.540
 I moved to Europe right after my early 20s

1:15:25.540 --> 1:15:27.560
 and I worked as a cheese maker.

1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:32.520
 And I lived in really small rural farms

1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.920
 in the countryside.

1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:39.400
 And I got up early and milked animals, made cheese.

1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.400
 And I got to live in a traditional agricultural society

1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:47.380
 and learn how they ate.

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.520
 So it shaped me as a cook

1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:55.520
 because it was a chance to have incredible ingredients,

1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:58.000
 learn how to cook very simple food.

1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.640
 I had been immersed in thought

1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:02.760
 that I wanted to be like a chefy chef, right?

1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:04.240
 Because I love food and I love cooking

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.880
 and I was just drawn to that world.

1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:09.880
 But I don't like the experience

1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:11.440
 of that sort of like fancy food experience

1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:15.400
 is not what is exciting for me about it.

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:18.960
 So I loved working in that environment

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:21.880
 because I got to eat lunches and dinners

1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:24.720
 and everything with the farm that I lived in.

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:26.400
 The farm that I lived on

1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:31.080
 and just very traditional, simple way to eat.

1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:34.760
 The other piece of it is I went to high school in the 90s,

1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:37.720
 child of like the low fat generation, right?

1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:40.500
 And it was just really liberating and amazing

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:43.920
 to eat tons of super fatty foods

1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:46.680
 and olive oil all over the place

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:48.800
 and bleak slabs of bread and salami

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.580
 and being this like vibrant health,

1:16:50.580 --> 1:16:55.320
 like be leaner, you know, happy, no skin stuff,

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:57.680
 you know, stop getting split ends.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:59.360
 Like I stopped having flaky nails,

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:02.220
 like just stuff that had bothered me my whole life,

1:17:02.220 --> 1:17:04.400
 including like just moodiness.

1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:05.960
 And that all just changed.

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:08.520
 And granted, I was also like living on a farm in Italy

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:10.500
 and getting up with the sunlight.

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:14.440
 And like there were lots of great aspects of my life as well

1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:15.600
 that happened in that time.

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:18.280
 But I was just immersed in this diet

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:20.520
 that I realized like, man, this is so simple.

1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:23.600
 And I also loved that I had like, you know,

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:26.520
 you'd have dinner and it was just like some ricotta cheese

1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:27.880
 with some olive oil, some bread

1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:30.960
 and like a bowl of fava beans.

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:32.400
 It's like, that's dinner.

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.640
 And it kind of broke down my assumptions too

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:37.200
 about like dinner always has to be this, you know,

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:38.880
 a protein and a vegetable and, you know,

1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:43.400
 being more fluid and more seasonal was exciting for me.

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:46.840
 So I just learned kind of a lot about paying attention

1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:49.640
 to food, simple preparation

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:54.640
 and the vibrancy of health that I personally experienced

1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:56.720
 kind of made me double down on that.

1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.360
 Our mutual friend, Andrew Huberman,

1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:02.880
 mentioned something offline to me

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:06.020
 about something involving the mob.

1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:06.860
 Oh yeah.

1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:09.040
 Is there something you could share or is this,

1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:11.960
 or are people going to hurt if you share this?

1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:13.600
 It's far enough in the rear view mirror.

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:18.600
 I mean, I was hired by this group in Sicily on,

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:23.600
 and this is, you know, I was all of like 21 years old

1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:26.040
 and to get a permit to work there,

1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:28.000
 you have to show that you have a competency

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.060
 that nobody else in Italy has.

1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:32.520
 And that competency for Anya Fernald at the time

1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:33.840
 was cheese expert.

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:36.840
 So it was like, stupid American girl being like,

1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:37.840
 going to the consulate.

1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:38.920
 So I already knew that it was like,

1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:41.020
 there was something wobbly about this organization,

1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:42.720
 but I wanted to work for them.

1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:47.720
 And my boss from that time did end up in federal prison

1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:52.720
 for corruption many years later, embezzlement primarily.

1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:56.000
 But, so I was definitely in an environment

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.320
 that was answering to multiple masters.

1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:01.580
 That's a nice way to put it.

1:19:01.580 --> 1:19:04.680
 It was, I couldn't have asked for a better way

1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:07.840
 to kind of get with life and understand

1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:09.800
 how things happen in the world though.

1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:13.800
 You know, of learning as somebody who tends

1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:17.560
 to be super direct and not very subtle,

1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:19.120
 it was amazing to be in this world

1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.120
 where like everybody communicates in multiple levels.

1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:24.900
 Like we're going to lunch with my boss,

1:19:24.900 --> 1:19:26.560
 with somebody we're gonna do a business deal with

1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:30.440
 and by the, they ordered a glass of wine

1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:35.120
 and with that order communicated like, disappointment.

1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:36.720
 Because that, the father of the person

1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:39.800
 who had made that wine had offended that other guys.

1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:42.360
 I like that level of stuff, like nothing happened directly.

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:43.440
 I'm like, what are we talking about afterwards?

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:44.380
 I'm like, what happened that lunch?

1:19:44.380 --> 1:19:45.620
 It's like, oh, I just, you know,

1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:47.760
 I told him this by ordering that, whatever.

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:48.600
 You know, that kind of thing.

1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:52.160
 So understand that there's different ways of communicating.

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:56.880
 But it was also, you know, it was interesting to see.

1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:58.680
 And I think I, you know, it's kind of the struggle

1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.040
 that I've lived again and again in my life.

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:03.600
 Fundamentally, what we were doing in that operation

1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:05.920
 was there's a very traditional cheese

1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:08.720
 called the Raguzano cheese in Southeastern Sicily

1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:09.720
 where I lived, Ragusa.

1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:12.080
 And it was about scaling that operation.

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:14.280
 So it was European Union money

1:20:14.280 --> 1:20:16.360
 that my boss was also unfortunately using for other things.

1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:19.720
 But fundamentally it was to take that,

1:20:19.720 --> 1:20:21.520
 this type of very small scale cheese,

1:20:21.520 --> 1:20:22.840
 get them exported, help them scale.

1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:23.680
 And we did it.

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:24.760
 And it was really challenging.

1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:27.160
 And I learned a lot about the safety issues

1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:28.960
 and collaboration issues

1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:31.240
 and creating groups of farmers for scale.

1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:34.720
 So it's kind of been doing the same thing again and again.

1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:37.640
 But Sicily, it, you know,

1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:39.260
 it was also just the first place

1:20:39.260 --> 1:20:44.260
 where I would regularly forage for food.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:45.280
 Yeah.

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:48.360
 You know, like there I'd go to friends houses

1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:50.480
 and we'd like go out and pick nettles

1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:52.080
 or go out and pick wild asparagus.

1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:54.160
 So every season there were stuff that you'd be gathering.

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.920
 And that was just part of how you lived.

1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:57.520
 And it was part of your health.

1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:00.380
 So that was, I just learned a ton in that time

1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:05.380
 about like simple eating and really that healthy food,

1:21:05.380 --> 1:21:08.380
 the simpler it is, the better, right?

1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:10.280
 Like this sort of sense that healthy food

1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:12.040
 isn't in a tiny package, granola bar,

1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:13.360
 lots of labels, lots of powders.

1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:14.760
 It's like the more simple, essential,

1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:17.120
 closer to the land can actually lead to optimal health.

1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:19.520
 You've learned to appreciate the simplicity of food,

1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:22.920
 the beauty within the simplicity.

1:21:22.920 --> 1:21:23.760
 I think it's because it was the first time

1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:28.280
 that I had amazing food quality.

1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:29.120
 Okay.

1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:31.200
 Cause in the, where I grew up,

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:32.800
 there wasn't that food quality.

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:36.960
 Like I had some stuff from my garden and things

1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:38.600
 that were great, but that's the kind of place

1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:39.800
 where when artichokes in season,

1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:42.700
 all of a sudden there's guys selling artichokes

1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:44.520
 on their bicycles in the street

1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:47.000
 and they're just fresh picked and you'd get that one thing

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.760
 or the torpedo onions or they like,

1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.680
 so there's a seasonality and celebration of things

1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:51.860
 in their peak moment.

1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:53.920
 And you would just have that one thing.

1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:56.800
 And that was the first time I'd ever eaten in that way.

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:00.400
 You were a judge several times on Iron Chef.

1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:05.080
 How do you judge a good meal, like what your own,

1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:09.920
 other people's, like what rating system is good?

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:11.800
 I mean, I go on experience and think about how many

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:13.920
 of your like most memorable, fantastic meals

1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:16.280
 are like three star Michelin meals.

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:17.960
 It's more about the experience, right?

1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:20.620
 It's more about that slow down, who are you with?

1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:23.680
 And some of our best meals are like the most simple things.

1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:27.140
 So Iron Chef, those were fun experiences.

1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:29.600
 It's a lot of sous vide though.

1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:31.200
 It's a lot of sauces.

1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:32.580
 It's a lot of powders.

1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:34.280
 I mean, it's kind of like magic food.

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:37.000
 So that's not, I mean, it's incredible

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.440
 to watch it as science, but I don't know

1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:41.440
 if those are my most memorable meals.

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.160
 So the experience is how you judge a good meal.

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.800
 For you personally, if you were a judge

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:48.320
 of the entirety of the human experience

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:50.660
 in terms of the culinary journey,

1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:53.160
 that would be like the people you're eating with,

1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:56.560
 the environment, like how you feel,

1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:59.680
 the journey, the building up to that meal, the whole thing.

1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:00.680
 You can't separate it out.

1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:05.680
 When I was learning as an apprentice cheese maker in Greece,

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:08.160
 one of the best meals of my life

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:10.840
 is like a bowl of cold sheep milk yogurt

1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:13.080
 with like a crust of cold fat on top.

1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:15.000
 So like the way that these fatty,

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.240
 sheep milk can have double the percentage

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.440
 of fat than cow milk.

1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:20.400
 So like there's the yogurt and then there's this crust

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:23.540
 of fat and then they pour the fresh honey over the top

1:23:23.540 --> 1:23:27.680
 and you just eat like this bowl of probably top five meals

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:29.460
 of my life, right?

1:23:29.460 --> 1:23:31.920
 I mean, that's the simplicity, it's just the best thing.

1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:33.520
 And it was the fact that it's in Terracotta

1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:34.840
 and I'd had this amazing day

1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.780
 and all of these things come together,

1:23:36.780 --> 1:23:38.000
 but I still remember that feeling.

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.780
 And I think most of us have those like really great

1:23:40.780 --> 1:23:45.480
 sensual memories of food and they're not about necessarily

1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:49.440
 that one fancy over the top restaurant or something.

1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:52.680
 It's really about the cold context of enjoyment.

1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:54.480
 Maybe you can help me with something.

1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.440
 So I think Offline said that we're both introverts a bit,

1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:03.440
 but I certainly find joy in repetition.

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:07.080
 So I kind of hide away as an introvert

1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:09.840
 and eat the same thing over and over and over again.

1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:11.920
 But at the same time, I had this conversation

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:14.160
 with Tyler Cohen, who's an economist,

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:15.960
 but he's also a food critic.

1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:19.580
 He writes these incredible posts about different foods.

1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:23.520
 And we had this conversation about

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:24.920
 what his last meal would be.

1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:26.840
 If he had to choose, like what is the best meal

1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:29.740
 he's ever eaten that he would want to eat?

1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:31.160
 And he had a good answer about it.

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.000
 It had to do with experience, I think.

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.380
 For him, it was a particular Mexican restaurant

1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:37.680
 and it had in Mexico because of the ingredients,

1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:40.000
 because of the experience, because of the work it took

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.120
 to get there and all those kinds of things.

1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:44.720
 But it also made me realize, like when I was going home

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:47.800
 after that conversation, that I couldn't answer

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.560
 that question myself, like what is the best meal

1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:51.600
 I've ever eaten?

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.680
 Because I really haven't experienced much.

1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:58.020
 And so it almost was like a challenge to myself.

1:24:58.020 --> 1:25:00.920
 Like I feel like I should journey out a little bit more

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.680
 in this life and try stuff.

1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:07.780
 And to try to see like what is the best meal

1:25:07.780 --> 1:25:09.820
 for me in the world?

1:25:09.820 --> 1:25:13.440
 You know, like both the experience and the taste, right?

1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:16.100
 So I was kind of wondering, first I'd love to ask you

1:25:16.100 --> 1:25:18.140
 like what your last meal would be

1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:20.880
 or what is the greatest meal you've ever eaten?

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.400
 But also, and you're still very young,

1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:26.960
 and so there's still more experiences to be had, right?

1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:31.480
 And for me, like how do you go about finding

1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:32.880
 the best meal in the world?

1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:38.460
 Is there a device you could give essentially?

1:25:38.460 --> 1:25:42.320
 There's that sense of anticipation, right?

1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:46.920
 So if it's the best meal, I'd say for you,

1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:49.700
 it would need to be on the heels of something

1:25:49.700 --> 1:25:52.240
 where you'd pushed yourself with a fast

1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:54.040
 or with an athletic event, right?

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:56.460
 Or something like you would be coming into it

1:25:56.460 --> 1:25:59.200
 with a sense of anticipation because of deprivation.

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.560
 You'd be hungry for it in a bigger sense of the word,

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:04.140
 like hungry for deep nutrition on your soul level

1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:05.460
 as well as your belly.

1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:06.880
 So I'd say that you'd have to think about it

1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:09.980
 as a phase of things, like multiple things.

1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:14.240
 And then I also think, you love meat, you love cheese.

1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.760
 You have to have some things that come together, right?

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.160
 Like there's gotta be some specific elements

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:21.720
 of just your favorite flavors in that.

1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:23.520
 But there could be flavors yet to be discovered.

1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:28.120
 That's a whole other thing because I just emotionally

1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.660
 and physically feel good on meat,

1:26:29.660 --> 1:26:34.620
 but that doesn't mean like maybe like a rice based dish,

1:26:34.620 --> 1:26:36.760
 like sushi or something like that,

1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:39.400
 or Indian cuisine where it's like sauces

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:40.840
 and the breads and whatever.

1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:42.120
 I love that stuff too.

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:46.460
 So we're not talking about like a meal is an experience

1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:49.640
 that could be like a one night stand,

1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:52.400
 but with a piece of food, right?

1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:53.880
 It could be a totally different

1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:56.040
 than what actually makes you feel good

1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:57.360
 when you eat it every day.

1:26:57.360 --> 1:26:58.520
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.420
 Completely, completely analogous.

1:27:00.420 --> 1:27:01.260
 I get that.

1:27:01.260 --> 1:27:03.160
 I mean, you also though, there's elements of comfort

1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:05.400
 and love and those different pieces for you.

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:07.720
 But I think you gotta look at like,

1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:09.640
 where would you go somewhere?

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:13.240
 Like would you go to a place where you could hike in Japan

1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:15.720
 and then end up in a little place where you eat something?

1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:17.160
 That's where I would think you were gonna have

1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:18.600
 that magic moment.

1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:20.120
 Maybe someplace you go to Mongolia

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:22.500
 and you're in a really extreme environment

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:23.400
 for three or four days,

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:25.700
 and then you come back and you're in a farm

1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:27.720
 and you get something on the table that's a surprise

1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:28.560
 and you're hungry.

1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.040
 Like that's gonna be the moment where you're gonna explode

1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:34.940
 in the instance of like the culinary level

1:27:34.940 --> 1:27:36.560
 for Alexa levels up, right?

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:37.560
 That's the journey for you.

1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:39.960
 But it has to be, I think from understanding you,

1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.600
 like a combination of that pushing yourself anticipation

1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:47.920
 and something about the, exactly, and the environment.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:50.240
 Well, I definitely, definitely,

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:53.400
 like some fasting is part of a great meal for me.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:56.640
 So like 24 hours is like the minimum.

1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:01.000
 You're more sensitive to the richness of any experience

1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.800
 for me when I fast 24 hours.

1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.400
 And so that's a requirement.

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:09.000
 For a good meal is 24 hour fast, I think.

1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:11.640
 It's just like you're able to taste,

1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:13.120
 I don't know, maybe it's psychological,

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.600
 but you're able to disassemble the various flavors

1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:20.320
 in a meal as simple as like even a chicken breast.

1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:22.100
 There's all kinds of flavors going on.

1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:24.280
 Because like when you cook a chicken breast,

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.900
 there's like the outside, the inside.

1:28:26.900 --> 1:28:29.340
 I mean, the volume of the meat tastes different

1:28:29.340 --> 1:28:31.680
 as you eat like the different fibers.

1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:34.640
 And you can like tell all those differences as you're eating

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:37.520
 when you're fasting, and you can appreciate that.

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:38.760
 And of course, you're right,

1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:40.640
 part of the journey is important.

1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:42.880
 It makes me think like whether restaurants

1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.840
 is the right place to explore or what.

1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:47.960
 I'm envisioning it on a farm for you.

1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.280
 And I'm envisioning it in a place

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:51.920
 that's like really into ag and food.

1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:54.040
 You know, like even a place like Romania.

1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:56.300
 You know, like they have incredible farms, right?

1:28:56.300 --> 1:28:58.840
 Where it's not gonna get any like fancy restaurants there,

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:02.360
 but you're probably gonna have some amazing little cheeses

1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.800
 and cured meats, and you might go to some, you know,

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:06.400
 have some experience and end up in a place

1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:07.600
 with like four things on the plate

1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:09.120
 and each of them blows your mind.

1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:12.000
 You know, like, or Japan is another place like that.

1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.560
 I think Vietnam, Laos, like, I mean, those are countries

1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:16.600
 where there's like these incredible niche ingredients

1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.960
 and this essentialism around food.

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:19.800
 That's fascinating.

1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:21.800
 Or maybe it's in Russia with Putin.

1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:23.240
 That might be the best meal in the world.

1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:24.080
 With him on the farm.

1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:27.640
 Yeah, that'd be, it's hard to reproduce that.

1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:29.920
 If that is in fact a good meal, it'd be, you know,

1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:32.400
 it's hard to get them out to the farm,

1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.760
 but maybe one time they'd be the best meal.

1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:35.720
 What about you?

1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:39.840
 For me, like it's the ingredients that I associate

1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.280
 with like indulgence, like be fresh bread

1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:44.520
 with like my favorite cultured butter on it,

1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.360
 be food of my childhood.

1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:47.320
 I grew up in Oregon.

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:50.440
 We always had salmon and I smoked salmon or salmon eggs,

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.740
 like really good salmon eggs.

1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:52.580
 I love cheese.

1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:53.420
 I love goat cheese.

1:29:53.420 --> 1:29:54.380
 I love all kinds of cheese.

1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:55.440
 There'd be cheese.

1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.560
 I love meat, obviously.

1:29:56.560 --> 1:29:59.040
 I'm imagining it's sort of like an abundance

1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:00.200
 of like 10 things I love.

1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:01.040
 It's not a dish.

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:02.040
 You know, it's like all the yummy things.

1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:04.840
 All of your indulgences on the same plate, yeah.

1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:07.040
 And there isn't like, for me, there's not like a big cake

1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:08.080
 or something super like that.

1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:10.880
 It's like really yummy things that I love,

1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:13.520
 like really fresh, crusty, delicious bread that's warm

1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:14.760
 and it's got a bunch of butter on it

1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:17.280
 and I can put some salt on it and eat a big slab of that.

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:19.300
 That's just, that's where I'm at.

1:30:19.300 --> 1:30:20.140
 That's funny.

1:30:20.140 --> 1:30:24.480
 And so meat to you is not like one of those indulgences?

1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:25.320
 Oh, definitely.

1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:26.400
 There'd definitely be steak there too.

1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:28.440
 I'm just imagining not like there isn't a specific dish.

1:30:28.440 --> 1:30:30.440
 It's like eight or 10 things, right?

1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:31.960
 It's the fresh bread.

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:34.000
 It's something like fishy, yummy,

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.900
 probably be really good fresh berries too.

1:30:36.900 --> 1:30:38.960
 There'd be a steak or a pork chop

1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:42.480
 or something like meaty and delicious and savory.

1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:43.640
 There'd be some cheese,

1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:46.160
 just a bunch of different things that I love to eat

1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:48.040
 that like all kind of check boxes for me

1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:49.660
 is probably what would make me happiest.

1:30:49.660 --> 1:30:51.680
 I'm afraid of variety.

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:53.620
 I like the focus when you can just,

1:30:53.620 --> 1:30:54.460
 this is all you have,

1:30:54.460 --> 1:30:57.640
 the scarcity of just this is the one ingredient

1:30:57.640 --> 1:31:01.760
 and really appreciating it or maybe one thing,

1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:05.160
 like one full complex flavor, whatever the heck that is.

1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:08.440
 It's like the distraction,

1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:11.560
 the serial dating nature of having a bunch of things

1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:15.000
 on a plate is, yeah,

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.860
 for some reason that prevents me

1:31:16.860 --> 1:31:19.280
 from fully enjoying any one of them.

1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:20.800
 I don't know why that is.

1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:23.160
 The more healthy way to do it is the variety.

1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:25.840
 Your way is the healthier way to do it.

1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:27.600
 Is alcohol involved?

1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:29.120
 I don't drink very much.

1:31:29.120 --> 1:31:32.760
 I like red wine, but I just don't really,

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:35.380
 I love red wine with good food.

1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:41.560
 I also cofounded a rum business that's an organic rum,

1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:42.760
 so I love that product,

1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:44.160
 but that's not, for me,

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:49.160
 it's like I'm more interested in the food, I'd say.

1:31:49.160 --> 1:31:52.780
 Is there some connection between your chef life,

1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:54.540
 cooking and music?

1:31:54.540 --> 1:31:57.200
 Does this music have a role in the experience?

1:31:57.200 --> 1:31:59.400
 I love artistic expression,

1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:02.120
 and that's always had a role in my life

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:03.520
 in the same way I love to paint and draw

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:05.880
 and all the different things.

1:32:05.880 --> 1:32:09.040
 I was a professional musician when I lived in Sicily,

1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:10.600
 by definition, technicality,

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:12.500
 because I played in the municipal band.

1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:19.400
 So I would march around the town with all the funerals.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:22.340
 I get like 50 euro every time I'd march in a funeral

1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:24.280
 playing my oboe, so it's given me,

1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:25.720
 I like that because I like to,

1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:27.000
 like you were talking about going to farms,

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.840
 like what I quested for was experience and connection,

1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:32.680
 in places where I could learn things.

1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:34.720
 That's been the through line of my learning journey.

1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:36.880
 I've learned things and sought knowledge

1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:40.000
 that I can't get in any conventional learning environment,

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.100
 and so what are the tools that let me do that?

1:32:42.100 --> 1:32:45.600
 It was like being adaptable and comfortable

1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:46.440
 in different cultures,

1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:48.400
 but also having common ground points

1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:51.320
 that allow you to connect with people,

1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:52.740
 so music's one of those things.

1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:56.400
 So I love music, but I also,

1:32:56.400 --> 1:32:57.800
 there's any number of enjoy of food,

1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.480
 being able to pitch in and help in the kitchen,

1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:01.480
 you know, like cards,

1:33:01.480 --> 1:33:02.640
 like those are when you're dealing with

1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:04.680
 getting into like farming communities and stuff,

1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:06.360
 that stuff really helps, right?

1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:08.380
 So I basically have cultivated tools

1:33:08.380 --> 1:33:11.400
 that let me drop into places where I can learn,

1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:14.160
 and so those are all kind of a piece.

1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:15.920
 Those are just tools to get in there.

1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:19.000
 That said, we did listen to Justin Bieber earlier today.

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.280
 I need to get more into him.

1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:23.560
 I need to understand the full complexity of the Biebs.

1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:25.560
 You're trying to achieve what hunting stands for,

1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:27.480
 but at a much larger scale,

1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:29.560
 which is what kind of Belcampo stands for,

1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:32.480
 but what are your thoughts on hunting as a source of meat?

1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:35.960
 It's amazing, 100% pro hunting.

1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:39.080
 I think the reason that hunting flips the switch

1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.000
 for so many people is because it's the first thing

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.920
 they've had clean meat in their lives.

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:48.720
 Okay, so I think that the hunter's journey,

1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:51.120
 when people get so turned on by hunting,

1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:53.840
 they're just like, oh my God, I'm never going back.

1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:56.240
 I'm saying that's great if you've got access to that,

1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:57.800
 or if you know the guy who'll give you the backstrap,

1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:02.640
 awesome, but that's not achievable for most of us,

1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:04.980
 and I do think that talking to hunters

1:34:04.980 --> 1:34:07.120
 about their experiences, what they love about it,

1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:09.000
 many of them are just outdoors,

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.080
 and I say that because most of them are men,

1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:11.760
 but most of them love the outdoors aspect of it

1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:14.160
 and being out in the wild,

1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:15.920
 but a lot of them, it's because of how they feel

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:18.480
 when they eat the meat, and it's because they're eating,

1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:22.120
 I mean, 99% of meat in America is made a very specific way,

1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:25.800
 and it's in a way that is pretty inflammatory,

1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:30.200
 not incredibly delicious, and when you're on that extreme,

1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.240
 and then you toggle to having

1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:34.280
 this totally different style of product,

1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.180
 it feels radically different in your body,

1:34:36.180 --> 1:34:38.420
 so of course you're like, I'll never go back.

1:34:38.420 --> 1:34:40.640
 So when I talk about us being on that spectrum,

1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:42.640
 it's like, well, it's, hunted meat's,

1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:45.760
 I mean, I can never on any commercial operation

1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.560
 create the variety of the biodiversity of species

1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:53.120
 that an elk gets when it's wandering around of its own,

1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:55.340
 I mean, there's no way you can do that on a farm,

1:34:55.340 --> 1:34:58.720
 so there's always gonna be that extra five or 10%

1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:00.880
 that those wild animals are gonna have,

1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:02.700
 and those wild animals also fast for longer,

1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:04.360
 so they go through periods of starvation,

1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:07.760
 and that creates an even slower growth for musculature

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:10.800
 that's gonna create even more unique flavor

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:14.220
 and characteristics, so that's why there's that extra

1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:18.080
 in the hunted meat, but you can come a lot closer

1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:19.880
 with regenerative traditional farming

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:21.960
 to that flavor and health

1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.000
 than with any other type of farming I know,

1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:25.560
 so that's where I see it on the spectrum.

1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:29.700
 I love that people are getting excited about game,

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:33.680
 because it's better for your health,

1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:35.920
 it's got all the same characteristics

1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:37.480
 as regenerative farmed meat,

1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:40.240
 and it gets people turned on to simple, delicious food.

1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:44.640
 You know, you shouldn't have to cover food

1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:48.560
 with sauce that's got corn syrup and soy,

1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:51.240
 a bunch of junk in it to make it palatable.

1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:52.560
 If you gotta put sauce on your food,

1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:54.680
 you need to look at your ingredients.

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:57.000
 You need to revisit what you're starting from,

1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.740
 because if you have to put a bunch of things

1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:02.860
 to mask flavor onto anything you're eating,

1:36:02.860 --> 1:36:04.840
 you're trying to basically fool your palate

1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:07.200
 into doing what's not best for your body.

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:08.800
 We're trying to tell our palates,

1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:10.120
 like, just make it through this plate

1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:12.020
 so you can get the calories in,

1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:13.320
 and we're masking the fact

1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:15.600
 that we don't actually find it very appetizing.

1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:17.360
 So we're kind of teaching ourselves

1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:20.340
 to overcome our instinct with food.

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:24.240
 We're saying, here's this kind of bland base substrate,

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.280
 not very interesting, I'm not like sparking to it.

1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:29.400
 Awesome, put sugar and salt on it.

1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.440
 This up the hyperprocess flavor profile.

1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:32.600
 Great, done.

1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:34.380
 And then you're sparked to it.

1:36:34.380 --> 1:36:35.960
 That's a very short road,

1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:37.560
 and that's, I think, a lot of the health problems

1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:41.200
 we have now is because we're masking flavors

1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.080
 and basically trying to get ourselves

1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:44.600
 to move down this path of the same way

1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:46.880
 we behave around all hyperprocess foods.

1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:49.220
 And that gets us into a mess with our health.

1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:51.420
 So if we can get things like game

1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:53.760
 where people love the flavor out of the gate,

1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:55.720
 but it's natural, simple, mentally processed,

1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:56.600
 that's a win.

1:36:56.600 --> 1:37:01.400
 Yeah, it reverses that hyperprocessing trend

1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:03.940
 that we're on as a human species.

1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:07.080
 And that's the promise of regenerative farming,

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:08.160
 that's the promise of hunting.

1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:10.800
 Obviously, the former can be scaled,

1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.080
 the hunting, I think, cannot be scaled, right?

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:17.760
 But in many ways, the hunting inspires the world

1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:19.520
 that this is the right way to eat.

1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:20.440
 Yes.

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:24.360
 And that naturally leads to then

1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:28.720
 the humane farming, regenerative farming idea,

1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:31.880
 which is this idea that hunting represents.

1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:33.040
 How do you scale that?

1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:35.560
 Well, if you look at, we're talking about

1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:37.260
 people use this sort of marketing language

1:37:37.260 --> 1:37:39.680
 of happy cows or that kind of thing.

1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:40.840
 You're talking about the happiest animals,

1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:42.160
 it's wild animals, right?

1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:45.400
 So if you wonder why these practices are good,

1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:46.440
 talk to hunters.

1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:47.960
 You're talking about animals that have lived

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:50.120
 in their evolutionary capacity, right?

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:51.500
 Who have played their role in the ecosystem,

1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:54.400
 who've lived their meaning of life, right?

1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.480
 And that's a very powerfully different kind of role

1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:00.680
 than livestock production.

1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:02.960
 So I think if we can make our livestock production

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:05.480
 as similar to wild as possible,

1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:07.560
 then we're a lot of steps closer.

1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:10.480
 So you said the animals are happiest in the wild

1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:12.560
 and that's where they find meaning.

1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:14.960
 What about us, the human animal?

1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.920
 What's the meaning for us, do you think?

1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:21.920
 You've monitored the life cycle of a lot of living beings.

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:23.960
 You ever look in the mirror and think like,

1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:25.520
 why the hell are we humans here?

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:32.180
 I mean, thriving, reducing suffering, creating goodness.

1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:36.240
 I mean, those are the things I see in animals behavior.

1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:39.880
 They're mostly interested in reducing suffering

1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:42.960
 and nurturing, right?

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:45.400
 Those are the things that I think evolutionarily.

1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:46.760
 And we humans are just clever

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.680
 and we wanna be able to try to do that

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:50.160
 at a bigger and bigger scale.

1:38:51.820 --> 1:38:55.260
 As much as possible, reduce the suffering in the world.

1:38:55.260 --> 1:38:58.560
 And somehow that alleviates us of our own suffering.

1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:01.040
 That's the Russian thing, life is suffering

1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:03.880
 and somehow helping others alleviates it

1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:07.440
 and come up with creative solutions to do that.

1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:08.740
 That's really interesting.

1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:14.400
 It's almost consciousness is the thing

1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:17.480
 that led to suffering, but it also led

1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:19.920
 to the desire to alleviate the suffering.

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:22.080
 It's a feedback loop.

1:39:23.220 --> 1:39:24.560
 Consciousness creates suffering

1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:26.420
 and the desire to alleviate it.

1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:30.300
 Is there yet a pretty nonlinear life?

1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:32.080
 Your parents were professors.

1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:36.660
 You have done a lot of sort of incredible things

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:38.820
 that many would say kind of like,

1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.620
 how the hell are you gonna get this done?

1:39:40.620 --> 1:39:44.200
 Is there advice you can give to young people today,

1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:48.880
 like high school, college, about how to do,

1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:51.380
 how to live a similarly nonlinear crazy life

1:39:51.380 --> 1:39:54.460
 and accomplish, be as successful as you have been

1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:59.340
 about whether it's just their career or life in general?

1:39:59.340 --> 1:40:04.020
 The greatest gifts I've been given

1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:06.880
 have come from pursuing curiosity.

1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:13.300
 Just trying to understand the thing you're curious about

1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:14.940
 and allowing yourself to be curious about it

1:40:14.940 --> 1:40:16.460
 and just going with it.

1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:21.460
 And also pursuing things that are like deeply joyful for me.

1:40:23.300 --> 1:40:25.580
 Not what society wants, but you just personally,

1:40:25.580 --> 1:40:27.020
 just on your own, you're happy that you did it.

1:40:27.020 --> 1:40:28.580
 And that's something that in the times

1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:32.080
 when I strayed from that, my life has been harder.

1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:37.700
 So it's fundamentally, what are we on earth to do?

1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:39.160
 To live and thrive.

1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:44.160
 And so pursuing things that are curious

1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:47.900
 and satisfying and interesting and joyful

1:40:47.900 --> 1:40:50.340
 and allow me to grow.

1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:55.340
 So I made a number of choices to do things

1:40:55.340 --> 1:41:00.340
 that were more complicated and not considered cool

1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:02.040
 at the time.

1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:03.560
 Although now it's cool to work on farms.

1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:06.560
 It wasn't when I started my career in animal agriculture.

1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:10.040
 And it was like, but just deeply interesting to me.

1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:12.400
 And I felt like there was just lots to learn.

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:15.360
 And so that's been the path for me

1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.960
 is like going for something that's curious and hard

1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:20.640
 and sticking with it and being open to it.

1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:25.640
 And growing elements that give me joy through that.

1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:29.640
 So I also, for people who are starting out

1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:31.360
 in their careers and want to do something different too,

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.920
 it's like, get out of your comfort.

1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:35.880
 Go to a place that you've got something to learn from

1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:36.920
 and let it teach you that.

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.960
 And you'll get beat up.

1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:40.840
 Like I got beat up by that experience.

1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:42.640
 Like it was really hard.

1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:46.640
 I laugh about now working in Sicily for,

1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:50.640
 and the funny experiences I had there, but it was hard.

1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:52.120
 I was lonely and cried a lot.

1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:52.960
 It was stressful.

1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:53.800
 It was like, it was hard.

1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:54.640
 It was really hard.

1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:55.480
 And when you're inside of it,

1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:56.880
 you didn't know how it's going to turn out.

1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:57.720
 You didn't know it's going to turn out well.

1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.320
 And I'm like, why didn't I get a job doing something

1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:01.160
 that all my friends are doing?

1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:03.520
 And I didn't speak the language yet.

1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:06.080
 I had to learn foreign language and learn how to function.

1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:09.000
 And it was very lonely and very challenging,

1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.400
 but then that's where my resilience started to grow.

1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:14.960
 So the things I learned, they helped me grow.

1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:17.840
 So the things I learned there ended up just being

1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:21.520
 about resilience and understanding the language

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:23.400
 of subtlety in meaning.

1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:25.360
 So that's something that's carried me through my life.

1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.320
 But it was a curiosity about cheese making

1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:29.600
 and about like just living in a village that was there.

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:30.440
 I'm like, wouldn't it be amazing

1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:32.240
 to just live in a really rural village.

1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:33.080
 And you just went with it.

1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:34.520
 And I just like, this seems incredible

1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:36.280
 and have a place where you can,

1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:40.600
 the people seem interesting, the food seems good.

1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:43.680
 And let's just like try this and see what I can learn.

1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.160
 And that like putting yourself out of your comfort zone

1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:48.720
 in a place where you have a chance to learn

1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:51.960
 and grow is the secret.

1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:55.080
 Because it's, you grow through discomfort.

1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:57.600
 People think that you grow when you get

1:42:57.600 --> 1:42:58.800
 into this environment where everything's

1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:00.760
 like kind of sailing along,

1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:02.920
 but like growth actually comes through pain.

1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:06.680
 It's like growth comes from being cut down

1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.200
 and beat down and having to regrow and double down.

1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:13.200
 And so that kind of opportunity,

1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:14.040
 you have to seek it out.

1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:16.200
 You have to put yourself in the line of fire a bit.

1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:18.280
 If the situation sucks,

1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:21.200
 it's a sign that you might be doing something right

1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:23.000
 in the sense that you're on the path

1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:26.160
 at the end of which you'll be a better person

1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:27.840
 if you allow yourself to grow in that way.

1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:29.560
 Like as opposed to resisting it,

1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:33.440
 just going along with the journey and persevering.

1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:37.040
 And that ended us up in this incredible place.

1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:40.440
 This whole conversation, I'll probably overlay a video.

1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:43.200
 I'm looking at a gorgeous mountain

1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:45.440
 and it's an incredible farm.

1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:47.320
 Thank you so much for a meal yesterday.

1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:48.320
 That was incredible.

1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:51.400
 The cheese, the fish eggs,

1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:53.760
 just everything about this place.

1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:56.200
 Looking up, you can see the stars.

1:43:56.200 --> 1:43:58.160
 The stars at night are beautiful

1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.160
 and there's a peacefulness to it.

1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:02.960
 I had a pretty hard week actually,

1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:05.480
 just emotionally in many ways.

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.240
 And just coming here, it's immediately,

1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:08.360
 so much of it is lifted.

1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:11.440
 So I really deeply appreciate Anya

1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:13.080
 that you would invite me here

1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:15.160
 and that you have this conversation.

1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:16.240
 This was really awesome.

1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.440
 So thank you so much.

1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:18.280
 Thank you.

1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:24.440
 with Anya Fernald and thank you to Gala Games,

1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:28.600
 Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic and Fundrise.

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:32.080
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:33.880
 And now let me leave you with some words

1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:36.240
 from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.

1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:41.080
 Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.

1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:43.160
 Thank you for listening.

1:44:43.160 --> 1:45:10.160
 I hope to see you next time.
