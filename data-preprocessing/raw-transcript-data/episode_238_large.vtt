00:00.000 --> 00:05.460
 The following is a conversation with Francis Collins, director of the NIH, the National

00:05.460 --> 00:12.060
 Institutes of Health, appointed and reappointed to the role by three presidents, Obama, Trump,

00:12.060 --> 00:18.540
 and Biden. He oversees 27 separate institutes and centers, including NIAID, which makes

00:18.540 --> 00:25.900
 him Anthony Fauci's boss. At the NIH, Francis helped launch and led a huge number of projects

00:25.900 --> 00:31.540
 that pushed the frontiers of science, health, and medicine, including one of my favorites,

00:31.540 --> 00:36.600
 the BRAIN Initiative, that seeks to map the human brain and understand how the function

00:36.600 --> 00:43.360
 arises from the neural circuitry. Before the NIH, Francis led the Human Genome Project,

00:43.360 --> 00:49.560
 one of the largest and most ambitious efforts in the history of science. Given all that,

00:49.560 --> 00:54.780
 Francis is a humble, thoughtful, kind man, and because of this, to me, he's one of the

00:54.780 --> 01:01.340
 best representatives of science in the world. He is a man of God, and yet, also a friend

01:01.340 --> 01:08.480
 of the late Christopher Hitchens, who called him, quote, one of the greatest living Americans.

01:08.480 --> 01:13.700
 This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:13.700 --> 01:18.800
 And now, here's my conversation with Francis Collins.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.700
 Science at its best is a source of hope. So for me, it's been difficult to watch, as it

01:23.700 --> 01:28.880
 has during the pandemic, become at times a source of division. What I would love to do

01:28.880 --> 01:34.480
 in this conversation with you is touch some difficult topics, and do so with empathy and

01:34.480 --> 01:39.440
 humility so that we may begin to regain a sense of trust in science, and that it may

01:39.440 --> 01:43.160
 once again become a source of hope. I hope that's okay with you.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.200
 I love the goal.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.800
 Let's start with some hard questions. You called for, quote, thorough, expert driven,

01:50.800 --> 01:56.420
 and objective inquiry into the origins of COVID 19. So let me ask, is there a reasonable

01:56.420 --> 02:00.200
 chance that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?

02:00.200 --> 02:06.240
 I can't exclude that. I think it's fairly unlikely. I wish we had more ability to be

02:06.240 --> 02:11.720
 able to ask questions of the Chinese government and learn more about what kind of records

02:11.720 --> 02:17.360
 might have been in the lab that we've never been able to see. But most likely, this was

02:17.360 --> 02:22.560
 a natural origin of a virus, probably starting in a bat, perhaps traveling through some other

02:22.560 --> 02:27.560
 intermediate, yet to be identified host, and finding its way into humans.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.880
 Is answering this question within the realm of science, do you think, will we ever know?

02:31.880 --> 02:37.720
 I think we might know if we find that intermediate host. And there has not yet been a thorough

02:37.720 --> 02:42.760
 enough investigation to say that that's not going to happen. And remember, it takes a

02:42.760 --> 02:49.240
 while to do this. With SARS, it was 14 years before we figured out it was the civet cat

02:49.240 --> 02:52.920
 that was the intermediate host. With MERS, it was a little quicker to discover it was

02:52.920 --> 02:58.480
 the camel. With SARS COVID 2, there's been some looking, but especially now with everything

02:58.480 --> 03:03.060
 really tense between the US and China, if there's looking going on, we're not getting

03:03.060 --> 03:05.040
 told about it.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.840
 Do you think it's a scientific question or a political question?

03:07.840 --> 03:12.420
 It's a scientific question, but it has political implications.

03:12.420 --> 03:17.240
 So the world is full of scientists that are working together, but in the political space,

03:17.240 --> 03:24.300
 in the political science space, there's tensions. What is it like to do great science in a time

03:24.300 --> 03:27.960
 of a pandemic when there's political tensions?

03:27.960 --> 03:35.880
 It's very unfortunate. Pasteur said science knows no one country. He was right about that.

03:35.880 --> 03:42.600
 My whole career in genetics, especially, has depended upon international collaboration between

03:42.600 --> 03:48.760
 scientists as a way to make discoveries, get things done. Scientists, by their nature,

03:48.760 --> 03:55.160
 like to be involved in international collaborations. The Human Genome Project, for heaven's sake,

03:55.160 --> 03:59.920
 2,400 scientists in six countries working together, not worrying who is going to get

03:59.920 --> 04:04.200
 the credit, giving all the data away. I was the person who was supposed to keep all that

04:04.200 --> 04:08.840
 coordinated. It was a wonderful experience, and that included China. That was sort of

04:08.840 --> 04:15.080
 their first real entry into a big international, big science kind of project, and they did

04:15.080 --> 04:19.560
 their part. It's very different now.

04:19.560 --> 04:26.760
 Continuing the line of difficult questions, especially difficult ethical questions. In

04:26.760 --> 04:32.880
 2014, U.S. put a hold on gain of function research in response to a number of laboratory

04:32.880 --> 04:38.880
 biosecurity incidents, including anthrax, smallpox, and influenza. In December 2017,

04:38.880 --> 04:44.480
 NIH lifted this ban because, quote, gain of function research is important in helping

04:44.480 --> 04:49.820
 us identify, understand, and develop strategies and effective countermeasures against rapidly

04:49.820 --> 04:56.440
 evolving pathogens that pose a threat to public health. All difficult questions have arguments

04:56.440 --> 05:03.400
 on both sides. Can you argue the pros and cons of gain of function research with viruses?

05:03.400 --> 05:11.200
 I can, and first let me say this term, gain of function, is causing such confusion that

05:11.200 --> 05:16.760
 I need to take a minute and just sort of talk about what the common scientific use of that

05:16.760 --> 05:22.600
 term is and where it is very different when we're talking about the current oversight

05:22.600 --> 05:28.820
 of potentially dangerous human pathogens. As you know, in science, we're doing gain

05:28.820 --> 05:36.440
 of function experiments all the time. We support a lot of cancer immunotherapy at NIH. Right

05:36.440 --> 05:41.400
 here in our clinical center, there are trials going on where people's immune cells are taken

05:41.400 --> 05:46.720
 out of their body, treated with a genetic therapy that revs up their ability to discover

05:46.720 --> 05:52.880
 the cancer that that patient currently has, maybe even at stage four, and then give them

05:52.880 --> 05:59.020
 back as those little ninja warriors go after the cancer. It sometimes works dramatically.

05:59.020 --> 06:03.220
 That's gain of function. You gave that patient a gain in their immune function that may have

06:03.220 --> 06:08.580
 saved their life. We've got to be careful not to say, oh, gain of function is bad. Most

06:08.580 --> 06:15.080
 of what we do in science that's good involves quite a bit of that. We are all living with

06:15.080 --> 06:18.920
 gains of function every day. I have a gain of function because I'm wearing these eyeglasses.

06:18.920 --> 06:25.800
 Otherwise, I would not be seeing you as clearly. I'm happy for that gain of function. That's

06:25.800 --> 06:30.560
 where a lot of confusion has happened. The kind of gain of function which is now subject

06:30.560 --> 06:36.960
 to very rigorous and very carefully defined oversight is when you are working with an

06:36.960 --> 06:43.000
 established human pathogen that is known to be potentially causing a pandemic and you

06:43.000 --> 06:50.240
 are enhancing or potentially enhancing its transmissibility or its virulence. We call

06:50.240 --> 07:01.040
 that EPPP, enhanced potential pandemic pathogen. That requires this very stringent oversight

07:01.040 --> 07:08.520
 worked out over three years by the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity that

07:08.520 --> 07:14.560
 needs to be looked at by a panel that goes well beyond NIH to decide are the benefits

07:14.560 --> 07:21.840
 worth the risks in that situation. Most of the time, it's not worth the risk. Only three

07:21.840 --> 07:28.440
 times in the last three or four years have experiments been given permission to go forward.

07:28.440 --> 07:35.680
 They were all on influenza. So I will argue that if you're worried about the next pandemic,

07:35.680 --> 07:40.160
 the more you know about the coming enemy, the better chance you have to recognize when

07:40.160 --> 07:47.660
 trouble is starting. And so if you can do it safely, studying influenza or coronaviruses

07:47.660 --> 07:53.720
 like SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV2 would be a good thing to be able to know about. But you

07:53.720 --> 07:59.600
 have to be able to do it safely because we all know lab accidents can happen. I mean,

07:59.600 --> 08:05.280
 look at SARS where there have been lab accidents and people have gotten sick as a result. We

08:05.280 --> 08:09.280
 don't want to take that chance unless there's a compelling scientific reason. That's why

08:09.280 --> 08:16.160
 we have this very stringent oversight. The experiments being done at the Wuhan Institute

08:16.160 --> 08:24.800
 of Virology as a subaward to our grant to EcoHealth in New York did not meet that standard

08:24.800 --> 08:29.280
 of requiring that kind of stringent oversight. I want to be really clear about that because

08:29.280 --> 08:34.760
 there's been so much thrown around about it. Was it gain of function? Well, in the standard

08:34.760 --> 08:39.520
 use of that term that you would use in science in general, you might say it was. But in the

08:39.520 --> 08:48.320
 use of that term that applies to this very specific example of a potential pandemic pathogen,

08:48.320 --> 08:55.920
 absolutely not. So nothing went on there that should not have happened based upon the oversight.

08:55.920 --> 09:02.300
 There was an instance where the grantee institution failed to notify us about the result of an

09:02.300 --> 09:07.280
 experiment that they were supposed to tell us where they mixed and matched some viral

09:07.280 --> 09:15.400
 genomes and got a somewhat larger viral load as a result. But it was not EPPP. It was not

09:15.400 --> 09:19.680
 getting into that zone that would have required this higher level of scrutiny. It was all

09:19.680 --> 09:22.920
 bat viruses. These were not human pathogens.

09:22.920 --> 09:29.200
 So they didn't cross a threshold within that gray area that makes for an EPPP?

09:29.200 --> 09:34.860
 They did not. And anybody who's willing to take the time to look at what EPPP means and

09:34.860 --> 09:39.280
 what those experiments were would have to agree with what I just said.

09:39.280 --> 09:43.800
 What is the biggest reason it didn't cross that threshold? Is it because it wasn't jumping

09:43.800 --> 09:50.160
 to humans? Is it because it did not have a sufficient increase in virulence or transmissibility?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.160
 What's your sense?

09:51.160 --> 10:00.960
 EPPP only applies to agents that are known human pathogens of pandemic potential. These

10:00.960 --> 10:07.600
 were all bat viruses derived in the wild, not shown to be infectious to humans. Just

10:07.600 --> 10:11.640
 looking at what happened if you took four different bat viruses and you tried moving

10:11.640 --> 10:17.200
 the spike protein gene from one into one of the others to see whether it would bind better

10:17.200 --> 10:21.280
 to the ACE2 receptor. That doesn't get across that threshold.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.160
 And let me also say, for those who are trying to connect the dots here, which is the most

10:26.160 --> 10:32.600
 troubling part of this, and say, well, this is how SARS CoV2 got started. That is absolutely

10:32.600 --> 10:40.320
 demonstrably false. These bat viruses that were being studied had only about 80% similarity

10:40.320 --> 10:46.080
 in their genomes to SARS CoV2. They were like decades away in evolutionary terms. And it

10:46.080 --> 10:51.600
 is really irresponsible for people to claim otherwise.

10:51.600 --> 10:58.440
 Speaking of people who claim otherwise, Rand Paul, what do you make of the battle of words

10:58.440 --> 11:03.920
 between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci over this particular point?

11:03.920 --> 11:09.440
 I don't want to talk about specific members of Congress, but I will say it's really unfortunate

11:09.440 --> 11:17.480
 that Tony Fauci, who is the epitome of a dedicated public servant, has now somehow been targeted

11:17.480 --> 11:23.920
 for political reasons as somebody that certain figures are trying to discredit, perhaps to

11:23.920 --> 11:29.320
 try to distract from their own failings. This never should have happened. Here's a person

11:29.320 --> 11:35.880
 who's dedicated his whole life to trying to prevent illnesses from infectious diseases,

11:35.880 --> 11:43.000
 including HIV in the 1980s and 90s, and now probably the most knowledgeable infectious

11:43.000 --> 11:49.280
 disease physician in the world, and also a really good communicator, is out there telling

11:49.280 --> 11:54.620
 the truth about where we are with SARS CoV2 to certain political figures who don't want

11:54.620 --> 12:00.520
 to hear it, and who are therefore determined to discredit him. And that is disgraceful.

12:00.520 --> 12:06.480
 So with politicians, they often play games with black and white. They try to sort of

12:06.480 --> 12:13.560
 use the gray areas of science and then paint their own picture. But I have a question about

12:13.560 --> 12:19.160
 the gray areas of science. So like you mentioned, gain of function is a term that has very specific

12:19.160 --> 12:25.120
 scientific meaning, but it also has a more general term. And it's very possible to argue

12:25.120 --> 12:31.320
 that the, not to argue, not the way politicians argue, but just as human beings and scientists,

12:31.320 --> 12:38.440
 that there was a gain of function achieved at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but it

12:38.440 --> 12:44.160
 didn't cross a threshold. I mean, there's a, it's a, but it could have too. So here's

12:44.160 --> 12:50.660
 the thing. When you do these kinds of experiments, unexpected results may be achieved. And that's

12:50.660 --> 12:58.400
 the gray area of science. You're taking risks with such experiments. And I am very uncomfortable

12:58.400 --> 13:03.280
 that we can't discuss the uncertainty in the gray area of this.

13:03.280 --> 13:08.740
 Oh, I'm comfortable discussing the gray area. What I'm uncomfortable with is people deciding

13:08.740 --> 13:14.900
 to define for themselves what that threshold is based on sort of some political argument.

13:14.900 --> 13:21.880
 The threshold was very explicitly laid out. Everybody agreed to that in the basis of this

13:21.880 --> 13:27.440
 three years of deliberation. So that's what it is. If that threshold needs to be reconsidered,

13:27.440 --> 13:32.360
 let's reconsider it, but let's not try to take an experiment that's already been done

13:32.360 --> 13:37.640
 and decide that the threshold isn't what it was, because that really is doing a disservice

13:37.640 --> 13:38.880
 to the whole process.

13:38.880 --> 13:44.240
 I wish there was a discussion, even in response to Rand Paul, I know we're not talking about

13:44.240 --> 13:48.680
 specific senators, but just that particular case, I'm saying stuff here. I wish there

13:48.680 --> 13:55.080
 was an opportunity to talk about, given the current threshold, this is not gain of function.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.400
 But maybe we need to reconsider the threshold and have an action. That's an opportunity

13:58.400 --> 14:02.920
 for discussion about the ethics of gain of function. You said that there was three studies

14:02.920 --> 14:07.760
 that passed that threshold with influenza. That's a fascinating human question, scientific

14:07.760 --> 14:14.920
 question about ethics, because like you said, there's pros and cons. You're taking risks

14:14.920 --> 14:24.960
 here to prevent horribly destructive viruses in the future, but you also are risking creating

14:24.960 --> 14:33.480
 such viruses in the future. With nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, nuclear energy promises

14:33.480 --> 14:40.200
 a lot of positive effects, and yet you're taking risks here. With mutually shared destruction,

14:40.200 --> 14:49.880
 nations possessing nuclear weapons, a lot of people argue that nuclear weapons is the

14:49.880 --> 14:55.960
 reason we've prevented world wars, and yet they also have the risk of starting world

14:55.960 --> 15:01.880
 wars. And this is what we have to be honest about with the benefits and risks of science,

15:01.880 --> 15:06.160
 that you have to make that calculation. What are the pros and what are the cons?

15:06.160 --> 15:10.840
 I'm totally with you, but I want to reassure you, Lex, that this is not an issue that's

15:10.840 --> 15:16.520
 been ignored. That this issue about the kind of gain of function that might result in a

15:16.520 --> 15:22.400
 serious human pathogen has been front and center in many deliberations for a decade

15:22.400 --> 15:28.100
 or more, involved a lot of my time along the way, by the way, and has been discussed publicly

15:28.100 --> 15:34.400
 on multiple occasions, including two major meetings of the National Academy of Sciences,

15:34.400 --> 15:39.480
 getting input from everybody and ultimately arriving at our current framework. Now, we

15:39.480 --> 15:47.480
 actually back in January of 2020, just before COVID 19 changed everything, had planned and

15:47.480 --> 15:55.880
 even charged that same National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity to reconvene and look

15:55.880 --> 16:00.080
 at the current framework and say, do we have it right? Let's look at the experience over

16:00.080 --> 16:06.320
 those three years and say, is the threshold too easy, too hard? Do we need to reconsider

16:06.320 --> 16:10.920
 it? Let's look at the experience. COVID came along, the members of the board said, please,

16:10.920 --> 16:14.840
 we're all infectious disease experts. We don't have time for this right now. But I think

16:14.840 --> 16:18.920
 the time is right to do this. I'm totally supportive of that. And that should be just

16:18.920 --> 16:23.320
 as public a discussion as you can imagine about what are the benefits and the risks.

16:23.320 --> 16:27.560
 And if somebody decided, ultimately, this came together and said, we just shouldn't

16:27.560 --> 16:31.720
 be doing these experiments under any circumstances. If that was the conclusion, well, that would

16:31.720 --> 16:35.200
 be the conclusion. But it hasn't been so far.

16:35.200 --> 16:42.960
 If we can briefly look out into the next hundred years on this. I apologize for the existential

16:42.960 --> 16:52.200
 questions. But it seems obvious to me that as gain of function type of research and development

16:52.200 --> 16:59.200
 becomes easier and cheaper, it will become greater and greater risk. So if it doesn't

16:59.200 --> 17:07.440
 no longer need to be contained within laboratories of high security, it feels like this is one

17:07.440 --> 17:12.880
 of the greatest threats facing human civilization. Do you worry that at some point in the future

17:12.880 --> 17:18.600
 a leaked manmade virus may destroy most of human civilization?

17:18.600 --> 17:24.760
 I do worry about the risks. And at the moment where we have the greatest control, the greatest

17:24.760 --> 17:30.440
 oversight is when this is federally funded research. But as you're alluding, there's

17:30.440 --> 17:36.040
 no reason to imagine that's the only place that this kind of activity would go on. If

17:36.040 --> 17:42.520
 there was an evil source that wished to create a virus that was highly pathogenic in their

17:42.520 --> 17:49.640
 garage, the technology does get easier. And there is no international oversight about

17:49.640 --> 17:55.000
 this either that you could say has the same stringency as what we have in the United States.

17:55.000 --> 18:03.560
 So yes, that is a concern. It would take a seriously deranged group or person to undertake

18:03.560 --> 18:10.720
 this on purpose, given the likelihood that they too would go down. We don't imagine there

18:10.720 --> 18:16.120
 are going to be bioweapons that only kill your enemies and don't kill you. Sorry, we're

18:16.120 --> 18:24.560
 too much alike for that to work. So I don't see it as an imminent risk. There's lots of

18:24.560 --> 18:31.040
 scary novels and movies written about it. But I do think it's something we have to consider.

18:31.040 --> 18:36.280
 What are all the things that ought to be watched? You may not know that if somebody is ordering

18:36.280 --> 18:44.880
 a particular oligonucleotide from one of the main suppliers, and it happens to match smallpox,

18:44.880 --> 18:51.480
 they're going to get caught. So there is effort underway to try to track any nefarious actions

18:51.480 --> 18:52.480
 that might be going on.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.960
 In the United States or internationally? Is there an international collaboration of try

18:55.960 --> 18:57.440
 to track this stuff?

18:57.440 --> 19:03.560
 There is some. I wish it were stronger. This is a general issue, Lex, in terms of do we

19:03.560 --> 19:09.120
 have a mechanism, particularly when it comes to ethical issues, to be able to decide what's

19:09.120 --> 19:13.720
 allowable and what's not and enforce it. I mean, look where we are with germline genome

19:13.720 --> 19:18.300
 editing for humans, for instance. There is no enforcement mechanism. There's just bully

19:18.300 --> 19:22.000
 pulpits and governments that get to decide for themselves.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.360
 You talked about evil. What about incompetence? Does that worry you? I was born in the Soviet

19:26.360 --> 19:35.200
 Union. My dad, a physicist, worked at Chernobyl. That comes to mind. That wasn't evil. I don't

19:35.200 --> 19:40.120
 know what word you want to put it. Maybe incompetence is too harsh. Maybe it's the inherent incompetence

19:40.120 --> 19:44.800
 of bureaucracy. I don't know. But for whatever reason, there was an accident. Does that worry

19:44.800 --> 19:45.800
 you?

19:45.800 --> 19:50.880
 Of course it does. We know that SARS, for instance, did manage to leak out of a lab

19:50.880 --> 19:56.760
 in China two or three times. At least in some instances, people died, fortunately quickly

19:56.760 --> 20:03.840
 contained. All one can do in that circumstance, because you need to study the virus and understand

20:03.840 --> 20:09.760
 it in order to keep it from causing a broader pandemic, but you need to insist upon the

20:09.760 --> 20:17.680
 kind of biosecurity, the BSL 2, 3, and 4 framework under which those experiments have to be done.

20:17.680 --> 20:22.480
 Certainly at NIH, we're extremely rigorous about that, but you can't count on every human

20:22.480 --> 20:27.840
 being to always do exactly what they're supposed to. There's a risk there, which is another

20:27.840 --> 20:34.200
 reason why if we're contemplating supporting research on pathogens that might be the next

20:34.200 --> 20:39.320
 pandemic, you have to factor that in, not just whether people are going to do something

20:39.320 --> 20:42.500
 that we couldn't have predicted, where all of a sudden they created a virus that's much

20:42.500 --> 20:47.120
 worse without knowing they were going to do that, but also just having an accident. That's

20:47.120 --> 20:54.440
 in the mix when those estimates are done about whether the risk is worth it or not.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.320
 Continuing on line of difficult questions.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.960
 We're going to get to fun stuff after a while.

20:58.960 --> 21:10.660
 We will soon, I promise. You are the director of the NIH. You are Dr. Anthony Fauci's, technically

21:10.660 --> 21:11.720
 his boss.

21:11.720 --> 21:12.720
 Yep.

21:12.720 --> 21:17.920
 You have stood behind him. You have supported him, just like you did already in this conversation.

21:17.920 --> 21:25.160
 It is painful for me to see division and distrust, but many people in politics and elsewhere

21:25.160 --> 21:31.220
 have called for Anthony Fauci to be fired. When there are such calls of distrust in public

21:31.220 --> 21:38.280
 about a leader like Anthony Fauci, who should garner trust, do you think he should be fired?

21:38.280 --> 21:47.960
 Probably not. To do so would be basically to give the opportunity for those who want

21:47.960 --> 21:54.240
 to make up stories about anybody to destroy them. There is nothing in the ways in which

21:54.240 --> 22:02.520
 Tony Fauci has been targeted that is based upon truth. How could we then accept those

22:02.520 --> 22:08.860
 cries for his firing as having legitimacy? It's a circular argument. They've decided

22:08.860 --> 22:14.720
 they don't like Tony, so they make up stuff and they twist comments that he's made about

22:14.720 --> 22:19.620
 things like gain of function, where he's referring to the very specific gain of function that's

22:19.620 --> 22:24.800
 covered by this policy, and they're trying to say he lied to the Congress. That's simply

22:24.800 --> 22:31.000
 not true. They don't like the fact that Tony changes the medical recommendations about

22:31.000 --> 22:36.820
 what to do with COVID 19 over the space of more than a year. They call that flip flopping

22:36.820 --> 22:40.320
 and you can't trust the guy because he says one thing last year and one thing this year.

22:40.320 --> 22:45.620
 Well, the science has changed. Delta variant has changed everything. You don't want him

22:45.620 --> 22:49.520
 to be saying the same thing he did a year ago. That would be wrong now. It was the best

22:49.520 --> 22:53.760
 we could do then. People don't understand that or else they don't want to understand

22:53.760 --> 23:01.400
 it. So when you basically whip up a largely political argument against a scientist and

23:01.400 --> 23:06.520
 hammer at it over and over again to the point where he now has to have 24 seven security

23:06.520 --> 23:11.920
 to protect him against people who really want to do violence to him. For that to be a reason

23:11.920 --> 23:17.600
 to say that then he should be fired is to hand the evil forces the victory. I will not

23:17.600 --> 23:27.160
 do that. Yet there's something difficult I'm going to try to express to you. So it may

23:27.160 --> 23:33.760
 be your guitar playing. It may be something else, but there's a humility to you. It may

23:33.760 --> 23:45.920
 be because you're a man of God. There's a humility to you that garners trust. And when

23:45.920 --> 23:51.400
 you're in a leadership position representing science, especially in catastrophic events

23:51.400 --> 23:59.800
 like the pandemic, it feels like as a leader, you have to go far above and beyond your usual

23:59.800 --> 24:07.080
 duties. And I think there's no question that Anthony Fauci has delivered on his duties,

24:07.080 --> 24:11.840
 but it feels like he needs to go above as a science communicator. And if there's a large

24:11.840 --> 24:20.080
 number of people that are distrusting him, it's also his responsibility to garner their

24:20.080 --> 24:27.400
 trust to gain their trust as a person who's the face of science. Do you, are you torn

24:27.400 --> 24:34.160
 on this? The responsibility of Anthony Fauci of yourself to represent science, not just

24:34.160 --> 24:41.400
 the communication of advising what should be done, but giving people hope, giving people

24:41.400 --> 24:47.320
 trust in science and alleviating division. Do you think that's also responsibility of

24:47.320 --> 24:50.640
 a leader or is that unfair to ask?

24:50.640 --> 24:55.380
 I think the best way you give people trust is to tell them the truth. And so they recognize

24:55.380 --> 24:59.920
 that when you're sharing information, it's the best you've got at that point. And Tony

24:59.920 --> 25:06.920
 Fauci does that at every moment. I don't think him expressing more humility would change

25:06.920 --> 25:12.740
 the fact that they're looking for a target of somebody to blame, to basically distract

25:12.740 --> 25:19.480
 people from the failings of their own political party. Maybe I'm less targeted, not because

25:19.480 --> 25:25.640
 of a difference in the way in which I convey the information. I'm less visible. If Tony

25:25.640 --> 25:31.320
 were out of the scene and I was placed in that role, I'd probably be seeing a ratcheting

25:31.320 --> 25:34.480
 up of that same targeting.

25:34.480 --> 25:42.600
 I would like to believe that if Tony Fauci said that when I originally made recommendations

25:42.600 --> 25:48.320
 not to wear masks, that was given on the, on the, our best available data. And now we

25:48.320 --> 25:54.620
 know that is a mistake. So admit with humility that there's an error. That's not, that's

25:54.620 --> 26:00.520
 not actually correct, but that's a, that's a statement of humility. And I would like

26:00.520 --> 26:07.760
 to believe, despite the attacks, he would win a lot of people over with that. So a lot

26:07.760 --> 26:13.720
 of people, as you're saying, would use that, see that here we go, here's that Dr. Anthony

26:13.720 --> 26:20.880
 Fauci making mistakes. How can we trust them on anything? I believe if he was that public

26:20.880 --> 26:28.240
 display of humility to say that I made an error, that would win a lot of people over.

26:28.240 --> 26:34.680
 That's my, that's kind of my sense to face the fire of the attacks from politics. You

26:34.680 --> 26:40.960
 have to, like politicians will attack no matter what, but the question is the people, to win

26:40.960 --> 26:47.240
 over the people. The biggest concern I've had is that there was this, this stress of

26:47.240 --> 26:53.360
 science that's been brewing and I'm, maybe you can correct me, but I'm a little bit unwilling

26:53.360 --> 27:00.520
 to fully blame the politicians because politicians play their games no matter what. It just feels

27:00.520 --> 27:05.880
 like this was an opportunity to inspire people with the power of science. The development

27:05.880 --> 27:11.440
 of the vaccines, no matter what you think of those vaccines is one of the greatest accomplishments

27:11.440 --> 27:19.360
 in the history of science. And the fact that that's not inspiring, listen, I host a podcast.

27:19.360 --> 27:25.840
 Whenever I say positive stuff about the vaccine, I get to hear a lot of different opinions.

27:25.840 --> 27:31.080
 The fact that I do is a big problem to me because it's an incredible, an incredible

27:31.080 --> 27:38.840
 accomplishment of science. And so I, I, I, I, I'm sorry, but I have to put responsibility

27:38.840 --> 27:44.120
 on the leaders, even if it's not their mistakes. That's what the leadership is. That's what

27:44.120 --> 27:48.640
 leadership is. You take responsibility for the situation. I wonder if there's something

27:48.640 --> 27:56.480
 that could have been done better to give people hope that science will save us as opposed

27:56.480 --> 28:00.840
 to science will divide us.

28:00.840 --> 28:07.120
 I think you have more confidence in the ability to get beyond our current divisions than I

28:07.120 --> 28:14.000
 do after seeing just how deep and dark they have become. Tony Fauci has said multiple

28:14.000 --> 28:20.560
 times the recommendation about not wearing masks was for two reasons, a shortage of masks,

28:20.560 --> 28:26.000
 which were needed in hospitals and a lack of realization early in the course of the

28:26.000 --> 28:34.760
 epidemic that this was a virus that could heavily infect asymptomatic people. As that

28:34.760 --> 28:40.080
 changed, he changed. Now, did he make an error? No, he was making a judgment based on the

28:40.080 --> 28:45.520
 data available at the time, but he certainly made that clear over and over again. It has

28:45.520 --> 28:51.680
 not stopped those who would like to demonize him from saying, well, he just flip flopped.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.480
 You can't trust a guy. He says one thing today and one thing tomorrow.

28:55.480 --> 29:02.800
 Well, masks is a tricky one. So I'm actually early on, I'm a coauthor on a paper, one of

29:02.800 --> 29:09.400
 many, but this was a survey paper overlooking the, the evidence. It's a summary of the evidence

29:09.400 --> 29:17.120
 we have for the effectiveness of masks. It seems that it's difficult to do rigorous scientific

29:17.120 --> 29:18.120
 study on masks.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.120
 It is difficult.

29:19.120 --> 29:26.000
 There's a lot of philosophical and ethical questions I want to ask you, but within this,

29:26.000 --> 29:33.760
 it's back to your words and Anthony Fauci's words. When you're dealing with so much uncertainty

29:33.760 --> 29:40.960
 and so much potential uncertainty about how catastrophic this virus is in the early days,

29:40.960 --> 29:47.800
 and knowing that each word you say may create panic, how do you communicate science with

29:47.800 --> 29:56.520
 the world? It's a philosophical, it's an ethical, it's a practical question. There was a discussion

29:56.520 --> 30:06.480
 about masks a century ago and that too led to panic. So, I mean, I'm trying to put myself

30:06.480 --> 30:10.700
 in the mind, in your mind, in the mind of Anthony Fauci in those early days, knowing

30:10.700 --> 30:17.220
 that there's limited supply of masks. Like, what do you say? Do you fully convey the uncertainty

30:17.220 --> 30:23.960
 of the situation of the, of the challenges of the supply chain? Or do you say that masks

30:23.960 --> 30:32.600
 don't work? That's a complicated calculation. How do you make that calculation?

30:32.600 --> 30:41.060
 It is a complicated calculation. As a scientist, your temptation would be to give a full brain

30:41.060 --> 30:46.080
 dump of all the details of the information about what's known and what isn't known and

30:46.080 --> 30:51.160
 what experiments need to be done. Most of the time that's not going to play well in

30:51.160 --> 30:55.960
 a soundbite on the evening news. So you have to kind of distill it down to a recommendation

30:55.960 --> 31:01.340
 that is the best you can do at that time with the information you've got.

31:01.340 --> 31:08.740
 So you're a man of God. And we'll return to that to talk about some, some also unanswerable

31:08.740 --> 31:15.580
 philosophical questions. But first let's linger on the vaccine because in the, in the religious,

31:15.580 --> 31:19.200
 in the Christian community, there was some hesitancy with the vaccine.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
 Still is.

31:20.200 --> 31:27.900
 There's a lot of data showing high efficacy and safety of vaccines, of COVID vaccines,

31:27.900 --> 31:33.120
 but still they are far from perfect as all vaccines are. Can you empathize with people

31:33.120 --> 31:39.000
 who are hesitant to take the COVID vaccine or to have their children take the COVID vaccine?

31:39.000 --> 31:44.980
 I can totally empathize, especially when people are barraged by conflicting information coming

31:44.980 --> 31:50.920
 at them from all kinds of directions. I've spent a lot of my time in the last year trying

31:50.920 --> 31:59.100
 to figure out how to do a better job of listening because I think we have all got the risk of

31:59.100 --> 32:06.240
 assuming we know the basis for somebody's hesitancy. And that often doesn't turn out

32:06.240 --> 32:14.780
 to be what you thought. And the variety of reasons is quite broad. I think a big concern

32:14.780 --> 32:20.180
 is just this sense of uncertainty about whether this was done too fast and that corners were

32:20.180 --> 32:28.100
 cut and there are good answers to that. Along with that, a sense that maybe this vaccine

32:28.100 --> 32:33.920
 will have longterm effects that we won't know about for years to come. And one can say that

32:33.920 --> 32:38.080
 hasn't been seen with other vaccines and there's no particular reason to think this one's going

32:38.080 --> 32:41.980
 to be different than the dozens of others that we have experience with. But you can't

32:41.980 --> 32:49.540
 absolutely say, no, there's no chance of that. So it does come down to listening and then

32:49.540 --> 32:57.460
 trying in a fashion that doesn't convey a message that you're smarter than the person

32:57.460 --> 33:02.580
 you're talking to because that isn't going to help to really address what the substance

33:02.580 --> 33:09.540
 is of the concerns. But my heart goes out to so many people who are fearful about this

33:09.540 --> 33:16.220
 because of all the information that has been dumped on them. Some of it by politicians,

33:16.220 --> 33:24.380
 a lot of it by the internet, some of it by parts of the media that seem to take pleasure

33:24.380 --> 33:31.700
 in stirring up this kind of fear for their own reasons. And that is shameful. I'm really

33:31.700 --> 33:38.220
 sympathetic with the people who are confused and fearful. I am not sympathetic with people

33:38.220 --> 33:44.060
 who are distributing information that's demonstrably false and continue to do so. They're taking

33:44.060 --> 33:54.740
 lives. I didn't realize how strong that sector of disinformation would be. And it's been

33:54.740 --> 34:00.740
 in many ways more effective than the means of spreading the truth. This is going to take

34:00.740 --> 34:06.260
 us into another place. But Lex, if there's something I'm really worried about in this

34:06.260 --> 34:10.980
 country, and it's not just this country, but it's the one I live in, is that we have another

34:10.980 --> 34:20.740
 epidemic besides COVID 19. And it's an epidemic of the loss of the anchor of truth. That truth

34:20.740 --> 34:27.100
 as a means of making decisions, truth as a means of figuring out how to wrestle with

34:27.100 --> 34:33.300
 a question like, should I get this vaccine for myself or my children, seems to have lost

34:33.300 --> 34:42.780
 its primacy. And instead, it's an opinion of somebody who expressed it very strongly,

34:42.780 --> 34:51.440
 or some Facebook post that I read two hours ago. And for those to become substitutes for

34:51.440 --> 34:58.820
 objective truth, not just, of course, for vaccines, but for many other issues, like

34:58.820 --> 35:06.020
 was the 2020 election actually fair? This worries me deeply. It's bad enough to have

35:06.020 --> 35:12.660
 polarization and divisions, but to have no way of resolving those by actually saying,

35:12.660 --> 35:18.180
 okay, what's true here, makes me very worried about the path we're on. And I'm usually an

35:18.180 --> 35:19.180
 optimist.

35:19.180 --> 35:27.220
 Well, to give you an optimistic angle on this, I actually think that the sense that there's

35:27.220 --> 35:35.100
 no one place for truth is just a thing that will inspire leaders and science communicators

35:35.100 --> 35:39.740
 to speak, not from a place of authority, but from a place of humility. I think it's just

35:39.740 --> 35:46.940
 challenging people to communicate in a new way, to be listeners first. I think the problem

35:46.940 --> 35:59.380
 isn't that there's a lot of misinformation. I think that the internet and the world are

35:59.380 --> 36:06.340
 distrustful of people who speak as if they possess the truth with an authoritarian kind

36:06.340 --> 36:12.780
 of tone, which was, I think, defining for what science was in the 20th century. I just

36:12.780 --> 36:20.100
 think it has to sound different in the 21st. In the battle of ideas, I think humility and

36:20.100 --> 36:27.260
 love wins. And that's how science wins, not through having quote unquote truth. Because

36:27.260 --> 36:34.300
 now everybody can just say, I have the truth. I think you have to speak, like I said, from

36:34.300 --> 36:40.480
 humility, not authority. And so it's just challenges our leaders to go back and learn

36:40.480 --> 36:48.260
 to be, pardon my French, less assholes and more kind. And like you said, to listen, to

36:48.260 --> 36:52.580
 listen to the experiences of people that are good people, not the ones who are trying to

36:52.580 --> 36:58.380
 manipulate the system or play a game and so on, but real people who are just afraid of

36:58.380 --> 37:03.700
 uncertainty of hurting those they loved and so on. So I think it's just an opportunity

37:03.700 --> 37:09.020
 for leaders to go back and take a class on effective communication.

37:09.020 --> 37:14.780
 I'm with you on shifting more from where we are to humility and love. That's got to be

37:14.780 --> 37:18.500
 the right answer. That's very biblical, by the way.

37:18.500 --> 37:24.060
 We'll get there. I have to bring up Joe Rogan. I don't know if you know who he is.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.060
 I do.

37:25.060 --> 37:30.460
 He's a podcaster, comedian, fighting commentator, and my now friend.

37:30.460 --> 37:32.700
 And Iver Mecton believer too.

37:32.700 --> 37:38.620
 Yes. That is the question I have to ask you about. He has gotten some flack in the mainstream

37:38.620 --> 37:44.540
 media for not getting vaccinated. And when he got COVID recently, taking Iver Mecton

37:44.540 --> 37:50.380
 as part of a cocktail of treatments. The NIH actually has a nice page on Iver Mecton saying

37:50.380 --> 37:57.100
 quote, there's insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against the use of Iver Mecton

37:57.100 --> 38:02.860
 for the treatment of COVID 19 results from adequately powered, well designed and well

38:02.860 --> 38:07.900
 conducted clinical trials are needed to provide more specific evidence based guidance on the

38:07.900 --> 38:12.500
 role of Iver Mecton in the treatment of COVID 19.

38:12.500 --> 38:17.460
 So let me ask, why do you think there has been so much attack on Joe Rogan and anyone

38:17.460 --> 38:24.980
 else that's talking about Iver Mecton when there's insufficient evidence for or against?

38:24.980 --> 38:30.120
 Well let's unpack that. First of all, I think the concerns about Joe are not limited to

38:30.120 --> 38:37.260
 his taking Iver Mecton. Much more seriously, his being fairly publicly negative about vaccines

38:37.260 --> 38:44.420
 at a time where people are dying. 700,000 people have died from COVID 19 estimates by

38:44.420 --> 38:50.900
 Kaiser or at least 100,000 of those were unnecessary deaths of unvaccinated people. And for Joe

38:50.900 --> 39:00.840
 to promote that further, even as this pandemic rages through our population is simply irresponsible.

39:00.840 --> 39:05.900
 So yeah, the Iver Mecton is just one other twist. Obviously Iver Mecton has been controversial

39:05.900 --> 39:11.540
 for months and months. The reason that it got particular attention is because of the

39:11.540 --> 39:16.740
 way in which it seemed to have captured the imagination of a lot of people and to the

39:16.740 --> 39:21.780
 point where they were taking doses that were intended for livestock and some of them got

39:21.780 --> 39:28.940
 pretty sick as a result from overdosing on this stuff. That was not good judgment. The

39:28.940 --> 39:35.500
 drug itself remains uncertain. There's a recent review that looks at all of the studies of

39:35.500 --> 39:41.540
 Iver Mecton and basically concludes that it probably doesn't work. We are running a study

39:41.540 --> 39:47.660
 right now. I looked at that data this morning in a trial called active six, which is one

39:47.660 --> 39:52.980
 of the ones that my public private partnership is running. We're up to about 400 patients

39:52.980 --> 39:58.820
 who've been randomized to Iver Mecton or placebo and should know perhaps as soon as a month

39:58.820 --> 40:04.620
 from now in a very carefully controlled trial, did it help or did it not? So there will be

40:04.620 --> 40:11.020
 an answer coming back to Joe again. I don't think the fact that he took the Iver Mecton

40:11.020 --> 40:16.140
 and hoping it might work, uh, is that big a knock against him. It's more the conveying

40:16.140 --> 40:21.240
 of we don't trust what science says, which is vaccines are going to save your life. We're

40:21.240 --> 40:25.340
 going to trust what's on the internet that says Iver Mecton and hydroxychloroquine really

40:25.340 --> 40:28.260
 do work, even though the scientific community says probably not.

40:28.260 --> 40:34.080
 So let me push back in that a little bit. So he doesn't, he doesn't say, let's not listen

40:34.080 --> 40:44.020
 to science. He doesn't say the vaccine don't get vaccinated. He says it's okay to ask questions.

40:44.020 --> 40:50.600
 I'm okay with that. How risky is the vaccine for certain populations? What are the benefits

40:50.600 --> 40:57.800
 and risks? There's other friends of Joe and friends of mine, like Sam Harris, who says,

40:57.800 --> 41:04.780
 if you look at the data, it's obvious that the benefits outweigh the risks. And what Joe says

41:04.780 --> 41:11.960
 is yes, but let's still openly talk about risks. And he often brings up anecdotal evidence

41:11.960 --> 41:18.780
 of people who've had, uh, highly negative effects from vaccines. Science is not done

41:18.780 --> 41:24.780
 with anecdotal evidence. And so you could infer a lot of stuff from the way he expresses

41:24.780 --> 41:30.260
 it, but he also communicates a lot of interesting questions. Uh, and that's something maybe

41:30.260 --> 41:36.660
 you can comment on this. You know, there's certain groups that are healthy. They have,

41:36.660 --> 41:41.740
 they're younger, they have, they exercise a lot. They get the all, you know, nutrition

41:41.740 --> 41:48.960
 and all those kinds of things. He shows skepticism on whether it's so obvious that they should

41:48.960 --> 41:55.240
 get vaccinated. And the same is he makes this, he kind of presents the same kind of skepticism

41:55.240 --> 42:07.480
 for kids, for young kids. So with empathy and, uh, you know, listening my Russian ineliquent

42:07.480 --> 42:13.680
 description of what Joe believes, what, what is your kind of response to that? Why should

42:13.680 --> 42:18.320
 certain categories of healthy and young people still get vaccinated? Do you think?

42:18.320 --> 42:22.380
 Well, first just to say it's great for Joe to be a skeptic, to ask questions. We should

42:22.380 --> 42:26.760
 all be doing that. But then the next step is to go and see what the data says and see

42:26.760 --> 42:32.740
 if they're actually answers to those questions. So coming to healthy people, I've done a bunch

42:32.740 --> 42:40.820
 of podcasts besides this one. The one I think I remember most was a podcast with a worldwide

42:40.820 --> 42:48.240
 wrestling superstar. Very nice. He's about six foot six and just absolutely solid muscle.

42:48.240 --> 42:57.800
 And he got COVID and he almost died. And recovering from that, he said, I've got to let my supporters

42:57.800 --> 43:04.320
 know because you can imagine worldwide wrestling fans are probably not big embracers of the

43:04.320 --> 43:13.060
 need for vaccines. And he want, he just turned himself into a spokesperson for the fact that

43:13.060 --> 43:18.920
 this virus doesn't care how healthy you are, how much you exercise, what a great specimen

43:18.920 --> 43:26.520
 you are. It wiped him out. And we see that, you know, the average person in the ICU right

43:26.520 --> 43:31.880
 now with COVID 19 is under age 50. I think there's a lot of people still thinking, Oh,

43:31.880 --> 43:35.080
 it's just those old people in the nursing homes. That's not going to be about me. They're

43:35.080 --> 43:40.680
 wrong. And there are plenty of instances of people who were totally healthy with no underlying

43:40.680 --> 43:46.200
 diseases, taking good care of themselves, not obese exercising who have died from this

43:46.200 --> 43:54.500
 disease. 700 children have died from this disease. Yes. Some of them had underlying

43:54.500 --> 44:00.400
 factors like obesity, but a lot of them did not. So it's fair to say younger people are

44:00.400 --> 44:07.900
 less susceptible to serious illness, kids even less so, and then young adults, but it

44:07.900 --> 44:15.540
 ain't zero. And if the vaccine is really safe and really effective, then you probably want

44:15.540 --> 44:20.240
 everybody to take advantage of that. Even though some are dropping their risks more

44:20.240 --> 44:26.520
 than others, everybody's dropping their risks. Some, are you worried about variants? So looking

44:26.520 --> 44:33.000
 out into the future, what's your vision for all the possible trajectories that this virus

44:33.000 --> 44:40.800
 takes in human society? I'm totally worried about the variants. Delta was such an impressive

44:40.800 --> 44:47.460
 arrival on the scene in all the wrong ways. I mean, it took over the world in the space

44:47.460 --> 44:53.960
 of just a couple months because of its extremely contagious ability. Viruses would be beautiful

44:53.960 --> 44:58.460
 if they weren't terrifying. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this whole story of viral evolution

44:58.460 --> 45:03.360
 scientifically is just amazingly elegant. Anybody who really wanted to understand how

45:03.360 --> 45:09.920
 evolution works in real time, study SARS CoV 2, because it's not just Delta, it's Alpha,

45:09.920 --> 45:16.520
 it's Beta, and it's Gamma, and it's the fact that these sweep through the world's population

45:16.520 --> 45:23.280
 by fairly minor differences in fitness. So the real question many people are wrestling

45:23.280 --> 45:30.280
 is, is Delta it? Is it such a fit virus that nothing else will be able to displace it?

45:30.280 --> 45:37.520
 I don't know. I mean, there's now Delta AY4, which is a variant of Delta that at least

45:37.520 --> 45:43.800
 in the UK seems to be taking over the Delta population as though it's maybe even a little

45:43.800 --> 45:49.320
 more contagious. That might be the first hint that we're seeing something new here. It's

45:49.320 --> 45:55.720
 not a completely different virus. It's still Delta, but it's Delta Plus. You know, the

45:55.720 --> 46:07.480
 big worry is what's out there that is so different that the vaccine protection doesn't work.

46:07.480 --> 46:12.440
 And we don't know how different it needs to be for the vaccine to start working. That's

46:12.440 --> 46:18.120
 the terrifying thing about each of these variants. It's like, it's always a pleasant surprise

46:18.120 --> 46:21.200
 that a vaccine seems to still have efficacy.

46:21.200 --> 46:27.080
 And hooray for our immune system, may I say, because the vaccine immunized you against

46:27.080 --> 46:35.840
 that original Wuhan virus. Now we can see that especially after two doses and even more

46:35.840 --> 46:42.080
 so after a booster, your immune system is so clever that it's also making a diversity

46:42.080 --> 46:47.760
 of antibodies to cover some other things that might happen to that virus to make it a little

46:47.760 --> 46:54.440
 different. And you're still getting really good coverage. Even for beta, which was South

46:54.440 --> 47:00.680
 Africa B1351, which is the most different, it looks pretty good. But that doesn't mean

47:00.680 --> 47:06.200
 it will always be as good as that if something gets really far away from the original virus.

47:06.200 --> 47:11.720
 Now the good news is we would know what to do in that situation. The mRNA vaccines allow

47:11.720 --> 47:19.160
 you to redesign the vaccine like that and to quickly get it through a few thousand participants

47:19.160 --> 47:23.200
 in a clinical trial to be sure it's raising antibodies and then bang, you could go. But

47:23.200 --> 47:28.720
 I don't want to have to do that. There will be people's lives at risk in the meantime.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.240
 And what's the best way to keep that from happening? Well, try to cut down the number

47:32.240 --> 47:37.400
 of infections because you don't get variants unless the virus is replicating in a person.

47:37.400 --> 47:44.200
 So how do we solve this thing? How do we get out of this pandemic? What's like, if you

47:44.200 --> 47:51.080
 had a, like a wand or something, or you could really implement policies, what's the full

47:51.080 --> 47:56.800
 cocktail of solutions here? It's a full cocktail. It's not just one thing. In our own country

47:56.800 --> 48:01.920
 here in the US, it would be getting those 64 million reluctant people to actually go

48:01.920 --> 48:05.840
 ahead and get vaccinated. There's 64 million people who didn't get vaccinated? Adults.

48:05.840 --> 48:13.640
 Yes. Not even counting the kids. 64 million. Isn't that astounding? Get the kids vaccinated.

48:13.640 --> 48:18.240
 Hopefully their parents will see that as a good thing too. Get those of us who are due

48:18.240 --> 48:22.060
 for boosters boosted because that's going to reduce our likelihood of having breakthrough

48:22.060 --> 48:27.600
 infections and keep spreading it. Convince people that until we're really done with this,

48:27.600 --> 48:32.880
 and we're not now, that social distancing and mask wearing indoors are still critical

48:32.880 --> 48:39.200
 to cut down the number of new infections. But of course, that's our country. This is

48:39.200 --> 48:45.400
 a worldwide pandemic. I worry greatly about the fact that low and middle income countries

48:45.400 --> 48:50.480
 have for the most part, not even gotten started with access to vaccines. And we have to figure

48:50.480 --> 48:56.880
 out a way to speed that up because otherwise that's where the next variant will probably

48:56.880 --> 49:01.820
 arrive. And who knows how bad it will be. And it will cross the world quickly as we've

49:01.820 --> 49:05.960
 seen happen repeatedly in the last 22 months.

49:05.960 --> 49:14.540
 I think I'm really surprised, annoyed, frustrated that rapid at home testing from the very beginning

49:14.540 --> 49:20.780
 wasn't a big, big part of the solution. First of all, nobody's against it. That's one huge

49:20.780 --> 49:28.400
 plus for testing. Everybody supports. Second of all, that's what America is good at is

49:28.400 --> 49:33.680
 mask manufacturer stuff, like stepping up, engineers stepping up and really deploying

49:33.680 --> 49:39.680
 it. Plus, without the collection of data is giving people freedom, is giving them information

49:39.680 --> 49:44.040
 and then freedom to decide what to do with that information. It's such a powerful solution.

49:44.040 --> 49:49.520
 I don't understand. Well, now I think the Biden administration is, I think, emphasized

49:49.520 --> 49:54.120
 like the scaling of testing manufacturers. But I just feel like it's an obvious solution.

49:54.120 --> 49:59.480
 Get a test that costs less than a dollar to manufacture, costs less than a dollar to buy.

49:59.480 --> 50:03.980
 And just everybody gets tested every single day. Don't share that data with anyone. You

50:03.980 --> 50:08.280
 just make the decisions. And I believe in the intelligence of people to make the right

50:08.280 --> 50:11.120
 decision to stay at home when the test is positive.

50:11.120 --> 50:15.720
 I am so completely with you on that. And NIH has been smack in the middle of trying to

50:15.720 --> 50:25.440
 make that dream come true. We're running a trial right now in Georgia, Indiana, Hawaii.

50:25.440 --> 50:32.000
 And where is the other one? Oh, Kentucky. Basically blanketing a community with free

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
 testing.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
 That's beautiful.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.100
 And look to see what happens as far as stemming the spread of the epidemic and measuring it

50:39.100 --> 50:43.460
 by wastewater because you can really tell whether you've cut back the amount of infection

50:43.460 --> 50:50.780
 in the community. Yeah, I'm so with you. We got off to such a bad start with testing.

50:50.780 --> 50:55.840
 And of course, all the testing was being done for the first several months in big box laboratories

50:55.840 --> 50:59.940
 where you had to send the sample off and put it through the mail somehow and get the result

50:59.940 --> 51:04.320
 back sometimes five days later after you've already infected a dozen people. It was just

51:04.320 --> 51:08.720
 a completely wrong model. But it's what we had. And everybody was like, oh, we got to

51:08.720 --> 51:13.480
 stick with PCR because if you start using those home tests that are based on antigens,

51:13.480 --> 51:18.280
 lateral flow, probably there's going to be false positives and false negatives. Okay,

51:18.280 --> 51:24.960
 sure. No test is perfect. But having a test that's not acceptable or accessible is the

51:24.960 --> 51:26.220
 worst setting.

51:26.220 --> 51:32.560
 So we, NIH, with some requests from Congress, got a billion dollars to create this program

51:32.560 --> 51:39.040
 called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics, RADx. And we turned into a venture capital

51:39.040 --> 51:42.920
 organization, and we invited every small business or academic lab that had a cool idea about

51:42.920 --> 51:47.040
 how to do home testing to bring it forward. And we threw them into what we called our

51:47.040 --> 51:52.600
 shark tank of business experts, engineers, technology people, people who understood how

51:52.600 --> 51:59.760
 to deal with supply chains and manufacturing. And right now today, there are about two million

51:59.760 --> 52:05.600
 tests being done based on what came out of that program, including most of the home tests

52:05.600 --> 52:10.400
 that you can now buy on the pharmacy shelves. We did that. And I wish we had done it faster,

52:10.400 --> 52:15.640
 but it was an amazingly speedy effort. And you're right, companies are really good. Once

52:15.640 --> 52:20.440
 they've got an FDA emergency use authorization, and we helped a lot of them get that, they

52:20.440 --> 52:28.000
 can scale up their manufacturing. I think in December, we should have about 410 million

52:28.000 --> 52:34.080
 tests for that month ready to go. And if we can get one or two more platforms approved,

52:34.080 --> 52:39.400
 and by the way, we are now helping FDA by being their validation lab. If we can get

52:39.400 --> 52:44.880
 a couple more of these approved, we could be in the half a billion tests a month, which

52:44.880 --> 52:47.040
 is really getting where we need to be.

52:47.040 --> 52:52.160
 Wow. Yeah, that's a dream. That's a dream for me. It seems like an obvious solution,

52:52.160 --> 52:57.720
 engineering solution. Everybody's behind it, at least to hope versus division. I love it.

52:57.720 --> 52:58.720
 Yeah.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.720
 A happy story.

52:59.720 --> 53:00.720
 A happy story.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.680
 I was waiting for one.

53:02.680 --> 53:07.480
 Yeah. All right. Well, one last dive into the not happy, but you won't even have to

53:07.480 --> 53:15.240
 comment on it. Well, comment on the broader philosophical question. So NIH, again, I said,

53:15.240 --> 53:20.480
 Joe Rogan is the first one who pointed me to this. NIH was recently accused of funding

53:20.480 --> 53:25.720
 research of a paper that had images of sedated puppies with their heads inserted into small

53:25.720 --> 53:32.720
 enclosures containing disease carrying sand flies. So I can just say that this story is

53:32.720 --> 53:40.280
 not true, or at least the... I think it is true that the paper that showed those images

53:40.280 --> 53:45.160
 cited NIH as a funding source, but that citation is not correct.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.720
 That was not correct.

53:46.720 --> 53:54.760
 Yeah. But that brings up a bigger philosophical question, that it could have been correct.

53:54.760 --> 53:59.240
 How difficult is it as a director of NIH or just NIH as an organization that's funding

53:59.240 --> 54:07.600
 so many amazing deep research studies to ensure the ethical fortitude of those studies when

54:07.600 --> 54:14.000
 the ethics of science is... There's such a gray area between what is and what isn't ethical.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.920
 Well, tough issues. Certainly animal research is a tough issue.

54:19.920 --> 54:26.320
 I was going to bring up as a good example of that tough issue is in 2015, you announced

54:26.320 --> 54:32.160
 that NIH will no longer support any biomedical research involving chimpanzees. So that's

54:32.160 --> 54:39.480
 like one example of looking in the mirror, thinking deeply about what is and isn't ethical.

54:39.480 --> 54:45.120
 And there was a conclusion that biomedical research on chimps is not ethical.

54:45.120 --> 54:49.120
 That was the conclusion. That was based on a lot of deep thinking and a lot of input

54:49.120 --> 54:54.840
 from people who have considered this issue and a panel of the National Academy of Sciences

54:54.840 --> 55:00.880
 that was asked to review the issue. I mean, the question that I wanted them to look at

55:00.880 --> 55:06.800
 was, are we actually learning anything that's really essential from chimpanzee invasive

55:06.800 --> 55:14.080
 research at this point? Or is it time to say that these closest relatives of ours should

55:14.080 --> 55:19.240
 not be subjected to that any further and ought to be retired to a sanctuary?

55:19.240 --> 55:24.520
 And that was the conclusion that there was really no kind of medical experimentation

55:24.520 --> 55:29.840
 that needed to be done on chimps in order to proceed. So why are we still doing this?

55:29.840 --> 55:36.640
 Many of these were chimpanzees that were purchased because we thought they would be good hosts

55:36.640 --> 55:43.140
 for HIV AIDS, and they sort of weren't. And they were kept around in these primate laboratories

55:43.140 --> 55:48.420
 with people coming up with other things to do, but they weren't compelling scientifically.

55:48.420 --> 55:52.960
 So I think that was the right decision. I took a lot of flak from some of the scientific

55:52.960 --> 55:57.320
 community said, well, you're caving in to the animal rights people. And now that you've

55:57.320 --> 56:05.520
 said no more research on chimps, what's next? Certainly when it comes to companion animals,

56:05.520 --> 56:12.520
 everybody's heart starts to be hurting when you see anything done that seems harmful to

56:12.520 --> 56:18.320
 a dog or a cat. I have a cat, I don't have a dog. And I understand that completely. That's

56:18.320 --> 56:24.500
 why we have these oversight groups that decide before you do any of that kind of research,

56:24.500 --> 56:32.500
 is it justified? And what kind of provision is going to be made to avoid pain and suffering?

56:32.500 --> 56:39.300
 And those have input from the public as well as the scientific community. Is that completely

56:39.300 --> 56:47.400
 saying that every step that's happening there is ethical by some standard that would be

56:47.400 --> 56:54.740
 hard for anybody to agree to? No, but at least it's a consensus of what people think is acceptable.

56:54.740 --> 57:02.040
 Dogs are the only host for some diseases like leishmaniasis, which was that paper that we

57:02.040 --> 57:06.400
 were not responsible for, but I know why they were doing the experiment, or like lymphatic

57:06.400 --> 57:13.040
 filariasis, which is an experiment that we are supporting in Georgia that involves dogs

57:13.040 --> 57:16.940
 getting infected with a parasite, because that's the only model we have to know whether

57:16.940 --> 57:23.600
 a treatment is going to work or not. So I will defend that. I am not in the place of

57:23.600 --> 57:28.440
 those who think all animal research is evil, because I think if there's something that's

57:28.440 --> 57:33.820
 going to be done to save a child from a terrible disease or an adult, and it involves animal

57:33.820 --> 57:39.400
 research that's been carefully reviewed, then I think ethically why it doesn't make me comfortable,

57:39.400 --> 57:45.280
 it still seems like it's the right choice. I think to say all animal research should

57:45.280 --> 57:50.960
 be taken off the table is also very unethical, because that means you have basically doomed

57:50.960 --> 57:58.200
 a lot of people for whom that research might have saved their lives to having no more hope.

57:58.200 --> 58:03.480
 And to me personally, there's far greater concerns ethically in terms of factory farming,

58:03.480 --> 58:06.800
 for example, the treatment of animals in other contexts.

58:06.800 --> 58:12.560
 There's so much that goes on outside of medical research that is much more troubling.

58:12.560 --> 58:17.860
 That said, I think all cats have to go. That's just my off the record opinion. That's why

58:17.860 --> 58:22.360
 I'm not involved with any ethical decisions. I'm just joking internet ethic. I love cats.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.360
 You're a dog person.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.360
 I'm a dog person. I'm sorry.

58:24.360 --> 58:29.920
 Have you seen the New Yorker cartoon where there are two dogs in the bar having a martini

58:29.920 --> 58:34.200
 and one is saying they're dressed up in their business suits and one says to the other,

58:34.200 --> 58:39.680
 you know, it's not enough for the dogs to win. The cats have to lose.

58:39.680 --> 58:47.680
 That's beautiful. So a few weeks ago, you've announced that you're resigning from the NIH

58:47.680 --> 58:48.920
 at the end of the year.

58:48.920 --> 58:53.660
 I'm stepping down. I'm still going to be at NIH at a different capacity.

58:53.660 --> 59:02.360
 Right. And it's over a decade of an incredible career overseeing the NIH as its director.

59:02.360 --> 59:07.660
 What are the things you're most proud of, of the NIH in your time here as its director

59:07.660 --> 59:12.920
 may be memorable moments?

59:12.920 --> 59:22.680
 There's a lot in 12 years. Science has just progressed in amazing ways over those 12 years.

59:22.680 --> 59:28.040
 Think about where we are right now. Something like gene editing, being able to make changes

59:28.040 --> 59:35.040
 in DNA, even for therapeutic purposes, which is now curing sickle cell disease. Unthinkable

59:35.040 --> 59:42.400
 when I became director in 2009. The ability to study single cells and ask them what they're

59:42.400 --> 59:48.800
 doing and get an answer. Single cell biology just has emerged in this incredibly powerful

59:48.800 --> 59:57.000
 way. Having the courage to be able to say we could actually understand the human brain

59:57.000 --> 1:00:04.400
 seemed like so far out there. And we're in the process of doing that with the Brain Initiative.

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:09.920
 Taking all that we've learned about the genome and applying it to cancer to make individual

1:00:09.920 --> 1:00:15.880
 cancer treatment really precision. And developing cancer immunotherapy, which seemed like sort

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:22.640
 of a backwater into some of the hottest science around. All those things sort of erupting.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.080
 And much more to come, I'm sure. We're on an exponential curve of medical research advances,

1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:35.400
 and that's glorious to watch. And of course, COVID 19, as a beneficiary of decades of basic

1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:41.080
 science, understanding what mRNA is, understanding basics about coronaviruses and spike proteins

1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:46.320
 and how to combine structural biology and immunology and genomics into this package

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:52.160
 that allows you to make a vaccine in 11 months. Just I would never have imagined that possible

1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:57.800
 in 2009. So to have been able to kind of be the midwife, helping all of those things get

1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:05.200
 birthed, that's been just an amazing 12 years. And as NIH director, you have this convening

1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:10.340
 power and this ability to look across the whole landscape of biomedical research and

1:01:10.340 --> 1:01:16.240
 identify areas that are just like ready for something big to happen. But it isn't going

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:21.120
 to happen spontaneously without some encouragement, without pulling people together from different

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:24.940
 disciplines who don't know each other and maybe don't know how to quite understand each

1:01:24.940 --> 1:01:29.880
 other's scientific language and create an environment for that to happen. That has been

1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:35.400
 just an amazing experience. I mean, I mentioned the Brain Initiative as one of those. The

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:41.280
 Brain Initiative right now, I think there's about 600 investigators working on this. Last

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:46.320
 week, the whole issue of Nature magazine was about the output of the Brain Initiative basically

1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:51.760
 now giving us a cell census of what those cells in the brain are doing, which has just

1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:59.040
 never been imaginable. And interestingly, more than half of the investigators in the

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:04.460
 Brain Initiative are engineers. They're not biologists in a traditional sense. I love

1:02:04.460 --> 1:02:10.640
 that. Maybe partly because my PhD is in quantum mechanics. So I think it's really a good idea

1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:16.600
 to bring disciplines together and see what happens. That's an exciting thing. And I will

1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:23.000
 not ever forget having the chance to announce that program in the East Room in that White

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:29.560
 House with President Obama, who totally got it and totally loved science and working with

1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:35.240
 him in some of those rare moments of sort of one on one conversation in the Oval Office,

1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:38.120
 just him and me about science. That's a gift.

1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:44.600
 What's it like talking to Barack Obama about science? He seems to be a sponge. I've heard

1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:49.800
 him. I'm an artificial intelligence person. And I've heard him talk about AI. And it was

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:54.000
 like, it made me think, is somebody like whispering in his ear or something? Because he was saying

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:58.600
 stuff that totally passed the BS test, like he really understands stuff.

1:02:58.600 --> 1:02:59.600
 He does.

1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:04.240
 That means he listened to a bunch of experts on AI. He was explaining the difference between

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:08.920
 narrow artificial intelligence and strong AI. He was saying all this, both technical

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:14.940
 and philosophical stuff. And it just made me, I don't know, it made me hopeful about

1:03:14.940 --> 1:03:18.680
 the depth of understanding that a human being in political office can attain.

1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:24.340
 That gave me hope as well, and having those experiences. Oftentimes in a group, I mean,

1:03:24.340 --> 1:03:28.380
 another example was trying to figure out, how do we take what we've learned about the

1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:34.080
 genome and really apply it at scale to figure out how to prevent illness, not just treat

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:40.160
 it, but prevent it, out of which came this program called All of Us, this million strong

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.280
 American cohort of participants who make their electronic health records and their genome

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:50.120
 sequences and everything else available for researchers to look at. That came out of a

1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:58.720
 couple of conversations with Obama and others in his office, and he asked the best questions.

1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:03.440
 That was what struck me so much. I mean, a room full of scientists, and we'd be talking

1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:09.400
 about the possible approaches, and he would come up with this incredibly insightful penetrating

1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:12.060
 question. Not that he knew what the answer was going to be, but he knew what the right

1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:13.360
 question was.

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:19.760
 I think the core to that is curiosity. I don't think he's even like, he's trying to be a

1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:22.120
 good leader. He's legit curious.

1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:23.120
 Yes.

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:24.120
 Legit.

1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:29.520
 That he, almost like a kid in a candy store, gets to talk to the world experts. He somehow

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:35.520
 sneaked into this office and gets to talk to the world experts. That's the kind of energy

1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:40.640
 that I think leads to beautiful leadership in the space of science.

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:45.000
 Indeed. Another thing I've been able to do as director is to try to break down some of

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.360
 the boundaries that seem to be traditional between the public and the private sectors.

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:54.000
 When it comes to areas of science that really could and should be open access anyway, why

1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:03.160
 don't we work together? That was obvious early on. After identifying a few possible collaborators

1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:08.740
 who are chief scientists of pharmaceutical companies, it looked like we might be able

1:05:08.740 --> 1:05:10.560
 to do something in that space.

1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:16.320
 Out of that was born something called the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, AMP. It

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:21.640
 took a couple of years of convening people who usually didn't talk to each other. There

1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:27.220
 was a lot of suspicion. Academic scientists saying, oh, those scientists in pharma, they're

1:05:27.220 --> 1:05:32.280
 not that smart. They're just trying to make money. The academic scientists getting the

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:36.160
 rap from the pharmaceutical scientists, all they want to do is publish papers. They don't

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:38.360
 really care about helping anybody.

1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:44.400
 We found out both of those stereotypes were wrong. Over the course of that couple of years,

1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:50.120
 we built a momentum behind three starting projects, one on Alzheimer's, one on diabetes,

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:54.280
 one on rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Very different, each one of them trying to identify

1:05:54.280 --> 1:06:00.520
 what is an area that we both really need to see advance and we could do better together.

1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:05.400
 It's going to have to be open access, otherwise NIH is not going to play. Guess what, industry?

1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:08.960
 If you really want to do this, you got to have skin in the game. We'll cover half the

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:10.720
 cost. You got to cover the other half.

1:06:10.720 --> 1:06:16.600
 I love it. Enforcing open access, resulting in open science.

1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:21.000
 Millions of dollars gone into this and it has been a wild success. After many people

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:27.880
 were skeptical, a couple of years later, we had another project on Parkinson's. More recently,

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:35.520
 we added one on schizophrenia. Just this week, we added one on gene therapy, on bespoke gene

1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:41.320
 therapy for ultra rare diseases, which otherwise aren't going to have enough commercial appeal.

1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:45.800
 If we did this together, especially with FDA at the table, and they have been, we could

1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:51.080
 make something happen, turn this into a standardized approach where everything didn't have to be

1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:54.760
 a one off. I'm really excited about that.

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:59.680
 What began as three projects is six and it's about to be seven next year with a heart failure

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:06.040
 and all of us have gotten to know each other. If it weren't for that background when COVID

1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:11.160
 came along, it would have been a lot harder to build the partnership called ACTIV, which

1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:17.440
 has been my passion for the last 20 months, accelerating COVID 19 therapeutic interventions

1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:18.440
 and vaccines.

1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:23.320
 We just had our leadership team meeting this morning. It was amazing what's been accomplished.

1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:28.380
 That's pretty much 100 people who dropped everything just to work on this, about half

1:07:28.380 --> 1:07:34.520
 from industry and half from government and academia. That's how we got vaccine master

1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:40.520
 protocols designed. We all agreed about what the endpoints had to be and you wondered why

1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:46.440
 are there 30,000 participants in each of these trials? That's because of ACTIV's group mapping

1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:51.240
 out what the power needed to be for this to be convincing.

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:58.080
 Same with therapeutics. We have run at least 20 therapeutic agents through trials that

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:02.880
 ACTIV supported in record time. That's how we got monoclonal antibodies that we know

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:12.200
 work. That would not have been possible if I didn't already have a sense of how to work

1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:17.680
 with the private sector that came out of AMP. AMP took two years to get started. ACTIV took

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:20.600
 two weeks. We just kept the lawyers.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:21.920
 Wow, to get 100 people over?

1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:25.920
 Yeah, kept the lawyers out of the room and away we went.

1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:34.120
 Now you're going to get yourself in trouble. I do hope one day the story of this incredible

1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:38.080
 vaccine development of vaccine protocols and trials and all this kind of details, the messy

1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:44.280
 beautiful details of science and engineering that led to the manufacturing, the deployment

1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:48.960
 and the scientific test. It's such a nice dance between engineering in the space of

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:53.840
 manufacturing the vaccines. You start before the studies are complete, you start making

1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:59.160
 the vaccines just in case that if the studies proved to be positive, then you can start

1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:05.280
 deploying them just like so many parties, like you said, private and public playing

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:11.840
 together. That's just a beautiful dance that is one of the, for me, the sources of hope

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:20.800
 in this very tricky time where there's a lot of things to be cynical about in terms of

1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:24.480
 the games politicians play and the hardship experience of the economy and all those kinds

1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:31.800
 of things. That to me, this dance was a vaccine development was done just beautifully and

1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:33.240
 it gives me hope.

1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:38.880
 It does me as well. And it was in many ways the finest hour that science has had in a

1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:44.960
 long time being called upon when every day counted and making sure that time was not

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:50.240
 wasted and things were done rigorously, but quickly.

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:56.360
 So, you're incredibly good as a leader of the NIH. It seems like you're having a heck

1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:02.320
 of a lot of fun. Why step down from this role after so much fun?

1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:09.640
 Well, no other NIH director has served more than one president after being appointed by

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:14.160
 one. You're sort of done. And the idea of being carried over for a second presidency

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:20.440
 with Trump and now a third one with Biden is unheard of. I just think, Lex, that scientific

1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:26.720
 organizations benefit from new vision and 12 years is a really long time to have the

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:33.440
 same leader. And if I wasn't going to stick it out for the entire Biden four year term,

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:39.120
 it's good not to wait too late during that to signal an intent to step down because the

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:43.080
 president's got to find the right person, got to nominate them, got to get the Senate

1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:47.680
 to confirm them, which is an unpredictable process right now.

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:52.840
 And you don't want to try to do that in the second half of somebody's term as president.

1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:56.860
 This has got to happen now. So, I kind of decided back at the end of May that this should

1:10:56.860 --> 1:11:04.840
 be my final year. And I'm okay with that. I do have some mixed emotions because I love

1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:13.440
 the NIH. I love the job. It's exhausting. I'm traditionally for the last 20 months anyway,

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:19.800
 working 100 hours a week. It's just, that's what it takes to juggle all of this. And that

1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:24.680
 keeps me from having a lot of time for anything else. And I wouldn't mind because I don't

1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:30.000
 think I'm done yet. I wouldn't mind having some time to really think about what the next

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.240
 chapter should be. And I have none of that time right now. Do I have another calling?

1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:40.200
 Is there something else I could contribute that's different than this? I'd like to find

1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.800
 that out.

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:49.760
 I think the right answer is you're just stepping down to focus on your music career.

1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:54.080
 That might not be a good plan for anything very sustainable.

1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:59.080
 But I think that is a sign of a great leader as George Washington did stepping down at

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:00.080
 the right time.

1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:01.080
 Ted Williams.

1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:02.080
 Yes.

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:07.920
 He quit when I think he hit a home run on his last at bat and his average was 400 at

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:08.920
 the time.

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:15.200
 No one to walk away. I mean, it's hard, but it's beautiful to see in a leader. You also

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:22.540
 oversaw the human genome project. You mentioned the brain initiative, which has, it's a dream

1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:29.580
 to map the human brain. And there's the dream to map the human code, which was the human

1:12:29.580 --> 1:12:34.920
 genome project. And you have said that it is humbling for me and awe inspiring to realize

1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:41.240
 that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only

1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:48.400
 to God. How does that, if you can just kind of wax poetic for a second, how does it make

1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:55.360
 you feel that we were able to map this instruction book, look into our own code, and be able

1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:59.360
 to reverse engineer it?

1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:06.520
 It's breathtaking. It's so fundamental. And yet, for all of human history, we're ignorant

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:13.420
 of the details of what that instruction book looked like. And then we crossed a bridge

1:13:13.420 --> 1:13:19.120
 into the territory of the known. And we had that in front of us still written in a language

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:23.740
 that we had to learn how to read. And we're in the process of doing that and will be for

1:13:23.740 --> 1:13:31.000
 decades to come. But we owned it, we had it. And it has such profound consequences. It's

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:38.840
 it's both a book about our history. It's a book of sort of the parts list of a human

1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:43.960
 being, the genes that are in there and how they're regulated. And it's also a medical

1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:51.400
 textbook that can teach us things that will provide answers to illnesses we don't understand,

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:57.240
 and alleviate suffering and premature death. So it's a pretty amazing thing to contemplate.

1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:03.320
 And it has utterly transformed the way we do science. And it is in the process of transforming

1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:09.320
 the way we do medicine, although much of that still lies ahead. You know, while we were

1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:17.160
 working on the Genome Project, it was sort of hard to get this sense of a wellness, because

1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:21.840
 it was just hard work. And you were getting, you know, another mega base, okay, this is

1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:29.240
 good. But when did you actually step back and say, we did it? It's the profoundness

1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:33.640
 of that. I mean, there were two points, I guess. One was the announcement on that June

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:37.800
 26, 2000, where the whole world heard, well, we don't quite have it, but we got a pretty

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:45.400
 good draft. And suddenly, people are like realizing, oh, this is this a big deal. For

1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:50.560
 me, it was more when we got the full analysis of it, published it in February 2001. And

1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:55.980
 that issue of Nature paper that Eric Lander and Bob Waterston and I were the main authors,

1:14:55.980 --> 1:15:01.400
 and we toiled over and tried to get as much insight as we could in there about what the

1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:07.160
 meaning of all this was. But you also had this sense that we are such beginning readers

1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:13.360
 here. We are still in kindergarten, trying to make sense out of this 3 billion letter

1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:19.320
 book. And we're going to be at this for generations to come.

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:25.920
 You are a man of faith, Christian, and you are a man of science. What is the role of

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:35.360
 religion and of science in society and in the individual human mind and heart like yours?

1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:42.760
 Well, I was not a person of faith when I was growing up. I became a believer in my 20s,

1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:48.000
 influenced as a medical student by a recognition that I hadn't really thought through the

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:55.440
 issues of what's the meaning of life? Why are we all here? What happens when you die?

1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:01.000
 Is there a God? Science is not so helpful in answering those questions. So I had to

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:07.160
 look around in other places and ultimately came to my own conclusion that atheism, which

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:12.800
 is where I had been, was the least supportable of the choices because it was the assertion

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:20.280
 of a universal negative, which scientists aren't supposed to do. And agnosticism came

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:24.640
 as an attractive option but felt a little bit like a cop out, so I had to keep going

1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:30.580
 trying to figure out why do believers actually believe this stuff? And I came to realize

1:16:30.580 --> 1:16:34.960
 it was all pretty compelling, that there's no proof. I can't prove to you or anybody

1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:39.920
 else that God exists, but I can say it's pretty darn plausible.

1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:45.520
 And ultimately, what kind of God is it that caused me to search through various religions

1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:51.640
 and see, well, what do people think about that? And to my surprise, encountered the

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:58.840
 person of Jesus Christ as unique in every possible way and answering a lot of the questions

1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:06.880
 I couldn't otherwise answer. And somewhat kicking and screaming, I became a Christian,

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:12.720
 even though at the time, as a medical student already interested in genetics, people predicted

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:18.580
 my head would then explode because these were incompatible worldviews. They really have

1:17:18.580 --> 1:17:27.200
 not been for me. I am so fortunate, I think, that in a given day, wrestling with an issue,

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:33.360
 it can have both the rigorous scientific component and it can have the spiritual component. COVID

1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:39.760
 19 is a great example. These vaccines are both an amazing scientific achievement and

1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:45.880
 an answer to prayer. When I'm wrestling with vaccine hesitancy and trying to figure out

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:53.020
 what answers to come up with, I get so frustrated sometimes and I'm comforted by reassurances

1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:58.720
 that God is aware of that. I don't have to do this alone.

1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:05.200
 So I know there are people like your friend, Sam Harris, who feel differently. Sam wrote

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:12.920
 a rather famous op ed in the New York Times when I was nominated as the NIH director saying,

1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:21.400
 this is a terrible mistake. You can't have somebody who believes in God running the NIH.

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:23.560
 He's just going to completely ruin the place.

1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:31.440
 Well, I have a testimonial. Christopher Hitchens, a devout atheist, if I could say so, was a

1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:37.120
 friend of yours and referred to you as, quote, one of the greatest living Americans and stated

1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:41.880
 that you were one of the most devout believers he has ever met. He further stated that you

1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:46.440
 were sequencing the genome of the cancer that would ultimately claim his life and that your

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:52.560
 friendship, despite their differing opinions on religion, was an example of the greatest

1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:55.520
 confirmed truth in modern times.

1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:59.560
 What did you learn from Christopher Hitchens about life or perhaps what is a fond memory

1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:05.800
 you have of this man with whom you've disagreed, but who is also your friend?

1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:13.920
 Yeah, I loved Hitch. I'm sorry he's gone. Iron sharpens iron. There's nothing better

1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:19.200
 for trying to figure out where you are with your own situation and your own opinions,

1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:24.720
 your own worldviews, than encountering somebody who's completely in another space and who's

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:30.360
 got the gift, as Hitch did, of challenging everything and doing so over a glass of scotch

1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:33.200
 or two or three.

1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:41.360
 We got off to a rough start in an interaction we had at a rather highbrow dinner. He was

1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:48.280
 really deeply insulting of a question I was asking. I was like, okay, that's fine. Let's

1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:53.320
 figure out how we could have a more civil conversation. Then I really learned to greatly

1:19:53.320 --> 1:20:00.320
 admire his intellect and to find the jousting with him. It wasn't all about faith, although

1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:05.720
 it often was. It was really inspiring and innovating, energizing.

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:13.000
 Then when he got cancer, I became his ally, trying to help him find pathways through the

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:19.120
 various options and maybe helped him to stay around on this planet for an extra six months

1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:28.520
 or so. I have the warmest feelings of being in his apartment downtown over a glass of

1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:35.320
 wine talking about whatever. Sometimes it was science. He was fascinated by science.

1:20:35.320 --> 1:20:42.560
 Sometimes it was Thomas Jefferson. Sometimes it was faith. I knew it would always be really

1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:43.560
 interesting.

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:51.120
 He's now gone. Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?

1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:55.560
 I'm not afraid. I'm not looking forward to it. I don't want to rush it because I feel

1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:02.480
 like I got some things I can still do here. As a person of faith, I don't think I'm afraid.

1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:08.560
 I'm 71. I know I don't have an infinite amount of time left. I want to use the time I've

1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:17.840
 got in some sort of way that matters. I'm not ready to become a full time golfer, but

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:25.560
 I don't quite know what that is. I do feel that I've had a chance to do amazingly powerful

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:31.640
 things as far as experiences, and maybe God has something else in mind.

1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:37.440
 I wrote this book 16 years ago, The Language of God, about science and faith, trying to

1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:44.120
 explain how, from my perspective, these are compatible. These are in harmony. They're

1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:50.520
 complementary if you are careful about which kind of question you're asking. To my surprise,

1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:56.480
 a lot of people seem to be interested in that. They were tired of hearing the extreme voices

1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:02.760
 like Dawkins at one end and people like Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis on the other end

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:07.480
 saying, if you trust science, you're going to hell. They thought there must be a way

1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:10.720
 that these things could get along, and that's what I tried to put forward.

1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:16.440
 Then I started a foundation, BioLogos, which then I had to step away from to become NIH

1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:21.320
 director, which has just flourished, maybe because I stepped away. I don't know. It

1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:26.640
 now has millions of people who come to that website and they run amazing meetings. I think

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:31.320
 a lot of people have really come to a sense that this is okay. I can love science and

1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:36.000
 I can love God, and that's not a bad thing. So maybe there's something more I can do in

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:39.680
 that space. Maybe that book is ready for a second edition.

1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:47.920
 I think so. But when you look back, life is finite. What do you hope your legacy is?

1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:54.960
 I don't know. This whole legacy thing is a little bit hard to embrace. It feels a little

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:59.520
 self promoting, doesn't it? I sort of feel like in many ways, I went to my own funeral

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:05.760
 on October 5th when I announced that I was stepping down and I got the most amazing responses

1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:10.240
 from people, some of whom I knew really well, some of whom I didn't know at all, who were

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:16.000
 just telling me stories about something that I had contributed to that made a difference

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:21.640
 to them. That was incredibly heartwarming, and that's enough. I don't want to build

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:27.600
 an edifice. I don't have a plan for a monument or a statue. God help us.

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:33.200
 I do feel like I've been incredibly fortunate. I've had the chance to play a role in things

1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:39.840
 that were pretty profound from the Genome Project to NIH to COVID vaccines, and I ought

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:46.520
 to be plenty satisfied that I've had enough experiences here to feel pretty good about

1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:50.720
 the way in which my life panned out.

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:54.640
 We did a bunch of difficult questions in this conversation. Let me ask the most difficult

1:23:54.640 --> 1:24:03.160
 one, that perhaps is the reason you turned to God. What is the meaning of life? Have

1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:07.400
 you figured it out yet?

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:09.400
 Expect me to put that into three sentences.

1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:15.640
 We only have a couple of minutes. At least hurry up.

1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:19.280
 Well that's not a question that I think science helps me with, so you're going to push me

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:25.120
 into the faith zone, which is where I'd want to go with that. What is the meaning? Why

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:30.780
 are we here? What are we put here to do? I do believe we're here for just a blink of

1:24:30.780 --> 1:24:37.000
 an eye and that our existence somehow goes on beyond that in a way that I don't entirely

1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:43.920
 understand despite efforts to do so. I think we are called upon in this blink of an eye

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:50.200
 to try to make the world a better place, to try to love people, to try to do a better

1:24:50.200 --> 1:25:01.480
 job of our more altruistic instincts and less of our selfish instincts, to try to be what

1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:12.040
 God calls us to be, people who are holy, not people who are driven by self indulgence.

1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:17.720
 And sometimes I'm better at that than others. But I think that for me as a Christian is

1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:24.520
 a pretty clear, I mean, it's to live out the Sermon on the Mount. Once I read that,

1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:32.360
 I couldn't unread it. All those beatitudes, all the blessings, that's what we're supposed

1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:37.320
 to do. And the meaning of life is to strive for that standard, recognizing you're going

1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:44.020
 to fail over and over again, and that God forgives you. Hopefully to put a little bit

1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:51.480
 of love out there into the world. That's what it's about. Francis, I'm truly humbled and

1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:58.120
 inspired by both your brilliance and your humility and that you would spend your extremely

1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:02.040
 valuable time with me today. It was really an honor. Thank you so much for talking today.

1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:08.760
 I was glad to. And you asked a really good question. So your reputation as the best podcaster

1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:13.560
 has borne itself out here this afternoon. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to

1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:17.320
 this conversation with Francis Collins. To support this podcast, please check out our

1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:22.880
 sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Newton

1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:29.680
 reflecting on his life and work. I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore

1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:35.960
 and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary.

1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:43.200
 Whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. Thank you for listening and hope

1:26:43.200 --> 1:27:00.480
 to see you next time.
