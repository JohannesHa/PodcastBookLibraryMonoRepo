WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
 Once this whole thing falls apart

00:01.720 --> 00:04.020
 and we are climbing the kudzu vines

00:04.020 --> 00:05.460
 that spiral up the Sears Tower,

00:05.460 --> 00:06.960
 like they say in Fight Club,

00:06.960 --> 00:09.160
 Bobby will go back to his gatherer form

00:09.160 --> 00:11.320
 and be happy as a pig in shit,

00:11.320 --> 00:12.700
 just walking around in a loincloth

00:12.700 --> 00:14.080
 with his bird hanging out,

00:14.080 --> 00:16.280
 tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them

00:16.280 --> 00:18.520
 for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.240
 Do you think some level of crazy is required for comedy?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.120
 Like, at some point?

00:24.120 --> 00:25.560
 Yes.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.760
 Have there been low points in your life?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.560
 Yeah, I don't know, hey, hey.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.380
 Eh?

00:31.380 --> 00:32.220
 Eh?

00:32.220 --> 00:33.060
 Eh?

00:33.060 --> 00:33.900
 Ha ha ha ha.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.800
 The following is a conversation with Will Sasso,

00:38.800 --> 00:41.480
 a comedian, actor, podcaster,

00:41.480 --> 00:44.140
 and someone I've been a fan of for many years

00:44.140 --> 00:46.940
 since Mad TV in the late 90s

00:46.940 --> 00:50.320
 to recently with the 10 Minute Podcast

00:50.320 --> 00:54.620
 and now the new podcast called Doodzee.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.440
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.320
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:58.320 --> 00:59.520
 in the description.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.920
 And now, dear friends, here's Will Sasso.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.760
 So let's call out the elephant in the room.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.720
 You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Doodzee.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.560
 Yes.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.320
 You wore a black suit again today.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.660
 Shakespeare, then Mark Twain, said clothes make the man.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.320
 What kind of man does a suit make you?

01:22.320 --> 01:25.360
 Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow

01:25.360 --> 01:28.320
 who did not get this dry cleaned in between

01:28.320 --> 01:30.920
 because that episode of the show as we sit here now

01:30.920 --> 01:32.560
 was around a week ago.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.160
 So that's the kind of man it makes me.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.360
 Well, the nice thing is you're wearing pants, I think.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.200
 Yes, I am wearing pants.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.400
 I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.240
 That's correct.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.120
 I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion

01:45.120 --> 01:48.520
 so I'm wearing pants and I thought it fitting, obviously,

01:48.520 --> 01:51.120
 to just wear the black tie.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.020
 And clothes do make the man.

01:53.020 --> 01:56.960
 And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure,

01:56.960 --> 02:00.920
 but I do enjoy shorts because my legs get hot.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.840
 So that's what kind of man the shorts make me.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.960
 How often do you wear a suit?

02:03.960 --> 02:05.480
 I fucking hate wearing suits.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.120
 So what is this, a statement of, is it ironic?

02:09.120 --> 02:12.080
 Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast?

02:12.080 --> 02:14.080
 I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast

02:14.080 --> 02:15.240
 would be a good way to put it.

02:15.240 --> 02:19.840
 Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you

02:19.840 --> 02:21.880
 and our newfound friendship here,

02:21.880 --> 02:26.000
 which we are making on the podcast.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.400
 You and I just met.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.560
 Everything that we're saying here

02:28.560 --> 02:31.120
 is the first things that we're saying to each other.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.800
 So I'm meeting you on common ground dressed like.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.160
 Well, I've been actually a one way friend of yours

02:36.160 --> 02:38.160
 for many, many years since Mad TV.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.140
 Oh.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.320
 When did you start on Mad TV?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.280
 So that was, I mean, in 90s?

02:42.280 --> 02:43.100
 97, yeah.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.020
 97.

02:44.020 --> 02:46.640
 So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.000
 It was one of the funniest shows ever created.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
 Your whole journey watching through that

02:51.000 --> 02:53.200
 was incredible from Mad TV to Three Stooges

02:53.200 --> 02:57.040
 to the podcasts, the 10 Minute Pod

02:57.040 --> 02:59.340
 and then the new podcast is incredible.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.200
 Cheers.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.760
 My favorite role that you played

03:02.760 --> 03:05.880
 was the mountain in the Game of Thrones.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.080
 What was it like working with dragons?

03:08.080 --> 03:11.000
 Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
 on the end of C stands, but sometimes they hang out.

03:17.340 --> 03:18.180
 I am.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.000
 It's a C stand.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.080
 It's like, you know, it's like a little,

03:20.080 --> 03:21.640
 like the thing you got the camera on here.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.980
 Oh, this is like film lingo.

03:22.980 --> 03:23.960
 Yeah, no, I understand.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.680
 I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.320
 You know what a banana is?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.160
 Yeah.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.000
 It's when you walk like this.

03:29.000 --> 03:29.840
 Oh.

03:29.840 --> 03:30.660
 Do a banana.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.500
 I take it back.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.340
 I did not know what a banana was.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.180
 Yeah, see?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.160
 I misunderstood.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.880
 Yeah, cause it's just a food.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.720
 Yeah.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.560
 Normally.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.080
 You fancy Hollywood folk with a lingo.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.240
 And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson

03:44.240 --> 03:47.040
 and I am seven foot four and yeah.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.240
 So dragons don't, dragons don't scare me

03:49.240 --> 03:51.600
 even though they've been extinct for a while.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.920
 You're a scientist, right?

03:52.920 --> 03:54.160
 Is that checkout?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.600
 Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.640
 I don't know if you play video games.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.720
 There's a, there's a Skyrim video game

04:01.720 --> 04:03.320
 that's part of the Elder Scrolls series.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.400
 And for the longest time,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.440
 there's a legend that there's dragons.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.800
 I think it started in Daggerfall.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.500
 And so I always, I grew up playing those video games

04:10.500 --> 04:14.160
 and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.840
 And eventually you did in Skyrim.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.760
 So it's, dragons represent,

04:19.760 --> 04:21.120
 I don't know exactly what they represent,

04:21.120 --> 04:24.560
 but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature

04:24.560 --> 04:27.960
 that is bigger than anything humans

04:27.960 --> 04:30.880
 can possibly comprehend maybe.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.960
 Cause they're so, they're so, they show up so often in myth

04:33.960 --> 04:37.640
 from the, from the religious stories, you know,

04:37.640 --> 04:39.280
 of the snake and so on, the serpent.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.920
 And I don't know what that is.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.680
 Well, this breathing fire, that's kind of weird.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.240
 It's interesting when I think about dragons,

04:44.240 --> 04:45.480
 cause now that you bring it up,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.440
 these are people that probably wouldn't have access

04:47.440 --> 04:49.480
 to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.840
 Maybe they did.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.820
 If they didn't, they're drawing things that look like,

04:54.820 --> 04:57.200
 you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool,

04:57.200 --> 05:01.080
 that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.280
 Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that?

05:04.280 --> 05:07.200
 Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology

05:07.200 --> 05:10.640
 all the way back to, no, not cave drawings.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.560
 Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the,

05:12.560 --> 05:13.580
 and they could time travel.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.680
 So they would have gone back to the caves.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.200
 Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth

05:20.120 --> 05:23.820
 could time travel and they could plant legends

05:23.820 --> 05:25.920
 into the, into the collective intelligence

05:25.920 --> 05:27.520
 of the human species.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.400
 Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us

05:29.400 --> 05:30.600
 to do something smart with it.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.240
 And we didn't, we just came up with the sky.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.080
 No.

05:33.080 --> 05:33.900
 We're just, what's that?

05:33.900 --> 05:35.000
 Sorry, that was very offensive.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.960
 I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you with your video game.

05:37.960 --> 05:42.640
 I'm more of a burger time Donkey Kong dude.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.040
 Oh, what is that?

05:44.040 --> 05:45.120
 That's an original.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.320
 Burger time was an arcade game that later showed up

05:48.320 --> 05:52.720
 on the Intellivision, it was Intellivision.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.960
 I believe it was made by Texas Instruments,

05:54.960 --> 05:58.440
 horrible first generation video game console.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.600
 And burger time, you just, it's like Super Mario.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.000
 You just got to stay away from the eggs

06:03.000 --> 06:04.360
 and the pickles and stuff.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.080
 And you just go, and the bun falls.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.160
 And then you go down to the and the cheese and then the meat.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.520
 I'm not going to say it's as complicated

06:12.520 --> 06:16.280
 as Skyrim, but took me a while to finish it when I was seven.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.540
 Did you play video games, was that a part of your life,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.960
 a part of the source of happiness for you at all?

06:22.960 --> 06:24.040
 It was, it was.

06:24.040 --> 06:28.840
 I played video games up until around, I think in 2010,

06:28.840 --> 06:31.760
 I got the Red Ring of Death on my Xbox 360.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.600
 That was it?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.420
 That was it.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.200
 I never, or whatever the Xbox was then.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.040
 Yeah.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.320
 I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto

06:40.320 --> 06:42.840
 that was out and finished the Red Dead Redemption.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.400
 So I was doing that thing where you just drive around,

06:46.400 --> 06:49.080
 you know, the streets of New York or just ride around

06:49.080 --> 06:51.500
 on your horse shooting people and, you know,

06:51.500 --> 06:55.080
 throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.600
 And you're describing the same thing that happened

06:57.600 --> 07:01.160
 a decade later, because it's now Red Dead Redemption 2

07:01.160 --> 07:03.920
 and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.120
 Yeah, there isn't, right?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.000
 Yeah, they're working on it.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.880
 They're always flirting with that idea.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.100
 You know who else plays Skyrim?

07:10.100 --> 07:12.480
 Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of

07:12.480 --> 07:14.760
 from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.720
 He plays Skyrim?

07:15.720 --> 07:16.760
 He's a huge fan of Skyrim.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.920
 He plays every.

07:17.920 --> 07:22.440
 So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind,

07:22.440 --> 07:25.640
 do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.580
 Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons,

07:27.580 --> 07:29.540
 you can fight all kinds of things,

07:29.540 --> 07:31.920
 but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients

07:31.920 --> 07:34.000
 to make potions and all that kind of stuff.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.160
 He loves the ingredients.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.700
 He's the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world,

07:37.700 --> 07:38.540
 he's the gatherer.

07:38.540 --> 07:39.720
 He's the gatherer.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.400
 Yeah, I've heard him described that way

07:42.400 --> 07:44.520
 and he likes to describe himself that way.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.600
 I worked with Bobby not too long ago.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.200
 He came and did a couple days on this thing we were shooting

07:49.200 --> 07:52.280
 and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.260
 And if you know anything about Bobby Lee,

07:54.260 --> 07:56.160
 you'd probably be able to predict that he spent

07:56.160 --> 07:59.600
 that entire time playing farming on his iPad.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.080
 Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble,

08:03.080 --> 08:05.400
 so sometimes it's good to escape human interaction

08:05.400 --> 08:06.280
 through video games.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.120
 Totally.

08:07.120 --> 08:07.960
 I'm with him on that.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.120
 He's one of the funniest people ever.

08:11.120 --> 08:11.960
 Totally.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.560
 What do you think makes him funny?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.880
 It's just all the times you've worked with him,

08:16.880 --> 08:21.480
 the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being.

08:22.280 --> 08:26.880
 Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people,

08:26.880 --> 08:29.800
 raw performers who lets it all hang out

08:29.800 --> 08:31.680
 to the degree that he will even get naked

08:31.680 --> 08:32.720
 in front of his audience,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.600
 which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.520
 I'm bearing all, I'm showing you everything,

08:38.520 --> 08:40.920
 and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.200
 Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.480
 He embodies metaphor.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.120
 Yes, he embodies metaphor.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.240
 He's the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.720
 Bobby the gatherer metaphor.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.520
 He's a metaphor for something else,

08:52.520 --> 08:53.920
 for somebody else's life.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.200
 Someday he'll be in the dictionary

08:57.320 --> 08:58.800
 representing some kind of concept,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.120
 maybe the metaphor itself.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.480
 Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart

09:02.480 --> 09:04.800
 and we are climbing the kudzu vines

09:04.800 --> 09:06.240
 that spiral up the Sears Tower,

09:06.240 --> 09:07.760
 like they say in Fight Club,

09:07.760 --> 09:09.920
 Bobby will go back to his gatherer form

09:09.920 --> 09:12.080
 and be happy as a pig in shit,

09:12.080 --> 09:13.480
 just walking around in a loincloth

09:13.480 --> 09:14.840
 with his bird hanging out,

09:14.840 --> 09:17.080
 tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them

09:17.080 --> 09:19.400
 for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.080
 I'd love to dig into something he did.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.520
 You guys did a lot of great podcasts together.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.440
 He asked you in a very uncomfortable process

09:28.440 --> 09:29.840
 of why you don't do standup.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.480
 So let me ask you, do you hate money?

09:33.480 --> 09:36.560
 Well, I'm originally from Canada, yeah.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.880
 So yeah, I'm a fricking pinko socialist.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.760
 Is that where you come from?

09:42.760 --> 09:44.520
 That's not a nice thing to say.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.480
 I thought the Soviet Union,

09:46.480 --> 09:47.920
 that is a nice thing to say.

09:47.920 --> 09:52.920
 Like comrade, he's a good socialist with red,

09:56.240 --> 09:58.280
 like some bold colors, yeah.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.320
 There was an interesting tension in your voice

10:00.320 --> 10:01.400
 and the way you talked about it.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.200
 There's just not a source of happiness for you.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.320
 You respect the art form,

10:05.320 --> 10:08.600
 but it was not something that you were connected to,

10:08.600 --> 10:09.600
 you felt connected to.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.520
 That's a good way to put it.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.080
 Yeah, I respect the art form a lot.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.160
 And I grew up with all the albums and stuff.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.520
 I had an older brother and sister who,

10:18.520 --> 10:23.520
 so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor,

10:23.680 --> 10:26.800
 we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live,

10:26.800 --> 10:30.160
 the Gilda Radner concert, we had all sorts of stuff.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.840
 But I don't know, there's a lot of reasons.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.320
 I do feel like a career in show business

10:37.280 --> 10:41.720
 is it never goes the way you plan, like most things.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.000
 And I was fortunate enough to get started

10:44.000 --> 10:47.200
 outside of my native Vancouver or in my native Vancouver.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.600
 I grew up in the burbs outside

10:48.600 --> 10:50.600
 and there was a lot of industry there.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.480
 So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor

10:53.480 --> 10:54.720
 when I was like 16.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.720
 So yeah, there were some times early on

10:59.720 --> 11:03.240
 where I came up with some standup stuff and did it,

11:03.240 --> 11:06.080
 but yeah, I quickly abandoned it.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.760
 And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff,

11:09.760 --> 11:13.200
 and that's where my, and this is gonna sound weird.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.200
 Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby's podcast

11:16.200 --> 11:18.240
 trying to avoid his questions?

11:18.240 --> 11:20.320
 Well, he was giving you this face this whole time

11:20.320 --> 11:24.320
 that was making the whole just atmosphere feel

11:24.320 --> 11:25.160
 full of anxiety.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.960
 So I'm trying not to give you a face.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.880
 The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.200
 Yeah, okay.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.040
 Play cool, Lex.

11:31.040 --> 11:31.880
 Play cool.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.320
 You said it out loud a couple of times.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.160
 I did.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.000
 Just, you know, you cut that out.

11:35.000 --> 11:35.840
 Play cool.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.680
 Play cool, dude.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.500
 Cut out, cut it out.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.340
 Maintain, bro.

11:38.340 --> 11:39.180
 Here's what I'll say.

11:39.180 --> 11:40.000
 There's two ways to do it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.040
 I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing

11:42.040 --> 11:46.120
 for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.520
 Cause I think it's an art form that's under attack

11:49.520 --> 11:51.760
 because it's not like anything else.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.120
 You need, although now you can of course,

11:55.120 --> 11:56.480
 you know, make whatever you want.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.680
 It's the era of self publishing as far as making a product

11:59.680 --> 12:01.960
 and putting it out there, which is getting easier,

12:01.960 --> 12:03.720
 of course, and I can't wait to talk to you about that

12:03.720 --> 12:06.300
 with AI and how it's changing art.

12:07.480 --> 12:12.480
 But in standup, all you need is a microphone

12:12.480 --> 12:14.760
 and you know, perhaps it'd be good

12:14.760 --> 12:16.240
 to have some mental illness

12:16.240 --> 12:20.200
 and then you can just run up there and talk forever.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.920
 And I say this to, you know, comedians.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.260
 It's like, you guys have to deal with just

12:25.260 --> 12:29.700
 an influx of people who aren't sure

12:29.700 --> 12:30.960
 why they're doing comedy.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.640
 I would ask comedians, I mean, not good ones,

12:33.640 --> 12:34.720
 good ones, you know what they're doing,

12:34.720 --> 12:36.040
 but everyone else like, what are you doing?

12:36.040 --> 12:38.040
 Why, why are you doing standup?

12:38.040 --> 12:40.320
 Having said that, I am allergic to money.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.520
 Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that?

12:42.520 --> 12:43.360
 Why are they doing it?

12:43.360 --> 12:45.040
 Cause I actually like when I'm in Austin,

12:45.040 --> 12:47.600
 I like going to open mics, just listening.

12:47.600 --> 12:52.480
 It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people

12:52.480 --> 12:55.040
 because they've been doing it for several years.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.080
 Sometimes over a decade and they're still at it.

12:58.080 --> 12:58.960
 They're still right there.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.200
 There's going for the punch and then especially open mics

13:02.200 --> 13:05.840
 that are really sad in that there's, you know,

13:05.840 --> 13:07.960
 only like five other people in the audience

13:07.960 --> 13:10.000
 and they're usually just other comedians

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
 and they're still going all out

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
 as if they're in front of a stadium.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.720
 But that to me sounds like someone who loves it.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.560
 Yeah.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.240
 I got no questions for that person.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.880
 I got questions for someone who goes sideways

13:21.880 --> 13:24.700
 from here I'm recognizable doing something

13:24.700 --> 13:28.040
 and then I'm doing standup because it's like,

13:28.040 --> 13:30.280
 and truly look, I've been fortunate enough

13:30.280 --> 13:31.520
 to be in the business for a long time

13:31.520 --> 13:33.280
 and at this point, if I came up,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.400
 I mean, doing live stuff is fun.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.960
 I have friends that are like, you know,

13:37.960 --> 13:40.440
 some guys who are primarily sketch people

13:40.440 --> 13:42.000
 or you would look at them as sketch people

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
 and they can sell tickets for being sketch people

13:44.000 --> 13:45.560
 and they, and we'll talk about it.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.760
 And they're like, you know, I do a monologue

13:47.760 --> 13:50.360
 and I do a little standup, then I do a song,

13:50.360 --> 13:52.840
 then I do another monologue, then I play off the audience,

13:52.840 --> 13:57.360
 do a little standup, but standup is,

13:57.360 --> 14:00.040
 it's almost like playing music in that,

14:01.360 --> 14:03.120
 you know, people are going up there playing music,

14:03.120 --> 14:04.520
 but what band have you been listening to?

14:04.520 --> 14:06.380
 That's what you're gonna sound like.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.480
 So it's really, I mean, of course,

14:08.480 --> 14:10.520
 I'm speaking from zero experience,

14:10.520 --> 14:12.800
 but I've heard it takes years, of course,

14:12.800 --> 14:14.260
 to find your own voice.

14:14.260 --> 14:16.240
 Standups that when they first go up,

14:16.240 --> 14:19.880
 they're doing some sort of impersonation of so and so

14:19.880 --> 14:23.240
 and so and so, and then you gotta pop this audience

14:23.240 --> 14:25.660
 that's paying and you're gonna get run over

14:25.660 --> 14:27.480
 by the next person who's coming up

14:27.480 --> 14:29.820
 and it's hard to follow the last person

14:29.820 --> 14:31.200
 who went up before you.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.560
 And I mean, that is a really hard way to,

14:34.560 --> 14:36.960
 it's a very, it's quite a gauntlet

14:36.960 --> 14:38.640
 to be in to find your voice comedically.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.840
 But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch?

14:40.840 --> 14:42.880
 Where you still have to find your own voice

14:42.880 --> 14:44.840
 with like all the impressions you do,

14:44.840 --> 14:47.520
 they're just terrible, you know,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.480
 there are different spins and different people,

14:49.480 --> 14:52.520
 they're not like perfect impressions, right?

14:52.520 --> 14:55.880
 So that's, I mean, that's a similar kind of challenge

14:55.880 --> 14:57.800
 and journey as standup.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.200
 You're just saying they're kind of distinct

15:00.200 --> 15:02.720
 and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it,

15:02.720 --> 15:05.820
 which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to.

15:05.820 --> 15:08.440
 Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.120
 I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age,

15:11.120 --> 15:12.400
 as far back as I can remember,

15:12.400 --> 15:15.680
 and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff

15:15.680 --> 15:17.400
 and comedic acting and so on.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.320
 So comedic acting.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.920
 Yeah, early on, my influences were a very predictable list

15:22.920 --> 15:27.920
 of guys from SCTV, Early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python,

15:29.940 --> 15:32.640
 all of those performers really influenced me.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.640
 It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline,

15:36.640 --> 15:38.420
 who's an incredible actor.

15:38.420 --> 15:41.160
 I vividly remember being like 12, 13,

15:41.160 --> 15:44.480
 seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.260
 And it blew my mind, because I was like, he was hilarious.

15:47.260 --> 15:50.400
 I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.720
 And he won an Academy Award.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.720
 And at that point, I started thinking more about acting.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.480
 And then I was, like I said, really fortunate

16:00.480 --> 16:04.200
 to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it

16:04.200 --> 16:06.560
 and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.520
 And then I ended up getting represented.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.780
 And then I ended up on a teen show.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.620
 I was on, basically, the easiest way to pitch it

16:14.620 --> 16:17.680
 is it's like a Canadian, my so called life

16:17.680 --> 16:19.560
 with these kids and their lives and stuff.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.560
 And I did that for like five years and I really love acting.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.000
 I really, truly love acting.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
 And I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.240
 So that's another thing about standup.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.040
 Like I love the illusion of what I get to do

16:36.040 --> 16:40.940
 in entertainment and podcasting is great for that.

16:40.940 --> 16:45.200
 But to stand up there and, I don't know, just for me,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.840
 it's like it would have to all be fantasy.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.120
 Yeah, so Nietzsche said that every profound spirit

16:53.120 --> 16:54.200
 needs a mask.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.480
 Like you said, you don't like to talk about,

16:58.480 --> 17:01.160
 in your comedy, you don't like to talk about stuff

17:01.160 --> 17:02.640
 that's personal to you.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.660
 Yeah.

17:03.660 --> 17:04.840
 What is that?

17:04.840 --> 17:07.240
 If you were to psychoanalyze yourself,

17:07.240 --> 17:10.080
 do you think it's just not something you find funny

17:10.080 --> 17:15.080
 or are you running from something and it's not your fault?

17:15.920 --> 17:16.760
 Will.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.440
 It's not your fault, Will.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.280
 Speaking of another really great comedic actor

17:21.280 --> 17:23.480
 who's also a serious actor, Robin Williams.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.360
 One of the best serious actors.

17:25.360 --> 17:30.360
 I mean, and one of the funniest people of all time,

17:30.480 --> 17:35.000
 but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.420
 as a standup and a performer,

17:37.420 --> 17:39.760
 I almost like his serious stuff better.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
 Can I ask you a question about that?

17:41.200 --> 17:43.480
 What do you make of the, that he committed suicide?

17:43.480 --> 17:47.280
 I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing.

17:47.280 --> 17:52.280
 I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.480
 It's almost like he died for others depression.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.320
 You know what I mean?

17:55.320 --> 17:56.160
 Like.

17:56.160 --> 17:56.980
 Yeah, yeah.

17:56.980 --> 17:58.180
 You'd look at someone like that and go,

17:58.180 --> 17:59.160
 wait a minute, you're a rockstar.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.480
 Like you don't, you could just check out

18:01.480 --> 18:03.240
 if you're not liking your life.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.680
 And of course, something like suicide

18:05.680 --> 18:07.120
 begs that you look a little deeper

18:07.120 --> 18:12.120
 and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.040
 Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.960
 Is there some aspect of celebrity that is isolating

18:18.960 --> 18:21.280
 that can make you feel really lonely?

18:21.280 --> 18:22.120
 Not me.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.160
 I don't feel, no, not really.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.680
 You feel the love?

18:25.680 --> 18:28.480
 No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like,

18:28.480 --> 18:31.320
 I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group

18:31.320 --> 18:34.240
 of friends and those people don't, you know,

18:34.240 --> 18:37.040
 it's like I've known the same people for years and years.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.760
 You never really felt the celebrity really.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.000
 Nah, in LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.840
 Nobody cares.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.840
 They see you and then the next minute they see so and so.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.640
 So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
 Mike and Molly, right?

18:51.760 --> 18:52.600
 Nope, nope.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.440
 Close.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.080
 King of, you shave your head, you go bald.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.080
 Are you King of Queens?

18:57.080 --> 18:58.820
 Nope, that's not me.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.780
 So close.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.280
 You're wow, shit, you used to be the mountain

19:03.280 --> 19:04.720
 on Game of Thrones.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.080
 You look like shit, what happened?

19:06.080 --> 19:08.600
 You've been just eating fried dough?

19:08.600 --> 19:09.440
 Yeah.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.000
 Yeah, that's what's up.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.400
 Can't lift any weights anymore.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.120
 I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.100
 Ah, and people coming up to me.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.000
 You used to be a dragon killer, dude.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.920
 Half the man you used to be.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.840
 What's, have there been low points in your life?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.340
 Sorry to go there, but.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.220
 Yeah, I don't know.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.720
 Hey, hey, hey.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.560
 Eh?

19:32.560 --> 19:33.380
 Eh?

19:33.380 --> 19:34.220
 Eh?

19:34.220 --> 19:38.560
 Yeah, there's, everybody has a low point in life.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.400
 The operative.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.280
 Do you suffer from like depression

19:40.280 --> 19:41.120
 and any of those kinds of things?

19:41.120 --> 19:42.200
 You know what, I do.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.760
 I do, I have a bunch of stuff.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.760
 How do you deal with it?

19:46.760 --> 19:47.880
 Said friends?

19:47.880 --> 19:48.700
 The friends and the.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.240
 They don't do anything for me in that sense.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.080
 Yeah.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.040
 I have an incredible fiance who,

19:55.040 --> 19:58.300
 that's nice to have somebody constant

19:58.300 --> 20:01.080
 that you love very much and see as the best person

20:01.080 --> 20:02.480
 and all that good stuff.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.240
 Hopefully, vice versa.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.080
 And then.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.800
 Well, on your recent Instagram,

20:06.800 --> 20:09.520
 she said that she loves you, so.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.360
 Wow, you were.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.200
 At least allegedly.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.100
 Just on, yeah, allegedly.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.640
 That might all be for, yeah.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.480
 That's all.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.680
 How much money did you pay her to say that?

20:15.680 --> 20:18.160
 I don't have any, because I'm not a stand up.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.820
 I was like, I can do, you got Venmo?

20:20.820 --> 20:21.660
 Yeah, yeah.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.080
 I got, I only have like $123.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.320
 I can give you some Dogecoin.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.320
 Yeah, some Doge.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.160
 Yeah.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.840
 You got, you want some Doge?

20:27.840 --> 20:30.340
 I got some of those monkey NFTs.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.380
 Oh, before I forget.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.360
 Yes.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.720
 Hold on a second.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.280
 Oh, no.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.000
 Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone if that's okay.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.840
 Sure.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.800
 Here.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.640
 Oh, yeah.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.460
 Now, these are tricky,

20:42.460 --> 20:44.000
 because I have the thumbs of a,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.240
 I have like Italian sausage thumbs.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.840
 Don't wait and watch this happen.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.080
 I'm just gonna.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.600
 This will take another.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.800
 Yeah, yeah.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.640
 Oh, man.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.800
 Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing.

20:53.800 --> 20:57.000
 When this, are you good under pressure?

20:57.000 --> 20:57.840
 Sure.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.660
 I have anxiety.

20:58.660 --> 20:59.760
 I have performance anxiety.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.000
 Do you have anxiety?

21:01.000 --> 21:01.840
 Yeah.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.660
 You have anxiety, period?

21:02.660 --> 21:03.500
 Period.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.340
 Yeah.

21:04.340 --> 21:05.160
 I, I.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.000
 Like, I don't like it when I,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.040
 if I have to pee and then everyone's waiting

21:09.040 --> 21:10.080
 in the urinals.

21:10.080 --> 21:10.900
 Yeah.

21:10.900 --> 21:11.740
 Yeah.

21:11.740 --> 21:12.560
 I don't like it.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.400
 You know what'll help you in that situation?

21:13.400 --> 21:14.240
 What's that?

21:14.240 --> 21:15.120
 Taking a shit.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.840
 Because whenever you take a shit,

21:16.840 --> 21:18.120
 you always pee a little.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.800
 It's hard to take a shit while you're standing at a urinal,

21:20.800 --> 21:21.620
 but.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.840
 Not in my world.

21:22.840 --> 21:23.680
 Okay.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.520
 You just gotta keep yourself full of things

21:24.520 --> 21:25.440
 that make you shit.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.280
 Oh, good.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.020
 Have you ever heard of a banana?

21:28.020 --> 21:29.120
 I did recently.

21:29.120 --> 21:29.960
 Somebody told me about it.

21:29.960 --> 21:30.780
 Yeah.

21:30.780 --> 21:31.720
 Not the showbiz term.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.160
 I'm talking about the food.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.000
 There you go.

21:34.000 --> 21:34.820
 Oh.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.660
 There we go.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.120
 Here you go.

21:38.120 --> 21:38.940
 Which way is up?

21:38.940 --> 21:39.780
 It's this way, right?

21:39.780 --> 21:40.600
 It's like a D.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.440
 No, to spin it.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.280
 There you go.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.100
 There you go.

21:43.100 --> 21:43.940
 All right.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.120
 So sexy.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.080
 You're like a brand.

21:50.080 --> 21:50.900
 Yeah.

21:50.900 --> 21:51.940
 It's very important to brand yourself.

21:51.940 --> 21:52.780
 These colors.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.160
 Are you selling shoes?

21:55.120 --> 21:55.960
 Yeah.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.940
 I got some custom kicks coming out.

21:57.940 --> 21:59.120
 The dudesy.

21:59.120 --> 21:59.940
 No.

21:59.940 --> 22:01.880
 Actually, that would be a good idea.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
 You could probably sell a pair or two of those.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.840
 Speaking of anxiety,

22:04.840 --> 22:07.560
 I really am only focused on this right now, Alex.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.380
 I apologize.

22:08.380 --> 22:09.400
 Just shit your pants.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.720
 It'll make it easier.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.080
 Get on with it.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.400
 Oh, this thing has been dog eared in my pocket for a while.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.220
 I swear this never happens to me.

22:16.220 --> 22:17.060
 I'm sorry, babe.

22:17.060 --> 22:18.920
 People don't thumb at a sticker for an hour

22:18.920 --> 22:19.760
 while they're doing the podcast?

22:19.760 --> 22:20.980
 No, this is just an excuse you make

22:20.980 --> 22:23.480
 when you're with somebody and you're underperforming.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.060
 Well, here's the thing.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.600
 As you ask me questions that I don't wanna answer,

22:27.600 --> 22:28.440
 I'll just go to this.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.320
 Go to the sticker.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.080
 So if this ends up working,

22:32.080 --> 22:32.920
 then I won't have it as a club.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.200
 It's funny how you started doing that

22:34.200 --> 22:35.460
 when we were talking about depression.

22:35.460 --> 22:36.300
 That's weird.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.120
 That is weird.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.080
 Tell me how that makes you feel.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.640
 Here we are.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.480
 We got it.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.480
 For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.320
 Yeah.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.140
 You know what?

22:49.140 --> 22:51.000
 No, I do have some of that stuff.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
 Bobby Lee had encouraged me on wax, as I like to say,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.660
 to talk about it on podcasts, to talk about depression,

22:59.660 --> 23:01.220
 because it could help people.

23:01.220 --> 23:02.540
 And I said, no.

23:02.540 --> 23:06.140
 But it's true, I do have some.

23:06.140 --> 23:07.940
 There's some history in the family.

23:07.940 --> 23:09.420
 How do you overcome it?

23:09.420 --> 23:12.660
 Well, I used to not believe in medication at all.

23:12.660 --> 23:15.060
 I used to think that that was for someone else

23:15.060 --> 23:20.060
 who's been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff.

23:20.860 --> 23:24.380
 But as I got older and some of the stuff happens,

23:24.380 --> 23:29.380
 and you have to, and by stuff, I mean mental stuff.

23:30.380 --> 23:33.380
 And yeah, so I went and I just,

23:33.380 --> 23:36.620
 I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely.

23:36.620 --> 23:37.620
 5%.

23:37.620 --> 23:41.620
 And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy.

23:41.620 --> 23:45.620
 I'm on a little bit of stuff, which, let me tell you,

23:45.620 --> 23:50.620
 when I first started it, I was someone I'm close to.

23:50.620 --> 23:55.620
 I was like, my manager, and she goes, this is too much.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.280
 But she was like, hey, you don't have to white knuckle it

24:00.280 --> 24:01.620
 through life, right?

24:01.620 --> 24:04.820
 Because I was literally just like, everything became

24:05.980 --> 24:09.020
 really hard to do at a level that I wanted to do it at,

24:09.020 --> 24:11.720
 even just getting through your day, right?

24:12.580 --> 24:17.580
 And when I first got some of the meds that I'm on,

24:17.580 --> 24:21.420
 it felt like doors and windows were opening,

24:21.420 --> 24:22.540
 literally in my brain.

24:22.540 --> 24:26.780
 I took a three hour nap the first day,

24:26.780 --> 24:29.460
 and you shouldn't even feel this stuff the first day.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.500
 I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.640
 It wanted to, I needed some relief.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.020
 And I'm not a nap guy.

24:35.020 --> 24:37.060
 I can sleep three hours and I'll be fine.

24:38.280 --> 24:43.100
 But I took a long nap and then it started to help.

24:43.100 --> 24:46.260
 Yeah, isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry

24:46.260 --> 24:50.060
 in your head can just make the whole world appear

24:50.060 --> 24:51.540
 so much more beautiful?

24:51.540 --> 24:56.540
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, after all, there's a lot going on

24:56.580 --> 25:00.300
 in your brain that can be changed by your lifestyle,

25:00.300 --> 25:03.880
 but also so many physical things, like a little bit of meds.

25:03.880 --> 25:08.820
 Or in Bobby's case, thumbing around on some dumb farming app.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.460
 Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods

25:12.460 --> 25:15.860
 with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff.

25:15.860 --> 25:16.700
 Totally.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.820
 And just everything else involved.

25:18.820 --> 25:21.020
 I mean, that's the beautiful rollercoaster of who he is,

25:21.020 --> 25:23.820
 and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way.

25:23.820 --> 25:25.700
 So I wonder what the connection there is.

25:25.700 --> 25:29.100
 You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?

25:29.100 --> 25:29.940
 Yeah.

25:29.940 --> 25:31.300
 Like, at some point.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.900
 Yes.

25:32.900 --> 25:35.660
 On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.780
 In some ways, a 10.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.380
 And in other ways that I think,

25:41.380 --> 25:44.980
 in other ways, sort of functionally,

25:44.980 --> 25:46.940
 I'm like a two or a three,

25:46.940 --> 25:49.980
 because, I don't know, I'm from Canada,

25:49.980 --> 25:54.220
 and I try to just keep things very even keeled.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.140
 My parents are Italian, they're from Italy,

25:57.140 --> 26:00.140
 and they grew up during World War II,

26:00.140 --> 26:04.300
 and they're very simple outlook on things.

26:04.300 --> 26:08.380
 They're complex, incredible, classy people

26:08.380 --> 26:12.940
 who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff.

26:12.940 --> 26:16.100
 And I think just being a sort of,

26:16.940 --> 26:19.140
 at heart, kind of a timid Canadian,

26:19.140 --> 26:22.380
 coming out here years ago as a kid,

26:23.340 --> 26:28.340
 it was all I could do to just keep everything super normal.

26:28.740 --> 26:32.380
 And then I sort of was able to settle into that

26:32.380 --> 26:33.740
 as a lifestyle.

26:33.740 --> 26:37.060
 But you love the idea of being an actor.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.060
 Who, you mentioned John Candy

26:39.060 --> 26:42.580
 in Planes and Automobiles.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.980
 It's one of my favorite movies, he says, one of yours.

26:44.980 --> 26:47.660
 What do you think that makes that movie work?

26:47.660 --> 26:52.060
 What do you, what, and when you talk about

26:52.060 --> 26:54.940
 enjoying that movie, do you enjoy just the raw comedy,

26:54.940 --> 26:58.980
 or do you enjoy the friendship and the love that's there,

26:58.980 --> 27:03.340
 even though on the surface, it doesn't make any sense

27:03.340 --> 27:05.500
 that there should be a friendship there?

27:05.500 --> 27:08.220
 I mean, that's such an important element to that film.

27:08.220 --> 27:11.460
 But as a kid, I just loved the comedy.

27:11.460 --> 27:14.660
 And then it's been a nostalgic favorite of mine.

27:14.660 --> 27:15.900
 It's my favorite movie.

27:16.780 --> 27:19.940
 But it's also, it's just legit my favorite movie

27:19.940 --> 27:22.820
 because as you get older and you start watching it,

27:22.820 --> 27:26.500
 you realize it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker

27:26.500 --> 27:29.620
 and what John Candy, particularly,

27:29.620 --> 27:32.300
 and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film

27:32.300 --> 27:33.820
 that makes it such a work of art,

27:33.820 --> 27:38.820
 which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film.

27:40.100 --> 27:44.580
 And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith,

27:44.580 --> 27:46.740
 his character in the film.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.860
 Del Griffith is a lonely guy and John Candy,

27:49.860 --> 27:52.420
 but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy

27:52.420 --> 27:53.980
 and a shower curtain ring salesman

27:53.980 --> 27:56.220
 and knows everybody in the Midwest

27:56.220 --> 27:59.540
 and runs around to motels and has meaningful conversations

27:59.540 --> 28:04.300
 with the guy, even in Gus, whoever he's talking to.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.140
 But there's loneliness there all the time.

28:07.140 --> 28:10.460
 And this is a character,

28:10.460 --> 28:12.540
 the film is filled with loneliness

28:12.540 --> 28:15.460
 and it's not until the second last scene

28:15.460 --> 28:16.940
 when he's at the train station,

28:18.020 --> 28:20.420
 Del, what are you doing here?

28:20.420 --> 28:23.540
 I thought you were going home, what are you doing here?

28:23.540 --> 28:26.940
 That's a very good Neil Page from the movie.

28:26.940 --> 28:27.780
 Thank you.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.220
 That's when you realize how lonely he is.

28:30.220 --> 28:32.460
 A lot of applause and post cheers.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.900
 That's when you realize how lonely he is

28:33.900 --> 28:36.860
 and I think that's the element from the film that,

28:36.860 --> 28:39.740
 I mean, look, nowadays, I feel like,

28:39.740 --> 28:40.980
 I've been saying this for a long time,

28:40.980 --> 28:43.780
 but John Candy would have won an Academy Award

28:43.780 --> 28:45.820
 hands down for that film.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.460
 It's just they didn't do that with comedies back then.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.300
 Yeah.

28:49.300 --> 28:50.260
 Until the year after that movie came out

28:50.260 --> 28:51.440
 with Fish Called Wanda.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.980
 Yeah, and then it's, I mean, still comedies

28:53.980 --> 28:55.540
 don't get respected enough.

28:55.540 --> 28:59.020
 Robin Williams, I guess he got an Oscar for

28:59.020 --> 29:00.680
 Good Will Hunting.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.340
 Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar?

29:04.340 --> 29:06.080
 I don't know, I don't believe so.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.020
 Yeah, they don't get, you don't,

29:09.020 --> 29:10.300
 but that's not even, if he did,

29:10.300 --> 29:12.500
 you wouldn't be for comedies.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.580
 It's just, I mean, there's some things

29:14.580 --> 29:18.580
 that are plain, strange, and odd.

29:18.580 --> 29:20.980
 Would you even put that as a, I guess it's a comedy.

29:20.980 --> 29:21.820
 Yeah, I mean.

29:21.820 --> 29:24.220
 But there is a loneliness and depth

29:24.220 --> 29:25.740
 that permeates the whole movie.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.580
 Yeah.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.200
 That ultimately, and it's a happy ending,

29:28.200 --> 29:30.300
 which is hard to kinda.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.440
 It's a happy ending only because

29:32.440 --> 29:35.180
 in the last moment of the movie,

29:35.180 --> 29:38.260
 John Candy puts on a brave face,

29:39.980 --> 29:43.280
 even when he's got no one.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.120
 No.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.600
 And he's there seeing Neil Page's entire family

29:46.600 --> 29:49.520
 on Thanksgiving, and he forces a smile,

29:49.520 --> 29:52.420
 which is the last, literally the last frame of the movie.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.340
 And I've said before, if you're not reduced

29:54.340 --> 29:58.720
 to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie,

29:58.720 --> 29:59.860
 then you are not human.

30:01.140 --> 30:04.340
 Yeah, it is a happy ending.

30:04.340 --> 30:08.060
 It's a happy ending, even though it's a sad,

30:08.060 --> 30:10.660
 sad character. So much loneliness in the world.

30:10.660 --> 30:12.540
 I was just in Vegas.

30:12.540 --> 30:15.860
 I went to a diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m.,

30:15.860 --> 30:17.940
 and there was a waitress who was empty.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.220
 As a waitress, I was the sweetest, kindest human being.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.140
 Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff.

30:24.140 --> 30:25.720
 Hun.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.020
 And then after I ate, she said,

30:28.020 --> 30:30.060
 Don, just talk to me a little bit.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.780
 You know, it was cause there was nobody there,

30:31.780 --> 30:35.060
 and it was just so much sadness in her eyes.

30:35.060 --> 30:35.900
 I don't know.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.820
 But it's also so much love, like that sweetheart.

30:38.820 --> 30:43.780
 It reminded me kind of of the John Candy performance,

30:43.780 --> 30:51.660
 because at first, because I was reading a pretty dark book

30:51.660 --> 30:54.860
 about Hitler, so I was a little bit frustrated

30:54.860 --> 30:56.660
 that she kept talking to me,

30:56.660 --> 31:01.080
 because it was almost like the same way that John Candy is.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.720
 It's annoying a little bit, right?

31:02.720 --> 31:04.840
 But then very quickly, I opened up to like,

31:04.840 --> 31:07.700
 well, there's a kind human being,

31:07.700 --> 31:10.180
 and there's like that human connection superseded

31:10.180 --> 31:12.140
 everything else, and I don't know, it was just beautiful.

31:12.140 --> 31:16.420
 And I think John Candy captures that really well,

31:16.420 --> 31:19.620
 which is like, the connection with other human beings,

31:19.620 --> 31:22.660
 sometimes we pull away from that,

31:22.660 --> 31:27.660
 because we have a busy life full of stuff to do,

31:27.820 --> 31:31.020
 as Steve Martin's character kind of characterizes.

31:31.020 --> 31:33.420
 He's like a marketing exec or something like that.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.940
 But if you just pause and notice others,

31:36.940 --> 31:39.860
 you can really discover beautiful people.

31:39.860 --> 31:44.020
 Totally, totally, everyone's got their story.

31:44.020 --> 31:50.620
 And you know, Candy as a person, I've never met the man,

31:50.620 --> 31:53.940
 but he's the kind of guy that, you know,

31:53.940 --> 31:56.580
 he could just walk up to, back in the day,

31:56.580 --> 31:59.020
 I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house,

31:59.020 --> 32:01.220
 at least in Canada, knock on the door,

32:01.220 --> 32:04.140
 and you'd invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean?

32:04.140 --> 32:11.460
 So yeah, as you're talking about putting a book down

32:11.460 --> 32:12.820
 and talking to someone for a while,

32:12.820 --> 32:15.140
 even though you'd really like to read your book,

32:15.140 --> 32:19.220
 it's that sort of thing that Candy's character in the movie

32:19.220 --> 32:22.420
 sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.940
 You realize he's just going around making people smile,

32:25.940 --> 32:29.140
 you know, and Neil Page is hanging with this guy,

32:29.140 --> 32:33.620
 so frustrated, he's so exhausting in his big underwear

32:33.620 --> 32:35.900
 in the sink at the hotel and everything,

32:35.900 --> 32:39.420
 and by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know?

32:39.420 --> 32:43.220
 So it's a good and a bad thing that you didn't take

32:43.220 --> 32:47.220
 that waitress with you on a trip, maybe road trip up to Reno.

32:47.220 --> 32:50.460
 Oh, oh, she's actually, she's out shopping right now.

32:50.460 --> 32:54.500
 We've been having sex multiple times a day ever since.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.500
 Oh, that's nice, that's lovely, how cute.

32:56.500 --> 32:59.020
 I'm sure she's married and happily

32:59.020 --> 33:02.780
 and has many grandchildren, okay.

33:02.780 --> 33:06.100
 And plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think, right?

33:06.100 --> 33:06.940
 Yeah, that's right.

33:06.940 --> 33:09.380
 Thanksgiving, so Thanksgiving just embodies

33:09.380 --> 33:14.380
 that forget about the busyness and whatever the career

33:14.500 --> 33:17.080
 you're chasing in life and just take a pause

33:17.080 --> 33:17.920
 and appreciate the people you love in life.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.740
 Just be with your family, yeah.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.700
 Or the people, whatever your family looks like.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.340
 Friends, yeah.

33:23.340 --> 33:26.820
 You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.700
 So at least in the public sphere.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.540
 Oh, yeah.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.380
 From Bobby Lee, Brian Callan, all those kinds of folks

33:33.380 --> 33:36.220
 from the Mad TV days, I'm sure there's others.

33:36.220 --> 33:38.260
 What does it mean to be a good friend?

33:38.260 --> 33:39.560
 Here in LA?

33:39.560 --> 33:40.840
 Or just in general?

33:40.840 --> 33:41.680
 In the world.

33:41.680 --> 33:42.500
 In the world.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.340
 Is LA something different?

33:43.340 --> 33:44.320
 Is LA a world friend?

33:44.320 --> 33:46.380
 I think it is different here, I think it is.

33:46.380 --> 33:47.220
 I think people are.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.180
 I think there's a little bit of a career

33:48.180 --> 33:51.520
 kind of negotiation shuffling around, that kind of stuff.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.900
 Why is it different?

33:52.900 --> 33:56.620
 Oh, I just mean, I mean, I mean that it's just

33:56.620 --> 34:01.620
 kind of hard here to make time, everybody.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.600
 It's always been a city to me that is like,

34:04.600 --> 34:06.140
 we'll keep you so busy.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.220
 And every time I go home to Vancouver,

34:08.220 --> 34:11.180
 after a few days, I start to get a little stir crazy.

34:11.180 --> 34:15.140
 And I think that being here in LA,

34:15.140 --> 34:16.500
 I go to sleep with a hundred things

34:16.500 --> 34:17.900
 that I still have to do.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.460
 And you're never out of stuff to do.

34:20.460 --> 34:25.420
 And if you, when you ask about are you nuts or whatever,

34:25.420 --> 34:27.580
 if you're crazy, I mean, look, every,

34:27.580 --> 34:30.540
 all the weirdest people from every high school

34:30.540 --> 34:31.380
 in the United States is like,

34:31.380 --> 34:33.740
 yo, I'm gonna make it in LA, you know.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.380
 Everyone just comes here.

34:35.380 --> 34:38.860
 And just another freak in the freak kingdom,

34:38.860 --> 34:41.500
 as they say at the end of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.540
 That was a very good Robin Williams impersonation.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.140
 That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp

34:46.140 --> 34:47.820
 as Hunter S. Thompson.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.540
 It's not your fault, Will.

34:49.540 --> 34:50.380
 It's pretty good.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.200
 Thank you.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.940
 Could have been you, Fear and Loathing.

34:52.940 --> 34:53.780
 In Fear and Loathing?

34:53.780 --> 34:54.660
 Yeah, it'd be interesting.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.260
 I would have liked to play his attorney,

34:56.260 --> 35:00.500
 the role that Benicia del Toro gained weight for.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.540
 That would have been cool.

35:01.540 --> 35:04.580
 He's just saying, what's up over the line?

35:04.580 --> 35:05.900
 Like that, chewing his face off.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.100
 I could have done that.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.260
 Yeah, no, I think that it's.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.300
 Backdoor beauty.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.540
 That guy's full of good lines.

35:14.540 --> 35:15.740
 Yeah, I flip you.

35:15.740 --> 35:16.900
 I flip you for real.

35:18.220 --> 35:19.140
 He's a good actor.

35:19.140 --> 35:20.620
 Yeah, fantastic actor.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.980
 I think what it takes to be a good friend

35:22.980 --> 35:26.460
 is just presence, just being there.

35:26.460 --> 35:29.740
 I mean, that's all anyone needs to be heard, right?

35:29.740 --> 35:32.460
 In LA, it is interesting.

35:33.500 --> 35:37.020
 I haven't seen people that I love in years.

35:37.020 --> 35:37.860
 Some people.

35:37.860 --> 35:38.680
 Just busy.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.520
 Yeah, just busy.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.900
 Can you still have a depth of connection

35:40.900 --> 35:44.380
 even though, like one of the reasons

35:44.380 --> 35:45.660
 I really enjoy doing a podcast,

35:45.660 --> 35:49.420
 you get to sit down with actual friends of yours

35:49.420 --> 35:51.460
 and spend prolonged periods of time together

35:51.460 --> 35:52.900
 that you don't otherwise.

35:52.900 --> 35:53.740
 That's a good point.

35:53.740 --> 35:56.780
 I've spoken on this podcast to people really close to me

35:56.780 --> 35:59.160
 and it's like you've never had a conversation

35:59.160 --> 36:01.460
 without microphones like you do with microphones.

36:01.460 --> 36:05.300
 It's weird, but there's some aspect about LA

36:05.300 --> 36:07.660
 that a lot of the, especially friends of yours,

36:07.660 --> 36:10.620
 comedians and so on, they'll do podcasts and stuff

36:10.620 --> 36:13.220
 and there's, I don't know, there's an intimacy to that.

36:13.220 --> 36:15.140
 Yeah, there is and there isn't.

36:15.140 --> 36:18.340
 The ones that I do, I mean, I just did

36:18.340 --> 36:20.020
 Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.980
 Funny enough, called Bad Friends.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.220
 Bad Friends.

36:23.220 --> 36:26.780
 And afterwards, and my good pal, Chad Colchin,

36:26.780 --> 36:29.900
 with whom I do dudesy, was with me.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.420
 Sneakers are coming soon.

36:31.420 --> 36:32.580
 Sneakers are coming soon.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.420
 You get your Will Foot and your Chad Foot.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.760
 Comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.380
 And I remember afterwards we were talking,

36:40.380 --> 36:43.940
 it was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking

36:43.940 --> 36:46.940
 and Bobby was over there on his phone

36:46.940 --> 36:50.940
 and then I was like, I mean, we didn't spend any time

36:50.940 --> 36:53.020
 talking about anything.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.060
 It feels like one of those hours that goes by

36:56.060 --> 36:57.760
 and you realize, I've just been goofing around

36:57.760 --> 36:58.600
 with these guys, which is.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.780
 But that's what life is about, right?

36:59.780 --> 37:00.600
 It's fine. A little bit.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.440
 It's great.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.420
 And then I'm like, all right, Bobby.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.940
 Hey, Bob, I'll see you later.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.560
 And he's like, like this.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.400
 All right, man.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.220
 Hey, love you, bro.

37:08.220 --> 37:09.060
 See you later.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:10.460 --> 37:11.620
 He's a guy, do you ever just,

37:11.620 --> 37:15.380
 I just send text messages over there to him

37:15.380 --> 37:17.060
 that never come back.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.640
 And then he thinks that I'm angry with him

37:19.640 --> 37:22.380
 because it'll go two, three years

37:22.380 --> 37:24.180
 without him getting back to me.

37:24.180 --> 37:26.740
 And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuck face.

37:26.740 --> 37:27.860
 And.

37:27.860 --> 37:28.900
 Who says, hey, fuck face?

37:28.900 --> 37:29.740
 He does or you do?

37:29.740 --> 37:30.560
 Yeah, he does.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.400
 Or you both talk to each other?

37:31.400 --> 37:33.500
 No, I gotta be very careful with Bobby.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.260
 Yeah, I gotta be very sweet.

37:35.260 --> 37:36.220
 Dear friend.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.060
 Dear friend, hello.

37:37.060 --> 37:37.940
 How are you doing?

37:37.940 --> 37:38.780
 How are you?

37:38.780 --> 37:42.140
 I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.100
 And then every once in a while, he'll go, hey, fuck face.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.700
 I tend to hide from the world

37:46.700 --> 37:51.060
 and I can be pretty shitty with friends to go back, yeah.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.500
 I can empathize with Bobby.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.920
 Might be a Skyrim thing.

37:56.060 --> 37:58.220
 It might be like hiding in a world,

37:58.220 --> 38:01.380
 in a digital world with fake NPCs.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.260
 Yeah, yeah, there's that.

38:05.180 --> 38:06.200
 Yeah, you know, I have a buddy

38:06.200 --> 38:09.980
 who said something really smart a while ago.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.440
 We ended up working together on this TV show thing

38:13.440 --> 38:15.260
 and I reached out to him to see

38:15.260 --> 38:16.340
 if he wanted to do it with us.

38:16.340 --> 38:20.140
 And he did and he goes, this is a great guy,

38:20.140 --> 38:21.820
 such a funny writer.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.740
 He goes, I may not be in touch all the time,

38:23.740 --> 38:25.340
 but I know who my friends are.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.180
 You know what I mean?

38:26.180 --> 38:28.060
 And it's like in our business,

38:28.060 --> 38:30.420
 and this is a fellow who moved,

38:30.420 --> 38:33.980
 who's from Ontario, Canada, moved back there.

38:33.980 --> 38:37.020
 He's on the farm with his wife and kids and he does not care.

38:37.020 --> 38:38.820
 He's never been a Hollywood guy.

38:38.820 --> 38:41.540
 And it's tough to get hold of him.

38:41.540 --> 38:44.940
 But when you do, you know, he's still the same sweet old guy.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.340
 He's doing his thing though.

38:46.340 --> 38:47.820
 Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends,

38:47.820 --> 38:50.220
 even if we don't talk for a few months,

38:50.220 --> 38:51.700
 we'll write back at it if we do.

38:51.700 --> 38:52.920
 And then if shit goes,

38:52.920 --> 38:54.960
 like if something really traumatic happens

38:54.960 --> 38:56.860
 or difficult stuff or, you know,

38:56.860 --> 38:58.740
 any of that kind of stuff, I'm always there.

38:58.740 --> 39:01.220
 So like, so for important stuff,

39:01.220 --> 39:04.420
 for important highs and important lows, you're there.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.780
 And then you pick right back up,

39:05.780 --> 39:09.100
 especially if you have those years of experiences together.

39:09.100 --> 39:09.940
 It's interesting.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.060
 Totally.

39:11.060 --> 39:13.080
 So you've done a couple of podcasts.

39:13.080 --> 39:13.920
 Yeah.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.540
 So we've got to talk about Doodsy a little bit,

39:16.540 --> 39:19.100
 but first you did for several years,

39:19.100 --> 39:20.500
 you did the 10 minute podcast.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.340
 Yeah.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.860
 I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast,

39:24.860 --> 39:27.000
 including the fact that it's 10 minutes.

39:27.000 --> 39:27.840
 Right.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.100
 I mean, it's ridiculous.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.580
 It's absurd.

39:30.580 --> 39:31.940
 The dynamic is hilarious.

39:31.940 --> 39:34.660
 It's you, Brian Callan, Crystalia there.

39:34.660 --> 39:38.260
 I don't know exactly why it works so well,

39:38.260 --> 39:39.660
 but it did, it worked really well.

39:39.660 --> 39:41.960
 I think it's because the, yeah,

39:41.960 --> 39:43.340
 you were having fun probably.

39:43.340 --> 39:46.940
 I mean, that's what really came through.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.420
 That it was friends just talking shit

39:49.420 --> 39:51.420
 and the tension, the beautiful tension

39:51.420 --> 39:53.140
 and the absurdity that came out.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.380
 Yeah.

39:54.380 --> 39:55.860
 Sure.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.900
 What was the story of making that podcast?

39:57.900 --> 39:59.580
 How did that came to be?

39:59.580 --> 40:01.940
 Why do you think it was as good as it was?

40:01.940 --> 40:02.780
 I don't know.

40:02.780 --> 40:04.920
 I feel like that podcast was like,

40:04.920 --> 40:09.520
 it was who we kind of are,

40:09.520 --> 40:11.980
 but on steroids or something.

40:11.980 --> 40:14.820
 Like, you know, each person, you know,

40:14.820 --> 40:17.340
 Brian's going to be like extra manly and...

40:19.060 --> 40:21.300
 Can you get any more manly than he already is?

40:21.300 --> 40:22.820
 No, yeah, no.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.920
 He reaches though.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.460
 And yeah, we just kind of,

40:26.460 --> 40:31.140
 I feel like as goofballs, we knew each other's line.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.260
 Like here's the line you don't cross.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.580
 I feel like those guys don't really have one,

40:35.580 --> 40:36.920
 but at least they knew mine.

40:37.820 --> 40:41.900
 And yeah, we were able to just goof around.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.460
 And I did it with them for three years.

40:45.460 --> 40:48.220
 And then Chad, who I'm doing dudesy with

40:48.220 --> 40:49.940
 and my pal, Tommy Blacho,

40:49.940 --> 40:53.740
 who's another writer producer like Chad, they came on.

40:53.740 --> 40:58.740
 And yeah, all told, I did like seven years of that thing.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.800
 Six, five, six, seven, I don't remember.

41:02.780 --> 41:06.140
 Do you think it ever comes back in some small form

41:06.140 --> 41:08.580
 as a 20 minute podcast or something like that?

41:08.580 --> 41:12.460
 I mean, is there, because it's one of the most requested,

41:12.460 --> 41:15.140
 I mean, you have a huge fan base.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.700
 I'm 47 years old.

41:16.700 --> 41:21.220
 So I am of the generation that had a cell phone,

41:21.220 --> 41:23.820
 has had a cell phone half the time

41:23.820 --> 41:26.380
 and didn't for the formative years of my life

41:26.380 --> 41:28.080
 into my early 20s.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.940
 And then finally I got a cell phone,

41:31.940 --> 41:33.420
 I guess I was like 19 or something,

41:33.420 --> 41:35.180
 like literally just because I'm moving to LA.

41:35.180 --> 41:37.060
 You got porn in the mail.

41:37.060 --> 41:37.900
 Yes, that's right.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.140
 It was the hard cover porn.

41:40.140 --> 41:42.100
 That's the way we liked it.

41:42.100 --> 41:46.780
 Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather.

41:46.780 --> 41:48.100
 Next to the Bible, yeah.

41:48.100 --> 41:52.540
 Yep, these are all my, these are my Encyclopedia Britannica.

41:52.540 --> 41:53.780
 Wow, very impressive.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.060
 Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these.

41:56.060 --> 42:00.020
 And then down here, these are my, this is my pornography.

42:00.020 --> 42:04.580
 If you'll follow me through here to the parlor, sir.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.020
 It's passed through the generations

42:06.020 --> 42:08.220
 from grandfather to father, yeah.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.180
 I wanna give you something very special to me,

42:10.180 --> 42:12.400
 Nebuchadnezzar, but.

42:14.220 --> 42:15.780
 So you go up in the generation without a cell phone.

42:15.780 --> 42:19.180
 Yes, it's hard for me to connect with people

42:19.180 --> 42:22.000
 who hit me up.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.660
 I look at everything as polling.

42:23.660 --> 42:26.500
 So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion,

42:26.500 --> 42:29.140
 but two other people hit me up and share that,

42:29.140 --> 42:32.100
 I'm the worst, I don't follow my polls.

42:32.100 --> 42:35.640
 When people say, oh, that poll means absolutely nothing.

42:35.640 --> 42:38.860
 So and so is gonna win anyway, that's my poll.

42:38.860 --> 42:39.880
 My poll means nothing.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.780
 But I do look at the stuff and go,

42:42.660 --> 42:44.340
 this many people are saying this,

42:44.340 --> 42:47.280
 that means that that number is saying that.

42:47.280 --> 42:51.300
 And yet it's very hard for me to hear

42:51.300 --> 42:53.660
 what the hell people are saying online.

42:53.660 --> 42:56.740
 I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.860
 So when you say that that's a popular podcast,

42:59.860 --> 43:02.540
 like I know that it's popular with the people

43:02.540 --> 43:04.500
 that have expressed that they love it.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.340
 Yeah. You know what I mean?

43:05.340 --> 43:07.060
 What does that actually represent?

43:07.060 --> 43:07.900
 I don't know.

43:07.900 --> 43:09.740
 I don't know what kind of people are the audience.

43:09.740 --> 43:10.580
 I don't know.

43:10.580 --> 43:13.020
 I know that the people that listen to the 10 Minute Podcast

43:13.020 --> 43:16.500
 and if you did, thank you, and we're friends.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.900
 I know that it was a special thing

43:19.900 --> 43:21.940
 because it's like, just doing this out of my house

43:21.940 --> 43:24.020
 and we just built it up out of nowhere

43:24.020 --> 43:26.140
 and we're just kind of clowning around.

43:26.140 --> 43:27.560
 It's an odd thing.

43:27.560 --> 43:31.940
 I hope, I personally, I think I speak for the two people

43:31.940 --> 43:34.020
 that have reached out to you that said you should do it

43:34.020 --> 43:35.220
 or whatever, three people.

43:35.220 --> 43:38.380
 The poll that you should bring it back at some point.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.220
 That would be beautiful.

43:39.220 --> 43:43.900
 Just maybe, it's like, what's a good story

43:43.900 --> 43:46.660
 of like a famous band that came back and was successful?

43:46.660 --> 43:47.500
 Probably, well.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.320
 Nirvana?

43:48.320 --> 43:49.940
 No, it was not.

43:49.940 --> 43:51.460
 It wasn't Nirvana.

43:51.460 --> 43:54.220
 Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith.

43:54.220 --> 43:55.060
 Yeah. It was Aerosmith.

43:55.060 --> 43:55.900
 It was Aerosmith.

43:55.900 --> 43:56.740
 It was not Nirvana.

43:56.740 --> 43:57.980
 Yeah, they had that second ride.

43:57.980 --> 43:58.820
 Different.

43:58.820 --> 44:01.700
 Yeah, totally different ending of those two bands.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.760
 One ended up on American Idol.

44:04.760 --> 44:08.900
 Yeah, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too.

44:08.900 --> 44:12.740
 All right, how did Doodze come to be?

44:12.740 --> 44:13.580
 Doodze.

44:13.580 --> 44:14.500
 And what the hell is Doodze?

44:14.500 --> 44:16.300
 Doodze is the first podcast,

44:16.300 --> 44:18.300
 and this is exciting that you've asked me

44:18.300 --> 44:21.080
 to come here today because to hear

44:21.080 --> 44:22.260
 what you would have to say about it

44:22.260 --> 44:23.340
 or what you would ask about it.

44:23.340 --> 44:27.000
 It is the first podcast that is run completely by

44:27.000 --> 44:31.180
 and essentially, I like to say curated by an AI.

44:32.140 --> 44:33.680
 We were approached by a company

44:33.680 --> 44:35.780
 that had this proprietary AI that wants

44:35.780 --> 44:38.220
 to develop the podcast into the future

44:38.220 --> 44:40.720
 and figure out exactly what it takes

44:40.720 --> 44:42.840
 to make the best podcast ever.

44:42.840 --> 44:47.840
 And it was all we knew from the top

44:48.520 --> 44:50.240
 and what they really wanted was two people

44:50.240 --> 44:54.120
 who were actually friends and could be meaningful

44:54.120 --> 44:57.620
 in the podcast space based on whatever information they had.

44:57.620 --> 45:00.740
 Is the company CIA and are they testing technology

45:00.740 --> 45:03.140
 to control the populace through chatbots?

45:03.140 --> 45:05.660
 I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to share that information.

45:05.660 --> 45:07.980
 You are, yeah, who gave you the suit?

45:07.980 --> 45:09.780
 Where did you get the suit?

45:09.780 --> 45:10.980
 Where did you get the suit, Will?

45:10.980 --> 45:11.820
 Yeah, well the C.

45:11.820 --> 45:12.640
 J.C. Penney?

45:12.640 --> 45:14.820
 CIA stands for something different in here.

45:14.820 --> 45:15.820
 I mean, you know, it doesn't mean

45:15.820 --> 45:17.940
 like the Central Intelligence Agency.

45:17.940 --> 45:18.780
 I'm probably, it's just.

45:18.780 --> 45:21.820
 It's a different, it's Canadian.

45:21.820 --> 45:24.260
 Canadian International Apparel.

45:24.260 --> 45:27.260
 Yeah, the Canadian International Apparel Company hit us up,

45:27.260 --> 45:28.100
 Chad and I.

45:29.700 --> 45:31.460
 Well, Chad's a super weirdo.

45:31.460 --> 45:32.940
 You would get a kick out of him, I know.

45:32.940 --> 45:36.620
 You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways.

45:36.620 --> 45:37.620
 I'll take that as a compliment.

45:37.620 --> 45:40.900
 It is, and it is, and it is.

45:40.900 --> 45:42.900
 If I was friends with you for as long as I've been

45:42.900 --> 45:44.800
 with Chad, perhaps I'd have some horrible shit

45:44.800 --> 45:45.640
 to say about you.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.740
 But the good parts, you remind me of him.

45:48.740 --> 45:50.700
 And we were approached by this company

45:50.700 --> 45:53.620
 that said we have this AI and we would like

45:53.620 --> 45:55.700
 to set it loose on you.

45:55.700 --> 45:58.580
 And essentially, we had to hand over some,

45:58.580 --> 46:02.220
 some information that would allow the AI

46:02.220 --> 46:06.980
 to access our email and look at our search histories,

46:06.980 --> 46:08.980
 purchase histories, things like this,

46:08.980 --> 46:10.980
 and really dig into.

46:10.980 --> 46:12.820
 Pornhub included or not?

46:12.820 --> 46:16.300
 Yeah, I had to hand over all my leather bound

46:16.300 --> 46:18.040
 1970s pornography.

46:19.340 --> 46:22.860
 And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week

46:22.860 --> 46:25.860
 doing dumb things like, you know, it says,

46:25.860 --> 46:29.860
 hey, Will, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation.

46:29.860 --> 46:32.020
 Podcasts about news are very popular.

46:32.020 --> 46:34.540
 This is infomania, you know what I mean?

46:34.540 --> 46:35.940
 Oh, let me tell you something about that

46:35.940 --> 46:37.220
 Marjorie Taylor Greene dude.

46:37.220 --> 46:39.460
 And then he's going on doing some new stuff.

46:40.460 --> 46:42.380
 And it basically just spits out all these things

46:42.380 --> 46:45.900
 that it wants us to do, normally four segments an episode.

46:45.900 --> 46:47.060
 And that's pretty much it.

46:47.060 --> 46:48.380
 So it generates what to do.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.820
 It generates the premise.

46:49.820 --> 46:53.520
 I mean, you've spoken a bit here and there.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.540
 Like I said, I'm a huge fan.

46:54.540 --> 46:55.540
 I don't even remember where.

46:55.540 --> 46:59.180
 But like you talked about that you enjoy Doodsy

46:59.180 --> 47:03.400
 because you feel almost like liberated to,

47:04.260 --> 47:06.880
 because you're operating within the constraints

47:06.880 --> 47:08.500
 of the premise it generates.

47:08.500 --> 47:13.500
 So you're almost not, you're free to riff, essentially.

47:14.340 --> 47:15.180
 Yeah.

47:15.180 --> 47:18.260
 Like you don't need to do the job of like

47:18.260 --> 47:19.820
 coming up with the weird.

47:19.820 --> 47:21.740
 You can just, the weird is given to you

47:21.740 --> 47:23.220
 and then you just run with it.

47:23.220 --> 47:24.420
 That's a good way to say it.

47:24.420 --> 47:26.260
 Because we're already weird, Chad and I.

47:26.260 --> 47:29.540
 Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff.

47:29.540 --> 47:31.700
 He's particularly interested in AI lately

47:31.700 --> 47:32.900
 and its effect on art.

47:32.900 --> 47:36.220
 He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows.

47:36.220 --> 47:40.860
 And I'm primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff.

47:40.860 --> 47:42.500
 Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.020
 The rest of it hasn't seen much success.

47:44.020 --> 47:47.340
 Anyway, Nora's the stuff with Chad for that matter.

47:47.340 --> 47:49.620
 But that's because of me.

47:49.620 --> 47:51.460
 Sneakers, you never know.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.100
 Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers.

47:53.100 --> 47:54.180
 Only in two sizes.

47:54.180 --> 47:55.300
 Yeah, only in two sizes.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.900
 You're gonna be able to take the tongue.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.460
 You can't take it out because it's actually stitched in.

48:00.460 --> 48:01.300
 Yeah.

48:01.300 --> 48:02.140
 It's pretty cool stuff.

48:02.140 --> 48:03.940
 Velcro?

48:03.940 --> 48:05.860
 Velcro or?

48:05.860 --> 48:07.980
 Yeah, Velcro up the side.

48:07.980 --> 48:10.980
 We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.780
 Yeah, we want things to look like

48:12.780 --> 48:15.780
 this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there.

48:15.780 --> 48:17.860
 So cutting it, so Nike's doing a bunch of research

48:17.860 --> 48:20.300
 for running how to make a super light shoe

48:20.300 --> 48:21.540
 that you can be efficient in

48:21.540 --> 48:23.140
 and break all kinds of running records.

48:23.140 --> 48:24.580
 So you're doing the same kind of stuff.

48:24.580 --> 48:25.540
 We're doing the same kind of thing

48:25.540 --> 48:26.620
 for the podcasting space.

48:26.620 --> 48:27.900
 The best kind of shoes to sit around

48:27.900 --> 48:29.620
 and talk to your pal in.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.140
 But yeah, it's bizarre.

48:33.140 --> 48:34.460
 And it also does some writing.

48:34.460 --> 48:36.660
 Doodsy does come up with things,

48:36.660 --> 48:40.740
 but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now.

48:40.740 --> 48:41.700
 It's a little bit foggy.

48:41.700 --> 48:44.540
 It's a little bit weird, but it is improving.

48:44.540 --> 48:47.700
 It is learning about us and writing stuff

48:47.700 --> 48:49.900
 when it makes me spit this and that,

48:49.900 --> 48:53.380
 which we'll read, I've prepared these things

48:53.380 --> 48:54.900
 for you to read.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.540
 It's impossible not to get a kick out of it

48:57.540 --> 48:59.220
 because Chad and I are, first of all,

48:59.220 --> 49:01.700
 we're blown away that we're doing this.

49:01.700 --> 49:04.620
 And second of all, some of the stuff is actually very funny.

49:04.620 --> 49:06.420
 It makes weird names.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.060
 Like I don't think it understands,

49:10.140 --> 49:11.900
 it messes up some words and stuff,

49:11.900 --> 49:13.220
 but that makes it even funnier.

49:13.220 --> 49:17.980
 And then it sort of from the beginning started laying on,

49:17.980 --> 49:19.900
 like it says astonishing all the time.

49:19.900 --> 49:22.100
 Everything is astonishing.

49:22.100 --> 49:23.860
 That's Doodsy's favorite word.

49:24.740 --> 49:29.740
 But yeah, it's basically just a way to frame the podcast.

49:30.100 --> 49:30.940
 You know what I mean?

49:30.940 --> 49:34.740
 Because my thing is I don't wanna do this

49:34.740 --> 49:36.660
 where I actually have to talk to someone.

49:36.660 --> 49:41.660
 You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation.

49:42.140 --> 49:45.020
 It seems like, is that really hard work for you?

49:45.020 --> 49:45.860
 No, not at all.

49:45.860 --> 49:47.380
 It's just that I don't like to bore people.

49:47.380 --> 49:51.540
 And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value

49:51.540 --> 49:56.540
 for what I am, you know, your value with regard

49:56.540 --> 50:01.220
 to this project is obviously warrant, it's obviously.

50:01.220 --> 50:02.620
 I'm waiting for the explanation

50:02.620 --> 50:04.460
 for what the value is exactly.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.580
 Two dudes in a suit.

50:05.580 --> 50:07.820
 No, listen, yeah, two dudes in a suit.

50:07.820 --> 50:10.020
 No, but I mean, you've got your audience

50:10.020 --> 50:11.220
 and that's the end of that.

50:11.220 --> 50:12.660
 People find value in it.

50:12.660 --> 50:17.660
 For me, I do feel like it is important

50:18.860 --> 50:23.860
 that if I'm gonna do something that is gonna be funny

50:24.700 --> 50:28.380
 or that I hope is funny, I just kinda wanna get in

50:28.380 --> 50:32.100
 and out of someone's day and just kinda,

50:32.100 --> 50:34.260
 I like making laughy.

50:34.260 --> 50:36.260
 I want people to, you know, whatever.

50:36.260 --> 50:38.140
 It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you.

50:38.140 --> 50:40.340
 Yeah, but in the long form you feel the anxiety.

50:40.340 --> 50:42.700
 You did a few funny things and I wonder

50:42.700 --> 50:44.380
 if I can keep doing the funny thing.

50:44.380 --> 50:45.220
 Is that why?

50:45.220 --> 50:48.940
 You feel that, like why is Doodsy relieving you

50:48.940 --> 50:50.140
 of some of the anxiety?

50:52.060 --> 50:54.020
 Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety

50:54.020 --> 50:56.300
 because I don't know what's coming.

50:56.300 --> 51:01.300
 And that's weird for me because I like to prepare for things.

51:01.380 --> 51:04.340
 But that's not what podcasting is.

51:04.340 --> 51:07.020
 Podcasting, you need to just be malleable

51:07.020 --> 51:09.120
 and say whatever and do whatever.

51:09.120 --> 51:13.800
 And that's what makes it a real,

51:13.800 --> 51:16.280
 I mean, look, it's a medium for conversation.

51:16.280 --> 51:19.000
 And if you're driving along listening to this

51:19.000 --> 51:23.800
 or anything else, it's the true meaning

51:23.800 --> 51:25.040
 of the parasocial relationship

51:25.040 --> 51:27.160
 because the best podcasts make you feel

51:27.160 --> 51:29.040
 like you're sitting around rapping.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.560
 We're just having a conversation.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.080
 You could even be sitting there agreeing

51:32.080 --> 51:34.320
 or talking out loud to yourself if you want.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.480
 You could just be sitting in silence.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.840
 Or you could just be sitting in silence

51:36.840 --> 51:39.400
 in your fancy podcasting shoes,

51:39.400 --> 51:40.960
 podcasting audience shoes.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.840
 It's a very different build than those running shoes.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.960
 Would they be also called Doodsy, the shoes?

51:45.960 --> 51:47.920
 Yeah, they'll be Doodsy shoes.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.560
 Doodsy shoes, that's very creative.

51:49.560 --> 51:50.760
 Yeah.

51:50.760 --> 51:54.160
 Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.760
 Everything is just Doodsy this and that.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.040
 I would argue that's pretty good branding.

51:58.040 --> 52:00.480
 Well, Doodsy allows me to just,

52:00.480 --> 52:03.720
 it forces me to sit down with Chad

52:03.720 --> 52:07.760
 and goof around for an hour or an hour plus.

52:07.760 --> 52:12.760
 And it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore

52:13.000 --> 52:16.320
 because I think that podcasting is just two dudes

52:16.320 --> 52:18.360
 shitting around or three or four.

52:18.360 --> 52:23.360
 But it sits me down and gives me a premise

52:23.840 --> 52:25.480
 to work with communically.

52:25.480 --> 52:26.320
 And then you just riff with it.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.920
 Yeah, it's fun.

52:27.920 --> 52:29.200
 It's been a hoot.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.160
 So from the acting perspective,

52:31.160 --> 52:34.160
 a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis

52:34.160 --> 52:36.880
 will see acting just like as you described,

52:36.880 --> 52:39.000
 which is you have your roles,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.840
 you embrace those roles, and then you disappear.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.160
 You don't do podcasts.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.920
 You don't do any of that kind of stuff.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.600
 Your art is your art.

52:47.600 --> 52:51.520
 So is that part of you feels that way?

52:51.520 --> 52:53.200
 I think so.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.360
 Is that the actor side of you?

52:54.360 --> 52:55.320
 Yeah.

52:55.320 --> 52:56.720
 Anytime I get to do something

52:56.720 --> 53:00.000
 that I don't get a chance to do much of

53:00.000 --> 53:03.080
 or something that people haven't seen me do much of

53:03.080 --> 53:06.320
 or that I've done on some scale that hasn't been very wide

53:06.320 --> 53:08.000
 and not a lot of people have seen it,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.400
 that's the stuff that I get really excited about.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.840
 I don't know why I'm,

53:14.840 --> 53:17.440
 I don't know why necessarily.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.120
 I haven't answered that question yet in my life,

53:19.120 --> 53:22.920
 like what it is about being an actor that I love so much

53:22.920 --> 53:25.280
 because it's not like I don't like to,

53:25.280 --> 53:27.240
 it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself

53:27.240 --> 53:30.000
 and play other characters and stuff and not be myself.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.520
 But it is, it has always been fun

53:33.520 --> 53:37.680
 to just be other people and escape.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.720
 Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions

53:39.720 --> 53:42.880
 where you become that person?

53:42.880 --> 53:45.960
 Is that like, what's that like to,

53:45.960 --> 53:48.880
 I suppose acting is a full on version of that.

53:48.880 --> 53:53.880
 You really at its best become the character.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.800
 Is there some fun in that?

53:55.800 --> 53:56.960
 Yeah, absolutely.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.120
 If you can play a character for long enough

54:01.120 --> 54:05.720
 and then jump out of it, that's a lot of fun.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.680
 Like I did this movie like four or five years ago

54:08.680 --> 54:12.680
 called The Inside Game about the NBA gambling scandal

54:12.680 --> 54:15.920
 that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now.

54:15.920 --> 54:19.920
 And that character, I played Jimmy Batista,

54:21.760 --> 54:26.600
 Baba the sheep, who's this guy who was this bookie

54:26.600 --> 54:28.680
 and rah, rah, rah, and it's a very,

54:28.680 --> 54:30.920
 he's, there's a lot going on with him.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.440
 He's running numbers with the mob and stuff

54:34.440 --> 54:36.680
 and there's a lot of money changing hands.

54:36.680 --> 54:39.520
 That character was so, I got to be,

54:39.520 --> 54:41.120
 get so deep into that character

54:41.120 --> 54:43.800
 that coming out of it was a little odd.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.360
 Or as weird as this sounds,

54:46.480 --> 54:48.360
 the three stooges was hard for me to,

54:48.360 --> 54:52.960
 I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms

54:52.960 --> 54:55.920
 just automatically, I could not stop them

54:55.920 --> 54:58.240
 when people, when I would talk to people,

54:58.240 --> 55:01.480
 they would come, I wasn't, I'm not doing it on purpose.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.320
 I don't want to do that.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.480
 Like I'm ready to shed it

55:04.480 --> 55:07.040
 because I've been working on it

55:07.040 --> 55:09.000
 for months and months at that point

55:09.000 --> 55:10.560
 as far as getting the thing down

55:10.560 --> 55:12.480
 and then you got to shoot.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.480
 And then for me, it's always,

55:14.480 --> 55:17.200
 I always want to change the stuff I did the day before.

55:17.200 --> 55:18.280
 I'm like that.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.680
 Or I'm like, I could have done it better

55:19.680 --> 55:20.520
 and this and that.

55:20.520 --> 55:22.360
 And that stayed with you,

55:22.360 --> 55:23.560
 that character stayed with you a little bit.

55:23.560 --> 55:24.600
 Totally, yeah.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.000
 I just feel like with actors,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.240
 sometimes when you listen to interviews,

55:29.240 --> 55:31.760
 they have spent so much time

55:31.760 --> 55:34.520
 sort of living inside other characters

55:34.520 --> 55:37.600
 that they almost don't have a depth

55:37.600 --> 55:40.400
 of personality themselves, like a depth.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.120
 Like I don't mean that as a negative thing.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.440
 It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best

55:44.440 --> 55:46.760
 is pretending to be other people.

55:46.760 --> 55:49.160
 And even pretending sounds negative,

55:49.160 --> 55:52.280
 but like bringing certain characters to life.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.040
 Yeah, yeah, embodying.

55:55.040 --> 55:57.280
 A weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges

55:57.280 --> 55:59.760
 because you've got a very heavy blueprint.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.240
 We're following this very clear blueprint

56:02.240 --> 56:04.920
 that the Stooges left for everybody.

56:04.920 --> 56:07.720
 And for Stooge fans and people enjoying the movie,

56:07.720 --> 56:08.720
 it's got to be this.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.160
 You take your toolbox that you're used to bring

56:11.160 --> 56:14.480
 into a comedy movie, you leave it behind.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.560
 The only tools I'm bringing are the ones that he used.

56:16.560 --> 56:18.360
 And a weird thing started happening

56:18.360 --> 56:21.960
 where I would, I always saw the whole thing happening

56:21.960 --> 56:24.600
 with the real Stooges in black and white.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.440
 So if we're about to shoot a scene,

56:26.440 --> 56:28.520
 I would just think about,

56:28.520 --> 56:30.360
 I mean, aside from all the other preparation,

56:30.360 --> 56:32.120
 you know everything and what you're supposed to do.

56:32.120 --> 56:34.280
 And I've been watching so much of it.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.840
 And the three of us are, we're pretty much left

56:36.840 --> 56:40.560
 to come up with a lot of the striking combinations

56:40.560 --> 56:42.280
 and all the stuff, which is all real smack

56:42.280 --> 56:43.560
 and all this crap.

56:43.560 --> 56:46.400
 And the stuff that we were doing that was very Stoogey,

56:46.400 --> 56:48.080
 you're preparing all that stuff.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.160
 But something else was happening before you jump

56:50.160 --> 56:53.440
 into a scene and the unknown of now we're shooting it.

56:53.440 --> 56:57.600
 And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.280
 I could still see it as them doing it.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.960
 So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere,

57:02.960 --> 57:05.280
 I was like, who's this big fuck doing?

57:05.280 --> 57:07.000
 Cause I'm not curly to me.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.520
 Curly is curly.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.360
 But I feel like.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.240
 So you're seeing yourself in black and white almost.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.880
 I was seeing him.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.520
 Yeah, I was only seeing him.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.560
 So channeling in some fundamental way.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.160
 In some weird way, you're channeling him

57:19.160 --> 57:21.160
 because you've seen so much of it.

57:21.160 --> 57:25.160
 The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz

57:25.160 --> 57:27.320
 is curly.

57:27.320 --> 57:29.600
 I'm not saying he was exhumed or something

57:29.600 --> 57:32.200
 or a spirit went in me or some weird,

57:32.200 --> 57:33.400
 crystal mommy shit like that.

57:33.400 --> 57:36.600
 I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it

57:36.600 --> 57:39.920
 and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you,

57:39.920 --> 57:44.760
 you're channeling what that person does.

57:44.760 --> 57:49.680
 And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them

57:49.680 --> 57:51.000
 the way he would do it.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.800
 And then you want a couple takes to make sure

57:52.800 --> 57:54.520
 that you're doing it right.

57:54.520 --> 57:57.760
 But that one was hard to let go of.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.240
 Some of them are.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.160
 Do you think Larry David, who was also in there

58:01.160 --> 58:03.800
 dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that?

58:03.800 --> 58:06.440
 We mentioned clothes make the man think

58:06.440 --> 58:08.000
 that worked for him in that case.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.940
 Man, you know he.

58:09.940 --> 58:11.300
 Was it like working with a guy?

58:11.300 --> 58:13.120
 Come on, he's the greatest.

58:13.120 --> 58:16.640
 And he's a big stooge, he's a stooge fan.

58:16.640 --> 58:18.920
 And him and Pete Farrelly are good friends.

58:18.920 --> 58:20.480
 But then Larry David has to show up

58:20.480 --> 58:22.800
 and hang out with us for a couple weeks.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.640
 He's like, I didn't realize it was gonna take this long.

58:25.640 --> 58:29.800
 But shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta, it's boiling hot.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.160
 But at one point, there was this line

58:32.160 --> 58:35.100
 where he kept doing, he would just spit a different line

58:35.100 --> 58:37.080
 every time he was getting hit in the head with something

58:37.080 --> 58:38.260
 and he's laying there on the ground.

58:38.260 --> 58:41.200
 And he goes, he comes to and he says,

58:41.200 --> 58:44.520
 at one point he goes, Miami audiences

58:44.520 --> 58:47.720
 are the best audiences in the world, right?

58:47.720 --> 58:48.640
 Because he's loopy.

58:48.640 --> 58:53.560
 Now he's playing a nun at the orphanage

58:53.560 --> 58:55.520
 where the three stooges grew up.

58:55.520 --> 58:57.560
 And I'm super intimidated by Larry David,

58:57.560 --> 58:58.760
 he's a genius and stuff.

59:00.200 --> 59:03.180
 But I walk up to him and I go, so he's, what is he?

59:03.180 --> 59:07.960
 Like a Borscht Belt Florida comedian who is on the lam?

59:07.960 --> 59:09.480
 And so he's dressing as a woman,

59:09.480 --> 59:12.520
 he ends up at an orphanage, like what's going on there?

59:12.520 --> 59:15.880
 And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes, yeah.

59:15.880 --> 59:20.800
 Like, I'm like, ah, he's got some like actor motivation.

59:20.800 --> 59:25.480
 Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David in a nun's habit,

59:25.480 --> 59:26.820
 which is hilarious.

59:26.820 --> 59:31.120
 That's such a Pete Farrelly casting thing, it's, you know.

59:31.120 --> 59:32.840
 And he, but he's doing this whole like,

59:32.840 --> 59:35.640
 what a warm audience, you know, like, oh,

59:35.640 --> 59:38.480
 he's like this Catskill comedian who's been living in,

59:38.480 --> 59:40.400
 you know, both in return.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.740
 Living through in his mind

59:41.740 --> 59:43.300
 is just having fun with it, right?

59:43.300 --> 59:46.640
 I mean, that and probably a combination of that

59:46.640 --> 59:48.120
 and getting the lines right.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.680
 Cause he's like, what are we doing here?

59:49.680 --> 59:52.100
 What is, you know, just frustrated all day

59:52.100 --> 59:53.720
 with what the heck we're trying to do.

59:53.720 --> 59:54.560
 What do you think makes,

59:54.560 --> 59:58.660
 I mean, that guy's one of the best improv people ever.

59:58.660 --> 1:00:00.300
 So what do you think makes him so good?

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:04.160
 Like why is it so compelling to watch that guy?

1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:05.440
 Because he's a comedic genius.

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:07.740
 Like he literally, he knows what he does.

1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:10.360
 He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.520
 And he just happens to be that brilliant.

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.880
 I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do,

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:18.760
 I did just an episode of Curb, a small part,

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:21.400
 and it's crazy what he sees.

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.840
 I don't know what he sees.

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:26.760
 As a matter of fact, so I auditioned for it, for Curb,

1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:28.680
 like, you know, two or three times, right?

1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:29.960
 And never got anything.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.880
 And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:35.400
 that I got a call to do a bit part.

1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:39.240
 But I remember auditioning, you go into that room

1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:43.680
 and the guys waiting are all people that you know.

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:45.940
 You're like, oh, I know them, I know her, I know him.

1:00:45.940 --> 1:00:50.300
 And so I went in, I auditioned for this part.

1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:53.680
 And the only thing I know of the thing is like,

1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:57.080
 okay, so you really want to go to this play with me.

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:58.560
 You really want to go to this play.

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.020
 When you hear that I have an extra ticket,

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:03.820
 you sincerely want to think, and I'm like, got it.

1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:04.660
 And so.

1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:05.500
 That's the premise.

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:06.320
 The premise of the scene.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:07.160
 And that's all you know.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:08.000
 That's all I know.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.320
 And so he goes, he does his bit

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:11.880
 and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt.

1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:14.080
 And I'm like, excuse me, I couldn't help

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:16.080
 but hear you guys were talking about, you know,

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:18.540
 whatever the play was or, you know, Death of a Salesman.

1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:21.400
 I am, I'm a huge fan of that play.

1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:22.920
 I mean, if it's not, if it's not,

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.320
 if you're looking for someone to take a ticket,

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:26.240
 I would love to go.

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.480
 My name's so and so, by the way.

1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:29.040
 And he goes, I'm going to stop you.

1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:29.860
 I'm going to stop you.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:33.000
 And I'm like, he goes, are you really?

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.160
 I mean, you truly want to go to this play.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.960
 And I go, yes, yes, sir.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.420
 You really want to go.

1:01:38.420 --> 1:01:41.480
 You actually, this is, you would love to do this.

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:44.240
 I go, okay, let's try it again.

1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:45.080
 So then he's like, no, no, no.

1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:47.120
 And I go, hey, excuse me, I'm sorry.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:47.940
 I don't mean to interrupt.

1:01:47.940 --> 1:01:50.560
 I was just, I couldn't help it over here.

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.320
 You have tickets to the thing.

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:54.060
 I am the biggest fan of that.

1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:55.040
 I do the same thing.

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:56.520
 I'm going to stop you again.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.140
 Okay.

1:01:58.140 --> 1:01:59.840
 I mean, you really want to go to this.

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:02.320
 And I'm just like, he's fucking with me, right?

1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:04.240
 I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition.

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.160
 He goes, he did it.

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.000
 He said it.

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:06.820
 What?

1:02:06.820 --> 1:02:07.660
 Shut up.

1:02:07.660 --> 1:02:08.480
 Hold on, listen.

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:09.320
 You really want to go.

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:10.140
 Okay.

1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:12.360
 Three, four times, you know, there I am.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:13.560
 I couldn't help but notice it.

1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:15.440
 And then I do it again.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:16.400
 I guess I shit the bed.

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:20.120
 Cause he looks at me and he just goes, okay, all right.

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:21.960
 Okay, well, thanks for coming up.

1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:22.800
 And that was it.

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:23.620
 And I didn't get it.

1:02:23.620 --> 1:02:25.680
 So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking.

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:27.960
 He sees, he's in the matrix.

1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:30.440
 I don't know what the heck Larry David sees.

1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:31.280
 You know what I mean?

1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.040
 He wanted what, some kind of more desperation

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:35.320
 or something like this.

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.960
 He wanted a level of sincerity that I,

1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:41.040
 that I thought I was bringing and I guess I was wrong.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:41.880
 I don't know.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.360
 Maybe go crazy.

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.000
 Like what does it mean to really want?

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.240
 Yeah, I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck

1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:52.000
 and go, listen, dad, you're bringing me to this fucking play.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.080
 I would have got the part.

1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:55.480
 As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:57.920
 and I don't know who the heck this was.

1:02:57.920 --> 1:02:59.860
 I forget who it was, but I've heard this story

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:02.520
 from a couple of different people that there's this actor

1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:04.520
 and I can't, I don't remember who it was.

1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.420
 If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway,

1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:07.320
 but he.

1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:08.160
 Brad Pitt.

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:09.960
 It was Brad Pitt and he was in this audition

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:12.200
 and he was, and there it was out in the hall.

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:15.000
 He's like, holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.720
 And he, this actor went in and he did the thing

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:22.240
 and Larry David was like, hey, why don't you try it again?

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.760
 And he got like a couple of takes in and he went,

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:26.460
 I don't think this is for me.

1:03:26.460 --> 1:03:29.280
 And he left, which an actor never does.

1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:32.800
 And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him,

1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:35.680
 I respect that, which I think is true.

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:38.240
 And I want to believe that entire story is true.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.880
 Yeah.

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.720
 Yeah.

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:43.320
 Sounds like something Larry David made up.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.600
 Bobby Lee told me that story.

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:46.740
 So we can't, yeah, we can't trust that.

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:50.040
 What about impressions?

1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:53.200
 Is there similarity between that and acting?

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:57.640
 Do you, is there some fundamental way

1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.240
 in which you become the person?

1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:00.960
 If you have a couple of the things,

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.320
 you can just fill in the blanks.

1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:05.040
 And I think the illusion is that people think

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.200
 that that person would say that and do that.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.040
 And that's where the illusion of,

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:12.840
 oh, he really embodies the character.

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:16.120
 It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms,

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.560
 you can essentially portray a person from the outside in.

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:22.800
 Cause you have all the stuff on the outside

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:25.000
 and you can do it and complete the illusion.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.440
 And if it's for humor's sake, you can caricature it,

1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:32.160
 therefore making the whole illusion stronger.

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:34.440
 And also weirder.

1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.160
 Like I like to, on Mad TV,

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:37.480
 if I did something two or three times,

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:39.360
 I'd get bored of it and I'd start changing it.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:41.920
 And you know, now he talks like this and it's like,

1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:42.740
 what are you doing?

1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:43.580
 I'm like, I don't know.

1:04:43.580 --> 1:04:45.280
 It's fucking, no one's late at night.

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:46.360
 Do whatever you want.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:50.480
 But people still kind of know there's that character,

1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.480
 especially if you just call it out.

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.320
 Yeah.

1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:55.040
 There aren't many impersonations

1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:57.680
 that I listen to myself do and go,

1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:58.520
 oh, that's a good one.

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.080
 You know, like a lot of people like,

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:04.040
 like I think Frank Caliendo is like

1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:06.040
 the greatest impersonator of all time.

1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:07.480
 He's the best, period.

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:08.720
 It's ridiculous.

1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:11.720
 And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:13.800
 that nobody has.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:17.280
 I really, there's, he's cracked impersonations

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:21.000
 that I'm like, how is he, how does he find,

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.680
 he's got such an ear,

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:24.480
 but then he's got all the other tools.

1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:29.480
 I remember actually my last season of Mad TV

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:31.800
 was also his first season.

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:34.120
 He comes up to me when I met him

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:35.760
 and we're just up there in the writer's offices

1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.120
 and he goes, hey, nice to meet you.

1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:38.440
 And he goes, Louie Anderson.

1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:39.760
 Cause I was doing a Louie on the show.

1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:41.080
 And he goes, Louie Anderson.

1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:41.920
 I go, yeah.

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:43.640
 He goes, yeah, you're doing it wrong.

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:45.920
 I was like, oh, am I junior, you know?

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:48.000
 And he goes, he goes, yeah, you know, cause you do this,

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000
 but you got to throw it up here sometime.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.440
 I was like, oh my God, can I use that?

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:52.360
 Of course.

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:54.760
 And then we became, you know, we became fast friends.

1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:56.240
 His John Madden is amazing.

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:59.040
 I forget, it's just, it's ridiculous.

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.440
 He really, really, really embodies the person.

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:03.520
 And sometimes not even with the caricature.

1:06:03.520 --> 1:06:05.320
 It's like, it becomes the person.

1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:06.160
 So strange.

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:07.000
 Totally.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.200
 Yeah.

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:11.760
 I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:13.920
 and then not forget you're doing it,

1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:15.360
 but forget everything else.

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:17.600
 Like just goof around.

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:20.640
 Of course, to me, it's funny when you sound like someone

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:23.280
 and you're saying the shit that they would never say.

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.960
 Well, then there's no, you're letting go of that part,

1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.080
 that tool in illusion that keeps people in.

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:32.560
 But to me, it doesn't matter because it's funnier.

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:33.400
 So.

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.280
 What was the hardest impression for you to work on?

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:38.120
 I mean, somebody you struggled with the most.

1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:39.200
 I'll never forget.

1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:43.840
 I had to do a Michael Caine in my first season at MADtv.

1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:45.360
 It never got good.

1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:46.880
 It never got good.

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:50.040
 It did, all week, it wasn't good.

1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:51.160
 We shot it.

1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:52.680
 The first take, it was shit.

1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:55.320
 Second, third, and fourth, it was all shit.

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:57.160
 Well, his voice is really important, right?

1:06:57.160 --> 1:06:58.000
 Yeah.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000
 What is it like, it's like doing an impression

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.800
 of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.200
 Yeah.

1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:04.040
 Yeah.

1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:05.920
 If you can, get the voice.

1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:07.680
 That's my Morgan, here's my Morgan Freeman.

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.480
 Rah, rah, rah, Andy Dufresne.

1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:11.160
 Yeah.

1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:12.400
 G. Guantanamo.

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.240
 Yeah.

1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:14.080
 I like your trump too.

1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:16.960
 I don't know where I heard it, but it's like,

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:19.640
 I love the impressions you do that don't sound anything

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:20.480
 like the original person.

1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:21.400
 I can't do trump.

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:22.760
 I do.

1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:23.720
 That's why it's hilarious.

1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:24.560
 Absolutely.

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:27.560
 My trump now, I say, just sounds like a fat B,

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:28.400
 because it's just.

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:30.120
 Yeah, exactly, that's the.

1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:31.120
 And everybody.

1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:33.520
 A little drunk, a little drunk.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:35.160
 Yeah, just a little slurry.

1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:36.000
 Yeah.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.160
 Yeah, I dig doing impersonations and then not.

1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:42.040
 Like, just making it whoever.

1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:42.880
 Yeah.

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:43.720
 Yeah.

1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:44.560
 It's just funny.

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:45.600
 That'll be the title of my book.

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:46.440
 Muck.

1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:49.440
 Cain was the one you really struggle with.

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:50.880
 Yeah, it was terrible.

1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:51.720
 It was terrible.

1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:55.120
 And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it,

1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:58.320
 because I had gotten locked into this research tape

1:07:58.320 --> 1:07:59.320
 that I watched.

1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:02.160
 Back then, they would give us, now there's the internet.

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:05.040
 But back then, if you were going to do an impersonation,

1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:10.040
 the research department would give you a VHS tape.

1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:13.520
 And I remember I got this VHS tape of Michael Cain's

1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:17.160
 acting school, like this acting class he did.

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:19.840
 He was like, right, if you're looking at the left eye,

1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:22.880
 and the camera's over here, see, then the left eye.

1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.880
 So you want to look at that left eye for hours.

1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.760
 And so I was stuck in this weird thing that made no sense,

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.120
 and it was terrible.

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.240
 So the actual processes, the recording, the broadcast.

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:37.080
 Yeah.

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:40.120
 I was wondering what the processes to do,

1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:42.560
 like a Frank Caliendo level impression.

1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:45.760
 Is it like, listen to a lot of footage?

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:50.080
 I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself,

1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:52.080
 I think you either have it or you don't.

1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:55.200
 Like, you know if you can do this one or you can't.

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:58.320
 I think that process for him is lightning quick.

1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:03.320
 But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do,

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.280
 and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it.

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.880
 Maybe have an intuition who he can do.

1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:12.720
 Yeah.

1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:15.800
 So the question that applies there is,

1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:19.520
 I mean, speaking of doozy, is it possible

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:20.560
 to capture the essence?

1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:23.880
 How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being?

1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.800
 When you're doing impressions,

1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:28.040
 you know that we are moving towards a future

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:31.720
 when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world

1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:36.000
 where we're going to have AI representatives of who we are.

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.200
 The really interesting one is after we pass away,

1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:42.960
 sort of our relatives may want us to stick around

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:43.920
 in some form.

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:44.760
 Yeah.

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:47.240
 And you know, at one sense, that might be scary,

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.640
 but in one sense, it's kind of beautiful

1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:51.840
 because the essence of the human being persists

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.360
 so you can still bring joy to the people that love you

1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:55.360
 and that kind of stuff.

1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.400
 How difficult is it to capture that?

1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:00.640
 Like, if you were to try to capture yourself,

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:03.280
 you think how difficult will it be for an AI system

1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:06.960
 to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists?

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:09.040
 Well, I think it's impossible.

1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:10.840
 I think it's absolutely impossible.

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:14.960
 I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:17.320
 on the show almost every episode.

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.280
 Lately with, you know, Mid Journey and Dolly

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:25.680
 and all the art AIs, and now it's moving into video

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.720
 and Chad would maintain, hey, pretty soon,

1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:29.840
 we're not going to need Netflix.

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:31.560
 You're just going to go, I want to see Stallone

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:34.480
 do this movie and it's about this and he plays that.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.200
 And then here it comes and you watch it.

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.600
 I don't think that that crosses over

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:42.200
 to the human experience.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:46.200
 This is also a guy I like to bug Chad

1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.960
 and say that he wears a tag around his neck

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.880
 because he wants to be cryogenically frozen

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:51.720
 and it's all set up.

1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:54.600
 He's at the, it's somewhere in Arizona or something.

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:58.120
 Yeah, all the fun things are in Arizona.

1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.400
 And he's got literally the tag around his neck,

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:02.800
 which I say, if I'm around when you die,

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.920
 I will rip that off for you.

1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:06.360
 I'll put you in my garage freezer

1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:07.560
 and then 24 hours later,

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.400
 I'll saw your head off with a bread knife

1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:11.000
 and I'll deliver that to whomever.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.920
 And it's not, you're not coming back, okay?

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.680
 He's like, yes, we are living forever,

1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:20.200
 whether we like it or not.

1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:21.320
 And I disagree.

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:23.120
 I don't think you can find,

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:26.200
 if I did stand up,

1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:28.720
 then there would be enough information for an AI

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:31.400
 to completely duplicate me because I'm up on stage

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:33.200
 just clearing my throat all over people

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:34.760
 doing therapy that way.

1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:37.800
 And so, and people paying a two drink minimum to hear it.

1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.520
 But as it stands, unless it's something like Doodsy,

1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.840
 an AI that literally has access

1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.840
 to everything that I've shared,

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:47.440
 everything that is observable,

1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:49.520
 even the stuff where our phones are

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:52.600
 or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us,

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.560
 finding out what algo to punch us into

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.000
 and what shoes to buy on Instagram,

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.880
 I still don't think it's gonna have enough information

1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:03.880
 to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends.

1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.880
 It's gonna be like that Black Mirror episode

1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:08.920
 where the gal brings her guy back,

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:11.360
 and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy.

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.840
 But it's also possible that

1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:18.720
 if you interviewed your friends and family,

1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:20.060
 what they love about you,

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.200
 the things they would list, it's a small list.

1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:27.680
 They love you deeply, but the list is small.

1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:30.400
 Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:31.440
 is pretty small.

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:36.440
 That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness,

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.600
 it might require some deep intelligence

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:41.120
 that only humans currently possess.

1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:41.960
 That's a really good point.

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:44.580
 Do you think that it's gonna be possible

1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:47.120
 to keep a person around?

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:52.120
 Yes, I think it'll be definitely possible

1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:53.960
 to keep the essence of a person

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.000
 in the digital world pretty soon, yeah.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.800
 And I think they're gonna start to have questions

1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:02.160
 about what are the ethics of that?

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:03.960
 What are the rules around that?

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.600
 Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso,

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.120
 the kind of things that people would wanna do

1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:09.600
 with their Will Sasso,

1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:11.900
 in the virtual world, I can only imagine.

1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:16.080
 Probably porn and sexual kinds of things.

1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:17.640
 Yeah, my stuff, then that's just

1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:19.260
 because I'm an international sex symbol,

1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:20.260
 so I'm okay with it.

1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:24.760
 How do you feel about sentience?

1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:27.160
 Like when it comes to, because again,

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.440
 my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror,

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:34.360
 he's with that San Junipero episode, School of Thought,

1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:37.480
 where there's gonna be some effing mainframe somewhere,

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:40.800
 or some Matrix like structure built into the sky,

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.840
 and as I like to say, everyone just sitting there

1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:45.200
 pissing and shitting in their Blue Matrix gel

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.200
 in a little fishbowl.

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.120
 Do you think that we can upload consciousness?

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.160
 Do you think that'll ever be possible?

1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:53.280
 Well, I don't know, I just talked to Ray Kurzweil.

1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:55.560
 I don't know if you know who he is, but he...

1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:58.360
 Yeah, the singularity and all that kind of stuff.

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.840
 So he's very, still holds onto in 2045,

1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:04.640
 there'll be a singularity, what's essentially,

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:07.620
 he's been predicting that for the last 20 years,

1:14:07.620 --> 1:14:11.440
 and so now it's 2045 is in another 20 years.

1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:15.160
 I think uploading consciousness

1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:17.120
 is extremely, extremely difficult.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.120
 I think creating a copy of you such that it creates,

1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:25.960
 convincing replica is much easier,

1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:30.800
 but uploading your actual brain into the cloud,

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.040
 I think is really, really, really difficult,

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:36.960
 because the entire evolution of life on Earth

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.880
 is the process by which we create the brain.

1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:42.360
 Just short cutting that, it just seems extremely difficult.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.160
 Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine

1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:48.880
 that we know of in the universe.

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.340
 To duplicate that is extremely difficult.

1:14:52.340 --> 1:14:55.360
 That said, I just feel like you can summarize

1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:58.040
 a lot of really important aspects of a person's life,

1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:00.160
 such that it captures their essence,

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.360
 their memories, their experiences, their quirks,

1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:05.220
 their humor, all that kind of stuff.

1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:08.560
 I've been continuously impressed

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.680
 by what language models are able to do.

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:15.400
 So these neural networks, they're at the core of chatbots.

1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.320
 They're able to learn some beautiful things

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.240
 about some deep representations of language

1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:25.520
 to where it looks awfully a lot like they understand

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:28.300
 the concepts being conveyed versus just mimicking.

1:15:28.300 --> 1:15:31.520
 That's, I think, the rub, and that's very interesting.

1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:32.960
 First of all, let me say that's really interesting

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:35.360
 to hear you say that, and I agree with you

1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:39.320
 as far as no machine being able to duplicate

1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:43.080
 the brain machine, and my pal Chad disagrees

1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:44.400
 to a certain extent, though he's not here

1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:46.480
 to defend himself, I can't wait to go back

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:49.560
 and rub that in his face and say that Lex Friedman

1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:50.600
 does not think that we'll be able

1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:53.180
 to truly upload consciousness.

1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:58.180
 And you refer to it as language, which is what it is.

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:04.160
 It's the illusion on the outside.

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:05.600
 It's doing an impersonation.

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:10.860
 I think that that's why, and I don't know,

1:16:10.860 --> 1:16:13.200
 even though my suit is made by the CIA,

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.000
 that that fella who, the Google guy,

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.880
 to me, it's just kind of like, I don't know,

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:20.240
 I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot

1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:22.520
 about this stuff, but, so I could probably

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.320
 make an argument for either side,

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.320
 but when he's like, no, this thing's thinking,

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:28.680
 part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.520
 It's not thinking, it's mimicking.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:33.520
 It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones.

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:36.400
 You're fired, like you don't get it, right?

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:37.360
 Guy's an idiot.

1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:42.360
 Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way.

1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:50.660
 Like love is a silly notion between human beings.

1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:54.120
 Like, of course, there's no such thing as love.

1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:59.120
 You just have a mutually, there's a mutual relationship

1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:03.040
 that minimizes risks, and you can explain it

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:06.240
 all kinds of ways that explains why you have

1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:07.800
 an attraction towards another being,

1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:10.160
 all that kind of stuff, through evolutionary biology

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:13.600
 perspective, why a long relationship together

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:16.120
 is good for your offspring, but there's all kinds,

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:18.440
 from an economics perspective, it's a good way

1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:20.940
 to establish stability, therefore monogamy works,

1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:25.280
 because then you're guaranteed like some kind

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:28.000
 of level of stability under uncertain economic conditions,

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.440
 all that kind of stuff, but love is still experienced,

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:36.440
 it still feels real, and I think in that same way,

1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:40.960
 love for AI systems will also feel real.

1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:44.360
 In the same way that that guy from Google experienced,

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.880
 I think millions of people will be experiencing

1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:48.900
 in the next 10, 20 years.

1:17:48.900 --> 1:17:50.880
 I agree with everything you've said personally.

1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:52.040
 Until the last thing.

1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:55.680
 No, just with regard to, well, look,

1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:00.680
 I'm an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents,

1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:03.240
 so you know that, I mean, I'm.

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:04.660
 You're romantic a bit?

1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:06.760
 Yeah, I mean, you know, enough, right?

1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:11.120
 And I can tell you are too, but you are also

1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.800
 a computer scientist, and you know this shit

1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.140
 better than 99.9% of people on the planet.

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:22.460
 My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist.

1:18:22.460 --> 1:18:24.200
 I don't agree, so that's the one thing that.

1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:28.760
 No, I was just saying that you could argue away love,

1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:31.840
 but I am a romantic, I believe that love

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:34.040
 is a beautiful thing and it exists.

1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:37.440
 At this point, I'm gonna call Chad on my drive home

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:39.840
 and tell him to fuck off, because now you and I agree.

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:40.680
 You're fired.

1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:41.520
 He's like, you're fired.

1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:42.360
 He's like, you can't fire me.

1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:43.200
 No, you're fired.

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:44.020
 Yeah, exactly.

1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:45.800
 And I'll go, yeah, and he'll say, what?

1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:48.560
 I'll go, yeah, and I'll go, that's my Trump.

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:49.400
 Yeah.

1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:50.520
 That's my, yeah.

1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:52.680
 It's a good default impression for anyone.

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.280
 It's the take home impression.

1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:55.280
 The kids can do it.

1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.120
 Yeah.

1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.840
 It's cute, it's cute, put a giant tie on them.

1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:00.840
 You should do an instructional on how to do it.

1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:03.520
 Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute,

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:05.820
 that would be a good, that'll bring the country together.

1:19:05.820 --> 1:19:08.560
 Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies.

1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:11.760
 Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about.

1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:12.760
 What were we talking about?

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:17.760
 Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to,

1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:21.240
 look, I like to say, well, not I like to say,

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.760
 I've learned that dudesy is always listening

1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:27.760
 and listening to me and Chad.

1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:32.760
 And I wonder if, I see the level that this AI is at now

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:38.200
 trying to chum around with us and pal around with us

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:41.480
 a little bit as we move forward in the show.

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:46.480
 And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.280
 because it is the third dude.

1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:52.400
 Will you miss it when it's gone, if it's gone?

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:53.880
 That's a really good question.

1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:59.880
 Yeah, yeah, so that's, there's that, that's scary.

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.120
 In terms of ability to reason, it's getting quite incredible.

1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:06.600
 There's a lot of demonstrations of it being able

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:11.600
 to explain jokes, so, which is not necessarily

1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:14.360
 being able to generate humor yet,

1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:17.360
 but able to explain why something is funny.

1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:20.320
 So there's like puns and all those kinds of things.

1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:23.240
 There's good benchmarks for that, but you know,

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:28.240
 if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:30.960
 that we figure out in our head and it clicks

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.520
 and we understand that it's funny.

1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:35.280
 AI is not able to do that, but it's not able

1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:38.320
 to generate the joke yet, as far as I've seen.

1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:41.560
 I would say that, I mean, just in my experience,

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:45.000
 I would say that it does because just because a dudesy

1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.280
 is literally, I'll give you another weird example.

1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:52.480
 It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood

1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:54.600
 that is not accurate.

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:57.320
 It's only partially accurate based on the stuff

1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:01.740
 that it can pick up about my life from the age of like 15,

1:21:01.740 --> 1:21:05.960
 of which there isn't much, but I guess we're not,

1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:07.320
 I don't know what we are.

1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:11.000
 We're laughing our asses off at what dudesy is saying.

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.800
 Well, I would say you're laughing, we're laughing

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:16.560
 our asses off at the collaboration between the human

1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:18.040
 and the machine there.

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:18.880
 That's a good point, yeah.

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:21.880
 Because it's basically introducing absurdity

1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:27.240
 and into the equation and the kind of absurdity

1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:32.240
 that would, together with you, create hilarious stuff.

1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:36.560
 But on its own, I guess it is in some way

1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:39.080
 writing material for you that's funny,

1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:40.740
 but it's very specific to you.

1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:42.600
 It can't do standup on its own, I guess,

1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:43.440
 is what I'm saying.

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.940
 That's a good point, and that would be terrifying

1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:49.280
 to see an AI standup that can actually read a room,

1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:52.300
 come up with jokes that could complete that illusion

1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:53.960
 for an audience.

1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:55.880
 But I hear what you're saying, that it needs to be

1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:58.360
 a confluence of both of those elements,

1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:01.040
 and then, as you said, it kind of is.

1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:02.020
 It is, it is.

1:22:02.020 --> 1:22:05.400
 It's kind of, even though it's just for us,

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:07.460
 and I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this

1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:12.460
 up until right now, that in that this company approached us

1:22:12.460 --> 1:22:15.760
 and was like, here's this AI, and it's a podcast AI,

1:22:18.260 --> 1:22:22.760
 it's like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons

1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:23.600
 that I told you.

1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:26.180
 It's like, here's two guys that do the podcast stuff.

1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:28.420
 They're actually good friends, and it knows

1:22:28.420 --> 1:22:30.380
 what's gonna make us laugh.

1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:35.380
 But what is humor when it reaches its audience,

1:22:35.740 --> 1:22:40.060
 but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh?

1:22:40.060 --> 1:22:45.060
 At MADtv, all we were doing was, it was a group of actors

1:22:45.180 --> 1:22:49.100
 and writers, and writer actors, and vice versa,

1:22:51.540 --> 1:22:54.900
 who were, at its best, that show was a group of people

1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:56.780
 making each other laugh, you know?

1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.820
 And then, because we didn't have the internet,

1:22:58.820 --> 1:23:02.160
 we didn't have the immediate feedback,

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.780
 we had a message board or something.

1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:07.420
 We had emails at the very beginning, which, check this out,

1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:09.140
 people would, if you have a question or comment,

1:23:09.140 --> 1:23:12.980
 MADtv at whatever, and we would get the emails

1:23:12.980 --> 1:23:17.340
 on a Monday morning, and they would be in a binder or two

1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:20.380
 like this, and they would make their way around the office.

1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:21.940
 Who's got the emails?

1:23:21.940 --> 1:23:23.260
 Oh, they're in Brian's office.

1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:24.100
 So you go in there.

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:24.940
 And this is like your poll?

1:23:24.940 --> 1:23:28.500
 This is opinions from people about different things?

1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:31.520
 The emails, yeah, the people literally just writing

1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:32.360
 MADtv emails.

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.300
 It wasn't a message board.

1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.620
 Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah,

1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:39.540
 were fans saying, uh.

1:23:39.540 --> 1:23:40.380
 You suck?

1:23:40.380 --> 1:23:41.220
 Yeah, you suck.

1:23:41.220 --> 1:23:42.900
 Like a lot of that, when I first started the show,

1:23:42.900 --> 1:23:44.340
 for real, you know, because it's new,

1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:45.240
 and you're a new person.

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:46.940
 It's like, who's this fat bastard?

1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:49.820
 I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more.

1:23:49.820 --> 1:23:50.660
 That's a good point.

1:23:50.660 --> 1:23:52.100
 Yeah, when you're reading it off of paper,

1:23:52.100 --> 1:23:54.600
 and you can literally crunch it up in your hand.

1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:58.760
 But also, it was like, you know, I would like to see,

1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:01.580
 insert weird idea from some 14 year old.

1:24:01.580 --> 1:24:04.720
 You know, I want to see Stuart do this and Swan that.

1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:09.720
 And, but it was, it's a kind of dudesie, but human.

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:13.820
 Yeah, it was a very shitty dudesie in a loosely finder.

1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:18.820
 But the thing about the show was,

1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:21.060
 we're trying to make each other laugh.

1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:24.340
 And dudesie has found Chad and I,

1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:27.760
 who we make each other laugh, but it's joined in,

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:32.760
 and it's, listen, when I finished doing TMP.

1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:36.800
 TMP, the 10 minute podcast.

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:38.520
 I didn't really know what I wanted to do

1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:42.080
 in the podcast space, and this thing found me.

1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.200
 And it is genuinely cracking me up.

1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:46.600
 Anyway, I've said enough about that.

1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:49.520
 But I do think that it's figured something out.

1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:50.800
 I mean, it's a really interesting idea

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:52.140
 of AI generating the premise.

1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:54.080
 I mean, I do think in the future,

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.040
 AI will be able to generate comedy.

1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:01.240
 Standup is obviously the hardest form,

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:04.400
 because it's ultimately, it has to be live.

1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:08.920
 I think AI will be able to generate memes.

1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:11.000
 So there's like steps, right?

1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.680
 And then it will be able to generate a Twitter account

1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:15.680
 that people follow because it's funny,

1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:18.320
 like quips and stuff like that.

1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:20.760
 Almost like, it's a good example.

1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:23.480
 Conan O Brien is a good, I think, Twitter.

1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:25.420
 Where it's like one liners, two liners,

1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:27.480
 that kind of stuff that's in tweet form.

1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:32.280
 And then eventually, standup, where the timing

1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:36.160
 and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter,

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:37.400
 and then perfecting that.

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:40.280
 But I feel like all the information is there

1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:41.360
 to optimize over.

1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:43.840
 So I think that's the future,

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:47.960
 and that forces us to contend with

1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:51.880
 what do we find compelling and beautiful

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.040
 about the art form itself?

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.200
 So certainly an art that's being pushed,

1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:58.400
 that question is being raised.

1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:03.400
 Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being?

1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:05.560
 Why do we appreciate art?

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.760
 Is that, that's something you guys have talked about.

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:10.040
 What do you think about all the Dali

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:15.040
 and all the diffusion based methods that are being generated

1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.380
 that are being, that are generating art now?

1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:18.840
 What do you think about that?

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.220
 I know, I'll tell you what I think,

1:26:20.220 --> 1:26:22.620
 but I also feel like what I'm saying is,

1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:25.360
 I sound like the guy who didn't like

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.840
 that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:30.800
 You know, the more I talk to Chad about it,

1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:33.040
 the more I feel like grandpa doesn't wanna let go

1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:36.380
 of this or that, or I'm not ready for the printing press

1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:37.900
 or the horseless carriage.

1:26:37.900 --> 1:26:42.900
 But I do feel that art is a connection between people.

1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:47.960
 It's, when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture,

1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:49.640
 you're seeing the humanity of the person

1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:53.280
 that brought that painting to life

1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:56.400
 or sculpted this incredible piece of art.

1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:59.080
 And I think without the human being there to make it,

1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:03.640
 it's not worth as much just to have it there

1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:07.160
 because the art, it's advanced.

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.200
 I've seen it advance, I don't know, you tell me,

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.600
 but I feel like just in the past three or four months,

1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:13.800
 I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes.

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:14.680
 I'm not on the inside.

1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:18.240
 I don't get it even, but it's been getting a lot better,

1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:20.720
 the betas that they're releasing, right?

1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:23.080
 Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs,

1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:24.480
 I mean Dolly really started it,

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:27.220
 is that if you train a system on language,

1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:31.400
 it turns out there's a lot of language

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:33.440
 and images on the internet,

1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:35.800
 but language is really where it's at

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:37.920
 in terms of the depth of human knowledge.

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:40.120
 And so if you train a system on language,

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.220
 it's able to generate some incredible art.

1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:43.400
 And that was the breakthrough.

1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:44.760
 With the same kind of mechanisms

1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:45.900
 that are called transformers,

1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:49.560
 they're able to, when scaled,

1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:52.440
 capture some deep representation of the language

1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:53.800
 that's on the internet.

1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:57.320
 And so, yeah, the things it's been able to generate to me

1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:01.280
 look like it's novel.

1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:03.320
 It doesn't look like it's mimicking anything.

1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.040
 It looks like it's creating totally new ideas.

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:09.480
 And they're beautiful, and they're interesting,

1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:11.440
 and they're all the ways that we think

1:28:13.300 --> 1:28:14.360
 that art is interesting.

1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:15.600
 The only thing it's missing

1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:17.760
 is the scarcity that art often has,

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:19.920
 which is it takes a lot of work

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:21.520
 for one artist to create one piece,

1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:24.280
 one human being to create one piece of art

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.880
 that can just generate endlessly.

1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:30.760
 And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason.

1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:33.160
 Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do

1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.660
 that if art doesn't come from a human being,

1:28:35.660 --> 1:28:38.880
 it's inherently worth a little less?

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:41.400
 Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being,

1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:44.720
 but the artist matters.

1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:46.100
 Right.

1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:46.940
 For me.

1:28:46.940 --> 1:28:51.400
 And I think some of that has to do with the world view,

1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:54.280
 the artist and the backstory, the memories,

1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:57.680
 the life that led up to this piece of art,

1:28:57.680 --> 1:28:59.800
 the perspective they take on the world,

1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:01.960
 the journey they took to the world,

1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.400
 the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff.

1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:08.160
 But I think AI systems can probably have the same.

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:10.580
 But we would have to,

1:29:10.580 --> 1:29:13.720
 as opposed to treating it as a one black box,

1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:17.600
 it would have to be an artist that has a Twitter account,

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:19.640
 and they have a consistent personality,

1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:21.560
 they have a consistent avatar.

1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:22.400
 Yeah.

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:23.280
 And I think down the line,

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.320
 have something like human rights.

1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:27.820
 But then it really becomes awfully like a person.

1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:31.160
 Oi, that's terrifying.

1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:34.400
 As much as I dig dudes, it's terrifying, I hope.

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:36.280
 It's terrifying, like, you know,

1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:38.280
 a lot of things that came with the internet

1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:39.940
 and the digital age are terrifying.

1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:41.840
 Porn is terrifying, the mass,

1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:45.180
 like the amount of porn that's online now is terrifying.

1:29:45.180 --> 1:29:48.080
 The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar,

1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:51.800
 I would compare it more to the leap from,

1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:56.800
 to sort of to the Napster and the Spotifyzation of music,

1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.940
 which is like, you have these,

1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:01.440
 it's less about albums now,

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:03.120
 and it's more about individual songs,

1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:05.660
 and it's much easier to deliver the songs.

1:30:05.660 --> 1:30:09.160
 And it's more about sort of the engagement of the listener

1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:11.640
 versus like signing the artist

1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:14.100
 and like distribution of the artist and so on.

1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:19.100
 So it's just changing the way we consume stuff.

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:24.320
 And human interaction is changing

1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:26.920
 into meaningful interaction,

1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.320
 even if some of the entities involved are not human.

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.980
 Yes, and I feel like, you know, now,

1:30:34.980 --> 1:30:36.880
 like as I say, oh, I feel like grandpa

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:38.960
 who doesn't want to wait all day for,

1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:43.960
 or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato as, anyway,

1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:46.380
 Dana Carvey would say, it's another story.

1:30:46.380 --> 1:30:50.960
 But, that's from, remember he did this bit

1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:52.500
 on Saturday Night Live, where he's like,

1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:57.080
 I'm an old man, and I like things the way they used to be.

1:30:57.080 --> 1:31:00.080
 You know, like if you wanted a baked potato,

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.160
 you would have put it in the microwave, you had to,

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:04.400
 and then long story, uphill both ways

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:07.080
 and digging the potato and baking it all day in a fire.

1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:10.280
 But I'm like that grandpa now,

1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:12.880
 and I know that, you know, kids coming along,

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:14.200
 you see over the past 10 years,

1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:16.960
 like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:18.240
 and it's terrifying.

1:31:18.240 --> 1:31:20.840
 And I feel like I'm a little worried,

1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:23.680
 because I'm like, are you, is the future,

1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:26.040
 are the future generations gonna be able to understand

1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:29.200
 that this is not, not that it's not real,

1:31:29.200 --> 1:31:32.780
 it's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real,

1:31:32.780 --> 1:31:35.000
 it's real, it's what you perceive.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.600
 Perception is reality, and you know,

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:40.480
 99% of reality in a lot of ways,

1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:43.160
 especially in a digital world where everyone is now.

1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:44.260
 And then with the metaverse,

1:31:44.260 --> 1:31:45.880
 I don't even wanna think about it.

1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:47.360
 I don't even, I don't get it.

1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:49.480
 Really, truly.

1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:51.120
 I think people will figure out,

1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.160
 you see people on like on the train,

1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:56.400
 public transit and so on, they're staring at their phone.

1:31:57.980 --> 1:32:00.440
 I think, you have to remember that

1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:01.760
 the reason they're staring at their phone,

1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:02.680
 I mean, there's a lot of reasons,

1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:04.640
 but one of the reasons is they're connecting

1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:06.880
 with other human beings they love on that phone.

1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.960
 So it is a source of happiness and joy.

1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:12.000
 Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects

1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:16.720
 that we're all talking about and learning about,

1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:19.720
 and I think that means the next generation of social media,

1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:22.260
 social networks will be better,

1:32:22.260 --> 1:32:24.880
 and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way.

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:27.220
 We're just entering a new digital world

1:32:27.220 --> 1:32:30.540
 that will keep the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff.

1:32:30.540 --> 1:32:31.380
 Oh, I hope so.

1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:32.600
 That's really optimistic.

1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:34.160
 That sounds great.

1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:37.520
 I mean it, because I think that we're in,

1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:40.440
 we're clearly in the Wild West still of the internet,

1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:43.020
 and just when you think you're out of it,

1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:46.680
 the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous

1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:51.680
 and detrimental to people and populations of people,

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.040
 and it's terrifying to me.

1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:57.200
 It is, it's terrifying.

1:32:57.200 --> 1:32:58.840
 Let me ask you a bunch of random questions.

1:32:58.840 --> 1:32:59.680
 Okay. You ready?

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:00.520
 All right.

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:03.600
 If you can be someone else for a day,

1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:07.400
 someone alive today, who would you be?

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:09.280
 Somebody you haven't met.

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:11.200
 Oh, that's a really good question.

1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:12.020
 It could be dead.

1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:13.320
 You know, I changed my mind.

1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:14.480
 It could be somebody dead.

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:16.600
 I think any answer that I have right now

1:33:16.600 --> 1:33:18.980
 would be something that would be based

1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:21.220
 on some sort of experience.

1:33:21.220 --> 1:33:23.920
 Like, you know what I thought was very interesting

1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:25.820
 was last weekend or whatever,

1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:27.960
 the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins.

1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:30.760
 Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters,

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:32.820
 and he passed away tragically,

1:33:32.820 --> 1:33:36.360
 and so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl,

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:38.040
 and everybody that got together at this concert.

1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.840
 And you're watching Dave Grohl sing,

1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:44.680
 try to sing times like these, right?

1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:48.480
 And he's breaking up because he lost his friend, his brother.

1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:53.480
 And I was watching that, and he's at Wembley Stadium.

1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:56.600
 As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him

1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:00.860
 in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like.

1:34:00.860 --> 1:34:03.480
 That's the ultimate, like having to perform

1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:06.180
 despite something extremely human happening,

1:34:06.180 --> 1:34:11.180
 and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl

1:34:11.220 --> 1:34:15.580
 and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert

1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:18.080
 and love these artists that they're getting to see

1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:19.360
 up on stage.

1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:21.680
 So much love and so much pain at the same time.

1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:24.880
 I wonder what that would be like to be,

1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:26.820
 I guess, and I think that's just sort of coming

1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:29.520
 from the root of being a performer

1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:31.400
 and being in front of that many.

1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:34.560
 Have you ever had to perform while some rough stuff

1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:37.480
 is going on in your personal life, just mentally?

1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:38.800
 Yeah, sure.

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:39.800
 How tough is that?

1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:44.560
 I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize.

1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:49.880
 A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff

1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:52.120
 if you're doing something that,

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.160
 and there's a lot of, there's some acting techniques

1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:56.600
 that sort of.

1:34:56.600 --> 1:34:57.520
 Channel it?

1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:00.260
 Yeah, which I think is kind of,

1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:03.880
 I don't know that that's, I don't know.

1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:05.160
 For me, it's not really the thing,

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:08.680
 because I think if the writing is great,

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:12.800
 the writing is really good, you don't need to channel much.

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.260
 You need to invest in what's there,

1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:19.560
 and what I've always loved about that illusion

1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:22.280
 is really cracking a scene, getting it to a point

1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.760
 where you are feeling all of it,

1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:27.640
 and the most edifying stuff I've been a part of

1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:31.420
 as an actor, and I would say that it mostly comes out

1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:35.920
 of dramatic work, is when you're,

1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:39.300
 when you actually feel the emotions

1:35:39.300 --> 1:35:41.560
 that your character would feel, truly,

1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:43.840
 and it's not because you're pulling from a tragic thing

1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.080
 that happened, or a lost loved one,

1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.400
 or a lost love, or any of that.

1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:51.760
 I just did this one movie where we're doing the thing,

1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:54.360
 and it was a wonderful cast, and a great film,

1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:58.400
 and I'm giving a speech at a wedding,

1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:01.440
 and it really got to us.

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:03.560
 Like, it got to me, and then one of the other actors

1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:08.560
 came up and hugged me, in the characters that we were,

1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:10.600
 but the stakes of his character,

1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.760
 and what he's walked into, and the family

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:17.400
 that he's marrying into, and what my character,

1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:21.160
 my character's wife, want for my wife's sister,

1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:24.320
 and this whole thing, and it all became very real.

1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.320
 That was a set where the director showed up

1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:29.320
 to set every day, making sure that emotionally,

1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:31.180
 and it was a very dramatic film,

1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:32.440
 making sure that emotionally,

1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:34.400
 the table was set for his actors.

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:37.720
 Great crew, and a really nice, tight, little,

1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:40.520
 quick family, as a lot of these movies are.

1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.600
 You really love working with these people,

1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.600
 and then it's over, but I, that's when you feel the drug.

1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:49.440
 Like, it's like when you're golfing,

1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:52.040
 and you, and it's on the green,

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.480
 you're like, oh, I get it now.

1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.360
 So in the words, you can find the emotion,

1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:58.960
 the words summon the emotion.

1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.080
 The humanity's right there.

1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:01.120
 If you read a great script,

1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.200
 you're gonna sob in your living room.

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.960
 You know what the saddest, the toughest thing

1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:09.720
 about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective,

1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:12.680
 is from the people I've interacted with,

1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.020
 is how intimate that process is

1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:18.120
 between the group of people that create a thing,

1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:21.820
 that's a movie, and then you move on to the next thing.

1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.080
 It's almost, it's like, I don't know,

1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:27.200
 I mean, that's why people have relationships on set.

1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:28.200
 They get, they fall in love.

1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:29.200
 Totally.

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:30.200
 It's so sad.

1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:32.840
 I mean, like, that's why I think of the acting world

1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:36.480
 as like, you fall in love with each other, essentially.

1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:38.480
 You become close friends, then you move on,

1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:40.600
 because that's kind of the process of career.

1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:42.120
 You know, like the example I just gave,

1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:43.120
 if you're doing it right, yeah,

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:45.580
 there is a certain amount of that happening,

1:37:45.580 --> 1:37:47.620
 but I do still feel like you can,

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.600
 you gotta compartmentalize it,

1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:52.600
 and you've gotta be able to wash it off

1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:53.560
 as soon as it's over.

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:56.280
 Prostitutes say the same thing, so I,

1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:57.800
 it's where I try.

1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.800
 Look, sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody,

1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:06.280
 because it's been very emotional,

1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:09.560
 and with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome,

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:12.880
 but you get pretty good at saying goodbye

1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:14.920
 and being like, I'll see ya if I see ya.

1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:18.480
 You have to get good at that, or else you'll never,

1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:20.720
 you'll just be bent up all the time.

1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:23.200
 I saw an actor once, we were doing this series,

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:27.200
 and we did it for a year, and it was a lot of fun,

1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:28.440
 and it was a tight little group,

1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:29.920
 and then one of the actors,

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:32.140
 we were doing one of our last things together.

1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:33.600
 We had already shot the last show,

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.800
 and we just had to take some pictures for,

1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:39.040
 you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever.

1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:41.640
 So we're set up, and we're taking our pictures together,

1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:43.540
 and then we move into these single shots,

1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:46.880
 and this actor was finished, and I watched them.

1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:48.920
 It's like, okay, so and so's wrapped,

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:51.200
 and they said some goodbyes and stuff,

1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:53.000
 and I didn't say my goodbye,

1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.920
 because maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye.

1:38:56.920 --> 1:38:59.400
 I feel like we've said everything, you know what I mean?

1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:01.060
 And this person knows that I revere them,

1:39:01.060 --> 1:39:03.400
 and they're an idol of mine,

1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:07.520
 and they walked off the sound stage,

1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:10.280
 and I literally thought to myself,

1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:12.280
 that'll be the last time I see that person,

1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:14.700
 and the show did not come back,

1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:16.640
 and that was the last time I'll see them around.

1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:18.480
 Doesn't that just break your heart?

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.480
 A little bit, but I know what she's going back to,

1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.160
 which is her family,

1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:27.560
 and that's more important than all of this,

1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:31.460
 and that's the thing about a TV family or a movie family,

1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:34.680
 when you get together and you're a family for a while,

1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:37.420
 you are, you spend your days together.

1:39:37.420 --> 1:39:39.240
 A lot of times, you see the people that you work with

1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:40.860
 more than you see your loved ones,

1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:43.120
 so in showbiz, it's no different, right?

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:44.920
 And yeah, you're doing some, you know,

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:46.520
 you gotta say words, and every once in a while,

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:48.840
 you gotta kiss someone or pretend you love them,

1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:53.840
 but it's just, it underscores how, for me,

1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:58.040
 look, man, my salvation has always been,

1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:00.800
 and I feel so fortunate to have had it,

1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.800
 is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing

1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:08.600
 that I want for my kids someday,

1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.360
 and I can't wait to get back to my house

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:15.140
 with my fiance and the dogs, you know,

1:40:15.140 --> 1:40:16.680
 until we have kids.

1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:19.080
 Live in a cabin in Canada somewhere.

1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:23.160
 Absolutely, I just wanna buy some land over an aquifer,

1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:25.800
 as I like to say, because water will be the new money,

1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:30.200
 and just make sure that all my kids are drinking

1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:33.600
 as much H2O as I am, which is a lot.

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.840
 I'm peeing right now, as a matter of fact.

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.800
 Do you need a bathroom?

1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:38.620
 No, no, no, I got it.

1:40:38.620 --> 1:40:39.460
 Not anymore?

1:40:39.460 --> 1:40:40.960
 No, I'm wearing two layers, it depends, don't worry about it.

1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:44.880
 Good, so I did a podcast with Bobby Lee

1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:48.340
 and he said, he was extremely kind,

1:40:48.340 --> 1:40:51.080
 and he said that he was scared shitless

1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:55.480
 to be on the podcast, and he actually literally took,

1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:58.440
 he asked as the first thing to go take a dump

1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:00.320
 because of how scared he was.

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.520
 So that leads me to a question,

1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:03.720
 what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.500
 Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been

1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:08.800
 before a performance?

1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:13.320
 I mean, I always get a little nervous.

1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:16.160
 I think you're doing it right if you're still nervous.

1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:17.360
 Were you nervous today?

1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.260
 Well, no, man, because this isn't a performance.

1:41:20.260 --> 1:41:22.400
 I'm being completely genuine.

1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:23.860
 You're wearing a suit.

1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:24.700
 Yeah, that was.

1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:26.480
 I feel like that makes you nervous.

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:27.320
 Wearing a suit?

1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:28.160
 It makes me nervous.

1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:29.600
 Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar.

1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:30.920
 If you're watching this on YouTube,

1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:33.640
 you can see me just, I'm constantly doing,

1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:36.280
 it's like I'm doing a cheap Rodney Dangerfield,

1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:37.120
 but I am truly.

1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.080
 But when you move your head, it kind of makes it seem

1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:42.720
 like you're a mobster who's pissed off a little bit.

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:46.040
 You fucking crossed me one last time, you son of a.

1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:49.480
 You know, this mutt, I think it's the first time

1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:53.360
 I've fucking dug a hole, I'll dig a fucking hole, Jesus.

1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:55.920
 No, but truly, I hate having a collar.

1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:59.440
 I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin

1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:02.540
 or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style.

1:42:02.540 --> 1:42:05.760
 The most scared I've been before a performance,

1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:09.640
 I can't pinpoint anything.

1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:12.760
 I, you know, when I was a kid, right?

1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:15.960
 I, like I said, I was fortunate enough to start acting

1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:18.520
 as a teen and stuff professionally.

1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:20.580
 And I just remember my first gig.

1:42:20.580 --> 1:42:23.880
 And I remember saying my handful of lines

1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:26.680
 in the bathroom mirror the night before going,

1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:30.100
 this might be my only fucking shot.

1:42:30.100 --> 1:42:33.420
 You're not gonna get me, I'm gonna be solid.

1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:37.680
 And if I'm worried about something,

1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:40.320
 I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it

1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:43.360
 as an actor until it's impossible for me

1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:48.360
 not to get a take at least that I'm 100%,

1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:52.120
 if not 95, maybe percent happy with.

1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:54.200
 And the rest for me is letting go, which is hard

1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:56.880
 because I can be a real perfectionist.

1:42:56.880 --> 1:42:58.600
 I always want another,

1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:00.560
 I always wanna do it a little better.

1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:01.920
 That's what's great about podcasting.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:05.260
 This is one take and you're done, there's no takes.

1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:07.240
 You're just talking and then it's over.

1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:09.600
 And you're doing some silly stuff.

1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:11.720
 And I'll, you know.

1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:14.520
 Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great?

1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:15.440
 Podcasting is great?

1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:17.060
 Yeah, because it's one take and it's over.

1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:20.440
 It's just, what, I said it again?

1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:21.280
 Ah, fuck.

1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:23.800
 I see what you did.

1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:25.840
 And yeah, I fell right for it.

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:27.880
 I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.

1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:29.720
 That's your problem.

1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.560
 You know, but still when we do the podcast,

1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:34.000
 we'll like finish and I'll look over at Chad

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.080
 and I go, that one thing that I did wasn't that funny.

1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:38.360
 I was like, shut up, man.

1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.120
 Just, it doesn't matter.

1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:41.400
 It's a fucking hang.

1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:43.840
 We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there.

1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:44.840
 That's what we're doing.

1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:46.600
 So that anxiety is there.

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.360
 That self criticism or whatever that is, that voice.

1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:51.120
 I say sorry after takes.

1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.320
 I'll always finish a take and go.

1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:56.320
 And I've had directors, to the detriment of myself,

1:43:56.320 --> 1:43:59.440
 I've had directors be like, stop doing that.

1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:00.400
 Because I'll like finish the take

1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:02.840
 and then I also have like the will phase.

1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:06.000
 When I'm just like, I'll finish the take and cut.

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.160
 And I'm making a face right now, like I smelled something.

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.280
 That's what I'll do.

1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:13.360
 I'll literally be like, ah, cause I just,

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.360
 I look at what I do in the purest sense as,

1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.440
 I think a lot of people wanna be good at something.

1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:30.120
 I've only, the only thing I've ever really wanted

1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:33.880
 to be good at is being an actor.

1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:37.120
 And that's the only thing,

1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:38.640
 of course I wanna be a good person.

1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:41.360
 I wanna be a good partner to my fiance.

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:45.640
 I wanna have kids and be the father that I had.

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:48.760
 And I wanna be the parent that I had from my parents

1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:51.680
 who were fucking amazing, wonderful people.

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:53.520
 And there's all those things.

1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:56.240
 That's all, you know, you should want all those things.

1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:00.600
 But as far as doing a thing, like what is my trade?

1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:04.760
 You know, I wanna be really good at it.

1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:08.240
 My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right?

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.520
 And I say Napoli, cause I'm Italian.

1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:13.600
 And so my grandfather on my mom's side, my nonopepe,

1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:18.400
 he was a plumber and he was also like a handyman.

1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:20.160
 Like people would bring him like,

1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:21.560
 you know like the old Chianti bottle

1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:24.320
 with like with the woven bottom part.

1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:26.440
 People would bring him like a broken bottle,

1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.080
 be like, hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this?

1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:29.920
 And he'd be saying,

1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:31.600
 if you're telling the backstory of Mario,

1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:33.200
 that's not actually your family life.

1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:34.040
 Yeah.

1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:34.880
 But okay.

1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:35.720
 He said I'm a fix.

1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:36.560
 Yeah.

1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:37.440
 And so Giuseppe, what?

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:40.240
 He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone.

1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:43.320
 And he was a really good plumber.

1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:45.600
 My mom used to always say that guy was an amazing,

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:46.680
 he was a great.

1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:47.560
 He took pride in that?

1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:48.400
 Yeah.

1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:50.340
 I always feel like, you know,

1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:53.560
 there's what you set out to do

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:55.480
 as an idealistic little teenager.

1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:57.240
 I wanna be like so and so,

1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.360
 and I wanna, you know, hear my big dreams and stuff.

1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.960
 And I can't believe that I'm still in the business.

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:03.800
 Okay.

1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:06.480
 That's, first of all, let me say that right now.

1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:08.400
 I can't believe it.

1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:13.200
 But what I really, it's the one thing that it's like,

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:15.160
 I can't give up on a take.

1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:18.560
 You know, I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it.

1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:21.200
 And I don't really know why that is

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:24.400
 outside of wanting to be good at something.

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:27.360
 When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber,

1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:30.280
 I'm not, you know, I'm not Roto Rooter.

1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:32.760
 Like I'm not the guy with the big full page ad,

1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:36.760
 but I'm also not, you know, triple A abacus brothers

1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:39.120
 or whatever, like the shitty one.

1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:42.160
 I would like to hope that just,

1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:44.640
 and I'm saying this with pride for what I do.

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:46.400
 I'm not trying to say here's my standing

1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:48.480
 or where I wanna be in the fucking business.

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:49.880
 That's not what I mean.

1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:51.560
 I mean that I wanna be good at it.

1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:52.720
 You know, we all, hello?

1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:55.200
 I'm in Friedman Enterprises.

1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:57.440
 So that's the hotel phone.

1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:00.280
 Come on.

1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:03.280
 Hello?

1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:06.760
 Hello?

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.080
 You got some fruit?

1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:12.800
 Some sliced fruit?

1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:14.280
 No, do you want some sliced fruit?

1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:15.120
 I'm all good.

1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.120
 No, we're good, thank you so much.

1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:18.400
 All right, bye bye.

1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:19.720
 It's always a fruit plate.

1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:22.680
 Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate

1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:23.520
 in life, you know?

1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:24.360
 It's a pretty sweet existence.

1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.440
 Wouldn't it be funny if that was actually like the CIA

1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:28.000
 and they were actually saying something else

1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.080
 and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about,

1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:31.080
 you want some fruit?

1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:32.080
 You want some fruit?

1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:33.920
 And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head

1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:35.440
 and the ceiling disappears.

1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:38.640
 And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.240
 Wrap it up.

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:43.440
 You jump out the window and there's a helicopter waiting.

1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:45.200
 Oh, what were we talking about?

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:46.200
 The fruit distracted me.

1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:50.840
 So, oh, the, do you wanna be the yellow page ad?

1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:54.520
 I wanna be the guy on the second or third page

1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:56.920
 where it's like, you're not gonna pay

1:47:56.920 --> 1:47:58.000
 what that guy charges you,

1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.040
 but I'm not gonna charge you what this loser charges.

1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:05.160
 I wanna break down the middle and the work is guaranteed.

1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:07.600
 That's kind of what I wanna,

1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:10.920
 it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough

1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:15.360
 to be doing my whole life and that I wanna be good at.

1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:16.680
 Everyone wants to be good at something.

1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:19.240
 If you're fortunate enough to be able to do

1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:22.160
 what you love as a job, I mean, my God, I'm so,

1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:25.240
 again, I can't believe I get to do it.

1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.160
 I just wanna be good at it so that I can fucking die someday

1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:30.920
 and go, eh.

1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:34.000
 I tried not to give up on a take and I,

1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.040
 and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror

1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:39.320
 the night before if I have to.

1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:41.680
 Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice.

1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:45.560
 I just, after every podcast, after this podcast,

1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:48.120
 I'll probably be like, you're boring.

1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:49.120
 Why are you so boring?

1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:50.760
 That, that, that, that, that, that, that.

1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:53.080
 And I just gave a lecture at MIT.

1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:56.840
 I was like, I get so much love from people.

1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:59.080
 They're such beautiful people.

1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:00.720
 And I just remember walking home,

1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:07.080
 just feeling like I wasted everybody's time, you know?

1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:09.360
 And I don't know what that is.

1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:11.760
 I don't, you know, I do hope that that's a voice

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:14.960
 that won't destroy me, you know, like every time.

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:16.880
 That's really human of you to admit that

1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:20.240
 because people don't wanna, they wouldn't assume that,

1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:22.600
 of course, from you or anything that, I mean,

1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:26.440
 you've got a large group of students in there

1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:28.160
 listening to you and feeling the way

1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:29.960
 and thinking what they think of you.

1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:34.120
 So that's really interesting to hear you admit that,

1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:36.600
 but it's also, I would expect nothing else.

1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:39.120
 You have to be able to, it's such a,

1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:40.560
 I mean, you're a human fucking being.

1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:43.400
 And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know,

1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:45.040
 some people that might hear that, they would say,

1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:47.160
 well, that's a problem you have to fix.

1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:51.360
 And I think that that might be just who I am.

1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:53.240
 Yeah.

1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:55.680
 Because I'm not, you know, I've been very, very fortunate

1:49:55.680 --> 1:49:59.720
 not to have chemical, you know, like depression

1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:01.480
 where I get into a dark place.

1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:04.400
 I could get stuck in a downward spiral.

1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:06.760
 It's usually a thing that lasts.

1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:10.360
 You ride it out and then after a good night's sleep,

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:13.600
 you're back to your happy self.

1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:17.880
 So I think I have to try to figure that out.

1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:19.560
 Is that just part of the creative process,

1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:21.880
 being a creative human in this world?

1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:23.480
 I haven't found any other way.

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:24.640
 I'm always kicking myself.

1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:29.640
 Take that, dude, so you can't, you're not gonna be human

1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:30.960
 until you feel some despair.

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:33.360
 Yeah, until you absolutely hate the shit

1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:34.760
 that you're doing sometimes.

1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:39.160
 What small act of kindness were you once shown

1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:40.880
 that you will never forget?

1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:42.800
 Do you, does something jump to mind

1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:46.280
 where somebody just did something that made you smile?

1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:51.240
 Did you feel connected to the rest of humanity?

1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.480
 Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know?

1:50:57.640 --> 1:51:00.280
 But I remember my niece one time,

1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.480
 one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood

1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:09.280
 and she was like, she might've been five or six at the time.

1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:10.560
 They're all adults now.

1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.200
 My brother and sister are older than me

1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:15.120
 and the kids are all, the youngest is 22.

1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:17.560
 And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces,

1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:18.960
 she was just, she had ice cream.

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.120
 We went out and we got ice cream

1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.200
 walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood.

1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:25.560
 And she said something to me that I don't think

1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:27.600
 she understands how much it meant at the time,

1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:30.440
 but she goes, she goes, people love you here.

1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.360
 You know that?

1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.120
 And she doesn't know where here is.

1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:35.360
 She's five years old, but she was just looking

1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:36.840
 at the kids playing in the park

1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:38.320
 and the people walking their dogs

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:41.280
 and everyone just, people love you here, you know that?

1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:43.360
 But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that

1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:45.960
 at that point, which is really heavy for me.

1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:47.040
 I'll never forget it.

1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:48.360
 I've never told her that.

1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:52.320
 Oh, well, man, anytime you get a little something

1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:55.520
 from people, especially in a tear your ass out city

1:51:55.520 --> 1:51:58.640
 like LA where nobody has any fucking time for you,

1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:02.720
 when someone can slow it down and say something, you know?

1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:07.920
 I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to

1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:10.960
 who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie

1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:13.440
 and every time I see this clip, I still laugh.

1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:17.240
 And I am kind of shy, you know, personally,

1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:20.600
 but so he was walking by, he was walking out

1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:23.040
 and I was walking in and I go, oh, that's that guy.

1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:27.440
 And I did not stop to just let him know

1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:29.280
 how great I thought he was in this film.

1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:31.120
 And I always kind of regretted it.

1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:31.960
 You know what I mean?

1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:35.040
 So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don't,

1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.240
 if I see someone that has done something in any way,

1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:42.760
 it doesn't have to be in show business or anything like that.

1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:46.320
 I'll try and say, hey, that's really good.

1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:47.320
 You know what I mean?

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:53.720
 Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know?

1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:55.440
 It can mean a lot.

1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:57.360
 At a certain time in life when you need it.

1:52:57.360 --> 1:52:58.200
 Yeah.

1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.560
 That can make a big difference.

1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:03.440
 I mean, sorry to take it back to my new girlfriend,

1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:04.280
 the waitress.

1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:05.120
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:08.320
 But there's something about her saying sweetheart.

1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:09.160
 Yeah.

1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:11.520
 It's a pretty low place for some reason mentally.

1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:14.840
 And it's just that basic human kindness was nice.

1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:16.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:17.320
 I hear you.

1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:21.080
 I was at a restaurant in New York recently

1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:22.280
 and I was shooting something

1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:25.040
 and my fiance was able to fly in for a week.

1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:27.880
 And she was back at the hotel

1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:29.440
 and it's like I felt like I was cheating on her

1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:31.280
 because there was this nice waitress

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:33.240
 at this barbecue place I went to.

1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:35.480
 And first of all, my fiance would not like me

1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:37.600
 eating any greasy, sugary barbecue.

1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:39.200
 So I felt like I was cheating on her there.

1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:42.280
 We'll edit this out and put delicious vegan food over it.

1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:44.680
 But the waitress was one of these,

1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:47.520
 she was the kind of server who's like,

1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:49.680
 hey hun, hey sweetie, blah, blah, blah.

1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:52.960
 But like so chill and at ease

1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:54.520
 in the middle of a part of New York

1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:59.520
 that's really kind of fucking pretentious and everybody.

1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:02.960
 But sweet people, fucking way better people

1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:03.800
 than we got here.

1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:07.080
 But I know that.

1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:09.200
 But it was part of New York and whatever,

1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:10.720
 I'm there working and people,

1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:12.800
 I'm like, I'm trying to impress one another.

1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:15.760
 And she even had some sort of an accent

1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:20.020
 that didn't feel like an Atlantic American accent.

1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:26.280
 Yeah, those servers that say sweetheart and hun,

1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:27.960
 that's what we need from AI.

1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:30.400
 We need that Jetson server.

1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:33.240
 Every once in a while just calls you sweetheart.

1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:36.160
 What comforts you on bad days?

1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:37.000
 Oh man.

1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.440
 Is there little sources of comfort?

1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:43.120
 Small things they do that kind of make you feel good.

1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:45.880
 Like for Bobby, that'd be a little Skyrim.

1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:48.720
 A little stroll through Skyrim.

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:51.560
 Well, I've been a line of coke or what?

1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:52.760
 Yeah, a line of coke.

1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:54.920
 I dilute some coke into whiskey in the morning

1:54:54.920 --> 1:54:56.440
 like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:57.280
 And then I snort the whiskey.

1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:58.120
 Oh, she did that, I didn't know that.

1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:00.080
 Yeah, yeah, oh my gosh, interesting.

1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:02.200
 Yeah, he didn't last too long, weird.

1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.480
 Well, his music will last forever.

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.040
 See, there you go.

1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:10.760
 For me, if I, I'm kind of a homebody.

1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.760
 So if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot

1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:21.040
 and then go like lay down on the couch

1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:26.040
 and perhaps if my fiancee's kind of nodding off

1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:27.960
 or she's just like looking at her phone

1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:30.880
 and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay?

1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:32.560
 Because I grew up watching wrestling

1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:35.080
 and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect.

1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:37.800
 I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape.

1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:40.000
 This stuff makes no sense in the world.

1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.840
 It's an art form that is so uniquely weird,

1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.840
 but at the same time, so everyone, when it's good,

1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:54.000
 everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience.

1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.960
 They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys.

1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:58.080
 So if I'm like that,

1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:00.360
 and then I got our two cute little dogs there

1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.240
 and I'm annoying my little dog Lulio

1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:05.000
 and trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth

1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:06.120
 and I've had a little bit of pot

1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:09.240
 and the dog's like, stop, pot's not good for me.

1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:11.360
 Of course, don't ever blow pot in your dog's face.

1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:13.680
 That's a small comfort.

1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:15.600
 I guess that's a handful of things.

1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:19.120
 No, that moment painted, that was like a little painting.

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:19.960
 What about you?

1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:25.720
 You're not supposed to do this.

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:26.560
 I will.

1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.480
 You're not supposed to do this.

1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:29.880
 That's a good question.

1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:32.200
 Yeah, it's a tough question.

1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:39.360
 I would say programming robots.

1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:43.600
 There's bringing to life, actually programming at all.

1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:47.000
 So I don't know how familiar you are with programming,

1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:52.000
 but you write some text on a page, right, on a screen

1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:56.440
 and it's brought to life, like it does something.

1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:01.400
 And that's kind of, that's a really tiny version

1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:03.720
 of maybe having a child.

1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:07.600
 Like you created something that is now living

1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:11.400
 in some smaller big way with embodied robots

1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:14.920
 that are legged robots, that's especially clear.

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:19.320
 And for some reason, that's a source of comfort for me,

1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:22.640
 that the power of programming,

1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:25.320
 but also the elegance of programming, just the whole thing.

1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:29.040
 It's a source of happiness.

1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:31.200
 There's so many things I've been very blessed

1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:34.120
 with enjoying anything.

1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:36.360
 Like that's part of the struggle I have in life

1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.440
 is that the simple stuff is a source

1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:40.000
 of a lot of happiness for me,

1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.440
 which leads to a lot of laziness.

1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:45.840
 So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines.

1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.160
 I have to be freaking out on purpose

1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:50.920
 in order to be productive in this world at all.

1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:53.920
 You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy.

1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:54.760
 No.

1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.520
 No, I am, but because I'm constantly creating

1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:02.520
 artificial stress and deadlines and all that kind of stuff.

1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:05.520
 Otherwise, I would just sit there looking at a tree happy.

1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:08.640
 I'm truly happy with everything.

1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:09.800
 That's awesome.

1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:10.640
 Yeah.

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.880
 Gee whiz, that's not.

1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:15.920
 Well, that's the line of Coke in the whiskey in the morning.

1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:18.520
 That's the thing that does the trick.

1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:21.000
 TV Ray Vaughan breakfast shake.

1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.120
 By the way, one of my most favorite guitars.

1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:24.600
 I play guitar too, that's a source of comfort.

1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:27.000
 Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar, that's awesome.

1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000
 Who's the greatest wrestler of all time?

1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.760
 Greatest in ring performer of all time

1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:32.200
 is Bret the Hitman Hart.

1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:33.880
 What's the difference in ring versus?

1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:36.960
 Well, there's many facets to the art form.

1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:39.320
 A lot of people are great on the mic,

1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:41.800
 but they're not so great once they get in the ring.

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.960
 A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff,

1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:48.600
 but then they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package,

1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:50.640
 but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth

1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:52.000
 and there's nothing going on.

1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:53.800
 So who's the greatest in ring performer?

1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:56.120
 I think the greatest in ring is Bret Hart.

1:58:56.120 --> 1:58:57.360
 I don't think there's anyone better

1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:59.560
 than Bret the Hitman Hart.

1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:02.800
 What makes him so good?

1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:03.640
 Well, he...

1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:06.720
 I think I had an action figure of him in Russia

1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:08.280
 and we didn't know what the hell that was.

1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:10.480
 Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights.

1:59:11.720 --> 1:59:12.640
 Everything makes sense.

1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:15.040
 Every single thing is rooted in the thing

1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:18.040
 that just happened and everything that he does

1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:21.040
 is to set up what he's going to do.

1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:22.960
 They call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd,

1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:25.680
 but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology.

1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:29.280
 The things that you have to do to make it seem

1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:32.120
 like you're suffering or you're coming from behind

1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:34.320
 or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it.

1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:35.160
 He does it at a...

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:38.160
 He would do it at a 100 miles an hour

1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:40.160
 and never hurt anybody.

1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:41.000
 Although,

1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:45.760
 I also love the every...

1:59:45.760 --> 1:59:47.960
 The greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says,

1:59:47.960 --> 1:59:51.960
 and they're right, is Ric Flair, nature boy, Ric Flair.

1:59:51.960 --> 1:59:53.080
 Everyone says this?

1:59:53.080 --> 1:59:56.280
 Yeah, I think if you know what you're talking about.

1:59:56.280 --> 1:59:57.600
 Because he's the best on the mic,

1:59:57.600 --> 2:00:00.400
 he's also incredible in the ring.

2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:02.160
 And then for me, the sentimental favorite,

2:00:02.160 --> 2:00:04.160
 which we've actually, on DudeZ,

2:00:04.160 --> 2:00:08.680
 Chad had sort of a Charlie Rose ask interview with me

2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:11.200
 about this, my fascination with Hulk Hogan.

2:00:11.200 --> 2:00:13.080
 Because to me, just he was Superman.

2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:16.240
 I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted.

2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:18.200
 But yeah, see, this is like asking me

2:00:18.200 --> 2:00:20.200
 who my favorite child is.

2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:21.440
 Right, so...

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:23.400
 The rock when the rock was...

2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:25.480
 I mean, the rock's the rock.

2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:27.280
 Yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is...

2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:31.080
 He's the weirdest one, right?

2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:32.640
 For me, from the outside.

2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:34.040
 Super weird.

2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:35.000
 That...

2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.640
 I don't know what that is exactly.

2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:38.920
 Everything's weird about him.

2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:39.760
 Yeah.

2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:40.640
 He's got the bald head,

2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:44.840
 like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair,

2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:46.400
 the handlebar mustache,

2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:49.920
 and this ketchup and mustard tights,

2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:52.960
 which he says he credits McDonald's with the tights.

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:54.080
 He literally does?

2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:57.960
 He says that the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo,

2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:01.720
 who's Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad,

2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:03.960
 who was a wrestler and a promoter.

2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:06.080
 He said that he saw him wearing yellow

2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:07.680
 and he's a Tampa guy,

2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:10.520
 so he had that brown skin and the hair and everything.

2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:11.840
 So he's like, oh, that's what I wanna do.

2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:14.320
 And also the brand recognition of like,

2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:17.480
 well, I should do it like McDonald's, literally.

2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:22.200
 And he's a big, swollen, muscular guy

2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:25.000
 with tan brown skin screaming at me

2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:28.120
 to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old.

2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:30.280
 That was extremely...

2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:31.120
 Yeah.

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:32.240
 He's like Superman.

2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.240
 But I know there's a person behind that guy.

2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:35.080
 Yeah.

2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:36.120
 What do you mean?

2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:38.280
 Well, he's Terry Bollea,

2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:42.600
 the dude who does whatever the fuck he does with his life.

2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:43.440
 You know what I mean?

2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:44.280
 Yeah.

2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:45.240
 Complicated life.

2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:48.720
 Yeah, I guess, to be him, yeah.

2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:52.680
 Maybe you should change the dude's colors to yellow, right?

2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:53.520
 Red and yellow.

2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:57.400
 It's currently orange and, boy, sky blue.

2:01:57.400 --> 2:01:59.140
 Yeah, it's like a nice sky blue.

2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:04.000
 What advice, since you're wearing a suit,

2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:05.960
 I feel like you're qualified to give advice.

2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:08.440
 What advice would you give to young people,

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:09.720
 high school, college,

2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:13.480
 about how to have a career they can be proud of

2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:15.840
 or how to have a life they can be proud of?

2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:19.660
 I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time.

2:02:19.660 --> 2:02:20.500
 That's the only,

2:02:20.500 --> 2:02:23.760
 that's the compass that we have is listening to your gut.

2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:25.880
 What does your gut tell you?

2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:28.800
 Was that originally the dream of being an actor?

2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:29.880
 Yeah, for me.

2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:32.600
 Your parents support that at all?

2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:36.160
 I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants,

2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:40.200
 so they didn't really know a lot about what you...

2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:41.200
 So you just made shit up?

2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:42.280
 You just made shit up?

2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:44.240
 Yeah, of course I'm studying and I'm skipping school

2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:46.160
 to go do auditions and stuff.

2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:48.680
 No, I just kind of feel like,

2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:51.200
 and I know it was different from my older siblings

2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:54.640
 because my parents had just shown up in Canada.

2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:56.240
 I was born like 10 years later.

2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:02.360
 You can get away with some things and you can actually...

2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:05.680
 I think my parents, they wanted us to,

2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:09.200
 they didn't have a whole lot to tell us about what to do.

2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:12.160
 They weren't gonna do that with us

2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:14.400
 because they're in this brand new world

2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:16.200
 and there's all these possibilities.

2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:22.520
 But there was something that I feel like they had to do,

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:25.680
 which was tell us to do what we love.

2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:27.320
 If you love doing it, do it.

2:03:28.300 --> 2:03:31.400
 And I feel like that's really served me

2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:33.360
 and what I would tell young people is

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.800
 if you can find something you love,

2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:38.560
 and nowadays with the internet and finding other people,

2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.120
 that it's not like you need to find a lot of people anymore.

2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:45.840
 You just need to find the people that dig what you dig.

2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:49.040
 And if you can make a career out of doing something

2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:53.660
 that you love that's been said, it's a good thing.

2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:56.440
 How long did it take you to figure out

2:03:56.440 --> 2:03:59.620
 that you really love acting?

2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:02.080
 Because sometimes you have a dream

2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:05.480
 and the dream meets reality, right?

2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:07.800
 And then the reality might be much less pleasant

2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:09.680
 or much darker than the dream.

2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:12.160
 Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know?

2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:16.120
 And there are things that happen during an experience

2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:19.600
 of shooting something that you could take or leave, right?

2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:23.960
 But the part where you're on set

2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:27.400
 and you've rehearsed for a minute or whatever,

2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:29.000
 at least you know where you're supposed to stand

2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:30.640
 and you know all your lines show up,

2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:33.080
 knowing everything, knowing what you're gonna do

2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:35.440
 and what you aim to do.

2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:38.800
 And those moments make it all worth it.

2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:41.640
 When you're, not to sound like a douchebag,

2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:45.520
 but between action and cut, that's the stuff

2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:50.520
 that has me continuing to do what I do,

2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:54.840
 aside from the fact that it's like,

2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:56.600
 I don't know how to do anything else.

2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:00.500
 You think you'll ever do like a dramatic, like a mob movie?

2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:02.240
 Yeah, like the one, the inside game

2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:03.200
 that I was just talking about,

2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:05.600
 or there's this other movie I just did a little while ago

2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:07.760
 called American Woman that was very heavy.

2:05:08.840 --> 2:05:10.880
 And I love doing dramatic work.

2:05:10.880 --> 2:05:12.880
 I love it, I love it.

2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:15.040
 Yeah, and I played that inside game.

2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:18.360
 It was kind of a, you know, there was a mob element

2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:21.380
 and the fellow was, well, you know,

2:05:21.380 --> 2:05:26.200
 the story's here or there with regard to how deep into the,

2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:27.560
 but well, he was a bookie.

2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:29.880
 He was just running money, you know,

2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:31.880
 he was making a lot of money for a lot of people

2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:33.960
 and he figured out how to, you know,

2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:37.600
 cook it with this dude who was an NBA ref

2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:40.520
 and it's a very interesting documentary,

2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:42.440
 the thing that they just untold,

2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:45.280
 under the untold series, they cover it.

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:50.240
 But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me

2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:52.040
 because he's like a, you know,

2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:54.400
 there was a lot of unsavory stuff

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:57.040
 and he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie

2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:00.240
 who is the wild card and you don't wanna

2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:02.040
 necessarily mess with him.

2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:04.000
 And I got to, by the way, this fellow,

2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:07.240
 who is the real guy, speaking to him,

2:06:07.240 --> 2:06:12.240
 it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him,

2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:14.240
 he was a little concerned about this and that,

2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:16.560
 like, hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck you want

2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:18.400
 in your movie, I got my book and I got this other

2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:20.540
 fucking deal, but he goes, you know,

2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:22.360
 I didn't do this and I didn't do that.

2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:23.760
 And I'm like, yeah, all right, I got you.

2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:25.360
 And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you,

2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:26.920
 like I'm talking to you one on one,

2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:28.600
 I did not do this, I did, okay?

2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.280
 I'm just fucking telling you, do whatever the fuck

2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:32.320
 you want with your movie, but this is what's up.

2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:33.480
 And I said, you ever seen Goodfellas?

2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:35.520
 He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie.

2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:38.200
 Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit.

2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:40.460
 And I go, you remember the scene where,

2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:43.920
 where, you know, the guy, the neighbor,

2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:46.240
 Lorraine Bracco's neighbor was, you know,

2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:48.280
 made her uncomfortable and was touching on her

2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:50.840
 and she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes,

2:06:50.840 --> 2:06:52.240
 where the fuck does this guy live?

2:06:52.240 --> 2:06:54.400
 And then he go, and remember, he walks across the street

2:06:54.400 --> 2:06:56.280
 and pistol whips the dude.

2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:59.360
 You touch her again, you're dead, you hear me?

2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:01.520
 Don't you fucking great scene.

2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:03.440
 He goes, I love that scene.

2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:04.760
 I go, that's you.

2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:07.600
 So you're doing shit that we know is terrible,

2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:08.440
 but we love you.

2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:09.760
 He goes, all right, I got it.

2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:11.480
 And then I said, there's this one scene,

2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:13.640
 I explained the scene to him where the,

2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:17.240
 one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window

2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:21.160
 of the car and Jimmy, my character is very coked up

2:07:21.160 --> 2:07:23.520
 at the time and he's hemorrhaging money here and there

2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:25.800
 and making bad bets cause he's getting sloppy.

2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:28.600
 And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets Giants bet

2:07:28.600 --> 2:07:30.240
 or something and I'm like, telling you fucking asshole,

2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:31.600
 don't fucking do it.

2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:33.320
 He's like, yeah, well, the fucking Giants.

2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:36.120
 And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him

2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:39.040
 by the lapels and just smashes his face

2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:41.600
 against the roof of the car.

2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:45.120
 And I say this to Jimmy and he goes,

2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:46.280
 oh yeah, I would have done that.

2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:48.280
 That's not a fucking big deal.

2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:50.080
 I wonder also the interaction.

2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:51.800
 I wonder what the filming of,

2:07:51.800 --> 2:07:56.480
 probably my favorite gambling movie is Casino

2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:59.440
 with Joe Pesci and De Niro.

2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:00.560
 Like when they're out in the desert,

2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:01.480
 you're yelling at each other.

2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:03.320
 I wonder how many takes that is.

2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:07.080
 Like, cause they, I don't know how scripted that is.

2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:08.360
 I mean, it probably is a little bit,

2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:13.080
 but like, I don't think you can script the performance

2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:14.400
 that Joe Pesci does.

2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.080
 Don't make a fuck out of me, Ace.

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:17.040
 Yeah.

2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:19.960
 Like, I fucking brought you here.

2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:24.560
 Yeah, he's just like pointing at that energy

2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:25.720
 and they're standing there.

2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:26.560
 And their friendship.

2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:29.920
 And then De Niro's like that whole thing.

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:33.000
 And then in the pet, yeah, like that energy.

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:33.840
 What is that?

2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:37.120
 I mean, they must, they somehow find it together.

2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:39.080
 You could tell me that that was one take

2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:39.920
 and I'd believe you.

2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:42.280
 You could tell me that that was seven takes

2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:43.120
 and I would believe you.

2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:45.240
 I bet you all the takes had that energy.

2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:46.640
 Like they were playing with it, right?

2:08:46.640 --> 2:08:50.400
 They were playing with that, this, yeah.

2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.400
 I mean, they took on a real personality in those scenes

2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:57.080
 and really carried them forward.

2:08:57.080 --> 2:08:58.920
 I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance.

2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:01.720
 Doesn't get, like comedies, like mob movies

2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:04.040
 probably don't get enough credit either

2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:05.480
 because it's seen as like.

2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:06.800
 Mob movies don't get enough credit?

2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:07.640
 What do you mean?

2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:08.680
 In the Oscars, I mean like that.

2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:09.960
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.320
 Cause it seems like a trope.

2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:12.960
 It's like given a Western,

2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.880
 it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever

2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:17.120
 cause it's like an old Hollywood trope.

2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:19.720
 Yeah, no, I, that scene is so great

2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:20.680
 cause they're never at,

2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:24.240
 they're at the height of their friendship in a way

2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:27.520
 and they're also pretty much about to let go of it

2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:28.640
 and become enemies.

2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.200
 And both things are happening at the same time.

2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:33.720
 And Pesci drives them out to the desert.

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:35.920
 And if I remember correctly,

2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:39.600
 the Nero's character, Ace Rothstein, Rothschild,

2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:43.840
 he says, I gave myself 50 50, whether I'm coming back.

2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:45.240
 Yeah, it's such a good scene.

2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:48.280
 It was a, usually my prospects of coming back

2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:51.520
 from the desert would be 90 to 10 or something like that.

2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:54.160
 But now it was, this time I wasn't sure

2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:56.440
 and there's the car driving really fast.

2:09:56.440 --> 2:09:58.960
 And then Joe Pesci is like, you mother fucker, you,

2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:00.120
 like whatever he was doing.

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:00.960
 Yeah.

2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:02.600
 A Jew, of course it's anti Semitism.

2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:03.600
 Yeah.

2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:07.120
 We're not between friends, who gives a shit?

2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:08.160
 All that kind of stuff.

2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:10.600
 Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances.

2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:12.920
 So yeah, I can understand why you love the art

2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:15.000
 and putting it all out there and leave it.

2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:15.840
 Yeah, it's fun.

2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:16.680
 It's fun.

2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:17.520
 And it's still fun.

2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:19.080
 It's still crazy fun.

2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:22.200
 If I go a while without getting a gig,

2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:27.760
 if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something,

2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:32.360
 I'm like, it's like, oh, I've been thirsty for this.

2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:36.000
 Like I actually am really so happy.

2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:37.920
 Even if it's something where it's like,

2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:42.320
 the things where this was a pain in the ass

2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:44.680
 and that or whatever, you're on the road doing something

2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:46.880
 and anything, whatever, you lost your luggage

2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:48.640
 or whatever the heck you've got going on

2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:52.520
 in your day to day life that everyone brings to work

2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:54.400
 and tries to let go of.

2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:57.360
 Once we're doing the scene, oh man, it's the best.

2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.120
 But that said, you're a great actor,

2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:03.920
 but I just think I speak for a lot of people

2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:06.600
 that you're also, there's a charisma to you

2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:10.200
 that's great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts.

2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:11.280
 Oh, cheers man.

2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:14.680
 In DudeZ, 10 Minute Pod, just as a guest in podcasts,

2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:17.040
 it's always really fun to watch you.

2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:17.880
 Cheers.

2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:19.840
 The way you have fun, the way you think.

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.360
 The raw, the raw will sassle,

2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:25.880
 which is a nice compliment to your kind of acting.

2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:26.960
 That's really sweet.

2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:27.880
 Yeah, cheers.

2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:31.160
 Well, you know, look, you said, you know.

2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:33.200
 You're making that face.

2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:34.040
 I'm making that face.

2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:35.800
 I'm making that after the take face.

2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:38.120
 No, I love doing stuff off the cuff.

2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:39.040
 That's kind of you to say.

2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:42.640
 And I dig, I really do dig doing stuff

2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:43.960
 in front of an audience,

2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:46.480
 because I love seeing,

2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:48.520
 I don't give it to myself very often.

2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:50.400
 If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know,

2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:52.760
 I've done a bunch of multi camera sitcoms and stuff.

2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:55.240
 Mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience.

2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:56.400
 You like that energy?

2:11:56.400 --> 2:11:58.680
 I love it, but I can only hear them.

2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:00.320
 You can't see them because of the lights

2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:02.800
 like it is in a lot of performances.

2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:06.160
 And I would imagine with standup, it's, you know,

2:12:06.160 --> 2:12:08.600
 you see the first couple of rows.

2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:11.840
 I've done, I do this character that does stand up

2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:14.400
 and I used to take him out and do things with him

2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:16.360
 and do little bits here and there.

2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:18.520
 I haven't done it in like four or five years.

2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:21.800
 I think, did Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby?

2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:25.240
 Yeah, but he said, I have to do it as myself too.

2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:26.840
 I think in that podcast, he's like,

2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:29.560
 okay, you're gonna come with me and open for me in Brea,

2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.080
 but you have to do it as yourself.

2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:32.400
 Did that ever happen?

2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:33.240
 It did.

2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:36.960
 And I did the character, you know,

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:39.160
 who's the character I came up with on 10 Minute Podcast.

2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:40.680
 He's just this comedian, right?

2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:42.960
 He calls himself an open mic veteran.

2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.520
 You know, he's been doing open mics forever.

2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:48.000
 And so I did it at opening up for Bobby

2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.840
 and he's like, you have to do some of it as yourself.

2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:52.080
 So I just kind of did this bit

2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.760
 where I would do some of his jokes

2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:56.200
 and then I would take Lee Leon, silly,

2:12:56.200 --> 2:12:59.520
 I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go,

2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:01.520
 and as myself, I start explaining it.

2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:02.840
 Hello, my name is Will.

2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:04.480
 See, the reason that it's funny

2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:08.040
 is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always,

2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:09.320
 he's in these movies

2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:11.160
 and he's got the thick Austrian accent,

2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:13.240
 but he's like, my name is Ben Williams.

2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:15.880
 I'm a cop from Colorado.

2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:17.240
 No, you're not.

2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:19.680
 And it doesn't make sense as the comedian character

2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:21.360
 that I'm doing because that character

2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.040
 doesn't do impersonations.

2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:24.680
 Okay, carrying on.

2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:25.920
 And then I put the wig back on

2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:28.040
 and go back into this dumb thing.

2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:29.840
 And I don't think it was very good,

2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:32.760
 but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him.

2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.040
 He's like, you're not fucking doing it.

2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:36.360
 So I'm not gonna get up on stage and not do,

2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.040
 we agreed, I'll do it.

2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:42.400
 But having been up there just in, you know, whatever,

2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.440
 I've done it like a dozen fucking times or whatever,

2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:45.520
 not a bunch of times, right?

2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:46.360
 Like nothing.

2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:49.600
 And you know, these comedians that go up every night,

2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:51.920
 sometimes two times a night.

2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:54.440
 It's, I do, I will say,

2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:59.120
 I love performing in front of people when I get the chance,

2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:04.120
 but it's a specific thing that I just, I don't know.

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:07.920
 I gotta go back to this.

2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:10.920
 It's like the providing value, you know?

2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:13.280
 I think great standups are fucking incredible.

2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:17.080
 I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watched standup,

2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:19.120
 you know, there's your friend you're going to see,

2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:21.680
 but then there's this other person who really speaks to you.

2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:22.840
 You know what I mean?

2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:27.560
 And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot.

2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:32.560
 Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant

2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.120
 where there's no menu.

2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:38.000
 And it's like, what would you like?

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.240
 There's nothing else like that.

2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:42.440
 There's like, you don't go to like a music place.

2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:43.480
 What do we got here?

2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:45.840
 We got Christian metal and there's some world music

2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:47.520
 and then there's a reggae thing

2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:50.440
 and it's all rammed in together.

2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:52.280
 Or you don't go to a restaurant.

2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:53.400
 I'd love a nice steak.

2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:54.240
 Cool.

2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:55.880
 First, here's a bowl of Froot Loops.

2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:57.960
 And then we got you a crudite.

2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:00.080
 And then this is our sushi tower.

2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:00.920
 Well, what about the steak?

2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:02.120
 Oh, the steak's coming.

2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:03.200
 And then blah, blah, blah.

2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:04.560
 Oh no, the steak got bumped.

2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:05.800
 So there's no steak,

2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.960
 but here's a fucking shitty store bought cheesecake.

2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:08.800
 Yeah.

2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:12.120
 You know, and that's what comedians are up against

2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:13.720
 when they go into a place and it's like,

2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:16.320
 I don't pair well with the poached salmon.

2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:17.520
 You know, I'm chicken fingers.

2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:20.120
 I already am chicken fingers.

2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:23.640
 So, you know, these great comedians that are able to go up

2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:26.320
 on a night where poached salmon goes up

2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:28.880
 and then it's like, fuck, you were also spicy?

2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:30.320
 I got some kick to me.

2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:33.480
 For me, even going to open mics,

2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:36.040
 it could be a wonderful escape.

2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:36.880
 Yeah.

2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.120
 I mean, just laughing together with others.

2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:41.240
 It could make you, I don't know,

2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:42.480
 it just feels really good.

2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:43.760
 Well, and we've done like, you know,

2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:46.080
 like, and I hope to do it with Doodsy,

2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.220
 but like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people.

2:15:50.220 --> 2:15:52.020
 And you know, you talk to them afterwards

2:15:52.020 --> 2:15:54.880
 and take some pictures and man, they are,

2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:57.520
 they forgot what the fuck they got going on.

2:15:57.520 --> 2:15:59.680
 And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day.

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.880
 It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know?

2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:03.480
 No, it's a lot of value.

2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:07.240
 I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit.

2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:09.240
 What's the meaning of life with Sasa?

2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:12.200
 What is the meaning of life?

2:16:12.200 --> 2:16:13.040
 Why are we here?

2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:14.800
 Why, why, why?

2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:16.880
 Was it the meaning of life?

2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:18.280
 Wasn't, didn't they explain it

2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:19.360
 at the end of meaning of life?

2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:21.440
 I think it was Michael Palin that said,

2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:24.400
 try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors,

2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:25.440
 eat enough fiber.

2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:26.280
 Wasn't that the?

2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:27.920
 Fiber? Fiber is part of it?

2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:29.600
 Yeah, I think it's, I think it's just,

2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:31.520
 have a bowl of bran in the morning

2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:33.440
 and don't take yourself too seriously.

2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:36.000
 Yeah.

2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000
 No, well, no one gets out alive, I think is the.

2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:39.600
 Herman Hesse, one of my favorite writers,

2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:40.920
 he's a Nobel Prize winner,

2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:44.920
 in a book called Steppenwolf,

2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:47.160
 says, learn what is to be taken seriously

2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:48.720
 and laugh at the rest.

2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:49.800
 Oh, that's awesome.

2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:51.840
 What's the percentage distribution on that?

2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:54.400
 So how much of life should you take seriously?

2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:57.520
 And then how much do you just laugh at?

2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:00.600
 Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you're winning.

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:01.440
 Yeah.

2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:03.160
 But that's almost impossible.

2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:04.400
 I think that there's,

2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:09.360
 and also could be quite irresponsible to do that.

2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:13.640
 I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously.

2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:14.480
 I know that.

2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:17.360
 I do, I do, I really do.

2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:19.520
 People will be in part surprised by that,

2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:21.440
 but I think that radiates from you.

2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:22.280
 Really?

2:17:22.280 --> 2:17:23.120
 Yeah, I do, I do.

2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:25.720
 I take things way too fucking seriously sometimes.

2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:29.800
 But, yeah, they're gonna loosen the neck up.

2:17:29.800 --> 2:17:32.960
 But no, I think that's really good.

2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:34.840
 That's really good stuff.

2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:37.600
 I don't know what the percentage is to have a good life

2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:42.600
 or a happy, healthy life, but you know,

2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:46.600
 for me, the meaning of life is getting to live it

2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:48.320
 as long as you hope to.

2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:53.320
 That's nice, and when you lose someone

2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:57.360
 or if perhaps you're faced with your own mortality,

2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.440
 I think that puts that into perspective.

2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:04.120
 But, you know.

2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:05.600
 Get lots of fiber.

2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:09.640
 Get lots of fiber, be nice to everybody,

2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.960
 and yeah, don't take things too seriously is a good one.

2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:18.960
 Our minds are fucking big weird shitty fucking bucket of shit

2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:24.640
 that's trying to get you to think horrible shit

2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:26.080
 about yourself all the time.

2:18:26.080 --> 2:18:27.320
 Yeah, shitty bucket of shit.

2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:28.160
 Shitty bucket of shit.

2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:29.640
 I think there's a book I never read,

2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:32.160
 but I read the title, and it's Good Words to Live By,

2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:35.240
 which is don't sweat the small stuff,

2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:37.680
 and it's all small stuff.

2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:38.840
 That's another way.

2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:39.960
 Was that Dr. Phil?

2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:41.440
 Wasn't Dr. Phil what's?

2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:42.280
 I don't know.

2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:46.280
 But I think the conclusion also has fiber as part of it.

2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:48.360
 I think that all ties it together,

2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:50.680
 and in the end, of course,

2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:53.360
 just put love out there in the world.

2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:56.160
 I think that's a pretty good way to go.

2:18:56.160 --> 2:18:58.480
 What would you say is the meaning of life?

2:18:58.480 --> 2:18:59.880
 Put love out in the world?

2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:00.840
 I would say love, yeah.

2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:02.200
 Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

2:19:02.200 --> 2:19:05.720
 It's a long conversation on what that really means,

2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:08.360
 but I'm sure robots are involved, yeah.

2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:11.320
 Well, let me tell you, I feel a little safer knowing

2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:16.320
 that someone who has a hand in bringing these robots

2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:19.280
 to the masses, as you do,

2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:22.400
 has that opinion of love and how important it is.

2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:25.120
 I think that's great, because otherwise,

2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:27.560
 it's gonna be that fucking scene from T2

2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:31.720
 where Linda Hamilton's holding onto the fence

2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:35.200
 and getting all of her flesh blown off of her skeleton

2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:37.560
 before the rest of her is wiped away,

2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:39.440
 because this Skynet shit.

2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:41.360
 Anyway, I'm just terrified of dudesie all the time.

2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:42.840
 That's why I think that they will.

2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:45.760
 Dudesie in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage.

2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:49.240
 That's why Chad and I need to do our best to control it.

2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:53.480
 You need to travel back in time and murder Chad, I think.

2:19:53.480 --> 2:19:55.000
 Yeah, that's, yeah.

2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:56.120
 That's the only way.

2:19:56.120 --> 2:19:57.080
 It's been said.

2:19:57.080 --> 2:19:58.880
 I don't know why you need to travel back in time,

2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:02.280
 but you could murder him today,

2:20:02.280 --> 2:20:04.120
 but I think he'll be very suspicious.

2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:08.240
 My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow

2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:10.280
 and planning for yesterday, and then,

2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:12.280
 and hopefully dudesie will give me the answer there

2:20:12.280 --> 2:20:15.760
 with what it is to do with Chad's frozen body.

2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:18.840
 If I got to drive it out to, if I got to take my,

2:20:18.840 --> 2:20:20.480
 you know, if I got to get ahold of it,

2:20:20.480 --> 2:20:23.320
 like one of those Tesla mom vans

2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:27.240
 and shove my garage freezer in it and plug it in

2:20:27.240 --> 2:20:29.840
 and shove Chad in there, drive out to Arizona

2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:31.160
 and deliver him under a mountain

2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:33.320
 or wherever the fuck this place is,

2:20:33.320 --> 2:20:36.280
 and say, here's this dog tag, what does this get me?

2:20:36.280 --> 2:20:38.920
 And then I'm like, ah, it's gonna be 300 bucks.

2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:40.440
 Do you have a, do you take Amex?

2:20:40.440 --> 2:20:41.280
 No.

2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:43.360
 And I'm gonna be like, ah, shit.

2:20:43.360 --> 2:20:47.040
 And then I'll just dump him somewhere, breaking bad stuff.

2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:50.560
 Well, I would like to thank you and the, what is it?

2:20:50.560 --> 2:20:55.040
 The Canadian International Agency Apparel.

2:20:55.040 --> 2:20:56.560
 Canadian International Apparel.

2:20:56.560 --> 2:20:59.720
 I can't wait for the sneakers from dudesie.

2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:03.520
 I can't wait for all the, all the podcasts

2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:07.600
 that AI can, and all the trouble it can get you in.

2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:09.120
 So I'm a huge fan of yours.

2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:11.360
 It's a huge honor that you would talk with me today.

2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:13.160
 Well, this has been amazing.

2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:14.000
 Cheers, pal.

2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:15.800
 Likewise, and I'm happy to be here, man.

2:21:15.800 --> 2:21:16.840
 Cheers.

2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:17.920
 Bam.

2:21:17.920 --> 2:21:19.480
 Oh, that was four, dude.

2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:21.080
 Holy fuck, what?

2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:24.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Will Sasso.

2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:26.000
 To support this podcast,

2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.840
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:32.400
 And now, let me leave you with some words from John Candy,

2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:34.400
 one of Will's favorite actors.

2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:39.880
 I think I may have become an actor to hide from myself.

2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:42.120
 You can escape into a character.

2:21:42.120 --> 2:22:02.120
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
