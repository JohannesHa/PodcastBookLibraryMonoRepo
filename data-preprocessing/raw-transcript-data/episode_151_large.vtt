00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
 The following is a conversation with Dan Kokotov, VP of engineering at rev.ai,

00:06.000 --> 00:11.520
 which is by many metrics, the best speech to text AI engine in the world.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.320
 Rev in general is a company that does captioning and transcription

00:16.320 --> 00:19.160
 of audio by humans and by AI.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.480
 I've been using their services for a couple of years now and I'm planning

00:23.480 --> 00:28.000
 to use Rev to add both captions and transcripts to some of the previous

00:28.000 --> 00:32.480
 and future episodes of this podcast to make it easier for people to read

00:32.480 --> 00:36.800
 through the conversation or reference various parts of the episode, since

00:36.800 --> 00:39.120
 that's something that quite a few people requested.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.800
 I'll probably do a separate video on that with links on the podcast website

00:45.440 --> 00:48.000
 so people can provide suggestions and improvements there.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.840
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens, All in One Nutrition Drink,

00:52.840 --> 00:58.960
 Blinkist app that summarizes books, Business Wars podcast, and Cash App.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.360
 So the choice is health, wisdom, or money.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.880
 Choose wisely my friends, and if you wish, click the sponsor links

01:06.880 --> 01:09.640
 below to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.080
 As a side note, let me say that I reached out to Dan and the Rev

01:13.080 --> 01:17.880
 team for a conversation because I've been using and genuinely loving

01:18.120 --> 01:21.320
 their service and really curious about how it works.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.840
 I previously talked to the head of Adobe research for the same reason.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.040
 For me, there's a bunch of products, usually software, that comes along

01:30.040 --> 01:31.640
 and just makes my life way easier.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.200
 Examples are Adobe Premiere for video editing, iZotope RX for cleaning up audio,

01:37.480 --> 01:43.680
 AutoHotKey on Windows for automating keyboard and mouse tasks, Emacs as an

01:43.680 --> 01:46.520
 IDE for everything, including the universe itself.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
 I can keep on going, but you get the idea.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.240
 I just like talking to people who create things I'm a big fan of.

01:52.760 --> 01:58.800
 That said, after doing this conversation, the folks at Rev.ai offered to sponsor

01:58.800 --> 02:00.320
 this podcast in the coming months.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.240
 This conversation is not sponsored by the guest.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.640
 It probably goes without saying, but I should say it anyway, that you

02:08.640 --> 02:11.280
 can not buy your way onto this podcast.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.000
 I don't know why you would want to.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.480
 I wanted to bring this up to make a specific point that no sponsor

02:17.480 --> 02:21.240
 will ever influence what I do on this podcast, or to the best of

02:21.240 --> 02:22.960
 my ability, influence what I think.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.400
 I wasn't really thinking about this.

02:25.480 --> 02:30.520
 For example, when I interviewed Jack Dorsey, who is the CEO of Square that

02:30.520 --> 02:34.720
 happens to be sponsoring this podcast, but I should really make it explicit.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.520
 I will never take money for bringing a guest on.

02:37.920 --> 02:43.200
 Every guest on this podcast is someone I genuinely am curious to talk to or just

02:43.240 --> 02:45.440
 genuinely love something they've created.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.360
 As I sometimes get criticized for, I'm just a fan of people.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.760
 And that's who I talk to.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.640
 As I also talk about way too much, money is really never a consideration.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.600
 In general, no amount of money can buy my integrity.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.880
 That's true for this podcast, and that's true for anything else I do.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.560

03:18.280 --> 03:21.880
 And now here's my conversation with Dan Kokotov.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.000
 You mentioned science fiction on the phone.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.040
 So let's go with the ridiculous first.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.680
 What's the greatest sci fi novel of all time in your view?

03:32.360 --> 03:37.560
 And maybe what ideas do you find philosophically fascinating about it?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.960
 The greatest sci fi novel of all time is Dune.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.880
 And the second greatest is The Children of Dune.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.080
 And the third greatest is The God Emperor of Dune.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.120
 So I'm a huge fan of the whole series.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.400
 I mean, it's just an incredible world that he created.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.360
 And I don't know if you've read the book or not.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.280
 No, I have not.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.520
 It's one of my biggest regrets, especially because a new movie is coming out.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.880
 Everyone's super excited about it.

04:02.920 --> 04:07.600
 I used to, it's ridiculous to say, and sorry to interrupt, is that I

04:07.600 --> 04:09.600
 used to play the video game.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.800
 It used to be Dune.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.680
 I guess you would call that real time strategy.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.080
 Right.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.200
 I think I remember that game.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.400
 Yeah, it was kind of awesome.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
 Nineties or something.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.440
 I think I played it actually when I was in Russia.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.200
 I definitely remember it.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.880
 I was not in Russia anymore.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.800
 I think at the time that I used to live in Russia, I think video games

04:26.800 --> 04:29.080
 were about like the suspicion of Pong.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.240
 I think Pong was pretty much like the greatest game I ever got to play in Russia,

04:33.280 --> 04:35.200
 which was still a privilege right in that age.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.480
 So you didn't get color?

04:36.520 --> 04:39.120
 You didn't get like, uh, so I left Russia.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.840
 I left Russia in 1991, right?

04:40.840 --> 04:41.680
 Okay.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.160
 So I was one of the few lucky kids because my mom was a programmer.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.120
 So I would go to her work, right?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.880
 I would take the, the Metro.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.160
 I've got our work and play like on, I guess the equivalent of like a

04:52.160 --> 04:56.120
 286 PC, you know, nice floppy disks.

04:56.160 --> 04:56.600
 Yes.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.280
 So, okay.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.440
 Put back to doing what you get back to doing.

04:59.960 --> 05:04.200
 And by the way, the new movie I'm pretty interested in, but the

05:04.200 --> 05:06.480
 skeptical, I'm a little skeptical.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.200
 I'm a little skeptical.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.120
 I saw the trailer.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.280
 Uh, I don't know.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.680
 So there's, there's a David Lynch movie doing as you may know, I'm

05:12.680 --> 05:14.120
 a huge David Lynch fan, by the way.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.200
 So the movie is somewhat controversial, but it's a little confusing, but it

05:20.200 --> 05:24.600
 captures kind of the mood of the book better than I would say like most any

05:24.600 --> 05:28.240
 adaptation and like doing so much about kind of mood and the world, right.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.920
 But back to the philosophical point.

05:29.920 --> 05:36.400
 So in the fourth book, God, emperor of doing, there's a sort of setting where

05:36.400 --> 05:41.120
 Leto, one of the characters, he's become this weird sort of God emperor.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.720
 He's turned into a gigantic worm.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.800
 I mean, you kind of have to read the book to understand what that means.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.120
 So the worms are involved, the worms are involved.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.760
 You probably saw the worms in the trailer, right.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.200
 And in the video, you kind of like merges with the swarm, um, and becomes

05:53.200 --> 05:56.640
 this tyrant of the world and like oppresses the people for a long time.

05:56.640 --> 05:56.840
 Right.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.640
 But he has a purpose and the purpose is to kind of, uh, break through kind of

06:01.640 --> 06:03.760
 a stagnation period in civilization.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.120
 Right.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.040
 Um, but people have gotten too comfortable, right.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.720
 And so you kind of oppresses them so that they explode and like go on to

06:11.720 --> 06:15.720
 colonize new worlds and kind of renew the forward momentum of humanity.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.040
 Right.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.520
 And so to me, that's kind of fascinating, right.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.640
 You need a little bit of pressure and suffering, right.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.520
 To kind of like make progress, not, not, not get too comfortable.

06:28.120 --> 06:33.120
 Maybe that's a bit of a cruel philosophy to take away, but that seems to be

06:33.120 --> 06:38.320
 the case, unfortunately, obviously, I'm a huge fan of, uh, suffering.

06:39.040 --> 06:46.360
 So one of the reasons we're talking today is that a bunch of people requested

06:46.360 --> 06:51.000
 that I do transcripts for this podcast and do captioning.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.240
 I used to make all kinds of YouTube videos and I would go on up work, I

06:56.240 --> 07:01.440
 think, and I would hire folks to do transcription and it was always a pain

07:01.440 --> 07:06.360
 in the ass, if I'm being honest, and then I don't know how I discovered Rev.

07:07.400 --> 07:13.960
 But when I did, it was this feeling of like, Holy shit, somebody figured

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
 out how to do it just really easily.

07:16.760 --> 07:25.400
 I I'm, I'm such a fan of just when people take a problem and they just make it easy.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.000
 Right.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.280
 You know, like just, uh, there's so many, uh, there's so many,

07:31.280 --> 07:35.240
 it's like, there's so many things in life that you might not even

07:35.240 --> 07:37.000
 be aware of that are painful.

07:37.720 --> 07:43.320
 Then Rev, you just like give the audio, give the video, you can

07:43.320 --> 07:44.800
 actually give a YouTube link.

07:45.920 --> 07:52.320
 And then it comes back like a day later or, uh, two days later, whatever

07:52.320 --> 07:56.280
 the hell it is with the captions, you know, all in a standardized format.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.280
 It was, I dunno, it was, it was, it was, it was truly a joy.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.720
 So I thought I had, you know, just for the hell of it, uh, talk to you

08:04.920 --> 08:07.960
 that one other product just made my soul feel good.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.280
 One other product that I've used like that is, uh, for people who might

08:12.280 --> 08:15.800
 be familiar is called isotope RX.

08:15.840 --> 08:21.000
 It's for audio editing and like, and that's another one where it was

08:21.000 --> 08:23.720
 like, you just drop it.

08:24.080 --> 08:28.240
 I dropped into the audio and it just cleans everything up really nicely.

08:28.240 --> 08:35.200
 All the stupid, like the mouth sounds and sometimes there's a background

08:35.400 --> 08:39.000
 like sounds due to the malfunction of the equipment.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.040
 It can clean that stuff up.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.040
 It can, it has a general voice denoising.

08:43.040 --> 08:47.400
 It has like automation capabilities where you can do batch processing

08:47.400 --> 08:49.200
 and you can put a bunch of effects.

08:49.600 --> 08:55.440
 I mean, it just, I dunno, everything else sucked for like voice based

08:55.480 --> 08:57.800
 cleanup that I've ever used.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.120
 They've used audition, Adobe audition, and he's all kinds of other things

09:01.120 --> 09:04.480
 with plugins and you have to kind of figure it all out.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.840
 You have to do it manually here.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.160
 It's just, it just worked.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.640
 So that's another one in this whole pipeline.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.640
 It just brought joy to my, to my heart.

09:12.640 --> 09:18.760
 Anyway, all that to say is, uh, uh, Rev put a smile to my face.

09:18.760 --> 09:24.040
 So can you maybe take a step back and say, what is Rev and how does it work?

09:24.560 --> 09:26.040
 And Rev or Rev.com?

09:26.040 --> 09:31.240
 Rev, Rev.com, the same thing, I guess, uh, that way we do have Rev.ai now as

09:31.240 --> 09:33.440
 well, which we can talk about later.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.160
 Like, do you have the actual domain or is it just, uh, the actual domain,

09:37.160 --> 09:40.800
 but we also use it kind of as a, as a sub brand.

09:41.120 --> 09:46.040
 Oh, so we've, so we use Rev.ai to denote our ASR services, right?

09:46.040 --> 09:49.640
 And Rev.com is kind of our more human and to the end user services.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.400
 So it's like wordpress.com and wordpress.org, they actually have separate

09:53.400 --> 09:56.640
 brands that like, I don't know if you're familiar with what those are.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.360
 Yeah, they provide almost like a separate branch of a little bit.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.080
 I think with that, it's like wordpress.org is kind of their open source, right?

10:04.080 --> 10:07.520
 And, uh, wordpress.com is sort of their hosted commercial offering.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.100
 Yes.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.200
 Um, and with us, the differential is a little bit different,

10:10.200 --> 10:11.680
 but maybe a similar idea.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.220
 Yep.

10:12.800 --> 10:12.960
 Okay.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.680
 So what is Rev?

10:13.760 --> 10:16.360
 Before I launch into, uh, what is Rev?

10:16.360 --> 10:18.040
 I was going to say, you know, like you, you were talking about like

10:18.080 --> 10:21.840
 Rev was music to your ears, your, your, your field was music to my ears.

10:21.840 --> 10:27.720
 To us, the founders of Rev, because, um, Rev was kind of founded to improve

10:27.720 --> 10:32.360
 on the model of Upwork that was kind of the original, um, or part of their

10:32.600 --> 10:38.160
 original impetus, like our CEO, Jason, was a early employee of Upwork.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.920
 So he was very familiar with their work, the company Upwork company.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.360
 Um, and so he was very familiar with that model and he wanted to make the whole

10:46.360 --> 10:49.600
 experience better because he knew like, when you go at that time, Upwork was

10:49.600 --> 10:54.040
 primarily programmers, so the main thing they offered us, if you want to hire,

10:54.040 --> 10:56.560
 you know, someone to help you code a little site, right.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.280
 Um, you could go on Upwork, um, you could like browse through a list of freelancers,

11:01.480 --> 11:04.720
 pick a programmer, you know, have a contract with them and have them do some

11:04.720 --> 11:11.360
 work, but it was kind of a difficult experience because, uh, for the, for you,

11:11.400 --> 11:13.600
 you would kind of have to browse through all these people, right.

11:13.600 --> 11:18.040
 And you have to decide, okay, like, well, is this guy good as, um, or somebody

11:18.040 --> 11:21.520
 else better and naturally, you know, you're going to Upwork because you're not

11:21.520 --> 11:22.360
 an expert, right?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.640
 If you're an expert, you probably wouldn't be like getting a programmer

11:24.640 --> 11:27.280
 from Upwork, uh, so, so how can you really tell?

11:27.840 --> 11:31.160
 So there's a kind of like a lot of potential regret, right?

11:31.160 --> 11:34.240
 What if I choose a bad person, they're like, going to be late on the work.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.720
 It's going to be a painful experience.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.920
 And for the freelancer, it was also painful because, you know, half the time

11:39.920 --> 11:43.640
 they spent not on actually doing the work, but kind of figuring out how can I make

11:43.640 --> 11:47.520
 my profile most attractive to the buyer, right?

11:47.560 --> 11:48.680
 And they're not an expert on that either.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.560
 So like Grav's idea was let's remove the barrier, right?

11:52.560 --> 11:56.120
 Like, let's make it simple where we'll pick a few, uh, verticals

11:56.600 --> 11:58.280
 that are fairly standardizable.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.760
 Now we actually started with translation, um, and then we added

12:01.760 --> 12:05.200
 audio transcription a bit later and we'll just make it a website.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.680
 You go give us your files.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.880
 We'll give you back, uh, the results, you know, as soon as possible.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.800
 You know, originally maybe it was 48 hours.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.600
 Then we made it shorter and shorter and shorter.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.880
 Um, yeah, there's a rush processing too.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.920
 There's a rush processing now, uh, and, uh, we'll hide all the details from you.

12:22.920 --> 12:23.160
 Right.

12:23.520 --> 12:23.800
 Yeah.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.000
 And like, that's kind of exactly what you're experiencing, right?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.760
 You don't, you don't need to worry about the details of how the sausage is made.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.480
 That's really cool.

12:30.480 --> 12:35.160
 The, so you picked like a vertical by vertically, you mean basically a

12:35.160 --> 12:36.760
 service, a service category.

12:36.760 --> 12:41.600
 Why translation is Rev thinking of potentially going into other verticals

12:41.600 --> 12:46.280
 in the future, or is this like the focus now is a translation transcription, like

12:46.280 --> 12:52.200
 language, the focus now is, is language or, uh, speech services, generally speech

12:52.200 --> 12:55.520
 to text language services, you can kind of group them however you want.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.960
 Um, so, but we, uh, originally the categorization was work from home.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.280
 So when, uh, work that was done by people on a computer, you know, we weren't trying

13:06.280 --> 13:11.720
 to get into, you know, uh, task rabbit type of things and something that could

13:11.720 --> 13:14.080
 be relatively standard, not a lot of options.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.560
 So we could kind of present the simplified interface, right?

13:16.800 --> 13:20.240
 So programming wasn't like a good fit because each programming

13:20.240 --> 13:21.640
 project is kind of unique, right?

13:21.640 --> 13:25.920
 We're looking for something that, uh, Transcription is, you know, you have five

13:25.920 --> 13:27.640
 hours of idea, it's five hours of audio, right?

13:27.680 --> 13:29.200
 Translation is somewhat similar.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.600
 In that, you know, you can have a five page document, you know, and then you

13:33.600 --> 13:37.480
 just can price it by that and then you pick the language you want and that

13:37.480 --> 13:38.920
 that's mostly all that is to it.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.760
 So those were a few criteria.

13:40.760 --> 13:48.880
 We started with translation because we saw the need, um, and, uh, we picked up

13:48.880 --> 13:52.800
 kind of a specialty of translation, um, where we would translate things like

13:52.800 --> 13:58.440
 board certificates, uh, uh, immigration documents, things like that.

13:58.480 --> 14:03.640
 And so they were fairly, um, even more well defined and easy to

14:03.640 --> 14:04.960
 kind of tell if we did a good job.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.320
 So you can literally charge per type of document.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.920
 Was that, was, was that the, so what, what is it now?

14:10.960 --> 14:12.600
 Is it per word or something like that?

14:12.600 --> 14:16.240
 Like, how do you, like, how do you measure the effort

14:16.280 --> 14:18.000
 involved in a particular thing?

14:18.320 --> 14:21.080
 So now it looks like for audio translation, it's like,

14:21.080 --> 14:23.400
 so now it looks a for audio transcription, right?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.640
 It's a per audio minute.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.960
 Well, that, that yes, for, for, for our translation, we don't really,

14:28.120 --> 14:29.920
 uh, actually focus it on anymore.

14:30.240 --> 14:34.920
 Uh, but you know, back when it was still a main business of Revit was per page,

14:35.000 --> 14:35.240
 right.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.600
 Or per word, depending on the kind of, uh, cause you can also do translation

14:38.600 --> 14:40.040
 now on the audio, right?

14:40.600 --> 14:40.880
 Mm hmm.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.920
 So like subtitles.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.040
 So it would be both, uh, transcription and translation.

14:45.040 --> 14:45.360
 That's right.

14:45.560 --> 14:50.280
 I wanted to test the system to see how good it is to see like how, how, uh,

14:50.280 --> 14:51.720
 well, is Russian supported?

14:52.680 --> 14:53.200
 I think so.

14:53.240 --> 14:53.600
 Yeah.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.560
 And it'd be interesting to try it out.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.080
 I mean, one of the, now it's only in like the one direction, right?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.760
 So you start with English and then you can have subtitles in Russian.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.320
 Not really, not really the other way.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.200
 Got it.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.480
 Because it's, um, I'm deeply curious about this.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.840
 Um, when COVID opens up a little bit, when the economy, when the

15:08.840 --> 15:12.120
 world opens up a little bit, you want to build your brand in Russia?

15:12.720 --> 15:13.640
 No, I don't.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.720
 First of all, I'm allergic to the word brand.

15:15.720 --> 15:21.720
 All right, I'm definitely not building, uh, any brands in Russia, but I'm going to

15:21.720 --> 15:26.880
 Paris to talk to the translators of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, there's this

15:26.880 --> 15:28.880
 famous couple that does translation.

15:29.600 --> 15:35.120
 And, you know, I'm more and more thinking of how is it possible to have a

15:35.120 --> 15:37.320
 conversation with a Russian speaker?

15:37.640 --> 15:42.640
 Cause I have just some number of famous Russian speakers that

15:42.640 --> 15:47.560
 I'm interested in talking to, and my Russian is not strong

15:47.560 --> 15:49.720
 enough to be witty and funny.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.520
 I'm already an idiot in English.

15:51.920 --> 15:57.360
 I'm an extra level of like awkward idiot in Russian, but I can understand it.

15:57.600 --> 15:57.880
 Right.

15:58.200 --> 16:04.480
 And I also like wonder how can I create a compelling English Russian

16:04.480 --> 16:06.480
 experience for an English speaker?

16:06.480 --> 16:11.640
 Like if I, there's a guy named Grigori Perlman, who's a mathematician who,

16:11.640 --> 16:13.560
 uh, obviously doesn't speak any English.

16:14.480 --> 16:20.680
 So I would probably incorporate like a Russian translator into the picture.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.320
 And then it would be like a, not to use a weird term, but like a three, like a

16:25.320 --> 16:32.640
 three, three person thing where it's like a dance of, like, I understand it one way.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.680
 They don't understand the other way, but I'll be asking questions in English.

16:38.200 --> 16:38.640
 I don't know.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.800
 I don't know the right way.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.400
 It's complicated.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.640
 It's complicated, but I feel like it's worth the effort for certain kinds of

16:43.920 --> 16:48.880
 people, one of whom I'm confident of Vladimir Putin, I'm for sure talking to.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.120
 I really want to make it happen.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.240
 Cause I think I could do a good job with, but the, the right, you know,

16:54.240 --> 16:58.000
 understanding the fundamentals of translation is something I'm really

16:58.000 --> 16:58.640
 interested in.

16:58.920 --> 17:03.920
 So that's why I'm starting with, um, the actual translators of like Russian

17:03.920 --> 17:06.640
 literature, because they understand the nuance and the beauty of the

17:06.640 --> 17:08.880
 language and how it goes back and forth.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.240
 But I also want to see, like in speech, how can we do it in real time?

17:13.240 --> 17:18.120
 So that's, that's like a little bit of a baby project that I hope to push forward.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.920
 But anyway, it's a challenging thing.

17:19.920 --> 17:25.840
 So just to share, uh, my dad, um, actually does translation, um, not, not

17:25.840 --> 17:27.800
 professional, he's a, uh, he writes poetry.

17:28.160 --> 17:33.480
 That was kind of always his, uh, not a hobby, but he's, uh, he, you know, he

17:33.480 --> 17:36.840
 had a job, like a day job, but his passion was always writing poetry.

17:36.840 --> 17:43.080
 Uh, and then when I got to America, like he started also translating, um, first

17:43.080 --> 17:45.120
 he was translating English poetry to Russia.

17:45.120 --> 17:50.400
 Now he also like goes the other, uh, the other way, you kind of gain some small

17:50.400 --> 17:54.840
 fame in that world anyways, because, uh, recently this poet like Lewis

17:54.840 --> 17:59.080
 clock, I don't know if you know of, uh, some American poet, um, she was

17:59.080 --> 18:00.760
 awarded the Nobel prize for literature.

18:01.240 --> 18:05.840
 Uh, and so my dad had translated, uh, one of her books of poetry in

18:05.840 --> 18:07.640
 to Russian, and he was like one of the few.

18:07.640 --> 18:12.080
 So he kind of like, they asked him and gave an interview to Radiosvoboda,

18:12.160 --> 18:13.000
 if you know what that is.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
 And he kind of talked about some of the intricacies of translating poetry.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.640
 So that's like an extra level of difficulty, right?

18:18.640 --> 18:21.520
 Because translating poetry is even more challenging than

18:21.600 --> 18:24.000
 translating just, you know, interviews.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.560
 Do you remember any, any experiences and challenges to having to do the

18:28.560 --> 18:32.640
 translation that, that's the God to you, like something he's talked about?

18:32.640 --> 18:35.400
 I mean, a lot of it, I think is word choice, right?

18:35.400 --> 18:38.120
 It's the way Russian is structured is first of all, quite different

18:38.160 --> 18:40.200
 than, um, the way English is structured, right?

18:40.200 --> 18:43.840
 Just there is inflections in Russian and genders, and they don't exist in English.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.760
 That's just one of the reasons actually why, um, machine translation is quite

18:47.760 --> 18:50.840
 difficult for English to Russian and Russian to English, because there's

18:50.840 --> 18:54.560
 such different languages, but then English has like a huge number of words.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.040
 Um, many more than Russian, actually, I think.

18:57.040 --> 19:01.400
 So it's often difficult to find the right word to convey the same emotional

19:01.400 --> 19:03.440
 meaning, yeah, Russian language.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.880
 They play with words much more.

19:06.240 --> 19:12.080
 So you, you're mentioning that, uh, Rev was kind of born out of, um, trying to

19:12.080 --> 19:15.760
 take a vertical on the upwork and then standardize it.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.960
 So we're just trying to make the, the freelancer marketplace idea better, right?

19:21.000 --> 19:26.400
 Um, better for both customers and better for the freelancers themselves.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.840
 Is there something else to the story of Rev finding the right word?

19:30.840 --> 19:35.320
 Rev, finding Rev, like what, what did it take to bring it to actually to life?

19:35.720 --> 19:37.000
 Was there any pain points?

19:37.200 --> 19:39.840
 Um, plenty of, plenty of pain points.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.840
 I mean, uh, as, as often the case it's with scaling it up, right?

19:43.920 --> 19:47.400
 Um, and in this case, you know, the scaling is kind of scaling the,

19:48.080 --> 19:49.280
 the marketplace, so to speak, right?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.600
 Rev is essentially a two sided marketplace, right?

19:51.600 --> 19:54.920
 Because, you know, there's the customers and then there's the reverse.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.000
 Um, if there's not enough Revers, Revers are world color freelancers.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.400
 So if there's not enough Revers, then customers have a bad experience, right?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.680
 You know, it takes longer to get your work done.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.800
 Um, things like that, you know, if there's too many done, the Revers have

20:09.800 --> 20:12.880
 a bad experience because they might log on to see like what work is available

20:12.880 --> 20:14.640
 and there's not very much work, right?

20:15.040 --> 20:20.000
 Uh, so kind of keeping that balance, um, is, is, is a quite challenging problem.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.920
 And, you know, that's, that's like a problem we've been working on for many

20:22.920 --> 20:25.360
 years and we're still like refining our methods, right?

20:25.360 --> 20:30.240
 If you can kind of talk to this gig economy idea, I did a bunch of different

20:30.240 --> 20:33.680
 psychology experiments on mechanical Turk, for example, I've asked to do

20:33.680 --> 20:37.960
 different kinds of very tricky computer vision annotation on mechanical Turk.

20:37.960 --> 20:42.760
 And it's connecting, connecting people in a more systematized way.

20:43.560 --> 20:50.680
 I would say, you know, between task and, and, uh, what would you call that worker

20:50.760 --> 20:52.200
 is what mechanical Turk calls it.

20:52.200 --> 20:58.240
 What do you think about this world of gig economies, of there being a service

20:58.400 --> 21:06.280
 that connects customers to workers in a way that's like massively distributed,

21:06.320 --> 21:10.080
 like potentially scaling to, it could be, it could be scaled to like

21:10.080 --> 21:11.800
 tens of thousands of people, right?

21:11.800 --> 21:16.200
 Is there something interesting about that world that you can speak to?

21:16.520 --> 21:16.840
 Yeah.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.640
 Well, we don't think of it as kind of gig economy, like to some degree,

21:20.640 --> 21:22.440
 I don't like the word gig that much, right?

21:22.440 --> 21:25.960
 Because to some degree it diminishes the words being done, right?

21:25.960 --> 21:28.080
 It sounds kind of like almost amateurish.

21:28.080 --> 21:33.760
 Well, maybe in like music industry, like gig is a standard term, but in work, it

21:33.760 --> 21:41.400
 kind of sounds like, oh, it's, it's, it's frivolous, um, to us it's, um, improving

21:41.400 --> 21:46.160
 the nature of working from home on your own time and on your own terms, right?

21:46.160 --> 21:51.360
 And kind of taking away geographical limitations and time limitations, right?

21:51.360 --> 21:56.960
 Uh, so, you know, many of our freelancers are maybe work from home moms, right?

21:56.960 --> 22:01.160
 And, you know, they don't want the traditional nine to five job, but they

22:01.160 --> 22:05.080
 want to make some income and rough kind of like allows them to do that and decide

22:05.080 --> 22:10.920
 like exactly how much to work and when to work or by the same token, maybe someone

22:10.920 --> 22:17.000
 is, you know, someone wants to live the mountain top, you know, life, right?

22:17.040 --> 22:19.680
 You know, cabin in the woods, but they still want to make some money.

22:20.160 --> 22:24.680
 Um, and like generally that wouldn't be compatible before, before this new world,

22:25.160 --> 22:28.760
 you kind of had to choose, uh, but like with Rev, like, if you like, you don't

22:28.760 --> 22:36.120
 have to choose, can you speak to like, what's the demographics like distribution?

22:36.360 --> 22:38.080
 Like where do rivers live?

22:38.880 --> 22:40.760
 Is there a way to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,

22:40.760 --> 22:46.720
 to, to, to, but you really want to teach it how to, how to run, how to track

22:46.720 --> 22:50.160
 Once you're out of the bush, 들어가, things like that, you know,

22:50.160 --> 23:02.220
 but like in the back of you know, like hard, but you

23:02.220 --> 23:05.400
 just as you approach, there's a lot more control over you.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.160
 Like you, you may be Oh, like you know, one day you might go to the

23:08.160 --> 23:10.400
 For some years now, we've been doing these little meetings

23:10.400 --> 23:12.280
 where the management team will go to some place

23:12.280 --> 23:13.640
 and we'll try to meet Revers.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.980
 And pretty much wherever we go, it's

23:15.980 --> 23:19.520
 pretty easy to find a large number of Revers.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.160
 The most recent one we did is in Utah.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.240
 But anyway, really.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.680
 Are they from all walks of life?

23:26.680 --> 23:28.800
 Are these young folks, older folks?

23:28.800 --> 23:30.220
 Yeah, all walks of life, really.

23:30.220 --> 23:33.760
 Like I said, one category is the work from home.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.040
 Students who want to make some extra income.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.880
 There are some people who maybe have some social anxiety,

23:41.880 --> 23:43.420
 so they don't want to be in the office.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.380
 And this is one way for them to make a living.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.360
 So it's really pretty wide variety.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.040
 But on the flip side, for example,

23:49.040 --> 23:52.840
 one Rever we were talking to was a person

23:52.840 --> 23:54.600
 who had a fairly high powered career before

23:54.600 --> 23:57.280
 and was kind of like taking a break.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.320
 And she was almost doing this just to explore and learn

24:00.320 --> 24:03.400
 about the gig economy, quote unquote.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.280
 So it really is a pretty wide variety of folks.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.400
 Yeah, it's kind of interesting through the captioning

24:09.400 --> 24:13.080
 process for me to learn about the Revers

24:13.080 --> 24:18.080
 because like some are clearly like weirdly knowledgeable

24:19.840 --> 24:22.960
 about technical concepts.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.280
 Like you can tell by how good they are

24:25.280 --> 24:29.040
 at like capitalizing stuff, like technical terms,

24:29.040 --> 24:30.840
 like a machine learning or deep learning.

24:30.840 --> 24:35.440
 Like I've used Rev to annotate, to caption

24:35.440 --> 24:38.000
 the deep learning lectures or machine learning lectures

24:38.000 --> 24:39.880
 I did at MIT.

24:39.880 --> 24:44.520
 And it's funny, like a large number of them were like,

24:44.520 --> 24:45.880
 I don't know if they looked it up

24:45.880 --> 24:47.280
 or were already knowledgeable,

24:47.280 --> 24:50.400
 but they do a really good job at like, I don't know.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.400
 They invest time into these things.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.040
 They will like do research, they will Google things,

24:55.040 --> 24:57.380
 you know, to kind of make sure that they got it right.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.120
 But to some of them, it's like,

24:59.120 --> 25:01.640
 it's actually part of the enjoyment of the work.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.360
 Like they'll tell us, you know,

25:03.360 --> 25:05.760
 I love doing this because I get paid

25:05.760 --> 25:07.400
 to watch a documentary on something, right?

25:07.400 --> 25:10.040
 And I learn something while I'm transcribing, right?

25:10.040 --> 25:10.880
 Pretty cool.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.680
 Yeah, so what's that captioning transcription process

25:14.680 --> 25:16.160
 look like for the Revers?

25:16.160 --> 25:18.960
 Can you maybe speak to that to give people a sense,

25:18.960 --> 25:22.000
 like how much is automated, how much is manual?

25:23.040 --> 25:25.120
 What's the actual interface look like?

25:25.120 --> 25:26.320
 All that kind of stuff.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.920
 Yeah, so, you know, we've invested a pretty good amount

25:28.920 --> 25:33.200
 of time to give like our Revers the best tools possible.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.760
 So typical day of forever,

25:34.760 --> 25:37.120
 they might log into their workspace,

25:37.120 --> 25:41.440
 they'll see a list of audios that need to be transcribed.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.400
 And we try to give them tools to pick specifically

25:43.400 --> 25:44.500
 the ones they want to do, you know?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.800
 So maybe some people like to do longer audios

25:47.800 --> 25:52.340
 or shorter audios, people have their preferences.

25:52.340 --> 25:55.080
 Some people like to do audios in a particular subject

25:55.080 --> 25:56.020
 or from a particular country.

25:56.020 --> 25:59.720
 So we try to give people the tools to control,

25:59.720 --> 26:01.100
 things like that.

26:01.100 --> 26:04.600
 And then when they pick what they want to do,

26:04.600 --> 26:07.520
 we'll launch a specialized editor that we've built

26:07.520 --> 26:10.240
 to make transcription as efficient as possible.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.360
 They'll start with a speech drag draft.

26:12.360 --> 26:15.160
 So, you know, we have our machine learning model

26:15.160 --> 26:18.560
 for automated speech recognition, they'll start with that.

26:18.560 --> 26:22.780
 And then our tools are optimized to help them correct that.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.880
 So it's basically a process of correction.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.520
 Yeah, it depends on, you know, I would say the audio.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.360
 If the audio itself is pretty good,

26:31.360 --> 26:33.160
 like probably like our podcast right now

26:33.160 --> 26:34.120
 would be quite good.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.800
 So the ASR would do a fairly good job.

26:37.840 --> 26:41.160
 But if you imagine someone recorded a lecture,

26:41.160 --> 26:45.720
 you know, in the back of a auditorium, right?

26:45.720 --> 26:47.340
 Where like the speaker is really far away

26:47.340 --> 26:49.960
 and there's maybe a lot of cross talk and things like that,

26:49.960 --> 26:52.320
 then maybe the ASR wouldn't do a good job.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.720
 So the person might say like, you know what,

26:53.720 --> 26:55.080
 I'm just gonna do it from scratch.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.280
 Do it from scratch, yeah.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.640
 So it kind of really depends.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.560
 What would you say is the speed that you can possibly get?

27:00.560 --> 27:02.080
 Like, what's the fastest?

27:02.080 --> 27:05.200
 Can you get, is it possible to get real time or no?

27:05.200 --> 27:09.120
 As you're like listening, can you write as fast as?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.440
 Real time would be pretty difficult.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.400
 It's actually a pretty, it's not an easy job, you know.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.240
 We actually encourage everyone at the company

27:16.240 --> 27:17.680
 to try to be a transcriber for a day,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.040
 transcriptionist for a day.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.120
 And it's way harder than you might think it is, right?

27:24.120 --> 27:28.280
 Because people talk fast and people have accents

27:28.280 --> 27:29.160
 and all this kind of stuff.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.920
 So real time is pretty difficult.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.600
 Is it possible?

27:32.600 --> 27:34.800
 Like there's somebody, we're probably gonna use Rev

27:34.800 --> 27:39.320
 to caption this, they're listening to this right now.

27:39.320 --> 27:42.440
 What do you think is the fastest

27:42.440 --> 27:44.880
 you could possibly get on this right now?

27:44.880 --> 27:47.480
 I think on a good audio, maybe two to three X,

27:47.480 --> 27:49.880
 I would say, real time.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.680
 Meaning it takes two to three times longer

27:51.680 --> 27:55.560
 than the actual audio of the podcast.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.600
 This is so meta, I could just imagine the Revvers

27:58.600 --> 27:59.440
 working on this right now.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.040
 You're like, you're way wrong.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.520
 You're way wrong, this takes way longer.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.360
 But yeah, it definitely works.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.440
 Or you doubted me, I could do real time.

28:06.440 --> 28:08.600
 Yeah.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.200
 Okay, so you mentioned ASR.

28:11.200 --> 28:15.480
 Can you speak to what is ASR, automatic speech recognition?

28:15.480 --> 28:19.320
 How much, like what is the gap

28:19.320 --> 28:22.000
 between perfect human performance

28:22.000 --> 28:26.680
 and perfect or pretty damn good ASR?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.800
 Yeah, so ASR, automatic speech recognition,

28:28.800 --> 28:31.800
 it's a class of machine learning problem, right?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.200
 So take speech like we're talking

28:34.200 --> 28:37.040
 and transform it into a sequence of words, essentially.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.800
 Audio of people talking.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.520
 Audio, audio to words.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.600
 And there's a variety of different approaches

28:43.600 --> 28:46.920
 and techniques, which we could talk about later if you want.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.400
 So, we think we have pretty much the world's best ASR

28:50.400 --> 28:52.600
 for this kind of speech, right?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.600
 So there's different kinds of domains, right, for ASR.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.800
 Like one domain might be voice assistance, right?

28:58.800 --> 29:02.720
 So Siri, very different than what we're doing, right?

29:02.720 --> 29:05.680
 Because Siri, there's fairly limited vocabulary.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.480
 You might ask Siri to play a song

29:08.480 --> 29:10.560
 or order a pizza or whatever.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.360
 And it's very good at doing that.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.680
 Very different from when we start talking

29:14.680 --> 29:17.040
 in a very unstructured way.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.760
 And Siri will also generally adapt to your voice

29:18.760 --> 29:20.080
 and stuff like this.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.920
 So for this kind of audio, we think we have the best.

29:22.920 --> 29:27.920
 And our accuracy, right now I think it's maybe 14%

29:29.360 --> 29:32.920
 word error rate on our test suite

29:32.920 --> 29:33.840
 that we generally use to measure.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.040
 So word error rate is like one way to measure accuracy

29:37.040 --> 29:37.880
 for ASR, right?

29:37.880 --> 29:39.720
 So what's 14% word error rate?

29:39.720 --> 29:43.360
 So 14% means across this test suite,

29:43.360 --> 29:45.960
 of a variety of different audios,

29:45.960 --> 29:50.960
 it would be, it would get in some way 14% of the words wrong.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.400
 14% of the words wrong.

29:55.400 --> 29:59.680
 So the way you kind of calculate it is,

29:59.680 --> 30:02.960
 you might add up insertions, deletions, and substitutions,

30:02.960 --> 30:03.800
 right?

30:03.800 --> 30:05.960
 So insertions is like extra words.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.680
 Deletions are words that we said,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.840
 but weren't in the transcript, right?

30:10.840 --> 30:14.200
 Substitutions is, you said Apple, but I said,

30:14.200 --> 30:16.960
 but the ASR thought it was able, something like this.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.640
 Human accuracy, most people think realistically,

30:21.640 --> 30:25.680
 it's like 3%, 2%, word error rate would be like

30:25.680 --> 30:26.840
 the max achievable.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.960
 So there's still quite a gap, right?

30:29.960 --> 30:33.000
 Would you say that, so YouTube, when I upload videos,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.440
 often generates automatic captions.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.120
 Are you sort of from a company perspective,

30:38.120 --> 30:41.560
 from a company perspective, from a tech perspective,

30:41.560 --> 30:44.720
 are you trying to beat YouTube, Google?

30:44.720 --> 30:47.400
 It's a hell of a, Google, I mean,

30:47.400 --> 30:49.720
 I don't know how seriously they take this task,

30:49.720 --> 30:51.840
 but I imagine it's quite serious.

30:51.840 --> 30:56.280
 And they, you know, Google is probably up there

30:56.280 --> 31:01.280
 in terms of their teams on, on ASR or just NLP,

31:02.080 --> 31:04.440
 natural language processing, different technologies.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.680
 So do you think you can beat Google?

31:06.680 --> 31:08.960
 On this kind of stuff, yeah, we think so.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.560
 Google just woke up on my phone.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.960
 This is hilarious, okay.

31:12.960 --> 31:16.360
 Now Google is listening, sending it back to headquarters.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.520
 Who are these rough people?

31:19.520 --> 31:20.560
 But that's the goal?

31:20.560 --> 31:23.120
 Yeah, I mean, we measure ourselves against like Google,

31:23.120 --> 31:25.560
 Amazon, Microsoft, you know, some of the,

31:25.560 --> 31:26.880
 some smaller competitors.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.320
 And we use like our internal tests with it,

31:30.320 --> 31:32.760
 we try to compose it of a pretty representative

31:32.760 --> 31:36.360
 set of ideas, maybe it's some podcasts, some videos,

31:36.360 --> 31:39.720
 some interviews, some lectures, things like that, right?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.800
 And we beat them in our own testing.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.920
 And actually Rev offers automated,

31:45.920 --> 31:49.280
 like you can actually just do the automated captioning.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.680
 So like, I guess it's like way cheaper, whatever it is,

31:52.680 --> 31:54.160
 whatever the rates are.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.000
 Yeah, yeah.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.880
 So it's a, by the way, it used to be a dollar per minute

31:57.880 --> 32:00.080
 for captioning and transcription,

32:00.080 --> 32:02.320
 I think it's like $1.15 or something like that.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.160
 $1.25.

32:03.160 --> 32:08.160
 $1.25, yeah.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.240
 It's pretty cool.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.920
 That was the other thing that was surprising to me,

32:10.920 --> 32:15.840
 it was actually like the cheapest thing you could,

32:15.840 --> 32:18.440
 one of the, I mean, I don't remember it being cheaper.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.960
 You could on Upwork get cheaper,

32:20.960 --> 32:22.520
 but it was clear to me that this,

32:22.520 --> 32:23.960
 that's gonna be really shitty.

32:23.960 --> 32:24.800
 Yeah.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.920
 So like, you're also competing on price.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.960
 I think there were services that you can get,

32:29.960 --> 32:34.200
 like similar to Rev kind of feel to it,

32:34.200 --> 32:35.880
 but it wasn't as automated.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.920
 Like the drag and drop, the entirety of the interface,

32:37.920 --> 32:39.600
 it's like the thing we're talking about.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.760
 I'm such a huge fan of like frictionless,

32:41.760 --> 32:46.760
 like Amazon's single buy button, whatever.

32:47.720 --> 32:48.560
 Yeah, yeah.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.400
 That one click.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.360
 The one click, that's genius right there.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.960
 Like that is so important for services.

32:54.960 --> 32:55.800
 Yeah.

32:55.800 --> 33:00.480
 And simplicity and I mean, Rev is almost there.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.400
 I mean, there's like some, I'm trying to think.

33:04.400 --> 33:09.400
 So I think I've, I stopped using this pipeline,

33:10.520 --> 33:12.480
 but Rev offers it and I like it,

33:12.480 --> 33:16.240
 but it was causing me some issues on my side,

33:16.240 --> 33:20.320
 which is you can connect it to like Dropbox

33:20.320 --> 33:22.760
 and it generates the files in Dropbox.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.840
 So like it closes the loop to where

33:25.840 --> 33:29.120
 I don't have to go to Rev at all and I can download it.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.720
 Sorry, I don't have to go to Rev at all

33:32.720 --> 33:34.200
 and to download the files.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.280
 It could just like automatically copy them.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.720
 Right, you're putting your Dropbox in a day later

33:39.720 --> 33:41.080
 or maybe a few hours later.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.480
 Yeah, it just shows up.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.600
 Just shows up, yeah.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.520
 Yeah, I was trying to do it programmatically too.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.920
 Is there an API interface you can,

33:48.920 --> 33:51.520
 I was trying to through like through Python

33:51.520 --> 33:53.440
 to download stuff automatically,

33:53.440 --> 33:56.160
 but then I realized this is the programmer in me.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.720
 Like, dude, you don't need to automate everything

33:58.720 --> 34:01.160
 like in life, like flawlessly,

34:01.160 --> 34:02.760
 because I wasn't doing enough captions

34:02.760 --> 34:05.640
 to justify to myself the time investment

34:05.640 --> 34:07.800
 into automating everything perfectly.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.040
 Yeah, I would say if you're doing so many interviews

34:10.040 --> 34:14.240
 that your biggest roadblock is clicking on the Rev download,

34:14.240 --> 34:18.960
 but now you're talking about Elon Musk levels of business.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.040
 But for sure, we have like a variety of ways

34:22.040 --> 34:22.880
 to make it easy.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.200
 You know, there's the integration.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.240
 You mentioned, I think it's through a company called Zapier,

34:26.240 --> 34:31.120
 which kind of can connect Dropbox to Rev and vice versa.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.480
 We have an API if you want to really like customize it,

34:33.480 --> 34:37.160
 you know, if you want to create the Lex Friedman,

34:37.160 --> 34:40.920
 you know, CMS or whatever.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.760
 For this whole thing.

34:41.760 --> 34:42.600
 Okay, cool.

34:42.600 --> 34:46.480
 So can you speak to the ASR a little bit more?

34:46.480 --> 34:51.120
 Like, what does it take?

34:51.120 --> 34:53.400
 Like approach wise, machine learning wise,

34:53.400 --> 34:55.000
 how hard is this problem?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.720
 How do you get to the 3% error rate?

34:57.720 --> 34:59.400
 Like, what's your vision of all of this?

34:59.400 --> 35:03.200
 Yeah, well, the 3% error rate is definitely,

35:03.200 --> 35:05.260
 that's the grand vision.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.000
 We'll see what it takes to get there.

35:09.840 --> 35:13.040
 But we believe, you know, in ASR,

35:13.040 --> 35:15.200
 the biggest thing is the data, right?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.520
 Like, that's true of like a lot of

35:16.520 --> 35:18.320
 machine learning problems today, right?

35:18.320 --> 35:21.000
 The more data you have and high quality of the data,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.800
 the better label the data.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.480
 Yeah, that's how you get good results.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.760
 And we at Rev have kind of like the best data.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.760
 Like we have.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.960
 Like you're literally,

35:30.960 --> 35:34.000
 your business model is annotating the data.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.720
 Our business model is being paid to annotate the data.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.080
 Being paid to annotate the data.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.000
 So it's kind of like a pretty magical flywheel.

35:42.000 --> 35:42.840
 Yeah.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.480
 And so we've kind of like written this flywheel

35:44.480 --> 35:47.000
 to this point.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.480
 And we think we're still kind of in the early stages

35:50.480 --> 35:53.080
 of figuring out all the parts of the flywheel to use,

35:53.080 --> 35:56.360
 you know, because we have the final transcripts

35:57.560 --> 36:01.640
 and we have the audios and we train on that.

36:01.640 --> 36:05.000
 But we in principle also have all the edits

36:05.000 --> 36:06.440
 that the Revvers make, right?

36:07.760 --> 36:08.600
 Oh, that's interesting.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.520
 How can you use that as data?

36:10.520 --> 36:13.280
 Yeah, that's something for us to figure out in the future.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.080
 But, you know, we feel like we're only

36:15.080 --> 36:16.200
 in the early stages, right?

36:16.200 --> 36:17.880
 So the data is there.

36:17.880 --> 36:18.720
 That'd be interesting.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.720
 Like almost like a recurrent neural net

36:20.720 --> 36:23.960
 for fixing transcripts.

36:23.960 --> 36:28.680
 I always remember we did a segmentation annotation

36:28.680 --> 36:30.200
 for driving data.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.160
 So segmenting the scene, like visual data.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.000
 And you can get all,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.400
 so it was drawing, people were drawing polygons

36:37.400 --> 36:39.960
 around different objects and so on.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.720
 And it feels like it always felt like

36:41.720 --> 36:45.160
 there was a lot of information in the clicking,

36:45.160 --> 36:46.960
 the sequence of clicking that people do,

36:46.960 --> 36:49.400
 the kind of fixing of the polygons that they do.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.840
 Now there's a few papers written about

36:52.840 --> 36:56.840
 how to draw polygons like with a recurrent neural nets

36:57.720 --> 37:00.960
 to try to learn from the human clicking.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.320
 But it was just like experimental,

37:04.320 --> 37:06.600
 you know, it was one of those like CVPR type papers

37:06.600 --> 37:08.920
 that people do like a really tiny data set.

37:08.920 --> 37:13.040
 It didn't feel like people really tried to do it seriously.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.440
 Yeah, I wonder if there's information in the fixing

37:16.440 --> 37:21.440
 that provides deeper set of signal

37:21.520 --> 37:24.400
 than just like the raw data.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.120
 The intuition is for sure there must be, right?

37:26.120 --> 37:26.960
 There must be.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.640
 And in all kinds of signals and how long you took

37:29.640 --> 37:32.640
 to make that edit and stuff like that.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.080
 It's gonna be like up to us.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.760
 That's why like the next couple of years

37:36.760 --> 37:38.280
 is like super exciting for us, right?

37:38.280 --> 37:40.320
 So that's what like the focus is now.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.280
 You mentioned rev.ai, that's where you want to.

37:43.280 --> 37:48.280
 Yeah, so rev.ai is kind of our way of bringing this ASR

37:49.120 --> 37:51.520
 to the rest of the world, right?

37:51.520 --> 37:55.560
 So when we started, we were human only.

37:55.560 --> 37:59.160
 Then we kind of created this Temi service.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.600
 I think you might've used it,

38:00.600 --> 38:02.520
 which was kind of ASR for the consumer, right?

38:02.520 --> 38:06.520
 So if you don't wanna pay $1.25, but you wanna pay,

38:06.520 --> 38:08.040
 now it's 25 cents a minute, I think.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.680
 And you get the transcript,

38:10.680 --> 38:13.800
 the machine generated transcript and you get an editor

38:13.800 --> 38:17.440
 and you can kind of fix it up yourself, right?

38:17.440 --> 38:18.800
 Then we started using ASR

38:18.800 --> 38:21.960
 for our own human transcriptionists.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.400
 And then the kind of rev.ai is the final step

38:23.400 --> 38:25.120
 of the journey, which is, you know,

38:25.120 --> 38:27.040
 we have this amazing engine.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.840
 What can people build with it, right?

38:28.840 --> 38:32.320
 What kind of new applications could be enabled

38:33.600 --> 38:36.320
 if you have SpeedTrack that's that accurate?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.560
 Do you have ideas for this

38:37.560 --> 38:39.240
 or is it just providing it as a service

38:39.240 --> 38:40.640
 and seeing what people come up with?

38:40.640 --> 38:41.920
 It's providing it as a service

38:41.920 --> 38:43.480
 and seeing what people come up with

38:43.480 --> 38:45.560
 and kind of learning from what people do with it.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.160
 And we have ideas of our own as well, of course,

38:47.160 --> 38:49.160
 but it's a little bit like, you know,

38:49.160 --> 38:52.520
 when AWS provided the building blocks, right?

38:52.520 --> 38:53.880
 And they saw what people built with it

38:53.880 --> 38:56.960
 and they try to make it easier to build those things, right?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.120
 And we kind of hope to do the same thing.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.760
 Although AWS kind of does a shitty job of like,

39:02.760 --> 39:05.000
 I'm continually surprised, like Mechanical Turk,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.720
 for example, how shitty the interface is.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.080
 We're talking about like Rev making me feel good.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.080
 Like when I first discovered Mechanical Turk,

39:15.200 --> 39:18.200
 the initial idea of it was like,

39:18.200 --> 39:19.600
 it made me feel like Rev does,

39:19.600 --> 39:22.760
 but then the interface is like, come on.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.720
 Yeah, it's horrible.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.720
 Why is it so painful?

39:27.720 --> 39:32.480
 Does nobody at Amazon want to like seriously invest in it?

39:32.480 --> 39:35.000
 It felt like you can make so much money

39:35.000 --> 39:37.160
 if you took this effort seriously.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.240
 And it feels like they have a committee

39:39.240 --> 39:41.200
 of like two people just sitting back,

39:41.200 --> 39:44.000
 like a meeting, they meet once a month,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.520
 like what are we going to do with Mechanical Turk?

39:46.520 --> 39:49.240
 It's like two websites making me feel like this,

39:49.240 --> 39:53.600
 that and craiglist.org, whatever the hell it is.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.960
 It feels like it's designed in the 90s.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.120
 Well, Craigslist basically hasn't been updated

39:59.120 --> 39:59.960
 pretty much since the guy originally built.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.840
 Do you seriously think there's a team,

40:01.840 --> 40:04.240
 like how big is the team working on Mechanical Turk?

40:04.240 --> 40:05.080
 I don't know.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.840
 There's some team, right?

40:06.840 --> 40:08.360
 I feel like there isn't.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.480
 I'm skeptical.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.600
 Yeah.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.680
 Well, if nothing else, they benefit from the other teams

40:14.680 --> 40:18.400
 like moving things forward in a small way.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.760
 But I know what you mean.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.280
 We use Mechanical Turk for a couple of things as well.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.840
 And yeah, it's painful UI.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.720
 It's painful, but yeah, it works.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.560
 I think most people, the thing is most people

40:27.560 --> 40:29.160
 don't really use the UI, right?

40:29.160 --> 40:33.600
 Like we, for example, we use it through the API, right?

40:33.600 --> 40:36.120
 But even the API documentation and so on,

40:36.120 --> 40:37.520
 like it's super outdated.

40:37.520 --> 40:42.520
 Like I don't even know what to...

40:42.840 --> 40:46.440
 I mean, the same criticism, as long as we're ranting,

40:47.680 --> 40:49.960
 my same criticism goes to the APIs

40:49.960 --> 40:50.920
 of most of these companies.

40:50.920 --> 40:55.120
 Like Google, for example, the API for the different services

40:55.120 --> 40:59.760
 is just the documentation is so shitty.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.160
 Like it's not so shitty.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.280
 I should actually be...

41:05.280 --> 41:08.280
 I should exhibit some gratitude.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.800
 Okay, let's practice some gratitude.

41:10.800 --> 41:14.240
 The documentation is pretty good.

41:14.240 --> 41:18.720
 Like most of the things that the API makes available

41:18.720 --> 41:19.640
 is pretty good.

41:19.640 --> 41:23.040
 It's just that in the sense that it's accurate,

41:23.040 --> 41:27.200
 sometimes outdated, but like the degree of explanations

41:27.200 --> 41:31.360
 with examples is only covering, I would say,

41:31.360 --> 41:33.840
 like 50% of what's possible.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.520
 And it just feels a little bit,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.320
 like there's a lot of natural questions

41:37.320 --> 41:41.600
 that people would wanna ask that doesn't get covered.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.520
 And it feels like it's almost there.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.120
 Like it's such a magical thing.

41:46.120 --> 41:51.120
 Like the Maps API, YouTube API, there's a bunch of stuff.

41:51.120 --> 41:54.720
 I gotta imagine it's like, there's probably some team

41:54.720 --> 41:57.440
 at Google responsible for writing this documentation

41:57.440 --> 42:00.240
 that's probably not the engineers, right?

42:00.240 --> 42:04.360
 And probably this team is not where you wanna be.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.800
 Well, it's a weird thing.

42:05.800 --> 42:09.160
 I sometimes think about this for somebody

42:09.160 --> 42:12.120
 who wants to also build a company.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.920
 I think about this a lot.

42:14.920 --> 42:19.920
 YouTube, the service is one of the most magical,

42:21.560 --> 42:24.440
 like I'm so grateful that YouTube exists.

42:24.440 --> 42:29.440
 And yet they seem to be quite clueless on so many things

42:30.840 --> 42:33.400
 like that everybody's screaming them at.

42:33.400 --> 42:37.360
 Like it feels like whatever the mechanism

42:37.360 --> 42:40.080
 that you use to listen to your quote unquote customers,

42:40.080 --> 42:44.800
 which is like the creators, is not very good.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.880
 Like there's literally people that are like screaming why,

42:47.880 --> 42:51.040
 like their new YouTube studio, for example.

42:51.040 --> 42:55.160
 There's like features that were like begged for

42:55.160 --> 42:56.880
 for a really long time.

42:56.880 --> 43:00.160
 Like being able to upload multiple videos at the same time.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.880
 That wasn't missing for a really, really long time.

43:03.880 --> 43:08.000
 Now, like there's probably things that I don't know,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.960
 which is maybe for that kind of huge infrastructure,

43:10.960 --> 43:12.320
 it's actually very difficult to build

43:12.320 --> 43:13.720
 some of these features.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.520
 But the fact that that wasn't communicated

43:15.520 --> 43:19.120
 and it felt like you're not being heard.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.520
 Like I remember this experience for me

43:21.520 --> 43:23.800
 and it's not a pleasant experience.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.720
 And it feels like the company doesn't give a damn about you.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.160
 And that's something to think about.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.960
 I'm not sure what that is.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.480
 That might have to do with just like small groups

43:32.480 --> 43:35.920
 working on these small features and these specific features.

43:35.920 --> 43:40.280
 And there's no overarching like dictator type of human

43:40.280 --> 43:42.440
 that says like, why the hell are we neglecting

43:42.440 --> 43:43.920
 like Steve Jobs type of characters?

43:43.920 --> 43:48.240
 Like there's people that we need to speak

43:48.240 --> 43:50.640
 to the people that like wanna love our product

43:50.640 --> 43:51.680
 and they don't.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.520
 Let's fix this shit.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.160
 Maybe at some point you just get so fixated

43:54.160 --> 43:55.120
 on the numbers, right?

43:55.120 --> 43:57.200
 And it's like, well, the numbers are pretty great, right?

43:57.200 --> 43:58.640
 Like people are watching,

43:59.680 --> 44:01.960
 doesn't seem to be a problem, right?

44:01.960 --> 44:04.080
 And you're not like the person that like build this thing,

44:04.080 --> 44:04.920
 right?

44:04.920 --> 44:05.840
 So you really care about it.

44:05.840 --> 44:09.080
 You're just there, you came in as a product manager, right?

44:09.080 --> 44:10.680
 You got hired sometime later,

44:10.680 --> 44:13.520
 your mandate is like increase this number,

44:13.520 --> 44:15.680
 like 10%, right?

44:15.680 --> 44:16.520
 And you just.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.520
 That's brilliantly put.

44:17.520 --> 44:21.320
 Like if you, this is, okay, if there's a lesson in this

44:21.320 --> 44:24.200
 is don't reduce your company into a metric

44:24.200 --> 44:28.280
 of like how much, like you said,

44:28.280 --> 44:30.800
 how much people watching the videos and so on

44:30.800 --> 44:33.800
 and like convince yourself that everything is working

44:33.800 --> 44:36.120
 just because the numbers are going up.

44:36.120 --> 44:39.120
 There's something, you have to have a vision.

44:39.120 --> 44:43.400
 You have to want people to love your stuff

44:43.400 --> 44:46.120
 because love is ultimately the beginning

44:46.120 --> 44:49.280
 of like a successful longterm company

44:49.280 --> 44:51.320
 is that they always should love your product.

44:51.320 --> 44:52.640
 You have to be like a creator

44:52.640 --> 44:55.400
 and have that like creator's love for your own thing, right?

44:55.400 --> 44:59.560
 Like, and you're pained by these comments, right?

44:59.560 --> 45:02.480
 And probably like Apple, I think did this generally

45:02.480 --> 45:03.840
 like really well.

45:03.840 --> 45:06.880
 They're well known for kind of keeping teams small

45:06.880 --> 45:08.200
 even when they were big, right?

45:08.200 --> 45:10.400
 And, you know, he was an engineer,

45:10.400 --> 45:12.680
 like there's a book, a creative selection.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.440
 I don't know if you read it by a Apple engineer

45:15.440 --> 45:17.280
 named Ken Koscienda.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.320
 It's kind of a great book actually

45:18.320 --> 45:21.440
 because unlike most of these business books where it's,

45:21.440 --> 45:24.600
 you know, here's how Steve Jobs ran the company.

45:24.600 --> 45:27.240
 It's more like here's how life was like for me, you know,

45:27.240 --> 45:29.000
 an engineer here, the projects I worked on

45:29.000 --> 45:31.720
 and here what it was like to pitch Steve Jobs, you know,

45:31.720 --> 45:34.640
 on like, you know, I think it was in charge of like

45:34.640 --> 45:36.840
 the keyboard and the auto correction, right?

45:36.840 --> 45:39.440
 And at Apple, like Steve Jobs reviewed everything.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.160
 And so he was like, this is what it was like

45:41.160 --> 45:43.720
 to show my demos to Steve Jobs and, you know,

45:43.720 --> 45:46.600
 to change them because like Steve Jobs didn't like how,

45:46.600 --> 45:48.760
 you know, the shape of the little key was off

45:48.760 --> 45:50.920
 because the rounding of the corner was like not quite right

45:50.920 --> 45:51.760
 or something like this, right?

45:51.760 --> 45:54.640
 He was famously a stickler for this kind of stuff.

45:54.640 --> 45:55.800
 But because the teams were small,

45:55.800 --> 45:56.920
 he really owned this stuff, right?

45:56.920 --> 45:58.680
 So he really cared.

45:58.680 --> 46:01.640
 Yeah, Elon Musk does that similar kind of thing with Tesla,

46:01.640 --> 46:03.400
 which is really interesting.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.880
 There's another lesson in leadership in that

46:05.880 --> 46:07.640
 is to be obsessed with the details.

46:07.640 --> 46:11.280
 And like, he talks to like the lowest level engineers.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.600
 Okay, so we're talking about ASR

46:14.600 --> 46:17.640
 and so this is basically where I was saying

46:17.640 --> 46:20.360
 we're gonna take this like ultra seriously.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.640
 And then what's the mission?

46:22.640 --> 46:26.200
 To try to keep pushing towards the 3%.

46:26.200 --> 46:30.320
 Yeah, and kind of try to build this platform

46:30.320 --> 46:33.920
 where all of your, you know, all of your meetings,

46:33.920 --> 46:38.440
 you know, they're as easily accessible as your notes, right?

46:38.440 --> 46:41.360
 Like, so, like, imagine all the meetings

46:41.360 --> 46:43.080
 a company might have, right?

46:43.080 --> 46:46.280
 You know, now that I'm like no longer a programmer, right?

46:46.280 --> 46:48.080
 Then I'm a quote unquote manager.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.120
 That's less like my day as in meetings, right?

46:51.120 --> 46:51.960
 Yeah.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.800
 And, you know, pretty often I wanna like see

46:53.800 --> 46:55.040
 what was said, right?

46:55.040 --> 46:56.200
 Who said it, you know?

46:56.200 --> 46:57.040
 What's the context?

46:57.040 --> 46:59.360
 But it's generally not really something

46:59.360 --> 47:00.480
 that you can easily retrieve, right?

47:00.480 --> 47:03.200
 Like imagine if all of those meetings

47:03.200 --> 47:05.760
 were indexed, archived, you know, you could go back,

47:05.760 --> 47:08.280
 you could share a clip like really easily, right?

47:08.280 --> 47:10.040
 So that might change completely.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.920
 It's like everything that's said,

47:11.920 --> 47:14.000
 converted to text might change completely

47:14.000 --> 47:16.320
 the dynamics of what we do in this world,

47:16.320 --> 47:18.160
 especially now with remote work, right?

47:18.160 --> 47:19.480
 Exactly, exactly.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.440
 With Zoom and so on.

47:21.440 --> 47:22.760
 That's fascinating to think about.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.560
 I mean, for me, I care about podcasts, right?

47:25.560 --> 47:28.800
 And one of the things that was,

47:30.400 --> 47:31.240
 you know, I'm torn.

47:31.240 --> 47:33.600
 I know a lot of the engineers at Spotify.

47:33.600 --> 47:38.600
 So I love them very much because they dream big

47:39.840 --> 47:43.400
 in terms of like, they wanna empower creators.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.080
 So one of my hopes was with Spotify

47:45.080 --> 47:46.840
 that they would use a technology like Rev

47:46.840 --> 47:51.720
 or something like that to start converting everything

47:51.720 --> 47:55.200
 into text and make it indexable.

47:55.200 --> 47:59.560
 Like one of the things that sucks with podcasts

47:59.560 --> 48:01.800
 is like, it's hard to find stuff.

48:01.800 --> 48:04.480
 Like the model is basically subscription.

48:04.480 --> 48:09.480
 Like you find, it's similar to what YouTube used to be like,

48:10.600 --> 48:14.240
 which is you basically find a creator that you enjoy

48:14.240 --> 48:15.360
 and you subscribe to them.

48:15.360 --> 48:19.720
 And like, you just kind of follow what they're doing,

48:19.720 --> 48:24.320
 but the search and discovery wasn't a big part of YouTube

48:24.320 --> 48:25.560
 like in the early days,

48:25.560 --> 48:28.560
 but that's what currently with podcasts,

48:28.560 --> 48:33.560
 like is the search and discovery is like non existent.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.280
 You're basically searching for like

48:35.280 --> 48:36.400
 the dumbest possible thing,

48:36.400 --> 48:39.680
 which is like keywords in the titles of episodes.

48:39.680 --> 48:40.520
 Yeah.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.160
 Even aside from a search and discovery, like all the time.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.160
 So I listened to like a number of podcasts

48:44.160 --> 48:46.840
 and there's something said,

48:46.840 --> 48:48.560
 and I wanna like go back to that later

48:48.560 --> 48:49.800
 because I was trying to, I'm trying to remember,

48:49.800 --> 48:50.640
 what do you say?

48:50.640 --> 48:52.160
 Like maybe like recommended some cool product

48:52.160 --> 48:53.440
 that I wanna try out.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.680
 And like, it's basically impossible.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.800
 Maybe like some people have pretty good show notes.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.040
 So maybe you'll get lucky and you can find it, right?

48:59.040 --> 49:01.600
 But I mean, if everyone had transcripts

49:01.600 --> 49:05.320
 and it was all searchable, it would be so much better.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.480
 I mean, that's one of the things that I wanted to,

49:08.480 --> 49:11.040
 I mean, one of the reasons we're talking today

49:11.040 --> 49:13.400
 is I wanted to take this quite seriously.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.700
 The rough thing, I just been lazy.

49:16.840 --> 49:19.480
 So, because I'm very fortunate

49:19.480 --> 49:21.240
 that a lot of people support this podcast,

49:21.240 --> 49:24.840
 that there's enough money now to do a transcription and so on.

49:24.840 --> 49:29.840
 And it seemed clear to me, especially like CEOs

49:29.960 --> 49:34.960
 and sort of like PhDs, like people write to me

49:36.360 --> 49:38.320
 who are like graduate students in computer science

49:38.320 --> 49:41.100
 or graduate students in whatever the heck field,

49:41.100 --> 49:43.120
 it's clear that their mind,

49:43.120 --> 49:44.320
 like they enjoy podcasts

49:44.320 --> 49:46.120
 when they're doing laundry or whatever,

49:46.120 --> 49:48.760
 but they wanna revisit the conversation

49:48.760 --> 49:50.720
 in a much more rigorous way.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.920
 And they really wanna transcript.

49:52.920 --> 49:56.120
 Like it's clear that they want to analyze conversations.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.400
 Like so many people wrote to me

49:58.400 --> 50:01.080
 about a transcript for Yosha Bach conversation.

50:01.080 --> 50:03.720
 I had just a bunch of conversations.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.840
 And then on the Elon Musk side,

50:05.840 --> 50:09.400
 like reporters, they wanna write a blog post

50:09.400 --> 50:10.840
 about your conversation.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.040
 So they wanna be able to pull stuff.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.480
 And it's like, they're essentially doing

50:15.480 --> 50:18.360
 on your conversation transcription privately.

50:18.360 --> 50:21.800
 They're doing it for themselves and then starting to pick,

50:21.800 --> 50:23.960
 but it's so much easier when you can actually do it

50:23.960 --> 50:26.200
 as a reporter, just look at the transcript.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.360
 Yeah, and you can like embed a little thing,

50:28.360 --> 50:29.600
 like into your article, right?

50:29.600 --> 50:31.240
 Here's what they said, you can go listen

50:31.240 --> 50:33.580
 to like this clip from the section.

50:33.580 --> 50:35.960
 I'm actually trying to figure out,

50:35.960 --> 50:38.180
 I'll probably on the website create

50:39.320 --> 50:41.440
 like a place where the transcript goes,

50:41.440 --> 50:44.360
 like as a webpage so that people can reference it,

50:44.360 --> 50:46.720
 like reporters can reference it and so on.

50:46.720 --> 50:50.880
 I mean, most of the reporters probably want

50:50.880 --> 50:54.360
 to write clickbait articles that are complete falsifying,

50:54.360 --> 50:55.400
 which I'm fine with.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.760
 It's the way of journalism, I don't care.

50:57.760 --> 51:01.680
 Like I've had this conversation with a friend of mine,

51:01.680 --> 51:03.920
 a mixed martial artist, the Ryan Hall.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.120
 And we talked about, you know,

51:07.120 --> 51:09.640
 as I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

51:09.640 --> 51:13.240
 and a bunch of books on Hitler and we brought up Hitler

51:13.240 --> 51:17.280
 and he made some kind of comment where like,

51:17.280 --> 51:19.480
 we should be able to forgive Hitler

51:19.480 --> 51:23.640
 and, you know, like we were talking about forgiveness

51:23.640 --> 51:25.880
 and we're bringing that up as like the worst case

51:25.880 --> 51:28.520
 possible things, like even, you know,

51:28.520 --> 51:32.040
 for people who are Holocaust survivors,

51:32.040 --> 51:34.660
 one of the ways to let go of the suffering

51:34.660 --> 51:38.000
 they've been through is to forgive.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.760
 And he brought up like Hitler as somebody

51:39.760 --> 51:42.400
 that would potentially be the hardest thing

51:42.400 --> 51:45.720
 to possibly forgive, but it might be a worthwhile pursuit

51:45.720 --> 51:48.560
 psychologically, so on, blah, blah, blah, it doesn't matter.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.860
 It was very eloquent, very powerful words.

51:50.860 --> 51:53.160
 I think people should go back and listen to it.

51:53.160 --> 51:54.000
 It's powerful.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.680
 And then all these journalists,

51:55.680 --> 52:00.000
 all these articles written about like MMA fight, UFC fight.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.920
 MMA fighter loves Hitler.

52:01.920 --> 52:03.680
 No, like, well, no, they didn't.

52:03.680 --> 52:05.720
 They were somewhat accurate.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.120
 They didn't say like loves Hitler.

52:07.120 --> 52:12.120
 They said, thinks that if Hitler came back to life,

52:13.280 --> 52:14.420
 we should forgive him.

52:14.420 --> 52:18.520
 Like they kind of, it's kind of accurate ish,

52:18.520 --> 52:23.520
 but the headline made it sound a lot worse

52:23.800 --> 52:27.800
 than it was, but I'm fine with it.

52:27.800 --> 52:31.640
 That's the way the world, I wanna almost make it easier

52:31.640 --> 52:33.640
 for those journalists and make it easier

52:33.640 --> 52:35.800
 for people who actually care about the conversation

52:35.800 --> 52:37.280
 to go and look and see.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.520
 Right, they can see it for themselves.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.360
 For themselves.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.640
 There's the headline, but now you can go.

52:41.640 --> 52:42.960
 There's something about podcasts,

52:42.960 --> 52:44.840
 like the audio that makes it difficult

52:44.840 --> 52:49.600
 to jump to a spot and to look

52:49.600 --> 52:53.240
 for that particular information.

52:53.240 --> 52:57.040
 I think some of it, I'm interested in creating,

52:58.520 --> 53:00.360
 like myself experimenting with stuff.

53:00.360 --> 53:03.440
 So like taking rev and creating a transcript

53:03.440 --> 53:05.200
 and then people can go to it.

53:05.200 --> 53:09.320
 I do dream that like, I'm not in the loop anymore,

53:09.320 --> 53:13.000
 that like, Spotify does it, right?

53:13.000 --> 53:16.340
 Like automatically for everybody,

53:16.340 --> 53:19.600
 because ultimately that one click purchase

53:19.600 --> 53:21.800
 needs to be there, like, you know.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.120
 Like you kind of want support from the entire ecosystem.

53:24.120 --> 53:24.960
 Exactly.

53:24.960 --> 53:27.960
 Like from the tool makers and the podcast creators,

53:27.960 --> 53:28.800
 even clients, right?

53:28.800 --> 53:33.800
 I mean, imagine if like most podcast apps,

53:33.900 --> 53:35.840
 you know, if it was a standard, right?

53:35.840 --> 53:38.560
 Here's how you include a transcript into a podcast, right?

53:38.560 --> 53:40.920
 Like it's just an RSS feed ultimately.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.520
 And actually just yesterday I saw this company

53:43.520 --> 53:46.880
 called Buzzsprout, I think they're called.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.320
 So they're trying to do this.

53:48.320 --> 53:53.320
 They proposed a spec, an extension to their RSS format

53:53.420 --> 53:58.240
 to reference transcripts in a standard way.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.080
 And they're talking about like,

53:59.080 --> 54:02.140
 there's one client dimension that will support it,

54:02.140 --> 54:04.040
 but imagine like more clients support it, right?

54:04.040 --> 54:08.280
 So any podcast, you could go and see the transcripts

54:08.280 --> 54:10.480
 right in your like normal podcast app.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.320
 Yeah.

54:11.320 --> 54:14.180
 I mean, somebody, so I have somebody who works with me,

54:15.720 --> 54:20.200
 works with helps with advertising, Matt, this awesome guy.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.280
 He mentioned Buzzsprout to me, but he says,

54:22.280 --> 54:24.880
 it's really annoying because they want exclusive,

54:24.880 --> 54:26.280
 they want to host the podcast.

54:26.280 --> 54:27.120
 Right.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.240
 This is the problem with Spotify too.

54:29.240 --> 54:33.920
 This is where I'd like to say, like F Spotify,

54:33.920 --> 54:37.680
 there's a magic to RSS with podcasts.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.320
 It can be made available to everyone.

54:40.320 --> 54:42.720
 And then there's all, there's this ecosystem

54:42.720 --> 54:45.000
 of different podcast players that emerge

54:45.000 --> 54:47.080
 and they compete freely.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.920
 And that's a beautiful thing,

54:48.920 --> 54:50.400
 that that's why I go on exclusive,

54:50.400 --> 54:51.960
 like Joe Rogan went exclusive.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.760
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with,

54:54.760 --> 54:59.560
 he went to Spotify as a huge fan of Joe Rogan.

54:59.560 --> 55:01.380
 I've been kind of nervous about the whole thing,

55:01.380 --> 55:05.000
 but let's see, I hope that Spotify steps up.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.020
 They've added video, which was very surprising

55:07.020 --> 55:07.860
 that they were able to put on.

55:07.860 --> 55:10.360
 Exclusive meaning you can't subscribe

55:10.360 --> 55:11.680
 to the RSS feed anymore.

55:11.680 --> 55:12.680
 It's only in Spotify.

55:12.680 --> 55:15.720
 For now you can until December 1st.

55:15.720 --> 55:18.800
 And December 1st, it's all, everything disappears

55:18.800 --> 55:20.120
 and it's Spotify only.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.260
 I, you know, and Spotify gave him a hundred million dollars

55:25.260 --> 55:26.100
 for that.

55:26.100 --> 55:29.960
 So it's an interesting deal, but I, you know,

55:29.960 --> 55:34.480
 I did some soul searching and I'm glad he's doing it.

55:34.480 --> 55:38.640
 But if Spotify came to me with a hundred million dollars,

55:38.640 --> 55:40.080
 I wouldn't do it.

55:40.080 --> 55:42.160
 I wouldn't do, well, I have a very different relationship

55:42.160 --> 55:43.000
 with money.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.640
 I hate money, but I just think I believe

55:46.640 --> 55:50.000
 in the pirate radio aspect of podcasting, the freedom.

55:50.000 --> 55:50.840
 And that there's something about.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.280
 The open source spirit.

55:52.280 --> 55:54.680
 The open source spirit, it just doesn't seem right.

55:54.680 --> 55:55.780
 It doesn't feel right.

55:55.780 --> 55:58.480
 That said, you know, because so many people care

55:58.480 --> 56:00.400
 about Joe Rogan's program,

56:00.400 --> 56:02.960
 they're gonna hold Spotify's feet to the fire.

56:02.960 --> 56:06.400
 Like one of the cool things with what Joe told me

56:06.400 --> 56:10.440
 is the reason he likes working with Spotify

56:10.440 --> 56:15.440
 is that they, they're like ride or die together, right?

56:16.200 --> 56:19.160
 So they, they want him to succeed.

56:19.160 --> 56:22.080
 So that's why they're not actually telling him what to do

56:22.080 --> 56:23.800
 despite what people think.

56:23.800 --> 56:24.980
 They, they don't tell them,

56:24.980 --> 56:26.940
 they don't give them any notes on anything.

56:26.940 --> 56:28.560
 They want him to succeed.

56:28.560 --> 56:31.920
 And that's the cool thing about exclusivity with a platform

56:31.920 --> 56:36.800
 is like, you're kind of wanting each other to succeed.

56:36.800 --> 56:39.720
 And that process can actually be very fruitful.

56:39.720 --> 56:43.380
 Like YouTube, it goes back to my criticism.

56:44.600 --> 56:47.800
 YouTube generally, no matter how big the creator,

56:47.800 --> 56:50.160
 maybe for PewDiePie, something like that,

56:50.160 --> 56:51.680
 they want you to succeed.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.920
 But for the most part, from all the big creators

56:53.920 --> 56:57.040
 I've spoken with, Veritasium, all of those folks,

56:57.040 --> 56:59.000
 you know, they get some basic assistance,

56:59.000 --> 57:02.800
 but it's not like, YouTube doesn't care

57:02.800 --> 57:03.840
 if you succeed or not.

57:03.840 --> 57:04.680
 They have so many creators.

57:04.680 --> 57:06.500
 Yeah, like a hundred other.

57:06.500 --> 57:07.600
 They don't care.

57:07.600 --> 57:12.600
 So, and especially with, with somebody like Joe Rogan,

57:12.840 --> 57:15.080
 who YouTube sees Joe Rogan,

57:15.080 --> 57:19.760
 not as a person who might revolutionize the nature of news

57:19.760 --> 57:23.900
 and idea space and nuanced conversations.

57:23.900 --> 57:26.280
 They see him as a potential person

57:26.280 --> 57:30.240
 who has racist guests on,

57:30.240 --> 57:33.520
 or like, you know, they see him as like a headache,

57:33.520 --> 57:34.440
 potentially.

57:34.440 --> 57:37.980
 So, you know, a lot of people talk about this.

57:37.980 --> 57:40.600
 It's a hard place to be for YouTube, actually,

57:40.600 --> 57:45.600
 is figuring out with the search and discovery process

57:46.840 --> 57:49.040
 of how do you filter out conspiracy theories

57:49.040 --> 57:53.360
 and which conspiracy theories represent dangerous untruths

57:53.360 --> 57:58.080
 and which conspiracy theories are like vanilla untruths.

57:58.080 --> 58:00.640
 And then even when you start having meetings

58:00.640 --> 58:03.400
 and discussions about what is true or not,

58:03.400 --> 58:05.080
 it starts getting weird.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.800
 Yeah, it's difficult these days, right?

58:07.800 --> 58:09.720
 I worry more about the other side, right?

58:09.720 --> 58:13.240
 Of too much, you know, too much censorship.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.660
 Well, maybe censorship is the right word.

58:14.660 --> 58:17.960
 I mean, censorship is usually government censorship,

58:17.960 --> 58:21.360
 but still, yeah, putting yourself in the position

58:21.360 --> 58:22.920
 of arbiter for these kinds of things.

58:22.920 --> 58:25.360
 It's very difficult and people think it's so easy, right?

58:25.360 --> 58:27.800
 Like, cause like, well, you know, like no Nazis, right?

58:27.800 --> 58:29.060
 What a simple principle.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.960
 But you know, yes, I mean, no one likes Nazis,

58:32.960 --> 58:35.360
 but there's like many shades of gray,

58:35.360 --> 58:37.320
 like very soon after that.

58:37.320 --> 58:39.640
 Yeah, and then, you know, of course everybody, you know,

58:39.640 --> 58:42.200
 there's some people that call our current president a Nazi

58:42.200 --> 58:45.680
 and then there's like, so you start getting a Sam Harris.

58:45.680 --> 58:49.640
 I don't know if you know that is wasted, in my opinion,

58:49.640 --> 58:51.640
 his conversation with Jack Dorsey.

58:51.640 --> 58:54.200
 Now I'll also, I spoke with Jack before in this podcast

58:54.200 --> 58:58.240
 and we'll talk again, but Sam brought up,

58:58.240 --> 59:00.140
 Sam Harris does not like Donald Trump.

59:01.400 --> 59:03.720
 I do listen to his podcast.

59:03.720 --> 59:06.480
 I'm familiar with his views on the matter.

59:06.480 --> 59:08.960
 And he asked Jack Dorsey, he's like,

59:08.960 --> 59:12.280
 how can you not ban Donald Trump from Twitter?

59:12.280 --> 59:15.960
 And so, you know, there's a set, you have that conversation.

59:15.960 --> 59:18.240
 You have a conversation where some number,

59:18.240 --> 59:20.760
 some significant number of people think

59:20.760 --> 59:22.880
 that the current president of the United States

59:22.880 --> 59:24.880
 should not be on your platform.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.240
 And it's like, okay.

59:26.240 --> 59:29.360
 So if that's even on the table as a conversation,

59:29.360 --> 59:32.720
 then everything's on the table for conversation.

59:32.720 --> 59:34.640
 And yeah, it's tough.

59:34.640 --> 59:37.000
 I'm not sure where I land on it.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.440
 I'm with you, I think that censorship is bad,

59:39.440 --> 59:41.840
 but I also think the show...

59:41.840 --> 59:43.960
 Ultimately, I just also think, you know,

59:43.960 --> 59:46.520
 if you're the kind of person that's gonna be convinced,

59:46.520 --> 59:49.420
 you know, by some YouTube video, you know,

59:49.420 --> 59:53.120
 that, I don't know, our government's been taken over

59:53.120 --> 59:56.080
 by aliens, it's unlikely that like, you know,

59:56.080 --> 59:58.960
 you'll be returned to sanity simply because, you know,

59:58.960 --> 1:00:01.980
 that video is not available on YouTube, right?

1:00:01.980 --> 1:00:02.820
 Yeah, I'm with you.

1:00:02.820 --> 1:00:04.520
 I tend to believe in the intelligence of people

1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:06.960
 and we should trust them.

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:10.940
 But I also do think it's the responsibility of platforms

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.640
 to encourage more love in the world,

1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:14.120
 more kindness to each other.

1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:16.920
 And I don't always think that they're great

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:19.240
 at doing that particular thing.

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:24.240
 So that, there's a nice balance there.

1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:28.240
 And I think philosophically, I think about that a lot.

1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:32.040
 Where's the balance between free speech

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:35.000
 and like encouraging people,

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.880
 even though they have the freedom of speech

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:39.520
 to not be an asshole.

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:41.020
 Yeah, right.

1:00:41.020 --> 1:00:42.960
 That's not a constitutional, like...

1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.100
 So you have the right for free speech,

1:00:48.100 --> 1:00:50.640
 but like, just don't be an asshole.

1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:52.640
 Like you can't really put that in the constitution

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:54.160
 that the Supreme Court can't be like,

1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:56.040
 eh, just don't be a dick.

1:00:56.040 --> 1:00:59.520
 But I feel like platforms have a role to be like,

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:00.800
 just be nicer.

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:04.160
 Maybe do the carrot, like encourage people to be nicer

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:06.760
 as opposed to the stake of censorship.

1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.020
 But I think it's an interesting machine learning problem.

1:01:11.020 --> 1:01:11.980
 Just be nicer.

1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:15.760
 Machine, yeah, machine learning for niceness.

1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:16.600
 It is, I mean, that's...

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:17.880
 Responsible, yeah, I mean, it is.

1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:20.080
 It is a thing, for sure.

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:22.080
 Jack Dorsey kind of talks about it

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:23.880
 as a vision for Twitter is,

1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:26.760
 how do we increase the health of conversations?

1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:28.060
 I don't know how seriously

1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:30.720
 they're actually trying to do that though.

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:35.720
 Which is one of the reasons that I'm in part considering

1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:37.240
 entering that space a little bit.

1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:38.480
 It's difficult for them, right?

1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:40.520
 Because, you know, it's kind of like well known

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:45.520
 that people are kind of driven by rage

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:49.400
 and you know, outrage maybe is a better word, right?

1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:51.840
 Outrage drives engagement.

1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:55.560
 And well, these companies are judged by engagement, right?

1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:56.400
 So it's...

1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.160
 In the short term, but this goes to the metrics thing

1:01:58.160 --> 1:01:59.320
 that we were talking about earlier.

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:02.240
 I do believe, I have a fundamental belief

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:06.140
 that if you have a metric of long term happiness

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:09.520
 of your users, like not short term engagement,

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:11.440
 but long term happiness and growth

1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:15.520
 and both like intellectual, emotional health of your users,

1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:17.600
 you're going to make a lot more money.

1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:18.840
 You're going to have long...

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.400
 Like you should be able to optimize for that.

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:24.280
 You don't need to necessarily optimize for engagement.

1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:26.400
 And that'll be good for society too.

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:28.800
 Yeah, no, I mean, I generally agree with you,

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:32.400
 but it requires a patient person with, you know,

1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:35.520
 trust from Wall Street to be able

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:36.720
 to carry out such a strategy.

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:39.240
 This is what I believe the Steve Jobs character

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:41.920
 and Elon Musk character is like,

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:45.240
 you basically have to be so good at your job.

1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:46.960
 Right, you got to pass for anything.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.680
 That you can hold the board

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:52.000
 and all the investors hostage by saying like,

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.360
 either we do it my way or I leave.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:59.120
 And everyone is too afraid of you to leave

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.360
 because they believe in your vision.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:04.280
 But that requires being really good at what you do.

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:06.680
 It requires being Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:09.280
 There's kind of a reason why like a third name doesn't

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:10.840
 come immediately to mind, right?

1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:12.360
 Like there's maybe a handful of other people,

1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:13.440
 but it's not that many.

1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:14.280
 It's not many.

1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:15.480
 I mean, people say like, why are you...

1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:18.320
 Like people say that I'm like a fan of Elon Musk.

1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:20.960
 I'm not, I'm a fan of anybody

1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:23.080
 who's like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:26.320
 And there's just not many of those folks.

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:27.640
 It's the guy that made us believe

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:31.040
 that like we can get to Mars, you know, in 10 years, right?

1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:32.480
 I mean, that's kind of awesome.

1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:35.280
 And it's kind of making it happen, which is like...

1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:40.280
 And it's kind of gone like that kind of like spirit, right?

1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:42.240
 Like from a lot of our society, right?

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:44.640
 You know, like we can get to the moon in 10 years

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:45.640
 and like we did it, right?

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:46.480
 Yeah.

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:51.480
 Especially in this time of so much kind of existential dread

1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:55.440
 that people are going through because of COVID,

1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:58.520
 like having rockets that just keep going out there

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:00.400
 now with humans.

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:03.200
 I don't know that it, just like you said,

1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:05.520
 I mean, it gives you a reason to wake up in the morning

1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:08.560
 and dream, for us engineers too.

1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:13.120
 It is inspiring as hell, man.

1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:17.080
 Let me ask you this, the worst possible question,

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:21.280
 which is, so you're like at the core, you're a programmer,

1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:26.280
 you're an engineer, but now you made the unfortunate choice

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:30.680
 or maybe that's the way life goes

1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:35.080
 of basically moving away from the low level work

1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:38.080
 and becoming a manager, becoming an executive,

1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:43.080
 having meetings, what's that transition been like?

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:44.040
 It's been interesting.

1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:44.880
 It's been a journey.

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:46.840
 Maybe a couple of things to say about that.

1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:49.280
 I mean, I got into this, right?

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:54.280
 Because as a kid, I just remember this like incredible

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:57.320
 amazement at being able to write a program, right?

1:04:57.320 --> 1:05:01.200
 And something comes to life that kind of didn't exist before.

1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:03.920
 I don't think you have that in like many other fields,

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:07.880
 like you have that with some other kinds of engineering,

1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.640
 but you're maybe a little bit more limited

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:10.680
 with what you can do, right?

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:11.640
 But with a computer,

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:14.760
 you can literally imagine any kind of program, right?

1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:16.960
 So it's a little bit godlike what you do

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:18.160
 like when you create it.

1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:21.320
 And so, I mean, that's why I got into it.

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:23.200
 Do you remember like first program you wrote

1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:25.800
 or maybe the first program that like made you fall in love

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:27.480
 with computer science?

1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:29.400
 I don't know what was the first program.

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.840
 It's probably like trying to write one of those games

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:34.040
 and basic, you know, like emulate the snake game

1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:35.400
 or whatever.

1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:37.800
 I don't remember to be honest, but I enjoyed like,

1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:40.000
 that's why I always loved about, you know,

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.800
 being a programmer, it's just the creation process.

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:43.800
 And it's a little bit different

1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:46.160
 when you're not the one doing the creating.

1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:50.480
 And, you know, another aspect to it I would say is,

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:52.040
 you know, when you're a programmer,

1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:54.160
 when you're a individual contributor,

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:57.800
 it's kind of very easy to know when you're doing a good job,

1:05:57.800 --> 1:05:58.640
 when you're not doing a good job,

1:05:58.640 --> 1:05:59.480
 when you're being productive,

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:00.360
 when you're not being productive, right?

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:03.000
 You can kind of see like you trying to make something

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.560
 and it's like slowly coming together, right?

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:08.880
 And when you're a manager, you know, it's more diffuse,

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:09.720
 right?

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:12.760
 Like, well, you hope, you know, you're motivating your team

1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:15.920
 and making them more productive and inspiring them, right?

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:18.920
 But it's not like you get some kind of like dopamine signal

1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:22.440
 because you like completed X lines of code, you know, today.

1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:24.040
 So kind of like you missed that dopamine rush

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:28.040
 a little bit when you first become,

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:30.440
 but then, you know, slowly you kind of see,

1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:32.360
 yes, your teams are doing amazing work, right?

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:34.720
 And you can take pride in that.

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:38.240
 You can get like, what is it?

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:41.640
 Like a ripple effect of somebody else's dopamine rush.

1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:44.600
 Yeah, yeah, you live off other people's dopamine.

1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:50.800
 So is there pain points and challenges you had to overcome

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:54.240
 from becoming, from going to a programmer to becoming

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.960
 a programmer of humans?

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:57.480
 Programmer of humans.

1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:00.960
 I don't know, humans are difficult to understand,

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:03.640
 you know, it's like one of those things,

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:06.720
 like trying to understand other people's motivations

1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:08.200
 and what really drives them.

1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:10.840
 It's difficult, maybe like never really know, right?

1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:13.320
 Do you find that people are different?

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:14.160
 Yeah.

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:18.680
 Like I, one of the things, like I had a group at MIT

1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:23.680
 that, you know, I found that like some people

1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:29.680
 I could like scream at and criticize like hard

1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:32.800
 and that made them do like much better work

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:35.160
 and really push them to their limit.

1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:39.080
 And there's some people that I had to nonstop compliment

1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:42.800
 because like they're so already self critical,

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:45.840
 like about everything they do that I have to be constantly

1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:50.840
 like, like I cannot criticize them at all

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.840
 because they're already criticizing themselves

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:54.760
 and you have to kind of encourage

1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:58.080
 and like celebrate their little victories.

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:00.960
 And it's kind of fascinating that like how that,

1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:03.480
 the complete difference in people.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:06.400
 Definitely people respond to different motivations

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:07.600
 and different loads of feedback

1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:10.720
 and you kind of have to figure it out.

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:13.080
 It was like a pretty good book,

1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.440
 which for some reason now the name escapes me,

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:18.800
 about management, first break all the rules.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:19.720
 First break all the rules?

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:20.800
 First break all the rules.

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:23.880
 It's a book that we generally like ask a lot of

1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:26.320
 like first time managers to read it rough.

1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:28.760
 And like one of the kind of philosophies

1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:31.080
 is managed by exception, right?

1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:34.440
 Which is, you know, don't like have some standard template

1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:36.920
 like, you know, here's how I, you know,

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.160
 tell this person to do this or the other thing.

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:41.240
 Here's how I get feedback, like manage by exception, right?

1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:42.800
 Every person is a little bit different.

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.280
 You have to try to understand what drives them.

1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:47.200
 And tailor it to them.

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:48.880
 Since you mentioned books,

1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:50.800
 I don't know if you can answer this question,

1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:53.600
 but people love it when I ask it, which is,

1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:56.880
 are there books, technical fiction or philosophical

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:59.800
 that you enjoyed or had an impact on your life

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.320
 that you would recommend?

1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:04.400
 You already mentioned Dune, like all of the Dune.

1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:05.360
 All of the Dune.

1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:07.080
 The second one was probably the weakest, but anyway,

1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:09.760
 so yeah, all of the Dune is good.

1:09:09.760 --> 1:09:13.440
 I mean, yeah, can you just slow little tangent on that?

1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.280
 Is, how many Dune books are there?

1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:18.440
 Like, do you recommend people start with the first one

1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:19.880
 if that was?

1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.040
 Yeah, you gotta have to read them all.

1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:23.240
 I mean, it is a complete story, right?

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.440
 So you start with the first one,

1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:27.520
 you gotta read all of them.

1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:31.640
 So it's not like a tree, like a creation of like

1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:33.880
 the universe that you should go in sequence?

1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:35.200
 You should go in sequence, yeah.

1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:38.000
 It's kind of a chronological storyline.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.120
 There's six books in all.

1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:43.720
 Then there's like many kind of books

1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:47.880
 that were written by Frank Herbert's son,

1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:48.840
 but those are not as good.

1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:50.880
 So you don't have to bother with those.

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:51.720
 Shots fired.

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:52.920
 Shots fired.

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:53.760
 Okay.

1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:56.280
 But the main sequence is good.

1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:57.680
 So what are some other books?

1:09:58.840 --> 1:09:59.680
 Maybe there's a few.

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:02.000
 So I don't know that like, I would say there's a book

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:05.440
 that kind of, I don't know, turned my life around

1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:07.880
 or anything like that, but here's a couple

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:08.960
 that I really love.

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:13.400
 So one is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.

1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:20.160
 And it's kind of incredible how prescient he was

1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:25.160
 about like what a brave new world might be like, right?

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:28.200
 You know, you kind of see genetic sorting in this book,

1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:30.720
 right, where there's like these alphas and epsilons

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:34.920
 and how from like the earliest time of society,

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.760
 like they're sort of like, you can kind of see it

1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:39.640
 in a slightly similar way today where,

1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:42.720
 well, one of the problems with society is people

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:45.960
 are kind of genetically sorting a little bit, right?

1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:48.960
 Like there's much less, like most marriages, right,

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:53.360
 are between people of similar kind of intellectual level

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:57.560
 or socioeconomic status, more so these days than in the past.

1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.080
 And you kind of see some effects of it

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.720
 in stratifying society and kind of he illustrated

1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:05.840
 what that could be like in the extreme.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:07.920
 There's different versions of it on social media as well.

1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:09.840
 It's not just like marriages and so on.

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:13.440
 Like it's genetic sorting in terms of what Dawkins called

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:17.320
 memes as ideas being put into these bins

1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:20.000
 of these little echo chambers and so on.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.440
 Yeah, I know, so that's the book

1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:23.560
 that's I think a worthwhile read for everyone.

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.240
 I mean, 1984 is good, of course, as well.

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:26.520
 Like if you're talking about, you know,

1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.200
 dystopian novels of the future.

1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:30.520
 Yeah, it's a slightly different view of the future, right?

1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:33.600
 But I kind of like identify with Brave New World a bit more.

1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:38.040
 Yeah, speaking of not a book,

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:41.480
 but my favorite kind of dystopian science fiction

1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:42.600
 is a movie called Brazil,

1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:44.160
 which I don't know if you've heard of.

1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:46.320
 I've heard of and I know I need to watch it,

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:50.520
 but yeah, because it's in, is it in English or no?

1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:52.120
 It's an English movie, yeah.

1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:55.800
 And it's a sort of like dystopian movie

1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:58.640
 of authoritarian incompetence, right?

1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:03.640
 It's like nothing really works very well, you know,

1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:05.720
 the system is creaky, you know,

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.800
 but no one is kind of like willing to challenge it,

1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:10.040
 you know, just things kind of ample along

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:13.680
 and kind of strikes me as like a very plausible future

1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:16.840
 of like, you know, what authoritarianism might look like.

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:19.240
 It's not like this, you know,

1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:21.880
 super efficient evil dictatorship of 1984.

1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:25.240
 It's just kind of like this badly functioning, you know,

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:30.080
 but it's status quo, so it just goes on.

1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:33.520
 Yeah, that's one funny thing that stands out to me

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:37.120
 is in whether it's authoritarian, dystopian stuff,

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:39.480
 or just basic like, you know,

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:42.400
 if you look at the movie Contagion,

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:44.480
 it seems in the movies,

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:48.120
 government is almost always exceptionally competent.

1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.200
 Like it's like used as a storytelling tool

1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:55.480
 of like extreme competence.

1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:58.360
 Like, you know, you use it whether it's good or evil,

1:12:58.360 --> 1:12:59.680
 but it's competent.

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.840
 It's very interesting to think about

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:06.440
 where much more realistically is it's incompetence

1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:11.280
 and that incompetence isn't itself has consequences

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:13.200
 that are difficult to predict.

1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:18.000
 Like bureaucracy has a very boring way of being evil,

1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:21.400
 of just, you know, if you look at the show,

1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:23.160
 HBO show at Chernobyl,

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:28.160
 it's a really good story of how bureaucracy, you know,

1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:32.800
 leads to catastrophic events,

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:34.320
 but not through any kind of evil

1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:36.200
 in any one particular place,

1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:37.720
 but more just like the...

1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:40.040
 It's just the system kind of system.

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:43.280
 Distorting information as it travels up the chain

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:46.040
 that people unwilling to take responsibility for things

1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:50.960
 and just kind of like this laziness resulting in evil.

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.320
 There's a comedic version of this,

1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:53.600
 I don't know if you've seen this movie,

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:54.960
 it's called The Death of Stalin.

1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:58.080
 Yeah, I liked that.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.080
 I wish it wasn't so...

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:02.360
 There's a movie called Inglourious Bastards

1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:06.280
 about, you know, Hitler and so on.

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:09.640
 For some reason, those movies pissed me off.

1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:11.120
 I know a lot of people love them,

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:16.120
 but like, I just feel like there's not enough good movies,

1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:18.520
 even about Hitler.

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:21.400
 There's good movies about the Holocaust,

1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:23.640
 but even Hitler, there's a movie called Dawnfall

1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:24.480
 that people should watch.

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:26.080
 I think it's the last few days of Hitler.

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:30.440
 That's a good movie, turned into a meme, but it's good.

1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:33.760
 But on Stalin, I feel like I may be wrong on this,

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:35.520
 but at least in the English speaking world,

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:38.760
 there's not good movies about the evil of Stalin.

1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:39.600
 That's true.

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:40.640
 Let's try to see that.

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:43.320
 Actually, so I agree with you on Inglourious Bastard.

1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:44.480
 I didn't love the movie

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.000
 because I felt like kind of the stylizing of it, right?

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:55.000
 The whole Tarantino kind of Tarantinoism, if you will,

1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:56.080
 kind of detracted from it

1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:58.400
 and made it seem like unserious a little bit.

1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:02.240
 But Death of Stalin, I felt differently.

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:03.800
 Maybe it's because it's a comedy to begin with.

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:06.560
 This is not like I'm expecting seriousness,

1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:10.760
 but it kind of depicted the absurdity

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:13.360
 of the whole situation in a way, right?

1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:15.280
 I mean, it was funny, so maybe it does make light of it,

1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:18.200
 but something goes probably like this, right?

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:20.440
 Like a bunch of kind of people,

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:22.440
 they're like, oh shit, right?

1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:23.280
 You're right.

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:25.440
 But like the thing is,

1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:30.440
 it was so close to like what probably was reality.

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:35.480
 It was caricaturing reality

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:39.320
 to where I think an observer might think that this is not,

1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:41.560
 like they might think it's a comedy.

1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:45.560
 Well, in reality, that's the absurdity

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:48.800
 of how people act with dictators.

1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.800
 I mean, that's, I guess it was too close to reality for me.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:57.720
 The kind of banality of like what were eventually

1:15:57.720 --> 1:15:59.440
 like fairly evil acts, right?

1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.280
 But like, yeah, they're just a bunch of people

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:03.160
 trying to survive.

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:05.440
 Cause I think there's a good,

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:07.560
 I haven't watched it yet, the good movie on,

1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:12.440
 the movie on Churchill with Gary Oldman,

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.000
 I think it's Gary Oldman.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.400
 I may be making that up.

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:16.240
 But I think he won,

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:17.960
 like he was nominated for an Oscar or something.

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:20.960
 So I like, I love these movies about these humans

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:25.960
 and Stalin, like Chernobyl made me realize the HBO show

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.760
 that there's not enough movies about Russia

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:33.040
 that capture that spirit.

1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:35.640
 I'm sure it might be in Russian there is,

1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:39.280
 but the fact that some British dude that like did comedy,

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:42.120
 I feel like he did like hangover or some shit like that.

1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:43.080
 I don't know if you're familiar

1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:44.400
 with the person who created Chernobyl,

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:45.720
 but he was just like some guy

1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:47.320
 that doesn't know anything about Russia.

1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:49.760
 And he just went in and just studied it,

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.880
 like did a good job of creating it

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:56.080
 and then got it so accurate, like poetically.

1:16:56.080 --> 1:16:58.880
 And the facts that you need to get accurate,

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:01.120
 he got accurate, just the spirit of it

1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:03.760
 down to like the bowls that pets use,

1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.080
 just the whole feel of it.

1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:05.920
 It was incredible.

1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:07.480
 It was good, yeah, I saw the series.

1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:08.640
 Yeah, it's incredible.

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:10.920
 It's made me wish that somebody did a good,

1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:15.920
 like 1930s, like starvation that Stalin led to,

1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:20.160
 like leading up to World War II

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:23.680
 and in World War II itself, like Stalingrad and so on.

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:27.520
 Like, I feel like that story needs to be told.

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:30.080
 Millions of people died.

1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:32.800
 And to me, it's so much more fascinating than Hitler

1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:37.560
 because Hitler is like a caricature of evil almost

1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:41.800
 that it's so, especially with the Holocaust,

1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:45.520
 it's so difficult to imagine that something like that

1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:47.520
 is possible ever again.

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:52.520
 Stalin to me represents something that is possible.

1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:56.720
 Like the so interesting, like the bureaucracy of it

1:17:56.720 --> 1:18:01.200
 is so fascinating that it potentially might be happening

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.200
 in the world now, like that we're not aware of,

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:06.120
 like with North Korea, another one that,

1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:08.240
 like there should be a good film on.

1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:10.640
 And like the possible things that could be happening

1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.080
 in China with overreach of government.

1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:15.600
 I don't know, there's a lot of possibilities there.

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:16.440
 I suppose.

1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:18.320
 Yeah, I wonder how much, you know,

1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:20.440
 I guess the archives should be maybe more open nowadays,

1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:22.960
 right, I mean, for a long time, they just, we didn't know,

1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:25.920
 right, or anyways, no one in the West knew for sure.

1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:27.560
 Well, there's a, I don't know if you know him,

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:29.440
 there's a guy named Stephen Kotkin.

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:33.080
 He is a historian of Stalin that I spoke to on this podcast.

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:34.760
 I'll speak to him again.

1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:38.040
 The guy knows his shit on Stalin.

1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:43.040
 He like read everything and it's so fascinating

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:49.160
 to talk to somebody, like he knows Stalin better

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.000
 than Stalin himself, it's crazy.

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.440
 Like you have, so he's, I think he's a Princeton,

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:58.840
 he is basically, his whole life is Stalin.

1:18:58.840 --> 1:18:59.760
 Fighting Stalin.

1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:00.920
 Yeah, it's great.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:03.640
 And in that context, he also talks about

1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:06.040
 and writes about Putin a little bit.

1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:07.880
 I've also read at this point,

1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:12.360
 I think every biography of Putin, English biography of Putin,

1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:14.000
 I need to read some Russians.

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.400
 Obviously, I'm mentally preparing

1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:17.000
 for a possible conversation with Putin.

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.400
 So what is your first question to Putin

1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:22.480
 when you have him on the podcast?

1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:26.400
 I, it's interesting you bring that up.

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:27.920
 First of all, I wouldn't tell you, but.

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:30.680
 You can't give it away now.

1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:34.360
 But I actually haven't even thought about that.

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:38.760
 So my current approach, and I do this with interviews often,

1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:40.160
 obviously that's a special one,

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:44.240
 but I try not to think about questions until last minute.

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:48.640
 I'm trying to sort of get into the mindset.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.280
 And so that's why I'm soaking in a lot of stuff,

1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:56.120
 not thinking about questions, just learning about the man.

1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:59.680
 But in terms of like human to human,

1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:01.360
 it's like, I would say it's,

1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:03.440
 I don't know if you're a fan of mob movies,

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:07.000
 but like the mafia, which I am, like Goodfellas and so on,

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:11.960
 he's much closer to like mob morality, which is like.

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:14.000
 Mob morality, maybe, I could see that.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.600
 But I like your approach anyways of this,

1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:18.160
 the extreme empathy, right?

1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:21.360
 It's a little bit like Hannibal, right?

1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:22.960
 Like if you ever watched the show Hannibal, right?

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:27.560
 They had that guy, well, you know Hannibal of course, like.

1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:30.200
 Yeah, Silence of the Lambs.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:31.760
 But there were those TV shows as well,

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:34.040
 and they focused on this guy, Will Durant,

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:36.240
 who's a character like extreme empath, right?

1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:38.120
 So in the way he like catches all these killers,

1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:42.520
 as he pretty much, he can empathize with them, right?

1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:44.080
 Like he can understand why they're doing

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:45.560
 the things they're doing, right?

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:48.160
 It's a pretty excruciating thing, right?

1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:49.760
 Like, because you're pretty much like spending

1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:52.360
 half your time in the head of evil people, right?

1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:54.200
 Like, but.

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:57.040
 I mean, I definitely try to do that with others.

1:20:57.040 --> 1:20:59.080
 So you should do that in moderation,

1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:04.080
 but I think it's a pretty safe place, safe place to be.

1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:06.480
 One of the cool things with this podcast,

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:08.760
 and I know you didn't sign up to hear me

1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:10.160
 listen to this bullshit, but.

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:11.920
 That was interesting.

1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:15.480
 I, and what's his name?

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:17.640
 Chris Latner, who's a Google,

1:21:17.640 --> 1:21:19.120
 oh, he's not Google anymore, SciFi.

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:21.040
 He's legit, he's one of the most legit engineers

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:23.360
 I talk with, I talk with him again on this podcast.

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:27.200
 And one of the, he gives me private advice a lot.

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:31.240
 And he said for this podcast, I should like interview,

1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:34.640
 like I should widen the range of people

1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:38.200
 because that gives you much more freedom to do stuff.

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:41.560
 Like, so his idea, which I think I agree with Chris

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:44.040
 is that you go to the extremes.

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:46.080
 You just like cover every extreme base

1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:48.200
 and then it gives you freedom to then go

1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:50.440
 to the more nuanced conversations.

1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:53.920
 And it's kind of, I think there's a safe place for that.

1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:56.640
 There's certainly a hunger for that nuanced conversation,

1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:00.400
 I think, amongst people where like on social media,

1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:04.040
 you get canceled for anything slightly tense,

1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:06.040
 that there's a hunger to go full.

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:08.360
 Right, you go so far to the opposite side.

1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:10.720
 And that's like demystifies it a little bit, right?

1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:11.560
 Yeah, that's.

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.080
 There is a person behind all of these things.

1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:17.280
 And that's the cool thing about podcasting,

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:19.280
 like three, four hour conversations

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:24.120
 that it's very different than a clickbait journalism,

1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:26.680
 it's like the opposite, that there's a hunger for that.

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:28.040
 There's a willingness for that.

1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:29.440
 Yeah, especially now, I mean,

1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:31.840
 how many people do you even see face to face anymore?

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.320
 Right, like this, you know?

1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:36.080
 It's like not that many people like in my day today,

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.240
 aside from my own family that like I sit across.

1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:41.520
 It's sad, but it's also beautiful.

1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:44.200
 Like I've gotten the chance to like,

1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:47.080
 like our conversation now, there's somebody,

1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:50.000
 I guarantee you there's somebody in Russia

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.240
 listening to this now, like jogging.

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:55.280
 There's somebody who is just smoked some weed,

1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:58.440
 sit back on a couch and just like enjoying.

1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:00.720
 I guarantee you that we'll write in the comments right now

1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:05.000
 that yes, I'm in St. Petersburg, I'm in Moscow, whatever.

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:10.000
 And we're in their head and they have a friendship with us.

1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:13.280
 I'm the same way, I'm a huge fan of podcasting.

1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:15.560
 It's a beautiful thing.

1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:18.160
 I mean, it's a weird one way human connection.

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:22.200
 Like before I went on Joe Rogan and still,

1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:24.120
 I'm just a huge fan of his.

1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:25.760
 So it was like surreal.

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:28.960
 I've been friends with Joe Rogan for 10 years, but one way.

1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:31.760
 Yeah, from this way, from the St. Petersburg way.

1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:34.960
 Yeah, the St. Petersburg way and it's a real friendship.

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:38.760
 I mean, now it's like two way, but it's still surreal.

1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:40.480
 And that's the magic of podcasting.

1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:42.040
 I'm not sure what to make of it.

1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:45.320
 That voice, it's not even the video part.

1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:48.560
 It's the audio that's magical.

1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:50.200
 I don't know what to do with it,

1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:53.080
 but it's people listen to three, four hours.

1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:57.440
 Yeah, we evolved over millions of years, right?

1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:00.480
 To be very fine tuned to things like that, right?

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:02.520
 Oh, expressions as well, of course, right?

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:06.960
 But back in the day on the Savannah,

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:09.360
 you had to be very attuned to whether

1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:11.840
 you had a good relationship with the rest of your tribe

1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:13.440
 or a very bad relationship, right?

1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:15.160
 Because if you had a very bad relationship,

1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:17.400
 you were probably gonna be left behind

1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:18.800
 and eaten by the lions.

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:22.600
 Yeah, but it's weird that the tribe is different now.

1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:26.040
 Like you could have a one way connection with Joe Rogan

1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:30.520
 as opposed to the tribe of your physical vicinity.

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:33.280
 But that's why it works with the podcasting,

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:35.960
 but it's the opposite of what happens on Twitter, right?

1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:38.080
 Because all those nuances are removed, right?

1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:40.760
 You're not connecting with the person

1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:42.720
 because you don't hear the voice.

1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.400
 You're connecting with like an abstraction, right?

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.400
 It's like some stream of tweets, right?

1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:52.560
 And it's very easy to assign to them

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:56.720
 any kind of evil intent or dehumanize them,

1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:59.120
 which it's much harder to do when it's a real voice, right?

1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:02.720
 Because you realize it's a real person behind the voice.

1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:05.000
 Let me try this out on you.

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.160
 I sometimes ask about the meaning of life.

1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:12.160
 Do you, your father now, an engineer,

1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:14.040
 you're building up a company.

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.840
 Do you ever zoom out and think like,

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.360
 what the hell is this whole thing for?

1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:24.000
 Like why are we descended to vapes even on this planet?

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.120
 What's the meaning of it all?

1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:28.120
 That's a pretty big question.

1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:32.240
 I think I don't allow myself to think about it too often,

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:34.320
 or maybe like life doesn't allow me

1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:35.800
 to think about it too often.

1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:39.080
 But in some ways, I guess the meaning of life

1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:44.040
 is kind of contributing to this kind of weird thing

1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:45.320
 we call humanity, right?

1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:47.640
 Like it's in a way, you can think of humanity

1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:50.200
 as like a living and evolving organism, right?

1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:52.560
 That like we all contributing in a sway way,

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:55.640
 but just by existing, by having our own unique set

1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:57.320
 of desires and drives, right?

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:01.640
 And maybe that means like creating something great.

1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:06.200
 And it's bringing up kids who are unique and different

1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:09.680
 and seeing like, they can join what they do.

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:11.040
 But I mean, to me, that's pretty much it.

1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:13.160
 I mean, if you're not a religious person, right?

1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:16.400
 Which I guess I'm not, that's the meaning of life.

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:20.880
 It's in the living and in the creation.

1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:22.400
 Yeah, there's something magical

1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.160
 about that engine of creation.

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:27.240
 Like you said, programming, I would say,

1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:29.400
 I mean, it's even just actually what you said

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:30.520
 with even just programs.

1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:32.760
 I don't care if it's like some JavaScript thing

1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:36.000
 on a button on the website.

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.960
 It's like magical that you brought that to life.

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.520
 I don't know what that is in there, but that seems,

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:46.520
 that's probably some version of like reproduction

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:49.760
 and sex, whatever that's in evolution.

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:54.760
 But like creating that HTML button has echoes

1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:57.760
 of that feeling and it's magical.

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:00.640
 Right, well, I mean, if you're a religious person,

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:01.720
 maybe you could even say, all right,

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:04.360
 like we were created in God's image, right?

1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:07.240
 Well, I mean, I guess part of that is the drive

1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.200
 to create something ourselves, right?

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.760
 I mean, that's part of it.

1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:15.800
 Yeah, that HTML button is the creation in God's image.

1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:18.880
 Maybe hopefully it'll be something a little more.

1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.960
 So dynamic, maybe some JavaScript.

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:25.400
 Yeah, maybe some JavaScript, some React and so on.

1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:29.400
 But no, I mean, I think that's what differentiates us

1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:32.160
 from the apes, so to speak.

1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:34.240
 Yeah, we did a pretty good job.

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:36.960
 Dan, it was an honor to talk to you.

1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.760
 Thank you so much for being part of creating

1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:42.000
 one of my favorite services and products.

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.040
 This is actually a little bit of an experiment.

1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:49.840
 Allow me to sort of fanboy over some of the things I love.

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:52.280
 So thanks for wasting your time with me today.

1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:53.120
 It was really fun.

1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:53.960
 Well, it was awesome.

1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.520
 Thanks for having me on and giving me a chance

1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:57.200
 to try this out.

1:27:57.200 --> 1:27:58.040
 Awesome.

1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:29.840
 from Ludwig Wittgenstein.

1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:33.720
 The limits of my language means the limits of my world.

1:28:33.720 --> 1:29:00.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
