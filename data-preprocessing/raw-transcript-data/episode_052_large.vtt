00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
 The following is a conversation with Gilbert Strang.

00:03.320 --> 00:05.760
 He's a professor of mathematics at MIT

00:05.760 --> 00:07.480
 and perhaps one of the most famous

00:07.480 --> 00:10.600
 and impactful teachers of math in the world.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.640
 His MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on linear algebra

00:13.640 --> 00:15.920
 have been viewed millions of times.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.480
 As an undergraduate student,

00:17.480 --> 00:19.960
 I was one of those millions of students.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.760
 There's something inspiring about the way he teaches.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.120
 There's at once calm, simple, and yet full of passion

00:26.120 --> 00:29.080
 for the elegance inherent to mathematics.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.200
 I remember doing the exercise in his book,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.000
 Introduction to Linear Algebra,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.880
 and slowly realizing that the world of matrices,

00:35.880 --> 00:39.360
 of vector spaces, of determinants and eigenvalues,

00:39.360 --> 00:43.040
 of geometric transformations and matrix decompositions

00:43.040 --> 00:45.120
 reveal a set of powerful tools

00:45.120 --> 00:47.920
 in the toolbox of artificial intelligence.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.720
 From signals to images,

00:49.720 --> 00:51.920
 from numerical optimization to robotics,

00:51.920 --> 00:54.880
 computer vision, deep learning, computer graphics,

00:54.880 --> 00:56.600
 and everywhere outside AI,

00:56.600 --> 01:00.080
 including, of course, a quantum mechanical study

01:00.080 --> 01:01.520
 of our universe.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.440
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.040
 This podcast is supported by ZipRecruiter.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.200
 Hiring great people is hard,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.280
 and to me is the most important element

01:23.280 --> 01:26.080
 of a successful mission driven team.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.120
 I've been fortunate to be a part of

01:28.120 --> 01:30.720
 and to lead several great engineering teams.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.680
 The hiring I've done in the past

01:32.680 --> 01:35.400
 was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,

01:35.400 --> 01:38.400
 but reinventing the wheel was painful.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.240
 ZipRecruiter is a tool that's already available for you.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.000
 It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.960
 For example, Codable cofounder Gretchen Huebner

01:47.960 --> 01:50.400
 used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist

01:50.400 --> 01:52.720
 to join her education tech company.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.840
 By using ZipRecruiter's screening questions

01:54.840 --> 01:56.280
 to filter candidates,

01:56.280 --> 01:59.080
 Gretchen found it easier to focus on the best candidates

01:59.080 --> 02:02.440
 and finally hiring the perfect person for the role

02:02.440 --> 02:05.440
 in less than two weeks from start to finish.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.560
 ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.200
 See why ZipRecruiter is effective

02:10.200 --> 02:12.680
 for businesses of all sizes by signing up,

02:12.680 --> 02:17.600
 as I did, for free at ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.360
 That's ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.360
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:24.360 --> 02:26.880
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.640
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:29.640 --> 02:33.080
 but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.880
 Most Bitcoin exchanges take days

02:34.880 --> 02:37.120
 for a bank transfer to become investable.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.480
 Through Cash App, it takes seconds.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.840
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.600
 You can buy fractions of a stock,

02:44.600 --> 02:47.320
 which to me is a really interesting concept.

02:47.320 --> 02:51.600
 So you can buy $1 worth no matter what the stock price is.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.520
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:54.520 --> 02:58.320
 a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.120
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

03:00.120 --> 03:02.800
 to support one of my favorite organizations

03:02.800 --> 03:05.720
 that many of you may know and have benefited from,

03:05.720 --> 03:09.200
 called First, best known for their first robotics

03:09.200 --> 03:10.840
 and Lego competitions.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.560
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

03:14.560 --> 03:16.520
 in over 110 countries,

03:16.520 --> 03:19.000
 and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.600
 which means the donated money is used

03:21.600 --> 03:23.920
 to maximum effectiveness.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.920
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.400
 and use code LexPodcast,

03:29.400 --> 03:33.200
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.200
 which again, is an organization

03:35.200 --> 03:38.000
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
 to dream of engineering a better world.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.740
 And now, here's my conversation with Gilbert Strang.

03:44.740 --> 03:49.740
 How does it feel to be one of the modern day rock stars

03:50.500 --> 03:51.760
 of mathematics?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.900
 I don't feel like a rock star.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.340
 That's kind of crazy for an old math person.

03:57.340 --> 04:02.340
 But it's true that the videos in linear algebra

04:03.540 --> 04:07.180
 that I made way back in 2000, I think,

04:08.540 --> 04:09.880
 have been watched a lot.

04:09.880 --> 04:14.420
 And well, partly the importance of linear algebra,

04:14.420 --> 04:15.940
 which I'm sure you'll ask me,

04:15.940 --> 04:19.220
 and give me a chance to say that linear algebra

04:19.220 --> 04:22.580
 as a subject has just surged in importance.

04:22.580 --> 04:26.460
 But also, it was a class that I taught a bunch of times,

04:26.460 --> 04:31.460
 so I kind of got it organized and enjoyed doing it.

04:32.220 --> 04:34.180
 The videos were just the class.

04:34.180 --> 04:36.740
 So they're on OpenCourseWare and on YouTube

04:36.740 --> 04:38.900
 and translated, and it's fun.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.100
 But there's something about that chalkboard

04:41.100 --> 04:44.460
 and the simplicity of the way you explain

04:44.460 --> 04:46.820
 the basic concepts in the beginning.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.440
 To be honest, when I went to undergrad.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.660
 You didn't do linear algebra, probably.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.980
 Of course I didn't do linear algebra.

04:53.980 --> 04:54.820
 You did.

04:54.820 --> 04:55.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

04:55.640 --> 05:00.640
 But before going through the course at my university,

05:00.940 --> 05:02.540
 there was going through OpenCourseWare.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.620
 You were my instructor for linear algebra.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.500
 Right, yeah.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.560
 And that, I mean, we're using your book.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.560
 And I mean, the fact that there is thousands,

05:13.100 --> 05:14.860
 hundreds of thousands, millions of people

05:14.860 --> 05:18.260
 that watch that video, I think that's really powerful.

05:18.260 --> 05:23.260
 So how do you think the idea of putting lectures online,

05:23.700 --> 05:27.260
 what really MIT OpenCourseWare has innovated?

05:27.260 --> 05:29.140
 That was a wonderful idea.

05:29.140 --> 05:34.140
 I think the story that I've heard is the committee

05:34.140 --> 05:37.740
 was appointed by the president, President Vest,

05:37.740 --> 05:40.020
 at that time, a wonderful guy.

05:40.020 --> 05:43.500
 And the idea of the committee was to figure out

05:43.500 --> 05:48.500
 how MIT could be like other universities,

05:48.660 --> 05:52.620
 market the work we were doing.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.500
 And then they didn't see a way.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.300
 And after a weekend, and they had an inspiration,

05:57.300 --> 06:00.020
 came back to President Vest and said,

06:00.020 --> 06:02.260
 what if we just gave it away?

06:02.260 --> 06:07.260
 And he decided that was okay, good idea.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.540
 So.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.660
 You know, that's a crazy idea.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.740
 If we think of a university as a thing

06:12.740 --> 06:16.060
 that creates a product, isn't knowledge,

06:17.780 --> 06:19.580
 the kind of educational knowledge,

06:19.580 --> 06:22.660
 isn't the product and giving that away,

06:22.660 --> 06:26.140
 are you surprised that it went through?

06:26.140 --> 06:28.300
 The result that he did it,

06:28.300 --> 06:32.300
 well, knowing a little bit President Vest, it was like him,

06:32.300 --> 06:36.420
 I think, and it was really the right idea.

06:38.780 --> 06:43.220
 MIT is a kind of, it's known for being high level,

06:43.220 --> 06:48.220
 technical things, and this is the best way we can say,

06:48.300 --> 06:52.580
 tell, we can show what MIT really is like,

06:52.580 --> 06:57.380
 because in my case, those 1806 videos

06:57.380 --> 06:59.940
 are just teaching the class.

06:59.940 --> 07:03.660
 They were there in 26, 100.

07:03.660 --> 07:04.860
 They're kind of fun to look at.

07:04.860 --> 07:08.300
 People write to me and say, oh, you've got a sense of humor,

07:08.300 --> 07:10.940
 but I don't know where that comes through.

07:10.940 --> 07:15.140
 Somehow I'm friendly with the class, I like students.

07:15.140 --> 07:19.260
 And then your algebra, the subject,

07:19.260 --> 07:21.700
 we gotta give the subject most of the credit.

07:21.700 --> 07:26.700
 It really has come forward in importance in these years.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.740
 So let's talk about linear algebra a little bit,

07:32.740 --> 07:34.580
 because it is such a, it's both a powerful

07:34.580 --> 07:39.100
 and a beautiful subfield of mathematics.

07:39.100 --> 07:44.100
 So what's your favorite specific topic in linear algebra,

07:44.300 --> 07:46.620
 or even math in general to give a lecture on,

07:46.620 --> 07:50.220
 to convey, to tell a story, to teach students?

07:50.220 --> 07:53.460
 Okay, well, on the teaching side,

07:54.500 --> 07:56.820
 so it's not deep mathematics at all,

07:56.820 --> 08:01.820
 but I'm kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces,

08:02.380 --> 08:05.180
 the four fundamental subspaces,

08:06.460 --> 08:09.660
 which are of course known before,

08:09.660 --> 08:13.660
 long before my name for them, but.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.700
 Can you go through them?

08:14.700 --> 08:15.540
 Can you go through the four subspaces?

08:15.540 --> 08:17.020
 Sure I can, yeah.

08:17.020 --> 08:19.660
 So the first one to understand is,

08:19.660 --> 08:22.900
 so the matrix is, maybe I should say the matrix is.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.780
 What is a matrix?

08:23.780 --> 08:24.860
 What's a matrix?

08:24.860 --> 08:28.500
 Well, so we have like a rectangle of numbers.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.220
 So it's got n columns, got a bunch of columns,

08:32.220 --> 08:36.500
 and also got an m rows, let's say,

08:36.500 --> 08:37.940
 and the relation between,

08:37.940 --> 08:39.860
 so of course the columns and the rows,

08:39.860 --> 08:41.580
 it's the same numbers.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.340
 So there's gotta be connections there,

08:44.340 --> 08:45.660
 but they're not simple.

08:45.660 --> 08:50.060
 The columns might be longer than the rows,

08:50.060 --> 08:53.700
 and they're all different, the numbers are mixed up.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.740
 First space to think about is take the columns,

08:57.740 --> 09:01.860
 so those are vectors, those are points in n dimensions.

09:01.860 --> 09:02.700
 What's a vector?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.660
 So a physicist would imagine a vector

09:05.660 --> 09:10.660
 or might imagine a vector as a arrow in space

09:10.860 --> 09:14.820
 or the point it ends at in space.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.260
 For me, it's a column of numbers.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.940
 You often think of, this is very interesting

09:20.940 --> 09:23.940
 in terms of linear algebra, in terms of a vector,

09:23.940 --> 09:26.660
 you think a little bit more abstract

09:26.660 --> 09:30.660
 than how it's very commonly used, perhaps.

09:30.660 --> 09:34.700
 You think this arbitrary multidimensional space.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.180
 Right away, I'm in high dimensions.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.020
 Dreamland.

09:39.020 --> 09:40.060
 Yeah, that's right.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.420
 In the lecture, I try to,

09:42.420 --> 09:46.780
 so if you think of two vectors in 10 dimensions,

09:46.780 --> 09:50.420
 I'll do this in class, and I'll readily admit

09:50.420 --> 09:54.380
 that I have no good image in my mind

09:54.380 --> 09:58.260
 of a vector of an arrow in 10 dimensional space,

09:58.260 --> 09:59.220
 but whatever.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.780
 You can add one bunch of 10 numbers

10:03.780 --> 10:05.300
 to another bunch of 10 numbers,

10:05.300 --> 10:08.060
 so you can add a vector to a vector,

10:08.060 --> 10:10.300
 and you can multiply a vector by three,

10:10.300 --> 10:12.180
 and that's, if you know how to do those,

10:12.180 --> 10:14.380
 you've got linear algebra.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.860
 10 dimensions, there's this beautiful thing about math,

10:18.860 --> 10:21.700
 if we look at string theory and all these theories,

10:21.700 --> 10:24.460
 which are really fundamentally derived through math,

10:24.460 --> 10:26.500
 but are very difficult to visualize.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.900
 How do you think about the things,

10:28.900 --> 10:31.140
 like a 10 dimensional vector,

10:31.140 --> 10:33.020
 that we can't really visualize?

10:34.780 --> 10:39.780
 And yet, math reveals some beauty underlying our world

10:39.780 --> 10:43.820
 in that weird thing we can't visualize.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.020
 How do you think about that difference?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.900
 Well, probably, I'm not a very geometric person,

10:48.900 --> 10:51.700
 so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions,

10:51.700 --> 10:53.940
 and the beauty of linear algebra is that

10:55.500 --> 10:58.180
 it goes on to 10 dimensions with no problem.

10:58.180 --> 11:01.220
 I mean, that if you're just seeing what happens

11:01.220 --> 11:04.580
 if you add two vectors in 3D,

11:04.580 --> 11:06.460
 yeah, then you can add them in 10D.

11:06.460 --> 11:10.900
 You're just adding the 10 components.

11:10.900 --> 11:14.860
 So, I can't say that I have a picture,

11:14.860 --> 11:16.860
 but yet I try to push the class

11:16.860 --> 11:21.220
 to think of a flat surface in 10 dimensions.

11:21.220 --> 11:23.420
 So a plane in 10 dimensions,

11:23.420 --> 11:27.180
 and so that's one of the spaces.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.900
 Take all the columns of the matrix,

11:29.900 --> 11:31.820
 take all their combinations,

11:31.820 --> 11:35.180
 so much of this column, so much of this one,

11:35.180 --> 11:36.820
 then if you put all those together,

11:36.820 --> 11:39.940
 you get some kind of a flat surface

11:39.940 --> 11:44.700
 that I call a vector space, space of vectors.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.260
 And my imagination is just seeing

11:47.260 --> 11:52.260
 like a piece of paper in 3D, but anyway,

11:52.500 --> 11:55.940
 so that's one of the spaces, that's space number one,

11:55.940 --> 11:58.460
 the column space of the matrix.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.580
 And then there's the row space, which is, as I said,

12:01.580 --> 12:04.740
 different, but came from the same numbers.

12:04.740 --> 12:07.100
 So we got the column space,

12:07.100 --> 12:10.040
 all combinations of the columns,

12:10.040 --> 12:11.960
 and then we've got the row space,

12:11.960 --> 12:14.580
 all combinations of the rows.

12:14.580 --> 12:17.520
 So those words are easy for me to say,

12:17.520 --> 12:20.240
 and I can't really draw them on a blackboard,

12:20.240 --> 12:22.540
 but I try with my thick chalk.

12:22.540 --> 12:27.380
 Everybody likes that railroad chalk, and me too.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.220
 I wouldn't use anything else now.

12:30.220 --> 12:35.060
 And then the other two spaces are perpendicular to those.

12:35.060 --> 12:39.100
 So like if you have a plane in 3D,

12:39.100 --> 12:43.500
 just a plane is just a flat surface in 3D,

12:43.500 --> 12:47.060
 then perpendicular to that plane would be a line.

12:47.060 --> 12:50.200
 So that would be the null space.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.000
 So we've got two, we've got a column space, a row space,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.940
 and there are two perpendicular spaces.

12:56.940 --> 13:01.540
 So those four fit together in a beautiful picture

13:01.540 --> 13:03.740
 of a matrix, yeah, yeah.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.740
 It's sort of a fundamental, it's not a difficult idea.

13:06.740 --> 13:11.240
 It comes pretty early in 1806, and it's basic.

13:12.740 --> 13:16.380
 Planes in these multidimensional spaces,

13:16.380 --> 13:20.140
 how difficult of an idea is that to come to, do you think?

13:20.140 --> 13:23.620
 If you look back in time,

13:23.620 --> 13:26.820
 I think mathematically it makes sense,

13:26.820 --> 13:29.600
 but I don't know if it's intuitive for us to imagine,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.100
 just as we were talking about.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.800
 It feels like calculus is easier to intuit.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.400
 Well, I have to admit, calculus came earlier,

13:38.400 --> 13:39.860
 earlier than linear algebra.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.180
 So Newton and Leibniz were the great men

13:42.180 --> 13:45.800
 to understand the key ideas of calculus.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.100
 But linear algebra to me is like, okay,

13:50.100 --> 13:51.620
 it's the starting point,

13:51.620 --> 13:54.180
 because it's all about flat things.

13:54.180 --> 13:57.160
 Calculus has got, all the complications of calculus

13:57.160 --> 14:02.160
 come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.900
 Linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.060
 Nothing bends in linear algebra.

14:08.060 --> 14:11.660
 So it should have come first, but it didn't.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.660
 And calculus also comes first in high school classes,

14:17.440 --> 14:20.900
 in college class, it'll be freshman math,

14:20.900 --> 14:24.340
 it'll be calculus, and then I say, enough of it.

14:24.340 --> 14:27.820
 Like, okay, get to the good stuff.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.660
 And that's...

14:28.660 --> 14:30.900
 Do you think linear algebra should come first?

14:30.900 --> 14:34.700
 Well, it really, I'm okay with it not coming first,

14:34.700 --> 14:37.100
 but it should, yeah, it should.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.040
 It's simpler.

14:39.060 --> 14:40.180
 Because everything is flat.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.660
 Yeah, everything's flat.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.580
 Well, of course, for that reason,

14:43.580 --> 14:46.620
 calculus sort of sticks to one dimension,

14:46.620 --> 14:49.500
 or eventually you do multivariate,

14:49.500 --> 14:52.260
 but that basically means two dimensions.

14:52.260 --> 14:55.500
 Linear algebra, you take off into 10 dimensions, no problem.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.620
 It just feels scary and dangerous

14:57.620 --> 14:59.840
 to go beyond two dimensions, that's all.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.700
 If everything's flat, you can't go wrong.

15:03.700 --> 15:08.700
 So what concept or theorem in linear algebra or in math

15:09.780 --> 15:12.700
 you find most beautiful,

15:12.700 --> 15:15.420
 that gives you pause that leaves you in awe?

15:15.420 --> 15:18.060
 Well, I'll stick with linear algebra here.

15:18.060 --> 15:20.700
 I hope the viewer knows that really,

15:20.700 --> 15:23.420
 mathematics is amazing, amazing subject

15:23.420 --> 15:28.420
 and deep, deep connections between ideas

15:28.740 --> 15:32.620
 that didn't look connected, they turned out they were.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.580
 But if we stick with linear algebra...

15:35.580 --> 15:37.060
 So we have a matrix.

15:37.060 --> 15:40.740
 That's like the basic thing, a rectangle of numbers.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.660
 And it might be a rectangle of data.

15:42.660 --> 15:46.740
 You're probably gonna ask me later about data science,

15:46.740 --> 15:50.380
 where often data comes in a matrix.

15:50.380 --> 15:55.380
 You have maybe every column corresponds to a drug

15:57.420 --> 16:00.380
 and every row corresponds to a patient.

16:00.380 --> 16:05.380
 And if the patient reacted favorably to the drug,

16:06.580 --> 16:09.180
 then you put up some positive number in there.

16:09.180 --> 16:14.180
 Anyway, rectangle of numbers, a matrix is basic.

16:14.180 --> 16:18.140
 So the big problem is to understand all those numbers.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.980
 You got a big, big set of numbers.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.660
 And what are the patterns, what's going on?

16:23.660 --> 16:28.660
 And so one of the ways to break down that matrix

16:29.780 --> 16:34.780
 into simple pieces is uses something called singular values.

16:36.100 --> 16:41.100
 And that's come on as fundamental in the last,

16:41.100 --> 16:44.540
 certainly in my lifetime.

16:44.540 --> 16:48.500
 Eigenvalues, if you have viewers who've done engineering,

16:48.500 --> 16:53.500
 math, or basic linear algebra, eigenvalues were in there.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.780
 But those are restricted to square matrices.

16:58.780 --> 17:01.340
 And data comes in rectangular matrices.

17:01.340 --> 17:04.380
 So you gotta take that next step.

17:04.380 --> 17:09.380
 I'm always pushing math faculty, get on, do it, do it.

17:09.380 --> 17:11.180
 Singular values.

17:11.180 --> 17:16.180
 So those are a way to break, to find the important pieces

17:18.540 --> 17:22.140
 of the matrix, which add up to the whole matrix.

17:22.140 --> 17:26.100
 So you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces.

17:26.100 --> 17:30.300
 And the first piece is the most important part of the data.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.100
 The second piece is the second most important part.

17:33.100 --> 17:38.100
 And then often, so a data set is a matrix.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.540
 And often, so a data scientist will like,

17:41.540 --> 17:46.540
 if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces,

17:46.820 --> 17:51.820
 stop there, the rest of the data is probably round off,

17:55.660 --> 17:57.660
 experimental error maybe.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.180
 So you're looking for the important part.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.020
 So what do you find beautiful about singular values?

18:03.020 --> 18:06.260
 Well, yeah, I didn't give the theorem.

18:06.260 --> 18:09.420
 So here's the idea of singular values.

18:09.420 --> 18:14.420
 Every matrix, every matrix, rectangular, square, whatever,

18:15.180 --> 18:16.980
 can be written as a product

18:16.980 --> 18:20.020
 of three very simple special matrices.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.340
 So that's the theorem.

18:21.340 --> 18:26.220
 Every matrix can be written as a rotation times a stretch,

18:26.220 --> 18:30.340
 which is just a diagonal matrix,

18:30.340 --> 18:34.220
 otherwise all zeros except on the one diagonal.

18:34.220 --> 18:37.980
 And then the third factor is another rotation.

18:37.980 --> 18:41.420
 So rotation, stretch, rotation

18:41.420 --> 18:45.940
 is the breakup of any matrix.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.420
 The structure of that, the ability that you can do that,

18:48.420 --> 18:49.860
 what do you find appealing?

18:49.860 --> 18:51.060
 What do you find beautiful about it?

18:51.060 --> 18:54.220
 Well, geometrically, as I freely admit,

18:54.220 --> 18:59.220
 the action of a matrix is not so easy to visualize,

18:59.620 --> 19:02.380
 but everybody can visualize a rotation.

19:02.380 --> 19:07.060
 Take two dimensional space and just turn it

19:07.060 --> 19:09.260
 around the center.

19:09.260 --> 19:10.740
 Take three dimensional space.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.220
 So a pilot has to know about,

19:13.220 --> 19:16.860
 well, what are the three, the yaw is one of them.

19:16.860 --> 19:20.780
 I've forgotten all the three turns that a pilot makes.

19:22.260 --> 19:25.460
 Up to 10 dimensions, you've got 10 ways to turn,

19:25.460 --> 19:28.540
 but you can visualize a rotation.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.300
 Take the space and turn it.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.100
 And you can visualize a stretch.

19:32.100 --> 19:37.100
 So to break a matrix with all those numbers in it

19:38.660 --> 19:41.100
 into something you can visualize,

19:41.100 --> 19:44.860
 rotate, stretch, rotate is pretty neat.

19:44.860 --> 19:45.740
 It's pretty neat.

19:45.740 --> 19:47.660
 That's pretty powerful.

19:47.660 --> 19:51.980
 On YouTube, just consuming a bunch of videos

19:51.980 --> 19:53.980
 and just watching what people connect with

19:53.980 --> 19:57.300
 and what they really enjoy and are inspired by,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.580
 math seems to come up again and again.

19:59.580 --> 20:03.940
 I'm trying to understand why that is.

20:03.940 --> 20:06.500
 Perhaps you can help give me clues.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.740
 So it's not just the kinds of lectures that you give,

20:10.740 --> 20:14.180
 but it's also just other folks like with Numberphile,

20:14.180 --> 20:16.940
 there's a channel where they just chat about things

20:16.940 --> 20:19.860
 that are extremely complicated, actually.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.940
 People nevertheless connect with them.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.580
 What do you think that is?

20:24.580 --> 20:25.820
 It's wonderful, isn't it?

20:25.820 --> 20:28.500
 I mean, I wasn't really aware of it.

20:28.500 --> 20:32.020
 We're conditioned to think math is hard,

20:32.020 --> 20:35.300
 math is abstract, math is just for a few people,

20:35.300 --> 20:36.620
 but it isn't that way.

20:36.620 --> 20:41.380
 A lot of people quite like math and they liked it.

20:41.380 --> 20:44.100
 I get messages from people saying,

20:44.100 --> 20:46.780
 now I'm retired, I'm gonna learn some more math.

20:46.780 --> 20:47.980
 I get a lot of those.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.940
 It's really encouraging.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.460
 And I think what people like is that there's some order,

20:53.460 --> 20:58.460
 a lot of order and things are not obvious, but they're true.

21:00.380 --> 21:05.380
 So it's really cheering to think that so many people

21:06.180 --> 21:08.100
 really wanna learn more about math.

21:08.100 --> 21:08.940
 Yeah.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.820
 And in terms of truth, again,

21:11.820 --> 21:15.500
 sorry to slide into philosophy at times,

21:15.500 --> 21:20.500
 but math does reveal pretty strongly what things are true.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.500
 I mean, that's the whole point of proving things.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.340
 It is, yeah.

21:24.340 --> 21:29.340
 And yet, sort of our real world is messy and complicated.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.260
 It is.

21:30.260 --> 21:33.220
 What do you think about the nature of truth

21:33.220 --> 21:34.540
 that math reveals?

21:34.540 --> 21:35.500
 Oh, wow.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.980
 Because it is a source of comfort like you've mentioned.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.540
 Yeah, that's right.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.020
 Well, I have to say, I'm not much of a philosopher.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.740
 I just like numbers.

21:44.740 --> 21:49.740
 As a kid, this was before you had to go in,

21:52.100 --> 21:54.020
 when you had a filly in your teeth,

21:54.020 --> 21:56.060
 you had to kind of just take it.

21:56.060 --> 21:59.260
 So what I did was think about math,

21:59.260 --> 22:03.100
 like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16,

22:03.100 --> 22:05.900
 up until the time the tooth stopped hurting

22:05.900 --> 22:07.700
 and the dentist said you're through.

22:08.700 --> 22:09.900
 Or counting.

22:09.900 --> 22:10.740
 Yeah.

22:10.740 --> 22:14.700
 So that was a source of just, source of peace almost.

22:14.700 --> 22:15.540
 Yeah.

22:15.540 --> 22:19.660
 What is it about math do you think that brings that?

22:19.660 --> 22:20.500
 Yeah.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.340
 What is that?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.380
 Well, you know where you are.

22:22.380 --> 22:25.820
 Yeah, it's symmetry, it's certainty.

22:25.820 --> 22:29.820
 The fact that, you know, if you multiply two by itself

22:29.820 --> 22:33.220
 10 times, you get 1,024 period.

22:33.220 --> 22:34.900
 Everybody's gonna get that.

22:34.900 --> 22:39.020
 Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form?

22:39.020 --> 22:40.300
 So it's both.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.420
 That's really one of the neat things.

22:42.420 --> 22:46.380
 You can be an artist and like math,

22:46.380 --> 22:50.940
 you can be an engineer and use math.

22:50.940 --> 22:51.940
 Which are you?

22:51.940 --> 22:53.500
 Which am I?

22:53.500 --> 22:54.820
 What did you connect with most?

22:54.820 --> 22:57.300
 Yeah, I'm somewhere between.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.540
 I'm certainly not a artist type, philosopher type person.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.060
 Might sound that way this morning, but I'm not.

23:04.060 --> 23:09.060
 Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers

23:09.060 --> 23:13.260
 because they go for an answer.

23:13.260 --> 23:18.260
 And yeah, so probably within the MIT math department,

23:20.380 --> 23:23.620
 most people enjoy teaching people,

23:23.620 --> 23:26.940
 teaching students who get the abstract idea.

23:26.940 --> 23:31.940
 I'm okay with, I'm good with engineers

23:32.220 --> 23:34.780
 who are looking for a way to find answers.

23:34.780 --> 23:35.620
 Yeah.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.700
 Actually, that's an interesting question.

23:37.700 --> 23:41.340
 Do you think for teaching and in general,

23:41.340 --> 23:42.740
 thinking about new concepts,

23:42.740 --> 23:45.500
 do you think it's better to plug in the numbers

23:46.820 --> 23:49.060
 or to think more abstractly?

23:49.060 --> 23:53.620
 So looking at theorems and proving the theorems

23:53.620 --> 23:58.220
 or actually building up a basic intuition of the theorem

23:58.220 --> 23:59.900
 or the method, the approach,

23:59.900 --> 24:02.940
 and then just plugging in numbers and seeing it work.

24:02.940 --> 24:07.940
 Yeah, well, certainly many of us like to see examples.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.060
 First, we understand,

24:11.060 --> 24:13.980
 it might be a pretty abstract sounding example,

24:13.980 --> 24:16.820
 like a three dimensional rotation.

24:16.820 --> 24:21.660
 How are you gonna understand a rotation in 3D?

24:22.780 --> 24:24.020
 Or in 10D?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.860
 And then some of us like to keep going with it

24:30.860 --> 24:32.740
 to the point where you got numbers,

24:32.740 --> 24:37.100
 where you got 10 angles, 10 axes, 10 angles.

24:38.100 --> 24:43.100
 But the best, the great mathematicians probably,

24:43.620 --> 24:44.740
 I don't know if they do that,

24:44.740 --> 24:49.740
 because for them, an example would be a highly abstract thing

24:53.980 --> 24:54.820
 to the rest of it.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.540
 Right, but nevertheless, working in the space of examples.

24:57.540 --> 24:58.380
 Yeah, examples.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.220
 It seems to.

24:59.220 --> 25:01.820
 Examples of structure.

25:01.820 --> 25:03.620
 Our brains seem to connect with that.

25:03.620 --> 25:04.620
 Yeah, yeah.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.180
 So I'm not sure if you're familiar with him,

25:07.180 --> 25:10.260
 but Andrew Yang is a presidential candidate

25:11.820 --> 25:16.820
 currently running with math in all capital letters

25:17.060 --> 25:18.820
 and his hats as a slogan.

25:18.820 --> 25:19.660
 I see.

25:19.660 --> 25:21.700
 Stands for Make America Think Hard.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.860
 Okay, I'll vote for him.

25:25.180 --> 25:28.660
 So, and his name rhymes with yours, Yang, Strang.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.260
 But he also loves math and he comes from that world

25:31.260 --> 25:35.500
 of, but he also, looking at it,

25:35.500 --> 25:38.580
 makes me realize that math, science, and engineering

25:38.580 --> 25:43.300
 are not really part of our politics, political discourse,

25:43.300 --> 25:46.140
 about political government in general.

25:46.140 --> 25:48.620
 Why do you think that is?

25:48.620 --> 25:49.460
 Well.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.180
 What are your thoughts on that in general?

25:51.180 --> 25:52.740
 Well, certainly somewhere in the system,

25:52.740 --> 25:56.860
 we need people who are comfortable with numbers,

25:56.860 --> 25:58.340
 comfortable with quantities.

25:58.340 --> 26:02.460
 You know, if you say this leads to that,

26:02.460 --> 26:05.940
 they see it and it's undeniable.

26:05.940 --> 26:10.180
 But isn't that strange to you that we have almost no,

26:10.180 --> 26:14.420
 I mean, I'm pretty sure we have no elected officials

26:14.420 --> 26:18.380
 in Congress or obviously the president

26:18.380 --> 26:22.900
 that either has an engineering degree or a math degree.

26:22.900 --> 26:25.820
 Yeah, well, that's too bad.

26:25.820 --> 26:30.660
 A few could, a few who could make the connection.

26:30.660 --> 26:35.420
 Yeah, it would have to be people who understand

26:35.420 --> 26:38.580
 engineering or science and at the same time

26:38.580 --> 26:43.580
 can make speeches and lead, yeah.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.540
 Yeah, inspire people.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.580
 Yeah, inspire, yeah.

26:46.580 --> 26:49.260
 You were, speaking of inspiration,

26:49.260 --> 26:50.580
 the president of the Society

26:50.580 --> 26:52.860
 for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

26:52.860 --> 26:53.700
 Oh, yes.

26:53.700 --> 26:57.940
 It's a major organization in math, applied math.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.180
 What do you see as a role of that society,

27:01.180 --> 27:02.860
 you know, in our public discourse?

27:02.860 --> 27:03.700
 Right.

27:03.700 --> 27:04.540
 In public.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.380
 Yeah, so, well, it was fun to be president at the time.

27:08.380 --> 27:09.420
 A couple years, a few years.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.140
 Two years, around 2000.

27:13.660 --> 27:16.820
 I just hope that's president of a pretty small society.

27:16.820 --> 27:19.620
 But nevertheless, it was a time when math

27:19.620 --> 27:24.380
 was getting some more attention in Washington.

27:24.380 --> 27:29.220
 But yeah, I got to give a little 10 minutes

27:29.220 --> 27:33.900
 to a committee of the House of Representatives

27:33.900 --> 27:35.300
 talking about who I met.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.980
 And then, actually, it was fun

27:36.980 --> 27:40.780
 because one of the members of the House

27:42.460 --> 27:44.860
 had been a student, had been in my class.

27:44.860 --> 27:46.060
 What do you think of that?

27:46.060 --> 27:49.980
 Yeah, as you say, pretty rare, most members of the House

27:49.980 --> 27:52.860
 have had a different training, different background.

27:52.860 --> 27:56.340
 But there was one from New Hampshire

27:56.340 --> 28:01.340
 who was my friend, really, by being in the class.

28:02.460 --> 28:05.780
 Yeah, so those years were good.

28:05.780 --> 28:10.780
 Then, of course, other things take over in importance

28:10.780 --> 28:15.780
 in Washington, and math just, at this point,

28:16.980 --> 28:18.260
 is not so visible.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.220
 But for a little moment, it was.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.780
 There's some excitement, some concern

28:23.780 --> 28:26.300
 about artificial intelligence in Washington now.

28:26.300 --> 28:27.460
 Yes, sure. About the future.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.820
 Yeah. And I think at the core

28:28.820 --> 28:30.020
 of that is math.

28:30.020 --> 28:32.020
 Well, it is, yeah.

28:32.020 --> 28:32.860
 Maybe it's hidden.

28:32.860 --> 28:34.380
 Maybe it's wearing a different hat.

28:34.380 --> 28:39.220
 Well, artificial intelligence, and particularly,

28:39.220 --> 28:41.980
 can I use the words deep learning?

28:41.980 --> 28:44.260
 Deep learning is a particular approach

28:44.260 --> 28:47.580
 to understanding data.

28:47.580 --> 28:50.180
 Again, you've got a big, whole lot of data

28:51.060 --> 28:56.060
 where data is just swamping the computers of the world.

28:56.140 --> 29:00.660
 And to understand it, out of all those numbers,

29:00.660 --> 29:05.180
 to find what's important in climate, in everything.

29:05.180 --> 29:08.500
 And artificial intelligence is two words

29:08.500 --> 29:11.700
 for one approach to data.

29:11.700 --> 29:15.540
 Deep learning is a specific approach there,

29:15.540 --> 29:17.420
 which uses a lot of linear algebra.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.300
 So I got into it.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.580
 I thought, okay, I've gotta learn about this.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.140
 So maybe from your perspective,

29:24.140 --> 29:27.900
 let me ask the most basic question.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.340
 How do you think of a neural network?

29:30.340 --> 29:31.700
 What is a neural network?

29:31.700 --> 29:32.660
 Yeah, okay.

29:32.660 --> 29:37.220
 So can I start with the idea about deep learning?

29:37.220 --> 29:38.860
 What does that mean?

29:38.860 --> 29:39.940
 What is deep learning?

29:39.940 --> 29:41.980
 What is deep learning, yeah.

29:41.980 --> 29:46.300
 So we're trying to learn, from all this data,

29:46.300 --> 29:47.900
 we're trying to learn what's important.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.260
 What's it telling us?

29:50.260 --> 29:55.260
 So you've got data, you've got some inputs

29:55.300 --> 29:57.620
 for which you know the right outputs.

29:57.620 --> 30:02.100
 The question is, can you see the pattern there?

30:02.100 --> 30:04.660
 Can you figure out a way for a new input,

30:04.660 --> 30:09.660
 which we haven't seen, to understand

30:09.740 --> 30:12.220
 what the output will be from that new input?

30:12.220 --> 30:15.940
 So we've got a million inputs with their outputs.

30:15.940 --> 30:19.260
 So we're trying to create some pattern,

30:19.260 --> 30:22.180
 some rule that'll take those inputs,

30:22.180 --> 30:25.580
 those million training inputs, which we know about,

30:25.580 --> 30:28.180
 to the correct million outputs.

30:28.180 --> 30:32.780
 And this idea of a neural net

30:32.780 --> 30:37.780
 is part of the structure of our new way to create a rule.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.900
 We're looking for a rule that will take

30:43.900 --> 30:48.460
 these training inputs to the known outputs.

30:48.460 --> 30:51.660
 And then we're gonna use that rule on new inputs

30:51.660 --> 30:56.100
 that we don't know the output and see what comes.

30:56.100 --> 30:59.140
 Linear algebra is a big part of finding that rule.

30:59.140 --> 31:01.860
 That's right, linear algebra is a big part.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.500
 Not all the part.

31:03.500 --> 31:08.300
 People were leaning on matrices, that's good, still do.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
 Linear is something special.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.980
 It's all about straight lines and flat planes.

31:13.980 --> 31:18.860
 And data isn't quite like that.

31:18.860 --> 31:21.220
 It's more complicated.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.700
 So you gotta introduce some complication.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.460
 So you have to have some function

31:25.460 --> 31:27.460
 that's not a straight line.

31:27.460 --> 31:31.620
 And it turned out, nonlinear, nonlinear, not linear.

31:31.620 --> 31:35.860
 And it turned out that it was enough to use the function

31:35.860 --> 31:38.340
 that's one straight line and then a different one.

31:38.340 --> 31:40.900
 Halfway, so piecewise linear.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.420
 One piece has one slope,

31:44.420 --> 31:47.340
 one piece, the other piece has the second slope.

31:47.340 --> 31:52.340
 And so that, getting that nonlinear,

31:52.380 --> 31:56.700
 simple nonlinearity in blew the problem open.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.980
 That little piece makes it sufficiently complicated

31:58.980 --> 32:00.460
 to make things interesting.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.020
 Because you're gonna use that piece

32:02.020 --> 32:03.820
 over and over a million times.

32:03.820 --> 32:08.820
 So it has a fold in the graph, the graph, two pieces.

32:10.740 --> 32:13.700
 But when you fold something a million times,

32:13.700 --> 32:17.860
 you've got a pretty complicated function

32:17.860 --> 32:19.260
 that's pretty realistic.

32:19.260 --> 32:21.140
 So that's the thing about neural networks

32:21.140 --> 32:23.900
 is they have a lot of these.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.220
 A lot of these, that's right.

32:25.220 --> 32:29.660
 So why do you think neural networks,

32:29.660 --> 32:34.660
 by using sort of formulating an objective function,

32:34.940 --> 32:39.380
 very not a plain function of the folds,

32:39.380 --> 32:42.340
 lots of folds of the inputs, the outputs,

32:42.340 --> 32:47.300
 why do you think they work to be able to find a rule

32:47.300 --> 32:48.780
 that we don't know is optimal,

32:48.780 --> 32:53.300
 but it just seems to be pretty good in a lot of cases?

32:53.300 --> 32:54.580
 What's your intuition?

32:54.580 --> 32:58.180
 Is it surprising to you as it is to many people?

32:58.180 --> 33:01.140
 Do you have an intuition of why this works at all?

33:01.140 --> 33:04.300
 Well, I'm beginning to have a better intuition.

33:04.300 --> 33:08.500
 This idea of things that are piecewise linear,

33:08.500 --> 33:12.140
 flat pieces but with folds between them.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.980
 Like think of a roof of a complicated,

33:14.980 --> 33:17.780
 infinitely complicated house or something.

33:17.780 --> 33:22.780
 That curve, it almost curved, but every piece is flat.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.820
 That's been used by engineers,

33:26.820 --> 33:29.660
 that idea has been used by engineers,

33:29.660 --> 33:32.140
 is used by engineers, big time.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.220
 Something called the finite element method.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.980
 If you want to design a bridge,

33:36.980 --> 33:40.860
 design a building, design an airplane,

33:40.860 --> 33:45.860
 you're using this idea of piecewise flat

33:47.300 --> 33:52.260
 as a good, simple, computable approximation.

33:52.260 --> 33:57.260
 But you have a sense that there's a lot of expressive power

33:57.260 --> 33:58.580
 in this kind of piecewise linear.

33:58.580 --> 34:01.820
 Yeah, you used the right word.

34:01.820 --> 34:04.460
 If you measure the expressivity,

34:04.460 --> 34:09.460
 how complicated a thing can this piecewise flat guys express?

34:12.300 --> 34:15.500
 The answer is very complicated, yeah.

34:15.500 --> 34:20.380
 What do you think are the limits of such piecewise linear

34:20.380 --> 34:22.660
 or just of neural networks?

34:22.660 --> 34:24.100
 The expressivity of neural networks.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.660
 Well, you would have said a while ago

34:26.660 --> 34:28.700
 that they're just computational limits.

34:28.700 --> 34:33.700
 It's a problem beyond a certain size.

34:33.740 --> 34:36.060
 A supercomputer isn't gonna do it.

34:36.060 --> 34:39.420
 But those keep getting more powerful.

34:39.420 --> 34:42.660
 So that limit has been moved

34:44.260 --> 34:47.420
 to allow more and more complicated surfaces.

34:47.420 --> 34:52.420
 So in terms of just mapping from inputs to outputs,

34:52.940 --> 34:57.940
 looking at data, what do you think of,

34:58.460 --> 35:00.500
 in the context of neural networks in general,

35:00.500 --> 35:04.180
 data is just tensor, vectors, matrices, tensors.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.820
 Right.

35:05.820 --> 35:09.380
 How do you think about learning from data?

35:09.380 --> 35:12.780
 How much of our world can be expressed in this way?

35:12.780 --> 35:16.540
 How useful is this process?

35:16.540 --> 35:17.980
 I guess that's another way to ask you,

35:17.980 --> 35:19.340
 what are the limits of this approach?

35:19.340 --> 35:21.380
 Well, that's a good question, yeah.

35:21.380 --> 35:24.220
 So I guess the whole idea of deep learning

35:24.220 --> 35:26.220
 is that there's something there to learn.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.500
 If the data is totally random,

35:28.500 --> 35:31.380
 just produced by random number generators,

35:31.380 --> 35:36.220
 then we're not gonna find a useful rule

35:36.220 --> 35:37.380
 because there isn't one.

35:38.620 --> 35:43.620
 So the extreme of having a rule is like knowing Newton's law.

35:43.620 --> 35:46.220
 If you hit a ball, it moves.

35:46.220 --> 35:48.940
 So that's where you had laws of physics.

35:48.940 --> 35:53.940
 Newton and Einstein and other great, great people

35:54.140 --> 35:59.140
 have found those laws and laws of the distribution

36:02.940 --> 36:05.900
 of oil in an underground thing.

36:05.900 --> 36:10.900
 I mean, so engineers, petroleum engineers understand

36:10.900 --> 36:15.900
 how oil will sit in an underground basin.

36:18.180 --> 36:20.060
 So there were rules.

36:20.060 --> 36:25.060
 Now, the new idea of artificial intelligence is

36:25.620 --> 36:29.940
 learn the rules instead of figuring out the rules

36:29.940 --> 36:32.740
 with help from Newton or Einstein.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.660
 The computer is looking for the rules.

36:35.660 --> 36:36.900
 So that's another step.

36:36.900 --> 36:39.860
 But if there are no rules at all

36:39.860 --> 36:41.220
 that the computer could find,

36:41.220 --> 36:45.300
 if it's totally random data, well, you've got nothing.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.300
 You've got no science to discover.

36:48.300 --> 36:51.380
 It's an automated search for the underlying rules.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.380
 Yeah, search for the rules.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.780
 Yeah, exactly.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.820
 And there will be a lot of random parts.

36:57.820 --> 36:59.860
 A lot of, I mean, I'm not knocking random

36:59.860 --> 37:02.740
 because that's there.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.340
 There's a lot of randomness built in,

37:07.340 --> 37:09.380
 but there's gotta be some basic.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.900
 It's almost always signal, right?

37:10.900 --> 37:11.740
 In most things.

37:11.740 --> 37:12.820
 There's gotta be some signal, yeah.

37:12.820 --> 37:17.420
 If it's all noise, then you're not gonna get anywhere.

37:17.420 --> 37:19.900
 Well, this world around us does seem to be,

37:19.900 --> 37:22.420
 does seem to always have a signal of some kind.

37:22.420 --> 37:23.340
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.

37:23.340 --> 37:24.220
 To be discovered.

37:24.220 --> 37:25.900
 Right, that's it.

37:25.900 --> 37:29.460
 So what excites you more?

37:30.580 --> 37:32.860
 We just talked about a little bit of application.

37:32.860 --> 37:34.540
 What excites you more, theory

37:35.580 --> 37:38.380
 or the application of mathematics?

37:38.380 --> 37:43.260
 Well, for myself, I'm probably a theory person.

37:43.260 --> 37:48.260
 I'm not, I'm speaking here pretty freely about applications,

37:49.700 --> 37:53.220
 but I'm not the person who really,

37:53.220 --> 37:57.060
 I'm not a physicist or a chemist or a neuroscientist.

37:58.100 --> 38:03.100
 So for myself, I like the structure

38:03.220 --> 38:06.460
 and the flat subspaces

38:06.460 --> 38:11.460
 and the relation of matrices, columns to rows.

38:12.260 --> 38:17.260
 That's my part in the spectrum.

38:17.860 --> 38:22.420
 So really, science is a big spectrum of people

38:22.420 --> 38:25.740
 from asking practical questions

38:25.740 --> 38:28.740
 and answering them using some math,

38:28.740 --> 38:33.740
 then some math guys like myself who are in the middle of it

38:33.740 --> 38:38.740
 and then the geniuses of math and physics and chemistry

38:40.620 --> 38:43.300
 who are finding fundamental rules

38:43.300 --> 38:48.300
 and then doing the really understanding nature.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.820
 That's incredible.

38:51.820 --> 38:54.980
 At its lowest, simplest level,

38:54.980 --> 38:58.980
 maybe just a quick in broad strokes from your perspective,

38:58.980 --> 39:03.980
 where does linear algebra sit as a subfield of mathematics?

39:04.740 --> 39:09.740
 What are the various subfields that you think about

39:10.300 --> 39:12.180
 in relation to linear algebra?

39:12.180 --> 39:17.180
 So the big fields of math are algebra as a whole

39:18.020 --> 39:21.340
 and problems like calculus and differential equations.

39:21.340 --> 39:24.340
 So that's a second, quite different field.

39:24.340 --> 39:28.780
 Then maybe geometry deserves to be thought of

39:28.780 --> 39:31.540
 as a different field to understand the geometry

39:31.540 --> 39:34.100
 of high dimensional surfaces.

39:35.700 --> 39:39.700
 So I think, am I allowed to say this here?

39:39.700 --> 39:44.700
 I think this is where personal view comes in.

39:46.180 --> 39:51.180
 I think math, we're thinking about undergraduate math,

39:51.980 --> 39:54.260
 what millions of students study.

39:54.260 --> 39:59.260
 I think we overdo the calculus at the cost of the algebra,

40:00.780 --> 40:02.660
 at the cost of linear.

40:02.660 --> 40:05.300
 So you have this talk titled Calculus Versus Linear Algebra.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.380
 That's right, that's right.

40:07.380 --> 40:09.420
 And you say that linear algebra wins.

40:09.420 --> 40:13.780
 So can you dig into that a little bit?

40:13.780 --> 40:17.020
 Why does linear algebra win?

40:17.020 --> 40:21.100
 Right, well, okay, the viewer is gonna think

40:21.100 --> 40:22.700
 this guy is biased.

40:22.700 --> 40:27.060
 Not true, I'm just telling the truth as it is.

40:27.060 --> 40:31.940
 Yeah, so I feel linear algebra is just a nice part of math

40:31.940 --> 40:34.420
 that people can get the idea of.

40:34.420 --> 40:37.780
 They can understand something that's a little bit abstract

40:37.780 --> 40:40.660
 because once you get to 10 or 100 dimensions

40:42.140 --> 40:44.380
 and very, very, very useful,

40:44.380 --> 40:47.860
 that's what's happened in my lifetime

40:47.860 --> 40:52.540
 is the importance of data,

40:52.540 --> 40:54.660
 which does come in matrix form.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.660
 So it's really set up for algebra.

40:56.660 --> 40:59.260
 It's not set up for differential equation.

40:59.260 --> 41:03.300
 And let me fairly add probability,

41:03.300 --> 41:06.860
 the ideas of probability and statistics

41:06.860 --> 41:11.260
 have become very, very important, have also jumped forward.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.060
 So, and that's different from linear algebra,

41:14.060 --> 41:15.220
 quite different.

41:15.220 --> 41:20.220
 So now we really have three major areas to me,

41:20.220 --> 41:25.220
 calculus, linear algebra, matrices,

41:26.180 --> 41:28.980
 and probability statistics.

41:28.980 --> 41:33.980
 And they all deserve an important place.

41:33.980 --> 41:38.980
 And calculus has traditionally had a lion's share

41:40.020 --> 41:40.860
 of the time.

41:40.860 --> 41:41.900
 A disproportionate share.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.700
 It is, thank you, disproportionate, that's a good word.

41:45.700 --> 41:50.020
 Of the love and attention from the excited young minds.

41:50.020 --> 41:50.860
 Yeah.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.500
 I know it's hard to pick favorites,

41:55.500 --> 41:57.700
 but what is your favorite matrix?

41:57.700 --> 41:59.380
 What's my favorite matrix?

41:59.380 --> 42:03.220
 Okay, so my favorite matrix is square, I admit it.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.460
 It's a square bunch of numbers

42:05.460 --> 42:10.180
 and it has twos running down the main diagonal.

42:10.180 --> 42:13.020
 And on the next diagonal,

42:13.020 --> 42:15.380
 so think of top left to bottom right,

42:15.380 --> 42:18.900
 twos down the middle of the matrix

42:18.900 --> 42:22.140
 and minus ones just above those twos

42:22.140 --> 42:25.020
 and minus ones just below those twos

42:25.020 --> 42:26.620
 and otherwise all zeros.

42:26.620 --> 42:31.620
 So mostly zeros, just three nonzero diagonals coming down.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.380
 What is interesting about it?

42:34.380 --> 42:37.180
 Well, all the different ways it comes up.

42:37.180 --> 42:39.260
 You see it in engineering,

42:39.260 --> 42:44.100
 you see it as analogous in calculus to second derivative.

42:44.100 --> 42:47.180
 So calculus learns about taking the derivative,

42:47.180 --> 42:50.620
 the figuring out how much, how fast something's changing.

42:51.500 --> 42:55.740
 But second derivative, now that's also important.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.740
 That's how fast the change is changing,

42:58.740 --> 43:03.740
 how fast the graph is bending, how fast it's curving.

43:06.460 --> 43:10.140
 And Einstein showed that that's fundamental

43:10.140 --> 43:11.540
 to understand space.

43:11.540 --> 43:16.540
 So second derivatives should have a bigger place in calculus.

43:17.380 --> 43:21.020
 Second, my matrices,

43:21.020 --> 43:24.980
 which are like the linear algebra version

43:24.980 --> 43:29.980
 of second derivatives are neat in linear algebra.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.780
 Yeah, just everything comes out right with those guys.

43:34.020 --> 43:35.220
 Beautiful.

43:35.220 --> 43:38.380
 What did you learn about the process of learning

43:38.380 --> 43:42.820
 by having taught so many students math over the years?

43:42.820 --> 43:44.820
 Ooh, that is hard.

43:45.700 --> 43:50.700
 I'll have to admit here that I'm not really a good teacher

43:51.260 --> 43:55.540
 because I don't get into the exam part.

43:55.540 --> 43:59.020
 The exam is the part of my life that I don't like

43:59.020 --> 44:04.020
 and grading them and giving the students A or B or whatever.

44:04.380 --> 44:08.260
 I do it because I'm supposed to do it,

44:08.260 --> 44:11.900
 but I tell the class at the beginning,

44:11.900 --> 44:13.180
 I don't know if they believe me.

44:13.180 --> 44:14.580
 Probably they don't.

44:14.580 --> 44:18.020
 I tell the class, I'm here to teach you.

44:18.020 --> 44:21.620
 I'm here to teach you math and not to grade you.

44:22.700 --> 44:26.300
 But they're thinking, okay, this guy is gonna,

44:26.300 --> 44:28.820
 when is he gonna give me an A minus?

44:28.820 --> 44:30.580
 Is he gonna give me a B plus?

44:30.580 --> 44:31.420
 What?

44:31.420 --> 44:34.060
 What have you learned about the process of learning?

44:34.060 --> 44:34.940
 Of learning.

44:34.940 --> 44:39.940
 Yeah, well, maybe to give you a legitimate answer

44:40.220 --> 44:43.900
 about learning, I should have paid more attention

44:43.900 --> 44:47.660
 to the assessment, the evaluation part at the end.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.980
 But I like the teaching part at the start.

44:49.980 --> 44:52.060
 That's the sexy part.

44:52.060 --> 44:56.060
 To tell somebody for the first time about a matrix, wow.

44:56.060 --> 44:58.700
 Is there, are there moments,

44:58.700 --> 45:01.900
 so you are teaching a concept,

45:01.900 --> 45:05.500
 are there moments of learning that you just see

45:05.500 --> 45:06.460
 in the student's eyes?

45:06.460 --> 45:08.220
 You don't need to look at the grades.

45:08.220 --> 45:11.540
 But you see in their eyes that you hook them,

45:11.540 --> 45:16.260
 that you connect with them in a way where,

45:16.260 --> 45:18.620
 you know what, they fall in love

45:18.620 --> 45:21.180
 with this beautiful world of math.

45:21.180 --> 45:24.460
 They see that it's got some beauty there.

45:24.460 --> 45:28.060
 Or conversely, that they give up at that point

45:28.060 --> 45:29.140
 is the opposite.

45:29.140 --> 45:32.420
 The dark could say that math, I'm just not good at math.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.260
 I don't wanna walk away.

45:33.260 --> 45:34.300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:34.300 --> 45:37.700
 Maybe because of the approach in the past,

45:37.700 --> 45:40.500
 they were discouraged, but don't be discouraged.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.100
 It's too good to miss.

45:44.420 --> 45:48.420
 Yeah, well, if I'm teaching a big class,

45:48.420 --> 45:51.900
 do I know when, I think maybe I do.

45:51.900 --> 45:55.460
 Sort of, I mentioned at the very start,

45:55.460 --> 45:59.340
 the four fundamental subspaces

45:59.340 --> 46:03.100
 and the structure of the fundamental theorem

46:03.100 --> 46:04.740
 of linear algebra.

46:04.740 --> 46:06.780
 The fundamental theorem of linear algebra.

46:06.780 --> 46:11.740
 That is the relation of those four subspaces,

46:11.740 --> 46:13.420
 those four spaces.

46:13.420 --> 46:17.740
 Yeah, so I think that, I feel that the class gets it.

46:17.740 --> 46:18.580
 At length.

46:18.580 --> 46:19.940
 Yeah.

46:19.940 --> 46:22.420
 What advice do you have to a student

46:22.420 --> 46:25.140
 just starting their journey in mathematics today?

46:25.140 --> 46:27.060
 How do they get started?

46:27.060 --> 46:30.100
 Oh, yeah, that's hard.

46:30.100 --> 46:34.780
 Well, I hope you have a teacher, professor,

46:34.780 --> 46:39.780
 who is still enjoying what he's doing,

46:39.860 --> 46:41.380
 what he's teaching.

46:41.380 --> 46:44.020
 They're still looking for new ways to teach

46:44.020 --> 46:46.700
 and to understand math.

46:47.940 --> 46:49.660
 Cause that's the pleasure,

46:51.140 --> 46:54.980
 the moment when you see, oh yeah, that works.

46:54.980 --> 46:58.500
 So it's less about the material you study,

46:58.500 --> 47:02.460
 it's more about the source of the teacher

47:02.460 --> 47:03.900
 being full of passion.

47:03.900 --> 47:05.740
 Yeah, more about the fun.

47:05.740 --> 47:10.500
 Yeah, the moment of getting it.

47:10.500 --> 47:14.140
 But in terms of topics, linear algebra?

47:14.140 --> 47:16.940
 Well, that's my topic,

47:16.940 --> 47:21.220
 but oh, there's beautiful things in geometry to understand.

47:21.220 --> 47:24.140
 What's wonderful is that in the end,

47:24.140 --> 47:28.620
 there's a pattern, there are rules

47:28.620 --> 47:33.620
 that are followed in biology as there are in every field.

47:37.260 --> 47:41.420
 You describe the life of a mathematician

47:41.420 --> 47:44.260
 as 100% wonderful.

47:44.260 --> 47:45.620
 No.

47:45.620 --> 47:47.140
 Except for the grade stuff.

47:47.140 --> 47:47.980
 Yeah.

47:47.980 --> 47:48.820
 And the grades.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.660
 Except for grades.

47:49.660 --> 47:52.140
 Yeah, when you look back at your life,

47:52.140 --> 47:54.940
 what memories bring you the most joy and pride?

47:55.980 --> 47:58.220
 Well, that's a good question.

47:59.500 --> 48:01.620
 I certainly feel good when I,

48:01.620 --> 48:06.140
 maybe I'm giving a class in 1806,

48:06.140 --> 48:09.380
 that's MIT's linear algebra course that I started.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.620
 So sort of, there's a good feeling that,

48:11.620 --> 48:13.740
 okay, I started this course,

48:13.740 --> 48:17.340
 a lot of students take it, quite a few like it.

48:17.340 --> 48:21.380
 Yeah, so I'm sort of happy

48:21.380 --> 48:25.060
 when I feel I'm helping make a connection

48:25.060 --> 48:27.740
 between ideas and students,

48:27.740 --> 48:31.860
 between theory and the reader.

48:32.980 --> 48:37.340
 Yeah, it's, I get a lot of very nice messages

48:38.540 --> 48:43.460
 from people who've watched the videos and it's inspiring.

48:43.460 --> 48:47.220
 I just, I'll maybe take this chance to say thank you.

48:48.060 --> 48:50.380
 Well, there's millions of students

48:50.380 --> 48:54.220
 who you've taught and I am grateful to be one of them.

48:54.220 --> 48:56.540
 So Gilbert, thank you so much, it's been an honor.
