00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
 The following is a conversation with Alex Filipenko, an astrophysicist and professor

00:04.920 --> 00:07.100
 of astronomy from Berkeley.

00:07.100 --> 00:12.640
 He was a member of both the Supernova Cosmology Project and the HiZ Supernova Search Team

00:12.640 --> 00:18.680
 which used observations of the extragalactic supernova to discover that the universe is

00:18.680 --> 00:23.800
 accelerating and that this implies the existence of dark energy.

00:23.800 --> 00:28.920
 This discovery resulted in the 2011 NOVA Prize for Physics.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.120
 Outside of his groundbreaking research, he is a great science communicator and is one

00:34.120 --> 00:37.680
 of the most widely admired educators in the world.

00:37.680 --> 00:43.160
 I really enjoyed this conversation and am sure Alex will be back again in the future.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.440
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:47.440 --> 00:53.100
 Neuro, the maker of functional, sugar free gum and mints that I used to give my brain

00:53.100 --> 00:55.560
 a quick caffeine boost.

00:55.560 --> 01:01.360
 BetterHelp, an online therapy with a licensed professional, Masterclass, online courses

01:01.360 --> 01:07.240

01:07.240 --> 01:09.440
 use to send money to friends.

01:14.080 --> 01:20.160
 As a side note, let me say that as we talk about in this conversation, the objects that

01:20.160 --> 01:26.760
 populate the universe are both awe inspiring and terrifying in their capacity to create

01:26.760 --> 01:28.920
 and to destroy us.

01:28.920 --> 01:34.820
 Solar flares and asteroids lurking in the darkness of space threaten our humble, fragile

01:34.820 --> 01:37.460
 existence here on Earth.

01:37.460 --> 01:44.040
 In the chaos, tension, conflict, and social division of 2020, it's easy to forget just

01:44.040 --> 01:50.120
 how lucky we humans are to be here, and with a bit of hard work, maybe one day, we'll

01:50.120 --> 01:53.520
 venture out towards the stars.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.800
 And now, here's my conversation with Alex Filipenko.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.840
 Let's start by talking about the biggest possible thing, the universe.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.040
 Will the universe expand forever or collapse on itself?

02:16.040 --> 02:18.180
 Well, you know, that's a great question.

02:18.180 --> 02:24.320
 It's one of the big questions of cosmology, and of course, we have evidence that the matter

02:24.320 --> 02:28.140
 density is sufficiently low that the universe will expand forever.

02:28.140 --> 02:33.900
 But not only that, there's this weird repulsive effect, we call it dark energy for want of

02:33.900 --> 02:38.860
 a better term, and it appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.

02:38.860 --> 02:44.920
 So if that continues, the universe will expand forever, but it need not necessarily continue.

02:44.920 --> 02:51.480
 It could reverse sign, in which case the universe could, in principle, collapse at some point

02:51.480 --> 02:53.200
 in the far, far future.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.480
 So in terms of investment advice, if you were to give me and then to bet all my money on

02:58.480 --> 03:01.320
 one or the other, where does your intuition currently lie?

03:01.320 --> 03:05.900
 Well, right now, I would say that it would expand forever because I think that the dark

03:05.900 --> 03:11.100
 energy is likely to be just quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.960
 The vacuum zero energy state is not a state of zero energy.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.240
 That is, the ground state is a state of some elevated energy which has a repulsive effect

03:21.240 --> 03:22.240
 to it.

03:22.240 --> 03:27.080
 And that will never go away because it's not something that changes with time.

03:27.080 --> 03:31.820
 So if the universe is accelerating now, it will forever continue to do so.

03:31.820 --> 03:36.080
 And yet, I mean, you so effortlessly mentioned dark energy.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.040
 Do we have any understanding of what the heck that thing is?

03:39.040 --> 03:40.280
 Well, not really.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.180
 But we're getting progressively better observational constraints.

03:44.180 --> 03:50.160
 So different theories of what it might be predict different sorts of behavior for the

03:50.160 --> 03:51.900
 evolution of the universe.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.880
 And we've been measuring the evolution of the universe now.

03:55.880 --> 04:02.780
 And the data appear to agree with the predictions of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero

04:02.780 --> 04:05.280
 point energy.

04:05.280 --> 04:12.680
 But one can't prove that that's what it is because one would have to show that the measured

04:12.680 --> 04:17.280
 numbers agree with the predictions to an arbitrary number of decimal places.

04:17.280 --> 04:23.120
 And of course, even if you've got 8, 9, 10, 12 decimal places, what if in the 13th one,

04:23.120 --> 04:27.360
 the measurements significantly differ from the prediction?

04:27.360 --> 04:35.400
 Then the dark energy isn't this vacuum state, ground state energy of the vacuum.

04:35.400 --> 04:40.320
 And so then it could be some sort of a field, some sort of a new energy, a little bit like

04:40.320 --> 04:47.480
 light, like electromagnetism, but very different from light, that fills space.

04:47.480 --> 04:52.660
 And that type of energy could in principle change in the distant future.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.440
 It could become gravitationally attractive for all we know.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.880
 There is a historical precedent to that, and that is that the inflation with which the

05:00.880 --> 05:07.120
 universe began when the universe was just a tiny blink of an eye old, a trillionth of

05:07.120 --> 05:11.320
 a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, the universe went whoosh, it exponentially

05:11.320 --> 05:12.680
 expanded.

05:12.680 --> 05:19.000
 That dark energy like substance, we call it the inflaton, that which inflated the universe,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.680
 later decayed into more or less normal gravitationally attractive matter.

05:24.680 --> 05:31.720
 So the exponential early expansion of the universe did transition to a deceleration,

05:31.720 --> 05:35.080
 which then dominated the universe for about nine billion years.

05:35.080 --> 05:42.880
 And now this small amount of dark energy started causing an acceleration about five billion

05:42.880 --> 05:43.880
 years ago.

05:43.880 --> 05:48.280
 And whether that will continue or not is something that we'd like to answer, but I don't know

05:48.280 --> 05:50.520
 that we will anytime soon.

05:50.520 --> 05:56.240
 So there could be this interesting field that we don't yet understand that's morphing over

05:56.240 --> 05:59.480
 time, that's changing the way the universe is expanding.

05:59.480 --> 06:06.760
 I mean, it's funny that you were thinking through this rigorously like an experimentalist.

06:06.760 --> 06:11.260
 But what about like the fundamental physics of dark energy?

06:11.260 --> 06:20.680
 Is there any understanding of what the heck it is, or is this the kind of the god of the

06:20.680 --> 06:22.880
 gaps or the field of the gaps?

06:22.880 --> 06:26.800
 So like there must be something there because of what we're observing.

06:26.800 --> 06:35.440
 I'm very much a person who believes that there's always a cause, you know, there are no miracles

06:35.440 --> 06:39.480
 of a supernatural nature, okay?

06:39.480 --> 06:45.360
 So I mean, there are two broad categories, either it's the vacuum zero point energy,

06:45.360 --> 06:50.440
 or it's some sort of a new energy field that pervades the universe.

06:50.440 --> 06:55.960
 The latter could change with time, the former, the vacuum energy cannot.

06:55.960 --> 07:00.960
 So if it turns out that it's one of these new fields, and there are many, many possibilities,

07:00.960 --> 07:06.360
 they go by the name of quintessence and things like that, but there are many categories of

07:06.360 --> 07:14.760
 those sorts of fields, we try with data to rule them out by comparing the actual measurements

07:14.760 --> 07:16.440
 with the predictions.

07:16.440 --> 07:22.000
 And some have been ruled out, but many, many others remain to be tested.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.160
 And the data just have to become a lot better before we can rule out most of them and become

07:28.160 --> 07:31.960
 reasonably convinced that this is a vacuum energy.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.760
 So there is hypotheses for different fields, like with names and stuff like that?

07:35.760 --> 07:40.160
 Yeah, you know, generically quintessence, like the Aristotelian fifth essence, but there

07:40.160 --> 07:42.880
 are many, many versions of quintessence.

07:42.880 --> 07:48.520
 There's K essence, there's even ideas that, you know, this isn't something from within

07:48.520 --> 07:54.240
 this dark energy, but rather, there are a bunch of, say, bubble universes surrounding

07:54.240 --> 08:00.560
 our universe, and this whole idea of the multiverse is not some crazy madman type idea anymore.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.860
 It's, you know, real card carrying physicists are seriously considering this possibility

08:04.860 --> 08:06.240
 of a multiverse.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.640
 And some types of multiverses could have, you know, a bunch of bubbles on the outside,

08:10.640 --> 08:18.600
 which gravitationally act outward on our bubble because gravity or gravitons, the quantum

08:18.600 --> 08:24.300
 particle that is thought to carry gravity, is thought to traverse the bulk, the space

08:24.300 --> 08:27.080
 between these different little bubble membranes and stuff.

08:27.080 --> 08:31.580
 And so it's conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us.

08:31.580 --> 08:38.040
 That's not a favored explanation right now, but really, nothing has been ruled out.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.680
 No class of models has been ruled out completely.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.000
 Certain examples within classes of models have been ruled out.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
 But in general, I think we still have really a lot to learn about what's causing this

08:52.000 --> 08:58.560
 observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe, be it dark energy or some forces

08:58.560 --> 09:05.760
 from the outside, or perhaps, you know, I guess it's conceivable that, and sometimes

09:05.760 --> 09:12.760
 I wake up in the middle of the night screaming, that dark energy, that which causes the acceleration,

09:12.760 --> 09:18.160
 and dark matter, that which causes galaxies and clusters of galaxies to be bound gravitationally

09:18.160 --> 09:21.400
 even though there's not enough visible matter to do so.

09:21.400 --> 09:28.360
 Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century Ptolemaic epicycles.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.820
 So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.520
 Everything goes around Earth.

09:34.520 --> 09:40.540
 But in order to explain the backward motion of planets among the stars that happens every

09:40.540 --> 09:45.480
 year or two, or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus, you needed the

09:45.480 --> 09:51.080
 planets to go around in little circles called epicycles, which themselves then went around

09:51.080 --> 09:52.080
 Earth.

09:52.080 --> 09:58.840
 And in this part of the epicycle where the planet is going in the direction opposite

09:58.840 --> 10:04.360
 to the direction of the overall epicycle, it can appear in projection to be going backward

10:04.360 --> 10:08.040
 among the stars, so called retrograde motion.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.240
 And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme.

10:10.240 --> 10:16.480
 In fact, he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles and reproduced the observed

10:16.480 --> 10:19.740
 positions of planets to arbitrary accuracy.

10:19.740 --> 10:24.760
 And this is really the beginning of what we now call Fourier analysis, right?

10:24.760 --> 10:31.680
 Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods,

10:31.680 --> 10:33.560
 amplitudes, and phases.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.360
 So it could have worked arbitrarily well.

10:36.360 --> 10:42.080
 But other data show that, in fact, Earth is going around the sun.

10:42.080 --> 10:49.420
 So our dark energy and dark matter, just these band aids that we now have to try to explain

10:49.420 --> 10:53.160
 the data, but they're just completely wrong.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.760
 That's a possibility as well.

10:54.760 --> 11:00.760
 And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility as an open minded scientist.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.240
 How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody that, or majority of the scientific

11:05.240 --> 11:10.820
 community or majority of people believe that the Earth, everything rotates around Earth?

11:10.820 --> 11:21.200
 How do you put yourself in that mindset and then take a leap to propose a model that the

11:21.200 --> 11:25.760
 sun is, in fact, at the center of the solar system?

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
 Sure.

11:26.760 --> 11:32.640
 I mean, so that puts us back in the shoes of Copernicus, right, 500 years ago, where

11:32.640 --> 11:39.400
 he had this philosophical preference for the sun being the dominant body in what we now

11:39.400 --> 11:41.440
 call the solar system.

11:41.440 --> 11:48.460
 The observational evidence in terms of the measured positions of planets was not better

11:48.460 --> 11:53.460
 explained by the heliocentric, sun centered system.

11:53.460 --> 12:01.240
 It's just that Copernicus saw that the sun is the source of all our light and heat, and

12:01.240 --> 12:03.920
 he knew from other studies that it's far away.

12:03.920 --> 12:08.360
 So the fact that it appears as big as the moon means it's actually way, way bigger because

12:08.360 --> 12:12.800
 even at that time, it was known that the sun is much farther away than the moon.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.440
 So he just felt, wow, it's big, it's bright.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.680
 What if it's the central thing?

12:18.680 --> 12:26.720
 But the observed positions of planets at the time in the early to mid 16th century under

12:26.720 --> 12:32.320
 the heliocentric system was not a better match, at least not a significantly better match

12:32.320 --> 12:36.840
 than Ptolemy's system, which was quite accurate and lasted 1500 years.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
 Yeah.

12:37.840 --> 12:45.280
 That's so fascinating to think that the philosophical predispositions that you bring to the table

12:45.280 --> 12:46.280
 are essential.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.600
 So like you have to have a young person come along that has a weird infatuation with the

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
 sun.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.600
 Yeah.

12:52.600 --> 12:58.680
 That like almost philosophically is like however their upbringing is, they're more ready for

12:58.680 --> 13:02.560
 whatever the more the simpler answer is.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.560
 Right.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.160
 Oh, that's kind of sad.

13:07.160 --> 13:12.640
 It's a sad from an individual descendant of eight perspective because then that means

13:12.640 --> 13:19.400
 like me, you as a scientist, you're stuck with whatever the heck philosophies you brought

13:19.400 --> 13:25.140
 to the table and you might be almost completely unable to think outside this particular box

13:25.140 --> 13:26.140
 you've built.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.140
 Right.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.540
 This is why I'm saying that, you know, as an objective scientist, one needs to have

13:29.540 --> 13:34.040
 an open mind to crazy sounding new ideas.

13:34.040 --> 13:40.320
 And even Copernicus was very much a man of his time and dedicated his work to the Pope.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.120
 He still used circular orbits.

13:43.120 --> 13:48.980
 The sun was a little bit off center, it turns out, and a slightly off center circle looks

13:48.980 --> 13:52.220
 like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit.

13:52.220 --> 13:58.000
 So then when Kepler, in fact, showed that the orbits are actually in general ellipses,

13:58.000 --> 14:07.760
 not circles, the reason that he needed Tuco Brahe's really great data to show that distinction

14:07.760 --> 14:13.520
 was that a slightly off center circle is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse.

14:13.520 --> 14:20.480
 And so there wasn't much difference between Kepler's view and Copernicus's view and Kepler

14:20.480 --> 14:24.640
 needed the better data, Tuco Brahe's data.

14:24.640 --> 14:33.440
 And so that's, again, a great example of science and observations and experiments working together

14:33.440 --> 14:36.960
 with hypotheses and they kind of bounce off each other.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.720
 They play off of each other and you continually need more observations.

14:40.720 --> 14:49.320
 And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610 that actual evidence for the heliocentric

14:49.320 --> 14:51.040
 hypothesis emerged.

14:51.040 --> 14:57.100
 It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus, going through all of the possible phases from

14:57.100 --> 15:03.840
 new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full to waning gibbous, third quarter waning crescent,

15:03.840 --> 15:05.020
 and then new again.

15:05.020 --> 15:10.560
 It turns out in the Ptolemaic system with Venus between Earth and the sun, but always

15:10.560 --> 15:17.560
 roughly in the direction of the sun, you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.600
 But the observations showed a full set of phases.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.620
 And moreover, when Venus was gibbous or full, that meant it was on the far side of the sun.

15:26.620 --> 15:31.320
 That meant it was farther from Earth than when it's crescent, so it should appear smaller

15:31.320 --> 15:33.000
 and indeed it did.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.800
 So that was the nail in the coffin in a sense.

15:36.800 --> 15:42.460
 And then Galileo's other great observation was that Jupiter has moons going around it,

15:42.460 --> 15:44.400
 the four Galilean satellites.

15:44.400 --> 15:49.440
 And even though Jupiter moves through space, so too do the moons go with it.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.820
 So first of all, Earth is not the only thing that has other things going around it.

15:53.820 --> 16:01.360
 And secondly, Earth could be moving as Jupiter does and things would move with it.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.720
 We wouldn't fly off the surface and our moon wouldn't be left behind and all this kind

16:04.720 --> 16:05.720
 of stuff.

16:05.720 --> 16:11.000
 So that was a big breakthrough as well, but it wasn't as definitive in my opinion as

16:11.000 --> 16:13.680
 the phases of Venus.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.520
 Sometimes I'm revealing my ignorance, but I didn't realize how much data they were working

16:17.520 --> 16:20.240
 with.

16:20.240 --> 16:27.020
 So it wasn't Einstein or Freud thinking in theories.

16:27.020 --> 16:31.480
 It was a lot of data and you're playing with it and seeing how to make sense of it.

16:31.480 --> 16:36.920
 So it isn't just coming up with completely abstract thought experiments.

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
 It's looking at the data.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
 Sure.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.400
 And you look at Newton's great work, right?

16:40.400 --> 16:47.480
 The Principia, it was based in part on Galileo's observations of balls rolling down inclined

16:47.480 --> 16:53.240
 planes, supposedly falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but that's probably apocryphal.

16:53.240 --> 17:04.040
 In any case, the Roman Catholic Church did history a favor, not that I'm condoning them,

17:04.040 --> 17:10.440
 but they placed Galileo under house arrest and that gave Galileo time to publish, to

17:10.440 --> 17:15.640
 assemble and publish the results of his experiments that he had done decades earlier.

17:15.640 --> 17:21.400
 It's not clear he would have had time to do that, had he not been under house arrest.

17:21.400 --> 17:27.520
 And so Newton, of course, very much used Galileo's observations.

17:27.520 --> 17:34.080
 Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question about death.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.640
 So we're talking about the expanding universe.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.640
 Sure.

17:37.640 --> 17:42.680
 How do you think human civilization will come to an end if we avoid the near term issues

17:42.680 --> 17:45.400
 we're having?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.240
 Will it be our sun burning out?

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
 Will it be comets?

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
 Oh, okay.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.560
 Will it be, what is it?

17:52.560 --> 17:58.360
 Do you think we have a shot at reaching the heat death of the universe?

17:58.360 --> 17:59.360
 Yeah.

17:59.360 --> 18:07.520
 So we're going to leave out the anthropogenic causes of our potential destruction, which

18:07.520 --> 18:14.460
 I actually think are greater than the celestial causes.

18:14.460 --> 18:18.560
 So if we get lucky and intelligent, I don't know.

18:18.560 --> 18:23.680
 So no way will we as humans reach the heat death of the universe.

18:23.680 --> 18:30.160
 It's conceivable that machines, which I think will be our evolutionary descendants, might

18:30.160 --> 18:35.120
 reach that, although even they will have less and less energy with which to work as time

18:35.120 --> 18:40.960
 progresses because eventually even the lowest mass stars burn out, although it takes them

18:40.960 --> 18:44.000
 trillions of years to do so.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.480
 So the point is that certainly on Earth, there are other celestial threats, existential threats,

18:52.480 --> 18:57.000
 comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.360
 So we will definitely need to move away from our solar system to other solar systems.

19:02.360 --> 19:10.000
 And then the question is, can they keep on propagating to other planetary systems sufficiently

19:10.000 --> 19:11.800
 long?

19:11.800 --> 19:20.800
 In our own solar system, the sun burning out is not the immediate existential threat.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.400
 That'll happen in about five billion years when it becomes a red giant, although I should

19:25.400 --> 19:30.240
 hasten to add that within the next one or two billion years, the sun will have brightened

19:30.240 --> 19:38.520
 enough that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes, the oceans will evaporate

19:38.520 --> 19:39.520
 away.

19:39.520 --> 19:44.320
 They're going to need much less carbon dioxide for the temperatures to be maintained roughly

19:44.320 --> 19:47.840
 at their present temperature, and plants wouldn't like that very much.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.520
 So you can't lower the carbon dioxide content too much.

19:51.520 --> 19:56.240
 So within one or two billion years, probably the oceans will evaporate away.

19:56.240 --> 20:02.840
 But on a sooner time scale than that, I would say an asteroid collision leading to a potential

20:02.840 --> 20:08.720
 mass extinction, or at least an extinction of complex beings such as ourselves that require

20:08.720 --> 20:19.040
 quite special conditions unlike cockroaches and amoebas to survive, one of these civilization

20:19.040 --> 20:25.000
 changing asteroids is only one kilometer or so in diameter and bigger, and a true mass

20:25.000 --> 20:28.880
 extinction event is 10 kilometers or larger.

20:28.880 --> 20:34.560
 Now it's true that we can find and track the orbits of asteroids that might be headed toward

20:34.560 --> 20:39.860
 Earth, and if we find them 50 or 100 years before they impact us, then clever applied

20:39.860 --> 20:43.440
 physicists and engineers can figure out ways to deflect them.

20:43.440 --> 20:48.640
 But at some point, some comet will come in from the deep freeze of the solar system,

20:48.640 --> 20:52.000
 and there we have very little warning, months to a year.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.120
 What's the deep freeze, sorry to interrupt.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.080
 The deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune.

20:57.080 --> 21:03.440
 There's this thing called the Kuiper Belt, and it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls

21:03.440 --> 21:04.920
 or icy dirt balls.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.920
 It's the source of the comets that occasionally come close to the Sun.

21:08.920 --> 21:13.760
 And then there's an even bigger area called the Scattered Disk, which is sort of a big

21:13.760 --> 21:17.840
 doughnut surrounding the solar system way out there from which other comets come.

21:17.840 --> 21:25.840
 And then there's the Oort Cloud, W O O R T after Jan Oort, a Dutch astrophysicist, and

21:25.840 --> 21:31.080
 it's the better part of a light year away from the Sun, so a good fraction of the distance

21:31.080 --> 21:37.640
 to the nearest star, but that's like a trillion or 10 trillion comet like objects that occasionally

21:37.640 --> 21:41.560
 get disturbed by a passing star or whatever, and most of them go flying out of the solar

21:41.560 --> 21:46.960
 system, but some go toward the Sun, and they come in with little warning.

21:46.960 --> 21:53.240
 By the time we can see them, they're only a year or two away from us.

21:53.240 --> 21:59.080
 And moreover, not only is it hard to determine their trajectories sufficiently accurately

21:59.080 --> 22:07.040
 to know whether they'll hit a tiny thing like Earth, but outgassing from the comet of gases

22:07.040 --> 22:13.600
 when the ices sublimate, that outgassing can change the trajectory just because of conservation

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
 of momentum, right?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.920
 It's the rocket effect.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.100
 Gases go out in one direction, the object moves in the other direction.

22:19.100 --> 22:25.000
 And so since we can't predict how much outgassing there will be and in exactly what direction

22:25.000 --> 22:30.400
 because these things are tumbling and rotating and stuff, it's hard to predict the trajectory

22:30.400 --> 22:33.280
 with sufficient accuracy to know that it will hit.

22:33.280 --> 22:38.760
 And you certainly don't want to deflect a comet that would have missed but you thought

22:38.760 --> 22:41.980
 it was going to hit and end up having it hit.

22:41.980 --> 22:47.200
 That would be like the ultimate Charlie Brown goat instead of trying to be the hero, right?

22:47.200 --> 22:50.960
 He ended up being the goat.

22:50.960 --> 22:58.960
 What would you do if it seemed like in a matter of months that there is some nonzero probability,

22:58.960 --> 23:02.480
 maybe a high probability that there will be a collision?

23:02.480 --> 23:06.680
 So from a scientific perspective, from an engineering perspective, I imagine you would

23:06.680 --> 23:10.520
 actually be in the room of people deciding what to do.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.680
 What uh, philosophically too.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.720
 It's a tough one, right?

23:13.720 --> 23:19.680
 Because if you only have a few months, that's not much time in which to deflect it.

23:19.680 --> 23:27.920
 Early detection and early action are key because when it's far away, you only have to deflect

23:27.920 --> 23:30.320
 it by a tiny little angle.

23:30.320 --> 23:37.160
 And then by the time it reaches us, the perpendicular motion is big enough to miss Earth.

23:37.160 --> 23:41.520
 All you need is one radius or one diameter of the Earth, right?

23:41.520 --> 23:47.540
 That actually means that all you would need to do is slow it down so it arrives four minutes

23:47.540 --> 23:54.320
 later or speed it up so it arrives four minutes earlier and Earth will have moved through

23:54.320 --> 23:56.400
 one radius in that time.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
 So it doesn't take much.

23:57.400 --> 24:02.600
 But you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you, you have to deflect it 90 degrees

24:02.600 --> 24:03.600
 or more, right?

24:03.600 --> 24:07.160
 You know, and you don't have much time to do so and you have to slow it down or speed

24:07.160 --> 24:09.280
 it up a lot if that's what you're trying to do to it.

24:09.280 --> 24:14.680
 And so decades is sufficient time, but months is not sufficient time.

24:14.680 --> 24:20.200
 So at that point, I would think the name of the game would be to try to predict where

24:20.200 --> 24:22.560
 it would hit.

24:22.560 --> 24:33.440
 And if it's in a heavily populated region, try to start an orderly evacuation perhaps.

24:33.440 --> 24:37.720
 But you know, that might cause just so much panic that I'm, how would you do with New

24:37.720 --> 24:41.400
 York City or Los Angeles or something like that, right?

24:41.400 --> 24:48.360
 I might have a different opinion a year ago, I'm a bit disheartened by, you know, in the

24:48.360 --> 24:54.760
 movies, there's always extreme competence from the government.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
 Competence, yeah.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.760
 Competence, yeah.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.720
 But we expect extreme incompetence, if anything, right?

24:59.720 --> 25:00.720
 Yes, no.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.240
 So I'm quite disappointed.

25:02.240 --> 25:07.000
 But sort of from a medical perspective, I think you're saying there, and a scientific

25:07.000 --> 25:13.080
 one, it's almost better to get better and better, maybe telescopes and data collection

25:13.080 --> 25:17.920
 to be able to predict the movement of these things, or like come up with totally new technologies

25:17.920 --> 25:24.240
 that you can imagine actually sending out, like probes out there to be able to sort of

25:24.240 --> 25:29.680
 almost have little finger sensors throughout our solar system to be able to detect stuff.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.680
 Well, that's right.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.640
 Yeah, monitoring the asteroid belt is very important and 99% of the so called near earth

25:35.640 --> 25:39.200
 objects ultimately come from the asteroid belt.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.640
 And so there we can track the trajectories and even if there's a close encounter between

25:43.640 --> 25:48.640
 two asteroids which deflects one of them toward earth, it's unlikely to be on a collision

25:48.640 --> 25:53.720
 course with earth in the immediate future, it's more like tens of years, so that gives

25:53.720 --> 25:54.860
 us time.

25:54.860 --> 26:00.840
 But we would need to improve our ability to detect the objects that come in from a great

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
 distance.

26:01.840 --> 26:09.720
 And those are much rarer, the comets come in, 1% of the collisions perhaps are with

26:09.720 --> 26:16.380
 comets that come in without any warning hardly.

26:16.380 --> 26:23.280
 So that might be more like a billion or two billion years before one of those hits us.

26:23.280 --> 26:28.240
 So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter on that time scale.

26:28.240 --> 26:34.760
 I mean, there's the possibility that a star will explode near us in the next couple of

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
 billion years.

26:35.760 --> 26:46.680
 But over the course of the history of life on earth, the estimates are that maybe only

26:46.680 --> 26:54.520
 one of the mass extinctions was caused by a star blowing up in particular, a special

26:54.520 --> 27:03.080
 kind called a gamma ray burst, and I think it's the Ordovician–Silurian extinction

27:03.080 --> 27:09.240
 420 or so, 440 million years ago that is speculated to have come from one of these particular

27:09.240 --> 27:12.240
 types of exploding stars called gamma ray bursts.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.680
 But even there, the evidence is circumstantial.

27:15.680 --> 27:20.800
 So those kinds of existential threats are reasonably rare.

27:20.800 --> 27:28.040
 The greater danger I think is civilization changing events where it's a much smaller

27:28.040 --> 27:37.200
 asteroid, which those are harder to detect, or a giant solar flare that shorts out the

27:37.200 --> 27:40.880
 grid in all of North America, let's say.

27:40.880 --> 27:46.560
 Now, astronomers are monitoring the sun 24 seven with various satellites and we can tell

27:46.560 --> 27:52.840
 when there's a flare or a coronal mass ejection and we can tell that in a day or two, a giant

27:52.840 --> 27:58.080
 bundle of energetic particles will arrive and twang the magnetic field of earth and

27:58.080 --> 28:03.120
 send all kinds of currents through long distance power lines and that's what shorts out the

28:03.120 --> 28:09.800
 transformers and transformers are expensive and hard to replace and hard to transport

28:09.800 --> 28:10.800
 and all that kind of stuff.

28:10.800 --> 28:18.640
 So if we can warn the power companies and they can shut down the grid before the big

28:18.640 --> 28:21.360
 bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this.

28:21.360 --> 28:27.080
 Now for a big enough bundle of particles, you can get short circuits even over small

28:27.080 --> 28:32.680
 distance scales, so not everything will be saved, but at least the whole grid might not

28:32.680 --> 28:33.680
 go out.

28:33.680 --> 28:40.400
 So again, astronomers, I like to say, support your local astronomer, they may help someday

28:40.400 --> 28:46.160
 save humanity by telling the power companies to shut down the grid, finding the asteroid

28:46.160 --> 28:52.260
 50 or 100 years before it hits, then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it.

28:52.260 --> 29:00.960
 So many of these cosmic threats, cosmic existential threats, we can actually predict and do something

29:00.960 --> 29:05.360
 about or observe before they hit and do something about.

29:05.360 --> 29:10.920
 So it's terrifying to think that people would listen to this conversation.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.600
 It's like when you listen to Bill Gates talk about pandemics in his Ted talk a few years

29:14.600 --> 29:19.480
 ago and realizing we should have supported our local astronomer more.

29:19.480 --> 29:24.520
 Well, I don't know whether it's more because as I said, I actually think human induced

29:24.520 --> 29:29.440
 threats or things that occur naturally on earth, either a natural pandemic or perhaps

29:29.440 --> 29:36.120
 a bioengineering type pandemic or something like a super volcano.

29:36.120 --> 29:44.080
 There was one event towed by I think it was 70 plus thousand years ago that caused a gigantic

29:44.080 --> 29:50.640
 decrease in temperatures on earth because it sent up so much soot that it blocked the

29:50.640 --> 29:51.640
 sun.

29:51.640 --> 29:55.420
 It's the nuclear winter type disaster scenario that some people including Carl Sagan talked

29:55.420 --> 29:57.440
 about decades ago.

29:57.440 --> 30:02.280
 What we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions even more recently in the 19th century,

30:02.280 --> 30:08.840
 Tambora and other ones, you look at the record and you see rather large dips in temperature

30:08.840 --> 30:12.120
 associated with massive volcanic eruptions.

30:12.120 --> 30:18.000
 Well these super volcanoes, one of which by the way exists under Yellowstone in the central

30:18.000 --> 30:25.400
 US, it's not just one or two states, it's a gigantic region and there's controversy

30:25.400 --> 30:30.880
 as to whether it's likely to blow anytime in the next 100,000 years or so.

30:30.880 --> 30:37.080
 But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction or perhaps not a complete existential threat

30:37.080 --> 30:43.220
 because you have to get rid of the very last humans for that, but at least getting rid

30:43.220 --> 30:49.460
 of killing off so many humans, truly billions and billions of humans.

30:49.460 --> 30:55.880
 There have been ones tens of thousands of years ago including this one, Toba I think

30:55.880 --> 31:02.880
 it's called, where it's estimated that the human population was down to 10,000 or 5,000

31:02.880 --> 31:05.040
 individuals, something like that.

31:05.040 --> 31:11.320
 If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature over quite a short time, it's not clear that

31:11.320 --> 31:15.960
 even with today's advanced technology, we would be able to adequately respond at least

31:15.960 --> 31:18.260
 for the vast majority of people.

31:18.260 --> 31:21.840
 Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you'd keep the president and a bunch

31:21.840 --> 31:28.080
 of other important people, but the typical person is not going to be protected when all

31:28.080 --> 31:32.120
 of agriculture is cut off.

31:32.120 --> 31:36.960
 It could be hundreds of millions or billions of people starving to death.

31:36.960 --> 31:37.960
 Exactly.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.960
 That's right.

31:38.960 --> 31:44.080
 They don't all die immediately, but they use up their supplies or again, this electrical

31:44.080 --> 31:45.080
 grid.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.080
 First of toilet paper.

31:46.080 --> 31:50.840
 Dash that toilet paper or the electrical grid.

31:50.840 --> 31:55.240
 Imagine North America without power for a year.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.420
 We've become so dependent, we're no longer the cave people.

31:58.420 --> 32:00.160
 They would do just fine.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.480
 What do they care about the electrical grid?

32:02.480 --> 32:06.040
 What do they care about agriculture, their hunters and gatherers?

32:06.040 --> 32:12.240
 But we now have become so used to our way of life that the only real survivors would

32:12.240 --> 32:17.520
 be those rugged individualists who live somewhere out in the forest or in a cave somewhere,

32:17.520 --> 32:20.160
 completely independent of anyone else.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.160
 Yeah.

32:21.160 --> 32:26.080
 Recently I recommended, it's totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks, but there's

32:26.080 --> 32:27.500
 a few shows.

32:27.500 --> 32:32.720
 There's a lot of shows of those, but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them

32:32.720 --> 32:37.040
 and they make a lot of sense.

32:37.040 --> 32:43.260
 They reveal to you how dependent we are on all aspects of this beautiful systems we human

32:43.260 --> 32:47.200
 have built and how fragile they are.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.380
 Incredibly fragile.

32:48.380 --> 32:53.040
 And this whole conversation is making me realize how lucky we are.

32:53.040 --> 32:59.240
 Oh, we're incredibly lucky, but we've set ourselves up to be very, very fragile and

32:59.240 --> 33:05.720
 we are intrinsically complex biological creatures that except for the fact that we have brains

33:05.720 --> 33:11.800
 and minds with which we can try to prevent some of these things or respond to them.

33:11.800 --> 33:18.700
 We as a living organism require quite a narrow set of conditions in order to survive.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.240
 We're not cockroaches.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.120
 We're not going to survive a nuclear war.

33:23.120 --> 33:31.360
 So we're kind of this beautiful dance between, we've been talking about astronomy, that astronomy,

33:31.360 --> 33:37.840
 the stars like inspires everybody and at the same time, there's this pragmatic aspect that

33:37.840 --> 33:39.140
 we're talking about.

33:39.140 --> 33:44.880
 And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way that it's reaching out to other

33:44.880 --> 33:48.760
 planets, reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful idea.

33:48.760 --> 33:56.800
 But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk, he talks about space exploration as very pragmatic.

33:56.800 --> 34:03.880
 Like we have to be, he has this ridiculous way of sounding like an engineer about it,

34:03.880 --> 34:09.440
 which is like, it's obvious we need to become a multi planetary species if we were to survive

34:09.440 --> 34:10.540
 long term.

34:10.540 --> 34:18.080
 So maybe both philosophically in terms of beauty and in terms of practical, what's your

34:18.080 --> 34:24.260
 thoughts on space exploration, on the challenges of it, on how much we should be investing

34:24.260 --> 34:30.760
 in it and on a personal level, like how excited you are by the possibility of going to Mars,

34:30.760 --> 34:34.600
 colonizing Mars and maybe going outside the solar system.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
 Yeah.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.920
 You know, great question.

34:37.920 --> 34:41.280
 There's a lot to unpack there of course.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.460
 Humans are by their very nature explorers, pioneers.

34:44.460 --> 34:51.440
 They want to go out, climb the next mountain, see what's behind it, explore the option depths,

34:51.440 --> 34:52.460
 explore space.

34:52.460 --> 34:55.360
 This is our destiny to go out there.

34:55.360 --> 35:02.420
 And of course, from a pragmatic perspective, yes, we need to plant our seeds elsewhere

35:02.420 --> 35:05.480
 really because things could go wrong here on Earth.

35:05.480 --> 35:11.080
 Now some people say that's an excuse to not take care of our planet.

35:11.080 --> 35:14.280
 Well, we say we're elsewhere and so we don't have to take good care of our planet.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.160
 No, we should take the best possible care of our planet.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.120
 We should be cognizant of the potential impact of what we're doing.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.880
 Nevertheless, it's prudent to have us be elsewhere as well.

35:26.880 --> 35:31.200
 So in that regard, I actually agree with Elon.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.420
 It'd be good to be on Mars.

35:32.420 --> 35:38.240
 That would be yet another place for us from which to explore further.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.640
 Would that be a good next step?

35:39.640 --> 35:42.160
 Well, it's a good next step.

35:42.160 --> 35:46.360
 I happen to disagree with him as to how quickly it will happen.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.120
 I think he's very optimistic.

35:48.120 --> 35:52.760
 Now you need visionary people like Elon to get people going and to inspire them.

35:52.760 --> 35:57.120
 I mean, look at the success he's had with multiple companies.

35:57.120 --> 36:03.480
 So maybe he gives this very optimistic timeline in order to be inspirational to those who

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
 are going out there.

36:04.480 --> 36:10.000
 And certainly his success with the rocket that is reusable because it landed upright

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
 and all that.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.400
 I mean, that's a game changer.

36:12.400 --> 36:16.880
 It's sort of like every time you flew from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you discard

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
 the airplane, right?

36:17.880 --> 36:20.240
 I mean, that's crazy, right?

36:20.240 --> 36:21.840
 So that's a game changer.

36:21.840 --> 36:27.080
 But nevertheless, the timescale over which he thinks that there could be a real thriving

36:27.080 --> 36:30.680
 colony on Mars, I think is far too optimistic.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.480
 What's the biggest challenges to you?

36:33.480 --> 36:40.360
 One is just getting rockets, not rockets, but people out there and two is the colonization.

36:40.360 --> 36:44.360
 Do you have thoughts about this, the challenges of this kind of prospect?

36:44.360 --> 36:50.040
 Yeah, I haven't thought about it in great detail other than recognizing that Mars is

36:50.040 --> 36:51.040
 a harsh environment.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.040
 Yeah.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.360
 You don't have much of an atmosphere there.

36:53.360 --> 36:57.000
 You've got less than a percent of Earth's atmosphere.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.320
 So you'd need to build some sort of a dome right away, right?

37:00.320 --> 37:02.280
 And that would take time.

37:02.280 --> 37:09.280
 You need to melt the water that's in the permafrost or have canals dug from which you transport

37:09.280 --> 37:11.840
 it from the polar ice caps.

37:11.840 --> 37:17.240
 You know, I was reading recently in terms of like, what's the most efficient source

37:17.240 --> 37:20.440
 of nutrition for humans that were to live on Mars?

37:20.440 --> 37:23.480
 And people should look into this, but it turns out to be insects.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.480
 Insects.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.480
 Yeah.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.680
 So you want, you want to build giant colonies of insects and just be eating them.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.680
 Yeah, insects have a lot of protein.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.000
 Yeah, a lot of protein.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.280
 And they're easy to grow.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.200
 Like you can think of them as farming.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.200
 Right.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.960
 But it's not going to be as easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes like in the movie

37:41.960 --> 37:44.240
 The Martian, you know, or something, right?

37:44.240 --> 37:45.880
 It's not going to be that easy.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.420
 But you know, so there's this thin atmosphere.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.620
 It's got the wrong composition.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.820
 It's mostly carbon dioxide.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.900
 There are these violent dust storms.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.800
 The temperatures are generally cold.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.360
 You know, you'd need to do a lot of things.

37:59.360 --> 38:04.840
 You need to terraform it basically in order to make it nicely livable without some dome

38:04.840 --> 38:05.840
 surrounding you.

38:05.840 --> 38:10.880
 And if you, and if you insist on a dome, well, that's not going to house that many people,

38:10.880 --> 38:11.880
 right?

38:11.880 --> 38:17.480
 You know, so let's look, let's look briefly then, you know, we're looking for a new apartment

38:17.480 --> 38:18.480
 to move into.

38:18.480 --> 38:19.480
 Right.

38:19.480 --> 38:20.480
 So let's look outside the solar system.

38:20.480 --> 38:25.440
 Do you think you've, you've spoken about exoplanets as well?

38:25.440 --> 38:31.840
 Do you think there's possible homes out there for us outside of our solar system?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.960
 There are lots and lots of homes.

38:33.960 --> 38:34.960
 Possible homes.

38:34.960 --> 38:40.480
 There are, there's a planetary system around nearly every star you see in the sky.

38:40.480 --> 38:45.920
 And one in five of those is thought to have a roughly Earth like planet.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
 And that's a relatively new discovery.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
 Yeah.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
 It's a new discovery.

38:48.920 --> 38:53.320
 I mean, the Kepler satellite, which was flying around above Earth's atmosphere was able to

38:53.320 --> 38:57.180
 monitor the brightness of stars with exquisite detail.

38:57.180 --> 39:03.880
 And they could detect planets crossing the line of sight between us and the star, thereby

39:03.880 --> 39:08.080
 dimming its light for a short time ever so slightly.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.240
 And it's amazing.

39:09.240 --> 39:14.120
 So there are now thousands and thousands of these exoplanet candidates of which something

39:14.120 --> 39:17.380
 like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets.

39:17.380 --> 39:25.100
 And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars have their planetary system oriented

39:25.100 --> 39:30.960
 edge on to your line of sight, which is what you need for this transit method to work,

39:30.960 --> 39:31.960
 right?

39:31.960 --> 39:36.200
 Your planetary angle won't work and certainly perpendicular to your line of sight.

39:36.200 --> 39:40.920
 That is in the plane of the sky won't work because the planet is orbiting the star and

39:40.920 --> 39:43.680
 never crossing your line of sight.

39:43.680 --> 39:51.240
 So the fact that they found planets orbiting about 1% of the stars that they looked at

39:51.240 --> 39:57.720
 in this field of 150 plus thousand stars, they found planets around 1%.

39:57.720 --> 40:06.820
 You then multiply by the inverse of 1%, which is 1% is about what the fraction of the stars

40:06.820 --> 40:10.720
 that have their planetary system oriented the right way.

40:10.720 --> 40:16.840
 And that already back of the envelope calculation tells you that of order 50 to 100% of all

40:16.840 --> 40:18.280
 stars have planets.

40:18.280 --> 40:21.780
 And then they've been finding these Earth like planets, et cetera, et cetera.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.840
 So there are many potential homes.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.680
 The problem is getting there.

40:26.680 --> 40:32.720
 So then a typical bright star, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, maybe not a typical

40:32.720 --> 40:37.600
 bright star, but it's 8.7 light years away.

40:37.600 --> 40:43.440
 So that means the light took 8.7 years to reach us.

40:43.440 --> 40:47.460
 We're seeing it as it was about nine years ago.

40:47.460 --> 40:54.560
 So then you ask how long would a rocket take to get there at Earth's escape speed, which

40:54.560 --> 40:57.000
 is 11 kilometers per second.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.540
 And it turns out it's about a quarter of a million years.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.120
 Now that's 10,000 generations.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.360
 Let's say a generation of humans is 25 years.

41:07.360 --> 41:14.760
 So you'd need this colony of people that is able to sustain itself, all their food, all

41:14.760 --> 41:18.660
 their waste disposal, all their water, all the recycling of everything.

41:18.660 --> 41:26.800
 For 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves to living on this vehicle.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.920
 I just don't see it happening.

41:28.920 --> 41:34.520
 What I see potentially happening, if we avoid self destruction, intentional or unintentional

41:34.520 --> 41:40.960
 here on Earth, is that machines will do it, robots that can essentially hibernate.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.640
 They don't need to do much of anything for a long, long time as they're traveling.

41:44.640 --> 41:50.720
 And moreover, if some energetic charged particle, some cosmic ray, hits the circuitry, it fixes

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
 itself.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.800
 Machines can do this.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.940
 It's a form of artificial intelligence.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.100
 You just tell the thing, fix yourself basically.

42:00.100 --> 42:05.920
 And then when you land on the planet, start producing copies of yourself, initially from

42:05.920 --> 42:10.280
 materials that were perhaps sent, or you just have a bunch of copies there.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.740
 And then they set up factories with which to do this.

42:13.740 --> 42:20.800
 This is very, very futuristic, but it's much more feasible, I think, than sending flesh

42:20.800 --> 42:28.480
 and blood over interstellar distances, a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars.

42:28.480 --> 42:32.180
 You're subject to all kinds of charged particles and radiation.

42:32.180 --> 42:34.440
 You have to shield yourself really well.

42:34.440 --> 42:38.080
 That's by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars is that it's not a three day

42:38.080 --> 42:40.040
 journey like going to the moon.

42:40.040 --> 42:45.460
 You're out there for the better part of a year or two, and you're exposed to lots of

42:45.460 --> 42:52.560
 radiation, which typically doesn't do well with living tissue, or living tissue doesn't

42:52.560 --> 42:54.800
 do well with the radiation.

42:54.800 --> 43:05.400
 And the hope is that the robots, the AI systems might be able to carry the fire of consciousness,

43:05.400 --> 43:11.120
 whatever makes us humans, like a little drop of whatever makes us humans so special, not

43:11.120 --> 43:12.720
 to be too poetic about it.

43:12.720 --> 43:17.480
 No, but I like being poetic about it because it's an amazing question.

43:17.480 --> 43:22.400
 Is there something beyond just the bits, the ones and zeros to us?

43:22.400 --> 43:24.760
 It's an interesting question.

43:24.760 --> 43:29.520
 I like to think that there isn't anything, and that how beautiful it is that our thoughts,

43:29.520 --> 43:35.880
 our emotions, our feelings, our compassion all come from these ones and zeros, right?

43:35.880 --> 43:38.800
 That to me actually is a beautiful thought.

43:38.800 --> 43:45.520
 And the idea that machines, silicon based life effectively, could be our natural evolutionary

43:45.520 --> 43:51.360
 descendants, not from a DNA perspective, but they are our creations and they then carry

43:51.360 --> 43:52.360
 on.

43:52.360 --> 43:55.880
 That to me is a beautiful thought in some ways, but others find it to be a horrific

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
 thought.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.480
 So that's exciting to you.

43:58.480 --> 44:05.240
 It is exciting to me as well because to me, from a purely an engineering perspective,

44:05.240 --> 44:11.280
 I believe it's impossible to create, like whatever systems we create that take over

44:11.280 --> 44:17.540
 the world, it's impossible for me to imagine that those systems will not carry some aspect

44:17.540 --> 44:19.840
 of what makes humans beautiful.

44:19.840 --> 44:26.000
 So like a lot of people have these kind of paperclip ideas that we'll build machines

44:26.000 --> 44:31.240
 that are cold inside or philosophers call them zombies.

44:31.240 --> 44:41.660
 That naturally the systems that will out compete us on this earth will be cold and non conscious,

44:41.660 --> 44:48.720
 not capable of all the human emotions and empathy and compassion and love and hate,

44:48.720 --> 44:53.160
 the beautiful mix of what makes us human.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.520
 But to me, intelligence requires all of that.

44:56.520 --> 45:01.680
 So in order to out compete humans, you better be good at the full picture.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.680
 Right.

45:02.680 --> 45:08.280
 So artificial general intelligence, in my view, encompasses a lot of these attributes

45:08.280 --> 45:13.540
 that you just talked about, curiosity, inquisitiveness, you know, right?

45:13.540 --> 45:17.160
 It might look very different than us humans, but it will have some of the magic.

45:17.160 --> 45:24.120
 But it'll also be much more able to survive the onslaught of existential threats that

45:24.120 --> 45:30.040
 either we bring upon ourselves or don't anticipate here on earth, or that occasionally come from

45:30.040 --> 45:34.400
 beyond and there's nothing much we can do about a supernova explosion that just suddenly

45:34.400 --> 45:36.200
 goes off.

45:36.200 --> 45:42.640
 And really, if we want to move to other planets outside our solar system, I think realistically

45:42.640 --> 45:48.200
 that's a much better option than thinking that humans will actually make these gigantic

45:48.200 --> 45:49.200
 journeys.

45:49.200 --> 45:53.280
 And, you know, then I do this calculation for my class, you know, Einstein's special

45:53.280 --> 45:57.360
 theory of relativity says that you can do it in a short amount of time in your own frame

45:57.360 --> 46:00.520
 of reference if you go close to the speed of light.

46:00.520 --> 46:05.680
 But then you bring in E equals MC squared and you figure out how much energy it takes

46:05.680 --> 46:10.880
 to get you accelerated to close enough to the speed of light to make the time scales

46:10.880 --> 46:13.880
 short in your own frame of reference.

46:13.880 --> 46:17.380
 And the amount of energy is just unfathomable, right?

46:17.380 --> 46:22.120
 We can do it at the Large Hadron Collider with protons, you know, we can accelerate

46:22.120 --> 46:27.560
 them to 99.9999% of the speed of light, but that's just a proton.

46:27.560 --> 46:29.800
 We're gazillions of protons, okay?

46:29.800 --> 46:34.040
 And that doesn't even count the rocket that would carry us, the payload.

46:34.040 --> 46:39.900
 And you would need to either store the fuel in the rocket, which then requires even more

46:39.900 --> 46:44.920
 mass for the rocket or collect fuel along the way, which, you know, is difficult.

46:44.920 --> 46:49.880
 And so getting close to the speed of light, I think, is not an option either other than

46:49.880 --> 46:54.840
 for a little tiny thing like, you know, Yuri Milner and others are thinking about this,

46:54.840 --> 47:00.040
 the Starshot project where they'll send a little tiny camera to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light

47:00.040 --> 47:01.040
 years away.

47:01.040 --> 47:06.080
 They'll zip past it, take a picture of the exoplanets that we know, orbit that three

47:06.080 --> 47:09.320
 or more star system and say hello real quick.

47:09.320 --> 47:12.760
 Say hello real quickly and then send the images back to us, okay?

47:12.760 --> 47:15.060
 So that's a tiny little thing, right?

47:15.060 --> 47:19.960
 Maybe you can accelerate that to, they're hoping, 20% of the speed of light with a whole

47:19.960 --> 47:22.680
 bunch of high powered lasers aimed at it.

47:22.680 --> 47:26.480
 It's not clear that other countries will allow us to do that, by the way, but that's a very

47:26.480 --> 47:27.480
 forward looking thought.

47:27.480 --> 47:31.600
 I mean, I very much support the idea, but there's a big difference between sending a

47:31.600 --> 47:38.920
 little tiny camera and sending a payload of people with equipment that could then mine

47:38.920 --> 47:46.400
 the resources on the exoplanet that they reach and then go forth and multiply, right?

47:46.400 --> 47:51.920
 Well, let's talk about the big galactic things and how we might be able to leverage them

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
 to travel fast.

47:52.920 --> 48:03.200
 I know this is a little bit science fiction, but, you know, ideas of wormholes and ideas

48:03.200 --> 48:10.680
 at the edge of black holes that reveal to us that this fabric of space time could be

48:10.680 --> 48:13.240
 messed with, perhaps.

48:13.240 --> 48:16.680
 Is that at all an interesting thing for you?

48:16.680 --> 48:24.840
 I mean, in looking out at the universe and studying it as you have, is that also a possible,

48:24.840 --> 48:29.720
 like a dream for you that we might be able to find clues how we can actually use it to

48:29.720 --> 48:31.600
 improve our transportation?

48:31.600 --> 48:32.600
 It's an interesting thought.

48:32.600 --> 48:40.400
 I'm certainly excited by the potential physics that suggests this kind of faster than light

48:40.400 --> 48:45.320
 travel effectively or, you know, cutting the distance to make it very, very short through

48:45.320 --> 48:47.280
 a wormhole or something like that.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
 Possible?

48:48.280 --> 48:49.280
 No?

48:49.280 --> 48:54.000
 Well, you know, call me not very imaginative, but based on today's knowledge of physics,

48:54.000 --> 48:58.600
 which I realize, you know, people have gone down that rabbit hole and, you know, a century

48:58.600 --> 49:03.440
 ago, Lord Kelvin, one of the greatest physicists of all time, said that all of fundamental

49:03.440 --> 49:07.280
 physics is done, the rest is just engineering, and guess what?

49:07.280 --> 49:12.340
 Then came special relativity, quantum physics, general relativity, how wrong he was.

49:12.340 --> 49:15.120
 So let me not be another Lord Kelvin.

49:15.120 --> 49:20.360
 On the other hand, I think we know a lot more now about what we know and what we don't know

49:20.360 --> 49:23.340
 and what the physical limitations are.

49:23.340 --> 49:30.300
 And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them, seem very farfetched, if not impossible.

49:30.300 --> 49:36.820
 So travel through wormholes, for example, you know, it appears that for a non rotating

49:36.820 --> 49:42.480
 black hole, that's just a complete no go because the singularity is a point like singularity

49:42.480 --> 49:49.640
 and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole and you get squished by the singularity, okay?

49:49.640 --> 49:55.000
 Now for a rotating black hole, it turns out there is a way to pass through the event horizon,

49:55.000 --> 49:59.940
 the boundary of the black hole, and avoid the singularity and go out the other side

49:59.940 --> 50:04.220
 or even traverse the donut hole like singularity.

50:04.220 --> 50:06.880
 In the case of a rotating black hole, it's a ring singularity.

50:06.880 --> 50:11.400
 So there's actually two theoretical ways you could get through a rotating black hole or

50:11.400 --> 50:16.320
 a charged black hole, not that we expect charged black holes to exist in nature because they

50:16.320 --> 50:21.040
 would quickly bring in the opposite charge so as to neutralize themselves.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.640
 But rotating black holes, definitely a reality.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.720
 We now have good evidence for them.

50:25.720 --> 50:29.240
 Do they have traversable wormholes?

50:29.240 --> 50:34.760
 Probably not because it's still the case that when you go in, you go in with so much energy

50:34.760 --> 50:42.280
 that it either squeezes the wormhole shut or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming

50:42.280 --> 50:46.080
 and outgoing energy that vaporizes you.

50:46.080 --> 50:50.600
 It's called the mass inflation instability, and it just sort of vaporizes you.

50:50.600 --> 50:55.060
 Nevertheless, you could imagine, well, you're in some vapor form, but if you make it through,

50:55.060 --> 50:58.200
 maybe you could reform or something.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
 So it's still information.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.200
 Yeah, it's still information.

51:00.200 --> 51:04.480
 It's scrambled information, but there's a way maybe of bringing it back, right?

51:04.480 --> 51:11.680
 But then the thing that really bothers me is that as soon as you have this possibility

51:11.680 --> 51:16.760
 of traversal of a wormhole, you have to come to grips with a fundamental problem, and that

51:16.760 --> 51:24.400
 is that you could come back to your universe at a time prior to your leaving, and you could

51:24.400 --> 51:27.480
 essentially prevent your grandparents from ever meeting.

51:27.480 --> 51:29.580
 This is called the grandfather paradox, right?

51:29.580 --> 51:33.880
 And if they never met, and if your parents were never born, and if you were never born,

51:33.880 --> 51:44.880
 how would you have made the journey to prevent the history from allowing you to exist, right?

51:44.880 --> 51:48.560
 It's a violation of causality, of cause and effect.

51:48.560 --> 51:54.720
 Now physicists such as myself take causality violation very, very seriously.

51:54.720 --> 51:55.720
 We've never seen it.

51:55.720 --> 51:56.720
 You took a stand.

51:56.720 --> 52:01.600
 Yeah, I mean, it's one of these back to the future type movies, right?

52:01.600 --> 52:06.640
 And you have to work things out in such a way that you don't mess things up, right?

52:06.640 --> 52:10.500
 Some people say that, well, you come back to the universe, but you come back in such

52:10.500 --> 52:14.960
 a way that you cannot affect your journey.

52:14.960 --> 52:19.360
 But then that seems kind of contrived to me.

52:19.360 --> 52:24.640
 Or some say that you end up in a different universe, and this also goes into the many

52:24.640 --> 52:28.880
 different types of the multiverse hypothesis and the many worlds interpretation and all

52:28.880 --> 52:29.880
 that.

52:29.880 --> 52:34.000
 And then it's not the universe from which you left, right?

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
 And you don't come back to the universe from which you left.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.700
 And so you're not really going back in time to the same universe, and you're not even

52:42.700 --> 52:46.720
 going forward in time necessarily then to the same universe, right?

52:46.720 --> 52:50.200
 You're ending up in some other universe.

52:50.200 --> 52:53.680
 So what have you achieved, right?

52:53.680 --> 52:56.600
 You've traveled.

52:56.600 --> 53:00.720
 You ended up in a different place than you started in more ways than one.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.720
 Yeah.

53:01.720 --> 53:07.320
 And then there's this idea, the Alcubierre drive, where you warp space time in front

53:07.320 --> 53:12.480
 of you so as to greatly reduce the distance, and you can expand the space time behind you.

53:12.480 --> 53:16.120
 So you're sort of riding a wave through space time.

53:16.120 --> 53:20.440
 But the problem I see with that, beyond the practical difficulties and the energy requirements,

53:20.440 --> 53:25.740
 and by the way, how do you get out of this bubble through which you're riding this wave

53:25.740 --> 53:26.740
 of space time?

53:26.740 --> 53:29.160
 And Miguel Alcubierre acknowledged all these things.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.880
 He said this is purely theoretical, fanciful, and all that.

53:31.880 --> 53:38.280
 But a fundamental problem I see is that you'd have to get to those places in front of you

53:38.280 --> 53:44.080
 so as to change the shape of space time so as to make the journey quickly.

53:44.080 --> 53:49.320
 But to get there, you got there in the normal way at a speed considerably less than that

53:49.320 --> 53:50.740
 of light.

53:50.740 --> 53:53.640
 So in a sense, you haven't saved any time, right?

53:53.640 --> 54:00.680
 You might as well have just taken that journey and gotten to where you were going, right?

54:00.680 --> 54:01.680
 What have you done?

54:01.680 --> 54:06.480
 It's not like you snap your fingers and say, okay, let that space there be compressed,

54:06.480 --> 54:10.040
 and then I'll make it over to Alpha Centauri in the next month.

54:10.040 --> 54:12.240
 You can't snap your fingers and do that.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.240
 Yeah.

54:13.240 --> 54:18.260
 But yeah, we're sort of assuming that we can fix all the biological stuff that requires

54:18.260 --> 54:24.560
 for humans to persist through that whole process, because ultimately, it might go down to just

54:24.560 --> 54:29.360
 extending the life of the human in some form, whether it's through the robot, through the

54:29.360 --> 54:35.240
 digital form, or actually just figuring out genetically how to live forever, because that

54:35.240 --> 54:41.800
 journey that you mentioned, the long journey, might be different if somehow our understanding

54:41.800 --> 54:47.280
 of genetics, of our understanding of our own biology, all that kind of stuff, that's another

54:47.280 --> 54:48.280
 trajectory that possibly...

54:48.280 --> 54:49.280
 Well, right.

54:49.280 --> 54:54.080
 If you could put us into some sort of suspended animation, hibernation or something, and greatly

54:54.080 --> 54:58.580
 increase the lifetime, and so these 10,000 generations I talked about, what do they care?

54:58.580 --> 55:00.960
 It's just one generation, and they're asleep, okay?

55:00.960 --> 55:02.280
 It's a long nap.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.500
 So then you can do it.

55:04.500 --> 55:05.500
 It's still not easy, right?

55:05.500 --> 55:09.320
 Because you've got some big old huge colony, and that just through E equals MC squared,

55:09.320 --> 55:10.320
 right?

55:10.320 --> 55:11.320
 That's a lot of mass.

55:11.320 --> 55:13.480
 That's a lot of stuff to accelerate.

55:13.480 --> 55:18.200
 The Newtonian kinetic energy is gigantic, right?

55:18.200 --> 55:23.480
 So you're still not home free, but at least you're not trying to do it in a short amount

55:23.480 --> 55:26.240
 of clock time, right?

55:26.240 --> 55:32.520
 Which if you look at E equals MC squared, requires truly unfathomable amounts of energy,

55:32.520 --> 55:39.800
 because the energy is your rest mass, M naught C squared, divided by the square root of one

55:39.800 --> 55:42.200
 minus V squared over C squared.

55:42.200 --> 55:46.440
 And if your listeners want to just sort of stick into their pocket calculator, as V over

55:46.440 --> 55:52.100
 C approaches one, that one over the square root of one minus V squared over C squared

55:52.100 --> 55:54.160
 approaches infinity.

55:54.160 --> 55:58.520
 So if you wanted to do it in zero time, you'd need an infinite amount of energy.

55:58.520 --> 56:04.680
 That's basically why you can't reach, let alone exceed the speed of light, for a particle

56:04.680 --> 56:07.960
 moving through a preexisting space.

56:07.960 --> 56:11.640
 It's that it takes an infinite amount of energy to do so.

56:11.640 --> 56:15.080
 So that's talking about us going somewhere.

56:15.080 --> 56:22.040
 What about, one of the things that inspires a lot of folks, including myself, is the possibility

56:22.040 --> 56:27.920
 that there's other, that this conversation is happening on another planet in different

56:27.920 --> 56:35.360
 forms with intelligent life forms.

56:35.360 --> 56:41.840
 So first we could start, as a cosmologist, what's your intuition about whether there

56:41.840 --> 56:45.400
 is or isn't intelligent life out there?

56:45.400 --> 56:46.400
 Outside of our own?

56:46.400 --> 56:51.280
 Yeah, I would say I'm one of the pessimists in that I don't necessarily think that we're

56:51.280 --> 56:57.880
 the only ones in the observable universe, which goes out, you know, roughly 14 billion

56:57.880 --> 57:02.640
 years in light travel time and more like, you know, 46 billion years when you take into

57:02.640 --> 57:04.280
 account the expansion of space.

57:04.280 --> 57:08.480
 So the diameter of our observable universe is something like, you know, 90, 92 billion

57:08.480 --> 57:09.700
 light years.

57:09.700 --> 57:16.040
 That encompasses, you know, a hundred billion to a trillion galaxies with, you know, a hundred

57:16.040 --> 57:17.280
 billion stars each.

57:17.280 --> 57:22.400
 So now you're talking about something like 10 to the 22nd, 10 to the 23rd power stars

57:22.400 --> 57:27.880
 and roughly an equal number of Earth like planets and so on.

57:27.880 --> 57:32.000
 So there may well be other intelligent life.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.120
 But your sense is our galaxy is not teeming with life.

57:35.120 --> 57:41.080
 Yeah, our galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy with several hundred billion stars and potentially

57:41.080 --> 57:44.080
 habitable planets is not teeming with intelligent life.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.080
 Intelligent.

57:45.080 --> 57:51.520
 Yeah, I wouldn't, well, I'll get to the primitive life, the bacteria in a moment, but, you know,

57:51.520 --> 57:56.920
 we may well be the only ones in our Milky Way galaxy, at most a handful, I'd say, but

57:56.920 --> 58:03.200
 I'd probably side with the school of thought that suggests we're the only ones in our own

58:03.200 --> 58:13.520
 galaxy, just because I don't see human intelligence as being a natural evolutionary path for life.

58:13.520 --> 58:16.000
 I mean, there's a number of arguments.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
 First of all, there's been more than 10 billion species of life on Earth in its history.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.400
 Everything has approached our level of intelligence and mechanical ability and curiosity.

58:27.400 --> 58:31.600
 You know, whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent, but there's no evidence

58:31.600 --> 58:35.360
 that they can think abstract thoughts that they're curious about the world.

58:35.360 --> 58:39.720
 They certainly can't build machines with which to study the world.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.520
 So that's one argument.

58:41.520 --> 58:47.560
 Secondly, we came about as early hominids only four or five million years ago and as

58:47.560 --> 58:52.100
 homo sapiens only about a quarter of a million years ago.

58:52.100 --> 58:56.920
 So for the vast majority of the history of life on Earth, an intelligent alien zipping

58:56.920 --> 59:02.640
 by Earth would have said there's nothing particularly intelligent or mechanically able on Earth.

59:02.640 --> 59:03.640
 Okay.

59:03.640 --> 59:10.760
 Thirdly, it's not clear that our intelligence is a long term evolutionary advantage.

59:10.760 --> 59:15.680
 Now it's clear that in the last 100 years, 200 years, we've improved the lives of hundreds

59:15.680 --> 59:21.800
 of millions of people, but at the risk of potentially destroying ourselves either intentionally

59:21.800 --> 59:26.200
 or unintentionally or through neglect, as we discussed before.

59:26.200 --> 59:32.120
 That's a really interesting point, which is it's possible that they're a huge amount of

59:32.120 --> 59:38.200
 intelligent civilizations have been born even through our galaxy, but they live very briefly

59:38.200 --> 59:39.200
 and they die.

59:39.200 --> 59:42.200
 Flash bulbs in the night.

59:42.200 --> 59:47.960
 That brings me to the fourth issue and that is the Fermi paradox.

59:47.960 --> 59:52.440
 If they're common, where the hell are they?

59:52.440 --> 59:56.480
 Notwithstanding the various UFO reports in Roswell and all that, they just don't meet

59:56.480 --> 59:57.700
 the bar.

59:57.700 --> 1:00:02.680
 They don't clear the bar of scientific evidence in my opinion.

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:08.240
 So there's no clear evidence that they've ever visited us on Earth here.

1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:13.440
 And SETI has been now, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been scanning the skies and

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:17.320
 true, we've only looked a couple of hundred light years out and that's a tiny fraction

1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:22.560
 of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction of these hundred billion plus stars.

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:30.540
 Nevertheless, if the galaxy were teaming with life, especially intelligent life, you'd expect

1:00:30.540 --> 1:00:34.800
 some of it to have been far more advanced than ours.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:39.880
 There's nothing special about when the industrial revolution started on Earth.

1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.420
 The chemical evolution of our galaxy was such that billions of years ago, nuclear processing

1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:51.280
 and stars had built up clouds of gas after their explosion that were rich enough in heavy

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:54.680
 elements to have formed Earth like planets, even billions of years ago.

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:58.960
 So there could be civilizations that are billions of years ahead of ours.

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.680
 And if you look at the exponential growth of technology among Homo sapiens in the last

1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:07.400
 couple of hundred years and you just project that forward, I mean, there's no telling what

1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:13.360
 they could have achieved even in 1000 or 10,000 years, let alone a million or 10 million or

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:15.300
 a billion years.

1:01:15.300 --> 1:01:21.120
 And if they reach this capability of interstellar travel and colonization, then you can show

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:25.860
 that within 10 million years or certainly a hundred million years, you can populate

1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:28.960
 the whole galaxy.

1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:33.680
 So then you don't have to have tried to detect them beyond a hundred or a thousand light

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:34.680
 years.

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:35.680
 They would already be here.

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:41.360
 Do you think as a thought experiment, do you think it's possible that they are already

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:47.720
 here, but we humans are so human centric that we're just not like our conception of what

1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:53.720
 intelligent life looks like is, we don't want to acknowledge it.

1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:54.720
 Like what if trees?

1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:55.720
 Right.

1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:56.720
 Right.

1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:57.720
 Right.

1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:02.640
 Okay, I guess the, in the form of a question, do you think we'll actually detect intelligent

1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.480
 life if it came to visit us?

1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:05.480
 Yeah.

1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:08.240
 I mean, it's like, you know, you're an ant crawling around on a sidewalk somewhere and

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.160
 do you notice the humans wandering around and the empire state building and you know,

1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:16.760
 rocket ships flying to the moon and all that kind of stuff, right?

1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:21.340
 It's conceivable that we haven't detected it and that we're so primitive compared to

1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:23.240
 them that we're just not able to do so.

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:27.540
 Like if you look at dark energy, maybe we call it as a field.

1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:33.800
 It's just that my own feeling is that in science now through observations and experiments,

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:40.000
 we've measured so many things and basically we understand a lot of stuff.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000
 Okay.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000
 Fabric of reality.

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000
 Yeah.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000
 The fabric of reality, we understand quite well.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.480
 And there are a few little things like dark matter and dark energy that may be some sign

1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:50.240
 of some super intelligence, but I doubt it.

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:51.240
 Okay.

1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:54.480
 You know, why would some super intelligence be holding clusters of galaxies together?

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.280
 Why would they be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe?

1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:04.440
 So the point is, is that through science and applied science and engineering, we understand

1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:09.920
 so much now that I'm not saying we know everything, but we know a hell of a lot.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:10.920
 Okay.

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:14.820
 And so there's, it's not like there are lots of mysteries flying around there that are

1:03:14.820 --> 1:03:23.560
 completely outside our level of exploration or understanding.

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:24.920
 Yeah.

1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:32.760
 From a, I would say from, from a mystery perspective, it seems like the mystery of our own like

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:38.760
 cognition and consciousness is much grander than like the degrees of freedom of possible

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:42.840
 explanations for what the heck is going on is much greater there than in the, in the

1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.440
 physics of the observed.

1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.000
 How the brain works.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.560
 How did life arise?

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:48.560
 Yeah.

1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:50.500
 That's big, big questions.

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:57.000
 But they, to me, don't indicate the existence of, of, of an alien or something.

1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.760
 I mean, unless we are the aliens, you know, we could have been contamination from some

1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:06.120
 rocket ship that, that hit here a long, long time ago and all evidence of it has been destroyed.

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:09.740
 But again, that alien would have started out somewhere.

1:04:09.740 --> 1:04:14.260
 They're not, they're not here watching us right now, right?

1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:16.060
 They're not among us.

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:22.480
 And so though there are expert potential explanations for the Fermi paradox, and one of them that

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:29.120
 I kind of like is that the truly intelligent creatures are those that decided not to colonize

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.280
 the whole galaxy because they'd quickly run out of room there because it's exponential,

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:34.280
 right?

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:39.480
 You send a probe to a planet, it makes two copies, they go out, they make two copies

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:41.480
 each and it's an exponential, right?

1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:43.200
 They quickly colonize the whole galaxy.

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:47.620
 But then the distance to the next galaxy, the next big one like Andromeda, that's two

1:04:47.620 --> 1:04:50.080
 and a half million light years.

1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:52.480
 That's a much grander scale now, right?

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:59.080
 And so it also could be that the reason they survived this long is that they got over this

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:06.720
 tendency that may well exist among sufficiently intelligent creatures, this tendency for aggression

1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:09.280
 and self destruction, right?

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:14.480
 If they bypass that, and that may be one of the great filters if there are more than one,

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:15.480
 right?

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:21.800
 Then they may not be a type of creature that feels the need to go and say, oh, there's

1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:28.640
 a nice looking planet and there's a bunch of ants on it, let's go squish them and colonize

1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:29.640
 it.

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:34.120
 No, it could even be the kind of Star Trek like prime directive where you go and explore

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.340
 worlds, but you don't interfere in any way, right?

1:05:38.340 --> 1:05:44.080
 And also we call it exploration is beautiful and everything, but there is underlying this

1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:47.240
 desire to explore is a desire to conquer.

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.240
 Yeah.

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:52.720
 I mean, if we're just being really honest right now for us, it is right.

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:58.960
 And you're saying it's possible to separate, but I would venture to say that you wouldn't

1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:00.280
 that those are coupled.

1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:06.160
 So I could, I could imagine a civilization that lives on for billions of years that just

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:12.440
 stays on, it's like figures out the minimal effort way of just peacefully existing.

1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:13.440
 It's like a monastery.

1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:14.440
 Yeah.

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:15.440
 And it limits itself.

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:16.440
 Yeah.

1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:17.440
 It limits itself.

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:19.560
 You know, it's, it's planted its seeds in a number of places.

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:24.280
 So it's not vulnerable to a single point failure, right?

1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:28.760
 Supernova going off near one of these stars or something, or an asteroid or a comet coming

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:33.320
 in from the Oort cloud equivalent of that planetary system and without warning, you

1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:35.240
 know, thrashing them to bits.

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:40.480
 So they've got their seeds in a bunch of places, but they chose not to colonize, colonize the

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:41.480
 galaxy.

1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:47.960
 And they also choose not to interfere with this incredibly prevalent, primitive organism

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:51.360
 homo sapiens, right?

1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:57.320
 Or they, uh, this is like a, they enjoy, this is like a TV show for them.

1:06:57.320 --> 1:06:58.320
 Yeah.

1:06:58.320 --> 1:06:59.320
 It could be like a TV show.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:00.320
 Right.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:01.800
 So they just tuned in.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:02.800
 Right.

1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:05.400
 There are no other possible explanations yet.

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:10.640
 I think that to me, the most likely explanation for the peri me paradox is that they really

1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:12.600
 are very, very rare.

1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:16.080
 And you know, Carl Sagan estimated a hundred thousand of them.

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:20.120
 If there's that many, some of them would have been way ahead of us and, and I think we would

1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:22.080
 have seen them by now.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:24.360
 If there are a handful, maybe they're there.

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:29.720
 But at that point, you're right on this dividing line between being a pessimist and an optimist.

1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:30.720
 Yeah.

1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:31.720
 And what are the odds for that?

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:32.720
 Right.

1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:35.080
 What are the things that had to go right for us?

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:36.080
 Yeah.

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:39.600
 And then, you know, getting back to something you said earlier, let's discuss, you know,

1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:40.600
 primitive life.

1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:41.600
 Yeah.

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:44.520
 That could be the thing that's difficult to achieve.

1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:50.200
 Just getting the random molecules together to a point where they start self replicating

1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:53.960
 and evolving and becoming better and all that.

1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:58.120
 That's an inordinately difficult thing, I think, though I'm not, you know, some molecular

1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:01.960
 or cell biologist, but just it's, it's, it's the usual argument.

1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:06.660
 You know, you're wandering around in the Sahara desert and you stumble across a watch.

1:08:06.660 --> 1:08:12.760
 Is your, is your initial response, oh, you know, a bunch of sand grains just came together

1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:14.560
 randomly and formed this watch.

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:21.200
 No, you, you think that something formed it or it came from some simpler structure that

1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.360
 then became, you know, more complex.

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:24.360
 All right.

1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:26.000
 It didn't just form.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:32.040
 Well, even the simplest life is, is a very, very complex structure.

1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:36.640
 Even the, even the simplest prokaryotic cells, not to mention eukaryotic cells, although

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:40.580
 that transition may have been the so called great filter as well.

1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:45.180
 Maybe the cells without a nucleus are relatively easy to form.

1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:50.240
 And then the big next step is where you have a nucleus, which then provides a lot of energy,

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:54.440
 which allows the cell to become much, much more complex and so on.

1:08:54.440 --> 1:09:01.480
 Interestingly, going from eukaryotic cells, single cells to multicellular organisms does

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:05.640
 not appear to be, at least on earth, one of these great filters because there's evidence

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:08.980
 that it happened dozens of times independently on earth.

1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:14.640
 So by, by a really great filter, something that happens very, very rarely, I mean that

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:25.320
 we had to get through an obstacle that is just incredibly rare to get through.

1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:32.120
 And one of the really exciting scientific things is that that particular point is something

1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.020
 that we might be able to discover, even in our lifetimes that find life elsewhere like

1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:42.840
 Europa or be able to see that would be bad news, right?

1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:49.640
 Because if we find lots of pretty advanced life, yeah, that would suggest, and especially

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:53.520
 if we found some, you know, defunct, you know, fossilized civilization or something somewhere

1:09:53.520 --> 1:10:00.660
 else that would be bacteria, you mean, defunct civilization of like, oh, I'm sorry, I switched

1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:01.660
 gears there.

1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:06.840
 If we, if we found some intelligent or even trilobites right and stuff, you know, elsewhere,

1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:09.840
 that would be bad news for us because that would mean that the great filter is ahead

1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:16.400
 of us, you know, right, because it would mean that lots of, lots of things have gotten roughly

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:17.400
 to our level.

1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:18.400
 Yeah.

1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:23.400
 But, but given the Fermi paradox, if you accept that the Fermi paradox means that there's

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:27.800
 no one else out there, you don't necessarily have to accept that, but if you accept that

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:31.980
 it means that no one else is out there and yet there are lots of things we found that

1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:36.940
 are at or roughly at our level, that means that the great filter is ahead of us and that

1:10:36.940 --> 1:10:45.700
 bodes poorly for our longterm future, you know, it's funny you said, uh, you started by saying

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:51.040
 you're a little bit on the pessimistic side, but it's funny because we're doing this kind

1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:56.600
 of dance between pessimism and optimism because I'm not sure if us being alone in the observable

1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:03.080
 universe as intelligent beings is pessimistic, well, it's good news in a sense for us because

1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:10.880
 it means that we made it through, see, if we're the only ones and there are such great

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:16.400
 filters, maybe more than one formation of life might be one of them formation of eukaryotic

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:22.000
 that is with the nucleus cells being another development of human like intelligence might

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.040
 be another, right?

1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:27.720
 There might be several such filters and we were the lucky ones.

1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:31.640
 And you know, then people say, well then that means you're putting yourself into a special

1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:35.520
 perspective and every time we've done that we've been wrong and yeah, yeah, I know all

1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:41.400
 those arguments, but it still could be the case that there's one of us at least per galaxy

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.260
 or pretend or a hundred or a thousand galaxies and we're sitting here having this conversation

1:11:47.260 --> 1:11:49.000
 because we exist.

1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.180
 And so there's a, there's an observational selection effect there, right?

1:11:53.180 --> 1:11:57.000
 Just because we're special doesn't mean that we shouldn't have these conversations about

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.920
 whether or not we're special, right?

1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:02.120
 Yeah, so that's, that's so exciting.

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.360
 That's optimistic.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:08.400
 So that's the, that's the optimistic part that if we don't find other intelligent life

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:13.120
 there, it might mean that we're the ones that made it.

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:19.160
 And in general, outside the great filter and so on, you know, it's not obvious that the

1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:23.760
 Stephen Hawking thing, which is, it's not obvious that life out there is going to be kind to

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:24.760
 us.

1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:25.760
 Oh yeah.

1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:33.040
 So, you know, I knew Hawking and I greatly respect his, his scientific work and in particular

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:38.320
 the early work on the unification of general theory of relativity and quantum physics to

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.760
 two great pillars in modern physics, you know, Hawking radiation and all that fantastic work.

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:47.240
 You know, if you were alive, you should have been a recipient of this year's physics Nobel

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:53.260
 prize, which was for the discovery of black holes and also by Roger Penrose for the theoretical

1:12:53.260 --> 1:13:00.120
 work showing that given a star that's massive enough, you basically can't avoid having a

1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:01.120
 black hole.

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:02.120
 Anyway, Hawking, fantastic.

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:04.420
 I, I tip my hat to him.

1:13:04.420 --> 1:13:05.420
 May he rest in peace.

1:13:05.420 --> 1:13:10.400
 That would have been a heck of a Nobel prize, black holes, heck of a good group.

1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:14.820
 But, but, but going back to what he said that we shouldn't be broadcasting our presence

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:21.160
 to others there, I actually disagree with him respectfully because first of all, we've

1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:25.360
 been unintentionally broadcasting our presence for a hundred years since the development

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:27.200
 of radio and TV.

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:28.200
 Okay.

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:35.600
 Secondly, any alien that has the capability of coming here and squashing us either already

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.880
 knows about us and you know, doesn't care because we're just like little ants.

1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:42.920
 And when there are ants in your kitchen, you tend to squash them.

1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:47.400
 But if there are ants on the sidewalk and you're walking by, do you feel some great

1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:49.720
 conviction that you have to squash any of them?

1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.440
 No, you generally don't, right?

1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:53.040
 We're irrelevant to them.

1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:57.800
 All they need to do is keep an eye on us to see whether we're approaching the kind of

1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:04.800
 technological capability and know about them and have intentions of attacking them.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:06.960
 And then they can squash us, right?

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:10.800
 Um, you know, they, they could have done it long ago.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:11.800
 Yeah.

1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:17.160
 They'll, they'll do it if they want to, whether we advertise our presence or not is, is irrelevant.

1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:21.720
 So I really think that that's not a huge existential threat.

1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:25.020
 So this is a good place to bring up a difficult topic.

1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:31.160
 You mentioned, um, they might, they would be paying attention to us to see if we come

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:34.120
 up with any crazy technology.

1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:37.840
 There's folks who have reported UFO sightings.

1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:42.520
 There's actually, I've recently found out there's a websites that track this, the data,

1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:48.680
 the data of these reportings, and there's millions of them in the past, uh, several

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:49.680
 decades.

1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:58.760
 So seven decades and so on that they've been recorded and the ufologist community, as they

1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:05.040
 refer to themselves, you know, one of the ideas that I find compelling from an alien

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:11.560
 perspective that they kind of started showing up ever since we figured out how to build

1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:19.760
 nuclear weapons that we should, uh, so I mean, you know, if I was an LA and I would start

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.240
 showing up then as well, just, well, why not just observe us from afar?

1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:24.240
 No, I know.

1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:25.240
 Right.

1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:30.160
 I would figure out, but that's why I'm always, uh, keeping a distance and staying blurry,

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:37.320
 but very pixelated, very pixelated, you know, that there is a something in the human condition

1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:43.320
 that a cognition that wants to see, wants to believe beautiful things and, uh, some

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:51.040
 are terrifying, some are exciting, uh, goats, Bigfoot is a big fascination for folks.

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:52.040
 Yeah.

1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:54.000
 And, uh, UFO sightings, I think falls into that.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:02.320
 There's people that look at lights in the night sky and I mean, there's, it's kind of

1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:07.840
 a downer to think in a skeptical sense, to think that that's just a light.

1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:08.840
 Yeah.

1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:11.280
 You want to feel like there's something magical there.

1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:12.280
 Sure.

1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:16.600
 Uh, I mean, I felt that first when my dad, my dad's a physicist, when he first told me

1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:22.080
 about ball lightning when I was like a little kid, very weird, very like weird physical

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.080
 phenomenon.

1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:29.880
 And he said, his intuition was telling me this as a little kid, uh, like, I really like

1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:30.880
 math.

1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:34.680
 His intuition was whoever figures out ball lightning, we'll get a Nobel prize.

1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:40.040
 Like he, I think that was a side comment he gave me and I decided there when I was like

1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:44.840
 five years old or whatever, I'm going to win a Nobel prize for figuring out ball lightning.

1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:49.040
 That was like one of the first sort of sparks of the scientific mindset.

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.560
 Those mysteries, they capture your imagination.

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:56.880
 I think when I speak to people that report UFOs, that's that fire.

1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:57.880
 That's what I see.

1:16:57.880 --> 1:16:58.880
 That excitement.

1:16:58.880 --> 1:16:59.880
 And I understand that.

1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:02.960
 But what, what do we do with that?

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:08.120
 Because there's hundreds of thousands, if not millions, and then the scientific community,

1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:09.120
 you're like the perfect person.

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:13.120
 You have an awesome Einstein shirt.

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.120
 What, what do we do with those reports?

1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:21.840
 It's a, most of the scientific community kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses it.

1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:30.520
 Is it possible that a tiny percent of those folks saw something that's worth deeply investigating?

1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:31.520
 Sure.

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:32.600
 We should investigate it.

1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:37.000
 It's just one of these things where, you know, they've not brought us a hunk of kryptonite

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.340
 or something like that, right?

1:17:38.340 --> 1:17:44.320
 They haven't brought us actual tangible physical evidence with which experiments can be done

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:45.320
 in laboratories.

1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:46.320
 Right.

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.120
 It's, it's anecdotal evidence.

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:54.360
 The photographs are, in some cases, in most cases, I would say quite ambiguous.

1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:55.560
 I don't know what to think about.

1:17:55.560 --> 1:17:58.000
 So David Faber is the first person.

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.960
 He's a Navy pilot, commander, and there's a bunch of them, but he's sort of one of the

1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:08.900
 most legit pilots and people I've ever met.

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:14.160
 The fact that he saw something weird, he doesn't know what the heck it is, but he saw something

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:15.160
 weird.

1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:16.920
 I mean, I don't know what to do with that.

1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:24.040
 And one on the psychological side, so I'm pretty confident he saw what he says he saw,

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:29.240
 which he's not, he's saying it's something weird.

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:36.560
 One of the interesting psychological things that worries me is that everybody in the Navy,

1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:40.960
 everybody in the US government, everybody in the scientific community, just kind of

1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:45.800
 like pretended that nothing happened.

1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:47.200
 That kind of instinct.

1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:53.260
 That's what makes me believe if aliens show up, we would all like just ignore their presence.

1:18:53.260 --> 1:19:00.000
 That's what bothered me that you don't, you don't investigate it more carefully and use

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.520
 this opportunity to inspire the world.

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:12.120
 So in terms of kryptonite, I think the conspiracy theory folks say that whenever there is some

1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:17.480
 good hard evidence that scientists would be excited about, there's this kind of conspiracy

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:21.360
 that I don't like because it's ultimately negative that the US government will somehow

1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:26.080
 hide the good evidence to protect it.

1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:32.200
 Of course, there's some legitimacy to it because you want to protect military secrets, all

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.200
 that kind of stuff.

1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:41.680
 But I don't know what to do with this beautiful mess because I think millions of people are

1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:47.760
 inspired by UFOs and it feels like an opportunity to inspire people about science.

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:53.200
 So I would say, as Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:54.200
 evidence.

1:19:54.200 --> 1:19:59.240
 I've quoted him a number of times.

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:03.000
 We would welcome such evidence.

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:08.960
 On the other hand, a lot of the things that are seen or perhaps even hidden from us, you

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:15.560
 could imagine for military purposes, surveillance purposes, the US government doesn't want us

1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:16.560
 to know.

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:24.120
 Or maybe some of these pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or whatever satellites or some of

1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:31.040
 the crashes that have occurred were later found to be weather balloons or whatever.

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:40.720
 When there are more conventional explanations, science tends to stay away from the sensational

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:41.960
 ones.

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:49.000
 And so it may be that someone else's calling in life is to investigate these phenomena.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.640
 And I welcome that as a scientist.

1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:58.360
 I don't categorically actually deny the possibility that ships of some sort could have visited

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:04.240
 us because, as I said earlier, at slow speeds, there's no problem in reaching other stars.

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:08.920
 In fact, our Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million years are going to be in

1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:10.920
 the vicinity of different stars.

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:15.200
 We can even calculate which ones they're going to be in the vicinity of, right?

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:19.280
 So there's nothing that breaks any laws of physics if you do it slowly.

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:24.480
 But that's different, just having Voyager or Pioneer fly by some star, that's different

1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:31.680
 from having active aliens altering the trajectory of their vehicle in real time, spying on us,

1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:38.200
 and then either zipping back to their home planet or sending signals that tell them about

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:44.760
 us because they are likely many light years away, and they're not going to have broken

1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.800
 that barrier as well, okay?

1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:54.080
 So I just, you know, go ahead, study them.

1:21:54.080 --> 1:22:00.400
 For some young kid who wants to do it, it might be their calling, and that's how they

1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:05.960
 might find meaning in their lives, is to be the scientist who really explores these things.

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:11.520
 I chose not to because at a very young age, I found the evidence, to the degree that I

1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:18.320
 investigated it, to be really quite unconvincing, and I had other things that I wanted to do.

1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:23.040
 But I don't categorically deny the possibility, and I think it should be investigated.

1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:31.840
 Yeah, I mean, this is one of those phenomena that 99.9% of people are almost definitely,

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:38.300
 there's conventional explanations, and then there's like mysterious things that probably

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:45.400
 have explanations that are a little bit more complicated, but there's not enough to work

1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:46.400
 with.

1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:52.440
 I tend to believe that if aliens showed up, there will be plenty of evidence for scientists

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:53.440
 to study.

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:54.440
 Yeah.

1:22:54.440 --> 1:23:03.760
 And exactly as you said, avoid your type of spacecraft that could see sort of some kind

1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:09.240
 of, kind of a dumb thing, almost like a sensor that's like probing, like statistically speaking.

1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:10.240
 Flying by.

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.920
 Flying by, maybe lands, maybe there's some kind of robot type of thingies that just like

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:17.920
 move around and so on, like in ways that we don't understand.

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:27.320
 But I feel like, well, I feel like there'll be plenty of hard, hard to dismiss evidence.

1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:33.900
 And I also, especially this year, believe that the US government is not sufficiently

1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:39.460
 competent given the huge amount of evidence that will be revealed from this kind of thing

1:23:39.460 --> 1:23:41.400
 to conceal all of it.

1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:42.400
 Right.

1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:46.720
 At least in modern times, you can say maybe decades ago, but in modern times.

1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:51.200
 Right, you know, the people I speak to and the reason I bring it up is because so many

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:53.600
 people write to me, they're inspired by it.

1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:57.160
 By the way, I wanted to comment on something you said earlier on, yeah, I had said that

1:23:57.160 --> 1:24:03.640
 I'm sort of a pessimist in that I think there are very few other intelligent, mechanically

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:06.160
 able creatures out there.

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:10.360
 But then I said, yes, in a sense, I'm an optimist, as you pointed out, because it means

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:13.240
 that we made it through the great filter.

1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:14.240
 Right.

1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.440
 I meant originally that I'm a pessimist in that I'm pessimistic about the possibility

1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:23.920
 that there are many, many of us out there, you know, mathematically speaking in the Drake

1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:24.920
 equation.

1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:25.920
 Exactly.

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:26.920
 Right.

1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:27.920
 Right.

1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:28.920
 But it may mean a good thing for our ultimate survival.

1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:29.920
 Right.

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:30.920
 So I'm glad you caught me on that.

1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.440
 Yeah, I definitely agree with you.

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:34.000
 It is ultimately an optimistic statement.

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.140
 But anyway, I think, you know, UFO research is interesting.

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:43.280
 And I guess one of the reasons I've not been terribly convinced is that I think there are

1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:49.080
 some scientists who are investigating this and they've not found any clear evidence.

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:53.880
 Now, I must admit, I have not looked through the literature to convince myself that there

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:58.000
 are many scientists doing systematic studies of these various reports.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:03.620
 I can't say for sure that there's a critical mass of them, but it's just that you never

1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:06.580
 get these reports from hardcore scientists.

1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:07.580
 That's another thing.

1:25:07.580 --> 1:25:08.680
 And astronomers, you know, what do we do?

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:12.760
 We spend our time studying the heavens and you'd think we'd be the ones that are most

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:17.480
 likely aside from pilots, perhaps, at seeing weird things in the sky.

1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:22.240
 And we just never do of the unexplained UFO type nature.

1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:28.720
 Yeah, I definitely, I try to keep an open mind, but for people who listen, it's actually

1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:30.680
 really difficult for scientists.

1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:38.160
 Like I get probably like this year, I've probably gotten over probably maybe over a thousand

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:42.740
 emails on the topic of AGI.

1:25:42.740 --> 1:25:48.760
 It's very difficult to, you know, people write to me, it's like, how can you ignore this

1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:49.880
 in AGI side?

1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:53.880
 Like this model, this is obviously the model that's going to achieve general intelligence.

1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:54.880
 How can you ignore it?

1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:55.880
 I'm giving you the answer.

1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:56.880
 Here's my document.

1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:00.600
 And they're always just these large write ups.

1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:07.920
 The problem is it's very difficult to weed through a bunch of BS.

1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:15.040
 It's very possible that you had actually saw the UFO, but you have to acknowledge that

1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:20.460
 by UFO, I mean, an extraterrestrial life, you have to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands

1:26:20.460 --> 1:26:26.600
 of people who are a little bit, if not a lot full of BS.

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:33.560
 And from a scientist perspective, it's really hard work and it's when there's amazing stuff

1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:40.240
 out there, it's like, why invest in Bigfoot when evolution in all of its richness is beautiful?

1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:43.360
 Who cares about a monkey that walks on two feet or eight or whatever?

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:47.940
 Like there's a zillion decoys at observatories.

1:26:47.940 --> 1:26:48.940
 True fact.

1:26:48.940 --> 1:26:55.280
 We get lots and lots of phone calls when Venus, the evening star, but just really a bright

1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:00.360
 planet happens to be close to the crescent moon because it's such a striking pair.

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.360
 This happens once in a while.

1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:04.720
 And we get these phone calls, oh, there's a UFO next to the moon.

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.280
 And no, it's Venus.

1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:12.520
 And so they're just and I'm not saying the best UFO reports are of that nature.

1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:14.400
 No, there are some much more convincing cases.

1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:17.240
 And I've seen some of the footage and blah, blah, blah.

1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:19.520
 But it's just there's so many decoys, right?

1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:22.660
 So much so much noise that you have to filter out.

1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:23.920
 And there's only so many scientists.

1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:24.920
 So it's hard.

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:25.920
 There's only so much.

1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:27.240
 There's only so much time as well.

1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:30.000
 And you have to choose what problems you work on.

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.720
 You know, this might be a fun question to ask to kind of explore the idea of the expanding

1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:38.720
 universe.

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:39.720
 Yeah.

1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:46.800
 So the the radius of the observable universe is 45.7 billion light years.

1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:47.800
 Yeah.

1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:56.240
 And the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.

1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:00.880
 That's less than the radius of the universe.

1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:01.880
 How's that possible?

1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.560
 So that's a great question.

1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:08.720
 So I meant to bring a little a little prop I have with ping pong balls on a rubber hose,

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:09.720
 a rubber band.

1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:14.080
 I use it in many of the lectures that one can find of me online.

1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:20.120
 But you have in an expanding universe, the space itself between galaxies or more correctly,

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:23.040
 clusters of galaxies expanding.

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:27.080
 So imagine light going from one cluster to another.

1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:33.640
 It traverses some distance and then while it's traversing the rest, that part that it

1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:38.440
 already traveled through continues to expand.

1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:47.160
 Now 13.7 billion years might have gone by since the light that we are seeing from the

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:52.280
 early stages, the so called cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the afterglow

1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:54.760
 of the Big Bang or the echo of the Big Bang.

1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:57.400
 Yeah, 13.7 billion years have gone by.

1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:00.840
 That's how long it's taken that light to reach us.

1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:06.080
 But while it's been traveling that distance, the parts that it already traveled continue

1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:08.000
 to expand.

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:13.280
 So it's like you're walking on at an airport, you know, on one of these walkways and you're

1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:16.200
 walking along because you're trying to get to your terminal.

1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.240
 But the walkway is continuing as well.

1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:24.160
 You end up traveling a greater distance or the same distance faster is another way of

1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:25.280
 putting it, right?

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:28.360
 That's why you get on one of these traveling walkways.

1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:33.560
 So you get roughly a factor of pi, you know, but it's more like 3.2, I think.

1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:38.640
 But when you work it all out, you multiply the number of years the universe has been

1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:42.520
 in existence by, you know, three and a quarter or so.

1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:48.920
 And that's how you get this 46 billion light year radius.

1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:56.000
 But how is that, let me ask some nice dumb questions, how is that not traveling faster

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.000
 than the speed of light?

1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:01.160
 Yeah, it's not traveling faster than the speed of light because locally at any point, if

1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:06.640
 you were to measure the light, the photons zipping past, it would not be exceeding the

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.000
 speed of light.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.320
 The speed of light is a locally measured quantity.

1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:16.280
 After light has traversed some distance, if the rubber band keeps on stretching, then

1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:23.680
 yes, it looks like the light traveled a greater distance than it would have had the space

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:25.240
 not been expanding.

1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:28.180
 But locally, it never was exceeding the speed of light.

1:30:28.180 --> 1:30:32.600
 It's just that the distance through which it already traveled then went off and expanded

1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:35.360
 on its own some more.

1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:40.960
 And if you give the light credit, so to speak, for having traversed that distance, well,

1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:43.680
 then it looks like it's going faster than the speed of light.

1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:47.480
 But that's not how speed works.

1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:54.720
 And in relativity, also, the other thing that is interesting is that if you take two ping

1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:59.280
 pong balls that are sufficiently far apart, especially in an accelerating universe, you

1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:03.400
 can easily have them moving apart from one another faster than the speed of light.

1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:09.680
 So take two ping pong balls that were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other and let

1:31:09.680 --> 1:31:14.280
 every centimeter in your rubber band expand to two in one second.

1:31:14.280 --> 1:31:20.720
 Then suddenly, this 400,000 kilometer distance is 800,000 kilometers.

1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:24.480
 It went out by 400,000 kilometers in one second.

1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:29.620
 That exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second speed of light.

1:31:29.620 --> 1:31:36.240
 But that light limit, that particle limit in special relativity, applies to objects

1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:39.640
 moving through a preexisting space.

1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:46.160
 There's nothing in either special or general relativity that prevents space itself from

1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:48.680
 expanding faster than the speed of light.

1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:49.680
 That's no problem.

1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:55.760
 Einstein wouldn't have had a problem with a universe as observed now by cosmologists.

1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:04.240
 Yeah, I'm not sure I'm yet ready to deal emotionally with expanding space.

1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:09.560
 That to me is one of the most awe inspiring things, starting from the Big Bang.

1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:11.480
 It's definitely abstract.

1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:13.320
 Space itself is expanding.

1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:14.320
 Right.

1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:18.600
 Could you, can we talk about the Big Bang a little bit?

1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:19.600
 Sure.

1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:20.600
 Yeah, yeah.

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:27.360
 What, so like the entirety of it, the universe, was very small.

1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:28.360
 Right.

1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:29.360
 But it was not a point.

1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:31.160
 It was not a point.

1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:36.080
 Because if we live in what's called a closed universe now, a sphere or the three dimensional

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:43.120
 version of that would be a hypersphere, then regardless of how far back in time you go,

1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:45.880
 it was always that topological shape.

1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:49.320
 You can't turn a point suddenly into a shell, okay?

1:32:49.320 --> 1:32:52.020
 It always had to be a shell.

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:57.040
 So when people say, well, the universe started out as a point, that's being kind of flippant,

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:58.160
 kind of glib.

1:32:58.160 --> 1:32:59.160
 It didn't really.

1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:02.480
 It just started out at a very high density.

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:06.880
 And we don't know actually whether it was finite or infinite, I think personally that

1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:10.400
 it was finite at the time, but it expanded very, very quickly.

1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:16.300
 Indeed, if it exponentiated and continued in some places to exponentiate, then it could

1:33:16.300 --> 1:33:18.140
 in fact be infinite right now.

1:33:18.140 --> 1:33:20.480
 And most cosmologists think that it is infinite.

1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:21.480
 Wait, wait, wait.

1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:22.480
 Yeah, sorry.

1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:25.040
 What infinite, which dimension, mass, size?

1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:26.440
 Infinite in space.

1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:27.440
 Infinite in space.

1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:29.560
 And by that I mean that if you were trying to measure.

1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:30.560
 There's no boundary.

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:33.280
 There's no light to measure its size.

1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:37.400
 You'd never be able to measure its size because it would always be bigger than the distance

1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:39.260
 light can travel.

1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:42.760
 That's what you get in a universe that's accelerating in its expansion.

1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:43.760
 Okay.

1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:50.280
 But if a thing was a hypersphere, it's very small, not a point, how can that thing be

1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:51.280
 infinite?

1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:54.040
 Well, it expands exponentially.

1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:56.200
 That's what the inflation theory is all about.

1:33:56.200 --> 1:34:01.400
 Indeed, at your home institution, Alan Guth is one of the originators of the whole inflationary

1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:07.280
 universe idea, along with Andre Linde at Stanford University here in the Bay Area.

1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:11.240
 And others, Alexei Starobinsky and others had similar sorts of ideas.

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:17.400
 But in an exponentially expanding universe, if you actually try to make this measurement,

1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:22.720
 you send light out to try to see it curve back around and hit you in the back of the

1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:23.720
 head.

1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:29.360
 But in an exponentially expanding universe, the amount of space remaining to be traversed

1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.400
 is always a bigger and bigger quantity.

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:34.520
 So you'll never get there from here.

1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:35.920
 You'll never reach the back of your head.

1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:41.160
 So observationally or operationally, it can be thought of as being infinite.

1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.680
 That's one of the best definitions of infinity, by the way.

1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:44.680
 What's that?

1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:49.520
 That's one of the best sort of physical manifestations of infinity.

1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:50.640
 Yeah, yeah.

1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:53.200
 Because you have to ask, how would you actually measure it?

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:58.920
 Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology theoretical friends, well, if I were God and I were outside

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:05.140
 this whole thing and I took a godlike slice in time, wouldn't it be finite no matter how

1:35:05.140 --> 1:35:06.140
 big it is?

1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:13.000
 And they object and they say, Alex, you can't be outside and take a godlike slice of time,

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000
 you know?

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.000
 Because there's nothing outside.

1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000
 Well, I'm not, you know, or also, you know, what slice of time you're taking depends on

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.000
 your motion.

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.680
 And that's true even in special relativity that slices of time get tilted, in a sense,

1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:36.100
 if you're moving quickly, the axes, x and t actually become tilted, not perpendicular

1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:37.920
 to one another.

1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:43.320
 And you can look at Brian Greene's books and lectures and other things where he imagines

1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:50.120
 taking a loaf of bread and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward.

1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:55.160
 But then if you're zipping along relative to that loaf of bread, the slices of time

1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:57.400
 actually become tilted.

1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:00.700
 And so it's not even clear what slices of time mean.

1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:05.040
 But I'm an observational astronomer, I know which end of the telescope to look through.

1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:09.480
 And the way I understand the infinity is, as I just told you, that operationally or

1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:16.340
 observationally, there'd be no way of seeing that it's a finite universe, of measuring

1:36:16.340 --> 1:36:17.340
 a finite universe.

1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:25.600
 And so in that sense, it's infinite, even if it started out as a finite little dot.

1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:29.720
 Not a dot, I'm sorry, a finite little hypersphere.

1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:37.800
 But it didn't really start out there because what happened before that?

1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:38.800
 Well, we don't know.

1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:41.480
 So this is where it gets into a lot of speculation.

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:42.480
 Let's go, I mean...

1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:43.480
 Let's go there.

1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:44.480
 Okay, sure.

1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:45.480
 So, you know...

1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:50.440
 The idea of what happened before t equals zero and whether there are other universes

1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:55.160
 out there, I like to say that these are sort of on the boundaries of science.

1:36:55.160 --> 1:36:58.820
 They're not just ideas that we wake up at three in the morning to go to the bathroom

1:36:58.820 --> 1:37:02.160
 and say, oh, well, let's think about what happened before the Big Bang or let there

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:04.880
 be a multiplicity of universes.

1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:12.280
 In other words, we have real testable physics that we can use to draw certain conclusions

1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.400
 that are plausibility arguments based on what we know.

1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:24.160
 Now, admittedly, there are not really direct tests of these hypotheses.

1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:26.040
 That's why I call them hypotheses.

1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:30.980
 They're not really elevated to a theory because a theory in science is really something that

1:37:30.980 --> 1:37:34.960
 has a lot of experimental or observational support behind it.

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:41.400
 So they're hypotheses, but they're not unreasonable hypotheses based on what we know about general

1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:44.240
 relativity and quantum physics.

1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:49.720
 And they may have indirect tests in that if you adopt this hypothesis, then there might

1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.560
 be a bunch of things you expect of the universe, and lo and behold, that's what we measure.

1:37:54.560 --> 1:38:00.620
 But we're not actually measuring anything at t less than zero, or we're not actually

1:38:00.620 --> 1:38:05.780
 measuring the presence of another universe in this multiverse, and yet there are these

1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:09.180
 indirect ideas that stem forth.

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:15.560
 So it's hard to prove uniqueness, and it's hard to completely convince oneself that a

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:19.540
 certain hypothesis must be true.

1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:24.420
 But the more and more tests you have that it satisfies, let's say there are 50 predictions

1:38:24.420 --> 1:38:30.360
 it makes, and 49 of them are things that you can measure.

1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:35.640
 And then the 50th one is the one where you want to measure the actual existence of that

1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.840
 other universe, or what happened before t equals zero, and you can't do that.

1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:49.000
 But you've satisfied 49 of the other testable predictions, and so that's science, right?

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.680
 Now a conventional condensed matter physicist or someone who deals with real data in the

1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:58.040
 laboratory might say, oh, you cosmologists, that's not really science because it's not

1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:02.480
 directly testable, but I would say it's sort of testable.

1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:06.040
 But it's not completely testable, and so it's at the boundary, but it's not like we're coming

1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:11.980
 up with these crazy ideas, among them quantum fluctuations out of nothing, and then inflating

1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:16.720
 into a universe with, you might say, well, you created a giant amount of energy.

1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:22.800
 But in fact, this quantum fluctuation out of nothing in a quantum way violates the conservation

1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:23.800
 of energy.

1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:24.800
 But who cares?

1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:26.600
 That was a classical law anyway.

1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:32.760
 And then an inflating universe maintains whatever energy it had, be it zero or some infinitesimal

1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:33.760
 amount.

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:38.800
 In a sense, the stuff of the universe has a positive energy, but there's a negative

1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:41.280
 gravitational energy associated with it.

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:43.000
 It's like I drop an apple.

1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.880
 I got kinetic energy, energy of motion out of that, but I did work on it to bring it

1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:49.800
 to that height.

1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:55.880
 So by going down and gaining energy of motion, positive one, two, three, four, five units

1:39:55.880 --> 1:40:01.160
 of kinetic energy, it's also gaining or losing, depending on how you want to think of it,

1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:06.200
 negative one, two, three, four, five units of potential energy, so the total energy remains

1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:07.240
 the same.

1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:12.260
 An inflating universe can do that, or other physicists say that energy isn't conserved

1:40:12.260 --> 1:40:13.840
 in general relativity.

1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:17.520
 That's another way out of creating a universe out of nothing.

1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:22.920
 But the point is that this is all based on reasonably well tested physics, and although

1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:30.080
 these extrapolations seem kind of outrageous at first, they're not completely outrageous.

1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:33.600
 They're within the realm of what we call science already.

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:39.080
 And maybe some young whippersnapper will be able to figure out a way to directly test

1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.060
 what happened before T equals zero or to test for the presence of these other universes,

1:40:44.060 --> 1:40:46.460
 but right now we don't have a way of doing that.

1:40:46.460 --> 1:40:52.040
 So speaking of young whippersnappers, Roger Penrose.

1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:58.240
 So he kind of has a, you know, idea that we, there may be some information that travels

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:00.760
 from whatever the heck happened before the Big Bang.

1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:01.760
 Yeah, maybe.

1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.320
 I kind of doubt it.

1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:09.480
 So do you think it's possible to detect something, like actually experimentally be able to detect

1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:13.640
 some, I don't know what it is, radiation, some sort of...

1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:18.240
 Yeah, and the cosmic microwave background radiation, there may be ways of doing that.

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:25.480
 But is it, is it philosophically or practically possible to detect signs that this was before

1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:32.000
 the Big Bang or is it, or is it what you said, which is like everything we observe will,

1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.200
 as we currently understand, will have to be a creation of this particular observable universe?

1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:37.200
 Yeah.

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:40.480
 I mean, you know, if you, it's very difficult to answer right now because we don't have

1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:48.360
 a single verified, fully self consistent, experimentally tested quantum theory of gravity.

1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:49.360
 Right.

1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:53.600
 And of course the beginning of the universe is a large amount of stuff in a very small

1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:54.600
 space.

1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:55.600
 Yeah.

1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:57.120
 So you need both quantum mechanics and general relativity.

1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:01.400
 Same thing if our universe re collapses and then bounces back to another Big Bang.

1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:06.320
 You know, there's also ideas there that some of the information leaks through or survives.

1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:11.560
 I don't know that we can answer that question right now because we don't have a quantum

1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:15.360
 theory of gravity that most physicists believe in.

1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:20.600
 And belief is perhaps the wrong word that most physicists trust because the experimental

1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:22.480
 evidence favors it.

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:23.480
 Yeah.

1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:24.480
 Right?

1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:25.480
 Yeah.

1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:26.480
 There are various forms of string theory.

1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:27.480
 There's quantum loop gravity.

1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:33.240
 There are various ideas, but which, if any, will be the one that survives the test of

1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:38.840
 time and more importantly, within that, the test of experiment and observation.

1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:39.840
 Yeah.

1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:43.280
 So my own feeling is probably these things don't survive.

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.400
 I don't think we've seen any evidence in the cosmic microwave background radiation

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.520
 of information leaking through.

1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:55.880
 Similarly, the one way or one of the few ways in which we might test for the presence of

1:42:55.880 --> 1:43:02.200
 other universes is if they were to collide with ours, that would leave a pattern, a temperature

1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:05.920
 signature in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:10.200
 Some astrophysicists claim to have found it, but in my opinion, it's not statistically

1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:17.280
 significant to the level that would be necessary to have such an amazing claim, right?

1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:22.960
 It's just a 5% chance that the microwave background had that distribution just by chance.

1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:32.680
 5% isn't very long odds if you're claiming that instead that you're finding evidence

1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:33.680
 from another universe.

1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:39.760
 I mean, it's like if the Large Hadron Collider people had claimed after gathering enough

1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:47.780
 data to show the Higgs particle when there was a 5% chance it could be just a statistical

1:43:47.780 --> 1:43:50.040
 fluctuation in their data.

1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:57.640
 No, they required 5 sigma, 5 standard deviations, which is roughly one chance in 2 million that

1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:04.280
 this is a statistical fluctuation of no physical greater significance.

1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:05.560
 Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:06.560
 There you go.

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:07.560
 It all boils down to that.

1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:12.420
 And the greater your claim, the greater is the evidence that is needed and the more evidence

1:44:12.420 --> 1:44:20.640
 you need from independent ways of measuring or of coming to that deduction.

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:23.560
 A good example was the accelerating universe.

1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:29.840
 When we found evidence for it in 1998 with supernovae with exploding stars, it was great

1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:34.240
 that there were two teams that lent some credibility to the discovery.

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:41.200
 But it was not until other astrophysicists used not only that technique, but more importantly,

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:46.760
 other independent techniques that had their own potential sources of systematic error

1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:47.940
 or whatever.

1:44:47.940 --> 1:44:52.760
 But they all came to the same conclusion and that started giving a much more complete picture

1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:59.220
 of what was going on and a picture in which most astrophysicists quickly gained confidence.

1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:06.200
 That's why that idea caught on so quickly is that there were other physicists and astronomers

1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:11.640
 doing observations completely independent of supernovae that seemed to indicate the

1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:12.640
 same thing.

1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:13.640
 Yeah.

1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:22.480
 That period of your life that work with an incredible team of people that won the Nobel

1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:25.880
 Prize is just fascinating work.

1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:26.880
 Oh gosh.

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:33.280
 Never in my wildest dreams as a kid did I think that I would be involved, much less

1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:37.880
 so heavily involved, in a discovery that's so revolutionary.

1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:41.760
 As a kid, as a scientist, if you're realistic, once you learn a little bit more about how

1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:45.840
 science is done and you're not going to win a Nobel Prize and be the next Newton or Einstein

1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.020
 or whatever, you just hope that you'll contribute something to humankind's understanding of

1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:55.040
 how nature works and you'll be satisfied with that.

1:45:55.040 --> 1:46:01.040
 But here I was in the right place at the right time, a lot of luck, a lot of hard work, and

1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:02.180
 there it was.

1:46:02.180 --> 1:46:08.400
 We discovered something that was really amazing and that was the greatest thrill, right?

1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:14.060
 I couldn't have asked for anything more than being involved in that discovery.

1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:20.200
 So the couple of teams, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the HiZ Supernova Search Team,

1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:21.960
 what was the Nobel Prize given for?

1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:27.280
 It was given for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, not for the elucidation

1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:33.040
 of what dark energy is or what causes that expansion, that acceleration, be it universes

1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:36.840
 on the outside or whatever, it was only for the observational fact.

1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:39.200
 So first of all, what is the accelerating universe?

1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:45.640
 So the accelerating universe is simply that if we look at the galaxies moving away from

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:52.120
 us right now, we would expect them to be moving away more slowly than they were billions of

1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:53.120
 years ago.

1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.080
 That's because galaxies have visible matter, which is gravitationally attractive, and dark

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:04.600
 matter of an unknown sort that holds galaxies together and holds clusters of galaxies together.

1:47:04.600 --> 1:47:09.400
 And of course, they then pull on one another and they would tend to retard the expansion

1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:10.400
 of the universe.

1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:17.280
 Just as when I toss an apple up, even ignoring air resistance, the mutual gravitational attraction

1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:20.640
 between Earth and the apple slows the apple down.

1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:24.800
 If that attraction is great enough, then the apple will someday stop and even come back.

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:29.080
 The Big Crunch, you could call it, or the Gnab Gibb, which is Big Bang backwards, right?

1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:30.520
 That's what could have happened to the universe.

1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:36.860
 But even if the universe's original expansion energy was so great that it avoids the Big

1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:39.800
 Crunch, that's like an apple thrown at Earth's escape speed.

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:47.040
 It's like the rockets that go to Mars someday, right, with people.

1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:50.800
 Even then, you'd expect the universe to be slowing down with time.

1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:55.600
 But we looked back through the history of the universe by looking at progressively more

1:47:55.600 --> 1:48:06.000
 distant galaxies and by seeing that the evolution of this expansion rate is that in the first

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.340
 nine billion years, yeah, it was slowing down.

1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:13.720
 But in the last five billion years, it's been speeding up.

1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:17.320
 So who asked for that, right, you know?

1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:22.080
 I think it's interesting to talk about a little bit of the human story of the Nobel Prize,

1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:24.920
 which is, I mean, it's fascinating.

1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:27.960
 It's a really, first of all, the prize itself.

1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:34.040
 It's kind of fascinating on the psychological level that prizes, I know we kind of think

1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:38.720
 that prizes don't matter, but somehow they kind of focus the mind about some of the most

1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:39.720
 special things we've accomplished.

1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:40.720
 They do.

1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:43.200
 It's the recognition, the funding, you know.

1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:47.580
 And also inspiration for, like I said, when I was a little kid, thinking about the Nobel

1:48:47.580 --> 1:48:53.600
 Prize, like I didn't, you know, it inspires millions of young scientists.

1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:59.200
 At the same time, there's a sadness to it a little bit that, especially in the field,

1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:04.400
 like depending on the field, but experimental fields that involve teams of, I don't know,

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:12.200
 sometimes hundreds of brilliant people, the Nobel Prize is only given to just a handful.

1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:13.200
 That's right.

1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.760
 Is it maxed at three?

1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:15.760
 Yeah.

1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:16.760
 Yeah.

1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:18.920
 And it's not even written in Alfred Nobel's will, it turns out.

1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:23.960
 One of our teammates looked into it in a museum in Stockholm when we went there for Nobel

1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:25.840
 Week in 2011.

1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:30.560
 The leaders who got the prize formally knew that without the rest of us working hard in

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:35.080
 the trenches, the result would not have been discovered.

1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:37.560
 So they invited us to participate in Nobel Week.

1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.320
 And so one of the team members looked in the will and it's not there.

1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:42.320
 It's just tradition.

1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:43.320
 That's interesting.

1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:47.080
 But it's archaic, you know, that's the way science used to be done.

1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:49.320
 It's not the way a lot of science is done now.

1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.700
 And you look at gravitational wave discovery, which was, you know, recognized with the Nobel

1:49:54.700 --> 1:50:03.720
 Prize in 2017, Ray Weiss at MIT got it and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish at Caltech.

1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:07.560
 And Ron Drever, one of the masterminds, had passed away earlier in the year.

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:13.840
 So again, one of the rules of Nobel is that it's not given posthumously, or at least the

1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:17.960
 one exception might be if they've made their decision and they're busy making their press

1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:23.460
 releases right before October, the first week in October or whatever, and then the person

1:50:23.460 --> 1:50:24.460
 passes away.

1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:25.920
 I think they don't change their minds then.

1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:32.460
 But yeah, you know, it doesn't square with today's reality that a lot of science is done

1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:35.800
 by big teams, in that case, a team of a thousand people.

1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:40.160
 In our case, it was two teams consisting of about 50 people.

1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:46.120
 And we used techniques that were arguably developed in part by people who, astrophysicists

1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:51.320
 who weren't even on those two papers, I mean, some of them were, but other papers were written

1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:56.560
 by other people, you know, and so it's like we're standing on the shoulders of giants.

1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:59.520
 And none of those people was officially recognized.

1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:01.800
 And to me, it was okay.

1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:06.560
 You know, again, it was the thrill of doing the work and ultimately the work, the discovery

1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.760
 was recognized with the prize.

1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:14.360
 And you know, we got to participate in Nobel week and, you know, it's okay with me.

1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:20.500
 I've known other physicists whose lives were ruined because they did not get the Nobel

1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:23.840
 prize and they felt strongly that they should have.

1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:31.560
 Ralph Alpher of the Alpher beta gamma paper predicting the microwave background radiation,

1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:33.400
 we should have gotten it.

1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:36.600
 His advisor Gamoff was dead by that point.

1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:42.560
 But you know, Penzias and Wilson got it for the discovery and an Alpher, apparently from

1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:45.120
 colleagues who knew him well, I've talked to them.

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.760
 His life was ruined by this.

1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:50.840
 He just, it just not at his innards so much.

1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:56.040
 It's very possible that in a small handful of people, even three, that you would be one

1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:59.440
 of the Nobel, one of the winners of the Nobel prize.

1:51:59.440 --> 1:52:00.920
 That doesn't weigh heavy on you.

1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:05.080
 Well, you know, there were the two team leaders, Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt.

1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:07.600
 And usually there's the team leaders that are recognized.

1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:10.520
 And then Adam Rees was my postdoc.

1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:11.520
 First author, I guess.

1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:12.520
 Yeah.

1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:13.520
 First author.

1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:14.520
 I was second author of that paper.

1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:15.520
 Yeah.

1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:16.520
 So I was his direct mentor at the time.

1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:19.920
 Although he was, you know, one of these people who just, you know, runs with things.

1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:26.200
 He was an MIT undergraduate by the way, Harvard graduate student, and then a postdoc as a

1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:30.840
 so called Miller fellow for basic research and science at Berkeley, something that I

1:52:30.840 --> 1:52:33.240
 was back in 84 to 86.

1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:37.680
 But you're, you know, you're largely a free agent, but he worked quite closely with me

1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:43.000
 and he came to Berkeley to work with me and on Schmidt's team, he was charged with analyzing

1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:48.440
 the data and he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae showing that they're

1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:51.480
 fainter and thus more distant than anticipated.

1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:56.420
 And that led to this conclusion that the universe had to have accelerated in order to push them

1:52:56.420 --> 1:52:58.520
 out to such great distances.

1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:04.800
 And I was shocked when he showed me the data, the results of his calculations and measurements.

1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:07.000
 But it's very, you know, so he deserved it.

1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:10.440
 And on Sol's team, Gerson Goldhaber deserved it.

1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:14.840
 But he died, I think a year earlier in 2010, but that would have been four.

1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:21.720
 And so, and me, well, I was on both teams, but, you know, was I number four, five, six,

1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:22.720
 seven?

1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:23.720
 I don't know.

1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:28.800
 It's also very, so if I were to, it's possible that you're, I mean, I can make a very good

1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:31.400
 case for urine in the three.

1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:38.440
 And does that, is that psychologically, I mean, listen, it weighs on me a little bit

1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:44.560
 because I don't know what to do with that.

1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:51.120
 Perhaps it should motivate the rethinking, like Time magazine started doing like, you

1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:56.120
 know, person of the year and like they would start doing like concepts and almost like

1:53:56.120 --> 1:54:02.380
 the black hole gets the Nobel prize or the universe gets the Nobel prize and here's the

1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:03.800
 list of people.

1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:11.160
 So like, or like the Oscar that you could say, because it's a team effort now and it

1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:12.160
 should be redone.

1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:16.360
 And the breakthrough prize in fundamental physics, which was started by Yuri Milner

1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:22.080
 and Zuckerberg is involved in others as well, you know, uh, they recognize the larger team.

1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:24.440
 Yeah, they, they recognize teams.

1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:28.840
 And so in fact, both teams in the accelerating universe were recognized with the breakthrough

1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.480
 prize in 2015.

1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:37.720
 Nevertheless, the same three people, Reese Perlmutter and Schmidt got the red carpet

1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:43.480
 rolled out for them and were at the big ceremony and shared half of the prize money.

1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:48.240
 And the rest of us, roughly 50 shared the other half and didn't get to go to the ceremony.

1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:52.880
 So, but I, I feel for them, I mean, for the gravitational waves, it was a thousand people.

1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:53.880
 What are they going to do?

1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:55.980
 Invite everyone for the Higgs particle.

1:54:55.980 --> 1:54:58.760
 It was six to 8,000 physicists and engineers.

1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:04.500
 In fact, because of the whole issue of who gets it experimentally, that discovery still

1:55:04.500 --> 1:55:06.620
 has not been recognized, right?

1:55:06.620 --> 1:55:13.240
 The theoretical work by Peter Higgs and, uh, Anglaire got recognized, but there was a troika

1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:18.240
 of other people who perhaps wrote the most complete paper and they were, they were left

1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:22.360
 out and, um, another guy died, you know, and

1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:23.360
 it's hard.

1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:24.360
 It's all of his heartbreak.

1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:28.400
 And some people argue that the Nobel prize has been diluted too, because if you look

1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:33.600
 at Roger Penrose, you can make an argument that he should get the prize by himself.

1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:37.720
 Like it's just separate those, like he could have and should have, perhaps he should have

1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:41.720
 perhaps gotten it with Hawking before Hawking's death, right?

1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:46.320
 The problem was Hawking radiation had not been detected, but you could argue that Hawking

1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:52.240
 made enough other fundamental contributions to the theoretical study of black holes and

1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:57.920
 the observed data were already good enough at the time of before Hawking's death.

1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:58.920
 Okay.

1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:03.280
 I mean, the latest results by Reinhard Genzel's group is that they see the time dilation effect

1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:07.680
 of a star that's passing very close to the black hole in the middle of our galaxy.

1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:13.240
 That's cool, but, and it adds additional evidence, but hardly anyone doubted the existence of

1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:18.880
 the supermassive black hole and Andrea Gaz's group, I believe hadn't yet shown that relativistic

1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:21.060
 effect and yet she got part of the prize as well.

1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:25.560
 So clearly it was given for the, the original evidence that was really good.

1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:30.320
 And that evidence is at least a decade old, you know, so one could make the case for,

1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:37.460
 for Hawking, one could make the case that in 2016, when Mayor and Caloz won the Nobel

1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:45.560
 Prize for the discovery of the first exoplanet, 51B Pegasi, well, there was a fellow at Penn

1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:55.000
 State, Alex Wolszczan, who in 1992, three years preceding 1995, found a planet orbiting

1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:59.920
 a pulsar, a very weird kind of star, a neutron star, and that wouldn't have been a normal

1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:00.920
 planet.

1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:01.920
 Sure.

1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.840
 And so the Nobel committee, you know, they gave it for the discovery of planets around

1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:11.160
 normal sun like stars, but, but hell, you know, Wolszczan found a planet so they could

1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:16.520
 have given it to him as the third person instead of to Jim Peebles for the development of what's

1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.360
 called physical cosmology.

1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:22.860
 He's at Princeton, he deserved it, but they could have given Nobel for the development

1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:27.920
 of physical cosmology to Peebles and I would claim some other people were pretty important

1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:29.000
 in that development as well.

1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.600
 You know, and they could have given it some other year.

1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:35.040
 So there's, there's a lot of controversy.

1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:36.600
 I try not to dwell on it.

1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.760
 Was I number three?

1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:38.760
 Probably not.

1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.680
 You know, Adam Riess did the work.

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:46.040
 You know, I helped bounce ideas off of him, but we wouldn't have had the result without

1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:47.040
 him.

1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:48.040
 Yeah.

1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:53.360
 And I was on both teams for reasons, I mean, you know, I, the style of the first team,

1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:56.320
 the supernova cosmology project didn't match mine.

1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:00.520
 They came largely from experimental high energy particle physics, physics where there's these

1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:05.440
 hierarchical teams and stuff and it's hard for the little guy to have a say, at least

1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:06.960
 that's what I kind of thought.

1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:12.200
 Whereas the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmidt was first of all, a bunch of my friends

1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:18.320
 and they grew up as astronomers making contributions on little teams and we decided to band together,

1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:20.440
 but all of us had our voices heard.

1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:25.480
 So it was sort of a culture, a style that I preferred really.

1:58:25.480 --> 1:58:30.240
 But let me tell you a story at the Nobel banquet, okay?

1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:35.020
 I'm sitting there between two physicists who are members of the committee of the Swedish

1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:39.920
 National Academy of Sciences, you know, and I strategically kept, you know, offering them

1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:45.080
 wine and stuff during this long drawn out Nobel ceremony, right?

1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:50.080
 And I got them to be pretty talkative and then in a polite diplomatic way, I started

1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:55.840
 asking them pointed questions and basically they admitted that if there are four or more

1:58:55.840 --> 1:59:01.600
 people equally deserving, they wait for one of them to die or they just don't give the

1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:07.040
 prize at all when it's unclear who the three are, at least unclear to them.

1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:12.400
 But unclear to them, they're not even right part of the time.

1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:20.920
 I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars with a radio antenna, a set of radio antennas that

1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:28.800
 her advisor Anthony Hewish conceived and built, so he deserves some credit, but he didn't

1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:30.520
 discover the pulsar.

1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:31.520
 She did.

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:38.400
 And his initial reaction to the data that she showed him was a condescending rubbish,

1:59:38.400 --> 1:59:39.400
 my dear.

1:59:39.400 --> 1:59:41.400
 Yeah, I'm not kidding.

1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:46.960
 Now, I know Jocelyn Bell and she did not let this destroy her life.

1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:51.080
 She won every other prize under the sun, okay?

1:59:51.080 --> 1:59:57.320
 Vera Rubin, arguably one of the discoverers of dark matter, although there, if you look

1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:00.520
 at the history, there were a number of people and that was the issue, I think there were

2:00:00.520 --> 2:00:06.480
 a number of people, four or more who had similar data and similar ideas at about the same time.

2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:12.440
 Rubin won every prize under the sun, the new big large scale survey telescope being built

2:00:12.440 --> 2:00:19.080
 in Chile is being renamed the Vera Rubin Telescope because she passed away in December of 2015,

2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:21.880
 I think.

2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:26.620
 You know, it'll conduct this survey, large scale survey with the Rubin Telescope.

2:00:26.620 --> 2:00:30.120
 So she's been recognized, but never with the Nobel Prize.

2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:36.000
 And I would say that to her credit, she did not let that consume her life either.

2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:41.200
 And perhaps it was a bit easier because there had been no Nobel given for the discovery

2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:46.840
 of dark matter, whereas in the case of pulsars and Jocelyn Bell, there was a prize given

2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:50.560
 for the discovery of the freaking pulsars and she didn't get it.

2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:53.080
 Well, I mean, what a travesty of justice.

2:00:53.080 --> 2:01:01.840
 So I also think as a fan of fiction, as a fan of stories that the travesty and the tragedy

2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:11.240
 and the unfairness and the tension of it is what makes the prize and similar prizes beautiful.

2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:19.200
 The decisions of other humans that result in dreams being broken and, you know, like

2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.600
 that's why we love the Olympics as so many, you know, people, athletes give their whole

2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:31.280
 life for this particular moment and then there's referee decisions and like little slips of

2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.400
 here and there, like the little misfortunes that destroy entire dreams.

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.360
 And that's, it's, it's weird to say, but it feels like that makes the entirety of it even

2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:43.360
 more special.

2:01:43.360 --> 2:01:44.360
 Yeah.

2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.720
 If it was perfect, it wouldn't be interesting.

2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:51.160
 Humans like competition and they like heroes and unfortunately it gives the impression

2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:57.720
 to youngsters today that science is still done by white men with gray beards wearing

2:01:57.720 --> 2:01:59.200
 white lab coats.

2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:04.080
 And I'm very pleased to see that this year, you know, Andrea Ghez, the fourth woman in

2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:07.520
 the history of the physics prize to have received it.

2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:14.000
 And then two women, one at Berkeley, one elsewhere won the Nobel prize in chemistry without any

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.040
 male co recipient.

2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:21.400
 And so that's sending a message I think to girls that they can do science and they have

2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:23.600
 role models.

2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:31.240
 I think the breakthrough prize and other such prizes show that teams get recognized as well.

2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:37.120
 And if you pay attention to the newspapers, you know, most of the good authors like, you

2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:41.520
 know, Dennis Overby of the New York Times and others said that these were teams of people

2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:46.040
 and they, they emphasize that and, you know, they all played a role.

2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:49.920
 And you know, maybe if some grad student hadn't soldered some circuit, maybe the whole thing

2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:52.220
 wouldn't have worked, you know.

2:02:52.220 --> 2:02:59.800
 But still, you know, Ray Weiss and Kip Thorne was the theoretical, you know, impetus for

2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:05.860
 the whole search for gravitational waves, Barry Barish brought the MIT and Caltech teams

2:03:05.860 --> 2:03:11.080
 together to get them to cooperate at a time when the project was nearly dead from what

2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:16.120
 I understand and contributed greatly to the experimental setup as well.

2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:20.280
 He's a great experimental physicist, but he was really good at bringing these two teams

2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:24.280
 together instead of having them duke it out in blows and leaving both of them bleeding

2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:25.280
 and dying.

2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:29.680
 You know, the National Science Foundation was going to cut the funding from what I understand,

2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:30.680
 you know.

2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:33.880
 So, so there's human drama involved in this whole thing.

2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:38.960
 And the Olympics, yeah, you know, a runner, a swimmer, a runner, runner, you know, they

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:43.720
 slip just at the moment that they were taking off from the first thing and that costs them

2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:46.400
 some fraction of a second and that's it.

2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:47.560
 They didn't win, you know.

2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:53.920
 And in that case, I mean, the coaches, the families, which I met a lot of Olympic athletes

2:03:53.920 --> 2:04:01.280
 and the coaches and the families of the athletes are really the winners of the medals.

2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:06.240
 But they don't get the medal and it's, you know, credit assignment is a fascinating thing.

2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:10.040
 I mean, that's the full human story we have.

2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:13.520
 And outside of prizes, it's fascinating.

2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:18.080
 I mean, just to be in the middle of it for artificial intelligence, there's a field of

2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:19.080
 deep learning.

2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:20.080
 That's really exciting.

2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:26.320
 And people have been, there's yet another award, the touring awards given for deep learning

2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:32.560
 to three folks who are very much responsible for the field, but so are a lot of others.

2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:33.960
 Yeah, that's right.

2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:43.480
 And there's a few, there's a, there's a fellow by the name of Schmidt Huber who sort of symbolizes

2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:48.880
 the, the forgotten folks in the deep learning community.

2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:55.040
 But you know, that's, that's the unfortunate sad thing where you remember, remember Isaac

2:04:55.040 --> 2:05:04.080
 Newton or remember these, these, these special figures and the ones that flew close to them,

2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:05.080
 we forget.

2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:06.080
 Well, that's right.

2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:10.220
 And you know, often the breakthroughs are made based on the body of knowledge that had

2:05:10.220 --> 2:05:13.320
 been assimilated prior to that.

2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:15.840
 But you know, again, people like to worship heroes.

2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:21.800
 You mentioned the Oscars earlier and you know, you look at the direct, I mean, well, I mean,

2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:26.520
 okay, directors and stuff sometimes get awards and stuff, but you know, you look at even

2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:30.320
 something like, I don't know, songwriters, musicians, Elton John or something, right?

2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:32.240
 Bernie Taupin, right?

2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:39.800
 Wrote many of the words or he's not as well known or the Beatles or something like that.

2:05:39.800 --> 2:05:43.400
 I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write most of the songs.

2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:44.400
 Yeah, Elvis.

2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:45.400
 That's right.

2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:46.400
 There you go.

2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:47.400
 But he was the king, right?

2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:50.840
 And he had such a personality and it was such a performer, right?

2:05:50.840 --> 2:05:53.880
 But it's the unsung heroes in many cases.

2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:54.880
 Yeah.

2:05:54.880 --> 2:06:00.480
 So maybe taking a step back, we talked about the Nobel prize of the accelerating universe,

2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:11.040
 but your work and the ideas around supernova were important in detecting this accelerating

2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:12.040
 universe.

2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:17.480
 Can we go to the very basics of what is this beautiful, mysterious object of a supernova?

2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:18.480
 Right.

2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:21.160
 So a supernova is an exploding star.

2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:25.660
 Most stars die a relatively quiet death, our own sun, well, despite the fact that it'll

2:06:25.660 --> 2:06:30.360
 become a red giant and incinerate earth, it'll do that reasonably slowly.

2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:35.860
 But there's a small minority of stars that end their lives in a Titanic explosion.

2:06:35.860 --> 2:06:40.880
 And that's not only exciting to watch from afar, but it's critical to our existence because

2:06:40.880 --> 2:06:46.960
 it is in these explosions that the heavy elements synthesize through nuclear reactions during

2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:52.640
 the normal course of the star's evolution and during the explosion itself, get injected

2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:59.560
 into the cosmos, making them available as raw material for new stars, planets, and ultimately

2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:00.560
 life.

2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:04.880
 And that's just a great story, the best in some ways.

2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:11.040
 So we like to study these things and our origins, but it turns out these are incredibly useful

2:07:11.040 --> 2:07:19.640
 beacons as well, because if you know how powerful an exploding star really is by measuring the

2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:25.680
 apparent brightness at its peak in galaxies whose distances we already know through having

2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:32.040
 made other measurements, and you can thus calibrate how powerful the thing really is,

2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:38.360
 and then you find ones that are much more distant, then you can use their observed brightness

2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:43.780
 compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity to judge their distance and hence

2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:49.160
 the distance of the galaxy in which they're located.

2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:51.980
 Let me just give this one analogy.

2:07:51.980 --> 2:07:57.160
 You judge the distance of an oncoming car at night by looking at how bright its headlights

2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:02.600
 appear to be, and you've calibrated how bright the headlights are of a car that's two or

2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:07.760
 three meters away of known distance, and you go, oh, that's a faint headlight, and so that's

2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:09.120
 pretty far away.

2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:14.120
 You also use the apparent angular separation between the two headlights as a consistency

2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:16.720
 check in your brain, but that's what your brain is doing.

2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:19.760
 So we can do that for cars, we can do that for stars.

2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:21.720
 Nice, I like that.

2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:28.480
 But you know, with cars, the headlights are all, there's some variation, but they're somewhat

2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:32.480
 similar so you can make those kinds of conclusions.

2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:38.880
 How much variation is there between supernova that you can detect them?

2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:42.800
 Right, so first of all, there are several different ways that stars can explode, and

2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:47.540
 it depends on their mass and whether they're in a binary system and things like that.

2:08:47.540 --> 2:08:52.840
 And the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes, studying the expansion of the history

2:08:52.840 --> 2:09:00.560
 of the universe, are the so called type Roman numeral I, lowercase a, type Ia supernovae.

2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:04.340
 They come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf.

2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:09.080
 Our own sun will turn into a white dwarf in about seven billion years.

2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:14.920
 It'll have about half its present mass compressed into a volume just the size of Earth.

2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.120
 So that's an inordinate density, okay?

2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:18.880
 It's incredibly dense.

2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:23.400
 And the matter is what's called by quantum physicists degenerate matter, not because

2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:28.400
 it's morally reprehensible or anything like that, but this is just the name that quantum

2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:33.000
 physicists give to electrons that are squeezed into a very tight space.

2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:39.240
 The electrons take on a motion due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and also due to the

2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:43.860
 Pauli exclusion principle that electrons don't like to be in the same place, they like to

2:09:43.860 --> 2:09:44.860
 avoid each other.

2:09:44.860 --> 2:09:50.280
 And those two things mean that a lot of electrons are moving very rapidly, which gives the star

2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:56.040
 an extra pressure far above the thermal pressure associated with just the random motions of

2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:57.920
 particles inside the star.

2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:04.680
 So it's a weird type of star, but normally it wouldn't explode and our sun won't explode,

2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:10.240
 except that if such a white dwarf is in a pair with another more or less normal star,

2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:18.760
 it can steal material from that normal star until it gets to an unstable limit, roughly

2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:22.460
 one and a half times the mass of our sun, 1.4 or so.

2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:29.200
 This is known as the Chandrasekhar limit after Subramanian Chandrasekhar, an Indian astrophysicist

2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:34.960
 who figured this out when he was about 20 years old on a voyage from India to England

2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:37.000
 where he was to be educated.

2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:42.520
 And then he did this and then 50 years later he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1984

2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:48.600
 largely for this work that he did as a youngster who was on his way to be educated.

2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:54.440
 And his advisor, the great Arthur Eddington in England, who had done a lot of great things

2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:59.640
 and was a great astrophysicist, nevertheless, he too was human and had his faults.

2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:07.400
 He ridiculed Chandra's scientific work at a conference in England and most of us, if

2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:12.760
 we had been Chandra, would have just given up astrophysics at that time when the great

2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:16.880
 Arthur Eddington ridicules our work.

2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:19.960
 That's another inspirational story for the youngster.

2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:20.960
 Just keep going.

2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:28.960
 But anyway, no matter what your advisor says or don't always pay attention to your advisor.

2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:32.520
 Don't lose hope if you really think you're onto something.

2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:34.360
 That doesn't mean never listen to your advisor.

2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.720
 They may have sage advice as well.

2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:43.540
 But anyway, when a white dwarf grows to a certain mass, it becomes unstable.

2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:48.960
 And one of the ways it can end its life is to go through a thermonuclear runaway.

2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:54.960
 So basically, the carbon nuclei inside the white dwarf start fusing together to form

2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:56.880
 heavier nuclei.

2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:06.800
 And the energy that those fusion reactions emit doesn't go into being dissipated out

2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:14.120
 of the star or expanding it the way if you take a blowtorch to the middle of the Sun,

2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:17.640
 you heat up its gases, the gases would expand and cool.

2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:21.240
 But this degenerate star can't expand and cool.

2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:27.200
 And so the energy pumped in through these fusion reactions goes into making the nuclei

2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:28.560
 move faster.

2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:33.880
 And that gets more of them sufficiently close together that they can undergo nuclear fusion,

2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:38.880
 thereby releasing more energy that goes into speeding up more nuclei.

2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:46.440
 And thus you have a runaway, a bomb, an uncontrolled fusion reactor instead of the controlled fusion,

2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:48.360
 which is what our Sun does.

2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:51.420
 Our Sun is a marvelous controlled fusion reactor.

2:12:51.420 --> 2:12:56.280
 This is what we need here on Earth, fusion energy to solve our energy crisis, right?

2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:01.100
 But the Sun holds the stuff in through gravity and you need a big mass to do that.

2:13:01.100 --> 2:13:07.600
 So this uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star that's pretty much the same in

2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:09.640
 all cases.

2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.000
 And you measure it to be almost the same in all cases.

2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:18.940
 But the devil is in the details, and in fact, we observe them to not be all the same.

2:13:18.940 --> 2:13:23.360
 And theoretically, they might not be all the same because the rate of the fusion reactions

2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:28.600
 might depend on the amount of trace heavier elements in the white dwarf.

2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:33.440
 And that could depend on how old it is, whether it was born billions of years ago when there

2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:38.300
 weren't many heavier elements or whether it's a relatively young white dwarf and all

2:13:38.300 --> 2:13:40.080
 kinds of other things.

2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:44.940
 And part of my work was to show that indeed, not all the Type Ia's are the same.

2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:47.520
 You have to be careful when you use them.

2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:49.160
 You have to calibrate them.

2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:55.460
 They're not standard candles the way it just, if all headlights or all candles were the

2:13:55.460 --> 2:13:59.900
 same lumens or whatever, you'd say they're standard and then it would be relative.

2:13:59.900 --> 2:14:01.940
 Standard candles is an awesome term, okay.

2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:05.700
 Standard candles is what astronomers like to say, but I don't like that term because

2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:10.240
 there aren't any standard candles, but there are standardizable candles.

2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:17.800
 And by looking at these type Ia's, you look at enough of them in nearby galaxies whose

2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:20.640
 distances you know independently.

2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:25.220
 And what you can tell is that, you know, this is something that a colleague of mine, Mark

2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:30.560
 Phillips did who was on Schmidt's team and arguably was one of the people who deserved

2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:31.560
 the Nobel Prize.

2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:39.720
 He showed that the intrinsically more powerful Type Ia's decline in brightness, and it turns

2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:45.080
 out rise in brightness as well, more slowly than the less luminous Ia's.

2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:50.260
 And so if you calibrate this by measuring a whole bunch of nearby ones and then you

2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:56.120
 look at a distant one, instead of saying, well, it's a 100 watt Type Ia supernova, they're

2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:01.440
 much more powerful than that by the way, plus or minus 50, you can say, no, it's a hundred

2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:08.940
 and 12 plus or minus 15, or it's 84 plus or minus 17.

2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:15.240
 It tells you where it is in the power scale and it greatly decreases the uncertainties.

2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:18.720
 And that's what makes these things cosmologically useful.

2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:24.080
 I showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum, you can tell spectroscopically

2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:26.560
 that these things are different as well.

2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:33.580
 And in 1991, I happened to study two of the extreme peculiar ones, the low luminosity

2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:40.560
 ones and the high luminosity ones, 1991BG and 1991T.

2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:43.520
 This showed that not all the Ia's are the same.

2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:50.520
 And indeed, at the time of 1991, I was a little bit skeptical that we could use Type Ia's

2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:53.120
 because of this diversity that I was observing.

2:15:53.120 --> 2:16:00.080
 But in 1993, Mark Phillips wrote a paper that showed this correlation between the light

2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:03.760
 curve, the brightness versus time and the peak luminosity.

2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:05.920
 Which gives you enough information to calibrate.

2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:08.280
 Then they become calibratable and that was a game changer.

2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:12.320
 How many Type Ia's are out there to use for data?

2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:19.840
 Now there are thousands of them, but at the time, the high Z team had 16 and the supernova

2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:22.640
 cosmology project had 40.

2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:25.840
 But the 16 were better measured than the 40.

2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:31.080
 And so our statistical uncertainties were comparable if you look at the two papers that

2:16:31.080 --> 2:16:32.080
 were published.

2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:38.760
 How does that make you feel that there's these gigantic explosions just sprinkled out there?

2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.380
 Well, I certainly don't want one to be very nearby and it would have to be within something

2:16:43.380 --> 2:16:46.400
 like 10 light years to be an existential threat.

2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:48.960
 So they can happen in our galaxy?

2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:49.960
 Oh yeah, yeah.

2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:52.480
 So they would be okay?

2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:57.160
 In most cases we'd be okay because our galaxy is 100,000 light years across.

2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:01.360
 And you'd need one of these things to be within about 10 light years to be an existential

2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:02.360
 threat.

2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:07.040
 And it gives birth to a bunch of other stars, I guess?

2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:11.060
 Yeah, it gives birth to expanding gases that are chemically enriched and those expanding

2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:17.520
 gases mixed with other chemically enriched expanding gases or primordial clouds of hydrogen

2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:18.520
 and helium.

2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:24.800
 I mean, this is in a sense the greatest story ever told, right?

2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:29.840
 I teach this introductory astronomy course at Berkeley and I tell them there's only five

2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:34.660
 or six things that I want them to really understand and remember and I'm going to come to their

2:17:34.660 --> 2:17:39.020
 deathbed and I'm going to ask them about this and if they get it wrong, I will retroactively

2:17:39.020 --> 2:17:42.240
 fail and their whole career will have been shot.

2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:43.240
 That's a student's worst nightmare.

2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:46.680
 If they don't know and observe a total solar eclipse and yet they had the opportunity to

2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:49.080
 do so, I will retroactively fail them.

2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:51.800
 But one of them is, where did we come from?

2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:54.560
 Where did the elements in our DNA come from?

2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:59.480
 The carbon in our cells, the oxygen that we breathe, the calcium in our bones, the iron

2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:01.780
 in our red blood cells.

2:18:01.780 --> 2:18:07.680
 Those elements, the phosphorus in our DNA, they all came from stars, from nuclear reactions

2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:15.280
 in stars and they were ejected into the cosmos and in some cases, like iron, made during

2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:22.200
 the explosions and those gases drifted out, mixed with other clouds, made a new star or

2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:30.240
 a star cluster, some of whose members then evolved and exploded, thus enriching the gases

2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:35.120
 in the galaxy progressively more with time until finally, four and a half billion years

2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:41.560
 ago from one of these chemically enriched clouds, our solar system formed with a rocky

2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:49.440
 earthlike planet and somewhere, somehow, these self replicating, evolving molecules, bacteria

2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:58.940
 formed and evolved through paramecia and amoebas and slugs and apes and us.

2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:05.040
 And here we are, sentient beings that can ask these questions about our very origins

2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:12.540
 and with our intellect and with the machines we make, come to a reasonable understanding

2:19:12.540 --> 2:19:15.080
 of our origins.

2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:16.640
 What a beautiful story.

2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:24.280
 I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in love with science and its

2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:30.100
 power of deduction, I don't know what will, right?

2:19:30.100 --> 2:19:33.040
 It's one of the greatest stories, if not the greatest story.

2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:38.040
 Obviously, that's personality dependent and all that, it's a subjective opinion, but it's

2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:41.280
 perhaps the greatest story ever told.

2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:45.040
 I mean, you could link it to the Big Bang and go even farther, right, to make an even

2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:51.600
 more complete story, but as a subset, that's even in some ways a greater story than even

2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:56.280
 the existence of the universe in some ways, because you could just imagine some really

2:19:56.280 --> 2:20:01.300
 boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures such as ourselves.

2:20:01.300 --> 2:20:06.880
 And is a supernova usually the introduction to that story?

2:20:06.880 --> 2:20:12.200
 So are they usually the thing that launches the, is there other engines of creation?

2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:18.360
 Well, the supernova is the one, I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course,

2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:22.880
 in fact, right about now in my lectures, because I talk about how our sun right now is fusing

2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:29.440
 hydrogen to form helium nuclei and later it'll form carbon and oxygen nuclei, but that's

2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:34.160
 where the process will stop for our sun, it's not massive enough, some stars that are more

2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:37.060
 massive can go somewhat beyond that.

2:20:37.060 --> 2:20:42.760
 So that's the beginning of this idea of the birth of the heavy elements, since they couldn't

2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:47.480
 have been born at the time of the Big Bang, conditions of temperature and pressure weren't

2:20:47.480 --> 2:20:51.960
 sufficient to make any significant quantities of the heavier elements.

2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:57.480
 And so that's the beginning, but then you need some of these stars to explode, right?

2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:03.020
 Because if those heavy elements remained forever trapped in the cores of stars, then they would

2:21:03.020 --> 2:21:08.920
 not be available for the production of new stars, planets, and ultimately life.

2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:17.400
 So indeed the supernova, my main area of interest, plays a leading role in this whole story.

2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:22.520
 I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman a mentor of yours when you were at

2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:23.520
 Caltech.

2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:24.520
 Yeah.

2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:28.880
 Do you have any fond memories of Feynman, any lessons that stick with you?

2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:36.040
 Oh yeah, he was quite a character and one of the deepest thinkers of all time probably,

2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:42.840
 and at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding

2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:48.960
 of how nature works of anyone I've met.

2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:53.240
 I learned a number of things from him, he was not my thesis advisor, I worked with Wallace

2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:58.140
 Sargent at Caltech on what are called active galaxies, big black holes in the centers of

2:21:58.140 --> 2:22:03.180
 galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material, a little bit like the stuff of this

2:22:03.180 --> 2:22:06.860
 year's Nobel Prize in Physics 2020.

2:22:06.860 --> 2:22:12.180
 But Feynman I had for two courses, one was general theory of relativity at the graduate

2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:18.100
 level and one was applications of quantum physics to all kinds of interesting things.

2:22:18.100 --> 2:22:28.880
 And he had this very intuitive way of looking at things that he tried to bring to his students

2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:38.200
 and he felt that if you can't explain something in a reasonably simple way to a non scientist

2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:43.680
 or at least someone who is versed a little bit with science but is not a professional

2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:49.420
 scientist then you probably don't understand it very well yourself very thoroughly.

2:22:49.420 --> 2:22:58.400
 So that in me made a desire to be able to explain science to the general public and

2:22:58.400 --> 2:23:02.580
 I've often found that in explaining things, yeah, there's a certain part that I didn't

2:23:02.580 --> 2:23:06.760
 really understand myself, that's one reason I like to teach the introductory courses to

2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:12.700
 the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking in my own mind.

2:23:12.700 --> 2:23:14.180
 So he did that for me.

2:23:14.180 --> 2:23:18.220
 Is there a, if I could just pause for a second, you said he had one of the most intuitive

2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:20.820
 understanding of nature.

2:23:20.820 --> 2:23:26.940
 What if you could break apart what intuitive means, like is that on the philosophical level?

2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:28.580
 No, sort of physical.

2:23:28.580 --> 2:23:33.660
 How do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper of what's going on?

2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:39.000
 And he's perhaps most famous in this regard for his Feynman diagrams, which in what's

2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:44.140
 called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism.

2:23:44.140 --> 2:23:48.800
 What you have are actually an exchange of photons between charged particles and they

2:23:48.800 --> 2:23:55.500
 might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one another.

2:23:55.500 --> 2:24:00.140
 And there are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and

2:24:00.140 --> 2:24:02.340
 pages of calculations.

2:24:02.340 --> 2:24:06.780
 And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics for that and won the Nobel prize

2:24:06.780 --> 2:24:07.780
 for it.

2:24:07.780 --> 2:24:12.500
 But Feynman had these diagrams that he made and he had a set of rules of what to do at

2:24:12.500 --> 2:24:13.500
 the vertex.

2:24:13.500 --> 2:24:17.020
 You'd have two particles coming together and then a particle going out and then two particles

2:24:17.020 --> 2:24:18.020
 coming out again.

2:24:18.020 --> 2:24:22.100
 And he'd have these rules associated when there were vertices and when there were particles

2:24:22.100 --> 2:24:24.380
 splitting off from one another and all that.

2:24:24.380 --> 2:24:27.920
 And it looked a little bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first.

2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:34.220
 But to those who learned the rules and understood them, they saw that you could do these complex

2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:37.340
 calculations in a much simpler way.

2:24:37.340 --> 2:24:42.700
 And indeed, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better knack for explaining really

2:24:42.700 --> 2:24:46.180
 what quantum electrodynamics actually was.

2:24:46.180 --> 2:24:48.300
 But I didn't know Freeman Dyson.

2:24:48.300 --> 2:24:49.300
 I knew Feynman.

2:24:49.300 --> 2:24:52.920
 Maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world than Feynman did.

2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.860
 But of the people I knew, Feynman was the most intuitive, most sort of, is there a picture?

2:24:58.860 --> 2:25:01.980
 Is there a simple way you can understand this?

2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:10.580
 In the path that a particle follows even, you can get the classical path, at least for

2:25:10.580 --> 2:25:14.700
 a baseball or something like that, by using quantum physics if you want.

2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:19.740
 But in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths.

2:25:19.740 --> 2:25:23.060
 It goes out to the Andromeda galaxy and then goes to the batter.

2:25:23.060 --> 2:25:28.420
 But the probability of doing that is very, very small because tiny little paths next

2:25:28.420 --> 2:25:32.500
 door to any given path cancel out that path.

2:25:32.500 --> 2:25:38.940
 And the ones that all add together, they're the ones that are more likely to be followed.

2:25:38.940 --> 2:25:45.740
 And this actually ties in with Fermat's principle of least action and there are ideas in optics

2:25:45.740 --> 2:25:50.620
 that go into this as well and just sort of beautifully brings everything together.

2:25:50.620 --> 2:25:54.060
 But the particle sniffs out all possible paths.

2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:55.060
 What a crazy idea.

2:25:55.060 --> 2:26:00.980
 But if you do the mathematics associated with that, it ends up being actually useful, a

2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:02.540
 useful way of looking at the world.

2:26:02.540 --> 2:26:07.780
 So you're also, I mean, you're widely acknowledged as, I mean, outside of your science work as

2:26:07.780 --> 2:26:12.500
 being one of the greatest educators in the world.

2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:16.140
 And Feynman is famous for being that.

2:26:16.140 --> 2:26:19.220
 Is there something about being a teacher that you...

2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:23.260
 Well, it's very, very rewarding when you have students who are really into it.

2:26:23.260 --> 2:26:29.220
 You know, going back to Feynman, at Caltech, I was taking these graduate courses and there

2:26:29.220 --> 2:26:34.140
 were two of us, myself and Jeff Richmond, who's now a professor of physics at University

2:26:34.140 --> 2:26:38.100
 of California, Santa Barbara, who asked lots of questions.

2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:42.780
 And a lot of the Caltech students are nervous about asking questions.

2:26:42.780 --> 2:26:43.980
 They want to save face.

2:26:43.980 --> 2:26:49.100
 They seem to think that if they ask a question, their peers might think it's a stupid question.

2:26:49.100 --> 2:26:52.620
 Well, I didn't really care what people thought and Jeff Richmond didn't either.

2:26:52.620 --> 2:26:57.300
 We asked all these questions and in fact, in many cases, they were quite good questions

2:26:57.300 --> 2:27:00.660
 and Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions like this.

2:27:00.660 --> 2:27:07.260
 And I remember one time in particular when he said to the rest of the class, why is it

2:27:07.260 --> 2:27:09.620
 always these two?

2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:12.020
 Aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm saying?

2:27:12.020 --> 2:27:14.580
 Do you really understand it all that well?

2:27:14.580 --> 2:27:17.980
 If so, why aren't you asking the next most logical question?

2:27:17.980 --> 2:27:23.300
 No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking.

2:27:23.300 --> 2:27:28.420
 So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and

2:27:28.420 --> 2:27:33.540
 had lunch with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics.

2:27:33.540 --> 2:27:38.220
 And so, yeah, he rubbed off on me and, you know, you encourage questions as well, encourage

2:27:38.220 --> 2:27:45.140
 questions, you know, and yeah, you know, definitely, I mean, you know, I encourage questions.

2:27:45.140 --> 2:27:46.980
 I like it when students ask questions.

2:27:46.980 --> 2:27:51.340
 I tell them that they shouldn't feel shy about asking a question.

2:27:51.340 --> 2:27:55.580
 Probably half the students in the class would have that same question if they even understood

2:27:55.580 --> 2:27:58.460
 the material enough to ask that question.

2:27:58.460 --> 2:27:59.460
 Yeah.

2:27:59.460 --> 2:28:04.580
 Curiosity is the first step of seeing the beauty of something.

2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:10.180
 So yeah, and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity.

2:28:10.180 --> 2:28:14.220
 Let me ask, what is the meaning of life?

2:28:14.220 --> 2:28:19.900
 The meaning of life, you know, from a cosmologist's perspective or from a human perspective, personal,

2:28:19.900 --> 2:28:23.300
 you know, life is what you make of it, really, right?

2:28:23.300 --> 2:28:31.100
 It's each of us has to have our own meaning and it doesn't have to be.

2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:36.220
 Well, I think that in many cases, meaning is to some degree associated with goals.

2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:41.380
 You set some goals or expectations for yourself, things you want to accomplish, things you

2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:47.100
 want to do, things you want to experience, and to the degree that you experience those

2:28:47.100 --> 2:28:50.740
 and do those things, it can give you meaning.

2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:56.540
 You don't have to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or da Vinci did.

2:28:56.540 --> 2:29:00.180
 I mean, people often say, you changed the world, but look, come on, there's seven and

2:29:00.180 --> 2:29:02.780
 a half, close to eight billion of us now.

2:29:02.780 --> 2:29:06.300
 Most of us are not going to change the world and does that mean that most of us are leading

2:29:06.300 --> 2:29:07.900
 meaningful lives?

2:29:07.900 --> 2:29:15.220
 No, it just has to be something that gives you meaning, that gives you satisfaction,

2:29:15.220 --> 2:29:17.860
 that gives you a good feeling about what you did.

2:29:17.860 --> 2:29:24.480
 And often, based on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad, but often

2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:31.800
 it's the things that help others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction.

2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:37.100
 You taught someone to read, you cared for someone who was terminally ill, you brought

2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:43.220
 up a nice family, you brought up your kids, you did a good job, you put your heart and

2:29:43.220 --> 2:29:49.780
 soul into it, you read a lot of books if that's what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives

2:29:49.780 --> 2:29:54.840
 on life, you traveled the world if that's what you wanted to do.

2:29:54.840 --> 2:30:00.260
 But if some of these things are not within reach, you're in a socioeconomic position

2:30:00.260 --> 2:30:06.500
 where you can't travel the world or whatever, you find other forms of meaning.

2:30:06.500 --> 2:30:13.660
 It doesn't have to be some profound, I'm going to change the world, I'm going to be

2:30:13.660 --> 2:30:17.900
 the one who everyone remembers type thing, right?

2:30:17.900 --> 2:30:26.100
 In the context of the greatest story ever told, like the fact that we came from stars

2:30:26.100 --> 2:30:31.500
 and now we're two apes asking about the meaning of life, how does that fit together?

2:30:31.500 --> 2:30:34.780
 How does that make any sense?

2:30:34.780 --> 2:30:39.700
 It does, it does, and this is sort of what I was referring to, that it's a beautiful

2:30:39.700 --> 2:30:46.820
 universe that allows us to come into creation, right?

2:30:46.820 --> 2:30:52.780
 It's a way that the universe found of knowing, of understanding itself, because I don't

2:30:52.780 --> 2:31:00.420
 think that inanimate rocks and stars and black holes and things have any real capability

2:31:00.420 --> 2:31:08.260
 of abstract thoughts and of learning about the rest of the universe or even their origins.

2:31:08.260 --> 2:31:16.060
 I mean, they're just a pile of atoms that has no conscience, has no ability to think,

2:31:16.060 --> 2:31:20.620
 has no ability to explore, and we do.

2:31:20.620 --> 2:31:27.940
 And I'm not saying we're the epitome of all life forever, but at least for life on Earth

2:31:27.940 --> 2:31:36.060
 so far the evidence suggests that we are the epitome in terms of the richness of our thoughts,

2:31:36.060 --> 2:31:42.180
 the degree to which we can explore the universe, do experiments, build machines, understand

2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:43.180
 our origins.

2:31:43.180 --> 2:31:50.300
 And I just hope that we use science for good, not evil, and that we don't end up destroying

2:31:50.300 --> 2:31:51.300
 ourselves.

2:31:51.300 --> 2:31:54.320
 I mean, the whales and dolphins are plenty intelligent.

2:31:54.320 --> 2:31:59.180
 They don't ask abstract questions, they don't read books, but on the other hand, they're

2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:03.360
 not in any danger of destroying themselves and everything else as well.

2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:10.100
 And so maybe that's a better form of intelligence, but at least in terms of our ability to explore

2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:16.300
 and make use of our minds, I mean, to me, it's this.

2:32:16.300 --> 2:32:21.740
 It's this that gives me the potential for meaning, right?

2:32:21.740 --> 2:32:24.520
 The fact that I can understand and explore.

2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:31.560
 It's kind of fascinating to think that the universe created us and eventually we've built

2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:38.500
 telescopes to look back at it, to look back at its origins and to wonder how the heck

2:32:38.500 --> 2:32:39.500
 the thing works.

2:32:39.500 --> 2:32:40.500
 It's magnificent.

2:32:40.500 --> 2:32:44.260
 It needn't have been that way, right?

2:32:44.260 --> 2:32:48.480
 And this is one of the, you know, the multiverse sort of things.

2:32:48.480 --> 2:32:53.460
 You know, you can alter the laws of physics or even the constants of nature, seemingly

2:32:53.460 --> 2:32:58.020
 inconsequential things like the mass ratio of the proton and the neutron, you know, wake

2:32:58.020 --> 2:32:59.720
 me up when it's over, right?

2:32:59.720 --> 2:33:00.720
 What could be more boring?

2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:04.900
 But it turns out you play with things a little bit like the ratio of the mass of the neutron

2:33:04.900 --> 2:33:11.700
 to the proton and you generally get boring universes, only hydrogen or only helium or

2:33:11.700 --> 2:33:12.700
 only iron.

2:33:12.700 --> 2:33:19.020
 You can't even get the rich periodic table, let alone bacteria, paramecia, slugs and humans,

2:33:19.020 --> 2:33:20.020
 okay?

2:33:20.020 --> 2:33:25.440
 I'm not even anthropocentrizing this to the degree that I could.

2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:33.060
 Even a rich periodic table wouldn't be possible if certain constants weren't this way, but

2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:34.060
 they are.

2:33:34.060 --> 2:33:39.420
 And that to me leads to the idea of a multiverse that, you know, the dice were thrown many,

2:33:39.420 --> 2:33:44.020
 many times and there's this cosmic archipelago where most of the universes are boring and

2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.700
 some might be more interesting.

2:33:45.700 --> 2:33:51.700
 But we are in the rare breed that's really quite darn interesting.

2:33:51.700 --> 2:33:57.060
 And if there were only one and maybe there is only one, well then that's truly amazing.

2:33:57.060 --> 2:33:58.060
 We're lucky.

2:33:58.060 --> 2:33:59.060
 We're lucky.

2:33:59.060 --> 2:34:03.020
 But I actually think there are lots and lots, just like there are lots of planets.

2:34:03.020 --> 2:34:05.860
 Earth isn't special for any particular reason.

2:34:05.860 --> 2:34:09.820
 There are lots of planets in our solar system and especially around other stars.

2:34:09.820 --> 2:34:14.660
 And occasionally there are going to be ones that are conducive to the development of complexity

2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:17.100
 culminating in life as we know it.

2:34:17.100 --> 2:34:18.820
 And that's a beautiful story.

2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:21.660
 I don't think there's a better way to end it.

2:34:21.660 --> 2:34:23.100
 Alex, it's a huge honor.

2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:25.300
 One of my favorite conversations I've had in this podcast.

2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:27.580
 Well, thank you so much for talking to us.

2:34:27.580 --> 2:34:31.900
 For the honor of having been asked to do this.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.

2:35:19.580 --> 2:35:26.880
 The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in

2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:32.340
 our apple pies, were made in the interiors of collapsing stars.

2:35:32.340 --> 2:35:36.060
 We are made of star stuff.

2:35:36.060 --> 2:35:57.380
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
